UNESCO | the new Courier | April 2003 
million adults - nearly one sixth of the 
world’s population - cannot read or write. 
Most have never attended school or did 
  
so only for a brief period. Grinding poverty, but also the 
wars, famine and natural disasters that displace populations 
for years or more, are generally to blame, but not always. 
Available evidence suggests that functional illiteracy - the 
inability to decipher labels or the ordinary instructions 
required to fill out a form or apply for a job - affects as 
many as one quarter of citizens in some of the world’s more 
affluent societies. More and better educational facilities 
and systems are required to help a huge number of our 
contemporaries out of the poverty trap to which illiteracy, 
among other factors, has confined them. 
Making good on the promise of sound primary 
education for all children everywhere by 2015 - the goal 
solemnly proclaimed at the Dakar World Education Forum 
in 2000 by the representatives of the vast majority of 
world’s States - is obviously the place to start. But the 
progress recorded so far gives little cause for optimism. Of 
the 164 countries that committed themselves to achieving 
education for all by 2015, 70, it now appears, may fall short. 
Most of them are in sub-Saharan Africa, but also included 
are Bangladesh, China, India and Pakistan - four countries 
which together account for 61 percent of the world’s 
illiterate adults today. 
In this, its second issue, UNESCO’s new Courier, in 
cooperation with a team of international correspondents 
from The Times Education Supplement in London, takes 
a hard look at the issues to be addressed and some of the 
challenges to be overcome in the course of the United 
Nations Literacy Decade (2003-12). The picture it draws is 
sobering, but not hopeless. New approaches which seek to 
eliminate cultural and linguistic barriers, and to tie literacy 
training with activities critical to people’s daily lives, have 
shown considerable potential in the countries where they 
have been introduced. Better yet, two of those countries, we 
discovered, are Bangladesh and India.

in jail. Nepal has the highest 
number of imprisoned journalists 
(24), followed by Eritrea (18),

that press freedom is increasingly 
threatened, with little or no progress 
in countries with long-standing 
freedom of expression problems. 
In some areas where progress has 
been identified (Namibia, West 
Africa, El Salvador, Honduras,

Solidarity... 
When Ma Yan's illiterate and 
impoverished mother thrust 
a letter and a diary written 
by her 14 year-old daughter 
into the hands of a French 
journalist early last year, 
she had no idea that she 
was about to transform not 
only her own family’s life, 
but also the lives of dozens 
of others in China’s remote 
north-western Ningxia 
province. 
“How can you condemn 
me to this misery? I want 
to study!” 
who, like many other young 
wrote Ma Yan, 
girls in her region was being 
withdrawn from school 
because her family could no 
longer afford to send her. 
Her letter, a veritable plea 
for the right to an education, 
was published by the French 
daily, Libération, provoking 
a wave of solidarity from 
readers in several countries 
who formed an association 
to keep Ma Yan and other 
children like her in Ningxia 
in school. Her diary has also 
been published in France 
and has become a best seller. 
“It’s like a dream,” she says.

Despite considerable 
progress in many 
areas, the Arab States 
are threatened by 
“inertia”, states the 
first Arab Human 
Development Report, 
published by the 
UNDP in 2002. 
Over the past three 
decades, notes the 
report, health and 
education have 
greatly improved and 
the struggle against 
poverty has gained 
ground throughout 
the region, which, 
with 280 million 
adds, over the past 
20 years, growth in 
per capita income 
has been the lowest 
in the world, except 
in sub-Saharan 
Africa. According 
to the report, three 
“defecits” explain 
this stagnation: 
freedom, women’s 
empowerment and 
knowledge. In terms 
of freedom, the 
the Arab region, 
compared with 
other world regions, 
is at the bottom of 
the ladder. At least 
women do not know . 
how to read or write. .

access to information

technologies: only 0.6

people accounts for 
five percent of the 
world’s population. 
Life expectancy has 
increased by 15 years 
and infant mortality 
has fallen by two 
thirds. The levels of 
adult illiteracy and 
absolute poverty have 
also been signicantly 
reduced.

You recently received the UNESCO Madanjeet Singh 
Prize for Tolerance and Non-Violence. Over many years, 
you have been given countless international awards, 
including the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991. How helpful 
have these awards been for you? 
>» It’s very helpful to the movement because 
it’s a sign that people all over the world support us and feel 
for us. So I do not look upon these awards as something 
personal, but as something given to the movement. 
What are you expecting from the international 
community and especially from the UN? 
>» We would like to see the UN standing very firmly by 
the General Assembly resolution! on Burma and to try to 
implement the terms of the resolution as quickly as possible. 
And we would like the whole international community to 
support the UN and this. 
What has been the impact of international 
sanctions? 
» When people talk about international sanctions they 
generally are talking about the US sanctions. And I often 
have to remind people that the US sanctions simply prevent 
United States businessmen from making new investments. 
The investments that were made before the sanctions were 
implemented are still in place. From this point of view, we 
cannot say that these sanctions have had a very important 
impact economically. But they have had very important 
political impact, because they demonstrate that the people 
of the United States are concerned about what is going on 
in Burma. And the fact that the United States has imposed 
sanctions also makes other countries sit up and take notice. 
Do you think sanctions can push the country 
towards democracy? 
» I don’t think the sanctions alone will push the country 
towards democracy. I think in a complex situation like ours 
we need many, many different lines of effort before we can 
achieve the changes that we want. 
What is your interpretation, your vision 
of democracy? 
» It is something I ask people of Burma when I go travelling 
all over the country. Especially when I come to rural 
Burma, to villages, I will ask people what they mean by the

strongly urging the Government of Myanmar “to restore democracy and 
implement the results of the 1990 election and to ensure that the contacts with 
Aung San Suu Kyi and other leaders of the National League for Democracy 
move without delay into substantive and structured dialogue towards 
democratisation and national reconciliation and at an early stage to include 
other political leaders in these talks, including the representatives of the ethnic 
groups [...] to release unconditionnally and immediately all political prisoners.”

### 130037: Talking to Aung San Suu Kyi: we've got to move forward

  
talking to 
democracy, why do they want democracy. And quite often 
they just say we want to be free. So I define democracy as a 
system that guarantees both freedom and security. Of course 
people have to feel secure, but we don’t want a false kind 
of security, which allows no freedom at all. So this is what 
I mean by democracy. Of course this means there have to 
be the basic democratic institutions such as an independent 
judiciary, regular free and fair elections, free press and so 
on. But given these basics I think we will probably find our 
own form of democracy. This has happened all over the 
world. France has its own kind of democracy, and the United 
States has its own kind of democracy, for example. 
Do you think international support had something 
to do with your release last May? 
>» As I said, not everything is due to international support. 
But international support does play an important part. 
What are the other factors? 
» The fact that people in our country do want change. And 
that it is better for us to be on good terms than to be on 
bad terms. I would like to give the regime the benefit of 
the doubt, and I would like to believe that they genuinely 
want to do what is good for the country. And they see that 
reconciliation is the best thing possible that can be done. 
Are you really free? 
» I am free. But freedom is relative, in the sense that I am 
free, but people are not always free to come to see me. This 
was made obvious during my last trip to the state of Arakan 
when the general public were prevented from coming to 
meet me, to demonstrate their support for me. 
When I was released, I said that I have been released but 
we have not achieved democracy. So it’s certainly nothing 
like the end of the road. We are just somewhere at the 
beginning, because we’ve got to move forward. And the 
message I would like to get across to everybody now is that 
it’s important for us to move forward as quickly as possible 
for the sake of the country. 
Have you been able to resume your normal 
political activities as the leader of a lawful party ? 
» I am not yet able to operate as a normal leader of a normal 
political party, because none of the political parties in Burma 
are allowed to operate as normal political parties. This is 
what we're trying to achieve, this is one of the factors that is 
important for the process of change. 
The political situation has changed to a certain degree. 
The most obvious change, of course, is that the National 
League of Democracy has been able to expand operations 
to a certain extent. I've been able to go around the country. 
But I think the most promising thing I've discovered, 
not necessarily a change brought from my release, is the 
UNESCO | the new Courier | April 2003 
 
  
  
  
  
tremendous support of young people and the sense of 
solidarity between different ethnic nationalities of Burma. 
How important is the ethnic coalition for you? 
» Oh, it is most important; it is the most important thing. 
Because Burma is a Union, it is a country made up of many 
different ethnic nationalities, and unless we can achieve 
true solidarity we shall never be at peace. What we need is 
a system of a federal nature that takes into consideration all 
the aspirations of different nationalities. As I said just now, 
I found there was tremendous solidarity among the ethnic 
nationalities when I visited the states of Shan and Arakan. 
The welcome that I received from the general public there 
was most heart-warming and very, very encouraging. So I 
think we are moving very steadily towards true solidarity. 
What are the next steps? 
» The next steps are to achieve dialogue. I think we’ve got to sit 
down and to talk over matters important to this country with 
the SPDC. (The ruling State Peace and Development Council) 
What is the current human rights situation in Burma? 
>» We still do not enjoy the basic human rights as spelled out 
in the United Nation Declaration of Human Rights. 
What about the situation of political prisoners? 
» They have been number of releases of political prisoners, 
but there are still hundreds of such prisoners behind bars.

One of our demands is that they be released unconditionally 
as soon as possible. 
How are negotiations for their release progressing? 
>» We have not had any negotiations. 
What are the main needs of Burma in terms 
of education and culture? 
> In terms of education we need a lot of things. I'm 
especially concerned about tertiary education because too 
many young people are leaving school uneducated. The 
whole system needs to be revised. With regard to culture, we 
are made up of many ethnic nationalities, as we discussed 
earlier, and it’s very important that we try to preserve the 
different cultural strands in this country. Democracy will 
give everybody a chance to make their contribution to the 
development of educational and cultural matters. So what 
democracy does is to provide people with an opportunity 
to freely use their talents for the sake of the country. I 
think there should be flowering of cultural and educational 
institutes, organizations, activities. 
What do you answer to the people who say that 
the human rights are a western concept, not relevant 
in Asia? 
» My answer is to ask: are Asians not human beings?

education a commercial service that can 
be traded like any other? Yes, says the 
S World Trade Organization, which, through 
its General Agreement on Trade and Services 
(GATS), recognized education as a tradeable 
commodity in 1995. No, say angry academics and 
student groups around the world, who, fearing 
the “McDonaldization” of education, are radically 
opposed to the idea. 
Fuelling this passionate debate has been the 
explosive growth witnessed in the international 
trade of education services over the last decade. 
Higher education and specialized training, 
especially have become big profit-spinners for 
private or corporate providers, and a much 
needed source of income for cash-strapped 
public universities and institutions suffering 
from declining state-budgets and ever-increasing 
numbers of students. 
According to the OECD, the higher education 
market in its member countries is conservatively 
worth some $30 billion annually. In 1999 there 
were 1.47 million foreign students studying in 
tertiary education in OECD countries, an increase 
of more than 100,000 over 1998. Education

as a means of filling the gap, and accelerating 
the development of national university systems. 
In China, for example, 36 percent of higher 
education students are enrolled in private 
institutions. In Poland, which had almost no 
private institutions in 1989, there are now more 
than 180, providing courses for third of the 
country’s student body. According to a series 
of case studies prepared by UNESCO, such new 
providers account for 55 percent of all “new” and 
“very new” universities in Jordan, Sudan, Tunisia 
and Yemen, while in Kazakhstan 70 percent of all 
universities are private. 
HORSE-TRADING 
While few would criticize the vastly increased 
access to education that such developments seem 
to offer, many consider that “horse-trading” 
education will have disastrous consequences. 
They want it withdrawn from the list of 12 
services covered by the GATS. Iberian and Latin 
American academics, who signed the Porto Alegre 
Declaration of 2002, maintain that it will lead 
to “deregulation of the education sector with 
the removal of legal, political and fiscal quality 
controls”, and fear “drastic public financial 
support cutbacks.” The British Association of 
University Teachers adds that it will also threaten 
job security, professional autonomy and status, 
academic quality, and will have a negative impact 
on academic freedom, intellectual property rights 
and access to education. The National Union of 
Students in Europe believes that “the concept 
of the student as a consumer and education as 
a product fails to acknowledge the importance

of education as a social tool and runs counter to 
the creation of a knowledge-based society, with 
democratic, tolerant and active citizens.” Their 
Canadian counterparts argue that “it is time to 
protect the essential role of this public service, 
not to subordinate education to market forces, 
undermine its accessibility, and exacerbate social 
inequalities.” 
Other GATS observers dismiss these claims 
as unfounded. Pierre Sauvé of the OECD 
describes the agreement as “arguably the most 
development-friendly of all Uruguay-Round pacts” 
and believes that “it is not likely to be a driving 
force or even a major consideration behind 
changes” already occurring in the education 
sector. “Governments,” he says, “can use the 
GATS selectively to encourage investment in 
sectors of their choice, subject to the conditions 
they wish to impose or retain [...] the agreement 
also permits governments to maintain foreign 
ownership restrictions in sectors where they

### 130038: Borderless education

AX Contvovevsial Yebate 
FOR 
Pierre Sauvé, who works in OECD's Trade Directorate, says increased trade in higher education can help everyone, starting 
with developing countries that do not have the resources to meet all their students’ needs. 
What are the benefits of commercializing higher education? 
Technological advance allows us to spread knowledge further, so it makes sense to think about how we can maximize the 
possible benefits especially since we've long known that investment in human capital goes hand in hand with economic 
development. So we should be glad to see increased trade in higher education. However, for the past few years, it seems 
to have become almost impossible to utter the word “trade” without setting off loud protests. We should remember that 
trade enriches nations. The mobility of students, teachers and ideas can be important in bringing cultures closer together. 
The problem is that the North seems to have much more to gain than the South... 
But would the countries of the South be better off if we didn’t allow their young people to study at the best Western 
universities? Some developing countries just don’t have enough money to provide the training their citizens need. A 
number of African countries have agreed to privatize education within the framework of WTO because they want to see 
foreign suppliers set up operations in their countries to add to the amount of education provided by local private or 
government suppliers. 
  
But isnt there a risk of making education too uniform? 
Policies exist to avoid this. For example, an Indonesian law that requires education to be given in this or that language can 
be extended to foreign suppliers of education. So it's mostly a matter of regulation and local political choice. Nobody's 
forcing WTO member states to make any commitment in the field of education and if they do, they're free to use local 
suppliers. 
AGAINST 
Nico Hirtt, a Belgian teacher and essayist, attacks privatization of universities as ensuring dominance of the Western educational 
model and widening social inequality. 
How has higher education changed in the past 20 years? 
Economic interests are now exerting great pressure on public services to adapt to their requirements. Schools are being 
asked to be more flexible so as to respond faster to the demands of the labour market. At the same time, government 
funding, on which universities mostly depend, has fallen. 
What part does the World Trade Organization play in all this? 
The commercialization of education is going to happen however the negotiations turn out. Decisions at an international 
level will simply accompany the trend. Market forces will lead the way. Preparatory meetings before the 1999 Seattle 
Summit showed how few obstacles there are to this liberalization. The only real brake to it is the issue of international 
recognition of diplomas. 
What could be the medium-term results of this liberalization? 
The danger is a “McDonaldization” of higher education, with the spread of a single formula and copy of the Western 
model. Faced with increased competition, universities are tempted to invest in subjects that are going to be most 
profitable for them, to the detriment of less profitable ones such as human sciences. They will also be tempted to move 
more and more towards doing research that pleases their funding sources. In the future, parents will have to spend a 
greater part of their income on their children’s education and that will only increase social inequality. 
So what's the answer? 
We can't resist this trend if we just stick to education because all the most human aspects of our societies are being 
commercialized. It's a worldwide battle we have to wage against the excesses of economic modernization.

greater predictability (but not irreversibility) of 
commitments, a potentially important element in 
attracting investment in developing countries.” 
UNESCO’s main concern is to ensure that global 
higher education standards do not fall victim 
to the rigours of the market. “Quality is the 
issue,” says Stamenka Uvalic-Trumbic, the head 
of UNESCO’s Section for Access, Mobility and 
Quality Assurance. “The Organization has long 
encouraged the internationalization of education 
and the involvement of a range of partners - both 
public and private. But we must also protect 
students from inadequate learning resources, 
low-quality provisions, degree mills and bogus 
institutions. 
“The fast developments of the knowledge 
society demonstrate that globalization, 
particularly the globalization of higher education, 
is irreversible and cannot be stopped. It can, 
however be tamed through regulation and policy 
coordination.” 
To this end, UNESCO has set up a Global Forum 
on International Quality Assurance, Accreditation 
and the Recognition of Qualifications in Higher 
Education. It’s task is to establish an international 
quality assurance framework and a code of good 
practice for providers of higher education. Its first 
meeting last October set the agenda. A second 
meeting to be held in Oslo (Norway, May 26-27) 
will further develop the Forum’s plan of action. 
The Forum will also look at ways of updating the 
six existing regional conventions dealing with 
recognition of qualifications and ratified by 130 
UNESCO Member States, and which could serve 
as a counterweight to the GATS (see box p.13). 
“The Forum serves as a complement to GATS, 
not a rival,” explains Ms Uvalic-Trumbic, “and 
provides a place where people and institutions 
involved with higher education can debate the 
issues from a wide range of perspectives - not 
just that of the market place - and decide what to 
do about them.”

\ a village lying under the snow 
Tens On, in the region of Kiruna, northern 
Sweden: a television crew from Discovery Channel 
is filming a short documentary about the Saami 
(see box p. 20). Outside, the temperature is -33°C, 
freezing both people and movie cameras. Only 
Anna, 18 years old, is in her element. Pouring all 
her teenage energy into defending her “difference,” 
this young Swedish woman is the star of the hour. 
“The first thing I'll pass on to my children? 
The Saami language.” Anna doesn’t bat an 
eyelid before answering. On the surface, she is a 
teenager like any other: her life revolves around 
snowboarding, her boyfriend and the American 
pop-rock group Foo Fighters. But deep down, she 
feels that she has something else, that many of 
her school friends don’t. 
“It’s a feeling that grows with time. The more 
the years go by, the more I feel like speaking 
Saami and following my uncle and his reindeer 
into the mountains. Living close to nature gives 
UNESCO in action culture 
An 18 year-old Swede from 
Lapland, fights to save her culture 
and her language, one of 
the most threatened in Europe 
you incredible strength.” For Anna, being Saami is 
a bonus, a passport for a life that breaks with the 
ordinary. “I have my Swedish life, like everyone 
else, and an extra life as well.” 
Anna lives with her parents in Gallivare, a 
mining town located north of the Arctic circle. 
“I'm lucky, because my parents always told 
me where I came from and sent me to a Saami 
school.” Along with Swedish and English, she 
learnt to read and write in her mother tongue, 
which her mother and grandmother only know 
how to speak. She also discovered how to yoik, 
the art of singing traditional melodies with 
modulations evoking the wind, which once 
carried performers into a trance. For several years 
now, she has sung in public at Saami festivals. 
PROUD OF HER HERITAGE 
Often, on weekends, Anna travels 80 kilometres 
to visit her maternal grandmother Ellen Maria, 
who lives in Rensjon. With this feisty 77-year 
old, Anna learns how to make traditional objects 
in reindeer skin or multicoloured threads. She 
loves listening to her grandmother’s stories about 
the past, recounted without nostalgia but with 
a definite sense of pride: a nomadic childhood 
governed by the rhythm of reindeer herding,

all the reindeer starved to death, the trading of 
“milk against meat” with Finns settled in the 
region, and finally, the move to a more sedentary 
lifestyle, access to modernity and basic comforts.

J traddling bovders 
Some 60,000 to 
100,000 Saami 
(also written Sami), 
an indigenous people 
formerly known as Lapps, 
live dispersed across 
four countries: Finland, 
Norway, Sweden and 
Russia. Their territory 
came under the Swedish 
crown in the early 16th 
century before being 
divided between Sweden, 
Russia and Denmark a 
century later. In 1996, part 
of Sweden’s Laponian 
area, where a nomadic 
lifestyle marked by 
the seasonal rhythm 
of reindeer herding 
prevails, was inscribed on 
UNESCO's World Heritage 
List. 
“We are the only 
wild white people in 
the world,” jokes an 
ironic Lars Anders Baer, 
president of Sweden's 
Saami Parliament, 
underlining that “the 
majority, 40,000 to 70,000 
people, live on Norwegian 
territory.” It is estimated 
that 15,000 to 20,000 
Saami live in Sweden, 
around 5,000 in Finland 
and 2,000 in the Kola 
Peninsula (Russia). 
The Saami language 
is generally classified in 
the Finno-Ugrian family, 
bearing similarities to 
the languages of the 
UNESCO | the new Courier | April 2003 
Baltic Sea like Finnish 
and Estonian. But there 
are in fact several Saami 
tongues, often bearing no 
resemblance with each 
other. Spelling can also 
vary from one language to 
the other. 
The UNESCO Atlas 
of Languages in 
Danger lists 11 Saami 
languages, of which 
one is “extinct” (Kemi 
Saami), four are “nearly 
extinct” (Pite Saami, Ume 
Saami, Ter Saami and 
Akkala Saami), five are 
“seriously endangered” 
(Inari Saami, Skolt Saami, 
Kildin Saami, Lule Saami 
and South Saami). Only 
one is listed in the simply 
“endangered” category: 
North Saami, spoken by 
80 to 90 percent of the 
Saami who still speak their 
language - about 30,000 
people - living in the four 
countries concerned. 
Lars Anders Baer 
asserts that an effort 
“to harmonize linguistic 
policies adopted in the 
four concerned countries” 
is necessary to save the 
Saami language. But in 
doing so, there is a risk 
of killing variants that are 
currently spoken by no 
more than a few hundred, 
or even a few dozen 
people.

Extinct language: no speakers are left 
the Saami in Sweden: too tough and not lucrative 
enough, she says. Unless they own more than 
400 animals, reindeer herders have a below 
average living standard and must round off their 
months by working in the mining industry or in 
the tourism business. 
But Anna is sure of one thing. She will continue 
living in Sdpmi (previously known as Lapland) 
and defend her language and the rights of her 
small minority. Today, Sweden counts some 
15,000 to 20,000 Saami, accounting for less than 
0.25 per cent of the country’s population. Even in 
their own region, where temperatures can drop to 
-50°C, they only represent between five to ten per 
cent of inhabitants. The others are mostly miners 
from the southern part of the country lured by 
opportunities in important iron ore deposits. 
Traditionally a people of hunters and fishermen, 
the Saami became nomadic herdsman towards 
the end of the Middle Ages. They lived through 
dark hours from the 16" to the mid-20™ century: 
their lifestyle and customs came under attack and 
their traditional territory split between several 
States (see box below). Colonization, taxes, 
Christian missionaries and the persecution of 
traditional Shamans, forced labour in the mines, 
the prohibition to use their language and express

are ashamed of it, says Anna. “Some don’t even

According to many 
linguists, the world loses ten 
languages every year. More 
than half the 6,000 languages 
spoken in the world are, to 
various degrees, threatened by 
extinction. Worse, the erosion 
of linguistic diversity is gaining 
speed, under the impact of 
migration, restrictive linguistic 
policies and the pressure of 
dominant languages: English 
is an obvious culprit, but 
Russian, French, Arabic and 
Chinese also deserve mention. 
A community's language is 
considered in danger when at 
least 30 percent of its children 
have ceased to learn it. 
When a language dies, a 
whole world vision, thought 
patterns and original concepts 
also disappear. In its quest 
to promote cultural diversity, 
UNESCO has taken up the 
cause of dying languages. The 
Organization first undertook 
the task of quantifying and 
documenting the phenomenon 
by producing, in co-operation 
with renowned academics, 
an Atlas of the World's 
Languages in Danger of 
Disappearing. A study is 
underway to evaluate the 
number of speakers of each of 
the 3,000 threatened languages. 
Such a publication, 
widely publicized by the 
media, contributes to public 
awareness. UNESCO also

works with the scientific 
community to study certain 
languages. It has just launched 
an initiative in Georgia to 
record, transcribe and codify 
three endangered languages 
(Abkhaz, Bats and Laz) in order 
to produce online grammars 
and vocabulary data bases. 
UNESCO also encourages 
multilingualism in schools. 
The Organization believes that 
all students should “begin 
their formal education in their 
mother tongue.” With its 
Initiative B@bel programme, 
UNESCO also supports 
multilingualism in cyberspace, 
where English counts for more 
than half of contents and where 
very few minority languages 
have visibility. 
UNESCO's action in favour 
of linguistic diversity 
recently led to an agreement 
with Discovery Channel, 
supported by the UN Works 
programme. This partnership 
aims to sensitize public 
opinion and the media to 
dying languages. It led to 
the production of spots on 
endangered languages: 
nine two- to five-minute 
documentaries were aired on 
International Mother Language 
Day, celebrated last February 
21. The television channel is 
expected to produce up to fifty 
other mini-documentaries on 
the topic.

Lars Anders Baer, the president of the Sametinget, 
the Swedish Sami Parliament 
in the Sametinget (Sweden’s Saami parliament),” 
she asserts, regretting that two thirds of the Saami 
don’t take this opportunity. This parliament, 
which has an advisory capacity to the government 
according to its president Lars Anders Baer, 
was set up in Kiruna in 1993, several years after 
those in Norway and Finland. It is the result 
of the birth, after World War Two, of a Saami 
movement, which gained strength in the 1970s, 
echoing the affirmation of other indigenous 
peoples around the world. 
In recent years, Mr Baer admits, Sweden’s 
Saami people have scored points on the cultural 
front, even if he feels the government does not 
invest enough money in promoting the language. 
Today, Saami children have the right to be 
educated in their mother tongue, although few 
follow this route. The most motivated attend the 
six bilingual schools in Sapmi’s cities. According 
to the European research network Mercator, the 
number of students in these schools rose from 115 
in 1994/95 to 170 in 2000/01. Some 180 children 
spread across other schools in the country benefit 
from an “integrated Saami education” as part of

the general curriculum. Other children take Saami 
as an option. If they wish, they can continue in 
high school and university. 
LAND RIGHTS 
The environment is slowly changing. National 
school curricula are starting to speak about the 
history of minorities in the country. Some media 
are introducing Saami programmes, albeit in small 
doses. On the legislative front, Stockholm ratified 
the European Charter for Regional or Minority 
Languages in February 2000. At the same time, a 
new law was adopted on the right to use Saami 
before administrative authorities and in court, 
a decisive step in the recognition of the Saami 
minority. 
The looming question of land rights remains. 
Unlike Norway, Sweden has not ratified the 
International Labour Organisation’s Convention 
169 concerning indigenous and tribal peoples. 
According to this text, these people must have 
the “rights of ownership and possession” of their 
traditional lands and be able to “participate in 
the benefits” of activities stemming from the 
exploitation of natural resources. For Anna’s 
father, Anders, survival depends on this: without 
economic autonomy that would notably enable 
his people to develop and modernize reindeer 
husbandry, Saami culture is condemned to 
disappear. “If you no longer need 400 words 
to describe the quality of snow or hundreds of 
others to designate different parts of the reindeer, 
you no longer need the language,” he says. “If our 
traditions die, our language will die.” 
Meanwhile, his daughter continues to sing. And 
the future will tell whether her yoik is a swan’s 
song to Saami culture or an ode to the Sun god of 
a reborn people.

Conservation and development 
form a natural alliance in 
UNESCQO’s biosphere reserves 
’s 30-year-old Man 
TIAN Ee JC Ons Biosphere 
(MAB) programme has always put both people 
and nature at the centre of its concerns. The 
original reserves aimed to reconcile conservation 
with the presence of people through a system of 
zoning, where a “buffer” zone and a “transition” 
area surrounded a “core” area with high 
conservation potential, shielding it from the 
destructive influence of a modernizing world. 
But, while the need for conservation is arguably 
greater today than it was when the first biosphere 
reserves were designated in 1976, the people 
who live in or near the reserves want to prosper 
economically. The challenge, then, is to square 
these potentially conflicting goals. 
Over the past decade or so, the MAB 
programme has been developing a range of 
initiatives to do just this. One approach is to use 
an area’s cultural heritage as a money-earner, 
through ecotourism ventures. Some 70 biosphere 
reserves are also UNESCO World Heritage sites. 
In the past, local people have often been chased 
out of cultural sites in an effort to ‘preserve’ them. 
And, of course, tourism can be either supportive 
of or damaging to the conservation goals of 
a biosphere reserve, depending on how it is 
managed. “UNESCO is not introducing tourism,” 
says Francis Childe, senior programme specialist 
in the Division of Cultural Heritage, which works 
closely with the MAB programme. “But tourism is 
coming. So the question is how to make sure that 
local communities are involved and in control.”

Cholpon-Ata’s 5000 
rocks drawings are 
in urgent need of 
protection. Several 
were destroyed 
to make way for the 
airport 
farmers and poor communities plagued by AIDS. 
Another recent initiative uses the sustainable 
practises of biosphere reserves as a guarantee of 
quality and fairness in local produce, whether 
handicrafts or food, through a system of quality 
labelling (see New Courier, October 2002, p.34). 
Meanwhile, supporting the traditional 
knowledge and practices of local people can 
contribute to conservation, while encouraging 
cultural diversity. For example, indigenous 
peoples from Ghana and India to South America, 
traditionally designate special natural areas as 
sacred, restricting what can be done there. After 
countless generations, these areas have become 
havens of genetically ancient biodiversity, in 
landscapes that have been changed radically 
by human intervention. On a different tack, 
traditional practices that, to western minds, seem 
to be destructive can, in fact, be the opposite. In 
Australia’s Uluru-Kata Tjuta Biosphere Reserve, 
the Aboriginal custom of patchwork burning of 
the landscape is now part of the management 
plan. Controlled burning, it turns out, can be an 
excellent way to conserve biodiversity in arid 
areas.

The evening sky as we turned our backs 
on Cholpon-Ata and its field of prehistoric rock 
drawings. Disco music blared out of the cassette 
player in Bolot’s brown Mercedes taxi as he rattled 
us between the Russian trucks on the old Chu 
Valley Silk Road back to Bishkek. “Zanzibar” 
and what sounded like “One-way chicken to 
the moon” had been thumping out for hours on 
end. Bolot only had one cassette and he insisted 
on listening to it. We didn’t want to spoil his 
concentration. 
When we’d arrived in Cholpon-Ata, on the 
north shore of Lake Issyk Kul, five hours earlier, 
Bolot was in a bad mood. We never found 
out why. He seemed just to want to dump us 
anywhere and have lunch. So, we persuaded 
him to drop us off at a little marina, past the 
President’s summer dacha, and negotiated a one- 
hour boat trip. The lake, which has something of 
Loch Ness about it, is over 180 kilometres long, 
60 km wide and 700 metres deep, at an altitude 
of 1600m. It is the largest alpine lake in Asia and 
the second largest anywhere. Last year it became 
the centre of Kyrgyzstan’s second UNESCO 
biosphere reserve. Looking south, we could see 
the snow-covered Tien Shan mountains forming a 
spectacular wall, with peaks rising more than 7000 
m. Beyond them is China. And, behind us to the 
north, the more modest Kungey Alatau mountains 
separated us from Kazakhstan - and Siberia.

A long cloud stretched out like a finger just above

perked up and was happy to follow our uncertain 
directions down a dirt track until, after a few 
false starts and mimed questions to locals, we 
found what we were looking for. Behind a purely 
symbolic 20m length of metal fence, a vast field 
opened up into the distant foothills, strewn with 
boulders. But these were no ordinary rocks. On 
their south faces, hundreds were inscribed with 
breath-taking bronze-age drawings of hunters, 
Siberian ibex, snow-leopards, horses and other 
animals. 
There is no tourist infrastructure here, so 
we were free to roam, as if we were the first to 
discover the site. In a couple of hours, we only 
found a few dozen of the 5000 or so petroglyphs. 
The only other people we saw were a shepherdess 
impatiently in the car, we had to hurry. Which 
is not what one wants to do in a treasure-hunt 
among drawings that are over 2500 years old. 
They were, we found out later, made by pre- 
Kyrgyz nomadic (Scythian) people. With a 
shamanic spiritual tradition, the hunters would 
probably have wanted to evoke the spirits of the 
animals and make peace with them. 
ECOTURISM PROJECTS 
The Soviet legacy in Kyrgyzstan was sometimes 
a heavy one, with radioactive waste from local 
uranium mines dumped in the mountains. But the 
more remote countryside is stunningly beautiful 
and unknown to tourists. While ecotourism 
ventures are sprouting up, sometimes with 
and a gaggle of 12-year-olds. And they’d come

public and private organizations. For wealthy 
landowners, the biosphere reserve label serves as 
a certificate of excellence to attract tourists. 
It also represents a life-insurance policy for 
both sides. Just a few hours north, Zimbabwe 
reels as misery and political manipulation fuel 
violent land seizures. At Waterberg, there is no 
trace of aggression or threat. And the residual 
mistrust that remains is starting to fade as the two 
communities work to improve livelihoods, thanks 
in large part to the energy and vision of a few 
individuals. Of diverse origins and outlooks, they 
represent the essential components required for a 
successful biosphere reserve: conservation, socio- 
economic development and cultural heritage. 
OUT OF AFRICA 
“Just 12 or 15 years ago, people in Bakenberg 
would flee when I arrived wearing a ranger 
uniform,” recalls Clive Walker, one of South 
Africa’s most famous conservationists, who 
spearheaded the biosphere reserve’s creation. 
Instead of avoiding the district, Walker returned, 
which isn’t altogether surprising. He is not your 
average white landowner but a man with a rhino 
parked in his garden, an orphan he raised with 
his wife at their home in Lapalala Wilderness, 
a private game reserve unlike the others in 
Waterberg. 
Instead of stepping ‘Out of Africa’, visitors dive 
in at Lapalala, where environmental preservation 
and education are the main attractions. For 
years, Walker has been working with landowners 
to reintroduce rhino species into the area, 
while directing a nature school for mostly poor 
pupils. But at Bakenberg, Walker realized that 
conservation had to go beyond the pristine areas 
of private lands. Rivers were running dry because 
of soil erosion through overgrazing. It was just 
a matter of time before these problems spilled 
across the entire watershed. 
Thanks to Walker, conservation has become 
a cornerstone at Waterberg. Now the biosphere 
reserve’s new chairman, Rupert Baber, is adding 
his own expertise in economic development. 
After completing a doctoral dissertation on South 
Africa’s poverty at Oxford, Baber returned to the 
farm his family has worked in Waterberg, since 
1886. This is a place where children are born and   UNESCO | the new Courier | April 2003

“We don’t want to create another project, but 
a business,” says Lesiba Masebe, the grandson 
of a legendary chief, who is a now a respected 
teacher in Bakenberg. Walking through the dirt 
lanes of his village, he proudly points to the 
new hall for local craft production built by the 
biosphere reserve committee before outlining 
plans to set up cultural visits, including bush 
walks with local guides, consultations with 
traditional healers as well as banquets and dance 
performances organized by local troupes. With 
pride, Masebe dreams of creating a ‘traditional 
African village’ not just to amuse foreigners but to 
teach children about their cultural heritage. As the 
local mayor, Godfrey Molekwa, half-jokes, “sex is 
the only cultural activity for youth.” Many are just 
awaiting the day they will leave to work in distant 
towns. 
DISPOSSESSION 
To help break this cycle, the national government 
and the biosphere reserve committee are starting 
a new eco-tourism school, under the guidance of 
Clive Walker at Lapalala. The aim is to train local 
staff to work as guides, administrators, mechanics 
and managers while developing investment plans 
in the area. Various organizations will participate 
in this pilot project along with individuals like 
Elias Mangwani, a guide at Lapalala. 
Tread softly with Mangwani in Lapalala’s 
rhino territory, marveling at the animal tracks 
in the sandy soil but mindful of his warning 
to climb the nearest tree should one of these 
unpredictable beasts approach. Hiking to see 
ancient San rock art, he points to the berries his 
grandmother, a traditional healer, would boil 
to kill the hunger of a three-day trek. A small 
cut in the trunk of a latex tree and he offers 
“chewing gum” with the bittersweet taste of his 
childhood. Every Christmas, he would indulge 
in the “real thing”, a present from his parents 
who returned from the mines for a visit. Like so 
many Waterberg children, Mangwani’s family was 
forced to leave a farm. But under the watchful 
eye of his grandmother, he learned the ways of 
his land and ancestors, knowledge with which 
he forged his career. Now instead of just leading 
tourists, boasting of their ability to identify zebra 
dung, Mangwani will guide Waterberg’s youth, 
determined to regain their heritage after more 
than a century of dispossession.

### 130043: Memory of the world, the key to diversity

UNESCO in action communication 
Memory of the World, 
the Key to Diversity 
UNESCO established the Memory 
of the World (MOW) programme ten 
years ago to preserve and promote 
  
documentary heritage, much of 
it endangered. Yet this heritage is as 
important for humanity’s cultural 
diversity as the sites and monuments 
on UNESCO’s World Heritage List. This 
is why the programme launched the 
World Register of documentary heritage 
of universal value 
UNESCO | the new Courier | April 2003 
register includes the oldest 
The: surviving book produced with 
oveable type, the second of a 
two-volume set of a Korean “Anthology of Great 
Buddhist Priests’ Zen Teachings”. The Baegun 
hwasang chorok buljo jikji simche yojeol was 
printed in July 1377 in a temple in Cheongju. 
Also known as Jikji (from a phrase about the 
attainment of enlightenment by direct appeal 
to the mind), it was compiled by Priest Baegun 
when he was 75, and reflects the teachings 
of his instructor, Zen Buddhist master Seogok 
Cheonggong. 
The book is one of 68 documentary heritage 
properties from 33 countries inscribed on 
the World Register. Other entries include: the 
Gutenberg Bible (Germany), the first book to 
be printed in Europe and the earliest Bible ever 
printed; the Codex Techaloyan de Cuajimalpaz 
(Mexico) whose pictorial material and Nahuatl 
text describe how indigenous communities 
were established in various places in the Valley 
of Mexico City; the Dainu Skapis Cabinet of 
Folksongs (Latria); and the Archives of the 
Warsaw Ghetto. The Register gives us an idea of 
the enormous variety of documentary heritage 
around the world worth preserving because of its 
enduring importance to scholars and because it 
testifies to cultural achievements that have had a 
far-reaching influence. 
MORE THAN A PAPER HISTORY 
“Our purpose is not conservation for its own 
sake, but conservation in order to make this 
heritage more accessible,” argues the head of 
the MOW programme Abdelaziz Abid. Giving 
publicity to this heritage helps to attract resources 
for preservation. Digitalization through scanning, 
posting the collections on the Web and producing 
CD-Roms makes these documents accessible to a 
huge number of people without subjecting them 
to physical stress. Oblivion, on the other hand, 
leads to neglect, says Abid. 
In 2001 the futuristic masterpiece Metropolis, 
by German film director Fritz Lang, became the 
first feature film on the Register. The inscription 
prompted numerous screenings and helped give 
a new lease of life to the work, according to 
Abid. He also says that publicity events around 
the inscription helped raise awareness of the 
importance of film preservation in general. 
Also on the Register are the 4,000 or so 
recordings of the Vienna Phonogammarchiv, the 
first sound archive ever created (1899), featuring 
ethno-linguistic and ethno-musical material 
collected by anthropologists all over the world. 
This material bears testimony to many cultures 
which have since disappeared or been deeply 
changed by Western influences. 
The director of Phonogrammarchiv, Dietrich 
Schiiller, who is also the chairman of the 
International Advisory Committee of MOW, 
explains that no single institution anywhere can 
claim to preserve enough material in any one 
field. The MOW programme, he explains, aims to 
convince tax-payers and politicians around the 
world that more effort, and a better distribution 
of labour is needed to preserve the testimonies of 
the world’s cultures.

Asian Documentary 
H exitane 
Asia has an ancient 
tradition of archival 
preservation, as 
exemplified by the Hor 
Tri Klang Nam (or Tri 
Pitaka Pavilion) at Wat 
Yai Suwannaram in 
Petchaburi, Thailand, 
and by Janggyeong 
Panjeon, also known 
as Tripitaka Koreana, 
at the Haeinsa 
Temple in Korea. 
Both libraries are 
outstanding examples 
of traditional mastery

parameters. Both 
ensured that their 
collections remained 
dry; well ventilated 
and protected from 
excessive light. The 
Thai library was built 
on stilts in a lake 
for protection from 
rodents. 
UNESCO | the new Courier | April 2003 
Traces of the rich 
library traditions 
of Asia can also 
be found, in India, 
Laos and Myanmar, 
according to Guy 
Petheridge, who 
has high praise for 
the Preservation of 
Lao Manuscripts 
Programme operated 
by the governments 
of Laos with funding 
from Germany. Laos 
has a rich documentary 
heritage with surviving 
literary works dating 
back to the 15th 
and16th centuries, 
many of which are yet 
to be studied. However, 
neglect over decades is 
taking its toll on tens of 
thousands of religious 
texts, learned and 
literary writings about 
history, traditional 
law and customs, 
astrology and magic, 
mythology and ritual, 
traditional medicine 
and healing, grammar 
and lexicography, as 
well as poetry and a 
huge number of verse 
epics and folktales. 
These manuscripts, 
written on palm leaf 
or mulberry paper, are 
stored in traditional 
wooden caskets in 
the traditional library 
structures in some 
1,700 Buddhist wats or 
monasteries all over 
the country.

HEAVY LOSSES LOOMING 
“Much of the material stored in research 
institutions will disappear within the next 50 years 
and great losses have already been incurred,” 
argues Schiiller. “Eighty percent of audiovisual 
documents in the anthropological field, dialects, 
musical festivals etc. are not kept in archives 
proper but in collections attached to research 
institutions and museums. Their analogue 
documents are still playable, but many of them, 
and increasingly so, are chemically unstable 
and sooner or later all magnetic tapes we have 
will deteriorate to a point they will no longer be 
playable. Another problem is that the old replay 
machines are about to disappear and then, even if 
you have the best-preserved collections, you will 
not have the machinery to play them. Unless there 
is concerted effort country by country on a grand 
scale to digitize this material, the knowledge we 
have today — especially in the fields of social 
and cultural anthropology, will fade away.” We 
stand to “lose 80 percent of what we have in 
the anthropological field,” he insists, explaining 
that “generally speaking, the more modern the 
support, the less stable it is, a wax cylinder 
recording lasts longer than a magnetic tape or 
CD-Rom.” 
Similarly, old paper is more stable than the 
acidic wood pulp paper introduced in the mid- 
19th century. Acidic paper poses a problem for 
collections of 19th and 20th centuries printed texts 
and manuscripts, particularly those situated in 
countries in transition, in Eastern Europe and the 
former Soviet Union where most of the printing

was done on the cheapest paper, says Guy 
Petheridge of AusHeritage, network in Australiaé, 
who has carried out an evaluation of the MOW 
programme. 
Institutions in developing countries are hard 
put to pay for scanning technologies now used 
by Western libraries and institutions to save 
threatened material. There have recently been 
reports in the press about the sorry state of one 
of Argentina’s largest print media libraries, the 
José Hernandez Library in Buenos Aires where 
110 years of Argentinean newspapers are rotting 
away, victims of the economic crisis that has hit 
the country. 
INDIGENOUS DOCUMENTARY 
HERITAGE 
Documentary heritage is a nearly universal 
phenomenon, with properties worth saving in 
places not generally known for their written 
culture. Thus, four sets of Philippines syllabaries 
of the 10th century AD, the Philippines 
Paleographs, are on the Register. They represent 
articulate sounds and remain in use to this day. 
“There is a western assumption that indigenous 
people only have oral traditions”, says Petheridge, 
and “when the first Spanish navigators arrived 
in the Philippines, they were amazed by the fact 
that here were people who were not credited 
with the nobility of the writing tradition, merrily 
writing away. This was also the case in Sumatra. 
We have records of systems going back to the 
7th or 8th centuries AD but which may be older. 
The Bataks in northern Sumatra still preserve 
the tradition of writing complex divinatory 
manuscripts. In the Philippines a couple of 
hunter-gatherer populations are keeping that 
script alive.” 
The preservation of this documentary 
heritage should help us appreciate the wealth 
of humanity’s cultures and the programme’s 
usefulness - especially its endeavours to digitize 
material - becomes all the more apparent when 
considering the huge losses that have already 
been suffered over the past century such as the 
destruction of some of the most precious books 
and manuscripts preserved in Germany when 
a flood hit the cellars of the former Royal and 
Bushmen women in 
Botswana listening 
to R. Poch’s recording 
of their singing in 
1908, the photograph 
and recording 
are part of the

of anthropological 
documentary material

The Growing Up In Cities (GUIC) 
project aims to get young people involved 
in running their neighbourhoods. 
No easy task, especially for adults...

“BB A C lk were fleeing the centre of 
Frankston, a suburb 
of Melbourne on Australia’s southern coast. The 
city centre had been taken over by drug-dealers, 
addicts and beggars and was seen as a violent 
and dangerous place. The whole city, where 
nearly two-thirds of the residents are under 40, 
had a bad reputation. 
Last December, Frankston staged a grand 
opening of its new Safer City Centre, a joint 
town and police effort that broke new ground in 
Australia. The scheme, which made headlines in 
the national press and received the full backing 
of the local people, was the most visible example

of the hard work by the city’s leaders to fight the 
lawlessness and insecurity. 
It was achieved with the help of a team from 
Growing Up In Cities (GUIC), a UNESCO project 
aimed at getting youngsters involved in improving 
their environment (see box). 
VICTIMS OF VIOLENCE 
AND BOREDOM 
GUIC came to Frankston in 1998. What it 
found were young people who said drugs and 
violence were the main problem, restricting their 
movements and the time they spent in the streets. 
They also said they were very bored. 
At the urging of GUIC, the city council set up 
a Youth Safety Management Team in 1999 as 
one of four elements of an overall security plan. 
Its 15 or so members, aged between 16 and 19, 
asked for, and got, more police patrols to chase 
away the drug-dealers. They also saw that public 
toilets were equipped with special bins for used 
syringes and the annoyingly dim ultra-violet 
lighting (to discourage the addicts) changed. They 
got classical music piped in the streets and the 
railway station was painted and better lit. 
At their skateboard park, they had a fountain 
repaired and a hole in the fence mended, to 
stop skateboards shooting out onto the road by 
accident. The municipality has also set up a Drug 
and Alcohol Action Plan, with a section for youth. 
Bit by bit, the town centre has been revived and 
the spirit of regeneration has spread to the rest of 
the town.

The ability to listen 
is one of the most 
critical skills 
for a successful 
participation 
programme 
       
     
The city council said it was pleased with the 
scheme. “We often refer to the GUIC report and 
it’s still important for finding out about growing 
up in Frankston. It’s given us a very solid 
foundation to work from,” says Geoff Cumming, 
53, the city’s amenity services manager, who has 
pitched in to help the young citizens. 
The youngsters themselves are less sure, 
and say the experience has sometimes been 
frustrating. Amy Lee, 21, who used to chair the 
Youth Safety Management Team, says one of the 
biggest challenges is changing adult perceptions 
and stereotyping of young people. 
Last year, the council disbanded the team, 
saying it had become hard to “recruit and 
maintain a connection with young people.” Scott 
Duncan, 20, who joined it when he was 17, 
said youngsters had been discouraged because 
“decisions were not being acted upon.” 
But youth participation has taken root and 
young people are on the new Community Safety 
Management Team. They include Scott and Amy, 
as well as Helen, 19, who has been helping to run 
  
her city for the past four years and says she has 
gained a lot from the experience, especially “more 
maturity than many of my friends. I've seen the 
political side of things, I’ve learned how to run 
meetings and I've learned from working with 
people older than me.” 
Scott attends the new Team’s weekly 7.30 
a.m. meeting and is cautiously optimistic. “The 
process might be flawed but we can make it better 
and already have,” he says. 
YOUNG PEOPLE EXPERT ADULTS 
TO KEEP THEIR WORD 
GUIC launched another such project in the 
South African suburb of Canaansland, near 
Johannesburg, in 1996 and children and young 
people enthusiastically took part in the survey to 
find out what they most needed, such as running 
water, toilets, better health-care, a study centre 
and an enclosed sports field. The town hall 
backed the scheme and projects for youngsters 
began to be drawn up. 
But one bright morning, the slum’s 10,000 
inhabitants were brutally evicted by property 
developers and transferred to Thula Mntwana, 
a settlement 40 kms from Johannesburg, where 
they had to build new shacks. The change was 
dramatic. Many adults lost their jobs because they 
now lived too far away, water came in trucks at 
unpredictable times, and sanitation hardly existed.

“It's often said 
today’s cities are 
built for middle-aged, 
middle-class men in 
cars, but more and more 
of the world’s children 
are growing up in cities 
and their metropolitan 
surroundings,” says 
Louise Chawla, 
an environmental 
child psychologist 
who is International 
Coordinator of the GUIC 
project. 
In 1995, she proposed 
to UNESCO the revival 
of a research project 
done in the 1970s by 
an American urban 
planner, Kevin Lynch, on 
how children and young 
people lived in cities, 
with the aim of getting 
decision-makers to 
take notice of what the 
youngsters suggested. 
Today, the Growing Up 
In Cities (GUIC) project 
has been implemented 
in several places, 
including Melbourne 
(Australia), Buenos 
Aires (Argentina), 
Johannesburg (South 
Africa), Oakland 
(United States), 
Bangalore (India), 
Trondheim (Norway), 
Warsaw (Poland) and 
Northampton (United 
Kingdom). 
Lynch's methods have 
persisted. Researchers 
UNESCO the new Courier April 2003 
from local universities 
interview children and 
young people, get 
them to draw their 
environment and to 
talk about what they 
would like to see and 
follow them up in 
their neighbourhoods. 
Then it is for the local 
authorities to meet the 
challenge - or not. 
These efforts are 
the subject of a 
book, Growing Up in 
an Urbanising World, * 
edited by Chawla. 
Despite greatly varied 
backgrounds, children 
and teenagers talk about 
their ideal surroundings 
in a surprisingly similar 
way. 
What they appreciate 
—- or would appreciate — 
above all is feeling 
accepted and valued, 
feeling part of a close 
community, in an 
environment with lots 
of places to meet and 
where they can move 
around easily and safely. 
On the contrary, they 
suffer most when they 
feel sidelined, rejected 
and bored (especially 
in rich countries), fear 
violence and experience 
a lack of basic services. 
That's the theory. 
The practical part 
is in a “manual for 
participation” that David 
Driskell has written 
for urban planners, 
mayors, social services 
departments, etc. 
Called Creating Better 
Cities with Children 
and Youth, * it draws on 
solid experience in the 
field to show how to get 
young people involved 
in community policy- 
making. It deals with 
all aspects, including 
how to choose projects, 
conduct interviews or 
train city officials. 
Town planners in 
Sweden, Lebanon, 
Jordan and Venezuela 
are now imitating the 
project. Canada and 
several Arab countries 
are also considering 
such schemes.

However in 1999, with help from supporters 
from the North, GUIC managed to build a 
children’s centre and playground. A video was 
also made about the settlement’s children 
(see box). 
Today, Thula Mntwana’s youngsters are 
despondent and dream of having a library and 
computers. The playground needs repairing, 
though that does not prevent the youngest born 
happily playing there. The only organizations 
that use the youth centre are two church 
congregations. The local authorities have not 
followed up the scheme. The only thing planned 
at the moment is the surfacing of the road. 
But things are moving forward on another 
level. At the town council’s request, GUIC’s 
representative in South Africa, Jill Kruger, has 
© Melinda Swift 
just done a report on living 
conditions for children in four 
depressed neighbourhoods of the 
town. And last December, she 
organised workshops to find out 
what children thought for the 
Gauteng provincial government’s 
Programme of Action for Children. 
“The children explained their 
problems and made suggestions 
about how they could take part,” 
she said, “and provincial officials 
have promised this will happen.” 
DIFFERENT TIME-SCALES 
But the children of Thula Mntwana may not 
know that and, anyway, they don’t function on 
the same time-scale as the town’s officials. This 
gap is one of the major obstacles to genuine youth 
  
participation in local development. 
The project worked in Frankston, says Karen 
Malone, its coordinator and director of GUIC for 
the Asia-Pacific region, because its leaders were 
really committed to the scheme and immediately 
agreed to the teenagers’ request to set up a special 
Youth Committee. 
David Driskell, who heads GUIC in India, says 
the focus must be on modest material goals, 
such as the study centre set up for children in 
Bangalore, and on teaching decision-makers to 
genuinely listen to the young. 
This is not something you can tke for granted,” 
he says. “Knowing how to listen is something that 
must be learnt, and to this end, GUIC has given 
us some valuable lessons.”

Remembering 
Cambodia's Genocide A metlel communications 
A documentary 
by Cambodian 
filmmaker Rithy 
Panh, “The Khmer 
Rouge Killing 
Machine” will 
be screened next 
April in Paris. Co- 
produced by UNESO 
and the French 
audiovisual institute 
(INA), the film 
evokes the 
Cambodian 
genocide. 
Rithy Panh, 
who lived 
through Pol Pot’s 
dictatorship, firmly 
believes that a 
society’s collective 
memory can be 
constructed from 
the individual 
recollections of 
both victims and 
killers. As such, 
the documentary 
presents wrenching 
testimonies 
involving survivors 
and former Killers

Prizes for Peacemakers 
In the course of 2002, UNESCO 
awarded several prizes to honour 
the work of individuals and 
citizens engaged in defending 
human rights and peace. 
Aung San Suu Kyi of Myanmar 
was named laureate of the 
UNESCO-Madanjeet Singh Prize 
for the Promotion of Tolerance 
and Non-Violence on October 4 
for her unrelenting and peaceful 
struggle to establish democracy 
in Burma. This $100,000 prize 
was created by the Indian writer 
and diplomat Madanjeet Singh, 
who is also a 
UNESCO Goodwill 
Ambassador. 
Xanana Gusmao, 
president of East 
Timor, became the 
2002 laureate on 
October 9 of the 
Félix Houphouét- 
Boigny Peace Prize, 
worth 122,000 
Euros. A hero of 
East Timor’s freedom movement, 
Mr Gusmao was arrested by the 
Indonesian army in 1992 and 
held in jail until 1999. 
On November 12, the Mexican 
Academy for Human Rights 
was awarded the 2002 UNESCO 
Human Rights Education 
Prize. Founded in 1983, the 
organization has played a key 
role in Mexico’s democratisation 
process. It has notably been 
involved in training and 
establishing a national network 
of ombudsmen.

UNESCO has just published 
a specialized course book 
entitled “Communication 
Training in Africa: Model 
Curricula”, available 
in English and French. 
Communication students 
from this region usually 
use foreign textbooks that 
are poorly adapted to the 
current social, political and 
economic context, as well 
as to local cultures. The 
cost of these books is also 
prohibitive, preventing their 
large-scale distribution. 
UNESCO hopes that 
this model curriculum, 
available free of charge on 
  
the Web (*), will become 
a reference and set new 
standards for training 
African communication 
specialists.

No to human eloning 
A criminal act or a 
charlatan’s stunt? The 
announcement of the first 
cloning of a human being 
at the end of 2002 by a 
publicity-hungry sect did 
not convince the scientific 
community. But it did 
provoke a wave of shock and 
outrage around the world. 
The Director-General of 
UNESCO Koichiro Matsuura 
condemned “such criminal 
practices, which we can only 
regard with disapproval and 
dismay.” He recalled Article 
11 of the UNESCO Universal 
Declaration on the 
Human Genome 
and Human Rights, 
which states that 
“practices which 
are contrary to 
human dignity, such 
as reproductive 
cloning of human 
beings, shall not 
be permitted.” 
Mr Matsuura 
added “there can 
be no progress 
for humanity in 
a world where science 
and technology develop 
independently of all ethical 
imperatives. I therefore 
solemnly request political 
leaders in every country and 
the international scientific, 
intellectual and juridical 
community to cooperate 
in taking all appropriate 
measures, at the national 
and international levels, 
to respond as swiftly as 
possible to these challenges, 
which are a threat to the 
irreplaceable uniqueness of 
the human being.”

Towarils 4 tleclaration on 
genetie data 
The ninth session 
of UNESCO’s 
International 
Bioethics Committee 
(IBC) took place 
in Montreal last 
November 26-28, at 
the invitation of the 
Canadian government 
and with the support 
of Canada’s National 
Commission for 
UNESCO. During 
the meeting, the IBC 
worked on the outline 
of the International 
Declaration on 
Human Genetic Data, 
prepared last year by 
an IBC drafting group. 
The text, which 
was modified to take 
into account the 
recommendations 
made in Montreal, 
is now being 
widely circulated 
for discussion. This 
global consultation 
will culminate next 
June with a meeting 
of governmental 
experts. If all goes 
well the draft will 
be submitted for 
adoption to UNESCO’s 
General Conference 
which is due to take 
place at the end of 
this year. 
During the 
Montreal meeting the 
IBC elected Canadian 
former deputy health 
minister Michele 
Jean as its new 
chairperson. It also 
debated a number 
of other issues 
including: pre- 
implantation genetic 
diagnosis and germ- 
line interventions; 
and predisposition, 
susceptibility and 
genomic research; 
what implications for 
the future? 
The Committee also 
discussed the possible 
preparation of a 
universal instrument 
on bioethics. 
  
Science without eonfitlence 
The widespread belief in 
the benefits of science 
went unchallenged for 
a long time. For many, 
science held the solution 
to the world’s problems, 
from feeding humanity, 
to ensuring good health 
for all and such like. 
This is no longer the 
case. Doubts have taken 
hold, and the direction 
taken by science - from 
the atom to genetically 
modified organisms - is 
increasingly contested. 
How then can we 
restore the trust between 
society and science? 
Such was the theme of 
a Youth Forum held on 
December 3, organized 
by the UNESCO’s 
World Commission on 
the Ethics of Scientific 
Knowledge and 
Technology (COMEST) 
and the Palais de la 
découverte (Paris), where 
the meeting was held. 
Four young scientists 
from Norway, Sweden, 
The Netherlands and 
France discussed trust 
in science and scientific 
freedom to an audience 
of students from several 
schools. The Forum was 
held parallel to two-day 
working meeting of 
the COMEST, of which 
Norwegian professor 
of mathematical logic, 
Jens Erik Fenstad, is the 
current chairperson.  [Sal

iteracy is freedom, according to the Brazilian philosopher Paolo Freire, 
but for hundreds of millions of the world’s poorest people the 
opposite is also true: illiteracy is a tool of oppression. 
It means, for instance, that corrupt local officials in drought-stricken 
eastern India can withhold rations from poor farmers in favour of 
their own cronies, because the farmers can’t read the official list of 
beneficiaries; or that divorced women and their children in rural villages 
of Bangladesh are left to starve when their husband leaves them, because 
they havent been able to register their marriage, so can’t claim their right 
to a share of the family home. 
Today an estimated 861 million adults including 140 million 15-24 
year-olds worldwide are illiterate, despite literacy being recognised as a 
human right more than half a century ago. Of course, there is much to 
debate about how illiteracy is defined in different countries. But there is 
widespread acceptance that if we are to live in a world where every man, 
woman and child can fulfil their potential as free human beings, illiteracy 
must be tackled. 
The most powerful engine of change is the worldwide commitment to 
achieve Education for All by 2015, made at the World Education Forum in 
Dakar, Senegal, in 2000. 
Providing a good primary education to every child is the key to 
preventing today’s children becoming tomorrow's new generation of 
illiterate adults. But the international community has so far failed to offer 
more than a token gesture towards the Dakar promise that no country 
seriously committed to achieving Education for All would miss the goal 
for want of resources. 
Without more funds, countries that abolish school fees, for example, 
will struggle to prevent a mass intake of pupils being matched by 
plummeting quality of learning as pupil:teacher and pupil:textbook ratios 
shoot up. The United Nations Literacy Decade (2003-12) can contribute by 
focusing attention on the need to ensure that rising levels of literacy are 
achieved alongside rising enrolment. p>

“i ie. 
D> Schools are only part of the solution, however, because a 
massive number of adults and youths have never been to 
school and huge numbers of children who do go drop out 
before they have learned to read and write. 
The record of formal adult literacy programmes shows 
that new ways of learning literacy and creating lasting 
literate environments need to be developed if the target of 
halving adult literacy is to be achieved. 
This means having flexible lesson and course completion 
times, learning material tailored to the learner's interests 
and culture, teachers or facilitators trained and supported 
in using active learning methods, and learners having a 
say in the running of their own education. Above all, as is 
shown in three very different and successful programmes 
documented in this report — the people’s centres in 
Bangladesh, a Reflect programme in Orissa, and a slum 
school in New Delhi - it involves learners consolidating 
their literacy by putting it to use in the most dynamic of 
ways: tackling the causes of their own poverty, challenging 
injustice and improving life in their community.

In some countries, notably the former communist 
states, the gains of the past decades may even be 
lost as resources for education fall back. In many 
African countries millions of new teachers will 
be needed to deal mostly with rising demand for 
education, but also to offset considerable losses to 
the profession from the AIDS pandemic. 
And in states emerging from severe internal 
crises, such as Afghanistan and East Timor, it is 
challenging enough to deal with the short-term

needs of reopening and rebuilding damaged schools 
without having to think of longer-term goals. 
A UNICEF study in 1998 predicted that illiteracy 
rates could even grow during the 21st century after 
declining dramatically during the 20th. Several other 
agencies have been similarly pessimistic saying that 
famine, conflicts and natural disasters have created 
huge refugee populations where children receive 
little or no schooling for long periods. 
According to UNESCO’s statistics, nearly one in 
seven of the world’s six billion people cannot read 
or write. This represents a considerable advance on 
the first survey of world illiteracy published in the 
1950s when 44 per cent of the world’s population 
was found to be illiterate. 
Women and girls make up two-thirds of illiterate 
people, although the gender gap is narrowing, and 
recent figures show that women are even gaining 
access to education and literacy at a faster rate than 
men. The trend is most evident in Africa where the 
percentage of illiterate women over the age of 15 
fell 6.4 per cent over the past decade to 49 per cent. 
Even so, the number of illiterate people is far too 
high - they are invariably from the poorest, most 
marginalized sections of society. 
UNESCO's first progress report since the World 
Education Forum is sobering: more than 70 countries 
will not achieve all the Dakar goals which include 
access to free schooling of acceptable quality for 
all children of primary school age, the elimination 
of gender disparities in schooling and a halving of 
adult illiteracy by 2015. 
Some 28 countries were not expected to achieve

any of the three essential goals, two thirds of them 
in sub-Saharan Africa, but also including India and 
Pakistan. Other high-risk countries include several 
North African and the Arab states. Some central 
and eastern European nations are even moving 
backwards from previously high rates of literacy, as 
early childhood education in particular is cut back, 
and funding for education overall reduced. 
Worldwide, 78 countries are unlikely to halve adult 
illiteracy rates. They include four of the world’s 
most populated countries: Bangladesh, China, India 
and Pakistan which alone account for 61 percent of 
the world’s illiterate adults. 
Moreover, even those countries that appear to 
be on target will not be able to reach these goals 
without substantial foreign aid. The World Bank 
has attempted to quantify the amount of financial 
assistance required, particularly in Africa. It 
estimates a minimum funding gap of US$2.5 billion

years. The Bank notes that in countries such as 
Rwanda, Malawi and Zambia incremental costs due 
to HIV/AIDS will increase recurrent budgets by 45 
percent. These figures have been issued at a time 
when both bilateral and multilateral aid to education 
has been declining. 
However, even poor countries have shown that 
where there is the political will, much can be 
achieved. Cuba was able to mobilize nearly 270,000 
adults to reduce illiteracy from 23 to 3 percent 
within a few years of Fidel Castro’s 1959 revolution. 
More recently, Haiti, with a 52 per cent illiteracy rate 
has opened thousands of centres to teach Creole and 
reduce illiteracy to 25 percent by 2004. 
But the challenge remains daunting. To achieve 
universal primary education by 2015, more than 15 
million new teachers will be needed - three million 
of them in sub-Saharan Africa alone - requiring 
massive investment in teacher training. Developing 
countries are also having a hard time even hanging 
on to trained teachers, many of whom are being 
poached by richer countries to cover their own 
shortages. 
NO COUNTRY IS IMMUNE 
TO FUNCTIONAL ILLITERACY 
In many of the world’s richest countries where 
free universal primary and secondary education is 
widely seen as having wiped out illiteracy, nearly 
a quarter of the adult population is incapable of 
understanding and using information contained 
in brochures, instruction leaflets for household 
appliances or medicines. 
No country, including many with decades of 
universal public education in place, is immune to so-

Jail breakevs 
In the world’s 
wealthiest nation, 
the United States, an 
estimated 70 percent 
of the more than 
two million-strong 
prison population 
lack the reading skills 
to navigate many 
everyday tasks or hold 
down anything but a 
menial job, according 
to a National Adult 
Literacy Survey. 
With legal means of 
succeding in society 
narrowed, illiteracy 
is heavily implicated 
in the crimes landing 
many behind bars in 
the first place, says 
Raul Romero, Assistant 
Superintendent of 
Correctional Education 
in California, where 
half those incarcerated 
are illiterate. 
San Quentin, near 
San Francisco, home 
to 6,000 men including 
nearly 600 awaiting 
execution on Death 
Row, is considered 
California's best-served 
jail educationally, with 
three classrooms, 
ten instructors and 
a shifting cast of 
volunteers. Many 
inmates slipped 
through the academic 
net because they didn’t 
respond to traditional 
teaching methods, says 
education chief, Jean 
Bracey. Accordingly, 
staff deploy “language 
experience” 
techniques, asking 
inmates their life story 
and teaching them 
the words in it. “They 
learn quickly because 
it's meaningful to 
their life,” explains 
Bracey. To break the 
cycle of illiteracy, they 
are taught children’s 
stories to read to their 
kids during visiting 
hours. For external 
validation and positive 
reinforcement, 
certificates are 
awarded at ceremonies 
in the prison chapel, 
to which prisoners’ 
families are invited. 
San Quentin is 
hardly a nurturing 
environment for 
learning, though. 
Education-minded 
prisoners must cram 
on bunks in cramped, 
shared cells amid a 
raucous din, enduring 
frequent lockdowns 
confining them to 
their cells for weeks 
on end and forgoing 
pocket money they 
might otherwise earn 
from manual labour. 
Moreover, Bracey 
reckons she can only 
reach ten percent 
of inmates with the 
resources at her 
disposal. 
Some motivated 
prisoners beat the 
odds, however. Niiboye 
Annan, 24, put himself 
through classes he 
missed as a 14-year 
old dropout, earning 
a school-leaving 
certificate. 
Literacy isn’t only 
the cornerstone of 
education and learning 
marketable vocational 
skills, it's a vehicle for 
personal growth, he 
says. “I thought, ‘I'm 
from the streets, all | 
can do is sell dope,’ 
Now | realize I'm a man 
with skills | can use.” 
Annan credits his 
success to Patrick 
Mims, chairman 
of Project Reach, a 
cadre of 23 inmate 
tutors formed to pass 
on the benefits of 
learning. Mims, 40, a 
 
self-professed former 
“street hustler”, 
serving 15 years to 
life for second-degree 
murder, earned a two- 
year college degree by 
correspondence. He 
has clout with inmates 
because he’s one of 
them, showing what's 
possible if they apply 
themselves. 
Mims recalls helping 
Kermit Johnson, 37, 
who was struggling 
with writing in his 
literacy classes. “I 
asked him to write an 
essay about his shirt. 
Next, | showed him 
how you set an essay 
up and said, ‘Now write 
about your jacket.” Now 
he’s realised he can 
doit.” 
A recent US education 
department study 
found that prison 
education programmes 
reduced recidivism 
by 29 percent. But in 
California, America’s 
largest penal system, 
just two percent of the 
annual budget is spent 
on education. That's a 
“false economy”, says 
Bracey.

called functional illiteracy —- when people have either 
lost or never properly acquired adequate reading 
and writing skills necessary to function in present 
day society. In the case of the richest countries, it is 
a chilling indictment of school systems. 
The extent of functional illiteracy in rich countries 
only came to light in the mid-1990s as a result of 
the International Adult Literacy Survey, a 22-country 
study of 16-65 year olds conducted by the OECD. It 
found a clear gap between educational attainment 
and skills. But more revealing was the number of 
older people who, having learnt basic reading and 
writing skills at school, had lapsed into illiteracy 
because they did not use their skills in a way that 
was relevant to them. 
Definitions of literacy have changed over the 
years, from being unable to read and write in any 
language, to completion of five years of compulsory 
schooling. Now it is thought that to fully function 
in today’s complex society, six to eight years of 
schooling is the absolute minimum. 
However, the high functional illiteracy levels in 
countries where 12 years of compulsory schooling 
exists suggest that a more reliable measure of 
acquisition is needed.

) 120 pupils are huddled 
together in a classroom built for 40. 
Most are seated on the floor, their knees supporting 
exercise books, because there are not enough desks. 
The teacher, Jane Onyango, has no chalk to use 
on her splintered blackboard, so she is dictating 
science notes to her pupils. Like schools throughout 
the country, Ayany has been swamped since the 
new government dramatically fulfilled its election 
pledge to abolish school fees on January 7. 
The road to Education for All is rocky and pitted 
with potholes, and nowhere more so than in sub- 
Saharan Africa. Forty percent of the estimated 115.4 
million children out of school worldwide live in this 
region, the only one in which primary enrolment 
has actually fallen in the past ten years. 
 
Poverty caused by foreign debt repayments, 
poor investments, protracted civil wars, misplaced 
priorities, corruption and poor governance has 
resulted in a relentless decline in public spending on 
the school system. 
But there has been no loss of desire among the 
people for the benefits that literacy and wider 
learning can bring, as the new Kenyan government 
discovered on January 7, when almost 2.5m new 
pupils showed up for school. Primary enrolment 
shot up to 8.7m. Schools that usually admitted 160 
pupils each year suddenly had to deal with more 
than 3,000 applicants. 
At Olympic Primary School in Nairobi, where 
5,000 hopeful pupils turned up, riot police had to be 
called in to restore order when teachers told parents 
there was no more room.

from the failure of societies to

do abolish school fees and make the massive 
investment in teachers, classrooms and books 
required to shore up the quality of education as 
pupil numbers soar, it may not be enough to ensure 
that every pupil learns to read and write. 
This is because state education systems in many 
developing countries have scarcely developed 
pedagogically from those established by former 
colonial powers. They are invariably geared to the 
needs of the ruling (male) urban elite, rather than 
the very different lives of the masses of rural poor; 
and teaching often has more in common with army

from the board, than an attempt to exploit a child’s

natural creativity and curiosity about the world as a 
route to learning. 
This has made many schools a place to fear 
rather than a joyful learning experience, providing 
an additional reason, beyond poverty, why children 
should drop out of school. 
A number of education programmes have shown 
how governments can improve learning among 
the rural poor without a significant spending hike, 
giving them the realistic prospect of being able to 
scale up the improvements across the country. 
One of the biggest and longest lasting examples is 
the Escuela Nueva (new school) model that began in 
Colombia in 1975. It was eventually scaled up across 
more than 20,000 schools, and its creator, Vicky 
Colbert de Arboleda, was appointed education vice 
minister. 
The model has since been replicated in a host of 
countries — including Brazil, Guatemala, Nicaragua, 
Chile, Uganda, Guyana and the Philippines - with 
varying degrees of success. 
Similarly, Save the Children, an NGO, has been 
working for ten years with the Chinese provincial 
government in Tibetan Autonomous Region to 
raise standards in marginal populations by bringing 
in child-centred learning techniques. So far the 
Chinese authorities like what they see and a 
second programme has been established in Yunnan 
province. 
KEEPING KIDS IN SCHOOL 
The Escuela Nueva programme was designed for 
multigrade rural schools with just one or two 
teachers — which account for four out five schools 
in rural Colombia and are common in the least 
developed or most isolated communities of many 
developing countries. 
Previously the children were learning so little and 
the system of evaluation was so rigid that many 
pupils who had to take time off, for instance to 
help with the harvest, would repeat and repeat and 
eventually drop out. 
“We started with demonstrative schools that

## [Page 51](130036eng.pdf#page=51) 0

### 130049: The Pleasure factor

gave teachers a new role and materials designed 
for this type of learning,” said Vicky Colbert. “We 
brought in flexible promotion, active participatory 
and co-operative learning with children working 
in small groups. We spent time building skills 
of citizenship and democracy. We had strong 
community participation and we made sure the 
schools respected the different learning rhythms of 
the children.” 
The pupils study independently or in groups 
using self-learning and co-operative group-learning 
guides. These combine a core national curriculum 
with regional and local adaptations made by the 
teachers. Evolved from activity cards, they are a 
textbook, active learning exercise book and teachers’ 
guide rolled into one. Teachers are initially trained 
at the demonstration schools and build on their 
techniques once employed by attending practical 
workshops and sharing ideas with their peers at 
monthly meetings at local centres where they collect 
their pay. “Self learning is the key,” said Colbert. 
“The teacher’s role is to help those who are not 
understanding.” 
In tests after the model had been extended to 
more than 8,000 schools, Escuela Nueva pupils 
outperformed control group pupils in Spanish, the 
official national language, at grades three and five 
by 19 and 8.5 percent respectively. 
At the same time the number of pupils dropping 
out or repeating years was significantly reduced. By 
1993 this was a $3.5 billion a year problem in Latin 
America and the Caribbean, where nearly one in 
three primary pupils were repeaters and only half 
the fourth grade pupils taking state tests were able 
to understand what they read. 
The Save the Children methods have a lot in 
common with those promoted by Escuela Nueva. 
“In most schools in the world you see children 
sitting passively, brain dead, never moving, never 
asking questions,” said Marion Moreno, a global 
education advisor for Save the Children-UK. “In a 
Save the Children class you will see them actively 
engaged, playing games to learn things, talking, 
moving about - and their learning shoots ahead.” 
In Tibet, in partnership with provincial govern- 
ments and the British Department for International 
Development, Save the Children introduced child- 
centred learning methods in municipality schools in 
the snow-blown mountain valleys north of Lhasa, 
where previously two out of three children dropped 
out before completing nine years of education. 
Teachers are given 16 days’ training in 
questioning, group work, using games in the

they see and feel. 
Bolonos reminds 
students of a story

prompts them to

aids. Children are encouraged to learn, investigate, 
experiment and articulate their discoveries. 
Save the Children evaluations in Tibet show 
the approach can markedly improve exam results 
without requiring investment in vast numbers of 
extra teachers. 
“Training teachers in being affectionate and 
child friendly costs just a short training course 
and it keeps children in school,” Moreno said. “So 
there is a big untapped potential for working with 
governments to change the system.” 
However, the attempt to scale up the Escuela 
Nueva innovations across rural schools in Colombia 
shows how difficult this can be. 
The 500-school pilot project was extended to 
3,000 schools between 1978 and 1986. Then, 
following the landmark decision by the government 
to make primary education compulsory and free, 
the target was raised to cover all 27,000 rural 
schools by 1992. But, during the upheaval caused 
by a concurrent national decision to federalize 
government, teachers were transferred on a massive 
scale and in many areas training slipped back into 
the traditional model, or the new learning materials 
did not arrive. 
Colbert left the ministry to set about reviving the 
model through the Volvamos a la Gente (Back to 
the People) foundation, this time using partnerships 
between people, government and businesses. With 
coffee grower associations funding innovations 
including in information technology, and the state 
paying for materials, she focused on five regions to 
form a centre of excellence backed by these alliances. 
Since then the recovery has gone from strength to 
strength. An international comparative study of 11 
Latin American countries carried out by UNESCO 
in 1998 found Colombia was the only one in which 
results in rural state schools were better than their 
urban counterparts. The World Bank selected 
Escuela Nueva as one of three education reforms in 
the world that had demonstrated success on a large 
scale. And Vicky Colbert was named as one of Latin 
America’s top 20 social entrepreneurs in 2002 by the 
Schwab Foundation. 
“If you change the method and have the right 
materials, teachers can tackle a larger number of 
pupils,” Colbert said, “and with the money saved 
you could even pay them more.”

### 130050: The Language barrier

  
The 
language 
barrier 
Dramatic inroads can be made 
on illiteracy by offering bilingual support 
to minority language children 
3 A pupils at North 
eco n A VY Westminster community 
school in inner London face a barrier to learning 
literacy that is familiar to hundreds of millions of 
minority children the world over - the language they 
are learning to read in is not their mother tongue. 
“Seventy percent of our intake speak English as an 
additional language (EAL), and 60 percent of these 
are at the very early stages of English acquisition,” 
said literacy coordinator Frank Monaghan. 
This means that they do not have enough English 
to follow lessons and must be helped by a bilingual 
classroom assistant. 
Research has found that pupils learn more 
English if they attend normal classes with special 
EAL assistants — of which there is a severe shortage 
- rather than removing them for special language 
lessons as was common in the 1980s. 
Even now some of North Westminster's 2,000 
pupils - often new arrivals from troubled regions 
such as Iraq, Afghanistan Somalia and the Balkans 
- need special support outside the classroom. Large 
numbers arrive at secondary school illiterate even 
in their mother tongue and another 12-15 percent

Left: At North 
Westminster 
community school 
in London, bilingual 
teacher's assistants 
help children who 
don’t have enough 
English to follow 
lessons. 
Above: Theatre 
rehearsals at the 
same school 
have suffered a disrupted education that puts them 
many years behind what they would normally be 
achieving even in their own countries. 
“Withdrawal” for non-English speakers “was 
a slippery slope,” said Dr Monaghan. Pupils lost 
the vital link with their peer communities and 
many, particularly the younger ones, began to lose 
their own language while not properly mastering 
the new one, sending them into a spiral of 
underachievement. 
But with 40 languages spoken at the school, 
some of them by only one or two pupils, bilingual 
assistants are only a partial solution. Instead 
North Westminster makes as much use as it can 
of “partnership teaching” where a mainstream 
subject teacher and a qualified teacher specializing 
in English as an additional language jointly plan 
and deliver lessons. Partnership teaching, pioneered 
in London 15 years ago is being copied in other 
countries with diverse minority groups with some 
success. 
An estimated 476 million of the world’s illiterates 
are speakers of minority languages — many of them 
with no written form - in countries where schooling 
takes place in another (often colonial) language. 
However, in many such countries bilingual 
programmes with initial teaching in the mother 
tongue have helped children become literate in both 
languages. 
Research has shown that learners can generalize 
the skill of reading and writing in the mother tongue 
to any other language the learner speaks. 
In one project run by Save the Children in 
Mali, children start to acquire skills in their own 
language (Dogoso) and switch to French after a 
year or two. “Quite a few children who attend these 
schools are doing much better than children who 
attend ordinary state schools where French is the 
medium of instruction from the outset,” says Marie- 
Madeleine Savitzky of the London Language and 
Literacy Unit at South Bank University. 
In Peruvian Amazonia, where illiteracy was 
once the norm, 15,000 pupils speaking 28 different 
indigenous languages have benefited from the 
region’s 600 bilingual schools. Pupils whose mother- 
tongue is an indigenous language and who attended 
bilingual programmes, all finished with a mastery 
of Spanish beyond that of mother-tongue speakers 
of a similar ability and social background who 
had attended a school where Spanish was the only 
medium of instruction, a 1987 study found. 
Bilingual programmes particularly make sense 
in countries where speakers of diverse indigenous 
languages far outnumber speakers of the majority 
language. 
But raising literacy skills worldwide means 
tackling the problems of minority language groups 
wherever they occur.

### 130056: New frontiers

New frontiers 
United Nations Literacy Decade, 
J— in February, and 
Gr by UNESCO, will focus 
on reducing the number of adults and youths who 
cannot read and write. 
These are the people whose national education 
systems have failed to reach, despite literacy being 
recognized as a human right more than half a 
century ago. 
“It is a scandal that this right continues to be 
violated for such a large proportion of humanity,” 
said Ayogi Shigeru, chief of literacy at UNESCO. 
The decade will bring to the fore the current 
debate about what exactly illiteracy is, how it can be 
measured and how it should be tackled. 
The new thinking as espoused by adult literacy 
experts such as Alan Rogers of Nottingham 
University and David Archer, head of education at 
ActionAid, an NGO, is that it is the continuing use 
of literacy that should be measured rather than its 
acquisition at one point. 
They also advocate removing key barriers to 
learning such as the imposition of alienating 
teaching methods or even alien literacies on people 
by their own societies. 
For instance, a significant obstacle to both 
literacy and development for the poorer non-English 
speaking people in Orissa, eastern India, is being 
lifted by the state government’s decision to abolish 
the use of English in government forms used to 
apply for drought rations and low-income subsidies. 
Instead they will use the state language, Oriya. 
Increasingly government donors and aid agencies 
are tying literacy programmes to the eradication of 
poverty, rooting learning in the use of literacy in 
activities critical to people’s lives, to maximize their

motivation and the impact of the skills acquired. 
There is also a growing recognition that learning 
and texts must be adapted to the particular needs 
and interests of individual villages. 
“Governments and teachers, literacy facilitators 
and project managers, should all think seriously 
about providing learner-centred tailor-made learning 
that is sensitive to the culture and language of the 
learners,” said Aoyagi. 
Similarly, schools targeting children in the poorest 
communities, where parents may be illiterate and 
children are often needed to work during the day, 
can adapt their timetable and methods to surmount 
the obstacles to children attending lessons. 
An international plan of action on literacy has 
been drawn up by UNESCO for the Decade with the 
aim of achieving the international goal set in 2000 of 
raising literacy rates by 50 percent by 2015. 
With the Food and Agriculture Organisation, for 
example, UNESCO launched a flagship programme 
last November to promote basic literacy in 
AEWR

rural areas where learning is linked to people’s 
livelihoods as a tool to acquire and use knowledge 
on health, income-generation, small-scale credit, the 
empowerment of women, environmental degradation 
and other issues the learners want to pursue. 
UNESCO has promoted this model in a host of 
Asian countries, including Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, 
Indonesia and Thailand. “These are multi-purpose 
learning centres that provide helpful education to 
villagers, where they can learn at any time, at any 
level according to their needs,” Aoyagi said. 
Through the Asia Pacific Programme of Education 
for All, UNESCO is providing know-how on how 
to establish CLCs, design teaching methods and 
curricula, and train local learning facilitators 
(guides). 
The aim is to show donors that CLCs can produce 
tangible results and that, because they are owned 
and run by and for the community they serve, they 
can become self-sustaining.

Ten years ago, Hira explained, she and her

on smoke from cooking on an open fire, and awoke

as a share-cropper working rented fields. 
Today Moslem still earns the same amount 
working the land, every inch of which is cultivated 
in this densely populated area. 
But Hira now earns 4,000 taka a month by 
using skills she picked up in a new style of literacy 
programme that is making inroads where traditional 
adult learning programmes have failed. 
Six years ago a non-governmental organization 
called Dhaka Ahsania Mission started classes in 
her village. They allotted a room in the house next 
door to Hira’s for people to meet and called it 
Ganokendra (The people’s centre). Soon her women 
friends were asking her to come along. 
It was a big step to take. The women in her village 
were not allowed out, they could not meet strangers 
even if they visited their homes and most had never 
been to school. 
“By tradition we could not even pronounce our 
husband’s name,” said Hira. 
When she asked permission from her husband, 
who could barely pen a signature himself, he threw 
up his hands. “What will happen by reading all 
these books?” he asked. 
But these were not ordinary books and the classes 
were not like at a school. 
The NGO opened membership of the Ganokendra 
to representatives of the 250 poorest families out of 
the 311 families in the village - those earning less 
than 2,700 taka (US$47) a month - and ensured that 
75 percent of them were the most disadvantaged 
members of those families: women. 
The classes concentrate on literacy, numeracy, and 
subjects relevant to the learners’ lives. These might 
include how to: reduce sewage pollution of water 
supplies by using latrines, stave off deforestation by 
planting useful trees, and make fuel-efficient ovens 
to use less wood and reduce smoke in the house. 
There is training in skills that could bring in an 
income such as needlework, gender development 
education to secure for women a say in the running 
of the village, and leadership training to make 
community action more effective. 
“Education can transform their whole life,” 
said Shuelie Aktar, 24, the local facilitator - a 
guide, rather than a teacher, who is paid 1,000 
taka a month - at the Baniyar Kandar’s Twilight 
Ganokendra, which Hira attends. “It’s not only 
important to them, it’s important to their children, 
because they will send them to school.” 
There is also a strong emphasis on social 
mobilization on issues such as education rights, 
fighting child trafficking and child marriages, and

anti-drugs awareness and support work. 
“We don’t just give literacy only,” said Shuelie 
Aktur, who has a master’s degree in management. 
“We also provide cultural programmes and micro 
credit. Members make regular savings and from the 
central fund created they give loans to members to 
help them rear poultry, do tailoring or other small 
business activities.” 
At the heart of the literacy is flexible and co- 
operative learning and the creation of literature that 
Ganokendra members think will be useful once they 
can read. 
Inside the Baniyar Ganokendra, which is now 
housed in a building built by the local community, 
the walls are covered from ceiling to floor in 
awareness posters and charts related to local issues. 
About 15 women are practising reading exercises, 
such as completing word-making matrices, in their 
activity books. They are arranged in three groups 
according to their reading grade - five grades, A 
to E, which are determined every month. Grade 
A students can read a newspaper. Each of the 
low-grade groups are assisted by a member from a 
higher grade, who helps learners with any text they 
can’t understand. 
Fatema Khatun, 55, wearing a faded green shawl 
and cheeks full of laughter lines, didn’t go to school 
when she was a girl because of the social taboos. 
But she is an enthusiastic learner. 
“This Ganokendra has taught us lot of things. 
Now we can take care of our health and I'm an 
expert in making and using the unnatachula (a fuel- 
efficient oven with a chimney drawing the smoke 
out through a hole in the wall). I teach the others 
how to make them.” 
She said in an earlier adult education centre 
the whole class was taken by one teacher and the 
textbooks were too dominated by pictures and were 
too easy, but now they have group teaching.

UNESCO | the new Courier | April 2003 
A database of the titles and 
contents (www.ahsania.org.blrc) 
is being linked to UNESCO's Asia 
Pacific Cultural Centre, so that 
NGOs across the region can share 
ideas for materials. 
The books are graded to 
match different learner abilities. 
Ganokendra members can 
borrow them for nothing, though 
many centres charge two taka to 
generate funds to plough back 
into the community activities. 
The startling result is the 
creation of a literate environment 
in the villages, the lack of which 
has been a major cause of lapsing 
literacy among adult learners in 
other programmes. Without books 
and posters and signs, literacy 
may never be used in daily life 
and can be forgotten. 
“We are the largest producer 
of easy to read books,” explains 
Eshanur Rahman, deputy director 
of Dhaka Ahsania Mission. 
“Even BRAC (Bangladesh Rural 
Advancement Committee), the 
largest NGO in the world, uses 
our books.”

Her grade D group is being helped by a grade C 
16-year-old schoolgirl Somtto Bhan, who says it 
gives her good practice in reading. 
For Somtto the real attraction of the Ganokendra 
is the range of literature it gives her access to, 
including different types of books and newspapers. 
“There’s lots of things to learn in them,” she said. 
This is perhaps the unique contribution of the 
Dhaka Ahsania Mission’s Ganokendra work, which 
is based on a Community Learning Centre concept 
promoted by UNESCO throughout Asia and the 
Pacific over the past decade. Government adult 
literacy projects have been criticized in the past for 
using texts suited to urban middle class learners that 
don’t relate to life in rural areas. 
Radical projects such as the Reflect programmes 
inspired by ActionAid (see next story) use crude 
self-made texts, which are mainly representations of 
villagers’ analysis of various problems they face. 
But Dhaka Ahsania has found a third way, 
by creating a national resource centre that can 
respond to local interests. The subjects are chosen 
in response to surveys carried in the rural villages 
and are tested on pilot groups before being mass 
produced. 
Most of them are information books geared to 
awareness campaigns or particular skills or fields of 
knowledge that Ganokendra members say they want 
to know more about. But, crucially, they are not

Women from 
Rogaghurampur 
village, western 
Bangladesh, on their 
way to collect their 
monthly allowance 
for sending their 
children to school. 
The Ganokendras 
have created a 
literate environment 
in which school is 
valued 
  
written as dry manuals. Instead the information is 
imparted through stories about people carrying out 
the same tasks, making them an enjoyable read. 
Across Bangladesh more than 50,000 of the 
poorest people will this year be using Dhaka 
Ahsania Mission self-learning guides to learn how 
to read and write. After a five-month course and 
one month reinforcement learning at one of 800 
Ganokendras, they will reach out for the books, 
skills training and small-scale credit that will help 
them improve life in their community. 
A crucial factor in the success of the centres is 
that each one is run by a committee of members 
and comes together to discuss issues concerning the 
whole village. 
A survey of Rogaghurampur, a 100-household 
village of 450 people in Jessore district, where 
63 families had been active members of the 
“In the early days, 
many of the women who 
returned home late 
from classes were beaten. 
Now attitudes have 
changed completely.” 
Ganokendra since 1998, has documented the 
dramatic changes since the centre began its work 
(see table, far left). 
By December 2002, the percentage of families 
using literacy had more than doubled from 30 to 65, 
the number using latrines and fuel efficient ovens 
had soared; the practice of marrying children off at €h 
13 or younger had been wiped out with expected 
knock-on effects on the number and spacing of 
pregnancies; the role of women in decision-making 
and earning an income had been completely 
transformed and the percentage of girls going to 
school had jumped from 30 percent to 100 percent. 
The same kind of records have not been kept in 
Baniyar Kandar, but Hira’s new 60,000 taka home 
is just one example of the village-wide changes that 
have taken place. 
Hira built up a steady pile of savings from sewing 
work she developed at the Ganokendra and with 
the help of a loan was able to replace the mudhut. 
The spacious rough red-brick bungalow, complete 
with a brand new corrugated iron roof, has a broad 
verandah overlooking the courtyard where a carpet 
of pulses has been laid out to dry. 
In her bedroom the sleeping mat has been 
replaced by a wooden-framed double bed with 
a futon-style mattress and brightly coloured 
cushions. Poster adorn the walls and on the covered 
sideboard, in pride of place, is a television. Eighteen 
poor families in Baniyar Kandar now have a house 
like Hira’s and 100 have a television. 
But perhaps more significant is the ebullience 
and confidence of the women of the village, 
characterized by the fact that Hira did not have to 
think twice about inviting a group of outsiders to 
look around her family compound. Through her 
use of literacy she has liberated herself from the 
constraints of male-dominated traditions, as well as 
from many aspects of poverty, and now her husband 
asks her to borrow books for him to read. 
“In the early days, many of the women who 
returned home late from the classes were beaten. 
Men didn’t think we should leave the house for 
anything,” said Hira. 
“But now attitudes have changed completely. 
The status of women has been raised a lot. Now if 
someone says your wife needs to go for training in 
Dhaka, the husband will gladly agree.”

In Reflect programmes in India, learners are using literacy 
to challenge those who keep them poor 
Their

UNESCO | the new Courier | April 2003 
‘ four villagers have gathered on a 
Thi vty rug laid on the dusty earth in front 
of a thatched mudhouse in Bubel village, in drought- 
prone Orissa, eastern India. The women’s leader, 
Jangyabata Suna, rouses them from the fatigue of a 
day’s labour with a song about taking on the money 
men. “We can’t pay off all the bribes they demand 
of us, but we must stand on our own two feet,” 
she sings. “Rise up poor people of our country, we 
should not have to live like this.” 
It is a revolutionary movement, but their weapons 
are not the forks and cudgels of peasant revolts: they 
are homemade maps, matrices and flow charts, used 
to campaign for justice. 
These are “untouchables” or poorest-caste people 
who by tradition are shunned by other castes and 
forced to live in a separate quarter of the village. 
They used to accept their lot with grim fatalism, 
until a new type of development and literacy 
programme began in Bubel. The programme is 
called Reflect and is being run by NGOs, ActionAid 
and the India Rural Reconstruction Movement. The 
technique, which is being used by 350 organisations 
in 60 countries involves villagers analysing and 
taking collective action against the causes of their 
poverty. In the process literacy is taught and used 
as a key tool. it is the most radical example of the 
new thinking in adult literacy. The learning is geared 
very specifically to an immediate use they have for 
it. Here this means challenging officials who have 
exploited their illiteracy in ways that have kept them 
POO. 
“The literacy activity starts with the development 
of the people’s own plans in a way that demystifies 
the power of literacy,” says David Archer, head of 
education at ActionAid, “That shows it can be used 
meaningfully by people to assert their voices.” 
Typically a village facilitator helps create charts 
and matrices examining how a chosen issue affects 
participants. A village map, for instance, can be 
drawn in the soil with berries representing each 
person in each home, then copied, so that the

illiterate group members get used to the idea of 
encoding and representation used in writing. 
The facilitator then helps them analyze the key 
words from the discussion, breaking them down 
into syllables and looking at what other words 
could be made with these syllables. In Bubel the 
villagers went straight from planning to taking 
action, picking up literacy where it is useful as an 
aid on the way. But the ability to record information 
and read govenment documents are time and again 
proving critical in challenging local politicians and 
institutions to give them aid they are entitled to. 
Dhekel Singh Mona, the facilitator rolls out a map 
on the rug which depicts each road and house in the 
village and other buildings and services in coloured 
felt pen. One by one the villagers tell me how they 
have used literacy to claim their rights. 
“Before we didn’t know what we should know,” 
says group member Ayli Mona. “Day by day we 
came across new things, became aware of the 
outside world and what we should be getting - and 
now we are fighting for these things.” 
By drawing up the map and carrying out a survey 
of the 284 households in the village they found 
out which families were prone to suffering periods 
of great hunger when drought sets in. Using these 
figures they persuaded every family in the village 
to set aside a bowl of rice each day as a food 
contingency and have created a seed bank to help 
families whose stocks are wiped out. “We have 
drought every year, but now whoever is needy we 
are giving it to them,” explains Jangyabata. 
The survey showed that the 
102 families listed as below 
the offical poverty line and 
qualifying for ration cards 
were not all the poorest. A 
local politician had been 
handing out favours at the 
expense of those genuinely 
in need. By presenting 
their findings to the village 
assembly, they ensured 
deserving villagers could buy 
rice at a reduced price. 
A bigger battle was 
fought over the issuing of 
food supplies by the Public 
Distribution System after a 
serious drought two years 
ago, when the villagers found 
there was no grain for them at 
the local distribution point. 
A group of the women 
members went to protest to the panchayat 
(parish) leader, at one point setting on him in their 
desperation. When he claimed there was no grain, 
they took the matter to the Block (local district) 
Development Office, demanded access to the grain 
store records and found that grain had arrived in 
their name during the two months that they had 
been denied it, but had been falsely signed for. 
Now they are pursuing a case of corruption and 
demanding compensation. 
LITERATE WITHIN TWO YEARS 
Other Reflect groups are involved in conducting 
audits of how aid is spend in their community. 
A strength and weakness of the Reflect method 
is the heavy reliance on the capabilities of the P 
facilitators, who meet regularly to share ideas and f ous 
discuss issues that need wider mobilization. 
They are supplied with specialist materials such 
as a picture booklet about the rights of migrant 
workers, pamphlets about the rights of non-timber 
forest producers, a booklet on local government 
structures. 
Independent evaluation of pilot Reflect 
programmes in Bangladesh, El Salvador and 
Uganda, found that 60 to 70 percent of participants 
became literate within two years. This compares to 
World Bank findings that only 12 percent of adult 
learners become functionally literate in traditional 
programmes. 
Dhekel Singh Mona carries with him a chart with 
each member’s name and a list of skills against 
which they mark their own level of achievement. 
These include being able to listen, speak in a 
meeting, speak in a meeting of outsiders, read and 
write. For instance grade two writing means being 
able to make rough notes from dictation but not 
without mistakes. 
Eighteen of the group never went to school at 
all and six women can’t write their name, but that 
doesn’t stop them playing a full role because in 
meetings the literate members share the information 
with other members. 
Of 22 people listed on the chart, 15 can now read 
and write, but more significant is the use to which 
the skill is being put. Reflect member Shakan Bari 
says he forgot how to read because he never needed 
to after school, but now that documents are central 
part of their struggle in local elected assemblies it 
has become a part of his daily life.

Slum haven 
Schools for communities where 
children work can succeed if they adapt 
to the needs of the parents 
than 150,000 migrants live in the 
OY Ccovinpuri slums in south Delhi. 
Their homes are mainly windowless concrete 
rooms boxed on top of each other with no toilets 
or running water. They move into the city from the 
desert villages of Rajasthan and other nearby states 
to escape drought, and survive on about US$80 per 
family a month. 
Government schools have not adapted to the 
needs of children in this transient community. Many 
of them work in day time - in makeshift shops, 
collecting public lavatory fees, or delivering patties 
- and may disappear when the rains return. But if 
literacy is to spread in this giant of a country, where, 
in New Delhi alone, 4.5m children live on the street 
or in slums, these problems have to be tackled. 
Govinpuri’s Katha public school, set in former 
block of one-room dwellings, is showing how 
it can be done. Walk through the school’s iron 
gates and you can see a giant children’s mobile of 
planets overhanging a narrow courtyard, night blue 
skies glistening with gold paper stars on the tiny 
classroom walls, pre-school children testing an iron 
rocking machine to its limits in a play corner, and 
a harmonium and tabla drums being squeezed and 
patted in the theatre room while students act out a 
satirical play. 
The school is a haven of creativity and child 
friendly learning. It was set up by Katha, an NGO 
dedicated to promoting Hindu and tribal literature, 
and wherever possible subjects are taught through 
stories. The natural curiosity of children is what we 
encourage and the learning grows from that,” Katha 
founder Geeta Dhamarajan said. 
Yet when it first opened, parents were reluctant to 
send their children to school, because they needed 
them to work or help at home. Dhamarajan coaxed 
them in by setting up parent forums, so that local 
people feel the school is really theirs, can use the 
UNESCO | the new Courier | April 2003 
  
facilities and see just how good the school is. There 
is a creche so children don’t have to stay at home to 
mind their siblings while their parents work. There 
is skills training in baking, packaging and marketing 
food. Health and sanitation awareness campaigns 
help to reduce days lost through illness. And the 
school operates a shift system so children can fit in 
lessons around work if they need to. 
Poor children don’t have to buy textbooks to go 
to this 1300-pupil school, because instead they use 
activity guides, peer group research and a reference 
library. Younger pupils use flashcards, games, 
singing and miming, and a colourful cartoon story 
book called Tamasha. 
Having started 12 years ago, Katha is about 
to see just how good it is at competing with 
government schools. Last year, ten pupils passed 
the government’s class 12 school leaving certificate 
and six went to college. This year, 150 are sitting 
the class 10 leaving certificate and 30 are sitting the 
class 12 exam. Next year the school has asked for 
100 seats in the class 12 exam. 
One award this slum school has won already, 
however, is a global laureate for information 
technology for humanity from California’s Tech 
Museum. Through a partnership with British 
Telecom and Intel and donations, Dhamarajan

Air France Foundation 
 
Every picture tells a story 
it is for Eric Dexheimer’s 
O photos of street children. 
For almost a year the French 
photographer plunged into the 
world of street children from 
Fortaleza (Brazil), Paris (France), 
Ougadougou (Burkina Faso), 
Casablanca (Morocco), Manila 
(Philippines), Bucharest (Romania) 
Thiés (Senegal) and Cambodia, 
sharing their intimate existence. 
A prize-winning photographer 
and author, Dexheimer was 
chosen for the project by the 
Air France Foundation in 
collaboration with UNESCO’s 
Programme for the Education 
for Children in Difficult 
Circumstances. The result, an 
exhibition entitled Un enfant dans 
ma rue (A Child in My Street) and 
curated by Andre Deho, went on 
show at UNESCO Headquarters 
from November 18 to December 
6, 2002. 
Through images, texts, 
sculptures and objects, the 
exhibition presented the approach 
taken by associations and teachers 
who work with these children. 
In Burkina Faso, they help them 
to find a job or learn to dance. 
In Senegal, they go to the rescue 
of children who've suffered 
abuse in Koranic schools and 
run away to join street gangs. In 
the Philippines and Cambodia, 
teachers help children to structure 
their lives, proposing foster 
families, setting some ground 
rules, and getting them into 
school. In Brazil, former ballerina 
Dora Andrade runs a dance school 
and centre for social integration 
(EDISCA) for children from poor 
families in the favelas of Fortaleza. 
One of their award-winning 
troops performed a contemporary 
ballet entitled “Two Seasons” at 
UNESCO last November 20. 
“To take good photographs, you 
need to understand, to get under 
the skins of the people you want 
to speak about through images,” 
says Dexheimer, who shared the 
sleeping quarters of the children 
he photographed, 
living with them 
in sewers “under 
the street”. “It 
seemed as though 
the world was 
upside down,” 
he says. “A 
closed spaces. 
But the children 
welcomed me 
just as if they 
were inviting me 
into their apartment. 
I celebrated my 
birthday there.” 
Which explains 
why those working 
with these children, 
and the children themselves 
considered him one of their own.

Musical philosophers 
delighted audience at the 
close of a day of cerebral 
overdrive. 
The musicians 
explained their presence 
to a rapt public: “There is 
a generosity and respect 
in this music,” declared 
Herbie Hancock. “It’s 
also music that creates 
unity between people. It’s 
difficult to be at a jazz 
concert and not to feel 
part of it.” 
“Playing is constantly a 
learning process,” he said. 
“Jazz is improvis@ed, 
that’s the key component, 
you’re constantly creative. 
This needs a lot of 
courage and tolerance 
because jazz explores new 
territories, which is not 
always easy.”

published in Moscow. 
Also on the agenda of 
this third meeting between 
the two men was the 
in Russian

system and the programme 
of festivities planned for 
the 300™ anniversary of 
Saint Petersburg, where Mr 
Matsuura will visit in May. 
 
“Jazz is the R&D 
department of western 
music, spontaneous, 
unknown, which needs 
a certain vocabulary 
and cooperation,” added 
Thelonius Monk Jr. 
He explained how, 
with Hancock, they 
toured high schools in 
the US and elsewhere, 
as part of the Thelonius 
Monk Institute of Jazz, 
founded in 1986 by the 
Monk family and the late 
opera singer Maria Fisher. 
This non-profit institute 
develops introductory 
jazz programmes with 
the aim of developing 
the musical culture of 
children, encouraging 
their creativity and 
their respect for cultural 
heritage. It also offers 
college level training by 
American jazz masters 
to promising young 
musicians the world 
over. And their work 
is bearing fruit, proven 
by the performance 
that evening of the 
Thelonius Monk Jazz 
Ambassadors, a group 
of young Americans, a 
Korean, a Hungarian and 
a Brazilian, all from the 
Institute.

fter wrestling access to the Baltic 
Sea from Sweden, Peter I - known 
as the Great - brought architects 
from Italy and Holland to raise an 
idealized European city from the swamps of the 
Neva River. Until the Soviet era, the city - founded 
on May 16, 1703 (May 27, according to the modern 
calendar) — was the centre of Russian power, its 
commercial, artistic, and intellectual gateway to the 
West. 
The many foreign communities established in the 
city, Dutch shipbuilders, French craftsmen, Italian 
artists, German engineers, helped shape the new 
capital’s social environment, which in turn affected 
them and their imported cultures. The Russians and 
foreigners of St Petersburg created an imperial city 
with wide avenues and canals lined with Italian 
palaces that look different for being built on Russian 
soil. 
Aligned side by side, the historic buildings of St 
Petersburg offer a panorama at once diverse and 
homogeneous, with its own brand of classicism and 
baroque. The heritage of the Old City Centre and the 
many royal residences in the suburbs are inscribed 
on UNESCO’s World Heritage list. 
As the city prepared to celebrate its 300th 
anniversary, large scale work was undertaken to 
restore the monuments of St Petersburg, which saw 
UNESCO | the new Courier | April 2003 
 flourish some of Russia’s greatest literary talents 
(Pushkin, Gogol and Dostoievsky, to name but 
a few). Out of favour with Stalin, St Petersburg 
was largely spared the remodeling that took place 
in Moscow during the decades that followed the 
Revolution, but the city and the palaces outside it 
suffered hugely from 900 days of intense bombing 
during World War II. St Petersburg itself withstood 
the siege, but several of the palaces outside were 
occupied and reduced to a shell. 
Sisyphean restoration work began immediately 
after the War and continues to this day. Impressive 
results were achieved at Peterhof and Tsarskoie Selo, 
for example. Others, like Oranienbaum - which 
were not occupied during the War, and therefore not 
as badly damaged - are in dire need of funds for 
restoration to make up for the decay caused by the 
passing of time. 
As it celebrates its 300th anniversary, St 
Petersburg has much to show and share: a great 
many outstanding monuments, including the 
stupendous wealth of the Hermitage and Russian 
Museums; the acclaimed musical performances of 
the Marinsky Theatre; and the sweetness of life 
during the White Nights of summer when the sun 
does not set on the Venice of the North.

March 15, 1957, the 
Om committee responsible for 
the choice of artworks for UNESCO’s 
Headquarters approved the maquette 
for Calder’s mobile. Installed on 
August 22, 1958 in the Organization’s 
gardens, “Spiral” was inaugurated 
the following day in the presence of 
the artist. The ten-metre high work, 
made of two tonnes of black steel, 
and with five branches, dominates 
the gardens facing the avenue de 
Suffren. 
Alexander Calder was born into 
a family of artists in Philadelphia 
in 1898. He invented the mobile 
as an art form. In doing so he 
created a sculpture, of little mass 
but occupying a large space, whose 
movement changed the work at each 
instant, letting hazard play its part. 
Before putting a painting to 
movement, Calder had tried during 
his first years in Paris to “draw” in 
three dimensions with sculptures 
of wire. The young American was 
well integrated into the artistic 
avant-garde. “My entrance into the 
field of abstract art came about as 
the result of a visit to the studio 
UNESCO | the new Courier | April 2003 
‘capturing movement 
of Piet Mondrian in Paris in 1930. 
I was particularly impressed by some 
rectangles of color he had tacked on 
his wall [...] I told him I would like 
to make them oscillate.” 
“Mobiles have no meaning 
[...] They are, that is all; they are 
absolutes. There is more of the 
unpredictable about them than in 
any other human creation” said 
French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre 
of Calder’s work. 
The artist’s vision was grandiose. 
“The underlying sense of form in 
my work has been the system of 
the universe,” he said. For Calder, 
the idea of detached bodies floating 
in space seemed to be “the ideal 
source of form”. This same quest 
for the extreme can be found in the 
minimal use he made of colour. “I 
have chiefly limited myself to the use 
of black and white as being the most 
disparate colours. Red is the colour 
most opposed to both of these - and 
the finally, the other primaries. The 
secondary colours and intermediate 
shades serve only to confuse and 
muddle the distinctness and clarity.” 
“A mobileis|[...] 
like the sea, and 
Is equally enchanting, 
forever rebeginning, 
forever new.”

Christopher Colclough, an

countries, covering 35.6 percent 
of the world’s population, risk 
falling short of at least one of 
these three goals. 
Poor planning and a lack of 
resources are proving major 
hurdles, claims the report. 
On funding, for example,the 
Report finds that the cost of 
providing Education for All has 
been seriously under-estimated, 
largely because the impact of 
HIV/AIDS and conflict (affecting 
some 73 countries) has not been 
budgeted for. Along with bigger 
national budgets and a sizeable 
jump in external aid, the Report 
estimates that an extra 15 to 
35 million more teachers will be 
needed by 2015 - three million 
of them for sub-Saharan Africa 
alone. 
The annual Education For 
All Global Monitoring Report 
is prepared by an independent, 
international team based at 
UNESCO in Paris (France) as

D For the first time, 23 
United Nations agencies and 
convention secretariats have 
combined their efforts and 
expertise to produce a collective 
World Water Development 
Report offering a global 
overview of the state of the 
world’s freshwater resources. 
This first edition provides the 
foundation for subsequent 
editions. It concentrates on an 
assessment of progress since the 
Rio Summit and on developing 
appropriate methodologies. 
Its scope encompasses three 
linked components. First an 
assessment of human water 
stewardship that leads into an 
assessment of the state of the 
global water system, leading 
then to an assessment of critical 
problems. These components 
are used to evaluate the 
effectiveness of societies to 
manage water in a sustainable 
fashion. 
An important output from 
this analysis is the production of 
a number of indicators of water-

a simple yet effective means of 
comparison between different 
regions of the world. 
In this first edition of the

Arts and Artists 
from an economic 
Perspective 
D Xavier Greffe, professor 
of Economics of Arts at the 
University of Sorbonne, in 
Paris, examines in this book 
the relationship between the 
fine arts and economics. He 
identifies the economic factors 
that can affect the emergence, 
success and disappearance of 
artistic activities, beginning with 
an analysis of the art market, 
where the players involved 
cannot be measured by standard 
economic yardsticks. He 
further explores the various 
dynamic processes influencing 
the development of the artistic 
sector: a revolving compromise 
between heritage and creation, 
a continous passage between 
an original work of art and the 
products of cultural industries 
and a constant shift between 
for-profit and nonprofit 
institutions. Greffe provides 
a way to evaluate art from 
an economic perspective that 
explains both the creation 
and development of creative 
movement without judging the 
existence of works of art purely 
in terms of economic logic.

The Art of Living 
in Peace 
Guide to education for a 
culture of peace 
) In the current tense 
international context, UNESCO 
reaffirms its ideal of peace. 
Providing the foundations for 
a peaceful society requires 
more than directives. It needs 
an in-depth understanding 
of values, respect for others 
and a thorough awareness of 
the importance of sustainable 
development and protection 
of the environment. Education 
for peace is a process of 
safeguarding humanity. This 
guide is aimed at both teachers 
and educators worldwide, as 
well as the public at large. 
Pierre Weil is the Rector of the 
International Holistic University 
of the City of Peace Foundation 
in Brasilia (UNIPAIX). He has 
elaborated a transdisciplinary 
programme for peace education. 
UNESCO has contributed to

Tell me about the 
World Heritage 
The notion of heritage 
explained to younger 
generations 
D Not only wars, but also 
pollution, the destruction of 
forests, galloping urbanization, 
mass tourism... nearly all 
aspects of the modern world, 
if not controlled, threaten to 
endanger the natural, cultural 
and intangible heritage of 
peoples everywhere. A short 
and clear booklet addressed 
to young readers willing to 
discover what is our common 
heritage and help preserve it.

The Different Aspects 
of Islamic Culture 
Volume IV: 
Science and Technology in Islam 
Editor: A. YY. al-Hassan 
Co-Editors: Magbul Ahmed and A. Z. Iskandar 
UNESCO Publishing 
D Research into Islamic science 
and technology is still in its 
early stages, but there is now 
sufficient material available for 
a preliminary study. Volume IV 
of this series is intended to fill 
a gap which deserves a major 
multi-volume work. 
Part I is a review of the history 
of science in Islam. It deals 
with the contribution of Islamic 
civilization to mathematics, 
astronomy, and physics, which 
have long been acknowledged, 
but also advances made by 
Muslim scientists in the fields 
of cosmology, geology and 
mineralogy, zoology, veterinary 
science and botany. 
Part II deals with agricultural 
science, alchemy, chemistry 
and chemical technology,

mining and metallurgy, 
military technology, textiles 
and manufacturing industries, 
mechanical technology, civil 
engineering, navigation and 
ship-building, medicine and 
pharmacy. Historians of Islamic 
science tend to limit their studies 
to the period up to the 16th 
century, but Part II also deals 
with the continuation of science 
and technology in the Ottoman 
Empire, India and Iran.
