© CHILE Music for Mother Earth 
These musicians from the Chilean altiplano belong to the Aymara group of South American Indians whose culture is today menaced by 
the changes that have affected their region in recent years. Wearing headdresses adorned with ostrich and pink flamingo feathers and 
playing an instrument called a sicura which is only used for sacred purposes, they take part in a dawn offering of coca leaves and alcohol 
to the Earth Mother Pachamama, thanking her for her bounty and calling on her goodwill for the future. Today this ritual is only prac- 
tised occasionally and it may soon die out altogether. The Aymara believe that the spirit of music lives in water, and during the night 
before they perform their ritual the musicians leave their instruments at the waterside, so that the murmurings of the water can teach 
them the music with which to pay tribute to the Earth Mother.

‘Po and Cultures’, 
our cover title, was 
chosen to highlight the 
idea of cultural universality and 
diversity which is the keynote of this 
number of the Unesco Courier. The 
issue has been prepared in view of an 
event which constitutes a landmark 
in efforts by the international com- 
munity to redefine cultural relations 
between individuals and between 
nations: the World Conference on 
Cultural Policies (‘‘Mondiacult’) 
which Unesco is holding in Mexico 
City from 26 July to 6 August. 
The second cover title, ‘The 
Courier in Space’, refers to an ex- 
ceptional event of a different kind, 
French and Soviet cosmonauts, flying 
in a “‘Soyuz-T6” spacecraft, have 
taken with them into space a specimen 
cover of this issue together with 100 
examples of the serigraph which il- 
lustrates it and which was specially 
created for Unesco by Victor Vasare- 
ly. The proceeds from the sale of 
_these works will enable Unesco to   
finance science scholarships for young 
students from the Third World, 
An issue of this kind can pretend 
neither to deal exhaustively with all 
the complexities of cultural life, nor 
to set forth definitive solutions to 
world cultural problems. What we 
have done instead is to invite a 
number of writers and specialists to 
illustrate some of the topics that will 
be on the agenda of the Mexico City 
Conference. 
Themes examined by our con- 
tributors include: the evolution of the 
concept of culture (Otto Klineberg); 
languages and cultural identity 
(Chingiz Aitmatov); the writer bet- 
ween two cultures (Tahar Ben 
Jelloun); the situation of women 
(Han Suyin); culture and power 
(Ngugi Wa Thiong’o and Augusto 
Roa Bastos); and culture and new 
communications technology (Russell 
Neuman). 
However incomplete, such an 
overview may serve to illustrate an 
important point: even when the opi- 
nions expressed diverge from 
Unesco’s appointed mission, a strik- 
ing impression emerges of what 
Unesco is doing in many important 
areas of cultural life, while the open- 
ing article by Mr. Amadou-Mahtar 
M’Bow shows the contribution 
Unesco has made and is making to 
changing perspectives and activities 
where culture is concerned. 
Nevertheless, readers will in- 
evitably find many gaps in our 
coverage, one of them being the 
evolution of scientific thinking and 
its relations with cultural life. We in- 
tend to remedy some of these omis- 
sions in our August-September dou- 
ble number which will be devoted to 
an examination of major problems 
Jacing the world community today.

CULTURE

The human dimension 
by Amadou-Mahtar M’Bow 
which now encompasses the planet. Societies which 
until a few decades ago were able to live in almost 
total ignorance of each other are today in increasingly close 
and regular contact. There is a growing interplay of recip- 
rocal influences; interdependence is a reality in many fields 
of human activity. 
Yet while this interdependence is undoubtedly a source of 
mutual enrichment, receptivity, new initiatives and creativi-

ty, it is also a cause of frustration to the extent that it is ac- 
companied by worsening conditions for certain peoples, and 
feelings of growing uncertainty and increased vulnerability. 
Sensitivity to changes, wherever they occur in the world, is 
becoming acute. 
It is perhaps in the field of culture that the contradictory 
demands of new world relationships are most readily discer- 
nible. Communication between human beings is becoming 
global in its scope, and the quantity of knowledge and infor-

mation available is constantly increasing. With the develop- 
ment of computer technology, the possibilities of collecting 
this knowledge and information, of storing them and 
transferring them from one point on the planet to another 
are also continually expanding. 
These exchanges and contacts are accompanied by a 
growing tendency towards a standardization of tastes and 
behaviour, and a homogenization of certain patterns of life, 
thought and action, of production and consumption pro- 
pagated by the uniform dissemination of the same television 
series, the same musical rhythms, the same clothes and the 
same escapist dreams. 
This growing conformity, which seems to follow an inter- 
nal logic of its own, is gradually invading more and more 
areas of human activity. In its turn it generates distortions, 
since it tends to promote whatever conforms to it and to 
destroy everything that resists it. Whole sectors of creativity 
are thus repressed, and societies mutilated in their in- 
dividuality and their distinctive structure. Carried to the ex- 
treme, this logic could lead to the ossification of mankind 
since diversity, if accepted on a footing of complete equality, 
is an essential and fertile source of vitality for both in- 
dividual societies and the whole world. 
However, as a kind of reaction to this trend, a renewed, 
explosive affirmation of individuality is emerging. Com- 
munities everywhere—ethnic and national, rural and urban, 
cultural and religious—are asserting their originality and 
endeavouring to take in hand and defend with vigour those 
features by reference to which their identity is defined. 
The will to affirm and defend cultural identity appears 
now as one of the major driving forces of history. Far from 
representing a withdrawal into an immutable, self-enclosed 
past, it fosters a lively, original and constantly renewed syn- 
thesis. A sense of cultural identity thus appears more and 
more to be the sine qua non of progress for individuals, 
‘groups and nations; it is the force that animates and under- 
pins the collective will, mobilizes inner resources and turns 
necessary change into creative adaptation, 
It is today recognized that the notion of cultural identity 
lies at the very heart of development problems, but it is only

recently that this fact has won full acceptance by the interna- 
tional community. It is only in the last ten years that our 
understanding of development, its paths and aims, has 
broadened and deepened. Originally equated with simple, 
linear economic growth—vital, certainly, insofar as an in- 
crease in the production of material goods makes a decisive 
contribution to the improvement of people’s living condi- 
tions, when such goods are equitably distributed—develop- 
ment has increasingly been seen to be an infinitely more 
complex, comprehensive and multidimensional process, 
which is effective only if it is based on the will of each society 
to fulfil itself, and only if it truly expresses each society’s 
underlying identity. 
Genuine development can only be generated from within, 
willed and conducted by all the vital forces of the nation. It 
should therefore encompass all aspects of life and involve all 
the energies of a community within which each individual, 
each occupational category and each social group has its part 
to play in the general effort and has its share in the resulting 
benefits. 
As so often happens, this growing awareness of the true 
nature of development was largely brought about by the set- 
backs experienced in developing and industrialized countries 
alike. 
The developing countries, tempted to catch up with the in- 
dustrialized countries by following the same paths, have 
sometimes endeavoured to adopt approaches to development 
which, seeking to achieve rapid economic progress by often 
inappropriate means, did not always produce the expected 
results, or even brought new constraints which not only 
reproduced but aggravated those which had handicapped 
the industrialized countries. 
At the same time, the industrialized societies, considered 
to be the most developed, have also come to realize the very 
serious problems caused by economic growth seen as an end 
in itself. Damage to the natural environment is exacerbated 
by new constraints which threaten man’s very existence as a 
social being attached to a community with which he can fully 
identify. 
The whole international community is thus today, in dif- 
ferent ways, increasingly coming to accept the idea of in-

### 50005: Culture and development; the human dimension

» tegrated development in which economic, social and cultural 
factors are indissolubly linked and contribute together to 
progress. Culture, which is connected with all expressions of 
life and which, for every human being and every people, is 
the expression of their highest values and their very sense of 
life, emerges as the factor which is to guide and humanize 
economic growth and technical progress. ’ 
To take account of the cultural dimension—or objec- 
tive—of development is to recognize that the goal of develop- 
ment should be to render man unto himself, in other words 
to grant him a place in the world which magnifies his ex- 
istence instead of narrowing it, a time befitting his needs and 
desires, a city in which he can be integrated rather than re- 
jected, a community joined together in solidarity, and an oc- 
cupation which brings him dignity and freedom. This is to 
attach due importance to creativity, which implies that each 
people assume its own identity by enriching and continually 
reinventing it through acts, words and artefacts. 
Tradition must also be reckoned with, although it should 
not necessarily be seen as an obstacle to modernization. It is 
only when the sign loses its meaning that tradition may 
become negative, immobile introspection. It is far more ac- 
curate to see tradition as the cumulative record of the ex- 
periences of a community throughout its history. 
CULTURAL IDENTITY AND CREATIVITY 
As a result of cultural innovation, tradition may take on a 
new lease of life, become part of life as it is lived, and even 
contribute to development and progress. The conquest of 
modernity can be achieved by bringing up to date the forms, 
relationships and symbols which constitute, at the deepest 
level, the specific face of a culture. Innovation, the dynamic 
aspect of cultural identity and action, will be the agent of 
this awakening. 
Thus the notion of cultural identity is today indissociable 
from that of development. Three major spheres of human 
activity—education, science and communication—which are 
also Unesco’s fields of competence, are closely linked to 
culture and combine to extend its action in the service of 
development. 
Culture and education foster the growth of social roots. 
From the viewpoint of development they appear as essential- 
ly complementary. Economic and social development is 
largely conditioned by the conception of the world which 
prevails in a given society, but this conception of the world is 
itself influenced by the message transmitted by educational 
systems and the sensibilities which they help to stimulate. 
Modern schooling has taken the place of traditional educa- 
tion. This trend is irreversible, but the new forms of educa- 
tion are not always appropriate to the situation and real 
The assertion of cultural identity was considered to be an act of liberation, a weapon in the fight for effective 
independence and the best means of achieving the self-fulfilment of individuals and the harmonious develop- 
ment of societies. It was, moreover, the first prerequisite for the advent of a new world order, based on the in- 
alienable right of nations to dispose of themselves and on the recognition of the absolute equality and dignity 
of all cultures.

CULTURAL IDENTITY AND CREATIVITY. Cultural 
identity is not a problem for the general public but for the 
educated, whose upbringing has often included virtually inevitable 
elements of cultural alienation. The élite must return to their 
culture to understand it more effectively and experience it as a liv- 
ing reality in order to find their roots in it. Seem from this angle, 
cultural identity should be asserted primarily in the schools and 
universities. An élite, often educated in other schools and 
sometimes unsure of its identity, must be helped into awareness of 
its own heritage and its eyes opened to the fact that popular culture 
is not merely folklore. . “or

needs of individuals and groups. A widening rift in intellec- 
tual and cultural life may be observed with the extension of 
schooling, an uneasy coexistence between an élitist culture 
and a popular or traditional culture which has virtually 
nothing in common with the former. 
In a number of countries, oral tradition is the authentic 
memory of the people and, swelled by new contributions 
from each generation, explains the world in all its diversity. 
In most cases too, its symbolism opens a door onto a 
fabulous world of the imagination. The data recorded in the 
oral tradition must be rediscovered and collected, for to 
destroy or banish them to oblivion would be irreversible. 
But there are many other ways in which education must 
be linked to the most significant values of a culture. To take 
one notable example, an effort must be made to avoid the 
shock of uprooting a child which occurs when he is taught 
from the moment he enters school in a language which is not 
his own. The use of languages spoken by the community to 
which the child belongs thus appears as both an educational 
and a cultural imperative. Associated with this major choice 
should be various reforms which, through the promotion of 
popular arts and traditions, and social values, would aim to 
implant education in the realities and history of the nation. 
In this way it is certainly possible to gain from peoples 
that conscious and active participation without which there 
can be no profound sense of cultural identity nor any truly 
endogenous development. 
Another fundamental question is that of the relations bet- 
ween science and technology, on the one hand, and culture 
on the other. Whether we like it or not, the implantation of a 
technology is a cultural phenomenon. Even in cases where 
the introduction of certain technologies brings the most ob- 
vious benefits, the transfer is not culturally neutral and may 
cause a distortion of standards and the emergence of new 
values bearing no relation to deep-rooted social and human 
realities. 
It seems to me desirable, whenever possible, to try to 
develop on the spot a technology adapted to the specific 
needs of each situation, instead of turning to imported for- 
mulae when the latter cannot be satisfactorily mastered. The 
best and most vigorous development will always be en- 
dogenous development, that is to say, development con- 
sciously and fully assumed by everyone. For if the demands 
of development require that no society can do without 
science, if science is to be most fruitful it must grow roots in 
each society. Science will not contribute to improving the 
lives of men in countries where it is perceived as a foreign im- 
port until the day when it becomes an integral part of their 
culture. 
And so the need to participate in decision-making concer- 
ning scientific and technological development appears to be 
emerging in various societies. This trend suggests a certain 
shift in aspirations, from exclusively economic goals to a p

CULTURAL IDENTITY AND CREATIVITY. The question of 
each group or nation’s cultural identity, which is at the meeting- 
point of culture and communication, shows the importance of 
language both as a vehicle of communication and as part of the 
cultural heritage. Linguistic richness imposes not only a respect for 
the many languages existing but also a complex and costly adapta- 
tion of the communication networks to the different linguistic 
areas, as well as the use of many languages by the communication 
media in order to avoid standardization. Language policy therefore 
constitutes one of the thorniest and most important issues in the 
formulation of communication policies.

p range of ultimate objectives related to social and cultural 
development. It also appears to be the sign of growing 
awareness of the decisive role played by technology in the 
development of societies, and of the determination of peoples 
to assume greater responsibility for their own future, with a 
fuller knowledge of what is at stake. Thus the search for 
greater compatibility between the directions in which 
- technological change is steered and the expectations of socie- 
ty may well be one of the key issues of the coming decade. 
Communications technology has made such strides in the 
last few years that it has revolutionized life and development 
in both industrialized and developing societies. Increasingly 
people are encountering other cultures in their everyday 
lives, discovering other values, observing attitudes un- 
familiar to them, and thereby coming to know the many 
faces of mankind. And soon, through direct satellite televi- 
sion broadcasting, it will be possible to transmit knowledge 
globally, and the irruption of other cultures into every home 
will be a permanent fact. 
Whether the role of the new instruments is beneficial or 
harmful will depend on the way in which they are used by 
mankind. It seems indispensable to integrate the com- 
munications media into cultural policies, for it would be vain 
  
CULTURAL IDENTITY AND CREATIVITY. Culture, which 
was not something separate from consciousness of the 
community’s identity, was probably regarded first and foremost as 
a factor making for a stronger sense of national individuality; but 
the quest for cultural identity was in all cases combined with sym- 
pathetic receptivity to the other cultures of the region and of the 
world, and, ultimately, to all that is universally human, which 
ruled out cultural isolationism and entailed the disavowal of 
chauvinistic assertions of distinctive nationhood.

CULTURAL IDENTITY AND CREATIVITY. One might well 
ask whether the perfectly legitimate desire to eliminate the élitist 
aspects of culture has not, as a side-effect, led to a certain under- 
valuation of the specific function of creation in the totality of 
social functions. To put the question in the most basic terms: what 
would disappear if creation were to disappear from society?

to pretend that the media only raise problems of a technical 
order. They are bound to have repercussions on political at- 
titudes, on social behaviour, on ways of thinking, and thus 
on culture in the broadest sense. 
If development is the concern of all institutions of the 
United Nations system, cultural questions devolve exclusive- 
ly on Unesco, which has for some years been making an 
original contribution to the problem of cultural development 
by launching and promoting the idea of “cultural policy.” 
An intergovernmental conference on cultural policy was 
held by Unesco in Venice in 1970, and subsequently a 
number of regional conferences met in order to deepen and 
continue, in their specific contexts, the process of reflexion 
begun by the international community and to accelerate the 
evolution from an élitist concept of culture to that of cultural 
action committed to development which would promote the 
fulfilment of individuals and communities. 
“Development must find its inspiration in culture”, says 
the unanimously adopted Declaration of the Bogotd Con- 
ference (1978). Unesco is continuing this long-term effort by 
holding a world conference on cultural policies in Mexico 
City from 26 July to 6 August in order to make an assess- 
ment of this “first cultural development decade’ and to set 
forth guidelines for the future.

demonstration of the extent to which our

### 50006: Cultural pluralism in a changing world

THE EVOLUTION 
OF A CONCEPT 
Cultural pluralism 
in a changing world 
by Otto Klineberg 
It is perhaps not too surprising that in the 
history of human contacts most groups have 
been much more impressed by their dif- 
ferences from others than by the similarities. 
All too frequently this has been associated 
with the belief that if they are different from 
us they must be inferior. In the language of 
many of the pre-literate societies described 
by anthropologists the expression ‘‘the 
people’’ referred only to one’s own group; 
other groups were often considered strange, 
exotic, inferior, somewhat less than human. 
This attitude, although widespread, is not 
necessarily universal, but it has certainly 
played an important part in the relations 
between peoples, not only in the obvious 
cases of colonization and other forms of ex- 
ploitation, but even in situations which are 
motivated by liberal high-minded pro- 
grammes such as technical assistance or co- 
operation, in which the receiving areas are 
expected to adopt the standards and models 
of the donors. 
In this respect, however, it is possible to 
identify certain counter-currents, character- 
ized by a greater willingness to recognize the 
rights of others to their own cultural identi- 
ty, and by a greater concern on the part of 
those ‘“‘others’’ to maintain that identity. In 
the USA, for example, the sociologist 
Milton M. Gordon has distinguished three 
stages in the approach to the complex 
American ethnic structure. The first, Anglo- 
conformity, demanded ‘‘the complete 
renunciation of the immigrant’s ancestral 
heritage in favour of the behaviour and 
values of the Anglo-Saxon core group;’’ the 
second, the melting-pot idea, envisaged ‘‘a 
biological merger of the Anglo-Saxon 
peoples with other immigrant groups and a 
blending of their respective cultures into a 
new indigenous American type;”’ the third, 
characterizing the present situation, is 
cultural pluralism, which seeks ‘the preser- 
vation of the communal life and significant 
portions of the culture of the later im- 
migrant groups within the context of 
American citizenship and political and 
economic integration into American 
society.”’ Problems remain as to the extent 
to which such a goal is fully possible or 
desirable, but certainly the acceptance of a 
variety of cultural forms within the nation- 
state is much greater now than it was in the 
past. The same is true for other countries 
such as Yugoslavia, the Philippines, 
Belgium and France, not always to the same 
extent, but in the same direction. 
On the other side of the picture, various 
ethnic groups in a number of different coun- 
tries are now actively seeking the preserva- 
tion of their own cultural identity. One of 
the most striking recent instances of an 
ethnic group seeking to establish and main- 
tain its cultural identity is that of the Blacks 
in the United States. Slavery and its after- 
math of an inferior socio-economic position 
within the larger community were clearly 
not conducive to the development of a 
positive sense of identity. 
What happened during the 1960s was 
something approaching a psychological 
revolution. There was a refusal to accept the 
notion of ‘‘cultural deprivation’’, since the p

INTERCULTURAL RELATIONS 
 
One of the functions of intercultural activities is to inhibit racism and to promote a better understanding between 
cultures. The very fact that young children feel no aversion to what is different and that such aversion is acquired 
proves the urgent need to undertake fundamental research which would enable teachers to suggest activities that 
respect the evolution and modalities of the relational life of the child.

p position of the Blacks was that they had 
their own culture. With that went the 
development of a whole complex philo- 
sophy (or ideology) of identity. This includ- 
ed the concept of Black Power, the slogans 
“Black is beautiful’’and “I’m proud to be 
Black;”’ African roots and a Black or 
African culture; Black nationalism. Black 
psychologists and psychiatrists spoke of a 
new Black ethic based upon racial 
awareness, high self-esteem, identity and 
pride; a sense of adequacy and security. 
One aspect of culture which Blacks have 
emphasized is that their . self-identity is 
always a people-identity; ‘‘I am because we 
are, and because we are, therefore I am.” 
This is seen to be in contrast with the 
Western emphasis on the self as individually 
unique and different, In a recent book by an 
American social scientist, Edmund Glenn, 
an African ambassador in Washington is 
quoted as saying: ‘““The source of the 
10 
greatest misunderstanding between Ameri- 
cans and Africans is the positive value at- 
tached by the Americans to individualism, 
and the negative value attached to it by 
Africans.” 
In France today we are witnessing a strik- 
ing development of concern with ethnic 
identity and the preservation of minority 
cultures. In Brittany, Corsica, ‘‘Occitanie’’, 
etc., this tendency has increased in strength 
as it has also among the Catalans and 
Basques in Spain, American Indians and 
European minorities in the United States 
and Canada, the Maori in New Zealand, the 
aboriginal population in Australia and 
other ethnic groups in many parts of the 
world. 
All of these developments appear to be in 
a direction which we should welcome. The 
Unesco Declaration on Race in 1967 in- 
cludes a statement to the effect that ‘ethnic 
groups which suffer discrimination are 
sometimes accepted or tolerated by the 
dominant group if they totally give up their 
cultural identity... Ethnic groups should be 
encouraged to preserve their cultural values, 
thus contributing to the enrichment of the 
total human culture.” 
Culture, as has already been indicated, 
refers to behaviour which is specifically. 
human and also to the distinctive ways of 
life found in different human populations. 
From the point of view of education for in- 
ternational understanding, it has frequently 
been suggested that it is important to supply 
information as to how others behave; 
although such information does not 
necessarily lead to friendly attitudes, it does 
seem safer to base our relations with other 
people on knowledge rather than on ig- 
norance. On the other hand, the 
psychologist Gordon Allport suggested a 
number of years ago that educators had 
gone too far in stressing the differences

## [Page 11](074720engo.pdf#page=11) 0

### 50006: Cultural pluralism in a changing world

among peoples, and presenting others as 
strange and even exotic in their behaviour, 
He called instead for an ‘‘encyclopedia of 
human similarities,” with greater stress on 
the common-human, A more reasonable 
position would be to include both the 
resemblances and the differences. Our 
understanding of culture requires a concern 
with both similarities and differences, and 
also with the ease and likelihood with which 
the differences occur. 
A serious difficulty’ arises when we at- 
tempt to identify the characteristics of a par- 
ticular culture. Every group is a complex, 
with variations in behaviour according to 
social class or status, occupation, education 
or role; the kind of culture exhibited or ab- 
sorbed by the individual will be somewhat 
different for men and women, for young 
and old, for each individual; in a nation- 
state it may vary considerably from one 
region to another. These variations are often 
characterized as sub-cultures, but it is not 
easy to determine how many sub-cultures 
should be distinguished. In addition, 
cultures change. How much continuity is 
there between Czarist and Communist 
Russia, Elizabethan and Victorian England, 
or the France of Louis XIV and today? 
In connexion with cultural change, there 
is an important development in recent years 
which is usually defined as the ‘‘counter- 
culture,” because of the position taken by 
its adherents in relation to, and often in op- 
position to the prevailing values of the larger 
community. It is mainly confined to the 
young in industrial societies; it denies the 
relevance of many of the ideals of the 
parents; it is not concerned with making 
preparations for the future, but insists on 
living intensely the experience of the present 
(the now generation), Success is seen not in 
material terms but as personal development, 
self-fulfilment, self-realization. 
One aspect of this movement is particular- 
ly striking in connexion with cultural varia- 
tions. For many of the devotees of the 
counter-culture, salvation is to be found in 
the religions of the Orient. Many parents 
and teachers of the young in revolt against 
their society find it hard to understand the 
attraction of Zen Buddhism or Hinduism, 
but the emphasis on contemplation and in- 
ner peace must seem very palatable to those 
trying to escape from a society which 
stresses hard work and material success. Not 
only do the Eastern religions provide an 
alternative style; they also reduce or remove 
any feelings of guilt that may be felt as the 
result of defection from the goals which the 
young had been brought up to respect, but 
which no longer satisfied them.

INTERCULTURAL RELATIONS. Co-operative relations between nations can—as a con- 
sequence of the central role assigned to knowledge—be approached from two related stand- 
points, distinct yet interconnected. Direct action must be taken, firstly, to foster understand- 
ing among nations, by promoting ‘‘the free flow of ideas’ and, generally speaking, ex- 
changes in the sphere of intellectual and cultural activities. But co-operation is also needed in 
order to bring about broader participation in intellectual and cultural activities in all 
societies, whence the notions of ‘popular education’’ and ‘‘the spread of culture’’; whence, 
also, the ideal of *‘equality of educational opportunity’’ and the need to *‘maintain, increase 
and diffuse knowledge’’. At the meeting-point of these two approaches, Unesco must work 
to ‘‘give people of all countries access to the printed and published materials produced by 
any of them’, and also assure ‘‘the conservation and protection of the world’s inheritance’ 
in the field of culture.

THE BOOK 
Although the developing countries 
represent about 70 per cent of the world 
population, they produce scarcely a 
Jifth of the books published in the 
world, the rest of the production being 
concentrated in about 30 industrialized 
countries. The chief obstacles to the 
development of local production are the 
cost of intellectual production (authors’ 
Sees, acquisition of copyrights, financ- 
ing of translation), and the cost of 
manufacture, in which the two main 
items are machinery and paper but 
which also includes professional train- 
ing. Until they are able to cater for their 
own needs, the developing countries are 
obliged to meet their home 
demand—which is increasing with the 
spread of education and the advance of 
literacy—by recourse to outside sources 
of supply. This involves them in expen- 
ditures which are all the heavier in that 
high transport costs have to be added to 
the price of the books themselves and 
that payment has to be made in foreign 
currency. Moreover, the imported 
books are by no means always suited to 
the aspirations of their peoples, whereas 
their national authors, who are often 
Jorced to publish their works abroad 
because they are not included in the 
local publishing economic circuit, 
would be in a position to meet most of 
their needs. Outside supplies can thus 
only be temporary palliatives and not 
real remedies for the book shortage.

### IGNORE

  
  
The years that have elapsed since the World Conference on Cultural Policies 
organized by Unesco at Venice in 1970 have been a very interesting period of 
increasing awareness in the cultural field. 
At the theoretical level, some key concepts have emerged from the discus- 
sions and meetings held at the instigation of Unesco. Fundamental questions 
have been asked about the role of culture in the modern world. Various 
regional conferences have pursued in greater depth the forceful ideas first 
enunciated at Venice, and have dealt both with problems specific to the regions 
and with those that form part of the world cultural problem. 
Culture defined solely according to aesthetic 
criteria does not translate the reality of other 
cultural forms. There is a unanimous feeling in 
favour of a socio-anthropological definition of 
culture. Culture should describe the sum total of the 
existential, concrete characteristics of entire 
peoples. It includes ways of life and production, 
value systems, opinions and beliefs. Hence the im- 
possibility of applying a single, interchangeable 
cultural policy. The dynamic aspect of this defini- 
tion is its recognition of cultural specificities.     
Since culture is linked to the various aspects of 
social life, any cultural policy should be defined in 
terms of its interactions with policies for education, 
science and technology, environment and com- 
munication. Hence the key idea of the cultural 
aspect of development.     
CULTURAL CONFERENCES 
VENICE (24 August-2 September 1970): Intergovernmental Conference on In- 
stitutional, Administrative and Financial Aspects of Cultural Policies. 
At Venice, States became aware of their new responsibilities in the cultural 
field and of the growing importance of cultural values in the life of nations. 
Human rights came to include the right to culture. Governments found 
themselves under an obligation to create conditions favourable to the exercise 
of that right. The Venice conference widened the notion of culture to include 
the way of life of the people, and began to regard cultural development as an 
essential feature of the overall development of any society. 
\ 
It seems indispensable to develop a policy of 
cultural action which would promote the 
democratization of culture. Access to culture does 
not imply the acceptance of a finished cultural pro- 
duct; the aim should be for the community to par- 
ticipate actively in cultural events.     
EUROCULT : Intergovernmental Conference on Cultural Policies in Europe 
(Helsinki, 19-28 June 1972) 
The Helsinki conference considered the cultural ends of development and 
dealt with the interaction between culture on the one hand and education, com- 
munication and environment on the other. It brought out some highly signifi- 
cant links between culture and social justice, between culture and youth and 
between cultural activity and attempts at democratization. It paid special at- 
tention to artistic creativity and the status of the artist; to the increasing par- 
ticipation of the people in cultural life; to innovations stemming from the in- 
telligent use of the mass media; and to the safeguarding of the environment 
and the improvement of the habitat. 
The acceptance of cultural diversity within a com- 
munity and the reconciliation of cultural pluralism 
with national unity constitute one of the major 
challenges for cultural policies in the future.     


### 50007: UNESCO and the idea of cultural policy

UNESCO AND THE IDEA OF CULTURAL POLICY 
ASIACULT : Intergovernmental Conference on Cultural Policies in Asia 
(Yogyakarta, 27 October-6 November 1973) 
The main original feature of the Yogyakarta conference was that it put for- 
ward the idea of the cultural development of individuals and societies as a fac- 
tor for national identification and a means to social progress. It advocated the 
search for original development models to hold the balance between material 
and spiritual and between social and individual values and between the preser- 
vation of national cultures and the necessary assimilation of science and 
technology. It encouraged the definition of national communications policies, 
having in mind the potentialities and dangers of the mass media for cultural 
development. 
Tradition is not to be confused with a rejection of 
scientific and technological progress. Access to 
modernity should not take place beneath the form 
of alienation and economic imperialism. Science 
and technology should be controlled by the user 
countries and developed in forms adapted to the 
social and cultural characteristics corresponding to 
the real needs of populations.     
AFRICACULT : Intergovernmental Conference on Cultural Policies in Africa 
(Accra, 27 October-6 November 1975) 
Al the Accra conference, the idea of cultural identity was highlighted as the 
historical basis for any process of endogenous development by societies and as 
the quickest way to recognition of the diversity of cultures. Cultural policies 
were defined in their organic links with educational, environmental and com- 
munications policies and policies for the revalidation of the national heritage. 
While considering that African cultures must remain open to outside contribu- 
tions and receptive to the main creative trends of the modern world, the con- 
ference nevertheless advocated that the terms of international co-operation be 
altered so as to foster intercultural dialogue on a basis of fair reciprocity. 
Education is the key concept in all problems 
related to culture. Formal and informal education 
must be rethought in the perspective of lifelong 
education. It is above all necessary to study the en- 
vironment and the people for whom education is 
being considered so as to avoid the adoption just as 
they are of foreign models. Education should be 
critical, creative and liberating, and thus narrow the 
gap between popular and élite culture. More 
democratization means more social justice.     
AMERICACULT : Intergovernmental Conference on Cultural Policies in 
Latin America and the Caribbean (Bogota, 10-20 January 1978) 
The Bogotd conference went more deeply into the problems of cultural 
identity on the basis of the unusual experience of the region, where cultural 
crossbreeding has produced syncretic ‘cultures with a universal mission. 
Cultural identity was also seen as correlated with respect for cultural pluralism 
and the preservation of the heritage. The conference also stated that no 
cultural policy worthy of the name was possible without special attention to ar- 
tistic creativity, to the fostering of creative imagination in books and films, to 
the training of cultural development staffs and to research in the field of 
cultural policies. 
Knowledge about human action on the environ- 
ment should be a part of children’s education, and 
one of the tasks of the authorities should be to train 
specialists in cultural development and to make 
them aware of the consequences of the choices they 
formulate in fields which they may think are totally 
distinct from culture.     
Third Conference of Arab Ministers of Culture : Baghdad (2-5 November 
1981) organized by ALECSO (Arab League Educational, Cultural and Scien- 
tific Organization) 
Similar preoccupations were considered at the Conference of Arab Ministers 
of Culture convened in 1981 by ALECSO. The participants admittedly dealt 
with questions specific to Arabic culture and to the cultural policies of Member

States, but also tackled more general questions such as the specificity and 
universality of culture in the world, the right to culture and the cultural dimen- 
sion of development. 
These cultural meetings, bridging the frontiers between Europe, Africa, the 
Arab world, Asia and Oceania, Latin America and the Caribbean, naturally 
gave regional, interregional and international cultural co-operation between 
States its rightful place as one of the prime prerequisites for the maintenance of 
a fruitful climate of camaraderie, security and peace in the world. 
All the Unesco conferences stress the need to con- 
sider the freedom of choice of creators and of 
peoples as absolutes which cannot be transgressed, 
seeing in them the means of placing man at the cen- 
tre of development.     
Communication may be the vehicle of packaged 
culture or it may transmit- endogenous cultural 
values. ’     
WORLD CULTURAL PROBLEMS: THE CONSTANTS 
Thus from one conference to the next and from one cultural area to another 
certain constants emerge in varying degrees of intensity which illustrate the 
main topics of world cultural problems as they affect men’s hopes and dreams 
at the time, viz. cultural identity, the cultural dimension of development, 
cultural rights and the role of imagination and creativity. 
The dynamic safeguard of cultural authenticity 
implies the revaluation and promotion of minority 
languages and their insertion in States’ educational 
and social systems, as well as the study and promo- 
tion of the oral tradition and folk arts.     
OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE OF CULTURAL ACTION 
Nowadays there is no country in the world without an urge for cultural ac- 
tivity, whatever the level and type of action taken by the government. Many 
governments are pursuing cultural policies or programmes of cultural activity. 
The great majority of Member States of Unesco have a ministry or body in 
charge of cultural affairs, and also more or less substantial and diversified net- 
works of cultural institutions and socio-cultural centres. In some countries, 
particularly those with a federal constitution, the deliberately limited central 
Structures are complemented by regional and local structures, semi- 
administrative bodies including professionals and experts which act to foster 
artistic creativity. There is a great deal of parallel action, though it is not usual- 
ly integrated in an overall plan. 
As regards the objectives, scope and protagonists of cultural action, three 
main types of policy may be distinguished. The first, the most widespread, 
stresses the development of the arts at professional level or the preservation of 
the heritage, the role of the State and the big institutions going unchallenged. 
The second, the most *‘advanced’’ of present-day cultural policies, sets out to 
link culture with education, communication and the environment. Govern- 
ment action is more directed towards the decentralization of action, decisions 
and resources, and to getting minorities and the underprivileged to play a big- 
ger part in cultural life, particularly through cultural leadership. At the same 
time, other administrations begin to take over cultural activities in their own 
sectors, e.g. youth, education, equipment, health, information and tourism. 
The third type of cultural policy, which so far exists only in the form of 
Jorward-looking studies or very limited experiments, aims radically to remodel 
all aspects of development and give them cultural ends, by taking human fac- 
tors into account. What is regarded as the essential feature is that peoples play 
a part in creating their own culture, rather than merely having access to the 
culture of the élite or to the products of mass culture. 
A Unesco recommendation, of overrriding im- 
portance, proposes to States a sociology of crea- 
tion, through a critical vision of social reality, ar- 
tistic creation being considered as the creation of 
new values. The recommendation attempts to 
reconcile creative freedom with the economic and 
social security of the artist.     
OBSTACLES IN THE WAY OF CULTURAL ACTION 
Obviously the great majority of existing situations fall short of the 
theoretical level reached by key centres in the international community. The in- 
ternal reasons for this situation are no doubt economic (i.e. small budgets), 
technical (i.e. lack of facilities or specialized staff and insufficient research and 
information) or psycho-sociological (i.e. conservatism, bureaucratic influence 
or failure to appreciate present requirements for creation and participation). 
But the real reason for the limitations encountered in most cases seems to be 
more structural: the lack of a really integrated approach to cultural develop- 
ment and socio-economic development is the fundamental defect of present- 
day cultural policies, all too often devised and implemented without organic 
links with policies which could inject a cultural dimension into all major 
development projects. In fact nearly all cultural policies are in varying degrees 
limited to the specifically cultural field, and support the big institutions (main- 
ly in the capital cities), the preservation of the historical and artistic heritage, 
professional creativity and distribution. All too few of them are defined in 
terms of the whole social spectrum, or incorporate in their thinking the real-life 
experience, the aspirations and the dreams of the teeming masses. 
International cultural co-operation should be 
thought of in terms of equality and reciprocity, the 
recognition of cultural diversity implying respect 
for national independence and sovereignty.     
MONDIACULT : World conference on cultural policies Mexico, 26 July-6 
August 1982 
Now that Mondiacult is to be convened in Mexico, new life for cultural 
policies would take the form of energetic theoretical and practical action 
calculated to mobilize the creative efforts of individuals and groups at all levels 
of society. Such a vital force could radically revitalize exchanges and specific 
relations between the members of a given society and between the peoples and 
nations that make up the international community. In this new atmosphere, 
economics and politics, the output of goods and services and the symbolic out- 
put of ideologies and the arts would all become ways of achieving a cultural life 
closely linked to daily life and the happiness and fulfilment of individuals and 
social groups. 
The portents of this transformation in the role of culture in society call upon 
people wherever they may be to make a qualitative change in their cultural 
adventure, like the one they made when harnessing the forces of nature. In this 
way they will bring together the still all too scattered currents of world solidari- 
ty in a great world cultural project that will save from the nuclear apocalypse 
the very roots of a new understanding worthy of each and every man. 
Mondiacult may be this focal point, where those attending the intergovern- 
mental conference convened by Unesco will reach a new view of the world and 
thus arrive at a decisive change in cultural relations between individuals and 
between nations. 
The heritage is not only the sum total of historic 
monuments but the dynamic and living totality of 
human creation.     
From now on, culture can only be seen as a part of a system of relationships: 
a process of give and take is imperative for each national culture. 
The idea is gaining ground that no headway can be made without a consen- 
sus, Unesco has become the promoter of this consensus, of which it intends to 
be a focal point.

CONTINUED FROM PAGE 11 
The whole movement included within the 
concept of the counter-culture has lost many 
of its adherents, and is frequently con- 
sidered to have abandoned a good part of its 
programme. This may be the case, but re- 
cent research on the attitudes of young men 
and women with regard to work and their 
future, indicates that at least some of its 
components continue to have an impact. 
We turn now to a number of specific 
issues in connexion with culture contact in 
the contemporary world which create 
problems for institutions like Unesco and 
the United Nations and for all those who 
agree with them that the variety of human 
cultures should as far as possible be preserv- 
ed. These issues take the form of apparent 
contradictions or paradoxes which require 
careful consideration. 
The first of these relates to the general 
programme of technical assistance or co- 
operation designed to improve the standard 
of living in developing countries, but which 
in practice involves the introduction of in- 
dustrial and technological models from the 
“modern’’, usually the Western world. 
This, too, reflects the United Nations pro- 
gramme; the question arises as to whether it 
is compatible with the survival of traditional 
cultures. The American anthropologist Ed- 
ward Hall reminds us that the various facets 
of a culture are interrelated; ‘touch a 
14 
culture in one place and everything else is af- 
fected.” The Australian psychologist 
Stephen Bochner insists that ‘‘there are 
many examples of societies which have lost 
their cultural integrity as the price for 
modernization.”’ 
Such “‘modernization’’ is, however, 
precisely what the leaders of the developing 
countries are requesting. The Norwegian 
sociologist Johan Galtung points out that 
Third World representatives are urging the 
creation of ‘‘a New International Economic 
Order (NIEO) to have faster industrializa- 
tion, increasing exports, better raw material 
prices, more financial and technological 
transfers.”’ The question then arises: can 
this be done without destroying, or at least 
disrupting, the existing indigenous, tradi- 
tional culture? 
It has frequently been pointed out that 
there is a tendency in the industrially 
developed world to see itself as a universally 
valid model to be imitated by others. In this 
connexion Galtung analyzes the important 
question of human needs, their universal 
and variable character, and the necessity of 
avoiding cultural ethnocentrism, paying 
more direct attention to what the recipient 
societies want, and less to what the donors 
think they ought to want. What they want 
may, however, be difficult to determine 
since the political leaders and the évolués in 
many developing countries have themselves 
adopted a position close to that of the 
Western world. 
The fact remains that technological 
change is not always accompanied by the 
disappearance of traditional culture. There 
can be no doubt as to the industrial and 
technical achievement of the Japanese, but 
at the same time they have retained many 
distinctively Eastern and national traits. It 
has been suggested, for example, that their 
life continues to be affected by the notion of 
mutual dependence, whereas the West, cen- 
tred on the individual, tends to develop 
more self-reliance. In Japan a business 
enterprise, no matter how large, is seen in 
the image of a household, with the accom- 
panying interdependence and loyalty 
characteristic of the family. 
There is a second paradox to be con- 
sidered. The United Nations/Unesco posi- 
tion is in favour of contact among the 
peoples of the world, and extensive pro- 
grammes of ‘‘exchange of persons’ have 
been developed by both national and inter- 
national agencies. Bochner, however, in 
discussing the forces antithetical to cultural 
preservation, includes international educa- 
tional exchange “‘which acts as the main 
vehicle for the uncritical diffusion of 
Western culture and therefore the erosion of 
non-Western life styles.”

INTERCULTURAL RELATIONS. The 
real question we ought to ask ourselves is 
whether, among the patterns of universal 
character put forward there is one more 
likely to respect diversity in the overall 
development scheme. For there are many 
advantages in diversity and these advan- 
tages are not only cultural but also 
economic. Are there, then, patterns and 
ideologies which, while necessarily being 
presented as they are—that is of universal 
character—are more likely than others to 
maintain diversity rather than consider it as 
an obstacle to development, and how can 
they be applied?

With special reference to Africa, the 
Kenyan political scientist Ali Mazrui speaks 
of the university as *‘the pinnacle of the 
structure of dependency,” and particularly 
cultural dependency. He considers that this 
phenomenon is to be found not only in the 
case of those who go abroad to study but 
also of those who attended universities 
within Africa, since these were so often built 
upon a Western or European model, with 
little relation to local needs. One has the im- 
pression that this situation has recently 
changed in the direction of greater attention 
to problems within Africa, but the fact re- 
mains that the tools and the language of 
observation and research have been im- 
ported from outside, so that it is difficult to 
contradict Mazrui’s argument that the 
university frequently leads to cultural 
dependency. One is reminded of the oft- 
quoted statement by Frantz Fanon, ‘“To be 
integrated one must become what one is not, 
a White.” 
Bochner attempts to resolve the issue 
which he has raised concerning the negative 
effect of international university exchanges 
by suggesting a change in their orientation. 
He writes that “Programmes will have to 
shift their goals explicitly and self- 
consciously from the present purpose of 
producing cultural exporters to the aim of 
training cultural mediators,’ that is to say, 
people who have been trained to interpret 
both cultures to both societies, in the coun- 
try of sojourn and in the country of origin. 
This issue is raised in the volume edited by 
Ingrid Eide, Students as Links between 
Cultures, which reports the results of 
research undertaken at the request of 
Unesco and which finds that such a 
mediating influence occurs with con- 
siderable frequency among students who 
have attended a foreign university. Our own 
research also indicates that a substantial 
proportion of foreign students in a number 
of countries reported that they felt more 
positive about their own country after their 
experience abroad, with only a very small 
minority indicating that they felt more 
negative. This suggests that negative at- 
titudes toward one’s own culture are not the 
usual reaction, but the idea that more atten- 
tion be paid to education for mediation bet- 
ween cultures seems eminently reasonable. 
The third and final paradox to be men- 
tioned is that those who advocate cultural 
pluralism do so for different reasons, and 
expect from it very different consequences. 
They may favour it because they respect 
other cultures, On the other hand, it is il- 
luminating to read what Gluckman, a South 
African-born anthropologist, has to say 
about his native country in this connexion. 
““As a South African anthropologist, I have 
always been impressed by the fact that in 
some ways the most sympathetic and even 
laudatory analyses of indigenous African 
cultures in South Africa come from studies 
of scholars who believed in the policy of 
ethnic segregation. They describe the culture 
of each African people in an idealistic 
form—and therein was contained the im- 
plication that those cultures were good for 
the peoples concerned, an essential part of 
their being, something to which they were 
entitled and which they should be helped to 
maintain.” 
Presumably these cultures were fine if 
they could be kept at a distance from the 
White population. It is striking to note that

### 50006: Cultural pluralism in a changing world

» traditional cultures may be expressive of 
such different motivations. 
It should be clear from what has preceded 
that the position adopted here is that if 
ethnic groups wish to keep their culture 
alive, they should be permitted, even en- 
couraged, to do so. There is, however, one 
argument which has occasionally been ex- 
pressed in favour of increasing the 
homogeneity of cultures, namely, that 
cultural differences may lead to conflict. In 
some cases the conflict may be minor, caus- 
ing annoyance rather than real hostility, but 
even then acceptance of other groups may 
be made more difficult. This is because 
cultural differences tend to create an us and 
them psychology. : 
The major difficulty lies in the general at- 
titude to which reference has already been 
made, that if they differ from us, they must 
be inferior. This is the major impediment to 
the acceptance of cultural diversity. As Hall 
puts it, we must ‘‘stop ranking either people 
or talents and accept the fact that there are 
many roads to truth and no culture has a 
corner on the path or is better equipped than 
others to search for it.” 
There is no easy way to predict future 
developments in this complex area. The 
situation may be summarized in terms of 
two conflicting tendencies. On the one 
hand, there is the desire on the part of the 
Third World, particularly its leaders, to pro- 
fit from the technological competence of in- 
dustrially advanced countries; the diffusion 
of Western culture is a consequence. On the 
other hand, there is a growing concern with 
toward cultural pluralism, concern about 
group identity, négritude, respect for dif- 
ferences, increased resistance to a cultural 
imperialism which runs the risk of destroy- 
ing the variations in ways of life which 
enrich the human condition. 
Changes in the direction of ‘‘moderniza- 
tion’ will undoubtedly continue, and they 
are needed in the fight against poverty, 
illness, infant mortality, illiteracy, the in- 
ferior position of women, and the political 
powerlessness of the mass of the population. 
The question remains as to how these 
changes may be introduced while preserving 
the major aspects of the way of life of the 
people concerned. 
This would involve a better understanding 
of the meaning and value of cultural varia- 
tions; knowledge of the needs and aspira- 
tions of other ethnic groups; the ability to 
empathize with others, that is, to imagine 
ourselves in their position; greater respect 
for diversity; more willingness to have 
priorities set by the recipients of aid rather 
than by the donors; willingness to admit that 
the way of life which we prefer is not 
necessarily valid universally. 
All of this would require an educational 
campaign far more extensive than any so far 
attempted. One of its aspects which should 
have significant implications is the 
demonstration of the interdependence of 
cultures, with the tremendous amount of 
borrowing and diffusion throughout 
history. 
The American anthropologist Ralph Lin- 
ton once wrote a convincing article entitled 
describes a day in the life of an American 
citizen, the covers of whose bed are of silk 
(from China), whose breakfast knife is of 
steel, (first made in South India), who 
drinks coffee (an Abyssinian plant), and so 
on. ‘As he absorbs (in his newspapers) the 
accounts of foreign troubles, he will, if he is 
a good conservative citizen, thank a Hebrew 
deity in an Indo-European language that he 
is one hundred percent American.’’ French 
history might be written not only to show 
what France has contributed to civilization, 
but also to indicate what the rest of the 
world has contributed to France. If this 
variety of interdependence were more widely 
recognized, we might all be able to over- 
come the limitations set on our judgment 
and our attitudes by our particular culture, 
and to learn that other ways of life may have 
equal merit and validity. 
In any case, it is a safe prediction that 
although there will be some convergence in 
the behaviour and values of different 
societies, cultural variations will persist 
throughout the world in the foreseeable 
future. One can only hope that there will 
also be increased recognition of the value of 
cultural diversity, and of its contribution to 
the development of a positive social identity. 
At the same time there must also be freedom 
of choice for the individual to retain as 
much of his ethnic group’s culture as he 
wishes and to take from other cultures what 
he finds most palatable. Societies have the 
right to develop their own preferred 
character, but so does the individual. The 
search for positive identity is both individual 
and social.

(Unesco, 1981, 477 pp.) 
ferent regions of the globe, this important Unesco publica- 
tion presents the essential features of a number of regional 
experiences in cultural development and highlights the many cultu- 
ral facets of the peoples of Africa, Latin America and the Carib- 
bean, Asia, the Arab States and Europe. 
In Africa, in a civilization in which religion, art and morals are 
the driving forces of society, the intrusion of the modern world has 
often disrupted personal relationships. What new cultural objec- 
tives will come to the forefront and how will these match up to 
the administrative, psychological, aesthetic and social realities 
of an Africa determined to maintain its traditions and its own 
personality? 
If the notion of cultural identity is of primary importance in 
African countries, in Latin America and the Caribbean, with their 
long history of interplay between indigenous populations, Africans 
and Europeans, there is a heightened awareness of its significance. 
For Latin Americans identity means, above all, integration and 
mingling. The establishment of regional agreements and educa- 
tional services bears witness to a desire for dialogue between cul- 
tures, a dialogue for which Latin Americans and the Caribbean 
peoples are well prepared by the special circumstances of their 
ethnic intermixture. 
Although Japan and China are not included in the review of 
Asia, it nevertheless covers an immense geographical area which 
constitutes an astonishing reservoir of values, symbols and tradi- 
tions derived from history, legend and myth. In the past, despite a 
multiplicity of ethnic groups, languages, castes, micro-cultures and 
religions, established patterns of thought provided the basis for a 
certain cultural coherence, but the establishment of modern States 
and the imposition of economic priorities have met with institu- 
tional as well as social and psychological resistance. In all Asian 
16 
(eenireson contributions from five experts from dif- countries a balance is being sought between the maintenance of 
cultural authenticity and receptivity to outside influences. Asia 
must rediscover its ancient pilgrimages and caravan trails but also 
benefit from the facilities offered by modern communications. 
Arab-Muslim culture developed on the foundation of a spiritual 
unity, but today the religious phenomenon is increasingly being 
seen as a global sociological phenomenon with differentiated zones 
to which the age-old influence of certain geographical, linguistic 
and ethnic factors has imparted distinct, characteristic features. 
After the advent of the industrial society which has consecrated the 
primacy of utilitarianism and contributed to the rejection of 
humanism, the author wonders whether the time has come for a 
new humanism which will give back to man his physical and 
spiritual dimensions. Here the spiritualistic and universalizing role 
of Islamic culture will have a role to play. 
In Europe, despite the surprising persistence of cultural tradi- 
tions among the people, in the countryside and in ways of life, 
there has been an overwhelming development of uniformizing mass 
culture. The consequences of this, says the author, are that the 
general public turns away from a cultural reality which it cannot 
comprehend and which is divorced from the reality of its own 
preoccupations. At the same time a high-level culture has 
developed to some extent but finds itself more and more confined 
within a sophisticated experimentation accessible only to initiates. 
Social, economic and educational inequalities and the new means 
of communication are factors whose impact will have a strong in- 
fluence in determining cultural policies, 
All these regional experiences tend to the conclusion that cul- 
tural development has become a primordial demand of both States 
and peoples and that the enhancement and recognition of cultural 
diversity can only result in a better, more evenly balanced world.

### 50013: The Writer between two worlds

    
CROSS-ROADS 
-OF CULTURES 
The writer 
between two worlds 
by Tahar Ben Jelloun 
HE Third World intellectual must 
] live with a terrible fact: over 80 per 
cent of people in the Third World 
can neither read nor write. No magic wand 
can be waved to alter their plight; it will be a 
long, hard struggle which will call on men 
and women with a real determination for 
change. As for the poet, he is concerned by 
the plight of the humiliated, whether he ex- 
periences humiliation at first hand or as an 
observer. And to be excluded from reading 
and writing is possibly the deepest wound 
that material poverty and political cynicism 
can inflict on a man. 
Is it not a paradox to write in a continent 
of illiterates? ‘‘No,’” says the Mexican 
writer Carlos Fuentes, *‘it is not as paradox- 
ical as it may seem. Perhaps the writer 
knows that he is working to keep alive a 
relationship with a past which has rarely 
found its political equivalent.” 
A literature in which many poor and 
dominated peoples find a recognizable pic- 
ture of themselves has come from a single 
fissure etched in the warm and human earth 
of Latin America. The waifs and strays of 
Bogota are part of the same wound as the 
urchins of Cairo and the shayatin (“little 
devils’’) of Casablanca. A peasant 
dispossessed of his land has the same dreams 
whether he lives in north Africa or northeast 
Brazil; the same imagination broken by in- 
justice, forbidden to express itself, thwarted 
by a tragic fate, 
Once he has resisted blandishments and 
pressures, the writer born of this reality can- 
not accept that a dispossessed peasant 
should be left to live what political and 
military authorities call a reasonable life. 
Whether he likes it or not, the writer will be 
pursued unremittingly by this anonymous 
crowd of urchins who have been deprived of 
LITERACY AND EDUCATION 
a childhood and who pour scorn on in- 
nocence, of men and women debarred from 
a life of dignity and freedom. 
Whether silent or muzzled, this crowd ap- 
peals to the writer, not in order to flatter 
him but to make him listen. Who if not he 
will report on this clamour of fury? This is a 
fundamental reason why a writer should 
write, even if he will not be read by the 
crowd which cries out to him. 
It is possible not to write, not to respond 
to this pressing demand, not to hear the 
silenced voice, to look elsewhere, to be 
wrapped up in one’s own trivial problems. It 
is quite possible for the writer to turn down 
this ““mission’’. He may think that the fate 
of the people from whence he came is no 
concern of his. He may even aspire to 
become a member of the dominant class. 
But it does sometimes happen that the writer 
feels concerned, and questions his writing to p 
Hliteracy is no longer the unhappy prerogative of the developing countries, as certain industrialized coun- 
tries are beginning to realize that they are suffering from a relapse into illiteracy; but as we all know the map 
of illiteracy coincides almost exactly with that of poverty and that in the 25 least-developed countries the 
proportion of illiterates still exceeds 80 per cent. Despite the prodigious efforts made by so many countries 
of the Third World in the field of education, it is estimated that in 1980 there were still 322 million children 
in the world between the ages of 6 and 17 not attending school, and a world total (excluding China and the 
Democratic People’s Republic of Korea) of 814 million illiterates.

LITERACY AND EDUCATION. It is to be hoped that by 
adopting new structures, new admission procedures and new 
methods such as teaching by correspondence, by radio or by 
television, universities will open their doors wider to a new 
range of students, many of whom will not have been able to 
Jollow a normal academic career. It is to be hoped that they will 
organize meetings or seminars to inform and instruct the dif- 
Jerent social groups and wide sections of the population and 
that they will also play an active role in literacy campaigns, 
working side by side with the population, which will, more 
often than not, be a rural population, in the national develop- 
ment effort. oT TT CT a or 
The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and 
Unesco are helping the Government of Ethiopia to establish a 
functional literacy project for adults. Here a young boy is 
teaching his father to read with the aid of a textbook prepared 
  
p the point that he writes no more about this 
reality. Fuentes comments on this: “To 
abstain from writing would be to accept 
defeat, and one need only walk through the 
streets of Bogota, Mexico City or Lima to 
know that Latin America has drunk almost 
to the dregs the cup of defeat.” 
‘‘A continent of illiterates’’ has a greater 
need of writers than a continent sated with 
knowledge. Writing here is a refusal to ac- 
cept defeat. For Fuentes it also means bank- 
ing on liberty: “It means saying to yourself 
in the intimacy of the act of writing that it is 
imperative to keep alive the culture of the 
past, without which we have neither a real 
present nor an intelligible future; all this in 
the knowledge that we shall not achieve con- 
crete results, we shall not change the world 
by writing ten books or a thousand, and we 
shall receive no reward.”’ 
And so we have this gamble on liberty and 
on the future, for this continent will not 
LITERACY AND EDUCATION. In the 
developing countries that have recently 
gained their independence, under the 
lingering influence of systems inherited 
from the colonial period, education still 
often fails to some extent to match the real 
situations and needs. In many of those 
countries, the question of the language of 
instruction is still unsettled, even in primary 
school, and the use of curricula to maintain 
and reinforce cultural identity is an acute 
problem.

always be afflicted by the inevitability of il- 
literacy. Those who come later, perhaps the 
children of this period, will be entitled to 
call us to account. The writer will have to 
declare his books or his silence. 
Writing cannot be a soft option, for there 
is so much want and deprivation in our 
societies. The writer must be an all-purpose 
figure. The real world cries out for his atten- 
tion. So many appeals call for a response. 
He is needed in so many fields. He must 
show ingenuity and patience, for he was 
born among people who are sick of words. 
He must listen and he must act to satisfy the 
immediate need. This writer will be regarded 
as a journalist, lawyer, go-between, trade 
union spokesman, spokesman of a cause, 
public writer, prophet of hard times, a man 
involved in all his country’s struggles, a 
symbol, a myth, a social worker, and his 
country’s ambassador in the firmament of 
letters... The list is never-ending.

Everything remains to be done in these 
countries castigated by history, where 
ideologies come up against a complex reality 
which is more overwhelming and unex- 
pected than any fiction, in which imported 
models crumble or remain unused, their 
claims to universality intact. The writer is 
expected to be permanently on call, open to 
everything which shakes up and galvanizes 
this poor soil pregnant with millions of 
dreams, tales and images. He is not only re- 
quired to be a political militant making an 
impact on society; he must also be a poet, a 
creator, fertilized by this soil and by this 
people. 
The commitment of the artist implies 
solving his country’s problems at the same 
time as creating a work of art. This still has 
a meaning in countries which are con- 
fronted with life-and-death problems, not 
intellectual fads. In this respect the Peruvian 
writer Mario Vargal Llora has noted 
something which is valid not only for Latin 
America but for the Third World as a 
whole. ‘‘Elsewhere, to be a writer means 
primarily and often exclusively, assuming a 
personal responsibility for a body of work 
which, if artistically valid, will enrich the 
culture of the country in which it is created. 
In Peru and in other Latin American coun- 
tries, to be a writer means primarily, and 
often exclusively, assuming a social respon- 
sibility.”” There is virtually no escape from 
assuming the function. If you turn your 
back on this imperative, if you retreat into 
isolation, if you refuse to become involved

### 50013: The Writer between two worlds

in the life of the people, if you withdraw in- 
to selfish solitude, it is often taken as an 
avowal by the writer that he is not commit- 
ted, so that he is accused because of his 
silence and his remoteness of complicity 
with the forces of oppression. Not to de- 
nounce injustice, to be silent, is unthinkable 
for a writer mandated to speak out and write 
by a continent of illiterates. Literature is ex- 
pected to be useful, operational and ver- 
satile in its functions, roles ‘and powers. 
Literature takes its cue from science, just as 
it makes inroads on ideology. It becomes an 
activity in the service of truth. 
If this conception of literary activity 
relates to reality by making the writer a 
repository of information with his eyes fixed 
on the outside world, then it causes a major 
misunderstanding. For the main thing is 
forgotten, namely how to write, how to 
create. 
Should we then go far in the other direc- 
tion and regard literature as a pure stylistic 
exercise or a lifeless tour de force? The 
vogue for the French nouveau roman open- 
ed up several possibilities for the renewal of 
academic writing, but it also stripped 
literature of flesh and blood. When I read I 
love to feel behind the words a stretch of 
land, a breathing body, life going on 
somewhere. In some novels, however, the - 
belated products of this fashion, the sterility 
of the text corresponds to a social situation 
in which land and body have perhaps ceased 
to breathe. 
There is a widespread misunderstanding 
about where the writer’s commitment lies. 
To militate in a political party or organiza- 
tion is one thing; to write while taking part 
in politics as well is another. The one does 
not exclude the other. But it is rare that the 
two combine in such a way as not to be 
mutually harmful and do not create con- 
fusion and misunderstandings. One does 
not have to be an artist to feel concerned by 
what breaks and stifles the voice of a people. 
This is a matter for concern of every citizen 
who refuses submission and resignation. If 
he also happens to be a writer, then so much 
the better, for in principle he has the means, 
however limited, to put up a better 
resistance to barbarism and to participate 
through his work as a writer in affirming his 
people’s culture, which is itself threatened 
over a period of time with asphyxia, abduc- 
tion and death. 
As for the writer who deliberately chooses 
to live in exile, he leaves far behind him the 
prevailing stagnation, the temptation to bit- 
terness and inactivity. He sets out alone, 
neither adventurer nor hero but someone 
who decides to set his eyes on other 
horizons, at his own risk. Whatever he does 
is bound to be wrong! If exile leads to 
nothing, he is wrong, If exile brings him suc- 
cess, he is wrong. The child who leaves his 
family connexions by the wayside is not 
forgiven. He will not be pardoned for many 
things, and whatever happens an effort will 
be made to make him feel guilty, to make 
him feel that he is a bit of a traitor, especial- 
ly if he succeeds in being a productive 
creative artist. He will be blamed for having 
it too easy. He will be the target of am- 
bivalent and often unchanging feelings, 
nourished by a host of vague and obscure 
ideas. 
But voluntary exile, the need to go 
elsewhere to encounter other realities and 
other worlds, is preferable to marking time, 
which is often the prelude to a slow death, 
sterility, desiccation and self-absorption. 
Others would say, ‘It’s better to mark time 
with your own people than to take refuge 
abroad.” And so the question should be 
defined in political terms, not in affective 
and moral terms. 
Why have so many writers and artists 
from our countries felt the need at one time 
or another to leave their own country in 
order to live and work, temporarily or per- 
manently, in another society? Why have 
they been able to create elsewhere? Is it not 
because in other countries they have found 
conditions and structures propitious for 
writing, painting, meeting other people, ex- 
changing ideas, in a word, for communica- 
tion? Have they not found elsewhere what is 
most lacking in their own country: rivalry, a 
critical spirit, freedom, the sense of dif- 
ference that stimulates creativity? Of 
course, it may be countered, but why not 
create these conditions, these basic struc- 
tures, in one’s own country? True, it is a 
priori easier to leave than to stay. For stay- 
ing is not an easy option; one must fight, 
often alone, against oppression, against the 
ugliness and weight of bureaucracy. The ar- - 
tist must fight to avoid the snare held out by 
those who want to entice him on to their side 
and use him to their own ends. He must 
struggle with himself, and resist all kinds of 
temptations, discouragement, fatigue and 
indifference. Mediocrity becomes dangerous 
when it takes root, becomes accepted, and 
spreads. It is contagious. The energy and the 
instinct to react are lost. 
So the writer should remain vigilant and 
continue to believe in his creative powers. 
. He should barricade himself against the out- 
side world, confining himself to an almost 
schizophrenic universe which may ultimate- 
ly be his only solution. He should take 
refuge in an inner exile, withdraw from im- 
mediate reality, fight to survive and create 
his own working environment. But all this 
often means that he loses the power to use 
words. Inner exile also means losing oneself 
in social gossip, in drink, in oblivion, in a 
slow decline into narcissism. 
To be far away does not necessarily mean 
to be absent. To go away is another way of 
establishing links with one’s land and peo- 
ple. This kind of exile may be fruitful, or at 
any rate not systematically negative. It is not 
the writer who lives in exile who should be 
pilloried, but the political structure which 
respects neither his difference nor his 
freedom. Wherever it is produced, the work 
of a writer or an artist returns in one way or 
another to the land of its origin. 
But when exile becomes a way of thinking 
and of becoming ensnared in the toils of an 
unhappy conscience, when it severs a man 
from his deepest roots, when it becomes an 
end in itself and submerges the individual in 
a set of problems which ought not really to 
concern him, then exile becomes alienation. 
It returns to the mother country another 
person, often a stranger who has lost the 
capacity of wonder: a wreck apparently in 
good health.

munal life in a rural village into the chaos 
and loneliness of life in the big city. 
It is all there in written literature. The 
peasant who follows the mirage of prosperi- 
ty and happiness in the big city only to find 
the opposite is a familiar character in many 
a novel from the developing world. What 
often is not stated is that such a character is 
actually escaping from the hell of rural 
poverty and misery into the Hades of urban 
poverty and misery, in both cases brought 
about by ruthless exploitation. But even 
where this is stated, the schema of rural ur- 
ban dichotomy as the basis of analysis of the 
problems of culture in developing countries 
remains, and the crisis of culture is still seen 
in terms of a conflict between tradition and 
modernity. 
Two misleading assumptions underlie the 
schema. Modern industry, science and 
technology are seen as being opposed to 
tradition and peasant cultures. The destruc- 
tion of tradition or aspects of tradition and 
peasant culture is seen as necessarily evil. 
The beauty of rural culture must rest on a 
foundation of poverty and abject want. But 
surely modern science and technology, 
depending on their organization, ownership 
and control, now make possible a total 
economic transformation of the countryside 
and thus the erection of a whole people’s 
culture on a structure of prosperity instead 
of backwardness. 
Moreover, far from destroying tradition, 
modern technology (e.g. Video, Cinema, 
Television, Radio) makes possible a 
reclamation of the positive aspects of tradi- 
tion and peasant cultures. Africa for in- 
stance has a rich tradition of oral literature. 
Take the tale, for instance. The oral nar- 
rative was often accompanied by mime and 
song. With video, film, or television, it is 
now possible to reclaim this tradition 
through an integration of the visual (e.g. 
animated cartoons) and the verbal (i.e. the 
voice telling the tale and the accompanying 
music). 
The same is true in theatre. African pea- 
sant theatre relied heavily on song, dance 
and mime, and these can now be permanent- 
ly captured on the screen. Thus not only is it 
possible to democratize access to this 
heritage—more people can be told the tale 
at the same time—but even more crucial, it 
is possible to integrate the national cultures 
within the geographic State. 
The other assumption is that the rural and 
the urban are two self-contained islands and 
a character who walks from one to the other 
is actually journeying across two unlinked 
entities. But the two are a creation of each 
other. The urban is a creation of the rural as 
much as the rural is a creation of the urban. 
The peasantry had to be alienated from the 
soil and be driven into towns, that is, they 
had to be proletarianized before the modern 
city could be born. But where under feudal 
and semi-feudal systems, the town was 
under the sway of the countryside, the 
modern city which emerged with capitalism, 
the city of gold, became the master of the 
rural of which it had been born and bred. 
“The bourgeoisie’’, Marx wrote of 
nineteenth-century Europe, ‘‘has sub- 
jected the country to the rule of the 
towns. It has created enormous cities, has

LITERACY AND EDUCATION. Writing has been without doubt the most radical and 
creative of man’s inventions. Not because it could be said, by itself, to be synonymous 
with culture for there exist rich oral cultures, and all written cultures are partially compos- 
ed of orally transmitted traditions, but because writing adds to culture a fundamental 
dimension. This is the possibility of infinite self-enrichment and the capacity for abstrac- 
tion through which a culture can both adapt constantly to change, while preserving the 
most characteristic features of its heritage, and establish, beyond the limits of time and 
space, a constant flow of communication with others. Whereas oral tradition is a means of 
passing on a cultural heritage, only the written word can make that heritage bear fruit. 
But with the introduction of machinery, the implements of work become a stronger deter- 
mining factor than manpower in the productive process because they incorporate more 
and more scientific and technological elements, and this creates insuperable obstacles for 
the illiterate population. Complex machinery remains a closed world to them. Thus 
literacy must count as one of the few basic, irreducible needs of modern man simply 
because it governs his access to progress. :

"tions of bourgeois, 
towns, so it has made barbarian and semi- 
barbarian countries dependent on the 
civilized ones, nations of peasants on na- 
the East on the 
West’. 
With the evolution of capitalism into the 
higher stage of imperialism, the rural and 
urban sectors of the nations of peasants 
became even more subjected to the rule of 
the nations of bourgeoisie, and with what 
results: the subject nations—the majority of 
the population—were now reduced to the 
idiocy of the new urban and rural life. 
This subjection of the nations of peasants 
to the nations of bourgeoisie is the heart of 
the matter when discussing problems of the 
developing countries—economic, political 
or cultural. 
But by posing the problems of culture in 
the developing world in terms of a conflict 
between modernity and tradition, between 
the rural and the urban, thus concentrating 
on secondary contradictions, we are 
avoiding the real issues behind the crisis. 
What are the real forces behind modernity 
and tradition, the urban and the rural? We 
have, in other words, to see the whole 
problem (modernity, tradition, rural, ur- 
ban) in a historical perspective. 
This would reveal to us that the major 
contradiction in the Third World is between 
national identity and imperialist domina- 
tion. The developing world with its 
economic, political and cultural backward- 
ness, its massive poverty, illiteracy and 
disease, is a creation of imperialism in its 
colonial and neo-colonial stages. The 
developing world can in fact be defined as 
all those countries in Asia, Africa and Latin 
America which have been underdeveloped 
by imperialism, those countries whose 
economy, politics and culture have been and 
continue to be dominated by Western im- 
perialist nations. This in essence means the 
economic, political and cultural subjection 
of the whole population of the dominated 
countries to the ruling bourgeois classes of 
the dominating nations. 
“The bourgeoisie’’, wrote Marx and 
Engels, ‘‘by the rapid development of all 
instruments and production, by the im- 
mensely facilitated means of communica- 
| tion, draws all, even the most barbarian, 
nations into civilization. The cheap prices 
of its commodities are the heavy artillery 
with which it batters down all chinese 
walls, with which it forces the barbarian’s 
intensely obstinate hatred of foreigners to 
capitulate. It compels all nations, on pain 
of extinction, to adopt the bourgeois 
mode of production; it compels them to 
introduce what it calls civilization into 
their midst, to become bourgeois 
themselves. In a word, it creates a world 
after its own image’.

A world after its own image: this it tried 
to achieve not only through economic 
exploitation and political subjugation 
but more importantly, through cultural 
domination. 
But the process created its opposite: the 
economic, political and cultural struggle for 
national independence and total liberation. 
In the colonies and neo-colonies, there in 
fact emerged two cultures in mortal conflict: 
foreign imperialist cultures and national 
patriotic cultures. Thus there emerged, out 
of the different nationalities often in- 
habiting one geographic State, a people's 
literature, music, dance, theatre, art, inp

» fierce struggle against foreign literature, 
theatre, music, art imposed on colonies, 
semi-colonies and neo-colonies. 
This to me is still the real and fundamen- 
tal conflict of cultures: a national patriotic 
culture in struggle against foreign imperialist 
cultures. Other contradictions, between the 
urban and the rural, between the different 
nationalities, are secondary and can only be 
properly appreciated within the context of 
the larger, basic contradiction. 
In this war of cultures, the people try to 
find their roots in the patriotic traditions of 
their culture mostly kept alive by the peasan- 
try in their songs, poems, theatre and 
dances. The foreign imperialist culture tries 
to find a stronghold in the cities mas- 
querading under notions of modernity and 
progress. 
This is not an accident. The native 
bourgeoisie through which imperialism 
works in the colonies and neo-colonies 
dwells in the city. Very often it controls the 
State instruments of copersuasion and pro- 
paganda. In their State-controlled theatres, 
cinemas, T.V. stations, radio, they only 
allow foreign programmes, while in the 
education system they advocate the use of 
foreign languages, and the study of foreign 
literature only. The impoverished, exploited 
peasantry dwells in the countryside. That is 
why the struggle between national and 
foreign cultures appears on the surface as a 
conflict between the rural and the urban, or 
between tradition and modernity. 
But what is really modern is the new na- 
tional cultures emerging out of the struggle 
for total liberation, a culture rooted in the 
patriotic and heroic traditions of the people. 
This is better seen in the resistance poetry 
and songs and theatre among workers in the 
urban areas of the developing world. It is a 
fighting culture, a resistance culture, and 
though fusing different elements, it is in 
basic harmony with the resistance culture of 
the countryside. The urban and the rural 
struggles find this harmony in their opposi- 
tion to both foreign imperialist exploitation 
and domination and internal exploitation 
and oppression. The urban worker and the 
rural peasant are the basis and creators of 
truly national cultures in the developing 
world. 
What then is the crisis of culture in Africa 
and in the developing world as a whole? 
The real crisis of culture in Africa is still 
the imperialist domination of our economy, 
politics and culture—no country can con- 
sider itself free as long as its economy and 
culture are dominated by foreigners. 
A pre-requisite of Africa’s cultural 
development is therefore a continued strug- 
gle for its economic and political liberation 
from all vestiges of imperialism. This also 
means a continued struggle against the com- 
prador ruling class through whom im- 
perialism continues to dominate the lives of 
millions of peasants and workers of the 
developing world. 
A new world economic and political order 
would mean a new world cultural order and 
this would see the flowering of a great 
modern culture in Africa and the rest of the 
developing world, a culture that has roots in 
the dynamic progressive aspects of a na- 
tional tradition while remaining open to the 
progressive and humanist cultural element 
all over the world.

of cultural bower 
by Augusto Roa Bastos 
Wa it comes to the philosophy 
and practice of cultural power, 
the niceties of literary creation 
count for little. No question of getting tied 
up in superfluous classifications. The 
publicity apparatus of cultural power can 
raise up mediocrity and creative nullity to 
the level of apparent virtues of the first 
order. 
Within this cosmic vision of profit, a 
book is a book. And with each “‘successful’’ 
book all of literature is originated, born 
daily. In certain cases, it is not the intrinsic 
merits of a text which matter, but the epic of 
its launching, its promotion and dissemina- 
tion in the most complete gamut of possible 
combinations. Sometimes—nearly always in 
fact—the promoters and vendors of such 
best-sellers show more imagination than 
their authors. Indeed, the best-seller in- 
dustry itself could serve as a hypertrophied 
_ example of the manipulation of the pub- 
lishing industry by cultural power—an ex- 
ample which, to a greater or lesser extent 
dominates the world literary market. 
As is the case with the activities of the 
multinationals in other fields, cultural 
power (a semantic barbarism which points 
to its depredatory origins) sets up its 
autonomous rules within imperial metrop- 
olises, ignoring or crossing frontiers and 
political barriers as if they were so much 
smoke or, alternately, making use of them. 
Both in this connexion and in the similarity 
of their goals—conquest of markets, profit 
and economic and political domination— 
the now classic model of arms-selling gives 
an approximate idea of the way in which 
multinationals operate as a cultural power. 
In the case of the book industry itself, 
from the head offices in metropolitan cen- 
tres to the network of subsidiaries located in 
the strategic centres of peripheral cultures, it 
is cultural power which dictates the rules of 
the game, 
As a result, the oldest, most solid and 
most prestigious publishing concerns 
(publishers, publishing and distribution 
outlets, the old and noble profession of the 
bookseller as guide and mentor of readers, 
library systems, the production of educa-- 
tional text-books, specialized institutions, 
foundations, etc.) are annexed, blocked, or 
subjected to its investment dictates. It par- 
ticipates in, controls or takes over all of the 
media (cinema, radio, television, written 
press) which can contribute to the expansion 
of its business, as well as subsidiary con-

cerns such as the paper and printing in- 
dustries. It also has at its disposal the 
arsenal of modern technology (computers, 
data banks, etc.), the main branches of 
which form part of its complex industrial 
network. 
In the so-called peripheral countries, 
cultural power has almost totally eliminated 
the independent publishing houses which 
strove to maintain a balanced exchange bet- 
ween national and foreign literatures. 
In such conditions the operative strategy 
of cultural power, its philosophy of action, 
determines taste on the basis of statistics. In- 
deed, the distinctive mark of a culture can 
be made to change to serve its interests. The 
best-seller industry already referred to il- 
lustrates the extent of the devastating in- 
fluence which has changed the modes and 
values of a conception .and tradition of 
book-culture in a number of countries 
which rank among the most important in 
the world. Nevertheless, it should not be 
thought that its privileged monopoly status 
has made cultural power something which is 
pyramidal in form and importance. Its real 
potential is rooted in the idea of competition 
between equals, in its capacity to associate 
itself with other forces, to elaborate itself in- 
definitely, to infiltrate everywhere. 
The objective of these consortia is not 
dispersion but ever greater concentration. 
This also holds true for their assets in depen- 
dent countries. The increasing bankruptcies 
of independent publishing houses, the ap- 
pearance and disappearance of others which 
emerge and act as fronts or dissuasive 
elements are a sure sign that multinationals 
are running the show. 
An independent publisher—one of the 
few who still fights the battle for a just and 
harmonious relationship between authors, 
publishers and the public in the territory of 
book activity occupied by multinationals— 
was able to confirm the following, well- 
founded facts: ‘‘The way the current system 
works (in terms of its penetration by 
multinationals) simply favours the entry in- 
to the market of the large publishing houses 
which are themselves subsidiaries of 
transnational complexes. These multina- 
tional enterprises find a very large potential 
market, a public avid for reading material, 
and using their vast experience they produce 
an unlimited administrative and financial in- 
frastructure and an international distribu- 
tion network”. 
In the case of Latin-American cultures 
which are to a lesser or greater degree depen- 
dent, what is at stake is more than a certain 
statistic concerning taste. It is the very in- 
tegrity of these cultures which is threatened 
and, within them, the development of 
literatures which are the expression of their 
unity and identity in spite of the inequalities, 
the lack of synchronization and the absence 
of communication which characterizes our 
cultural destiny. 
The synthesis of these imbalances is ef- 
fected, or has been effected, by the dialec- 
tical process involving culture and society, 
tradition and the avant-garde, the local and 
the universal. However, if such a synthesis is 
to be truly fertile, it must be effected along 
the lines of force of a common process, that 
is to say, along the lines of force of our unity 
and identity, of our Spanish-American 
character. 
To talk in terms of a process implies 
recognition of the existence of a set of cor- 
relations and shared variations in constant 
mutation: the interpretation of the vital 
rhythms of communities united by a com- 
mon language and subjected to the same or 
analogous historical imperatives. So it is 
that the well-worn concept of identity ceases 
to be an idealistic and ‘‘ideologized” 
abstraction and comes to express correctly 
not the invariables of an unchanging and 
inward-looking reality, but the coherence of 
this conjuncture of relationships in non-stop 
transformation. 
Identity is thus unity in continuity of a 
characterological complex which defines its 
essence in action, the features of its physical 
and spiritual personality in its plans, suc- 
cesses and failures, and in its manner of fac- 
ing factors extraneous to its nature, while at 
the same time assimilating those which seem 
constructive and enriching, whatever their 
source. In other words, it refuses a passive 
and blind acceptance of dominant cultures. 
In this connexion, cultural colonialism is 
not only an imposition, it is also a dazzling 
fascination, a compulsive need to imitate the 
prestigious seigneurial and imperial stan- 
dards and forms. To be dominated cultural- 
ly is to be seduced. At times raped. The old 
dispute as to whether the effects of the 
dominant influences of central cultures on 
surrounding ones are formative or deform- 
ing has been settled by the cultural facts 
themselves. 
These facts are deforming in the sense 
that local cultures see servitude to the forms, 
models, procedures and customs of the cen- 
tral cultures as an imposition or a joy. They 
are enriching on condition that the local 
cultures react critically and convert them in- 
to catalyzers of their own spirit and 
character. It is not a question either of the 
extreme opposite—of absurdly restoring the 
indigenous cultures and of sinking into the

### 50017: The Machinery of cultural power

» chaos of a local ethnocentricity which would 
be ill-advised and artificial. Neither does it 
mean blindly and stubbornly rejecting the 
norms from outside, which made it possible 
for us to construct our Creole cathedrals, to 
develop our material civilization and the 
most creative aspects of our mixed culture. 
But they also help us to recognize our 
cultural identity in the process of racial in- 
termingling and to orient our liberation 
struggles in all fields. 
In the field of fictional literature—poetry, 
novels, theatre—these models and foreign 
norms, the work of the great poets, novelists 
and dramatists of the central cultures, once 
the stage of experimental imitation was 
passed, that is to say, once the genuine spirit 
of our literatures had been recovered, have 
contributed in a decisive way to the develop- 
ment of these literatures in closely-defined 
periods and epochs. 
In this problematic arising out of the ac- 
tive and vital identity of our cultures the 
functions and responsibilities of the élites 
are obvious. But it is equally clear that iden- 
tity understood in this way is not the ex- 
clusive apanage of these élites. 
Such an identity is forged and constructed 
in the fire of social energy by the élites, but 
also by the untutored masses who lack ex- 
pression. No genuine culture can reduce 
itself to the quintessentially, chemically pure 
distillation of élitist values nor can it do 
without the life-giving breath of popular 
culture, the powerful and obscure palpita- 
tion of the submerged masses whose lack of 
culture is a specific form of the culture of 
marginalization, of backwardness and op- 
pression. This also holds true for indigenous 
cultures, which are more coherent (in spite 
of their unstructured form and the threat of 
extinction hanging over them) in the impure 
context of our mestizo culture. 
It is precisely this dichotomy between the 
“‘cultivated’’ and the ‘‘uncultivated’’ and 
the variables of its interaction within a given 
society and within societies at large which 
enriches the real subsoil of Latin-American 
identity: the illuminated part and the 
shadowy part of its transitional culture link- 
ed to the vicissitudes of its history under the 
sign of economic and cultural dependence. 
The ‘““massification’’ of books produced 
by the cultural industry does not imply, or 
announce, the establishment of a mass 
culture. Quite the contrary. The objectives 
of the entrepreneurial economy, in the 
original sense of an economy of en- 
trepreneurs, are not to create a mass culture, 
but to extract massive dividends from 
investments. 
Such objectives have even less to do with 
the abolition of the élitist taste (or at least 
the élitist predilections) of bourgeois 
culture, In fact, what counts in this context, 
which happens to be its principal theatre of 
operations, are the more efficient diffusing 
nuclei of prestige and sacralization: 
academies, institutes, influential per- 
sonalities, writers who are at the same time 
critics, etc. 
Conscious of the role which the local and 
international intelligentsias perform, the 
cultural power uses them unscrupulously. 
In the case of local élites, the availability 
and co-operation of their members tend 
naturally to be put at the service of the 
dispensers of prestige and material 
remuneration as if it were a mark of distinc- 
tion. In general, they are the most willing 
and effective guides, intermediaries and 
assessors who prepare the ground for the 
multinationals to penetrate national ter- 
ritories with a licence to plunder. 
As for the élites of the central countries or 
those which continue to perform the role of 
dispensers of «culture and advanced 
technology thanks to the competition which 
permits and promotes the division into rival 
blocs of the so-called First World, the com- 
plicity of the intellectuals and writers with 
the factors of power (political power, 
economic power, cultural power) is a 
notorious and inveterate fact; one could 
almost say it has become institutionalized. 
As in other fields of power, cultural 
power can only unfold its maximal possibil- 
ities of predominance by engrafting its 
structures onto the apparatus of an intellec- 
tual bureaucracy which is attached 
ideologically to the philosophy and interests 
of that power. and which always, or nearly 
always, acts in collaboration with the 
political power, whatever its political orien- 
tation: from the reactionary right to the sup- 
posed openings to the left in the unchanging 
framework of bourgeois democracy. 
This apparatus of clercs (which has 
replaced the old corporations of elders 
which existed in feudal societies) dominates 
all the institutions of official cultures: 
academies, universities, libraries, cultural 
organisms of every kind, foundations, 
literary contests, specialized criticism, radio 
and television programmes, etc. 
In such conditions, it is not the reader 
who looks for, and selects his books. The 
latter are imposed on him in accordance 
with an indiscriminate programming which, 
in its consequences, is actually discrimina- 
tory; the reader is chosen by the omniscient 
index of the microprocessor in the prospec- 
tive field of the calculation of probabilities. 
The abstract image of this average reader 
is projected by the computers in virtue of 
certain forms tested in the market and in any 
event imposed upon it. The author-text- . 
reader relationship undergoes, as a result, a 
profound change under the impact of the 
mass-produced, itemized book and its 
publicity which presents it not as an offer, 
but as an order. No revealing testimony 
about this distorsion is available to the 
average reader. He accepts it unawares, just 
as he accepts each day the ‘‘revealed 
truths’’, the propagandizing gospels of the 
mass media on underwear, on varieties of 
canned goods or balanced foods for cats 
and dogs. Even so-called cultivated readers 
end up by giving in to this compulsion which 
works on the primary instincts of the 
consumer. 
In contrast with this real situation, ‘‘How 
many books are not really published but just 
churned out!” exclaimed one independent 
French publisher who has experienced from 
the inside the fight against the giants of 
publishing. The latter are a very special 
species whom Swift would have castigated 
had he been alive today and witnessed our 
era in which millions and millions of Lillipu- 
tians are enslaved by the strong-arm-men of 
money. Having appropriated the Gutenberg 
Galaxy, they have arranged a match or at 
least a cross-breeding operation with the 
audiovisual galaxy, thereby nullifying 
McLuhan’s prophecy about the death of the 
book. 
HM Augusto Roa Bastos 
LITERACY AND EDUCATION. 
From the standpoint of lifelong educa- 
tion itself, considered not as further 
vocational training but rather as an 
overall process of education, starting 
with the earliest stage and continuing 
throughout life, the development of in- 
formal and non-formal types of educa- 
tion, and better co-ordination between 
them and the formal systems, also seem 
to meet the wish to bring about greater 
interpenetration between education and 
society as a whole. This would make for 
that diversification of the content, 
methods, structures and levels of educa- 
tion and training required by the 
modern world. New questions arise as 
to the choices to be made regarding im-

how and to what extent a society can 
rapidly acquire modern science and 
technology without losing its central 
values and internal cohesion. Even 
more than the transfer of technology, 
the decisive factor in long-term progress 
seems to be the transfer of knowledge. 
Full control even of the choice of 
technologies appears unattainable 
unless an adequate domestic research 
capacity and store of knowledge are 
there to be drawn on. There is here cer- 
tainly a common challenge that will 
have to be faced by most 
societies—whether industrialized or 
developing—in the years ahead: to nar- 
row the margin of incomprehension, 
not to say the cleavage, between the 
world of technology and the mass of the 
people, and to ensure the dynamic in-. 
tegration of the achievements of 
modern technology into the reality of 
the underlying cultures. A major task 
confronting specialists in the social and 
human sciences is to find points of in- 
teraction and reconciliation between 
technology and culture; an equally im- 
portant task for educational systems is 
to narrow the gap between ‘‘the two 
cultures’ by blending elements drawn 
Jrom the “‘humanities®’ into the training 
of scientists, engineers and 
technologists and raising the level of 
scientific and technological knowledge 
in so-called general education.

of spiritual and material values, at- 
tainments and beliefs, knowledge 
and skills, which produce a corpus with 
a distinctive identity. This body of thought, 
behaviour and social customs is transmitted 
by the group or groups practising it to suc- 
ceeding generations as its ‘‘culture”’. 
Inter-cultural communication is not new. 
Throughout the millennia man has travelled 
in groups or singly, and his culture has been 
influenced or has influenced other social 
groups with which contact was made. 
Trade and immigration, exploration, 
religion, colonial conquest have all been 
promoters of cultural change and interac- 
tion. This is intensified today, when 
technology makes even the most remote, 
hermetic ethnic groups accessible, vulner- 
able, and their cultures subject to change. 
One factor in this increasing inter-’ 
communication is the ongoing woman 
revolution. In all cultures and social groups, 
womankind is undergoing a process of 
change; and this changed status is occurring 
through both a conscious movement on the 
part of women, and the increasing mastery 
of technology. 
Woman, as well as man, is a cultural and 
economic reality. Yet all studies of historical 
development, in the main, ignore or obscure 
the role of woman within her own cultural 
pattern. She is treated as marginal, not 
pivotal, to the historical development of her 
group. 
Yet, in the maintenance or rejection of 
cultural values, in the affective and physical 
shaping of the children-successors to the 
culture, in the transmission and communica- 
tion of skills and knowledge of all kinds, in 
the acceptance of new economic and social 
developments, the role of woman is fun- 
damental to any society and to the cultural 
survival of any group. 
Woman as creator of wealth has been 
totally ignored. Yet the development of

civilization, from spinning and weaving by 
hand to the industrial manufactures of to- 
day, require woman’s labour. Woman the 
consumer is also a factor in the economics 
of any country. Throughout the ages, the 
role of woman as wealth accumulator has 
been slighted. Her role as traditional teacher 
of arts and language and skills, in dance and 
music and singing and many other fields, is 
taken for granted and not properly valued. 
As a keeper of tradition, as an educator 
and communicator, and in the creation of 
new needs, new aspirations, in literature and 
poetry and painting, in science and in 
politics, woman has played a role in the 
enrichment and continuity of cultures. 
Yet the vocabulary of so many of these 
cultures is a masculine one; expressing man 
MINORITIES AND MIGRANTS 
Class and racial and cultural features distort the very conceptions of literacy, knowledge and 
intelligence, and, since these cannot be truly objectively measured, the children of migrant 
and minority groups become the victims of institutionalized procedures that preserve the 
status quo. The failure of the migrant in the classroom is therefore a continual self-fulfilling 
prophecy, generated by widespread and often imperceptible discriminatory practices.

deciding, ruling, designing existence; leaving 
woman a ‘‘marginal majority’ to silence 
and to submission. 
The oppression of womankind is, in the 
history of humanity, the very first of all op- 
pressions exercised by the male sex towards 
the fellow-being. ‘Before all other exploita- 
tions came the exploitation of the female” 
says Engels. This universal exploitation 
shows a striking uniformity in its patterns of 
feminine oppression and enslavement, 
despite the variety of the devices employed. 
Not least, indeed of first importance, is the 
use of physical strength, since physical 
strength was accounted, for so long, a male 
“‘superiority’’. Even today, among civilized 
societies, the use and abuse of physical force 
goes on. From mutilation such as foot- 
MIGRANTS. In both the towns and countryside of the developed world 
migrants form a wretched population of outcasts from society, virtual 
outlaws, who are socially and culturally excluded. This sub-proletariat 
lives precariously in the worst possible social conditions, in unhealthy, in- 
sanitary dwellings, with no cultural advantages, receiving little or no in- 
struction or professional training and, as a result, working in unfulfilling, 
ifl-paid jobs.

binding to other forms of cloistering; from 
sexual slavery to the ill-treatment of 
widows, from rape (and the scandalous 
lightness with which it is still regarded even 
in the west) to wife-beating... physical force 
is still one of the methods used to cow 
woman into submission as an inferior. 
But it is in the domain of the mental and 
the metaphysical that this oppression has 
been most subtly and tenaciously developed 
into ‘‘cultural values’’. The utilization of 
pseudo-virtues, man-made; of so-called 
“sacred” or ‘““God-given’’ laws; of man-made 
laws, legalizing the violation of woman as a 
person... all this still goes on, and still in- 
habits the many cultures of the world today. 
Religion has played its role in this 
shameful oppression. Christianity has, for 
centuries, been the total negation of the 
teachings of Jesus Christ, who elevated 
woman to her rightful place as an equal per- 
son. Confucianism denied woman her 
human identity; she was an object, the pro- 
perty of the male. 
Yet Taoism, and Buddhism, as well as 
Jesus, were world changers recognizing the 
essential equality of woman, Taoism is 
founded on the duality of the universe; the 
Ying and the Yang, male and female, equal, 
inseparable, complementary. To diminish 
the one is to deny the other. 
For centuries, in the West, learned men 
and renowned scholars have found abundant p

THE STATUS OF WOMEN 
Any attempt to change the status of women elicits the expression of 
deeply rooted opposition and attempts to create equal educational 
and better employment opportunities are no exception. The 
arguments justifying inaction are numerous but usually based on a 
certain conception of women’s traditional role and a fear that, if 
this is changed, there will be a breakdown of moral and cultural 
values. 
(1) In societies where many if not most women are employed, they 
do not enjoy the same opportunities for advancement and are not 
prepared through their education and training for higher status 
jobs; it is acceptable for a woman to be a teacher but not an ad- 
ministrator, a laboratory assistant but not an engineer, a secretary 
but not an executive, a field labourer but not a tractor driver or a 
farm manager.

(2) In some societies it is feared that promoting literacy among 
women will lead to dire consequences. In others, primary and 
secondary general education for girls is accepted as natural, but 
education for employment or for the exercise of a profession is 
“ regarded as useless and perhaps undesirable.

(3) While conventional statistics show that women’s working roles 
are, at best, secondary or complementary to the family income, the 
reality in developing countries is that women increasingly are the de 
facto heads of households with full responsibility for their own and 
their children’s survival,

» justification both for racial discrimina- 
tion—the exploitation of the other human 
being—and for the oppression of 
woman—the inferior being. 
The establishment of cultural patterns 
based upon woman’s inferiority is 
widespread, and it has been continuous for 
three millennia. 
This intra-cultural injustice is the fun- 
damental flaw, vitiating all dialogue, all 
communication, not only between the two 
halves of humankind, but also between all 
human beings. 
Today, an opportunity is given to redress 
this injustice, through the ongoing woman 
revolution which is taking place. 
As we confront a world where inter- 
cultural dialogue must be based on essential 
equality, the share that womankind must 
have in the decision-making processes of 
shaping a jus. future is crucial. 
In other words, intra-cultural equality 
must be achieved, to make inter-cultural 
equality, a dialogue between equal human 
beings, valid, responsible, and fruitful. 
Otherwise the same pattern of superior/ 
inferior, dominant/repressed, will continue, 
both materially and spiritually, to poison 
relations between humans. 
  
       
    
In the struggles for national liberation of 
our twentieth century, as many women as 
men fought side by side; but when in- 
dependence was achieved women, even 
those leaders who were an inspiration to men 
to do battle for justice and freedom, were

role in the revolution; and when Liberation 
came, they were not returned to feudal op- 
pression. Indeed, China is one of the coun- 
tries in the Third World where the 
authorities in power back woman as an equal 
person to the fullest possible extent. 
“Without the emancipation of woman, 
man cannot be liberated’’ said Mao Tsetung, 
thus echoing the French social theorist 
Charles Fourier who in 1793 had said that all 
social progress is conditioned by the progress 
of woman towards her own emancipation. 
Giséle Halimi, the renowned woman

p of affluent America, or elsewhere, though 
different in degree, the aims are the same: to 
become full persons, in their own right. 
As Roger Garaudy says in his book For 
The Advent Of Woman: ‘‘All these 
movements [for feminine liberation] are 
one... with a global character... far more so 
than the national liberation struggles have 
been....”” The woman revolution is by its 
very nature international, global, inter- 
cultural and intra-cultural.   
Technological progress has helped the ris- 
ing consciousness of woman's liberation. A 
major factor has been contraception. Birth 
control, pioneered in the early twentieth 
century by a woman (Margaret Sanger) is to- 
day known, accepted, by women the whole 
world over. 1t is changing, altering the con- 
cepts of woman towards herself. No longer 
a mere breeding machine, it enables her to 
assume her own personality and potential. It 
has, for the first time, given her the right to 
own her own body; to decide when she 
wants a child, or not. 
This change in mentality is enormously 
significant. In other ways new technologies 
have made obsolete the ‘‘superiority’’ of 
physical strength. Skill and intelligence is 
displayed by women working computers and 
other machines, or engaging in work of high 
intellectual calibre. And all this merely 
points to one thing: to the end of the tragic 
waste of woman's potential, inventiveness, 
and intelligence. The world has indeed im- 
poverished itself for some millennia by 
discriminating against the brain power of 
half of humanity, but now the opportunity 
has come to utilize it. 
Woman's intelligence and her right to 
participate in decision-making affecting the 
world’s future do not mean a competition 
with man, but a partnership. Her approach 
to problems will certainly be different, and 
her contribution lies precisely in that 
difference, — - 
Whereas masculine sociologists and 
philosophers tend to start their mental ex- 
ploration from intellectualized assumptions, 
women are more likely to proceed from liv- 
ed experience than abstract ideation, from 
observation, and concrete aspects of living, 
rather than from ‘‘rational reasoning’’ or 
“logic”. 
This used to be derided as “‘feminine in- 2 AY, 
stinct’’ or “‘intuition’’, a ‘‘biological’’, non- 
intellectual expression of the woman’s x 
mind. But perhaps this is what the world ® 
needs, and certainly woman’s perception of COPA DEL MUNDO DE FUTBOL hs 4 ESPANA 82 
inter-cultural problems will be all the more 
enriching because her wisdom and per- 
cipience will not make her reject what is dif-

all shared much the same way of life in 
neighbouring valleys, were separated by 
linguistic differences so great that they 
might have been living on different con- 
tinents. Every auw/, or village, had its own 
local tongue; none in any way resembled 
the others. 
But no alphabet in the world offered 
characters that could be used to transcribe 
all the languages of Daghestan. And when, 
at the beginning of the Soviet period, at- 
tempts were made to adapt the Russian 
   
alphabet for this purpose, it proved neces- 
sary to add new characters and combina- 
tions of characters to transform speech into 
writing. 
Today, the people of Daghestan, num- 
bering some two million, speak altogether 
more than thirty different languages; 
newspapers and literary periodicals appear 
in five of them; seven may be heard on the 
stage of the national theatres; and books 
are published in nine. The country’s poets 
write not only in the Avar language which, 
although the Avarians themselves number 
no more than 400,000, is the most 
widespread tongue, but also in the language 
of the Tats, of whom there are only 15,000, 
and even in a language spoken by only 2,000 
people. 
Unless one is directly involved, the prob- 
lems of the so-called “minority peoples”, 
who may be found in many different corners 
of the world, may well appear to be of little 
consequence. But the preoccupations of 
the tiniest community can in fact be as 
serious, as important and even as alarming 
to its members as the collective concerns of 
multi-million populations. 
This is especially true when it comes to 
cultural survival, and more particularly the 
survival of language, since a people without 
a tongue of its own is a people whose self- 
esteem is undermined. Language is not only 
the keystone of a nation’s culture; it is also 
the means by which that culture can 
develop. 
The language of any people is a unique 
phenomenon, a product of its own brand of 
creativity; the loss of a people's language is 
the loss of its life-blood. To preserve those 
which have survived is a duty, for they form 
part of the heritage of all mankind. 
The world lives in an environment of 
language, and the linguistic ecosphere is as 
complex and fragile as the natural one. 
Pragmatism may be a useful attitude to 
adopt when dealing with machines, but this 
is not the case where nature and culture are 
concerned. 
It is true, nonetheless, that ‘major’ 
languages tend to displace or absorb those 
which are only spoken by a few. However 
ardently it may be expressed, any argument 
in favour of integration which implies a loss 
of national values or of cultural identity 
must be received with caution, because it 
distorts the issue. To unite profitably, 
peoples and cultures must be in some way) 
35 
Various cultures can be identified within a graded social structure from the tribal level 
through rural life to urban groups and the urban élite. Superimposed on this there can even 
exist a multiplicity of cultures within a political structure, from area to area within national 
boundaries and from country to country within a region.

p different from each other, in some way 
dissimilar. The absence of originality makes 
mutual enrichment impossible; indeed it 
removes the need to unite. 
I am deeply convinced that there exists a 
real possibility of conserving existing minori- 
ty languages and creating the conditions for 
their active participation in new patterns of 
spiritual and material existence, as well as 
an atmosphere in which they. themselves 
can develop — either through their own inner 
evolution or through the direct and indirect 
influence and example of cultures conveyed 
by other languages. The experience of my 
own country, Kirghizia, confirms this con- 
viction, as does that of the hundred and 
more nations, peoples and ethnic groups 
which—exactly sixty years ago—freely 
decided to join in a single State, the Union 
of Soviet Socialist Republics. 
At that already distant time, the countries 
which lay on the fringe of the former Rus- 
sian Empire were faced with a choice. Were 
they to opt for a single, highly-developed 
language, i.e. Russian, or to decide on co- 
existence, i.e. the use of Russian as a major 
language, but with the parallel development 
of their own national tongues? 
The easiest and most obvious solution 
would have been for them to adopt Russian 
and, setting concern with their national 
cultures aside, to begin building the future 
on the solid literary and scientific founda- 
tions which that language offered. 
Such a simple choice must have been 
tempting. But did it not imply the atrophy of 
their own cultures? Would it not inhibit the 
development of those cultures in accor- 
dance with the spirit of the times? And last 
but not least, would not such a choice run 
counter to the process of creating infinite 
complexity and variety which is a welcome 
characteristic of human history? In 
mankind's storehouse of culture, who 
would be bold enough to say, ‘this must be 
kept at all costs, but this can be cast aside’? 
The matter was one which required 
thought, and the careful weighing of pros 
and cons. And if the choice of a language 
obviously depends on there being alter- 
natives to choose from, a question of civic 
duty is also involved: the duty of the in- 
dividual towards his people — the source not 
only of his existence but also of his most 
precious possession, his language. 
A mother tongue is, in its turn, a source 
of ceaseless wonder. The language which 
we hear and learn in childhood is the only 
one which is capable of carrying into our 
hearts and minds the poetry of our people's 
existence and experience, of igniting in us 
the first flame of national pride and of con- 
veying to us the sheer, aesthetic pleasure of 
words honed and polished by our ancestors. 
At the same time, it should be pointed 
out—and my own experience confirms 
this—that a child is capable of acquiring 
equal mastery of two languages, and 
possibly even more, provided that they are 
presented in an identical manner from the 
very beginning. In my own case Russian is 
no less a mother tongue than Kirghiz; | grew 
up with both, and both will remain with me 
for the rest of my days. 
In the early days of the USSR, it became 
clear that the cultural development of the 
family of nations which comprised the 
Soviet Union could not take place without 
reference to cultures which were already 
36 
more advanced. After all, more than a third 
of those nations had no printed literature of 
their own. And this is why the second of the 
options mentioned above was preferred. 
The challenge was greater, but so was the 
prize. 
One of the results is that when we speak 
today of “Soviet literature”, we are in reality 
speaking of more than eighty different na- 
tional literatures. The adoption of the princi- 
ple that wherever more than one language is 
used for ethnic reasons or for administrative 
purposes, those languages shall be accord- 
ed equal treatment, has fully justified itself. 
Let me say a word here about the role of 
the Russian language which has made it 
possible, for the first time in history, to 
establish creative links between peoples 
who, not so long ago, were unaware of 
each other's existence; between peoples 
who were on significantly different rungs on 
the ladder of civilization; whose cultural and 
social histories, like their customs and tradi- 
tions, had little in common; whose 
languages were mutually incomprehensible. 
If Russian has become the language of 
communication between the many peoples 
of the USSR, the language of the new 
civilization and of cultural co-operation, this 
is firstly because it is the language of the 
most numerous nation in the Union, and — 
& 
 
secondly, because it has adapted and 
enriched itself through contact with all the 
other languages. Thus, it has become the 
second language of non-Russian peoples in 
all the national republics and administrative 
regions of the USSR; eighty-two per cent of 
the entire population speak it fluently. 
It is now possible to say that for the first 
time in the history of mankind, a single 
State has created a multilingual culture, 
drawing on all that is best in the cultures of 
its majority and minority nations alike and at 
the same time conserving their specific na- 
tional characteristics, manner of thinking 
and ways of life. 
It is a culture which is simultaneously 
universal, internationalist and kaleido- 
scopically national. Its internationalism does 
not imply, as has been mistakenly claimed, 
the replacement of national cultures by a 
uniform stereotype, but rather the com- 
prehensive development of all the different 
national cultures and languages within the 
context of a single social ideal. 
We may contrast this process with the 
levelling and the erosion of national values 
which are still to be found, alas, in other 
parts of the world and which give rise to 
natural concern for the future of world 
culture. There is, | believe, an important 
humanist and moral lesson to be drawn 
  
CULTURAL DIVERSITY. It is essential that all linguistic, ethnic and 
cultural groups be accorded their rightful place in society. Often a 
minority group within a country has a great deal to offer by way of 
values to the majority groups within the same nation.

from the fact that the integration of the 
cultures of the socialist peoples leads 
neither to a loss of identity nor to the disap- 
pearance of differences, but rather to their 
mutual enrichment and further growth. In- 
deed, it permits the disclosure of the poten- 
tial of the peoples concerned, of the untap- 
ped resources which each nation possesses 
as a result of the spiritual and historical 
experience acquired throughout its long 
existence. 
Needless to say, the process has not been 
a simple one. Qur experience has been ac- 
quired at the price of enormous and 
sometimes agonizing efforts; the quest for 
new patterns of creative thought, and for a 
dialectical theory of existence, has involved 
a tireless journey along hitherto unmapped 
paths; we have had to overcome many 
obstacles remaining from the past, and to 
endure considerable growing pains. 
The development of a huge multinational 
State like the USSR has inevitably been ac- 
companied by the successive emergence of 
new processes and problems where the 
relations between nations are concerned. 
Suffice it to say in this connexion that re- 
cent years have seen a significant increase, 
in many of the Soviet Republics, in the 
number of non-indigenous citizens, who 
have specific claims to make where ques- 
tions of language, culture and life-style are 
concerned. 
At the same time, the frontiers of national 
life-styles are. constantly expanding. 
Moreover, the conditions of everyday life 
are changing so rapidly that it sometimes 
- 
happens that what were long considered to 
be specifically national concerns disappear 
from their original, limited context only to 
re-emerge as cultural obstructions to 
general progress. 
When we speak of the national par- 
ticularities which distinguish us from each 
other, we do not always take account of the 
many features which draw us together: our 
common destiny, our common background 
and our common age. The world we live in, 
the way we live now and, above all, the way 
we think: surely this is what should be set 
against our differences? 
Where the Soviet peoples are concerned, 
the greatest changes have occurred in their 
attitudes, psychology and behaviour. To 
whatever national entity we belong, there 
are now many circumstances in our lives in 
which our attitudes, assessments, 
judgements and standards are the same; 
and this can only be beneficial to our na- 
tional cultures. Provided, of course, that 
this new raison d’étre can find expression in 
our own languages, it is to be welcomed as 
a means of extending and enriching our 
own cultures and of broadening their 
horizons. 
And this is indeed what is happening. As 
we explore more and more thoroughly the 
features of what we call “national 
character”, as we learn to look at modern 
life through modern eyes, the notion of 
nationality itself takes on a contemporary 
colouring. 
But what would happen if we did the op- 
posite, if we withdrew like hermits into our » 
  
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY 
Science and technology form an integral 
part of contemporary culture, even 
though the uncontrolled development 
of certain techniques (mass media, new 
audio-visual techniques, telematics, 
nuclear systems) must be seen as involv- 
ing undeniable risks. The dialectical 
relation between culture and technique 
is a particularly delicate problem since 
science and technology carry with them 
cultural features that belong to their 
societies of origin. This does not in any 
way mean that they should be rejected 
systematically, as they are absolutely 
necessary for economic and social 
development. However, their dissem- 
ination and use must be controlled by 
the countries using them and developed 
in forms that are adapted by the scien- 
tists and technicians of these countries 
to the traditions and problems of their 
own cultures and to the actual needs of 
the people.

» own shells? The effect would surely be to 
reduce our culture to a mere shadow of 
itself, to a pseudo-culture which, at best, 
would give only a one-sided picture of our 
national character, 
A? 
To shut oneself off from intercourse with 
other cultures, especially if the latter are ata 
more advanced stage of development, is to 
deprive oneself of the means of one’s own 
development. Reduced to an end in itself, 
“originality” can only lead to isolation, to 
national narrow-mindedness; it can only 
obstruct the passage of national values 
beyond national boundaries. 
It goes without saying that cultural ex- 
change leads to cultural change. Interaction 
between national cultures involves mutual 
enrichment and emancipation from in- 
fluences which have outlived their time. For 
some strange reason, the term ‘national 
culture” is almost always pronounced with, 
so to speak, a backward glance over our 
shoulder in the direction of the past, 
whereas creative thought has at all times 
been a reflection of the current spiritual 
state of the society in question. The 
originality of a nation is not merely to be 
found in the sum total of the characteristics 
inherited during its history, in what has sur- 
vived and withstood the passage of time; it 
is also to be found here and now, in the 
product of its contemporary activities and 
concerns. 
If | have dwelt at such length on this mat- 
ter, it is because the question of national 
cultures has become in recent years the 
subject of worldwide controversy. The in- 
dividual characteristics of a nation are what 
makes its culture a unigue phenomenon. 
Close contact with one’s native land, with 
one’s people and with the most vital prob- 
lems of their daily life constitutes the very 
life-blood of a nation's culture; at the same 
time, it helps to extend the horizons of that 
culture beyond national boundaries, 
because, in so many ways, all peoples’ 
perceptions of the world are the same. This 
is why, where culture is concerned, "“na- 
tional” and “international” should never be 
set in opposition to one another. 
Of course, it is not surprising that in cer- 
tain intellectual circles, in Asia or in Africa, 
for example, there exists a sentiment of pre- 
judice against Eurocentrism, against the 
European way of thought and the European 
civilization which they associate with col 
onial domination and the belittlement of 
their own national values. Nevertheless, 
progressive African and Asian intellectuals 
pave long been engaged in the effort to use geypNCE AND TECHNOLOGY. Successful development does not

of mankind should be convinced that they will themselves be the beneficiaries of it.

quite understandable, however, why this 
question is a particularly painful one for Asia

means to be employed in resolving the issue 
of not only their political and social, but also 
their cultural development. The attainment 
of political independence poses with con- 
siderable urgency the question of creating 
appropriate new forms of economic and 
cultural existence, without which in- 
dependence itself will prove to have been a 
sterile gain. 
"East is East, and West is West...”" said 
Kipling. But this was poetic licence; history 
"" "and culture alike disprove his claim that 
“never the twain shall meet”. Recent 
decades have seen social upheavals on a 
scale matched only in biology and geology, 
and within an incredibly shorter time span. 
The developing countries are still at a stage 
when cultural progress will depend above all 
on success in their efforts to achieve social 
development and to resolve their social 
problems. 
Thoughts, things and images, as well as 
individual destinies and collective histories, 
already formed a motley crowd on the 
highways of existence when the peoples of 
the world lived hidden away in isolation 
from each other. Today, whether the strug- 
gle to preserve it intact is conducted in 
political or cultural terms, the world is in- 
divisible. International cultural and scientific . 
collaboration may be seen as part of 
the effort to remove tensions between 
peoples—an effort in which our own share 
is second to none. 
A new historical period has dawned, and 
the first step along the new road has been 
accomplished. The peoples of the world 
have shown that they are capable of setting 
aside the differences between States, 
societies and nations in the attempt to find a 
common approach to the problems of all 
mankind, and, most important of all, the 
issue of peace and war. 
We are united in our awareness of collec- 
tive responsibility for the fate of human 
culture and of civilization in its entirety, and 
for the moral climate of our planet. Does 
this not entitle us to proclaim boldly that 
now is the moment to choose the directions 
in which mankind is to develop? Our respon- 
sibility in this matter is all the more enor- 
mous, in that we cannot leave the decisions 
for tomorrow. For tomorrow itself to arrive 
will depend in no small measure on what we 
can achieve today.

INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION 
The fact that the greater part of the world’s information and communication resources are in 
the hands of the industrialized countries places them in a position such that they in fact exer- 
cise a kind of domination over the countries of the Third World—and the implications of 
this situation are all the more serious in that they are not realized by those in a position to ex- 
ercise domination. The fact that the mass communication media—newspapers with a vast, in 
some cases a world-wide circulation, press agencies which for most countries are almost the 
only sources of international news, and complex telecommunication networks—are in the 
hands of a few developed countries affects both the direction of the flow of information, 
which is produced in the developed countries and disseminated towards the Third World, 
and also the content of this information which inevitably reflects the point of view, the men- 
tality, the values and even the interests of the developed countries. It might thus be said that 
the direction of the flow of information determines its content.

### 50024: The Global village revisited

4, The global village 
Marshall McLuhan began to ponder 
the notion of the global village—the 
people of the world’s nations united by in- 
stantaneous inter-communication by tele- 
vision. As TV became available in every 
chateau, hut, and tent, he speculated, the 
world’s nations would inevitably become 
more aware of and sympathetic to each 
other's cultures and beliefs. How could 
bellicose heads of State sustain war fever 
and xenophobia among their citizens in the 
face of empathic images of adults and 
children—the human condition transmitted 
by television drama—flowing across na- 
tional boundaries? Perhaps also there is 
something revealing and spontaneous 
about this visual electronic medium which, 
in contrast to print, does not lend itself as 
well to the self-conscious prose or abstract 
propaganda of the ideological journalist or 
pamphleteer. It is a vision of new tech- 
nology and cultural harmony. 
Today this imagery, although still an at- 
tractive and coherent scenario, strikes a 
false chord. Those who struggle with the 
harsh realities of economic development, 
weary negotiators who face renewed 
debates over the New World Information 
Order are likely to represent a rather scep- 
I the mid-1960s Canadian media analyst 
?) revisited 
by Russell Neuman 
tical audience for a latter-day McLuhan who 
would point to new communications tech- 
nology as a panacea for world tensions. 
Some have reacted to the technological 
determinism of the global village notion by 
concluding simply that McLuhan had it the 
wrong way around. It is not television's 
technology which determines its ideological 
and cultural content, but the culture and 
ideology which determines the character 
and impact of the technology. One might 
contrast, for example, the Soviet Union's 
lengthy television documentaries cele- 
brating Lenin’s life and philosophy and new 
industrial development in the Urals with the 
theatrical capitalism of such American game 
shows as “Let's Make a Deal” and “The 
Price Is Right". 
Such a view leads quite naturally into the 
logic of the New World Information Order. 
The news and entertainment produced and 
distributed by the dominant Western media, 
so the logic goes, will inevitably reflect the 
commercial interests and national biases of 
their sources with continued insensitivity to 
the unique needs and perspectives of Third 
World audiences. 
Given the disquieting legacy of the col- 
onial era, many in the Third World 
understandably cast a sceptical eye on the 
prospect of a new electronic colonialism. 
But a simplistic model which equates all 
new media with neo-colonialism will be no 
more helpful in the design of workable inter- 
national communications policy than the 
naive optimism of McLuhan’s global village. 
The North-South and East-West polariza- 
tion of opinion concerning such issues as 
the New World Information Order may be a 
familiar pattern in international circles but it 
sparks special interest among communica- 
tions researchers. My thesis is this: The pro- 
ponents of an unrestricted free flow of 
media entertainment and information across 
national boundaries tend to reflect 
McLuhan's style of technological deter- 
minism— communications content, he was 
prone to argue, is inherently neutral. The 
spread of new technologies is inevitable. 
Each new technology from radio through 
television to direct broadcast satellites will 
spontaneously determine its own cultural 
character. In contrast, those who em- 
phasize cultural sovereignty issues tend to 
focus exclusively on entertainment and 
news as propaganda and reflect an extreme 
scepticism about new communication 
technologies—an equally simplistic political 
determinism. 
INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION. Every country has 
its share of communication outcasts or ‘‘have-nots’’ who only 
seldom have any say in determining the content of information and 
have virtually no opportunity of making their views or problems 
known through the media. And so the gap widens between those 
who are over-informed and those who are underinformed, while at 
the same time the imbalance between those who issue and those 
who receive information grows more pronounced. Admittedly, at 
the international level, the imbalance in the production and flow of 
information and programmes affects primarily North-South rela- 
tions, but it is also to be found within each of the world’s major 
regions and even within each country. The need to deliver the 
developing countries from the state of dependence they are still in 
as regards communication is now widely recognized: 80 per cent of 
the news distributed throughout the world comes from the in- 
dustrialized countries, and only 10 to 30 per cent concerns the 
developing countries. To this imbalance must be added the unequal 
distribution of books or radio and television programmes. The 
perpetuation of such disparities entails serious economic, political, 
10 
social and cultural consequences for the most deprived countries 
and at the same time constitutes a major obstacle in the way of the 
peoples getting to know each other and to the progress of interna- 
tional understanding, Countries with high capacities for producing 
and circulating information often tend to neglect other cultures or 
are familiar only with their picturesque or anecdotal aspects; and 
messages from the industrialized countries often feed back to the 
developing countries a simplified, sometimes distorted or indeed 
inaccurate image of themselves. Stereotyped and ethnocentric pat- 
terns are thus perpetuated and sometimes even reinforced, while a 
sense of insecurity may give rise to restrictive or defensive measures 
to guard against what is felt to be a threat to the more vulnerable 
communities. The very same fears are becoming apparent in a 
number of industrialized countries, aware that they too are using 
predominantly foreign programmes. A reduction of the disparities, 
by developing the media of each country and especially of the 
developing countries, would undoubtedly make for a freer and 
more substantial flow of messages and contribute to the progress 
of these countries and to wider international understanding.

COMMUNICATION 
AND CULTURE 
It would not be enough to provide 
equipment and materials and to 
mobilize human and financial 
resources—ungquestionably important 
as that is—for all communication prob- 
lems to be solved, both within each 
country and in relations between coun- 
tries. For the questions that arise also 
concern the nature of social relations 
and the quality of communication; they 
consequently have social and cultural 
implications at all levels, national, 
regional and international. 
Pp» The truth of the matter, as usual, lies 
somewhere in between. The role of com- 
munications researchers, in studying how 
audiences use and learn from the media, will 
be to demonstrate that the appropriate 
model is one of a continuing interaction of 
technological and political forces rather 
than a one-way determinism in either direc- 
tion. Such a perspective opens new com- 
mon ground. 
The New World Information Order debate 
as it stands now is troublesome. Each side 
identifies a primary goal apparently incom- 
patible with the other, Western nations pro- 
claim the need to avoid censorship and to 
protect the free flow and exchange of ideas 
across national borders. Developing nations 
and those which tend to import more 
cultural products than they export proclaim 
the need to protect cultural and political 
sovereignty from the intrusion of Western 
commercial news and entertainment media. 
It might be argued, perhaps somewhat 
cynically, that each side shares the same 
premise and the same goal. The shared 
premise is that in open market competition 
between Western and regional or locally

produced materials the Western content will 
tend to dominate. The goal each side shares 
is to dominate the local media. The Western 
media would do so, it is said, by means of 
open-market competition and the local and 
regional media by insulating the local media 
through the use of cultural trade barriers, 
tariffs, quotas, or perhaps censorships of 
some sort. 
Fostering cultural diversity is the common 
goal. It finds resonance with the first article 
of Unesco’s Constitution—the goal of col- 
laboration “in the work of advancing the 
mutual knowledge and understanding of 
peoples through all means of mass com- 
munication, and to that end, [Unesco shall] 
recommend such international agreements 
as may be necessary to promote the free 
flow of ideas by word and image’. Cultural 
diversity is, however, not necessarily the 
natural condition. it may indeed require nur- 
turing. It is here that some recent 
technological developments offer special 
promise. 
The overwhelming and dominant 
technological trend, of course, is the move- 
ment toward electronic communication.

COMMUNICATION 
AND CULTURE 
A crucial problem, now well known, is 
that of the major role played by 
transnational corporations in regard to 
mass media and, more generally, 
cultural industries, especially in the field 
of information, as well as that of the ex- 
port of technologies whose supposed 
neutrality is disproved in every study 
that has been made. In the face of these 
problems there is a very evident need to 
work out national and international 
strategies. 
duits for information are giving way to 
magnetic tape and laser disc storage and 
transmission via wire and the expanded 
usable electromagnetic spectrum. The fami- 
ly elder as storyteller is replaced by the an- 
nouncer. The messenger boy and paper boy 
seek other careers as information is elec- 
tronically delivered directly into the home in- 
formation terminal. 
The printed page in the form of books, 
magazines, and newspapers remains 
economically viable but is diminished 
somewhat by the prominence of broadcast 
news and entertainment. The role of com- 
puters and high-speed data lines in 
transporting text and data begins to blur the 
distinction between print and video. In- 
creasingly a news story might pass from a 
reporter's word processing terminal through 
an editor's terminal to the news reader's 
home screen without ever having taken 
form as ink on paper. 
Electronic communication is the central 
historical trend, but a full sense of its im- 
plications requires special attention to three 
characteristics of the technology which 
have unique relevance for cultural diversity. 
The first factor is lowered costs. Dramatical- 
ly increased economies of scale and efficien- 
cy in manufacture result from the develop- 
ment of transistors and microelectronic 
chips. Printed circuit boards of inexpensive 
silicon which can be stamped out almost 
like pamphlets from a high-speed printing 
press replace laboriously hand-assembled 
component parts. 
Optical cable offers to cut costs of 
transmission by wire on an equally dramatic 
scale. In 1920 a transatlantic phone call cost 
eighteen dollars (US) for three minutes; by 
1980 the cost had fallen to under two 
dollars. The cost of overseas video trans- 
mission via satellite has dropped equiv- 
alently. As the speed and storage capacity 
of microcomputers grow and the price of 
manufacture falls, some observers predict 
that within the next decade it may prove to 
be cheaper not only to send a letter but an 
entire book via high speed data lines bet- 
ween two microcomputers. 
Ultimately the cost of electronic transfer 
and display is likely to fall below the cost of 
postage alone, not even considering the 
rising costs of printing and binding. Minia- 
turization and improved engineering have 
reduced the cost of video cameras and 
recorders. Professional quality colour video 
recording and editing equipment is increas- 
ingly within the financial reach of local 
schools and community groups while a 
decade or so ago equivalently equipped 
television studios were economically viable 
only in major metropolitan areas. 
The second factor of emerging electronic 
technology is increased bandwidth. Band- 
width is a term adopted from electrical 
engineering which has come to refer more 
generally to numbers of channels and the 
amount of information each can carry. 
There are several related technical 
developments here. The increased speed of 
data communications mean that a great deal 
more can be communicated in equivalent 
time (and presumably stored for future 
reference) leaving a channel free for others 
to use. Refinements in “multiplexing” 
technology mean that with the appropriate 
equipment, two users of a cable or assigned 
frequency can use that channel simul- 
taneously without loss of fidelity or ac- 
curacy. Finally, improved engineering 
allows the use of higher and higher spec- 
trum frequencies especially for satellite 
communication. In effect, the portion of the 
electromagnetic spectrum available for 
communication is increasing.

### 50024: The Global village revisited

Improvements of coaxial and optical cable 
and associated electronics make possible a 
dramatic expansion of the number of 
distinct video and audio signals that can be 
brought into the home. For example, in the 
1950s and 1960s most coaxial cable systems 
carried a maximum of eight to twelve tele- 
vision signals. Now, with approximately fif- 
ty channels on a single cable, we are ap- 
proaching the practical limits of that 
transmission technology. 
The third element of electronic com- 
munications is the growth of interactivity. 
Perhaps the most notable examples in this 
case are the increasing significance of 
microelectronics in videodisc, teletext and 
videotex monitors which allow individual 
audience members to edit, scan, replay and 
generally control the speed and character of 
video and text presentation. Interactive 
videodiscs allow viewers to explore still pic- 
tures, graphics and motion video with the 
same control they would exercise in con- 
sulting a dictionary or encyclopedia. 
The attentive reader has no doubt already 
anticipated the conclusion. Falling produc- 
tion and transmission, and display costs, in- 
creased available bandwidth and the 
strengthened ability of the audience 
member to review and select preferred con- 
tent leads to the concept of narrowcasting. 
Narrowecasting, as contrasted with broad- 
casting, focusses attention on communica- 
tion to smaller, special-interest audiences. 
The economies of scale, especially in com- 
mercially supported mass communications, 
have traditionally been characterized by the 
search for the largest possible au- 
diences—the pursuit of the common in- 
terest and mass appeal. But as new con- 
duits of information and entertainment 
grow, demand is likely to expand as well, 
and the changing economics is likely to per- 
mit specialized productions of text and 
video which more fully reflect the cultural 
diversity of their audiences. 
Some sceptical observers of new com- 
munications technologies may simply see it 
as the renewed dominance of American 
popular culture . being reproduced on 
Japanese electronics. Such a perspective is 
likely to lead to renewed efforts to build bar- 
riers to transnational communications. But 
such a posture neglects a special charac- 
teristic of technological development which 
could work to the benefit of the Third World 
and an increasingly two-way flow of cultural 
communications. It might be identified as a 
sequential theory of communications 
development. 
The underlying idea is simply that as 
newer (and initially rather expensive) 
technologies such as videodisc, teletext, 
direct broadcast satellite and cable TV ex- 
pand first in the industrialized nations, de- 
mand for culturally diverse and specialized 
programming is likely to outstrip the supply. 
This may represent an opportunity for the 
more entrepreneurial of nations further 
down the development curve to concen- 
trate their efforts on producing and 
marketing specialized materials. 
It could prove to be the reverse of the 
more traditional pattern in which as televi- 
sion and other media are introduced into 
developing countries the sudden demand 
for content leads to the mass importation of 
American and European programming. 
There are numerous cultural subcom- 
44 
munities in the US from Africa, Asia, 
Europe, Latin America, and Scandinavia 
which would welcome the opportunity to 
renew closer ties with specialized news and 
traditional culture from their homelands. 
It may be true, generally, that in the world 
of the twentieth century there is enough 
mobility of peoples across cultural and na- 
tional boundaries to justify a quantum leap 
in the transmission of specialized content to 
the newly settled. As these cultural 
materials spill over and are conveniently 
available to their new and curious 
neighbours, one might expect a lessening of 
cultural differences and misunderstanding. 
Perhaps this is the global village notion 
reborn via cable television. 
HM Russell Neuman 
What's new 
BANDWIDTH. A term adopted from 
electrical engineering which identifies 
the amount of information a channel 
can carry, or more generally speaking, 
the total number of communications 
channels available. 
CABLE TELEVISION. The transmis- 
sion of television signals via coaxial 
cable. Originally known as CATV 
(Community Antenna TV), cable was 
first used to conduct TV signals from a 
large antenna usually on a nearby 
mountain to rural communities who 
would otherwise not be able to receive 
broadcast signals in their homes. 
Gradually, with the expansion of 
specialized programming transmitted to 
cable operators via satellite, cable has 
expanded into suburbs and cities where 
it is increasingly a competitor with 
broadcast television. Current cable 
technology can bring 50 to 100 channels 
into the home. 
DIRECT BROADCAST SATELLITE 
(DBS). The transmission of high power 
radio or television signals direct to home 
receiving sets from geostationary 
satellites. These satellites are located 
22,300 miles above the equator and 
have fixed “‘footprints’’ (broadcast 
reception areas) which usually spill well 
beyond the borders of a single country. 
As a result of the use of space com- 
munication and the international 
character of the reception areas, DBS 
technology has especially profound in- 
ternational ramifications. The large 
broadcast coverage area makes DBS of 
special interest to countries with large, 
dispersed populations, or especially rug- 
ged terrain which makes terrestrial 
broadcast impractical. 
NARROWCASTING. A concept con- 
trasted to broadcasting which grows out 
of the new media. With many more 
channels into the home, this notion sug- 
gests, mass media will increasingly offer 
special-interest programming to 
smaller, more culturally distinct au- 
diences. 
MULTIPLEXING. The term refers to 
engineering techniques for com- 
municating multiple messages on a 
single channel. 
OPTICAL CABLE. A technology still 
in development. Cables of thin, flexible   
in media technology 
glass or plastic fibres will probably 
emerge as a less expensive substitute for 
coaxial cable for carrying broadband 
communications such as television. The 
technology transmits light down optical 
fibres rather than electrons down cop- 
per wires to communicate data, audio, 
or video information. 
TELETEXT. A system for broad- 
casting text information such as news 
headlines or weather forecasts to 
specially equipped television sets by 
means of a small unused portion of the 
broadcast signal. Special decoders at- 
tached to the sets at the option of the 
viewer store and reproduce frames of 
digitally encoded text information and 
simple graphics. 
VIDEODISC AND VIDEOCASSET- 
TES. Discs and tapes are capable of 
reproducing two to six hours of televi- 
sion programming on a special playback 
unit in a manner similar to an audio 
recording. The discs and disc player are 
generally somewhat less expensive to 
manufacture than the equivalent 
videocassette equipment. The disc tech- 
nology lends itself especially to interac- 
tive use giving the viewer unusual con- 
trol on selecting a particular video 
frame or the pace and manner of 
playback. The primary advantage of 
videocassette is that, as with audio tape, 
the user can continually record new 
materials on the cassette. 
VIDEOTEX. A (two-way text com- 
munications system using coaxial cable 
or telephone lines to connect terminals 
in homes and businesses with a central 
computer and information bank. The 
first experiment was the English Prestel 
system which found limited success 
among business users and few residen- 
tial customers. Nonetheless, new ver- 
sions of the technology are now being 
very actively explored in nations around 
the world as a way of allowing in- 
dividuals to gather up-to-date informa- 
tion, conduct financial transactions and 
order products from home terminals.

IESE MEISHIOE 
Olympic Order Gold Medal 
for Unesco’s 
Director-General 
The gold medal of the Olympic Order was 
presented to Mr. Amadou-Mahtar M'Bow, 
Director-General of Unesco, at a ceremony 
in Paris on 6 May. Making the award, the 
president of the International Olympic 
Committee (IOC), Mr. Juan Antonio 
Samaranch, spoke of Mr. M’'Bow’s untiring 
efforts to promote sport and culture and to 
spread Olympic ideals throughout the 
world. Thanking Mr. Samaranch for the 
honour conferred upon him Mr. M'Bow 
declared that Unesco would give its support 
to a proposal made by the president of the 
IOC for the creation of sports museums 
around the world. : 
Venezuelan science-writer 
awarded Kalinga Prize 
Aristides Bastidas, a Venezuelan science 
journalist who had his first article published 
when he was only eleven years old and then 
went on to become an editor and to write a 
regular science column in his newspaper £/ 
Nacional, has been awarded the Kalinga 
Prize for the Popularization of Science. In 
his acceptance speech Mr. Bastidas 
declared that scientific journalism could 
contribute to overcoming technological 
dependence, which in its turn brought 
cultural and political dependence. Created 
in 1951, the £1,000 Kalinga Prize is awarded 
annually by a jury appointed by Unesco for 
work contributing to the popularization of 
science. It bears the name of the ancient In- 
dian empire which flourished under the 
reign of Ashoka, the enlightened emperor 
who renounced war to devote himself to 
study and religion. 
1st Delphi International 
Film Festival 
A film festival with no pre-selection or cen- 
sorship and at which all films entered were 
shown regardless of length, language and 
content, was held in June at Delphi, Fokida, 
Greece. The primary objective of the Delphi 
festival, which is to be an annual event, is to 
act as a centre of attraction for the gather- 
  
Samad Nourinejad 
We regret to announce the death of 
our colleague Samad Nourinejad, 
Editor of the Persian edition of the 
Unesco Courier. After a distinguish- 
ed career as a schoolteacher, he was 
appointed head of the Department 
of International Relations of the Ira- 
nian Ministry of Science and Higher 
Education. He was subsequently 
named Assistant Secretary-General 
of the Iranian National Commission

Centenary of 
Nicolae Titulescu 
This year marks the centenary of the birth of 
Nicolae Titulescu (1882-1941), Romanian 
statesman, author and jurist. A professor of 
civil law, he attended the peace negotia- 
tions in Paris after the First World War and 
as Minister of Foreign Affairs he champion- 
ed Romania’s accession to the Little Entente 
(1933) and the Balkan Entente (1934). Twice 
President of the League of Nations, he was 
a leading advocate of European collective 
security based on disarmament. As a jurist 
Titulescu made a remarkable contribution to 
the elaboration and defence of the prin- 
ciples of international law, particularly as 
applied to the non-violent settlement of 
disputes and respect for independence and 
national sovereignty. Behind all his actions 
could be discerned an ardent desire to in- 
troduce a new, pacific attitude in interna- 
tional affairs, to determine the causes of 
war and to indicate ways by which it could 
be avoided. Forty years after his death his 
aims and ideals remain fresh and untarnish- 
ed and astonishingly relevant to the world of 
today. 
International Books in Print 
The complete current book output of 
Unesco and other international organiza- 
tions, as well as thousands of titles from 
Third-World publishers, government agen- 
cies and research institutes are listed in /n- 
ternational Books in Print 1981-1982, a com- 
prehensive catalogue of English-language

and the United Kingdom. The 2-volume 
repertory, published by K.G. Saur Verlag 
KG, of Munich, lists some 90,000 titles from 
publishers in 94 countries. 
Window on China 
The atmosphere of daily life in China today 
can be tasted in Paris this summer at an ex- 
hibition being held at the Centre Georges 
Pompidou (until 21 September). Organized 
by the Centre de Création Industrielle with 
the aim of "letting the Chinese present their 
country themselves”, the exhibition 
presents such aspects of the everyday en- 
vironment as housing, consumer goods, 
and communications. Chinese culture-will 
be the theme of a forthcoming issue of the 
Unesco Courier.

Good morning Mr. Vermeer 
Art today seems more and more to be becoming the favoured meeting ground for imagery, values and sensibilities 
stemming from many distinct cultural regions. In this work, entitled (in Dutch) Goeden Dag Mynheer Vermeer II 
(Goad morning Mr. Vermeer Il), the Peruvian artist Herman Braun could be said to have gone one stage further in 
bringing together, across the years, in compelling and surprising proximity, the famous 17th-century Dutch 
painter's The Lacemaker and an itinerant Peruvian shoemaker of today.
