waging an international campaign 
for many years to save these 
irreplaceable buildings and

instead of being demolished, 
the architectural treasures of 
the world’s historic cities 
be given new uses and be adapted 
where possible to the needs 
of modern life. Left, two figures °

Integrating historic sites 
into modern urbanism 
HE preservation of historic 
towns and sites is a problem 
that arises even in countries where 
urbanization has only recently begun. 
Some capital cities which were no 
more than villages at the end of the 
19th century already face problems 
of growth and a difficult choice bet- 
ween the preservation and moderniza- 
tion of their historic centres. 
Such problems are even more 
frequent in towns with centuries, if not 
thousands of years, of history behind 
them. Violent controversies may be 
caused as much by misunderstandings 
as by conflicting interests. Some 
projects for urban renewal in historic 
city centres arouse strong feelings so 
confused that they are sometimes 
wrongly seen as new quarrels between 
the Ancients and the Moderns, 
At first sight, the notion of a historic 
town or locality presents no difficulty 
for anyone. It seems quite clear in 
brochures and other tourist literature 
publicizing “cities of artistic and his- 
toric interest”. 
However, the places whose age and 
picturesque qualities get all the lime- 
light are as a rule the best protected 
or at least the best provided with 
means for ensuring their preservation. 
Many other cities of equal merit, 
whose sites are less accessible or 
whose architectural worth is less 
easily discerned, remain neglected. 
Today's rapidly expanding towns 
are better known for their vigorous 
growth than for the vestiges of their 
past. But now they are discovering 
the charm of their old quarters which 
seemed commonplace to the tourists

of former times, interested only in the 
“remote” or “great” periods. 
City buildings do not always need 
to have defied the centuries in order 
to be considered as venerable. They 
may be classified as historic because 
they were once the childhood homes 
of famous persons or the scene of 
outstanding events in the recent his- 
tory of a nation. 
The notion of a town or quarter of 
historical interest thus covers a wide 
variety of places: ghost towns, 
forgotten cities among whose ruins 
nomads now pitch their tents, over- 
populated towns bursting with life. 
Some are legendary cities, known the 
world over; others are remote villages 
whose stones reveal their history to 
only a handful of scholars.

### 50500: What future for our ancient cities?

DP space of a few years, have retained 
an astonishing unity of style and the 
stamp of the age in which they were 
built. Others, which have been con- 
tinually developing, are a disconcerting 
mixture of periods and styles—like 
manuscripts in which old writing has 
been rubbed out to make room for new. 
All these groups of historic buildings 
have one thing in common: they are 
generally thought to be ill adapted to 
modern life. When their raison d’étre 
—political, religious, military, cultural 
or economic—has moved elsewhere 
or disappeared completely through 
changes in religious, social and 
technological conditions, these build- 
ings lose some of their original uses 
and are poorly equipped to fulfil new 
ones—as commercial centres, for 
example. 
Once the wealthier and more enter- 
prising sections of the population 
move out to new towns, the whole 
‘character of a city changes radically. 
People from low income groups move 
in, renting accommodation in former 
palaces, mansions, stately homes and 
ancestral dwellings. They cannot 
afford to maintain these buildings, 
which almost inevitably become dilapi- 
dated. Trade, previously geared to 
the needs of a prosperous, structured 
and diversified society, adjusts to the 
requirements of more modest and 
relatively deprived groups. 
Needless to say, not all towns and 
quarters of historic interest have 
suffered the same fate: some are 
empty, some bubble with vitality; 
others have kept or regained their 
former prestige. 
If a historic city has ceased to fulfil 
the purposes intended by its builders, 
are we to conclude that it no longer 
has a “raison d'étre”? Or ought we, on 
the contrary, to endow it with new 
functions? And if so, what are they? 
At all times towns and cities have 
changed in appearance, sometimes 
with brutal speed, for wars and fires 
have been powerful forces of urban 
development. But when a town or 
city was rebuilt after a disaster, its 
new appearance did not necessarily 
conflict with the original vision of the 
master builders of former times. The 
world of its inhabitants would change 
very little. 
The new buildings which replaced 
the old were usually built on the same 
site and followed the same layout. 
Succeeding generations saw their 
town grow or shrink, become beautiful 
or ugly, expand or close in on itself. 
In other words, cities changed gradu- 
ally. During one man’s lifetime, his 
city would stay the same. 
in our time, there has been a radical 
break with this process. Today, for 
the first time in history, every city in 
b 
the world is being rapidly transformed, 
and in accordance with a uniform 
pattern. The disappearance of old 
city centres and quarters should not 
be an inevitable consequence of urban 
expansion, but this is what is 
happening everywhere. 
Our industrial civilization is the first 
to possess both the financial means 
and the technical resources to demo- 
lish old buildings on a large scale and 
almost immediately to replace them 
with new and totally different ones. 
This is why the issues involved 
when old towns are threatened with 
demolition often seem so confused. 
Only in modern times have we become 
aware of the problem and its inherent 
contradictions. 
The ancient city existed as an un- 
questioned presence which no more 
gave rise to value judgements, to 
acceptance or rejection, than did the 
presence of a mountain or a river. 
But once its existence is questioned 
it becomes historic, and is’ either 
extolled or dismissed as alien to the 
modern world, a treasure for some, 
a source of embarrassment for others. 
Large-scale demolition of historic 
centres or quarters is generally justi- 
fied on the grounds of “progress” by 
the public authorities which either 
decide on demolition or allow it to take 
place. The needs and advantages of 
progress are expressed from a wide 
variety of viewpoints. 
HM Traditional cities have been and still 
are condemned on aesthetic grounds. 
Cultural and political changes can 
provoke curiously hostile reactions to 
works of the past. What is ancient 
may be regarded simply as old, dirty, 
unseemly. 
This attitude, still widely found in 
some countries which seek to hide the 
most typical examples of old archi- 
tecture and town planning, brings to 
mind the contempt in which neo- 
classical Europe long held what it 
termed the “barbarism” of Gothic 
castles and cathedrals. The results 
are disastrous when the authorities, 
anxious to modernize their capitals, 
apparently feel nothing but shame for 
the evidence of their national culture, 
whose purity, moreover, they claim 
to defend. 
WM Social considerations also play an 
important part. Badly cared for, 
overcrowded and often neglected by 
the public health and maintenance 
services, historic buildings used for 
housing can all too easily become 
classed as “insanitary”. Old town 
centres are sometimes regarded as 
hotbeds of disease and epidemics, fit 
only for radical and over-simplified 
“cleaning-up™ measures—as though 
demolition were the only cure for 
unhygienic conditions.

THE HERITAGE OF 
NEPAL 
Rising like a giant staircase from the 
low-lying Terai plain to the towering 
heights of the Himalayas, the Kingdom of 
Nepal is a confluence of peoples, languages 
cultures and religions. Its cultural and 
historic heart, the Kathmandu valley, 
with nearly four-fifths of all the country’s 
historic monuments, is also the area of 
Nepal most affected today by moder- 
nization and urban development. 
Nepal thus faces a complex problem of 
harmonizing social and economic develop- 
ment with the preservation of a rich and 
unique cultural heritage and a natural 
environment of imposing beauty. 
Since 1968 Unesco has been assisting 
Nepal in the preservation of its historic 
monuments. It has helped in the restora- 
tion of the Hanuman Dhoka palace in 
Kathmandu, where the king will be crown- 
ed in February 1975 (see page 8). It has 
also aided Nepal in setting up a conser- 
vation laboratory at the National Museum 
in Kathmandu and is training specialists 
in restoration techniques, locally and 
through fellowships for study abroad. 
To assist Nepal in making a total 
approach to the problems of conservation 
and economic growth, Unesco is now 
launching its first integrated enterprise in 
cultural conservation and development. 
Next May, Unesco will send a special 
team of experts to Nepal, in co-operation 
with the U.N. Development Programme, 
comprising specialists in the fields of 
economics, architecture, urban and rural 
planning. sociology, archaeology, public 
health, museology and legal questions. 
The Unesco team will benefit from earlier 
surveys made by the Nepalese Govern- 
ment, in collaboration with Unesco and 
the United Nations, on town planning and 
the conservation of monuments and the 
natural environment and plans for econo- 
mic development. It will also make use of 
the first detailed inventory of all the 
monuments and sites in the Kathmandu 
valley, just completed (see page 30). 
Using this information and making new 
on-the-spot surveys, the Unesco team 
will prepare a master plan for the cultural 
development of the Kathmandu valley 
which, while preserving its monuments® 
will respect the needs of the people and 
protect the natural environment.

are crowned 
First stage of a Unesco plan

of the entire Kathmandu valley 
by Raj Mukunda 
N Kathmandu on February 24, 1975, 
Birendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev will 
be formally crowned King of Nepal in a 
courtyard of the ancient royal palace 
of Hanuman Dhoka. Like generations 
of their forefathers before them, the 
Nepalese will flock to the capital from 
all parts of the country to acclaim the 
newly-crowned King. As the age-old 
rituals are performed, and the King 
is presented to the people, all Nepal's 
religious, cultural, political and his- 
 
RAJ MUKUNDA, of Nepal, is lecturer in Ne- 
palese history at Tribhuvan University in Kath- 
mandu, the capital of Nepal. 
torical traditions will surge to life in 
an outburst of jubilation and festivity. 
While ancient Vedic hymns are 
chanted, King Birendra will be anointed 
and washed by Brahman priests. 
Then, enthroned on a dais facing to the 
east, he will be solemnly instated, as 
Nepal's superb helmet-like crown, 
encrusted with pearls, diamonds, 
rubies and emeralds, and crested by 
billowing bird of paradise feathers is 
placed on his head. 
As the young King leaves the palace, 
to be borne on a towering elephant 
through streets packed with his sub- 
jects, he will follow another ancient 
custom. He will offer flowers and 
coins to the Hindu and Buddhist 
images. The Palace where the 
coronation ceremony will take place 
is called Hanuman Dhoka because the

image of the Hindu deity Hanuman is 
standing on the main gate. 
The ceremony in the courtyard of 
the Hanuman Dhoka will mark Biren- 
dra's religious “consecration. On 
coronation day he will become, in the 
eyes of all the Nepalese, the incar- 
nation of the god Vishnu, the defender 
of good order, as the main duty of the 
King is to protect his country and his 
countrymen. 
This relationship will be expressed 
symbolically in the palace courtyard, 
where the King will sit on a throne 
backed by a golden canopy carved in 
the form of a nine-headed cobra, 
representing Vishnu. 
Hanuman Dhoka Palace is set in 
the heart of Kathmandu, a city founded 
in 723 and capital of Nepal since the 
middle of the 18th century.

The Palace roofs rise tier upon tier 
from Durbar Square. Inside there is 
a whole bewildering network of irregu- 
larly connected courtyards, nestling 
between pagodas, shrines, columns 
and statues. They all form part of the 
extensive and rambling Palace. 
These buildings are of great beauty 
and historical interest. But like 
many Nepalese monuments they have 
suffered harshly from the ravages of 
time. They have been rocked by the 
earthquakes which periodically hit the 
Kathmandu valley—one tower was 
particularly shaken by an earthquake 
in 1934 and now leans crazily to the 
north. They are exposed to the annual 
drenching of the monsoon. Much of 
the delicately carved polychrome 
woodwork which supports the roofs is 
rotten and in dire need of restoration. 
Several years ago the Nepalese 
government appealed to Unesco for 
help in restoring and reconstructing 
its great historical monuments. In 
1968 a Unesco mission recommended 
that certain parts of Kathmandu valley - 
should be designated as “historic 
districts” and then in 1970 Unesco 
declared that it was prepared to 
initiate a programme for the conser- 
vation of temples and their environ- 
ment in this valley. 
The first conservation programme to 
be carried out by Unesco, in collabo- 
ration with the Nepalese government 
and with the United Nations Develop- 
ment Programme financing experts and 
equipment, is a project to conserve 
Hanuman Dhoka. The aim of the 
project is not only to restore the 
Palace but to train a conservation 
team for work elsewhere in Nepal. 
It was decided that the first stage 
in the project should be the conserv- 
ation of “Nassal Chowk”, the court- 
yard in which the coronation ceremony 
takes place. 
Each of the 14 big courtyards, or 
chowks, in the Palace compound is 
dedicated to a different divinity. For 
instance the coronation courtyard is 
dedicated to the god Nartesvara, 
Nepal's “Lord of the Dance.” Only 
one courtyard is generally open to the 
public. The rest are closed except 
on the occasion of the great religious 
festival known as “Durga Puja” (Durga 
worship}, which is celebrated every 
autumn in Nepal. The Durga Puja is 
as important a festival for all the

### 50501: Kathmandu's ancient palace where Nepal's kings are crowned, first stage of a UNESCO plan for restoring the monuments of the entire Kathmandu valley

dancers wearing ornately decorated 
masks and headdresses gather in a 
courtyard of the palace to celebrate 
the visit of the god Indra. 
Perhaps the most beautiful courtyard 
in Hanuman Dhoka is that known as 
“Lohan Chowk”, which is enclosed by 
the “House of Enjoyment” built by 
the great 18th-century ruler Prithvi 
Narayan, who united the kingdom of 
Nepal. The House of Enjoyment, now 
in an advanced state of disrepair, 
contains some fine carvings and 
architectural details. Unesco is 
helping in its restoration. It has been 
proposed that it be used as a museum 
of Nepalese history, art and archi- 
tecture. 
Visitors to the Lohan courtyard are 
invariably surprised by the towers 
which rise at each corner. Each one 
is built in a different style. One is a 
majestic nine-storey construction, with 
three overhanging roofs. Another has 
a Bengali “elephant’s ear” style roof. 
A curious story surrounds the 
construction of the four towers. When 
planning his palace the King is said 
to have asked four towns in his 
kingdom to nominate their best builders 
and architects, and each town in this 
co-operative competition built a tower. 
The tallest and most spectacular, the 
nine-storey Bhasantpur Tower, was 
built by Kathmandu itself. The three 
others were named after the cities 
which built them: Lalitpur (also known 
as Patan), Bhaktapur (also known 
as Bhadgaon), and Kirtipur. Each 
tower looks out across the valley to 
the town which built it. All four are 
now to be restored with Unesco’s help 
as part of the Hanuman Dhoka Con- 
servation Project. 
Almost 100 feet high, Bhasantpur 
tower's nine storeys are connected by 
steep, narrow staircases, and on each 
storey there is a heavy trapdoor which 
can be bolted from above. From its 
balconies one commands the view 
once enjoyed by the monarchs of 
Nepal, who came to sit there in 
cushioned splendour to survey their 
kingdom. Durbar Square below teems 
with market traders; behind rise the 
tiered roofs of the Palace. The whole 
of the interior of this tower will be 
renovated as part of the current 
programme. 
The restoration of Hanuman Dhoka 
is only the first stage in the collabo- 
ration between the Nepalese Govern- 
ment and Unesco. Unesco has already 
surveyed the principal monuments 
of the entire Kathmandu Valley (see 
article page 17). In this way the 
rich cultural and artistic heritage of 
Nepal, the cross-roads of two great 
Asiatic civilizations, will be saved. WH

This five-roofed pagoda dominates the courtyards of 
Hanuman Dhoka Palace with its striking circular roofs. 
It stands in the eastern part of the palace, near one of 
Kathmandu’s largest temples, which is so sacred that 
it isclosed except for the annual celebrations in honour 
of its patron goddess, Durga.

SPIRITUAL 
LANDSCAPE 
OF NEPAL 
Meeting ground of cultures

Left, typical Nepalese mountain village, dominated 
by the mighty snow-covered Himalayan massif 
of Annapurna. Below, detail from a 16th-century 
Nepalese illuminated manuscript, depicting the serpent, 
which figures in the legendary origins of Nepal. 
The story goes that Nepal's Kathmandu valley was once 
a lake filled with serpents and hemmed in by mountains. 
A hero is said to have cloven the mountains with his sword 
and the water flowed out, carrying the serpents away. 
ROM time immemorial Nepal 
has been a land where people 
have sought and found peace. The 
scriptures, epics and such famous 
works of the Hindus and Buddhists as 
the Ramayana, the Mahabharata, the 
Puranas, the Buddhacarita and others 
have told of tribes, races and dynasties 
of brave and cultured people who 
lived and ruled there. 
In the shadow of the Himalayas, 
hermits, philosophers and thinkers 
meditated upon man and human 
happiness. In the eastern lowlands of 
Nepal, the saints Yaguanvalkya and 
his wife Gargi preached a kind of 
human dignity and nobility that could 
lead men to the divine. Janak, King 
of Bideha, the prototype of the perfect 
ruler and ideal man, established lasting 
ethical and moral precepts. His 
daughter, Sita, came to symbolize the 
ideal of Asian womanhood, and she 
and her husband, Rama, are the subject 
of the Ramayana, composed by the 
poet-saint Valmiki near the Gandak 
river in southern Nepal, 
This epic, loved and cherished over 
most of Asia, has been an endless 
literary and artistic source of inspi- 
ration. The philosopher-saint Kapil 
meditated on the immortal figure of 
the Buddha, the Enlightened One, who 
said to his disciples: “I teach only 
two things: the cause of human sorrow 
and the way to be free from it.” 
This is the heritage of Nepal and 
of its people, thinkers, poets and 
artists. Stupas, pagodas and temples 
honour Shiva, god of peace and 
prosperity, or the Buddha in meditation 
—themes which inspire all the arts: 
literature, music, dance, painting, 
sculpture. Hospitality, optimism, tol- 
erance, understanding, creativity and 
contentment are hereditary qualities 
that created a social environment 
which—quite apart from Nepal's geo- 
graphical position—made it an ideal 
meeting place for different trends of 
thought and culture. 
The fertile valley of Kathmandu 
escaped the strife and turmoil of 
neighbouring countries. Thinkers and 
artists here found welcome, peace and 
quiet beneath the great blue sky, where 
the solemn, mystic peaks of the Hima- 
layas stand guard, beyond vast ex- 
panses of green woodlands with their 
orchids and rhododendrons, their 
never-ending music of streams and 
birds. 
Ar-Niko was one of the Nepalese 
artists and master-craftsmen at the 
Court of Hublaii Han (Kublai Khan) in 
the 13th century. He became Imperial 
Minister for Building and Arts in China. 
Best known among his contributions 
to architecture, metal casting and 
painting is the Buddhist Chaitya,

popularly known as the White Dagoba, 
which he had placed on a hillock in 
the Central Park in Peking. 
The rise of the Hans of China and 
Mongolia carried his fame and in- 
fluence to Mongolia where he was 
known as Bolbo-Khu (Bolbo being the 
Mongol for Nepal, and Khu meaning 
young man in that language), and was 
accorded god-like status—utter the 
name of Bolbo-Khu before a simple 
Mongol, and his head will bend in 
reverence. 
The Nepalese have never fought in 
the name of god or religion, and have 
no word for a crusade or holy war. 
Battles and fighting did of course 
occur during Nepal's long history, but 
the total number of people lost in all 
of them does not exceed a thousand. 
There have been no quarrels over 
language, or between sects. And yet 
Nepal is the home of the Gurkhas, 
whose bravery and valour were dis- 
played in helping to defend the world 
against tyranny in two world wars. 
In this there is no paradox. Nepal 
is proud of its age-old liberty and 
independence. lt has never been a 
colony of any foreign power. The 
people defended both themselves and 
others who called upon them for 
assistance. Non-alignment, opposition 
to all forms of racialism, colonialism 
and exploitation; peaceful co-existence 
and friendship for all—these have 
been the guiding characteristics of 
Nepal's foreign policy. 
However, Nepal had to undergo the 
nightmare of a century of family auto- 
cracy under the Ranas (from 1846 to 
1951) before democracy was restored 
by King Tribhuvan. The reign of his 
son and heir, King Mahendra, was one 
of reconstruction and progress. He 
installed the Panchayat system in 
1962. 
The main purpose of the Panchayat 
system is to ensure maximum partici- 
pation of people in government and 
administration by encouraging the 
development of local government 
institutions at different levels, and 
making them into an integral part of 
the structure of national government. 
The basic unit is the village Pan- 
chayat or council of village people, 
always a traditional concept in Nepal- 
ese society, but now given a new form 
and new functions. There are two 
political bodies at the village level: the 
Assembly, which includes all adult 
members of the village; and the Pan- 
chayat, or executive, consisting of 
eleven members elected by it on the 
basis of adult franchise, 
The successor of King Mahendra, 
the present King Birendra Bir Bikram 
Shah Dev, has come to the throne with 
new ideas and a deep understanding 
of world affairs and of the contem- 
porary problems facing his country. R

### 50505: An Art that conciliates gods and men, but countless Nepalese masterpieces are now threatened by the ravages of time, pilfering and modernization

by Ernest A. Connally 
EPAL remained an enigma to 
most of the world until it was 
opened to foreign visitors less than 
two decades ago. A land-locked 
kingdom stretching 500 miles along 
the southern slopes of the Himalayas, 
it is bordered by China (Tibet) on the 
north and India on the south. Its 
terrain varies from the jungles of the 
Terai to the snowy peak of Mount 
Everest. Kathmandu, the capital city, 
  
ERNEST A. CONNALLY js head of the office 
of Archaeology and Historic Preservation of 
the U.S. National Park Service, in Washington 
D.C. [In 1968 Unesco sent him to Nepal to 
advise on the preservation of Nepal's historic 
monuments and the promotion of cultural 
tourism. The author has written a more extensive 
presentation of the subject in a report on his mis- 
sion which he prepared for Unesco entitled 
“Nepal—Cultural Tourism.” 
  
stands in a valley at an elevation of 
4,500 feet. 
Unified as a kingdom just two 
centuries ago, Nepal is a geographic, 
ethnic, and cultural combination. With 
a population approaching 12 million, 
its peoples represent six or seven 
major ethnic strains. It is a land of 
regional distinction in social custom 
and dress. It is a land of three 
languages, a dozen dialects, and two 
major religions. 
Officially Hindu, the country is also 
heavily Buddhist. Temples of both 
often stand side by side, with some 
practices of faith tending to mingle. 
Inscriptions on the monuments are 
usually rendered in a version of 
Kiranti, the old Sanskrit-derived 
literary language. The major modern 
tongues are Nepali and Newari, while 
some dialects of Hindi are spoken 
along the Indian border. Although 
Nepali is now the lingua franca, it is 
less than 200 years old, having dev- 
eloped, with the unification of the 
kingdom, from Gurkali with borrow- 
ings from Hindi. Newari is the old 
language of the people of the Kath- 
mandu Valley, who knew themselves 
and their speech as Nepali. The term 
Newari came into standard use only 
after it was adopted by missionaries 
in the late 18th century. A synonym 
for Nepali, the name was merely 
spelled according to a dialectical 
pronunciation, 
The modern name Newari therefore 
denotes not only the language but also 
the people of the Kathmandu Valley. 
Their ancestors were the original 
Nepali, whose cultural hegemony pro- 
vided the kingdom with its name, its 
most important style in art and 
architecture, and its major monuments. 
The Kathmandu Valley is the cultural 
and historic heart of the kingdom. In 
this valley rises the sacred Bagmati 
River, flowing down to India. In this 
valley stand the important cities of 
Kathmandu, Patan, and Bhadgaon. 
The early history of the valley is 
obscure. It is certain, however, that 
its ancient inhabitants absorbed 
several waves of Indian immigration. 
Indian influence is strongly evident

4 and it is possible that the valley was 
subject to the Indian Emperor Asoka 
in the 3rd century B.C. Although 
Siddhartha Gautama, eventually known 
as Buddha, was born (c. 563 B.C.) at 
Lumbini on the southern frontier of 
modern Nepal, he made his career 
in India. And it was from India that 
the gods of Buddhism and Hinduism 
came ready-made to Nepal, where they 
assumed each others’ attributes and 
assimilated virtues of the old animistic 
belief. Nevertheless, ancient fetishes 
are still venerated and blood sacrifice 
persists. 
Apparently the gods gradually pen- 
etrated the valley through commercial 
and dynastic connexions with India. 
From the middle of the 4th century 
to the middle of the 8th the valley 
was controlled by the Licchavi and 
other dynasties related to princely 
Indian clans influenced by Gupta 
civilization. It was in these centuries 
and under that cultural stimulus that 
Nepalese art emerged. 
The earliest existing pieces of figure 
sculpture are dated to the 5th century. 
In the 7th century Chinese travellers 
remarked the skill of Nepalese artists. 
They mentioned the temples of both 
faiths standing side by side, as we 
see them today; and they described 
a seven-storied tower of the royal 
palace at Deopatan and multi-storied 
temples on the hills, 
It is possible that the Chinese 
travellers were describing pagodas, 
which they regarded as novelties. In 
any case, it is certain that basic forms 
in art and architecture had been 
established by the mid-7th century, 
from which time the Newari style 
radiated its influence beyond the valley 
to Tibet and finally to China. In the 
13th century, Newari artists were 
summoned to the service of Kublai 
Khan, 
Evidently the cities of Kathmandu, 
Patan, and Bhadgaon had not come 
into existence at the time of the 
Chinese visit in the 7th century, 
although by that time each may have 
+ had a nucleus in the form of a religious 
shrine. The cities came into im- 
portance only under the Malla dynasty 
in 1200 A.D. 
In Nepal religion is more than a 
faith; it is a way of life, integrated 
with all human action and always 
visibly evident. Thus an early English 
traveller to this remote, enigmatic land 
was prompted to observe that there 
were as many gods as men and as 
many temples as houses. Among the 
multitude of temples are three readily 
recognizable types: pagoda, stupa, 
sikhara. 
The pagoda is by far the most dis- 
tinctive and most numerous type. In 
all the variety of sizes in which it is 
found, the pagoda-temple characteris- 
tically consists of a square chamber 
containing the cult image, above which 
rises a series of progressively dimi- 
nishing hipped roofs. The tiers of roofs 
vary in number from two to five, three 
being commonest. The chamber is 
18 
usually constructed of brick, while the 
roofs are covered with small tiles or, 
in some cases, sheet metal. In a 
few extraordinary instances the sheet 
metal is gilded. 
The roofs are usually supported by 
wooden struts, carved and polychrom- 
ed, and the eaves are graced with 
a fringe of small bells. In larger exam- 
ples the cult chamber is surrounded 
by a colonnade of carved wood. The 
temple stands upon a paved terrace 
or platform. It is sometimes situated 
within an enclosed courtyard, spacious 
or restrictive; often it rises solo on a 
high stepped platform located at some 
irregular plaza within the town. 
As an architectural form, the pagoda 
may have been developed before the 
7th century; however, it is doubtful 
that any existing example can be dated 
earlier than the year 1400. The Temple 
of Changu Narayan at Changu, the 
construction of which is dated to 1401, 
may be the oldest existing pagoda. 
While the pagoda is used by Hindus 
and Buddhists alike, the stupa is pecu- 
liar to Buddhism alone. Characteristi- 
cally, the stupa is an artifical mound 
of hemispherical shape and symbolic 
meaning. Scattered throughout the 
kingdom are numerous stupas that are 
mere mounds of earth of varying size. 
Others are regular architectural cons- 
tructions in brick and stucco, also of 
various sizes. 
The two largest and most important 
examples in the valley are Bodhnath at 
Baudha and the Swayambhu or Swa- 
yambhunath stupa at Sengu west of 
Kathmandu. The latter consists of the 
characteristic large mound finished 
with stucco and periodically white- 
washed. Atop the mound is a cubical 
tower painted on its four faces with 
pairs of all-seeing eyes. [tis surmount- 
ed by a spire of successively diminish- 
ing rings of burnished metal culmi- 
nating in a delicate gilded umbrella. 
The stupa is situated on a platform 
on a hill. It is surrounded by a host 
of small temples and lesser monu- 
ments, some in cut stone, and a num- 
ber of monastic buildings. 
The introduction of the stupa into 
Nepal is claimed as early as the 3rd 
century B.C. However, the dates of 
existing stupas are very uncertain. 
The sikhara is a North Indian temple- 
form, an apparently recent importation, 
clearly revealing its origin. It is char- 
acterized by a tall slender dome, sug- 
gesting the shape of a folded umbrella, 
usually rising above colonnaded plat- 
forms. The umbrella-like dome is built 
hollow, the shell being laid in corbel- 
led masonry, stone or brick. 
The brick examples are plastered on 
the exterior. Fairly common, they can 
be found here and there among the 
pagodas. A conspicuous, rich example 
in cut stone is the Temple of Krishna 
Mandir (dated about 1630) in Durbar 
Square, Patan. Although the sikhara 
is most readily identified with Hin- 
duism, the form is used by Buddhists 
as well. The Mahabaudha Temple in

### 50505: An Art that conciliates gods and men, but countless Nepalese masterpieces are now threatened by the ravages of time, pilfering and modernization

AN ART THAT CONCILIATES GODS AND MEN (Continued from page 18) 
Patan (south of Kathmandu) is an 
extraordinary version in moulded terra 
cotta. 
The temples rarely stand isolated 
from their surroundings. They are in- 
tegrated into the neighbourhoods of 
the cities and towns, and they are 
found in monumental groupings both 
urban and rural. The sensitive compo- 
sition of these ensembles, which are 
particular expressions of an old and 
unique civilization, clearly demons- 
trates the Newari genius in ordering 
the environment. 
Everywhere one sees evidence of 
that thrifty regard for the land that 
suits the needs of a long-established, 
agriculture-oriented society. Every- 
where one sees terraced fields lying 
at the foot of surrounding hills, forming 
the picturesque scenery that is 
characteristic of the valley. 
One can see the same attitude 
expressed in the stepped platforms of 
the temples, which figure so impor- 
tantly in community life, and in the 
compactness of the temple groups and 
their overall terraced structure. 
In Patan, the Temple of Red Mach- 
hendra, venerated by both Buddhists 
and Hindus, is a rich pagoda standing 
on a low platform near the centre of a 
large grassy quadrangle enclosed by 
secular buildings. The temple precinct 
serves as a public space, and play- 
ground, in the daily life of the people. 
On the platform about the temple are 
low columns supporting some of the 
valley's finest and most delicate bronze 
sculptures. 
The ground plan of the temple group 
at Changu shows temples of several 
sizes and lesser monuments on a 
terrace enclosed by low colonnaded 
structures, with approaching stairs and

of water having been remarked by 
travellers since the 7th century. 
The Newari's strong sense of com- 
munity, together with their sensitive 
  
RELIGIOUS TOLERANCE. Buddhism 
and Hinduism in Nepal are practised 
side by side and even draw on each 
other's spiritual traditions. An example 
of this spirit of harmony is 
the religious festival shown here, where 
a Buddhist lama from the stupa of 
Bodhnath occupies a place of honour 
before a Hindu temple at Bhadgaon.

Nagas (serpents) being an ancient 
Nepalese and Hindu cult.

regard for the landscape and their 
thrifty use of space, produced a sus- 
taining balance in the building of 
towns, which was achieved through 
physical devices. 
The irregular pattern of circulation 
indicates a process of organic growth, 
with consequent variety of view and 
spatial transition. The uniformity of 
house design, however, provides con- 
sistency, while throughout the overall 
pattern there is an even balance bet- 
ween built-up and open areas. 
Among the open areas are walled 
green spaces for private use and 
accessible public spaces of varying 
size for community purposes. And 
finally there is the rectangular temple 
square, with its rich monuments inte- 
grated near the centre, and on the 
edges of the settlement the usual 
water tanks and terraces. 
An important visual aspect of the 
Newari legacy are the townscapes, 
resulting from the natural terrain and 
appropriate ways of building on it. 
Although individuality is not lacking 
among the towns, there are many 
common characteristics which are per- 
ceived on approach, as to Chapagaon, 
by traditional paths that were never 
meant for means of transport other 
than pedestrian. 
The rush to modernity poses a 
serious threat. Immediate effects are 
already evident in the city of Kath- 
mandu and the Kathmandu Valley. 
Serious intrusions into the compact 
consistency of the historic core of 
Kathmandu followed the earthquake 
of 1934, which provided the occasion 
for opening several wide straight 
streets and rebuilding in a dull aca- 
demic style, the white stucco of which 
stands in sharp contrast to the tradi- 
tional buildings of natural brick and 
carved wood. Because of their increas- 
ing size, concrete construction, and 
stucco finish, the new buildings intro- 
duce a jarring note in the historic 
urban core. 
Industrial development threatens to 
conflict with cultural values. Road 
construction is often undertaken with- 
out sufficient regard for the old 
traditional balance between the natural 
and the man-made in the countryside, 
or without sufficient respect for tra- 
ditional built-up areas. 
At Baudha, the main street has been 
widened by the removal of houses 
along one side of the old road. Their 
replacements are unsympathetic to the 
old houses on the opposite side, which 
were suffered to remain and need res- 
toration. Furthermore, the old gateway 
to the important Bodhnath stupa was 
destroyed. Small and restricted, like 
a keyhole, it provided a sudden and 
dramatic revelation of the monument 
as one entered the sacred precinct 
from the road. Now there is an open, 
axial approach and the old spatial 
control is gone. 
Although some restoration work is 
being done on the temples, the great 
majority suffer steady decay. It is 
estimated that some wooden construc- 
tions will be lost through structural 
failure within ten or fifteen years. 
Meanwhile on many temples we can 
see makeshift protective devices in 
the prevalent corrugated iron roofs 
and the stiffeners added to the carved 
wooden struts that support the eaves. 
Apparently it is the rise of tourism 
that has prompted the pilfering of carv- 
ed wood, metal work, inscriptions, 
and other decorative items from the 
temples. Presumably these objects are 
destined for the clandestine curio 
market. The problem seems to be 
growing and is serious for a number 
of reasons. 
Among them is the loss of those 
small metal plates, so easily portable, 
bearing inscriptions pertaining to the 
construction of the temple, which may 
be otherwise unrecorded. Once it is 
detached there is practically no way 
to determine to what specific temple a 
plate may belong. 
Another loss, of course, is artistic. 
For example, the temple of Vishnu in 
Patan has been stripped of its copper 
repoussé door surround and other 
metal work. Other monuments have 
suffered the same indignity, and the 
problem of adequate control is very 
difficult. 
Several important steps have been 
taken by His Majesty's Government 
for the preservation and development 
of historic sites and monuments. A 
National Planning Commission has 
been created at the ministerial level. 
It is composed of five members, all 
recognized as leading professionals, 
including a member for regional deve- 
lopment, 
The formation of the Planning Com- 
mission provides the most promising 
means for ensuring inter-ministerial 
coordination in all phases of economic 
and physical development, including 
the preservation and development of 
the Kingdom's rich and unique legacy 
of historic cities, towns, sites, and 
monuments.

Lotus eyes of the Buddha

According to Buddhist tradition, the first great stupas 
were built during the reign of the Indian emperor Ashoka 
in the third century B.C. and were erected in the region 
of present day Nepal. The Tibetan Chorten is derived 
from the Indian Stdpa or Caitya, and its architecture 
developed from the pre-Buddhistic autochthonous Indian 
grave-mound. Under these mounds the saintly ascetics 
were buried; their bodies were seated on the ground in 
Yoga posture and then covered over with earth. These 
dome-shaped graves, or tumuli, of the saints were 
regarded as holy places. 
In Nepal today the former sepulchral mound rises as 
the gigantic dome of a temple, and from these famous 
Nepalese Eye-Chortens, the eyes of Buddha—above the 
coupola—gaze in four directions. Analogous but smaller 
Chortens were built in the far east of Bhutan; according 
to local reports, they were constructed at the end of the 
eighth century. 
The basic structure of a Chorten consists of a square 
foundation symbolizing the earth, a dome symbolizing 
water, and thirteen tapering steps of enlightenment 
symbolizing the element of fire. These steps lead to a 
stylized parasol, the symbol of wind, which is topped in 
the ethereal sphere by the well-known “twin-symbol” 
uniting sun and moon, which is the shimmering crown of 
a Chorten.

From temple precincts to terraced 
rice-fields, an extraordinary civilization 
flourishes in harmony with nature 
Py oe hr 2 LT 
Ra Ad SP 
The first complete survey-inventory of the cultural and historical monuments of the 
Kathmandu valley in Nepal has recently been completed by Carl Pruscha of Austria, a 
U.N. town planning specialist, in collaboration with Nepalese experts. Covering well 
over 800 monuments, settlements, sanctuaries and nature preserves, the inventory will 
serve as the basis for Nepal's global plan for the preservation of its rich cultural and 
natural heritage. The preservation plan and the detailed inventory of the Kathmandu 
valley's monuments and sites are to be published as a two-volume study early in 1975 
by the Government of Nepal with financial support from Unesco, the John D. Rocke- 
feller lll Fund and the Austrian Government (1). Entitled “The Kathmandu Valley: The 
Preservation of Physical Environment and Cultural Heritage (A Protective Inventory)”, 
the study was prepared by Carl Pruscha, in conjunction with Nepalese colleagues..In 
the article that follows, Carl Pruscha describes the main features of the Kathmandu 
valley and its historic sites set in an environment of extraordinary beauty. 
(1) Published by Anton Schroll Publishers (Vienna, Austria,’ and Munich, Fed. ‘Rep. of Germany). The two volumes 
(296 and 264 pages) are illustrated with 873 black and white photo reproductions and 831 line-drawings, and have an 
explanatory text in English. Price, for the two volumes, about US. $65.

### 50507: The Valley of Kathmandu: from temple precincts to terraced rice-fields, an extraordinary civilization flourishes in harmony with nature

  
The Nepalese mastery of the art of shaping their environment is revealed both in their 
temple architecture and in the intensively cultivated terraced hillsides where they grow 
rice and other crops. These terraces harmonize perfectly with the steps and staircases 
of many of Nepal's temples, such as Pashupatinath Temple (opposite page), Nepal's 
national shrine, which stands on the banks of the sacred Bagmati river near Kathmandu. 
by Carl Pruscha 
  
CARL PRUSCHA of Austria, is an architect, 
town planner and landscape artist, and has been 
working since the beginning of 1965 in Nepal 
for the United Nations, He helped the Nepal 
government to set up a Department of Physical 
Planning, and between 1967 and 1973 was its 
regular consultant. He helped direct and carry 
out Nepal's major monument survey in the 
Kathmandu valley. 
N our present age, mankind can 
claim to have conquered and ex- 
tended its dominion over all the earth, 
—but at the cost of destroying an 
earthly paradise. Many of the world's 
incomparable sites, shaped by nature 
or the hand of man, are already damag- 
ed or destroyed. The few that still 
remain to us are today threatened by 
an almost irresistible tide of ugliness 
and defacement. 
Thus we often find ourselves 
looking back in a spiritual search for 
the old lost havens of the world. In 
our hunger for a Shangri-La we are 
drawn back to the snow-capped roof 
of the world, the Himalayas, There, 
on any mountain peak, we seem to 
glimpse the Hindu god Shiva, whose 
icy locks melt into the valleys and flow 
in many tributaries to the Ganges. 
Between these cold mountain 
streams rushing down into the depths, 
we find an oval-shaped island of 
tranquillity—the valley of Kathmandu. 
It is not hard, seeing it, to believe the 
legend that this was once a great lake. 
In the centre of the lake lay a small 
island, on which the primordial Buddha, 
Vairocana, sprang from a lotus bud. 
When Manjushri, the bodhisattva 
(or future Buddha), personifying 
supreme wisdom, travelled from Tibet 
to worship the primordial Buddha, he 
first used his sword to cleave gaps in 
the chain of hills surrounding the 
valley, to let the waters drain away. 
This one-time island—now a hill 
—became the site of one of the 
oldest Buddhist temples in the world. 
This Stupa of Swayambhunath (the 
self-existent Lord) displays in many 
versions the Buddhist Mandala, a 
graphic mystic symbol of the universe, 
combining the geometric forms of the 
circle and the square. 
A steep flight of stairs leads up to 
the stupa from the east. On the top- 
most level stands Akshobhya (one of 
the five “Buddhas of Meditation”), his 
right hand pointing down to the earth. 
Akshobhya's colour is blue, his element 
is the air and his symbol is the vajra 
(see photo page 37). To the south 
is the Buddha Ratnasambhava making 
the gift-bestowing gesture. His colour 
is yellow, his element is the earth and 
his symbol is the jewel. To the west 
stands the Buddha Amitabha in the 
posture of meditation. His colour is 
red, his element is fire, and his sym- p

> bol is the lotus. To the north is the 
Buddha Amoghasiddhi, the fifth Buddha 
of Meditation, in the posture of 
protection. His colour is green, his 
element is water and his symbol is 
the sword. In the centre of the stupa 
is the primordial Buddha himself, Vai- 
rocana, making the gesture of teaching. 
His colour is white, his element is the 
ether, and the wheel is his symbol. 
However far back in time this 
Buddhist holy place was founded, its 
presence in the valley has made it 
the focal point and cradle of an 
unusual civilization, spanning many 
centuries, and still flourishing today. 
The valley of Kathmandu, a unique 
centre of peace and serenity, is still 
filled with the spiritual strength which 
inspired its original inhabitants to 
found this civilization. 
The highly fertile soil of the old lake 
bottom provides the local population 
with their material needs. The symbol 
of this dependence on nature's bounty 
is the rice shoot, whose production 
imposes a basic set of rules for 
keeping man in touch with his environ- 
ment. These rules have never been 
written down, but they are universally 
seen as the basis for the survival of 
the population and the preservation of 
a healthy environment. They hold the 
streams to be holy; they determine the 
amount of land that should be’ culti- 
vated, and they preserve the integrity 
of woods and forests. 
Settlements and towns have been 
set up on terraced slopes but always 
close to streams and groves, and often 
in the proximity of sacred rivers on 
whose banks the ritual cremation of the 
dead takes place. 
The settlements themselves, per- 
fectly fitted into the contours of the 
land, are as compact as possible and 
laid out in concentric rings according 
to occupation—from priests, merchants 
craftsmen and farmers down to those 
who carry out the lowliest tasks in 
the community. 
The handing down of role and 
function over the generations within 
the settlements rules out any outward 
spillover into further rings, which 
imposes an upward, vertical growth 
pattern on the population. Once the 
limits of this have been reached, 
daughter settlements spring up outside 
the original site, but following the 
same pattern. In this way, 29 settle- 
ments of varying sizes have grown up 
around the three royal cities of Kath- 
mandu, Patan and Bhadgaon. 
While the basic occupation of the 
population is the cultivation of rice, 
each settlement also has its own 
typical manufacturing speciality. Thus 
Thimi is well-known as the centre for

### 50509: The Mandala sanctuary of Bodhnath

THE ‘MANDALA 
SANCTUARY 
OF BODHNATH 
Aerial photo at left shows the 
great Buddhist stupa of Bodhnath near 
Kathmandu, much frequented by 
Tibetan pilgrims. The stupa’s form is 
that of the mandala, the geometric 
diagram combining circles and squares 
which in Tantric Buddhism symbolizes 
the universe and the spiritual forces. 
Mandala motifs can also be seen in 
photo, opposite page, of scene in 
temple courtyard in Patan during the 
festival of Machendranath, the god 
of Abundance, where women have 
set out ritual offerings. Below, 
prayer wheels line the outer wall 
of the base of the stupa of 
Swayambhunath. In turning prayer 
wheels, Buddhists follow the example 
of the Buddha who, in his first 
preachings at Sarnath, began 
“to turn the wheel of doctrine”.

### 50509: The Mandala sanctuary of Bodhnath

Text © Copyright. 
Reproduction prohibited 
T he Buddhist sanctuary of Bodh- 
nath, to the east of Kathmandu, 
should first be viewed from the air. 
Only from this vantage point does 
its form of a mandala, or mystic 
symbol of the universe, stand out 
with striking clarity. One first 
distinguishes a triple circle forming 
the outer corona of the monument: 
the houses of Tibetan pilgrims, the 
circular street, and the first wall 
surrounding the stupa, around which 
the faithful walk ritually to the left. 
The triple circle symbolizes the 
wheel of reincarnations, the endless 
cycle of life and death, the temporal 
world, constantly beset by unrest, 
from all of which Buddhist teaching 
seeks to free us. 
The Infinite and Eternal, constant 
and immutable, is represented by 
the monument itself, the stupa 
with the “all-seeing eyes of Sup- 
reme Buddhahood” gazing from it. 
All around it, hollowed within the 
outer wall, is an immense niche 
containing prayer-wheels, worn and 
dented from use by generations 
of pilgrims. Behind them, deco- 
rating the rear of the niche, is 
a frieze of blue and orange Buddhas 
whose colours are renewed on the 
occasion of each pilgrimage. 
Within the enclosure, five terraces 
serve as the pedestal of the stupa 
itself, representing the five elements 
(ether, air, earth, fire, water) and 
the five directions (The Zenith, 
East, South, West, North). Symbol 
of the immutable celestial world, the 
dome nevertheless does sometimes 
change in colour. When | saw it 
first, shortly after it had been struck 
by lightning, it was dingy and 
greyish with piles of blackened 
wood at its base. But at the time of 
pilgrimages it is whitewashed all 
over and then covered with saffron 
offered by the pilgrims. 
The spectacle of this ochre-col- 
oured dome, blending perfectly 
with the gilded bell-tower of the 
stupa during these festive occasions, 
is enhanced by myriads of prayer- 
banners rising towards the summit 
of the monument and to the sky. 
These fluttering streamers, brought 
as offerings by the pilgrims, are 
inscribed with the texts of Tibetan 
prayers. There are white ones 
representing clouds, others as blue 
as the sky, green representing water, 
yellow symbolizing the earth, and 
red ones the colour of fire.

### 50507: The Valley of Kathmandu: from temple precincts to terraced rice-fields, an extraordinary civilization flourishes in harmony with nature

  
VALLEY OF KATHMANDU (Continued from page 32) 
pottery, Sankhu for its cotton-weaving, 
Khokana for its oil-pressing industry, 
and the tiny village of Pyangaon for 
basket-weaving. 
The houses in the Kathmandu valley 
are built of tiles, either fired- or wind- 
dried. The roofs, built in heavy wood 
with wide guttering, are covered by 
small rectangular fired tiles, which 
from a distance give the impression 
that each house has been topped with 
a hand-woven woollen blanket. 
The dwellings, set up on tiny patches 
of land, have storage space for tools 
on the ground floor, bedrooms on the 
first floor and a big living room and 
kitchen on the second. The dining 
room and private prayer room are on 
the top floor. The houses are normally 
built round an inner courtyard, to allow 
the inhabitants to live together as 
though forming a single big family. 
Since the houses are too small to 
36 
allow much social communication 
outside the immediate family, covered 
platforms have been built at cross- 
roads and squares, where the men of 
the town can meet and talk together. 
The women have their own meeting 
places by the springs, where they go 
daily to bathe, wash clothing and to 
fetch drinking water. 
in the centre of each town can be 
found special gathering places built 
round the symbol of godliness, the 
many-roofed pagodas constructed on 
stepped pyramids. This particular 
architectural form, which the in- 
habitants of the Kathmandu valley 
claim to have invented, can now be 
found in the area in a hundred different 
versions, 
These pagodas with their steps are 
often used by hundreds of spectators 
as vantage points from which to watch 
the frequent and often lively festivals, 
while their spreading roofs offer shade 
and protection from the rain. 
But it is not only within the towns 
and settlements that holy places can 
be found. They exist also in great 
numbers in the open country beyond. 
These sanctuaries are smaller but 
sometimes more important, since many 
can be traced back to ancient 
times. Some are built of pipal trees 
of giant size, or undressed stone. 
Many such holy places are no more 
than chambers dug in the soil—per- 
haps as a sign of the close link with 
the Earth Mother. 
All these many holy places, without 
exception, harmonize with their natural 
surroundings, in settings which under- 
line their significance. The majority 
of sites are by streams and rivers, 
such as those of Pashupati and 
Guheshwari, Gokarna, Sankhunul and

### 50507: The Valley of Kathmandu: from temple precincts to terraced rice-fields, an extraordinary civilization flourishes in harmony with nature

GUARDIANS 
OF 
THE 
SHRINES 
Left, statues of elephants 
and a lion guard the long flight 
of steps leading up to Nepal's 
tallest pagoda, the five-storey 
Nyatapola Temple at Bhadgaon. 
In Nepal, where there is a long 
tradition of religious tolerance, 
pagodas are used by Hindus and 
Buddhists alike. A form of 
Buddhism widely practised in 
Nepal is Tantrism, so named 
after its Holy Scriptures, the 
Tantra. An important ritual 
object of Tantric Buddhism is the 
"vajra”, or thunderbolt, symbol 
of the Absolute. Photo right

of Swayambhunath stupa near 
Kathmandu. Most vajras are 
much smaller in size and are held 
in the hand by monks as a sacred 
sceptre. 
Chobar. Many are set by springs and 
pools, as at Buddhanilkhantha, Goda- 
vari or Balaju. Others, such as Chan- 
gunarayan, stand on hilltops. Forests 
and grottoes have also been chosen 
as sanctuaries for many divinities. 
The sites are regularly visited by the 
inhabitants of the valley, either singly 
or in groups. Once a year thousands 
of persons make their way across the 
fields on pilgrimages to the most 
important sanctuaries. 
The care and veneration shown by 
the valley's inhabitants for their settle- 
ments and towns, their temples and 
holy places, is closely matched by 
their concern for the natural environ- 
ment, in the sowing and harvesting of 
the rice which is their staple diet. 
Thus, farming becomes an artistic 
creation. Over the centuries, the face 
of the land has been shaped by this 
process. Thousands of terraces have 
been constructed and the landscape 
veined by countless canals to irrigate 
the growing rice. This great task of 
landscaping has been carried out with 
no other tools but simple hoes. 
Now the valley has hardly an acre 
of land which has not been pressed 
into use. Here man has genuinely 
conquered the earth—but without 
destroying it. In close creative inter- 
play, man and nature have developed 
together. 
When the dry winter etches the grey 
tones of the terraces against the 
white backdrop of mountain peaks, 
  
the handiwork of man is most clearly 
seen for a few short weeks. Soon 
the heavy monsoon rains turn the 
picture into a waterscape, with 
hundreds of small lakes rising in tiers. 
Then, very soon, the rice begins to 
grow—looking from a distance like 
light moss—and fills the landscape 
with innumerable shades ‘of green. 
Finally comes the ripening, and the 
rice takes on a burning brightness 
ranging from yellow to orange. 
The settlements themselves, built of 
the same material and the same earth, 
also change with the seasons, always 
maintaining their essential relationship 
with the soil on which they stand. 
Until now this people has preserved 
intact its environment, maintained its 
traditional way of life based on its 
system of the extended family and 
continued undisturbed its communion 
with the spiritual and the infinite. 
But today the people of the Kath- 
mandu valley face a critical choice: 
whether to build their future quietly 
on the foundations of their past, and 
go on living in their own paradise, or 
whether to opt for a 20th-century way 
of life so often beset with commercia- 
lism and the errors of misapplied tech- 
nology. 
Is it not the duty of the entire world 
community to help them in seeking a 
solution to this problem ? [|

### 50500: What future for our ancient cities?

WHAT FUTURE FOR OUR ANCIENT CITIES ? 
Continued from page 6 
Sanitary considerations often go 
hand in hand with other concerns 
closely related to politics or the 
problems of policing a city. Slum 
buildings can provide a refuge for 
swarms of unskilled workers, unsettled, 
difficult to keep track of and viewed 
with suspicion by better housed and 
more prosperous citizens. Such ac- 
commodation then becomes suspect 
and a target for rigorous action, which 
is another aspect of the “cleaning- 
up" process. 
BM Then there is the spectre of popu- 
lation pressure. In some big cities, 
extremely rapid growth calls for a 
judicious use of space, and some 
technicians would not hesitate to tear 
down two- or three-storey buildings in 
a historic centre and replace them 
with high-rise constructions. They 
imagine that this will increase the 
amount of accommodation, although 
experience has often shown that this 
is an illusion, since redevelopment 
schemes in city centres generally 
encourage the building of offices and 
banks rather than new houses, 
MW Some clearer motivations are ex- 
pressed in economic terms. Historic 
towns or localities overcrowded with 
people who are poor if not actually 
destitute, appear to be unjustifiably 
occupying space and preventing it 
from being put to more profitable use. 
To let these buildings stand, goes 
the argument, means restoring hun- 
dreds of buildings, constructing miles 
of roads, and laying endless lengths 
of cables. Even if this kind of pro- 
gramme caused property values to 
rise, it would still be unprofitable, and 
thus in many countries financially 
unacceptable to the authorities. 
On the other hand, urban develop- 
ment schemes which are initially 
presented as partial renovation pro- 
grammes but are designed to spread, 
seem infinitely more profitable. And 
so they are—for some. 
HM The most frequent cause of demo- 
lition is a controversial though still 
widely practised form of town planning, 
in which the needs of traffic take 
precedence over everything else. 
By first opening up a few roads in 
a town of historic interest, so as to 
reduce traffic congestion, and then 
laying out avenues, crossing the town 
in various directions, it is thought that 
the town's essential historic features 
—buildings, a celebrated view, a 
restored quarter—will have been 
preserved. 
The truth is that the original layout 
38 
will have been distorted, the city 
disfigured and disorganized and soon 
destroyed as an urban ensemble. 
This process has happened too often 
over the last 50 years to need elabor- 
ation. Whenever short-term planning 
gives absolute priority to the road 
system and the needs of motor traffic, 
it regards groups of buildings from the 
pre-industrial era as obstacles and 
treats them as such, irrespective of 
their size and value as monuments. 
'W Some villages of historical interest 
are subject to the same pressures, in 
spite of—or because of—their renown. 
Although city-dwellers who buy houses 
in these villages as week-end homes 
may respect their style and pro- 
portions, the same cannot be said for 
the shop-keepers, craftsmen, con- 
tractors and developers who “pro- 
liferate in their wake, 
The more a village is uniform in 
style and appearance, and the more 
harmoniously it fits into the landscape, 
the more vulnerable it is. It can be 
spoiled within a few years by devel- 
opers who were originally attracted by 
its solitude, its uniqueness and its 
historic charm—in other words, by its 
“undeveloped” state. 
Local and State authorities who are 
thinking of protecting a historic 
locality, town or site, have usually 
gone beyond the stage of making out 
a case for the preservation of cultural 
property. Yet nearly always they 
have to overcome the kind of argu- 
ments and practices described above. 
They should realize that calculations 
for urban renovation projects are not 
always reliable guides, except in 
quantitative terms which do not take 
into account every aspect of the 
social costs involved. 
The quality of life in a city cannot 
be measured in financial terms. The 
urban development schemes which are 
most successful in the eyes of their 
promoters are not necessarily those 
which, in the long run, are beneficial 
to the community. 
Some highly industrialized countries 
have also become aware in recent 
years that if millions of old dwellings 
were repaired and restored, they would 
last as long as, if not longer than, 
present-day constructions. As such 
they represent a considerable capital 
asset, which would be almost totally 
lost if they were demolished. 
Thus a rational housing policy 
should consider preservation as part 
of its overall approach to housing, 
especially since the renovation of old 
dwellings will continue to be for a 
long time to come the chief means of 
providing homes for the poorer mem- 
bers of the community. Bringing new 
life to historic localities, in particular, 
has become an economic and social 
necessity as well as a cultural one. 
Today, when attempts are being 
made to redefine the goals of progress 
and to measure them against the 
hazards of growth, and when defenders 
of the environment are challenging 
many forms of destructive exploitation, 
it has become quite clear that old 
towns are among the irreplaceable 
resources which no country can afford 
to sacrifice. 
 
An international 
inquiry on 
national laws 
for the protection 
of historic sites 
N 1973, at Unesco's request, the 
International Council of Monu- 
ments and Sites carried out an inquiry 
among its 45 national committees on 
current laws and regulations for the 
protection of historic sites and towns 
and groups of ancient buildings. 
The results of the survey show 
strikingly that protection is inadequate 
in almost every country and that diffe- 
rent countries have adopted different 
measures. 
Very few of them have special laws 
or regulations for the preservation of 
historic quarters, towns or sites, drawn 
up and enforced jointly by the two 
authorities usually responsible for such 
measures, that is, the historic monu- 
ments services and those in charge of 
building and town planning. 
From the survey it appears that this 
is the case only in France and Bulgaria. 
Elsewhere the protection of historic 
quarters is covered by laws for the 
safeguarding of the cultural heritage 
(as in Czechoslovakia, Hungary, 
Mexico, Poland, Tunisia, Venezuela 
and Vatican City), or comes under 
building and town-planning (in Den- 
mark, Finland, and Luxembourg). 
In other countries the system is still 
more complex, and historic localities 
are protected by various laws and 
regulations, dealing either with the 
protection of the cultural heritage

### 50500: What future for our ancient cities?

To preserve these towns in all their 
diversity is to give the people who 
live in them today a longed-for 
opportunity for social life. The 
modern town-dweller is not filled with 
nostalgia for the past, but he yearns 
for an art of living, and this should 
not be rejected when the only 
alternative offered to him is the cult 
of the motor car, in a world of steel 
and concrete. 
it is precisely because anonymity 
and isolation seem impossible in old 
towns and quarters that they are today 
attracting the children and grand- 
children of those who deserted them. 
And partly for the same reasons they 
are attracting builders with highly 
original ideas. Many architects and 
town planners believe that the old 
towns disparaged by their predeces- 
sors are not just relics of the past but 
models from which they can draw 
inspiration. 
Many young people feel strongly 
that these historic towns and buildings 
must be preserved. In some countries 
it is the young who most of all frequent 
the old parts of cities and when 
necessary fight to save them from 
destruction. Perhaps they feel that 
when an old town is destroyed, 
something more than its familiar 
streets is destroyed with it. 
For an overwhelming majority of 
people, untouched by the culture 
acquired from books, old cities are 
the only historical evidence they can 
perceive and understand. Old cities 
are the repositories of the struggles, 
customs and aspirations of those who 
gradually shaped the world in which 
we live, 
In its old towns and cities, more 
surely than in its national language, a 
country can discover the roots of its 
personality. For the generations of 
our time, cut off from the common 
past, historic cities are becoming the 
collective memory of mankind. The 
disappearance of such places would 
condemn them to live in the uncer- 
tainty and isolation of men with no 
remembrance of the past. 
or with town-planning, which have 
usually been drawn up separately by 
each of the authorities concerned (as 
in Spain, Italy and U.K.). 
A number of countries still have no 
protection system, though some of 
them are currently preparing new laws 
and regulations. 
Only in a few of the countries 
covered by the survey do laws for the 
protection of historic localities and 
sites require a detailed inventory to 
be drawn up of the buildings in the 
protected area. This is essential if 
the laws are to be effectively applied. 
In Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czechoslovakia, 
France, Italy, Mexico, and Spain these 
inventories are now being prepared. 
In other countries, quite a large 
number of national committees of the 
International Council of Monuments 
and Sites (Cyprus, Finland, Italy, 
l.uxembourg, Mexico, Switzerland, Tu- 
nisia and Venezuela) consider that the 
national lawmaking machinery is in- 
adequate. This applies particularly 
to financing and the supervision of 
restoration and renovation. 
Finally, even where laws are 
deemed adequate, as in Bulgaria, 
Czechoslovakia, Denmark, France, 
Hungary, Poland and Spain, problems 
arise in implementing them. The main 
difficulties are a lack of supervision, 
penalties which are too light or not 
enforced, lack of interest or under- 
standing by authorities and individuals, 
and shortage of funds. 
An international agreement on these 
questions would thus be of service to 
all those concerned with the protection 
of historic localities and towns. 
In Unesco's view, action for the pre- 
servation of ancient cities comes 
within the broader context of several 
crucial modern problems including the 
need to improve the quality of life. A 
series of international recommenda- 
tions or conventions sponsored by 
Unesco has carefully defined the 
principles and aims of the preservation 
of the environment. 
The Recommendation concerning 
the protection of the beauty and 
character of landscapes and sites, 
adopted in 1962, for instance, warns 
against the dangers of “uncontrolled 
urban development”. The Recommen- 
dation on the preservation of cultural 
property endangered by public or 
private works, adopted in 1968, 
stresses that it is urgent to “harmonize 
the preservation of the cultural heritage 
with changes due to social and 
economic development.” 
Similarly, the Recommendation con- 
cerning the protection, at the national 
level, of the cultural and natural 
heritage, adopted in 1972, recognizes 
that it is “essential for human equilib- 
rium and development to preserve a 
setting in contact with nature and the 
evidence of civilization bequeathed by 
past generations.” 
Lastly, the Convention on the pro- 
tection of -the world cultural and 
natural heritage, also adopted in 1972, 
declares that “the deterioration or 
disappearance of any part of the 
cultural or natural heritage constitutes 
a harmful impoverishment of the 
heritage of all nations.” 
It is with these ideas in mind that 
Unesco is now drawing up an inter- 
national regulation for the protection 
of historic localities, cities and sites 
and their integration into a modern 
environment. Preservation, in this 
context, means planning based on a 
global concept of the environment. 
Thus, far from being restrictive, it 
forms an integral part of the economic 
and social development of the whole 
urban or rural environment. 
Following more consultations, it is 
hoped that this international regulation 
will be ready in 1976, and that it will 
encourage States to adopt effective 
legal measures. 
Two conclusions can already be 
drawn. The first is that the protection 
of historic cities and localities, and 
especially their maintenance and 
restoration (as in the case of natural 
and archaeological sites) must become 
an integral part of the reorganization 
and development of the urban area 
or region concerned. 
This decision must be taken at the 
highest level by authorities responsible 
for overall development. In certain 
cases it must be taken by the govern- 
ment itself and, in any event, it should 
involve not only the minister for 
culture, but also the ministers for 
economic affairs, development or 
equipment, planning and finance. 
Only such authorities are able to study 
ways and means, authorize operations 
and make financial provision. 
Neither competence and devotion 
at subordinate levels nor the en- 
thusiasm and alertness of cultural 
organizations can replace this political 
determination. Maintenance and res- 
toration is a component of global 
planning and an integral part of the 
reorganization of a locality or region. 
Only a government decision to protect 
and restore historical centres can 
ensure that laws will be drawn up, 
funds will be made available and other 
measures taken. 
The second conclusion is that the 
cultural renewal of a town, locality or 
village would be meaningless if no 
way was found to arouse the interest 
of local people who, in any case, must 
participate in the project. it some- 
times happens that the renovation of 
old quarters is mainly due to the effort 
of private individuals, the authorities 
providing only legal advice and 
technical aid. Yet even when auth- 
orities make a more important con- 
tribution, the participation of the 
community is still indispensable. 
Historic cities, it has been said, must 
be preserved for mankind and for pos- 
terity. This is true. But first and 
foremost they must be protected and 
restored for the men and women who 
live in them, with their collaboratio 
and for their benefit. |

15 cities launching 
major preservation operations 
D URING the past 15 years Unesco has mobilized interna- 
tional aid for the conservation and restoration of monu- 
ments and other cultural treasures in many parts of the 
world. In particular it has been directly associated with 
operations for the protection and renovation of historic 
cities and sites. The following brief account of several of 
these projects shows how Unesco is helping some of its 
member states to preserve historic sites, while integrating 
them into modern urbanism. 
Kyoto (Japan) 
In September 1970, the Japanese 
National Commission for Unesco and 
the Agency for Cultural Affairs of the 
Japanese Ministry of Education orga- 
nized an international symposium on 
the preservation of historic localities, 
particularly in the ancient city of Kyoto, 
Japan's former capital. 
The symposium, held in Kyoto, 
showed that the concept of a 
historic locality was not legally or 
administratively recognized in Japan 
and that commercial development, ur- 
ban renovation projects, and changes 
in social and economic patterns of 
daily life were seriously endangering 
the quality of the environment in one 
of the most beautiful of Japanese cities. 
In April 1972, following the interna- 
tional symposium, the Kyoto Munici- 
pality decided: 
HB To designate seven scenic beauty 
zones in the city, Within these zones, 
areas around five major historic monu- 
ments and two historic localities locat- 
ed east of the Kamo River were to be 
placed under the protection and control 
of the municipality; 
HB To limit the construction of large 
modern structures in more than half 
of the city. 
The Municipality also designated his- 
toric areas where examples of tradi- 
tional architecture are to be preserved 
and in which it will grant subsidies 
to enable private owners to repair 
buildings in poor condition. Any new 
construction in these areas must har- 
monize in height and design with 
existing buildings. 
Ouro Preto (Brazil) 
Vila Rica, which changed its name 
to Ouro Preto (Black Gold) in 1823 
after the proclamation of independence 
by Brazil, was the seat of the Minas 
Gerais State Government until 1897. 
As the centre of a region immensely 
rich in gold deposits, Ouro Preto 
played a leading part in Brazilian 
history in the 18th century. Starting 
as a camping ground for the “Bandei- 
rantes” who poured into Minas Gerais 
when the gold rush began in 1698, 
it speedily became a town where 
baroque art and architecture flourished 
and on which talented artists such as 
40 
the famous 18th-century sculptor, “O 
Aleijadinho” left their mark. 
Almost entirely abandoned at the 
close of the 19th century when the 
deposits had been worked out, the 
town remained as one of Brazil's his- 
toric and artistic shrines. 
As a result of the current economic 
explosion in Brazil, Quro Preto is again 
becoming a vigorous and flourishing 
town as well as an outstanding centre 
of cultural tourism. In consequence, 
the cultural heritage which gives it its 
special charm and interest is threaten- 
ed by the wave of modernization and 
change, and a programme of adaptation 
to contemporary needs is called for. 
The Brazilian federal and regional 
authorities have realized the necessity 
of preserving for modern Brazil this 
splendid illustration of a chapter in 
the country’s short but eventful history. 
Since 1968, at their request, several 
missions of Unesco consultants and 
staff have studied ways of promoting 
the development of the town while 
preserving its unique character. 
The missions led to the drawing up 
of a master plan for safeguarding 
Ouro Preto. The plan proposes town- 
planning regulations laying down stan- 
dards for new construction in the 
town itself and on the surrounding 
hills which were threatened by a proli- 
feration of new buildings ill-suited to 
the natural and urban landscape. 
The master plan outlines solutions 
for traffic and parking problems and 
comprises a programme for renovating 
the whole urban infrastructure, inclu- 
ding the sewage and the drinking 
water systems, and the electricity and 
telephone services, as well as a plan 
for the preservation of open spaces 
and the restoration of many historic 
buildings. It also proposes the setting 
up of an organization to be responsible 
for co-ordinating and carrying out 
these programmes, 
Isfahan (Iran) 
Isfahan, whose history goes back 
more than 2,000 years, consists of 
two distinct parts: the Safavid town 
with its splendid monuments, and 
buildings dating from the pre-Safavid 
period, including one of Isfahan's 
architectural glories, the Juma Mosque. 
From the point of view of world 
culture, town-planning and tourism, this 
Iranian city-monument ranks on a par 
with Venice. As the cultural influence 
of Venice spread through the West, 
so Isfahan influenced the culture and 
art of the East. As it stands today, 
its splendid skyline virtually intact, 
Isfahan offers an enchanting spectacle. 
Yet Isfahan is in imminent danger 
on account of its rapid growth. Its 
population has doubled during the last 
ten years because of the introduction 
of industry and the inflow of immi- 
grants from the surrounding farmlands. 
Though new industrial plants may 
not be built within a radius of 50 km 
of Isfahan, their existence never- 
theless creates new needs within the 
city itself. Thus urban development on 
a large scale has become necessary 
in order to improve living conditions 
and ease the flow of goods and traffic 
in the city. This has led to the building 
of a new airport, railroad and univer- 
sity, and modifications in the layout of 
certain streets. 
Iran, like many other countries, thus 
faces a crucial problem: how to pro- 
vide for a city's modernization and eco- 
nomic growth while preserving its 
cultural heritage. In Isfahan, the Iran- 
ian government has set itself four 
objectives: to renovate and preserve, 
to modernize and expand. 
A special commission under the 
patronage of H.M. the Empress of 
ran has been formed to co-ordinate 
the work of the various government 
services responsible for carrying out 
the plan. 
Unesco has helped in the prepara- 
tion of the Isfahan project by provid- 
ing experts for planning and consul- 
tation. So far five advisory missions 
have been sent to Iran under the United 
Nations Development Programme, and 
further missions are scheduled for the 
near future, 
* 
Unesco is also, or will soon be, 
associated with national activities for 
the protection and restoration of the 
Medina of Tunis, the Casbah of Al- 
giers and the Medina of Fez (Morocco), 
for the abbey and site of the town of 
Echternach (Luxembourg) and the 
towns of Herat (Afghanistan), Lahore 
(Pakistan), San Salvador de Bahia 
(Brazil), Cuzco (Peru), Cartagena 
de Indias (Columbia) and Gondar 
(Ethiopia), as well as the palace of 
Fumban (Cameroun) and historic monu- 
ments in Senegal—at St Louis and on 
the island of Gorée. An outstanding 
example of aid given by Unesco for 
the conservation of ancient cities is 
the international campaign it launched 
in 1966 for the preservationof Venice.

An African named 
for first time 
Director-General 
of Unesco 
The first African to become Direc- 
tor-General of Unesco was elected 
by Unesco’'s General Conference on 
November 14, 1974. He is Amadou 
Mahtar M’ Bow, of Senegal (at right 
in photo above), who will serve 
for a six-year term, succeeding René 
Maheu, of France (above left), who 
was Director-General since 1962. 
Taking the oath of office, 
Mr M'Bow declared: “From now 
on | am a citizen of each of your 
countries, the servant of all the 
Member States in their totality.” 
He told delegates from Unesco’s 
135 member countries he was cer- 
tain that millions of men and women 
would consider his election “as a 
step towards eliminating the preju- 
dices which have so often and so 
tragically marked world history, and 
as proof of a desire to base Interna- 
tional co-operation on more equitable 
grounds. 
“Since each of us Is marked by 
the environment in which he was 
born and grew up”, he said, “it is 
first of ail in the spirit of the African 
people, and in their wisdom that | 
shall find guidance for my actions. 
| interpret your vote as a mark of 
consideration and esteem for the 
regions and peoples—those of the 
Third World—which have for so long 
been restricted to a marginal role 
In taking decisions and exerting 
influence at a global level.” 
Today, more than ever, said 
Mr M’'Bow, Unesco cannot afford to 
trail world events “but must reso- 
lutely take its place in the vanguard 
of the double movement of emanci- 
pation of peoples which charac- 
terizes our time."     
UNESCO'S GENERAL CONFERENCE ENDS 
HE 18th session of Unesco's General Con- 
ference, which opened on October 17, 1974, 
closed on November 23 after electing a new 
Director-Generai, Mr. Amadou Mahtar M’Bow, 
and adopting Unesco’s programme and a budget 
totalling $169,992,000 for the period 1975-1976. 
The General Conference of Unesco Is com- 
posed of the government representatives of ail 
Unesco Member States. 
During this session, which elected Mrs. Magda 
Joboru, of Hungary, President of the General 
Conference, the number of Unesco Member 
States rose from 132 to 135 with the admission 
of the People's Republic of Korea, Guinea-Bissau, 
and the Republic of San Marino. Representatives 
of fourteen African liberation movements were 
accepted as observers as well as the Palestine 
Liberation Organization. The Conference ex- 
pressed “the firm hope that Palestine will rejoin 
the community of nations within the International 
organizations including Unesco.” 
Following a debate on general policy, the 
Conference adopted a resolution which recalls 
that “hundreds of miillons of human beings, 
threatened by poverty, hunger, disease and 
Ignorance, have not yet reached the threshold of 
human dignity.” This resolution also affirms that 
“the defence and promotion of human rights 
and fundamental freedoms and the struggie 
against incitement to war, colonialism, neo-colo- 
nialism, racialism, apartheld and all other forms 
of oppression and discrimination are an essentlal 
duty for Unesco.” 
In the course of the Session, the General 
Conference voted after long debate several 
resolutions concerning israel. 
Since the Unesco General Conference of 
1968, the Organization had on repeated occasions 
issued urgent appeals to Israel to “desist from 
any alteration of the cultural and historical 
character of Jerusalem, particularly with regard 
to Christian and Islamic religlous sites”. Earlier 
this year the Unesco Executive Board at its 
94th Session (May 20 to June 28, 1974) had 
“condemned Israel's persistent violation of the 
resolutions adopted by the General Conference 
and the Executive Board in this regard”. On 
November 20, 1974, the Unesco General Confe- 
rence voted a resolution which “condemns Israel 
for Its attitude which Is contradictory to the alms 
of the Organization as stated in its constitution”. 
The resolution Invites the Director-General “to 
withhold assistance from Israel in the fieids of 
education, science and culture untif such time 
as it scrupuiously respects the aforementioned 
resolutions and decisions.” 
In addition, the General Conference voted a 
resoiution calling on Israel “to refrain from any 
act hindering the populations of the occupied 
Arab territories in the exercise of their rights 
to national education and cultural life.” 
The General Conference adopted a number of 
resolutions concerning world peace, human 
rights, equality for women and the establishment 
of a new International economic order, etc. A 
resolution concerning Chile was adopted, calling 
for the immediate cessation of violations of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms in Chile 
and requesting the Director-General to take 
measures to secure fuli respect for human 
rights in that country. 
At the close of the General Conference the 
new Director-General, Mr. Amadou Mahtar 
M'Bow, launched “an urgent appeal for tolerance 
and understanding”. “We must avoid at 
Unesco's General Conference those conflicts that 
take on the character of systematic confron- 
tations. We should perhaps even avoid the 
adoption of resolutions, even with large majori- 
ties, that couid result in deep bitterness In 
certain quarters... The golden rule for an 
organization such as Unesco should always be 
the search for a consensus through patient and 
open dialogue.” 
ISRAEL AND UNESCO 
A statement by the Secretariat of Unesco 
IN the light of misunderstandings, reflected in 
some press reports during the past few weeks, 
of resoiutions voted by the last session of the 
General Conference of Unesco that affect Israel, 
the Secretariat of Unesco wishes to underline the 
following facts: 
1) Israel has not been “excluded” from Unesco. 
Nothing in any of the resolutlons passed affects 
Israel's continulng membership in Unesco. As a 
Member State it is able to participate in all 
activities of the Organization as in the past, 
including all meetings and conferences. Israeli 
scientists, educators and cultural specialists will 
be calied upon to contribute to the Organization 
as they have done in the past, and the hope Is 
that they wiil continue to do so. 
2) Israel has not been included in the European 
Regional Group of Unesco—one of the five 
regional groupings for programme purposes 
established by the General Conference—as Israel 
had requested. However, it can participate, as 
an observer, in European or other Regional 
Conferences, as has been the case in the past. 
3) Regarding Jerusalem, the General Confer- 
ence Invited the Director-General to “withhold 
assistance from Israel in the fields of education, 
science and culture untif such time as it scru- 
pulously respects” previous General Conference 
resoiutions concerning the cessation of archaeolo- 
Unesco awarded John XXIII Peace Prize 
The John XXIJI Peace Prize has been 
awarded this year to Unesco for its work 
in promoting human rights and International 
understanding. Founded In 1963 by Pope 
John XXiil, the prize has only once pre- 
viously been awarded. The award was 
announced by the representative of the 
Holy See on November 14, 1974 during 
honouring Unesco’s outgoing 
René Maheu. On this 
occasion Unesco's General Conference 
paid a long tribute to Mr. Maheu for his 
outstanding [eadershlp and devotion which 
had enabled Unesco “to become an effec- 
tive force in the effort to promote peace 
and human rights.” 
ceremonies 
Director-General, 
gical excavations, the protection of monuments 
and the preservation of the historic character 
of the city of lerusalem. The Director-General 
intends to execute thls resolution faithfully, and 
has already so Informed the General Conference. 
At present, the consequence of this resolution is 
Interpreted to mean only the withholding of aid 
under Unesco's Participation Programme (israel 
received $24,000 in 1973/1974). 
4) Regarding possible assistance to the Pales- 
tine Liberation Organization, the Secretariat has 
received no such request, which, according to 
the pertinent resolution, should come through the 
League of Arab States. An authorization for 
aid under the Participation Programme was part 
of broader decisions to associate African 
liberation movements recognized by the Orga- 
nization of African Unity, as well as the Palestine 
Liberation Organization, recognized by the League 
of Arab States, with the activities of the 
Organization. Assistance has already been 
provided by Unesco to African liberation move- 
ments In the field of education. 
5) Finally, an additlonal resolutlon of the 
General Conference invited the Director-General 
to “exercise full supervision of the operation of 
educational and cultural Institutions In the 
occupled territories and to co-operate with the 
Arab ‘States concerned and the Palestine 
Liberation Organization with a view to providing 
the populations in the occupled territorles with 
every means of enjoying their rights to education 
and culture”. The Director-General is studying 
the means of carrying out this resolution. The 
General Conference has been advised that a 
good deal of Information wili have to be gathered 
and consultations Inltiated before certain practical 
problems of Implementation can be presented 
to Unesco’s Executive Board for advice.

AL-BIRUNI 
‘LIKE FINDING A TREASURE’ 
Sir, 
My mother, Elise Gillette, is an ardent 
“Courier” fan, She writes of the num- 
ber on al-Biruni (June 1974): “I'd never 
even heard of him. The section on 
philosophy stumped me, but the rest 
was like finding a treasure.” 
A. Gillette 
Paris, France 
Sir, 
| found your special issue devoted to 
al-Biruni a mountain of boredom. What 
the world owes to this scholar could 
surely have been summed up in a single 
article. 
Bernard Hermel 
Fontenay-le-Fleury, France 
Sir, 
| enjoyed your issue on al-Biruni, 
since one has too few opportunities for 
learning about the great figures of Asian 
culture. 
By acting as a link between the 
world's cultures, the “Unesco Courier” 
fulfils an important Unesco ideal. Con- 
gratulations on the whole issue—on 
the translations of al-Biruni's writings, 
the high-quality presentation of the 
texts, and the photos, which not only 
illustrate the contents of the articles but 
communicate thoughts and ideas which 
cannot be expressed in words.

POP OR NO POP? 
Sir, 
Your query to readers, “Want an 
issue on pop music?®, produced a fasci- 
nating crop of replies for your letters 
page (April 1974 issue) with some 
revealing attitudes for and against pop 
music. 
A continuing controversy indeed calls 
for an assessment to be made, but | 
fear that this kind of “prophecy” is 
beyond the scope of the “Unesco Cou- 
rier". It might be more reasonable to 
let passions abate before trying to 
reach an unbiased judgement, 
The “Unesco Courier” has been de- 
voting much space to music and paying 
little attention to drama, the theatre, 
the variety show, pantomime and .the 
circus, an art as ancient as the hills yet 
always young. | would like to see the 
circus and the theatre given place on 
your pages. 
Alexander Stepanov 
student 
Moscow, U.S.S.R. 
Sir, 
Unlike opponents of pop music, | 
would welcome an issue with a com- 
prehensive analysis of this trend in 
music. Is it something entirely new 
in meiody, harmony and other modes of 
musical expression? Or is it not as 
original and revolutionary as its admi- 
rers, who don't seem hard to please, 
would have us believe? 
The views of pop music devotees are 
hardly convincing. Is pop music only 
attractive because of its “violence and 
despair and its planetary use of instru- 
Letters to the Editor  
ments from every continent”? No one 
could object to a wide use of various 
national musical instruments, but | be- 
lieve that most people today would 
find it hard to agree with the idea that 
the future belongs to those whose 
hearts are filled with “violence and 
despair”.

EIGHT CENTURIES 
OF WALDENSIAN HISTORY 
 
Sir, 
This year has seen the commemo- 
ration of the eighth centenary of Wal- 
densian beliefs and teaching. The 
Waldenses suffered persecution during 
seven centuries. Theirs was not only 
a philosophical and religious movement, 
but also offered an early example of 
social emancipation in that women took 
an active part in the life of Waldensian 
communities. 
Equally extraordinary for the Middle 
Ages is the fact that most Waldenses 
learned to read and write. It was they 
who in 15632 commissioned and publish- 
ed the first Bible printed in French, 
known as the Neuchatel Bible, and later 
the Lyons Bible. To pay for its publi- 
cation, Waldensian peasant communi- 
ties between them collected 1,500 gold 
écus. Such a unique enterprise is 
perhaps worth recalling. 
i. Groffier 
Amicale du Luberon 
Apt, France 
Editor's Note : Jean Groffier is the 
author of a book on the history and 
philosophy of the Waldensian movement, 
which was founded in 12th-century 
France, entitled “Qui sont les Vaudois?”

MEAT-EATING SUPERSTITION 
Sir, 
In his article, “ Can the Earth feed 
the Growing Multitudes 7? " (July-August 
1974 issue) Roger Revelle states that 
a large fraction of available agricultural 
land is needed to produce food for 
livestock. 
This is surely a complete superstition, 
since livestock are not necessary for 
the human diet or survival, and in fact 
their breeding could be steadily 
reduced, and the freed land used for 
the production of protein foods for 
human consumption. 
There is already a large literature on 
this subject, to which 1 hope you will 
give full publicity in future issues.

unfortunately, is not. 
IN COPERNICUS’ FOOTSTEPS 
Sir, 
| was so fascinated by the number 
of the “Unesco Courier” entitled “Co- 
pernicus, a new vision of the universe” 
(April 1973), that | have decided to

modern astronomy, Galileo, Tycho 
Brahe, Kepler and Newton.

RUSSIA'S FIRST 
PRINTED TEXT-BOOK 
Sir, 
This year, 1974, the Soviet public is 
celebrating the 400th anniversary of the 
first Russian printed text-book. The 
text-book was compiled and printed by 
Ivan Fyodorov, some time before Feb- 
ruary 1574, in Lvov, a major cultural 
centre in Western Ukraine, then part of 
Poland. 
The text-book is based on material 
of Moscow origin but also contains the 
Serbian version of a Bulgarian book. 
It was used not only by Russians, 
Ukrainians and Byelorussians but also 
by southern Slavs. Thus we might say 
that Russia's first printed text-book sym- 
boiizes the cultural collaboration among 
the six Slavonic peoples.

NEW VISTAS 
IN SPECIAL EDUCATION 
Sir, 
My warmest congratulations on your 
March 1974 issue on the Handicapped. 
Your title, “New Vistas in Special 
Education” for my article published in 
the issue, could not have been bettered. 
It was a happy co-incidence that this 
number appeared when it did, for the 
World Confederation of Organizations 
of the Teaching Profession held its 
annual conference in Dublin, in April, 
and the theme was education for pupils 
with special needs. The "Unesco Cou- 
rier" was available In the English and 
French editions and the whole magazine 
was the source of many favourable 
comments from the participants at this 
international conference. 
The issue also makes excellent back- 
ground reading for the paper | am 
delivering at a conference on the train- 
ing of personnel for the multiply handi- 
capped, being held this year in Sao 
Paulo, Brazil.

POWER FROM THE SUN 
Sir, 
Congratulations on your issue “Power 
from the Sun" (January 1974). To my 
mind this is the ideal kind of subject 
for the “Unesco Courier”. It is topical, 
it has great economic (and therefore 
human) interest, and it could greatly 
help to improve conditions of life in 
still developing countries (not forgetting 
more fortunate countries).
