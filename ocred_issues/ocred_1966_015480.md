Modern techniques have brought high-quality colour prints of masterpieces, such as this portrait of an Algerian girl by 
Amedeo Modigliani, within the reach of a wide public. Modigliani, an Italian painter who worked in Paris, 
failed to achieve fame during his short life (1884-1920). But today his portraits and figure studies are classed 
among the most prized works of museums and private collections.

All parents—Ilike this Liberian 
mother and child—want their 
children to grow up under the 
most favourable conditions of 
health and security in order 
to enjoy a rich and fruitful 
life. But every year the 
world's population is growing 
by 60 million persons. Whe- 
ther or not this is really a 
threat is examined in this 
issue along with some of the 
possible consequences of the 
population expansion today 
and in the foreseeable future.

### 78361: Our shrinking planet

OUR 
SHRINKING 
PLANET 
| ODAY, there are 60 million more people in our 
world than there were only a year ago. 
If this trend continues the world’s population will surpass 
the 7,000 million mark within a generation, by the year 2000 
—more than doubling the number of people alive today— 
and doubling also mankind's needs for food and shelter, 
fuel and clothing, and all the other things that go into the 
making of a decent human life. 
During the month of September last year, more than 
800 men and women from almost 80 countries met in 
Belgrade, Yugoslavia to attend the Second World Population 
Conference sponsored by the United Nations. They came, 
not as representatives of their governments but in their 
individual capacity as specially qualified doctors and statis- 
ticians, economists and lawyers—but most of all as demo- 
graphers, experts in population questions. 
Their theme: the world’s population, and its unprecedented 
growth in recent years. They adopted no recommendations 
and took no decisions. Rather, they confined themselves 
to a thorough debate and exchange of views, aware that 
no country in the world would want to have a population 
policy dictated to it from outside. 
But even without decisions it was a most important meet- 
ing—by virtue of the fact that it conclusively showed the 
existence of a world-wide awareness of the population 
problem, of world-wide concern with it. And this in itself 
is something relatively new. 
As put by one participant, Dr. Bakari Kamian, an educa- 
tionist from the Republic of Mali: “At present the develop- 
ment of the growth of the world population.is such that 
it poses very important problems. |f this growth continues, 
it will pose problems of such gravity as to affect the very 
fate of mankind, even raising the question of man's survival.” 
From Asia came this view from Anup Dutta Sharma, an 
economist from India: “This rapid growth of world popula- 
tion and its growing imbalances in the different regions 
is the cause of human anxiety and sufferings, and this 
may cause political and social conflicts.” 
An economist from Chile, Dr. Julio Morales, highlighted 
the problem as it affects Latin America in these words: “In 
its history, Latin America has never experienced a demo- 
graphic growth as high as the one now in existence. In 
fact, it is not only the highest in Latin American history; 
at the same time it is the highest in the world.” 
ERIK N. VALTERS is a staff member of the United Nations. 
This article is an adaptation of two U.N. radio programmes written 
by Mr. Valters for the series “Perspective Sixty-Five™ on the basis 
of interviews and statements recorded for U.N. Television and 
U.N. Radio at the time of the Second World Population Conference 
in Belgrade last September. 
by Eric N. Valters 
From the Soviet Union, a Moscow demographer, Dimitri 
Valentey, expressed a different point of view: “We con- 
sider that there is no basis for pessimism,” he said. “We 
consider that the human mind can ensure that the growing 
world population will have the energy, mineral, and water 
resources and all the other things which it will need.” 
In the keynote address to the Conference, delivered by 
Dr. B. R. Sen, Director-General of the U.N. Food and Agri- 
culture Organization there was, however, a marked element 
of concern—indeed alarm—about the eventual results of 
the rapid growth of the world population. 
“It is a simple arithmetical calculation,” said Dr. Sen, "that 
if food output everywhere just kept pace with population 
growth at the present level of consumption, by the end 
of this century the number of people who would be subject 
to hunger and malnutrition would be double what it is 
today.” (See text page 10). 
1 N addition to food, there is also the growing 
need for housing, clothing, fuel, education. Can 
the world provide all these to an expanding population? On 
this crucial question, these were differences of opinion, 
strongly held, among the participants in the world Population 
Conference. 
Professor Alfred Sauvy of France, one of the world's fore- 
most demographers, described this disagreement during a 
U.N. television interview in these terms: “We do not agree 
for various reasons, because, after all, in the heart of 
every scientist there exists a sentiment which more or 
less dominates his mind more or less consciously. In parti- 
cular, there are optimists and pessimists. There are those 
who believe in future progress—progress which has not 
yet been achieved but which should be there at the 
appointed time. And there are those who, like Doubting 
Thomas, only believe what they see and what they touch, 
and who say that which they see and which they touch 
does not suffice to provide 3,000 million human beings with 
the 2,500 calories a day and with the many other things 
which they need.” 
This kind of disagreement, of shall we say, difference in 
emphasis, found among experts, is exemplified by the two 
following points of view. The first by Professor Philip 
M. Hauser, of the University of Chicago: “If you assume 
that all of the world's resources, present total product, all 
goods and services produced, were available, and then 
ask how many people could the world support at the 
European level of living, the answer is: about 1,500 million, 
and we already have a population of 3,200 million. 
“If you ask what can the total world product support 
at the North American level of living, the level of living

in Canada and in the United States, the answer is: only 
500 million, and we have 3,200 million.” 
“Now, if everybody on this earth lived at the level of 
living, let us say, of South-East Asia, then we can stand 
many more people than the earth already has. So there 
is no one answer to this question. But this is clear: with 
present rates of growth and with the present population 
of the globe, it is going to be extraordinarily difficult to 
raise levels of living in the developing areas very much 
during the remainder of this century, unless rates of popu- 
lation growth are decreased.” 
Dimitri Valentey, Chairman of the Council of Population 
Problems of the U.S.S.R. Ministry of High and Secondary 
Specialized Education, in Moscow, has summed up the 
second view in the following words: “Potential geological 
world resources of oil are estimated at 250-300 thousand 
million tons or more. Potential geological resources of 
natural gas exceed 200 billion cubic metres. Nor must we 
forget atomic energy which increasingly takes its place in 
the world's energy balance. Finally, there are the sources 
of energy which we call ‘exotic’. | mean the forces of the 
wind .and of the sea tides, the temperature difference at 
various depths in the oceans, and lastly, the energy of 
the sun. Energy is life, and we have enough energy on 
earth and in our universe to provide human life with every- 
thing necessary 100, 200 or 1,000 years hence.” 
The highest birth rates obtain in the world's developing 
regions: rates averaging 3 per cent per year, as compared 
to 1.3 per cent in the already industrialized countries. And 
so the question naturally arises (and was also discussed in 
Belgrade): can these developing nations which are despe- 
rately trying to improve their living standards attain this 
goal while maintaining their current high birth rate? 
The answer to this question is by no means obvious, 
because experts today agree that there was and there is 
no constant and significant direct effect of population 
increase on the rate of rise of per capita production. 
As put in Belgrade by Professor Simon Kuznets of 
Harvard University in the United States: “In some countries, 
high rates of population increase were accompanied by 
high rates of growth in per capita product. In others, 
low rates of population growth were associated with low 
rates of growth in per capita product. In still others, low 
rates of population increase were combined with high 
rates of growth in per capita product. This diversity of 
relations is found in countries within both the developed 
and the developing regions.” 
On the other hand, it must also be said (it was in 
fact said by Professor Kuznets) that a rate of population 
increase which is high in absolute terms, such as that in 
many developing countries, might well be a problem. 
This was confirmed in Belgrade by numerous participants 
from the developing countries. 
For example, from Mali, with an annual population 
increase of 3% per cent, Balari Kamian, Director General 
of the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Bamako, declared: 
“We have to build many more schools, build many more 
hospitals and sanitary installations to take care of the 
human beings who come into this world. We must also 
provide for future investments to be able to employ these 
young people once they have reached the working age. 
And we must provide for other investments to open up 
new opportunities and, above all, to solve the problem 
of additional supplies that will be needed.” 
Professor Sohandal Nagda of Bhopal in India, spoke about 
his country's population growth rate and its effect on India’s 
economic development: “The growth rate currently is placed 
at the figure of 2.5 per cent per annum by some. This 
growth rate as a rate is high, without doubt; applied to

India's 475 million people at the moment, it presents a 
colossal problem and a great obstacle to India's effort to 
improve its lot. In fact, India is adding to its numbers 
11 million persons every year. Any increases in the 
national output have to be put side by side with the needs 
of increasing numbers.” 
India’s Deputy Minister of Health, Mrs. Soundram T.S. Ra- 
machandran, who also attended the Conference, had this to 
say on the subject: “We are developing fast as far as in- 
dustries, irrigation, and so many other conveniences are 
concerned. There is a planned programme. But there are 
11 million children born every year. Just these figures 
upset that planning. Therefore family planning has become 
a national programme, so that planning the family and plan- 
ning for the nation can go hand in hand and show good 
results.” 
Birth control or family planning is a very touchy and 
sensitive issue in many parts of the world—both advocated 
and rejected on the basis of convictions which are deeply 
held. 
Addressing the opening meeting of the Second World 
Population Conference, Philippe de Seynes, United Nations 
Under-Secretary for Economic and Social Affairs, emphasiz- 
ed that the United Nations itself was neutral on the 
subject of birth control—out of respect for all beliefs and 
in view of the present state of our knowledge. But he said: 
“We cannot fail to mention the fact that some govern- 
ments, representing a considerable proportion of the world's 
population, are now engaged, by means of birth control 
methods, in trying to curb a population growth which has 
acquired an alarming momentum, 
“They have reached the conclusion, in some cases after 
much hesitation and heart-searching, that at the present 
rate of their population growth, too great a part of their 
total product is inevitably channelled toward the needs of 
the most elementary consumption, and that capital formation 
is dangerously slowed down; in some instances, the prob- 
lem is even seen in terms of sheer survival.” And the UN 
Under-Secretary added: “We are ready to respond to 
all requests for assistance from any country which, on 
the basis of its own assessment of the situation, has 
decided to embark on such a policy or to explore its 
possibilities.” 
According to a statement made at the World Population 
Conference, more than half of the people in the developing 
regions today live in countries that have established 
national policies favouring the limitation of births. Almost 
invariably, the reason given for such a policy is the desire 
to promote economic and social development without hav- 
ing to devote a disproportionate share of the increase in 
the national product to the needs of an overrapidly in- 
creasing population. 
However, some participants said: “Do more for economic 
and social development, and the birth rate will decline by 
itself, without any artificial measures.” 
This view was expressed, among others, by T.V. Ryabush- 
kin, Deputy Director of the Institute of the Economics of the 
World Socialist System, Moscow, U.S.S.R.: “We consider 
that social and economic conditions are the decisive factor 
for the demographic process. We hold the view that the 
birth rate declines when industrialization takes place, when 
women are involved in the process of social production, and 
when the cultural standard of the people rises. That is 
why there is no necessity of taking some special measures 
which could artificially decrease the birth rate further.” 
Artificial birth control has further been opposed on reli- 
gious grounds—for instance, by the Roman Catholic Church. 
In Belgrade, the Holy See observer, Father Henri de Ried- 
matten, urged greater respect for human life and more 
faith in man’s future: “The population problem is a prob-

Changing views on family planning 
lem of life, and therefore it is linked up with realities which 
are essentially dynamic realities. It is from this point 
of view that we approach this World Population Conference 
with the wish that, in spite of the fears which certain 
countries show with regard to the population phenomena 
(which are disquieting but which must be interpreted in 
a doubtful fashion), one should not lose sight of the fact 
that it is essential in a problem of this kind to proceed, 
despite everything, with faith in life, with faith in the 
inventive and productive possibilities of the human genius, 
and avoiding the risk of leading humanity into other adven- 
tures in order to escape from dangers which today appear 
imminent.” 
Not all religions have a negative attitude towards birth 
control and family planning. A Moslem point of view was 
expressed by Abdel Moneim El Shafsi, Director of the 
North African Demographic Centre in Cairo, in the United 
Arab Republic. 
“Islam does not prohibit any person from planning his 
family,” Dr. El Shafsi told a U.N. radio reporter. “We will 
find that family planning was practised more than a thou- 
sand years ago, even in the days of the Prophet, and 
the contemporaries of the Prophet have mentioned the 
fact, and he did not prohibit it. And one of the greatest 
theologians of Islam, about 800 years ago, went into the 
matter very deeply and scientifically, and found it justi- 
fiable for anybody to plan his family, and even specified 
the best method to be practised.” 
Have national policies favouring the limitation of births 
had any effect on the birth rates? The answer is: they are 
beginning to have—in some places. At the Conference in 
Belgrade, we talked to the moderator of a meeting on 
fertility, Professor Ronald Freedman of the University of 
Michigan, in the United States. He told us: “We are, | 
think, going to see, perhaps by the end of 1965, certainly 
within the next three or four years, for the first timg 
in the history of the world, an acceleration of birth-rate 
decline as a result of a large organized programme in 
LEADING SOVIET DEMOGRAPHER 
ON FAMILY PLANNING 
In the European and North American countries the 
lowering of the mortality rate has been accompanied 
by a lowering of the birth rate. It seems clear that 
in a number of developing countries, too, the problem 
of reducing the birth rate must find a place alongside 
industrialization, social reform and cultural growth if 
a sound basis for economic progress is to be assured. 
In some of these countries the birth rate will be 
reduced as a result of women participating in pro- 
duction, a higher level of culture and the development 
of industry and urban life. In others, however, a 
definite demographic policy to reduce the birth rate 
must be considered essential. The example of Japan, 
where the birth rate has been halved, is instructive, 
The spread of the idea of family planning makes 
for a richer spiritual life for the woman and at the same 
time helps keep population growth at the optimum 
level. Demographers in each country must determine 
the rate of population growth that is economically 
ideal and must ensure that such rates are maintained. 
Boris Urlanis 
In a special statement to the Unesco Courier     
four particular populations Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and 
Hong Kong; | think we are going to have that develop- 
ment In those four places. Now, these are small places, 
they don't constitute a very large part of the population of 
the world. Nevertheless, it is a historic event that this 
should happen, and it points the way to what may happen 
in the other countries.” 
Another example may be India. This is what we were 
told by Mrs. S.T.S. Ramachandran, doctor of medicine and 
India's Deputy Minister of Health: “In India also, a declin- 
ing birth rate is being indicated, especially in Bombay. 
It has come to 27 births per thousand, which is comparable 
to any developed nations. And in the rural areas also, 
where we are working intensively, within four years we 
have shown a decline in birth rate from 45 to 36.” 
"When we heard that in some of the developing coun- 
tries they are showing very good results, we were happy 
to tell them, even though we have not achieved such

results as a nation wide programme because of India's 
vast country and vast millions; but still we are making 
good progress in those areas where people are more 
conscious of the problem. And this is sure to catch up, 
so that we can achieve much in the next five years.” 
Mrs. Ramachandran told us that India's family planning 
programme emphasizes two methods of birth control: an 
inter-uterine contraceptive device for women, and sterili- 
zation for men. She went on: “The family planning 
programme is very well received in the cities, but it is 
equally well received in the rural areas also. You see, 
there are various factors which promote family planning 
in our country: the desire to have a better life; to have a 
better education; and also consciousness to have a smaller 
family, so that parents can give all the opportunities to 
their children.” 
The delegates to the World Population Conference in 
Belgrade tended to agree that, in general, the African 
continent was under-populated and not over-populated, and 
that some countries were suffering from manpower short- 
ages rather than from population surpluses. 
In Latin America, however, the situation is different. 
Though there are no national family planning programmes, 
there do already exist in some Latin American countries 
small experimental projects, designed to study the prob- 
lem of controlling the birth rate. 
As a Mexican economist and demographer, Victor L. 
Urquidi, pointed out: “Surveys carried out in Latin Ameri- 
ca reveal that there is a demand for information on family 
planning. The governments are not yet executing policies 
in this area and it will be necessary to pass through a long 
period of study, of preparation, but there is no doubt that 
there is already a consciousness of the fact that in addi- 
tion to whatever is done to stimulate economic develop- 
ment, there is need to convince the people that it is neces- 
sary in some way to limit the family, without, of course, 
prejudicing the stability of the home or creating artificial 
problems.” 
In conclusion, we should like to stress once again that 
the recent World Population Conference took no decisions 
-—either on birth control or, for that matter, on any other 
aspect of the population problem. Rather, the conference 
was planned as a forum for debate, for the exchange 
of views, for throwing some light on one of the great 
problems of our time—while always reserving the question 
of action, if any, to the exclusive competence of national 
governments. 
In the decade ahead more than 600 million will be added to the world’s population—more 
than twice as many people as are believed to have existed on earth at the start of the Christian era. 
Today, the population of India (below) grows by ten million every year.

TO BE 
OR NOT TO BE 
that will be the question 
N ATIONS are increasingly aware of the implica- 
tions of an unprecedented rate of population 
growth for the future well-being of mankind. 
The first World Population Conference which was held 
in Rome over ten years ago concerned itself mainly with 
the promotion of genetic research and the collection and 
co-ordination of demographic statistics, and made a valu- 
able contribution to the international understanding of 
population problems. 
During the decade that has elapsed since then, the study 
of population growth has assumed critical importance as 
a major factor in determining the pace of economic and 
social progress in the developing countries. Nevertheless, 
it has to be admitted that while the consequences of the 
continuation of the current situation have not escaped the 
attention of individual scientists, historians and sociologists, 
interpational organizations, including the United Nations, 
had to observe great caution in discussing matters of popu- 
lation policy, especially those relating to population stabi- 
lization, in order to avoid hurting the susceptibilities of 
member nations. The 1965 Conference therefore initiates 
a welcome departure from the approach that has so far 
marked the consideration of population problems under the 
auspices of the United Nations, 
It would, | believe, be correct to say that among the 
international intergovernmental organizations which have 
consciously and progressively approached the subject with 
an open mind and have tried to set the problem of popula- 
tion growth in a proper and realistic perspective in terms 
of their goals is FAQ, the Food and Agriculture Organization 
of the United Nations. 
FAO's primary tasks, as laid down in its Constitution, are 
to assist member nations to raise the nutritional levels of 
their peoples through improved production and distribution 
of food, to raise the living standards of rural populations 
and to contribute to an expanding world trade in agricultural 
products. In carrying out all these tasks the question of 
population growth comes inescapably into play as a basic 
factor. 
by Binay Ranjan Sen 
Director-General, FAO 
The first opportunity we had to have the problem pre- 
sented authoritatively to our member governments was in 
1959 when Professor Arnold Toynbee, the eminent historian, 
delivered the first McDougall Memorial Lecture at the 10th 
Session of the FAO Conference (see page 12). Professor 
Toynbee's address made an immediate impact, but it was 
clear from the reactions of the delegates present that world 
public opinion was not yet ready to face the issue and 
discuss the implications. 
Two years later, at the next FAO biennial conference 
in 1961, we invited Mr. John D. Rockefeller Ill who devoted 
most of his McDougall Memorial Lecture to the theme of 
population and food supplies. He said: "The grim fact of 
population growth cuts across all the basic needs of 
mankind and, more than any other single factor, frustrates 
man's achievement of his higher needs.” From the reac- 
tions to Mr. Rockefeller's address it appeared that the 
subject was no longer anathema and that there was a 
possibility for this problem to be discussed more freely 
than before. 
At the Economic and Social Council in 1957, and again 
in 1958, | had raised the problem of hunger and want as a 
reflection of underproductivity and pleaded for concerted 
action by the United Nations family. In November 1959, the 
FAO conference approved my proposal to launch the Free- 
dom from Hunger Campaign in order to create a world-wide 
awareness of the perilous dimensions of hunger and malnu- 
trition and of the urgency of taking timely action to avert a 
deepening crisis. The wide support that the Campaign 
received from its very inception was a proof of the growing 
anxiety concerning the problem and the impetus it gave 
has been growing ever since. 
The year 1962 was marked by the historic pronounce- 
ments of Pope John XXIl. In his Encyclical "Pacem In 
Terris” Pope John dwelt at some length on man’s rights 
and duties in a changing world. The great good man did 
not live to see how profoundly he had stirred the cons- 
cience and thinking of mankind, nor to follow up the implica- 
tions of the great Encyclical.

### 16116: To be or not to be: that will be the question

The general world 
outlook is 
indeed alarming. 
In some of 
the most heavily 
populated areas 
the outbreak 
of serious famines 
within the next 
five to ten 
years cannot 
be excluded. 
And it is a simple 
arithmetical 
calculation that 
if food output 
everywhere just 
kept pace 
with population 
growth, by the end 
of this century 
the number of people 
who would 
be subject to hunger 
and malnutrition 
would be 
double what 
it is today.’ 
The Encyclical states that any human society, if it is to be 
well-ordered and productive, must lay down as a foundation 
the principle that every human being is a person; meaning 
that his nature is endowed with intelligence and free will, 
and that, by virtue of this, he has “rights and duties of his 
own, flowing direct and simultaneously from his very nature, 
which are therefore universal, inviolable. and inalienable.” 
The first of these “universal, inviolable, and inalienable 
rights” is defined as “the right to life and a worthy standard 
of living", comprising “the right to the means which are 
necessary and suitable for the proper development of life”, 
including primarily food and other necessary goods and 
services. 
The first of the “universal, inviolable, and inalienable 
rights” is a dual right, not merely the right to life but also 
the right to a worthy standard of living. The text of the 
Encyclical does not itself comment on the implications of 
the stipulation of this dual right, affecting, as it does, the 
issue of the rapid rate of world population growth. 
The problem before mankind is that whatever practical 
new measures, may be taken nationally and internationally, 
now or in the near future, aiming at the accelerating expan- 
sion of productive capacity for the provision of food and 
other means of livelihood, a continuation of the present 
trends of population growth may well lead to a situation 
when “the right to life" of those not yet living, that is of 
larger and larger numbers of future generations, will no 
longer be a right parallel to, but will be in conflict with, 
“the right to a worthy standard of living.” 
In 1962 FAQ launched a number of basic studies relating 
to its major fields of work in preparation for the World 
Food Congress which was held in 1963. One of these 
studies, “The Third World Food Survey,” clearly showed 
that 10 to 15 per cent of the world population are under- 
nourished, and up to half suffer from hunger or malnutrition 
or both. This survey also furnished food supply targets, 
both short-term and long-term, taking into consideration 
population projections and the need to eliminate under-

THE QUESTION (Cont'd) 
nutrition and provide a modest improvement in the nutri- 
tional quality of the diet. 
To reach the short-term target by 1975 it would be 
necessary, according to this survey, to obtain an annual 
growth rate of 4 per cent in food supplies in the developing 
countries. This increased rate of food supplies has not 
been reached so far in the developing regions; in fact, the 
average annual rate of increase in food supplies during the 
last five years has not exceeded 2.5 per cent. 
It is against these developments that at the 38th Inter- 
national Eucharistic Congress held in Bombay in 1964, as 
head of one of the members of the United Nations family, 
for the first time | spoke candidly on the urgent need to 
face the question of population stabilization. | said: 
“The important factor to watch is that the development 
of available resources and the production of goods and 
services keep pace with population growth. Where there 
is maladjustment between the two, famine, pestilence, wars 
have in the past intervened to restore the balance. Can 
mankind reconcile itself to this kind of remedy in this age 
of science which has opened up almost unlimited possibili- 
ties for satisfying basic human needs? Can we any more 
turn our faces away from the concept of family planning 
when the alternative is starvation and death?” 
In May 1965, a resolution of the World Health Organiza- 
tion authorized WHO “to provide, on request, technical 
advice on birth control methods to its member govern- 
ments”; this is another important step forward. 
Early in 1965 in New York | addressed the United Nations 
Population Commission, and said that the prospect seemed 
dark indeed unless there was a combined world-wide effort 
to raise agricultural productivity in the developing countries 
along with determined measures to control population 
growth. 
The majority of the Commission felt that the social and 
economic development of the developing countries would 
be considerably accelerated by population stabilization 
measures and were definitely in favour of public action. 
Some members, however, expressed the opinion that the 
difficulties inherent in the rapid population growth could 
be overcome by vigorous dnd well-planned measures to 
promote economic development and not by attempting the 
promotion of family planning. They would rely heavily on 
the social and cultural checks resulting from industrialization 
and urban development. 
But what is the real issue? Is it what might be the ideal 
solution in the long run, or is it whether in the cir- 
cumstances of the developing countries today, the growth 
rate in agricultural productivity can be increased fast 
enough to meet the essential food needs of the immediate 
future? 
lt is now less than seven years since there was any 
appreciable increase in food production per head of the 
world’s population, seven very lean years for the developing 
countries. In two regions in particular, the Far East and 
Latin America, per capita production is still less than it was 
before the last war, more than a quarter of a century ago. 
Many countries in these regions have been able to main- 
tain their wholly inadequate dietary levels only by reducing 
exports, or by increasing imports of food, including in some 
cases a very heavy dependence on food aid. 
Where this increased demand is not matched by a 
corresponding increase in supplies, food prices increase 
rapidly. This has a particularly serious inflationary effect, 
for in developing countries food represents much the lar- 
gest part of total consumer expenditures. Such has been 
the case in India, where rising food prices are causing 
great hardship to consumers. 
The general world outlook is indeed, if 1 may say so, 
alarming. In some of the most heavily populated areas the

Nature: that is to say, it has been breeding up 
to the maximum. To let Nature take her extra- 
vagant course in the reproduction of the human 
race may have made sense in an age in which 
we were also letting her take her course in deci- 
mating mankind by the casualties of war, pesti- 
lence, and famine. Being human, we have at 
last revolted against that senseless waste. We 
have started to impose on Nature's heartless play 
a humane new order of our own. But, when 
once man has begun to interfere with Nature, 
he cannot afford to stop half way. We cannot, 
with impunity, cut down the death-rate and at 
the same time allow the birth-rate to go on tak- 
ing Nature's course. We must consciously try 
to establish an equilibrium or, sooner or later, 
famine will stalk abroad again. And here we 
come back to the heart of our problem. The 
death-rate can be reduced by public action taken 
by the few; the birth-rate can be reduced or 
stabilized only by private action taken by the

the world’s maximum food supply? Or is it to

seem irrational. What matters, surely, is not that 
the surface of this planet should hold, say, four

living beings, whatever their number, shall

THE QUESTION (Cont'd) @ P. Almasy, Paris 
A simple arithmetical calculation 
outbreak of serious famines within the next five to ten 
years cannot be excluded. And it is a simple arithmetical 
calculation that if food output everywhere just kept pace 
with population growth at the present level of consumption, 
by the end of this century the number of people who would 
be subject to hunger and malnutrition would be double what 
it is today. 
The situation clearly requires specific production targets 
on the basis of realistic figures of population growth; and 
this again means working for a much higher rate of agri- 
cultural productivity in the developing countries rather than 
attempting, at least in the foreseeable future, any significant 
extension of cultivable land. 
We have calculated that a sustained increase of 4 per 
cent per annum in food production, as against the present 
average of 2 1/2 per cent in population increase, over the 
next 15 years, would be necessary to avoid any serious 
breakdown of the current precarious balance between 
population and food supplies. The question is, can this 
rate be achieved by the developing countries? 
There can be no doubt that in most of the developing 
countries it should be possible to increase crop yields 
per acre significantly by judicious investment of resources 
in land improvement, application of fertilizers, use of more 
efficient tools and machinery, improved crop varieties and 
seeds, and in plant disease control. To start with, they 
will have the advantage of underdevelopment itself as a 
factor favouring a rapid rate of growth. 
It is true that our knowledge of the basic factors for 
improving tropical agriculture is still very inadequate. 
But we know that there is enough scientific and technical 
knowledge available from temperate zone research for 
revolutionizing backward agricultural practices in most 
parts of the world; in the initial stages all that is necessary 
is to adapt this knowledge to local conditions. 
The greatest impediments to progress however, lie in 
social and institutional factors. The farmer, who for the 
past centuries has remained static, largely due to lack of 
incentives and to general neglect, must now be assisted 
to step into the market economy with the hope of a better 
return for his labour. He must be given price and other 
incentives and also, what is equally important, adequate 
marketing facilities for his produce. 
Special attention will have to be given to provide basic 
education to the farmer to make him more receptive to 
new ideas. He must be given proprietary rights in his land 
so that he feels that he can improve his conditions by the 
fruits of his own labour. 
All this will also need massive investment for which the 
domestic savings of these countries will be inadequate. 
We calculate that to enable the developing countries to 
achieve a rate of growth of 5 per cent per annum in 
national income, the amount of foreign capital inflow by 
1975 should reach about 50 billion dollars a year (at 
1960 prices), as against the current, almost stagnant, rate 
of about 7.5 billion dollars. Much will also depend on the 
expansion of export markets for the products of developing 
countries, since the bulk of foreign exchange receipts of 
these countries—at present about 75 per cent—are provided 
by commodity exports. 
Having in view the urgency of stepping up agricultural 
production and productivity, FAO is now working on an 
“Indicative World Plan for Agricultural Development”. The 
Plan is designed to provide an international frame of ref- 
erence for our member nations in their national planning and 
one within which donors and recipients can see more

clearly the priorities in respect of agricultural development 
in developing countries. 
As we know development policies are determined and 
implemented by national governments, acting either unila- 
terally or in concert with other governments in regional or 
other groupings, or as members of world bodies which 
influence international policies. 
The Indicative World Plan will not imply any departure 
from this fundamental principle of national and international 
action for development. It will exert an influence to the 
extent that its analyses and recommendations enjoy the 
confidence of governments and of the bilateral and multi- 
lateral agencies dispensing aid. The success of the plan 
will of course depend on the co-operation and participation 
of all concerned in its formulation and application. 
What then is the answer to the question | have posed? 
Taking all relevant factors into account, can we expect the 
growth rate in agricultural productivity in developing 
countries to keep pace with the population growing at the 
present rate? 
If we go by the experience of some countries who have 
gone through this process of development, the prospect is 
by no means reassuring. It took Japan more than 40 years, 
beginning from the third quarter of the last century, to 
double her agricultural production—the average annual rate 
of increase did not exceed 2 per cent. The population 
growth in Japan during this period was below one per cent 
per annum. There was also a parallel growth of industriali- 
zation which relieved land of the population pressure. 
The experience of the Soviet Union, which started with the 
advantage of vast unused and under-used physical resour- 
ces, has not been any better. 
| can therefore only repeat what | said to the U.N. Popu- 
lation Commission: “One is left wondering whether the 
1 [ . An 
Smiles and expert care for newly-born children in a European maternity hospital. 
Progress in medicine and hygiene 
has reduced infant mortality in more than 60 per cent 
of the countries of the world since 1960. 
large increases can in fact be achieved over a decade 
or so. Doubts arise because the necessary effort to reach 
the targets may not be made. The financial resources 
required may not be forthcoming. A sustained effort to 
expand production may be lost in a feeling of despair.” 
The question of population stabilization must therefore 
be viewed against this background. The demographers will 
tell us that for the next 20 or 25 years the current pattern 
of short-run growth in population is likely to continue more 
or less unchanged. Despite all these so-called food 
“surpluses” that we can possibly muster, the hard possibi- 
lities are that we may not be able to forestall and avoid 
some large-scale breakdowns in the next few decades, at 
least in some parts of the world. The greatest danger in 
that respect lies in the Far East. 
Yet if such large-scale breakdowns are to be brought 
within a measure of control, then, side by side with a 
concerted effort to increase productivity of agriculture in 
the developing countries, population stabilization must be 
undertaken simultaneously as a social policy of urgent 
priority without further delay. It should be undertaken 
nationally under the moral leadership of national leaders 
on as wide a scale as possible, supported internationally, 
not only through provision of scientific information but 
also with the necessary equipment and trained staff as well 
as finance. 
The next two or three decades will be a critical period 
in man's history, and will either see the beginning of 
mankind as a whole taking responsibility for its destiny 
or the drift towards disaster. But inaction will be a counsel 
of despair. Man with his inexhaustible resources of intelli- 
gence and inventiveness is capable of meeting the challenge. 
What is necessary is to put moral ardour and unbending 
will into the heart of this intelligence. Only thus will human 
fellowship and human rights acquire their true meaning.

TALES 
OF 
MANY CITIES 
“MILLIONAIRE” CITIES 
INCREASE FROM 30 TO 8C 
IN 20 YEARS 
Some 80 of the world's cities now 
have one million or more inhabitants. 
Only 60 cities of that size existed in 
1955 and two decades ago the number 
was 30. These figures, given by the 
United Nations Demographic Year- 
book-1964, are based on population 
statistics for the city proper and not 
on those for overall urban areas. 
MUSHROOM GROWTH 
The population of Caracas, capital 
of Venezuela, has quintupled in 
the past twenty years. Cairo, Afri- 
ca's largest city, now has 3,518,000 
inhabitants compared with 2,000,000 
in 1947. The population of Bogota, 
capital of Colombia (photo right), in- 
creased from 648,000 to 1,680.000 
between 1951 and 1964. Brazil's new 
capital, Brasilia, had only 12,823 in- 
habitants in 1957; today, it has over 
130,000. 
62 BIRTHS 
PER 1,000 POPULATION 
The world's highest reported birth 
rate is in Mali: 62 per 1,000 population. 
Among other countries with high birth 
rates are El Salvador (46.8 per 1,000) 
and Mexico (45.1). Birth rates in at 
least 15 European countries have 
followed an upward trend in recent 
years. 
Infant mortality is high in many 
developing countries. In Mali, the 
Central African Republic, the Congo 
(Brazzaville) and Niger, 200 or more 
of every 1,000 babies born alive die 
in their first year. High infant mortality 
rates—125 to 179 per 1,000 births— 
are reported by Basutoland, Upper 
Volta, Haiti, Turkey, Morocco, india, 
the United Arab Republic and Indo- 
nesia. In contrast, infant death rates 
have decreased in 113 out of 
180 countries and territories since 
1960. In Sweden the rate has been 
reduced to 15 per 1,000 population 
and is only slightly higher in the 
Netherlands, Norway and Finland. 
WOMEN OUTLIVE MEN 
In all but four countries—Cambodia, 
Ceylon, India and Upper Volta— 
women can expect to live longer than 
men. In the U.S.A. baby girls have 
a life expectancy of 73 years com- 
pared with 67 for boys. In India,

In El Salvador, for 
an expectation of life of 45 years 
which rises to 52 years if they survive 
until their first birthday. 
For persons 30 years old total life 
span expectancy is usually higher 
than it is for those born today because 
the older persons have already passed 
through infancy and early childhood 
during which mortality is likely to be 
high. In Canada, for example, male 
children born today can expect to live 
to 68 years of age, whereas men now 
aged 30 have on the average another 
42 years to live—an advantage of four 
years over the newborn. Canadian 
men who have reached 70 years of 
age have on the average another 
11 years to live.

MARRIAGE AND DIVORCE 
The largest number of marriages for 
every 1,000 persons in the population 
is registered in Europe and the Soviet 
Union. 
Of some 150 countries and terri- 
tories, more than half report a 
downward trend in marriages. The 
rates have decreased in virtually all 
countries of South America. In Can- 
ada, the U.S.A. and almost half of 
the European countries, however, 
marriage rates have increased since 
1960. A typical European marriage 
rate is found in Italy and Czechoslo- 
vakia (8 annually for every 1,000 per- 
sons). Rates in other parts of the 
world range from 9.9 per 1,000 in 
Japan and 9 in the U.S.A. to 6.9 in 
Chile, 7.4 in Australia and 8 in New 
Zealand. 
In most European countries there 
are between 2 and 10 divorces per 
5,000 persons. In the U.S.A. there 
are 11 divorces yearly for every 
5,000 persons. In South America the 
rate is about one or two divorces 
annually for every 5000 persons.

“How many children would you like 
when you get married?” To this ques- 
tion which the Czech youth daily, Mla-

replied that they would like two child- 
ren. Responses to the newspaper's 
questionnaire on marriage, which were 
analyzed by specialists of the State 
Population Commission, showed that 
only one bey and one girl in 100 want- 
ed five or more children and only four 
young people in 1,000 had decided not 
to have children. Imquiries in other 
countries among the population as a 
whole show that in Austria, the Federal 
German Republic and Hungary most 
people want two children. In the UK, 
France, Switzerland, Italy, Norway, the 
Netherlands, U.S.A. and Ceylon the 
average preference is for three child- 
ren. In Ghana and the Philippines, the 
average couple wants five children.

TALES OF MANY CITIES 
(Cont'd) 
700 MILLION CITY DWELLERS 
Nearly one quarter of the world's 
population (approximately 720 million 
persons) was living in cities with 20,000 
inhabitants or more in 1960— a 359, 
increase in the urban population 
within a single decade. 
The trend continues. Urban popu- 
lations are increasing at a greater 
rate, especially in the developing 
countries, than the overall growth of 
world population. In some large 
cities the annual growth rate is now 
8 per cent. Pakistan estimates that 
by 1985 its urban population will have 
increased by 25 per cent in East and 
40 per cent in West Pakistan. The 
cost of urban expansion may absorb 
half of Pakistan's development effort 
over the next 20 years. 
The large scale concentration of 
urban populations is a comparatively 
new development. Cities with 100,000 
inhabitants probably did not exist 
before the Greek or Roman period. 
In 1800 there were 900 million people 
on the globe. Of these, 15,300,000 
lived in cities of 100,000 inhabitants 
or over, 21,600,000 in cities of 20,000 
or over and 27 million in towns 
of over 5,000 inhabitants. Between 
1800 and 1950 world population 
increased over two and a half times. 
But the urban population increased 
far more rapidty— 26-fold in towns 
of 5,000 or more inhabitants, and 
20-fold in cities of 100,000 or more. 
CONTINENTAL INCREASES 
Within the overall world population 
increase of 1.9 per cent annually there 
is a great disparity between the rates 
of increase in developed and deve- 
loping countries. The populations of 
Latin America, Africa and Asia mul- 
tiply much more rapidly than those 
of Europe and North America. 
Populations by region in mid-1964 
and their average annual rates of 
increase were as follows:

INTERNATIONAL RICE YEAR 
Rice is the staple food of one third of the world’s 
people—1,100 million human beings. At the present 
rate of population growth that third will have become 
one half of mankind by the end of the century, 
and when that happens famine may be added to 
undernourishment. It is for the millions of rice- 
eating people of the world that FAO has dedicated 
1966 as International Rice Year. In 23 rice-produc- 
ing countries special efforts will be made to produce 
bumper crops (through the distribution of improved 
seeds, better water managment, greater use of 
fertilizer, mechanization programmes, pest and 
disease control and more rational methods of 
marketing and storage). Seven thousand varieties 
of rice are grown from the Equatorto Czechoslovakia 
and Hungary, from the tropical swamps of Liberia 
to the Himalayas. A word-wide campaign has now 
been launched. Special aid will be available to

rice-growers. Experimental stations will be increas- 
ed and demonstrations given of machinery and 
cultivation techniques. To meet the challenge of 
growing food needs, Asia has in a decade added 
more than 25 million acres to her paddy, Latin 
America more than four million acres and Africa 
about 750,000 acres. Some countries can point to 
spectacular results: production doubled since 1954 
in the United Arab Republic, for example. In the 
world as a whole production has increased 259%, 
in ten years, but it is still insufficient, and in many 
countries the annual harvest still fails to meet 
national needs. Yields per acre are two to three 
times higher in the economically developed countries 
(Europe, North America and Australia) than in the 
developing countries. Only by the use of science 
and technology can the rice needs of tomorrow's 
populations be met.

### 16924: The World is heading for a collision

THE WORLD IS 
HEADING FOR 
A COLLISION 
by Gunnar Myrdal 
WwW E must have the candour to face the fact that, 
as a prominent American agricultural econo- 
mist, Professor Earl L. Butz, has expressed it: “The world is 
on a collision course. When the massive force of an 
exploding world population meets the much more stable 
trend line of world food production, something must give. 
Unless we give increased attention now to the softening of 
the impending collision, many parts of the world within 
a decade will be skirting a disaster of such a proportion 
as to threaten the peace and stability of the Western 
world.” 
In contemplating the threatening world food crisis we 
have to recall that in several very big countries like India 
and Pakistan and many smaller ones, it would have 
already broken out, had it not been for the availability of 
large-scale food imparts granted without foreign exchange 
compensation, mainly from the surpluses in the United 
States. 
An intensification of the food crisis would create an 
internationally intolerable situation. In spite of all tension 
and clashes, we are now much more one world than 
we were a generation ago. Communications have revolu- 
tionized our relations. | have no doubt that when the 
crisis comes, people in the rich countries will suddenly 
respond. . 
(f the lid of production restriction is lifted in the United 
States, food production could rise very much; Canada, 
Australia and a few other countries are in a similar 
situation. But we should not expect these countries to 
send this food and carry the financial burden alone. 
Other rich countries will have to share the financial 
burden, but they will do it only if this food aid is inter- 
nationalized. Under these conditions it is well that we have 
an international agency, working under the auspices of the 
U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, The World Food 
Programme, already in operation on an experimental scale, 
and that according to unanimous opinion jt has been run 
econamically and effectively. 
Internationally organized food aid, however, can under no 
circumstances, be a permanent solution of the problem: it 
 
GUNNAR MYRDAL is one of the world's best-known figures in 
sociology and economics. A member of the Royal Academy of 
Sciences in Sweden and former executive secretary of the United 
Nations Economic Commission for Europe, he is now a professor 
of international economy at Stockholm University. This article is 
the conclusion of a lecture he delivered in November 1965 at 
Rome under the auspices of FAQ. 
can merely bridge over an emergency. As a staff econo- 
mist in the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Lester 8. Brown, 
has recently pointed out the increase in grain consumption 
by 1980, necessary in order to meet the expected population 
increase and a modest rise of 10 percent in per capita con- 
sumption, would boost grain production requirements by 
almost as much as the current output of North America 
and Western Europe combined. 
A similarly forbidding calculation could be made of the 
shipping facilities necessary for an extensive food aid 
program. The sharp impact of that type of flight into 
fantasy is that, even if for a short time the first shocks 
of the food crisis can be absorbed by aid from the rich 
countries, the very great increase in agricultural produc- 
tion that is urgently needed if disaster is to be averted 
must begin to take place in the vast underdeveloped regions. 
How this is going to be accomplished is the main busi- 
ness of the agricultural ministries in underdeveloped coun- 
tries, of this organization, and of the present conference. 
Even if reforms can have their full effects only in the 
somewhat longer run, it is urgent that they are under- 
taken without delay and that they are planned in such 
a way that they will have as much result as possible, as 
quickly as possible. As a matter of fact, | feel much less 
concerned about how things will look at the turn of the 
next century. In the long run much will happen; we will 
perhaps have entirely new techniques to produce the 
food; the entire world situation will be different in all sorts 
of ways; forecasts are bound to be proven wrong; perhaps 
we may feel optimistic that things will in some way take 
a radically new turn as we have often seen happening 
before. It is the years to come in this decade and the 
next about which | am worried. In the short run, our 
forecasts are more: reliable and they point to danger of 
warld calamity. 
A BOUT the policy measures to be undertaken | 
will restrict myself to a few brief observations. 
| want first to emphasize that, contrary to the experience 
in the developed countries, what increase of food production 
there has been in the underdeveloped countries—not enough 
to match the population increase, but there has been an 
increase—has mainly been due to an extension of the 
cultivated area, while the yields per acre have hardly 
risen at all; this is true even in a country like India with 
a very high manfland ratio and very low yields. New

HEADING FOR A COLLISION (Cont'd) 
Have we passed the point of no return? 
cultivable land is becoming scarce or else the costs of 
cultivating it are forbiddingly high. Yields are generally 
very low, which by itself should be reason for hope, if 
there could be such a change in agricultural technology 
that the yields would rise. 
While, of course, there is much technology available, 
the application of which is continuously proving itself to 
be of importance, nevertheless there is to a large extent 
need for a entirely new technology that has to be invented 
and applied. This is due to two circumstances. For one 
thing, most of the underdeveloped countries are in the 
tropical and sub-tropical zones and there has been very 
little of that specialized and localized practical research 
which in the developed countries has made possible the 
rapid rise in yields. 
We are all aware of the disappointments that are often 
experienced when applying fertilizers, for instance, or trying 
to use seeds which should give bigger crops. Very much 
more programmed, practically directed, specialized and loca- 
lized research into food production in these areas with 
their particular climates and soil conditions, would be 
warranted. 
Moreover— and this is too often overlooked even by 
agricultural experts— while from the beginning agricultural 
technology in the now developed countries could reckon 
with a decrease of labour in agriculture, most under- 
developed countries will have to adjust their technology to 
an agricultural labour force that is now under-utilized and 
for a generation will rise in numbers about as fast as the 
present very rapid population increase. 
F ORTUNATELY, the road seems now to be open- 
ing for a much more determined policy of 
spreading birth control among the masses. But we would 
deceive ourselves if we counted on a rapid decline in fer- 
tility. Also, the relatively greater number of children, which 
is a reflection of the higher fertility up till now, implies that 
the population increase has a tremendous momentum. The 
braking distance is so long. 
This does not mean that a decrease in fertility would 
not always and immediately improve income per head and 
living levels, by lessening the dependency burden in the 
families, but it does imply that the birth curve in a nation 
will not be lowered as fast as if the age distribution were 
a more normal one, adjusted to a more stable population. 
Finally, the effects on the labour force are delayed for 
fifteen years and will be very inconsequential for a whole 
generation. The future workers are already born or will 
soon be born. 
To this comes the fact that industrialization in most of 
the underdeveloped countries, even if it proceeded much 
faster than it does, will not for decades absorb much addi- 
tional labour. | would like too to spell this out in a little 
more detail but just cannot do it. You will have to take 
it from me that the increase in labour demand is a function 
not only of the speed of industrialization but of the level 
from which it starts. Under certain circumstances indus- 
trialization will even throw out more labour in traditional 
industry and craft than it gives new employment. This is 
no reason for not trying to industrialize as fast as possible: 
when once a higher level of industrialization is reached, 
industry will increasingly employ more labour on a large 
scale. Meanwhile, however, a swelling flow of refugees 
from the countryside to the cities is not productive. 
All this amounts to saying that agricultural technology 
must try to increase yields per acre by putting to more 
effective work a labour force which is now already under- 
utilized to a vast extent and which will be rapidly increas- 
ing for decades. This new, extremely intensive labour 
technology is in part yet to be developed by fresh research. 
A substantial and rapid increase in agriculture yields 
has rarely, if ever, occurred in traditional self-sufficiency 
farming, where illiteracy is prevalent and the relation 
between the farmer and his land is such that he has little 
possibility and little incentive to exert himself. 
Among the several institutional problems raised by this 
observation | would give high priority to the need for 
land reform in the broadest sense of the word. It would 
have a different direction in countries with different 
systems of ownership and tenancy and it has to be accom- 
panied by other induced changes in regard to education, 
marketing, availability of credits, etc. It must often be 
costly in order to be effective in raising yields, and | think 
we should begin to consider whether international credits 
could not be given to make it more possible for under- 
developed countries to speed up land reforms and under- 
take all the other measures necessary to render these 
reforms really productive. 
But that assumes that these underdeveloped countries, 
or rather those in these countries who have the political 
power, begin to take seriously the urgent need for 
reorganizing the relations between the toiler and the land 
he tills. | think it is tragic—and a contributory cause of 
no small importance to the grave situation we face today— 
that local vested interests have made a sham of land 
reform in so many countries. 
FAO has for many years courageously and competently 
laboured with land reform, and | have a feeling that in 
recent years it has been reaping results in a greater 
interest in many countries to do something effectively to 
solve the problem, even if in other countries | sense a 
tendency to try to forget about it and focus public atten- 
tion only on the more technical problems. 
| fear that we are becoming accustomed to living 
on happily and attending to the business of the 
day while not giving much thought to the possibility or proba- 
bility of the unthinkable ahead of us. To this category | 
reckon the outcome of the atomic armament race and the 
less publicized preparation for biological and chemical war- 
fare; as time goes on without effective intergovernmental 
agreement to stop this development, improvements in tech- 
nology must make it easier and cheaper for all sorts of 
countries to equip themselves for genocide. 
To this category of unthinkably menacing calamities 
belongs also the gathering food crisis. We seem to be 
taking the pattern from the entirely rational way in which 
we as individuals live on happily from day to day and work 
and enjoy ourselves, though we know we are soon 
approaching the personal catastrophe of death. Otherwise 
life would be unbearable; nothing can be done about it 
anyhow; and our nations and mankind do not perish with 
us but will survive, ’ 
But this attitude—rational for an individual—is danger- 
ously irrational for society, when we take it as members 
of a nation and of mankind. Social catastrophes are differ- 
ent from the certainty of death for the individual, as they 
can and should be averted. And if we do not use foresight 
and take measures against them, we all perish and there 
will be no posterity.

In Hong Korg, 
one of the world's big 
cities with 
3,800,000 inhabitants, 
shortage of 
water has long 
been a problem. 
In 1963 a fleet of 
water tankers 
was needed to bring 
12 miluon gallons daily to 
the drought-stricken 
city. Since 
then large scale 
reservoir construction has 
improved the situation.

C ITIES all over the world, 
faced with huge popul- 
ation Increases that are expected to 
double the rate of water consumption 
within the next 20 years, are now 
much concerned with the expansion 
of their water supplies. Man's fast 
growing demand for more water 
everywhere, and the consequent need 
to develop new sources of supply, is 
the reason behind the International 
Hydrological Decade, a world-wide 
ten-year programme of scientific 
search launched by Unesco last year. 
Many cities, of course, are fortunate 
about a century ago, Hong Kong's 
water storage capacity has been 
vastly increased. But the population 
grows so fast that before one new 
reservoir is completed, another and 
larger one is required. With no major 
rivers or large lakes within the 
territory, its water supply depends 
mainly on the annual rainfall, three- 
quarters of which falls during the 
monsoon season between May and 
September. 
This rainfall is by no means depend- 
able, however, and all too often the 
monsoon period has passed with in-

sufficient water stored, so that 
additional restrictions on its use have 
had to be imposed through the long 
winter months. Indeed, over the past 
thirty years it has only rarely been 
possible to provide a constant 
domestic water supply in Hong Kong. 
Every available space suitable to 
catch rainwater on the main island 
has been turned into a reservoir. So 
Hong Kong's biggest water storage 
scheme so far—the gigantic Shek Pik 
reservoir completed in 1963—had to 
be built on the smaller outlying island 
of Lantau, from which the water is 
in being able to draw on virtually 
unlimited sources of water from major 
rivers or abundant underground 
springs close at hand. But for many 
others, situated in drought areas, it 
means the construction and main- 
tenance of costly pipeline and conduit 
systems to bring water across desert 
or parched bush country from the 
distant rivers and lakes. For all cities, 
however, there must be increasing 
expenditure on larger storage re- 
servoirs, more pumping and purifica- 
tion plants, and the wider extension 
of water distribution mains to new 
housing and Industrial estates on city 
outskirts.

Water is a most precious commodity 
to the 3,800,000 people who live in 
Hong Kong, the small, densely popul- 
ated island city and mainland territory 
off the south coast of mainland China. 
Shortage of water has been a perennial 
problem there from the early days of 
the trading port to its present status 
as a highly industrialized centre of the 
Far East, which lives by selling 
manufactured goods all over the world. 
It is ironical that the great economic 
and social advancement in Hong Kong 
of recent years has made the water 
supply problem much more acute,

HONG KONG - A THIRSTY CITY (Cont'd) 
30,000 million gallons 
of fresh water by 1968 
brought to the city through a sea-bed 
pipeline eight miles long. 
The Shek Pik reservoir lay empty 
for many months, however, because 
the 1963 rains failed and Hong Kong 
suffered one of the worst droughts 
ever. For the third time in the 
territory's history, water had to be 
brought from mainland China by tanker 
vessels. At great expense, because 
drastic action was needed, the Hong 
Kong Government chartered a fleet of 
water-carrying tankers which brought 
some 12 million gallons daily to the 
drought-stricken city from the Pearl 
River. 
During the year the tanker shuttle 
service made a total of 1,371 round 
trips, bringing 4,228 million gallons— 
or almost one-third of the whole water 
consumption during the period. Even 
so, for more than twelve months the 
city was strictly rationed to only four 
hours of water supply every fourth 
day. 
Then, when the rains finally came, 
in May 1964, there were typhoons of 
great violence, and on a single day 
no less than eleven and a half inches 
of rain fell. As water poured into the 
reservoirs, supply restrictions were 
eased to every other day. But while 
the heavy rains relieved one great 
anxiety, the typhoons caused very 
extensive damage and loss of homes 
costing several hundreds of lives be- 
fore their fury was spent. 
While the drought was at its height, 
Hong Kong celebrated the completion 
of the Shek Pik water scheme—one 
  
of the most advanced in South-East 
Asia—which cost £15 million ($42 mil- 
lion) to construct. The vast reservoir 
can hold 5,400 million gallons of water, 
bringing the territory's total storage 
capacity to almost 16,000 million 
gallons. In other words, it has 
increased Hong Kong's available 
water by about 50 per cent. Mile upon 
mile of catchment channels surround 
the Shek Pik reservoir to ensure that 
the maximum amount of rain is 
collected, and the drainage area 
extends across more than 8,000 acres. 
The Shek Pik Water Scheme was 
something much more than a remark- 
able and complex feat of engineering. 
It has changed the social and 
economic standards of the people of 
Lantau Island, where the primitive 
way of life and barren landscape had 
remained unchanged for centuries. It 
has brought the villagers new homes, 
schools, medical clinics, communic- 
ations and public utilities, including a 
piped water supply. 
Two small villages—Shek Pik itself 
with 200 inhabitants, and Fan Pui with 
62 inhabitants—lay in the way of the 
new dam. The Shek Pik villagers 
elected to move into new shops and 
apartments at Tsuen Wan on the 
mainland. But those of Fan Pui, who 
wished to stay in the area, were 
provided with a completely new 
village with modern amenities just a 
few miles away from the old and 
primitive one. 
Vast as the Shek Pik scheme is, it 
is still not adequate to meet the long 
Crowded on its 
island, with no 
major rivers or 
large lakes, 
Hong Kong depends 
mainly on rainfall 
for its water supply.

of great violence:

of rain fell.

term future water needs of Hong 
Kong. Engineers are therefore already 
engaged on what is by far the largest 
and most ambitious water storage 
project yet attempted. At Plover Cove, 
in the New Territories on the mainland, 
a sea inlet of the coast is being 
enclosed by a main dam, one and a 
half miles long, and two subsidiary 
dams. When these are completed, the 
trapped sea water will be pumped out 
and the inlet converted into a fresh- 
water lake. 
By 1968 Plover Cove will be ready 
to hold 30,000 million gallons of 
water—five or six times as much as 
the Shek Pik reservoir. Moreover, by 
heightening the enclosing dam at a 
later stage, its capacity can be 
increased to 40,000 million gallons, a 
figure which makes interesting com- 
parison with the 16,000 million gallons 
total storage capacity of Hong Kong's 
present fifteen reservoirs. 
When the Plover Cove scheme is 
fully completed, it will take the form 
of a circle of tunnels 25 miles long 
round the edge of Tolo Harbour, with 
a connecting sea bed pipeline across 
the entrance. Water from streams 
overhead will be diverted into the 
tunnels by a series of drop shafts 
and branch tunnels. By means of a 
complex system of weirs, gates and 
pumping stations, the water can be 
passed in two directions, either to a 
treatment works feeding new service 
reservoirs for the city or, during 
floods, to a large storage reservoir at 
Plover Cove. 
For some years the governments of 
Hong Kong and mainland China have 
had an agreement by which Hong Kong 
has drawn water from the Sham Chun 
reservoir in Kwangtung Province just 
over the border. This supply proved 
unreliable, especially at times when 
Kwangtung itself suffered drought. So 
in 1964 a new agreement was made 
under which Hong Kong buys a 
guaranteed 15,000 million gailons a 
year from the East River. This is 
brought south into the territory from 
mainland China by overland pipeline. 
With this Chinese supply and her 
own gigantic reservoir schemes— 
together with further projects which 
are still in the planning stage—the 
long standing water shortage in Hong 
Kong should be overcome within the 
next decade and all future water 
supply requirements in the territory 
assured.

### 18411: Our pint-size ancestors

Museum visitors are often puzzled 
by suits of ancient 
armour. How on earth 
did the sturdy 
warriors of the past squeeze 
inside such tiny metal 
shells? The answer is 
simple. They were smaller 
than the men of today. In 
this century alone the 
average man has grown 
taller by from 7 to 10 cms 
(3 to 4 ins). Armour shown here 
is a 16th-century German 
suit weighing 35 kg 
(77 lbs) displayed

S CIENTISTS in the economically advanced coun- 
tries have been struck by the fact that children 
for the past one hundred years have been growing and 
developing faster and are taller when they reach adulthood. 
Doctors in many countries are working to determine 
whether this accelerated growth is actually harmful for 
the health of young people or not. There are many educa- 
tionists and psychiatrists who now feel that a reappraisal 
and indeed a sweeping revision is called for with regard to 
our present ideas about the physical and psychological 
development of children, as well as the age when sex 
education should begin. The rapid growth of children is 
also having widespread repercussions in unexpected do- 
mains like the size of school desks and other furniture, sizes 
of junior models of clothes for boys and girls, etc. 
In the past 30 or 40 years it has been found that the aver- 
age height of new-born babies has increased by almost half 
an inch (one centimetre) and weight at birth has also shown

a slight rise. New-born babies now double their weight one 
month earlier than in the past. 
Compared to children of the second half of the 18th 
and the turn of the present century the height-to-weight ratio 
of today's youngsters has increased much more rapidly. 
The differences are particularly noticeable at the age of 
puberty as shown in the graph published above comparing 
the height of 13-year-old boys in several countries. 
Further information reveals that the average height of 
these 13-year-old boys has increased by almost one inch 
(2 centimetres) in a decade and their weight by nearly three- 
and a half pounds (1% kilos). Amongst boys in the 14 to 
16 year age group the rate of increase is even greater. 
Figures on 15-year-old boys studying in Soviet vocational 
schools and boys of the same age who worked in Russian 
industry in 1822 reveal that today’s youth are on average 
seven and a half inches (19.5 cms) taller and thirty five 
pounds (16 kilos) heavier than their counterparts of 150 
years ago. A less marked increase has also been noted 
amongst girls. 
Comparing the growth rate of children living in towns 
and rural areas in various parts of the world it has been 
found that children in large cities grow and develop faster 
than youngsters in small towns, and small town children in 
turn develop faster than those in rural areas. In some 
countries a difference has been observed in the develop- 
ment rate of city children belonging to different social 
groups. 
One consequence of the increase in height and weight of 
youngsters has been an acceleration of the advent of 
puberty. A century ago European girls attained puberty 
on average at the age of 16 or 17. Now it is usually 13 or 
14. Similar findings have been made for boys. 
Other indications of accelerated development in children 
54 
is 
  
           
today are the earlier cutting of teeth and the ossification 
of different parts of the skeleton, including the cartilages 
at the end of the long bones—an important factor determin- 
ing body growth. 
This accelerated growth also means that children now 
stop growing at an earlier age. In the past, growth contin- 
ued until the age of 18 or 20; today most youngsters are 
fully grown at 17 or 18, and girls at 16. This does not 
prevent them, however, from growing to be taller than 
their parents. 
Investigations carried out in the Soviet Union show that 
for the past 60 years young people have been maturing at 
least two ‘years sooner than before, so that a 15-year-old 
boy of today is as mature physically and sexually as a 
17-year-old youth was at the start of the century. 
Research in many countries, such as France, Italy, Poland, 
Czechoslovakia, Great Britain and the United States, indi- 
cates that young people are now six to eight inches (15-20 
cms) taller on average when they reach the age of puberty 
than those who lived a hundred years ago. The average 
height of adults, during this same period, has risen by three 
to four inches (7-10 cms). 
Many theories have been advanced in an attempt to 
explain this quickened growth, among them the effects of 
extra sunshine, improved diet, pre-natal care and even the 
stepped up pace of city living. In my opinion the chief cause 
is probably genetic in nature. In 1924 a Soviet scientist, Vic- 
tor Bunak, in analysing changes in the height of young men 
of military age from several European countries suggested 
that height and growth were not only influenced by economic 
and dietary factors but also by the genetic changes resulting 
from the inter-marriage of different populations. 
There can be no doubt however that the material condi- 
tions of life strongly determine the growth rate and are 
instrumental in favouring or retarding the genetically prede- 
termined potential for growth.

As to the psychological acceleration noted in modern 
youth, all research conducted in this domain points to the 
fact that the children of our times are intellectually more 
developed than those of 50 or 100 years ago. But scientists 
do not always agree in their assessments of children’s capa- 
city for work or their ability to think critically. 
Some scientists consider that physical and intellectual 
development in children proceed simultaneously and in 
harmony, while others maintain that the intellectual growth 
lags beind physical growth, 
The question naturally arises as to whether such accele- 
rated growth has a negative effect on the health of the 
growing generation. The widely-held theory that an early 
development of the body leads inevitably to premature old 
age and a shortened life span has never been confirmed. 
To the contrary, it appears that today’s women, aside from 
reaching sexual maturity earlier, retain the capacity for child- 
bearing three to five years longer. 
Futhermore, some problems of eyesight characteristic of 
old age develop five to eight years later now than was the 
case a hundred years ago. 
Nevertheless, some scientists remain apprehensive about 
the effect of this accelerated growth on health. They cite 
cases of spine deformations, a tendency toward asthenia 
(weakness and fatigue), an increase ini the number of child- 
ren suffering from rheumatism at an early age and numerous 
cases of hypertension (high blood pressure). So far these 
apprehensions are insufficient for any final conclusions but 
they merit the attention of biologists and doctors. 
Educators ask: ls this early development good or bad; 
should we be pleased by it, ignore it, or try to slow it 
down? There is still no exact answer. 
Did this acceleration really start in the 1830s, or is it 
rather a process that has been taking place since the

beginning . of mankind and which is gradually gaining 
momentum? 
It appears that the changes in man's growth have their 
ups and downs—or so some anthropologists and medical 
reasearchers feel. In the areas where archaeological and 
paleo-anthropological reasearch have been able to trace 
successive populations over millenia, scientists note that 
the size of men underwent much slower—and more varia- 
ble—modifications. 
There have also been variations in the age of puberty 
among European women. It apparently was the same from 
ancient times until the 15th century. The women of South- 
ern Europe reached puberty at 14, those of Northern Europe 
at 15. Then it became increasingly late until, by the end 
of the 18th century, it was reached at 17 or 18. But since 
the 1830s the trend has been reversed sharply. 
Where does the over-all acceleration tendency stand 
today? Since it is slowing in some countries and social 
groups, one can assume that in the economically advanced 
regions it will come to a halt in the next 20 to 25 years. In 
the developing countries, on the other hand, the next few 
decades of improving economic and cultural standards will 
be accompanied by an acceleration in the growth rate. 
Will we then see a period of relative stability, or will there 
be a decrease in growth and development? At present, it 
is difficult to judge.

### 18868: To all young people twenty years old: a message from René Maheu, Director-General of UNESCO, for the New Year 1966

  
“ss T0 ALL YOUNG PEOPLE 
&=% TWENTY YEARS OLD    
S the New Year begins, my thoughts and my good wishes go out especially 
A message to you, young people all over the world, who will be twenty this year, 
from First of all because good wishes are the natural companions of hope, 
and you who stand on the threshold of the springtime of life are indeed 
our hope. And also because Unesco is your age; like yourselves it will be celebrat- 
Reneé Maheu ing its twentieth birthday in 1966. 
There is no doubt that between you and Unesco there are those affinities, that 
Director-General spontaneous fellow-feeling which historians find in a given generation like the very 
air it breathes. May there be between you and the Organization an understanding 
of Unesco no less great than this resemblance which will gradually be revealed in the mirror 
of history! 
f th : Meanwhile, you are a mirror for those who set up the Organization or who, like 
or e myself, have served it from the beginning. In your eyes, which turn towards the 
New Year future, we see our past, and the way it will probably look to coming generations. 
In your hearts, your souls, we see the value of our work. 
1966 For it was indeed for you, first and foremost, that the founders and original ser- 
vants of Unesco worked, and the true measure of our success is the contribution 
we have been able to make to the conditions that ensure your dignity and your 
happiness. 
We are of course fully aware that our endeavours are not free of imperfections 
and mistakes, and these we deeply regret. : 
| know that we have not wholly succeeded in persuading you that justice and 
reason, tolerance and goodwill, must inspire your thoughts and govern your actions, 
when, in the world which we are handing on to you, injustice and hatred, misunder- 
standing and violence, are still rife. We have not succeeded in making you bend 
your energies exclusively to the work of securing the unity of mankind, which is 
peace—we who still inflict on you the spectacle of our discords and rivalries. And 
| know all too well that we have not given you equality and that in spite of truly 
substantial advances we have not yet managed to provide for each of you sufficient 
education, science and culture to ensure that you all have equal opportunities of 
self-fulfilment. 
All this | know. But | also know, and can assure you with equal certainty and 
conviction, that never, especially for the young, have there been so many opportunities, 
SO many means, so many reasons to give expression and reality to that humanity 
which is in each and every one of us. Never has it been so possible, and so 
necessary, to be a man, and nothing—no lack, no flaw in today's world—must turn 
you aside from this inspiring and sacred task. 
We live in an age when nature has been mastered, an age of which a great 
scientist has said: “For the first time in the course of history, man on earth faces 
only himself; he finds no longer any other partner or foe.” 
We live in an age when men are being brought together into a single brother- 
hood by the instantaneous nature of communication media. 
We live in an age of tremendous perils which threaten the very survival of our 
race, but, for that very reason, compel us to carry out a radical reform, political and 
moral, towards a better and safer destiny. 
And we live in an age when the reign of Man in his full universality is being 
organized. States have set up institutions designed to establish it step by step. 
The peoples of the world must support those institutions and help them forward. 
Unesco is one such agency. Born at the same time as yourselves, it was created 
for you. It has grown up with you, it is through you that it will come to be what 
it must be to fulfil the great hope it carries of achieving peace through the conversion 
of men’s minds. 
On behalf of Unesco | wish you, my friends, most heartily, a happy New Year 
and a happy start in life. 
As for Unesco, its future is in your hands.

### 18951: U.N. Charter for youth

UN. CHARTER FOR YOUTH 
0 N December 7, 1965, the United Nations General Assembly 
unanimously adopted a historic declaration on youth. The U.N. 
Declaration on the Promotion among Youth of the Ideals of Peace, Mutual 
Respect and Understanding between Peoples, as it is officially termed, calls 
directly on the ‘younger generation to help safeguard international peace 
and security. “Young people,” it declares, “must become conscious of 
their responsibilities in the world they will be call upon to manage.” 
The idea and a first draft of a U.N. Declaration on youth were originally 
proposed by Rumania in 1962, and the final text was adopted after four years 
of discussions and consultations between states, U.N. bodies and youth 
movements throughout the world. Unesco was closely associated with 
this work in consultation with its national commissions and with the 
Unesco-sponsored International Conference on Youth, held in Grenoble, 
France in 1964. 
In a message to Mr. Amintore Fanfani, then President of the U.N. General 
Assembly, Unesco’s Director-General, Mr. René Maheu, hailed the adoption 
of the Declaration as an event of far-reaching importance, and the 
Declaration itself as a valuable tool for Unesco in its efforts to foster 
international understanding among youth. “I think that Unesco’s long-term 
programme for ‘youth should help to give practical reality to the 
Declaration,” Mr. Maheu said. “This programme seeks to help youth take 
an active share in the economic, social and cultural development of their 
communities and to participate in projects for international co-operation. 
It also seeks to give youth an opportunity to use their energies for the 
building of a more just and brotherly world.” 
Below we publish the full text of the six principles set forth in the Declara- 
tion which the United Nations has called on governments, non-governmental 
  
organizations and youth movements to recognize and act upon. 
(1) Young people shall be brought up 
in the spirit of peace, justice, free- 
dom, mutual respect and understanding 
in order to promote equal rights for all 
human beings and all nations, economic 
and social progress, disarmament and 
the maintenance of international peace 
and security. 
€) a means of education, including 
as of major importance the guidance 
given by parents or family, instruction 
and information intended for the young 
should foster among them the ideals of 
peace, humanity, liberty and internatio- 
nal solidarity and all other ideals which 
help to bring peoples closer together, 
and acquaint them with the role entrust- 
ed to the United Nations as a means 
of preserving and maintaining peace 
and promoting international understand- 
ing and co-operation. 
© Young people shall be brought up 
in the knowledge of the dignity and 
equality of all men without distinction 
as to race, colour, ethnic origins or 
beliefs, and in respect for fundamental 
human rights and for the right of peo- 
ples to self-determination. 
Exchanges, travel, tourism, meet- 
ings, the study of foreign lan- 
guages, the twinning of towns and uni- 
versities without discrimination and 
similar activities should be encouraged 
and facilitated among young people of 
all countries in order to bring them 
together in educational, cultural and 
sporting activities in the spirit of this 
Declaration. 
National and international associa- 
tions of young people should be 
encouraged to promote the purposes of 
the United Nations, particularly interna- 
tional peace and security, friendly rela- 
tions among nations based on respect 
for the equal sovereignty of States, the 
final abolition of colonialism and of 
raclal discrimination and other violations 
of human rights. 
Youth organizations in accordance 
with this Declaration should take all 
appropriate measures within their res- 
pective fields of activity in order to 
make their contribution without any 
discrimination to the work of educating 
the young generation in accordance 
with these ideals. 
Such organizations, in conformity with 
the principle of freedom of association, 
should promote the free exchange of 
ideas in the spirit of the principles of 
this Declaration and of the purposes of 
the United Nations set forth in the 
Charter. 
All youth organizations should con- 
form to the principles set forth in this 
Declaration. 
oO A major aim in educating the young 
shall be to develop all their facul- 
ties and to train them to acquire higher 
moral qualities, to be deeply attached 
to the noble ideals of peace, liberty, 
the dignity and equality of all men, and 
imbued with respect and love for huma- 
nity and its creative achievements. To 
this end the family has an important 
role to play. 
Young people must become conscious 
of their responsibilities in the world 
they will be called upon to manage and 
should be inspired with confidence in 
a future of happiness for mankind.   
From the Unesco News 
  
Knowledge of man 
and the universe 
On the occasion of the tenth anniversary 
of the deaths of Albert Einstein and Pierre 
Teilhard de Chardin, an international sym- 
posium on “Science and Synthesis of 
Knowledge on Man" was organized last 
December by Unesco at its H.Q. in Paris. 
Among the distinguished scientists who 
took part were Robert Oppenheimer, Julian 
Huxley, Louis de Broglie, Wemer Heisen- 
berg, Pierre Auger and Georgio Santillana. 
Refrigeration 
protection for spacemen 
Refrigeration of spaceship crews may 
be one way of protecting them against 
radiation dangers suggests Professor Nao- 
rair Sissakian, Soviet biochemist and mem- 
ber of the Academy of Sciences of the 
U.S.SR., in a recent issue of Unesco's 
quarterly, Impact of Science on Society 
(Vol XV, 1965, No 3; $.75, 4/-stg, 3 F). In 
addition to Professor Sissakian’s broad re- 
view of life in space, the issue deals with 
the impact of television on society, progress 
In water desalting techniques and the 
expansion of technological education In 
India. 
Food helps build 
schools and roads 
Food aid worth $1.5 million from the 
World Food Programme is to help build 
roads and community facilities in the isolat- 
ed highlands of Peru. It will go to 4,000 
workers and their families—20,000 people 
in all. The volunteer workers are to build 
1,452 kms (900 miles) of roads, and schools, 
health centres and other community ame- 
nities. Non-food cost of the project will 
be paid by the Peruvian Government 
($2.6 million) and by a U.S. Export-Import 
Bank loan ($2 million). 
Pilot project 
in chemistry teaching 
Unesco is sponsoring a pilot project in 
chemistry teaching for Asian schools. Tea- 
chers from universities in South and South 
East Asia are now at work in Bangkok with 
Unesco specialists, preparing films, pro- 
grammed instruction materials, laboratory 
equipment and guides to experiments in 
chemistry. Study groups from countries 
taking part in the project will later expe- 
riment with the teaching materials and will 
adapt them to national school programmes. 
Thus by 1968 these countries will dispose 
of modern chemistry teaching materials for 
secondary schools and teacher training 
colleges. 
 
Prodigal use of oxygen 
The earth's 3,000 million inhabitants are 
consuming as much oxygen as 43,000 mil- 
lion persons according to the director of 
the biotechnical Academy at Lauffen, near 
Salzburg, Austria. Industrialization accounts 
for the excess. On a 600-mile drive a car 
uses as much oxygen as a human being

New homes for seals

Sea to make more room for seal rookeries

Science teaching 
by television 
The largest educational television system 
yet planned in Britain has been ordered for 
a new science building at Edinburgh Uni- 
versity. The installation will include nine 
fully-automatic television cameras and 51 
receivers for the distribution network linking 
lecture theatres and viewing rooms. 
Tanzania's 
new community farms 
Farm families at Miale, southern Tanza- 
nia, stand to increase their former earnings 
of $60 per year five fold within three years 
through organized crop-raising, improved 
farm practices and co-operative man- 
agement of community affairs. Under a 
settlement scheme financed by the people 
of Ireland as a contribution to the FAO 
Freedom from Hunger Campaign, 235 fami- 
lies have been settled on 20-acre plots 
around three villages. They are growing 
maize for their own needs, fodder for their 
animals and tobacco as a cash crop. To 
Ireland's $389,000, the Tanzanian Gov- 
ernment has added $313,000. 
Mythical sea mounts 
and phantom shoals 
Oceanographers have been asked by the 
international Hydrographic Bureau in Mo- 
naco to help remove mythical sea mounts 
and phantom shoals from the world's nau- 
. 
  
tical charts. Each year hundreds of ships 
report seeing unexpectedly shallow depths 
on their echo recorders. These may well be 
uncharted sea mounts, but are more often 
a dense school of fish or a plankton layer. 
Even when doubtful reports are eliminated, 
at least 40 or 50 have to be publicized 
because they might be of oceanographic 
interest or mark a shipping hazard. The 
54-nation Intergovernmental Oceanographic 
Commission recently urged members to 
give greater emphasis to hydrographic 
observations in research programmes and 
thereby help to reduce the volume of doubt- 
ful hydrographic data. 
Toy libraries 
for Indian children 
Toys instead of books go out on loan at a 
new hbrary in New Delhi-—the Chacha 
Nehru Toy Library opened last year by the 
Share Your Toys Foundation for young 
people under 15. Chidren may take only 
one toy at a time on loan for seven days. 
If the toy has been well looked after, a 
rose flower (Chacha Nehru's red rose) is 
marked on the child's membership card. 
And when a child has eight roses a toy is 
given as a prize. If a toy is damaged or 
destroyed, the librarian marks a cross on 
the card. Two crosses debar the child 
from borrowing toys for a month. However, 
during eight months no one was asked to 
replace a toy. The experiment in New 
Delhi has proved such a success that si- 
milar toy libraries are planned for 10 other 
Indian cities including Bombay, Madras and 
Calcutta. 
In defence of human rights 
Over 100 judges, lawyers and law pro- 
fessors met in Vienna recently to discuss 
international protection of human rights on 
a regional basis throughout the world. The 
meeting was organized by the Council of 
Europe.

Yaacov Wald, a schoolboy from Tel Aviv, 
has built a small water desalting device 
which won him a prize in the 1965 Israel 
Science Model Contest organized by the 
Weizmann Institute of Science at Rehovot. 
Yaacov's device Is based on the principle 
that water boils at a lower temperature 
when the pressure is reduced. In his unit 
a vacuum is created by suction and water 
boiling under low pressure is converted into 
steam which is condensed into fresh water, 
heat being obtained In the process.

was given the following week, when the author of the message, Ivan Bell, 
explained how he had devised it. Ivan Bell wrote (in part): “We start with 
the assumption that there are Beings living on another planet who are able to 
receive our radio signals... At first glance the situation looks pretty hopeless. 
We know nothing about their physical senses. Do they depend on sight, hearing, 
a radio sense, telepathy or what? However, there is one ray of hope. We do 
know that they understand physical science with its mathematical basis. Somehow 
we must make use of this fact.. Our only common ‘language’ is mathematics, 
and as the situation is very difficult, we must start with the simplest possible state- 
ments and processes, namely counting and then adding.

MESSAGE TRANSLATED 
1. A list of the 24 symbols used—the alphabet minus letters 0 and X. 
2. Identification of the first ten symbols—A through J—with the numbers 1 
through 10. 
3. Use of symbols for “plus” and "equals™: 1+1=2; 1+14+1=3 and so on. 
4. Use of minus sign: 3 — 1=2; 4 — 1=3; 9 — 7=2. 
5. Zero introduced: 3+0=3; 8+0=8, and so on. 
6. Positional notation based on 10 is introduced: J=AN translates J into the 
decimal form 10; 10+1=11; 10+2=12 and so on. 
7. Use of multiplication symbol: 2X3=6; 5X2=10; 6 X10=60. 
8. Use of division symbol: 6+2=3; 10+2=5; 60=6=10. 
9. Exponents are introduced: 3*=9; 2°=32. 
10. Use of symbols for 100 and 1,000: 10X10=10"=S=100; 10X10X10=10'= 
T=1,000; 10X100=1,000; 10X1,000=10" 
11. Use of symbols for 1/10 and 1/100: 1=10=1/10; 1/10+10=1-100=1/100. 
12. The decimal sign is introduced: 1/10=.1; 1/10X2=.2; 1.4 — 1=.4=4X1/10. 
1/100=.01; 1/100X3=.03; 1/100+-10=.001; 1/100~+100=.0001.; 10X5.678= 
56.78; 100X5.678=567.8. 
13. The sign for “approximately equal to” is introduced: 79.98 = 80; 1,000+3 
= 1,000. Sign for pi is introduced: m=23.1416, 
14, 4 x 7X .0092° 
3 
The final item (No. 14) is the formula for the volume of a sphere; in this formula the 
radius is expressed by the figure .0092, As Bell recognized when he gave the 
answer to his message, there is an ambiguity here. The formula suggests that 
an actual sphere is being described. If the receivers of the message are 
on a planet in our solar system, they should be clever enough to deduce that 
the sun's radius is providing the unit of length, and that the radius of the 
third planet from the sun is approximately .0092 of the sun's radius. The 
expression therefore gives the volume of the Earth in relation to that of the sun 
and is the sign-off statement indicating the source of the message. 
When the “Japan Times" first published this puzzle six years ago, only four correct 
answers were received. As this issue goes to press, and with replies received 
from three countries only—France, Belgium and the U.S.A —twelve correct replies 
have reached us. We congratulate these readers from France: G. Doyen, P.-l. 
Féron, M. Peeters, F. Prudhon, R. Creton, J.-C. Froelich, C.-F. Durler, J. Houssain, 
and E. Giraud (a 14-year old student from southern France who writes that he 
will have to leave school this year because his parents cannot afford to pay for 
his further studies); L. Dessy, of Belgium; and D.S. Blacklock of the International 
Language Review, in the U.S.A. Our twelfth reader, from France, signed his 
name in code.

Letters to the Editor 
COURIER IN THE CONGO 
Sir, 
As an inspector for commercial 
education in the Democratic Republic 
of the Congo, | use various Unesco 
publications for their public relations 
value. Following the revision of the 
educational system here, one of the 
subjects introduced into the pro- 
gramme was “technology”, on which 
no manual was or still is available. 
However, the Unesco Courier is an 
ever-inspiring source of material as a 
base for discussion. Articles are read 
with the greatest interest and inspire 
teachers and pupils with new ideas.

NOT "THE" HIGHEST 
Sir, 
In a photo caption with the interest- 
ing article on the Asian Higway (June 
1965) | was surprised to read 
that a road tunnel being completed in 
Afghanistan to carry the Asian High- 
way through the Hindu Kush range at 
an altitude of 3,300 metres (10,800 ft) 
described as the highest in the world. 
As a Peruvian | should like to correct 
this statement. On the central road 
that crosses my country through the An- 
des, linking the cities of Lima and 
Huancayo, there are three tunnels 
built at a slightly higher altitude than 
the one in Afghanistan. Vehicles 
have been using this road for a good 
many years. 
You may also be interested to know 
that the Central Railway of Peru (over 
50 years old) follows the same route 
and passes through a tunnel 2 kilome- 
tres (2,200 yds) long at an altitude of 
4,774 metres (15,650 ft).

CANOE-SHAPED COINS 
Sir, 
Among the illustrations accompany- 
ing the article on coins, (Ambassa- 
dors of Art and History by Otto Paul 
Wenger; Feb, 1965) was a reproduc- 
tion of four silver coins minted 
in Siam between 1851 and 1868 
(below). Around 1904 a relative 
presented me with four of these 
pieces of money representing different 
values of the tical, two cup-shaped 
silver pieces marked with the king's 
head and two bronze pieces represent- 
il

ing canoes of different lengths, but 
otherwise unmarked. According to 
what | was told canoe-shaped coins 
in silver had also existed, but were 
transformed into nugget shaped pieces, 
some of which still show traces 
of the original canoe designs. The 
nugget coins are of different sizes 
according to the lengths of the canoes 
and of course represent different val- 
ues.

REVOLUTION IN BOOKS 
 
Sir, 
| should like to contest Professor 
Escarpit’'s complacent remarks about 
the interpretation of literary master- 
pieces on radio and television (The 
Revolution Books, Sept. 1965). He 
says that the interpretation..may per- 
haps be a misconstruction of the work, 
but that it is certainly of the type 
of those that have been called creative 
misconstructions. 
In radio, the cinema, or television 
a creative misconstruction is such a 
rarity that it is almost without sig- 
nificance. | do not believe that such 
interpretations foster either the inter- 
ests of the original authors of these 
works, or the interests of mass cul- 
ture. To create a literary masterpiece 
sustained effort is required, and the 
portrayals which are frequently made 
in all these three mediums, rarely add 
to the original author's work, they 
do not create anything new, and more 
often than not they present such a 
superficial and desultory picture of the 
work that the original meaning is 
temporarily lost, let us hope not irre- 
vocably. 
| must also take up Professor 
Escarpit in what he says about 
reading the books of films. | have 
never seen a film which bore any real 
relation to the book from which it 
was adapted. One of the productions 
of Wuthering Heights in the early days 
of the cinema bore some ressem- 
blance to the original story, but | 
remember only one scene that carried 
any of the force of Emily Bronte's 
writing. | have seen “good” films 
which have been adapted from books, 
but whose merits rested rather In 
the camera work than in their making 
a true adaption of the story, that Is 
to say a small masterpiece had been 
made by using as a background, a 
story which had another meaning. 
And In these instances | think It is 
best if the films and the books con- 
cerned are regarded as belng In 
separate contexts. 
The worst enemy In all this Is 
television and | do not think it can 
be regarded as any kind of cultural 
medium until a great many improve- 
ments are made In the programmes. 
As to reading a book after seeing a 
film or a production of an adaption 
on television, | do not see how this 
can ever be more fruitful, because 
it Is difficult to detach oneself from 
the images seen on a screen, and 
the greatest works of literature are 
great not only by their wording but 
by the pictures they distil in one's 
mind.

WORLD OF BEAUTY 
 
Sir, 
It is very difficult to tell you how 
much | enjoyed the December issue 
of the Unesco Courier. Just be- 
cause | did enjoy it so much. 
Sometimes, beautiful things can 
strike you with a strange pain. The 
pictures of the sad, little figure on 
page 1 and the majestic Maya head on 
the last colour page did so. It may 
be very sentimental but | wept inside 
when | saw them. | was so surprised 
to see the beauty of this world after all 
this time that | was desperate be- 
cause of the “protest singers”, those 
youngsters who show you the world 
is bad. Of course it is, but you won't 
improve it when you are only bitter. 
| think the Courier is doing more 
positive work by showing people the 
magnificence of this world and the 
greatness of its cultures. | thank 
you for giving me the opportunity to 
learn that | can be happy with this 
world. | hope that more young 
people will agree with me.

Sir, 
The rise of Unesco Courler subscri- 
bers in Belgium to 20,000 last year

paid to Mr. Louis de Lannoy, general 
distributor of the Courier in Belgium, 
by the Belgian National Commission 
for Unesco. Mr. de Lannoy was pre- 
sented with a medal at a ceremony 
held during a meeting of the Belgian 
National Commission.

BURSTING WITH VITALITY 
 
Sir, 
| find the Unesco Courler a most 
fascinating magazine; | think It very 
fine to be able to read an Intelligently- 
written article dealing with things of 
vital interest. | wonder whether there 
wiil be any articles on Israel in the 
future? This is a country which, to me, 
appears to be bursting with vitality and 
new Ideas, and would obviously make 
wonderful reading.
