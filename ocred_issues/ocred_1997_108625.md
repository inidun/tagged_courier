HOW IDEAS TRAVEL 
by Bahgat Elnadi and Adel Rifaat 
In a recent Unesco Courierinterview (February 1997) the French 
historian and philosopher Alain de Libera talked about the 
extraordinary way in which the idea of the individual travelled   
across the centuries, continents and cultures. 
This idea, which originated in ancient Greece, was enriched 
much later in medieval Andalusia when it came into contact with 
an Arab concept of intellectual activity as a blend of abstract 
speculation and technical enquiry. This notion in its turn became 
the foundation of a revolutionary institution, the university, 
which spread throughout Europe and, between the Renaissance 
and the Enlightenment, gave birth to the modern concept of the 
human being. With the proclamation of the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights in 1948, an idea whose first glimmerings had 
appeared 3,000 years before became a federating principle of the 
human community. 
The present issue sheds light on some of the highways and 
byways along which ideas have travelled over the centuries. As 
well as tracing their geographical twists and turns it notes the 
increasing speed and range of the media—from caravans to 
computers, from clay tablets to fibre optics—whereby ideas have 
been communicated. It shows many-sided humanity gradually 
becoming aware of its unity with the emergence and 
transmission of ideas, principles and standards which deserve to 
be shared by all since they give everyone an opportunity for 
enrichment. 
This path towards universality, with all its ups and downs, has 
been above all else a road to freedom. [|

ow do ideas travel? It may seem 
incongruous to ask such a question 
in a magazine that is published in sev- 
eral dozen languages and is read all 
over the world. If we make no distinction 
between the notions of representation, belief 
and information, and regard “ideas” very 
broadly as all those products of a human mind 
that can be appropriated by another mind, 
then we sce that ideas do nothing but travel. It 
is no more surprising to find that there are 
practising Buddhists in California, that 
Euclid’s theorems are studied in China and 
that Latin American politics are debated in 
Australia than itis for a European to watch a 
Japanese-made television or wear cloth woven 
in Pakistan. 
Globalization, a notion which attempts 
to describe recent changes and which has itself 
travelled, designates the circulation of mater- 
ial goods as well as the intangible circuits of 
knowledge, patterns of thought and judge- 
ments. Current philosophical and political 
trends in the West strongly approve of the

creative potential of the free flow of ideas that 
technology seems to promote. True, there is 
debate about which views ought not be 
allowed to spread, whether control of the 
media does not sometimes lend itself to intel- 
lectual manipulation, and whether, metaphor- 
ically speaking, the bad money of stereotypes, 
disinformation and triviality does not drive 
out good. But the question of how ideas travel 
arouses relatively little interest, so completely 
does it seem to have been solved. 
This is to pass lightly over the fact that an 
idea is an invisible entity made visible by traces 
left by its passage and that it cannot change 
the world unless it travels. Except in the nec- 
essarily limited case of direct verbal commu- 
nication, obstacles and intermediaries come 
between the inception of an idea and the brain 
of the person who picks it up, somctimes 
much later or in a faraway place. 
To conquer time and space an idea must 
endure and it must move. It must be stored in 
amemory and be transported. Of course, dur- 
ing the performance of these operations, 
which may take a few fractions of a second 
on the Internet or centuries in the case of cer- 
tain religious beliefs—the idea changes. There 
may be many reasons for this change, includ- 
ing the vagaries of translation, distortions 
introduced by intermediaries or copyists, the 
format required for transmission, and other 
factors such as loss, censorship, interference 
and interpretation. Movement has changed 
the message. 
* Intellectual highways 
Ideas spread along routes which are changed by 
technological innovation. Printing increased 
the number of books and made the preserva- 
tion of ideas less dependent on the risks of 
copying, destruction, censorship ora broken 
journey. With the invention of the telegraph, 
messages for the first time travelled faster than 
people. On the airwaves words (and soon after, 
images) no longer travelled from place to place 
but covered whole territories, defying fron- 
tiers and walls. With telematics and the inter- 
connection of millions of computer memo- 
ries, recording, researching and transmitting 
data has become almost a single operation. 
During most of human history ideas were 
conveyed in small numbers and with diffi- 
culty, peddled with a human escort moving 
slowly in dangerous conditions. In short, 
along roads. For centuries there was no dif- 
ference between the movement of people and 
the movement of ideas and material goods. 
Consigned to manuscripts and illustrated by 
images or simply memorized by scholars or

Andrea Mantegna (1431-

religious believers, ideas travelled on horse- 
back or by camel, in the holds of ships or at 
walking pace. The range, the cadence of prop- 
agation and ultimately the success of the tech- 
nology, scientific conceptions and religious 
idcas we have inherited can be explained by all 
the factors that have stimulated or handi- 
capped travel by land or sea. 
UNESCO has rightly adopted the theme of 
routes to bracket together projects connected 
with cultural dialogue and cross-fertilization. 
These very ancient routes owe their names to 
a precious commodity that was transported 
along them: silk, iron, and even slaves. Other 
routes were determined less by trade than by 
the centre towards which they converged, e.g. 
Jerusalem, the holy city of the three monothe- 
istic religions, and al-Andalus, the province 
where three cultures lived in peace. 
The metaphor is unequivocal: by road comes 
all that is new, all that is exchanged and that 
changes us, all that transcends and transforms us;

identity an isolate can never succeed. Such con- 
tacts arc not, of course, necessarily pleasant or 
peaceful: invaders, persecutors, prisoners and 
deportees also arrive by road. But if movement 
distorts or alters ideas, the opposite is also true: 
conquerors assimilate the civilization of the 
defeated and the victims of slavery fertilize the 
cultures of the lands to which they are exiled. 
And so, just as there are memorable places 
which symbolize the common past of com- 
munities, there are also memorable routes: 
geographical itineraries where traces of phys- 
ical movement associated with mental change 
have survived. As well as the chronological 
mystery veiling the preservation from gener- 
ation to generation of beliefs, patterns of 
thought, knowledge, references and other 
forms of representation, there is the geo- 
graphical mystery associated with their move- 
ment, the movement of intangible things. The 
question of time is connected with that of 
geographical range. By following the tangible

traces of intellectual transmission or the routes 
taken by groups of travellers we can learn more 
about the spread of iron or paper technology, 
of astronomy or the figure zero, of Buddhism 
or Islam, a legend or a form of music. We can 
also find out about what happened to them 
during their journey. 
All thinking about the origin of cultures, 
their complexity, the dialogue between them, 
and cultural intermingling raises very precise 
questions. What kind of people travelled? 
How long did it take to travel and at what 
cost in terms of loss of human life? What lan- 
guages did they speak? What kind of archives 
did they keep? What letters did they write? 
What images did they carry? 
Tinker, tailor, soldier, sailor. . . 
Some of the greatest travellers were soldiers. 
War encourages technological invention and 
stimulates mechanisms of transmission. As 
the victors settle in new lands, some popula- 
tions are put to flight and others arc deported. 
War also causes the intermingling of peoples, 
beliefs and knowledge. The conqueror is some- 
times the first to understand the value of new 
information. Alexander the Great’s troops 
were accompanied by scientific expeditions. 
The Umayyad armies brought paper-makers 
back from Central Asia. Tamerlaine spared 
from massacre the scholars, writers and artists 
he wished to enroll in his service. If espionage 
is considered as warfare waged by other means, 
we are beholden to it for the spread of many 
secrets in the field of technology (the most 
famous being that of silk manufacture), car- 
tography and the sciences. 
The routes taken by ideas also dovetail with 
those taken by merchandise. The quest for 
products yiclding profits compensating for 
the time and risks involved in travel to dis- 
tant parts has always been one of the main rea- 
sons for scattering to the ends of the earth 
people who were interested in setting up net- 
works and organizing safe and frequent travel, 
and were in many cases adept at writing and 
curious about novelty. 
Merchants do not seek to change the world 
or to describe it, and what they say or see ts not 
always recorded or broadcast, but they spread 
ideas and information as a kind of by-product 
of their travels. More specifically trade has indi- 
rectly been one of the great vectors of religion. 
Getting together in foreign lands and practising 
their faith, traders have often made converts. 
Arab traders propagated the Quran farther 
afield than any of the Arab conquests of the 
first century of the Hegira. For reasons of sccu- 
rity it was often wise for the preacher’ itiner-

## [Page 9](https://demo.humlab.umu.se/courier/108625engo.pdf#page=9) 0

### 108588: On the road

ary to coincide with that taken by the merchant. 
It is safer to travel with caravans or merchant 
ships to cosmopolitan cities where the religious 
message will get a better reception from an open- 
minded public. This also explains why Bud- 
dhist monks also followed trade routes. 
The universalist religions are the third great 
medium whereby ideas travel, in this case with 
a deliberate purpose. Buddhism, Christianity 
and Islam define the corpus of canonical texts, 
the type of images and the kind of community 
whereby the preachers of the faith should 
spread salvation throughout the world. Such 
questions foment doctrinal disputes and even 
heresies. Should the Buddha’s body be 
depicted? Should the Prophet Muhammad be 
painted? Should icons be allowed? Should the 
Qur’an be translated or the Bible be propa- 
gated? Which Sutras belong to the accepted 
canon? Who should interpret the word of the 
Prophet? Should monks devote themselves 
to their own personal nirvana or should they 
be responsive to the concerns of laymen? To 
what extent should Jesuits adapt the evangel- 
ical message to Chinese culture? The form 
taken by a religious “idea” transposed thou- 
sands of kilometres results from the theoret- 
ical and practical answer to these questions. 
Ideas are imported as well as exported. A 
map of spiritual and intellectual poles of attrac- 
tion, starting with centres of pilgrimage, must 
be overlaid on that of the propagation and 
transformation of ideas. People from all over 
the world meet and mix in Jerusalem, Mecca 
and Santiago de Compostela. There, and on 
much-used routes invested with a strong sym- 
bolic meaning, important cultural changes 
come about. For centuries students converged 
on the universities of Taxila, Bologna and the 
Sorbonne. Sometimes the inclinations of a 
prince or caliph attracted talented individu- - 
als, gifted scientists or rare manuscripts. Those 
who journeyed tothe Library of Alexandria, 
the “house of wisdom” in Baghdad, and the 
court of Cordoba and the court of Roger II of 
Sicily, were not seckers after salvation or the 
fount of knowledge but bringers of ideas, 
philosophers, physicians, astronomers and 
translators who found material security and 
intellectual stimulation. 
What we see here is a complex set of phys- 
ical and mental barriers, topographical lines 
of force and human strategies which decides 
whether or not an idea crosses time and space, 
whether a piece of writing produced in a par- 
ticular place and culture has an impact at the 
other end of a continent. Was propagation 
deliberate or accidental, due to expansion or 
attraction? Did an idea travel from one place 
to another slowly or as the result of a histor- 
ical cataclysm? Was its journcy governed by 
geographical constants or by the fortunes of 
war, by the attraction of ancient crossroads 
of civilization or by the discovery of a new 
route? To understand where we have come 
from, we still have far to go in retracing the 
highways and byways of the past. ||

along the

highways of the 
medieval world 
he reproduction of the written word 
began long before printing with mov- 
able type was invented in the middle 
of the tenth century by the Chinese Pi 
Sheng. By the end of the third millennium of 
the pre-Christian cra religious and political 
documents were being copied on clay tablets 
in the Near and Middle East. These copies were 
made for the ruling castes, and it is unlikely 
that they circulated beyond the borders of 
the kingdoms where they were produced, for 
they were of interest to few people. Later, 
copies were also made of famous literary works 
such as the ancient Mesopotamian epic of Gil- 
gamesh, king of the city of Uruk. The story 
of Gilgamesh, who was deified and mythified 
after his death in 2650 B.C., is both a found- 
ing myth and the celebration of a hero. The 
cult of the hero was probably the reason why 
poems such as the Iliad and the Mahabharata 
were also copied several centuries later. 
"Production, collection 
and preservation 
Fourteen sets of fragments of the Gilgamesh 
Epic have been found between present-day 
Turkey and Iraq. While language barriers do 
not seem to have been real obstacles to the cir- 
culation of manuscripts, no proof has sur-

tural frontiers. For instance, although Greek 
was spoken throughout the Mediterranean 
basin by the fourth century A.D., not a sin- 
gle fragment of the /liad has been found cither 
in Palestine, Carthage or in major centres on 
the Silk Route. The transport of a long piece 
of writing recorded on clay tablets must have 
been a laborious affair (the complete 3,000- 
line version of the Gilgamesh epic would have 
weighed several dozen kg). Even so, the spread 
of papyrus and parchment, which consider- 
ably lightened this burden (a long poem could 
have been recorded on a few volumina or 
scrolls), only seems to have had a slight impact 
on the communication of ideas and cultural 
transfer. 
Early in the first millennium of the Chris- 
tian era, literacy rates were still minimal in 
most of the world. Written texts were 
intended to be read in public, and this was 
not to everyone’s taste. In the second century, 
for example, the Latin poet Juvenal com- 
plained that he had had to listen to readings of 
many an indigestible tragedy. 
Manuscripts were highly prized by certain 
princes, who wished to accumulate as much 
learning—a magical commodity—as possible 
but were not very interested in transmitting it. 
In the fourth century B.C. in Alexandria cus- 
toms officials seized all the books they found 
on ships and had copies of them made for

uscrs were physicians looking for exotic reme- 
dies, navigators secking maritime informa- 
tion, and minor poets on the lookout for 
pieces of obscure knowledge or material to 
plagiarize. 
The first conclusion to be drawn is that 
the spread of culture via manuscripts was neg- 
ligible until very late in Antiquity. 
© Approval, condemnation 
and destruction 
Cultural barriers became slightly more per- 
meable with the coming of commercial pub- 
lishing in the strict sense, which was first prac- 
tised in Rome around the first century B.C. 
Authors gave copyists the original version of 
a piece of work so that several copies could be 
made and offered to prospective buyers. These 
copics on parchment were relatively costly, 
and the copyist paid the author royalties based 
on the number of copies sold or on his esti- 
mate of the value of the work. The pages of 
parchment were covered with writing on both 
sides and then sewn together to form what is 
now called a codex, a book that was easy to 
carry. 
Copies of works by Aristotle began to be 
found in Baghdad (where a Greek colony 
prospered) and those of Tacitus in Britain. 
But it would be an exaggeration to think that 
this form of publishing had inaugurated the 
free flow of ideas. The excesses of Imperial 
Rome gave rise to many pamphlets that were 
not to the liking of the emperors, and copy- 
ists who reproduced impertinent documents 
did so at their own risk. The censor’s hand 
became particularly heavy after the reign of 
Constantine the Great. 
In the fifth century almost all the works of 
the third-century philosopher Porphyry, 
whose writings were likely “to rouse God’s 
anger”, were destroyed. The works of the first- 
century historians Seneca the Rhetorician, 
Servilius Nontanus, Cluvius Rufus, Fabius 
Rusticus, Aufidius Bassus and nearly all those 
of Velleius Paterculus, have also alarmingly 
disappeared. There are excellent reasons to 
believe that a large number of copies of the 
work of Heraclitus, one of the greatest 
thinkers of ancient Greece and perhaps of all 
time, were in circulation until the second or 
third centuries. All that has survived of them, 
less than five pages of large print, has come 
down to us indirectly in the form of quota- 
tions from authors in possession of complete 
copics of a work that was probably also 
destroyed.

monks soon became the only people licenced 
to copy pieces of writing. They took advantage 
of the situation and, following their superiors’ 
injunctions, obeyed their religious convie- 
tions. A monk named Xiphilin wrote, and of 
course abridged, the only version that has 
come down to us of Dio Cassius’s history of 
Rome, and Flavius Joscphus’s The Antiquities - 
of the Jews was “reworked” with the inter- 
polation of a passage on Jesus. 
The second conclusion is that the more 
ideas a work contained the smaller the likeli- 
hood that it would circulate untouched. 
* Manipulation, distortion 
and invention 
An additional peril to those of distortion and 
censorship was that of manipulation by “well 
intentioned” copyists and the absurd mix- 
ups due to the authors themselves. In the 
reports despatched by Megasthenes, the Greek 
ambassador to the court of Candragupta Mau- 
rya in the fourth century B.C, it is impossi- 
ble to distinguish what is really Hindu from 
what merely reflects the author's determination 
to “Hellenize” his observations, as when he 
purports to identify Dionysus and Hercules 
among the Hindu gods.

### 108591: Manuscripts on the move

Very few authors, even including the great- 
est writers of Antiquity, escaped the indig- 
nity of forgery. In those days people did not 
know how to distinguish the authentic from 
the false on the basis of style, writing or the 
material used. Even today we do not know 
for sure which texts were authentically and 
entirely written by Plato, although some such 
as the Second Alcibiades, the Theages and the 
Axiochos arc unanimously recognized to be 
fakes. The First Alcibiades itself, with the sur- 
prising interruption by Zarathustra, is “dubi- 
ous”. It 1s now accepted that Aristotle never 
wrote the book on the Wise Men that was 
long attributed to him. 
The Italian historian Arnaldo Momigliano 
believed that most Greek and Latin texts pur- 
porting to be translations of oriental originals 
dealing with such figures as Zarathustra, Thoth 
and Ilystaspe are pure fabrications. Despite their 
immense talents, the Greeks were not gifted 
linguists. They garbled Persian and made a hash 
of Hebrew, and all Egyptologists know that the 
Greek texts purporting to be reproductions 
of originals of the cult of Isis are embellish- 
ments that bear little relationship to the orig- 
inal. Plotinus asked Porphyry to unmask the 
forger who had produced an Apocalypse of 
Zarathustra, and as early as the third century 
B.C., clever swindlers tried to sell “Aristotle’s 
real library” to Ptolemy II Euregetes. 
It was just as true in the pastas it is today 
that the most far-fetched stories—the ones 
that appealed to the simple—stood the best 
chance of survival. Herodotus (circa 480-425 
B.C.) was taken in by the confabulations of

dence to the writings of the man Cicero had 
dubbed “the father of history”, Alexander the 
Great believed that the Nile was a tributary 
of the Indus. Seventeen centuries later Marco 
Polo gave a description of China in his Book 
of Travels that was invented from start to fin- 
ish and contained no mention of the existence 
of paper, tea, the Great Wall, printing, bank- 
notes, ice-cream, none of which were known 
in the West. Yet this far-fetched account 
enjoyed a huge success. Of the versions pro- 
duced atthe time 143 have survived, and there 
must have been hundreds morc! 
The ideas and information that travelled 
with manuscripts were clearly often at second 
or even third hand. Accounts of the Far or Mid- 
dle East that reached the Greeks were often 
confabulations, and so were many of the man- 
uscripts they wrote about them. More recently, 
manuscripts about the New World—especially 
Spanish and Portuguese—wereaalso largely unre- 
liable, and the continent they described was 
presented to Europeans as a land of fantasy. 
The third conclusion to be drawn is that 
false ideas circulate far more easily than true 
ones. 
* Translation, utilization, 
rediscovery 
The Western tradition which holds that “the 
Arabs” saved the Greek cultural heritage 
should not be accepted without qualification, 
truc though itis that Arabs translated almost 
all Aristotle and Plato, and Neo-Platonists 
like Plotinus, Ptolemy and Euclid. It does 
mean, however, that manuscripts of these texts 
already existed. Furthermore, the term “Arab” 
is very loosely used in this context since the 
translators concerned included Turks, Per- 
sians, Mesopotamians from Baghdad, Jews 
and converted Christians. Nor do the transla- 
tions scem always to have been masterpieces of 
precision; some of the “free” interpretations 
they contain are bewildering. The ideas they 
conveyed to readers could often be quite dif- 
ferent from those in the original texts. 
The greatest paradox is that manuscripts 
circulated when the Islamic empires were at the 
height of their power and in a totally different 
way from that which is generally accepted. It 
was through Latin and Hebrew translations of 
Averroés’s commentaries on Aristotle that 
many Western Christian thinkers, including 
Roger Bacon and Duns Scotus, first came to 
know about Aristotle’s ideas. Averroism nour- 
ished Christian philosophy and theology until 
Thomas Aquinas launched his great diatribe 
against the Parisian Averroists in 1274.

### 108591: Manuscripts on the move

The most famous manuscripts in the mod- 
crn world are the Dead Sea Scrolls. One of 
their special features is that they never reached 
their destination. Discovered by chance in the 
twentieth century, some twenty-two centuries 
after they were written, they raise a question 
whichis seldom mentioned but is nevertheless 
central to the transmission of ideas via manu- 
scripts: who were they intended for? Were 
these monks from Qumran on the shore of 
the Dead Sea, known as “Essences”, who inde- 
fatigably covered parchment rolls with copies 
(often considerably modified) of whole books 
of the Old Testament, working for them- 
sclves, or were their copies meant for other 
communities? And if so, which ones? What 
originals did they use? It is very likely that 
other manuscripts of the same type are await- 
ing discovery—Tlike the fragments discovered 
in 1884 in Jerusalem which were rejected as 
fakes through the obstinacy of a French 
palacographer and now seem to have been lost 
forever. 
Incidentally, one might also wonder what 
happened to the hand-written scrolls that 
Buddhist monks carried for centuries along 
the Silk Route. There were hundreds of these 
monks, and each one travelled with about fif- 
teen scrolls as his sole luggage. This adds up to 
alarge number of lost scrolls... .. 
A fourth conclusion may be drawn, 
namely that manuscripts circulated more eas- 
ily between cultures that were politically close 
and were preserved with greater security in 
those circumstances. 
The men of letters of the young Islamic 
empire were interested in the Greek and Latin 
learning which had fostered the Byzantine 
empire they were in the process of devouring, 
and educated Christians were interested in the 
learning of the Muslims who were threatening 
them. And if we still have Latin rather than 
Greek writings about the Celts, we should 
probably be grateful to imperial administra- 
tors who were sufficiently interested in the 
description of foreign peoples to have their 
manuscripts copied in large numbers, thereby 
increasing their chances of survival. 
An appendix may be added to the fourth 
conclusion: manuscripts have a far better 
chance of surviving if they serve political and 
ideological ends. 
Printing, diffusion 
and prohibition 
Printing scems to have decisively changed the 
situation for manuscripts. By producing hun- 
dreds of copies of a text, the printing press 
made it more likely that at [east a few would 
survive. In principle this was true except that 
censorship of manuscripts intensified for an

obvious reason, to stop them reaching the 
printer. Having to destroy all the printed 
copies and making possession of any surviv- 
ing copies a crime made the task of the thought 
police much morc complicated. 
Onc of the most striking examples of this 
kind of censorship is to be seen in the tribu- 
lations of a manuscript written in the seven- 
teenth century, which was copied by hand and 
circulated throughout Europe until 1690 
before being published anonymously in 1719, 
probably in Holland. This printed edition 
was seized and destroyed. Only three copies 
have survived and are today conserved at the 
universities of Leyden, Gottingen and Cornell 
respectively. A replica was published in 1994 in 
Italy by Einaudi, 275 years later. This work 
by an unknown author, the Treatise of the 
Three Impostors, or the Mind of Mr. Spinoza, 
boldly claimed that the three monotheistic 
religions were of human, not divine, inspira- 
tion. Many other manuscripts, old and new, 
arc still sleeping in secret archives and inacces- 
sible libraries. 
I will end this article with a fifth conclu- 
sion, namely that the most threatened manu- 
scripts are those that are richest in ideas. WM

t would be a mistake to think that the 
England of Samuel Johnson, the France 
of Diderot and the Germany of Goethe 
formed part of a media-free civilization. 
Their world buzzed with a communication 
network every bit as dense as ours. It was 
merely different—so different that most of 
its media have been forgotten. Take the case 
of cighteenth-century Paris. Who today can 
even recognize the names of the genres and 
modes of its communication system: mau- 
  
vais propos (saucy gossip), bruit public (pub- 
lic rumour), on-dit (rumour), pasquinade 
(scurrilous pamphlet), canard (tall story), 
feuille volante (scandal sheet), factum (squib), 
libelle (lampoon) and chronique scandalense 
(muck-raking history)? 
There were so many modes of communi- 
cation, and they intersected and overlapped 
so intensively, that one can hardly picture their 
operation. Let me give as an example an ance- 
dote which might be likened to a modern

“news flash”. It was incorporated in a best- 
selling biography of Mme. Du Barry, the mis- 
tress of Louis XV; 
“There is a report, carefully spread about 
by some courtiers, which proves that Mme 
du Barry has not lost any favour or familiar- 
ity with the king, as some had suspected. His 
Majesty likes to brew his own coffee and, by 
means of this innocent amusement, to get 
some relief from the heavy burdens of gov- 
ernment. A few days ago, the coffee pot began 
to boil over while His Majesty was distracted 
by something else. ‘Hey, France!” called out 
the beautiful favourite, ‘Look out! Your cof- 
fee’s going to pot!” Weare told that ‘France’ is 
the familiar expression utilized by this lady in 
the intimacy of the petits appartements. The 
details should newer circulate outside of them, 
but they escape, nonetheless, thanks to the 
malignity of the courtiers.” 
The anecdote is trivial in itself, but it illus- 
trates the way a news item moved through 
various media, reaching an ever-wider public. 
In this case, it went through four phases: it 
began as a mauvais propos, or insider gossip 
at court. Then it took the form of a bruit pub- 
lic, or general rumour, in Paris, Next it was

consigned to writing in a manuscript news 
sheet, or gazette a la main. And finally it fig- 
ured as an episode in a libelle, that is, a printed 
book which belonged to a genre of scandalous 
and highly illegal political literature. 
© Forbidden best-sellers 
In my own research, I have tried to identify the 
forbidden books that were most in demand 
during the twenty years before the French 
Revolution. By studying orders of book- 
scllers and other sources, I have come up with 
arctrospective best-seller list, the top fifteen of 
the 720 works that composed the highly pop- 
ular corpus of literature which circulated 
beyond the reach of the censors and the police. 
The list contains some well-known works by 
famous writers like Voltaire, the Abbé Raynal 
and the Baron d’Holbach. But five of the top 
fifteen best-sellers were libelles like Anecdotes 
sur Mme la comtesse Du Barry, quoted above, 
or chronigues scandaleuses, a variety of muck- 
raking contemporary history. Although they 
reached readers in every corner of the king- 
dom, all five have been completely forgotten, 
like their authors, who have disappeared from 
the history of literature. 
How can we assess the impact of these 
books on public opinion? 
Thanks to advances in the new discipline 
known as the history of the book, we have a

pretty good idea of how the printed word 
became a force in European history; but we 
know very little about oral modes of com- 
munication. They could have been more 
important than the print media in societies 
with a high rate of illiteracy, but their effec- 
tiveness is difficult to gauge because the spo- 
ken word generally vanished into the air. 
In the case of eighteenth-century Paris, how- 
ever, oral communication about public affairs 
was followed carefully by the police, who 
posted spies in cafés, taverns, public gardens 
and all the nerve centres for the spread of infor- 
mation. Spy reports cannot be taken literally, of 
course, but they reveal a great deal about the 
general tone and the modes of transmission in 
oral communication. By way of illustration, 
will discuss two modes: gossip and songs. 
A hotbed of gossip 
Gossip provided the most important source 
of news for Parisians under the Old Regime, 
because newspapers did not exist. True, there 
were many periodicals, and some of them con- 
tained articles about court ceremonies and for- 
eign affairs. But papers with news in them, 
news as we know it—information about 
power struggles and personalities in the pub- 
lic sphere—did not appear until the press was 
freed of censorship in 1789. 
If you wanted to know what was happen- 
ing in the corridors of power before 1789, you 
used your feet and your ears. You went to cer- 
tain cafés, certain benches in the Luxembourg 
Gardens, a certain terrace in the Tuileries Gar- 
dens or the Tree of Cracow; and you listened to 
the nouwvellistes de bouche or newsmongers 
who gathered at those centres of gossip. The 
Tree of Cracow was an actual tree in the garden

» of the Palais-Royal, which served as a meeting 
place for those who wanted to know who was 
winning in the War of the Polish Succession 
from 1733 to 1735. During the next decades, it 
became such an important institution that 
ambassadors sent their servants to pick up news 
items—or to plant them, for gossip became 
public opinion and public opinion became a 
force to be reckoned with under Louis XV. 
The regime acknowledged this new form of 
power by placing spies wherever bruits publics 
(public rumour) or manvais propos (bad talk) 
were likely to break out. I have found spy 
reports on conversations in forty cafés around 
1730. Some are even written in dialogue: 
“At the Café de Foy someone said that the 
king had taken a mistress, that she was named 
Gontaut, and that she was a beautiful woman, 
the nicce of the Duc de Noailles and the 
Comtesse de Toulouse. Others said, ‘If so, then 
there could be some big changes.” And another 
replied, “True, a rumour is spreading, but I find 
it hard to believe, since the Cardinal de Fleury 
is in charge. I don’t think the king has any incli- 
nation in that direction, because he has always 
been kept away from women.” ‘Nevertheless,’ 
someone else said, ‘it wouldn’t be the greatest

evil if he had a mistress.” “Well, messicurs,’ 
another added, ‘it may not be a passing fancy, 
and a first love could raise some danger on the 
sexual side and could cause more harm than 
good. It would be far more desirable if he liked 
hunting better than that kind of thing.” ” 
As always, the royal sex life provided 
plenty of material for gossip, but the reports 
indicate that the talk tended to be friendly. In 
1729, when the queen was about to give birth, 
the cafés rang with jubilation: 
“Truly, everyones delighted, because they 
all hope greatly to have a dauphin. . .. Onc of 
them said, ‘Parbleu, messieurs, if God graces 
us with a dauphin, you will see Paris and the 
whole river aflame [with fircworks in celebra- 
tion].” Everyone is praying for that.” ~ 
Twenty years later, the tone had changed 
completely: 
“In the shop of the wigmaker Gaujoux, 
this individual [Jules Alexis Bernard] read 
aloud. ..anattack on the king in which it was 
said that His Majesty let himself be governed by 
ignorant and incompetent ministers and had 
made a shameful, dishonourable peace [the 
Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, 1748], which gave 
up all the fortresses that had been captured... 
that the king, by his affair with the three sisters, 
scandalized his people and would bring down 
all sorts of misfortune on himself if he did 
not change his ways; that His Majesty scorned 
the queen and was an adulterer; that he had 
not confessed for Easter communion and 
would bring down the curse of God upon 
the kingdom and that France would be over- 
whelmed with disasters. . .. He promised Sicur 
Duzemard that he would show him the book 
entitled The Three Sisters.” 
Seditions songs 
During the twenty years that separate those 
reports, a great deal had happened to damage 
the Parisians’ fondness for their king, and a great 
deal more would happen between 1750 and 1789. 
In his manuscript memoirs, the head of the Paris 
police, Jean-Charles-Pierre Lenoir, wrote that 
he had to pay the crowd to shout “Vivelareine!” 
when Marie-Antoinette, Louis XVI's queen, 
rode through the streets in the 1780s, but his 
cfforts produced “only some scattered applause, 
which cveryone knew to be bought”. Tt seems 
clear that public opinion had shifted and that the 
shift had involved an interpenetration of writ- 
ten and oral modes of communication. 
Parisians did not merely talk; they also 
sang. Songs were mnemonic devices and pow- 
erful vehicles for spreading messages, like com- 
inercial jingles today. People commonly com-

poscd verse about current events and set it to 
popular tunes, such as “The Bear Went Over 
the Mountain” (“Malbrough s’en va-t-en 
guerre” in French). The greatest songster of 
the century, Charles Simon Favart, learned to 
put words to tunes while rhythmically knead- 
ing dough in his father’s bakery. Many oth- 
crs—Collé, Gallet, Panard, Vadé, Taconnet, 
Fromaget, Fagan—also came from the artisan 
classes. Their songs penetrated workshops and 
taverns throughout the city, and street singers 
accompanied by hurdy-gurdies relayed them 
from corner to corner. Paris was suffused with 
songs, many of them political. As the saying 
went, government in France was “an absolute 
monarchy tempered by songs”. 
When a hit song attacked the king and his 
ministers, it was a serious affair. In 1749 the 
police received an order to capture the author 
of a song about the fall of the first Maurepas 
ministry. They had only one clue: it began 
with the words, “People once so proud, now 
so servile. ...” But that was enough for them 
to sct their spies to work in taverns and cafés; 
and before long onc of their agents heard the 
verse declaimed by a medical student named 
Francois Bonis. 
He was hustled off to the Bastille and asked 
where he had got the verse. He had copied it, 
he said, from a sheet of paper that was passed 
to him by a priest in the hospital. The priest 
was arrested and said he had got it from 
another priest, who in turn was arrested and 
attributed it to a law student, who said it was 
dictated to him in class by a professor, who 
claimed he had heard it from a witmacafé. .. 
and so on, unti} the police had filled the Bastille 
with fourteen suspects. 
A group of “incredibles” 
meet in a Paris café. During 
the early days of the Directory 
(1795-1799) the incredibles 
were fashionable young 
royalists noted for their 
mannered elegance. Engraving

They never found the original author. In 
fact there may have been no distinct author 
at all, because it was a case of collective cre- 
ativity: people changed phrases and added 
verses as songs made the rounds. And while the 
police tried to follow the song to its origin, 
they discovered that its path crossed those of 
six other songs, cach more seditious than the 
last and cach with its own chain of transmis- 
sion. Their words were memorized, declaimed, 
read and sung. They circulated on scraps of 
paper hidden in pockets and sleeves, and they 
were printed in several chronigues scandaleuses, 
which spread them to the farthest corners of 
the kingdom. 
Two lessons stand out from the cases I have 
mentioned. 
First, it makes no sense to separate elite 
“print culture” from oral “popular culture”, 
because messages spread through different 
modes of communication, which intersected 
and overlapped among all segments of the 
population. The media were mixed; they 
reached a mixed audience, and so the history of 
books should be studied as one ingredient in 
the general history of communication. 
Second, best-sellers, gossip and songs may 
not provide an accurate version of events, but 
they show how events appeared in the domi- 
nant media of the time. In the case of cigh- 
teenth-century France, I would go so far as 
to claim they constituted a coherent account 
of contemporary history, the only one, in 
fact, that was available to cighteenth-century 
Frenchmen, because publications about the 
recent past and current events were not allowed 
to circulate in the legal book trade. Illegally 
circulated publications, in the form of libelles 
and chronigues scandaleuses, reduced the story 
of public affairs during the reign of Louis XV 
to a kind of folklore organized around two 
master themes: despotism and decadence. 
We know now that the folklore version of 
the Old Regime was wrong. Mme Du Barry 
had indeed spent some tine as a prostitute 
before her promotion to the royal bed, as the 
libelles claimed, but Louis XV was no despot. 
And when the Bastille was stormed on 14 July 
1789, it contained only seven prisoners, most 
of them incarcerated for immoral behaviour at 
the request of their families. But the French 
saw the Bastille as the embodiment of despo- 
tism. They experienced the events of the 1780s 
as variations on the themes that permeated 
their gossip, songs and books. They perceived 
the collapse of the Old Regime from the per- 
spective of a political folklore that had been 
spread far and wide by the dominant media of 
their time. ||

‘Words have no legs, 
yet they walk’ 
YOUSSOUF TATA CISSE 
talks to Jasmina Sopova 
Africa’s continent-wide lines of communication 
based on respect for the spoken word 
THE UNESCO (our NH |UNE 1997 
HM In traditional African societies 
knowledge was transmitted orally. Did 
this restrict the spread of ideas? 
Youssouf Tata Cissé: Not at all. In Africa 
tdeas travelled with people. Human migra- 
tions, initiatory journeys, conquests and trade 
routes made pathways along which ideas criss- 
crossed the continent. 
Since ancient times Africans have moved 
about and carried with them knowledge, tech- 
nology, beliefs, traditions and languages. What 
other explanation can there be for the fact that 
one finds the same ideograms tattood on the 
bodies of Moroccan women and depicted in 
the statuary of the Bambara and Malinke pco- 
ples of west Africa? How can you explain the 
existence of the same place names, the same 
divinities, the same rites and the same musical 
instruments in the Nile Valley and in west 
Africa? Comparative studies on the affinities 
between pharaonic Egyptian and certain 
African languages by the noted Sencgalesc 
writer and Egyptologist Cheikh Anta Diop, 
and his rescarch on the migrations of peoples, 
based on purcly linguistic data, say a lot about 
this flow of ideas in Africa. 
The Nile Valley is often mentioned in the 
oral traditions of the Soninke and Malinke, 
who regard it as the original homeland of their 
ancestors. Intrigued by this, I carried out 
research into place names and cthnic names 
~~ oh Lo 
rd

po 
and found nearly 400 names in Egypt, Sudan 
and Ethiopia that also existed in west Africa. 
Hereare afew examples: El Kantara in Egypt, 
and Kantara, a Soninke clan name and fore- 
name; Segala, the name of an island in the Red 
Sea and of several villages in Mali and Céte 
d’Ivoire; Dakar in Ethiopia and Dakar, the 
capital of Senegal. Morcover the oldest divini- 
tics of Pharaonic Egypt—Bes, the oryx, the 
vulture, the ibis, the falcon and the sphinx— 
arc still celebrated in Mali where they have 
their masks and statuettes. 
The absence of writing was no obstacle to 
the spread of knowledge. The cult of the spo- 
ken word in Africa meant that speech was an 
important channel for the communication of 
knowledge and ideas. That 1s why Mali’s Bam- 
bara people say, “words have no legs, yet they 
walk.” Nothing can stop them.

WM What role have initiatory journeys 
played in the spread of ideas? 
Y. T. C.: Initiation is much more than a hand- 
ful of “exotic” rites. It is a general education 
that begins at six years of age and ends at 
around thirty-three. Traditionally, it was car- 
ried out by six societies to which initiates 
belonged one after the other, depending on 
their age and the knowledge they had acquired. 
They learned everything: history, the origins 
of peoples, languages, mathematics, technol- 
ogy, morality and the secrets of nature and 
the universe. During this process of learning 
about life, young initiates were supposed to 
travel, and they went to foreign lands with 
their teachers, musicians, dancers and crafts- 
men. They lodged with local people and dis- 
covered new ways of life, new crafts and new 
languages. In turn, they put on shows in which

they demonstrated their own knowledge. 
Enrichment was mutual. Only when they had 
learned three languages did they return home. 
This indicates the importance attached to 
knowledge and respect for others. Nowadays 
these initiatory journeys occur during the dry 
season, but in the past they lasted seven years. 
HB What influence was exercised by the 
griots (story-tellers and masters of 
ceremonies) and the donikeba 
(teachers)? 
Y. T. C.: Doni in Bambara means “knowledge”, 
and the donikeba are “makers of knowledge”. 
We also have doma, or “knowers”, and soma, 
or “priests”. These masters have an extraordi- 
nary memory, and arc the guardians and prop- 
agators of tradition. In the past their social 
status was so high that they enjoyed diplo- 
matic immunity in wartime. 
Masters of the spoken word that they were, 
griots acted as negotiators and ambassadors in 
times of conflict, as did smiths, wood-cutters 
and hunters, who were reputed for their man- 
ual dexterity and their knowledge. As musi- 
cians, poets, genealogists and historians, they 
also played a considerable role in the spread of 
ideas. Through a visualization technique 
enabling them to put a face to every name, these 
“troubadours” knew by heart the complete 
genealogy of the family to which they were 
attached, as well as the great deeds performed by 
its ancestors. Some knew, and still know, the 
history of a whole ethnic group or of an entire 
kingdom. The history of Mali has been 
recorded in verse and set to music. For a month 
every year the griots of Kela, for example, recite 
itall through the nights of Thursday to Friday, 
Saturday to Sunday and Sunday to Monday, 
100 hours in all. 
Griots are also great travellers. They have to 
visit various masters for periods of training 
during which they increase their knowledge 
while also spreading it. 
To give you some idea of the distances they 
can cover, let me cite a relatively recent exam- 
ple. In 1946, at the end of the Second World 
War, griots left Bamako and went on foot via 
Niamey to Agadez in Niger—in other words 
a distance of 4,000 kilometres—to sing the 
praises of the RDA (the Rassemblement 
Démocratique Africain, a west African polit- 
ical movement), the triumph of General de 
Gaulle, the abolition of forced labour, and 
the forty-four-hour working week. ... Inthis »

way political ideas spread through songs sung 
by illiterate griots. 
HM You also mentioned that ideas spread 
as a result of conquest. 
Y. T. C.: Yes, because when warriors set out 
to conquer new territory, they were accom- 
panied by religious leaders, masters of initia- 
tion, griots and smiths. All the corporations 
of craftsmen—the main repositories of tradi- 
tion—werc among their retinue. They took 
with them their raiment, ornaments and jew- 
elry. They exchanged their knowledge with 
that of the peoples whose land they occupied. 
New civilizations were born as the result of 
these encounters. 
In peacetime ideas circulated as a result of 
the formal relations between different cultural 
and religious communities. Take the case of 
Mansa Musa I, who ruled the Mali empire 
between 1307 and 1337. It is said that when he 
made the pilgrimage to Mccca his escort con- 
sisted of 60,000 porters, 10,000 subjects and 
500 servants. His wealth and generosity dur- 
ing his stay in Cairo were noted not only by the 
Egyptians butalso by Italians, Portuguese and 
THE UNESCO Courier B [UNE 1997 
North Africans. In this way new doors were 
opened for trade and cultural exchanges. 
HM How did Islam reach Mali and what 
contribution has it made? 
Y. T. C.: Mali is among the foremost Islamic 
countries of west Africa. According to Soninke 
oral tradition Islam was introduced around 
666 by the envoys of Ocba Ben Nafi, a leading 
figure in the expansion of Islam in Egypt and 
North Africa. After laying the foundations 
of the al-Qayrawan mosque in Tunisia, he is 
said to have sent a delegation to the capital of 
Wagadu (present-day Ghana) to ask Kaya 
Maghan, the emperor, to convert to Islam. 
The emperor rejected the proposal, but 
allowed his subjects, especially those doing 
business with Turkey (trade in diamonds, 
cunuchs and slaves) to embrace the new reli- 
gion. The first converts were the Soninke. 
The Qur’an was immediately translated, 
with 2 commentary, first into Soninke then 
into the country’s other languages, so that 
people could learn to recite the Qur’an by 
heart and absorb Islamic dogma without 
knowing Arabic. This is still done today. In 
D uring a ceremony in the 
forest near Abidjan (Cote 
d'Ivoire) a message is sent by 
drum to announce the arrival 
of masked dancers.

other words, Islam has been integrated into 
traditional societies without destroying tra- 
ditional cultures and languages. 
Traditional art was also incorporated into 
embryonic Islamic architecture. Architects 
adapted old patterns of worship to the new 
religion and built mosques in a unique style 
known as “Sudanese”, using banco—compacted 
carth reinforced with an exposed timber frame- 
work. Onc of the oldest mosques is in 
Tombouctou. It was designed by an architect 
named Ishaq el-Tuwedjin, whom Mansa Musa 
had met in Cairo during his pilgrimage to Mecca. 
The mosque at Djenné is by far the most beau- 
tiful. Built in 1907 and patterned on the carly 
religious buildings of the Ghana empire, it too 
is typical of the Sudanese style widespread in 
eastern Senegal, Ghana and Nigeria—all the 
countries visited by the Sudanese builders. 
The egg-shaped dome added to the top of 
minarcts ts another example of Sudanese syn- 
cretism. Bambara cosmogony holds that the 
first thing the Supreme Being created was a 
wondrous egg, Fan, consisting of nine com- 
partments into which He inserted the nine 
basic states of existence. And so the egg-shaped 
dome 1s a symbol of the traditional religion 
grafted onto a Muslim place of worship. 
The pattern marked on the ground in hop- 
scotch, a game played by children the world 
over, 1s also divided into nine sections. I think 
that the role of games in the transfer of ideas 
should not be neglected, not only in Africa but 
worldwide. And games mean music and song. 
To get back to architecture, I would add that 
during the colonial period a fusion took place 
between the traditional style and the European 
style, leading to what has been called “colonial 
architecture”. It is mainly found in administra- 
tive buildings, markets and post offices in Mali, 
Mauritania, Burkina Faso and Niger. 
HM Did colonization open new routes for 
the movement of ideas in Africa? 
Y. T. C.: Colonization brought a break in con- 
tinuity. All aspects of traditional society were 
disrupted. The setting up of French schools 
and the use of French as the official language 
disturbed the system of traditional teaching. 
Only the Qur’anic schools continued to func- 
tion. All the traditional structures were shat- 
tered. Religious leaders became suspect. Reli- 
gious rites and objects were labelled as satanic. 
The established channels for transmitting 
knowledge and ideas were blocked. The use of

so-called “talking” or “messenger” drums was 
strictly forbidden. 
NH Why? 
Y. T. C.: Because the colonizers realized that 
the beating of drums signalled that an upris- 
ing was afoot. The language of the drums 
announced the arrival of the colonial army. A 
message could travel 500 kilometres in a single 
night. In 1916, for example, during the Bobo 
uprising in Mali, the drums carried the message 
as far as Burkina. They said, “Warrior, take up 
your quiver, don’t forget your bow; even 
struck down by the enemy, we must fight.” 
HM Who could understand these messages? 
Y. T. C.: Everyone. All initiates understand 
the language of the drums. Youth societies, 
initiatory societies, the griots—they all have 
their drums and other musical instruments. 
Obviously therearesecret codes that only the 
initiates know. They are the equivalent of mil- 
itary secrets in modern socictics. 
In 1965, when I arrived ina Senufo village in 
Mali, a rapid musical portrait was made of me, 
so that the drums and balafons could announce 
my arrival. Apparently they described my phys- 
ical and moral character. It was an impressive 
performance. ||

BY SALAH GUEMRICHE A hard look at the impact of satellite 
communication on the South 
the Canadian sociologist Marshall McLuhan, 
the same as that which today provides the ide- 
ological basis of “globalization”? 
In the 1980s a broad consensus crystallized 
around the bold ideas advanced in France by 
Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber, who was con- 
vinced that technology was going to “take us 
from the neolithic age to the post-industrial 
age”. In the post-independence ferment the 
developing countries systematically opted for 
massive technological investment in institu- 
tional communications, and decision-makers 
in the West believed that the “working masses” 
could be made technology-minded by decree, 
like people treated in a vaccination campaign.

television, traditional communication by 
word of mouth was pilloried as a symptom of 
underdevelopment and scornfully treated by 
the written press. The fact is that this versatile, 
time-honoured way of spreading informa- 
tion spells danger to any established order. 
Immune to the cold rationalism of media sys- 
tems, the spoken word is a versatile and 
uncheckable way of transmitting subversive 
ideas. It is also a means whereby society can 
restructure itself. 
In societies with an oral tradition, com- 
munication based on the primacy of words 
over all other forms of representation is one of 
the basic ingredients of popular culture. Radio 
benefitted from this status and gradually 
became accepted because the spoken word 
broadcast by radio nurtures the oral tradi- 
tion—when it does not compete with it— 
rather than denying or trivializing it. But the 
basic effect of television is to trivialize. This 
inclines us to believe that, unlike the televi- 
sion viewers of the industrialized societies 
studied by McLuhan, viewers who arc heirs to 
an oral tradition will be unsatisfied rather than 
fascinated by the TV image. They will miss 
the way in which the spoken word alone was 
once used to conjure up form, image and 
colour. The televised image dispossesses the 
spoken word of its descriptive powers. 
Today every household in the world is 
within reach of a satellite. Some developing 
countries even have their own satellites, not as 
instruments of emancipation but as adjuncts 
of sovereignty, a means of monitoring ideas 
that come from elsewhere.

"Interference or competition? 
The development of media networks, the pur- 
chase of parabolic dishes and the lure of 
escapism combine to entice people who are 
tired of unimaginative programmes produced 
in their own countries to tune in to more sen- 
sational programmes beamed from elsewhere. 
Images created in the North often represent 
values contrary to those of the people in the 
South, and present characters, situations and 
living conditions that are light years away from 
their experience. Nonetheless a wide range of 
audiences all over the world are swayed by the 
adventures of the same heroes of the same tele- 
vision serics. The only possible explanation for 
this is the fact that these shows are considered 
as consumer goods and awaited and received 
as such. 
It is sometimes said that young people in 
developing countries have more in common 
with their Western counterparts than they do 
with their own parents. Should we deduce from 
this that we are heading towards a community 
of references and ideas that transcend frontiers? 
To do so would be to forget the perverse effects 
that are already beginning to appear. Is it not 
more likely that the discrepancy between these 
two modes of representation will sow dishar- 
mony and, eventually, schizophrenia and other 
forms of mental conflict? 
It would nonetheless be too simplistic to 
sce this phenomenon as the only expression of 
the North’s hold on the South. In the 1980s 
Third World experts urged developing coun- 
trics to co-operate among themselves, convinced 
that this would provide “the miraculous solu- 
tion that would put an end to unequal exchanges 
and enshrine the advent of truly democratic 
international relations.” A survey we carried 
out in 1984 on the Afro-Arab programme for 
audiovisual co-operation revealed a tendency 
among certain partners—under the guise of fine- 
sounding principles of solidarity—to continue 
the former relationship of domination for

But there is a big danger that the cternal 
reflex that leads some to denounce interfer- 
ence by others in their internal affairs may 
soon lose its familiar landmarks. As the South- 
ern countries themselves become producers 
of communication technologies, the expan- 
sionism they complained of for so long will 
gradually become interpenetration. 
The drums of cyberspace 
The issues raised by the traditional media 
focused on the abolition of political fron- 
tiers in the interests of further “integration”. 
The issues raised by Internet involve the abo- 
lition of ideological frontiers and the stan- 
dardization of behaviour and ideas. Nelson 
Thall, a disciple of Marshall McLuhan, 
believes that the Internet’s unavowed design 
is to get “the whole world to think and write 
like North Americans”. 
This is not integration but assimilation. 
Iris certainly not what most users expect. For 
them the Internet is rather a means of 
“improving the dialogue between countries 
and between individuals spread around the 
globe”.2 They are not looking to the Net to 
escape reality but for a reality thats likely to 
improve their quality of life at work and play.

people’s baggage. Today they travel predomi- 
nantly via the airwaves and new communica- 
tion technologies. What is carried by the air- 
waves, of course, arc the values of the society 
that produces them. Democracy is one of those 
values. The noble paradox inherent in transna- 
tional flows that are hegemonistic by nature is 
‘that they subliminally transmit, albeit 
through an idcological filter, the message of 
freedom and human rights. And people can 
feel that they are citizens of the world when 
they know—often in “real time”—what is 
happening on the other side of the globe. 
Since its massive penetration of the 
remotest regions, television has gradually 
opened people’s eyes to their own living con- 
ditions by showing them those of other peo- 
plesaround the world. This awareness always 
disturbs governments. Much criticism can be 
levelled at these airwaves beamed from else- 
where, but at least they have helped to sow 
the seeds of democratic aspirations that cannot 
be stifled. It remains to be seen what deposits 
they will leave in the collective memory of 
tomorrow. Hu

deas travelled in the same way, and with 
the same speed, as people until the 1840s, 
when magnetic telegraphy was introduced. 
By 1860 there were 51,500 km of telegraph 
lines in the United States alone. A permanent 
transatlantic telegraph line was installed in 
1866, and by 1872 most of the major cities of 
the globe were linked. 
With the advent of telegraphy, the trans- 
mission of information became practically 
instantaneous, but italso acquired a peculiarly 
fragmented character. If information is to 
count as knowledge, it has to relate to a con- 
text. For face-to-face communication such a 
context is provided by the situation in which 
itis embedded. With a written text, especially 
with a printed book, the context for cach par- 
ticular passage 1s given by the wider textual 
environment, indeed by the entire book, or 
often even by the library in which the book is

employing characteristically short sentences, 
telegraphic style comes close to the style of spo- 
ken language. However, telegraphic messages are 
not embedded in concrete speech situations. 
With the telephone, the experience of a living 
conversation is partly restored. Facial expres- 
sions, gestures and the impressions of physical 
surroundings are not transmitted; but tone, 
mood and pace certainly are. Questions can be 
asked, a dialogue maintained. Knowledge gained 
froma telephone conversation might be about 
events far away, yet it is up to date, and can be 
rather complete; but of course it lacks the log- 
ical coherence of written communication. 
© Electronic broadcasting 
In the 1920s radio broadcasting rapidly became 
the dominant mode of news dissemination 
and propaganda. This was a decisive transition 
towards a new era of non-written communi- 
cation, a transition not without effect upon 
twentieth-century philosophy, in particular 
upon Heidegger’s and Wittgenstein’s views on

the nature of linguistic meaning and the cog- 
nitive role of the community. 
Radio broadcasting might enhance a sense 
of global connectedness; but it also fosters 
randomness and evanescence, lessening the lis- 
teners’ ability to form an ordered picture from 
out of what they have heard. Similarly with 
television, where even the apparently all- 
encompassing diversity of information pro- 
vided by satellite broadcasting, information 
both verbal and visual, from local gossip to 
international news, results in a motley of views 
and messages entirely disconnected. 
Television, of course, relies fundamentally 
on images. Now itis possible to conceive of a 
logic of images as complementing verbal logic, 
and indeed itis to be expected that the former 
1s going to play an increasingly important role 
in interactive multimedia communication, the 
great promise of computer networking. How- 
ever, it is fair to say that in television broad- 
casting, as we know it today, the employment 
of images often subverts rather than ampli- 
fies rational thinking. 
"The networked computer 
Just a few years ago it would have still been 
possible to make an analysis of the cognitive and 
social effects of the spread of the personal com- 
puter without specifically referring to the role 
of computer networking. Today such an analy- 
sis would seem unnatural. Computers are, char- 
acteristically, enmeshed in networks. As such 
they are not just number-crunchers and word 
processors, but also, perhaps even primarily, 
nodes of communication. The networked com- 
puter is a tremendously powerful instrument 
for bringing together scattered information— 
data, texts, images, increasingly also sound— 
from all over the world, and indeed for build- 
ing up out of that information new edifices of 
knowledge. The computer enables one to study 
reference material in a breadth hitherto incon- 
ceivable, and in a depth not practicable in the 
conventional printed medium. 
However, both the isolated computer and 
the networked one possess features which 
appear to amplify, rather than alleviate, the dif- 
ficulties of finding one’s way around labyrinths 
of information. The knowledge stored in com- 
puters is physically never present, except for 
the tiny segments momentarily on the screen. 
When reading or browsing through a book, 
when walking along the shelves of a library, or 
even when flipping catalogue cards, one gains a 
sense of orientation the clectronic medium does 
not provide. For your knowledge to be coher- 
ent, you somehow have to know what you 
know, have a survey, an overview, a memorized

pattern of text on a printed page, or the location

scanned on the screen, such an overview will 
hardly emerge. 
© From e-mail to WWW 
The basic form of networking is e-mail—the 
exchange of written messages via telephone 
lines (and/or broad-width cables) and pow- 
erful intermediate computers (called servers), 
between any two individual computer areas. 
Travelling through a net of interconnected 
networks, e-mail messages normally take just 
afew seconds to reach their destinations, and 
within minutes a reply might arrive. Asa con- 
sequence e-mail messages are frequently quite 
similar to exchanges in spoken languages: rich 
in emotions, poor in grammar and typically 
without the logical discipline of reflective writ- 
ing. E-mail messages might be sent to more 
than one person, even to lists containing hun- 
dreds or thousands of addresses. In any case 
they are easily forwarded to third parties. 
E-mail messages are regularly seen by eyes 
they were not intended for. They are, so to

speak, overheard, just as written messages 
often were in the age of reading aloud, the 
kind of reading characteristic of manuscript 
cultures. Another feature of manuscript cul- 
tures brought back by e-mail—and by all 
forms of working with clectronic docu- 
ments—is intertextuality: the free re-use and 
mixing of passages, taken from any text, in 
the process of producing a new one.

> E-mail gives rise to innumerable discus- 
sion lists, news groups and computer bulletin 
boards, which have been described as the con- 
temporary equivalent of the ancient forum. 
And while the overwhelming part of com- 
munication in the electronic market-place is 
entirely fleeting and uninformed, the con- 
certed actions discussion groups frequently 
initiate do have an immense democratic poten- 
tial, and the exchanges they pursue can indeed 
provide information of high quality. 
Such quality is of course more or less main- 
tained in the networked exchanges of the sci- 
entific community. There is today a growing 
number of electronic scholarly journals; indeed 
in some fields traditional periodicals have 
already become obsolete. Even more signifi- 
cantare, as Stevan Harnad pointed out in Psy- 


### 108608: Cyberspace: a planetary network of people and ideas

chological Science in 1990, the changes per- 
taining to the so-called pre-publication 
phase—the phase of scientific inquiry “in 
which ideas and findings are discussed infor- 
mally with colleagues, presented more for- 
mally in seminars, conferences and symposia, 
and distributed still more widely in the form 
of pre-prints. It has now become possible”, 
Harnad emphasized, “to do all this in a 
remarkable new way that is not only incom- 
parably more thorough and systematic in its 
distribution, potentially global in scale and 
almost instantancous in speed, but... unprece- 
dentedly interactive.” Scholarly skywriting 1s 
the telling name Harnad gives to interactive 
scientific inquiry in the medium of e-mail. 
The World Wide Web 
The world of e-mail documents is unstable and 
chaotic, difficult to navigate and impossible to 
survey. By contrast, the World Wide Web 
(WWW), today’s ultimate computer network 
achievement, is relatively stable and transparent. 
The emergence of the Web amounts to a revo- 
lution in its own right. So-called Web pages 
are self-published multimedia documents, each 
having an address, and cach connected through 
so-called hypertext links—spccifically conspic- 
uous words or symbols—to a number of other 
Web pages. Web pages form a more or less fixed 
constellation of documents casy to scan and 
study. We may know our way around in the 
World Wide Web. 
Multimedia documents may also convey 
knowledge that mere texts cannot. The logic of 
images, as noted above, might come to fruit- 
fully complement the logic of texts. In the age 
of manual copying, and even in the age of the 
printing press, illustrations could only play a 
subordinate role; and pictures as vehicles of 
thinking played almost no role at all. This is

now changing with the possibility of manip- 
ulating images on the screen. Let us add that 
knowledge is not just a matter of thinking; it 
is also a matter of practices and skills. And 
illustrations can show how things are done. It 
might be very difficult to give a verbal descrip- 
tion of, say, how a particular instrument is 
handled, whereas a picture or a set of illustra- 
tions will easily explain it. Knowledge accessi- 
ble on the Web is not just global; it also tends 
to be truly operational. 
The virtual library 
Quite a few of the great public and research 
libraries of the world plan, or have already 
begun, to digitize their materials—first the 
catalogues, and subsequently the holdings 
themselves. Once digitized, these materials 
(assuming that copyright problems and other 
related issues have been solved) will be (and 
many of them already are) accessible on the 
net, thereby forming the joint stock of a huge 
library that has no physical existence—a virtual 
library. This stock 1s, of course, continuously 
enriched by scientific publications now issued 
as electronic documents. 
The advantages of the virtual library are 
obvious. Users of the net, whether living in 
poor or rich regions of the world, may in prin- 
ciple have unlimited access to any library item. 
Once they reach the documents they seek, they 
can copy them clectronically or make print- 
outs; and they can work with them in many 
subtle ways, such as clectronically searching 
through them, and constructing concordances 
and indexes. At the same time the original hard 
copy items can be safely stored in buildings 
that will gradually become book museums 
rather than remain traditional libraries.

The library of St. Catherine's 
monastery, built in the 6th 
century at the foot of Mt. Sinai 
(Egypt), houses some 3,500 
manuscripts, the world’s 
second largest collection after 
that in the Vatican Library. 
However, thereare disadvantages too. Even 
if multimedia technologies are fully employed, 
bringing about a stronger illusion of physical 
presence (e.g., pages of old books appearing 
not just as a uniform text, but, if required, 
as facsimile) electronic documents are poor at 
creating a sense of place and time. That the ten- 
sions between the virtual and the physical are 
not, in principle, impossible to resolve, is 
shown by the programme of the new Biblio- 
théque Nationale de France. The BNF, which 
1s to be fully operational by 1998, is meant 
to be both a giant physical library and a dig- 
ital on-line library. It is meant, as two of its 
spiritual architects put it, to “consummate

with that of McLuhan. . .. It will be open,

respect for the past.” The BNF will no doubt 
be a lighthouse in the torrents of the coming 
global virtual library. 
Virtual universities 
In an environment increasingly dominated by 
multimedia computer networks, conventional 
secondary and tertiary education is becoming 
obsolete. Young people growing up with com- 
puters, introduced to the marvels of the net at 
an early age, will experience traditional school 
settings as simply unnatural. They become 
used to finding their information not by ask- 
ing their elders or by going to a library, but by 
surfing the Web. 
On the tertiary level, lifelong learning 1s 
expected, in the form of broad interdiscipli- 
nary education in the first place, and periods 
of specialized training in new directions ever 
after—while being employed, or between jobs.

Tertiary education based on the net scems to 
be the obvious solution. The virtual univer- 
sityis an institution of higher education with- 
out walls—with no definite physical location, 
no classrooms, no conventional library. 
Although a minimum of face-to-face encoun- 
ters among registered students and their teach- 
ers and examiners seems to be inevitable, and 
indeed called for, the learning process most of 
the time takes the form of computer net- 
working. 
The virtual university can be conceived of 
as the twenty-first-century variety of distance 
education. It needs to be stressed, however, 
that the virtual university eliminates, rather 
than bridges distance. The virtual university 
preserves, or recreates, the personal community 
of teacher and students, the audible and visi- 
ble character of lectures, the live interaction 
of seminars. It is heir to the traditional uni- 
versity. But it is different both from the tra- 
ditional university and from distance educa- 
tion in the sense that, utilizing the possibilities 
of interactive multimedia, it radically goes 
beyond the inspirations of the printed book— 
of the fixed linear text. The creation of a virtual 
university is a task of philosophical dimen- 
sions. [t amounts to overcoming text-centred 
modern European thought. 
The working language of the Great Euro- 
pean universities of the Middle Ages was Latin. 
From the sixteenth century on Latin was grad- 
ually complemented by the new literary 
“national” languages emerging in close con- 
nection with the spread of printed books. 
These new languages in turn became instru- 
mental in the creation of modern nation 
states—in building up centralized bureaucra- 
cies and national job markets. The university 
henceforth served as the apex of a national edu- 
cation pyramid. [t appears that in the case of 
small nations the practical importance of 
national universities is diminishing. 
With the rise of a global economy and the 
resulting need of a global education, the pres- 
sures to uphold a nation-wide cultural homo- 
geneity are weakening. A new interest 1s emerg- 
ing in local community life, local culture and 
local dialect, an interest adequately reflected 
by the popularity of local regional radio and 
television broadcasts. Local activities are gain- 
ing a new significance by the fact that they can 
be directly connected, through the net, to 
activities on a global scale, without interven- 
tion or interference from national institu- 
tions. Computer networking is global, but it 
is eminently suited also for the local and the 
particular. Global knowledge and local cul- 
tures might happily coexist and exert mutually 
creative influences. ||

n idea must stand the test of time 
f before it can be transmitted through 
[ space. In other words, it must be 
proof against oblivion, falsity and fal- 
sification, and at the same time remain alive, 
fertile and receptive to change. An idea can 
only do this if it is fixed, first of all in the 
memory, then in a material substance. This 
paradox is more apparent than real: fixity is a 
precondition and guarantee of the movement 
of thought. But if memory is the prime vec- 
tor for the transmission of ideas, it is only 
 
when ideas are externalized by inscription in a 
medium or “carrier” that their lives are pro- 
longed beyond the limits of a single human 
life. As a result of this process messages are 
detached from the human body which they 
outlive by being themselves “embodied” ina 
device that memorizes and diffuses them.

witnesses to this future-oriented process: cach 
technical aid is a step towards the victory of the 
mind over the ephemerality of human life, a 
first step towards someone else—a person who 
may be located in another place or another time. 
The materials on which the inscription is 
made are also repositories of this active mem- 
ory, places where the processing operations 
leave their signature. Everything made by 
human hand is a palimpsest. When the copy- 
ist monk of medicval Europe scratched out 
what had been written on a sheet of parch- 
ment so that he could use it again, he left as 
many traces as he erased. The original text cither 
became an illegible mess or disappeared entirely, 
and then another text was written on the same 
surface. Across the ages these scratchings-out 
tell the story of a technique of writing (com- 
plete with calligraphy, desk, pen, pen-knife, 
and ruler), a method of production and an 
economic system (parchment was made from 
animal skins which had to be limed, cleaned, 
dried, chalked and then scraped, costing more

than the hours of work in the scriptory), and 
of a method of dissemination which was itself 
based on a certain form of knowledge (a sin- 
gle, inexhaustible and sacred message con- 
stantly referred to by writers and readers 
belonging to a small circle of clerks). 
Intangible though it may seem, a computer 
file is not exempt from this trace-making 
process without which it is impossible for an 
idea to endure and travel. It is true that the 
clectronic text can be modified at will and that 
by losing its definitive character it also loses the 
variants and rough drafts that show the suc- 
cessive stages of its composition. But the com- 
puter memory contains far more information 
than that which appears on the screen. With 
each operation—writing, copying, saving or 
erasing—the program records the instruction, 
the code and the tagin a series of figures com- 
prising 0 and 1. While these digits may be inde- 
cipherable as such, they are nevertheless infal- 
lible witnesses to the intellectual operations 
involved in producing a piece of writing or 
an image or doing a calculation. By returning 
to these instructions the program can recon- 
stitute, transmit and modify these data on 
another machine at a later time. 
* Travelling light 
The evolution of techniques of inscription, 
storage and recording shows how the quest 
for greater precision has gone hand in hand 
with a quest for greater mobility. The pur- 
posc of recording a message is not only to 
make it unchangeable but also to make sure

that it can move freely in space and time, when 
its medium can be easily handled, transported 
or duplicated. From the clay or metal tablet of 
the Sumerian era to the wax-smeared wooden 
polyptych of ancient Rome, from the several- 
metre-long volumen to the bound leaves of 
the codex (2nd-4th centuries), from the paper- 
back to the diskette and the clectronic diary, 
the written word has been packaged in increas- 
ingly handy as well as more reliable forms. 
A thirteenth-century European student who 
souglitaccess to a piece of writing recommended 
to him by his tutors was obliged to borrow an 
exemplar or master copy from a stationer and 
make a copy of it. His twentieth-century coun- 
terpart borrows a printed book from the library 
and makes a photocopy, or downloads a digital 
version of it from the network. In both cases, the 
ideas circulate after being recorded in a medium, 
but in the latter case the risk of the wording 
being altered in the course of transmission is 
much smaller than in the former. What applies 
to texts applies even more strongly to the dif- 
fusion of images. One need only think of the 
difficulties of copying a geographical map or an 
assembly diagram, to realize how far inscrip- 
tion techniques—engraving, printing or digiti- 
zation—affect the propagation of knowledge. 
Just as processes have become more reli- 
able, carriers have become more streamlined, 
miniaturized and technically complex. Speed 
and mobility go hand in hand with capacity to 
record and store information. Today, thanks 
to progress in electronics, information can

Package tours 
Ideas travel best in groups. Sciences, arts and reli- 
gions are primarily collections, which assemble 
the physical or mental universe into a corpus 
where it can be reorganized so as to improve its 
capacity for transmission. A message is more 
certain to last if it belongs to a structured whole. 
The origin of muscums—before they set 
themselves the goal of safeguarding the her- 
itage—Ilay in this need to concentrate scien- 
tific knowledge in a single centre of exchange 
and research. The Mouscion of Alexandria, 
300 years before the Christian era, was a trea- 
sure-house and laboratory, a community of 
objects and thinkers from which knowledge 
and beliefs flowed outwards to the entire Hel- 
lenistic world. In the treasuries of ancient tem- 
ples, medieval churches and princes, the same 
foundational activity—collection—opened a 
door to the future for works of the mind. 
Something more than accumulation is 
involved here: objects are brought together 
for processing, management and organization. 
Inventories and indexes, follow-up and cata- 
loguing, as well as comparative study and rank- 
ing revitalize items in a collection by inte- 
grating them into generating systems.

heritage. Faced with the need to protect images, 
objects and buildings from sans-culorte van- 
dalism, the state began to compile invento- 
ries and descriptions of them and classify them 
as historic monuments in a ranking that would 
set an order of priority for their conservation 
and restoration. Thus concentrated in an insti- 
tution—i.e. a policy, places and agents—ideas 
expressed in stone, gouache or pottery gave 
rise to a new idea: that of common property, 
which belongs to all citizens and to no-one 
in particular, and gives substance to awareness 
of the national heritage. 
In the sciences too, memory records and 
produces knowledge by organizing proposi- 
tions. Grids, tables, projections, textbooks, dic- 
tionaries and encyclopacdias connect and sys- 
tematize data so that increasingly complex and 
dynamic knowledge can be extracted from it. It 
is through this kind of networking that cach 
person gains access to the memory of others.

Don’t forget the guide 
Once beliefs and knowledge have been con- 
centrated into territories, we still have to find 
our way around them. This is where human or 
technological guides come in. Access to a polit- 
ical, philosophical, scientific or religious her- 
itage does not necessarily imply familiarity 
with it. 
The inemory has always needed a helping 
hand from signposts, which have ranged from 
the use of “common places” (loci communes) 
by Roman rhetoricians to the hypertext of 
today. Taking in a sct of images, using a tree- 
diagram to find our way into a system of 
thought, or hopping from one screen to the 
next while surfing on the net always implies a 
topology of information, complete with 
road-signs, roundabouts, highways and 
byways. The layout of annotations and foot- 
notes, the nuinbering of chapters and pages, 
and the icons of CD-ROMs enable us to find 
our way within the world of ideas and there- 
fore provide a basis for their transmission. 
In addition to these signposts are mediators 
organized in institutions, groups, clubs, 
schools and corporations. At once structured, 
localized and receptive to their environment, 
these mediators connect thought to the social 
interactions that give it meaning. Their medi- 
ation fits the transmission of ideas into a strat- 
egy, a balance of power ora role-playing situ- 
ation. For shared space-time, a framework of 
tensions and negotiations, is the basis of the 
collective memory. Consensus designed to 
buttress the social body’s belief in its own 
perpetuation never comes about automati- 
cally; its construction calls for constant stew- 
ardship of the collective experience. 
These guides for the collective memory are 
vested with the power to winnow out those 
values that should be preserved fron those 
that should be forgotten. The controversy 
often sparked off by the granting of amnesties 
(the first of which dates from 403 B.C.) or by 
the definition of imprescriptible crimes high- 
lights the ethical issues involved in the politics 
of memory. From the viewpoint of history 
and the formation of cultures, the choice of 
what should be recorded and what should be 
erased is never a natter of indifference. 
The inclination of modern societies to 
exploit to the nth degree everything they pro- 
duce poses a real question. While new tech- 
nologies bring within reach the utopian dream 
of a total grasp of events, phenomena and mes- 
sages, we mustalways keep in mind that remem- 
bering is indissociable from forgetting |

SAFEGUARDING THE DOCUMENTARY HERITAGE 
UNEsco’s “Memory of the world” programme 
n 1992 UNESCO launched a “Memory of the World” Programme 
which secks to protect and facilitate access to the world’s doc- 
umentary heritage. The documents, images and sounds stored 
in libraries and archives which comprise this heritage are a 
major part of the collective memory, reflecting the diversity and orig- 
inality of peoples and cultures. 
Much of the world’s documentary heritage disappears through 
“natural” causes, c.g. acidified paper that crumbles to dust, leather, 
parchment, film and magnetic tape attacked by light, heat, humid- 
ity or pollution. Libraries and archives are also regularly afflicted 
by external events which may be catastrophic unless anticipated by 
preventive measures: flooding, fire, hurricanes, and carthquakes 
as well as acts of war, criminal activity and accidental or deliber- 
ate displacement. 
The UNESCO Programme has two complementary objectives— 
to safeguard endangered documentary heritage and to democra- 
tize access to it. With this in view, it secks to develop products such 
as text, sound and image banks which could be made available 
on local and global networks, as well as compact discs, books, 
postcards, microfilm and other forms of reproduction, and presence 
on the Internet. 
A “Memory of the World” register 
The programme encourages governments to sct up national com- 
mittees in order to increase awareness of the importance of safe- 
guarding their documentary heritage. The committees can inau- 
gurate preservation and information projects they would like to 
see included on the “Memory of the World” Register. This Regis- 
ter, similar in some ways to UNESCO’s World Heritage List, is an 
inventory of the documentary heritage identified as having world 
significance. An International Advisory Committee, whose mem- 
bers arc appointed by UNESCO’s Director General, grants the “Mem- 
ory of the World” label to projects proposed by the national com- 
mittecs and recommends their inclusion on the Register. 
The selection criteria are clearly defined. Documentary her- 
itage is considered to be of world significance if it has had a major 
influence on world history; if it makes an gutstanding contribution 
to our understanding of the world at a particularly important time 
or if it sheds light on a place which played a crucial role in world 
history; if it is associated with a person or people who have made 
an outstanding contribution to world history or culture; if it doc- 
uments in a noteworthy manner a subject or major theme of world 
importance; if itis an important example of an outstanding form or 
style; if it has marked social, spiritual or cultural value which tran- 
scends a national culture. 
National committees already exist in 26 countries. The first 
international conference on the “Memory of the World” was held 
in Oslo (Norway) from 3 to 5 June 1996 and was attended by 
some 150 delegates from 65 countries. A resolution adopted by the 
Conference invites all nations to establish national “Memory of the 
World” committees and to play an active part in the programme. 
Pilot projects 
Several pilot projects currently under way are using leading-edge 
technology to preserve precious and fragile documents and to facil- 
itate access to them. With support from UNESCO and the Library 
of Congress in Washington D.C. (U.S.A), the library of the Russ- 
ian Academy of Sciences in St. Petersburg is producing a CD- 
ROM of the Radzivill Chronicle, a 15th-century illuminated man- 
uscript relating the history of Russia from the 5th to the 13th 
centuries. The Asociacion de Iberoamerica (ABINIA) has pro- 
posed a project to safeguard examples of the 19th-century press in 
THE UNESCO Courier EH JUNE 1997 
12 Latin American countries (via microfilm, digitization, exhibitions 
and publications); a computerized inventory of some 6,000 news- 
paper titles has already becn made. In Yemen a national commit- 
tee has been set up to select the most precious manuscripts found 
in the ceiling of the Great Mosque of Sana’a, and a demonstra- 
tion CD-ROM has been produced in Cairo (Egypt). In a good 
example of a regional project, thousands of old postcards (1890-1930) 
relating to 16 countries of the Economic Community of Western 
African States (ECOWAS) are being recorded on a CD-ROM. 
Some 30 other projects arc in the pipeline, including the restoration 
and preservation of 7,000 hours of audio materials of Chinese folk 
music, Tamil palm-leaf manuscripts in India, Vietnamese films 
and Laotian manuscripts. 
Lastly, so that UNESCO can play its role to the full as co-ordi- 
nator and catalyst, three inventories in the form of regularly up- 
dated databases are being made in co-operation with a number of 
professional bodies: .T 
< Aninventory of library collections and archive holdings which 
have suffered irreparable damage since 1990, to be published as 
Lost Memory— Libraries and Archives Destroyed in the Twentieth 
Century; . 
« A world list of endangered library collections and archive hold- 
ings; 
« An inventory of ongoing operations to protect documentary 
heritage. 
UNESCO has also published a brochure outlining the pro- 
gramme’s technical, legal and financial framework and its work- 
ing structures. This document, entitled Memory of the World, Gen- 
eral Guidelines to Safeguard Documentary Heritage, is available 
free of charge (in cach of UNESCO's official languages). |

INDEX TRANSLATIONUM 
The Index Translationum is an international bibliography of translated 
works published all over the world. It first appeared in 1932, and has 
been published annually since 1948. In 1993 the paper edition was 
replaced by a cumulative CD-ROM edition that is updated every year. 
The Index Translationums a unique working tool produced thanks to 
ongoing international co-operation. The 1996 edition contains some 
830,000 bibliographical entries for books translated and published in 
over 100 countries ranging from Albania to Zimbabwe and covers a vast 
range of subjects. Almost 200,000 authors are listed and over 400 lan- 
guages mentioned. (Periodicals, articles from periodicals, patents and 
brochures are not included.) | |

ROUTES OF 
ultural identities have been created over time by an 
interplay of cultural influences and encounters and by 
movements from one land or region to another. To find 
out more about how these movements have influenced 
our world, UNEscO launched a series of projects in 1988 to 
study the routes that have connected the world’s peoples from 
time immemorial. Scientists and scholars from all over the 
world have been mobilized in a far-reaching enterprise of 
rescarch, including four expeditions. 
The first, The Silk Roads: Roads of Dialogue, highlighted 
the pivotal role played by the movement of people, ideas and 
values in the growth of cultures. It has given rise to numerous 
initiatives and some 40 publications, including six produced 
by UNEscO. The Slave Route project, inaugurated in Benin in 
1994, will study the causes, mechanisms and consequences 
of the Black slave trade, which transformed the history of 
Africa and the Americas. The Iron Road project, launched in 
1991, highlights the impact of African metallurgy on the evo- 
lution of African societies and cultures. The Roads of Faith 
programme, which marks the international, intercultural and 
interreligious importance of Jerusalem, also began in 1991. It 
seeks to enhance understanding of the close ties that grew 
over the centuries between the three monotheistic religions. 
The Routes of al-Andalus project between Europe, the Arab 
world and sub-Saharan Africa, launched in 1995, is designed 
to highlight the lessons of the intercultural heritage of Mus- 
lim Spain where, between the 8th and the 15th centuries, 
three cultures created a cosmopolitan civilization through 
three religions. [| 
 
  
THE UNESCO COLLECTION OF 
REPRESENTATIVE WORKS 
The Unesco Collection of Representative Works, which was created in 
1948, encourages the translation, publication and distribution in major lan- 
guages (English, French, Spamsh and Arabic) of works of literary and cul- 
tural importance that are not well known outside their original national 
boundanes or linguistic communities. 
The works that have been translated under this cultural co-operation 
and exchange programme have been brought out as co-editions in part- 
nership with publishers from all over the world. To date, the catalogue of 
these works contains some 1,000 titles from more than 80 countries, 
translated from 100 or sc different languages. The Collection endeav- 
ours to reflect the varied pattern of the world literary heritage in antholo- 
gies arranged by theme, type and country. It includes works expressive of 
contemporary minority cultures and languages as well as traditional works. 
By translating and distributing their works, the Collection has brought wider 
international recogmtion to authors including Nobel laureates Yasunari 
Kawabata and George Seferis. 
As well as being nationally representative and possessing literary 
qualities, works published in the Collection should be in keeping with the 
ideals and principles of Unesco and may not, therefore, advocate war, 
racism or violence in any form. On the contrary, they should encourage 
tolerance, peace and mutual understanding among peoples and their 
cultures. [|

### 108616: From ideal to action

owen Federico Mayor 
— We  
In his latest book, Unesco—an ideal in action, The continuing 
relevance of a visionary text, Federico Mayor takes the Constitution 
of the Organization he has headed for almost ten years as the 
starting point of a wide-ranging inquiry into the meaning and 
future of international intellectual co-operation. We publish below 
the introduction to this work. 
! Yiemnaire 
 
Does it take a cataclysm on the scale of “the great and ter- 
rible war” that ended in 1945 to stir the conscience of the 
world and bring those who hold the levers of political, 
economic and spiritual power to summon up the same 
dedication, drive and determination as inspired those 
who, at that tine, undertook to build a better world? 
Is humanity fated to find the willpower and the 
strength to take vigorous collective action only when it 
is treading the very brink of the abyss? Is it only in times 
of acute erisis that it is capable of relegating short-term 
interests and concerns to second place and encouraging 
the leaders of the nations, the most powerful nations in 
particular, to be inspired by a historical and global vision? 
The twentieth century is drawing to a elose. It has 
witnessed brilliant triumphs of human ingenuity and a 
succession of nnprecedented technological revolntions 
that have made possible the production of goods and 
services in a quantity and a variety that would have been 
unimaginable at the end of the previons century. Sub- 
stantial progress has been made in education, health, 
communication and many other fields. This century has 
seen the liberation of scores ol peoples, and political and 
geopolitical upheavals whose scope and impact have 
scarcely any parallels in the past. On the other hand, it 
has heen scarred by wars whose scale, ferocity and sheer 
destructive power are also without historical precedent.

### 108616: From ideal to action

Seen overall, the direction in which the world is moving 
on the eve of the twenty-first century is still disturbing, 
despite the hopes aroused by such developments as the 
end of the cold war, the ending of apartheid and the 
peace achieved in El Salvador and Mozambique. 
The spread of violence and of lethal conflicts, elaim- 
ing many victims every day, arouses terror, causes large- 
scale displacements of populations and lays waste whole 
regions. The rise ol fanaticism of all kinds and intolerance 
in its various manifestations have left people in a state of 
shock and pose a threat to peace even when they do not 
degenerate into civil war. Acts of genocide “announced” 
well in advance are committed while institutions that 
shiould prevent or put a stop to them but are unpre- 
pared to do so look on in resignation. Although some 
successes have been achieved in efforts to protect and 
regenerate the environment, the general tendency world 
wide has heen towards a deterioration that ultimately 
presents a serions threat to human survival. Growing 
inequality creates tensions between groups of conntries 
and cleavages within nations. Poverty, lar from dimin- 
ishing, is worsening both in the industrialized and in the 
developing countries, Entire peoples are faced with a 
sitwation where the general trend is towards impover- 
ishment while a minority grows richer. 
Despite some undeniable progress, demoeracy remains 
a tender plant, and it is (ar (rom having become a normal 
feature of the daily life and political enlture of citizens. 
IIiman rights and fundamental freedoms are still regularly 
violated, and broad swaths of the population, young peo- 
ple in particular, are marginalized and excluded from 
debates about the future in many countries, including 
some that set themselves up as champions of human rights. 
Failure to live up to ideals and values that formerly 
gave hope to millions of men and women, spurred them 
on and helped them to look heyond short-term interests, 
and the misappropriation or erosion of those ideals and 
values have left people with a sense of emptiness, disil- 
lustonment, confusion and bitterness. Growing feelings 
of frustration and humiliation are in danger of eausing vio- 
lent explosions, il nothing is done to calm them. 
Itis clear that no nation is entirely exempt from a eri- 
sis of values, or perhaps one should say a moral crisis. 
And yet... . llumanity possesses the knowledge and 
resources with whicliit could put an end to most of these 
crises, and could eliminate, reduce or at least consider- 
ably dilute the causes of these instances of appalling 
inequality, injustice, discrimination, exclusion, frustration 
and humiliation. On emerging from “the great and terr- 
ble war”, it provided itself with a set of mechanisms for 
coneerted action such as would enable the nations of 
the world and men and women of goodwill to work 
together for world peace and the common welfare and 
well-being of all peoples. Not the least among those mech- 
anisms is UNESCO itself, 
What is lacking is the determination to overcome 
national self-interest and short-term concerns and to set 
out upon the road of solidarity, the conrage to proclaim 
aud to convince others that, in an increasingly interde- 
pendent world, peace and prosperity are unsure and 
fragile unless shared by all. 
This determination is something that has to be cre- 
ated. The United Nations system hears a great responsi- 
bility in that respect; and the organizations of which it is 
composed likewise need to show conrage and persever- 
ance in bringing this determination into being and exert- 
ing a greater influence on the major decisions affecting the 
world. By virtue of its ethical mission, UNESCO probably 
has a pioneering role to play in this undertaking. 
Most of the organizations making up the United Nations 
system are celebrating their fiftieth anniversaries, mak- 
ing this an opportune moment to launel initiatives to 
help restore to the system the strength of conviction, the 
vigour and commitment it had inits early days. An effort 
to rediscover the spirit, the will and the hope so remark- 
ably expressed in UNESCO's Constitution, and to educe 
from it pointers for the actiou to be undertaken in this time 
of transition, certainly counts as one such initiative. 
The political, ethical and philosophical message of 
the Constitution is contained in its Preamble and its Arti- 
cle I. The whole message, one might say the whole secret, 
of a great text—and UNESCO's Constitution, by the last- 
ing relevance of its humanist message, is one—is not   
revealed at a first reading. What we read into such a 
text is largely determined by the historical context, and 
what holds our attention is usnally only what appears in 
the light of current events to be particularly important 
and what is of prime concern at that given time. 
To read the Constitution and the records of the Con- 
[erence that drafted and adopted itis, in the cireumstances 
of today, to have one’s eyes opened to certain aspects ol the 
message contained in the text that have not always received 
the attention they deserve. Thus, in the present context the 
principalideas proclaimed and the key concepts contained 
therein take onan even wider applicability and even greater 
force than before. This is the case, in particular, with such 
concepts ad ideas as peace, the democratic prineiples of 
the dignity, equality and mutual respect of men, the intel- 
leetual and moral solidarity of mankind, the ideal of equal- 
ity of educational opportunity for all, the {ree exchange of 
ideas and knowledge, the common welfare of mankind and 
increasing and diffusing knowledge. |

causes that mobilize plenty of sup-

derelta in comparison. Little stud-

public policy-making, soil is per- 
haps too hnmdrum a subject to 
attract attention. It is also a dis- 
couragingly complex one. 
When the carth was less popn- 
lated, its direct users—farmers, 
foresters and builders—respected 
this surface layer which is essential 
for life. This is no longer the case. 
All countries, developed and devel

A nutrition function: it con-

In short, it plays “the role of a

returns to plants as they need it. 
Much of what plants eat, drink and

a purifier and provides the water 
(wells, springs, rivers) which passes 
through it with its ehemical and

A material function: it provides

mal life in the soil, is a recent sei- 
ence and itis far from having drawn 
up a complete inventory of its field. 
To get some idea of the difficnltics 
it faces, we should hear in mind 
that examination of the living mat- 
ter in the first 15 centimetres 
below the surface of the average 
meadow reveals (per gram) a flora 
of 100,000 algae, 600,000,000 
bacteria, 100,000 [ungi, and a 
microfauna (per cubic decimetre) 
ol 1,551,000,000 protozoans (uni- 
cellular ercatures), 51,000 meta- 
zoans (creatures consisting of sev- 
cral eells) including 50,000 
nematodes (worms). In Paris Yves 
Coincau has created the world’s 
first microzoo where vistors peer 
through microscopes to see surre- 
alistic ercatures, including his 
favourites, mites (Acarina) and 
springtails (Collembola). Le tracks 
them down not only in the soil hut 
in our beds, where they find a lodg- 
ing alter going through an extra- 
ordinary process of adaptation. 
THE PRESSURE OF HUMAN 
ACTIVITY 
We live in close interdependence 
with the soil. “The Hebrew word 
adamahl means soil,” Alain Ruel- 
lan points out, “and is the origin 
of the word ‘Adam’, the first man.”

In Japan there are shinto temples 
dedicated to soil and the Japan- 
ese sign for “soil” symbolizes the 
rooted plant. This veneration for 
the soil reflects awareness of its 
mystery and importance. Soil is 
the very root of humanity. I{it dis- 
appears, humanity disappears. 
“It’s all a question of balance 
between the functional capacities 
and renewability of soils and the 
excessive pressure of human activ- 
ities,” Ruellan maintains. “All over 
the world there are too many exam- 
ples of seriously modified soils, of 
soils seriously wounded by 
exploitation—erosion of course but 
also destructuration, compaction, 
tmpoverishment and deelining hio- 
logical activities, excessive desie- 
cation, accumulation of toxie salts, 
leaching of fine and nutritions ele- 
ments, and pollution.”

According to the Food and 
Agriculture Organization of the 
United Nations (FAQ), there are 
3,031 
hectares of eropland worldwide } ’ 
an estimated million 
877 million in developed countries 
and 2,154 in the developing world. 
Michel Robert, 
National Institute for Agronomic 
Research (INRA), has noted that 
“the natural fertility of the great 
of Franee’s 
tropical forests has always been an 
illusion. Inreality, they arc a frag- 
ile ecosystem and as soon as they 
arc allected by deforestation 
important and irreversible changes 
take place; these concern more 
than 11 million hectares cach year 
in tropical areas.” 
In the forest, theve is constder- 
able soil stability and low erosion. 
But mechanized clearance causes 
the soil to become compacted and 
impermeable. Water run-off and 
crosion ensue. Erosion has many 
causes, inchuding overgrazing and 
increased cropping to keep pace 
with demographic growth, as well 
as deforestation. Annual soil loss 
is thonght to allect between 5 and 
7 million heetares a year, according 
to FAO estimates; if erosion eon- 
tinues on this scale, [rom 20 to 30 
per cent of eropland will disappear 
between now and the year 2000. 
Soil should now be regarded as a 
non-renewable resonree, just like 
peat, coal or oil. Nature needs from 
100 to 100 years to ereate 10 mil- 
limetres of topsoil and from 3,000 to 
12,000 years to form a soil layer 
cqnivalent to the length of this page. 
[Tumanity cannot wait so long. Soil 
protection is urgently needed. WH

Palmyra, “city of palms”, was founded in an oasis between the Orontes and the Euphrates in the heart of 
the Syrian desert towards the end of the third millennium B.C. It was the capital of Palmyrene, an ally of 
Rome atthe beginning of the Roman empire (late 1st century B.C.). It enjoyed a golden age during the 
reign of Zenobia in the third century A.D., until it was sacked by the Roman emperor Aurelian in 273. In the 
following centuries it recovered some of its importance, but never again played its former role, Its ruins 
are among the most important of late Antiquity. One original feature of Palmyra is funerary sculpture 
whose hieratic images and spiritual intensity transcend Greek, Roman and Persian influences and 
foreshadow Byzantine art.

and politician Caius

The finest specimens of 
Palmyrene sculpture were 
produced during the first three 
centuries of the Christian era, at 
a time when the pax romana 
encouraged long-distance trade. 
They belong to the art of the 
Roman Middle East, where Ilel- 
lenistic influence prevailed in an 
area stretching from Egypt to the 
 
THE UNESCO Gouritr HW JUNE 1997 
borders of Mesopotamia. The 
blending of civilizations and cul- 
tures in the melting pot of the 
Roman Empire infused a new 
spiritinto art. The classical mod- 
cls of Rome, which still lived on, 
were laken up and recreated 
rather than imitated. The art of 
Palmyra incorporates features 
that 
empire, while also displaying the 
came [rom the Persian 
influence of local Syrian and 
Mesopotamian traditions and of 
Oriental traditions in general. 
A salient feature of this sculp- 
ture is that caeh figure is pre- 
sented frontally and as an individ- 
ual. This concern for individuality 
is particularly noticeable in the 
funerary statues, in which 
Palmyrene sculptors gave their own 
twist to classical Roman portrai- 
ture, which in the second century 
A.D. was moving away from real- 
ism towards idealization. The 
extraordinary variety of types pro- 
duced by the realism of carly 
Roman statnary is replaced in the 
imperial period by a gallery of ide- 
alized portraits. Strict individual 
  
resemblance is abandoned. Artists 
depict personages with imaginary 
features. Figures from the past 
and portraits of contemporaries 
are reinvented. Rulers and sub- 
jeets alike are shown with divine 
attributes and are masked with 
idealized faces. 
This trend in Roman statuary 
had a profound effect in the cast- 
ern provinces of the Roman 
empire. Emphatic stylization 
deliberately transgressed the 
canons of naturalistic beanty. An 
attempt was made to purge the 
human face of earthly affinities 
and invest it with celestial quali- 
tics. In the painted portraits of 
Fayoum in Egypt and the stone 
carvings of cities in the Arab 
desert alike, the face is shown as 
transcending place and time, With 
its thin lips, sharp nose, inordi- 
nately enlarged eyes and open 
raze, it belongs to eternity, 
HOUSES OF ETERNITY 
Palmyrene sculpture takes this 
stylistic evolution to its highest 
point. In the hypogea, under-

ground burial vaults known as 
“houses of eternity” are a pleiad of 
faces carved in rock. On each tomb 
is a stele depicting the deceased 
full-length or as a bust. In accor- 
dance with the convention of 
frontality, the figures face out to 
us, almost always in high or low 
relief (sculpture in the round is 
very rare in Palmyrene art). Their 
idealized and youthful faces fit 
into a conventional mould and all 
possess similar features. Men, 
women and children are depicted 
as types. Veils and curls of hair 
frame oval faces. The features are 
simplified; movement is restrained; 
expression is concentrated. 
Contemplation is the sole [orm 
of action. Two coneentric circles 
(the iris and the pupil) represent 
the eye. The pupils are frozen 
between the eyelids. “These enor- 
mous eyes, as unreal as the folds 
of the robe, seem to want to pour 
forth a torrent of life, and they 
alone perform the magic task of 
giving life to a bust which other- 
wise lacked all semblance of 
being,” wrote the archaeologist 
yO 
2. 
Henri Seyrig. “For the Palmyrene 
seulptor the most interesting 
aspect of being is its deepest and 
most permanent content.” 
The name of the deceased is 
often preceded by the Aramacan 
term nafsha, meaning “breath”, 
“soul” or “person”. Earthly like- 
nesses have been left behind by 
these [aces which concentrate on

Milestones in a long history 
 
1980: The archaeological site of Palmyra is placed 
on Unesco’s World Heritage List. 
LOCATION: 
@® Homs province, Syrian Arab Republic 
215 km northeast of Damascus. 
@ The oasis city of Palmyra is bounded 
on the west and north by hills, and opens 
onto the desert to the south and east. 
@® The ancient city stretches out to the 
northwest; the modern city occupies an 
arid plateau northeast of the oasis. 
HISTORY: 
@® The oldest tools found at Palmyra 
date back some 75,000 years. 
@ Beginning of the second 
millennium B.C.: first known mention of 
Tadmor, the original name of Palmyra, 
still used in Arabic. 
@® 3rd century B.C.: Palmyra and its 
territory constitute an Arab principality. 
® 1st century B.C.: The city is under 
Roman tutelage. 
® Around 129: The Emperor Hadrian 
makes Palmyra a “free city”. 
® 2nd century: Palmyra’s golden age. 
The city’s trading links stretch as far as 
India and China in the east, and to Italy 
in the west. 
@ Mid-third century: The situation of 
the Roman empire deteriorates; Palmyra 
enjoys a certain independence; Odainat, 
member of a family of Arab stock, 
ennobled by Septimius Severus, becomes 
“Imperator”, and is thereby invested 
with authority in this part of the empire. 
He proclaims himself King of Kings. 
@® 268: On the death of Odainat, his 
son and heir, Wahballat, is too young to 
govern. Wahballat's mother, Zenobia, 
exercises power with the title of most 
illustrious queen. She invades Egypt. 
@® 270:The army of Palmyra occupies 
Antioch, capital of Syria. 
@® 272:Roman troops led by Aurelian 
enter Syria. Zenobia defends the Syrian 
capital. The queen breaks with Rome and 
proctaims herself “Augusta”. In August, 
Palmyra capitulates. Aurelian 
establishes a garrison there and leaves 
the city. 
@ Spring 273: Fresh outbreak of revolt 
at Palmyra. The garrison is massacred. 
Aurelian returns in haste and sacks the 
city. Zenobia and her son are taken to 
Rome as captives. Palmyra never recovers 
from this defeat. 
@® Late 3rd century: Diocletian makes 
Palmyra part of the eastern limes, the 
network of routes and military posts 
protecting the empire against the 
Persians. 
® Around 400, during the reign of 
Arcadius, Palmyra recovers some of its 
importance. 
@ 6th century: The Ghassanid Arab 
dynasty, allied to the Byzantines, 
dominates the Syrian desert. The 
emperor Justinian takes a keen interest 
in Palmyra, renovates it, surrounds it 
with fortifications, provides it with 
water, and instals a garrison, 
@® 634: Khaled ibn al-Walid, one of 
the generals of the first caliph, Abu 
Bakr, takes Palmyra, which again 
becomes Tadmor. During the first 
centuries of Islam the city gradually falls 
into oblivion. 
@® 12th century: A new period of 
prosperity begins under governor Yusuf 
ibn Fairiiz. Major renovation work. 
@® 1264: Homs and Palmyra fall 
under the sway of the Mamluk sultan 
Baybars. 
@® 1401: Tamerlane sends troops which 
sack the city. 
® 16th-19th centuries: Under Ottoman 
domination, the city’s decline 
accelerates. Palmyra is reduced to a 
village, at the mercy of nomad tribes. 
@ 17th century: European travellers 
visit the ruins of Palmyra and make 
enthusiastic descriptions of them. 
@ 18th century: The English 
explorers James Dawkins and Robert 
Wood, in 1751, and the French 
philosopher Volney, in 1787, reveal 
to the world the splendour of the 
forgotten site. |

threatened by urban encroachment 
Above, the pyramids 
and the nearby outskirts of 
Cairo. 
In the last few years rampant population 
growth and urban sprawl have combined 
to pose an increasingly serious threat to Egypt's 
archacological monuments and sites. The ugly 
side-effects of urban development—water, air 
and noise pollution, constant vibrations and dam- 
age to the environment—are well known to all 
the world’s city-dwellers. 
Cairo’s older inhabitants remember that only 
fifty years ago the main road to the pyramids, 
beginning in Giza Square, ran throngh fickds 
before reaching the pyramids in the desert. At 
that time the pyramids could be seen eight kilo- 
metres away. Now only a forest of buildings is 
visible from Giza Square. 
Traffic congestion choked the road so severely 
that another road was built parallel to it, 
encroaching on farmland which was replaced by 
There are no car park facilities or garages in 
these settlements and in some cases there is no 
running water. In the absence of any kind of town 
planning, nsing these two roads can be a hair- 
raising experience, 
To improve the links between Cairo and the 
new towns around it, the idea was raised of build- 
ing a huge ring road, 95 kilometres long and 42 
melres wide, at a cost of one billion Egyptian 
ponnds. The route of the highway wonld take it 
very near the Giza pyramids—an area which has 
beerron UnEsco’s World Heritage List since 1979, 
Nonetheless work on the ring road began in 1986, 
without prior consnltation with the World Iler- 
itage Committee and in flagrant violation of 
Egyptian heritage law, which protects land that 
might contain historic monmnents. 
The alarm was sounded in 1994 by the British 
daily The Independent, whiclu drew attention to 
the risks posed by the road to any monuments 
that miight be buried in an area where no archae- 
ological research had yet heen done. As a vesnlt of 
the debate triggered by the press and subsequent

the completion of a study by an expert committee. 
This was not the first round in the fight to 
preserve the plateau of the Pyramids. In the 
late 1980s UNESCO sent an expert committee to 
draw up a project to protect the area, including 
restoration of the Sphinx and construction of a 
wall between the archaeological site and the 
nearby villages of Nazlet Essallab and Kafr Elga- 
bal, which had been joined together by urban 
growth. The project was abandoned, however, 
in face of a storm of protest {rom local interest 
groups. 
THE THREAT TO LUXOR 
The pyramids are not the only pharaonic remains 
harmed by urbanization. Luxor, one of the 
world’s most prestigious historic cities, is also 
threatened. The site includes the temple of Kar- 
nak, the temple of Luxor itself and the Road of 
the Rams that joins them ou the east bank of 
the Nile, and on the west hank the Valey of the 
Queens, with the temple of Ilatshepsut and the 
tomb of Nefertiti, and the Valley of the Kings.

to cross the river and motor traffic had to make 
a detour through the distant town of Esna where 
a bridge spans the Nile. The idea of building a 
bridge at Luxor was first raised in 1972 and was 
adopted in 1982. The chosen site was located 
north of the town, seven kilometres from the Val- 
ley of the Kings. 
Supporters of the project pointed to the many 
services the bridge would perform for the eom- 
munity and especially its role in encouraging 
industrial development in the nearby town of 
Armante, the centre of the region’s sugar indus- 
try, by making road haulage possible for the 
enormous output of the sugar cane fields. The 
bridge would also reduce the distance between 
Aswan and Cairo by almost 100 kilometres. 
The project was decreed to be in the public 
interest in 1990, and work began. Five years and 
25 million Egyptian pounds later, with the bridge 
nearly complete, came a bombshell. It was 
revealed in the press that the bridge’s existence 
might destroy all the archaeological remains on the 
west bank. Egyptian artists and scientists joined 
forees and called {or the work to be halted. 
The pharaohs and their builders chose the 
site of their final resting place with very great 
care. The tombs are on high, dry ground, out of 
reach of the floodwaters of the Nile in an arca 
composed of two overlaid geological strata, a 
limestone layer containing the tombs, and a layer 
of elay which retains rainwater and atmospherie 
humidity in its cracks. Inside the tombs, broad 
pillars afford protection against earthquakes. 
By saturating the lower clay layers with water, 
construction of the bridge exposed them to the 
danger of slippage, eausing movement of the 
upper limestone layers and the collapse of the 
temples. 
Other arguments drew attention to the risk 
that this historic site, whose beauty and 
grandiose solitude attract tourists, would be dis- 
figured by commerce and building whieh would 
ultimately discourage tourism. But it is too late; 
the bridge has been built. 
Strict laws now forbid the encroachment of 
urban settlements onto farmland and building on 
the west bank of the Nile. The protected area 
around monuments has even heen extended. But 
will these measures be enough to prevent nrhan 
expansion so uncontrolled that itindiscriminately 
destroys everything int its path, whether itis crop- 
land or archaeological heritage? |

### 108624: Interview with Viviane Forrester

interview Viviane Forrester 
French writer Viviane Forrester is a novelist, 
literary critic and the author of an award- 
winning biography of Van Gogh. Her most 
recent book is L'Horreur Economique (1996), 
an examination of the tyranny of economics in 
the modern world which has become a best- 
seller in France. Forcefully written and well 
documented, it paints the picture of a society 
in which jobs are disappearing, depriving very 
large numbers of people of the opportunity to 
earn a living, and denounces the way in which 
this situation is being exploited. The book is 
currently being translated in some twenty 
countries. Here Viviane Forrester talks to Edgar 
Reichmann. 
 
BM You are a novelist and you have a special 
interest in English literature, notably the 
Bloomsbury group. How did you come to write a 
book about economics? 
Viviane Forrester: I have never compartmental- 
ized creative activity. All thinking, to my mind, 
is political, even when it does not claim to be. | 
think that each of us, whatever our walk of life, 
should eel concerned abont the present state of 
the world, which is entirely governed by eco- 
nomics. Isn’t this situation inextricably tied up 
with politics, in the highest sense of the term? If 
Shakespeare were to come back to life today, 1 
think he would be fascinated by the tragic inter- 
play of powerful economic forces which are 
stealthily transforming the lives and destimies of 
the citizens—or rather the popnlations—of all 
countries, 
MW You pillory the optimistic belief that the 
current crisis—with its corollary of long-term 
 
unemployment—is temporary. Do you think that 
this crisis reflects a major shift? 
V.F.: T think it dees. To my mind we are witness- 
ing a profound change, a transformation ol soci- 
ety and civilization, and we are finding it very 
hard to accept. [Tow can we say good-bye to a 
society that was based on stable jobs that pro- 
vided a safety net and the basics of a decent exis- 
tence? Job security is on the way out. In my book 
I concentrate on the ways in which this sitna- 
tion is being exploited. For the first time in his- 
tory, the vast majority of human beings are no 
longer indispensable to the small number of those 
who run the world economy. The economy is 
increasingly wrapped up in pure speculation. 
The working masses and their cost are becoming 
superfluous. In other words, there is something 
worse than actually being exploited—and that is 
no longer to be even worth exploiting! 
It is true that this state of affairs is not being 
concealed, but there is a tendeney to avoid talking

### 108624: Interview with Viviane Forrester

What we are seeing today is economic 
globalization and the globalization of 
poverty. 
» about it clearly. In democratic societies, at any 
rate, you don’t tell people that they are regarded 
as superfluous. Under totalitarianism there might 
be an even worse danger than joblessness and 
poverty. Oncesalaried work has disappeared, why 
should a totalitavian regime not simply eliminate 
those forces that have become useless? 
HM What can be done to avoid this terrible 
conclusion? 
V.E.: In democratie countries there is an urgent 
need for vigilanee. It is often claimed that the 
industrial age, when a regular wage provided the 
means of subsistence, can somehow be patehed 
up. But those days are over. Wage-earningis dis- 
appearing and the paneply of temporary deles 
and allowances designed to replace it is shrinking, 
something that is nothing less than eriminal. The 
managers of the economic machine exploit this 
situation. Full employment is a thing of the past, 
but we still nse criteria that were current in the 
nineteenth centu ry, or twenty or thirty years ago, 
when it still existed. Among other things, this 
encourages many unemployed people to feel 
ashamed of themselves. This shame has always 
been absurd hut it is even more so today. 
It goes hand in hand with the fear felt by the 
privileged who still have a paid job and are afraid 
of losing it, I maintain that this shame and this 
fear ought to he quoted on the stock exchange, 
beeanse they are major inputs in profit. Once 
upon a time people pilloried the alienation 
caused by work. Today falling labour costs con- 
tribute to the profits of big companies, whose 
favourite management tool is sacking workers; 
when they do this, their stock market value soars. 
BM Butisn’tit possible that the accumulation of 
banking and financial wealth, and the widespread 
long-term unemployment you talk about may 
lead to a so-called leisure society? This was 
supposed to happen in the now-defunct Marxist 
utopia—everyone would be rewarded according to 
their needs and not only for the work which 
brought them a living. 
V.E: We lived for decades with the utopia you 
allude to. What we are seeing today is economic

globalization and the globalization of poverty. 
We are living with this globalization and with 
sophisticated technologies that were unimagin- 
able not so long ago. Their effeets should be ben- 
eficial for all of us. In point of fact they are 
dreadful. Itis essential to find a different way of 
living, without necessarily trying to create an 
ideal one. I do not think that the planet can 
become a paradise, but I would like it at least to 
be a home for decent societies in which everyone 
is treated with dignity and people respect their 
neighbours. 
BM You talk in your book of “virtual markets”. 
What do you mean by that? 
V.F: refer to a current form of business trans- 
aetion in which people deal in what does not 
exist. These are transactions which do not involve 
real assets, nor even symbols for such assets, hut 
where people buy and sell, for example, the risks 
involved in contracts which have not yet heen 
signed or are still being negotiated; where debts 
are sold and are later bought and sold en again 
and again; where deals are made, involving virtual 
values whieh are already guaranteed: they in 
turn give rise to other contracts based on the 
negotiation of the previous ones! In this market 
in risks and debts people speculate on speenla- 
tion, It is an unveal market, based on illusions. 
While I was writing my chapter on this virtual 
economy lL read through what [ had written and 
said to myself that it simply ceuldn’t be true, 
that I was talking nonsense. The same evening, 
former German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt 
appeared on French television and confirmed 
that a hundred times more deals were made on 
these surrealistic markets than on the others. 
This is very serious because it is leading us to 
an autonomous ceonomy, incapable of ereating 
real jobs. One person with a fax and a computer 
can make this kind of deal, in which no invest- 
ment is required and people make bets, like in a 
casino or at the races, on a virtual market which 
has nothing to do with the labour market. 
WM But your book also has a lot to say about 
wealth creation and the forces behind it. 
Virtual markets are leading us to an 
economy incapable of creating real jobs.

### 108624: Interview with Viviane Forrester

V.E: Today we hear alot about “wealth creation”. 
In the past it was simply known as profit. Today 
people talk about this wealth as if it will auto- 
matically go straight to the community and ereate 
jobs, yet at the same time we see liighly prof- 
itable businesses cutting down heavily on their 
workforce. When people talk about soeiety’s 
“movers and shakers”, they aren’t talking about 
the bulk of their country’s population but about 
business leaders who relocate at the drop of a 
hat. Politicians make jobs their priority, but the 
Stock Exchange is delighted whenever a big indus- 
trial complex fires workers and gets worried when- 
ever there’s the slightest improvement in the 
unemployment figures. I wanted to draw people’s 
attention to this paradox. A company’s stock mar- 
ket quotation depends largely on labour costs, 
and profit is generated in the last analysis by 
redueing the numbers of those who have a job. 
BM What impact is this economic tyranny having 
on culture, teaching, education and young 
people? 
V.E.: The present situation raises a vital question 
for the future of the people of our planet, above 
alt for young people and their future. Today the 
great thing is to be “profitable”, not “useful”. 
This raises a very serious question. Should peo- 
ple be profitable in order to “deserve” the right 
to live? The commonsense answer is that it is a 
good thing to be useful to society. But we are 
preventing people [rom being useful, we are 
squandering the energies of young people by 
regarding profitability as the be-all and end-all. 
Most countries have lost their sense of priorities. 
There is a greater and greater need for teachers 
and medical staff, hut governments are inereas- 
ingly aggressive towards them. These are the 
professions where posts are abolished and fund- 
ing is cut. Yet they are indispensable to the wel- 
fare and future of humanity. This confusion 
between “usefulness” and “profitability” is dis- 
astrous [or the future of the planet. 
Young people live in a society which still 
regards salaried employment as the only accept- 
able, honest and lawful way of life, but most of 
them are deprived of the opportunity te achieve 
this. In deprived inner city areas this is a major 
problem. At the same time I often meet young 
people with armfuls of degrees who are out of 
work. What inexcusable waste! For generations 
study was young people’s initiation into social life. 
I admire young people today because they go on 
with their studies fully aware that they are run- 
ning the risk of rejection by socicty. 
Twenty-odd years ago, during a writers’ forum 
in Austria, there was great amusement when one 
of the speakers asked the audience (who came 
from mauy countries) whether they had ever 
heard of a French poet named Mallarmé. A later 
speaker was indignant about our laughter. Ile 
mentioned a number of brand names, none of 
which we had ever heard of. They were makes of 
rifles and machine guns. Ile was from a country 
of the South, then plunged in civil war, where 90 
per cent of the people knew the names of these 
weapons but no ene would ever have heard of 
Mallarmé. Theard myself saying that if the users 
of these machine guns, African peasant farmers, 
the young people of Latin America and most of 
the unqualified workers of Europe have never 
heard of Mallarmé, it’s not all their lault: they 
don’t have the opportunity. Some have machine 
guns; others have the time to read Mallarmé! 
That’s another erime! The works of writers sueh 
Should people be profitable in order to 
“deserve” the right to live? 
as Mallarmé, Senghor, Omar Khayam, Kafka, 
Proust or Virginia Woolf should not be the priv- 
ilege of an elite. They break down the walls that 
imprison us. Understanding the work of these 
creative artists makes us freer, less blind and 
less deal. Their work helps to broaden our hori- 
zons, sharpen our thinking and open our minds, 
the only way to a critical, elear-thinking outlook 
and to effective action. Then someone at the 
mecting stood up and shouted: “Mallarmé is a 
machine gun!” 
BM Your analysis deals primarily with the 
situation in the industrialized countries. What 
about the developing world? 
V.F.: This is something about which the West 
ought to feel heartily ashamed! It behaved rapa- 
ciously in the countries it colonized, and today it 
closes its frontiers to their people who eome 
looking for menial jobs in order to survive, under 
the pretext that they would make the unem- 
ployment figures worse. Evenif there was an tota

Young people are being robbed of the chance 
of salaried employment. 
» famine, pandemics and civil war. Those who try, 
in some countries of the North, to convince pub- 
lic opinion that immigration causes unemploy- 
ment, divert attention from the truth, In the 
North itis the relocation of certain industries and 
the flight of capital that are inereasingly causing 
and perpetuating unemployment. 
Only twenty or thirty years ago, there was 
still reason to hope that the relative prosperity 
of the North would spread all over the world. 
Today we are seeing the globalization of poverty. 
Businesses based in the North that set up in the 
so-called “developing” countries, do not create 
jobs for the people of those countries but gen- 
erally make them work without any kind of social 
security protection, in medieval conditions. The 
reason is that the workforce—underpaid women 
and ehildren, as well as prisoners—costs less than 
automation would cost in the country of origin. 
This is colonization in another, equally heinous, 
form. 
BM In spite of your pessimism, do you see any 
solutions on the horizon different from those that 
led to totalitarianism? 
V.E: T am not pessimistic, far from it. The pes- 
to the present situation, that we have no choice. 
My book is an attempt to describe what is going 
on. It’s true that the situation is dramatic. All the 
same I am, like many other people, the citizen of 
a country whose democratic regime makes it pos- 
sible to reflect and freely resist the growing pres- 
sure that the economic factor is exerting on our 
lives. By endlessly going on about the dictatorial 
system that prevailed until recently in part of 
Europe and elsewhere, some people want us to 
think that the terrible failure of the U.S.S.R. 
justifies the economic horrors facing us. This is 
a kind of blackmail. 
I would like there to be checks and balances, 
alternative thinking, conflicts of ideas and inter- 
ests. Not violent conflict, of course, but we 
should wake up and stop being petrified, pris- 
oners of hackneyed thinking. Already in coun- 
tries where my book is being translated—espe- 
cially in the United States, Brazil, Mexico, 
Lithuania, Poland and in others such as the 
Republic of Korea—it is causing something of a 
stir even before publication. Articles are appear- 
ing, people are asking me questions, friends of 
mine who read French are asking for copies. 
I am neither against the globalization of 
exchanges, nor the emergence of new techmolo- 
gics. Such an attitude would be absurd. But I am 
against their being taken over by a tiny minority 
of economic power centres, often in private 
hands, whereas entire populations are excluded 
from social progress. I am against the globaliza- 
tion of rejection and poverty and for the global-

PAULO FREIRE 
(1921-1997) 
Paulo Freire has left us, and with his passing something has gone from the 
world’s classrooms; on every continent teachers have felt, perhaps uncon- 
sciously, a moment’s sadness before returning to their task with renewed 
force and conviction. 
He taught autonomy, hope to the oppressed. He knew, like Bolivar, that 
education is the key to freedom. Paulo Freire, teacher of liberation, 
was imprisoned and exiled by those who fear men and women in control 
of their destiny. 
Paulo Freire was driven by the urgency of change: he never forgot that, 
as Salvador Ortiz-Carboneres has written, “the night is long for those who 
wait for the light of day.” 
Technology, ves, but above all, tenderness. Above all, smiles and affec- 
tion to avoid the cold, demented world of machines. Shaping attitudes, 
helping people achieve sovereignty over themselves. A critical sover- 
eignty, guided by lodestars that are neither bought nor sold. 
A few months ago, I wrote the following lines in his biobibliography: 
“Paulo Freire’s long and brilliant trajectory in the art of teaching has made 
him a legendary figure. The only pedagogy is that of love—and anxiety. 
That which leads all human beings, men and women, to assume their 
responsibilities, to make decisions without outside interference, to walk 
a tightrope between shade and light, between mist and radiance—wher- 
ever freedom is the essence, the culmination and the reason of each life.” 
One April day in 1995, in a little village in southern Sudan, I dedicated 
a poem to my friend Paulo, the teacher of teachers: “Surrounded for- 
ever/by mangroves/baobabs and acacias/I shall think only of your 
eyes/eves of a wounded gazelle/girl of solitude/and distance./I go away/cov- 
ered with mud and straw. /for your hut/now/occupies/all the spaces/of my 
house./Our houses overflowing/and yours destitute./I must not forget/that 
all the rest/ is unimportant./Ah, to remember/Your hut/full of love and 
smiles!” 
The giants of the intellect die but do not disappear. They simply become 
invisible. Theirs is the most important of all lessons: they set us an 
example.
