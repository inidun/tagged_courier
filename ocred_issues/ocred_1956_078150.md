THE NEW PANORAMA 
OF HISTORY 
RNOLD TOYNBEE, writing recently in the quar- 
terly review Diogenes (1) had some revealing 
~ things to say about the new approach to the 
study of history. “In less than one lifetime”, he 
remarks, “the face of the World has changed alinost 
out of recognition, and the West's position in the World 
has undergone the greatest change of all. If one has 
been following the course of world affairs since 1914, 
one is bound to have gained, {rom this alone, a good 
deal of new knowledge about history; and meanwhile, 
the forty years that have seen this new chapter of 
history wriling itself have also seen the orientalists 
and the archacologists recovering for us other chapters 
of history that had been cither forgotten completely or 
had been remembered ¢nly in a few shreds and tatters 
of tradition. ” 
Toynbee points to the fact that “in our day the 
Minoan Civilization has risen from its grave below the 
Gracco-Roman Civilization; the Shang Culture in 
China from below the classical Chinese Civilization: 
the Indus Culture from below Aryan India; the 
Hittite Civilization from below the Asia Minor known 
to Herodotus; and at the same time our picture of the 
Sumerian and Egyptian Civilizations, and of the 
pr-Columbian Civilizations in the New World, has heen 
quite transformed by the new knowledge that the 
excavator’s spade has brought to light here too. This 
re-discovery of the rather less recent past, logether 
with the portentous events 'of our own day, has given 
us a wealth of new historical information. Our 
vision of the history of Mankind, since the rise of the 
earliest known civilizations about 5,000 years ago, hus 
been enormously enlarged and has also been brought 
into much sharper focus. And since curiosity is onc of 
the characteristics of human nature, we find ourselves 
moved, in our time,-to take a new look at the new face 
of history as a whole. ” 
And Toynbee adds : “As soon as one looks at the 
new panorama of history, one sces that it bursts the 
bounds of the current framework within which our 
Western historians have heen doing their work for the 
last 250 years... As I write these words, I seem to eatch 
the faint sound of the busy archacologist’s trowel, as 
he deftly uncovers new layers of buried civilizations 
in Bucklersbury and Beyce Sultan and Palenque.” 
The very word “history”, it is interesting to note, 
comes from the Greek meaning “inquiry” or “investi- 
gation”. All presentation of history is based on a 
series of investigations and the asking of questions, as 
varied and never-ending as the lhistorian’s field of 
inquiry has broadened. In this issue, The Ux~Esco 
Couricr examines a few of the questions histori- 
ans and teachers have been asking recently about the 
picture of other countries and cultures which our 
children seem to be getting from many history books.

MACHU PICCHU 
Hundreds of years before the Europeans arrived on American shores, 
at least three great centres of civilization had developed in North and 
South America: the Mayas of Guatemala and Yucatan, the Aztecs of 
Mexico, and the Incas who controlled a vast region in the Andes and 
along the coast from Ecuador through Peru and Bolivia into Chile and 
Argentina. If these great civilizations are not always described as 
“cruel” or *‘barbaric’’, they are usually mentioned only insofar as they 
are episodes in the conquests of Pizarro or Cortes and their gold- 
hungry followers. Little or nothing is said in the textbooks of many 
countries of these. peoples’ achievements in the arts and crafts, archi- 
tecture, engineering and other domains. It is to the farmers of the 
Inca empire, for example, that we owe the potato. And of all the 
American Indians only the Incas had draught animals, using llamas as 
mounts and as beasts of burden. Their craftsmen practised every style 
of handweaving we know today. Their pottery was developed into a 
highly refined art, they smelted metals and cast in moulds. They built

THE ‘LOST CITY’ OF THE 
Copyright Adep-Verger 
INCAS 
paved roads with suspension bridges and outpost houses at intervals over 
the wildest mountain ranges and through the desert for hundreds of miles. 
The Emperor of the Incas was called “the Inca’’, and the land he ruled’ 
“The Empire of the Four Parts of the World". Of the many remains of 
Inca civilization scattered over the central Andean highlands, perhaps 
the most mysterious is ‘the lost city” of Machu Picchu, north of Cuzco, 
the ancient Inca capital. Discovered in 1911 by an American archaco- 
logist, Hiram Bingham, it was entirely buried under a thick mass of 
vegetation. No ancient chronicler had ever mentioned it. What hap- 
pened to its inhabitants remains one of the great enigmas of history. 
Some authorities believe that Machu Picchu was a refuge for the last 
Inca at the time of the Spanish conquest. Like other Inca cities, Machu 
Picchu is surrounded by towering ramparts made of individual stones of 
prodigious size and weighing many tons. No mortar was used, yet 
after centuries these stones lie so perfectly fitted together that it is 
still impossible to insert the blade of a knife between many of them.

### 68285: How biased are our history textbooks?

HOW BIASED ARE OUR 
HISTORY TEXTBOOKS ? 
T is a shock to find that some 
people regard you as a villain; 
perhaps as much of a shock to 
learn that they ignore your existence. 
If you read the history textbooks 
published in other countries, you may 
be offended sometimes in both ways: 
at finding that your country is 
regarded as the villain, and also at 
finding that your country is virtually 
ignored. If neither villain nor ignored, 
you will almost certainly conclude 
that your country has been under- 
estimated, misrepresented and mis- 
understood. 
Qur own people, we have learned, 
have on occasions been victims of 
broken promises, treachery, and 
massacres: the notion that “we” have 
been the perpetrators of such infa- 
mies would be ridiculous if it were 
not so revolting. 
The British do not think of 
themselves as an aggressor nation, 
but it is clearly recorded in history 
textbooks of another country (and 
one that is considered very friendly 
to Britain) that the British started a 
war against them: “Peace reigned, 
yet they seized by treachery...” . The 
French would not think of themselves 
in the terms applied in a textbook in 
another country: “the pillage and 
rapine of the invaders...” Americans 
and British both feel some hurt in 
their pride 'when they learn that there 
exist accounts of the Second World 
War from which it would be difficult 
to deduce that their countries made 
any sacrifices and took part in the 
defeat of Hitler. 
‘ Burn the books’ 
—A cry of the past 
HAT attitudes toward other 
countries do children learn from 
their textbooks? It took the 
First World War to spark interest in 
this question. 
Teachers’ organizations and many 
others devoted to the aims of the 
newly-established League of Nations, 
campaigned against “the teaching of 
hatred”. They denounced the kind 
of history teaching which glorified 
military conquests. French teachers 
took the lead. The famous ‘writer, 
Anatole France, made a stirring 
appeal: “Make hatred hated... Burn 
the books which teach hate, burn 
us some 
by Herbert Abraham 
them gll. Exalt labour and love.” 
Teachers, who were free to choose 
textbooks for their classes, refused 
to use those found “warlike”. Teach- 
ers and historians from France and 
Germany worked together to agree 
on more Objective accounts of 
issues which had divided the two 
countries: Alsace, for example. All 
through Europe in the 1920's, plans 
for revising school textbooks in the 
interest of peace were propounded, 
adopted and—to a certain extent— 
were acted upon, 
But nationalism took new and 
virulent forms in the 1930’s. The 
friendly exchanges between French 
and German teachers fell foul of Nazi 
racialism, which enlisted textbooks 
as tools for indoctrinating the young. 
The belief that textbooks ought to 
convey truth rather than falsehood 
rose again when the world looked 
forward to peace after the Second 
World War.. Textbook revision was in 
the air; there was the necessity of 
producing new textbooks to replace 
those used in Fascist countries; 
educators in many countries were 
conscious of their responsibility for 
contributing to a peaceful world 
order through education. When 
UNESCO was established, an essential 
part of its programme was to bring 
about a review of textbooks with a 
view to increasing their contribution 
to international understanding. 
The world scene has changed a 
great deal since 1919. No one today 
would use the words of Anatole 
France, even in a crusading speech 
for a good cause. These words “burn 
the books” have an evil ring. The 
temper in which educators approach 
the question today has nothing in it 
of boycott or censorship. If is not a 
question of looking for “offensive” 
passages and demanding. they be 
deleted, nor of getting governments 
to sigh agreements to give fair treat- 
ment to one another in the textbooks. 
One difference between the present 
time and 1919 is that, in fact, history 
books are a great deal better. There 
is nothing new any longer in the idea 
that the study of history should give 
understanding of social, 
economic and cultural life. There is 
no need to crusade against the kind 
of history that consists only of politics 
and battles. Of course, the opinions 
will differ as to whether a given 
textbook goes into too much detail on 
military campaigns, and the like. 
But the general principle is widely 
accepted that past wars should not be 
the main feature of history teaching. 
Historians have added enormously 
to our knowledge of the cultures of 
the past, and this is finding its way 
to the textbooks. Moreover, with the 
experiences of the last two genera- 
tions behind us, and with the 
widespread understanding of the 
perils of the future, not many people 
are disposed to uphold war as a glori- 
ous experience. Overt militarism 
does not sit well with the temper of 
these times. Then, too, the writers 
of textbooks today can build on the 
work done between the two wars. 
No longer seen as 
picturesque ‘natives’ 
HEN French and German histor- 
ians and teachers took up 
again the consideration of his- 
tory textbooks aiter the Second 
World War, they were able to take 
as their starting point conclusions 
that had been reached in consulta- 
tions held fifteen years before. The 
question of giving a balanced and fair 
account of the story of Alsace-Lor- 
raine, for example, was not new to 
them. Of course, there are obvious 
difficulties in reaching agreement on 
ways of treating recent events ‘which 
would not foster hatred, but which, 
at the same time, would not violate 
deeply-held national feelings. But 
taking a long view of history, great 
progress has been made toward pre- 
senting it dispassionately and objec- 
tively. 
While it is true, then, that you may 
sometimes be shocked by finding your 
country presented as a villain in some 
textbooks in other countries, you 
will also sometimes be pleasantly 
surprised by the scrupulous objecti- 
vity and sympathetic understanding 
with which your country’s past is 
presented. 
There is another important differ- 
ence in the scene today. We are 
learning to think on a much larger 
geographic scale. It was still true, 
forty years ago, that when people 
generally thought about the countries 
that “mattered”, they thought chiefly 
of the Western European “Powers”. 
Today, we are learning to take all

peoples into account. Ignorant as 
most of us are of cultures widely 
different from our own we no longer 
look on millions of our fellow human 
beings as more or less picturesque but 
quite unimportant “natives”. 
This situation changes the point of 
view from which we raise questions 
about the teaching of history. It is 
not a question of removing misunder- 
- standing just between a small number 
of great powers. Educators ask 
themselves how they can better 
promote understanding between all 
peoples. They look at history text- 
books with this question in mind. 
They find that the picture of world 
history is distorted by omissions and 
by a biased point of view. 
‘Religious fanatics, 
avid for plunder’ 
Bh point emerged clearly at a 
meeting of history teachers and 
textbook writers ‘which was 
organized by Unesco in 1950. The 
participants from western countries 
had their attention directed—some of 
them no doubt for the first time—to 
the treatment of Moslem history and 
civilization in the western textbooks. 
It was pointed out that textbooks 
emphasized only the warlike quality 
of Islam (“militant, religious fanatics, 
avid for plunder”). Islam and 
Christianity were contrasted—Chris- 
tianity spread through missionaries. 
Islam through . conquests. Islam 
was presented as a menace from 
which Western Europe was fortunately 
saved at the battle of Poitiers. Social 
customs of which the West disapprov- 
ed such as the veiling of ‘women or 
polygamy were presented as religious 
teaching without any reference to- 
their historical setting. While Arab 
contributions to Western civilization 
were mentioned, with stress on the 
transmission of the Greek heritage, 
little or nothing was said of major 
Arab achievements, of the basic ideals 
in which Moslems take a special pride, 
such as freedom and brotherhood, 
absence of race consciousness, the 
care of the poor and of the weak. 
In 1946, a pioneering enquiry was 
made into the treatment of Asia in 
American textbooks. This study led 
to certain interesting conclusions, e.g. 
that the material about Asian ques- 
tions in most of the textbooks under 
consideration was so superficial and 
episodic that pupils had little chance 
of obtaining a coherent picture. 
The conclusions reached in the 
American study are borne out by 
reports that have come to uUNEsco of 
studies made in some European 
countries, 
6 
Unesco will follow up these studies 
by urging Asian countries to look 
carefully at what pictures their 
textbooks present of Western Europe. 
Regardless of whether UNEsco itself 
pursues these enquiries much further, 
these reports will certainly have the 
effect of stimulating contacts and 
discussions among European and 
Asian educators, and of course among 
educators of other countries as well. 
Obviously, the problem of giving a 
better understanding of other peoples 
all over the world cannot be solved by 
adding to the present textbooks 
masses of information about every 
country. It calls for new thinking 
about the ways history should be 
taught and about the selection of 
  
FATHER OF TODAY'S 
TEXTBOOKS 
This medal was struck in Czecho- 
slovakia in 1946 to honour John Amos 
Comenius the first great textbook wri- 
ter of the age of printing. Comenius, 
whose real name was Komensky, was 
born in Eastern Moravia in 1592 and 
died in Amsterdam in 1670. He pro- 
duced schemes for a complete system 
of national education and a series of 
textbooks to serve the system. Nothing 
better than his two principal works, 
Janua Linguarum and Orbis Pictus, was 
produced for more than two centuries. 
Comenius looked forward to the estab- 
lishment of a just and free common- 
wealth of men. That is why the in- 
scription on the reverse side of the 
medal above reads : *“ To a forerunner 
of the United Nations Organization’.     
materials that will arouse interest 
and give basic insight. 
Reference has been made to 
UNEscO’s interest in the improve- 
ment of textbooks for international 
understanding. Again, we may make 
a contrast with the situation in 1919. 
We now have an international organ- 
ization with a definite responsibility 
for promoting education for interna- 
tional understanding, and conse- 
quently some responsibility for 
promoting the improvement of text- 
books and teaching materials for this 
purpose. 
This does not mean that Unesco has 
either the authority or the desire to 
rewrite any country’s textbooks. The 
only people who can improve text- 
books are the people in the country 
which uses them. Unesco’s work 
starts with this as a basic assumption. 
Responsible educators in many 
countries believe that their pupils 
should get a more balanced and more 
objective view of other countries. 
Obviously, they can be helped in their 
thinking - about this by meeting 
educators ‘who are thinking along the 
same lines elsewhere. UNEsco has | 
organized international study confer- 
ences for teachers of history, geogra- 
phy and foreign languages. : 
Unpleasant facts 
are not hushed up 
s a result of one such meeting of 
history teachers held in Brussels 
in 1950, many smaller meetings 
have been held in Western Europe, 
most of these have been bilateral 
meetings—that is, educators from 
two countries have met to talk over 
the way they are presented in each 
others’ textbooks. UNESCO encourages 
this kind of frank and friendly 
exchange. 
At some meetings, historians have 
discussed details which do not strike 
the layman as being particularly 
significant. It must be remembered, 
though, that they are applying in 
these minor cases a general rule 
which is of great importance—that 
whatever gets into the history text- 
book, whether in itself of minor or 
major importance, should be based on 
the best historical scholarship. 
Sometimes the discussions have 
turned on highly controversial issues 
which are charged with intense na- 
tional feeling. The people taking 
part -in such discussions have on 
occasion been wrongly accused in 
their own country of agreeing to 
cover up unpleasant facts in order to 
please a foreign country. There 
have been mistaken fears that these 
meetings may produce some kind of 
official version of history which sacri- 
fices truth in the supposed interest of 
international understanding. 
The facts do not justify these fears. 
At ‘bilateral meetings, the teachers or 
historians bring to each others’ atten- 
tion facts which they think relevant 
and reasons why different interpreta- 
tions are current in their respective 
countries. Sometimes they agree in 
recommending that some neglected 
facts ought to be included in history 
textbooks. Sometimes they recom- 
mend that children should learn that 
different people do in fact interpret 
events differently. 
They all agree that any changes 
that are to be worthwhile and sound- 
ly based, must be made at their own 
free choice by the people who write 
and publish textbooks.

ASIAN HISTORY 
THROUGH WESTERN GLASSES 
Superficial, out of focus,

by Ronald Fenton 
country from his post in India, was talking to his 
son about the American school he would soon join. 
“I'll bet,” he said, “that the world history you will study 
begins in Egypt and Mesopotamia, moves on to Greece by 
way of Crete, takes you through Rome and finally ends 
ap with England and France.” 
“But that isn’t world history,” protested his son, “That 
leaves out three fourths of the world.” “Unhappily,” says 
Chester Bowles, the ambassador who tells this story, *I 
won the bet.” 
What turned out to be true of an American school 
applies equally to schools in other western countries where 
textbooks are still bounded by what one educator terms 
“Occidentalism.” Exactly to what extent the vast conti- 
nent of Asia is given the “cold shoulder” or is shown in 
false perspective has now been revealed by an enquiry 
into history textbooks made by some 25 Western countries 
at UNEscO’s suggestion (1). 
During the past year investigators in each country

THE OTA OTA, a dance in slow rhythm based on the movements of men 
engaged in a duel is performed by menfolk in a Malayan village. Women and 
looked over history books with a series of specific ques- 
tions in mind. These 'were : 
Is the space given to Asian countries (or some of them) 
reasonable, given the subject and scope of the book? 
What are the standards of historical accuracy? Are facts 
given about the main features of Asian culture and the 
great figures of Asian history? Does the book help to an 
understanding of cultural values and the point of view of 
the Asian peoples? Is the impression given that Asia is 
important only as an incidental factor in Western (Euro- 
pean) development ? 
From the reports which have now come in from 
eighteen countries, the answers to these questions add up, 
broadly speaking, to this: the image of Asia as present- 
ed to school children is badly out of focus in nearly all 
countries and, as one report puts it, is “superficial, epi- 
sodic, incomplete and impersonal.” Aspects of cultural, re- 
ligious and intellectual life are commonly neglected and 
even if a few great Asian figures are mentioned, they are 
never convincingly presented. 
The survey is marked by a spirit of frank self-criticism 
which has turned the spotlight on the shortcomings of 
textbooks in regard to Asia. A few countries appear to be 
reasonably satisfied that they give quite sufficient cover- 
age to Asiatic material, while others find it adequate 
considering the aim and scope of their school courses. 
But the majority admit with few reserves that there are 
serious gaps or distortions in their treatment of the most 
important civilizations and peoples of Asia. 
“Very great and often quite unjustified gaps appear in 
all history textbooks.” reports Italy (2). “Certain authors 
limit Indian history to the period of British rule. In some 
books, Chinese history begins in 1895 with the Sino-Japa- 
nese Peace Treaty of Shimonoseki, as if the life of the 
Chinese people had been of little interest until that time. 
(2) Like Cacsar with Gaul, the Italian report divides Asia into 
three parts: (1) Mediterranean’ or secmi-Mediterrancan regions with the 
Assyrians, Hittites, Arabs and Turks. (2) The Northern regions now 
linked to Russian history. (3) India and the Far East. The Italian 
enquiry deals only with the third category, :

Compared with the history of Japan, that of China is 
rushed over hurriedly and its contemporary history is not 
properly explained, nor are the reasons for the present 
evolution dealt with thoroughly.” 
Similar criticisms come from Germany: “Some attempt 
is made to treat the early history of the South, South- 
East and Eastern civilizations. In general, books are si- 
lent about cultures other than those of the north of India 
and China. During the modern era the most important 
place is given to Japan. There is a great variation in the 
treatment of China. Some books consider it as an object 
of the foreign struggle for power, others stress the 
Revolution of 1911 and the national evolution of the inter- 
war period. Facts about India are limited almost exclu- 
sively to a few general references to India’s position and 
importance within the British Empire. In the books 
examined, the whole of the South East Asian region is 
almost entirely neglected.” 
The report summing up the situation in France recog- 
nizes that in primary schools history teaching is center- 
ed on the history of Europe and particularly Western Eur- 
ope. “The place and importance alloted to events and 
civilizations outside Europe is proportional to the rela- 
tionship that they have (apparently, at least) with the

in India therefore lack all background and are introduced 
incoherently. The fact that the population of Indonesia

### 68287: Asian history through Western glasses: superficial, out of focus, fragmentary, distorted

  
A S I A ome books by 
Conti eir titles purpor 
(Continued) to deal with the 
whole Modern 
World, when in fact the Western world: is meant. Apart 
from misleading titles, some books are perhaps providing 
a rather simplified view in suggesting that our culture 
and that of what is called Western civilization has its 
roots only in the Middle East and the Mediterranean 
world. 
“In the books which cover Ancient history there is fre- 
quent omission of the early periods of Asiatic history 
when India and China developed their own civilizations 
and in the books 
dealing with later 
periods internal 
developments in 
these regions are 
rarely mentioned 
apart from inci- 
dental references 
in connexion with 
commercial, or mi- 
litary or colonial 
contacts; while re-

tury developments 
are rarely given 
more than cursory 
attention. 
“There are com-

and later voyagers,

ther references,

common in the 
better books to find some reference to Buddha, Asoka, 
and Confucius, and of our British and European debt to 
early civilizations, including the Indian and Chinese, in 
certain respects. One book notes that China ‘had a settled 
religion and culture many centuries before Christian 
times’, and refers to the patronage by Jenghiz Khan of 
scientists and writers.” 
A report from Poland estimates that between 0,3 % and 
6 % of textbook contents are devoted to the history and 
cultural development of China, India and the Arabian 
peninsular. “We realize”, says the report, “that the space 
alloted to the rich and ancient civilizations of the Asian 
peoples is still too small, and we are at present studying 
means of ‘assigning more importance to this subject in 
the curriculum, without overtaxing the pupils.” 
It is admitted by most of the countries surveyed that 
Asian history is seen almost exclusively from the European 
point of view. The Italian report goes even further, stat-

ing “textbooks ge- 
nerally present 
Asia as one of the 
areas where the 
enterprise and vi- 
gour of European 
nations have been 
most widely exer- 
cized. Only in text- 
books on contem- 
porary history do 
we find any treat- 
ment of Asian 
countries which is 
not linked to Euro- 
pean expansion, 
but even here the 
approach is deci- 
dedly European.” 
This lack of pers- 
pective is also 
mentioned in the 
British report 
which says that 
India and China normally come into the picture only as 
incidental factors in European or national development 
and in relation to the extension of Western influence. 
But in addition to glaring omissions and haphazard 
treatment there is a dangerous tendency to see certain 
people of Asia in terms of sweeping generalizations and 
time-worn clichés. 
Britain, however, reports that while “little positive con- 
tribution is in fact being made towards the understanding 
of Asiatic peoples by the contents of most history text- 
books in common use, on the other hand, except for a few 
prejudiced phrases or distorted references in a number of 
books mostly published a considerable time ago, little is 
done to harm reasonable relationships, ” adding that this 
is so only because so little relevance to the problem is 
in fact being 
covered at all, 
Dealing with the 
same question, the 
[talian survey finds 
that while text- 
book ‘writers can- 
not be accused of 
bias or social pre- 
judice the picture 
given -of Asian 
countries is based 
on common clichés 
which, even if they 
can often be justi- 
fied, could ‘well 
stand revision or 
aft least more 
subtle explanation. 
These are some of 
the examples 
found in Italian 
textbooks:

“China, after reaching a high level of civilization in 
the past, remained sunk in the torpor of its secular 
inertia.” 
Japan : 
The cliché on Japan (the most admired of Asiatic 
countries in Italian history books) is that of “the 
pupil who surpasses the teacher”, the teacher ob-

NTIQUITY, as we get to know 
A it from our school text- 
books, is essentially Medi- 
terranean, and mainly Greek and 
Roman, The existence of the 
early Chinese civilizations, or of 
the 1,500 years of Hindu evolu- 
tion before the birth of Christ— 
in short, the part played by Asia 
in ancient times—is completely 
neglected. Alexander's expedi- 
tion is usually the sole excursion 
that, metaphorically speaking, 
we permit ourselves into the East. 
Our view of the Middle Ages is 
also systematically centred on 
Europe. A few brief allusions to 
Marco Polo and to adventurous 
voyages in Asiatic seas are all 
that we can rely upon to present 
to youthful minds the existence of 
a vast reservoir of human beings 
and unknown civilizations on the 
other side of the ‘world. Our 
Modern History is our modern 
history ; Asia plays but a small 
role in it. Generally speaking, it 
is quite forgotten. If mention is 
sometimes made of South East 
Asia, it is to speak of the Portu- 
guese and Dutch Establishments; 
if India is referred to, it is to 
honour the memory of men such 
.as Suffren or Dupleix. 
ok 
XH 
Only with contemporary history 
does Asia really take shape be- 
fore us ; all our textbooks in 
current use deal more or less 
fully with that Continent. But 
we should say at once that they 
do not usually do so in a syste- 
matie or thorough manner, such 
as would suffice to teach young 
people about the ways of life, the 
economies, the social structures 
and the spiritual, intellectual or 
moral outlook of the Asian peo- 
ples. After reading the princi- 
pal textbooks is use, we can make 
the following observations: 
The history of the Asiatic peo- 
ples is nearly always approached 
from the standpoint of European 
policy and interests. The facts 
related under the heading “Euro- 
pean Expansion in Asia” are 
solely those which serve to 
explain the military or economic 
exploits of European countries. 
x 
*¥ 
The history of Asia is not only 
superficial, but incomplete. Al- 
though Japan—a first-class pow- 
er at the end of the 19th century 
—Iis fairly well known, China is 
less known and India more ne- 
glected still, while Malaya, Korea, 
Mongolia, Burma and the Nether- 
lands East Indies are omitted 
from the picture altogether. 
The human side of history is 
left out of account. The school 
manuals tell us, perhaps, about 
the East India Company and the 
Indian Mutiny; but the Japanese, 
the Asiatic of whatever race, 
continues to remain a closed 
book. The ways of life, the so- 
cial structures, the aspirations of 
these peoples remain veiled from 
us; we learn nothing of their 
standard of living, their level of 
education, the meaning of their 
religions, or their internal ad- 
Ininistration. The colonial and 
imperialist tradition of nineteen- 
th-century Europe is palpable in 
these pages; it is, therefore, not 
as citizens of the world that we 
discover the Continent of Asia, 
A certain number of the text- 
books in use do not pursue their 
subject beyond the year 1914. A 
special study is sometimes devot- 
ed to Japan, but the rest of Asia 
is left in obscurity. 
The following general picture 
may therefore be drawn: 
1. The whole aspect of Human 
History, so far as Ancient Times 
and the Middle Ages are concern- 
ed, is liable to be falsified by 
almost complete ignorance of the 
principal centres of the civiliza- 
tion of Asia.

As a result of a suggestion from Unesco that Western countries

information their pupils are getting about Asia, the Belgian Federa- 
tion of History Teachers carried out three special studies. Below, 
we publish their main conclusions which show crisply and frankly a 
situation that is unfortunately typical of most Western countries 
today. The findings do not necessarily express the views of the Bel- 
gian Government or the Belgian National Commission for Unesco. 
2. Contemporary Asiatic his- 
tory is so presented as to encour- 
age an approach to current 
Eastern problems with the men- 
tality, almost, of a person living 
at the end of the 19th century. 
3. We know too little of the 
inner life of these peoples, and of 
their economic circumstances. 
4. Only the great political issues 
of concern to Europe are studied; 
nothing without a European 
context exists. 
5. It might be desirable that 
every Asian country should be 
given a place in our Contempor- 
ary History, and that we should 
be briefly documented on the so- 
~ cial, moral, intellectual, spiritual, 
economic and artistic evolution of 
the great Asiatic centres, past 
and present. 
6. In view of the current 
reawakening of Asia, it is more 
than ever important that our 
school textbooks should deal with 
the history of that Continent and 
its development since 1918. It 
would be desirable for them to 
include a treatment of topical 
problems-—a delicate matter, 
which the popular press is so 
ready to serve up to young minds 
that are uninstructed or inexper- 
ienced in these questions.

In conelusion: 
From the majority of textbooks 
in use, it is apparent that, despite 
their authors’ evident attempts at 
objectivity, little space is devot- 
ed to Asian countries in these 
books; Asian history is seen al- 
most exclusively from the Euro- 
pean standpoint ; these peoples 
remain little known, since their 
dealings with other countries 
teach us nothing about them: 
our view of Asia remains frag- 
mentary and biased, and though 
“modern” Europe may be fami- 
liar to us, Asia is certainly not.

Thus it managed to rival the most advanced nations 
of the West.” 
“With amazing speed, the Japanese people accepted 
European civilization, or rather, superimposed on its 
ancient ways the products of Western mechanized 
civilization.” 
As has already been noted, most Western history text- 
books tend to judge Asian people according to a completely 
Occidental code. The following paragraph from the re- 
port based on Italian textbooks could apply to almost all 
Western nations : The ability to adapt to European ideas 
and techniques is considered a mark of merit. Proof of 
the intelligence and educability of a people Is sometimes 
seen in the skill with which it “Europeanizes” itself. . A 
country which has adopted a political structure on Euro- 
pean lines is considered to be really “civilized”. Some- 
times the impression is given that European expansion 
can never be regarded as anything else but a good thing. 
Patronizing, pitying, attitudes 
RIOR to Unesco’s international investigation, the first 
P and probably the most meticulous attempt to disco- 
ver what schoolchildren have been taught about Asia 
and the Far East was made in the United States just ten 
years ago. This study led to a number of general conclu- 
sions which are worth recalling today: 
@ The wide variations in Asiatic cultures are often 
submerged in uniform generalities. The great 
personages of Asian history are virtually ignored. 
© The treatment of Asia in most textbooks is so epi- 
sodic and references are so light and scattered 
that pupils are not likely to assemble them in 
any coherent pattern. 
# Backwardness in industrial development is too 
often left to mean backwardness in every aspect 
of development. 
# Stereotyped phrases are commonly used, e.g. 
“backward peoples of the Orient” ; “natives” ; 
“uncivilized” ; “white man’s burden”. 
«© In U.S. history there is rarely a single, relatively 
full account of American relations 
with Asia : the material is scatter- 
ed and unintegrated. 
@ Asia’s place in contemporary 
affairs receives insufficient atten- 
tion. 
In general, the 1946 study of Asia 
in American textbooks found that 
few statements directly engender- 
ed objectionable attitudes in the 
minds of young readers. But stu- 
dents saw the culture, civilization and 
standards of living of the peoples of 
the East only through the Western 
eyeglasses of a highly industrialized 
civilization. This often created in 
boys and girls a feeling of superiority 
and a patronizing, pitying attitude. 
A new report, submitted to UNESCO 
by the U.S. Office of Education in 
January of this year, paints some- 
thing of a brighter picture and finds 
the general situation “encourag- 
ing”. Appraising what has happen- 
ed in the past decade, it notes in- 
creasing attention to Asian coun- 
tries in study courses, and a general 
awareness of the need for more 
teaching about Asia in teachers’ 
discussion groups and publications. 
Talks with textbook authors and a 
look at the textbooks themselves 
show that progress has been made 
in certain directions. Statements 
that are derogatory to Asians, stereo- 
types which were commonly used, 
expressions such as “barbarian”, 
“uncivilized”, “backward people" 
‘Europeanization’ equals ‘civilization’ 
have largely disappeared from textbooks. Editors and 
publishers are trying to stress the similarities between 
Asian and Western peoples rather than the differences. 
Much perplexity seems to exist however as to where the 
study of Asia should start, whether recent history should 
be stressed, or the Golden Age, or the earlier origins of 
Asian peoples and cultures. On the other hand, many 
history teachers still feel very strongly that European 
history should receive the greatest emphasis since it 
serves as a background for understanding American civi- 
lization. If Islamic history is given new treatment it is 
often because it is seen as the chapter in Asian history 
which most touches the history of Europe. ; . 
The U.S. report concludes on a half-pessimistic, half- 
optimistic note. “Changes come slowly and pressures for 
the status quo are strong”, it admits, “yet some action 
and change can be detected.” 
The difficulties all Western nations are encountering 
in their sincere attempts to improve the treatment of 
Asia in their textbooks are as varied as their teaching 
syllabuses are different. The geographical situation of a 
country, its historical position and relationships, its views 
as to the nature, scope and purpose of education generally 
and of history teaching in particular, are all important 
factors that cannot be lightly brushed aside. Yet despite 
these great differences, each nation, in its own way, can 
do much to promote a better understanding of Asia in the 
classroom. The surveys in fact make a number of 
suggestions which textbook authors might consider when 
revising their books or preparing new ones. 
The French report goes much further and raises a 
fundamental question. Referring to history teaching in 
primary schools where, it says, “the place given to Asia 
is extremely reduced in every respect”, it explains that 
this situation reflects the present syllabus requirements 
and asks whether a complete reorganization of history 
teaching at this level should not be undertaken. Like 
the Belgian, Swedish and German reports it calls for the 
inclusion of more civilizations and regions of Asia in the 
teaching syllabus regardless of whether they have had 
special contacts with the West. At present each Western 
nation seems to concentrate on a specific region, e. g.

Some countries, like Belgium, Germany and the U.S.A.,

hardly pause to mention the great men of Asia. Those 
most usually named are conquerors while poets, writers 
and thinkers are neglected.” 
@ The great Asian civilizations should be presented as 
integral wholes along with the life and cultural traditions 
of peoples both before and after colonial conquest. 
Asians should not be presented as living in static commu- 
nities, unable to develop without the inspiration of West- 
ern contact. Accounts should be given of the real levels 
of independent civilization achieved without Western 
influence as well as the specific contributions of Asia to 
human progress. :

be given of a controversial issue (U.S.A. Britain), others 
that a “correct interpretation” be given (Poland).

It was widely pointed out that to obtain worthwhile 
results greater use should be made of supplementary 
materials —more and better wallmaps and charts, back- 
ground books, anthologies and booklists—in conjunction 
with improved textbooks. Many countries feel that not 
enough use is being made of materials such as trans- 
lations of classical and contemporary Asian literature, 
pictures of art, sculpture and architecture, illustrations of 
living conditions and cultural activities, nor are enough 
schools benefitting from the facilities, offered by libraries, 
museums and art galleries as ‘well as 
by the mass media teaching aids like 
films, film-strips, radio and television. 
It is obvious that textbooks and 
school courses cannot be modified 
with a flick of the wrist. The pro- 
blem cannot be solved by simply 
adding masses of facts for which 
there would be no room either in 
school curricula or textbooks. In 
many countries improvements, realis- 
tically speaking, can be hoped for 
only in terms of a broader awareness, 
a wider outlook and a balanced atti- 
tude toward Asia on the part of the 
teacher, made possible through his 
continued studies and his use of bet-

material, 
In May of this year, teachers and 
historians from Western countries "will 
be meeting at Unesco’s headquar- 
ters in Paris to study these and other 
suggestions in the light of all the sur- 
veys made and their own experience. 
They will have to consider what basic 
facts and ideas are really important 
for an understanding of the Asian 
people and how these can best be 
presented in the classroom. 
Their work will form a basis for 
future exchanges between Western 
and Eastern educators, and will be a 
stepping stone to a second Unesco 
study in which, this time, Asian 
countries will be asked to take a look 
at the picture their textbooks present 
of Western countries.

CC appy, what's the good of history?” With this ques- 
D tion, put by a small boy to a father who was a 
historian, the French historian, Marc Bloch, began 
his remarkable essay, Apologie pour histoire, ou Métier 
d’historien. As Bloch observed, the small boy in his 
apparently naive enquiry had with the embarrassing 
directness of youth raised a fundamental question. -What 
is the use of historical study in a practical world ? It is 
a question that strikes with double force the thousands 
of men and women whose daily task it is to teach history 
to children of all ages in the schools of the world. 
Bloch and other eminent historians of many lands have 
argued cogently that history is a study worthy of the 
adult mind, opening a door to wisdom and tolerance and 
a power of profound criticism. 
History can satisfy in a unique way the growing child's 
curiosity about other people, about their lives, per- 
sonalities, deeds and ideas; and it can awaken an 
imaginative wonder and excitement about the whole 
world of humanity past and present. History can develop 
an understanding of the cultural heritage of mankind, 
or provide a measure of background knowledge for the 
appreciation of literature, art and ways of life of other 
people. In the realm of intellectual discipline, the study 
of history can train pupils to be accurate in comprehen- 
sion and expression, to weigh evidence, to separate the 
trivial from the significant, to distinguish between pro- 
© paganda and truth. 
Rich harvest from classroom seeds 
standards of reference against which to measure 
values and achievements of their own age; it can 
encourage an enlightened awareness of the problems of 
modern communities, political, social and economic. Not 
least important, it can train men to handle controversial 
questions in a spirit which searches for truth, insists on 
free discussion, and permits compromise. This is a rich 
harvest for any school subject to yield. No teacher of 
history would maintain that he can do more than sow 
some of its seeds and nourish them so long as his pupils 
are still at school. But he will assert confidently that the 
seeds are worth the sowing. 
There can be little doubt that the majority of history 
teachers the world over, called on to justify their work, 
would find common ground in a single concept—that of 
training for national citizenship. The child is one day

to vote, perhaps to serve in the army, to pay taxes, to 
take a part great or small in the working life of his 
native land, to carry out the duties of a citizen. One of 
the special functions of history teaching in schools 
therefore has been to help to develop in children a love 
of their own country, and an understanding of its tra- 
ditions and ways of life ; how the homeland has become 
united or has freed itself from foreign rulers, how its 
system of government has come into being, what are its 
distinctive customs and traditions, what changes have 
taken place in its economic and social life, and so on. 
A survey of history curricula in the schools of the 
majority of member states of UNEsco reveals that the 
teaching of national history predominates at every stage 
of the school course, and is as evident in countries with 
a decentralized school system as in those where national 
- control of education is far-reaching. 
This is understandable and reasonable. But the citizen 
these days must concern himself with problems that 
transcend national frontiers. For men now live on a 
globe which is shrinking and a world which is fast 
becoming a closely interrelated unit. Nation is dependent 
on nation as never before. This dependence, clear in the 
friendly intercourse of peacetime, has been driven into 
men’s minds and hearts by the terrible argument of war. 
Men must learn to live together, and the two world wars 
of this century have brought in their train the first 
zlaborate attempts to establish permanent international 
organizations in the political field, the League of Nations 
and the United Nations. The League did not endure ; 
U.N. remains, embodying the political concept of the 
twentieth century, that of constructive co-operation 
between the nations of the world. 
In the teaching of the past, historical truth has often 
been sacrificed in the interests of national pride, and 
history has often been distorted in order to arouse 
patriotic emotions. Children have often been left with 
the idea that contacts between nations in different parts 
of the world are invariably connected, directly or 
indirectly, with war. The chauvinist has made history 
serve the pMrposes of nationalism ; the history textbook, 
with its unavoidable generalizations and its necessary 
simplifications, has frequently been turned into a power- 
ful instrument of this nationalism. (1). 
Certainly, in the last 50 years, the teaching of history 
in many countries has greatly improved, in this as in 
many other respects ; some textbooks have become more

### 68290: Daddy, what's the good of history?'

" strenuous efforts of millions of 
the past has made other countries what they are, just as 
it has made their own what it is. 
History properly taught can help men to become critic- 
al and humane, just as wrongly taught it can turn them 
into bigots and fanatics. For the child can begin to 
develop, even from an elementary historical training, 
qualities and attitudes of mind which all aid interna- 
tional understanding. He can acquire an abiding interest 
in the lives and achievements of peoples outside his 
own homeland and realize what they have contributed 
o the 
learn to be accurate and critical and grasp the idea of 
change as a factor in human affairs. 
The cause of international understanding benefits yet 
further when children reach adulthood knowing 
something of the causes and results of past human 
conflicts, and something of the history of man’s efforts 
towards international co-operation, and when the 
history they have learned teaches them both about the 
growing interdependence of nations and about the 
individual men to 
establish human freedoms. 
Few would deny that international understanding is 
a desirable result of history teaching, and that the 
teacher who strives to promote it is pursuing a laudable 
end. But many will ask whether history which has 
formerly been focused on national concerns is now to be 
distorted to serve international ends. The answer is 
emphatically “no”. There may be teachers who believe 
that by omitting or by glossing over the wars and in- 
ternational rivalries of the past .they will thereby 
promote the spread of international understanding in 
. the present ; but surely they are very few. This would 
be a fallacious practice, educating the child to unreality: 
peace is not gained by pretending wars have not existed. 
Champollion and the Rosetta Stone 
HAT principles might guide the teacher to select 
materials which would contribute to international 
understanding? Some suggestions on this score 
have been advanced by a committee of eight experts, pro- 
fessional historians and teachers of history, at the request 
of Unesco. These suggested principles are as follows: 
The search for truth: “History is a record of a people's 
past based on a critical examination of documents and 
other “acts. The essentials of this historical method 
are not beyond the grasp of even young children. Con- 
crete examples, such as thé story of the Rosetta stone, 
which enabled Champollion to establish the first prin- 
ciples of the deciphering of Egyptian hieroglyphics, vivid- 
ly illustrate the fundamental processes involved. This 
search for the facts can be used to illustrate one side of 
search for historic truth. 
“The other side is the truth of historic interpretation. 
The facts cannot be changed, but the interpretation of 
them can and does change. An explanation of ar- 
chaeological techniques (excavation and research are 
going on in most countries) will demonstrate how the 
past can be investigated, what facts archaeological re- 
mains can reveal and what interpretations can be placed 
upon them. If children can be brought to appreciate 
the distinction between the objectivity of facts and the 
inevitable subjectivity of interpretation, an invaluable 
lesson will have been learnt. They will be less likely in 
adult life to fall victims to propaganda.” 
History as an evolutionary process: “Pupils should be 
helped to realize that history is an account of an evolu- 
tionary process, that man has conquered the world by 
slow degrees and re-fashioned it to fit his needs; that 
technological advances, to which peoples all over the 
world have contributed, have accelerated the evolution of 
human societies; that civilizations have developed, ma- 
tured, and died, to be replaced by new civilizations which 
have always preserved some part of the heritage left by 
those who had gone before. History should not be pre- 
sented as if it were static. On the contrary, it is a dyna- 
mic story of continual change. Pupils should be helped 
to appreciate the unity of history, and not to view it as a 
broken pattern of stories which they are all too likely 
to equate with tales of adventure.” 
Mutual influence among Nations and Peoples: “In this 
connexion children can be shown that races and nations 
have never really lived in complete isolation from each 
other. In technology, politics, culture and philosophy, 
common cultural inheritance of man ; he can. 
The Unesco Courier. — March 1956 
there have been constant exchanges, borrowings ana 
mutual influences. Teachers should make a point of 
seeking out examples of interchanges of this kind from 
their national history. In order to develop a sense of 
the interdependence of nations and to avoid encouraging 
unwarranted feelings of superiority, what their own 
country has received should be recognized as frankly as 
what has been contributed to others.” 
Importance of eeonomic and social factors: “The eco- 
nomic history of the past is still far from complete, but 
the patient work of historians is gradually bearing fruit. 
Today many school textbooks give considerable attention 
to economic and social factors, and in most countries 
sufficient information is now available to enable teachers 
to show their pupils how important these factors have 
been at all periods of human history. The struggle for 
food and shelter, the bartering of goods, and the growth 
of means of communication can be easily appreciated 
even by quite young children. In this way a good basis 
can be given for a later understanding of the complex 
economic problems of our time.” 
Importance of intellcctual and moral factors: “Intel- 
lectual and moral currents of thought have probably had 
as great an influence on history as have economic and 
social factors. Regardless of frontiers, they have in- 
fluenced millions of men and women throughout the 
world and inspired them to action. These factors should 
be brought home to children.” 
The struggle for tolerance and peace: “Throughout 
history there has been a time-lag between moral and 
material progress. Pupils should be helped to understand 
why this has been so and to see that not only the desire 
for power of rulers, politiclans and national cliques, but 
also ignorance, intolerance mutual distrust and the pre- 
judice and selfishness of groups and individuals have been 
responsible. Moreover, intolerance has contributed both 
to civil and to national wars. In many countries, exam- 
ples can be taken from national history to show that 
intolerance and prejudices have been successfully over- 
come s0 that former enemies can live together in peace. 
“At a suitable age, children must learn that war has - 
brought in its train not only death for millions of soldiers 
and civilians, men and women, children and old people, 
but also incalculable suffering and destruction of which 
the defeated have never been the only victims. War has 
frequently caused serious damage, or has brought utter 
ruin in a brief space of time—a few years, months, days, 
even a few seconds—to the results of centuries of human 
effort, the achievements of generations of architects, 
sculptors, painters, engineers and technicians, craftsmen, 
peasants and labourers of all kinds.” 
If history is taught in the light of principles such as 
these, children should be better able to see for them- 
selves how important it is to try to understand their 
fellow-citizens and the citizens of other nations and to 
help in the struggle of mankind against prejudice, intol- 
erance and selfishness.

  IN THE CENTRE 


### 68616: In the centre of the map; nations see themselves as the hub of history

OF THE MAP 
Nations see themselves 
as the hub of history 
    
  
by Marshall G.S. Hodgson 
N the sixteenth century the Italian missionary, Matteo 
Ricci, brought to China a European map of the world 
showing the new discoveries in America. The Chinese 
were glad to learn about America, but one point in the 
map offended them. Since it split the earth’s surface 
down the Pacific, China appeared off at the right-hand 
edge; whereas the Chinese thought of themselves as 
literally the “Middle Kingdom”, which should be in the 
centre of the map. Ricci pacified them by drawing 
another map, splitting the Atlantic instead, so that China 
appeared more central; and maps are still commonly 
drawn that way in that part of the world. 
"Europeans of course have clung to the first type of map, 
showing Europe in the upper centre; while the commonest 
maps in North America show the U.S.A. in that post of 
honour, even at the cost of splitting a continent in two. 
The temptation not only to put one’s own land in the 
centre of the map, but one’s own people in the centre 
of history, seems to be universal. 
The most famous case of this is indeed that of the 
“Middle Kingdom”. Many Chinese used to suppose that 
the Temple of Heaven at the Emperor's capital, Peking, 
marked the exact centre of the earth's surface. To be 
sure, Chinese scholars even in the Middle Ages were 
aware that China could not be said to be mathematically 
central; they knew the general lay of Europe and Africa 
and the Indian Ocean, and a writer could remark that 
the “centre” of the earth was along the equator. Never- 
theless, even for sober historians the pivotal fact of 
. human history was the condition of the great Chinese 
empire, in which was concentrated all the splendour of 
polished civilization. 
At times that empire was strong. Then (as they told it) 
the Emperor was able to command peace among the fair 
lands stretching out around his capital ; the choicest 
products of the mountains on the one hand and the sea 
on the other poured in to enrich the vast fertile plains of 
the empire; and the barbarians of the less favoured lands 
beyond—deserts, mountains, and remote islands—divided 
and weakened by the Emperor's wise policies, came to 
bring humble tribute and to learn what they could of the 
arts of civilization. : 
Thus came the Koreans, the Japanese, the Tibetans ; 
thus came also the English from their distant islands, 
seeking Chinese luxuries and offering little in return the 
Emperor could approve—such as opium. Even the English 
envoys were graciously received, but when they showed 
want of proper respect for the Emperor they were 
dismissed with contempt. 
At other times the imperial power grew feeble, local 
rulers seized power and tyrannized the people, prosperity 
- faded. It was then (as they told it) that the barbarians 
came as insulting conquerors, and civilization was eclipsed 
in the world. Thus came the Central Asian Turks, thus 
came the Mongols under Kublai Khan; and thus came 
the English when the Manchu dynasty was declining, 
invading the Middle Kingdom (whose wealth attracted 
every barbarous nation), and forcing their crude ways 
upon the people. 
It could in fact be claimed that for a time China was 
16 
 
the wealthiest and most populous, the most aesthetically 
cultivated and even the most powerful state on the earth; 
put when this fact was made the basis for the Chinese 
picture of the world, the result was tragic miscalculation. 
For the medieval Hindu the world was a place for the 
purification of souls. Kings and their empires came and 
went, the gods themselves arose and perished—time was 
infinite, space immense, with unlimited opportunity for 
every soul to reap in birth after rebirth what it had sown. 
“In much of the universe, indeed, souls dwelt in untroubled 
bliss; it was the distinction of our own toiling, earthy 
regions that here men could choose responsibly between 
good and evil and.their consequences. Here life was 
arranged for the exercise of virtue, each caste of men 
having its own function in society; if a man fulfilled one 
role well, in another life he would have a higher role to 
play, and might eventually rise beyond the transient - 
vicissitudes of existence altogether. 
Accordingly, so far as history was significant, it was as 
ages varied in the degree to which society was well 
enough ordered to give virtue its due place. As a given 
cosmic cycle wore on, disorder increased and justice faded. 
Our own age (they explained) was in the latter part of 
such a cycle ; only in the central parts of the earthy re- 
gions—in India, that is—was society still well ordered : 
there Brahmins still offered sacrifices and the other 
castes ruled or served according to their status. 
In the benighted lands to the east and west—so tainted 
already with decline that pious Brahmins dared not set 
foot there—souls were doomed to be born as barbarous 
Mlecchas; there they lived unhallowed lives till they 
should earn the right to be born in India. As our degen- 
erate age drew on, even in India itself the social order 
was upset, rulers rose from the basest castes, and finally 
even Mlecchas entered as conquerors—Muslims from the

west, and even the remotest Europeans. Through all this 
outward humiliation, however, the Hindu could know that - 
there in the central lands where the sacred Ganges 
flowed he could still live the way of truth and holiness— 
inaccessible to lesser breeds of men—and aspire to the 
highest degrees of rebirth. : 
To the medieval Muslim the world looked very different 
‘from what it did to his Chinese or to his Hindu 
contemporaries. History was not a matter of the 
varying strength and weakness of an imperial centre of 
authority and civilization, nor was it a passing incident in 
an infinite succession of worlds. Rather it was the story 
of a single species created just some 5,000 years ago by 
God to do His will once for all. From Adam on, God had 
sent thousands of prophets to the various peoples, bring- 
ing to each its laws and sciences; at last he sent Mo- 
hammed, proclaiming the final law in which all earlier 
truth was perfected and which was gradually to prevail 
over the whole world, replacing all former laws. 
Many Muslims believed that Mohammed's birthplace, 
Mecca, was the centre of the earth’s surface. To Mecca, 
men pilgrimaged yearly from the farthest parts of the 
earth, and it was supposed that in the heavens above it 
the angels themselves performed worship ; here was the 
very throne of God, where heaven and earth were nearest. 
To be sure, scholars knew that the earth was a sphere, 
and God equally present everywhere in the hearts of the 
believers. But their more sober picture of the world was 
equally effective in supporting the eminence of Islam. 
They thought of the inhabited quarter of the globe as a 
land mass lying between the equator and the North Pole, 
and between the oceans to the ‘west and to the east— 
roughly Eurasia and northen Africa. 
This was divided into seven “climes” from (Cont’d on

FROM THE FIRST 
KNOWN WORLD 
ATLAS 
The most important attempt of the ancient 
world to place the study of geography on a 
scientific basis was made by Claudius Ptolemy, 
celebrated mathematician, astronomer and 
geographer of Alexandria. His Geographia, 
written in Greek around 140 A.D. comprised 
eight books which included a general map 
of the known world and twenty-seven maps 
covering different countries. Ptolemy's ori- 
ginal work written on papyrus, has not sur- 
vived but copies were made, the oldest dating 
from the |3th century. In 1886 a manuscript 
was discovered in the monastery at Mount 
Athos, Greece, which included a reproduction 
of Ptolemy's original world-map. The section 
of this manuscript containing the map (left) 
is now in the British Museum. The Geographia 
was printed for the first time in a Latin transla- 
tion together with maps in Italy in the latter 
part of the 15th century. Its contents, how- 
ever, had already become known in Western 
Europe through manuscript copies, and their 
study influenced map-making in two ways, 
They led firstly to the addition of degree lines 
to maps and secondly to the compilation of 
new maps of countries which had been inade- 
quately represented by Ptolemy. The map 
above is a reproduction of an engraving on 
copper made in Rome in 1478 by a German, 
Arnold Bucking and published by another 
German, Conrad Schweinheim, the same year.

IN THE CENTRE OF THE MAP 
(Continued)     
Muslims writing in the latitude of Syria or Iran explained 
that in the hot south men grew lazy and so remained 
backward in civilization; and likewise in the far north 
where it was too cold—in northern Europe, for instance— 
men’s skins were pallid and their minds sluggish. Hence 
it was that only in the central, moderate climes, like the 
Mediterranean lands or Iran, were minds most active and 
civilization most advanced ; from there the blessings of 
Islam were gradually being brought even to the remotest . 
areas, among the Negroes in the hot south and the white 
men in the cold north, 
World histories written by medieval Muslims, might 
therefore, have a preliminary section on the older Per-. 
sians, Hebrews, and Romans; but, from the time of Mo- 
hammed, the modern part of the history dealt almost 
exclusively with the Islamic peoples. Other peoples might 
be curious in their quaint ways ; the Chinese might be 
clever at gadgets, and the Greeks at philosophy ; but 
now the only peoples whose story really counted were 
those who had abandoned their old local creeds with 
their many idols or their many saints’ images and joined 
in the imageless worship of the One God, in the interna- 
tional brotherhood of Islam which, advancing fartner 
every year, already stretched 
from the straits of Gibraltar 
to those of Malacca.’ 
thousands of years and is still a newcomer, we have had 
to rethink our situation. The great ideals of faith and of 
culture have to be seen in spiritual terms rather than as 
reflected in the very map of the universe. 
The West-Europeans were the first to be really faced 
with the new discoveries and have consequently led the 
way toward creating a new picture of the world. But 
they have not yet escaped the temptation to make geo- 
graphy and history centre upon themselves. One need 
only examine the table of contents of any proper Western 
“world history”. Civilization began in Mesopotamia and 
Egypt. (with perhaps some local variants in India and 
China); but (it would seem) soon history was almost a 
monopoly of the Greeks ; and though other peoples might 
still be curious, in their quaint ways, hereafter it was 
really only Europe that counted—and after the rise of 
Rome only Western Europe; here was the home of truth 
and liberty. 
If during long centuries it was hard to find either truth 
or liberty in Western Europe, this period ‘was regretfully 
labelled the Dark Ages of mankind; but in modern times 
the West-Europeans have duly gone forth to enlighten 
(and subdue) the world—so that the history of a hence- 
forth “Westernized” world may be safely reduced almost 
to that of the West itself. 
The map of the world is constructed accordingly. 
Westerners distinguish five or six “continents”: Africa, 
Asia, North and South America—and Europe. It is some- 
. times ingenuously remarked 
how much smaller Europe is 
than the “other continents” 
The West-Europeans of 
the same age had many of 
the same ideas of history 
and geography as the 
Muslims, getting them from 
the same Greek and Hebrew 
sources ; but their interpret- 
ation was very different. 
For them history was the 
story of God’s progressive 
dispensations of law or of 
grace to his favoured people. 
Out of the descendants of 
Adam, God has first chosen 
the Hebrews, but with the 
coming of Christ it was a 
“new Israel”, the Christians, 
that received His favours. 
Even among the Christ- 
ians God. had made a 
further selection — casting 
aside those of the Levant 
and Greece as heretics or   
  
HOW ANCIENT HINDUS 
SAW THE UNIVERSE 
According to an ancient Hindu conception of the 
universe, the world was supported on the backs 
of several elephants, standing on a giant turtle. 
The cosmos is depicted here by a snake, the Naga.. 
—yet in political discussions, 
in grouping statistics, or in 
historical comparisons these 
divisions repeatedly recur as 
if fixed by nature 
In European “world 
atlases” each European 
country has its own map, 
with the rest of the world 
in a few pages at the end. 
The map ordinarily selected 
to show the world as a whole 
is ideally suited to reinforce 
this way of seeing mankind. 
On the Mercator world map 
not only is Europe in the 
upper centre : it is repre- 
sented as a good deal larger 
than the other great culture 
areas. Most of these lie 
south of the fortieth 
parallel, while Europe is 
almost wholly north of it, 
where Mercator’s projection   schismatics, in favour of the 
West-Europeans under the 
Pope at Rome. The favoured 
people of each age lived under a succession of great 
monarchies : in earlier times Chaldean, Persian, and 
Greek, which all conquered the Hebrews; but last and 
greatest, under which Christ Himself was born, the 
empire of Rome in the west, which should endure till 
Judgment Day. 
The West-Europeans allowed. that the centre of the 
world’s surface was Jerusalem (by exaggerating the length 
of the Mediterranean, their maps could show Spain and 
China as equally distant from it); but they assured 
themselves that, just as at the beginning of history 
Paradise was in the east where the sun rises, so in these 
latter days the centre of God’s vicarship on earth was in 
the west, where the sun sets ; henceforth Rome was the 
centre of all authority, spiritual and temporal. 
In modern times all these medieval pictures of the 
world have vanished, or been modified. With the discov- 
ery of America and the circumnavigation of the globe, 
the discovery that Earth is a tiny planet in an immensity 
of space, that mankind has been upon it hundreds of 
begins to exaggerate the size 
of things enormously. 
Accordingly even on the world map, which oughi to 
provide a sense of proportion, there is space to name a 
great many places in Europe, while in other populous 
centres like India or China, shown on a much smaller 
scale, only a few chief places need be indicated. Although 
_ equal-area projections of the world have long been avail- 
able, in which shapes as well as sizes are much less 
distorted, Westerners understandably cling to a projection 
which so markedly flatters them. They explain (as if 
they were engaged in nothing but sailing) that the true 
angles given on the Mercator map are of convenience to 
navigators ; and in atlases and wall-maps, in books of - 
reference and in newspapers, when Westerners turn to see 
what the world looks like as a whole their preconceptions 
are authoritatively gratified. 
The story is often told of a small tribe whose word for 
“mankind” was the name for the tribe itself. Other tribes 
were merely incidental in their picture of the world— 
perhaps not even fully human. Chinese, Hindus, Mus- 
lims, and Westerners alike have smiled perhaps too 
quickly at the rather perilous naiveté of that small tribe.

### 68616: In the centre of the map; nations see themselves as the hub of history

ONE OF THE OLDEST CHRISTIAN 'WORLD-MAPS This is how Beatus, a geographer and mank at the monastery of Valcavado, Spain, depicted the known world in 776 A.D. Considered to be one of the oldest Christian world-maps, it was attached to his Com- mentaria in Apocalypsin and was probably intended to illustrate the distribution of the apostolic missions throughout the world. It has survived only in ten copies, varying in date from the 9th to the [3th century. The one shown here, made at the monastery of St. Sever in France around 1030 A.D., the most valuable, is now in the collection of the Bibliothéque Nationale, in Paris. The earthly paradise is shown at the east of the known world (right of map). The adjoining inscription Gens Seres (The silk people), is Beatus’s description for the Chinese. Beatus has represented mountain chains by markings with sawlike edges. Like earlier geographers he sees the world as anisland in a circumfluous ocean filled with fishes and islands.

### 68617: A Warning against deodorized history

A warning against 
DEODORIZED 
HISTORY 
by D.W. Brogan 
N the second week of January, 1956, the Historical 
Association of Great Britain celebrated its fiitieth 
anniversary. It celebrated it in two ways, by discuss- 
ing problems of research, teaching and what the French 
call “vulgarisation” and by discussing the impact of history, 
that is, of historical teaching and writing on society. 
That in turn led to a discussion of the always topical, 
always important question of the 
treatment of history in schools; its 
dangers and its possibilities. 
The problem can be briefly stated. 
One phenomenon of the nineteenth 
and twentieth centuries has been the TN 
rise of nationalism. The 
growth of nationalist feeling and 
spread of nationalist doctrine may 
not have been the sole cause of the 
great wars from which the world is 
still suffering, but - nationalism is 
certainly one of the causes; its growth 
one of the present dangers. It is 
also a fact that nationalism, however 
deep an emotion, however legitimate 
a doctrine, has been aided in its 
progress (if that is the word) by the 
concurrent spread of general literacy, 
by the creation of systems of educa- 
tion which had for one of their 
primary objects, the teaching of a 
national version of history, either of 
the history of a nation or of the 
history of the world. 
So remote and 
innocuous 
U NTIL recently, indeed, until after 
the first world ‘war, the idea 
that there could be any other kind of history 
teaching in schools would have seemed scandalous. The 
object of history teaching was just to provide a factual 
basis for nationalist feeling, to give to the boys and girls 
brought into the state school system a body of organized 
knowledge of the past of their nation and of its relations 
with the outside world, not a vague, neutral, merely 
academic body of knowledge, but a concrete ‘“useful” 
nationalist view of the nation and the world. 
All educational systems aimed at this; all achieved a

great deal of success in their aim. It would not be too 
much to say that, before 1914, if it had been found that 
French and German boys had been given the same picture 
of a Franco-German controversy, it would have been felt, 
on both sides of the Rhine, that the teachers had failed 
miserably in their manifest duty. The object of history- 
teaching was not to teach neutral views but to reinforce 
natural, i.e. national, feeling. 
Of course, some of this nationalist 
teaching 'was remote and so inno- 
cuous. At school in Scotland during 
the first war, I was taught a great 
deal about the wickedness of King 
, Edward I of England and about the 
absurdity of his claims to be overlord 
of Scotland. But King Edward I died 
in 1307 and such teaching did not 
seriously distort the mind, although 
it may have wasted school time. It 
was very different "when German 
schoolboys were told more than once 
of the burning of the castle of Hei-

castle of Saint-Cloud by the Germans. 
‘Burning’ questions 
of the war of 1812 
HESE were, if not recent events, 
living in artificially fostered me- 
mories. An American schoolboy, 
told of the burning of the White 
House, but not of the burning of the 
parliament building of Upper Canada 
in what is now Toronto, was likely to 
be at cross purposes with a Canadian 
who had received a different version 
of the war of 1812. (An English schoolboy would be under 
another disadvantage ; he would not know of either.) 
It would be easy to multiply examples of such artificially 
fostered historical memories and historial disputes. Some- 
times, the disputes were not entirely artificial. If there 
was a certain amount of historical bickering between 
the scholars of the Netherlands and of Belgium 
after the first war, there 'was also a genuine controversy 
over the regime of the Scheldt. 
But, for the most part, historical argument was

directed to backing up not only a specific national 
position, but a general national position, too often to 
stiffening the national morale against a permanent and 
dangerous enemy. (It is not often noticed that the nation- 
alist preoccupation with “teaching the young how to 
shoot” was an unconscious tribute to the natural good 
sense and good temper of the young. It was felt, as it is 
sung in the musical comedy South Pacific, “they've got 
to be taught”). 
If only the books 
had been switched 
T would be wrong to say that there had been no 
I improvement in history teaching or history textbooks 
before 1914. True, it often took the form of finding 
better scholarly reasons for telling the old story, but the 
very idea that scholarship had 
claims and usefulness in such a task 
was, on the whole, a gain. But 
some of the gain ‘was superficial, If 
French textbooks were less nation- 
alist, that was part of an internal 
The Unesca Courier. — March 1956 
in school use are not only written in 
a, spirit of objective scholarship, but 
that they are controlled by an out- 
side body of scholars. This, in prac- 
tice, means that the textbooks of 
nations which are supposed to have 
a hereditary enemy, are to be revised 
in the light of criticisms made by 
scholars and educationists of the he- 
reditary enemy who, in turn, submit 
the textbooks of their nation, to si- 
milar criticism. 
As far as this goes, it is probably 
useful. But not only does it not go 
far enough; it may be dangerous in 
a way that is neglected. Ths first 
danger of not going far enough, I 
shall deal with later. The second 
calls for brief comment. If the 
main fault of textbooks is harping 
on old national controversies, giving 
the idea that international relations

change in French politics, not 
necessarily a gain for pure scholar- 
ship. If the official northern legend 
of the origins and conduct of the 
American Civil War ‘was contra- 
dicted and, to some degree exploded 
by southern historians and that 
revision given currency in southern 
textbooks, that was only a tactical 
gain if the northern pupils still read 
only the northern version, the 
southern pupils only the southern. 
If nations or sections could have simply changed text- 
books, that would have been different and better. As it 
was the boast that “nous avons changé tout cela” was 
empty. The details might have been altered but the 
spirit was the same. History was a weapon, not a tool. 
The ideas are commonplaces today, but we must remember 
that they have only recently become commonplaces and 
that they are far from being commonplaces universally 
accepted in many parts of the world, especially in the 
new school systems of the nations that have recently 
come to independent status. It is, therefore, worthwhile 
repeating that to think of history, not as a tool for the 
understanding of our human situation, but as a weapon 
to be forged for a war that, hot or cold, it is assumed 
will always go on, is to risk creating a public opinion like 
that of Europe in 1914 and, to some extent, in 1939. 
The most simple solution to the problem and one that 
has some merits is to secure that the common textbooks

=f 2 
consists of ‘war and the material and 
spiritual preparation for war, it is 
not enough to take up a series of 
problems (for example the origins of 
the war of 1870) and try to get 
agreement on the question. 
First of all, it may not be possible 
to get agreement on the solution of 
the problem. There may, indeed, 
be no solution at all. 
We may never know what Bis- 
marck had in mind in 1870, as apart from what he said 
he had in mind in 1890 and after. Frenchmen may natu- 
rally be less ready to give him the benefit of the doubt 
than Germans or may be more so if they detest Napo- 
leon III more than they do Bismarck! 
\ 
Winding up with 
dull, dry history 
UT much more serious is the implication that, if you 
B clear up these controversies, you have got very far. 
For this, in turn, may lead to dull history, to a neu- 
tral least-common-denominator history that is hardly 
worth teaching and it may, which is more serious, rein- 
force the view that history is conflict, controversy, that, 
indeed, there is much to be said on both sides, but that all 
that matters is the result. That can lead inno- 
cently to worship of what William James called (Contd 
“the bitch Goddess success”. The old, pugna- page) 
cious, partisan history is no ‘worse than that.

Deodorizing history 
(Continued) 
A,     
But the danger of not going far enough is greater. 
Many, perhaps most of the most fruitful problems of his- 
tory are not problems of national conflict at all. They 
may be success stories or stories of great efforts that, as 
far as we can see, failed. But they are not national suc- 
cess stories or national failures either. 
Bow much ink and temper has been 
wasted in discussing whether Charle- 
magne was a Frenchman or a Ger- 
man, a question he could not have 
understood had it been put to him in 
the manner of a modern question- 
naire’ ITow much more fruitful is a 
discussion of the reasons for the 
limited success of Charlemagne’s 
great experiment, how much more 
fruitful the pursuit of understanding 
than either the scoring of nationalist 
points or laborious explanations of 
national misunderstandings. 
Wholesome but 
just not good 
r we want good history textbooks 
I ana we should (it is one of our 
greatest “needs) let us think of 
them positively. One of the greatest 
problems of world society is created 
by the belief, common in Asia and 
Africa, that the West cares nothing 
for their sentiments. How much 
more useful than rewriting the story 
of English rule in India in an 
 
about Florence Nightingale, the North Americans about 
Bolivar or even of the Russian pioneers in Siberia. For 
I harbour, and have always harboured, a dangerous 
thought about some of the most touted reforms of nation- 
alist history teaching. 
The textbooks that well-meaning reformers would like 
to produce have one great weakness; they would be 
unreadable. As the bogus prize poem said of Nebuchad- 
nezzar: 
Sighed as he chewed the unaccustomed food, 
It may be wholesome but it is not 
good. 
The beginning of wisdom will be 
when we take to our hearts the 
heroes of other people, not when 
we write off heroism. 
And there is one further advantage 
in emphasizing the positive. 
Make sure Marc 
Antony was wrong 
EroEs and heroic deeds last; 
fortunately hereditary enemies 
don’t. If you spend your time 
removing awkward passages from 
narratives of past controversies, you 
may find yourself without an au- 
dience; the young may not care. 
Your work will be innocent 
but useless, Fortunately it is not 
true that: 
The evil that men do lives after 
them, 
The good is oft interred with their 
bones. 
  
apologetic fashion would it be for 
English school textbooks to ignore the 
short period of English rule and 
make India before the European in- 
vasions an historical theme of the first magnitude. 
The deodorized history of some propagandists has one 
weakness, it may have no faults put it has few merits. It 
is boring and the young cannot learn if they are bored. 
Wwe must have legends. Why not change legends? Don’t 
tell the Swiss children 
about William Tell, let 
them learn about the Cid 
or the Forty-Seven Ro- 
nin. It ‘will be less bor- 
ing. (Even I got tir- 
ed of the wickedness of 
Edward I and the hero- 
ism of Wallace, the 
fourth or fifth time I 
was told about it.)

than indifference to the

of the stories of other 
peoples.

IT ALLSTARTED WITH EUROPA — The drawings published 
on pages 20 to 23 were made by Campbell Grant and are repro- 
duced from a wild and humorous romp through European 
history written by Richard Armour with the title “It All Started 
with Europa”. The book dedicated to “history students and 
history teachers who for generations have made each other 
equally unhappy,” deliberately sets out to present a humorously 
unreliable account of European history, misremembering and 
dismembering almost everything, from cavemen to 20th century 
dictators. No historical era is omitted, no fact accurately pres- 
ented. In his unabashed distortions, the author acknowledges 
that he has “made no use whatever of the works of Thucyd- 
ides, Tacitus, Gibbon, and Arnold J. Toynbee,” and cautions 
that any resemblance between his book and the work of 
any other historian, living or dead, “is highly unlikely.”

no-one can claim to know or understand 
everything. Yet everyone looks to the past— 
listens at his father’s knee to stories about his family, 
hears the teacher tell old tales about his village or 
his country or reads in books about ancient kings and 
distant lands—and tries to understand what has gone 
before, because the past explains so many things 
about himself and the present time and place in 
which he lives. 
H 1sTORY is everything that ever happened, and 
  
"It is in books that one can learn most about the 
past, but unfortunately the very magnitude, the huge 
scope of recorded history often makes reading about 
past persons and events an unsatisfactory experience. 
" A reader may be especially disappointed in broad, 
sweeping historical accounts because the necessary 
condensation of material may make the past seem 
too full or too lifeless, too monumental or too petty, 
too simple or complex to be adequately understood. 
  
In such history books, for instance, a man may be 
remembered for leading an army or writing a law or 
for dying, but little is conveyed of the flesh, the blood 
and the mind that made up this man, of the facts 
and factors which gave him his place in history. 
In a sense, this is distortion of history because a 
limited account limits comprehension. An incom- 
plete telling is not the whole truth, and thus it also

restricts one’s attempts to relate the past to the 
present with any substantial validity. 
But a complete telling, like complete knowledge or 
understanding, is impossible, so what can the his- 
torian do to interest and inform his readers to the 
greatest possible extent? He may focus upon one 
small section of time or place and attempt to des- 
cribe it completely. He may look at a year, an epic 
or an age from one specific viewpoint—social, eco- 
nomic, political or philosophical. He may even write 
a novel, thinking fiction a more meaningful way to 
present facts, Among the many other methods of 
presentation, he has recently attempted historical 
journalism. 
The writing of historical events as present-day 
news stories overcomes some of the criticisms against 
the encyclopedia-type book. History becomes imme- 
diate and alive. There is a truism that says there is 
nothing older than yesterday’s newspaper, but it is 
equally true that nothing is as up-to-date as the 
latest edition. A description of the invention of the 
printing press written as if it were a news release in 
the evening paper becomes as exciting, as unbeliev- 
able and as revolutionary as today's announcements 
of coming space satellites. 
Using the varied format of a modern daily news- 
paper gives the historian other opportunities. As an

editorial writer (with the unusual gift of hindsight), 
he can be most profound in pointing out historical 
trends and future possibilities based on “the news of 
the day”. As a feature writer he can develop back- 
ground stories to explain all the pertinent details 
behind an historic event. As a columnist he can 
vividly present the art, literature, customs or pecu- 
liarities of a period or intimately describe a persona- 
lity of the day. As a cartoonist he can show that 
the past was as full of foibles as the present. All 
such possibilities translate "history as the down-to- 
earth living that it actually was, enabling a reader 
to view the past in more human terms and to see it 
sharply, almost as he might have witnessed the 
people and events had he been alive during the times 
about which he is reading. 
A typical example of this form of historical report- 
ing is a paper published in Jerusalem called “Chroni- 
cles, News of the Past”, a six-column tabloid-size 
journal. Its first thirty-six issues, presenting a his- 
tory of the Jewish people against the background of 
world history, take the reader from Joshua and the 
conquest of Canaan through the period of Charlema- 
gne. The lead story in an early issue is topped by 
the four-column headline announcing “King Saul Is 
Dead”. and describes the rout of the 
Israelite forces by the Philistines and the (Cont’d on 
later suicide of the wounded King Saul. next page)

Special Edition (conra 
An even more ambitious version of historical news- 
papers is a book called “News of the World” edited by 
Sylvan Hoffman and C. Hartley Grattan. The book 
comprises {fifty four-page tabloid issues covering 
world events of almost 5,000 years up to the end of 
1949. Each issue spans an arbitrary era; the first, for 
instance, reporting on the years 3,000 B.C. to 
1,447 B.C. Its lead story concerns the industrial 
revolution in progress due to the advent of metal 
tools. Another typical story is headlined “Egypt 
Powerful ; Social Changes Made”. A later issue 
announces “Caesar crosses Rubicon”. This book is 
a successor to one by the same editors, “News of the 
Nation” which was confined to history of the United 
States. Such all-inclusive summaries, while lacking 
some of the illuminating details of papers covering 
shorter time periods, are noteworthy for the clarity 
with which a reader can grasp the repetitious cha- 
racter of history and discern its major forces and 
the trends it follows. 
This type of historical writing is, of course, limited.

However, many of its obviously elemental character- 
istics plus its liveliness make it especially valuable as 
a tool to quicken children’s interest in the past, A 
variation of the idea was used most successfully for 
this purpose in a contest for schoolchildren sponsored 
last year by the Archives Nationales de France. 
Prizes were awarded to student teams who submitted 
the best four-page newspaper reporting on the fall 
of the Bastille. Documents, pictures and assorted 
records of the Musée de UHisloire de France were 
made available to contestants. These finally num- 
bered 244 boys and girls who submitted 54 news- 
papers; but more important, some four thousand 
children were attracted to the museum during the 
three months of the contest. 
In our times, we have seen an accelerated pace of 
historic events, speeded ever faster by fantastic scien- 
tific advancement. Happenings that took place yes- 
terday often seem gigantic and today’s occurrences so 
vital and all embracing that mere knowledge of them, 
much less understanding, is a difficult accomplish- 
ment. For this reason alone, it seems that the possi- 
bilities for this journalistic treatment of the past 
have not yet been fully developed; especially when 
it can be used so successfully in making history an 
absorbing, colourful, comprehensible subject for chil- 
dren attempting to khow the world they came from 
and the world they live in today.

WORLD 
PRESS 
COMMENTARY 
UR recent issue which asked the question “ Are 
Women Inferior Beings? ” and answered it with 
scientist Ashley Montagu’s conclusions “No, they 
are naturally superior to men!” has touched off a little 
hornet’s nest in the world's press. As readers will recall 
the Unesco Courier reported that the latest scientific evi- 
dence shows that women are naturally superior to men, 
that they live longer, are healthier, are better “shock 
absorbers” than men, and are more intelligent than men. 
The issue (November 1955; U. S. edition January 1956)

countries left where women still do not have the right 
to vote (1). Since the publication of this number, a new 
electoral law has been published in Egypt under which 
women will have the right to vote for the first time. Men 
over 21 must vote, but women need not do so. The same 
issue exploded some false notions about women in primi- 
tive societies, and published the findings of a four-coun- 
try survey which showed that “the woman who does 
nothing all day long but stay at home... works a 70-hour 
week.”

past sixty years and revealed that there were only fifteen 
‘LIFE OF THE INSECTS’ 
— ‘L’Express’, Paris 
Under an eight-column banner, “A 
UNESCO Inquiry : Women are still not 
free!”, the Paris daily “L’'Express” of 
Nov. 25, devotes its entire two-page centre 
spread to a detailed report of the infor- 
mation published by the Unesco COURIER. 
It begins with this introduction: 
“Unesco has gone ahead and just 
carried out a considerable piece of work 
to establish a balance sheet of ‘the 
progress made by women in recent .years 
in their struggle for equality with men’. 
The truth is that the world has never 
been so preoccupied with women as in 
the past ten years. Economists, demo- 
graphers, biologists reduce them to equa- 
tions and transform them into statistics 
as if all the women in the universe had 
been rounded up in an immense zoo and 
the technicians given a free hand to 
study this animal suddenly turned rum- 
bustious. : 
“‘—And you, professor, what do you 
think ?’ 
“—Mmm.. Well, frankly, doctor, it 
seems to me that... 
“And the women are successively in- 
formed that they are found superior, or 
inferior, or equal—but always in terms 
of the same invariable yardstick, ie. the 
male. 
“Unesco’s effort does not quite shake 
off the atmosphere of a ‘Study of the 
(1) Afghanistan, Cambodia, Egypt. Ethiopia, Iran, 
Iraq, Jordan, Laos, Libya, Liechtenstein, Nicaragua, 
Paraguay, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland, Yemen, 
Life of the Insects’. Painstaking ento- 
mologists, acting with the kindest of 
intentions towards these insects have 
piled up observations and figures to make 
it possible to measure the march forward 
of the women of the world in achieving 
the principles affirmed by the U.N. 
Charter: ‘Free and equal in dignity and 
rights... without distinction of any kind 
such as race, colour or sex.’ 
“Free and equal in dignity... There's 
something that will take a good deal more 
effort. But, alas, since you have to start 
with the rights so that dignity can follow 
afterwards, here are a few of the results 
gathered and recorded by UNESCO's 
investigators.” 
GOOD-BYE ILLUSIONS 
— ‘Le Matin’, Antwerp 
“Unesco (has just) exploded a big 
bomb”, declares the Antwerp daily “Le 
Matin”. “After months of strenuous effort, 
and with the aid of Professor Ashley Mon- 
tagu, it has come out with some surpris- 
ing news: women have made consider- 
able progress in recent years. 
“Alas! not every truth, however scien- 
tific, should be shouted from the house- 
tops, and our Professor would have been 
wiser to reflect on this before relegating 
all his fellow men to an inferior place. 
But as the harm has already been done 
we must take up the cudgels in our own 
defence. 
“Fellow men ! Here we are then, the mi- 
nus habens of humanity, the protozoa of 
the race, the invertebrates of society. We 
Many newspaper and magazine clippings have 
reached us giving factual reports or comment on 
this issue. Below are a few from different countries. 
needed UNEsco to make us realize it, and 
a professor to discover that woman is 
stronger than her mate, that she handles 
her emotions more satisfactorily than a 
man, and that if she wished she could 
do almost anything. 
“No more and no less. Good-bye then 
to our masculine illusions. Power will 
change its sex and women will be in com- 
mand. But before we abdicate let us face 
the fact that we are responsible for a 
thousand calamities. If things are go- 
ing badly in the world, it is because of 
us, because we have never given women 
the chance to teach us how to love one 
another. Unesco has said it and I shud- 
der—especially when I see my concierge 
thrash her husband.” 
WORLD A BETTER PLACE 
— “Gazette de Lausanne’ 
The “Gazette de Lausanne” in Swit- 
zerland quotes large extracts from 
Professor Ashley Montagu’s article, and 
remarks: “Here is something which, curi- 
ously enough, links up in certain ways 
with an opinion expressed in these col- 
umns some time ago. Doctor X, a Lau- 
sanne psychiatrist, had put forward the 
view that women drivers cause less acci- 
dents than men. This statement caused 
an outcry in the Paris press. But evi- 
dence has since shown this to be quite 
true. Let us therefore render justice to 
women and place our confidence in them. 
There is every reason to 
hope thet, the world will be 
a better place.”

UNESCO IS RIGHT 
— ¢ Caffaro’, Genoa 
“Caffaro” of Genoa, after taking up the 
arguments as to why women are superior, 
says: “The Unesco COURIER is right”. It 
adds that as the Italian population is 
composed of 23,969,000 women as against 
22,769,000 men, a Commission composed of 
leaders from the largest women’s organi- 
zations in Italy, both religious and poli- 
tical, met in Rome recently, and decided 
to launch an intensive campaign to give 
women a much greater representation in 
the administrative and legislative network 
for the next elections.” 
SHOULD RULE MANKIND 
— * Neue Post’, Bonn 
In Germany, the Bonn “Neue Post” 
opens its article by stating “A United 
Nations Organization has affirmed that 
women are more intelligent than men. 
Half the world, in other words all the 
human males, will be astonished to learn 
that according to scientific data women 
are more intelligent, more resistant and 
more healthy than men. 
“To reach this astonishing conclusion 
has needed years of work, the accuracy 
of whose results cannot be doubted. 
Behind this statement is Unesco with all 
the weight of its authority. When one 
considers the results of this enquiry, one 
wonders why the world is not ruled by 
women. Women should be able, not only 
because of their charm and affection, but 
also because of their intelligence and the 
biological means with which nature has 
endowed them, to take charge of the 
destinies of the world.” 
A SCIENTIFIC ISSUE 
— Italian press 
The “Gazetta del Popolo” of Turin, the 
“Piccolo” of Trieste and the “Mattino” of 
Naples, all remark that Unesco “has 
carried the feminist and anti-feminist 
arguments from the literary to the scien- 
tific debating floor.” They point out that 
eminent economists, biologists, politicians, 
psychologists and other specialists of 
various nationalities took part in the 
enquiry. The Milan newspaper, “Gazetta 
del Popolo”, reprints several articles from 
the Unesco Courier under the headline 
“Revolutionary Conclusions from a 
UNESCO survey”.

STARTLING STATISTICS 
— Daily Express’, London 
The London “Daily Express”, has a 
provocative short piece by one of its 
leading columnists, William Hickey, who 
dismisses Professor Ashley Montagu, 
Unesco and women’s superiority in quick 
order. Under the headline “The Natural 
Superiority of Women?.. Huh! A cool 
look at some startling statistics”, this is 
what he has to say: 
“This is not the time when one should 
be in a temper. Not a time when one 
should be angry.” (The column appeared 
on December 23.) “But I am in a temper. 
I am angry. And the cause is UNESCO's 
report on women by an American social 
~ scientist, Professor Ashley Montagu. 
“He is the author of a book called ‘The 
Natural Superiority of Women’. And his 
report for the U.N. Organization which 
we all support through taxes is enough 
to make any man angry—and any woman 
flattered. 
“He says that if men had to bear the 
pain of childbirth the human race would 
have been extinct long ago. Oh, what 
profundity! Oh, what wisdom! And I 
say that if women had to earn the rent, 
and the housekeeping, and the insurance, 
and the coal bill... well, civilization would 
never have begun! 
“The professor is also quoted as saying 
that the housewives of the world work 
46,000,000 hours while the rest of the 
active population of the world work only 
42,000,000 hours. I don't know how he 
arrived at these figures. The professor's 
final conclusion is that ‘the hand that 
rocks the cradle should also rule the 
world.’ 
“And I say to the professor... jolly good. 
How right you are. The hand that rocks 
the cradle... or nurses the child in the 
watches of the night... is generally a male 
hand. Isn't it?” 
FUTILE DIATRIBE 
— “ Courrier’, Geneva 
In the editorial columns of the Geneva 
“CouRRIER”, René Leyraz writes: “I have 
never read anything quite so futile, apart 
from the antifeminist diatribes setting out 
to prove the definite congenital superiority 
of man over woman, 
“Science has a broad back. 
“Here, in any case, the question of 
‘feminism’ is raised badly and stupidly. - 
“Naturally the stubborn champions of 
masculine superiority will lash out hotly 
at such pretensions. Tney will line up 
arguments which are just as convincing... 
or just as silly. They will undoubtedly 
defend their chromosomes. Why not ? 
“We already have wars between nations, 
between races, and between classes. Now 
the charming Ashley Montagu, under 
UnEesco's auspices, wants to launch us into 
a war between the sexes! That is exactly 
what we needed. As if it was not already 
difficult enough to get Adam and Eve 
to live together; as if there were not 
already enough family troubles, divorces 
and separations? 
“Masculine superiority and feminine 
superiority are two equally dangerous 
myths. As for the first, woman’s ‘pro- 
motion’ seems to me to have been 
conclusively proved. Thousands of things 
which men thought the “weaker sex” 
incapable of doing have, in our own times, 
been brillantly accomplished by women. 
The woman of today follows man to the 
heart of the jungle or to the summits 
of the Himalayas without flinching or 
fainting and without making a fuss. 
“I do not believe, moreover that we 
are able to produce a valid argument from 
the differences between the sexes against 
women’s voting rights. Complementing 
each other the two sexes can and should 
usefully give their advice on community 
matters. In those countries where 
women’s voting rights have been recoghiz- 
ed there have certainly not been any 
social or political catastrophies. In fact 
the list of countries which join with 
Switzerland in its obstinate refusal to 
grant women the right to vote is some- 
what humiliating for us. 
“We can drop our attitude of masculine 
superiority, but at the same time we 
would ask our womenfolk not to fall into 
the equally silly trap of feminine supe- 
riority. Rather let each sex play its full 
role in the natural and providential order 
of things.’ 
LET'S BE GOOD LOSERS 
— La Croix’, Paris 
Under the headline “Woman is ‘natu- 
rally’ superior to man”, the Paris daily 
“La Croix” commends the arguments put 
forward by Professor Ashley Montagu. 
One of its women writers, declares: 
“Let us all be good losers. If it is true 
that we are ‘naturally’ stronger than men, 
we should be thankful for it for the sake 
of the future of the human race. But 
let us remind ourselves that we have so 
much need of each other that it is of 
little importance whether one or the other 
is ‘naturally’ the stronger, as long as this 
strength serves a useful purpose: biologi- 
cal strength for the woman to give life 
and develop it; muscular strength for the 
man to help his wife, and a ‘super- 
natural’ strength for both, so that a 
helping hand is there In times of need.” 
PUT MEN IN THE SHADE 
— ¢ News Chronicle’, London 
The London “News Chronicle” headlines 
its story: “Women! You put men in the 
shade—brainier, stronger, healthier...” The 
article continues with an analysis of 
facts from the Unesco COURIER, noting 
particularly that only in politics are 
women lagging. behind the men. 
OH, FOR NEW GUINEA 
Two quotes from extreme ends of 
Europe “Aftontidningen” of Stockholm: 
“Oh, for New Guinea where the women 
work and men decorate themselves with 
garlands”; “El Alcazar” (Madrid). “And 
to think that there are hundreds of 
* women sighing for a man who will libe- 
rate them from six hours in an office so 
they can work fourteen in a house.”

in all schools in Republics of the Soviet 
Union not later than the third year 
of compulsory education.” Is it possible 
to get some documentation {for this 
significant statement? 
Theodore Andersson 
Associate Director, 
The Modern Language 
Association of America, 
New York, 
Editor’s note : The latest information 
receined by uNEsco shows that the Russian 
lanquage is taugh! in all schools not later 
than the second year of compulsory 
education, About 200 different languages 
are spoken in the Soviet Union. The 
“Greual Russians”, or Russian-speaking 
population only account for 37 © of tke 
{"nion. The Soviet Union has sixleen 
aulonomous republics and a number of 
autonomous regions, national areas and 
districts. In each of these the molher 
tonque ts the medium of inslruction, but 
Russian is introduced as a second language 
in the second-grade and is studied inlens- 
ively logelher with the vernacular. As 
a result, children of all the Soviel nation- 
alities are able normally to speak, read 
and write Russian by the end of their 
elementary school raining. 
Sir, 
I am delighted with the UNEsco Cou- 
RIER and feel it would be an addition 
to any home. In its field, it is tops.

Sir, 
I think your magazine should be 
read by everyone, whether French, 
© “European” or stateless, who is not 
completely indifferent to the fate of 
his fellow men and women. It gives 
clear and complete facts on each of 
the great problems of the day, on the 
efforts that are being made to solve 
them—especially by UnEsco. 
The different language editions of 
the Unesco COURIER offer everyone the 
chance to perfect his knowledge of an- 
other language. I am a student at the 
(The “tur- 
Ecole des Hautes Etudes Commerciales 
in Paris and I read the English lan- 
guage edition of your magazine thereby 
finding an added interest in the 
articles. 
Francois Sallé 
Paris. 
Sir, 
I have just received and tread with 
great interest the issue of the UNEsco 
Courier devoted to women’s rights 
(No. 11 1955: U.S.A. January 1956). 
Congratulations to Unesco on produc- 
ing a study which should undoubtedly 
attract the attention of all women. 
At the same time there are a number 
of facts I should like to bring to your 
notice. 
The French woman barrister whose 
photo you publish on page 7 has her 
arms bare to the elbow! This is en- 
tirely contrary to the rules of dress for 
a member of the French Bar. Certain 
women barristers, I regret to say, do 
appear dressed this way, but they are 
an exception. Generally, if women 
barristers have short sleeves under 
their robe, they take care to pull down 
the sleeves of their robe as far as the 
wrist. It is a pity you chose this par- 
ticular photograph when so many 
others are available. 
Secondly, France is named as being 
one of the countries where there are 
more girls in secondary schools than 
boys. This is a serious error. 
are about one third fewer girls than 
boys as you will see if you refer to 
official figures. 
You also state that there are 860 
French women lawyers. This figure is 
inexact. In 1950, there were 1,170 and 
this figure has increased considerably 
since then. 
You say, too, that in France in 1900, 
there was not a single woman law 
student. This is not correct, Mlle. 
Chauvin, the first woman lawyer was 
sworn in in 1900 so she must, therefore, 
have been on the rolls of the Law 
Faculty three to five years before— 
and she was not the only woman. 
In his article, “Women in Politics™, 
M. Maurice Duverger states that 
women in Parliament and on the 
higher administrative levels concen- 
trate on specialized matters generally 
There 
The Unesco Courier. — March 1956 
Letters to the editor 
considered to be of special interest to 
women. 
A study of parliamentary activities: 
speeches made, commission reports and 
legislation proposed, shows that though 
women are naturally very interested 
in feminine matters, their attention is 
also focussed on almost all other ques- 
tions. For example, in France, they 
are members of all the large Parlia- 
mentary committees, with the excep- 
tion of two or three. It is also untrue 
to say that the political parties in 
1855 tend to turn women into work 
considered to be of a particularly fem- 
inine nature. Up to a certain point, 
it is true for the parties of the right— 
with the exception of the MRP (Cath- 
olic Popular Republican Movement)— 
but it is not the case with the left- 
wing parties. 
Andrée Lehman 
Président, French League for 
Women's Rights, 
Paris. 
Editor's Note : Lalest available statistics 
show that more girls than boys atlend 
French secondary schools. During 1953- 
1954 there were $18,000 secondary schoot 
pupils in France of whom 485,900 were 
girls and 462100 boys. (Sce “Curren! 
Scheel Enrolment Slalisties" published by 
Unesco in Jannary 1056, price 2/- 3 £ 0.40 
or 100 Fr. frs)) 
Sir, 
I read in your issue No. 11, 1955 
(U.S. A.—January 1956) that to be el- 
gible to vote in the Lebanon a woman 
must have a certificate of primary 
education or its equivalent. Under a 
law passed in February 1952, Lebanese 
women were accorded full political 
rights irrespective of whether they 
were literate or not.

of Lebanese Women ;

Editor's Note : Our correspondent is 
correct in slating thal Lebanese women 
have equal political rights with men. 
They received them, however, under un

XA xoiass YOUTH VOLUN- 
TEERS: Nearly 17,000 young In- 
dian men and women members 
of the international voluntary 
work camp movement (See 
UNEsco CouRIER No. 6 1955: U.S. 
Sept. 1955) have recently aided 
communities in many parts of 
their country. Teams have been 
‘going into city slums to launch 
clean-up campaigns and initiate 
people into the fundamentals of 
health, sanitation and child- 
care. Others have helped vil- 
lages to build or repair schools 
and libraries and have worked 
on many other community pro- 
jects. ‘The Indian work camp 
movement is rapidly spreading 
to all parts of the country and 
its organizations maintain close 
contact with TUnesco’'s Youth 
Section. Later this year a train- 
ing course for work camp leaders 
will be held in South India. 
Members of youth movements 
in other South East Asian coun- 
tries are being invited to 
attend. 
H PLAYTIME IN PARIS: 
Thirty countries are to send 
theatre groups to the third 
international theatre festival 
in Paris between April 10 and 
May 31. Notable theatre 
companies due to take part 
include: the Abbey Theatre 
players from Dublin in 
Shaw's “Saint Joan”, the 
Berlin Schiller Theatre com- 
pany, the Piccolo Teatro of 
Milan, the Stockholm Natio- 
nal Theatre Group playing 
Strindberg's “Father”, and 
the Belgian National Theatre 
Company in a performance 
of “Barabbas” by Ghelderode, 
Troupes from Mexico, Spain, 
Argentine, Poland, Hungary, 
Rumania and many other 
countries are also to take 
part. Plans are now well 
advanced for setling up a 
permanent Theatre of the 
Nations in Paris—a project 
announced after last year’s 
festival. 
Caine YOUNG AR- 
TISTS: Two international con- 
tests with related themes are 
open to children with artistic or 
literary talents in all countries. 
The Moringa Society of Japan 
invites drawings or paintings 
from children up to 14 years of 
age on the subject “My Mother”, 
for an international exhibition 
to be held in Tokyo on “Mo- 
ther’s Day”, May 13. Entries can 
be submitted through Japanese 
Embassies or Legations until 
April 15. ‘The International 
Youth Library in Munich (see 
Unesco COURIER No 3/4 1955: 
U.S. July 1955) offers prizes for 
drawings or paintings and for 
poems or stories up to a page in 
length on “The Wedding”. 
Children between the ages of 4 
and 16 may compete and entries 
should be submitted before 
March 1, 1956. 
H PRESS TRAINING PROB- 
LEMS: The first internation- 
nal conference devoted ex- 
clusively to problems of 
journalistic training has been 
called by Unesco and will 
take place in Paris shortly. 
Some 30 directors of schools 
of journalism, newspaper and 
newsreel editors and radio 
and television  specialisis 
jrom more than 20 countries 
will study current training 
problems as they apply to 
work in all the fields of in- 
Jormation. The conference 
is the first stage of a new 
UNEsco project aimed at aid- 
ing and improving journa- 
listic training in general and 
is in line with its aim to aid 
the spread of news and in- 
formation to promote inter- 
national understanding. 
B IGGEST SHOW ON 
EARTH: Some  1u,000,000,000 
people attend film shows every 
year in more than 100,000 cine- 
mas all! over the world. Their 
entertainment provides the 
world's film Industry with an 
annual turnover of something 
like $4,000,000,000. Biggest fea- 
ture film producer is the U.S.A. 
(344 films in 1953, the latest 
figure given) with Japan in se- 
cond place (302) and India third 
(259), Largest producer in Eu- 
rope is Italy (163), which also 
leads the world in production of 
documentary and short films, 
other than newsreels. These are 
some of the facts in “Film and 
Cinema Statistics”, a recently 
published Unesco study, price: 
$0.50; 3/-; 150 Fr, frs. 
HM TRANSLATING WORLD 
CLASSICS: Sixty transla- 
tions of great literary works 
are now being prepared and 
30 others have already been 
completed under TNESCO'S 
auspices. Works in some 
seven languages were re- 
commended for future trans- 
lation by a special commil- 
tee which met in Paris re- 
cently, One suggestion was 
that the most important 
works in Japanese literature 
should be translated in Eng- 
lish and French. Coming 
under UNESCO'S programme 
for international understand- 
ing through art, the transla- 
tion project includes master- 
pieces in the literature of 
Latin America, Iran, China, 
India, Japan, Italy and the 
Arab nations. 
K oLkLoxkE ON TAPE: 
Since it was founded just five 
years ago, the Hungarian In- 
stitute of Popular Art in Buda- 
pest has collected some 12,000 
folk songs from all parts of the 
country, as well as descriptions 
of traditional festivals and 
games, Most of the collection 
is preserved on tape recordings 
and documentary films and has 
provided material for 235 pam- 
phlets on folklore already pub- 
lished by the Institute. Im
