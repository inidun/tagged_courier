### 114970: Bihar's lawless ways

  
PEOPLE AND PLACES 
Dire poverty and oppression are the grim facts 
of life for the Dalits (‘untouchables’) 
of India’s most backward state 
Travelling in the eastern Indian state 
of Bihar is never easy: the trains are 
overcrowded and the buses are 
ramshackle. In the south-central plains, 100 
kilometres east and west of Patna, the state 
capital situated on the south bank of the 
Ganges, bad road conditions make it hard to 
move around. As well as having to surmount 
these obstacles, travellers in this region may 
even need passes from private parties. Those 
who issue the passes could be Maoist groups 
but most often they belong to various senas— 
landlords’ caste- or class-based private 
armies. The law enforcement authorities are 
virtually absent from this region. 
The village of Danwar Bihta lies in this 
remote area. It is 40 kilometres from the 
district headquarters, Ara, but the terrible 
road conditions make it almost inaccessible. 
The unbridged Sone river which flows near 
the village can be crossed by boat but few dare 
to make the crossing because of the private 
armies which hold sway on both its banks. 
The state is very far away in Danwar 
Bihta; the laws enacted by the legislature are 
hardly even heard of and life for the poor is 
nasty, brutish and short.D anwar Bihta and 
  
* Indian sociologist and author of several studies on 
Bihar State 
 
Arvind N. Das* 
its surrounding area have witnessed many 
brutal massacres in the last three decades, 
claiming over 1,000 lives, mostly of landless 
“untouchables” or Dalits. T he miserable 
state of Danwar Bihta reflects the general 
lawlessness that pervades Bihar today. 
Take Kusumlal, a landless labourer who 
barely survived the massacre that the 
landlords of D anwar Bihta carried out on 
election day in 1989.More than 20 Dalits 
were gunned down when they tried to 
exercise their franchise in the parliamentary 
election. Like other Dalits who survived 
the massacre, Kusumlal and his family had 
to move away from the village; their lives 
were clearly insecure in their traditional 
abode. They now live in tiny huts, built on 
the roadside near a primary school in a 
village five kilometres from D anwar Bihta. 
The cluster of huts, the fact that everyone 
belongs to the same caste, the physical 
distance from the landlords and the 
proximity to the school provide a certain 
degree of security. 
The situation is worse for Kusumlal’s 
wife, Dhanpatia, and their eight-year-old 
daughter, Punamia. Every day they have to 
trudge to the Sone river,two kilometres from 
their hut, to fetch water in earthen pots. It is 
not that there is any lack of water in the 
nearby ponds and wells. Kusumlal’s family 
and others like them are “untouchables” and 
are not allowed by rest of the villagers to take 
water from the public pond near their huts. 
Armed struggle 
Kusumlal and his 11-year-old son Manjhi 
cannot find work in the nearby village. The 
landlords there will not employ them; nor will 
people like Kusumlal dare to return to a 
group of people who have left the scar of a 
bullet injury on his right shoulder.T hey have 
to trudge long distances in search of work, 
sometimes up to ten kilometres each way, to 
earn a meagre 30 rupees (70 cents) per day. 
Even this kind of work is only available for 
four months a year,leaving them in hunger 
and misery for the rest of the time. 
Kusumlal’s son goes to the village 
primary school on the days when he cannot 
find work, but this does not necessarily mean 
that he will actually get any education there. 
The school may be shut: the teacher, a ®&

absent, supervising work on his land rather 
than teaching the Dalit children in the primary 
school. There is, of course, no question of 
Kusumlal’s daughter even going to school and 
learning about the great wide world since a 
girl child is expected from an early age to busy 
herself with household work instead. 
Kusumlal himself does not know much 
about the world beyond his wretched existence. 
He never went to school. All his life he has 
lived in or near Danwar Bihta.He went to Ara 
several times when the case regarding the 
Danwar Bihta firing was going on, but his visit 
was confined to the court buildings where he 
and others like him were summoned to give 
evidence. 
Kusumlal has not given up hope. He is 
aware that he is not alone. Living conditions are 
similar for the nearly 1.5 million landless Dalit 
labourers in Bihar who are now getting together 
here and there to form peasant and labourers’

organizations in a bid to improve their 
situation. Unable to overcome the ruthless 
repression by peaceful means, some Dalits 
like Kusumlal support militant Naxalite 
groups such as the People’s War Group 
(PWG) and the Maoist Communist Centre 
(MCC) who believe in armed struggle to 
end upper-caste domination. Many more 
join the Communist Party of India 
(Marxist-Leninist), known locally as 
“Maaley”, which seeks to combine 
parliamentary politics with militant peasant 
struggles. Together they have formed their 
own “armies” to fight for their rights. 
Kusumlal doesn’t want money. He 
wants to be treated with dignity. He wants 
the landlords to stop sexually exploiting 
and raping Dalit women. He wants the 
landlords’private army, the Ranbir Sena, to 
halt its massacres. Kusumlal doesn’t know 
when these things will happen but he firmly 
believes they will come about one day. ®

PEOPLE AND PLACES 
 
Bihar: a place of inequalities and tensions 
ihar is India’s second most populous state after 
B Uttar Pradesh. Half the size of Germany, it has a 
larger population than Germany and Austria 
combined. Bihar whose name is derived from the 
sanskrit word vihara (monastery), is studded with 
Buddhist monuments and historical sites, one of the 
most important being Bodh Gaya where Lord Buddha 
attained enlightenment 2,500 years ago. 
In stark contrast to its glorious past, Bihar today 
Is in the throes of economic chaos and 
unprecedented social tension. It has the dubious 
distinction of being one of India’s most crime-ridden 
states, with 14 murders a day and one kidnapping 
every four hours. Asin other Indian states, people in 
Bihar are divided on the age-old caste system in 
which the Dalits or untouchables are at the bottom 
of the ladder. Dalits constitute around 15 per cent of 
the state’spopulation but they hold lessthan two per 
cent of the cultivated land. The social tensions are 
largely due to agrarian inequality, and often result in 
clashes between landed gentry and landless Dalit

labourers. Active Dalit resistance in Bihar started in 
the 1960s, when landless labourers aligned 
themselves with Maoist Naxalite groups. The 
landlords and other upper-caste people formed their 
own private armies to assert their supremacy. 
Women, children and old people are often the 
victims of these caste-based massacres. The state 
administration, irrespective of which party is in 
power, is powerless to control these clashes which 
have been going on for the last three decades. 
Bihar is India’s most backward state, with the 
lowest literacy rate and per capita income. On the 
other hand, it isthe richest state in terms of mineral 
resources, accounting for 40 per cent of India’stotal 
production.Rabri Devi is the present chief minister, 
heading a centrist Rashtriya Janata Dal (National 
People’s Party) government. |

### 114971: Daring, caring and sharing

caring 
and sharing 
The threat of fresh water scarcity is a major risk. On the one hand, resources are not 
  
  
unlimited; they are finite and fragile. On the other, total world demand for water has risen 
  
sevenfold in the course of this century, while world population has increased threefold 
over the same period. Increased demand goes hand in hand with rising living standards 
resulting from socio-economic development. This is bad news insofar as demand will 
continue to escalate as living standards hopefully improve. But it is good news insofar as this 
level of development increases our capacity to make more economical use of water. 
This collective resource is becoming rarer because it is being overexploited by a 
consumerist and pollution-generating humanity. The warning signs are clear: falling 
water tables, shrinking rivers and lakes, widespread pollution, creeping desertification. Water 
shortage is exacting a growing human toll in terms of malnutrition,disease,abandonment 
of rural areas, and swollen urban settlements. Prophets of doom predict that water,even 
more than oil or land, may soon foment bitter conflicts. 
But if the outlook is gloomy, crisis is not yet inevitable,on condition that we do three 
things: put technology back in its place; recognize both the possibilities and the limitations 
of the market; and above all give priority to a new “water ethic”. 
Technology can only provide part of the answer. The water crisis is not an isolated 
phenomenon. It is an important but specific aspect of the general crisis of a development 
model based on a concept of growth which is obsessed with macro-economics and 
technology and neglects social, human and environmental factors. We should firmly 
oppose so-called miracle solutions. In any case, where in today’s economic climate are we 
going to find the means to build dams, pipe systems, channels and reservoirs, or to 
finance the “ecojobs” needed for scientific management of agriculture and the environment? 
There is also growing pressure to recognize that water should become a commodity 
like any other. In this perspective the market could be used to regulate water demand, both 
to reduce overall consumption and to arbitrate between users, within countries and 
internationally. This approach certainly has a role to play in enhancing the value of an 
increasingly precious resource and thereby reducing waste. But if market mechanisms were 
to rule unchecked, what would happen to the role of the public authorities? How could 
they exercise their responsibility for social justice, especially towards all those who still have 
no access to drinking water? 
Technology and the market can be precious allies in getting to grips with the looming 
water crisis, but ultimately the response to it must rest on ethical and cultural foundations. 
There should be three imperatives:daring, caring and sharing.D aring, because postponing 
urgent decisions on the grounds that all the data are not available would be tantamount 
to letting demand grow until it reaches its natural and economic limit. Caring, because over 
a billion people still have no access to drinking water. Sharing because the only alternative 
to worsening conflict rests on determination to show a sense of equity and community. This 
is not a utopian ideal: in human history, water has been a greater force for unity than for 
division. un

### 114972: The Zero option for waste

The zero option for 
The world may be producing too much waste. It is also spawning plenty 
of imaginative ideas about how to handle it 
The world is groaning under the 
weight of the rubbish people produce 
and things are getting worse. Nobody 
knows exactly how much waste there is in 
the Third World, but the Organization for 
Economic Cooperation and Development 
(OECD) has produced figures for its 29 
member-states, which are mostly rich 
countries. 
Between 1980 and 1995, it says, the 
total amount of municipal waste increased 
from 347 to 484 million tonnes—238 
million in the United States and 153 
million in the 15 countries of the European 
Union. 
Industries alone in the OECD 
countries produced 1.5 billion tonnes of 
waste in 1995. The French—top of the 
agricultural and forest waste league with 
377 million tonnes compared with the 
Greeks’ 90 million—throw out 17 billion 
plastic bags every year. They junk 1.7 
million vehicles and discard 20 million 
tyres. The Germans throw away 4.42 
million tons of packaging—a trifle 
compared with the Americans’ 64 million 
tonnes. The US is also top where 
A reforestation and resin extraction project 
in Colombia. 
10 The Unesco Courier - February 1999 
computers are concerned, scrapping 10 
million every year. 
Forty million tonnes of recyclable 
waste were exported by OECD countries 
in 1990.“To reduce flows of materials, we 
need a revolution in how we think about 
them—a transition as profound as the 
movement from the Stone Age to the 
Bronze Age,” says John Young, a senior 
researcher at the Worldwatch Institute in 
Washington. “This revolution, however, 
will centre not on a new material, but on 
how to use existing materials far more 
efficiently.” 
What is waste? 
There are several definitions. 
Belgium, for example, calls it “any 
substance or object which the holder 
discards or intends or is required to 
quite varied solutions. 
The amount of waste exported does 
not necessarily match the amount 
imported, since the definition of such 
material can change when it crosses a 
national border. If used tyres are exported 
as waste to a country with laxer rules, 
they become an ordinary commercial 
item when imported there. 
So tracking the international 
movement of waste is a nightmare. 
Especially as the cost of recycling and 
dumping varies from country to country. 
The cheapest disposal method, if you 
manage to dodge customs, is still to 
smuggle 
in, say, used tyres and dump them 
on waste ground without regard to the 
environment. 
“The culture of consumption that has 
‘The culture of consumption that has spread since mid- 
century from North America to Western Europe, Japan and 
a wealthy few in developing countries has brought with it 
an unprecedented appetite for physical goods and the 
materials from which they are made’ 
discard”. As a result the official quantity 
of waste in Belgium is high—645,636 
tonnes exported in 1991, compared with 
only 21,126 exported by France and 
108,466 tonnes by the US. 
Mexico’s definition of waste is very 
complicated: “Any material . . . whose 
quality does not permit its use again in 
the same process that generated it”. In 
Switzerland, “wastes are movable things 
which the owner discards or whose 
disposal is in the public interest”. In 
South Korea, waste means “any matter . . 
. which becomes unnecessary for human 
living or business activities”. 
The OECD notes an extra problem to 
do with differentiating between the word 
“discard” in the definitions—meaning to 
get rid of, scrap or abandon—and 
“disposal”, which means destruction, 
removal, emptying or dumping.These are 
spread since mid-century from North 
America to Western Europe, Japan and a 
wealthy few in developing countries has 
brought with it an unprecedented 
appetite for physical goods—and the 
materials from which they are made,” says 
Young.“In the United States, the average 
person accounts for the use of some 540 
tonnes of construction materials, 18 
tonnes of paper, 23 of wood, 16 of metals 
and 32 tonnes of organic chemicals in the 
course of a lifetime.” 
So it is vital to reduce consumption 
of raw materials and minimize waste 
production. 
The three Rs—reduce, 
re-use, recycle 
Most industrialized countries have 
passed laws about waste based on the 
three Rs—reduce, re-use and recycle. The

laws cover several sectors: industry and 
packaging, household and organic waste, 
paper, vehicle batteries, tyres and oil and 
other lubricants. The goal is to cut the 
amount at source, especially where 
hazardous substances are concerned, 
such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) 
which attack the ozone layer. The latter 
are hard to collect and are gradually being 
taken off the market. 
Tyres can be re-used to make anti- 
noise barriers. Paper can be recycled. But 
some waste cannot be dealt with by the 
three Rs and has to be incinerated— 
which is criticized as polluting the air with 
high levels of dioxin gas near the 
incinerators—or dumped, which is 
tolerated less and less because of 
pollution discharges and the 
accompanying bad smells. 
To tackle this worrying situation 
which is very hard to remedy, Belgian 
economist Gunter Pauli in 1994 launched 
the Zero Emissions Research Initiative 
(ZERI) which in effect means “zero 
waste”. The scheme is backed by the 
Tokyo-based UN University—a network 
of universities particularly concerned 
about the environment—and involves 
trying to save everything in industry and 
agriculture, treating all waste as raw 
material and avoiding pollution at the 
same time as making profits and creating 
jobs. Quite a few projects were presented 
at ZERI’s fourth congress in Windhoek, 
Namibia, in October 1998, attended by 
250 delegates from five continents. Here 
are three of them.

to rivers,from dams to marshes,and from 
ponds to irrigation canals. But the 
beautiful stranger is a killer. 
It suffocates native plants, fish and 
amphibious creatures by draining oxygen 
from the water. It hampers river

1998, 
hottest year 
of the century 
ccording to the World Meteorological 
Organization (WMO),1998 will go down in 
history as the hottest year of the twentieth 
century. The earth’s average surface temperature 
increased by 0.58°C between 1961 and 1990. 
Temperatures have been rising steadily since 
1860, the year records began to be kept, and 
today they are 0.7°C higher than they were at 
the end of the nineteenth century. Last year edged 
out 1997 as the hottest year on record with an 
average temperature 0.43°C higher than those 
recorded for the period 1961-1990. 
Peter Scholefield, head of WMQO’s World 
Climate Data and Monitoring Programme, says 
1999 has little chance of topping 1998. It will 
not be as hot because the heat records observed 
in 1998 were largely due to El Nifio,” he says. The 
cyclical El Nifio phenomenon, in which the surface 
temperature of the Pacific Ocean rises, was over by 
the middle of 1998 and is not likely to reappear 
for at least two years. The 1998 EH Nifio was 
particularly intense and caused many disasters 
around the world.Drought sparked huge fires in 
Indonesia and floods devastated Ecuador, Peru 
and Kenya at the beginning of the year. The 
torrential rains that fell on China between June 
and August were due to El Nifio’s last gasps. 
According to WMO, northern Eurasia was the 
only part of the world spared by the heat in 1998. 
In Aorida, in the southeastern United States, the 
period between April and June was the driest on 
record in 104 years. France and the United Kingdom 
had the warmest February of the century. Qatar 
posted its hottest summer in history, and a record- 
breaking heat-wave caused the deaths of over 100 
people in Russia in June. Drought ravaged several 
partsof Brazil, where fires broke out spontaneously. 
Chile had the least rain in a century. Drought also 
affected New Zealand and the Fiji Islands. |

in boat propellers and destroys nets with 
its weight. It threatens hydro-electric 
power production by clogging up the 
channels which feed the dams. Farming 
suffers too because the fast-growing plant 
blocks irrigation canals. 
When all efforts to control it had 
failed, ZERI decided to treat it as a 
friend, as people do in Viet Nam where it 
1s cultivated, dried and made into 
compost which is excellent for growing 
edible mushrooms. A kilo of such 
compost can produce 112 kg of fresh 
tropical oyster mushrooms (Pleurotus sajur 
caju) in five weeks. 
In Ethiopia, Dawit Abate, a 
mycologist in the biology department at 
Addis Ababa University, is training street 
children to grow this simple and 
profitable crop. In Zimbabwe, Margaret 
Taguira, of the University of Africa at 
Mutare, produces up to 100 kg a day. 
Spore banks can now be set up, after the 
Chinese example, to foster the scheme 
which has turned a plague into a weapon 
against poverty. 
A worm that washes 
whiter 
The colour white evokes thoughts of 
purity and clean-smelling linen. But it 
gets that way through treatment with 
chlorine, which eats away at ozone. The 
phosphates in detergents are also blamed 
for killing off life in lakes and rivers and 
causing green tides in the sea by setting 
off excessive growth of plants, which then 
decompose and empty the water of the 
oxygen necessary for other things to grow. 
Z.M. Nyiira, of Uganda’s National 
Council for Science and Technology, in 
Kampala, explains that some insects such 
as termites produce enzymes that 
“digest” cellulose and the blood and flesh 
of living creatures; others include the 
larvae of the bluebottle, the tsetse fly, the 
mosquito and the earthworm. So why not 
extract from some of the 1,800 known 
varieties of earthworm, such as Eisenia 
foetida, the enzymes they produce which 
can easily remove blood, wine and earth 
stains? 
Such enzymes are already used to 
purify medicines and vaccines. Now they 
can be extracted from a worm with a 
syringe without killing it; the only difficulty 
is distinguishing between the head and the 
tail. Small soap firms in Colombia and 
Slovakia have started using this method. 
The miracle of Las Gaviotas 
The Las Gaviotas Environmental 
Research Centre was set up in 1966 by 
Paolo Lugari at Vichada, in eastern 
Colombia near the Venezuelan border. 
Funded by the central mortgage bank, it has 
built an international reputation on its large- 
scale use of renewable energy—equipping 
40,000 units of low-cost housing in Bogota 
with solar water-heaters and refrigerators, 
setting up semi-industrial kitchens fuelled 
with cottonseed oil heated to 180°C in 
vacuum tubes, so avoiding the use of 
polluting fuels. 
At Vichada,the hospital founded by Las 
Gaviotas produces its own energy, distils its 
own water, provides naturally-purified air, 
cooks its own  biologically-grown 
vegetables and grows medicinal plants. 
Colombia is losing 650,000 hectares of 
trees each year, and Lugari has decided to 
launch a huge reforestation programme. 
Despite drought and extreme soil acidity, 
about 1,000 hectares have been reforested 
at the rate of one Caribbean pine planted 
every few seconds around the clock for 
three months. Resin extracted from the 
pine is drained into boxes made of recycled 
cardboard ingenious enough to have won a 
national prize for innovation in packaging. 
The return of the forest has meant 
water has come back too. Filtered and 
purified by the layer of humus, it is bottled 
and sold cheaply as part of a treatment for 
the digestive ailments which affect the 
population. The fifth world congress of 
ZERI will be held at Vichada this October. 
A brewery for breeding fish 
At Tsumeb, in northern Namibia, the 
national brewery company makes sorghum 
beer without leaving any waste. Inspired by 
a pilot project in Fiji, the brewers also 
breed fish and grow mushrooms. The 
sorghum waste is put in concrete 
containers where it ferments and gives off 
methane gas. Eighty per cent of Tsumeb’s 
inhabitants cook with this gas, thus 
avoiding the use of wood fuel. 
Namibia is one of the driest countries 
in the world, and it takes five litres of water 
to make a litre of beer. Instead of going to 
waste, the water from the brewery is used 
to fill big ponds. Seven tonnes of grain are 
needed to produce a tonne of butcher’s 
meat, but only 1.8 tonnes are needed to 
produce a tonne of fish.So George Chan, a 
Mauritian expert who has worked 
extensively in China, got the idea of 
breeding fish near breweries and has had 
excellent results. Grain also makes a very 
good bedding in which to grow 
mushrooms. Similar experiments are being 
carried out in North America, Japan, 
Germany, Brazil, Colombia and the 
Seychelles. [|

### 114973: Farms in the city

Farms in the city 
On terraces, balconies and even in stairwells, city-dwellers are growing more 
and more food—in the North for pleasure, in the South for survival 
In both rich and poor countries— 
especially the latter—people are flocking 
from rural areas to the cities. T he United 
Nations Development Programme (UNDP) 
says the population of the world’s cities will 
nearly double between 1990 and 2025, rising 
from 2.4 billion to 5.5 billion. 
Urban gardens, long neglected and even 
disdained because they were carelessly 
cultivated or insalubrious, are becoming a 
source of food and income for newcomers 
from the countryside. The UNDP sees them 
as a resource that should be exploited. It 
began looking into urban agriculture in 1991 
and presented a report on it to the United 
Nations Conference on Human Settlements 
(Habitat IT) in 1996. 
The UNDP uses the term “agriculture”in 
a broad sense—it ranges from raising animals 
to recycling waste, while the term “urban”is 
used to cover “the area of a city’s sphere of 
social,ecological and economic influence”. 
It describes urban agriculture as “an 
industry that produces, processes and 
markets food and fuel, largely in response to 
the daily demand of consumers within a 
town,city or metropolis,on land and water 
dispersed throughout the urban and peri- 
urban area, applying intensive production 
methods, using and re-using natural 
resources and urban wastes, to yield a 
diversity of crops and livestock.” 
Green-fingered 
urban gardeners 
City-dwellers everywhere display enormous 
ingenuity when it comes to growing things. 
They make use of small gardens (apart from 
formal allotments), gaps between buildings, 
waste ground, roadsides, railway 
embankments,terraces, balconies and even 
stairwells. On spaces just a few metres 
square, you can find vegetable plots, 
hydroponic crops (grown with nutrients in 
sand or water but without soil), fruit trees, 
fishtanks, flowers and small animals such 
as rabbits, hamsters and poultry in cages 
hanging on walls. 
These urban “farmers” are mostly 
women, who produce vegetables and animals 
for their own consumption and to make a 
little pocket money. For example, a young 
mother in Nairobi noticed at the roadside 
 
Harvesting vegetables grown on the roof of a slum house in Bangladesh. 
near her house a spot where for years people 
had dumped and burned garbage. She 
realized how fertile it would be and planted 
beans and maize there. Since then, she has 
been able to feed her family, drying the 
beans to eat during the off-season and 
selling roasted corn cobs to passers-by. 
Another woman grows manioc and spinach 
near a leaky pipe. Access to water is a serious 
These urban ‘farmers’ are 
mostly women, who 
produce vegetables and

consumption and to make a

problem—it’s either too far away or too 
expensive. 
You don’t have to own land to grow 
vegetables. Anything will do—boxes, 
guttering, old tyres, plastic bags. In Mexico 
City, people grow potatoes in discarded 
truck tyres. In the Chilean capital, Santiago, 
the Centre for Education and Technology 
has a model 20 m 2 urban garden to show 
how things can be done. To save space, 
containers are stacked up in a pyramid 
shaded from the sun by a vine. Cucumbers, 
marrows and melons grow vertically along 
the walls. 
In Port-au-Prince, Haiti, an American 
food aid organization is encouraging people 
to grow crops on the flat roofs of houses. To 
make sure that the garden isn’t too heavy for 
the roof to support, it advises using not earth, 
but a 5- to 10-cm thick layer of either compost 
made from garbage, or else cut grass,bagasse 
(sugar-cane waste), rice husks or maize leaves. 
In St. Petersburg, in Russia, people use sacks 
of peat to grow things in, with the sack serving 
as a container. Analyses made in New York 
show that such intensively-grown crops 
contain a tenth the amount of pollution found 
in field-grown crops. 
But if not practised properly, urban 
agriculture can cause pollution and disease. 
Fertilizing plants with untreated sewage, 
for example,can cause cholera epidemics. 
Lead and cadmium from petrol gets 
concentrated in leaf vegetables. To avoid 
these risks, communities must be educated 
about them,urban agriculture included in 
local government policy and health 
regulations enforced. Community groups 
must also be encouraged so as to boost the 
growth of a food source which has become 
vital in overcrowded cities. u

WORLD OF LEARNING 
In Europe, thousands of ‘companies for jobs’ are trying to teach marginalized 
young people and the long-term unemployed how to work 
In the 15 member-states of the 
= European Union, the average 
unemployment rate is nearly 11 per 
cent, with big variations between 
countries. But there is plenty of work, 
especially in the area of the “social 
economy’. 
This sector, which accounts for 6 per 
cent of all jobs in Europe, includes firms 
and organizations whose aim is not just to 
maximize their profits. They are keen to 
increase the quality and accessibility of 
their products in addition to the well- 
being of their members and employees, 
especially by raising their level of 
education and training. 
Many of them aim more specifically to 
help the most marginalized people to build 
up skills and work experience before they 
get a regular job. This involves two main 
groups: young people who may never have 
worked and older long-term unemployed 
people. Most of the latter are men, many of 
whom worked in traditional industries and 
who find the skills that gave them status are 
no longer in demand. 
They often have multiple problems, 
ranging from educational failure to family 
and housing problems and alcohol or 
drug abuse. Many dropped out halfway

They should not be treated as victims but 
as people who can take responsibility for 
their own future given proper support. 
A stepping-stone 
to the job market 
All over Europe, the welfare-to-work 
schemes through training and work 
experience which sprang up in the 1970s 
have blossomed in the 1990s. They aim to 
help people move out of joblessness and 
into a form of supported employment 
with training. 
A study of six countries published by 
the European Union and the French 
Committee of Welfare-to-work Companies 
(CNEI) reported last year that there were 
tens of thousands of schemes of this kind in 
existencel. They accounted for more than 
280,000 jobs, a drop in the ocean 
compared with the number needed.T hey 
were also temporary jobs—short-term 
contracts ranging from a few months to a 
couple of years. They are not ends in 
themselves. Welfare-to-work schemes are 
not meant to create jobs but to be a 
stepping stone to the job market. They 
could be called “companies for jobs”. 
Their name, role and method of 
funding vary from country to country. They 
usually get some support from local, 
regional and national governments and 
some of them work in partnership with 
private firms and trade unions. They take 
the form of co-operatives, mutual societies, 
associations,foundations and charities. 
In Scotland, for example, the Wise 
Group provides jobs in the intermediate 
labour market—jobs that range from 
renovation of run-down estates to home 
insulation and forestry. Participants receive 
a wage and have to learn the discipline of 
work—keeping regular hours and making a 
commitment. 
In Germany, a new kind of employment 
and professional qualification company 
(“Beschaeftigungs und 
Qualifizierungsgesellschaft”—BQG) has 
emerged since reunification, mainly in the 
former East Germany as a result of the 
mass sackings that came with privatization. 
In France, the government provides 
incentives for about 800 welfare-to-work 
companies (“entreprises d’insertion”) 
which have the difficult task of balancing 
their books and winning orders in

“neighbourhood committees”, mainly 
concerned with community activity in 
poor suburbs and with providing local

In Italy, laws are encouraging the 
development of some 2,500 “social co-

Job insecurity 
Thierry Delavaux,who runs a welfare- 
to-work firm in a Paris suburb, says:“You 
have to focus both on know-how and on 
how to behave. A young person can learn to 
hammer nails in perfectly, but that won’t be 
any good if he turns up for job interviews 
with a walkman on his head.” 
Employers need people who are “job 
ready”, people they don’t have to teach 
how to read, write and count, how to be 
motivated and to communicate with fellow 
workers. The first things these job-seekers 
have to learn are getting to work on time, 
meeting deadlines and working in a team. 
Sometimes they have to be encouraged to 
buy an alarm clock, helped to plan the route 
to their workplace by public transport,and 
even need to be accompanied to work for 
the first few days. 
In a world where professional careers are 
constantly changing, they also have to be 
taught how to adapt to new and flexible 
working conditions—repeated short-term 
contracts, working from home and wider 
use of information and communication 
technologies. 
This is especially important because 
those who find employment after a welfare- 
to-work scheme (less than half of the total) 
often move into insecure jobs with low 
wages and poor prospects. nu

I’ve got is my name. . .” T his statement 
by a character in My Names Joe, anew film 
by British director Ken Loach, describes in 
a nutshell the plight of those who find 
themselves on the margin of society. 
It is no easy matter to bring young 
people in this situation back into society, to 
break the vicious circle of marginalization 
and give them the chance to find a steady 
job and,more importantly, to learn a skill. 
Semilla is one of many organizations in 
a “We can’t go to the police,or borrow Spain that are trying to do just this. 
“We try to prepare them for long-term 
jobs, but even if they find work for only a 
few months, it enables them to build up 
their CV,” says Luis Oscar Reyes, who runs 
Semilla’s youth information centre and jobs 
club. “They often have a range of skills 
which unfortunately don’t come across very 
well in an official document.” Semilla, 
which was founded nearly 25 years ago, is 
based in the Madrid dormitory suburb of 
Villaverde, which has a high school dropout 
rate (60 per cent), and is plagued by 
alcoholism, unemployment, drug 
addiction, broken families and youth gangs. 
Breaking 
the vicious circle 
“I think I'll be able to get a job after this,” 
says 19-year-old Cristina, who heard about 
Semilla when she was at school. After studying 
cutting and dressmaking in a design and 
fashion house for two years, she now works in 
Metas, a boutique which also belongs to 
Semilla. There she has learned all about selling 
decorated fabrics and household linen, 
ranging from accounting to customer 
relations, and making window blinds and 
quilts. 
“They take turns doing different jobs, 
learning how a business works and above all 
how to accept responsibilities,” says Paloma, 
who runs the shop and supervises its staff of 
five (three teachers and two professional 
couturiers) as well as the students.

like Campofrio (one of Spain’s leading food 
companies) and Auchan (a French 
supermarket chain) so young people can do 
unpaid work training for up to three 
months,” says Reyes. “We’ve also have 40 
people in a supervised professional back-to- 
work programme, which involves 
subsidizing firms to the tune of 30,000 
pesetas ($215) a month for every young 
person they take on for at least six months.” 
Semilla also acts as a labour exchange, 
serving as a clearing house for job offers, 
helping people compile CVs and preparing 
them for courses run by the Spanish state 
employment agency, INEM. It reckons that 
80 per cent of those who have received the 
training it provides manage to find jobs, 
mostly in small neighbourhood shops. 
Semilla’s experience is not unique. 
There are thought to be more than a 
thousand similar organizations in Spain. 
The biggest category among them includes 
what are known as social co-operatives, 
back-to-work firms which exist mainly in 
Catalonia (more than 200), Andalusia 
(150),Madrid (100), the two Castiles (60), 
the Basque Country (50), Valencia (50) 
and Galicia (50). Their methods and 
organization systems differ, but they are all 
guided by one basic principle—that 
prevention is the first step in the struggle 
against exclusion. [|

Europe has no monopoly on 
II organizations working at the crossroads 
between economics and social work. In 
Japan, mutual companies in the insurance 
sector and consumer co-operatives are an 
established part of the scene. Recently new 
service co-ops have been created, many of 
them built up by women. 
For more than a decade, the programme 
to fight unemployment in Quebec has 
supported the creation of co-operatives and 
associations which aim to get people back 
to work. In the United States, many local

community initiatives have long been 
launched by volunteers. Those which have 
survived have brought together partners 
from associations and local authorities, 
without depending too heavily on support 
from the public purse. 
In Africa and Latin America, the 
number of micro-credit co-operatives, 
grassroots groups and other neighbourhood 
associations involved in vocational training 
and job creation, is growing all the time. 
This kind of informal sector is sometimes 
bigger than the formal labour market. ®

group of Uruguayan teachers is battling 
illiteracy in a poor area of the capital, 
Montevideo, by giving children who skip school— 
and their mothers— individual help. 
The teachers say youngsters drop out mainly 
because they do not have enough contact with the 
written word at home, where the main influence is 
oral communication, mostly with the mother. So a 
child who sells sweets and becomes very good at 
mental arithmetic can fail maths at school through 
being unable to cope with abstractions and transfer 
familiar everyday mental calculations into 
mathematical symbols. 
The mothers— mostly uneducated or 
functionally illiterate— play a key part in their 
children’s ability to learn and handle symbolsand 
can encourage them to think in abstract terms. 
To bring mothers into this learning process, the 
teachers meet them and their children at home for 
an hour twice a week. 
The programme, known as El Abrojo (the 
thistle), has so far involved 1,168 people and is 
backed by the Uruguayan education ministry and 
Terre des Hommes, a French non-governmental 
organization.lt does not aim to take the place of 
the school but simply to build bridges so children 
can return to the classroom. 
The scheme hasbeen a great success Every one 
of the children from 88 familieswho took part went 
back to school and got much better results. Reading 
became a new family pastime. Some children and 
their mothers even began keeping diaries which, 
says project coordinator Adriana Briozzo of the 
Uruguayan Institute of Popular Education, helps 
“to boost the self-confidence of the children and 
their mothers and to channel the aggressivity of 
the mothers.” 
Reading sessions have been held in the street 
and a travelling library has been set up. The 
teachers hope to extend El Abrojo, which won 
UNEsco’s Noma Prize for Literacy last year, to many 
more families. u

A water crisis looms closer, it seems, every day. In just a couple of 
generations, the earth’s population will reach an estimated 
nine billion people, as against some six billion today. How will this 
growing population be fed? Two-thirds of water consumption 
already goes to irrigation, and agricultural needs are increasing. 
Meaw hile, industrialization is also taking a heavy toll on our fragile 
water supplies, creating both new demands and risks of pollution. 
Hydrologists and civil engineers used to have a standard 
response to water scarcity: build more dams desalinization plants 
and even pipelines to bring water from humid to dry areas. Not only 
have these technological options failed to keep up with rising 
demand, but they are also too expensive, in ecological as well as 
economic terms. 
Today, our hydrological landscape is being re-designed as 
conservationists and economists form an unusual alliance. Instead of 
asking, “how can we provide new supplies?”, they now insist the 
main question is, “how can we cut demand?” Their concerns point 
to a major paradox: we waste a resource without which we cannot 
live. The key to more rational management appears to be simple: 
charge consumers for the water they use. At the same time, other 
market mechanisms are seen as a solution to allocating water 
resources efficiently. For example, laws in the US state of California 
encourage farmers to sell their water rights to cities instead of 
growing crops during a drought.There is even talk of setting up an 
international water market so that water-poor countries can buy 
supplies from the water-rich. But what are the political and social 
costs of this approach? Can we afford to treat this vital resource 
like any ordinary commodity? In short, what price water? [|

### 114976: A Rare and precious resource

### 262562: What price water?

A rare and precious 
Fresh water is a scarce commodity. Since it’s impossible to increase supply, 
demand and waste must be reduced. But how? 
Water is a bond between human beings and 
nature. It is ever-present in our daily lives and in 
our imaginations. Since the beginning of time, it 
has shaped extraordinary social institutions, and 
access to it has provoked many conflicts. 
But most of the world’s people, who have never 
gone short of water, take its availability for granted. 
Industrialists, farmers and ordinary consumers 
blithely go on wasting it. T hese days,though supplies 
are diminishing while demand is soaring.Everyone 
knows that the time has come for attitudes to change. 
Few people are aware of the true extent of fresh 
water scarcity. Many are fooled by the huge 
expanses of blue that feature on maps of the world. 
They do not know that 97.5 per cent of the planet’s 
water is salty—and that most of the world’s fresh 
water—the remaining 2.5 per cent—is unusable: 70 
per cent of it 1s frozen in the icecaps of Antarctica 
and Greenland and almost all the rest exists in the 
form of soil humidity or in water tables which are 
too deep to be tapped. In all, barely one per cent of 
fresh water—0.007 per cent of all the water in the 
world, is easily accessible. 
Over the past century, population growth and 
human activity have caused this precious resource to 
dwindle.Between 1900 and 1995, world demand for 
water increased more than sixfold—compared with 
a threefold increase in world population. T he ratio 
Sharper vision 
D esalinization,state of the art irrigation systems, techniques to harvest fog— technological 
solutions like these are widely hailed as the answer to water scarcity. But in searching for the 
“miracle” solution, hydrologists and policy-makers often lose sight of the question:how can we 
use and safeguard this vital resource? UNESCO's International Hydrological Programme (IHP) takes 
an interdisciplinary approach to this question. On the one hand, IHPbrings together scientists from 
150 countries to develop global and regional assessments of water supplies and, for example, 
inventories of groundwater contamination. At the same time, the programme focuses on the 
cultural and socio-economic factors involved in effective policy-making. For example, groundwater 
supplies in Gaza (Palestinian Authority) are coming under serious strain,partly because of new 
business investment in the area. [HP has a two-pronged approach. First,train and help local 
hydrologists accurately assess the supplies. Second, work with government officials to set up a 
licensing system for pumping groundwater. 
By joining forces with the World Water Council,an international think-tank on hydrological 
issues, IHP is now hosting one of the most ambitious projects in the field: World Water Vision. 
Hundreds of thousands of hydrologists, policy-makers, farmers, business leaders and ordinary 
citizens will take part in public consultations to develop regional scenarios as to how key issues 
like contamination will evolve in the next 25 years u 
1 8 The Unesco Courier - February 1999 
between the stock of fresh water and world population 
seems to show that in overall terms there is enough 
water to go round. But in the most vulnerable regions, 
an estimated 460 million people (8 per cent of the 
world’s population) are short of water, and another 
quarter of the planet’s inhabitants are heading for the 
same fate. Experts say that if nothing is done, two- 
thirds of humanity will suffer from a moderate to 
severe lack of water by the year 2025. 
Inequalities in the availability of water— 
sometimes even within a single country—are 
reflected in huge differences in consumption levels. 
A person living in rural Madagascar uses 10 litres 
a day, the minimum for survival, while a French 
person uses 150 litres and an American as many as 
425. 
Scarcity is just one part of the problem. Water 
quality is also declining alarmingly. In some areas, 
contamination levels are so high that water can 
no longer be used even for industrial purposes. 
There are many reasons for this—untreated sewage, 
chemical waste, fuel leakages, dumped garbage, 
contamination of soil by chemicals used by farmers. 
The worldwide extent of such pollution is hard to 
assess because data are lacking for several countries. 
But some figures give an idea of the problem. It is 
thought for example that 90 per cent of waste 
water in developing countries is released without

Things are especially bad in cities, where water 
demand is exploding. For the first time in human 
history, there will soon be more people living in cities 
than in the countryside and so water consumption 
will continue to increase. Soaring urbanization will 
sharpen the rivalry between the different kinds of 
water users. 
Curbing the explosion 
in demand 
Today, farming uses 69 per cent of the water 
consumed in the world, industry 23 per cent and 
households 8 per cent. In developing countries, 
agriculture uses as much as 80 per cent. T he needs 
of city-dwellers,industry and tourists are expected 
to increase rapidly, at least as much as the need to 
produce more farm products to feed the planet. The 
problem of increasing water supply has long been 
seen as a technical one, calling for technical solutions

such as building more dams and desalination plants. 
Wild ideas like towing chunks of icebergs from the 
poles have even been mooted. 
But today, technical solutions are reaching 
their limits. Economic and socio-ecological 
arguments are levelled against building new dams, 
for example: dams are costing more and more 
because the best sites have already been used, and 
they take millions of people out of their environment 
and upset ecosystems. As a result, twice as many 
dams were built on average between 1951 and 1977 
than during the past decade, according to the US 
environmental research body Worldwatch Institute. 
Hydrologists and engineers have less and less 
room for manoeuvre, but a new consensus with 
new actors is taking shape. Since supply can no 
longer be expanded—or only at prohibitive cost 
for many countries—the explosion in demand must 
be curbed along with wasteful practices. An 
estimated 60 per cent of the water used in irrigation &

is lost through inefficient systems,for example. 
Economists have plunged into the debate on 
water and made quite a few waves. To obtain “rational 
use” of water, i.e. avoiding waste and maintaining 
quality, they say consumers must be made to pay for 
it. Out of the question, reply those in favour of free 
water, which some cultures regard as “a gift from 
heaven”. And what about the poor, ask the champions 
of human rights and the right to water? Other 
important and prickly questions being asked by 
decision-makers are how to calculate the “real price” 
of water and who should organize its sale. 
The state 
as mediator 
The principle of free water is being challenged. 
For many people, water has become a commodity 
to be bought and sold. But management of this 
shared resource cannot be left exclusively to market 
forces. Many elements of civil society—N GOs, 
researchers, community groups—are campaigning 
for the cultural and social aspects of water 
management to be taken into account.

Even the World Bank, the main advocate of nN... 
water privatization, is cautious on this point. It 
recognizes the value of the partnerships between the 
public and private sectors which have sprung up in 
recent years. Only the state seems to be in a position 
to ensure that practices are fair and to mediate 
between the parties involved—consumer groups, 
private firms and public bodies. At any rate, water 
regulation and management systems need to be 
based on other than purely financial criteria. If they 
aren’t,hundreds of millions of people will have no 
access to it. nu

### 114977: A Thirsty planet

### 262562: What price water?

A thirsty planet 
e now have less than half the amount of water 
Ww available per capita than we did 50 years ago. In 
1950,world reserves, (after accounting for agricultural, 
industrial and domestic uses) amounted to 16.8 thousand 
cubic metres per person. Today, global reserves have 
dropped to 7.3 thousand cubic metres and are expected to 
fall to 4.8 thousand in just 25 years. 
Scientists have developed many ways of measuring 
supplies and evaluating water scarcity. In the maps at right, 
“ catastrophic” levels mean that reserves are unlikely to 
sustain a population in the event of a crisis like drought. 
Low supplies refer to levels which put in danger industrial 
development or ability to feed a population. 
Just 50 years ago, not a country in the world faced 
catastrophic water supply levels. Today, about 35 per cent 
of the population lives under these conditions. By 2025, 
about two-thirds will have to cope with low if not 
catastrophic reserves. In contrast,” water rich” regions and 
countries— such as northern Europe, Canada,almost 
everywhere in South America,Central Africa,the Far East 
and Oceania— will continue to enjoy ample reserves. 
The sharp declines reflect the soaring water demands of 
growing populations, agricultural needs and 
industrialization.In addition, nature has been far from even- 
handed.More than 40 per cent of the water in rivers, 
reservoirs and lakes is concentrated in just six countries: 
Brazil,Russia,Canada,the United States, China and India. 
Meanwhile just two per cent of river, reservoir and lake 
water is found in about 40 per cent of the world’s land 
mass. 
As a result,in 2025 Europe and the United States will 
have half the per capita reserves they did in 1950, while 
Asia and Latin America will have just a quarter of what they 
previously enjoyed. But the real drama is likely to hit Africa 
and the Middle East, where available supplies by 2025 may 
be only an eighth of what they were in 1950. [|

### 114978: Who pays the piper? Who calls the tune?

Who pays the piper? 
Who calls the tune? 
By putting a price tag on water, we may be able to save this vital resource from 
waste. But can privatization schemes ensure that everyone is served? John 
Briscoe of the World Bank argues for a greater role for the market. But French 
academic Bernard Barraqué sees danger in treating water like private property. 
Colin Green, self-described iconoclast and economist, asks the questions. 
A water vendor in Jodhpur 
Colin Green:“Water as an economic 
A resource” is generating tremendous 
controversy and discussion. 
What does this mean in practical terms? 
John Briscoe: Two things. First, there is a cost 
associated with providing services like water supply 
or irrigation. As with other services, users should pay 
for the cost of those services to ensure among other 
things accountability to users and financial 
sustainability. In developing countries, it is often 
claimed that services must be subsidized to protect 
the poor. Yet in virtually every case, the influential 
or powerful people benefit from the subsidy, while 
the poor don’t receive formal services and end up 
paying water vendors about ten times more than the 
cost of the service. T here is broad agreement on this. 
The second point is more subtle and 
contested—what economists call the “opportunity 
cost of water”. Imagine a basin where all the water 
is already used.By using one cubic metre of water 
(even if it is free),l impose a cost on everyone else 
who is denied the opportunity to use that water. In 
technical terms, the highest value of the use denied 
is called “the opportunity cost”. The controversy 
stems from how to deal with this cost.In the past, 
 
2 2 The Unesco Courier - February 1999 
the general solution has been that “government 
will allocate water.” But it has become painfully 
clear that governments are not very good at this task. 
There are several alternatives: one is to charge users 
a price and thus ration a scarce resource. This is 
strongly resisted by current users, with good reason, 
since it isreally an abrogation of an existing formal 
or informal property right. A more creative approach 
has been to assign property rights to users and then 
allow them to trade those rights. This is not a “free 
market”. Indeed, it requires a great deal of 
regulation. Informal markets have long existed 
wherever there has been water scarcity. But in recent 
decades, there has been enormous progress in 
establishing formal markets in places like California 
in the United States,Chile, Australia and Mexico. 
Bernard Barraqué: Water is first a natural resource, 
and in some cases it becomes both a social and 
economic good. In Europe, we tend to think that a 
price should not be attached to water in its natural 
environment. Conversely, the cost of installing 
technology to make this water useful should be at 
least partly covered by users. 
Under European water laws, people can take 
small amounts of water directly from the source for 
free. The general trend in the public water system 
is for consumers to pay a small flat fee for the 
connection or for a basic allowance of water. Beyond 
that,they pay for what they use. 
In the case of non-domestic users fully or over- 
exploiting a basin, I think that there should be 
abstraction levies, particularly for irrigation. A very 
small levy on irrigators can liberate a lot of water for 
other users. However, it is important to understand 
that these economic incentives (levies) are more 
efficient when they are set up by “users’boards”than 
by central regulators. 
Colin Green: Is the water crisis really a food crisis? Is 
the problem the availability of water for irrigation? 
John Briscoe offers a similar response to that of 
Bernard Barraqué: Irrigation is the world’s biggest 
user (of water) because water is not only abstracted 
but also evaporates, meaning it does not return to

the river basin. The problem is not making water 
available for irrigation, but ensuring that it is 
efficiently used. However, the crisis is very 
complicated. There is, for example, the growing 
problem of pollution. 
Colin Green: Economists have developed a variety 
of ways to assess the value of natural resources. 
But for some people, a resource like wetland has an 
intrinsic value which cannot be measured in dollars. 
How do we include these moral concerns in 
economic analyses? 
John Briscoe: I would not call a wetland a “moral 
concern”. It is something people value or want 
because it provides a variety of very important 
services,including aesthetic ones and even just so 
that it will exist. T he logical approach is to find 
ways of getting stake-holders to manage 
comprehensively the wetland and the entire aquatic 
ecosystem. 
Bernard Barraqué: Some suggest that by pricing 
the “services” flowing from that wetland, we can 
ensure that people value and respect that resource. 
I don’t agree with this. Economists have not yet 
found a way of truly evaluating all of the assets of a 
resource like a wetland. 
Colin Green: Many economists believe that all uses 
of water should be charged at the price equal to 
the costs of making that water available. Are prices 
really effective in reducing the use and waste of 
water? 
John Briscoe: Water pricing and metering are 
certainly effective in reducing demand. It isn’t hard 
to see why this should be the case, since it is true for 
everything else we consume. 
Bernard Barraqué: Water supply systems are cheap 
to run but expensive to build. This is basically why 
developing countries installing a water supply scheme 
must rely on heavy subsidies and cheap loans, just as 
developed countries did in the past. Once the initial 
systems have been completed, then it becomes possible 
to raise the prices to cover long-term maintenance of 
the systems, as is the case in northern Europe. 
What price water?

The water flows

it stagnates and

becomes as one with 
the air we breathe. It

lengthens the hours for 
lovers, prolongs

Jaime Sabines 
(1926-),Mexico 
[ 
Water meters don’t necessarily lead to reduced 
consumption. Most European studies have shown 
that consumption of water for indoor purposes— 
drinking, cooking, and bathing—does not vary 
according to the price charged. Conversely, outdoor 
uses—like filling swimming pools, washing cars and 
watering gardens—are more sensitive to prices. So we 
have to be careful about making blanket statements 
concerning metering. There is another point to be 
made. While there is a lot of talk about domestic 
metering, little attention has gone to the savings that 
could result from metering large irrigation schemes. 
Colin Green: Some economists argue that rights to 
abstract water should be made tradable. This 
requires that individuals have a legal right to 
abstract water, which implies a sense of ownership. 
Should existing laws be changed to create that 
right? 
John Briscoe: Where there 1s water, there are 
implicit rights to that water and conflicts over those 
rights. By formally defining these rights, we can 
establish clearer and more efficient ways of dealing 
with a problem that is intrinsic to human existence. 
The “trading system”in question has proven to be 
a success in places like California, where laws were 
passed authorizing farmers to sell their water rights 
to cities during a drought. T he economic and social 
benefits of this system are clear. 
Bernard Barraqué: In Europe, “private” waters are 
declining in importance, but this does not mean that 
they have become “government-owned” .Europeans 
generally consider water to be a common property, 
which can be used but not owned. In most cases, the 
state does not assume the role of direct manager of 
the resources but acts as a kind of guarantor that 
different kinds of users share the resources according 
to equity, equality and ethical principles. This 
balanced system allows more flexibility than 
privatization of resources, and what’s more it can be 
accompanied by monetary compensation.

### 262562: What price water?

### 114978: Who pays the piper? Who calls the tune?

John Briscoe: Both. This is a big subject, with 
many red herrings! No one has truly “privatized” 
water services except England and Wales. We more 
commonly find what French colleagues call 
“delegated management”, in which ownership 
remains public while private operators are 
responsible for a variety of tasks which they do 
better than public operators. There is no magic 
regulatory solution to the monopoly problem in 
which water is either a public or a private domain. 
I strongly believe that a mixed system in which 
public operators look over their shoulders at private 
competitors, and vice-versa,offers the best hope for 
getting people good services at a reasonable cost. 
Bernard Barraqué: I agree with John that mixed 
systems are in fact superior. T here is a wide array of 
partial privatization schemes across Western Europe. 
In practice, “privatization” occurs when the public 
system fails. There is a general feeling that 
privatization is the only choice. But there are 
alternatives. For example, some countries might 
find it advantageous to tie together different kinds 
of services like gas, electricity and water in a more 
efficient system of financing and billing. 
Colin Green: Public participation is considered a 
critical ingredient to sustainable development. How 
can we combine increased public participation with 
privatization? 
John Briscoe: Astute observers have argued that 
the greatest benefit of getting the private sector 
involved is precisely that it brings greater public 
Valencia: a thousand years 
of calm waters 
T farmers of Valencia, on the river Turia on Spain’s east coast, take their rights to water very 
seriously. For over a thousand years, they have relied on their city's Water Tribunal to guarantee 
that water drawn from the Turia is distributed fairly. Although they are not lawyers and do not keep 
a written record of the verdicts they reach, and although there is no prison for offenders, eight 
Sindicos or magistrates meet under the Porch of the Apostles of the Cathedral of Valencia and settle 
verbally the disputes arising between farmers over the right to use water from the channels 
irrigating the 17,000 hectares of what is known as the “ Orchard of Valencia” .

underground sewerage and 
drinking-water installations 
in Guatemala City. 
This scene, which has been re-enacted every Thursday at midday since the middle of the 
tenth century, when Abd-ar-Rahman Ill was the caliph of Cordoba, makes the “ Tribunal de las 
Aguas de la Vega de Valencia” the oldest law court in Europe. 
The eight magistrates who are dressed in black and are accompanied by a bailiff bearing 
the tribunal’s emblem, represent each of the “mother channels” which are used for irrigation 
and for distribution of the water from the Turia. The roughly 1,500 farmers from each of these 
channel systems elect their own magistrate, who is required to be someone who actually 
farmsthe land and is not simply a landowner. The task of these “ people’s judges” is to ensure 
that all the farmers of Valencia are supplied with the water they need through application of 
the provisions of a decree promulgated by King James | of Aragon in 1238, which is still in force 
and provides that “ Everybody shall be entitled to a share of the water in proportion to the 
amount of land owned”. 
The most common complaints with which the Court has to deal are concerned with the 
squandering or theft of water at times of drought, the disruption of channels, damage to 
crops asa result of water overflowing onto adjoining land, and failure to comply with irrigation 
schedules and to keep the channels clean so that the water can flow along them freely. =m

scrutiny, openness and accountability. In England 
and Wales (considered by some to be a model of 
water privatization, but a model I am personally not 
a fan of), the local community, press, and public at 
large are much more involved than they were before 
privatization. 
When people are faced with unresponsive and 
unaccountable bureaucracies, they tend to resign 
themselves to inefficient services. They don’t voice 
their demands. With privatization, people are paying 
for a service,have a clear view of the obligations of 
the provider and will not accept poor services. In 
many countries which have experienced 
privatization, we find people beginning to make 
the same demands of publicly provided services. 
T his may prove to be the greatest benefit associated 
with private water management. 
Bernard Barraqué: I disagree with John concerning 
public participation in England and Wales. 
Privatization led to an adversarial form of 
participation. In France also, people tend to have less 
confidence in private management. T his might be a 
good reason to keep some role for local government. 
Privatization is ideologically based on 
“consumerizing” a service. In the process, people 
assume the role of a customer, not a citizen. As a 
citizen, an individual might feel a civic responsibility 
to cut down on water use especially during a 
drought. A customer, on the other hand, expects the 
service paid for,no matter what. 
It takes a lot of information about how water is 
used, for example, to run an efficient system. Public 
participation offers this information and so 
ultimately lowers the system’s running costs. At 
the same time, a more informed consumer may 
also be a more demanding citizen. For example, in 
France people complain about high water prices. 
They insist on having individual meters even when 
those meters aren’t really efficient.Sure, the meters 
will tell them how much water they used. But those 
people still aren’t going to see that their water bills 
are covering costs to clean up industrial pollution 
connected to public sewers, for example, or to clean 
up nitrates from agriculture. With more information, 
those same people might start demanding a more 
sustainable water policy. un

### 114981: Hungary: under new management

Hungary: UNAEr NeW management 
Hungary is diving into the whirlpool of privatization but the country’s new 
water companies have failed to make a splash 
  
It looks the same. Tastes the same. It even 
smells the same, with that familiar foul whiff 
of chlorine. But the seemingly ordinary glass 
of water is becoming more and more precious for 
the two million inhabitants of Budapest. Between 
1991 and 1999, water prices increased threefold. 
Across Hungary, people have seen their water bills 
grow as much as five times as state budgets dry up, 
leaving public utilities to either cut services or 
charge higher rates. 
After 40 years of socialist mismanagement, 
Hungarians have developed an allergy to anything 
centrally-run.As a result, the water utilities, which 
used to be run mostly by state bodies, were 
transformed into share-holding companies 
belonging to the municipal governments between 
1991 and 1994. However, many of the local 
governments are finding the responsibilities of the 
companies to be more than they bargained for. 
To begin with, municipal authorities had to 
raise the water bills of the people who elected 
them. Second, the inherited infrastructure is in 
need of major investment. While the supply system 
ensures that almost everyone has water, very little 
of the water used is treated. In Budapest, for 
example, about 70 per cent of all waste water is 
dumped into the Danube each year (about 193 
million cubic metres in 1998), to the growing 
chagrin of downstream neighbours. Under the 
Sophia Convention of 1994, Hungary has agreed 
to curb this pollution but the infrastructure 
required will cost about three billion dollars. 
In their search for revenue, municipal 
governments are increasingly turning to 
privatization. Between 1994 and 1997, they sold 
25 to 50 per cent of the shares of six of the more 
than 200 municipal water companies. These six 
companies supply water to about a quarter of the 
population nation-wide. 
But judging by initial results, it will take some 
time before that investment translates into 
improved supply and treatment systems. In 
Budapest, for example, new revenues from the 
privatized system are supposed to cover not just 
operating costs but also repairs, notably, 
reconstruction of 10 per cent of the capital’s 4,400 
kilometres of pipeline each year. Yet only 30 
kilometres of pipeline were fixed last year. 
However, there is still a popular conviction that 
private managers are bound to do better than civil 
servants. Indeed, economic efficiency has 
improved in the capital over the last couple of 
years, since some of the water assets were bought 
by a Franco-German consortium for $91 million. 
The consortium manages the system, while the 
municipality retains control over key issues like 
water pricing. 
Last year, the consortium managed to trim 
about $12 million from operating costs, essentially 
by restructuring and cutting jobs. The investors 
received 75 per cent of these savings. The 
remaining 25 per cent were used to keep prices as 
low as possible. Even so, last year’s rates still rose 
more than 20 per cent against a consumer price 
index increase of 13 to 14 per cent. For this year, 
private investors originally proposed a 25 per cent 
increase which the local government rejected.Only 
after protracted negotiations did the two sides 
agree to a compromise of 13 per cent,slightly more 
than the predicted inflation rate. 
The bottom line is clear: no one is satisfied. 
Private investors are faced with companies that 
continue to lose money, while municipal 
authorities fear the political costs from rising water 
prices. Meanwhile, ordinary citizens hold their 
noses over glasses of water that cost more each 
year. nu

We consists of two atoms of hydrogen and one of oxygen. It also contains potassium, iron,

for bottled water, which is dominated by the multinational companies Nestlé and Danone, is a fast- 
growing sector, with an annual consumption of 80,000 million litres. 
The definition of mineral water accepted by FAO's Codex Alimentarius, which is used as an 
international yardstick,says that natural mineral water is water directly extracted from the earth and 
bottled close to its source, with a stable composition and subject to as little processing as possible. 
This rules out water which is mineralized after extraction, water for medicinal purposes (which is 
often sold in chemists’ shops) and water from the mains that is simply bottled. 
The market for mineral water, which is synonymous with health and high quality of living, is 
also growing. According to figures provided by the specialized consultant Euromonitor, sales 
worldwide increased by some 25.5 per cent between 1993 and 1997 rising from 46,430 to 58,290 
million litres. 
In terms of consumption, the Italians and the French appear to be the peoples who are keenest 
on mineral water, since they consume more than 100 litres per person per year, twice the amount 
drunk by the Spanish (55 litres) and 20 times more than the Japanese (5 litres). 
Mineral water is also trendy. It is used in the manufacture of cosmetics, and in some countries 
there are bars where only different kinds of mineral water are sold, as well as professional water- 
tasters whose job it isto appraise its qualities. By contrast, in many developing countries bottled water 
(often sold in large flagons) is a must, because of the poor quality of the mains water. The United 
Nations Development Programme's latest Human Development Report notes that if all the world’s 
population had access to clean drinking water, two million lives a year would be saved. [|

### 114982: South Africa: water for everyone

south Africa: Water for everyone 
A progressive new water management policy designed to provide 
all South Africans with guaranteed access to water

communal tap in a South 
African township.

lim pidity, water is an

~~ 
Among the many stories of deprivation told by 
ordinary South Africans during three months of 
nation-wide poverty hearings last year, one event 
still stands out. In a village in northern Kwazulu- 
Natal, crocodiles had reportedly killed a handful of 
women who went to a river to collect water for their 
basic needs. 
As that event graphically testifies, water poverty is 
literally a life and death matter in South Africa, where 
about a third of the country’s 36 million people lacks 
access to adequate supplies of potable water, and 
almost two-thirds lack basic sanitation. The domino 
effects are severe. The poverty hearings, organized by 
non-governmental organizations and churches, were 
filled with accounts of children missing school because 
of water-related illness, and women kept out of the 
productive labour force to take care of them. T here 1s 
also the ecological damage caused by lack of sanitation 
facilities, which leaves rivers flowing with disease. 
But change is underway as South Africa enacts 
what many consider one of the world’s most 
progressive water management policies. 
  
Learning to share 
T he first part of this new policy involves installation 
of collective pumps to ensure that by 2004 every 
South African has ready access to at least 25 litres of 
clean water a day within 200 metres of home. In 
addition, efforts are being made to install more private 
taps and to improve sanitation—an undertaking 
which is proving difficult as many communities have 
trouble paying for these new services. 
The second part is more ambitious: to dismantle 
an apartheid-era system that reserves the precious 
resource for a rich minority. Black townships are a sorry 
sight of people lugging buckets or pushing rickety 
wheelbarrows filled with water containers. Yet the 
neighbouring suburbs are a lush haven where an 
average home has at least two bathrooms and a kitchen, 
while garden-hoses are left on for hours to keep the 
grass green in a city like Soweto. 
In the countryside, women in Kwazulu-Natal are 
killed by crocodiles while farmers in the same area 
irrigate their crops almost for free. Not only do the 
latter have riparian rights to water on, under or adjacent 
to their property, but also they tap into sources located 
further away thanks to infrastructure subsidized by the 
state.Industries like forestry and mining also benefit 
from these subsidies. These sectors “have the lion’s 
share of water allocation at the moment,” says Mike 
Muller, Director General of the Water Affairs 
department. “T here will have to be some sharing.” 
The right to collect water 
for subsistence 
This is where the new National Water Act comes 
in. Approved by parliament in 1998, it is now becoming 
law. The old riparian rights will be replaced by licenses 
granted for water uses that bring social benefits,such 
as job creation and economic empowerment.Licensing 
preference will go to new actors, particularly emerging 
black farmers, while a review board will hear appeals 
from those who lose out as a result of the act. 
The act entrenches the individual's right to collect 
water at the source for subsistence. “In many senses 
this is about liberating water from the tyranny of the 
landowner,” says the Water Affairs Minister, Kader 
Asmal. 
Under the current system, rich and poor families in 
Soweto, for example, both pay about 60 cents per cubic 
metre regardless of whether they use that water to fill a 
swimming pool or cook a meal. Under the new system, 
different rates will apply for different uses. The poorest 
people relying on collective pumps will pay about 80 
cents per month—a fraction of the true costs—per 
cubic metre. When it comes to private taps, everyone will 
receive a basic supply of water at a minimum, subsidized 
price. For supplies above basic needs, about $1.60 per 
cubic metre will be charged, with an even higher rate for 
luxury uses like filling pools. Steep rates will also be fixed 
for large landowners and industrialists. 
The mere idea of water-pricing has set off a 
political explosion. Parties representing the poor 
and black constituency, the African National 
Congress and the Inkatha Freedom Party, support the 
act. Yet opposition is virulent from the right-wing 
Freedom Front representing white farmers, the 
Democratic Party favouring business interests and the 
more broadly-based white Nationalist Party. nu

### 114983: Mexico: the sweet smell of success

Mexico: the sweet smell of success 
In Mexico’s Jalisco State, a sugar mill has reduced its water consumption 
by four-fifths and cut its costs 
  
Mending an antiquated 
installation. 
The smell of burning sugar and the lengths of cut 
cane strewn along the dirt road point the way to 
the San Francisco Ameca sugar mill in Mexico’s 
Jalisco state, the home of tequila, 73 kilometres from 
the city of Guadalajara. To the naked eye, the mill 
seems just like any other, with its tall chimneys, the 
sound of escaping steam and the comings and goings 
of its workers. Yet this factory stands apart. Until four 
years ago, the mill needed 15 litres of water to 
produce one kilogram of sugar. Now it uses only 
three litres. 
Besides reducing production costs, this “miracle” 
is of direct benefit to the river Ameca, the mill’s main 
source of supply and one of Jalisco’s three largest 
rivers. 
“We have made all these changes at the mill 
because we are convinced of the need to show concern 
for the water supply problem and also because water 
1s becoming an increasingly expensive item,” says 
chemist Matilde Osorio Cruz, head of the mill’s 
manufacturing laboratory. In the space of five years, 
the price of water, a basic ingredient in sugar 
production,has risen fifteenfold. 
An image of St. Francis is displayed near to the 
gates of the factory, which was founded in 1903. 
From that time until barely four years ago, sugar 
production required enormous amounts of water, 
which was drawn from the river Ameca. At the end of 
the process,most of the waste water was discharged 
back into the river and contaminated it. Unlike metals 
or other types of toxic chemical waste, the by-products 
of sugar, consisting chiefly of molasses, are eventually 
absorbed by the river but consume a considerable 
amount of oxygen, thereby depriving fish and plant 
life of sustenance.

According to Osorio, as a result of the measures 
taken this problem has been completely resolved. 
“The first thing we did was to set up a water treatment 
plant,” she says. “Then we started to use closed circuits 
in which the water circulates continuously through the 
different parts of the process without any of it being 
lost, as used to be the case.” In practical terms, the 
system devised is somewhat similar to that of the 
bloodstream, in which the fluid circulates and is 
processed without having to be renewed. 
Closed circuits 
to prevent waste 
Among the innovations introduced, Osorio cites 
the creation of a cooling tank to bring down the 
temperature of the water, which is very hot when it 
emerges from one part of the process, before using it 
again. The tank looks like an enormous fountain, 
since the system consists of a set of perforated pipes 
through which the water gushes before cooling in 
contact with the air. Thanks to the system, the water 
temperature is reduced from 45° to 38°C. Once the 
water has cooled, it is fed back into the system. 
The project was made possible through support 
provided by the United Nations Industrial 
Development Organization (UNIDO), with the 
participation of Mexico’s National Chamber of the 
Sugar and Alcohol Industry, the Group of Sugar- 
Exporting Countries of Latin America and the 
Caribbean (GEPLACEA) and the National Autonomous 
University of Mexico (UNAM). Similar systems are 
being used at the Motzorongo and El Potrero mills in 
the Mexican state of Veracruz. 
The San Francisco mill is the pilot plant of the 
Beta San Miguel group, which owns a further four 
mills in Mexico, to which it plans to extend the 
water-conservation experience gained at Ameca. 
According to information provided by UNIDO, 
its $493,000 loan to the mill could be recouped in two 
years as a result of cost savings. Sergio Miranda Cruz, 
the UNIDO official behind the technical studies 
culminating in this experiment, considers that “the 
results have been so positive that the project could 
develop into a full-scale programme. But quite frankly 
we have not yet reached that point.” 
The sugar-cane harvest started in November 1998 
and will go on until May 1999.The machinery works 
night and day. T he mill will produce some 100,000 
tonnes of sugar and will consume 3,156 cubic metres 
of water per tonne produced. For the mill’s technical 
staff and workers, optimizing water consumption and 
improving sugar quality present a difficult but 
rewarding challenge. u

### 114984: India: Calcutta plugs its deficit

india: Calcutta plugs its deficit 
Short of money to overhaul an antiquated water system, the Indian city may 
have opened a pandora’s box by extending the coverage of its water tax 
Standing in a long, winding queue, Ratan Das 
A eagerly awaits his turn to get a bucket of water 
from the public tap in Topsia slum in southern 
Calcutta, capital of India’s West Bengal state. Das, 
like the 200 other people who live in the slum and 
are dependent on the tap, is anxious to reach it 
before the water stops flowing. If he misses out 
now, he will have to wait another four hours, 
sometimes even more, to get his fill. 
Not far from Topsia, Meenakshi Mukherjee, a 
middle-class housewife living in a one-room flat, 
has an array of vessels under the single water tap in 
her house. She needs to store as much water as 
possible before the pipe stops pumping out water 
and instead coughs out air. 
Will the poor 
foot the bill? 
The travails of Das and Mukherjee in their daily 
struggle for water are typical for Calcutta and its 
five million people. The city’s antiquated distribution 
network, built mostly during British rule in India, has 
long since been unable to cope with the strains of 
population growth. Meanwhile, the impoverished 
state government has lacked the money needed to 
overhaul the crumbling water system. As a result, the 
leftist state and municipal governments are now 
extending their water taxes to the middle classes. 
Poor people fear they might be next in line to pay tax 
on water. 
The decision to extend the water tax—which 
hitherto has been paid only by the rich and by 
commercial users—was taken by Calcutta’s M arxist-

dominated city government last month. The tax 
has been introduced under World Bank pressure in 
return for loans to help refurbish the city’s 
hydrological infrastructure. 
The new tax will be applied to all buildings 
four or more storeys high—the kind of residential 
buildings popular amongst the middle class. It will 
in effect cover an extra 10 per cent of city residents 
and will hopefully raise $5 million a year, helping to 
plug the municipal government’s $17.5 million a 
year water systems budget deficit. Currently, only 
five per cent of domestic users pay water tax. 
Commercial users account for 95 per cent of the 
annual $2.4 million now raised from the water tax. 
A cutback 
on public taps 
Meanwhile, to cut down on waste due to leakage 
through antiquated pipes, the government will close 
600 ofthe 12,000 public water taps. For Calcutta’s 
1.2 million poor, these public taps are the only 
form of access to water. The cutback on taps has 
raised serious concern among slum and pavement 
dwellers. “Today I have to wait for hours to get a

bucket of water. If they close the tap in my slum 
where shall I go?” asks Mohammed Saleem, who 
lives in Entally slum in east Calcutta. 
The government reckons that the public’s 
criticism of the water tax is the price it has to pay for 
the water system to be improved. In return for its 
tough tax reforms, the government hopes to get 
World Bank help to revamp the city’s entire water and 
sewerage system. Currently the World Bank is 
undertaking a $ 2.5 million feasibility study for a water 
systems overhaul which could cost $200 million. 
Hopefully, the new tax revenues will help the city 
improve water quality as well as quantity. “It is 
unsafe to drink water directly from the pipes in 
Calcutta,” says Arindam Ghosh, a scientist at the 
National Environmental Engineering Research 
Institute. According to Ghosh, the existing water 
treatment plants in the city cannot remove 
hazardous chemicals dissolved in the water, taken 
directly from the heavily polluted Ganges. As a 
result, water-borne diseases are common. u

needs in a year. 
Instead of paying the political costs of publicly 
recognizing this deficit, leaders rely on the convenient 
solution of “virtual water”. To raise a tonne of wheat, 
you need 1,000 tonnes of water. Importing a million 
tonnes of wheat is the equivalent to importing a billion 
tonnes (cubic metres) of water. Since the end of the 
1980s, the MEN A region has been importing 40 
million tonnes of cereals and flour annually. More 
virtual water “flows” into the region each year than 
flows down the Nile into Egypt for agriculture. 
Piping desalinated water 
to desert farms 
Not only is this virtual water readily available, it 
is extraordinarily cheap. Wheat prices have been 
falling for the past century. On the current 
agricultural market which is dominated by the 
United States and the European Union, wheat is 
traded at about half the production cost.

So it seems that the MENA region is simply 
making the most of the situation,importing a highly 
subsidized product containing a precious resource. 
Yet depending on international trade for such a 
vital resource is not socially acceptable in these 
countries nor is it a strategically secure policy. This 
partially explains why in the United Arab Emirates 
desalinated water is either piped kilometres to reach 
farms in the desert or soil is actually moved from one 
area to another to build new farms for greater food 
self-sufficiency. Up until 1991,Saudi Arabia used 
significant amounts of fossil water—which is 
extraordinarily pure but non-renewable—to grow 
corn. “The Great Man-Made River Project” is 
Libya’s solution to achieving greater food self- 
sufficiency. The plan is to pump water from deep 
wells in the north of the country and then send it 
through underground pipes to irrigate about 
200,000 hectares along the Mediterranean coast at 
an estimated capital cost of $25 billion. These are

extreme examples. But consider the case of Egypt, 
where about 90 per cent of the national water 
budget goes to agriculture and yet another 7.5 
million tonnes of grain, equivalent to 7.5 billion 
cubic metres of virtual water, were still imported last 
year to feed the population of about 63 million. 
By downplaying the role of virtual water,there 
is a risk that countries will undervalue their own 
resources and put off innovative and painful policies. 
Irrigation water is almost free in Egypt, which 
makes for a very expensive policy. The same water 
could bring a hundred times more in returns in 
the industrial or service sectors. However, there 
are major political costs involved in such a transition.

hectares each. These people cannot suddenly be 
expected to pay for water or abandon their livelihoods. 
Time is required to change people’s perceptions of 
water and to develop a diverse economy capable of 
creating new jobs in other sectors. 
Israel is an interesting case in point. This was a 
country committed to making the desert bloom. Its 
farmers have the means to employ the most efficient 
irrigation systems. And yet,during the past ten years,the 
government has shown that it is possible to reduce water 
allocations to agriculture. It is one of the few countries 
in the world to charge a high proportion of the delivery 
cost (40 per cent) for irrigation water. But the current 
prices would have to double or even treble for the real cost 
of water to be recovered. 
Other MENA countries, like Jordan, Tunisia and 
Morocco, are starting to take the same approach. 
The trade in virtual water could offer more time and 
ease the political tensions in making this difficult 
transition. Or it could be used to avoid dealing with 
a very real problem. u

Across the Middle East, government officials 
refuse to discuss the issue of virtual water 
publicly. Even academics are reluctant to express 
their views on the topic. Why such silence? After all, 
publicly-available statistics clearly indicate the 
region’s wheat imports are rising, and there is 
reason to believe that this trade will continue as 
countries seek seemingly inexpensive and readily 
available sources to compensate for dwindling water 
supplies. Technological solutions seem unlikely to 
tackle the scarcity problem. With falling oil prices 
devastating government revenues, even wealthy 
countries like Saudi Arabia are finding desalinization 
increasingly unaffordable. 
n It’s like trying to get water out of a stone. In part, the silence stems from the political 
climate.“There are a lot of negotiations going on 
right now on various security issues, including 
water-sharing agreements. Any information linked 
to water scarcity is sensitive,” explains Mamdouh 
Shahin, a Netherlands-based Egyptian professor 
of civil engineering widely respected in the Middle 
East for his hydrological assessments of the region. 
Virtual water also has a dirty name among the 
region’s hydrologists and policy-makers who balk at 
the notion that governments should import food 
crops instead of growing them. Yes, the region is 
faced with a water crisis. Yes,importing wheat is an 
effective means for dealing with the problem. But 
does this mean that countries should abandon their ®

agricultural sectors, or make their farmers pay prices 
reflecting the real costs of irrigation? 
“I disagree with the suggestion that we should totally 
depend on virtual water to feed our people,” says Shahin. 
“Virtual water is one solution. But we need a basket of 
solutions—by conserving and developing conventional 
and non-conventional water sources like harvesting fog 
residue or re-using drainage waters from irrigation and 
urban uses.” 
Don’t overcharge the farmers 
Complete agricultural self-sufficiency may well be 
impossible in the region. But for Shahin, this does not mean 
that governments should abandon the goal of improving 
harvest yields. “Food imports are even more strategically 
sensitive than energy imports. You can live without oil, but 
not without food,” says Shahin. He notes that one danger 
of virtual water is that importing nations would be 
vulnerable in the event that grain producing countries cut 
subsidies to their farmers, potentially leading to significantly 
higher prices. 
“Water for irrigation will remain a free commodity as 
long as people remain so poor. This is in the interest of the 
people and the administration,” says Shahin. 
Food imports are even more 
strategically sensitive than energy 
imports. You can live without oil, 
but not without food 
Currently many irrigation systems are wasteful, 
and given the low price of water, there is little incentive 
to introduce technology that would improve efficiency 
and cut down waste. But, Shahin says, the solution 
doesn’t lie in pushing farmers from their livelihoods by 
charging them for the water they use. Instead, he 
proposes investing in more efficient irrigation systems, 
like drip irrigation in which perforated pipes installed 
just below the soil surface release small amounts of 
water directly to the crops’ roots—a system which 
reduces evaporation and seepage. T he challenge lies in 
finding capital to finance technological improvements. 
Shahin also points out that there are strong religious 
objections to charging for water. “According to the

Koran, if you find someone who needs water but is 
unable to reward or compensate you in any way, you 
must give them some for the sake of God’s blessing 
and mercy,” he says. “So in countries like Egypt and 
Syria, rivers are considered a gift of God. And since 
the people are too poor to compensate the 
government for the price of delivering that water, 
there is no charge.” 
Virtual imports vs. virtual exports 
The concept of virtual water also comes under 
attack from an economic perspective,says Jad Isaac, 
director-general of the Applied Research Institute of 
Jerusalem, a non-profit organization for sustainable 
development in Palestinian territories. “If we are going 
to talk about virtual imports,” he says, “we should also 
consider our virtual exports (of fruits and vegetables) 
to Europe and the United States.” For Isaac, the 
question is not whether countries should abandon their 
agricultural sectors, but rather, which types of 
agriculture should be given priority: wheat for food 
security, or high value cash crops like vegetables and 
fruits?“It’s all about economics and following market 
forces,” Isaacs says. “With globalization, there is not 
a country in the world that can declare itself self- 
sufficient.” 
“Whether we like it or not,” says Isaac, “water 1s a 
finite resource. It would be totally wrong to use it 
uneconomically.” According to Isaac, government has 
the responsibility to provide free water for domestic 
needs. But agriculture is an economic activity and so 
farmers should pay for irrigation. “It has to happen, but 
slowly because such a large part of the labour force 
depends on agriculture. You cannot suddenly transform 
developing countries into industrialized ones,” he says. 
Even highly developed nations like Israel, which 
receives tremendous financial and other forms of 
assistance from the United States and other Western 
governments,have failed to adopt an economically 
efficient agricultural policy. “Many think there has 
been a change in Israeli policy, but the government 
1s still subsidizing water,” says Isaac. He notes that 
Israel has one of the region’s highest percentages of 
irrigated agriculture—about 50 per cent of its arable 
land—but that agriculture contributes less than 
two per cent to the economy. On the other hand, 
Isaac notes that the Palestinian agricultural sector 
represents about 20 per cent of the economy, even 
though only six per cent of its arable land is irrigated. 
“The Israeli policy doesn’t make sense,” says 
Isaac. T hey should give the water they took by force 
back to the Palestinians who can do more in their 
development with it.” With a gross national product 
(GNP) of about $17,000 per capita, Isaac maintains 
that Israel can afford to orient its economy towards 
high-technology sectors and depend less on farming. 
In contrast, Palestinian per capita GNP is about 
$1,000 and dependent on agriculture, says Isaac. 
That is why Palestinians should continue to develop 
farming in the short term, while gradually building an 
industrial base. Says Isaac: “It’s like a baby. First he 
crawls, then he walks and then he learns to run.” HW

Custom-built 
solutions for 
International disputes 
Joseph W. Dellapenna* 
  
Customary law provides a 
sounder basis than market 
forces for water sharing in 
international river basins 
derives from the Latin “rivalis”, meaning people 
who live on opposite banks of a river? All of the 
214 largest river basins in the world—home to about 
40 per cent of the globe’s total population—are used 
by more than one nation.Even the most cordial and 
co-operative of neighbouring nations have found it 
difficult to achieve acceptable arrangements for their 
transboundary surface waters. 
As the world gropes for solutions to disputes over 
water resources, many who are concerned about 
water issues are increasingly attracted to the idea of 
setting up free market trading systems for water. 
However, market solutions to establishing 
sovereignty over and control of water resources are 
fraught with danger. Rather, we should look to the 
body of international law that countries have been 
slowly developing by drawing on ancient principles 
of sharing dating back centuries. 
It must be noted at the outset that countries have 
recognized that water is too vital a resource for 
nations to go to war. Throughout the many wars 
fought in the twentieth century, water facilities have 
by and large escaped unscathed. In the three major 
wars between Pakistan and India, for example,

For international v rs! 
The Jordan 
The river: The 93-km-long Jordan drains part of the 
territories of Israel,Jordan,Lebanon and Syria, four of the 
states most involved in regional hostilities in the last half 
century. It rises in four tributaries, the Yarmouk in Syria, the 
Banias in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, the Hasbani in 
Israeli-occupied southern Lebanon, and the Dan in Israel.By 
virtue of the 1967 war and the “security zone” created in 
south Lebanon in the early 1980s, Israel is the upstream 
riparian on the upper Jordan system;Syria is upstream on 
the Yarmouk. 
Problems and prospects: Jordan and the Palestinians, 
as downstream riparians of Israel and Syria, are in the worst 
position in the basin. Jordan's dependence on the river 
system isparticularly great, since apart from a few wadis— 
watercourses that are dry except in the rainy season— it 
has no other important sources of fresh water. Three 
attempts have been made to establish an international 
water management regime (in 1953-55, 1976-81, and 
1987-90) but each came to a halt because of an inability 
to include all riparian states in the proposed arrangement. 
A water resources working group wasset up as part of the 
Middle East peace process in 1995 and 1996, but water 
politics specialist Miriam R. Lowi of the Center of 
International Studies at Princeton University notes that 
“the implementation of a water agreement will not be 
effected until the political conflict has reached closure.”

The Nile 
The river: The Nile is 6,700 km long from its most distant 
source to its mouth in the Mediterranean,and drains one- 
tenth of the African continent. The river system is composed 
of two major tributaries, the White Nile and the Blue Nilg 
which rise in Lake Victoria (Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, 
Uganda) and Lake Tana (Ethiopia), respectively. The nine 
nations of the Nile basin are Rwanda, Burundi, the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo, Tanzania, Kenya, 
Uganda, Ethiopia,Sudan and Egypt. 
Problems and prospects: The vast majority of the river's 
flow, estimated at 84 billion m° annually, is used by Egypt, 
by virtue of a 1959 treaty between Egypt and Sudan which 
allocates to the two countries an amount of Nile water 
that adds up to nearly 90% of the river's annual flow. 
Upstream nations such as Ethiopia want to harness the 
Nile's waters to provide economic prosperity for their 
growing population and are challenging Egyptian and 
Sudanese claims.

where already scarce water supplies are in 
unprecedented demand as populations grow and 
lifestyles change with greater industrialization. T hese 
disputes are generally in the form of diplomatic 
controversies, although sometimes more dramatic 
confrontations arise.Every transborder water resource 
is coveted by the countries that share the resource. 
They carefully monitor the amounts used by 
neighbours. 
Markets are now much in vogue as ideal 
institutions for resolving disputes over control of 
water resources and for managing the use of those 
resources efficiently. Basically, the aim is to set up a 
trading system by which water-rich countries sell 
supplies to those in need. Theoretically, markets 
ensure efficiency and peace. Countries don’t dare 
waste a resource for which they have paid dearly. At 
the same time, the market supposedly helps resolve 
water disputes: if one country infringes on the 
“property” of another, compensation can be sought 
in a court. 
A resource with no respect 
for borders 
Twenty years ago, few experts or policy-makers 
would have considered such a proposal seriously. 
Today, the concept is gaining ground thanks to the 
active promotion of major lending institutions like the 
World Bank and other multinational organizations. 
Part of the enthusiasm derives from the triumph of 
Western-style free markets and the assumption that 
there are no credible alternatives for efficiently 
managing resources. But the market supporters 
overlook a critical fact: water, unlike every other 
natural resource except the air we breathe, is ambient. 
It moves. It doesn’t respect borders and so cannot be 
controlled by any single entity. Yet for a market to 
work, clear ownership rights have to be recognized 
before any good can be traded. But how can you 
determine who owns a resource which ebbs and 
swells as it moves from one country to the next? 
True water markets have rarely existed in the 
past, and there is little reason to believe they will in 
the future. A cursory look at the case of the Nile Valley 
highlights the limitations of market-approaches. 
The Blue Nile flows from Ethiopia to Sudan and 
on to Egypt. As is commonly the case, countries 
lower down the basin tend to be richer and more 
developed than those further up. This is because 
small rivers and streams feed into the river as it 
flows, bringing water and nutrients that leave the 
lower basin more fertile. Furthermore, the lower 
basin generally is relatively flat, while the upper 
basin generally is mountainous, making agricultural 
development easier in the lower basin. Indeed, 
Egypt, with a per capita gross domestic product of 
$630/year, is wealthier than Sudan (GDP 
$540/year), and both countries are far more affluent 
than upstream Ethiopia (GDP $120/year). 
Nevertheless,Ethiopia does get the water first. 
One might think, therefore, that the Ethiopian 
government is in a position of strength and can do 
what it wants with the Blue Nile. It could build a

dam, for example, or develop irrigation systems. 
Ethiopia, however, is too poor to pay for this kind 
of infrastructure on its own.Egypt, which fears any 
interference that might interfere with the flows of 
water down the Blue Nile has succeeded in using 
its political clout within multilateral lending 
organizations like the World Bank to block Ethiopia’s 
applications for financial assistance to exploit the 
river. (T he situation may be changing, however,as 
the Egyptian government recently let pass an 
Ethiopian loan application with the World Bank 
for a small-scale irrigation project.) 
Who owns what? 
Ultimately, Egypt claims an absolute right to the 
integrity of the river. According to this principle, 
Ethiopia should do nothing that might affect the 
quantity and quality of water currently flowing to 
Egypt. But such a claim deprives Ethiopia of any 
means of developing its agriculture and condemns 
the country to continued dependence on 
international food aid to stave off mass starvation. 
Imagine that Egypt and Ethiopia decide to set 
up a water market. How would they resolve their 
differences? Ethiopia in theory could buy the right 
to develop the river from Egypt, although in practice 
the price of such a right is likely to be much higher 
than it could afford. Or Egypt could compensate 
Ethiopia for foregoing the Blue Nile’s 
development—another unlikely scenario because 
Egypt considers that it already “owns” the waters it 
uses. 
The major flaw in any market “solution”is the 
failure to determine clearly who owns what. There

are groups of water experts and policy-makers in 
Israel and Jordan, for example, who would like to set 
up a water trade in the region. On the one hand, the 
Israelis,who control the source of the vital Jordan 
River,say that Palestinians should buy water from 
them. And on the other, Palestinians insist that the 
Israelis stole the water from them and should now 
pay for it. 
Let’s imagine that two countries did manage to 
clarify any ownership disputes and began trading in 
water. What about third parties further downstream? 
Water isn’t like mineral resources. Russia can mine 
coal and sell it around the world and neighbouring 
countries barely notice. But try selling part of a

downstream neighbours causing an uproar. 
For years, the Turks have discussed a proposal 
to sell water from the Euphrates to Israel. About 98 
per cent of that river’s flow comes from rain and 
snow on Turkey, which has built one of Asia’s largest 
dams to capture and control these waters. However, 
the Turkish government doesn’t have the money to 
build all the infrastructure needed to use the water 
for irrigation in Turkey. The Turks could sell the 
water to Israel or various Arab nations by building 
a pipeline across Syria to the Jordan Valley or the 
Aerial view of Turkey's Ataturk Arabian peninsula. Perhaps a more realistic option 
dam on the Euphrates. would be to pipe the water to Turkey's 
x Mediterranean coast and then ship it by tanker. 
Claims 
and counterclaims 
Such a deal would have serious repercussions for 
Iraq and Syria, Turkey’s downstream neighbours, 
who depend on the Euphrates. Imagine that Turkey 
did use the dam’s reservoir for irrigation. 
Downstream nations would still reap benefits 
because much of the water used would still reach 
them. Run-off from irrigated fields would feed back 
into the river, and the water that evaporates in the 
reservoir and the fields would eventually return 
through the water cycle. But by shipping Euphrates 
water outside the valley, the Turks cut off these 
benefits. The only option available to Iraq and Syria 
would be to buy the water to which they feel a 
natural right. In my opinion, the solution to 
water scarcity lies not in building water markets but 
in consolidating the rules for sharing found in 
customary international law. To better understand 
the concept of customary law, consider an analogy.

The river: From its source in the Himalayan peaks of Tibet, the Mekong flows for 4,200 km 
through China’s Yunnan province (population 38 million) and through Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, 
Cambodia and Viet Nam, countries populated by around 190 million people, many of them poor. 
Problems and prospects: The river flows through an area which has been at war for much of 
the century. Regional institutions including the Mekong River Commission (Cambodia, Viet 
Nam, Laos and Thailand) are working to turn the Mekong into a “channel of commerce and 
prosperity— Asia’s Danube” , by exploiting possibilities for mutual benefit and opening up a vast 
new market in this region where cross-border links are often rudimentary. Finance is proving to 
be a major challenge, however. Some dam schemes to generate hydropower alarm 
environmentalistswho warn of problems ranging from the intrusion of salt water into the delta 
to loss of rare species. China is building a dam in Yunnan from which electricity may be sent across 
Laos to Thailand. It claims that the project will help river flow and benefit downstream nations, 
but there are anxieties among low-lying countries because of the upstream dam’s capacity to

The river: The Danube is Europe’s second largest river, 
with a watershed area of 817,000 km® in seventeen 
countries. The main channel of the river flows through 
Germany, Austria,Slovakia, Croatia,Hungary, Yugoslavia, 
Bulgaria,Romania. 
Problems and prospects: Pollution by nitrogen and 
phosphorus from agriculture, and toxic substances from 
industries and cities Hungary and Slovakia are still divided 
by a long-running dispute over the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros 
dam project that was referred to the International Court of 
Justice in The Hague. In 1997 the court ruled that both 
countries were at fault— Hungary when it cancelled work 
on the project in 1989 and withdrew unilaterally from a 
1977 bilateral agreement, Slovakia by diverting the Danube 
onto its territory without attempting to work out the

right way between the villages even though no one 
can say precisely when this notion took hold. At that 
point, people consider those who take a different 
path as trespassers. And so we find a legal norm and 
not merely a factual description of a path. 
Today there is a well developed body of 
customary international law that governs the rights 
of nations in internationally shared sources of fresh 
water. That body of law develops through a process 
of claim and counterclaim, with the nations making 
the claims appealing to legal rules to establish their 
rights. All nations agree that only riparian nations— 
nations across which, or along which, a river flows— 
have any legal right,apart from an agreement, to use 
the water of a river. Beyond that however, there are 
two types of international claim. T he upper-riparian 
nations initially base their claims on absolute 
territorial sovereignty, typically claiming the right to 
do whatever they choose with the water regardless 
of its effect on other riparian nations. Downstream 
nations, on the other hand, generally make a claim 
to the absolute integrity of the river, insisting that 
upper-riparian nations can do nothing that affects 
the quantity or quality of water flowing. 
Equitable utilization 
The usual solution to these contradictory claims 
is found in a concept known as equitable utilization: 
each riparian nation recognizes the right of the 
others to use water from a common source.At the 
same time, there is an obligation to ensure that the 
way in which one riparian nation uses water does not 
unreasonably interfere with similar uses of other 
nations further downstream.Under this principle, 
countries usually decide on how much water is 
allocated to one state or another by looking for 
some more or less objective standard such as historic 
patterns of use or the amount of land that could be 
irrigated in each nation. They also take into account 
“objective” factors, like the need for more water for 
growing populations.

disagreement with Hungary. 
Customary law does something that the market 
cannot: it recognizes the unique nature of water. Instead 
of trying to determine who “owns” what proportion of 
a river, it lays down a set of rules for sharing. 
Of course, there are at least two problems with this 
kind of informal law. To begin with, the principle is too 
vague to determine a nation’s “fair” share. Second, 
there is no neutral way of enforcing the rules. So when 
a violation occurs,the only recourse often available is 
the law of the vendetta. 
But these problems are just part of the natural 
course of developing any form of customary law. At 
some point, rules have to be set down on paper and 
codified. Indeed,nations have hammered out hundreds 
of agreements in the attempt to define what constitutes 
fair sharing of a particular waterway. T he international 
community took a major leap forward about a year 
and a half ago by approving the United Nations 
Convention on the Non-Navigational Uses of 
International Watercourses by a vote of 104 to three. It 
will unquestionably be the leading law governing 
internationally shared fresh waters once it is ratified by 
35 nations—a process that could take a decade or 
more. The convention provides a set of standards in 
codifying the rule of equitable utilization based on a long 
list of diverse factors—from geographic and ecological 
considerations to the economic value of existing and 
potential uses of the waterway. The aim is to help 
arbitrators and judges determine “equitable”sharing, 
which should not be confused with equal shares. 
The convention is a legal document, not a magic 
formula. Disputes will continue. But instead of resorting 
to the law of the vendetta, nations can now seek legal 
resolution. The rule of equitable utilization can also serve 
to channel the negotiations between riparian neighbours 
should they prefer to resolve the matter by treaty rather 
than by arbitration or litigation. 
T he convention reflects not only logic, but need and 
power—which amounts to a far more balanced and 
sophisticated approach to managing water than simply 
relying on a free market. u

### 114988: Adoption: for love or money?

Adoption; 
for love or money? 
Racketeers are trying to make a profit out of couples in rich countries who want 
to adopt orphan children from the developing world. Twenty-five nations have 
now agreed to follow a code of conduct governing international adoption 
They're in love. They live comfortably 
somewhere in the “first world”. One 
day, they decide to have children. But the 
months and years go by without any “happy 
event”. In the end, they go to a fertility 
expert. But fertility treatment doesn’t always 
work and eventually becomes very distressing 
for the couple, who feel wounded because 
they can’t fulfil their reproductive instincts. 
As they become more and more deeply 
involved in medical treatment, the idea of 
adopting a child takes root. Why not open 
their lives to an unloved baby or youngster 
who has been abandoned and dumped in an 
orphanage? After all,the couple has lots of 
love to give and the means to bring up a 
family. 
Since contraception became common 
and abortion tolerated in the world’s rich 
countries, abandoned children, young or 
older,have become few and far between.At 
the same time, many more people, both 
couples and single persons, are seeking to 
adopt. As a result, adoption of children 
from poor countries by couples from the 
North has soared over the past 20 years 
(see box). 
Long and tricky 
negotiations 
With few exceptions, the process of 
adopting a foreign baby is a long and 
complex one, involving talks with social 
workers,doctors and psychiatrists. A lot of 
paperwork has to be done before consent is 
given. In most cases, the process is just as 
complicated in the child’s country of origin, 
and the rules vary widely from country to 
country. “It’s like an obstacle race,” say 
parents who have been through it. 
Yet scandals regularly come to light, 
mainly because dubious go-betweens in 
some poor countries take advantage of the 
rising demand for adopted children to relieve 
wealthy couples, tired of waiting for offspring 
of their own, of huge sums, sometimes as 
much as $60,000. Worst of all, these 
racketeers manage to trick needy mothers

kind of pressures and 
manoeuvres that are typical

into parting with their biological children. 
The case of young Pablo in Guatemala 
helped to raise international concern. He 
spent the first year of his life in an orphanage 
while his fate provoked a legal battle. His 
natural mother, 30-year-old Elvira Ramirez 
Caio, had given her written consent for 
his adoption by a Spanish couple. But she 
claimed she had signed some kind of 
document in a moment of distress even 
before the child was born, because her 
husband had left her when he found out she 
was pregnant. 
The Spanish couple’s lawyer paid her 
money. But Guatemalan law allows a mother 
to renege on such an agreement, and with the 
backing of a charitable association, Caza 
Alianza,Elvira managed to get baby Pablo

In the United States, 13,621 foreign 
A) children were adopted by American 
parents in 1997, twice as many as 20 years 
earlier, according to official figures. The 
children were mostly born in Russia (3,816), 
China (3,597), South Korea (1,654), 
Guatemala (788) and Romania (621). 
France comes second after the United 
States among the so-called host countries. 
A total of 3,528 children from 70 countries 
were adopted by French parents in 1997, 
compared with 971 from 10 countries in 
1979.Nearly half the children adopted by 
French parents come from Viet Nam, 
followed by Colombia, Madagascar,Russia, 
Brazil, Guatemala,Romania,Bulgaria and 
Ethiopia. 
The geography of international adoption 
varies considerably, sometimes from one 
year to the next. South Korea, for example 
(which provided 66 per cent of foreign 
adoptions in France in 1979), sharply 
restricted foreign adoptions after the Seoul 
Olympic Games in 1988. As in India and 
China,prospective parents now have to go 
through a recognized organization. 
In China, where intercountry adoption 
only began in 1991, the rules were eased last 
year relief to orphanages 
overcrowded with little girls—the Chinese 
to give 
are only allowed to have one child if they live 
in a city and two if they live in the 
countryside. In Romania, a large number of 
orphans were adopted after the fall of 
Ceausescu in 1989, but very strict rules 
have now been introduced. In most Muslim 
states, adoption is impossible, either for 
local citizens or foreigners. u

back in August 1998, not long after his first 
birthday. This was the first time a 
Guatemalan court had ever returned a child 
to its natural mother after a dubious 
adoption. 
“The Pablo affair shows the kind of 
pressures and manoeuvres that are typical 
of lawyers and people paid to find babies for 
adoption. They always go for mothers who 
are poor and illiterate,” say officials of Caza 
Alianza, whose lawyers are handling the 
cases of 17 other such mothers. The 
association reckons that about 440 children 
have been fraudulently adopted in 
Guatemala since 1996, a year which saw the 
end of a 36-year civil war in which more 
than 100,000 people died.

Lawyers seem to be in

court judge who decides whether or not 
the adoption can go ahead. In the case of 
orphans and abandoned children, the judge 
has to certify first that their parents have 
vanished or are unknown. In each case, a 
lawyer is necessary. 
So Guatemala has become a favourite 
destination of Western couples looking 
for a foreign child to adopt. The number 
of requests received rose from 900 in 
1996 to 2,304 in 1997, most of them from 
Americans, French and Canadians. Officials 
in all three countries have stepped up their 
warnings about the risks of adopting 
Guatemalan children.

carried out by accredited doctors on the 
mothers of all adopted babies from 
Guatemala before the children are allowed 
into the country. The United States 
announced in October 1998 that it would 
do the same. The Guatemalan authorities 
have called on local judges to be more 
vigilant until stricter legislation is passed by 
parliament. 
In Brazil, where rules for foreigners 
adopting children are very strict on paper, 
94 women demonstrate regularly in the 
town of Jundiai, near Sao Paulo. Apart from 
the fact that they are all poor,they have all 
had their children taken away from them by 
a judge who sent them to a centre which 
works hand in glove with an Italian adoption 
organization. An enquiry is going on. In 
Viet Nam, taxi-drivers, hotel managers and 
travel agents openly offer, illegally and for 
money, “guidance” for Western parents 
ETHICS 
required to check whether the prospective 
parents are “eligible and suited to adopt” 
according to the laws and procedures of 
both countries involved. 
The convention also forbids any 
“contact between the prospective adoptive 
parents and the child’s parents” until all 
the requirements have been met. The 
authorities of the child’s country of origin 
must ensure that the consent of the 
biological mother (and father if he is 
identified) has been “freely given” and has 
“not been induced by payment or 
compensation of any kind” 
The convention also stipulates—Ilike 
the 1989 United Nations Convention on the 
Rights of the Child—that foreigners can 
only adopt a child if foster parents have 
not been found in its own country and if 
it 1s “in the best interests of the child”, 
whose origins must be respected as far as 
‘Many mothers come to us because they want 
to give up a child they can no longer afford to bring up. 
We do all we can to dissuade them and help them. 
But here, as everywhere else, the first thing to do 
is to stem the tide of poverty’ 
seeking to adopt. 
Scandals like these, and others that 
came to light in Eastern Europe, Africa 
and Asia, helped to convince the 
international community of the need for a 
legal instrument to establish principles for 
intercountry adoption. T he Convention on 
the Protection of Children and Co- 
operation in Respect of Intercountry 
Adoption was signed inT he Hague in 1993 
and came into effect two years later. 
Respect 
for the child’s origins 
The Convention bans any “improper 
financial or other gain” and “the abduction, 
the sale of, or traffic in children” and obliges 
each signatory state to establish maximum 
safeguards to prevent it. So far, 21 countries 
have ratified the Convention,’ including 
Colombia, France and Australia in 1998, 
and four others have acceded to it. 
In practice,anyone wanting to adopt a 
child must make a formal application, either 
directly or through an NGO of their choice, 
to the “central authority” of their own 
country, which will send the request to the 
central authority of the country in which the 
applicants wish to adopt a child. This 
measure has already reduced the number of 
clandestine adoptions between contracting 
countries. Before the request is sent to the 
foreign country, the adopting country is 
possible. 
In the same spirit, several countries 
require foreign prospective parents, or the 
social services of the adopting country, to 
make regular reports on the child’s progress 
to its country of origin. This “follow-up 
period” is 10 years in the case of Sri Lanka, 
four for Peru, three for Paraguay and two for 
Romania. 
The growth of intercountry adoption 
has often led to more child adoptions within 
the country of origin. In Peru, the 
authorities have mounted local media 
campaigns to ensure that abandoned 
children are “offered” for adoption to 
Peruvian couples as a first choice. “Many 
mothers come to us because they want to 
give up a child they can no longer afford to 
bring up,” says a Peruvian adoption official 
who asked not to be named.“We do all we 
can to dissuade them and help them. But 
here, as everywhere else, the first thing to do 
1s to stem the tide of poverty.” nu

where children are sought for adoption (Burkina 
Faso, Cyprus, Colombia,Costa Rica, Ecuador, 
Lithuania, Mexico, Moldova, Paraguay, Peru, the

### 114989: Children's books come of age

Children’s books 
Children are being told the facts of life 
by a new wave of authors, but there’s still plenty of room 
for Prince Charming, fairies and witches. 
For years children’s literature was 
the Cinderella of literature, 
languishing in the shadow of a 
cantankerous stepmother. Today the 
maiden is ready to go to the ball. 
Didacticism and and moralizing are 
fading away into the past and writing for 
children is becoming an art-form in its 
own right, a genre whose borders now 
stretch far beyond the classroom, the 
library or the nursery. Book production 
for young people has also become an 
industry which is attracting more and 
more attention in the shape of 
conferences, prizes, book fairs and 
university theses all over the world. 
“A children’s book isn’t a schoolbook 
any longer,” says Leena Maissen, head of the 
Swiss-based International Board on Books 
for Young People (IBBY), whose offices 
in 60 countries are trying to make more 
literature and art available to the world’s 
children. 
“Books for children are certainly 
valuable teaching aids, and they're especially 
useful for giving children a taste for reading. 
But new trends are coming in. Taboos are 
being broken, children are being taken 
seriously and being treated like real people, 
and long-avoided subjects are being 
tackled.” 
Fairy stories still have a place, of course. 
Children still dream about witches, bears, 
princesses and elves, but in a different way.

that in children’s books these days, “the

world isn’t always seen through rose- 
coloured spectacles. For many people, 
talking to children meant using diminutives, 
talking about little houses and little girls,and 
avoiding subjects like disease, violence and 
death.” 
Manuel Pena Muiioz, a Chilean author 
of children’s books, agrees. “Some teachers 
think they’ve covered children’s literature 
once they've told the story of Snow White 
and the Seven Dwarfs,” she says. “What’s 
more, some authors simply tell stories about 
princesses and gnomes,add a bit of moral 
icing to the cake, and that’s it. But that’s not 
enough,these days.” 
The illustrator’s 
magic wand 
A number of recent books have 
reworked subjects, forms and narrative 
techniques. Today’s children read stories 
about divorce, death, drugs, air pollution, 
political extremism, violence and racism. 
And all kinds of books are being published 
which rely on the magic wand of the 
illustrator or cartoonist. 
Before they know how to read, babies 
can play with books made of fabric or books 
made to take in the bath.L ater on, they are 
given picture books that may be cubical or 
triangular, outsized or miniature, possibly 
bilingual. They also like work-books which 
come with watercolours and paintbrushes, 
and comic books crammed with detail 
where they have to spot a figure hidden 
among thousands of others. 
Not that the traditional children’s book 
is being sidelined. T here are still storybooks 
where the pages pop up when they are 
opened, to make a forest or a castle. Among 
the latest ideas are interactive 
stories where readers choose the plot or 
ending they want, and books on CD-Rom, 
which are very popular in rich industrialized 
countries. 
The public has enthusiastically greeted 
the wealth of ingenuity displayed by 
publishers. “Previously, giving a child a 
book was almost seen as an insult,” says

MARAMAACME SIRENT « ZAANL LAR . 
Canadian author Marie-France Hébert. 
Her books, published by the French- 
language Quebec publisher La Courte 
Echelle, sell like hot cakes, in hundreds of 
thousands of copies. “There’s a real appetite 
for reading these days and I try to get across 
to children the passion for reading which is 
food for the mind and the heart, like a 
medicine or a vitamin.” 
Updating 
traditional tales 
Robert hates maths—he can’t make 
head or tail of it. But one night he dreams 
of meeting a sharp-tongued little goblin 
who promises to teach him all about it.Of 
course, he thinks it’s just another bad 
dream. But actually he’s being taken on 
an exciting journey into the world of 
maths by The Number Devil, a book 
published in 1997 by the German poet 
and essayist Hans Magnus Enzensberger, 
one of a growing band of authors who are 
writing these days for children as well as 
adults. 
Morocco’s Tahar Ben Jelloun (Racism 
Explained toMy Daughter), Spanish writers 
Fernando Savater (A Father A ddresses his 
Son on Questions of Ethics) and Carmen 
Martin Gaite (“Little Red Riding Hood in 
Manhattan”), Chilean Luis Sepulveda 
(“The Story of the Seagull and the Cat 
who Taught him to Fly”) and Austria’s 
Patrick Suskind have all updated traditional 
stories or tackled topics like racism and 
ecology. 
The Cuban writer Joel Franz Rosell 
says this renewal of children’s literature is 
partly because school programmes have 
been revamped to include modern works. 
“Publishers see an enormous market here 
and are very keen to profit from it,” he 
says. “The thing about the market for 
children’s books is that children don’t buy 
the books themselves, someone else does— 
parents, teachers or librarians. T he child 
doesn’t know or care whether there’s an 
author. Some researchers have even 
described children’s literature as texts 
without authors. But parents are amazed by 
the fact that their children can read authors 
that they like too.” 
Some authors say they don’t switch 
styles when they write for children. Others, 
such as Jasmine Dubé, from Quebec, say 
at the same speed everywhere in the world. 
“In some places, like India, books are still 
written for children in a very traditional 
way and change is very slow in coming,” 
says Maissen. Yet from India sprang the 
first-ever children’s book more than 2,000 
years ago—a collection of tales called the 
Panchatranta. The country, which has 18 
official languages and more than 1,600 
dialects, publishes books for children which 
mostly draw on tales, legends and heroic 
past eras. 
The most daring publishers and authors 
are in Western Europe. In Eastern Europe, 
‘Some teachers think they’ve covered children’s literature 
once they've told the story of Snow White and the Seven 
Dwarfs. What’s more, some authors simply tell stories 
about princesses and gnomes, add a bit of moral icing to 
the cake, and that’s it. But that’s not enough, these days. 
they write in a totally different way. “When 
I write for adults,” she says,“I feel like I've 
got less spirit, that it’s more cerebral, that 
I’m censoring myself more. I don’t give 
such a free rein to my imagination and I’m 
less direct. I think other writers do it much 
better than me. But when I write for 
children, all my passion and urgency 
return.”

the new market economy leaves little room 
for quality books. “The Czechs, Slovaks 
and Russians used to be top of the league for 
children’s books,” says Maissen.“But the 
economic crisis has pushed their highly 
creative people into illustrating books 
published in the West.” 
Between books 
and television 
Books for children and teenagers have 
a healthy share of the market. Figures 
available at the 1998 Frankfurt Book Fair 
showed that 7.5 per cent of the 78,000 
books published in Germany in 1997 were 
for children, a percentage which has 
remained steady over the past few years. In 
France, children’s books have held up 
better than other titles in the publishing 
crisis which began in the early 1990s, and 
in 1997 represented 8.3 per cent of all 
sales. In Brazil, 31 per cent of books 
published in 1997 (including some 
schoolbooks) were written for children. 
But such figures should not hide the 
fact that reading is competing with 
television, films and electronic media, whose 
audience is growing faster than book 
readership. A UNEsco-sponsored survey 
carried out in 1995 by Utrecht University, 
in The Netherlands, showed that in regions 
where there was electricity, 93 per cent of

them chose TV. 
Building a youthful 
following 
Publishers have risen to the challenge by 
bringing out written adaptations of the 
latest Disney film and telling the story of the 
sinking of the Titanic from all kinds of 
angles. Of course such products don’t have 
a very long shelf-life, lasting only as long as 
it takes for the big transnational film 
companies to come up with another money- 
spinner. To survive such fads, publishers 
have to build up a loyal following among the 
reading public. “It’s important to publish for 
SIGNS OF THE TIMES 
different age groups, to respond to feedback 
from readers and keep them when they 
become adults,” says Norma Sturniolo, 
editor of the Espacio Abierto series at the 
Spanish publisher Anaya. 
The major children’s classics, which are 
always being republished, seem to last 
forever. At the latest publishers’ ball, 
Cinderella continues to whirl around with 
Jules Verne, Lewis Carroll, Mark Twain and 
Saint-Exupéry. Will she one day lose her 
glass slipper? Will she continue to enchant 
her readers whatever their age?

her colleagues think in private,that “one of

books as well” nu

Fairs and prizes galore 
Just like books for adults, children’s books 
il have their own prizes, fairs and critics. The 
most important specialized body in this field 
is the International Board on Books for Young 
People (IBBY), which was founded in 1953. 
It promotes children’s books, publishes a 
quarterly review Bookbird, draws up a biennial 
List of Honour of the world’s best children’s 
books, and every two years awards Hans 
Christian Andersen Prizes to an author and 
an illustrator. T he prizes, which carry so much 
prestige in the world of children’s literature 
that they have been called “little Nobel 
Prizes”, have been won by such authors as 
Astrid Lindgren (Sweden, 1958) and Gianni 
Rodari (Italy, 1996). The 1998 winners were 
American writer Katherine Paterson and 
French illustrator Tomi Ungerer. 
Authors and publishers of children’s 
books also get together at major 
international gatherings. The Bologna (Italy) 
International Fair is to children’s literature 
what the Frankfurt Book Fair (held annually 
in October) is to books for adults. This 
year’s Bologna Fair,to be held from 1 to 8 
April, is expected to attract 1,400 exhibitors 
from 80 countries and some 20,000 visitors. 
In addition to the Bologna Fair, there are 
specialized fairs at Montreuil, on the 
outskirts of Paris, and at Mexico City and 
Nairobi.

Rock art: 
a call 
for co-operation 
| n co-operation with UNESCO's International 
Council for Philosophy and Humanistic 
Studies, the Camuno centre of historical studies 
at Valcamonica (Italy) has launched a three- 
year project to list the world’s most important 
sites of rock art. 
The World Archives of Rock Art (WARA) 
project,which has a $60,000 budget,involves 
updating and monitoring data from some 70 
countries. A CD-Rom and a world atlas 
containing a selection of 150 sites are also 
planned. 
Chosen for their aesthetic value and historical 
or ethnological interest, the sites are spread out 
over eight geographical areas: Asia, the Near 
East, northern Africa, southern Africa, Europe, 
North America,Central and South America,and 
Oceania. Each site will be presented by a 
description (including location, type, features, 
date, state of preservation and the state of 
research), photographs, drawings and a 
bibliography. 
WARA follows up on an earlier world report 
on rock art, the first of its kind, which was 
submitted to Unesco in 1982. The project is 
open to specialists and institutions from any 
country wishing to participate. 
The Valacamonica centre is also offering 
three-month internships on prehistoric and 
tribal art at which students and scholars can 
acquire hands-on experience in research, the 
management of cultural property, public 
relations, the organization of exhibitions and 
symposia, translation and publishing. u

### 114990: The Press takes to the street

The press takes 
{0 the street 
  
There are discordant voices in the new international movement to produce 
street newspapers in aid of the homeless 
“It was either that or I was finished,” 
says Chantal. “That” means selling street 
newspapers. Chantalis41 and has “a lot 
to get off her chest”. Her story is that of a strict 
French upbringing, dropping out of school 
and plans thwarted by her parents. “I was 
crazy about wild animals and horses,” she 
says. “I always wanted to train animals. And 
now look at me. ...” 
Chantal had a breakdown in 1996 after 
failing an exam to become a nursing assistant. 
“I wanted to kill myself,” she says. “But one 
day I met an old friend and poured my heart 
out to her. She brought me to my senses and 
advised me to sell street newspapers.” 
Since then, Chantal has been selling 
L’ltinérant to travellers on the Paris 
underground. She buys her copies for the 
equivalent of 50 US cents each and re-sells 
them for three times that, making between 
$350 and $700 a month. This supplements 
the minimum assistance benefit of about 
$430 that she gets from the state. 
In Stockholm, a 120-strong sales 
force 
Thousands of marginalized people like 
Chantal live from selling street newspapers in 
the big cities of rich countries. But unlike 
Chantal, who rents a small room, most of 
them are homeless. 
There are about three million homeless 
people in the countries of the European 
Union, and three million more in the United 
States. Many drink or take drugs. In 
Stockholm, 40 per cent of them are afflicted 
with paranoia, schizophrenia, or phobias, says 
Malin Speace, who runs Sweden’s only street 
paper, the monthly Situation Sthim, which 
started publication in 1995. The paper prints 
15,000 copies and employs 120 of the city’s 
5,000 or so homeless. 
“Selling the paper keeps them occupied 
during the day,” says Speace. “We actually 
steal their time, to keep their minds off drugs.” 
The paper is also a halfway house between 
   
“exclusion” and belonging to society. Two 
experts help the vendors through the maze of 
social services, which include projects run 
by non-governmental organizations, state aid 
and detox programmes. 
The social usefulness of Situation Sthim 
seems undeniable. At the very least, it helps the 
homeless and the unemployed to be less cut 
off. At best, it helps them to find somewhere 
to live, some training or a job. 
For the past decade, street newspapers 
and magazines have gone from strength to 
strength. T he first one, Street News, surfaced 
in New York in 1989, recalls Tim Harris, 
president of the National Association of North 
American Street Newspapers. The paper, 
which depended heavily on corporate 
donations, was founded by rock musician 
Hutchinson Persons, and had “somewhat 
right-wing libertarian politics,” says Harris. 
The movement then spread across North 
America and to Europe, and is now growing 
everywhere except in France, where street 
papers have faded after getting off to a brisk 
startin 1993. 
Elsewhere, there are over 150 in a score of 
countries, mostly focusing on social issues 
and funded by a mix of private donations, 
advertising revenue, income from sales and 
public subsidies. Canada has a dozen and 
the United States more than 40.T he biggest 
ones in the US—StreetWise (Chicago), Spare 
Change (Boston) and Real Change (Seattle)— 
sell between 20,000 and 120,000 copies a 
month. But most are run on a shoestring, 
print about 20,000 copies each and barely 
manage to break even. 
Tessa Swithinbank, international editor 
of the British street paper The Big Issue, 
counted 70 titles in Europe in 1997, half of 
them in Germany. As in North America, 
they vary from papers which print 3,000 
copies a month to the nearly 300,000 sold 
each week by The Big Issue, which isnow the 
third favourite paper of young Britons 
between the age of 15 and 24. It was founded 
in London in 1991 by a working-class 
Irishman and former Trotskyite, John Bird, 
with $50,000 from the natural cosmetic 
chain The Body Shop. Today, with an annual # 
Clive Harold,a boyhood friend of Prince Charles, sells The Big Issue in the streets of London.

turnover of more than $20 million, it has 
four regional editions in Britain and three 
abroad—in Australia, South Africa and the 
United States. 
Speace says street papers are even 
starting to spread to countries of the South. 
NOS was launched in Brasilia at the end of 
last year. Homeless young people in Gambia 
sell tourists a paper called Concern. Plans for 
street newspapers are afoot in India and 
Japan. Worldwide, “about 30 million copies 
of street newspapers are probably sold every 
year and the number is growing all the time,” 
says Mel Young, who runs the Scottish edition 
of The Big Issue. But, he says, “there is some 
disagreement within the movement.” 
Ethically correct 
The main point of discord is over the 
purpose of street newspapers. Should they be 
the mouthpiece of militant community 
organizations or should they be profitable 
social enterprises? The Big Issue has chosen the 
second option. Bird thinks it is possible to be 
both profitable and “ethically correct”. Indeed, 
putting out a quality publication, produced 
entirely by professionals, is essential for social 
effectiveness, he says. The paper highlights the 
two or three thousand homeless people who 
live by selling it and points up the services it 
offers, such as help with finding somewhere 
to live and getting training. 
CONNEXIONS 
The Big Issue was created to be “a 
prosperous publication with considerable 
resources that would offer substantial resources 
to the less fortunate,” says the Montreal street 
paper L'ltinéraire. Many N orth American street 
papers are much more critical. Most of them 
are run and edited by the homeless themselves 
and fight for the existence of this kind of media 
voice in a country where it is rare. 
They criticize the eye-catching 
presentation, the management style and the 
“commercial” content of the British paper and 
accuse it of trying to set itself up as the norm. 
The arrival of The Big Issuein Los Angeles last 
April has fuelled the debate, especially as it 
threatens to kill off the street paper Making 
Change, based in nearby Santa Monica. 
“We're very vulnerable,” says Jennifer 
Waggonner, who runs M aking Change. “We 
only have 20 vendors and our receipts barely 
cover printing costs.” But Waggonner, herself 
a homeless person, has a business sense to 
match the competition and is negotiating 
with the rival paper for technical help and for 
exclusive rights to sell the two papers in the 
western Los Angeles area. 
Harris is careful not to take sides in this 
turf war and in ideological disputes. “It all 
depends on your priorities,” he says. “If theyre 
political, you include the poor in the process 
of producing the paper and give them a voice. 
If you think money’s more important, you 
turn out a commercial product and reinvest 
the profits to help the homeless.” 
Watchdogs for the homeless 
Like Harris,many of those who run street 
newspapers have chosen a middle way. In St. 
Petersburg, for example, the fortnightly Na 
Dnye (in Russian, The Lower Depths, from 
the title of Maxim Gorky’s play) tries to 
combine professionalism and political 
struggle.“To attract young readers and boost 
sales, which fell after the rouble was devalued, 
we carry news about trendy clubs, music and 
art,” says its founder, Valery Sokolov. 
The paper has a page for articles written 
by homeless people, and two-thirds of its 
space is taken up with social issues. “Last 
November, we exposed the fact that the police 
were expelling homeless people from the 
city,” he says. “Every Tuesday and Thursday, 
they took groups of 20 or 30 about 40 km out 
of town and dumped them in the forest where 
the temperature was minus 18°C. We have 
asked for an inquiry into this.” Between 2,000 
and 4,000 of St. Petersburg’s 50,000 homeless 
people die every year. 
“With such dreadful things going on, 
our differences seem trivial,” says Young. 
“We have to act in concert to attack abuses 
and set up a worldwide watchdog to defend 
the rights of the homeless.” u

### 114991: Montreal's netizen news-vendors

Montreal’s netizen news-vendors 
T: Quebec newspaper L Itinéraire offers homeless 
people an e-mail address in a former hairdressing 
salon which has been turned into a cybercafé. It's an 
annexe of the Café sur la Rue (The Café on the Street), 
which has been open forthe homeless and other needy 
people for more than a year. The vendors of the monthly 
L'ltinéraire— Canada’sfirst newspaper for street people, 
which was launched in 1994 and focuses on social 
issues— go there for a cheap bow! of soup and to pick 
up their copies. The “ camelots,” as they are called, buy 
them for 65 cents each and sell them to the public for 
double that. 
The Café sur la Rue opened its Internet annexe last 
October— a kind of high-tech office with a dozen 
computers. A few homeless people are quietly busy 
there but most of the customers are people from the 
neighbourhood or hard-up students One is typing out 
his CV, others are playing games replying to e-mail, 
taking part in an online discussion or looking for a job 
on the Web. 
The place is nicely decorated. On its sandy-coloured 
walls are literary quotes such as“ Greed starts where 
poverty ends’ by the French writer Honoré de Balzac, and 
coloured drawingsincluding a long blue wave breaking 
at eye-level. 
“That's so you can surf the Net better,” jokes SEbastien 
4 4 The Unesco Courier - February 1999 
Langlais, who runs the project, which was set up entirely 
with donations— of time by decorators from Radio 
Canada, of computers by hardware firms and of free 
services such as an Internet link and setting up a website 
(http://itineraire.educ.infinit.net) by the cable distributor 
Videotron. 
Fifty-four-year-old Lise has been on welfare for 
the past 25 years. “ It does me good to come here” 
she says. “ The day goes by more quickly.” The 
computers scared her at first, but now she loves 
them.So much so that she comes every day to clean 
the place up and greet new customers. When her 
“volunteer job” allows her the time, she sends an e- 
mail to a friend or reconstructs the “ puzzle” she has 
created in the computer around a photo of her 
daughter and granddaughter. 
An Internet course for beginners 
“The hardest people to attract in here are the 
homeless” says Langlais New technology frightens 
them, even when free training is offered to the least 
educated among them. “ Street people are not necessarily 
uneducated and uncultured,” he says. “Despite their 
personal problems, they're interested in lots of things They 
want to know what’s going on, in politics or sport, for 
example” 
At the Bonneau Reception Center, which serves hot 
meals, “ they gave an Internet course for beginners” he 
says. “ Since then, a Romanian guy has stopped by 
regularly to get news about his country from the Net. 
Another homeless person, who wasn’t interested in 
anything, developed a passion for online newspapers” 
The cybercafé’s goal is the same as that of the 
newspaper, which gets some financial help from the 
government. It aims to demarginalize the poorest 
people, make them feel wanted, give them some 
training and some experience of voluntary or paid 
workin the hope it will lead them back into society. 
Some American psychologists say access to new 
technology can be a kind of do-it-yourself therapy for 
people who are depressed and can help them to 
regain their self-confidence. The cybercafé also helps 
to build in street people and the unemployed a “ sense 
of belonging” to the “big family” of Lltinéraire, says 
the paper's editor Alain Demers. 
But the river that divides this sheltered environment 
from the job market is still hard to cross. Only rarely 
does anyone really manage to cross the divide. H

### 114992: Munich's street magazine

 
Munich’s st 
Germany’s leading street 
monthly has become an 
established institution 
Heinz Bonni (above) is a bit of a 
loudmouth. “I don’t suffer fools gladly,” 
he declares, “and I always say what I think.” 
Sometimes he goes even further and uses his 
fists. A few months ago, he was up in court 
for assault. He got a two-year suspended 
prison sentence and a $240 fine. That’s 
when he realized he could “count on Biss"— 
the paper paid his fine. 
Biss is short for “Burger in sozialen 
Schwierigkeiten” (“Citizens in Difficulty”). It’s 
also the name of Munich’s monthly street 
magazine. T he first publication of its kind in 
Germany, Biss was launched in 1993 by a 
group of radical journalists and militant 
evangelicals. Today, 460 homeless or once- 
homeless people have permits to sell the 
paper, which covers the social crisis and the 
problems of marginalized people. They can 
sell up to 600 papers a month without losing 
their social security payments. 
Bonni, aged 60, is one of 110 vendors 
considered “regulars”. After a string of 
mishaps and occupational difficulties, he 
lost his apartment, his job and finally his 
emotional stability. He is not your ideal 
homeless person, carefully saving money 
so as to get back into society. He smells of 
drink as he complains about the other 
vendors. But he’s proud to be working for 
an “established” magazine, as he calls it. 
“Everyone’s heard of Biss,” he says. 
It wasn’t easy for Biss to get this far. At 
first, the team of volunteers was overwhelmed. 
CONNEXIONS 
reet 
magazine 
Some people had their hand in the till, 
which was pretty empty anyway. The 
magazine was sinking when 50-year-old 
Hildegard Denninger, an accountant by 
training, took over in May 1994, 
reorganizing it and making better use of 
the sales revenue. Now Biss prints 40,000 
copies of each issue, has about $150,000 in 
the kitty and gets subsidies from the city 
council and donations from elsewhere. 
Things are going well—a bit too well, 
according to some people, who think social 
action should not get mixed up with 
commerce. The magazine, which is put 
together by professional journalists, is also 
criticized for not giving enough space to what 
homeless people themselves think. If they 
want to express their views, the homeless can 
join a weekly “writing workshop” and publish 
articles in a special section of the magazine. 
“It would be naive to think that our 
vendors can turn out well-written and 
researched articles when most of the 
‘normal’population can’t,” says Denninger, 
who thinks there’s no alternative to bringing 
out a quality product. 
Loyal readers 
“I get blamed for being only interested in 
money,” she says. But how to survive without 
it?T he homeless earn the equivalent of 80 US 
cents for each copy they sell and Biss helps 
them, among other things, to pay off any 
debts they have. It also gives them a bonus 
when they manage to get an apartment and 
supports them when they tangle with the law. 
The magazine has also been able to formally 
hire its six best vendors—those who sell more 
than 1,200 copies a month. 
Some readers and even some vendors 
complain that the magazine devotes too 
much space to foreigners in difficulty when 
there are so many “real” German homeless. 
But the readership is pretty loyal. The 
magazine became well known partly thanks 
to a big publicity campaign in 1996 donated 
by a leading Munich advertising agency. It 
involved showing top footballer Jiirgen 
Klinsmann and the city’s mayor,Christian 
Ude, both disguised as homeless vendors. 
Everyone seems to get something out oft. 
But, as Denninger admits, the magazine only 
enables a tiny minority of the homeless to find 
a job and really get a foothold in society. ™

S* we soon be able to go to cinemas where 
reels of film won't be needed? Computer 
technology is advancing so rapidly that the day 
when films can be projected by satellite to the 
remotest corner of the planet is fast approaching. 
This prospect is creating a panic in the 
laboratories which turn out copies of films, and 
most of all among the big international 
distributing companies. But it delights film fans 
in isolated areas and in small towns where the 
local cinema has closed down. 
The idea is simple. Th  film is scanned, and then 
compressed and encrypted with its sound track 
before being transmitted by satellite or digital 
phone line. At the other end, a “ satellite modem”, 
a decoder and a special projector are needed and 
the film can be shown anywhere— in a barn, say, 
or a village square. No more lugging around reels 
or damaging film in transit. 
The new technique was first publicly tested in 
1996 by a Hollywood firm before it was really 
ready. Since then, there have been many try-outs. 
The most successful results seem to have been 
obtained at the Babelsberg studios in Germany, 
supervised by the famous film-maker Volker 
Schldndorff. The European Union is supporting his 
project, CyberCinema, in a bid to recapture a 
public which has lost interest in films with the 
closure of local cinemas and to counter American 
domination of international film distribution. 
At the end of last year, CyberCinema stepped 
up its demonstrations of the new technique by 
showing films for children in Dublin, Warsaw, San 
Remo, Liverpool,Hanover and Ivalo (in Lapland). 
The promoters reckon they need 500 projection 
sites in order to make a profit.By the year 2000, 
they hope to have 200. 
Two problems will have to be sorted out before 
then. The quality of the digital image is not yet 
quite as good as that of a standard 35 mm film, 
and a digital projector alone costs $200,000.50 
maybe the good old reel of film still has a few 
years of life in it yet. [|

TALKING TO... 


### 114993: James Tobin: reining in the markets

James Tobin: 
reining 
in the markets 
In an age of globalized markets and deregulation an 
American Nobel prize-winning economist champions a 
tax on short-term financial transactions to head off 
international crises and help poor countries 
You once said that the study of economics 
offers hope, and that improved 
understanding of our economies can better 
the lot of humanity. Do you feel economists 
have been able to improve the situation of 
all humanity, or have they helped some 
people more than others? 
I think some economists have helped some 
persons more than others. That’s quite 
likely. But yes, I think on the whole 
economists have improved the lot of 
humanity, though we haven’t done it as 
well as I might have hoped. 
I began studying economics during the 
Great Depression.T here was 25 per cent 
unemployment in the United States, in 
France probably 15 to 20 per cent, and 
complete disorder. The international 
political scene was certainly affected by the 
failure of the world economy. The rise of 
Hitler was directly related to the Great 
Depression in Germany. 
Anybody who went to college who had 
his eyes open and read the newspapers in 
the 1930s had the right to be concerned 
about the economic situation, and the right 
to believe that failure of the world economy 
had alot to do with the many threats to the 
peace of the world, to fascism, nazism and 
communism. To the extent that we learned 
in the Great Depression how to keep from 
having great depressions anymore we have 
reduced the likelihood that things like that 
4 6 The Unesco Courier - February 1999 
would happen again. We figured out why 
there was a depression,and we figured out 
what kind of monetary and fiscal policies we 
could use as a remedy. 
It seems that economists have generally 
concentrated on the production of wealth, 
and less on its distribution. 
According to international organizations 
like the United Nations Development 
Programme (UNDP), inequality is increasing 
within countries and between countries. 
That’s why one might argue that 
economists have concentrated on the 
production of wealth, and less on 
distribution. 
I don’t think that’s a fair charge against my 
profession. Actually, consider the whole 
welfare state that you have in France and 
throughout Europe—economists have had 
a lot to do with bringing it about and 
organizing it. We didn’t have those things 
when I was younger. Social security didn’t 
begin in the United States until 1936 during 
the depression. We didn’t have publicly 
supported health care until after the war. A 
lot of those things have come with the help 
and the advocacy of economists. 
Why does inequality keep increasing at the 
national and international levels? 
That’s a really complicated question. I don’t 
have any single answer. We ought to be 
spending a lot of our energy, our emotion, 
and our intelligence to find ways of reducing 
inequality both within countries and 
between countries. 
It hasn’t been ignored by economists. 
TheWorld Bank, for example, was founded 
in 1945 for that purpose.The reduction of 
inequality requires that people who have 
earned higher incomes in markets be taxed 
in order to improve the standards of living 
of the people who have been less fortunate, 
who earned less in markets. Among the 
major preoccupations of economic policy, 
social policy and politics is the level of 
taxation and the degree to which 
governments transfer your earnings into 
the hands of people who are less fortunate. 
Taxation and transfer programmes are a 
big political issue. 
You ask: why don’t democracies succeed 
in making more transfers of income and 
wealth from the fortunate people who earn 
a lot to the less fortunate people who earn 
much less? And then the same thing is true 
on a bigger scale between nations,between 
people in one part of the world and people 
in another. I suppose if you really wanted 
to reduce inequality across the whole world 
you would try to get rid of all immigration 
barriers, so that people could move 
wherever they want to, to get jobs and higher 
wages. T hat would certainly be an immense 
political problem.

### 114993: James Tobin: reining in the markets

  
James Tobin 
Since 1971 you have been saying that 
states need to have at least a minimum 
amount of control over their national 
monetary policy. With globalization, have 
states lost control over monetary policy? 
It is true that the globalization of financial 
markets has diminished the control that 
states have over their own monetary policies. 
There always has been a constraint on 
monetary policy ever since we started having 
some liberalization of monetary regulations 
back in the Bretton Woods system beginning 
in 1945. But that has gone on much more 
rapidly in the last few years, and it does 
limit particularly the power of small 
countries like those in East Asia to run their 
own monetary policies. 
Given financial globalization, how can 
states preserve their monetary autonomy? 
Well, they have to have some ways to slow 
down the inflow and outflow of foreign 
currency and to make the convertibility of 
their own currencies into foreign currency 
less damaging to the country as a whole. 
Consider for example what happened in 
East Asian countries, where some of the 
banks—the banks in Korea for example— 
borrowed from New York, Tokyo and 
London banks. They borrowed very short- 
term, one week or two weeks, so that the 
lenders, the big banks in New York or Tokyo 
or London could decide every week or two 
whether to renew the loan. The commercial 
bank in Korea, for example, has to pay back 
the New York bank in dollars. How is it 
going to get the dollars? It is going to take 
some Korean won, the local currency, to the 
Korean central bank and say “you promised

to give us so many dollars per won. Here is 
my won and I want whatever you have 
promised to give for won.” So the hard 
currency reserves of the country in the 
hands of the central bank then evaporate as 
the banks pay back their loans. That’s where 
the reserves go, and if reser ves vanish like 
that then the currency will have to be 
devalued. T hat’s what happened in 1998. 
If, for example, Korea had had a law 
which said banks are not allowed to have 
short-term hard currency debts that are 
uncovered by corresponding short-term 
assets, then the central bank would be 
protecting itself. If they were to have 
interfered, to that degree, with complete 
globalization of the Korean banking system 
and the Korean money market, it would 
have been a very good thing. 
There are a number of ways in which 
those countries can protect themselves. A 
transaction tax is one method. 
That brings us to the so-called Tobin tax. 
Could you briefly explain to us what it is 
and how it would work? 
There are 1.3 trillion dollars a day in foreign 
exchange transactions. Those transactions 
would be taxed, at a very low rate, 
something like one tenth of one per cent per 
dollar per transaction. T he taxes would be 
of the transactions that occur are not related 
directly to desirable movements of 
productive capital from developed to 
underdeveloped countries. 
China doesn’t have full convertibility, 
except of Chinese currency earned by 
foreigners in trade. You cannot convert 
Chinese currency into dollars or francs or 
yen just to move funds around.They have 
strict financial control very much like the 
controls that France had in 1945-46 right 
after the war. In fact, France had exchange 
controls of some kind until the middle of the 
1980s. China receives a lot of direct 
investments from overseas without having 
convertibility of capital funds from one 
currency to another. It’s not essential to 
have that. 
Most of the investment from developed 
into underdeveloped countries wouldn’t 
have been influenced significantly by the 
Tobin tax, by the exchange transaction tax. 
In fact, the advantage of that device is that 
it doesn’t tax long-range investments 
appreciably at all. If you take a 20-year 
round trip by putting equity capital into 
an underdeveloped country, say from 
France into Viet Nam, and you don’t take 
the money out for 20 years, you pay a tenth 
of a percent the first time and a tenth of a 
per cent coming back. That wouldn’t 
We ought to be spending a lot of our energy, 
our emotion, and our intelligence 
to find ways of reducing inequality both within countries 
and between countries 
levied by each country on transactions that 
originate in the country, and collected by the 
usual tax authority of that country. 
If people are involved in making a lot of 
transactions every day, every week, they 
would have to pay the tax alot of times. So 
they are discouraged from doing that just by 
the existence of the tax. 
Would the world look different today if 
your tax had been in place since the 1970s? 
Would Asia have had the tremendous 
growth that we saw, which was partly 
fuelled by investments and capital flows? 
Would we also have had 
an Asian financial crisis, if the tax had been 
in place earlier? 
Of the 1.3 trillion dollars in transactions per 
day, very few have to deal with the movement 
of productive capital from the savings of one 
country into the investment of another 
country. Developed countries nowadays 
move about 200 billion dollars a year into 
investment in developing countries. So most 
influence your calculation about whether 
you want to make the investment.It’s only 
the very short-term movements of 
currencies that would have been 
discouraged. 
So would the so-called Tobin tax have 
actually prevented an Asian crisis? 
Certainly you need other things as well. 
You need reforms in your own banking 
system and stock markets. The other big 
mistake, perhaps a bigger mistake than 
some of the things we have been discussing, 
is the practice of having a fixed exchange 
rate. You wouldn’t have the currency crisis 
if you didn’t have a fixed exchange rate. A 
fixed exchange rate is a promise by the 
central bank of the country to pay a fixed 
amount of dollars, yen, euros or a basket of 
several currencies. If the central bank 
doesn’t have a reserve of hard currency, it 
has to default on this promise. It’s like the 
failure of an ordinary bank. If depositors 
come and ask for cash for their deposits » 
and the bank doesn’t have them, then the

bank has to close and there is a crisis. 
In the light of the Asian crisis, 
many of the countries in Asia feel that 
they have lost their power, that there has 
been a shift in the balance 
of power between the state and the free 
market. Do you think that view has any 
substance? 
I think that they are right about that to a 
considerable degree. T he financial markets 
being completely liberalized and in my view 
prematurely liberalized, leaves governments 
without the control or restrictions which 
they need to limit the speed and volume of 
movements of funds in and out of their 
currencies. 
Do you think we will continue to have big 
financial crises. Are we learning from our 
mistakes? 
Financial crises are not inevitable. I think we 
will probably learn from mistakes and we 
won’t go back—at least in the case of these 
countries—to trying to defend a fixed rate 
of exchange, against dollars or yen, and 
that will certainly make crises less frequent. 
The whole of history is peppered with 
international financial crises. I am not sure 
it’s right that they are more frequent now. 
There are more people in advanced 
countries who have put money into 
countries where crises occurred. In 
particular,countries in Asia had grown very 
rapidly, almost miraculously, for two or

three decades and had promoted themselves 
to higher echelons and higher places in the 
pecking order of countries and economies. 
They have a lot of the trappings of the 
modern European or American economy— 
stock markets, bond markets, money 
markets, all these things—and growing 
levels of wealth and income. They have 
much closer ties to financial enterprises 
overseas in major countries. So there was a 
bigger shock when they couldn’t maintain 
their promises to pay dollars to banks in 
America and Japan. 
Do you think is there any chance of the 
Tobin tax being implemented one day. In 
France there is a movement to promote it. 
Political figures agree with this tax when 
they are in opposition. But when they are in 
power they don’t talk about the Tobin tax. 
[ am not optimistic about that. I don’t think 
the financial community, including 
ministers of finance in major countries and 
the central banks of those countries, have 
any use for those taxes. T hey don’t want it. 
Even if somebody else in the government 
may say good things about it as Francois 
Mitterrand did, it won’t go through the 
Economic liberalism with a human face 
Nobel economics prize-winner James 
al Tobin may be 80 years old but he is still 
hard at work. At Yale University, where he 
taught from 1950 to 1988, this tireless 
researcher and gifted popularizer has an office 
where he gives interviews and writes—so far 
he has published 16 books and more than 400 
articles. 
In the autobiographical note he wrote 
for the Nobel Foundation in 1981, he said 
that he studied economics and made it his 
career because it “was and is intellectually 
fascinating and challenging, particularly to 
someone with taste and talent for theoretical 
reasoning and quantitative analysis.” It also 
offered the hope of bettering the lot of 
humankind. His family background—his 
mother was a social worker and his father an 
independent-minded journalist—also 
helped a lot to shape the direction of 
his life. 
Born in Illinois, he lived through the 
4 8 The Unesco Courier - February 1999 
Great Depression and what he called the 
“miserable failures of capitalist economies” 
which caused worldwide political and social 
disaster. T he depression also “spelled crisis 
for economic orthodoxy”and “triggered a 
fertile period of scientific ferment and 
revolution in economic theory.” It was 
during this time of ferment that Tobin,then 
an undergraduate at Harvard, discovered 
the theories of John Maynard Keynes in 
1936. 
As a supporter of economic liberalism 
with a human face, Tobin has ever since then 
defended the state’s role in the economy and 
fiscal and budgetary adjustments. In the 1950s 
and 1960s, he led the resistance to the crusade 
for monetarism headed by another Nobel 
prize-winner for economics, Milton 
Friedman. Tobin firmly backed the 
Democratic Party and was an adviser to 
President John F. Kennedy in 1961-62. 
Twenty years later, he spoke out once more, 
this time against President Ronald Reagan’s 
policies, which were largely inspired by 
Friedman’s ideas. 
Since the early 1970s, he has warned 
against the development of private 
speculation in money markets, which is 
undermining the independence of national 
monetary policies. To discourage these 
speculators, he proposed in 1972 an 
international tax on spot currency 
transactions. T he Tobin tax, as it was dubbed, 
found enthusiastic supporters on the left, 
especially in Europe. 
Tobin was awarded the Nobel prize in 
1981 for his work on money supply and 
his mathematically formulated theory of 
the allocation by firms and households of 
their portfolios among different assets. 
Tobin’s theories have influenced a whole 
generation of researchers and stimulated 
analysis of the balance of payments and 
economic growth. [|

A controversial 
tax 
I’ order to avoid tumultuous financial and 
economic floods and droughts caused by 
increasingly mighty international capital flows for 
speculative purposes and to protect national 
policies from dictatorship by the market,in 1972 
James Tobin proposed a worldwide foreign 
exchange transactions tax.In brief the idea is to 
levy a 0.1% to 0.5% on money exchanged from 
one currency to another 
Such a tax, the Nobel Prize-winner has insisted, 
would be punitive for short-term financial plays 
and would thus slow down speculative capital 
movements such as those that led to the surge 
and then collapse of Asian financial markets over 
the past decade. On the other hand, the “ Tobin 
tax” ,according to its author, would not be high 
enough to deter commodity trade or long-term 
investments in productive enterprises 
Some analysts however, feel that the Tobin tax 
would be impossible to administer because all 
countries would have to agree to it and such 
worldwide fiscal harmonization would be 
unprecedented. [|

finance ministry. They are not going to go 
for it, the International Monetary Fund 
(IMF) is not going to go for it. 
People do not like to be taxed. They think 
it is an interference with the free market. 
Hasn't there been a little bit of a shift in 
the way people think? 
A little bit of a shift, realization, some 
recognition at the last big meetings of the 
IMF and the World Bank. Some recognition 
that maybe globalization, liberalization 
attempt to regulate capital flows so as to 
help prevent the kind of crisis we have 
seen in Asia? 
I don’t think there is going to be any 
internationally co-ordinated policy. I do think 
that there is going to be more tolerance by the 
IMF and by the governments in North 
America and Europe of developing countries. 
In some of those cases I think there’s probably 
not a big disagreement. For example, the 
banking systems of those countries were not 
ready to be part of international financial

The financial markets being completely liberalized 
and in my view prematurely liberalized, leaves 
governments without the control or restrictions which 
they need to limit the speed and volume of movements 
of funds in and out of their currencies 
internationally has gone too fast, too far. But 
there’s been no actual proposal as to how 
that would be remedied.At least they did 
express a little more openness to considering 
ways in which flows of funds now in 
different currencies could be moderated. I 
never heard them mention the tax. I did see 
only one mention, in which Mr Michel 
Camdessus, head of the IMF, said he saw no 
support for international taxation.

In the United States we have had a federal

didn’t have these kinds of essential safeguards. 
It would be very reasonable for a 
country like Thailand or Korea to regulate 
the amount of foreign currency debt held 
not only by the banks in their countries 
but also by the corporations in their 
countries. What you really want to do is to 
encourage your companies to attract equity 
investments,because they are not going to 
cause you to have a currency crisis. 
In the context of financial crises, what is 
the role of institutions like the IMF and 
World Bank? What is your ideal of how they 
should operate? Are they adequate, alone, 
to address some of the issues like 
development and amelioration of situations 
where there is a financial crisis? Do we 
need other financial institutions, such as a 
World Central Bank? 
I think the IMF could move in the direction 
of being a world central bank—which is more 
like what it was meant to be. That means 
that it would be prepared to provide 
international liquidity to countries getting 
into trouble without pretending that they are 
guilty of crimes and have to be punished as a 
price of the assistance. A central bank in a 
country which serves as a lender of last resort 
for banks in that country lends to them when 
they have liquidity problems without acting as 
though they committed a crime. They expect 
to be paid back shortly. We should see more 
of that spirit on the part of the IMF. 
TALKING TO... 
In fact, it was the original idea behind 
the IMF. All the countries had in the 
beginning rather generous drawing rights in 
the IMF which they could use without 
question. Now they are certainly not big 
enough because the total size of the quotas 
of all the countries together in the IMF is 
about 150 billion dollars,which is nothing 
for a worldwide institution that’s supposed 
to do what they are supposed to do. 
I think the World Bank is different. I 
am afraid in the last couple of years, the 
IMF has started taking over what was the 
World Bank responsibility. The IMF 
prescriptions for the countries in East Asia, 
whom they were presumably helping, 
included prescriptions for fundamental 
changes in institutions in the interest of 
reforming the long-run structure of those 
economies. But that was supposedly the 
mission of the World Bank,not of IMF. 
Economists have made great strides over 
the last decades. But they were unable to 
predict something as great as the financial 
crisis in Asia. Why is that? Why, despite all 
these advances in economics, are 
economists unable to foresee or forecast 
these kinds of crises? 
You can’t predict financial markets If you 
could predict them, then the process of 
acting on your prediction to get money, to 
get profits,removes the possibility of making 
money in them. They are matters of 
expectations and emotions, and they are 
not predictable really. 
As for the general question of why can’t 
economists predict things: that strikes me as 
really unfair. Meteorologists know a lot 
about weather but their predictions are not 
always accurate.Doctors know a lot about 
human disease but they are often surprised, 
often incapable of doing anything about it. 
So we are not alone in our failures. 
Do you think that there has been generally 
a shift towards market mechanisms in 
education,science and culture. If so, has it 
been a good thing or not? 
I think it’s hard to make generalizations 
about that. I think it’s true that there has 
been a movement against government 
regulation around the world. For example, 
privatization of government-owned 
enterprises. In many countries, a lot of that 
was not necessary, wasn’t particularly 
desirable.I think we have in this country a 
lot of people, including one of our political 
parties, who are opposed to using 
government money for culture, who would 
like to transfer government money from 
public education into subsidizing private 
education,private schools. There has been 
a trend in that direction. 
Do you think it’s a good trend? 
I think the spirit of it is not a good trend. In 
general it’s selfish and short-sighted. =
