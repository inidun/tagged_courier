15 YEARS AGO... 
On December 10, 1948, the 
Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights was adopted by the 
General Assembly of the United 
Nations meeting in Paris. At 
that time, Unesco’s Director- 
General, Jaime Torres Bodet 
hailed this great event in these 
words: 
HE declaration of 10 December 
1948 is more than an historical 
summary, it 1s a programme. 
Every paragraph 1s a call to action, 
every line a condemnation of apathy, 
every sentence a repudiation of some 
moment of our individual or national 
history; every word forces us to scru- 
tinize more closely the situation in 
the world today. 
The destiny of mankind 1s an 
indivisible responsibility which we 
all must share. So long as it remains 
possible to flout with impunity even 
one of the rights of one single human 
being, the United Nations Declara- 
tion will continue to accuse us all of 
cowardice, sluggishness, laziness, and 
to remind us that we are lacking in 
human charity. So long as the greater 
part of the human race continues to 
live face to face with hunger and

injustice and to die in squalor and 
ignorance, the Declaration adopted in 
Paris will represent nothing more 
than a remote ideal. 
0 make the Declaration known 
T everywhere 1s to wage a world- 
wide campaign for a life 
worthy of man, to whom the 
governments have dedicated this 
Declaration, not in mere lip service, 
but in solemn recognition of their 
duties to civilization and to humanity. 
To help States carry out these 
duties in the field of education, 
science and culture is the proud 
mission of TUNEsco. What nobler 
task could be assigned to culture, 
education and science, than to make 
all men the guardians, and hence 
the fervent exponents, of the Uni- 
versal Declaration of Human Rights?

SCHOOLS FOR ALL. Education must be free and compulsory, at least in the elementary 
and fundamental stages, to make the right to education a reality for all. Above, an elementary 
school class in Tunisia where a 10-year nation-wide programme to establish free and compul- 
sory education has been in operation since 1958. School enrollment has already increased by 
nearly 65%. Unesco has sent educational specialists to Tunisia to help with this programme.

UNESCO 
AND HUMAN RIGHTS 
FOR ALL 
Unesco helped to prepare the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
and has since assumed two responsibilities: to spread knowledge 
and understanding of the principles on which the Declaration is 
based and to work for the attainment and universal respect of rights 
relating to education, science and culture. The rights on which 
Unesco has concentrated special efforts are those defined in Articles 
26, 2,27 and 19. (The complete text of the United Nations 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights is reproduced on page 16). 
Everyone has the right to education. .. 
A= UNEsco’s work for education—from the 
extension of free and compulsory primary 
education to educational planning and development, from 
education for international understanding to the im- 
provement of general secondary and technical vocational 
education and from adult and youth education to the 
international exchange of educational information and 
documentation—aims to help member states achieve the 
standards proclaimed in Article 26 of the Universal 
Declaration. 
As part of its efforts to extend free and compulsory 
primary education Unesco launched in 1957 a 10-year 
major project for the extension of primary education in 
Latin America, This is designed to help co-operating 
states of the region to provide education for all children 
of primary school age as speedily as possible. 
Since then, other large-scale programmes for the 
development of education at the primary and other levels 
have been undertaken in Africa, Asia and the Arab states. 
For example, with resources provided from the United 
Nations Special Fund, Unesco has recently started several 
broad development programmes in these regions for 
technical and vocational education and the training of 
secondary school teachers. 
The educational goals of the Universal Declaration 
will only be attained if the advancement of education in 
schools is accompanied by action to provide out-of-school 
education for both young people and adults. Unesco has 
therefore set up regional training centres for education in 
(Article 26) 
community development in the Arab states and Latin 
America; it has alded national projects of youth and 
adult education; it has organized International con- 
ferences and expert meetings, and has carried out a wide 
variety of educational activities in collaboration with non- 
governmental organizations. 
A further step of major importance was taken in 1962 
when the General Conference of Unesco authorized the 
Organization to help prepare a massive world literacy 
campaign. The first phase of the campaign, which would 
be completed within the limits of the United Nations 
Development Decade, aims to bring literacy to some 
300 million of the 500 million illiterate young people and 
adults in Unesco member states in Asia, Africa and Latin 
America. 
Unesco has joined in the struggle agalnst discrimina- 
tion in education. A Convention and Recommendation 
against Discrimination in Education was adopted by the 
General Conferences in 1960, “not only to proscribe any 
form of discrimination... but also to promote equality of 
opportunity and treatment for all in education.” The 
Convention came into force In 1962. 
In combating dlscrimination in education, UNEsco has 
singled out for special attention the problem of providing 
full access to education for giris and women. It co- 
operates closely with non-governmental organizations 
working to extend education opportunities for women.

UNESCO AND HUMAN RIGHTS (Contd) 
Without distinction of race, colour, sex, 
language... 
U NESCO's action to combat discrimination ranges 
over many different aspects of the problem, 
from its effects in impairing the right to education 
to the harm caused by racial discrimination. 
In recent years Unesco has been diagnosing the causes 
of racial prejudice among young people and finding out 
how to prevent such prejudice from developing. Its 
inquiry on this subject among young secondary students 
in France, the German Federal Republic and the United 
Kingdom can be considered as the first comparative 
study of its kind. 
During the past 12 years, UNEsco has published or has 
sponsored the publication of some thirty works on race 
questions. To these publications it will shortly be adding 
a study by S. Zavala (Mexico) on “The Defence of Human 
Rights in Latin America” (16th to 20th centuries) in 
the series Race and Society, and also a collective work, 
“Industrialization and Race Relations,” prepared under 
the direction of the Institute of Race Relations (London) 
in the series, The Race Question in Modern Science. 
The nine booklets previously published in this series 
have been re-issued in one major volume which presents 
the points of view of sociologists, anthropologists, biolo- 
gists and ethnologists on the origins and development of 
race prejudice, and demonstrates that there is no scien- 
tific justification for racial discrimination. 
(Article 2) 
Unesco plans to carry out and to publish the results 
of two further studies. “The Development of Race Rela- 
tions in Africa,” a collective work, will include contrlbu- 
tions by African and non-African specialists. The results 
of the second study will be published as a booklet, “The 
Economy and Race Relations.” (See also THE UNEscO 
Courier—Oct. 1960—on “Racism”). 
Unesco has also made studies of the ways of life of 
certain marginal social groups. One of these “Nomads 
and Nomadism in the Sahara,” prepared by C. Bataillon, 
of the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes in Paris, has 
made an important contribution to knowledge of noma- 
dism, of the conditions in which it develops and of its 
social and cultural consequences. Another example Is 
the study by J. Ben Davis, of the University of Jerusalem, 
on the agricultural communities established in Israel by 
the immigrants who arrived there in great numbers after 
the second world ‘war. 
Thirteen years ago, Unesco published a declaration 
in which some of the world’s leading specialists in the 
fields of biology, genetics, psychology, sociology and 
anthropology set down the conclusions of scientific think- 
ing on the question of race. Judging that the time is 
now opportune for a fresh evaluation of scientific thought 
on this question, Unesco is to convene another internation- 
al meeting of specialists to reconsider the previous 
declaration. 
NESCO is making a broad 
study of new possibilities for 
attaining the right to share in cultu- 
ral life. By showing some of the 
factors which already give the popu- 
lation as a whole access to cultural 
life, Unesco will try to establish a 
better and more precise definition of 
measures that can assure a broader 
and more effective application of this 
right. 
Everyone has the right to the protection 
of the moral and material interests 
resulting from any scientific, literary or 
"which he is’ 
This study is being made in already 
technically advanced countries and in

Basically it seeks to assess the 
potential results that can be attained 
through a rapid expansion of mass

values of works that will become

Last year, the General Conference of 
Unesco declared its conviction that 
space communication offers “boundless 
prospects” for advancing Unesco’s aims. 
The retransmission of radio and TV pro- 
grammes carried out experimentally with 
the U.S. satellite, Telstar, (left) has 
already revealed the feasability of inter- 
continental communications by this 
means, For economic reasons, space 
satellites are likely to be first used regu- 
larly in the field of information and later, 
depending upon the extent of interna- 
tional co-operation, for educational and 
cultural exchanges on a global scale.

IFTEEN years ago, the United Nations Con- 
ference on Freedom of Information declared 
that freedom of information “is the touchstone of all the 
freedoms to which the United Nations is dedicated.” 
The United Nations and Unesco have recognized this fact 
by their constant efforts to help the people of developing 
countries to obtain adequate means of information. 
Four years ago, the United Nations Commission on 
Human Rights asked Unesco to make a special study of 
information facilities—press, radio broadcasting, films 
and TV—in developing countries and to suggest how they 
might be improved. 
Covering Asia, Latin America and Africa, UNEsco’s 
survey took. as a basic standard that any group of people 
should be considered to enjoy the “vital minimum” of 
information facilities if, for every 100 persons, it had the 
following: ten copies of daily newspapers; five radio 
receivers, two cinema seats and two TV receivers. 
The inquiry revealed that for some 2,000 million people 
in over 100 countries available information media falls 
short of this “minimum standard”; in other words, two-

thirds of the world’s population is deprived of this basic 
right to information. 
Unesco then prepared a programme to help the devel- 
oping countries to reach the minimum standard by 1975. 
The programme was endorsed in December 1962 by the 
U.N. General Assembly which asked nations to consider 
it as an element in the United Nations Development 
Decade. The General Assembly also asked Unesco to 
keep its survey up to date and to continue to further the 
development programme by using such means as new 
communication techniques to speed up progress in edu- 
cation. 
NESCO Is carrying out this task in a variety 
of ways. News agency development has been 
spurred by the setting up under UNEsco’s auspices of 
regional associations of news agencies in Asia and Africa. 
Unesco is helping to promote the tralning of journalists 
by granting fellowships and holding regional seminars. 
It sends experts to help countries build up their radio, 
film and TV services and to train staff in the use of these 
media for education. It Is now studylng how space 
communication through man-made satellites may be

used to promote the free flow of Information and ald the 
development of education. 
As deflned in the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights, freedom of Information comprises freedom to 
seek, receive and impart information and ideas “through 
any media.” The agreement which UnNEsco prepared 
abolishing customs duties on books, publications and 
other educational, scientific or cultural materials has now 
been adhered to by 44 countries. 
To appropriate International conferences Unesco has 
submitted proposals designed to promote free flow of 
Information through a reduction of postal and telegra- 
phic charges and of transportation costs for persons 
engaged in educational, scientific and cultural work. 
UNEscOo has also introduced a coupon scheme as a 
means of reducing currency barriers to the free move- 
ment of educational, scientific and cultural materials and 
to the exchange of students, teachers and research 
workers. UNEsco is helping to improve and extend tech- 
niques in information media. The reports and studies 
which It publishes are alerting public opinion to the 
obstacles which impede the free flow of information 
between countries.

### 63413: The Outlawing of India's caste system

THE OUTLAWING OF 
INDIA’S CASTE SYSTEM 
  
by Humayun Kabir 
Ne before In history has there been such 
recognition of the rights and duties of the 
ordinary citizen as there is in this century. 
In spite of the teaching of religions to the contrary, all 
societies in the past have been hierarchic in which a 
minority enjoyed privileges at the cost of the majority. 
Race, colour and sex have In the past been the basis of 
discrimination within and among communities. Different 
conceptions of human rights could and sometimes did 
subsist side by side and because of lack of communica- 
tions failed to coalesce or influence each other. 
Today such a state of affairs Is unimaginable. Whatever 
happens in one corner of the globe has immediate reper- 
cussions on all other parts. There can therefore no longer

be divergent conceptions of human rights. Any charter of 
human rights today must be a charter on a global scale. 
Such a charter is the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights. 
The great religions of the world have perceived the 
identity of human rights and duties from the earliest 
times. Though quite early in the history of India caste 
became an essential feature of the Hindu community, 
Hindu religious insight has always recognized the dignity 
of the individual by identifying the human soul with the 
Absolute. Buddhism with its doctrine of flux and the 
conception of Nirvana, Christianity with its enunciation 
of the Fatherland of God and Islam with its emphasis 
on the brotherhood of man have all proclaimed the same 
doctrine with equal and sometimes even greater force.

Hindus. These coun-

tied up their saris like 
trousers to give them 
greater ease when 
walking. In India 
today, the Constitu- 
tion affirms complete 
equality of rights for 
all citizens what- 
ever their religion, 
race, caste Or sex.

### 63413: The Outlawing of India's caste system

Today, in schools the world 
over, new generations learn 
the lessons of human rights. 
By instilling the recognition 
and respect of these rights in 
the classroom, the teacher 
can do much towards dispel- 
ling deep-rooted social and 
racial prejudices. In India, 
“untouchability” on the basis 
of caste has now been abo- 
lished and its practice in any 
form is forbidden. Right, a 
teacher in a village on the 
Upper Ganges reads to his 
class from a book written in 
Hindi, a language used by 
over 100 million people in 
India. The painted mark seen 
on his forehead shows that he 
belongs to the Hindu religion. 
All religions have declared that injustice against one 
man is an offence against all men. The Indian religions 
carried this doctrine still further and held that an offence 
even against an animal or a plant is a sin. One may add 
that apart from religious considerations, self-interest, if 
not ethics, has from the earliest times taught man that he 
should refrain from doing unto others what he would not 
like being done unto himself. Without this recognition of 
the rights of others, there would have been no eivil society. 
In spite of the fact that mutuality of rights and duties 
is the basis of human relations, man has often sought to 
claim rights for himself and deny his duties to others. 
Till the modern age, consent of the ruled was assumed 
rather than sought for. With the spread of the democratic 
principle, this has changed and today all progressive 
countries have written into thelr Constitutions certain 
fundamental rights and safeguards to preserve the dignity 
of the Individual and secure social justice to all. The 
preamble of the Indian Constitution affirms its determi- 
nation to secure for all citizens: “Justice—social, economic 
and political; Liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith 
and worship; And to promote among them all fraternity; 
   
Assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity of 
the Nation.” 
This reaffirmation was the more necessary In India, as 
our practice has often deviated tragically from the ideal. 
I need refer only to the dlsabllities which arose out of the 
Institution of caste. In origin and intention, though not 
in actual operation, caste was a device for enabling 
different races and individuals to live together in har- 
mony. Individuals as well as families could in the earlier 
phases pass from one caste to another. Caste in Its earlier 
bhases also helped to mitigate the economic conflicts 
which so sharply divided nineteenth-century Europe. 
Whatever may once have been the justification of caste, 
it had already become an institution of oppression by the 
time the Buddha appeared. His was one of the first nota- 
ble revolts agalnst caste. Ever since, Indlan religious 
teachers and reformers have fought it. The South Indian 
Nayannars denied it in the first millenium after Christ. 
Sankaracharyya, often regarded as the champlon of 
orthodox Hinduism against Buddhism and all other here- 
tical creeds, Is believed to have honoured an untouchable,

OUTLAWING CASTE (Cont'd) 
Prejudices die hard 
a man of the lowest caste in the Hindu social hierarchy. 
The impact of Islam in the middle ages gave an impetus 
to the movement agalnst caste and fostered a religious 
renaissance based on the dignity of man. Great reformers 
Ilke Ramanand and Kabir, Nanak and Chaltanya sought 
to break down the barrier of caste and judge individuals 
for their intrinsic worth. 
The advent of Eurcpe on the Indian scene also helped 
to undermine the rigors of caste. Starting from Raja Ram- 
mohan Roy, a succession of social, political and religious 
leaders fought to diminish the rigors of caste, If not alto- 
gether to abolish it. Names like those of Vidyasagar and 
Ranada, Shraddhanand and Vivekanand readily come to 
one's mind. 
0 NE of the most powerful poems of Tagore 
Gitanjali attributes the misfortunes of India 
to the evils of caste. Gandhi threw the whole weight of 
his personality against untouchability and caste and 
staked his life to restore freedom and equality among 
all members of the Indian community. It is therefore 
not surprising that the Indian National Congress has 
accepted the eradication of caste as one of Its major 
goals. 
The declaration of the equality of rights and dutles for 
all citizens in the Indian Constitution is therefore a direct 
outcome of the teaching of Indian seers from the days 
of the Buddha. In the modern period, voluntary agencies 
In all parts of the country have worked to create a new 
soclal consciousness based on the equality of man. 
One may add that modern developments in technology 
had In any case created a situation where caste and 
untouchability had become obsolete. Modern modes of 
transport compelled close contact among people of diffe- 
rent castes, communities, races and creeds. Industrializa- 
tion forced men and women to live together regardless of 
caste. The growth of towns led to increasing anonymity 
and offered the individual an opportunlty of shedding 
disabilities of caste. 
S oME ideological as well as technological consi- 
derations have combined to enshrine the con- 
cept of natural justice and respect for the individual in 
the Indian Constitution. Of the many article dealing 
with human rights, the following are of special interest: 
eo “The state shall not discriminate against any citizen on 
grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth or 
any of them.” 
® “No citizen shall, on grounds only of religion, race, 
caste, sex, place of birth or any of them, be subject to any 
disability, liability, restriction or condition with regard to 
access to shops, public restaurants, hotels and places of 
public entertainment ; or the use of wells, tanks, bathing 
ghats, roads and places of public resort maintained wholly 
or partly out of state funds or dedicated to the use of the 
general public.” 
® “There shall be equality of opportunity for all citizens 
in matters relating to employment or appointment to any 
office under the State.” 
eo “No citizen shall, on grounds only of religion, race, caste, 
sex, descent, place of birth, residence or any of them, be 
ineligible for, or discriminated against in respect of any 
employment or office under the State.” 
e “‘Untouchability’ is abolished and its practice In any 
form 1s forbidden. The enforcement of any disability 
arising out of ‘Untouchability’ shall be an offence 
punishable in accordance with law.” 
e “No citizen shall be denied admission into any educa- 
tional institution maintained by the state or receiving 
aid out of State funds on grounds only of religion, race, 
caste, language or any of them.” 
e “The State shall promote with special care the educa- 
tional and economic interests of the weaker sections of the 
people, and, in particular, of the Scheduled Castes and the 
Scheduled Tribes, and shall protect them from social 
injustice and all forms of exploitation.” 
As a further step towards the eradication of the social 
disability of the so-called lower castes, the Untouchabllity 
(Offenses) Act, 1955 (22 of 1955) became law on June 1, 
1955. This Act provides for the punishment for the prac- 
tice of “Untouchability,” for the enforcement of any 
disability arising therefrom and for matters connected 
therewith. Offenses under the Act, on the grounds of 
“Untouchablility,” are punishable with imprisonment. 
I: a democracy, the outcome even of legisla- 
tion depends ultimately on the will of the 
people and on the determination and effort of the back- 
ward sections themselves. Prejudices die hard and quick 
results cannot be expected. The surest, though not the 
quickest, way is therefore to make education broadbased 
and extend to all neglected classes the benefits of gene- 
ral, technical and professional education. A programme 
for the purpose was taken up even before the Consti- 
tution ‘was adopted and it has been intensified since then. 
With the development of educational facilities all round 
and the growth of industries and cities, it can be con- 
fidently expected that “untouchability” will vanish before 
long. The major burden for bringing about a change in 
outlook depends on the teachers. They will have to deve- 
lop a feeling for Human Rights in the minds of the rising 
generations through precept and, even more important, 
practice. The U.N. Charter will prove a most valuable 
tool for teachers in this ‘work, for here we have a for- 
mulation of rights and duties 'which apply to all men in 
all countries of the world. Although not enough has been 
done in schools in India and particularly in teacher train- 
ing establishments for spreading the lessons of the Char- 
ter of Human Rights, it is my earnest hope that the 
15th Anniversary celebrations of the signing of the Decla- 
ration will give a fillip to this programme, 
In the words of our President, Sarvepalli Radhakrish- 
nan, “The Commonwealth of humanity has no written 
Constitution; it is based on community of ideals, freedom 
and dignity of the individual, rule of law, economic 
opportunity for all citizens and love of peace.”

### 63414: Eleanor Roosevelt: a lifetime of dedication to human rights

~ ELEANOR ROOSEVELT, ‘who died last 
~ year, once wrote that in all her years at 
~ the United Nations she considered that 
~ the most important task had been her 
~ work on the Human Rights Commission. 
~ Chairman of the Commission from its 
~ inception in 1946 until 1951, she was 
~ present in Paris on December 10, 1948 
when the Universal Declaration, elabo- 
~ rated by the Commission under her chair- 
~manship, was unanimously adopted by 
ths United Nations; Q General A iT a 
He ha fea ta EA I 3 
~ Secretary-General 
f the United Nations et  
RS. ELEANOR ROOSEVELT was a dominant figure 
In the early days of the United Nations, for 
she came nearer than anyone else ever has to belng an 
actual embodiment of the commonly held ideals and aims 
of the people of the world. Her personality, courage, 
generosity and dedication placed her in a class by herself 
and gave her a unique position of universal confidence 
and respect. 
It is perhaps misleading to try to single out her specific 
work in the United Nations from the mainstreain of her 
amazing range of activity, for the whole of it ‘was based 
on broad and affectionate humanitarianism. But this 
humanitarianism and her deep concern for the underpri- 
vileged found an historic focus in the United Nations— 
especially in the work of the Human Rights Commission, 
and in the proclamation of the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights. She could not only communicate with 
the oppressed and the exploited the world over, she could 
identify with them. When she spoke of rights and 
liberties, she evoked no mere theory, but a practice and 
a way of life. 
Mrs. Roosevelt's patient and untiring work as Chairman 
of the Commission on Human Rights and its Drafting 
Committee 'was a major factor in giving shape and 
substance to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 
It was she ‘who, as chairman of lts first session in 
April 1946, proposed that the bill of rights should be 
drafted in the form of a declaration or manifesto to be 
followed by conventions that would be legally binding 
on states. 
It was her persistance and tact which guided the 
immensely complicated work of drafting the Declaration 
in 1947 and 1948, and her energy and enthusiasm which 
sustained others in this great labour. 
Though the impact of this historic document may well 
take generations to achleve its full force, its Importance 
in the development of human institutions and in the place 
of the individual in history is already great and is 
increasing. 
Mrs. Roosevelt was one of those rare indlviduals whose 
courage, vislon and good-will—and indeed outright good- 
ness—can light up a whole period of history and glve 
comfort and hope to humanity even in times of the 
greatest anxiety and despair. 
In a world in which human rights are still delayed and 
denied, It Is well for us to recall that Eleanor Roosevelt 
nourished the dream and the hope that the Declaration 
of Human Rights might one day become the Magna Carta 
of all mankind. 
This text is taken from an address by the Secretary- 
General of the United Nations, delivered at an Interna- 
‘tional Tribute to Eleanor Roosevelt, in New York, on 15 
October 21, 1963.

TEXT OF THE UNIVERSAL DEC 
Preamble 
Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the 
equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human

resulted in barbarous acts which have outraged the 
conscience of mankind, and the advent of a world in 
which human beings shall enjoy freedom of speech and

### 63441: Ataturk and the emancipation of women

CIPATION OF WOMEN 
  
Forty years ago a sweeping social revolution under the leadership and impelling drive of Kemal Ataturk gave birth to m odern Turkey. The spectacular changes in the status of Turkish women which it brought have since become a symbol 
and a goal to inspire th ose working for the emancipation of women in many other countries. Below we publish extracts from the text of a booklet, “The Emancipation of the Turkish Woman," published by Unesco last year. Its author, Dr. Afet Afetinan, a Turkish historian, played a leading role in Turkey's social evolution and worked in close collaboration with President Ataturk, whose memory is being celebrated this year, a quarter of a century after his death. 
T owes: women of the Ottoman era (14th to 
20th centuries), especially those in the cities, 
spent their lives In the complete seclusion of the harem. 
Their occupations consisted mainly of doing or supervising 
the housework, looking after the children or embroidering. 
Their social life was restricted to family gatherings. 
In one of her letters, Lady Montagu, wife of an English 
ambassador, wrote (1717-18): “The main things women 
do is go visiting neighbours, go to Turkish baths, spend 
lavishly and create new costume designs.” She also told 
her friends In England that she liked the costumes worn

the start of the 19th century it 
was forbidden for Turkish 
women to appear in public 
places and they had no part 
in the social and cultural life 
of the country. It was only 
in 1923 when a democratic 
regime was created in Turkey 
that they attained the rights

modern states. Right, in this

by Turkish women and that she herself possessed some. 
Lady Montagu, of course, meant the costumes worn 
by city women Indoors. The clothes worn outdoors 
reflected the kind of secluded life led by Moslem Turkish 
women. Their faces were veiled and they wore a loose 
wrap known as a charshaf. A variation of this costume 
was the combination of the feradje (something like a 
loose-fitting orercoat) and the yashmak (a veil which left 
the eyes uncovered and which was worn especially by the

ATATURK (Cont'd) 
From harem to university 
women of the palace). At a later date the wives of high 
officials and other women who from time to time visited 
the palace, either as private guests or on State occasions, 
were compelled to wear the feradje and yashmalk. 
This type of costume was generally worn throughout the 
Moslem world but only at a later date and there is nothing 
to suggest that women were compelled to adopt it in the 
early stages of Islam. 
The Levant Herald (England) of August 15, 1881 report- 
ed: “The officers of police are instructed to keep a strict 
look-out, and to make a report ‘whenever they observe a 
woman daring to wear the thin vell under circumstances 
in which it 1s not sanctioned by the regulations. The 
report will state the name of the offending lady and the 
particulars of the breach of rule and will be submitted to 
the Minister of Police. Moslem ladies are also forbidden 
to drive or ‘walk round the places of Beyazit, Shahzade- 
Bashi and Aksarai and to walk in the Great Bazaar and 
to sit down in shops. 
“Moslem ladies are also strictly forbidden to gather 
together in groups in any public places and if the police 
observe any group, it will be their duty to invite them to 
EQUAL RIGHTS. In Turkey the past 40 years have 
been marked by rapid and far-reaching improvements 
in the status accorded to women. Today they are 
found in virtually every profession. Below, a young 
nurse helps a doctor to vaccinate school-children.

disperse. This invitation will be addressed to the oldest 
lady in the group, or to the servants in attendance, at the 
discretion of the officer. The latter part of the regula- 
tions is devoted to prescribing the manner in which men 
shall behave to ladies in public. Any man who permits 
himself to speak to a woman or to make signs to her will 
be punished under Article 202 of the criminal code.” 
These rules, however, were not strictly applied at all 
times. There were even times when women enjoyed a 
measure of freedom. During the “Tulip Period,” which 
coincides with the second half of the eighteenth century, 
women wearing light coloured feradjes attended open-air 
festivities and entertainments, as is shown by paintings 
and writings of that period. 
From the fourteenth century until early in the twentieth 
century (1918), Turkish ‘women ‘were subjects of a 
Moslem Empire ‘which spread over three continents— 
Asia, Europe and Africa—and covered about six milllon 
square kilometres. 
But ‘while the theocratic Ottoman State was extending 
its boundaries, the social position of women deteriorated. 
The expansion of the Ottoman Empire brought it in 
contact with the influence of Persia and Byzantium, and 
the old Turkish customs were slowly forgotten. During 
this period new differences of status between the sexes 
increased. The harem life of Persia and Byzantium was 
introduced into the Turkish palace. In the fifteenth 
century, on orders from the Sultan, the palace was divided 
into the harem (women’s section) and selamlik (men’s 
section). 
The viziers and beys were not slow in introducing this 
system into their homes, and soon harem life and poly- 
gamy spread among a certain class of people and became 
an accepted custom. 
Pouce was practised in Arabla long before 
Islam and led to such a deterioration of family 
life that the limitation of the number of wives to four 
was considered to be an important reform. The Islamic 
stipulation that men and women are equally responsible 
for the honour of the family was also regarded as an 
advance in Arabia, the birthplace of Islam. 
Thus men and women alike were expected to abide by 
the rules of morality and to be faithful to their spouses; 
but all the rules and teachings of Islam could not bring 
about the desired equality between the sexes even though 
the laws of Islam, in general, honoured women more and 
conceded them more rights than did the old Arabic, and 
perhaps even the Roman laws. 
The Islamic family laws adopted by the Ottomans were 
concerned ‘with marriage, inheritance and minorities. As 
regards marriage, 'women had no say in choosing their 
husbands who were selected by the parents of the girl or 
an older member of her family. Engagement was not 
recognized in law and, if it took place at all, it ‘was by 
private arrangement hetween the two families. The 
husband had the right to divorce his wife whenever he 
wished merely by announcing to her, orally or in writing, 
“I divorce thee.” 
What was the situation of the slave woman of the 
Ottoman period who filled the harem of the palace? They 
were brought from the Caucasus and other parts of the 
empire. The leading figure in the palace harem was the 
sultan’s mother; next came the mothers of the sultan’s 
children; in addition to their wives the sultans could keep 
as many odalisques and slaves as they wished. 
Occasionally the sultan would give some of these women 
their freedom. 
Although female slaves in the Ottoman period were

SYMBOL OF WOMEN'S 
SECLUSION. The Turkish 
woman in this 19th century 
photo wears a yashmak or 
veil, which hides the face, 
but leaves the eyes uncov- 
ered, and which women 
were always obliged to 
wear in public. In 1922 
the first women students 
who enrolled at the Faculty 
of Medicine in Istanbul 
wore their veils when 
attending lectures with 
men. They continued to 
do so until 1925 when 
Kemal Ataturk urged adop- 
tion of European dress. 
treated like chattels, they were also given rights whereby 
they could acquire their freedom and become members 
of free society, and children of parents who had won their 
freedom were also regarded as free citizens. Slavery and 
the slave trade were abolished by a decree of 1854. 
The role of country-woman in all the parts of the 
empire was that of the producer. In farming women 
supplied a great proportion of the labour and they also 
played their part in the economy of the home. Though 
polygamy was also practised in the country and men 
sometimes married as many as four wives it ‘was generally 
for economic reasons. Country women did not dress like 
the city women ‘when outdoors. Open-air life set them 
working alongside men and therefore they did not hide 
their faces behind veils or yashmaks. They only avolded 
a man and covered their faces if he ‘was a stranger. 
In the 19th century there was a movement towards 
western ways of life which led to considerable changes in 
education, art and sclence, as well as an evolution in 
social life. As a result, some progressive Ideas had 
already been implanted in women’s minds by the end of 
the century. 
Already before 1869 the Government decided to open 
primary and secondary schools for girls, but because the 
teachers in such schools would necessarily be male and 
 
Ara Guler collaction 
because girls of 11-13 years of age were considered as 
having reached an age ‘when they should be segregated 
from men, public opinion would not tolerate the idea. In 
1870 a school was opened in Istanbul to train women 
teachers for the primary and secondary girls’ schools. 
Although initially most of the teachers In this school 
were men, by 1900 ‘women ‘were in the majority and hence 
the number of women with a modern education llkewise 
increased. 
The years 1908-18 were marked by two developments: 
enrolment in girls’ schools progressively increased, and 
certain men even ventured to go out in the company of 
their wives. The fact that Sadrasam (Prime Minister) 
Fuat Pasha consented to sit with his wife In the lounge 
of an hotel caused much comment. 
A new soclal situation was created In Turkey when the 
Ottoman Empire entered the First World War. As men 
were called up for the army women had to be appointed 
to fill vacancies In the offices. During the war the 
first faculty for girls attached to the University of 
Istanbul was opened (1914). In 1921 the Arts Faculty 
agreed to co-educational attendance at lectures. 
The passive resistance with which women, from the

Revolutionary changes 
in language & writing 
When the fabric of the theocratic and feudal Ottoman Empire with its out- 
dated structures and institutions collapsed after the First World War, Kemal 
Ataturk transformed Turkey into a secular state. The greatest obstacle to 
development was illiteracy (over 90%) so he decided to reorganize the 
educational system and to make use of Latin script (in 1928) because it 
lent itself more readily than Arabic characters to a rendering of the Turkish 
language in writing. Innumerable borrowings from Arabic and Persian 
had produced a literary language which was almost unintelligible to the 
majority of the population. Before launching a nationwide educational 
programme, Ataturk decided to rid the Turkish language of these foreign 
words. Today the spoken and written forms of the language are identical. 
Ataturk established a number of cultural institutions, including The Turkish 
Historical Society and the Turkish Language Society. He stimulated and 
actively supported the historical and archaeological research in Anatolia 
which has revealed to the world the existence of hitherto unknown civiliza- 
tions. Left, a portrait of Ataturk (1881-1938). Right, Ataturk visiting a

ATATURK (Cont'd) 
Educate women to educate a nation 
beginning of the twentieth century, opposed veiling and 
the witholding of the right to go out freely, to ride in 
the same carriage as their husbands and to sit next to 
them, eventually triumphed over the fanaticism of 
public opinion. 
Until the end of the First World War, men and women 
were separated from each other on public transport by 
partitions. On boats sailing the Bosphorus and crossing 
from Istanbul to the islands, women were obliged to stay 
in closed cabins below decks. When ‘women were finally 
permitted to remain on deck, a woman author described 
her feelings at being able to watch the sea in the open 
air during that one-hour trip with such zest that anyone 
would have imagined that she was crossing the ocean for 
the first time. 
There were many changes In the status of women 
between 1918-23, largely brought about by the historical 
events of the time. 
In 1918, the Ottoman Empire signed the Treaty of 
Mondros as one of the defeated powers, losing all rights 
over her Asian territories (Arabia, Syria, Palestine, Leba- 
non, Iraq). In 1920, the last government of the Ottoman 
Empire signed the Treaty of Sévres, agreeing to the 
dismemberment of Turkey, and every part of the country 
now faced the possibility of occupation. 
While the Sultan and his government accepted these 
terms the nation itself did not and turned its mind to the 
idea of lUberation. To preserve the unity of the country 
it was necessary to bring together all the local forces. 
‘With this in mind, Mustafa Kemal (Ataturk) assumed 
the leadership of the nation and his first actions as leader 
were to refuse to recognize the international treaties 
entered into by the Sultan and his government and to 
launch resistance agalnst the occupying powers. In the 
beginning this resistance took the form of guerilla fighting, 
but on April 23, 1920, Kemal formed a government and 
a regular army and attacked the forces of the occupying 
powers. 
In 1922 Anatolia ‘was cleared of occuping troops and 
with the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923 the boundaries of the 
new Turkey were established. The same year, on October 
29, a democracy was instituted with Ankara as the new 
capital. Thus monarchy in Turkey came to an end. 
In the democratic State which was created in 1923, 
Turkish woman had at last attained the rights enjoyed 
by women in other modern states. 
The constitution of democratic Turkey made elementary 
education for boys and girls compulsory, but because of 
the shortage of teachers and school bulldings its applica- 
tion remains largely theoretical, Turkey's high percentage 
of illiteracy is thus likely to remain so for some time. 
All faculties of the Istanbul University started opening 
thelr doors to girl students from 1921 and many teacher- 
training schools, lycées, and other institutes were opened 
for the beneflt of girls. In addition, many of the existing 
schools Introduced co-education. In 1928, the adoption of 
the Latin alphabet made learning much easier and as a 
result there was an immediate increase in the number of 
persons able to read and write. 
NCE women began to study in colleges and 
universities many of them entered a variety 
of professions and trades. But this was not always an 
easy matter, as was seen in the case of the medical pro- 
fession. When young ‘women wished to study law or 
the arts no obstacles were placed in their way. But 
when they showed interest in becoming doctors of medi- 
cine, public opinion was aroused and even educated 
parents were reluctant to accept the idea. Articles were 
published in the newspapers, claiming that women were 
not likely to succed as doctors. 
However, a small minority approved and supported 
women in their struggle. Encouraged by this support,

seven girl students enrolled at the faculty of medicine of 
Istanbul University in September 1922. Because, in terms 
of dress, women were still bound by the old customs these 
first women medical students wore their vells while 
attending lectures with men and continued to do so until 
1925, when Kemal Ataturk urged the adoption of European 
dress. 
The first women medical students completed their stu- 
dies'in 1927 and, after a year’s interneship, received their 
diplomas as fully qualified doctors. These and other 
women doctors who had studied in Europe or America 
worked only as general practitioners. When some of them 
wanted to become specialists, however, most of thelr male 
colleagues declared that despite their attainments as 
students, women would not be successful as practising 
doctors. In time, the difficulties ‘were overcome and 
women ‘who have specialized in different branches of 
medicine have once again proved their capabilities. 
Today, women are found in virtually every profession. 
The engineer who supervised the building of the Ataturk 
Memorial Mausoleum in Ankara, for instance, ‘was a 
‘woman, Sablha Guneyman. The chief architect of the 
Evkaf (religious trusts) in Istanbul is also a ‘woman, 
Cahide Tamar. The famous Rumeli Fort in Istanbul was 
restored by three women architects. 
Teaching was the first profession open to women in 
Turkey and the number of women who have taken up 
teaching in primary and secondary schools, lycées and 
universities is still much higher than in other professions. 
So far, there is only a small number of women professors, 
although there are a good many lecturers and assistant 
lecturers. Those holding top positions in government 
departments are still far from numerous. 
On the stage, women have likewise distingulshed them- 
selves, especially when it is remembered that until a 
quarter of a century or so ago they were kept strictly 
within the confines of thelr homes. It had always been 
considered agalnst the principles of Islam for women to 
act. Aflfe Hanlm was nearly Imprisoned in 1921 for 
contravening this principle. Women had to struggle for 
thelr rights in this field just as In so many others. 
The first woman jolned the Turkish bar in Ankara in 
1928. Since then the number has increased conslderably 
and today, in addition, there are many women judges, 
commlssioners of oaths, legal advisers and lecturers at 
the law schools. 
Today, in Turkey, men and women are equal In the eyes 
of the law. The many social reforms introduced during 
the presidency of Kemal Ataturk (1923-38) always took 
account of women's position; many legal rights and duties 
were freely conceded to them. 
In 1926 the Turkish Government introduced a new set 
of civil laws along the lines of the Swiss Clvil Code. Thls 
gave Turkish women all the rights customary in modern 
communities, 
The Turkish Civil Code, In terms of civil rights, did 
away with all the legal dlfferences between men and 
women. It made women the equals of men, except that 
women were subject to certain restrictions aimed at 
securing permanency ln marriage. 
The prohlbition of polygamy was one of the fundamental 
features of this code, which also raised the marriageable 
age for girls to 18, laid down certain pre-marriage forma- 
lities, and required that marriage ceremonies should take 
place before the municipal authorities in the presence of 
witnesses, and also that a marrlage should be recorded 
both In the register and on the identity cards of both 
parties. 
In April 1930, parliament passed the Munieclpal Laws Bill 
glving women the right to vote and to stand In municipal 
elections. The next step was to give women the right to 
stand for parliament. Presldent Ataturk was in favour 
of this and often trled to induce members of the govern- 
ment to accept his views. In the constitution then in 
force, mention of franchlse was always accompanied by 
the words “every Turkish male.” On December 11, 1934 
the words “and female” were added to this phrase. 
Thus, Turkish women managed within a quarter of a 
century to overcome a fanatlcal opposition and thereby 
set an example to other women of the Moslem world, 
Sue they were given the right to vote both as 
a result of the action of polltical parties and 
their own desire to carry out their dutles as citizens, a 
high percentage of women have participated in elections. 
For example, In 1954 out of 5,366,024 women voters (the 
total number of voters was 10,287,733), 4,741,304 used their 
right to vote. 
In spite of all the legislation enacted for thelr benefit, 
however, Turkish women in general have not yet achieved 
the social and intellectual standing that could be desired. 
In the country as in the town, they must be educated so 
that they realize the meaning of all the rights conceded 
to them by law. 
On this subject, Professor Sadi Irmak wrote in 1962: 
“There are four factors that undermine our efforts to 
bring about equality for women: ignorance, bad traditions, 
wrong interpretation of religious rules, male selfish- 
ness ..."” Professor Irmak analyses all these clements 
and emphasizes the effect of illiteracy, declaring: “we 
must educate women so that they, in turn, can educate 
our nation.” It Is essential that women of Turkey should 
realize the meaning of their rights and duties before 
exercising them. 
The man responsible for the reforms in Turkey was 
Kemal Ataturk, who believed in preparing both the 
people around him and also public opinion before 
introducing anything new. Ataturk wanted his people 
to progress and to prosper according to the most 25 
enlightened ideas and the principles of modern civilization.

by German Arciniegas 
Fifteen years ago the Colombian author, Garman 
Arciniegas, wrote a remarkable study on the right 
to culture which was later published in English in 
the volume ‘’Freedom and Culture’’(1). The follow- 
ing article is abridged from this text which is as 
timely and meaningful today as when it was written. 
Lo many other eities in America, Lima has Its 
own archaeological museum. Learned Peru- 
vians, French and German archaeologists, poor peasants 
from the mountains—all show nowadays a keen interest 
in recreating the history of civilizations which existed In 
the Western Hemisphere before the arrival of Christopher 
Columbus. 
The centre of Interest has shifted. Discoveries now 
made In America have aroused the same public curlosity 
as did, in thelr day, the Assyrian excavations and the 
finding of Tutankhamen’s tomb. Diggings undertaken in 
sandy stretches of the Peruvian desert have revealed 
mummies between five and ten centuries old, wrapped in 
cloaks of the most exquisite texture and colouring. The 
dry particles composing these arid dunes have preserved 
the cloth, which looks as glossy as If it had only just lett 
the unknown hands and primitive loom of its native 
weaver. 
But neither mummies nor cloth can compare with the 
museum’s eighty thousand pleces of pottery. Until the 
Europeans arrived, the Indians made clay figures of ani- 
mals, birds, flowers and men. They achieved technical 
perfection. The thin layer of terracotta, covered with 
enamel, has withstood the action of time. The work 1s 
the llving expression of an age-old spirit. 
Clay represented for those earlier peoples poetry, the 
theatre, and books. If was the natural vehicle for the 
expression of thelr genius. In clay the artist depicted 
with one bold stroke the proud heads of warriors, or the 
loving, submissive brow of the Indian woman. In his 
representation of old people, the irony and mailee of the 
ceramist have the same corrosive effect as has the hand 
of time, when it wrinkles and shrivels up the skin. It is 
unlikely that sculptors of our own day will be able to put 
greater meaning into their work. 
These old artists of Peru had some magic quality in 
their fingertips. They combined poetry with realism 
superbly. In a design showing two doves or the head of 
a llama they could convey the rhythm of a subtle grace- 
fulness with a delicacy which has never been surpassed 
In the decorative arts. When representing scenes of dally 
life, they showed man engaged in all his crudest activities 
with a frankness—ingenuousness—of expression which no 
present-day artists have ever ventured to use. 
Four centuries ago, this culture came to a standstill. 
Then began the colonial epoch, introduced by the Spanish 
sovereigns in the name of Christianity. Little by little, the 
frults of a new culture began to take shape. They have 
not yet reached maturity. For instance, it is impossible 
to find in Peruvian ceramic art of today works as perfect 
as the old ones, or which reflect so faithfully the life of 
a people, 
Nevertheless, those forgotten nations which entrusted 
their innermost poetic dreams to the care of so fragile a

Around the pow-

a rich tradition of

The ups-and-downs of a word 
material as clay continue to live. The humble, unknown 
potter can never have imagined that the frail vessel on 
which he stamped a woman's fugitive smile would remain 
floating above the current of the centuries and be turned 
into a message from his then isolated and remote native 
land—a message of wonder to our modern world which he 
must have been quite unable to envisage. 
This provides an excellent lesson. It shows us that 
there Is something about culture which is Immortal. 
Today we can get to know a lost world, simply by looking 
at pleces of pottery in a Lima museum, just as we can 
make contact with other worlds in the gilded halls of the 
Cairo museum, or among the ancient stones of Yucatan, 
China or Rome. Learned men labour to determine the 
number of dead civilizations. But are they really dead? 
Is it not rather we who are deaf to the voices of the 
remote past? 
The word “culture” is one of those that has 
suffered the most ups-and-downs in all languages, in a 
universal masquerade of misunderstanding. Those respon- 
sible thought that by taking the word away from its 
obvious and natural meaning (stemming directly from the 
root word “cultivate”) and trying to turn it into a grand 
lady dressed in her Sunday best, they were going to create 
the most important character in the “drama of enlight- 
enment.” 
We are now coming to the moment when it is necessary 
to consider whether such a disguise must. be considered 
definitive, or whether the time has not arrived for a 
radical change which should place culture in the simple 
context of human rights—not in that of a privilege 
pertaining to an intellectual class. For culture is a for- 
ward movement whose object is to cultivate the mind, to 
form the personality. “Culture is something which has 
to grow. You cannot build a free; all you can do is to 
plant it, and look after it; and walt for it to mature in 
its own due time.” These are the words of T.S. Eliot—true 
words and words that should be elevated into a symbol. 
In the history of languages, the first thing to appear 
as culture is the cultivation of plants, the labour of the 
soil, agriculture. Let us recall the line of Pope’s: 
We ought to blame the culture, not the soil. 
It would seem as though, before appertaining to the

history of literary development, culture were by natu- 
ral right a word belonging to natural history. 
If, in referring to a “tree,” Eliot were not speaking sym- 
bolically, he would be leaving something unfinished. For, 
so far as culture is concerned, there is something more 
than just a tree, subject to decay. What glves culture its 
particular quality Is its power to transmit a heritage, a 
treasure, from generation to generation—what is called a 
tradition. 
When we dehumanize culture and cut it off from its 
branch in order to stick it in a flower-vase, we hasten the 
day of its death. Culture Is rooted in the depths of human 
existence. It begins on the very day man discovers the 
means of raising himself above the level of the beast— 
when he controls fire, invents the arrow and begins to 
speak. 
Between these first discoveries and those of the wheel, 
the metal wing, the waves which carry the voice and even 
the light and shade of photographs across the oceans, lie 
centuries of research, generations which have sweated 
blood, rejoiced and suffered under the chancy pendulum 
of life. All is part and parcel of this development of 
human culture. 
But when we say “culture” in the singular, we are using 
an abstraction; as such it is unsatisfying, giving the term 
a generic, amorphous sound. We must look at the 
species in its plural aspect, for the *“cultures”—in the 
plural—evoke wonderful facts: Egypt and Mexico, Greece 
and Japan, France and China, the Amazon, Polynesia. 
In naming them thus, the vital significace of the term 
becomes apparent. Representatives of every nation take 
on colour, voice and shape as they move across their own 
magic screen. I would almost suggest that “culture” is 
not a noun but a verb, Indicating the action carried out 
by the peoples as they move forward under the urge to 
rise, take shape and mould their characters. 
The right to culture is therefore an individual one. It lis 
the human right of every people to reveal its soul, to 
express itself freely. And it Is a permanent right. It 
took many centuries for the Egyptians to acquire an 
architecture of their own and a hieroglyphic style of 
writing and to evolve methods of preserving their dead, 
portraying their great national leaders In stone, and 
bringing the Nlle valley under control in order to turn 
it into the nation’s granary. 
The archaeology of the great cathedrals of Europe is 
the best witness to the slow development of cultures. We 
see in these cathedrals how the ages overlap one another. 
We begin with the Romanesque crypts with their dog- 
tooth arches, and end with the Gothic spires, which had

CULTURE AND FREEDOM (Cont'd) 
The humblest artifact tells a story 
to wait centurles before the stone sprouted forth in fioral 
decorations, strange and fabulous creatures, and all that 
the Middle Ages produced from their miracles and magic, 
thelr patience and their dreams. 
Finally, we may say that the right to culture is, as it 
were, the ultimate right of all peoples. It must be upheld 
until they are able to loosen their tongues and untie the 
knot in which theirhiddenlongings are heldbound. Itis the 
most important factor in the development of their internal 
freedom. It has made possible the creation of languages, 
symphonies, mural paintings, ornamental capitals, figures 
in marble and bronze, and books. 
Culture expresses itself In customs. It is seen in ges- 
tures, manners, the expressions which appear on the lips, 
In the hands, in the looks of the countryman, artisan, or 
student: It passes from one lp to another, one hand to 
another, one eye to another, right up to refined circles, 
untill it covers with a mesh of behaviour every human 
group, which thus reaches its own style of expression. 
It would be interesting to follow, in painting for 
example, the history of the different attitudes of the 
hand; from the hand which grasps, clutches and closes 
over convulsively, to the two hands that unite In prayer, 
or are covered with rings, or seem about to bestow a caress. 
We may recall the oriental hands of Fujita; those of the 
Dutch peasants painted by Van Gogh in his Supper of 
Potatoes; those of El Greco’s noblemen in the Burial of 
the Count of Orgaz; those of the Gioconda, and those 
of the women in Botticelli’s Spring. Every expressive 
gesture disseminates itself by sympathetic contagion. 
Thus are the customs of each society formed. 
A: every new stage, with minute variations, 
attitudes take on greater refinement, polish 
and meaning and words more colour; while new concep- 
tions, issuing in felicitous gesture, can be attained even 
among the lowest ranks of society. 'Whoever has lived 
among countryfolk knows how, under their rough exterior, 
there is a native civility—some would say even courtesy. 
This is expressed in such ways as, for instance, hastening 
at a meal to pass the first and best helping to the woman 
guest, wife or mother. May not this part of our culture 
have had its origin among such as these, and subsequently 
have passed into urban usage? 
The same thing happens in the case of words. It is a 
pity that in the rush of modern life there Is not time to 
“prepare” ‘words, to await the moment when they 
suddenly become so charged with meaning that they seem 
to have some miraculous effect on the development of the 
language. 
Formerly, in all languages each of the smallest parts of 
a house, a ship, or a coat-of-arms was given a name which 
was a poetic Image. In our mechanical age, words to do 
with the motor-car and the aeroplane sprout up in the 
catalogues with the same speed at which steel sheets are 
pressed into shape in the moulds. There still remains, 
however, a wide margin in the matter of adjectives and 
of names that spring up in popular intercourse. If the 
greatest writers In all ages, those who have later become 
the pride and ornament of literary cultures, made them- 
selves masters In one thing, it was in this: picking up, 
as they went along, gems of popular speech. 
From hands and words we may pass to countless 
different aspects of life. There Is no piece of crockery 
we use daily, no household utensil, that does not contain a 
history of novel shapes developed, transformations brought 
about by taste which has been free to function creatively. 
In their handwriting and In the peculiarities of their 
capital letters the characters of the different peoples 
show up plainly. In clothes, in hats, In cosmetics, in 
polite social intercourse and in cooking—in everything we 
see the cultivating hand of man, leaving an impression of 
his passage, proclaiming his active, personal presence. 
Are there superior cultures; or are there only different 
cultures? Upon the answer which we give to this double 
question depends the whole problem of respect for 
culture, for the individual spirit of different péoples, for 
the freedom of expression which is of the essence of such 
matters. If so much literature had not accumulated on 
the subject of superior culture, it would be puerile to 
present the question in its double form. It can only be 
answered by referring back to the obvious and natural 
meaning of the word “culture.” For then we eliminate 
the deformations imposed by nationalist imperialism, the 
vanity of certain peoples, or the momentary triumph of 
certain political tendencies, and arrive at the original and 
permanent conception that culture consists in the cultiva- 
tion of Man; which acts as a refining influence on the 
personality of every people, shaping its individual style 
in the course of generations. 
VERY people is bound to have its own parti- 
cular mode of expressing itself, a variety of 
images, rhythms and gestures, in which Eastern art can 
be as rich as Western. The painting of the Japanese 
Sesshu is of one style; that of Rembrandt is of another 
style. The glory of the world consists in there being 
both a Sesshu and a Rembrandt. 
Culture has what we might call provincial depth. It 
is essential to observe that culture is a measurement of 
depth, not of surface. And it Is in the provinces where 
the spirit of a people is concentrated and where greater 
emphasis is given to the personality. It is this provincial 
consciousness that gives Europe its highest value. To be 
able to talk of a Flemish, Provencal, Scottish or Basque 
tonality—to be found in language, painting, dancing or 
dress—Is to express vital facts about the culture of a 
continent. 
This Intercourse between Nature and the arts and 
customs which Goethe saw realized in Italian culture, 
occurring as it does in every part, in every single province 
of the world, produces the wealth of expression character- 
istic of mankind. Freedom of expression, freedom of 
study and research, freedom to penetrate into the life of 
the people and to present the fruits arising out of one’s 
meditations, these open to man the only road by which 
his passage through this world can be made other than 
sterile. _ 
The superiority implied by democracy over aristocratic, 
oligarchic or absolutist systems lies in offering people of 
every colour, social origin or race, opportunities of access 
to institutions working for the advancement of culture 
through the medium of the sciences, the arts and letters. 
These opportunities are nowadays a human right on which 
all intellectual progress depends. It is the human enter- 
prise par excellence. Humanlising culture simply means 
returning to authentic culture. 
T= fundamental thing about culture is its 
intimate association with historical develop- 
ment. There is no superior culture; there are only inci- 
plent, adolescent or mature cultures. It is all a question 
of time. 
Nowadays there are means that can be used to accelerate 
the development of culture; but there is a limit to such 
acceleration: it has to conform to natural laws.

### 63443: Culture and freedom

32 
CULTURE AND FREEDOM (Cont'd) 
Man has not spoken 
The same thing does not happen in the case of civiliza- 
tion, for which reason a distinction must be drawn between 
the two words, although not necessarily in the Spenglerian 
sense. “Civilization” is an expression of the citizen, of 
clvil life, which springs up in the city. When there is a 
civil authority, a civil law, a civil code, life has become 
civilized. It makes no difference that the people should 
still remain uncultured. It might happen, as has been 
affirmed, looking at the problem from a European stand- 
point, that civilization represented the final stage of a 
culture. But this Is not essential. 
But what is happening today? Civilization can be 
fabricated. There is no need to plant it like a tree. 
Everyone is agreed that the progress of civilization has 
been rapid, and not always favourable to culture. Civiliza- 
tion itself has been shown to have a marked propensity 
to suicide. It can devour itself for lack of culture. 
It is obvious that in order for culture to prosper civiliza- 
tion is necessary; that is to say a system of civil life in 
which the dignity of man is respected and the free 
working of the means for study and self-expression 
assured: where there is civil justice and work is not 
carried on under barbarous laws, so that the intelligence 
is able to retain its spontaneity and freshness which are 
the malnspring of its activity. The problems of man and 
of the spirit, which today confront one another in Asia, 
Europe and America, are thus situated between the two 
terms “culture” and “civilization.” 
In the present development of civilization a new factor 
intervenes: communications. All inventions are diffused 
nowadays with a rapidity undreamt of before. Continents 
are brought together and, In this sense, the 
world appears to be uniting. It represents far more one 
clvilization than many civilizations, in contrast with the 
position in the field of culture, where diversity is the rule. 
The attainment of a civil existence enabling man to 
cultivate his “spirit” that is what the common sense of 
the ordinary human being demands at the present time. 
A soem declaration of man's ancient faith 
in his liberties has now become a matter of 
the greatest urgency. Our struggle and the great ques- 
tion of our time are comprised in those precedents whose 
study Unesco has agreed upon. In the preamble to the 
Constitution of this new international organization it 
is already stated: “Peace must be founded upon the intel- 
lectual and moral solidarity of mankind.” 
From the depths of the collective soul rises a demand 
for justice, for balance. For hope also is one cf the 
rights of man—an alleviation of his toil and fatigue. 
“The Universal Declaration of Human Rights,” says the 
[former] Director-General of Unesco, M. Torres Bodet, 
“is the most promising international document to svhich 
governments have set their names since 1945... It is the 
first international manifesto enumerating the rights of the 
individual and setting forth the conditions to be fulfilled 
by those States that desire to respect the liberty and 
dignity of the human person. It is the extension of 
honour in man. It is an urgent call to governments to 
remind them that man exists...” 
Yes, indeed: man exists. His is the lasting value. 
Dictators are here today and tomorrow are gone ‘with the 
wind. Man is the result of generations of struggle, ideals, 
work accomplished, hopes which form the basis of his 
rights to life, liberty and a place in the sun. Every step 
forward in the conquest of civilization, every advance in 
culture, have been marked by, nameless sacrifices, by 
vigils in which ardour overcame all misfortunes. 
Centuries of history have given man his strength. He 
has been a slave in innumerable dark periods in his life 
his final word 
that are well known. But every time he has hoped for 
the dawn. And the dawn always comes in the end. Man 
does not so much live as outlive himself. He is the work 
we inherit, the work we continue, and the work we leave 
behind unfinished when our hands fail, to be carried on 
by the nimble hands of our youthful descendants. 
For man the hour for the complete realization of know- 
ledge, justice and liberty has not yet arrived. Open before 
us lie ever new vistas to feed our dreams, new incitements 
to struggle, new reasons for not allowing life to become 
a profitless existence. Every bit of knowledge we possess is 
still a subject for free discussion. The explanation of man 
and the argument in favour of liberty are based on the 
evident fact that man has not spoken his final word.

Letters to the Editor 
WITH LOVE FROM CELESTE 
Dear Sir, 
I am 7 years old. I am in grade 2. 
I do not want the monument of Ram- 
ses II at Abu Simbel to be drowned, 
because I want to see them. I am 
sending $3.00 J saved.

UNESCO COURIER ON TAPE 
 
Sir, 
Answering your question why we 
did not renew our subscription—the 
reason is a purely personal one and 
has nothing to do wtih a lack of 
appreciation of your highly interesting 
and informative magazine. . - 
I ordered it for my" mother, 
Mrs. Else Danelius, after her immigra- 
tion from the U.S.A. last year, for a 
trial period. My mother belongs to 
that rather substantial group of old 
people who have to pay for an other- 
wise blessed old age with failing eye- 
sight. In the US.A., she was granted 
a talking book machine by the U.S. 
Government and was thus able to 
enjoy books and journals read to her 
on disks. In this country, we have a 
Central Library for the blind whose 
stock in non-Hebrew books on tapes is 
rather limited and which is dependent 
on the goodwill of European countries 
for its reading material. As my 
mother’s eyesight permits her to enjoy 
pictures, I took out a Unesco COURIER 
subscription for her. 
My mother enjoys your magazine 
very much but, unfortunately, there is 
nobody who has enough time to read 
to her the rather substantial and very 
informative articles for which the 
pictures are only an illustration. If it 
were possible to have these articles 
read on tapes in a similar way as 
some magazines are read on disks in 
the U.S.A. and distributed to blind 
people, you might open the contents 
of your magazine to an entirely new 
group of readers : those whose eyesight 
is too weak to permit them to read 
by themselves. I am sure that these 
handicapped people would enjoy the 
paper as much as their seeing contem- 
poraries and appreciate your work even 
more than we do. 
I have no idea whether your means 
permit you to embark on such a 
project, at least in one or two of the 
most popular languages. [I feel quite 
sure that the Braille institutes all over 
the world would be only too glad to 
help you. Some of the people working 
there are blind themselves and I have 
come to admire their activity on behalf 
of their equally handicapped brethren. 
Dr. Eva Danelius 
Herzliya/Nof Yam. Israel 
Editors’s Note. — Our corres- 
pondent’s suggestion is most interest- 
ing. Unfortunately, our magazine lacks 
the means to launch such a project. 
TEMPTER TRANSFORMED 
  
Sir, 
In your April issue a photo 
published under the heading. “A Smile 
from Europe™ depicts a [3th-century 
statue on Basle Cathedral. From the 
caption we learn that it represents a 
girl. The statue is part of a religious 
composition quite common in the 
Middle Ages, taken from a Biblical 
story about the Tempter and the 
Foolish Virgin. The statue in the 
photo is that of the Tempter. In the 
Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts there 
is a plaster cast of the statue in the 
mediaeval gallery. 
Vera Yermonskaya 
Moscow, US.S.R. 
Sir, 
The statue on Basle Cathedral is 
not that of a young woman. It depicts 
a Tempter who stands opposite the 
figure of a woman symbolizing Sin. 
This couple in stone are placed (photo 
below) to the right of the main door 
of the Cathedral.

EAST-WEST TRANSLATIONS 
 
Sir, 
I read with special interest in your 
February issue the article by Robert 
Collison: “The Continuing Barrier : 
Translations and East-West Communi- 
cations.” The accompanying tables 
listing translations from Asian to 
Western languages in 1960 showed the 
following results for Belgium : 2 books 
from Chinese, 1 from Ethiopian, 1 
from Hindi, 2 from Japanese, 1 from 
Syriac, I should like you to know that 
in one series of publications alone 
—the Corpus Scriptorum Christiano- 
rum QOrientalium — my firm printed in 
the original language the following 
volumes: 1 Arabic, 2 Coptic, 2 Syriac, 
2 Georgian and 1 Ethiopian, as well 
as the corresponding translations of 
these eight volumes.

Louvaln, Belgium 
THE SOUND AND THE FURY 
Sir, 
UNrsco estimates (May issue) that 
400 million more radios would be 
needed to provide a receiver for each 
family in Africa, Asia and Latin Ame- 
rica. I just cannot regard a radio 
receiver as an instrument for cultural 
betterment, I live in a middle-class 
district of Paris. My neighbours, who 
one would expect to be relatively cul- 
tured pcople, force me to listen to 
their favourite radio programmes. But 
what I hear from open windows on 
every floor is of the very poorest 
quality : hackneyed tunes, stupid jokes, 
ear-splitting jazz. It is clear to me 
that instead of trying to improve public 
tastes and standards, the radio merely 
aims fo satisfy the demands of the 
run-of-the-mill listener, 
The people for whom it is proposed 
to provide the millions of transistor 
scts are in many cases those who have 
created, and continue to create, folk 
music which is far finer and more 
inspired than the “international” airs 
they will hear through their radios. 
Just like tobacco and alcohol, the 
radio has already poisoned too many 
people. And as a first-class instrument 
for filling people’s heads with propa- 
ganda it has already been widely used 
in the “war on the wavelengths.” 
M. Muller 
Paris, France 
HOUSEWIFE LINGUISTS 
 
Sir, 
A letter in your May 1963 number 
asks: “How can such people as a 
farm worker in the Massif Central (or 
Lower Saxony), a postman in the 
Pyrenees (or Croatia). a housewife in 
Brittany (or in Sicily or Norway) 
learn languages like English, Russian, 
Chinese, Arabic—even supposing they 
wanted to?” 
The great majority of Norwegian 
children get lessons in English in the 
elementary school and more than 
90% of them get further schooling 
with education in English and other 
languages. 
We would also like to point out 
that the housewives of Norway form 
a substantial number of the scholars 
in the special adult courses throughout 
the country. These courses especially 
teach foreign languages.
