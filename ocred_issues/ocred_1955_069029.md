This child is one of the 180,000 who this 
year are receiving primary or secondary 
schooling under the UNRWA-UNESCO 
educational programme for Arab refugee 
children. The Arab refugees, in one sense, 
have an advantage over many other peoples 
of the Middle East in the number of their 
daughters in school. In the camps of the 
Jordan, girls represent 48 per cent of the 
total enrolment, (UNRWA Photo) 
  
His century has ‘become hardened to migrations, 
| expulsions and “concentrations” of human beings. 
These exoduses make the headlines for a few weeks 
and then the “refugees”, the “displaced persons”, or the 
“deportees”, sink into oblivion. 
In the Middle East, today, there are nearly one million 
refugees from Palestine. They have no land to begin life 
anew and build another country. They are scattered in 
hundreds of camps... old army bivouacs, abandoned barracks, 
tent cities, and tin-can towns. But they have not been 
abandoned. Since 1948, help has been coming from the Arab 
States and from the United Nations. 
Aid to children came first. These children were growing 
up among lost and bewildered adults. They had no other 
horizon but their camp, and no other images in their heads 
but the painful memories of their parents. The children ran 
the risk of becoming natives of that frightful modern limbo, 
the universe of the refugee—ignorant, bitter and useless. 
At first a few dozen schools were started. These had the 
sky for a roof, then they went under canvas; at first they 
had neither desks nor pencils, then equipment arrived. 
At present there are over 300 UNRWA-UNESCO schools 
attended by over 100,000 boys and girls while grants-in-aid 
enable a further 60,000 children to attend other schools, run 
privately or by governments. The Unesco General Con- 
ference last December and the Unesco Executive Board in 
March together allocated a total of $170,000 for the two year 
period, December 1954 to December 1956, as aid to schools 
for Arab refugees, 
In these schools, children learn the Koran as they learn 
reading, writing and arithmetic. They also learn history 
and geography. They learn trades that spell independence 
for them. At present vocational training teachers are 
working in refugee schools with courses running from three 
months to two years. These schools offer a tremendous 
variety of job opportunities: printing, bookbinding, machine 
shop work, car maintenance, weaving, brush-making, 
carpentry, basket-making, photography, shoe-making, home 
economics, radio and electricity. 
Finding teachers for these schools was no easy task. As 
recently as three years ago, only one-third of the teaching 
staff, all of it Palestinian in origin, was considered as 
qualified. Since then, more than a hundred teachers have 
been able to obtain sound pedagogic training at universities 
in Beirut and Damascus and at the Khadouri agricultural 
school in Jordan. In addition, future teachers are able to 
attend normal schools in Irag and universities in Egypt. 
Finally, more than six hundred teachers have been given an 
in-service course in certain camps. Many young refugees 
are now going to secondary schools. For higher education, 
refugees have been admitted to Lebanese, Egyptian and 
Syrian universities. 
But what about the adults and even the adolescents who 
are too old to go to school? Is feeding the only way of 
helping them? They deserve the same opportunity as the 
children of the camps, for they, too, are hunting a way out 
of the stifling inertia of body and mind. 
The camps, slowly but surely, are beginning to resemble 
villages where people can lead a normal life with a window 
on the outside world. The school is always their centre and 
it is always surrounded by flowers and vegetable gardens. 
Men of the camp fill its classrooms at night, not only to learn 
how to read and write—for illiteracy is still high—but also 
to hold meetings and discussions which serve the function 
of a study club or a municipal council, as the case may be. 
Huge tents now shelter warehouses and workshops— 
shoe-making shops, carpentry shops, clothing factories or co- 
operative bakeries. People no longer want to be left alone. 
They have slipped back into the daily relationships of work 
and of business—and also of the sports which have dealt a 
final blow to boredom. Instead of being a statistical item, 
the refugee is now a producer and a citizen and, as his 
leaders say, “Life has a meaning for him.”

When armed conflict broke out in Palestine seven 
years ago, nearly 1,000,000 Arabs packed their 
belongings and took refuge in the neighbouring 
countries of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, 
Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and in the Gaza strip. But 
local resources could not cope with all of them

unsolved. But a great deal has been done to make

like the Fawwar Camp in Jordan (above), have in 
many cases been replaced by huts like those at 
Jebalia, in the Gaza coastal strip (below, right). 
The United Nations Relief and Works Agency 
(UNRWA) has also built some experimental villages.

nearly a million people locked the 
doors of their homes, and taking 
with them only the few clothes 
they could carry and provisions to last 
I T is just over seven years ago that 
for a day or two set off on a journey - 
from which there has as yet been no 
return. : 
Armed conflict had again come to 
the Holy Land, and this time the 
victims were 900,000 Arabs, for the 
most part unarmed civilians who could 
play no part in the fighting in which 
they were suddenly enveloped. 
That they would return to their 
- homes once the shooting was over, 
none of them doubted for a minute— 
it might be a matter of days, or even 
weeks. Yet the cruel irony of fate 
decreed it otherwise. For the solution 
of the world’s longest-standing prob- 
lem of displaced persons—with the 
arrival of hundreds of thousands of 
European Jews: on the shores of 
Palestine—was to result in the creation 
of another problem, the hitherto in- 
soluble problem of the Arab Refugees. 
Wherever they went in the surround- 
ing countries of Syria, Lebanon, Jordan 
and Irag the refugees met with the 
traditional Arab hospitality. But local 
resources were not sufficient. There 
were too many refugees. To the 
Kingdom of Jordan alone came half a 
million. Yet Jordan, before the trou- 
bles, itself had a population of only 
700,000 and, in the Gaza coastal strip, 
refugees outnumbered the original 
inhabitants by nearly four to one. 
Lessons on the sands 
N the emergency it was above all a 
question of saving lives. Food, 
shelter and medical supplies were 
rushed to the scene of greatest need by 
the United Nations, with the assistance 
of the International Committee of the 
Red Cross, the League of Red Cross 
Societies, and the American Friends 
Service Committee, who were sup- 
ported by the host governments and 
countless local organizations who came 
forward to help. 
While people were starving and 
suffering from exposure, there was no 
time or money to spare for non- 
essentials; consequently, to begin with,

Agency for Palestine Refugees. 
there were no schools. But as the 
weeks stretched into months and the 
children roamed the streets in idleness, 
it was not long before this problem too 
had to be faced. Before there was 
any hope of tackling it as a whole, in- 
dividual teachers, themselves refugees, 
took the initiative into their own 
hands. Unpaid and with no shelter 
from the burning sun they gathered 
little groups of children around them 
in the open desert. 
Flour and soap salaries 
ANY of the teachers had known 
the children from before, for 
whole villages took flight from 
Palestine together and have clung 
together in their exlle. In a world 
where everything was shattered, 
these first make-shift classes brought 
new hope and a purpose back 
to life. The parents, the village elders 
and the Mukhtars (village headmen) 
took heart. Bearded sheikhs did their 
share in giving religious instruction. 
The younger generation would not 
grow up in ignorance. In recognition 
of their services the teachers were 
allowed an extra bag of flour, a pound 
of sugar or a few cakes of soap. 
A number of classes were started by 
the Red Cross and the other Voluntary 
Agencies. The YM.C.A. opened a 
school near Jericho, in the largest 
camp in the Jordan Valley, which 
remains to this day; the Quakers 
supported several in the Gaza strip. 
In other places the modest needs of 
the first refugee schools were met by 
selling the empty containers in which 
the monthly rations reached the 
camps—egunny sacks, kerosene cans, 
and containers of all shapes and sizes. 
Here and there, a spare tent was made 
available, so that the children could do 
their lessons in the shade, 
By the time that the Third Unesco 
General Conference was held in Beirut 
in 1948, thousands of boys and girls 
were already receiving some form of 
education as a result of these efforts, 
and the delegates to the congress, many 
of whom made it their business to 
study the plight of children at first 
hand, were so impressed with what 
they saw that they gave a fresh 
impetus to Unesco’s efforts 
to raise funds. As a (Cont'd on

from far and wide and the first Unesco 
contribution of $15,000 had reached 
$90,000 before the end of 1949, This 
gift, which seemed to come as an ans- 
wer to so many prayers, at last gave 
the teachers the chance to organize. 
By Alay, 1950, when the United 
Nations Relief and Works Agency for 
Palestine Refugees was established by 
the UN. General Assembly to relieve 
the Voluntary Agencies of the burden 
they could no longer carry, there were 
already 33,500 children in the schools. 
By 1953 that number had been doubled, 
and by 19355, including children re- 
) 
PACKED CLASSES During the past four or 
five years, half a million children among these Arab 
refugees have been saved from illiteracy and ignorance. 
This year, UNRWA will be responsible for the school- 
ing of about 160,000 children of elementary school 
age and another 20,000 who attend secondary classes. 
In these schools, packed classes of Arab children 
(photos, right) follow their lessons with touch- 
ing eagerness. (UNRWA and UNESCO photos) 
ceiving grants-in-aid to study in 
outside schools, it had been multinlied 
nearly six-fold to reach a total of 
170,000. The upward spiral of UNRWA’S 
schools programme with technical 
assistance from vuUNEsco is indeed 
remarkable, but not so remarkable 
when it is considered that of the entire 
Arab refugee population, no less than 
50 ¢; are children beneath the age 
of 16—nearly half a million children. 
It is impossible for any one to 
appreciate the significance of education 
amongst the refugees unless he has 
seen the conditions in which they live. 
A pilgrim to the Holy Land who visits 
the place of Baptism on the River 
Jordan will pass one camp after 
another on his way to the Mount of 
Temptation, and should he climb it to - 
the summit, where a Greek monastery 
commemorates the spot, he will see 
below him stretching far into the 
distance a mushroom growth of tents 
and ramshackle mud huts—the home 
of 75,000 refugees. These men, women 
and children outnumber the original 
people who lived in the nearby town 
of Jericho by more than sc¢venty to one. 
    
Why such a dense concentration? 
In this valley 800 feet below sea level, ’ 
where heat lies shimmering in the air 
and summer temperatures are the 
highest recorded in the Near East, 
what employment can there be for so 
many people? 
The answer is simple. The refugees 
are concentrated in regions where 
there is water. In the Jordan Valley 
there are many springs. One of the 
most abundant, Elisha's fountain, 
provides the water for the large camp 
which lies at the foot of the Mount of 
Temptation, known by its Arab name 
of “Ain-el-Sultan”, or Sultan's Spring. 
UNRWA may distribute a monthly ration 
with a minimum of 1,600 calories a day, 
but without water the refugees would 
die of thirst. In Jordan, water is 
scarce and they cannot choose. 
It is true that chances of work are 
remote, although in years when there 
are plentiful spring rains, seasonal 
employment is obtainable for a good 
many of the men folk at a very low 
wage. If the present survey work 
carried out by uNRwA in conjunction 
with the Jordan Government for a

major irrigation scheme in the Jordan 
and Yarmuk valleys is successful, 
there would be opportunity for tens of 
thousands of refugees and Jordanians 
alike to find work in agriculture, not 
to speak of the secondary economic 
benefits which would create oppor- 
tunity in other fields. But today un- 
. employment is the refugee’s plague. 
In Gaza the situation is worse, for 
with 200,000 refugees amongst an 
original population of only 80,000, who 
themselves have lost the greater part 
of their lands and trade, there is little 
chance of even seasonal employment. 
The Gaza strip, as it is called, which 
"is the only part of the coastal plain of 
Palestine remaining in Arab hands, is 
but 12 miles long and between three 
and five miles wide, and more than half 
+ is made up of sand dunes. Here, life. 
in the sense that everyone had lived it 
before came to a sudden stop. Or- 
dinary economic concepts of money in 
circulation and employment figures 
have completely lost their meaning. 
The refugees have little to do but line 
. up before uNrRWA’s distribution centres 
to receive their monthly ration of 
flour, pulses (peas, beans, lentils), oils 
and fats, sugar, rice, milk, soap and 
kerosene, 
The Gaza residents, without rations, 
are, if anything, worse off than the 
refugees, but they have nevertheless a 
quantity of agricultural products which 
they may barter for some otherwise 
unobtainable commodity amongst re- 
fugee rations. Occasionally goods 
change hands for a few coins and some 
small payments may be made for 
labour or services rendered. A man 
may spend all day selling four 
tomatoes, or finding a customer for a 
a little sugar or an empty bottle. 
"In these circumstances the only 
members of the family who can live 
anything approaching a normal life 
are the children who go to school at 
regular hours, who have something to 
do which is worth doing and who can 
have any sense of achievement. There is 
never any problem of absenteeism, the 
children are always punctual and do 
their lessons with a gravity and 
eagerness which can leave no visitor 
unmoved. Education amongst girls 
has progressed by leaps and bounds, 
Unesco Courier. — N® 7, — 1955 
and if jit is true that there are more 
children in school today than there 
would have been but for the exodus, 
it must be borne in mind that they 
are cut off from the life of a productive 
community and can no longer grow up 
in the trade or tend the land of their 
fathers as of old. 
In present circumstances, the darker 
grows the future the more desperately 
do refugee fathers and mothers seek 
education for their children. This is 
true of all classes, including the 
Bedouins. Education has become a 
part of the struggle for survival. 
No sooner is a new school built today 
and the last classes are moved out of 
the tents than more children are 
pressing on the doors, new teachers 
are found somehow, and up go the 
tents again. In Jordan alone this year 
165 classrooms were built and next 
year’s programme provides for nearly 
as many more, 
Expansion has been so rapid that 
there is always a scarcity of school- 
books and equipment. One 
school may have a wallmap 
but no football—it is here

that Unesco Gift Coupons have often 
proved invaluable to fill the gap. 
Nor does it finish with the children. 
Everywhere in the world end of term 
exams are no doubt much the same. 
There are the same anxious faces; the 
same last minute poring over notes. 
But this year, in Gaza, there was a 
difference. More than 300 adults, men 
and women of all ages, joined the 
children in sitting for the State Exams. 
They were members of the UNRWa- 
uNesco Fundamental Education Centres 
whose enthusiasm made them insist on 
being allowed to test 
their new-found 
UNRWA and the capital available for 
this purpose is many times greater 
than the funds available for relief. In 
close co-operation with the Arab 
governments, UNRwA is exploring all 
possible means of making the refugees 
self-supporting. This may take the 
form of 50 million dollars earmarked 
for the Jordan Valley Development, or 
a few hundred cash down to buy a 
barber's chair, or a lathe to re- 
establish a refugee craftsman in his 
former trade. 
Here, as a result of water and soil 
knowledge by actually 
taking the examina- 
tion. Results show 
them to have been 
amply justified, for 
93 9% of all adults 
were successful. 
The programme to 
introduce fundamental 
education amongst the 
Arab refugees, which 
started in 1953 with the 
CLASSES FOR PARENTS 
keep many of the refugee 
schools open well into the 
night. Since 1953, funda- 
mental education has been 
developed with the aid of 
a UNESCO expert loaned to 
UNRWA. After the chil 
dren go home, schools be- 
come “clubs” where in one 
room people read or play 
. back-gammon and in another, 
have lessons in English or 
pore over their first Aratic 
reader. (UNESCO photo) 
help of a UNEsco eXx- 
pert loaned to UNRWA 
has produced outstanding results every- 
where—but most of all in Gaza. The 
schools have scarcely time to close after 
the last child has packed up and gone 
when it is time for them to open up 
"again, transformed into a kind of club. 
In one room people will be reading 
magazines, borrowing books from the 
library, playing back-gammon or 
dominoes, or writing their contribution 
to the “Wall-Newspaper”. Attached to 
many centres are workshops where 
members can learn carpentry, shoemak- 
ing, tailoring and other crafts. 
An allied development of UNRWA’s 
Welfare Division has been the setting 
up of embroidery centres, where 
refugee girls have been trained to 
adapt the traditional cross stitch 
patterns of the Holy Land on modern 
table linen and to turn out well cut 
skirts and blouses. Skilfully developed 
by a tireless marketing supervisor, 
herself a refugee, sales of these goods 
have increased so much that today in 
the Gaza strip alone 700 women and 
girls have full time employment. 
Indeed rehabilitation in all its 
aspects is the burning problem of 
surveys an agricultural co-operative 
will spring up, there a factory will 
receive a loan to buy new machinery 
after undertaking to employ a quota 
of refugee labour, To create employ- 
ment on one occasion vNRwA actually 
went into business itself by setting up 
a large modern tent factory where 
refugees are employed to manufacture 
their own tents instead of importing 
them from overseas. 
Last but not least is the vocational 
and professional training of the most

the refugee schools. uNRwaA opened its 
first modern vocational training centre 
with the aid of experts from the In- 
ternational Labour Organization, two 
years ago outside Jerusalem. Since 
then the first trainees have all found 
employment and a second centre has 
been opened in Gaza, while in Lebanon 
and Syria hundreds of scholarships 
are given in different fields to refugees 
to study in existing institutions. 
In spite of these efforts it would be 
misleading to suggest that a solution 
had been found to the burning 
problem of the Arab refugees. The 
refugees cry out to be allowed to go 
back to their homes—a right ac- 
knowledged in early U.N. resolutions. 
But political tension has run too high. 
All that can be said in the meantime 
is that uNrRwa is seeking every means 
to restore to the refugees their eco- 
nomic independence, while at the same 
time educating their children and 
training their youth so that, whatever 
the future may bring, the new 
generation will not grow up In 
ignorance, and will have a chance to 
play its part in the rapid development 
of the Middle East.

FLIGHT TO 
G A ZI A 
In 1948, refugees from Pa- 
lestine fled to the narrow 
strip of coast, some 25 miles 
long by three miles wide, 
around the city of Gaza, thus 
increasing its population from 
90,000 to nearly 300,000. 
The refugees were concen- 
trated in nine camps made 
up mostly of tents which 
were eventually replaced 
by cement brick buildings.

ALF a million children among the Arab refugees from 
Palestine have been saved during the past four or five 
years from illiteracy and almost total ignorance, as well 
as from the despair that ignorance breeds. These early 
emergency years are over and now an educational system 
devised for the children of the refugees has been set up and 
is in working order. This system might almost be described 
as a “Ministry of Education”, though it is difficult to conceive 
of a ministry that has heavy responsibilities without a shred 
of real power and that performs its international task within 
the framework of four different nations each ‘with its own 
educational system. 
Certainly there are a number of genuine ministries of edu- 
cation in the world today which cater to the needs of fewer 
pupils and dispose of smaller budgets. During the coming 
school year this make-believe “Ministry” or, to give it its real 
name, the Education and Training Division of the United 
Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRwA) will be responsible 
for the schooling of about 160,000 children of elementary

school age and of approximately 20,000 who will attend 
secondary classes. 
In addition it will provide education at the university level 
for some 350 students and up-to-date vocational training for 
about twice that number. It will be given about five million 
dollars to do this job and will be expected to spend every cent 
to the best advantage, for this money comes from the pockets 
of the taxpayers of the United Nations. 
The education of the Arab refugees has become a very large- 
scale enterprise. Indeed nowhere in the world today is an 
international organization embarked on an educational 
project that approaches this particular one in scope and 
magnitude. The United Nations have in fact been forced by 
the Middle Eastern emergency to go in for school-mastering 
on a mass scale, which is certainly something they never 
contemplated in 1948 when the refugees first poured across 
the borders of Palestine. 
How is the job done? Technical guidance at the top comes 
from a handful of educators who, when they are not trav- 
elling back and forth across the Arab countries 
where the refugees live, do their administrative (Cont’d on

Good bill of health 
Since the days of the first emergency in Palestine, when 
nearly a million human beings were living on the verge 
of starvation, the preservation of health and the preven- 
tion of disease among the refugees has been a major 
activity of the U.N. and its Specialized Agencies. The 
spread of infectious diseases had to be prevented, clean 
water supplies provided and decent sanitary conditions 
created in the camps. Malaria, to which many newcomers 
to the Jordan Valley fell victim, had also to be combatted. 
As a result of health programmes, no major epidemics 
have broken out and health conditions in general have 
improved. UNRWA maintains more than 80 clinics 
which receive an average of half a million visits a month.

Milk and a hot meal 
Palestine Arab refugees being helped by UNRWA receive 
food rations which provide a diet of approximately 
1,500 calories daily in summer and slightly more in 
winter. In many cases the refugees manage to supple- 
ment their raticns by finding at least part-time or sea- 
sonal employment, but where this is impossible supple- 
. mentary feeding centres play an important part in allev- 
iating hardship. A daily hot meal is served to refugees 
certified as suffering from under-nourishment by their 
UNRWA doctor. In addition to the monthly ration, a 
daily cup of milk is given (left) to all children up to the 
age of 15 and to expectant and nursing mothers. At 
regular intervals surveys are carried out by World 
Health Organization or Food and Agriculture Organiza- 
tion specialists to watch over the general trend of refugee 
health, Simple education in nutrition and health is 
given at the centres and also by social workers (adjoin- 
ing) who take an active part in village community 
development projects. (UNRWA and UNESCO photos)

{Continued from page 9) 
Their present head is a Dutch educator who has been all 
his life a student of Arabic and the ways of Islam and who 
was for some years Minister of Education in Indonesia. He is 
assisted on the purely educational side by a Canadian deputy, 
by a Jordanian Educational Consultant who was twice 
Minister of Education in his own country and by a Consul- 
tant for Fundamental Education who is a Moslem from India. 
On the vocational training side his advisers are a Scottish 
deputy and an Anglo-Irish consultant. Two educational 
assistants, one an Arab and one an Armenian (whom fate 
has made a double refugee!) complete the Headquarters staff 
which though small does at least include two real Ex-Minis- 
ters of Education. 
Most of this Headquarters staff is either recruited by 
Unesco or seconded from the personnel of that organization, 
for it is UnEsco’s responsibility to provide both technicians 
and technical guidance. On the other hand, the money that 
pays for the area staffs, including a corps of teachers over 
2,600 strong, and the money that pays for school buildings 
and for school supplies comes from Unrwa funds. 
This small Headquarters staff is fully occupied with the 
formulation of policy, with the compilation of statistical data, 
with wrestling with budget officials—as is the lot of educa- 
tion officers everywhere—and with liaison with international 
organizations and with the educational systems of what are 
called “the host countries”. At the next level, that is to say 
in each of the four host countries, the elaborate educational 
machine is watched over by a field education officer. 
One of these officials supervises, from the UNrwa sub- 
headquarters on Mount Scopus in Arab Jerusalem, the school 
system which caters to the children of the close on half a 
million refugees in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. His 
sector includes the sprawling camp schools of the lower 
Jordan Valley, where summer heat is so intense that the 
school year has to be cut short in May. It includes also the 
trim new stone buildings the Agency has erected beside the 
rock-bound refugee camps of Samaria and Judea as well as 
the crowded classes packed tightly into rented buildings in 
Amman and the Old City of Jerusalem. 
Inspectors on horseback 
Is colleague in Gaza has a much more compact school 
H system to administer but it is a populous one too with 
the children of nearly a quarter of a million refugees. 
Finally, in Beirut and Damascus respectively, two other Field 
Education Officers cater to the children of the two hundred 
thousand refugees which Lebanon and Syria shelter between 
them. There are fewer big camps here and inspecting schools 
in the remote hill-country villages, in Syria particularly, may 
often entail a long trip by Land Rover or on horseback. 
In each host country care is taken to adhere closely but not 
slavishly to the local curriculum. This entails the use of the 
same text-books as are used in the local government schools. 
Such a policy makes it easy for pupils attending UNrwa- 
UNEsco schools to sit for Government examinations and has 
the further merit of lessening the gap between refugee and 
local population. 
Visitors to the area often ask where all the teachers come 
from. The answer is that the refugees ‘were lucky in one 
thing, namely that they came from a country which enjoyed 
a relatively high standard of education. It was natural 
therefore that in the long, straggling columns that fled north 
and east and south in the summer of 1948, there should have 
been a high proportion of school inspectors and headmasters 
and teachers of every grade as well as farmers and artisans 
and the semi-nomad Bedouins. 
These teachers from Old Palestine still play an important 
part in the UNrRwa-UNEsco educational system, though their 
number is being increasingly diluted by younger teachers who 
never saw service in the schools of Mandatory Palestine and 
whose only training has been acquired in the hard school of 
experience and in brief summer refresher courses. 
The Arab refugee teachers have done a heroic task, often 
working under the most unfavourable conditions for long 
hours and low pay. Even the new and improved scale which 
is about to be introduced will only provide a minimum 
monthly salary of about $45 a month with a maximum rising 
to about three times that amount. The fact is that food and

ohelter and medical care had first claims on available funds. 
Mention of the gallant corps of UNRwaA-UNESco teachers 
leads directly to another question that is often asked. What 
is the level and quality of the education that is imparted to 
the children of the Arab refugees? ) 
Now the quality of teaching depends directly on the quality 
of the teachers themselves, and if some of these are now 
rather old-fashioned and out-of-date and others largely raw 
and untrained that quality is not going to be of the highest 
order. But the correct answer to the question of quality 
probably is that UNrRwA-UNESco education is not nearly as 
good as those responsible for it would like it to be and not 
nearly as bad as some detractors make out. 
It can certainly stand comparison with the kind of educa- 
tion that the largely underdeveloped host countries are able 
to afford, though these countries are constantly straining to 
improve their standards. 
Still it would be folly for those responsible to the United 
Nations and to the conscience of the world to rest on these 
dubious laurels. The improvement of methods of teaching 
and of the general quality of education is the foremost goal 
of the five-year plan for education on which the Agency is 
now embarking. Ways must be found of humanizing the 
educational process, of rendering it less solemn and less 
static, of substituting the careful development of the indivi- 
dual intelligence for the excessive reliance on memory and

"TENT MAKING is now an industry run on modern lines at the Ghor 
Nimrin factory near Jericho, where over 1,000 tents are produced each 
month. This factory has become the sole supplier of tents to UNRWA, 
memorizing. The teaching of the Arabic mother tongue must 
be streamlined so that it is made even more effective while 
using up fewer of the-precious hours of the syllabus than it 
does at present. Foreign languages, mathematics, the natur- 
al sciences, history, geography, can be taught much better. 
As a first step in a much needed reform two experimental 
teacher training centres, staffed by a selected group of inter- 
national experts, will open their doors this autumn, one in 
Jerusalem for men teachers and one in Nabius for women. 
These will be followed a year hence by full scale teacher 
training centres in all or a majority of the host countries. 
From these training centres in the next few years will 
- come not only a stream of teachers to fill the gaps in the 
Unrwa-UNEsco schools and to raise the level of the teaching 
there, but also sizable quantities of teachers for export. 
A good teacher is worth his weight in gold anywhere in the 
Arabic-speaking region that stretches from Libya to the 
Persian Gulf and from the Taurus Mountains to the Red Sea 
and beyond. Some of the oil-rich, education-hungry Arab 
lands put a high premium on their services and the trek of 
Palestinian teachers to Kuwait, Qater, Bahrein and Saudi- 
Arabia is not a new phenomenon. 
Even more ambitious than the teacher training programme 
are the plans for the development of vocational 
and agricultural training. Modern vocational (Cont’d on

The existing vocational training centres at Kalandia near 
Jerusalem and at Gaza are likely to be supplemented within 
the next twelve months by new centres in Lebanon and 
possibly in Syria as well. In addition, a first agricultural 
training centre is now being built in Gaza and others should 
follow it in the Jordan Valley, where very special agricultural 
conditions prevail, and again in Lebanon and Syria. 
These agricultural training centres will not endeavour to 
produce agronomists on the university level but rather agri- 
cultural leaders for present, and future communities. The 
graduates of both these types of centre,.the skilled tradesmen 
as well as the agriculturalists, have, like their colleagues the 
teachers, a high and constant export value. Money invested 
in them will be money well spent. 
Some day, somehow, the politicians will have to sit down 
and solve the problem of the Arab refugees from Palestine. 
This is not the concern of educators and they can be thankful 
that it is not. It is their particular task to equip the rising 
generation to face life in the modern world, whether that life 
is destined to be lived within or without the borders of their 
former homeland. 
There are really few sights more inspiring than a packed 
class of black-eyed Arab school children almost literally 
exploding in their eagerness to answer a question. Just as 
touching is the faith of the parents in their schools and in 
education generally. On more than one occasion, when they 
feared a curtailment of the programme, protesters among the 
refugees have used the slogan “take away our rations but 
give us the schools we need for our children”. The astonish- 
ing thing is that the people who coined this slogan and who 
use it really mean it.

MAGNA CUM LAUDE STUDENTS 
FROM- ARAB REFUGEE TENTS 
enrolled in two or three of the better-known 
universities of the Middle East were able to 
continue their studies with UNEsco aid. When 
UNRWA assumed financial responsibility for refugee 
students in 1953, it was decided to make free uni- 
versity study available to the deserving few on a 
percentage basis. It was calculated that five 
percent of the pupils graduating from UNRwa- 
UNEsco elementary schools could reasonably hope 
to receive a secondary education and that a further 
five percent of these should be given an opportunity 
of going on to the university. 
Last year some three hundred students were 
enrolled in the universities of Egypt, Syria and 
Lebanon as wards of the United Nations and next 
year - this figure is likely to rise to about three 
hundred and fifty. 
An unrwa scholarship candidate must not only 
have an above-average school record and continue 
to get above-average marks throughout his uni- 
versity career, he must also be someone who seems 
likely to attain real distinction in his chosen 
profession, and who will, in effect, be a future 
leader and mainstay in the whole community of 
Palestinian Arabs. 
Many Middle East universities, particularly in 
Egypt, remit all fees for students who consistently 
get very high marks. So every year uNRwa Uni- 
versity Scholarships Project funds receive an un- 
budgeted windfall of fees which its more disting- 
uished students do not have to pay. 
Selection also includes a very necessary means 
test. Funds provided by many nations for the 
rehabilitation of the Arab refugees from Palestine 
cannot in fairness be used to support a student at 
the university if that student's family can possibly 
find the money. All scholarship candidates must 
therefore be rationed refugees, and most of them 
come from the refugee camps where the economic 
level is little if anything above total indigence. 
.There is one further fence to jump before a 
candidate for an UNRwaA scholarship is finally 
selected. He or she must choose studies which are 
likely to lead to useful and remunerative employ- 
ment after graduation. Agriculture, Commerce, 
Public. Administration, Medicine, Dentistry, En- 
gineering .in all its branches, and, in the case of 
future teachers, the Arts and Sciences—these are 
courses of study that are likely to be approved. 
Once chosen, a refugee scholarship holder is 
transported free of charge to the university that 
has been selected, if necessary in the blue and white 
United Nations plane that usually carries uNrwa 
officials to and fro on their missions. His fees are 
paid, he receives the text-books and instruments he 
requires and an adequate, though spartan, allowance 
for board and lodging and other incidentals. This 
is, in fact, more than some of the countries in this 
area give their government-sponsored scholarship 
students. ' 
This summer the first substantial number of 
UNRwA aided Arab refugee scholarship holders 
graduated from universities in the Middle East. 
They come from the state-supported institutions in 
Cairo, Alexandria and Damascus, or from the French 
or American foundations in Egypt and Lebanon. 
These young men and women no longer sit in tents 
in grim refugee camps. They are alert and 
confident. They have mastered a calling and stand 
on the threshold of their professional careers. In 
the jargon of the relief specialists, they have been 
“rehabilitated” and will now be privileged to serve 
their fellow Arabs not only in the lands where their 
Palestinian brethren have taken refuge but 
throughout the Middle East.

CHINESE 
OPERA 
(Continued) 
  
  
of music, acrobatics 
and complex ballet 
N 1954, some fifty thousand people attended the 
performances given in Paris during the International 
Theatre Festival. Twelve countries took part and 
Parisians heard Norwegian, Serbo-Croat, German and 
Italian spoken in their theatres. This year’s festival 
brought twenty-eight foreign companies to Paris as well 
as thousands of people from all over Europe who flocked 
to see the performances which were given in half a 
dozen languages. The triumph of the 1955 Festival was 
further proof of the power of the theatre whose reality 
embraces and transcends language. Nowhere was this 
more evident than in the performance of the-Peking 
Opera. In the following article, Balwant Gargi relates 
the history and traditions of this classical Chinese 
Opera, whose mime, dancing and music were among 
the high points of the Paris Festival. 
6 RAVEL to China if you want wisdom” isan old 
| Arab saying. Explorers and travellers from 
Marco Polo’s times down to our own have 
journeyed to this mysterious land to discover this 
truth. For centuries it was the dragons, the 
enigmatic characters and ideographic script, the 
grotesque masks and costumes of their theatre, the 
strange and fantastic in Chinese art which fascinat- 
ed the Western mind. The depth and subtlety, the 
shimmer and transparent richness of the art lay 
hidden. Some Western critics and interpreters 
cultivated the idea that Chinese art was occult and 
unknowable. 
This myth of unknowability broke down when 
thousands poured into the Sarah Bernhardt Theatre 
during the recent presentation of Chinese Opera at 
the International Theatre Festival in Paris. The 
Opera drew people from all over Europe. Some flew 
from London to witness the spectacle. 
The classical Chinese Opera differs from the 
Occidental in many ways. Eastern music is not 
polyphonic in form. In Chinese music, as in Indian, 
strength and charm lie in subtle nuances and 
variations.on the same melody. It creates a mood, a 
feeling. 
It has not acquired the intricate design of Western 
harmony nor the pyramidal symphonic form with 
motifs embroidered, expanded and interwoven with 
many melodies, which tells a story and describes 
scenes. Eastern music does not have a descriptive 
language. It weaves a mosaic of sound within a 
shorter range; it is more intense than elastic, disci- 
plined by its form. 
Dance, on the other hand, in both India and China 
has a highly evolved language of gesture which can 
convey anything and everything. It is so perfect in 
mime that an expert in Kathakali dance (one of the 
four principal classical dance schools in India) can 
deliver even a highly political speech, so the Gurus 
(Hindu spiritual teachers )say. 
This intense development of mime in the Oriental 
dance sprang perhaps from the lack of descriptive 
quality in its music. Stylized dance gestures which 
describe songs must be exact and perfect. Dance, 
both classical and folk, has always been accompanied 
by vocal songs and percussion instruments. A song 
is a running commentary unfolding a story which is 
enacted in dance. Music and dance have walked 
hand in hand and given and taken much from each 
other. 
In Occidental opera and theatre, the recent trends 
to experiment in mixing songs and poetry with real- 
istic acting (in the manner of Berthold Brecht) and 
combining action and mime in operas (as in the 
Berlin Komike Opera) owe much to the Chinese. 
Chinese opera in its rudimentary form is over two 
thousand years old. In the eighth century small 
comic and satirical pieces on political personages 
and social life were knit together with songs. In the 
next four or five hundred years a fuller and more 
complete operatic form became crystallized. Born 
in Peking, the seat of ancient kings and courts 
around which all the arts flourished, the Chinese 
opera assimilated the best traditions of theatre, 
music, modes of singing, mime and dance. In the 
19th century, artists like Tcheng Tchang-keng and 
Tan Sing-pei, and in our own times Mei Lang-fan 
and Tchou Sing-fan, by their brilliant performances 
have carried forward and contributed to the tra- 
dition. 
  
Chinese opera is a synthesis of dance, music and 
mime. 1t reveals the effect of concentration and 
stylizatiyn in gesture, retaining always the essentials 
of realism. The accompaniment by percussion in- 
struments underlines and reinforces the rhythm of 
the movements. 
In the Western theatre realistic sets and decor have 
taken the form of naturalistic photographic realism 
whose parallel we find in 19th century painting. 
Chinese theatre does away with most of the decor. 
The Indian folk theatre and the classical Chinese 
theatre and opera do not strive to give an illusion of 
reality. They break the “illusion of reality” and 
create, in turn, a world of their own. The Chinese 
opera player like the Kathakali dancer in India 
through pure gesture creates palaces, chariots, 
horses, rivers, forests, streets, boats, cars, ,s 
light and darkness—everything required (Cont'd on

Masks and costumes are designed to express 
particular characters. Different colours signify 
different people. Style of beard, cut of moustache, 
colour, angle of the eye, curves and lines of make- 
up and dress, have meaning. The flapping and 
fluttering of long open double sleeves, which 
unsophisticated audiences in the West may ignore 
as the natural flourish of the costume, is in fact a 
highly skilled manipulation by the actor. The 
dropping of the sleeve, the backward and forward 
toss, the ripple and tremor, circling and billow, all 
denote a change of mood. These conventions and 
their symbolic significance are known to all 
Chinese audiences as opera has been a popular 
medium since its inception. 
In the Chinese Opera I saw in Paris at the Sarah 
Bernhardt Theatre the performance was not one 
continuous operatic drama but a series of cameos 
ranging from pure mime and dance to pure music

The first episode was “The Meeting of the Three”, 
an adaptation of a popular 14th century romance.

slandered and menaced him, is staying at an inn. 
A young knight and the innkeeper, both would-be 
protectors of the general, are unknown to each 
other and suspect each other. 
At night the innkeeper steals into the knight's 
room to take away his sword. In imagined pitch 
darkness the knight and the innkeeper, straining 
their eyes to pierce the gloom, search and grope for 
each other with drawn swords. In this atmosphere 
of fear and suspicion a ferocious duel begins. 
Sabres slash the air and the perilous triple jumps

accepted, provisionally, because nothing better was available. 
In making their selection, the experts appointed by the 
International Council of Museums are guided by three main 
criteria—the fidelity of the reproduction, the significance of 
the artist, and the importance of the original painting— 
among which a compromise of some kind has often to be 
made. The purpose of these catalogues, however, apart from 
encouraging the distribution of the best available reproduc- 
tions, is also to secure a steady improvement in their quality 
and to co-ordinate their production. 
The welcome these catalogues have received from teachers, 
students and art lovers of all kinds is sufficient proof of their 
usefulness. But they are perhaps most valuable to art pub- 
lishers themselves, because they indicate both the trend of 
taste and the gaps that have to be filled. The latest volume, 
for instance, includes a further thirty-six artists and among 
these are numbered such important names as Soutine, Ensor, 
Macke and Villon. 
  
best colour reproductions available today 
Other artists, hitherto insufficiently represented, are now 
better served, both as regards the quality of the original and 
the fidelity of the reproduction. In this way, each new edi- 
tion of the catalogue marks an appreciable advance on the 
previous edition and represents a closer approximation to 
the ideal catalogue in which the only thing that mattered 
would be the choice of the artists and their works. If a 
catalogue such as this could be developed to its limits, we 
should have the “imaginary museum” of Malraux in which 
each one of us hangs his own selection of pictures. 
The universal popularity of colour reproduction means, 
therefore, that it must be given a responsible place in our 
artistic culture. Although too many attempts at reproduction 
are disappointing or meretricious, it ‘would be foolish to 
condemn the principle or to deny its importance. It is more to 
the purpose to assess from time to time what has been achiev- 
ed on the credit side, and this is ‘what Unesco is trying to do.

and, above all, the higher standards demanded by the pu- 
blic, as they become more and more familiar ‘with museums 
and exhibitions, are bound to result in constant improve- 
ment. 
Some of the reproductions seem already to be of sufficient 
merit to win the approval of the artists themselves, who are 
ready to sign them as a token not only of the technical fide- 
lity of the reproduction, but also of its skill in recapturing the 
very spirit of the original. Spiritual affinity of this kind - 
between the original and the reproduction cannot be achiev- 
ed automatically, as is commonly believed, by purely mecha- 
nical means, It calls for the hand of a skilful craftsman 
constantly improving on his work by reference to the original, 
and himself enough of an artist to experience the vision of 
another as though it were his own, and sufficiently patient 
and self-effacing to refrain from putting his own personal 
stamp on the finished work. This accounts for the rela- 
tively high cost of such outstandingly good reproductions, 
made by the pochoir process, and for the fact that there are 
so few of them. 
* 
HE classic methods of large-scale reproduction can, how- 
T ever, give very good results if we are more fully aware 
of their limitations and their possibilities. The exact 
reproduction of colour cannot in itself recapture the special 
atmosphere of a painting, which is due to the quality of its 
lighting and of the materials used and to its own inherent 
magic. Even though his style remains fundamentally the 
same, every artist changes his manner, and this difference 
of tone must be rendered by appropriate means. 
To take a very simple example, ‘while the precision and 
directness of letterpress may reproduce the firm accents of 
the early Monet, the velvety softness of offset will perhaps 
give a better rendering of the modulation of a late work like 
the Nymphéas, and the sonority of photogravure come clo- 
ser to the vibrant quality of the Argenteuil period. It is up 
to the publishers to discover, as one critic recently put it, “the 
 
Unesco Courier, — N° 7, — 1955 
process of colour reproduction best suited to a particular 
work of art”, and to unify and combine harmoniously the 
successive renderings of photographer, engraver and printer. 
The choice of inks and paper also plays a very subtle part. 
The successes achieved carry on the tradition of fine crafts- 
manship in the service of art. 
Modern paintings, with their pure, unequivocal colours 
and simple texture are easier subjects for reproduction than 
are old paintings, many of which are overlaid with varnishes 
and shrouded in intermediate greys and browns which are 
extremely difficult to render. In the last hundred years, 
painting has turned resolutely to colour. There is no doubt 
that black-and-white photography, however perfect it may 
be, can no longer give us the essence of an Impressionist or 
- Fauvist painting, and still less of an abstract painting. 
Colour reproductions help not only to spread a know- 
ledge of modern art but also to make it better understood 
and to assist its development. By freeing us from the 
traditional prejudices of subject and form, which have been 
given spurious credit by line-engraving and monochrome 
photography, they help us to a better appreciation, in 
painting, of the old chromatic harmony cultivated by certain 
masters and certain schools and so long belittled for the 
sake of an exclusive concentration on line, composition, 
relief, and other values often having nothing to do with 
painting pure and simple. The development of colour 
reproduction also accounts for the present renaissance of 
such powerful forms of art as stained glass and mosaic 
work, and of forms so rich in influence as miniature paint- 
ing. We are returning to a civilization full of colour. 
One comment already made deserves repetition. The 
artists reproduced in colour are not academic painters but 
the great creative geniuses of our time. The list of 
distinguished names in this catalogue is striking evidence 
both of the enlightened judgment of the experts and of 
the spontaneous preferences of the public. In 
spite of those who disparage modern art, and (Cont'd on

working, there is general agreement on a small and signifi- 
cant selection of modern masters. The reproductions dis- 
carded are generally laid aside because of their own defects, 
and seldom because of shortcomings in the original, for aca- 
demic artists, even if they enjoy very powerful backing, rarely 
find publishing firms willing to take the risk of reproducing 
their work in colour. 
There are now enough good colour reproductions available 
for Unesco to contemplate organizing travelling exhibitions 
in the near future to illustrate a given period, country, or 
artist, or a particular theme. There is no need to dwell 
on the educational value of collections of this kind since, 
with masterpieces scattered all over the world, as they are 
today, it is hardly possible to arrange comparable exhibi- 
tions of the originals, even in the most favoured centres. 
By means of colour reproductions, the highest expressions 
of art can be brought, in a form approximating very closely 
to the original, into schools and factories, and to remote 
communities or isolated homes where people do not yet enjoy 
direct access to museums, exhibitions or private collections. 
For connoisseurs, art-lovers and artists, these repro- 
“ductions now provide the kind of introduction and training 
once given by the engravings which had such a vogue both 
north and south of the Alps from the late: fifteenth century 
onwards, or by the countless copies of miniatures that 
circulated both in the Orient and in the West throughout 
the Middle Ages. Every age creates, out of reproductions, 
its own fill of “imaginary museums”, while, alongside, spring 
up the ever new and ever unpredictable original masterpieces 
of the creative artist.

### 69019: Chinese opera

CHINESE 
OPERA 
(Cont’d from 
page 20) 
and miraculously miss each other every 
time, the adversaries pant like two 
blood-thirsty leopards, first making you 
gasp and in the next moment roar 
with laughter. 
The laughter is released not from 
comic facial contortions but springs out 
of impossible situations, fantastic pos- 
tures and the superb orchestration of 
the actors who perform a breathtaking 
and precise acrobatic ballet. 
The choreography which makes one’s 
head spin in its complex patterns has 
been evolved through hundreds of years 
of tradition and training, has been 
worked by ancient masters, perfected 
and matured: through the ages. The 
performances do not seem to have 
been rehearsed in theatre halls at 
scheduled times but through centuries, 
through generations. 
I do not know any theatre which 
requires less knowledge of the spoken 
word than the Chinese opera. In 
“The River” we vividly see the old 
boatman tie his boat to the bank, walk 
through the mud and help the young 
girl to embark. The wobbling of the 
boat and the swaying of the girl as the 
boatman rows her across the deep 
waters seem absolutely real, 
Product of time’s crucible 
N the butterfly dance the acrobatic 
feats of the players form a pattern 
of colours and singing lines of 
human limbs, Women and men in 
bright costumes jump and somersault 
and look like bufterflies skimming and 
kissing each other in the air, In its 
presentation this piece is nearer to the 
Western concept of ballet, 
The simplification of form in Chinese 
opera does not arise out of a primitive 
or naive folk quality but from a highly 
evolved technique, the product of 
centuries of strenuous search. This art 
simmered and bubbled in the crucible 
of time and in the process all super- 
fluity has been shed. Its simplicity has 
the conscious master’s hand behind it, 
the craftsmanship of the super-painter 
who with a few strokes of his brush 
sketches a human figure, a scene of 
battle or a running horse. 
In the creation of new opera China 
has borrowed much from the West. 
“The White Haired Girl” and “The 
Butterflies” and the more recent operas 
are a blend of Western realism with 
native traditions, using harmonic music 
patterns and symphonic orchestration 
as a background to solo musie. 
China has much to offer Western 
opera which today seems to be at a 
stalemate so far as form is concerned. 
This exchange of cultures is a unique 
bhenomena of our times when coun- 
tries like the members of one family 
come together with their different 
languages, songs, costumes and dances. 
They have much to give and take from 
each other and thereby enrich world 
culture which is a heritage of all 
humanity. (Photos Pic, Paris.)

Sir, 
I have been reading with interest 
your issue No. 4/5 1954 concerning 
Japan today. Your articles show 
the high standard of progress that 
country has made in such a very 
short time and the interesting 
fusion of western materialism ‘with 
Oriental philosophy that exists 
there. I think it would be a pity 
if, in the attempt to raise the 
standards of the “backward” peo- 
ples of the world, the Western 
powers were to impose not only the 
advantages of their standards upon 
the less fortunate, but also the 
disadvantages. It seems to me that 
the article giving the view of 
Japanese youth could be very well 
taken to heart by the “Ijin” (for- 
eigner). You list six points of 
criticism of the Western way of life 
by the Japanese youth and it 
appears to me that they do in the 
main strike well and truly home. 
This would seem to be just cause 
for us to stop and consider that 
when ‘we try and aid the Asians 
and Africans to reach a higher 
standard of living, we should do so 
through their eyes, not just through 
our own. We should remember 
that what is ultimately desirable 
for us may be quite despicable to 
them. We should only help them 
as far as we can when it is compat- 
ible with their ideals, not with our 
own. We can easily measure ma- 
terial wealth but it is very difficult 
for us to say that, just because we 
are materially stronger than they 
are, then we are also spiritually 
stronger, 
One example of the apparent 
superiority of the outlook of those 
we are supposed to be helping is 
the strength of the family ties in 
Japan. I venture to suggest that if 
such ties were still in existence in 
the Western World then such 
undesirable features of our civili- 
zation as the high divorce rates, 
juvenile delinquency, and the 
abandoned condition of many of 
the aged would not exist to the 
extent that they do today. Your 
apology in the following issue 
(No. 6, 1954, “The American Negro”) 
for the racial and other discrimina- 
tion that exists in the United 
States, materially the richest of 
nations in the world today, may be 
quoted as an example of what we 
should avoid. 
I would also like to point out that 
in your issue prior to the one 
devoted to Japanese youth (No. 3, 
1954, “Freedom of Information”) 
you publish figures that show 
Japanese-language daily newspaper 
circulation as being second only to 
English-language circulation. Sure- 
ly this would indicate that there 
Letters to the editor... 
would be a ready market for a 
Japanese language edition of the 
Courier, particularly since you state 
in the following issue that the 
Japanese in general are anxious to 
learn about other peoples. Or is it 
that your activities are restricted 
to member countries? If so there 
would appear to be little hope for a 
universal understanding of each 
other’s problems and ambitions if 
only one half of the world is 
allowed to see and hear those 
problems and ambitions. Incident- 
ally, I notice also that German- 
language dailies have a greater 
circulation than either French or 
Spanish. 
In the matter of explaining 
ourselves to each other, I feel that 
it is only by so doing that we can 
prevent our leaders from leading 
us into another dreadful slaughter 
that is so wasteful of human life 
and effort. Indeed, may I make 
this a plea to Unesco to try to 
break down the barriers to such an 
understanding that exist between 
the political “East” and the political 
“West”, and present to each the 
true picture of what we are and 
what we seek. Surely both sides 
are subjected to such a barrage of 
propaganda and half-truths that it 
is only a very distorted and 
emotional picture that exists at 
present. 
Certainly it can be said that if 
we cannot live together in peace 
we shall die together in futile 
strife and the slow and gradual 
progress of centuries will be lost 
for the average man. We have so 
obviously reached the stage when 
there is no advantage for either 
side in pursuing their selfish ends 
by force when both victors and 
vanquished are losers and the 
common man becomes a slave 
either to the politics of one side 
or the economics of the other. 
Each of the major wars of this 
century has brought increasing 
restrictions upon the freedom and 
liberty of the private individual in 
order to protect “States”. Surely 
it is time that men grew up and 
realized that States consist of the 
individuals that reside therein 
and although school-boys squabble, 
grown men learn to tolerate each 
other. -

Fo centuries ago the hunger 
for gold and the promise of 
great riches helped to speed fleets of 
galleons to the conquest and coloniz- 
ation of the New World and lured ad- 
venturers on astounding expeditions. 
Today, a strange counterpart of this 
age-old lust for gold can be found in 
the “Iron Hunt” of primitive tribes. The 
thirst for iron is so strong that it gov- 
erns all dealings between the tribes 
and white men who hold this “precious” 
metal. 
It is difficult to realize what iron 
means in the lives of primitive peoples 
unless we stop to think of the way men 
lived and worked in the distant Stone 
Age. And yet in New Guinea and 
Brazil there are still many tribes which

These tribes farm the tropical jungle

Every two or three years a tribe has 
to hack a new clearing out of the jun-

not easy to clear a jungle with a stone 
axe which pounds and tears much more 
than it actually cuts. Long, hard days 
are needed for the job. 
A simple iron hatchet can do the 
same work with almost magical speed.

tribe, grown bigger and stronger, will be 
held in respect by its neighbours, and 
thus threats to its existence will be re- 
moved. An Indian can visualize this 
chain of cause and effect as he tries a 
steel axe on a tree trunk for the first 
time. 
In the plains of the Amazon basin the 
fame of the “precious metal” spreads 
among the tribes long before the white 
man ever makes an appearance. Tiny 
bits of iron passed from hand to hand 
have gone right into the very heart of 
the South American continent. When 
agents of Brazil's Indian Protection 
Service made their first contacts with 
hostile tribes in Central Brazil, they

### 69025: Jungle Indians with an axe to grind, as an anthropologist sees it

were astounded to find the tribesmen 
using steel tools they had acquired by 
barter or as war booty. For the past 
four centuries, attacks by tribesmen on 
white men have often had no other 
motive than the desire for iron. Official 
reports of such attacks nearly always 
reveal that the tribesmen carried off all 
objects made of iron, but left those 
made of other materials untouched. 
Stone Age twilight 
the use of iron soon finds himself 
under a tyranny from which he 
cannot escape : once he is familiar 
with metal he can no longer return to 
his Stone Age. For iron, many a tribe 
has sacrificed its freedom—and even 
Its existence. 
When the Jesuits peacefully subdued 
hundreds of thousands of Indians, the 
only arm they used was the lure of iron. 
The promise of a steady supply of axes 
and knives was enough to persuade a 
belligerent people to accept the author- 
ity of the “black robes”, And many 
tribes have waged merciless war on 
each other simply to capture the slaves 
they needed to barter for metal tools. 
- Even today, the Indian Protection Ser- 
vice in Brazil wins over hostile tribes 
by placing hatchets, scissors and ma- 
chetes in their area. 
TT primitive man who discovers 
A report on Brazil's Indian assimil- 
ation policy written for Unesco by Dr. 
Darcy Ribeiro of the Indian Protection 
Service (See UNEsco COURIER, n° 8/9, 
1954) tells of some of the dramatic 
moments marking the twilight of the 
Stone Age. We are inclined to forget 
that the Stone Age which began thous- 
ands of years ago has survived down to 
the Atomic Age, and is now finally 
disappearing. 
A clean-cut trai ] 
IME of these stories suggest how 
S our own ancestors must have felt 
when traders from the East 
brought them their first metal axes. 
Here is a story told to an Indian 
Protection Service Agent by the 
Xokleng Indians of Southern Brazil, a 
few years after their pacification : 
One day, as some of the tribe's war- 
riors were moving through the jungle, 
they came across a trail quite different 
from the one they themselves were 
making by painfully twisting and 
breaking the branches in their way. On 
both sides of this trail, branches lay on 
the ground, cut off cleanly by some 
unknown instrument, The Indians, 
puzzled by this mystery, decided to 
follow the strange trail. 
A little further on, they found 
something that surprised them even 
more. A huge tree had been chopped 
down and its stump showed a clean, 
flat surface. Now they felt both fear 
and astonishment, but they continued 
on the trail. Soon they found some- 
thing else mysterious : foot-prints 
which had certainly not been made by 
any animal they had ever come across. 
Night was falling as they stealthily 
came to a clearing where a ‘white “hut” 
stood. Around the “hut” were strange 
human beings with white skins, unlike 
any men they had ever seen. The In- 
dians, a warlike tribe, decided to attack 
at dawn, but their impatience and curi- 
osity got the better of them. Before 
dawn came they had massacred all the 
white men. Groping through the tent 
they began to hunt for the cutting

tools whose powers they had admired. 
They collected the axes and imme- 
diately began to try them out. 
The next morning, they undressed 
the bodies of their victims to examine 
them more closely and then crushed 
their skulls to prevent them from com- 
ing back to life. Then, ignoring any 
other booty in the “hut”, they left with 
their knives and hatchets. On the way 
home, they kept on trying out the 
hatchets. 
They couldn't believe their eyes : the 
instruments cut wood without any 
effort at all. Now that they owned 
them, they would become the masters 
of the jungle. Back in their own vil- 
lage, the warriors told the story of their 
discovery and their victory. More bands 
set out along the same path in the hope 
Unesco Courier. — N* 7. — 1955 
of finding more of those strange beings 
who possessed the cutting instruments. 
But the Indians who had taken the 
axes did not keep them for very long. 
Other fribes ambushed them, seized 
their iron weapons and left them dead 
or wounded. In the months and the 
years that followed, more whites were 
massacred, but many Indians were 
killed by the little thunderclaps that 
the whites held in their hands. Not 
only was war waged on the ‘whites, but 
the lust for iron led to incessant tribal 
wars among the Indians. When the 
Indian Protection Service left a heap of 
iron objects near the Parintintins one 
day to lure them, the Indians simulated 
an attack to make themselves believe 
that they had won them by conquest. 
In the end tribes no longer sought 
iron and steel because of their useful- 
ness. Their possession became a matter 
of prestige. When the Chikrin Indians 
were pacified, they were willing to obey 
the law—in exchange for scissors. And 
they kept on demanding them until 
they now own more scissors per head 
than any other community in the 
world. 
 
This is the [irst of a series of articles on 
anthropological questions by Alfred Metrauxz, 
noted social anthropologist. In our next issue 
Dr Metraux will describe how a steel axe 
changed the lives of an Ausiralian aboriginal 
community.

“To have a single book for the school was a 
fuxury. When we didn’t have a blackboard, 
we used to draw our illustrations on the 
mud floor.” That is how Korean teachers 
describe - the difficult war-time and early 
post-war conditions in their schools. Today, 
however, a steady stream of textboqiss is 
flowing back into Korean schools from the 
new National Textbook Printing Plant (left) 
now in production at Yong Dong Po, near 
Seoul. The plant was built through the 
combined efforts of the United Nations 
Korean Reconstruction Agency (UNKRA), 
"UNESCO and the Republic of Korea Govern- 
ment. Geared to produce thirty million 
textbooks a year, the printing, stitching and 
packing equipment (below, left and centre) 
is the most modern obtainable. Between 
September 1954, when the plant opened, 
and March 1955, 12,000,000 books were 
produced. In Pusan, South Korea’s main 
supply port, UNKRA is helping thousands of 
sick people by providing equipment and sup- 
plies for the clinic operated by the Mary 
Knoll Sisters, This has enabled the clinic 
to give orthopaedic treatment to children 
suffering from tuberculosis of the bone and 
poliomyelitis. Long before daybreak, patients 
pack the courtyard and alleyway leading to 
the clinic waiting their turn for examination 
and treatment. Photos (right) show a father 
explaining the nature of his child’s illness 
to one of the sisters, and another sister taking 
blood count of young orphan, one of many 
thousands treated at the clinic. (U.N, photos)

Schools spark village 
progress in Philippines 
Since 1 948 a national movement has developed to link Philippine schools 
with their communities. Classroom programmes are related to needs 
and resources of communities, and schools also conduct adult education 
activities and carry out projects aimed at general community develop- 
ment. A training centre has been set up at Bayambang as a joint 
undertaking of the Philippines Government and UNESCO. A team 
of UNESCO technical assistance speciaiists is working with the 
centre, which is part of a system of international and national train- 
ing centres set up to produce first, leaders and teachers, and 
second, teaching materials for fundamental education. The compre- 
hensive ten weeks’ course makes use of audio-visual instruction, 
group discussions and field work in selected villages. Experiments 
are also carried out with new teaching methods and revised 
curricula, Photos on this page of the training centre in action show :

Destructive man 
The results of man's abuse and destruction of 
nature's resources were graphically illustrated 
at a recent exhibition organized at the Paris 
Natural History Museum, with the support 
of Unesco and the International Union for 
the Protection of Nature. Entitled “Man 
Against Nature”, the exhibition offered many 
examples of the destruction by man of the 
delicate balance that exists between soil, 
vegetation and fauna. It showed, for example, 
that uncontrolled deforestation can cause 
erosion which results in the devastation of 
whole areas, and that the use of insecticides 
may destroy useful insects along with parasites, 
After the exhibition closes in September, the 
section devoted to the disturbance of natural 
balance will form an independent exhibit which 
the International Union for the Protection of 
Nature will offer to members wishing to 
circulate it in their country, Above, right, an 
exhibition panel showing the balance of natural 
elements that thoughtless interference can 
destroy, and, left, young visitors learn that 
the ferocious leopard helps to protect agri- 
culture by destroying baboons and wild pigs 
which eat up the vegetation. (Unesco photos)

Budding artists 
of far-off lands 
Many Parisians have recently been visiting an 
art exhibition in Unesco House where paintings 
by children from France's overseas territories 
have been on view. Chief among the visitors 
to admire the talents of these budding artists, 
aged between seven and | 5, was Madame René 
Coty, wife of the President of the French 
Republic, who met and chatted with some 
young citlzens of France's African territories 
(left). Prizes are being awarded to the three 
best paintings entered from each of the 
overseas territories. (Unesco photo)

From the Unesco Newsroom 
S EVENTY - FOURTH 
STATE: Ethiopia has become 
Unesco's seventy-fourth mem- 
ber state. On July 1, the Ethio- 
pian Ambassador to the United 
Kingdom deposited his govern- 
ment’s acceptance of the Unesco 
Constitution at a ceremony in 
the Foreign Office in London, 
where the Constitution is de- 
posited. 
+ UNESCO ‘POCKET- 
BOOK’: The [first Unesco 
paper-bound pocket-size book 
jor mass distribution was 
published recently. The book 
is the English version of 
« Cultural Patterns and 
Technical Change”, prepar- 
ed by Unesco under the 
editorial supervision of the 
noted anthropologist, Mar- 
garet Mead. It reporls on 
the traditional way of life in 
the five ancient civilizations 
of Greece, Burma, Nigeria, 
the Palau Islands and among 
the Spanish Americans of 
New Mexico. And it features 
guiding principles on how to 
introduce modern technical 
improvements into such cul- 
tures without causing new 
social tensions. 
Mx WITH MISSIONS : 
Unesco recently sent out three 
more experts on new technical 
assistance missions, Professor 
Calamur Mahadevan, an Indian 
geologist, is now in Brazil to 
help survey mineral resources 
in the Amazon Valley. He is 
working with a UN. Food and 
Agriculture Organization team 
aiding the Brazilian Govern- 
ment to develop the Amazon 
region. An Australian geologist, 
Mr. E. J. Harrison, has gone 
to help the Egyptian Govern- 
ment in its search for under- 
ground water resources in the 
desert. A third expert on 
mission is Mr, A. G. Dickson, a 
British educator whom Unesco 
is sending to head a Unesco 
fundamental education team in 
Iraq. Mr. Dickson's mission 
follows three years of work by 
Iraqi educators and a Unesco 
team in the Dujailah region, 
where landless farmers have 
been settled on newly-irrigated 
land reclaimed from the desert. 
The plan now is to establish 
similar centres throughout Iraq 
to train local leaders of fun- 
damental education. : 
* PAYING FOR EDUCA- 
Educators from all 
parts of the world met 
recently in Geneva lo 
discuss one of education’s 
greatest difficulties—h ow 
to find the money to expand 
existing programmes and 
create new ones where they 
are urgently needed. The 
occasion was the Eighteenth 
Conference on Public Educa- 
tion, convened jointly by 
Unesco and the Interna- 
tional Bureau of Education. 
In previous years delegates 
have recommended action in 
such fields as compulsory 
education, on the access of 
women to education, and on 
the training of teachers. For 
this reason, this years 
session was concerned pri- 
marily with educational 
financing. Special studies 
prepared by Unesco and the 
1.B.E. were used as a basis 
Jor discussions. 
Works OF LEONAR- 
DO: The Leonardo da Vinci 
travelling exhibition prepared 
by Unesco has now toured 23 
countries. It is on show this 
year from June to the end of 
September at the historic Clos 
Lucé in Amboise, France, once 
a French royal domain, where 
Leonardo spent the last years 
of his life under the patronage 
of King Francis I. The French 
National Commission for Unes- 
co, which is sponsoring the Am- 
boise exhibit, has decided to 
make it a yearly event. Each 
summer the exhibition will re- 
turn to the Clos Lucé, in the 
heart of the Loire country 
which Leonardo loved so well. 
* EAST-WEST EXCHAN- 
GES : Historians and orien- 
talists studied way to broad- 
en the teaching of the hu- 
manities when they met re- 
cently al Unesco House in 
Paris, They discussed how 
to give greater attention to 
Oriental civilizations in 
Western teaching, and also 
how to improve the study of 
European humanities in 
Asian schools. Representa- 
tives from the major uni- 
versities of thirteen coun- 
tries — Ceylon, Denmark, 
Egypt, England, France, 
Germany, India, Iran, Italy, 
Japan, Mexico, Pakistan and 
the United States—attend- 
ed the meeting. 
T uEarrE OF THE NA- 
TIONS: Plans for the crea- 
tion of an international thea- 
tre in Paris are now within 
sight of achievement. The idea 
of setting up a theatre for re- 
gular performances by various 
national theatre groups has 
been considered by the Inter- 
national Theatre Institute for 
a number of years. Following 
two successful International 
Festivals of Dramatic Art held 
in Paris in 1954 and again this 
year (see page 18), the Institute 
has received the unanimous ap- 
proval of its twenty-three 
member nations, who met re- 
cently in Dubrovnik, Yugosla- 
via, for a Theatre of the Na- 
tions to be established in Paris. 
The French Government as well 
as the Paris municipal autho- 
rities will co-operate in the es- 
tablishment of the theatre. 
* AIRBORNE GEOGRAPHY 
LESSONS : Primary school 
pupils in Corbeil, near Paris 
recently had their first aeri- 
al geography lesson, With 
the help of the French Air 
Ministry and the Touring 
Club de France they [lew 
cver the Paris area in three 
aircraft. Their teacher pre- 
pared them in class before- 
hand for the trip and each 
pupil had a plan of the 
flight. For the five pupils 
who write the best account 
of their airborne lesson, the 
French Air Ministry has 
offered further flights this 
summer. 
ID irenninG HUMAN 
RIGHTS: The first internation- 
al authority with power to 
overrule certain national gov- 
ernments when human rights 
are infringed has now been 
created. Six countries, all mem- 
bers of the Council of Europe, 
have ratified the Council's “Eu- 
ropean Convention on Human 
Rights”, thereby agreeing to 
Article 25 of the Convention on 
the right to individual petition, 
Henceforth, any person or 
group who is a victim of per- 
secution in Belgium, Denmark, 
Iceland, Sweden and the Ger- 
man Federal Republic can now 
have his complaint investigated 
and his rights and liberties res- 
tored by the Council of Eur- 
ope’s Human Rights Commis- 
sion. This Commission will 
eventually be replaced by a 
European Supranational Court 
of Human Rights. 
C OUNTRY TEACHER 
CLASSES : In Bogota, Colom- 
bia, an ambitious programme to 
train rural school teachers has 
been launched under the direc- 
tion of a graduate of Unesco’s 
Regional Fundamental Educa- 
tion Centre for Latin America, 
located in Patzcuaro, Mexico. 
Trainees in Colombia will spe- 
cialize in nutrition, domestic 
science, arts and crafts and in 
teaching recreational activities. 
Colombia's Agricultural Credit 
Union is donating houses to 
forty families of workers who 
will assist the training program- 
me. Students were selected 
from villages across the coun- 
try, with the understanding 
that they will teach in their 
home towns on graduation. 
* CERN’S FIRST STONE: 
The foundation stone of the 
headquarters of the Euro- 
pean Organization for Nu- 
clear Research (CERN) was 
laid recently at Meyrin, 
near Geneva. Among those 
who attended the ceremony 
were M. Mar Petitpierre, 
President of the Swiss Con- 
federation, and Dr. Luther 
Evans, Director-General of 
Unesco. The idea of a Eur- 
opean scientific laboratory 
where scientists from differ- 
ent nations could collabor- 
ate in nuclear research 
projects too costly to be 
carried out in individual 
countries, was first broached 
in 1949 and taken up by the 
Unesco General Conference 
in 1950. In 1951 plans for 
the setting up of a European 
organization were drawn up 
by Unesco with the help of 
experts from eight countries, 
The Swiss Government pro- 
vided the site for the labora- 
tory, and last September 
the agreement came into 
jorce signed by eight coun- 
tries. All the research car- 
ried out at Meyrin will be 
Jundamentally scientific and 
of a mon-military character. 
None of the work will be se- 
cret, It will provide scien- 
tists with invaluable means 
of investigating the structure 
of matier,

Sabres slash the air as two characters in a Chinese opera duel in 
imaginary pitch darkness. The perilous triple jumps of the 
duellers and their hairbreadth escapes are full of both suspense 
and comedy. This is a scene from a recent Peking Opera per- 
formance in Paris, which revealed to the West an almost un-
