### 31776: Ibn Khaldun, man of history

IBN KHALDUN 
MAN OF HISTORY 
A universal history of the world written six centuries ago by 
Ibn Khaldun establishes this great Arab scholar as the first 
person to treat history as the proper object of a special 
science. The story of this forerunner of the modern historian, 
presented below, includes a recently-discovered account in 
Ibn Khaldun's own words of his memorable meeting with 
  
Tamerlane the Conqueror. 
H E opened his eyes on a life 
of culture and elegance, 
where fountains played in sunny court- 
yards, where books and music and 
quiet meditation divided the time with 
exciting and often dangerous affairs 
of state. 
His family, which originated in the 
Hadramaut in Southern Arabia, had 
emigrated from there to Spain in the 
eighth century, during the early years 
of the Moslem conquest. By the elev- 
enth century they had become the 
intellectual and political leaders of the 
city of Seville. But before the middle 
of the thirteenth century and in time to 
escape the Christian reconquest of the 
town, these proud patricians crossed 
over into Northwest Africa, where 
influential friends and relations soon 
helped them to establish new positions 
of wealth and honour. 
In order to understand the world 
into which Ibn Khaldun was born, and 
which he spent his life studying and

analysing, we need to take a general 
look at a period of history too often 
neglected, and remind ourselves of 
what Arab civilization as a whole, as 
well as Ibn Khaldun in particular, con- 
tributed to the sum of human know- 
ledge. 
After the founding of Islam by the 
Prophet Mohammed around 630, the 
new civilization rapidly spread out- 
wards from Arabia its centre until by 
the middle of the tenth century, when 
it was at its zenith, it included by far 
the greater part of the inhabited world. 
To the west it took in Egypt and the 
entire North African coast, the islands 
of Sicily and Crete, and nearly all of 
Spain. To the north, Syria, Armenia 
and the south-east regions of the Cau- 
casus were under Islamic rule; then, 
further east, Mesopotamia, Iraq, Per- 
sia and Afghanistan, Transoxania and 
parts of India’s northern plains. 
Both the cultural and geograph- 
ical horizons of Europe were boun- 
ded in nearly all directions by Islam, 
which enjoyed the summit of its pros- 
perity at the time when the civilization 
of the West slumbered in its deepest 
darkness. 
By the twelfth century the decline 
of the medieval Islam had set in, and 
in Ibn Khaldun’s lifetime it presented

IBN KHALDUN (Continued) 
Unable to keep out of hot water 
a spectacle which while still splendid 
was fatally touched by disintegration. 
But in the years of its greatness it not 
only kept alight and handed on the 
torch of knowledge kindled by Greece, 
but also made valuable contributions 
of its own to human understanding and 
power. 
Navigation, commerce, architecture, 
together with nearly all the arts and 
crafts were cultivated, and their fruits 
and techniques handed on to the West. 
In science and philosophy, Arab 
thinkers first preserved what the 
Greeks had won, then in certain 
important, though mostly practical 
ways, developed and perfected it, 
thus acting as a necessary connect- 
ing link between ancient and modern. 
European interest in the works of 
Aristotle, for instance, was first 
awakened through acquaintance with 
Arabic thought. 
The Arabs produced eminent schol- 
ars and practitioners in medicine, as- 
tronomy, physics and the natural 
sciences. They were the inventors 
of algebra and trigonometry, and they 
contributed much to the development 
of arithmetical calculation. 
The literary and purely intellectual

influences of Islam are harder to trace 
than the scientific ones, and here as 
in every field of Arabic studies much 
necessary material is lost or still 
unexplored. 
By the twelfth century the works of 
Arab scholars had begun to be trans- 
lated and accepted as authorities in 
the West—in Europe; and in the 
thirteenth century the Arab world and 
the West were intellectually much 
more closely aligned than they have 
ever been since. 
In the sixteenth century the revolu- 
tion brought about by Copernicus in 
astronomy, the reform of alchemy and 
medicine by Paracelsus, and the new 
anatomy of Vesalius struck great 
blows at traditional Arab erudition. 
Then when the Moors were defeated 
and the Moslem empire in Europe came 
to an end, all the eastern learning that 
had not already been assimilated was 
lost. 
But much had been assimilated, and 
Arabic no less than Hellenic lore con- 
tinued to be respected right down 
until both were crushed by the advent 
of modern scientific method. 
Of this method Ibn Khaldun, the 
first man to treat history as the proper

MEDIEVAL WORLD MAP. The “Mugaddimah” or “Prolegomena”, which Ibn 
Khaldun wrote as an introduction to his monumental history of the world, 
outlines and discusses contemporary ideas on geography that were based on 
a still scanty knowledge of the globe. Ibn Khaldun illustrated his geographical 
descriptions in the “Prolegomena” with this map of the world on which the 
south is at the top and the north at the bottom. “By turning it upside down 
one can pick out the outlines of Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, the Indian 
Ocean and the land masses of Europe and Asia in the northern hemisphere, 
object of a special science, was an 
amazingly early forerunner. How did 
he come to be so much ahead of his 
time? 
For an answer to this question we 
have to look at the circumstances of 
his life. 
When he was seventeen Khaldun 
lost both his parents and many of his 
teachers in the Black Death. Three 
years later he was given an important 
appointment at the court of the Hafsid 
rulers of Tunis, but he preferred to 
leave this and travel gradually west- 
ward across North Africa, pursuing his 
studies, and passing the years from 
1354 to 1363 at the Merinid court in 
Fez. The development of a Moslem 
scholar was regarded as a lifelong pro- 
cess, and the list Khaldun scrupu- 
lously gives of the men at whose feet 
he sat is a formidable one. But in 
giving the list he was also presenting 
his academic credentials, and these 
show that his interests were wide, 
not to say encyclopedic, rather than 
specialized. This is an important factor 
in relation to his life-work. 
North Africa was at this time divid- 
ed into three warring kingdoms, each 
of whose ruling dynasties was torn by 
internal dissension. It was here, taking 
an active part in politics, that Khaldun 
got most of his material for his theories 
about the rise and fall of nations. In 
such an atmosphere it was hard for 
someone like him to keep out of hot 
water. At one period he found himself 
on the wrong side and spent nearly 
two years in prison, and later he 
found it prudent to cross over into 
Spain, to Granada. But in 1365 he 
was back in North Africa, in Bougie, 
as Prime Minister. 
The nine years from 1365 onwards 
were the most precarious in all Khal- 
dun's hazardous career. It was no 
easy matter to be always on the right 
side in the complicated and fluid chaos 
that North Africa had become. Khal- 
dun's services as judge, civil servant 
and politician were always in demand, 
and all his attempts to escape to 
scholarly peace and quiet were foiled 
by suspicious rivals and demanding 
princes. Finally, however, he managed 
to get permission from the ruler of 
Tunis to install himself and his family 
in a secluded pavilion at Ibn Salamah 
in the province of Oran. Here he spent 
over three years in comfort and soli- 
tude, and started to write his great 
history of the world. 
“| completed the Introduction in the 
remarkable manner to which | was 
inspired by that retreat, with words 
and ideas pouring into my head like 
cream into a churn,” he recorded. 
It took him three more years, and 
the opportunity to consult the libraries 
in Tunis, before he completed his 
enormous work, and even after that he 
was always correcting it and bringing 
it up to date.

### 31776: Ibn Khaldun, man of history

IBN KHALDUN (Continued) 
Historian and conqueror face to face 
The first volume consists of the 
Muqgaddimah or Prolegomena, which is 
probably Khaldun's greatest claim to 
lasting fame, containing as it does the 
first real theory of history. Volumes [I 
to VII deal with the events of the pre- 
Islamic world and Arab and Eastern 
Moslem history.” But Volumes VIil and 
IX deal with the history of the Moslem 
West. Much of the material is based 
on first-hand knowledge, and it remains 
our most important source for North- 
west African and Berber history. 
In November or December 1378, 
Khaldun returned to his old home in 
Tunis where he taught, did research, 
and of course made both friends and 
enemies at court. In 1382 he thought 
it best to ask the ruler's permission to 
make the pilgrimage to Mecca, and 
sailed for Alexandria on October 24, 
leaving his family behind, perhaps as 
hostages. From this time on his only 
contacts with the West were by cor- 
respondence and through meetings 
with travellers. He reached Alexandria 
after more than forty days at sea, and 
after a few weeks moved south to 
Cairo where, apart from occasional 
travels in the Moslem world to the 
east, he spent the rest of his life. 
Egypt, ruled by the Mamelukes, was 
at this time the most stable and 
prosperous part of Islam. Khaldun 
was overwhelmed by the beauty of 
Cairo, with its colleges, mosques, 
crowded streets, and gardens that 
seemed to him like something out of 
paradise. 
He was soon ‘giving lectures at 
al-Azhar University and as soon as 
the post fell vacant the ruler Barglq 
appointed him professor of Malikite 
jurisprudence in the Qamhiyah College. 
Soon after he was also made chief 
Malikite judge of Egypt. (The Malikite 
rite was one of the four schools of 
Islamic law.) So there he was once 
again in positions of both prestige and 
power. 
In the year 1387 Khaldun went at 
last on his pilgrimage to Mecca, return- 
ing to new academic appointments and 
honours. In 1399 Barqlq died and was 
succeeded by his ten-year-old son. 
In 1400 Khaldun, as one of the four 
chief judges of Egypt, officially accom- 
panied the young prince Faraj to 
Damascus, making a detour on the way 
back to visit Jerusalem and Bethlehem 
and other holy cities, Moslem and 
Christian, as a pilgrim. Christ is of 
course regarded as a prophet by 
Moslems. 
By the autumn of the same year 
Timur—or, as we now call him, Tamer- 
lane, “Timur the lame"—was threaten- 
ing Syria with his cruel and all- 
conquering hordes of Tartars. Khaldun 
was obliged, much against his will, to 
bestir himself yet again and accom- 
pany Faraj as judge and counsellor on 
an expedition to relieve Damascus. A 
contemporary described this ineffec- 
tive force as “an army without a gen- 
eral and a general without an army.” 
There were various inconclusive 
engagements between the two forces 
in the country outside Damascus, but 
in the first week of the year 1401 came 
news of a threatened revolt back in 
Egypt, and Faraj returned home, leav- 
ing at Damascus Ibn Khaldun and 
others of his retinue to fend for them- 
selves and save the city if they could. 
These temporary residents of the 
city, together with the civilian authori- 
ties, decided to surrender, against the 
wishes of the military. Tamerlane 
knew of Khaldun's presence and 
expressed the desire to see him, so 
he was secretly lowered by ropes from 
the walls of the city and brought into 
the presence of the conqueror. 
Until a few years ago the only autho- 
rities for this fabulous encounter were 
various Arab historians of the fifteenth 
century, who all obviously embroidered 
such facts as were available to them. 
In all hitherto known manuscripts Khal- 
dun's own autobiography stopped in 
the year 1395. But less than twenty 
years ago three new manuscripts (the 
second and third are simply copies of 
the first), were found in Istanbul and 
Cairo. (The most important was anno- 
tated in Khaldun's own hand.) And 
they brought his story up to within a 
few months of his death. 
So now at last, after five and a half 
centuries of speculation, we have a 
detailed and verbatim account of one 
of history's most colourful meetings. 
A T the time of their conver- 
sations, which were spread 
out over January and February of 1401, 
Khaldun was nearly seventy and 
Tamerlane about five years younger. 
Khaldun was described by those 
who knew him as good-looking and 
attractive in manner, and this was 
confirmed by the speed with which he 
was always admitted to favour wher- 
ever he went. Tamerlane, according 
to an Arab chronicler, was “tall in stat- 
ure, with a large brow and a great 
head, and very strong. His complexion 
was white mixed with red; he was 
broad-shouldered, had thick fingers, a 
flowing beard, was paralysed in one 
hand and lame in his right leg. He 
had brilliant eyes, a loud voice, and 
was fearless of death. He reached 
the age of eighty in full enjoyment of 
his senses and strength.” 
They were a well-matched pair who 
lost no time in sizing one another 
up. Although Khaldun as a historian 
was certainly intrigued to meet so 
outstanding a maker of history, his 
chief concern was to extricate himself 
and his colleagues from Tamerlane's 
clutches and get safely back to Egypt. 
Tamerlane, on the other hand, knew 
that Khaldun was the greatest living 
expert on the Maghreb (this is to say, 
the Western Islam from Tripoli to Gran- 
ada), and was anxious for military 
reasons to attach him to his intelli- 
gence services. 
Let Khaldun now take up the story 
in his own words, from the moment 
of his first arrival in Tamerlane's 
reception tent: 
When my name was announced he 
summoned me and as | entered the 
audience tent he was reclining on his 
elbow while platters of food were 
passing before him, which he sent out 
one after the other to groups of Mon- 
gols sitting in circles in front of his 
tent. Upon entering | spoke first: 
Peace be with you—and | made a 
gesture of humility. Thereupon he 
raised his head and stretched out his 
hand to me, which | kissed. He made 
a sign to me to sit down. | did so just 
where | was, and he summoned from 
his retinue one of the erudite Harrafito 
jurists whom he bade sit there also 
to serve as interpreter between us. 
Tamerlane got straight to the point 
by asking Khaldun questions about the 
Maghreb, which Khaldun skillfully 
evaded. They fenced for some time, 
then Tamerlane got tired of beating 
about the bush. 
— | am not satisfied, he declared. 
| should like you to write down for me 
a description of the whole country of 
the Maghreb, treating all its features 
in such a way as | might seem actually 
to see it. 
Bowls of rishta—a sort of macaroni 
in soup—were then brought in. Khal- 
dun took some and did it justice, and 
this seemed to go down very well 
with his host. 
But soon they both fell silent. Khal- 
dun couldn't help thinking of what his 
fate would be if he made a wrong 
move. 
At this moment news came that the 
city gates had been opened and the 
civil authorities were coming out to 
surrender. 
Tamerlane appeared to be having 
trouble with the lame knee which had 
been wounded by an arrow in his 
youth, and so was carried out, with 
bands playing “until the air shook with 
them," and rode off towards Damascus. 
Khaldun duly set about writing his 
account of the Maghreb. He was left 
unmolested, although around him the 
city was being sacked and burned. 
The paper written and handed over, 
Tamerlane treated Khaldun with 
various marks of respect, asking him 
to give his opinion on legal matters, 
for example. But they still had not 
got round to the vital question of 
whether the scholar was to be allowed 
to return home to his studies. 
Khaldun decided he had better take 
the bull by the horns—but as tactfully 
as possible.

what may solace me in my exile. 
— Speak. Whatever you desire | 
shall do for you. 
— What do | desire? My state of 
exile has made me forget what | 
desire. Perhaps you—may Allah aid 
you—will know for me what | desire. 
— Move from the city of the camp 
and stay with me, and if Allah wills | 
will fulfil your highest aim. 
For the moment Khaldun had to be 
content with this ambiguous sug- 
gestion. However, on the strength of it 
he did succeed in getting a safe- 
conduct for the Egyptian officials who 
had been left behind in Damascus. 
But left alone Tamerlane seems 
to have reconciled himself to the idea 
of letting Khaldun go, and the next 
time they met he let this become 
apparent, somewhat wistfully, though 
characteristically he cut his losses in 
a very novel way. He asked Khaldun: 
— You have a mule here? 
— A mule? Yes. 
— Is it a good one? 
— Yes. 
— Will you sell it? 
— Sell it? 
— | would buy it from you. 
— May Allah aid you—one like me 
does not sell to one like you. But] 
would offer it to you in homage. 
— | meant only that | would requite 
you for your generosity. 
— Is there any generosity left 
beyond what you have already shown 
me? 
— He was silent, writes Khaldun; so 
was I. The mule was brought to him, 
and | did not see it again. 
— Are you going to travel to Cairo? 
asked Tamerlane. 
Khaldun answered, delighted and 
surprised, but still nervous. 
— May Allah aid you—indeed my 
desire is only to serve you... If the 
journey would be in your service, 
surely. Otherwise | have no desire 
for it. 
— No, but you will return to your 
family and your people. 
Khaldun rounds off the story by tel- 
ling how he finally arrived back in 
Egypt. Soon after his return a messen- 
ger came with some money for the 
mule—not the full price, but the 
messenger swore that was all he 
was given. Khaldun warily asked the 
ruler of Egypt whether it was all right 
for him to take the money, and receiv- 
ing an affirmative answer, pocketed it 
with a sigh of relief at having got off 
so lightly. 
He lost no time in writing off to 
the Maghreb to tell about the infor- 
mation he had been forced to give, and 
to try to counteract any ill-effects this 
might have by giving his fellow- 
countrymen all the useful facts he 
could muster about Tamerlane. In 
fact Tamerlane never did attack North 
Africa. The rest of Khaldun's life was 
spent in study, writing and official 
duties. He died on March 17, 1406, 
and was buried in the Sufi cemetery 
outside the Nasr gate of Cairo. The 
site of his tomb is now unknown. 
In the centuries that followed, the 
influence of Khaldun's teaching grad- 
ually gathered momentum, though his 
name is not found mentioned outside 
the Islamic world until 1636. Until the 
beginning of the nineteenth century it

was the Ottoman Turks who showed 
the most constructive interest. Then 
European scholars began to discover 
in his work ideas hitherto considered 
to have been formulated more recently 
in the West. 
As far as we know Khaldun was 
the first historian ever to regard history 
not as a chronicle of more or less for- 
tuitous events, but as a continuous, 
collective and organic movement 
governed by hidden but discernible 
laws. Moreover he identified the 
science of history with the science of 
civilization as a whole, and realized 
that only a study of man in all his 
innumerable activities can reveal the 
true significance of so-called historical 
events, so that the study of those 
events may act as a practical guide 
to the statesman. 
So Khaldun, considering everything 
as a function of man and his social 
organization, takes all knowledge as 
his province, and re-evaluates every 
aspect of the highly developed civili- 
zation in which he lived. 
The element of intellectual orthodoxy 
from which he could hardly be expect- 
ed to escape only serves to emphasize 
the real originality and breadth of his 
mind. Picturesque and touching as it 
-is, then, it is no wonder that Professor 
Arnold Toynbee, one of the most cele- 
brated historians of our own day, cites 
this fourteenth-century Arab as the 
inspiration of his own monumental 
work, and salutes Ibn Khaldun as the 
founder of the science of history. 
  
    
In 1362 Ibn Khaldun left Fez and went to the court of the King of Castille 
as ambassador of the Sultan of Granada. On his return 
the sultan rewarded him with lands and a palace in Granada.

Rugged landscape of Adi Arkai (north-west Ethiopia) strikingly illustrates 
the effects of subsidences in the earth’s crust that have made the great rift valleys 
which cleave East Africa from Zambia to the Red Sea. 
CRACKS IN A CONTINENT 
by Brian H. Baker 
HE rift valleys which trav- 
erse a large part of east- 
ern Africa, and the high plateaux and 
volcanic mountains which are associat- 
ed with the valleys, are some of the 
most beautiful and interesting parts of 
the continent. 
The floor of the rift valley is often 
occupied by lakes, and the higher 
parts of the surrounding plateau are 
the sites of intensive agriculture, while 
the high volcanic mountains are cover- 
ed with forests. It is the rift valleys

logical Department of Kenya's Ministry of 
Natural Resources and Wildlife, in Nairobi,

African Rifts of the Upper Mantle Project of

and the associated uplifted plateaux 
and high volcanoes that provide much 
of the scenic variety in East Africa, 
and incidentally provide the basis for 
much of the agriculture, forestry and 
other industries. 
The system of African rift valleys 
extends from Zambia through eastern 
Africa to the Red Sea, and continues 
northwards as far as Syria. This zone 
of fractures in the earth's crust is ap- 
proximately 8,000 kilometres (5,000 
miles) long, and represents one of 
the world's major structural features. 
The rift valleys in Africa are now 
known to be connected in some way 
at the south end of the Red Sea with 
the even more extensive mid-ocean 
ridges which encircle the globe. The 
recognition that the African rift sys- 
tem is the extension of the mid-ocean- 
ic ridge of the Indian Ocean, via 
the Gulf of Aden, means that the sys-

### 31939: Cracks in a continent; probing mysteries of the earth's crust in the rift valleys of Africa

Probing mysteries of the earth’s crust 
in the rift valleys of Africa 
tem is part of the world rift system 
(see the Unesco. Courier, October 
1963). 
. Although the rift valleys of the Afric- 
an continent are likely to differ in 
some respects from the equivalent 
structures which are so much more ex- 
tensive on the ocean floors, they are 
readily accessible for study, and pro- 
vide excellent opportunities for re- 
search into several fundamental proces- 
ses in the earth's crust, including vol- 
canic action and vertical tectonic 
movements. 
Now that the African rift system is 
seen to be part of a global structure 
—the most important structural feature 
of the earth's crust, in fact—its study 
has taken on a new significance. For 
example, if the continents have been 
drifting slowly apart during geological 
time, as some scientists believe, and 
if the mid-oceanic ridges are the zones

Titanic forces 
at work 400 
miles beneath us 
along which the rupture of the original 
super-continent took place, then the 
African rift system may be the early 
expression of the break-up of this 
continent. 
It is possible therefore that there is 
the opportunity in eastern Africa to 
study the early stages of continental 
fragmentation. In future geological 
ages parts of eastern Africa may be- 
come detached islands, like Madagas- 
car is at the present day. It should 
be emphasized, however, that this is 
likely to be a very slow process, which 
would take many millions of years to 
operate. 
Apart from the desirability of under- 
standing more fully the surface struc- 
ture of the African rift system and its 
connexion with the oceanic structures, 
there is also the question of causes. 
The major structural effects of the 
earth's crust—the long mountain ran- 
ges, the deep troughs filled with sedi- 
ments, the zones of fracturing and ver- 
tical movement—are caused by forces 
generated in the plastic sub-stratum 
called the upper mantle of the earth, 
which occurs to a depth of about 700 
kilometres (430 miles) beneath the 
thin, relatively rigid crust. 
It is possible to obtain a surprising 
amount of information concerning the 
nature of the upper mantle by indirect 
geophysical methods, and study of the 
differences between the upper mantle 
in the zone of African rifts and else- 
where would provide information to 
help to understand the development 
of the crust of earth and the role of 
the upper mantle in its evolution. 
The African rift valleys consist of 
a variety of structures, most of which 
are well preserved on the surface of 
the earth, since they were formed in 
comparatively recent geological peri- 
ods, mostly, within the last 20 million 
years. Typically the valleys are 
troughlike subsidences of the earth's 
crust about 50 kilometres (30 miles) 
wide, varying from about a hundred 
metres to 1,500 metres (a few hundred 
to 5,000 ft.) in depth. In the northern 
part of the rift system the valleys tra- 
verse broad volcanic highland areas 
such as the Kenya and Ethiopia high- 
lands, which rise to levels of over 
3,000 metres (10,000 feet). 
The sides of the valley are steep 
rocky escarpments, sometimes a 
single high escarpment, or a series of 
step-like escarpments descending to 
the valley floor. The floor of the valley 
may be cut up into a large number of 
narrow blocks, with many small escarp- 
ments, as if the floor of the valley had

The expedition which explored Niragongo set 
up its camp on the higher of two terraces 
which overlook the central well of the crater. 
This terrace is surmounted by a vertical wall 
180 metres (600 ft.) high (above). Two hundred 
metres (650 ft.) below this terrace a narrow 
platform encircles the vast molten lava lake 
(right). This great expanse of molten rock, 
sometimes calm and sometimes whipped into 
whirlpools and fountains of lava, awed even 
the most experienced members of the party.

The only lake of permanently molten 
lava in the world is the deep Nira- 
gongo crater, a volcano situated to 
the north of Lake Kivu (Democratic 
Republic of the Congo). In this area 
alone there are eight active vol- 
canoes. Their presence and the exis- 
tence of a zone of earthquake activ- 
ity show that further movement and 
volcanic activity can be expected 
along the great African rift valleys. 
The 1,100-metre (3,600 ft.) wide Nira- 
gongo crater is difficult of access,

and Japanese geophysicists and vol- 
canologists. Right, Haroun Tazieff,

Geyser power and minerals in plenty 
broken into narrow strips along vertical 
fractures. In some places the valley 
is occupied by large volcanoes, lakes, 
or spreads of lake sediment. In the 
Red Sea sector the valley is under- 
water. 
The highlands adjacent to the rift 
valleys are commonly broad plateaux 
areas composed of lava, but high 
ranges like the Ruwenzori mcuntains 
of Western Uganda, and the Cheran- 
gani range of Kenya are blocks of 
ancient rocks which have been pushed 
up to heights in excess of 4,300 metres 
and 3,400 metres (14,000 and 11,000 
feet) respectively during the formation 
of the rift valley. Other high mountains, 
which occur mainly on the flanks of 
the valley, are the great volcanoes 
such as Kilimanjaro (5,800 metres; 
19,300 ft), Mt. Kenya (5,200 metres; 
17,050 ft.), and Mt. Elgon (4,300 metres; 
14,100 ft.), and the Aberdare Range 
(4,000 metres; 13,100 ft.). 
It can be deduced that the original 
land surface has been lowered to 
below sea-level in the lower parts of 
the rift valleys, and the total relative 
displacement reaches to between 
3,000-4,500 metres (10,000-15,000 feet) 
in some areas. 
Broadly, the movements of the 
earth's crust during the formation of 
the rift valleys were a general bulging 
or up-lifting of wide areas, with the 
rift valley traversing the up-lifted areas 
= SUE ORE 
as a strip of country which appears to 
have collapsed (or been dragged 
downwards) in relation to the general 
rise of the area. While the movements 
were in progress massive volcanic 
action took place in several areas, and 
continued almost to the present day. 
The existence of a zone of earth- 
quake activity along the rift valleys 
shows that the rifts are still active, 
and the widespread occurrence of very 
young volcanoes indicate that further 
movement and volcanic activity can be 
expected at any time. 
In recognition of the importance of 
studying the African rift system in 
greater detail, a number of scientists 
met last year in Nairobi, Kenya, under 
the auspices of the International Upper 
Mantle Project and Unesco (1), to 
consider how to co-operate in further 
research. Scientists from several Afri- 
can countries agreed to take part in a 
programme aimed at producing an up- 
to-date account of the geology and 
geophysics of the rift system, and also 
to stimulate new research. 
Subsequently the Upper Mantle 
Committee of the International Union 
of Geodesy and Geophysics establish- 
  
(1) The 34 scientists who took part came 
from Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Uganda, 
Sudan, Tanzania, Zambia, U.S.A., Japan, 
U.S.S.R., Belgium, and U.K. 
    
  
ed a Commission on the World Rift 
System, and the group concerned 
with the African rifts became one of 
its .subcommissions. The first steps 
towards a programme of co-operation 
in geology and geophysics for the 
study of this most interesting feature of 
the African continent have been taken. 
Already some research is in progress, 
and other projects are being planned. 
The existing knowledge of the Afri- 
can rift valleys shows that study of 
this structure is of more than purely 
academic interest. Associated with the 
rift system are a number of bodies of 
igneous rock derived from great depths 
which contain valuable metals such as 
columbium and the rare earths, which 
are of increasing importance in modern 
technology. 
As a result of the internal drainage 
of the rift valleys and of their volcanic 
activity there are great saline accumu- 
lations such as the sodium carbonate 
and sodium chloride (salt) deposits of 
lakes Magadi and Natron, on the 
borders of Tanzania and Kenya, and 
the potash deposits of the Afar 
depression in Ethiopia. These deposits 
are among the largest in the world 
of these substances. 
As a result of the very recent volca- 
nic activity in parts of the rift system 
there are areas in which ground- 
water is heated. These geothermal 
areas contain numerous hot springs,

geysers, steam jets and gas jets, and it 
is possible that geothermal steam or 
gas can be tapped in some of these 
areas as a means of generating elec- 
tricity. Some preliminary investiga- 
tions of this possibility have already 
been carried out in Uganda and Kenya, 
and these potential energy sources 
are of great interest because the 
cost of electricity generated from 
geothermal steam is normally less than 
that from conventional fuels. 
Although there have been few de- 
structive earthquakes in the rift zone, 
it is recognized that there is a poten- 
tial hazard from earth tremors (2). 
Studies of the nature and distribu- 
tion of the earthquake activity are indi- 
cated to determine the areas likely 
to be affected. It is also desirable 
to establish codes of building con- 
struction that will minimize damage in 
the event of destructive earthquakes 
taking place. 
It is very encouraging that scientists 
in some African countries can partici- 
pate in the International Upper Mantle 
Project, and that they are contributing 
to the solution of one of the major 
problems of the nature and develop- 
ment of the earth’s crust.

Aves a town on the 
Caspian Sea, in northern 
Iran, has long been a centre for traffic 
in artefacts of inestimable archaeolog- 
ical value plundered from sites in the 
highlands of the Elborz mountains. 
Objects in pottery and bronze, silver 
and gold, stealthily excavated and 
taken to Amlash, have found ready 
buyers among antique dealers, and 
have later been resold in Teheran, 
Iran's capital, and abroad. This illegal 
trading in cultural treasures has been 
going on for so long and has reached 
such proportions that merchandise of 
this kind is now called “Amlash.” 
Iran's archaeological authorities, 
anxious to put a stop to this illegal and 
harmful traffic, decided that a neces- 
sary first step would be to carry out a 
thorough archaelogical survey. As 
part of a survey of the entire country, 
work was begun late in 1961 in the 
Rahmatabad of Rudbar area of the 
province of Gilan, We chose this 
area because we knew it was one of 
great potential archaeological wealth,

but about which little was definitely 
known. It was thus that we brought 
to light historical remains of the long- 
forgotten Kingdom of Marlik, dating 
back over 3,000 years. 
After several weeks, during which 
we investigated many ancient mounds 
and dug test trenches in those which 
did not have sufficient surface remains 
for identification, we entered the Gohar 
Rud Valley, a rich green land of rice 
paddies and wheat fields, dotted with 
groves of olive and wild pomegranate 
trees. There, on a barren, rocky hill- 
side called Marlik tepe (or Cheragh-Ali 
tepe, after its last owner) we dug ano- 
ther test trench, the twelfth of our 
survey. 
The trench yielded, among other 
objects, two small bronze figurines of 
cows, two cylinder seals and fourteen 
gold buttons. A thorough excavation 
of the tepe was started and gradually 
we came to realize that what appeared 
to be simply a natural hill was a burial 
ground containing a fabulous treasure 
—the royal cemetery of Marlik. 
In all 53 tombs were uncovered, dug 
into the crest of Marlik tepe by a 
people who had inhabited the sur- 
rounding territory for several hundred 
years during the late second and 
early first millenium B.C. These tombs 
constituted the only archaeological 
layer on the hill. Nothing lay above 
or below except for a few miscella- 
neous objects near the surface.

The people who built these tombs 
simply dug a hole, cleared the earth 
away from the bedrock and construct- 
ed the tomb walls of broken stone and 
mud mortar, incorporating the bedrock 
wherever possible. Any spaces left 
outside the walls were filled with dirt 
and rubble, After the body had been 
placed in the tomb with the accompany- 
ing funerary objects, it was covered 
with a brownish-red earth different 
from the natural soil of the mound. 
Yellowish stones, again different from 
the natural stone of the site, were 
placed irregularly over the burial 
chamber after it was filled. 
Thus, when we reached such a heap 
of stone, we knew a tomb lay beneath, 
and when we struck the brownish-red 
earth, the funerary objects were close 
at hand. 
A bewildering variety of objects had 
been placed in these roughly construct- 
ed tombs—from simple domestic uten- 
sils to elaborate ceremonial vessels. 
There were also decorative and ritual 
figurines, bronze weapons, personal 
jewellery, pottery of all kinds, pieces 
of textiles, cylinder and stamp seals, 
toys and gaming pieces, small models 
of various tools, and beautifully decor- 
ated bronze, silver and gold bowls.

A LOST KINGDOM (Continued) 
Far left, bronze figurine 
of crouching leopard 
(12 em.; 5 in.) found in 
what was probably the tomb 
of a famous hunter. 
Centre, bronze figurine of a 
mountain goat with 
crescent horns and human feet 
mounted on three bronze 
rods (22 em.; 9 in). 
Left, grey pottery vase with long 
spout shaped in the form of a 
crane's neck and head 
(25 cm.; 10 in). 
Animal grace and vigour caught in clay 
often decorated with impressed de- 
signs around the neck, shoulder or 
handle. One beautifully proportioned 
vase reproduces the graceful curve 
of a crane’s head and neck, a bird still 
seen in the region. A motif based on 
the wild pomegranate is common. 
The pottery animal figurines have a 
modern air because of their simple 
abstract shapes, and in addition they 
were functional, being for the most 
part hollow with the muzzles formed 
into a spout. Animals predominate, 
but there is also a charioteer, naked 
with a hugh sword at his waist, who 
stands between a team of horses, the 
whole mounted on four wheels. 
Several other objects on wheels may 
have been children’s toys. 
The pottery figurines representing 
human beings are notably cruder than 
the animal figurines, having flattened 
and distorted faces. 
Animals were also depicted in 
bronze, but in greater numbers are 
the many weapons fashioned from this 
metal—spears, daggers, arrowheads, 
swords and maceheads. Among the 
replicas of tools and equipment are 
three models of hump-backed oxen 
with yoke and plough. 
The variety and artistry of the jewel- 
lery and decorative objects is extra- 
ordinary. A beautiful gold bracelet 
has spiral butterfly beads and a pome- 
granate pendant. Among the pen- 
dants is a cage decorated with gran- 
ulation, a double-headed eagle and 
a disk decorated with an abstract 
design. 
The most magnificent of the objects 
found at Marlik are the gold ritual 
vessels—masterpieces of the gold- 
smith's art. One small gold cup de- 
picts mountain goats at rest with their 
legs tucked under their bodies in the 
Scythian fashion. On two small gold 
bowls, decorated with eagles and 
rams, the heads of the creatures pro- 
ject from the body of the bowl in full 
relief, one of the special techniques 
perfected by the Marlik goldsmiths. 
Unicorns, griffons and winged bulls 
are repeated motifs—all ancient sym- 
bols of the Middle East, and developed 
in a distinctive fashion by the master 
artists of Marlik. 
On one tall gold beaker the life 
story of a mountain goat is portrayed. 
Four rows of decorations, in which the 
same motif is repeated around the 
body of the beaker, show a young kid 
being suckled by its mother, a young 
goat standing on its hind legs and 
eating from the Tree of Life, wild boars 
—apparently the enemy of the goat— 
and finally the carcass of the goat from 
which two large vultures are plucking 
the entrails, 
A magnificent gold bowl, which we 
have called “The Marlik Bowl", is 
decorated with two pairs of winged 
bulls standing on each side of the tree 
of life. Their bodies are in profile and 
their heads in full relief, projecting out- 
ward from the body of the bowl almost 
two centimetres. The power and 
strength of the winged bull is beauti- 
fully expressed here in figurines full 
of vitality and life. This bowl is decor- 
ated on the bottom with a rosette, as 
are most of the Marlik gold bowls. 
Here the rosette represents the sun 
surrounded by the leaves of the Tree 
of Life. 
We still have much to learn about 
the Marlik people—who they were, 
where they came from, where they 
went after the destruction of their 
kingdom. It is apparent that Marlik 
was the royal cemetery of a people 
who controlled extensive areas of 
northern and northwestern Iran 3,000 
years ago. Their art clearly influenc- 
ed much vaster areas. The period of 
the Marlik kingdom seems to begin 
toward the end of the traditional 
Mitannian art period and to end before 
the formation of the New Assyrian and 
Median powers. The influence of the 
Marlik artists on Urartian, New Assy- 
rian, Median and Achaemenid art was 
extensive and long lasting. 
It seems probable that the Marlik 
people and their culture played a direct 
and major role in the formative stages 
of the later empires of the Medes and 
the Achaemenids.

### 32972: Why 1101=13: new approaches to mathematics teaching

New approaches to mathematics teaching 
WHY 1101 = 13 
Mathematics teaching is ceasing to be a series of formal and complicated 
drills through which children acquire the skills needed in solving exam- 
ination problems. Increasingly, teachers and educational researchers are 
evolving and testing a kind of teaching that eschews learning by rote. 
Experience with these new techniques shows that not only arithmetical 
operations, but also fundamental concepts of mathematics can be learned 
intelligently by young children of primary school age. Last January an 
international group of specialists met in the Unesco Institute for Education 
in Hamburg, Federal Republic of Germany, to examine the results of 
recent research into the learning of mathematics by children aged six to 12. 
Below, a member of this group, Nicole Picard, describes some of the class- 
room and curriculum innovations of this new approach to mathematics. 
] HE urgent need for a new 
approach to the teaching 
of mathematics has gradually become 
evident over the past ten years to 
those responsible for education. 
The advent of a scientific and tech- 
nical civilization and its gradual exten- 
sion throughout the world has brought 
far-reaching social changes, and in 
particular compulsory schooling. In 
the 1880s, education concerned chil- 
dren of six to ten years of age only; 
nowadays, in many countries that have 
reached a high degree of industrial 
development, it is compulsory for chil- 
dren of six to 14 or even 16. The basic 
objectives . of education have also 
changed and urgent educational prob- 
lems have arisen which now confront 
industrially-developed and developing 
countries alike. 
As long ago as 1912 the distinguish- 
ed British mathematician and philo- 
sopher Alfred North Whitehead wrote: 
“Before long science will be making 
spectacular new progress and for 
those who have not received an ade- 
quate education there will be no re- 
dress.” 
It is just as important to solve the 
problem of intellectual undernourish- 
ment as that of bodily undernourish- 
ment; indeed, it is only by solving the 
first problem that solutions will be 
found for the second. 
 
NICOLE PICARD js a specialist in research 
on mathematics teaching at the National 
Pedagogical Institute in Paris. She has 
written many studies on the introduction to 
mathematics in primary education. 
When the idea of compulsory school- 
ing began to develop and spread about 
1880, it was put into practice with great 
haste; everyone was to be taught to 
read, to write and spell correctly and 
to count, and the programmes were 
drawn up on that basis. In primary 
education mathematics was confined 
to the use of numbers. The pupil 
learned to do sums and solve arithmet- 
ical problems, but he was hardly ever 
called upon to use his judgment. Few 
children reached the stage where 
reflective thought is required, and 
those who did mostly came from the 
socially privileged classes. 
Gradually, advances were made in 
technology. The horse-drawn vehicle 
was replaced by the railway, the car 
and the aeroplane. Distances dimin- 
ished and contacts between different 
countries became easier. Nowadays 
networks for rapid communications 
cover the surface of the globe and 
even space itself has become a sphere 
of activity for man. Similarly, inform- 
ation is transmitted by more and 
more powerful means. The volume 
of knowledge within reach of each of 
us increases continuously; but in order 
to assimilate it, we need to develop 
faculties of reflective reasoning and 
critical appraisal. 
Today technological development 
and increasing automation are gra- 
dually eliminating the employment of 
unskilled labour. By 1970 nearly half 
the working population of the indus- 
trialized countries will be composed of 
middle-ranking technicians and super- 
by Nicole Picard 
visory staffs. At the same time the 
need for more higher-level tech- 
nicians and administrators is increas- 
ing. 
Reading, writing and arithmetic are a 
far from adequate stock-in-trade for 
making one's way in our twentieth- 
century world. A person who has not 
received more than that has been 
intellectually starved. 
The new patterns of economic 
growth and employment revealed the 
need to prolong compulsory schooling. 
The advantages of an educated com- 
munity, in terms of national economic 
progress, became apparent, and high- 
er education was therefore made 
accessible to an ever-larger number 
of students, especially those studying 
science and technology. 
At the same time the content of 
teaching and teaching methods and 
aids have been changed. In mathe- 
matics in particular, the reform be- 
gan at the top, in higher education. 
This was brought about by the vast 
accumulation of new scientific know- 
ledge which revised many basic scien- 
tific concepts. Mathematical research 
became the main instrument for this 
revision. 
In fact there should not be one kind 
of mathematics for school teaching and 
another for practical use. The basic 
core of mathematical reasoning and 
structures, together with their symbols, 
should be known to all. Detailed stud- 
ies should follow in mathematical re- 
search and in other scientific fields— 
physics and chemistry obviously, as

Replacing symbols, 
well as medicine and psychology. 
Mathematics is also being increasingly 
used for research in sociology and 
history. 
In the introductory teaching of 
mathematics, it is not just a matter of 
using the formulae of numerical calcu- 
lation or the spatial ideas of Euclid- 
ean geometry. What is applied now 
in any field of learning, when we are 
attempting to organize new facts, is 
the mathematical language of structure, 
relations, functions and symbols. 
This is sometimes called, “modern” 
mathematics. The new branch of math- 
ematics, concerned with theories of 
sets and relations, which 20 years ago 
was reserved for a small number of re- 
search specialists, has become, in the 
last ten years or so, a subject for 
higher mathematical education. This 
evolution in mathematical studies has 
forced a reform in the mathematics 
curriculum at various levels. 
However the introduction of the new 
mathematics created serious problems. 
Teachers noted that because what they 
were explaining was so completely 
new, their students were not able to 
take it in and benefit from it unless 
their minds were first “de-condition- 
jargon and routine 
ed.” They needed to acquire a new 
way of thinking; the old mathematical 
frame was much too compartmentaliz- 
ed. It was obvious that training along 
the new lines must begin at the secon- 
dary level (12 to 16 years of age). 
Several groups were therefore set 
up to study the reform of mathematics 
teaching at this level. An interesting 
fact was that the groups included 
educational psychologists, logicians 
and specialists on problems of learn- 
ing. 
One of the many working groups of 
this kind is the International Commis- 
sion for the Study and Improvement 
of Mathematics Teaching, which began 
its work in 1950. This group has used 
the method of international seminars: 
it has co-ordinated the work done in 
various places and has drawn up 
guidelines for further research. 
It was observed, in the first place, 
that the reform of mathematics teach- 
ing could not be achieved unless fit 
took root in the nursery school and 
extended to the university; secondly, 
that there was a very close connexion 
between initiation into mathematics and, 
the development of the faculty of rea- 
soning and intelligence; and lastly, that 
"ideas about mathematical 
the revised subject matter demanded 
new teaching methods. 
In countries where school attendance 
is compulsory up to at least 14, prim- 
ary education is designed to lay solid 
foundations on which to build second- 
ary education. Primary mathematical 
education should aim to provide a 
variety of experience. Concrete exam- 
ples should serve as the basis from 
which it will be possible effectively to 
abstract (in the etymological sense, to 
“draw from") and generalize math- 
ematical concepts. This should be pos- 
sible from the ages of 12 to 16. 
In this way children will have had five 
years of experience in formulating 
structures. 
This learning will build the foundations 
of their mathematical knowledge. 
Many programmes have been drawn 
up for this purpose. They differ in 
their approaches and also in the 
volume of their content. It seems clear 
now as a result of the work of child 
psychologists that from the age of 
seven, and not only from the age of 12 
as was formerly thought, children are 
in fact capable of something more than 
merely memorizing calculation drills 
and acquiring routine skills.

Right, the meaning 
of symbols. Exercises lead 
children from everyday 
things with which 
they are familiar to 
the abstract idea 
of numbers. 
They work first with elements 
that compose sets, then 
learn to recognize when 
sets have the same kind 
and number of elements. 
Association of equivalent 
sets then leads to the use 
of numerals to identify them,

that he has the right answer 
to the problem. 
  
  
In fact experience shows that from 
the age of seven children are capable 
of understanding mathematical shapes 
and sizes (provided they are suffi- 
ciently simple), and while playing with 
these concrete objects are able to 
deduce from the experience many 
mathematical relations. They can also 
solve practical problems, provided, of 
course, that the methods used are di- 
rectly related to their sense of manipu- 
lation and tactile skill. They should be 
given a variety of materials to enable 
them to manipulate various forms of 
mathematical structures. 
Of the methods used for the reform 
of mathematics education, those for 
arithmetic employ the most traditional 
approach. They consist in utilizing 
materials for manipulation that have 
the same structure as the ordinary 
numerical system. Instead of learning 
addition and multiplication tables by 
heart, children study addition and multi- 
plication by an ordered arrangement 
of concrete elements. 
Notable examples are the Cuisenaire 
rods and the blocks used by Catherine 
Stern. These were devised on the 
basis of the pioneering research of 
Maria Montessori. Arithmetical opera-

tions are represented by material 
arrangements to be performed by the 
children. Playing is, in itself, perform- 
ing an operation: the action of putting 
bars together in line with the ends 
touching one another corresponds to 
the operation of “addition.” Two bars 
a and b are equivalent to one bar ¢ 
which has the same length as that 
obtained by putting the bars a and b 
together end to end: 
[ o 
 
  
c | 
If we symbolize the placing end to 
end by +, we havea + b =c¢; b + 
a = ¢; in the same way that 2 + 3 = 
A similar procedure can be used for 
discovering the properties of the mul- 
tiplication of numbers. As a corollary, 
the fact that addition and subtraction 
are inverse operations can also be 
seen, as well as the relation between 
multiplication and division. These 
methods are in use in Belgium, Canada, 
the United Kingdom and Switzerland, 
and to some extent in France. 
Let us take a look at numeration by 
position. According to one of the 
known principles of the psychology of 
intelligence, a concept is assimilated 
_ better when all the possible compon- 
ents are made to vary. In the case 
of numeration by position, this means 
in particular that we must vary the 
bases. When we write a number, we 
make use of a sign-position. Thus, 
in order to write 1966, we use 
the numbers 1, 9 and 6; however, in the 
“word” 1966 the first and the second 
“6” do not have the same significance. 
Our sign - positions constitute an 
“alphabet,” the meaning of each sign 
depending upon its place in the word. 
If our alphabet has ten signs we are 
using a system of numbers “with the 
base ten,” if it has three signs, a 
system of numbers with the base three 
and so on. Electronic computers use 
the base two, the Babylonians used 
the base twelve, certain primitive peop- 
les use the base five. In teaching 
this implies that instead of speaking 
only of units, tens, hundreds, thou- 
sands, etc.,, we shall speak of suc- 
cessive groups, based on a certain 
method (a numeration with the base 
2, 3, or 5 for example, or of 10, as

CONCRETE 
STEPS 
TO 
ABSTRACT 
CONCEPTS 
As more purposeful mathematics 
teaching is introduced, children learn 
to count on other bases than that of 
the decimal system. Here a class 
learns how to calculate with a numbers 
system based on four. (1) The teach- 
er gives each child a cube and 
divides the class into groups of four. 
(2) She calls each group in turn, takes 
their four cubes and gives in exchange 
to the group leader a rod which is 
four times bigger than a cube. (3) Call- 
ing out four group leaders at a time, 
she exchanges their rods for a single 
block that is four times bigger than 
a rod (or sixteen times bigger than 
a cube). All the children participate 
in these successive collections and 
exchanges of objects whose relative 
sizes correspond to the number base 
being used. Experience shows that 
by their second year in primary school, 
children are able to add, subtract, 
multiply and divide on any number 
base. They have not been taught 
these operations by rote but have 
discovered them experimentally.

### 32972: Why 1101=13: new approaches to mathematics teaching

Children make their own discoveries 
in the case of the decimal system). 
From the time they begin to study 
numeration, children learn to count in 
terms of different bases: for this they 
use what are called Multibase Arith- 
metic Blocks. 
If we say that we have 1 3 2 1 
objects, that will mean that, 
M with the base four we have 1. 43 + 
3.4% 4 2.41 4 1.49 objects; 
MW with the base ten we have 1.103 + 
3.10% + 2.10! 4 1.10° objects, 
‘MW and with the base n (n > 4 as we 
have at least.the signs 0, 1, 2, 3), 
1.n® + 3.n%2 4+ 2.0! + 1.n° objects. 
In this equipment of blocks with 
base n, the power zero is represented 
by small cubes, the power one by a bar 
of n cubes, the power two by a plate of 
n bars of n cubes, the power three by 
a cube of n plates, the power four 
by a bar of n cubes of n plates, etc... 
so that our number 1 3 2 1 will be 
represented by the objects as follows: 
=" = © 
== 
=" 
In this way children are led to make 
successive groupings and exchanges, 
following a model which varies accord- 
ing to the base used, the exchanges 
being imposed by the fact that, for 
example with four as the base, four 
plates must always be put together 
to make a cube. 
From their second year of primary 
school, children are capable of per- 
forming the four arithmetical operations 
on any base. An interesting point is 
that the operational techniques are not 
learned, but discovered experimentally. 
As regards methods based on the 
notion of sets, these necessitate much 
more extensive changes in the pro- 
grammes than the previous method. 
They are based in particular on: (1) 
work involving the introduction of math- 
ematical logic; (2) work in the sphere 
of psychology, concerning the evolu- 
tion of the child's mental structure and 
his grasp of mathematical concepts. 
The methods have in fact a much 
wider and more ambitious aim than 
giving an understanding of mathema- 
tics. Experiments made in the past 
few years indicate that where these 
methods have been used there are no 
longer any pupils good at literary sub- 
jects who are bad at mathematics. 
These same methods, which are based 
on notions of sets, operations with 
  
     
sets, and the logic of sets, do indeed 
help to develop a child's intelligence, 
by helping to organize his reasoring 
abilities. Experiments in the use of 
such methods were started this year 
with mentally retarded children but the 
results have not yet been assessed. 
In these methods, an integral number 
is considered as a property of a set. 
The notions of set and property are 
thus fundamental ones, and the notion 
of number is built upon them. 
  
Two sets, A and B, have the same 
cardinal number (that is, the same num- 
ber of elements) when their elements 
can be put into one-to-one correspond- 
ence with each other. 
The two sets A and B have a com- 
mon property, namely that they each 
have four elements. 
As we have said, before even talk- 
ing of number the children “manipu- 
late” the notions of set and property. 
A set can be defined either in terms 
of its extension—by enumerating all 
its elements once and once only; or 
in terms of what it comprises—by 
defining the elements of the set by a 
common property characteristic of 
them (all the children in the class 
wearing a blue pullover for example). 
Two sets are equal if and only if they 
are composed of the same elements: 
thus, if A is the set of even numbers 
above 1 and below 10 and if B = (2, 
4, 6, 8), then A = B. 
Notions of the property of an object 
gradually lead to the notion of the 
property of a set. Operations with 
sets provide the introduction to opera- 
tions with numbers. In addition, the 
intuitive study of sets does not merely 
have the utilitarian purpose of introduc- 
ing the child to numbers, but gives 
him, at a very early age, an initiation 
into the logic essential to organized 
thought. 
Studies of the mental development 
of the child have shown that children 
of the same age differ vastly according 
to their social origin. Many children 
have not been able to get from their 
family background the cultural comple- 
ment necessary to the full flowering of 
their intelligence. The new teaching 
methods involve notions of sets, opera- 
WHY 1101 = 13 (Continued) 
tions with sets and also the fundamen- 
tal notions of relations that are 
indissolubly associated with them. 
They thus give children, from their 
nursery school days, habits of classific- 
ation, order and comparison. This 
offers each child the possibility of 
developing his own faculties to the 
maximum. 
In fact these methods are meant 
to be introduced at the nursery school 
stage in the form of games and mani- 
pulations. This has been done mainly 
in England, France, Belgium, Northern 
Europe and the U.S.A.

To keep their records of trade and gov- 
ernment administration the Egyptians need- 
ed large numbers 5,000 or more years ago. 
So they made up a set of numerals by 
which they could express numbers of dif- 
ferent values from units up to hundreds of 
thousands. Above, the number 27,529 as 
written by the early Egyptians. 
  
Among the oldest systems of numerals are 
those used by the Chinese, and later 
adopted by the Japanese. These have 
naturally changed somewhat in the course 
of the centuries. One type (shown above) 
is based on the use of sticks laid upon a 
table and used for calculating. 
used in written documents. 
The Sumerians of the Mesopotamian valley, 
over 3,000 years ago, had one system of 
calculating for everyday use and another

WHY 1101 = 13 (Continued) 
In mathematics, the notion of “rela- 
tions” cannot be dissociated from that 
of sets. A relation can be represented 
by a “diagram”. Thus, if we repre- 
sent by ——— the relation “having the 
same shape as” between cut-outs 
stuck onto a sheet of paper, we get the 
following “diagram”:

of six, children are capable of repre- 
    
BASE 2: 1101 = 13 
(1 xX2°) +(1x2%) + (0x2) +(1x2°)=13 
Notation on the decimal scale, which originated in the 
number of fingers on the hands, is by far the most widely 
used system. Certain peoples have made use of other 
~ notations, including one based on 20 (the Mayas) and 
the binary (using the base 2). Reference is made to the 
base 2 in a Chinese book believed to have been written 
about 3000 B.C. Paradoxically it is the system used 
by ultra-modern electronic computers. The binary scale 
employs only two symbols: 0 and 1 and the digits re- 
present powers of 2. Its importance is in relation to the 
use of perforated cards in computers. Since it has only 
two digits any number can be represented by a series 
of switches which are either “on” for. one or “off” for 
nought. The use of perforated cards dates back well 
over a century and a half when the French engineer, 
Joseph Jacquard, perfected an attachment for the power

the needles of the loom (left). Only the needles facing 
the holes are able to carry out the process of weaving. 
senting non-oriented relations (a dash 
instead of an arrow). Reflexivity (each 
element is of the same form as itself) 
as a concept is still too subtle for them, 
but at the age of eight it can be un- 
derstood without difficulty. 
The importance of “representations” 
(graphs, plans, diagrams, tables) is that 
they enable the child to express in 
pictures what he would be completely 
incapable of expressing in words. In 
schools where teaching methods based 
on representations of this kind have 
been tried out, it has been found that 
not only are the children capable from 
the age of six of making their own dia- 
grams; they also draw conclusions 
from them and thus make a first attempt 
at reasoning. This is interesting not 
only in pedagogy but also from the 
viewpoint of studying a child's way of 
thinking and powers of reasoning. 
The study of relations from earliest 
schooldays has been tried out in Bel- 
gium and France with very interesting 
results. 
A situation can easily be mathematic- 
ized if it can be expressed in a form 
directly accessible to logical reason- 
ing. This procedure has been tried 
out in the countries mentioned above 
and also in the U.S.S.R., where some 
interesting research has been done. 
Experience has shown that algebra 
can be introduced into the curriculum 
from the age of eight—provided that 
concrete materials which can be manip- 
ulated are used. In fact it makes 
possible a great saving of mental 
recapitulation. For the solution of 
problems traditionally set in the prim- 
ary school, children find it much easier

to use simple forms of algebra than 
the complicated arithmetic they are 
normally taught. 
It would obviously take too long to 
review all the research that is being 
done. Some relates to the introduc- 
tion of geometry (this is being studied 
especially in Belgium, Canada, Italy 
and the U.S.A.); another branch deals 
mainly with simple experiments in 
mechanics and physics. Research, in 
fact, is going on in a great many 
countries including Denmark, Norway, 
Poland, Hungary, to name only four. 
In the developing countries the 
problem of establishing a suitable sys- 
tem of education takes a different form, 
and is perhaps even more acute than 
in the industrialized countries. 
The most urgent question facing 
educational authorities in developing 
countries is the definition of the role

the 
x 
of education. Many of these countries 
now need to train a large number of 
teachers in the next few years. Un- 
doubtedly this will involve great diffi- 
culties, but paradoxically, these coun- 
tries have an advantage over the in- 
dustrialized countries. They have to 
train, not to re-train their teachers. 
They do not have to face the problem 
of “deconditioning” hundreds of thou- 
sands of teachers who have become 
used to rigid and stereotyped methods. 
The people responsible for education 
in these countries are generally very 
enthusiastic. They need to be given 
as much information as possible about 
the educational reforms we have been 
describing. This will ensure that from 
the outset the teaching of mathematics, 
which is also a factor in the develop- 
ment of intelligence, will become, not 
a conditioning to out-of-date techni- 
ques, but an opening of the mind and 
a development of aptitudes.

Moreover, as this new teaching 
proceeds on the experience of experi- 
ments with children, it can very well 
be adapted to different cultural back- 
grounds and related to the social 
context in which children and adults 
grow up. 
Similarly, the study of science can 
also be made relevant to the actual 
living conditions of a particular com- 
munity. In fact one can form math- 
ematical structures and relations by 
deriving them from the study of other 
ordinary elements of concrete objects. 
Source material for this can be select- 
ed from a number of simple, everyday 
experiences, 
When sociologists and ethnologists 
make their contribution to the already

can be expected.

Fair Play? Ky Ye 
Simply a question of honesty” tim, 
  
   
   
     
An athlete, a team of women gymnasts, a football referee and two football teams have 
been awarded the second annual International Fair Play Trophies (for 1965). These 
Unesco-sponsored awards are designed to honour men and women who place the I] . 
highest values on a spirit of sportsmanship, even at the cost of losing a contest. Eugenio i I 
Monti, the Italian bobsleigh champion, who received the first of these awards last | | | || 
year, affirmed that the International Fair Play Trophy would become “the world’s most | | | | 
coveted award.” The committee which designates the winners is composed of represen- a 
tatives of Unesco, of the International Sporting Press Association, of the International : 
Council of Physical Education and Sport and of leading international sports federations. 
On March 17, 1966, the latest winners of the Fair Play trophies were present at a cere- 
mony in Unesco House (right) to receive their awards from Mr. LE. Forbes, Unesco’s 
Assistant Director-General, in the presence of M. Francois Misoffe, French Minister of 
Youth and Sports and of M. Jean Borotra (standing), France’s veteran tennis champion, 
who heads the Fair Play Committee of the International Council for Education and Sport.

Flags of 40 nations flew over Dakar, 
Senegal, from March 30 to April 24, for 
the First World Festival of Negro Arts. 
More than a thousand performers took part 
in a programme which included displays 
of paintings, sculpture, literature, music 
and dancing. All Dakar's theatres and 
cinemas as well as its Parliament building 
were used for lectures and discussion 
groups, including a symposium on “the 
function and significance of Negro African 
art in popular culture,” held under the 
sponsorship of Unesco and the African 
Society of Culture.

and steam is used to curdle the protemn 
which can be filtered off through cloth. 
About 500 pounds of leaves can be pro-

experimentally in India, New Guinea, Jamai- 
ca and Uganda.

New technique for reading 
fire-damaged manuscripts 
Ancient papyri which have been so 
charred by fire as to be unreadable can 
now be deciphered thanks to a new tech- 
nique developed by Dr. Anton Fackelmann, 
restorer at the National Library of Vienna. 
He uses an electrically charged plate to 
remove a thin layer from the papyrus, thus 
rendering the writing visible. Dr. Fackel- 
mann also discovered how to unroll 
desiccated papyri by softening them with 
fresh papyrus sap. He also found the 
secret, lost in the Middle Ages, of making 
“Goldschlag parchment"—a very thin 
parchment treated with lime which was 
used to protect old papyrus from humidity. 
Radiation energy for 
heating and cooling 
Successful experiments in using solar 
radiation to heat houses and terrestrial 
radiation to produce spectacular drops in 
temperature are described in the Unesco 
quarterly “Impact” (Vol. XV, No 4, 1965; 
4/-; $0.75). They are reported by Professor 
Felix Trombe, director of the French solar 
energy laboratory at Montlous in the 
Pyrenees. At Montlouis prototype houses 
have been constructed to capture the sun's 
energy with built-in solar collectors and 
accumulator walls. These techniques have 
reduced the price of a solar kilowatt-hour 
to less than one-third of a U.S. cent. 
Professor Trombe writes: “House and water 
heating can be envisaged in cloudless 
countries where there are long periods 
of sunny cold weather... In warmer parts 
it is now possible to envisage applications 
of terrestial radiation that could improve 
living conditions and be used to preserve 
food.”

Shah's action follows the proposal he his country would be ready to repeat 
made to the Unesco-sponsored World its donation if there were a favourable 
Congress of Ministers of Education on response to the Shah’s appeal. Below 
the Eradication of Illiteracy, held in we publish the text of the Shah's letter 
Teheran last September, that all to Unesco: 
You will remember that at the opening of the World Congress of 
Ministers of Education on the Eradication of Illiteracy, | said that, as 
many of the countries afflicted by this scourge have insufficient financial 
resources, international solidarity can and must come into play. Speaking 
of the possible sources of finance, | added that it would perhaps not 
be so very fanciful to ask the governments of the world to devote a 
negligible proportion of their military budgets to this great work. | also 
said that so far as we were concerned, we had made a national effort 
of this sort by setting up the Education Corps, and that we were ready 
to extend our efforts internationally for the good of all peoples. 
| am now happy to tell you that as the Iranian year begins, with the 
budget just voted by Parliament, | have decided, in pursuance of the 
statement | made last September and of the recommendations of the 
Teheran Congress, to make available to Unesco the equivalent of one 
day's expenditure under our military budget, in order to assist in the 
struggle against illiteracy throughout the world. This represents a sum 
of about $700,000 drawn from the Iranian military budget for the year 1345 
(1966-1967). 
The eradication at the international level of the social evil of illiteracy 
naturally demands time and money on a far larger scale than that of 
my government's modest contribution. But it is to be hoped that this 
decision which, for a developing country like mine represents a real 
sacrifice, will be followed by many others and will perhaps enable Unesco 
to institute a special fund for carrying out an historic undertaking which 
is among those of greatest urgency for the economic, social and cultural 
development of mankind. i 
| am glad that the implementation of the recommendations of the Teheran 
Congress coincides, in 1966, with Unesco's twentieth anniversary that 
you will be celebrating in a few months’ time. [| take this opportunity 
of saying how heartily | desire that your Organization's efforts in the 
struggle against illiteracy, as in other important spheres of education, 
science and culture, may be crowned with success.

JUNIOR OLYMPICS 
 
Sir, 
1 am 14 years of age and an Aus- 
tralian. | know everyone enjoys and 
realizes the tremendous value of the 
modern Olympic Games. They must 
spread tremendous goodwill between 
the various competitors of different 
religions, races, colours and Ideol-

petitors are generally mature adults 
who have firm opinions on most things 
of Importance by the time they 
compete. Sometimes these opinions 
can be an obstacle to really close 
friendships with other people. 
My idea is that there should be a 
Junior Olympic Games with children 
from all the nations entered In the

way of promoting friendship, goodwill 
and physical fitness this would be. 
The Junior Games could be held every 
four years (as are the real Olympics) 
but in a different city. | think the 
idea has great possibilities and | wish 
someone could do something concrete 
about it. 
| came across the Courier in our 
local library. 1 find it very interesting 
and intend to take out a subscription.

THREE CHILDREN 
EVERY SECOND 
  
 
Sir, 
The Unesco Courier is one of the 
outstanding voices of our time—a his- 
toric time of integration for the human 
family, a kind of new Renaissance in 
which all social structures are undergo- 
ing constant and decisive changes. 
In this complex situation the popula- 
tion explosion has become Factor 
Number One, and your February 1966 
issue rightly emphasizes this, starting 
with the front cover which tells us 
that two babies are born into the 
world every second. 
This figure set me thinking. If we 
take 65 years as man's average 
lifespan, the annual global mortality 
rate is about 15.5 per thousand. This 
means that about 50 million of the 
world's 3,200 million inhabitants die 
each year. Since the total annual pop- 
ulation increase in the world is 60 mil- 
lion, the total annual number of births 
must be around 110 million. And since 
there are approximately 31 million 
seconds in one year it seems tc me 
that the correct figure must be 
3.5 babies born every second. Am | 
right? 
Alberto J. Scardiglia 
Cordoba, Argentina 
We agree with our reader that the 
figure of two children born every 
second is an overcautious estimate. 
Although global demographic figures 
are necessarily approximate (in many 
countries precise and up-to-date sta- 
tistics are still not available) it would 
no doubt be more realistic to consider 
three births a second as the world 
average. It is the actual population 
increase that has now reached the rate 
of two people a second—a yearly total 
of 60 million—Editor. 
THE OPPENHEIMER 
 
HOSPITAL 
Sir, 
I can confirm, as N. V. Baldwin 
states in the letter published in the 
December 1965 issue, that the picture 
shown on page 29 of the issue on 
Racialism (April 1965) is in fact the 
Oppenheimer Hospital at Welkom, 
some 185 miles from Johannesburg. 
My knowledge of this is that | 
designed and planned the new town 
of Welkom. 
In 1946 the late Sir Ernest Oppen- 
heimer commissioned me to design 
the new town of Welcom and his 
instructions were that it should be not 
only an example of Good New Town 
Development in South Africa, but 
throughout the world. 
The late Sir Ernest was very keen 
on the best conditions for all the 
inhabitants and desired to establish 
a permanent labour force for the gold 
mines, living in the town. 
In his effort to do this he endeav- 
oured to establish family life in the 
mining areas and the township for 
as many as possible of the permanent 
employees, instead of the normal 
migrant labour, which necessitated the 
men leaving their families.

YOUNG PEOPLE 
OF ISRAEL 
Sir, 
In your issue on Youth, bearing the 
symbol of International Co-operation 
Year, 1965, | was surprised that no 
mention was made of the young peo- 
ple of Israel. We have first-rate youth 
hostels; the international youth work- 
ers’ service is doing valuable work 
in our country; our “higher technical 
school” has a world-wide reputation; 
we have youth clubs; our young people 
have done all kinds of pioneering work 
and, like youngsters in other countries, 
they are fascinated by every aspect 
of science. They deserved at least a 
mention because of some special 
characteristics. Our young people 
are composed of disparate and 
complex elements not easily combin- 
ed into a single whole. They are the 
result of a distinctive mingling of 
different peoples; each has inherited 
characteristics of his country of origin, 
but all are determined to attain a new 
unity.
