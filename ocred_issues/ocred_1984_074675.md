HE calendar is to a large de- 
] gree a social convention, and 
each new year does not necess- 
arily usher in innovation and novelty. 
All the same, the beginning of the 
year, like the beginning of a decade or 
a century, provides a regular oppor- 
tunity to take stock, to test the pulse 
of humanity. 
At the beginning of 1984 we have 
chosen to examine three of the many 
questions which are preoccupying the 
human community: the effects of the 
economic crisis; the latest trends in 
psychological research; and the thrust 
+ of a criminality which seems generally 
to be rising. 
We invited two specialists to con- 
tribute to the debate on each of these 
issues, one from an industrialized 
country, one from a developing coun- 
try. This is not meant as an endorse- 
ment of one of the accepted ways of 
delineating the world today, but as an 
attempt to present a diversity of   
analytical viewpoints and processes 
and, perhaps, to reveal points of 
agreement which transcend the in- 
evitable divergences. : 
It goes without saying that we are 
not claiming in this number to cover 
the most important threats or pro- 
mises confronting ~~ humankind 
today—problems of hunger and 
health, knowledge for all, peace, 
justice, and harmony among peoples. 
The studies in this issue do, however, 
have roots in such problems and make 
it possible to explore their often hid- 
den complexities if not to propose 
potential solutions. 
Nor isitin accordance with conven- 
tion that we open this issue with an 
analysis of the case of George Orwell, 
which is being widely studied and 
questioned in this month of January 
1984. Over and above the political 
controversy or the so-called prophetic 
nature of the work, the question re- 
mains of man’s anxiety in face of his 
own ‘“‘modernity’’. Is it not. the 
machine-State more than the 
totalitarian State that is at issue here? 
And does not the reaction to such a 
danger of robotization lead man to 
fall prey, paradoxically, to attitudes 
that are regressive or invalid? - 
The sharpness of these debates 
should not obliterate our common 
hope, reaffirmed by the twenty- 
second session of Unesco’s General - 
Conference held at the Organiza- 
tion’s Paris Headquarters from 25 
October to 26 November 1983, The 
Unesco Courier presents its best 
wishes for 1984 to its readers and to 
all men and women of goodwill 
throughout the world.

### 58030: George Orwell, a 'Tory anarchist'

George Orwell, 
“Jory anarchist’ 
by Jacques Charpier 
author, or of the date of publication of a book, offers an 
opportunity to pay tribute to universal culture by lighting 
candles which in many cases shed only a brief flicker of light on a 
writer or his work. This year is somewhat different; it is itself the 
title of a book—George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four—which 
since it was published over thirty years ago has made its author 
world famous. 
thor, or the anniversary of the birth or death of an 
Orwell, whose real name was Eric Arthur Blair, was born at 
Motihari in Bengal on 25 June 1903. His father, Richard Walmesley 
Blair, was in the Opium Department of the Government of India. 
Eric’s family belonged to the outer reaches of the Establishment. 
His great grandfather (died 1820) had been a rich planter in 
Jamaica who had married into the aristocracy but had died a poor 
man, His youngest son, Eric’s grandfather, after briefly studying 
at Cambridge, was obliged through indigence to make a career in 
the Church of England. His son, Eric’s father, became a minor col- 
onial civil servant at the age of eighteen. Somewhat late in life he 
married Ida Mabel Limouzin, daughter of a French teak merchant 
and boatbuilder. Risky speculations in rice brought the Limouzins 
down in the world. This relative social decline may shed some light 
on the personality of the future author of Nineteen Eighty-Four 
and on a certain ambiguity that can be sensed in him. He said that 
he belonged to ‘‘the lower upper middle class®’. 
His parents’ relatively modest situation did not prevent them 
from sending him to Eton, where he studied Latin, Greek, 
mathematics and divinity, and rowed and played cricket. He seems 
to have been an average student, but he was already determined to 
become a ‘‘famous author’’. 
Like some of his fellow pupils, Eric displayed a certain refusal to 
conform. He read Bernard Shaw, H.G. Wells, and Galsworthy, 
and ‘‘loosely described myself as a Socialist’. One question in a 
general knowledge paper at school in 1920 was “Whom do you con- 
sider the ten greatest men now living?*’ Blair, like fifteen out of six- 
teen in the class, included Lenin in his list. Either because of his 
mediocrity as a student or, more likely, because of his family’s 
financial straits, he did not go on from Eton to Oxford. Instead, 
he became a trainee at the Burma Provincial Police Training School 
at Mandalay, graduating at the age of twenty-one as an Assistant 
Superintendent of Police in the British colonial administration. 
About the details of Blair’s life during his five years in Burma not 
much is known, but we do know that he was torn between two feel- 
ings: a certain distance from the colonialized peoples and a growing 
rejection of British imperialism and colonialism. His Burmese ex- 
perience was probably much more important than his unconven- 
tional reading at Eton as a source of his ‘‘socialism”’, and from it 
he developed his critique of imperialism and of capitalism in 
general. 
In 1927 Blair resigned. ‘I gave it up’’, he wrote later, ‘‘mainly 
because I could not go on any longer serving an imperialism which 
I had come to regard as very largely a racket’. 
JACQUES CHARPIER, French poet, essayist and radio producer, is 
literary director of a French publishing house. A former professor of 
French literature at Bryn Mawr College, Pennsylvania, he is the author 
of many articles and books, including Paysage du Salut, Le Fer et le 
Laurier, Paul Valéry, Villon and Saint-John Perse.

. Back in England, Eric Blair’s vocation to become a ‘‘famous 
author” took practical shape: he decided to start to write. An 
unusual period of his life now began. Even though he was in poor 
health, there was no question of living off his family. However, I 
do not think that it was for such simple and immediate moral 
reasons that he chose to live as a vagrant in Paris and London. In 
his first published book, Down and Out in Paris and London (when 
he adopted the pseudonym George Orwell), he stressed the literary 
nature of his work, and it is true that he published a number of ar- 
ticles at this period. He also refers to two novels which he claims 
to have written then, but all trace of them has disappeared. It is not 
impossible that his deliberate decision to live the life of a tramp was 
taken for other reasons. He was not, in the narrow sense of the 
term, politically minded. His unconventionality at Eton and his

Blair—was born at Motihari, in Bengal, 
on 25 June 1903. He is seen above, 
aged six weeks in the arms of his ayah

criticisms of British imperialism did not go far enough to mould his 
behaviour. On the other hand it cannot be ruled out that there were 
psychological impulses behind his excursions into vagabondage. He 
was aware of belonging to the ‘lower upper middle class’’ which 
was simultaneously linked to and excluded from the Establishment, 
conscious of its poverty yet remote from the “people”, stripped of 
its ancient privileges but still attached to certain traditions. Let us 
say that there was a “‘bourgeois’ streak in Eric Blair and also, 
possibly, some unconscious failing which had given rise to certain 
feelings of guilt. I would not go so far as to say that during the 
Down and Qut years Orwell was taking part in a play in which he

was both the actor and the only spectator, but it is not impossible 
that he had, in every respect, assumed a disguise. In one episode in 
Down and Out in Paris and London, he changes into the outfit of 
a “‘poor man” and recognizes that ‘“‘my new clothes had put me in- 
stantly into a new world’’, acting as a kind of passport from the 
universe of the bourgeoisie to that of the proletariat. And he is 
delighted when a hawker astonishingly addresses him as ‘“mate’’. 
Was Eric Blair looking for exotic social experiences which he 
could use for a literary purpose, or was he a guilt-ridden young 
member of the bourgeoisie searching for redemption through mix- 
ing with the poor and imitating the way they lived? These two 
hypotheses are not irrelevant to an attempt to understand the per- 
sonality of Blair-Orwell. Whatever the answer to the puzzle, it is a 
fact that between 1928 and 1930 George Orwell was preparing to 
enter literature in the garb of a vagrant. 
Although not yet the “famous author’’ he had wished to become 
when at Eton, he began to take part in London literary life. He con- 
tributed to the Adelphi magazine. He became interested in the 
social and economic conditions of the hop-pickers. He looked for 
work, and took a teaching post at a small private school in Mid- 
dlesex. He wrote for the New English Weekly and The New 
Statesman and Nation. He completed Burmese Days. Clearly in- 
spired by its author’s experiences in Burma, this novel examines the 
problem of the relationship between the white man and the in- 
digenous population, and denounces the subtle and not-so-subtle 
dialectic between colonizers and colonized. This is not the classic 
master-slave dialectic but one which, as V.S. Pritchett wrote later, 
makes for a situation in which ‘‘oppression creates hypocrisy and 
that hypocrisy corrupts’’—a formula that suggests the nuances of 
Orwell’s attitude to the colonial problem at that time. Not that his 
denunciation of imperialism was the weaker for it. 
Orwell had become a writer. In October 1934 he completed a se- 
cond novel, The Clergyman’s Daughter, a work with which he was 
dissatisfied and which he regarded merely as an exercise. It tells the 
story of Dorothy, who escapes from the family and social prison to 
Passport Photos, 1955, ink on paper, a composition of fingerprints by the US artist Saul Steinberg.

which she is condemned and who, as far as some of the incidents 
she experiences are concerned, bears a close sisterly resemblance to 
her creator; she goes off to live with down-and-outs+and hop- 
pickers, becomes a schoolmistress and then returns home. It is hard 
to know what significance Orwell attached to this ‘‘unhappy end”’. 
He was already at work on a new novel, Keep the Aspidistra Flying, 
a fierce denunciation of money, of mercantile society, of the havoc 
lack of money causes in individual and collective destinies, of the 
profit neurosis, and the worship of the golden calf. 
The tone of this novel reflects a sense of moral condemnation 
rather than an ideological anti-capitalist stand, just as the anti- 
colonialism of Burmese Days is indistinguishably bound up with 
moral comment. In discussing Keep the Aspidistra Flying, 
however, critics of Orwell’s works hasten to point out another facet 
of the novel—its pacifism. Gordon Comstock, its main hero, is 
haunted by visions of a future war which, prophetically, he sees as 
being waged principally in the sky. The year is 1935, not so long 
before Guernica, the Stuka dive-bombers of the blitzkrieg in France 
and the bombing raids of the Battle of Britain. 
Shortly after he had finished Keep the Aspidistra Flying, in 
January 1936, his publisher, Gollancz, commissioned Orwell to 
write a book about the condition of the unemployed in the north 
of England. Orwell set off immediately for the north where he was 
to remain for two months, living with militant trade unionists and 
visiting cotton mills and coal-mines. He carried out a journalistic, 
on-the-spot enquiry worthy of a specialist in economic and social 
problems—which he was not—which was to form the basis of a 
book published the following year entitled The Road to Wigan 
Pier, Wigan being an industrial centre particularly hard hit by 
unemployment and short-time working. 
Wigan Pier was not just a straight reporting assignment. In its 
way it is typical of Orwell’s literary style in which fiction is mixed 
with autobiographical detail and with descriptions from real life. 
What is more, the book contains a number of comments which 
betray Orwell as being still tributary to a middle-class conception 
of society and of revolution.

### 58030: George Orwell, a 'Tory anarchist'

» At that time, the Left in England consisted of the Labour Party, 
with its various tendencies, the (orthodox) Communist Party and 
the Independent Labour Party (ILP), a group whose ideological 
identity is difficult to define but which brought together socialist 
humanists as well as communists opposed to the doctrines of the 
Third International. 
Orwell, who was closer to the ILP, described himself as a “Tory 
anarchist”, a contradiction in terms which can be seen as reflecting 
the personal ambiguities of someone whom the experiences of life 
and certain personal fantasies had pushed towards socialist 
theories. Nevertheless there remained within him the man of the 
past who placed great trust in the middle-classes whose leader he 
aimed to be in the coming revolution. This contrasted with the 
Marxist-Leninists who saw in the Proletariat and its ‘“dictatorship”’ 
the only dynamic, historic revolutionary force. Orwell, who saw 
himself as an out-and-out revolutionary, was not a populist, and 
even less a plebeian. At times his writing hints at a certain distance 
from the common people, who “smell”. 
But by then it was 1936 and Orwell was seriously concerned 
about the threat from nazism and fascism which some elements of 
the Left tended to under-estimate and shrug off as merely 
epiphenomena. Eric Blair decided to take part in the war in Spain. 
“In the early 20th century the vision of a 
future society unbelievably rich, leisured, 
orderly and efficient—a glittering an- 
tiseptic world of glass and steel and 
snow-white concrete—was part of the 
consciousness of nearly every literate 
person.” (George Orwell in Nineteen 
Eighty-Four). Right, 4D Time Lock:

He turned once again to his friends of the ILP and finally ended up 
in Barcelona, in the ranks of the POUM (Partido Obrero de 
Unificacion Marxista, the United Marxist Workers’ Party). 
Unlike a number of other intellectuals, Eric Blair did not go to 
Spain as a humanist, literary tourist. He went to the front line as 
an officer of a POUM centuria, or battalion, complete with car- 
tridge belt and an old model 1889 Mauser. On 20 May 1937, a Fran- 
coist bullet struck him in the throat. 
Nursed back to health—he nevertheless had some difficulty in 
speaking for the rest of his life—he returned to England. He had 
thrown himself wholeheartedly into this war which for him was a 
war of humanist socialism against totalitarianism. This Spanish ex- 
perience seems to have finally convinced George Orwell the writer 
of the “‘singleness of the adversary’: totalitarianism whether of 
Party or of State. He was to publish an account of his Spanish ex- 
perience in Homage to Catalonia in which the theme of ‘‘revolution 
above all” seemed to predominate; the impending conflict with 
nazi Germany confirmed him in the idea that a war between 
capitalism and fascism would be a case of ‘six of one and half a 
6 
dozen of the other’ and that this kind of war could end, even in 
England, only in a fascist solution. 
A new novel, Coming up for Air, appeared between Homage to 
Catalonia and his two last works which were to make of him an 
author of world stature. It is a nostalgic book. Times past are gone 
for ever and unrelenting pessimism is the keynote of the present— 
pessimism which no belief in the future can fully assuage. 
Something died forever in the world at the same time that George 
Bowling (the hero of Coming up for Air) said goodbye to his 
youth—the tranquillity of old England threatened with a political 
and warlike Apocalypse. 
At that period Orwell seems to have turned to out-and-out 
pacifism; the ‘‘democracies’’ such as France and England, with 
their colonial empires and millions of men held in subjection and 
exploited in shameful fashion, appeared to be in no moral position 
to take a stand against the nazi and fascist dictatorships. He saw no 
other way out of the existing situation than the creation of a party 
of the masses whose aims and actions would be fired by a common 
determination to oppose both war and imperialism. But all this he 
himself seems to have seen as nothing more than a pious hope, and 
the signature of the German/Soviet pact convinced him that the 
war had already begun. At this point Orwell discovered in himself

a sense of patriotism, somewhat resigned, perhaps, but un- 
shakeable. Whatever her faults old England had to be defended 
against Hitlerism and, without abandoning his revolutionary 
theories, he decided to work as effectively as he could for the war 
effort. 
His ill health—he was suffering from tuberculosis—prevented 
him from serving in the army. He worked for the BBC on broad- 
casts to India, joined the Home Guard and wrote The Lion and the 
Unicorn, a book in which he praised patriotism and criticized those 
intellectuals (one of whom he had been himself) who declared their 
disdain for national values, while insisting that the war must be a 
people’s war accompanied by a radical change in society based on 
a liberal, collectivist socialism which, nevertheless, must not be 
dominated by the State. It must be an English socialism which 
would suppress neither the monarchy nor traditional culture and 
customs and would respect the nation’s past. 
He contributed to Left wing magazines such as Tribune and 
Horizon and, in November 1943, he began work on Animal Farm, 
which he was to finish at the end of the following February. 
This work brought Orwell the international fame that Nineteen

Eighty-Four would confirm. The subject matter is well known. 
Revolt is brewing amongst the animals at Mr. Jones’s Manor Farm. 
But once freed from their human masters, the animals find 
themselves in the same condition of servitude as before the revolt, 
some of their own kind having replaced their former masters. The 
slogan that inspired their revolt, “All animals are equal’, has 
become ‘‘All animals are equal, but some are more equal than 
others’’. Written at the height of the war, the book was refused by 
several publishers. When it finally appeared in August 1945, it met 
with immediate success. 
Already, while he was completing Animal Farm Orwell had in 
mind another book which he was to finish in 1948 whilst seriously 
ill and which was to be published in June of the following year, 
some seven months before his death on 21 January 1950. 
The year is 1984. (Let it be said in passing that this date has no 
particular significance, being merely the date of the year in which 
the book was completed with the last two figures transposed). The 
world is divided between three superpowers—OQOceania, Eurasia and 
Eastasia. The action takes place in England which has become an 
integral part of Oceania. The country, completely State-controlled, 
is dominated by the figure of a single man, Big Brother, supported 
by the Inner Party which in turn is backed up by the Outer Party 
  
machine. The hero, Winston Smith, is an employee at the Ministry 
of Truth, an organization whose task it is to spread the official 
“truth” of the day and to correct or to eradicate from the records 
of past events, declarations, decisions and persons in contradiction 
with the present policies of the State. Winston gets to know Julia, 
a young woman who works for the Anti-Sex League. One day, by 
means of various subterfuges, the young couple succeed in starting 
an illicit liaison. Meanwhile Winston comes into contact with a 
mysterious person in a position of considerable authority, O’Brien, 
who reveals himself to Winston as being an opponent of the regime 
and a supporter of Goldstein, the enemy number one and scapegoat 
of the leaders of Oceania. Winston confides in O’Brien, but the lat- 
ter turns out to be an important member of the Inner Party, and 
head of the Thought Police. Arrested and tortured both physically 
and mentally, Winston ceases to oppose the Party, becoming en- 
tirely subject to its will, betrays Julia who in turn betrays him, and 
is finally despatched to a minor post in an obscure section of the 
Ministry of Truth. : 
The story line of 1984 is relatively weak. From the relationship 
between Winston and O’Brien, however, there emerges a profound 
study of every aspect of totalitarianism, not least of which is the in- 
tellectual manipulation of people through Newspeak, a language 
specially designed to eliminate all contestation, indeed all nuances 
of thought, while imposing the official “‘truth’’, however subject to 
change this may be, in a manner that defies logical or factual con- 
tradiction. ‘“The earth is the centre of the universe. The sun and the 
stars go round it’’, O’Brien tells Winston; and, holding up the 
fingers of his left hand with the thumb concealed, ‘There are five 
fingers there. Do you see five fingers?” 
Orwell examines the question of why and how a regime such as 
that of Oceania can exist and last. It is because the men who control 
it are interested only in power, power for its own sake, devoid of 
any other purpose such as comfort, happiness, liberty, rationality 
or ideology. This is a form of oligarchic totalitarianism which is 
based on a sort of institutionalized schizophrenia, the single State 
for which the exterior, objective world does not exist. 
Certain of the themes of Animal Farm are echoed in Nineteen 
Eighty-Four, but it is not a political novel. It is not a forecast of the 
way in which a particular regime may develop; it is, as Orwell wrote 
to his publisher, a parody of the “‘intellectual consequences of 
totalitarianism’’, and, to some extent, this parodying aspect of the 
book attenuates its pessimism. In the same way as we speak of 
“black humour’’ we might describe it as ‘‘black burlesque’. There 
After the publication, in 1948, of his 
book Nineteen Eighty-Four, George 
Orwell wanted to make his position clear: 
“I do not believe that the kind of society 
| describe necessarily will arrive, but | 
believe (allowing of course for the fact 
that the book is a satire) that something 
resembling it could arrive. | believe also 
that totalitarian ideas have taken root in 
the minds of intellectuals everywhere, 
and | have tried to draw these ideas out 
to their logical consequences. The scene 
of the book is laid in Britain in order to em- 
phasize that the English-speaking races 
are not innately better than anyone else 
and that totalitarianism, if not fought 
against, could triumph anywhere.’’ Left,

is nothing to laugh at about the picture of the world presented to 
us in Nineteen Eighty-Four, but the prevailing feeling we have when 
reading it is not one of terror. One can even see in it glimpses of 
optimism. 
“If there is hope, wrote Winston, it lies in the proles (proletariat) 
(...) The future belonged to the proles. And could he be sure that 
when their time came the world they constructed would not be just 
as alien to him, Winston Smith, as the world of the Party? Yes, 
because at least it would be a world of sanity. Where there is equali- 
ty there can be sanity. Sooner or later it would happen, strength 
would change into consciousness. The proles were immortal (...).”" 
From this moment on, the lower upper middle-class socialist with 
such fond respect for the old English ways, looked to the proletariat 
as the liberating force, not without reservations, but with a mes- 
sianic intensity and a poetic power difficult to define and with all 
the imprecise passion of the humanitarian, progressive outpourings 
of the nineteenth century; thus, in evoking a possible future he 
becomes a utopian voice from the past. After all, we are only in 
1984.

From analysis to action 
New trends in the psychological sciences 
was a branch of philosophy, has 
always attempted to assert its in- 
dependence by establishing a particular 
goal and a specific method of approach. Its 
vocation has been to study the psyche of the 
individual, along with his cognitive, emo- 
tional and behavioural processes, based on 
the concept of man as an individual 
represented by a biological, medical, 
physical or metaphysical model.

Shortly before the turn of the century, 
Freud’s discovery of unconscious processes 
could have caused irreparable damage to 
psychology, the scope of which was limited 
to the sphere of consciousness. On the con- 
trary, this revised view of man gave 
psychology a foundation and a new point of

departure. Similarly, developments in the 
social sciences were to define this discipline 
in terms of then recent advances in 
sociology, linguistics, economics and other 
areas. 
To this day, no clear preference has been 
expressed either for including 
psychoanalysis as a part of general 
psychology or for accepting that since 
psychoanalysis is centred on unconscious 
manifestations, it breaks away from the 
point of view of classical psychology and 
exists as an independent science. In the 
United States psychoanalysis claims to be 
the basis as well as an integral part of a 
broader field of psychology, which itself is 
concerned with pathology and health. In 
France, it is most often looked upon as a 
distinct field, not derived from any other.

sonality tests), developmental psychology 
and psychoanalytical psychology. 
Psychoanalytical theories remain a major 
point of reference in testing, pathology and 
laboratory research, whether efforts are 
made to apply them to other fields or to 
refute them. 
It is inappropriate to distinguish 
psychological and psychoanalytical ap- 
proaches by referring to health and 
pathology, as the borderline separating the 
two is difficult to ascertain and should be 
drawn with care. Some therapies are based 
solely upon psychoanalysis, while others 
are purely psychological; all refer to dif- 
ferent theories that must be taken into 
account. 
Historical perspective is an essential 
feature herein, to the extent that it recreates 
certain aspects of individual development 
and forms an integral part of all 
psychological parameters. 
The definition of the unconscious is in- 
separable from the manner in which it was 
discovered. Freud sought to cure symptoms 
of hysteria using hypnosis. During patients’ 
trance states, he realized that their recalling 
certain traumatic memories caused the 
symptoms to disappear. He also noticed 
that ‘“abreaction”, or gaining awareness of 
a traumatic event to which emotion is at- 
tached, has a healing effect. Forgetting is 
the cause of neurosis, in other words, un- 
conscious activity exists. 
Little by little, Freud substituted free 
association for hypnosis. He found that the 
act of forgetting is motivated and that sub- 
jects tend to resist their memory. A fantasy, 
a psychological phenomenon, comes to 
replace the traumatic and pathogenic 
memory. Unconscious desire is seen in its 
different ramifications, hence the Oedipus 
and castration complexes orient human 
development. : 
Psychoanalytical treatment is intended to 
recognize intrapsychical conflicts stemming 
from the subject’s unconscious. The 
method consists of reserving judgment con- 
cerning the reality of the events mentioned. 
The external factor is not denied, but its im- 
pact is measured in terms of the resonance 
it finds in the individual. The individual

recreates his conflicts during treatment and 
the interpretation of this reaction through 
transference enables the patient to become 
conscious of his psychical determinism, The 
analyst’s attitude, therefore, must be 
neutral when comprehending and judging 
phenomena. His silence should be broken 
only for as “*objective’’ an interpretation as 
possible, since the analyst is no more than 
a receiver, a mirror reflecting back the un- 
conscious meanings of the patient’s con- 
scious speech. As treatment progresses, the 
task becomes more complex, and the 
analyst must take into account the different 
psychical processes he discovers. 
Psychoanalysis does not deal with symp- 
toms, but with the unconscious of a given 
subject as a whole whose psychical ap- 
paratus is composed of forces in conflict. 
Psychoanalytical theory implies a par- 
ticular technique and attitude which stem 
from a precise scientific model, that of the 
sciences of nature and empiricism, The ex- 
ercise consists of discovering a cause, a 
truth, basic desires, and of decoding an 
original unconscious message that is ex- 
pressed in a distorted state, censored by the 
conscious awareness. Admittedly, how- 
ever, psychological experiments that have 
attempted to confirm these theories have 
met with failure. 
Over the past twenty years, interven- 
tionism has returned to psychoanalysis and 
is now a directing force in all therapies. This »

» change can be explained by various factors. 
First, the activity of psychoanalysis, 
which was limited to the comprehension 
and treatment of neuroses, branched out to 
cover other, more serious types of 
pathologies. It then became necessary to 
revise theoretical concepts and create new 
technical features. For a new goal it became 
necessary to have new explanations and 
methods, and above all, a new outlook. 
It appeared necessary to take into ac- 
count those early events that conditioned 
the environment and gave rise to specific 
problems. An individual cannot become 
neurotic unless the first years of his life were 
free from serious traumas, thus allowing 
for the development of a stable psychical 
organization. In other cases, it is impossible 
for the individual to comprehend himself 
with respect to internal conflicts which 
could not have taken shape. In the latter in- 
stance, the structure is too deficient. 
Moreover, social changes influence the 
course of mental pathology, both in form 
and definition. 
The expansion of psychoanalysis and in- 
creased understanding of neuroses led to 
the development of different, complement- 
ary models that offer an insight into other 
aspects of pathology, including narcissism 
and identity. A more complex clinical ap- 
proach and a modified therapeutic view- 
point are associated with increased 
theoretical knowledge. 
Admitting the importance of reality in 
psychical processes leads to taking into ac- 
count interpersonal relationships during 
both infancy and treatment. Observation of 
babies supports this discovery. 
Parallel to this, there is an 
epistemological change. It becomes clear 
that the observer influences the observation 
and neutrality is a myth. Thus silence is a 
form of intervention and the analyst ceases 
to be a neutral receiver, since his personality 
is just as important as his capacity to em- 
pathize with his patient. The moment un- 
conscious reality reaches the surface, it can 
no longer be considered as data, but rather 
as a simple version of facts or a point of 
view. 
From a psychological standpoint, dif- 
ferent models either complement or negate 
each other. Aside from basic treatment, 
analysis has extended its activities to 
borderline and narcissistic cases. In addi- 
tion, psychoanalytical-type therapies are 
currently used to treat psychotic subjects. 
Research into rapid techniques con- 
tinues. Psychoanalytical psychodramas 
allow the individual to act out and exter- 
nalize his conflicts. Psychoanalytical relax- 
ation takes the body into consideration and 
is appropriate for subjects who experience 
difficulty in verbalizing their emotions. 
Psychoanalytical perspective aside, 
various therapies are appearing, some of 
which focus on abreaction. One example is 
the primal scream, the cry of the newborn 
infant, which induces regression into past 
experience, enabling patients to integrate 
“this experience. Whether used individually 
or in groups, the “new therapies’’ are based 
on the concept of living one’s emotional ex- 
periences, coming into contact with one’s 
body. ; 
10 
 
The multiplicity of therapies answers a 
need for change, rapidity, and often 
economy. They are based on a certain re- 
jection of psychoanalysis as well as on the 
idea that the unconscious cannot be directly 
taken into account; thus, mere understand- 
ing is no longer adequate, and the import- 
ant factor is to live. 
The coexistence of psychoanalytical and 
psychological therapies is accompanied by a 
reciprocal influence, unless deeper-lying 
changes create a certain diversity. Reality, 
pathology and clinical medicine are now 
plural concepts. Treatment is no longer 
considered a theatre of pure re-enactment 
but offers the possibility of living a new 
experience. ‘ 
Over twenty years ago, a new theory 
came into being, accompanied by a 
therapeutic method which alone could well 
become a branch of psychology. Founded 
on mathematical discoveries and the theory 
Developed in 1921 by the 
Swiss psychiatrist Hermann 
Rorschach, the Rorschach Test 
is a projective method of 
psychological testing in which 
the testee is asked to describe 
what he sees in a series of ten 
symmetrical ink-blots. From 
the replies received the tester 
attempts to establish a broad 
picture of the testee’s per- 
sonality type—whether, for ex- 
ample, he or she is basically in- 
trovert or extrovert. Below, a 
test in progress.

of systems, it focuses on communication, 
the relationships and laws governing the 
functioning of families as systems. 
The individual is no longer considered as 
a decomposable structure, and thus the 
understanding of the psyche becomes 
secondary and seemingly inefficacious. The 
individual exists only in terms of the func- 
tion he performs in communicating with 
others, for everything is communication. 
‘‘Sickness’’ does not exist per se. It is the 
effect of pathological communication 
whose most extreme manifestation is what 
has been termed the ‘“double constraint’’, a 
contradictory order one subject gives 
another, placing the latter in a position 
whereby his choice is impeded. Based on 
that premise, there is no such thing as a 
disturbed individual; only the system is ail- 
ing, seeking balance through the most 
pathological means open to it. The answer 
is thus to treat a system. This technique may 
be applied to an individual, but he must 
always be regarded as part of a system. 
The notion of intrapsychical conflict is 
absent from this approach, which is centred 
on interaction and interpersonal relations. 
It is useless to understand, because 
understanding does not elicit change, and it 
is precisely change that is important. This 
method is active, entailing suggestion and 
order. It highlights the pathological aspect 
of communication that must be modified, 
and it is based on psychology without 
psychism. 
Recent developments in psychology have 
led to a division into psychologies or 
psychological disciplines. This is due as 
much to epistemological changes as it is to 
economic and social changes and 
ideological influences. 
Looking from within the different 
psychologies, it is the interaction between 
theory and clinical practice that induces 
methodological changes, the goal of every 
therapy being to effect change. There are 
differences in the methods employed both 
to cause change and to enable change to oc- 
cur. Interventionism still applies, even 
when it takes the form of non-intervention. 
However, the active techniques that pro- 
mote change (catharsis, systemic therapies, 
etc.) differ from psychoanalytical tech- 
nique, which seeks to make change possi- 
ble, to free the subject from his bonds 
without conditioning him in any way 
whatsoever, 
From a psychoanalytical standpoint, 
distinctions are drawn in terms of a given 
pathology, making it possible to obtain in- 
dications for treatment, but they are also 
drawn with respect to the different 
theoretical models that give rise to different 
types of intervention. 
Some models focus on conflict, others on 
certain aspects of pathology, others still on 
the development of the personality. 
It is possible to discern a trend towards an 
integration of the various theories, each of 
which represents one aspect of the human 
being. All of them are distorted representa- 
tions of phenomena they refract, and which 
otherwise would never have come into con- 
scious existence.

### IGNORE

A NY attempt to define the current 
situation of psychology in Black 
Africa depends on what is meant 
by psychology—modern (or Western) 
psychology, or traditional African 
psychology. 
While the former enjoys full scientific 
and administrative recognition in many 
Black African countries, the latter still has 
to assert its existence as a body of 
knowledge and practice which can be tested 
by the scientific method of hypothesis, ex- 
perimental verification and proof. The 
mistrust and sometimes mutual rejection 
which prevail between these two kinds of 
psychology seriously limit the possibilities 
of a form of official collaboration between 
them which could lead to a veritable 
synthesis. 
Modern psychology in Black Africa can 
be evaluated in two ways. It can be con- 
sidered as a science with universal validity, 
in which case its level in Black Africa is the 
same as that which is found throughout the 
world. On the other hand, if it is held that 
modern psychology can only be truly scien- 
tific in a specific historical and cultural con- 
text, its evaluation entails an assessment of 
the evolution it has undergone in its new set- 
ting by being either receptive or closed to 
methodological changes and to models 
previously elaborated and tested elsewhere. 
We take it that modern psychology in- 
cludes the major currents of Western 
psychology which lay claim to be scientific 
by virtue of their biological, physiological 
and/or psychic foundations. It thus cor- 
responds to the ancient physic of the mind 
as opposed to the philosophy of the soul, 
and englobes psychiatry, psychological 
testing, experimental psychology, which is 
often associated with educational psycho- 
logy, social psychology, psychotherapy and 
psychoanalysis. Of these major branches, 
with their many ramifications and theoret- 
ical trends, only educational psychology 
and psychiatry have been trying, in the last 
four decades, to take root in Africa. Since 
1960, the year when many countries achiev- 
ed political independence, modern p

### 58039: Psychology in Black Africa

» psychology has been taught virtually 
everywhere in Africa, generally in faculties 
of human sciences. 
Psychiatry, however, is usually con- 
sidered as a medical discipline and is often 
taught in faculties of medicine. This dif- 
ference in status, due to the fact that it is 
taken seriously by the authorities, is cer- 
tainly one of the reasons why its develop- 
ment has been more remarkable than that 
of other branches. The Universities of 
Dakar (Senegal) and Ibadan (Nigeria) are 
among those which have a world-wide in- 
fluence in this field. Journals, books, inter- 
national meetings and a range of document- 
ary information promote the exchange of 
ideas and experience between specialists 
and institutions in Africa and those in other 
continents. According to the University of 
Dakar periodical Psychopathologie Afri- 
caine, 448 articles were devoted to 
psychiatry in Black Africa between 1965 
and 1979, 200 of them appearing in this 
same journal. During the same period 274 
works, the proceedings of 70 meetings, and 
68 miscellaneous documents were also 
published. Although few Africans are in- 
volved in these exchanges of information, 
their participation is remarkable in view of 
the fact that modern psychology is a recent 
import to Africa; it did not reach Black 
. Africa until 1940. 
Nevertheless, it must be admitted that in 
psychiatry alone, the human and material 
capacities available are far from meeting 
the needs of the sub-continent: in some 
countries there is only one psychiatrist for 
over 500,000 head of population. This 
situation is aggravated by certain trends 
and characteristics which are peculiar to 
modern psychology in Africa, and which 
are themselves a result of the cultural and 
historical context in which psychology 
began to take shape in Greek Antiquity. 
The term psychology, or discourse on the 
psyche, derives from the Greek notion of 
the soul. In Homer, the word sou! (in Greek 
anemos, breath) had a twofold significance, 
englobing on the one hand thumos, mind, 
will, passion, that which characterizes the 
individual personality; and on the other 
psyche, life, the animal inspiration which 
gives life to all bodies. From the fifth cen- 
tury BC until the Christian era, this dual 
conception of man was worked out more 
fully and rationalized within philosophical 
and religious doctrines which underlay the 
idea of immortality and the divinity of the 
psyche. 
These doctrines included reincarnation 
and the imperative of autoperfection of the 
psyche. The individual person was respon- 
sible for achieving this perfection and con- 
sequently for his fate in life and after death. 
The precept “know thyself’’, which was in- 
scribed on the temple at Delphi, is a good 
expression of the Greek belief that the hap- 
piness of the individual is based on 
knowledge of his psyche and of his duty to 
it. 
These Greek ideas on the psyche persisted 
until the nineteenth century when they were 
exposed to the test of reason supported by 
science, which had triumphed in almost all 
fields of knowlédge. Psychology was 
criticized on the grounds that it was based 
on scholastic reasoning which did not stand 
up to scientific experimentation. Thus it 
was classified as a magical practice because 
12 
of the bad reputation it had acquired during 
history. 
In the Western perspective, that of the 
Greek and Judaeo-Christian psyche, the 
“madman’’ is someone inhabited by a 
defective soul, which is dangerous because 
it can corrupt other souls. Deprived of a 
healthy spirit, he ceases to be a person and 
thus loses the right to speech. Disconnected 
from his culture, he has nothing to com- 
municate. He is dead but responsible for his 
state. He must be destroyed, often by fire, 
an element as subtle as the soul. For cen- 
turies mental alienation and disagreement 
with the established order were confused in 
the name of religious and political in- 
tolerance, and heretics, outlaws, and 
madmen were transported to distant islands 
Or interned in asylums in the remote 
countryside. 
In the nineteenth century Western 
psychology reacted against this bad image 
and the criticisms of science by diversifying. 
itself in a search for scientific foundations. 
But in spite of the progress it has made in 
this direction, psychology is still considered 
as a science of secondary importance, ex- 
cept in the Soviet Union and the United 
States. When modern psychology took root 
in Black Africa there was a strong concern 
that its scientific status should be preserved. 
Hence the ambiguities of its attitudes to 
African psychology: rejection of it at the 
theoretical level, coexistence with it in cer- 
tain universities, and in some cases col- 
laboration with it in the practical sphere. 
While anyone practically concerned ith 
the question cannot fail to realize that an 
authentic African psychology really exists, 
in the current state of research and publica- 
tions (numerous though they are) it is im- 
possible to define it in simple, general and 
universally acceptable terms. In any case 
such is not my intention in this article. 
The question of the nature of African 
psychology is part of the vaster problem of 
the rehabilitation of African negro culture. 
For example, the existence of African 
psychology as a scientific theory is closely 
connected to that of African philosophy, 
which is the source of continuing debate 
among African philosophers. Nor is it 
possible, within the limits of this article, to 
give a general assessment of the state of 
African psychology in all its aspects. | 
Accordingly, we have restricted our 
reflections to African psychiatry which, by 
virtue of its presence and role in the con- 
tinent seems sufficiently representative of 
African psychology. If it is accepted that 
there is a connexion between mental health 
or alienation and the individual personality, 
and that psychiatry cannot be effective 
unless it is part of a specific geographical 
setting, a specific human history, and a 
specific culture, then African psychiatry 
cannot be understood without reference to, 
a specifically African culture and 
.personality. 
The work of anthropologists, 
Africanists, and men of culture both from 
Africa and from other continents supports 
the idea of the cultural unity of Black 
Africa. The basic features of the African 
personality exist within this fundamental 
unity, which is often masked by physical or 
linguistic diversity or by differences in 
customs. Since the publication of La

In traditional African societies, 
the soothsayer has a status 
similar to that of the 
physician—both are consulted 
at critical moments in the lives 
of individuals or of social 
groups. In his own way the 
soothsayer fulfils a broad 
therapeutic function. Fa (a 
word in the language of the Fon 
people; Ifa in Yoruba) is a tradi- 
tional divinatory technique of 
the countries of the Gulf of 
Guinea. In Dahomey (present- 
day Benin) the Bokonon or Fa

before any important decision 
was taken. In our photo, taken

Philosophie Bantoue by Placide Tempels in 
1945, the concept of the African personality 
as developed by African philosophers ap- 
pears (according to Ibrahima Sow) to con- 
sist of four elements: the body (the corporal 
envelope); the biological principle (internal 
organs, automatic and psychosomatic 
systems); the life principle; and the spirit as 
such, the substance of immortality. 
This conception of the personality is . 
situated in a dynamic psychological field 
which is defined by three main axes of rela- 
tionships; the personality is at the meeting 
point of these axes. There is a vertical axis 
which brings the individual into relation 
with his founding Ancestor, with God and 
with the other invisible Existents; a 
horizontal axis, or axis of social order, 
which brings him into relation with the 
cultural community; and the existential 
axis, the axis of the person or the axis of 
biolineal existence. (Dr. lbrahima Sow, 
Psychiatrie Dynamique Africaine). The 
balance of the personality and thus of its 
mental health depend on the balance of this 
psychological universe. The coherence of 
the whole is maintained, at each level, by 
origin-myths, creation-myths, or founder- 
myths, as well as by reason, which indicate 
the conditions of individual and collective 
human experience. 
This conception of the personality 
defines the individual neither as a Leibnitz- 
ian monad (unity) nor, as certain an- 
thropologists would have it, as a tribal sub- » 
Psychotherapy was practised in 
Africa by the Egyptians and long 
pre-dated the Greek, Roman and 
Hebrew tradition in which much of 
modern Western psychology is 
rooted. Imhotep (right), chief 
minister, astrologer and physician 
to king Djoser {c. 2686-2613 BC), 
who has been described as ‘the 
first figure of a physician to stand 
out clearly from the mists of anti- 
quity’’, practised psychotherapy 
with such skill that he was ele- 
vated to the rank of a deity to 
whom temples were erected at 
Memphis and on the island of 
Philae.

»ject without liberty. Each personality is 
unique, while also remaining an expression 
of the totality of the main cultural deter- 
minants. This means that there is the 
possibility for a psychology of individual 
differences in the modern sense, just as 
there is everywhere else. 
Ibrahima Sow has also written that ‘‘the 
cause and effect of mental disturbance meet 
in that which either affects the vertical 
dimension of the Being, its relationship 
with the Ancestor or with God, and thus 
shatters the person’s fundamental identity, 
or in that which affects the horizontal 
dimension of existential experience and 
provokes misfortune. (...) The disturbance 
can never simply be an isolated and 
restricted inner debate, because the African 
conception of relationship is a total and 
dynamic one’’. According to specialists, the 
ideas of personal sin and guilt are virtually 
non-existent in African madness. The 
persecution-depression theme, on the other 
hand, is more common, conforming as it 
does to the .anthropological structure 
described above. The pathogenic agent, 
which is always outside the sick person, is 
either a wicked person, or an invisible 
force, or the founding Ancestor. 
Among the various methods used to seek 
the deep-lying causes of the sickness are in- 
tuitive or deductive divination such as Fa, 
which is extensively practised in the coun- 
tries on the Gulf of Guinea. An investiga- 
tion is carried out into the sick person and 
all the suspect networks of relationships. 
The treatment prescribed by the 
geomancer, who in addition to his other 
qualities possesses that of a subtle 
psychologist, takes many forms, incor- 
porating the use of plant drugs, trance, 
possession, prayer, incantation, sacrifice, 
ritual and propitiatory offerings, and a 
temporary change of community (although 
the patient is never separated from people 
he knows). Constantly cared for by his 
family and his community, the “madman” 
does not need to be exiled unless his condi- 
tion is so serious that it constitutes a real 
physical danger for those around him. Only 
if it is can he be temporarily deprived of 
freedom of movement. 
Thus although African psychiatry has 
not yet been expressed in a body of theory, 
it cannot be identified, as those who believe 
in an extreme form of scientism would 
maintain, with magic, savagery or ig- 
norance, and consequently condemned to 
disappear or become a “‘folklore” 
psychology. In the urban environment 
where mental disturbance develops, the 
families of the sick seek the concomitant aid 
of both modern and traditional psychiatry, 
and the latter often turns out to be more ef- 
fective than tranquillizers which do not 
always bring about a definitive cure. This is 
one reason why in some countries 
specialists and authorities are showing an 
increasing interest in collaboration between 
modern psychology and African 
psychology. 
This approach seems particularly 
necessary today because there can be no 
doubt that, unlike the other sciences, even 
those branches of psychology which have 
won the most scientific recognition, such as 
, psychiatry or social psychology, cannot be 
exported ‘‘tailor made’. If it is to be effect- 
ive for a given people it must be developed 
from within that people’s culture. But it 
should also be stressed that the develop-- 
ment of African psychology cannot take 
place in isolation. Collaboration will be 
necessary with all the human and social 
sciences, above all with philosophy. 
It is in this sense that current debate 
about the conditions for the achievement of 
cultural identity and about. African 
philosophy have a particular interest for all 
those who believe that the overall qualities 
and abilities of a people are in a sense a 
reflection of those of each of the persons 
comprising it.

The Impact of Psychology on Third World Development was the theme of an international con- 
ference organized by Unesco and the International Union of Psychological Sciences and held in 
Edinburgh, Scotland, from 24 to 28 July 1982, The conference was attended by specialists from 
a wide range of countries, including Venezuela where, in 1979, a Ministry for the Development 
of Intelligence was created. The Minister has described the development of intelligence as "‘ab- 
solutely necessary for the political, economic and social development of peoples’’. A national pro- 
gramme has been established consisting of 14 projects. One of these, Project Chess, which is 
under the direction of a psychologist, aims to develop a ‘’chess-oriented’’ way of thinking among 
‘schoolchildren aged 7 to 9 and to study its possible transference to other areas. Below, a game 
of chess in progress in a street in Caracas.

‘The need for a fundamental change in the nature of the relations between the industrialized and the non- 
industrialized countries is becoming increasingly urgent. These relations are governed at present by an evolu- 
tionist, linear, diffusionist concept. Despite the obvious heterogeneity of our world, a ‘massification’ ideology 
that is as tenacious as it is false would have us believe that every country and culture should behave in the same 
way and pursue the same goals.’” Above, carved handle of a cane or sceptre belonging to the Oni, the spiritual

Anatomy of inequality 
The economic crisis seen from the Third World

JEAN SAYINZOGA, of Rwanda, is an 
economist, a member of the editorial staff of 
the Geneva based magazine Genéve-Afrique 
and an associate of the Refugee Section of the

consultant to the United Nations Conference

A gross national product (GNP); 
high unemployment; high infla- 
tion, chronically adverse foreign trade 
balances and, in the case of the countries 
of the southern hemisphere, an external 
debt which is becoming dangerously 
heavy—such are the main indicators of 
the economic crisis which currently af- 
flicts the market-economy countries. 
It is a commonplace that economic 
crises and the decline which they bring 
lead to explosive social and political 
situations. In some countries today we 
see sudden changes of Government, 
reflecting a swing between two oppos- 
ing political trends—a phenomenon 
which some observers have dubbed “the 
hen syndrome’, thinking of the way a 
hen transfixed by the headlights of an on- 
coming car tries to escape by crossing 
the road first in one direction, then in the 
other.

» which others regard as structural, let us 
examine these indicators more closely. 
A comparison of GNP growth rates in 
the industrialized countries (not including 
the socialist countries of eastern Europe) 
with those in the non oil-producing non- 
industrialized countries reveals the 
following situation: 
Industrialized countries: 
- year 1982 1983 1984 
{forecast) 
- average 
growthrate 1.5% 3% 3.5% 
Non-industrialized, non oil-producing 
countries: 
- year 1981 1982 1983 
- average 2 to 
growthrate 25% 15% 25% 
In the latter category of countries, the 
rate of growth of GNP declined by 6 per 
cent between 1960 and 1970 and by 5 
per cent between 1970 and 1380. Even 
assuming that an attempt to catch up is 
desirable, irrespective of the conditions 
in which it takes place, it is clear from the 
above figures that such an eventuality is 
not feasible at the present time. 
While the unemployment rate in the 
non-industrialized countries is at a level 
which may without any exaggeration be 
described as catastrophic, it should not 
be forgotten that in the industrialized 
countries 5.5 per cent of the working 
population were unemployed in 1972, 5 
percentin 1979; 8 percentin 1981, and 
9 per cent around the end of 1982. Since 
this unemployment exists in societies 
where the individual is fully socialized, 
that is, responsibility is taken for him 
from birth to death by the capitalist 
economy so far as employment is con- 
cerned and by the State so far as services 
(education, health, etc.) are concerned, 
the gravity of the situation can be fully 
gauged. 
Although inflation continues to be ram- 
pant in many countries of both North and 
South, some industrialized countries 
nevertheless seem to be bringing it under 
control. The inflation rate in these coun- 
- tries has been brought down from 7 per 
cent in 1982 to 5 per cent in 1983 and 
the same figure is forecast for 1984. 
A direct result of this lower .inflation 
rate could be a drop in interest rates and 
therefore an alleviation of the financial 
burden for countries which are saddled 
with the enormous external debt which 
they contracted with public and private 
bodies in the industrialized countries of 
the North. 
While the average rate of inflation in 
the oil-producing countries was 13 per . 
. centin 1980 and 1981 and 10 per cent 
.in 1982, it reached the record figure of 
30 per cent in 1982 for the third con- 
secutive year in the non-industrialized, 
non oil-producing countries, mainly 
because of the rise in the price of fuel. 
The cumulative foreign trade deficit of 
the non-industrialized non oil-exporting 
countries was 87 thousand million US 
dollars in 1982. The figure at present

tion is a drop of 14 per cent in the price 
of oil in 1982 and of 6 per cent in the 
volume of sales. 
The growth rate of the external debt, 
which was 10 per cent in 1982 {still 
higher than that of exports} is half as high 
as during the 1975-1981 period, but this 
is only a slight glimmer of hope.

revenues was 15 percentin 1976-1977, 
20 per cent in 1981 and 24 per cent in 
1982. In other words, the situation is 
getting worse. 
The two camps, namely, the in- 
dustrialized and the non-industrialized 
countries, may tax each other indefinite- 
ly with responsibility for the present 
situation without either side being entire- 
ly in the right or in the wrong. 
The industrialized countries can 
criticize the countries of the South for 
not having shown sufficient 
perseverance and determination in their 
political and economic struggles. This 
shortcoming has made it easier for the 
North to dominate the South and has led 
to the present impasse. But since the 
days when many Third World countries 
achieved independence, the centres of 
responsibility have moved from London, 
Paris, Lisbon, etc. to Dakar, Kigali, 
Caracas, Bangkok, and so on. 
For their part, the countries of the 
South can always point to the continuing 
deterioration in terms of trade, which is 
A new super highway rakes 
across the desert in Abu Dhabi, 
United Arab Emirates. The con- 
struction of adequate networks 
of roads and highways is a key 
factor in the development pro- 
cess, but the burden of road 
maintenance weighs heavily on 
the developing countries (see 
box below).

making them progressively poorer and 
the industrialized countries ever richer. 
Similarly, they can protest against the 
corrupt application of aid programmes 
which at present impoverish the 
receivers both materially and 
psychologically by developing an 
‘assisted person’ complex in them and 
making them bear the burden of heavy 
financial commitments. 
From this three major conclusions 
emerge: the gap between the in- 
dustrialized and the non-industrialized 
countries is growing bigger every year; 
all the remedies tried so far have failed; 
the need for a fundamental change in the 
nature of the relations between the in- 
dustrialized and the non-industrialized 
countries is becoming . increasingly 
urgent. 
These relations are governed at pre- 
sent by an evolutionist, linear, diffu- 
sionist concept. Despite the obvious 
heterogeneity of our world, a ‘’‘massifica- 
tion’’ ideology that is as tenacious as it is 
false would have us believe that every 
country and culture should behave in the 
same way and pursue the same goals, 
wherever on the earth's surface they 
may be situated. This is the basic idea of 
the theory of development, which 
presupposes the existence of a model 
society which supposedly possesses all 
the saving virtues and to the level of 
which the others must climb by the same 
ways and means which it employed and 
go through the same stages as those 
through which it passed. This model 
society is supposed to embody the future 
of all other societies. The vocabulary of 
this ideology reflects this pattern of 
events which is considered to be in- 
dispensable. Yesterday's ‘‘civilizing’” 
mission becomes today’s ‘‘aid’’ mission. 
Yesterday's ’savage’’ becomes 
‘undeveloped’, and in the minds of 
those concerned the ‘‘colonized’’ com- 
plex is replaced by that of someone who 
is ‘aided’. 
It is well known that in international 
trade any product with a high 
technological content enjoys a definite 
advantage from the start, whereas the p 
 
 
  
The costs of poor road maintenance 
The worldwide road-building boom of the 1960s and 1970s threatens to 
become the road-maintenance crisis of the 1980s and 1990s. Over the 
past ten years, roads in many developing countries have been allowed to 
deteriorate beyond the point where normal maintenance could be effec- 
tive. Traffic loading has been much heavier than intended, and mainte- 
nance has been widely neglected. Funds budgeted for highways have 
been mostly absorbed in expanding rather than maintaining the network. 
Inarecent survey of twelve developing countries, more than 25 percent 
of the tarred road network in eight of them required rehabilitation, streng- 
thening, or resealing. 
To prevent further deterioration, maintenance budgets need to be 
increased by at least 25 percent in three-quarters of the countries for 
which recent studies are available; in more than half, the required 
increase exceeds 75 percent. But more money is not the only answer. 
Maintenance costs could be significantly reduced by improved efficiency. 
For example, use of plant and equipment is often extremely low, some- 
times only a quarter or a third of the rates achieved by the best main- 
tenance organizations. 
When road authorities are not able to afford maintenance work, the 
costs passed on to road users are larger than the “savings” in public 
expenditure. Over the life of a road, the total operating costs of vehicles 
are typically four to ten times the costs of road construction and mainte- 
nance. Since operating costs may easily double on poorly maintained 
roads, the economic loss is considerable. Moreover, in most countries 
the extra costs chiefly involve spending foreign exchange on spare parts, 
fuel, and replacing vehicles.

| Irrigation design 
and management 
Public and private investments in irriga- 
tion in developing countries have increa- 
sed dramatically over the past twenty 
years, reaching about $15 billion in 1980. 
But the returns are much below their 
potential: one recent estimate for South 
and Southeast Asia suggested that an 
additional 20 million tons of rice, enough 
to provide the minimum food require- 
ments of 90 million people, could be pro- 
duced every year with inexpensive im- 
provements in water distribution. 
A simple measure of the efficiency of an 
irrigation system is how much water is lost 
in distribution. Although losses of 25 per- 
cent are regarded as acceptable, they are 
often much higher due to management 
weaknesses in the operation of the 
system. 
Losses can often be reduced by rela- 
tively cheap improvements in irrigation 
design. In Maharashtra, India, the public 
distribution system traditionally consisted 
of unlined canals serving forty-hectare 
blocks. Where these have been replaced 
by lined tertiary canals serving eight- 
hectare blocks, water available at the field 
has increased by 40 percent, and net 
returns on the investment by some 160 
percent.

» producer of raw materials loses both in 
the short and long term because in the 
present state of economic relations his 
commodities are undervalued and in 
many cases are non-renewable. In any 
case, even if raw material prices were 
stabilized, not to say increased, the non- 
industrialized countries which are rich in 
raw materials would continue to be poor 
unless the method of exploiting the latter 
is changed. It should not be forgotten 
that only from 15 to 35 per cent of the 
capital invested, for instance, by an inter- 
national company remains in the host 
country. The remainder goes into im- 
ported plant, capital depreciation, in- 
terest payments, the salaries of ex- 
patriate staff, transport costs, insurance, 
etc. Ultimately, the raw material produc- 
ing country does not gain very much. 
It is clear that, for better or worse, the 
economies of both the non-industrialized 
and the industrialized countries are 
bound together, and that the growth of 
each should benefit the others. Let us 
take two examples. 
It has been estimated that if, in order to

The World Food Programme (WFP) is supporting ‘‘food-for-work’’ projects in 
Bangladesh employing up to two million workers. The aim of these projects is to reac- 
tivate some of the country’s great waterways both to conserve water for irrigation and 
to drain away flood water during the monsoon season. The projects include construc- 
tion of over 3,000 kilometres of embankments and the re-excavation of about 3,000

creases, the non-industrialized, non oil- 
producing countries had reduced their 
imports of manufactured goods, there 
would have been 3 million more 
unemployed in the member countries of 
the Organization for Economic Co- 
operation and Development (OECD). 
When asked to estimate the number of 
job losses in their country between 1970 
and 1976 because of competition from 
Third World countries, heads of major 
French enterprises and senior officials 
advanced figures that varied between 
200,000 and 500,000. They were along 
way from the real figure which was in the 
region of 25,000. It occurred to nobody 
that, side by side with these lost jobs, 
130,000 others were created through 
exports of capital goods and consumer 
goods. In fact, the growth of trade in in- 
dustrial goods between France and the 
Third World from 1970 to 1976 led to a 
net increase of 105,000 jobs. 
The world is going through a crisis to 
which every expert is trying to apply his 
own diagnosis and his own treatment. 
Each of the protagonists, the North and 
the South, is praying for a change that is 
slow in coming. 
However, the critical situations of the 
past and of today can still be a source of 
profit. Paradoxical though it may seem, 
certain financial bodies may be increas- 
ing their assets thanks to the (temporary) 
insolvency of certain debtors, since 
renegotiation of the repayment 
schedules involves an addition of 2 per 
cent on the initial interest rate. 
It is therefore becoming imperative to 
find alternative solutions to the present 
development strategy. There has, of 
course, been no shortage of catch 
phrases, such as "'basic needs’’, ''self- 
centred development’, 
autonomy’. But it is the entire concep- 
tion and orientation of the ideologies 
underlying the idea of development 
which must be thoroughly revised, both 
by the North and by the South. It is no

### 58047: In search of new economic structures

In search of 
New economic structures 
HE loose combination and ill- 
determined succession of events 
and situations which we term 
general crisis, is, we feel, inexplicable 
in terms of traditional concepts. 
In the 1960s the major Western 
economy and certain others were at 
grips with a certain fall in productivity 
and perturbed by a growing perception 
of the formidable nature of Japanese 
competition. 
These circumstances, accompanied 
by other internal and external dif- 
ficulties, heralded the decision of 
August 1971 which ended the gold 
convertibility of the dollar and ag- 
gravated the damage caused by 
floating exchange rates, amidst condi- 
tions which were highly inimical to this . 
policy and dangerous for the medium- 
sized and small nations. The United 
FRANCOIS PERROUX, French economist, 
is emeritus professor of the Collége de France, 
a corresponding member of the British 
Academy, an honorary member of the 
American Economic Association and founder 
of the Institut de Sciences Mathématiques et 
Economiques Appliquées. The latest of his 
many books has recently been published in

States and the industrialized market- 
economy countries experienced per- 
sistent, high, and increasing 
unemployment, very high inflation, ex- 
orbitant international liquidity and a 
slowdown in the growth of their gross 
national product (GNP). Towards the 
end of the 1970s inflation began to 
slacken off; this had a moderating ef- 
fect on prices but did not reduce 
unemployment or provoke an upturn in 
the growth of GNP. 
After enjoying two decades of pros- 
perity (1945-1968), combined growth 
and development, the industrialized 
market-economy countries went on to 
experience fifteen years (1968-1983) 
of slow and in some cases negative 
growth punctuated by hard shocks due 
to rises in the price of oil (1973 and 
1979) and to cessation of debt 
repayments at the end of the 1970s. 
The observable trends of the crisis 
we are experiencing today may be 
hypothetically envisaged in terms of, 
the content and effects of the two 
motors of contemporary change: in- 
dustry and finance, industrialization 
and financing. 
Industry is a structure and has a 
structuring power. It is simply a com- 
 
bination of fixed assets and trading 
capital coupled with teams of human 
agents organized hierarchically. By vir- 
tue of its two facets as an apparatus of 
things and as an organization of per- 
sons, it is a continuing phenomenon. 
+ The sciences and technologies that it 
incorporates endow it with a relative 
superiority over the rest of the 
economy, above all over agriculture, 
which it can carry along in its wake 
and, to a certain extent, shape. It 
wields this influence through its 
capacity to bring down prices, to 
widen flows, and through the informa- 
tion it disseminates. The industrial ap- 
paratus is a motor of, and currently the 
major centre of, innovation. Industry is 
concentrated and consists largely of 
oligopolies and groups. 
Finance is understood here as a 
mass of financial capital, of debts fall- 
ing due at different periods, which are 
in the power of a small number of 
public or private decision-makers: 
banks, financial intermediaries, public 
centres of credit distribution. The nor- 
mal functioning of the economy 
presupposes finance to launch the pro- 
ductive machine and keep it turning. 
Credit launches and maintains the vast 
industrial machine and its changing »

»and demand at world level is unat- 
tainable when a vast part of the world 
cannot formulate a sustained and 
growing demand nor obtain counter- 
parts in international trade freely and 
normally. Insufficiency of effective de- 
mand, met by a nation’s means of pro- 
duction, cannot be replaced over a 
long period and overall by aid or tied 
loans. 
Finally, it is clear that true competi- 
tion ceases to exist once a certain level 
of inequality between individuals or 
between structured human groups 
such as nations has been passed. In 
small countries there is good reason to 
wonder whether the highly intensive 
competition is between countries or 
between industries, some of which 
choose to be based in countries 
without making common cause with 
the rest of its economy and its 
- population. 
Flaws in the relationship between in- 
dustry and agriculture, between bran- 
ches of industry and branches of 
agriculture, are at the heart of the 
structural crisis of our time. By virtue 
of their technical, organizational, infor- 
mational and financial superiority, in- 
dustries dominate agriculture and in a

sense take it over. In the industrialized 
countries the success of the agro-food 
industry suggests that this inequality is 
being corrected, although there is still 
room for improvement. But a trend 
reversal which will restore to the 
- developing countries their capacity to 
produce food to satisfy domestic de- 
mand, by reducing the emphasis on 
export-directed agriculture or redirec- 
ting it, is a necessary task which is 
bound to take a long time. It calls for a 
restructuring which conflicts with the 
immediate interests of the established 
industries. 
Perhaps the best economic basis for 
a major readjustment in the relations 
between industry and agriculture 
would be through regional groupings of 
nations rather than through individual 
nations. The experience of Latin 
America and West Africa has shown 
that short-sighted and ill-considered 
nationalism stands in the way of the 
general welfare. 
The countries of Western Europe 
mark time as they try to hammer out a 
common policy in which the stumbling 
block is the relative importance of 
agriculture in certain countries, in con- 
trast with the industries of their 
neighbours, which have deliberately 
sacrificed their agricultural activities. 
Major joint undertakings, coproduc- 
tions and concerted exports bring 
substantial opportunities for overcom- 
ing inequalities in the relationship bet- 
ween agriculture and industry. These 
preliminary experiments ought to lead 
to a joint effort to establish agro- 
industrial areas where, through con- 
certed action, powerful plurinational 
industrial groups would encourage 
agriculture (whether backward or mak- 
ing technical progress) to produce 
commodities for export to the less 
developed countries of the East and to 
African and Asian countries wanting 
food products that have been process- 
ed to a greater or lesser degree. 
An enlightened strategy should 
dovetail with this trend. Such a 
strategy will be preferable to a gran- 
diose programme of transfers and in- 
dustrial sharing whereby labour- 
intensive industries would be allotted 
to the developing countries and 
capital-intensive industries based on 
extensive scientific and technical 
knowledge would remain in the in- 
dustrially developed countries. in spite 
of the revolutionary trappings of such a 
 
“Flaws in the relationship between industry and agriculture {...) are 
at the heart of the structural crisis of our time. By virtue of their 
technical, organizational, informational and financial superiority, in- 
dustries dominate agriculture and in a sense take it over. In the in- 
dustrialized countries the success of the agro-food industry suggests 
that this inequality is being corrected, although there is still room for 
improvement.”” Right, grain elevators on the Canadian prairies.

programme, it seems to us to be 
dangerously conservative. It tends to 
create and maintain a kind of institu- 
tionalized preference which benefits 
the industrialized countries. High- 
technology and highly-capitalized in- 
dustries are most likely in the long run 
to dominate labour-intensive in- 
dustries. This is certainly not the inten- 
tion of those who advocate such a 
system, but the inequality of vast 
groups, globally and doctrinally 
specialized, may aggravate or 
perpetuate domination by those who 
possess industries based on the latest 
technologies. In point of fact, the 
developing countries are striving to 
create, as far as their means permit, 
complex industries. For the develop- 
ment of their national economies, they 
are certainly right. 
In addition to the advantages of in- 
ternal development, this option, if 
followed successfully, provides an op- 
portunity to become competitive with 
the industrially developed countries in 
selected fields through inventive 
specialization and by drawing benefit 
from their relatively low wage-levels. 
Certain developing countries have 
received, as a result of outside invest- 
ment and the activities of the multi- 
nationals, a structure which does not 
meet the fundamental needs and 
aspirations of their people. A long-term 
strategy would permit or encourage an 
autochthonous industrialization which 
would correct these deviations 
without recourse to protectionism or 
blinkered nationalism; it would restruc- 
ture them in accordance with the 
wishes of those who are most closely 
concerned. 
Other developing countries have 
been purely and simply colonized: their 
policy of independence can only be 
asserted by an industrialization 
strategy which provides them with a 
weight in international negotiations 
which neither their new juridical status 
nor the numbers of votes in interna- 
tional organizations could give them. 
The current crisis springs from struc- 
tural inequalities; efforts to overcome 
it call for new structures on a world 
scale. Efforts in this direction go 
beyond spontaneous market forces 
and the intercompatibility of markets, 
implying functional and regional 
organizations and the search for an 
overall organization which can ar- 
ticulate them with a view to economic 
efficiency and social quality. 
Finance too is structured. Except for 
the specialized public institutions, 
financial organisms are oligopolies. In 
the United Kingdom there are the Big 
Five; in France, the Big Three (formerly 
the Big Seven). These monopolistic 
enterprises engage in sharp competi- 
tion or form relatively stable 
agreements with each other and in 
relation to economic monopolies. 
Within a given nation and at world 
level, the money market evokes a 
meeting of giants and makes nonsense 
of the image of tiny units obediently 
following the ‘“neutral’’ law of prices 
and interest. 
With the exception of the oil- 
producing countries, financial power is 
in the hands of the industrialized coun- 
tries. It is exercised in the case of self- 
financing, the incurring of debts to the 
banking system and the issue of long- 
term loans. Thus we should forget the 
idea of a reservoir of money or quasi- 
money responding obediently and in- 
evitably to undifferentiated market 
demands. In this field too, the real 
situation is that of Adam Smith's 
“tacit coalition of masters’’; it con- 
tinually exercises pressure on the»

» behaviour of the Small, whether they 
be businesses or nations. 
In the commodity trade, the law of 
compared anticipated costs product by 
product, supplies a solution which is 
correct in abstract terms. The trouble 
is that here too the struggle between 
monopolies and their groups is the 
general rule, and it is practically im- 
possible to forecast future compared 
costs. Those who hold financial power 
are liable to make mistakes, the effects 
of which are aggravated by the extent 
of concentrated supply of and demand 
for credit and by the spreading out over 
a long period of commitments and 
dates at which payments are due. As 
the defects which occur at one point 
are propagated through banking and 
financial networks, which are highly 
complek, always sensitive and 
become nervous as soon as the first 
signs of difficulty arise, the germs of 
financial crises appear to be inherent in 
developed and innovative industrial 
systems. The importance of major 
enterprises and nations leads to a call 
to ‘reason; their collapse would be a 
disaster for everyone. 
The instability of financial capital 
and its last-minute rescue raise serious 
questions. 
When a developing country is 
criticized for its over ambitious plans, 
who is really being blamed? The coun- 
try itself as a whole, or the multina- 
tional companies and financial groups 
which have established themselves in 
it? The tax for economic recovery will 
fall on all the citizens, but did their legal 
representatives play an effective role 
in taking the decisions which are 
criticized? 
On the other hand the disasters of 
the financial crisis are avoided because 
the money, the currency, and quasi 
currency were available. Why and by 
whose decision are they only brought 
into play as a last resort? Would the 
general interest not be better served by 
prompt action? Is it politically desirable 
to give the impression that finance on- 
ly comes out into the open when and 
how it chooses? 
Constant experience shows that to- 
day's changing financial situation is 
largely in the hands of Central Banks 
and Governments which decide on a 
budget deficit. The economic brakes 
which date from the end of the nine- 
teenth century have so far slackened 
that they have lost most of their 
effectiveness. 
The cumulative effects are wide- 
spread. The key currency (by definition 
it is always to some extent dominant), 
today the dollar, reaches levels which 
cannot be explained in terms of com- 
mercial exchanges, while its fluctua- 
tions are connected with speculative 
capital movements sheltered by the 
principle of non-intervention. 
The excessively high interest rates in 
the United States and the gloomy pro- 
cession of rates which follow in their 
wake can only be explained in terms of 
anticipations which are totally alien to 
classical norms. When the community 
expects an increase in money supply, 
high interest rates may increase de- 
mand for bank finance instead of 
reducing it. 
The burden of indebtedness on 
financial costs and the reduction of 
gross anticipated profit margins 
reduce the growth rate and, in the 
worst cases, involve the liquidation of 
assets. There is nothing mechanical or 
automatic about these linkages, no 
more than there is in debt repayment, 
the positive effects of which may 
herald an economically justified in- 
crease in product. But the resulting 
contagious and cumulative difficulties 
of payment may call forintervention by 
the Central Bank and the Treasury. 
The amount of distress caused by 
. these sequences of events varies 
widely between the developing coun- 
tries and the developed countries. The 
cyclical movements of the last century 
showed that it is always the unprivileg- 
ed classes which bear the brunt of 
recessions and contractions. Is it false 
to extend such an observation to the 
nations of the world? 
H Francois Perroux 
**A trend reversal which will restore to the developing countries their capacity to produce food to satisfy domestic demand, by reduc- 
ing the emphasis on export-directed agriculture or redirecting it, is a necessary task which is bound to take a long time. It calls for 
a restructuring which conflicts with the immediate interests of the established industries,’ Peanuts ready for export, Kano, Nigeria.

### 58048: Is crime a universal concept?

Is crime 
a universal concept? 
HAT is culture? Is a *‘culti- 
vated’’ person more, or less like- 
ly, to become a criminal? Al- 
though any definition of a word limits, nar- 
rows and fossilizes its semantic content, I 
would be inclined to define culture as the 
sum total of the commonplaces, prejudices, 
value judgments and conceptual auto- 
matisms to be found in a human group oc- 
cupying a particular place at a certain 
period, and accumulated by experience in 
the course of its history. 
The fact is that 2a human group in a par- 
ticular geo-climatic area creates a set of 
relationships between the individuals who 
compose it, although it is unaware of the 
many factors that enter into this creative 
process. These relationships are achieved 
through language and behaviour patterns 
belonging to the group in question and 
which in turn are conditioned by the geo- 
climatic area in which they occur. These 
relationships become institutionalized in 
written laws, customs and concepts which 
reflect automatisms that have been learned, 
transmitted and reproduced from one 
generation to the next. 
A criminal is someone who transgresses 
these laws, This amounts to saying that he 
who is a criminal in one place will not 
necessarily be one elsewhere. The criminal 
is defined by the cultural code of behaviour. 
In one place, the individual who expresses 
opinions at variance with the State’s 
ideology is regarded as psychotic and 
perverse and is locked up and treated with 
drugs, whereas elsewhere the individual 
whose behaviour does not conform to the 
idea of property is regarded as delinquent 
and perverse and is subjected to the same 
kind of treatment. The only difference is in 
the code and the scale of values. 
Now, it is interesting to note that legally 
the criminal is someone who attacks per- 
sons, but also goods, and that persons are 
themselves generally regarded as goods or 
private property.

“Amongst animals (...) the dominating being no longer has occasion to be aggressive 
and violent as long as his dominant status is not contested, because the dominated par- 
ties will have learned to their cost the rules of behaviour which must not be broken; they 
will, as it were, have learned the ‘culture’ of the group or species. The hierarchies of 
domination amongst men have been based on the same laws since the beginning of the

The idea of property is never called into 
question. It is accepted as forming part of 
man’s “‘essence’’, and this is done without 
any attempts to ascertain its historical or 
. geographical origins or to consider what 
mechanism in man’s nervous system has 
made it possible for the idea of property to 
be given expression. And yet, certain 
societies and “‘cultures’’ have never known 
property and even today there are still a few 
which are capable of ignoring it. It can be 
proved by experiment that the idea of pro-p

» perty is not innate or instinctive, but is 
learnt. Indeed if it were instinctive, must 
man not ‘‘control his instincts’’? Perhaps, 
but only if the latter are harmful to the iden- 
tity and cohesion of the group, in other 
words if they do not conform to the code of 
behaviour institutionalized by the domi- 
nant element. 
It would take too long here to examine 
the biological laws, complex but capable of 
simplification, which regulate the activity 
of a human nervous system in a social situa- 
tion. Suffice it to say that the sole function 
of a nervous system'is to permit action and 
that, in man, thought only enables action to 
be made more effective. A nervous system 
thus permits an individual to control! his liv- 
ing conditions in the space surrounding 
him. If this space were empty, action would 
be unnecessary. But it contains objects and 
living beings, and an organism’s contact 
with these will be favourable or un- 
favourable to what may be called (with 
great caution) the maintenance of its 
biological ‘‘equilibrium’’. The sole raison 
d’étre of a being is to be, otherwise there 
would be no beings. Therefore he learns 
very quickly from experience that contact 
with some of these objects and beings is 
gratifying and that contact with others is 
painful, dangerous and harmful to his well- 
being. He will remember this experience 
and will try to reproduce the gratifying ex- 
perience, whereas he will avoid disagreeable 
experience or, if he cannot, will try to 
destroy its cause. But if, within the same 
space, another individual of the same 
species who has himself had the same ex- 
perience wishes to enjoy the same objects 
and the same beings, both of them will say 
‘they are mine’’ and a contest will take 
place between them for the desired objects 
or beings. Amongst animals, the stronger 
one, or the one born of 2a dominant female, 
will be more likely to assert his domination 
and to seize the gratifying good. 
The hierarchical scales of ascendancy will. 
be established on this theme, which we have 
presented in an extremely simplified form, 
for it has many different modalities. The 
dominating being will no longer have occa- 
sion to be aggressive and violent as long as 
his dominant status is not contested, 
because the dominated parties will have 
learned to their cost the rules of behaviour 
which must not be broken; they will have, 
as it were, learned the ‘culture’ of the 
group or species. : 
"The concept of personal or group 
ownership of gratifying goods, 
which according to many 
prehistorians arose about 6000 
BC, was accompanied by the 
emergence of criminality between 
individuals and States, in other 
words, war.’’ Right, Cain Kills Abel

The hierarchies of domination amongst 
men have been based on the same laws since 
the beginning of the neolithic age, when 
they settled on the land and agriculture and 
animal husbandry enabled them to avoid 
famine and, by laying up reserves of 
beneficial goods—grains and live 
animals—to have no further fears for their 
immediate biological welfare. Then came 
vocational specialization, and urban socie- 
ty, a more complex body than the primitive 
clan, made its appearance. This transfor- 
mation took place over thousands of years 
during which human groups that were 
technically less developed but were compos- 
ed of hunters still skilled in the use of arms, 
colonized these neolithic groups in order to 
benefit from their technical advances. 
The population growth resulting from 
“this ‘“‘economic’ evolution induced these 
groups, which had become hierarchically 
organized (chief, warriors, craftsmen, 
farmers) to sally forth and conquer ter- 
ritories elsewhere which might increase 
their resources. The concept of personal or 
group ownership of gratifying goods, which 
according to many prehistorians arose at 
this stage of the history of man, i.e. about 
6000 BC, was accompanied by the 
emergence of criminality between in- 
dividuals and States, in other words, war. 
Whenever the basic motivation is the im- 
mediate survival of the group in a hostile 
environment, co-operation is more essential 
than crime. 
The human brain gave special features to 
the creation of hierarchies and to the means 
of establishing forms of domination. 
Owing to certain associative cortical zones, 
only the human species was capable of 
associating previous experiences in an 
original manner in an ‘‘imagined’’ context 
and therefore of producing working 
hypotheses and ' creating new forms by 
transforming, first of all matter, then, more 
recently, energy. Thus the species was able 
to protect itself with ever greater efficacy 
through a progressively better under- 
standing of the laws governing the in- 
animate world.

“The essential means of establishing relations of domination amongst peoples was the 
discovery of the principal laws governing the inanimate world, which led to the produc-

“From the very beginning 
men were plunged into an in- 
comprehensible, fearful world 
for which they had no rules of 
action. They have made 
remarkable efforts to in- 
troduce some form of 
coherent order into it, which 
"have resulted in the discovery

Spoken language, followed by writing, 
both of which also resulted from the 
phylogenic evolution of this “imagining” 
brain, enabled the generations to transmit 
their experiences in time and to accumulate 
them, very slowly at the outset, then in an 
ever more rapid and sophisticated manner, 
up to the point where our modern means of 
communication shrink time and therefore 
also space. 
“‘Cultures’’ were established and evolved 
at the same speed as that of technical pro- 
gress. It was the latter that enabled 
marketable goods to be created which could 
be exchanged with other human groups at 
ever greater distances in space. The essen- 
tial means -of establishing relations of 
domination amongst peoples was the 
discovery of the principal laws governing 
the inanimate world, which led to the pro- 
duction of greater quantities and varieties 
of marketable goods and of more efficient 
arms to conquer new territories for 
exploitation. 
At the group level, the aristocratic power 
of the warrior was replaced by that of the 
bourgeois who controlled the means of pro- 
duction and trade, which in turn gave way 
to that of the technocrat who invents pro- 
ductive machinery and of the bureaucrat 
who manages production relations. 
Thus the means may have changed, but 
the objective remains the same—the 
establishment of dominant positions in 
order to obtain beneficial goods, of which 
the ideal image which the individual forms 
of himself is not the least. Only in the 
physical sciences has progress been achiev- 
ed. As far as the living world, especially the 
world that lives within us, is concerned, we 
have not evolved since the beginning of the 
neolithic period. Biology, especially that of 
our nervous system, which expresses itself 
in our modes of behaviour, is only in its 
infancy. 
During all this time, men were speaking. 
From the very beginning they were plunged 
into an incomprehensible, fearful world, 
for they had no rules of action. They have 
made remarkable efforts to introduce some 
form of coherent order into it. Convinced 
that they were subjects apart in this world 
because of what they called their ‘‘reflective 
conscience” and their belief in their liberty, 
in order to hide the anxiety caused by lack 
of information and which frustrated effec- 
tive action, they had to invent the laws and 
rules which dictate their actions. These were 
the myths, religions, moralities and State 
laws. 
Henceforth, since they no longer had to 
ask themselves what they should do, their 
anxiety was partly hidden. Nevertheless it 
continued to be a fundamental anxiety, not 
for their liberty which existed only in their 
imagination but which validated respon- 
sibility, but rather anxiety due to their ig- 
norance, especially when confronted with 
death. 
Thus “cultures”, infinite in variety and 
number, fulfilled only one function in their 
attempts to become established in 
languages—to co-ordinate the actions of in- 
dividuals within a human group, in other 
words, to give permanent form to the struc- 
ture of the group. We have already shown 
how and why, since neolithic times, in the »

» world’s temperate zones, this structure had 
always been a hierarchical structure of 
domination. Nevertheless language was a 
splendid means of communication and 
therefore a remarkable means of action. By 
and through language we could influence 
the action of others in favour of our gratify- 
ing projects. Through language, inhibitions 
to action could be dealt with, the anxiety 
resulting from such inhibitions could be 
eliminated and a biological equilibrium 
established. As a result, that aggressiveness 
between individuals, which is the only 
resort open to those who cannot make 
themselves heard, diminished. 
If therefore, as world statistics show, 
criminality between individuals has declin- 
ed considerably in recent centuries, con- 
trary to whatthe mass media try to make us 
believe, it is perhaps because literacy and 
the use of language have become so 
generalized that, as the French sociologist 
Jean-Michel Bessette has been able to 
demonstrate on the basis of reliable 
statistics, crime is now confined to those 
who are incapable of expressing themselves, 
or who can only give inadequate expression 
to what they have to say. 
But, whereas language is a means of ac- 
tion for the individual, for the social group 
it is most frequently a pretext for violence. 
Logical discourse has always provided 
‘““good’’ reasons to defend a ‘‘good’’ cause 
by war, genocide and torture. Language has 
always made it possible to justify raison 
d'état. When we pass from the inter- 
individual level of organization to that of 
the State, the purpose of language changes. 
Now this intangible abstract structure 
called the State is merely the legalized in- 
stitutionalization of the hierarchical rela- 
tionships of domination between the in- 
dividuals who compose it. The individual 
may not infringe certain pre-established 
rules in order to commit a murder, whereas 
the State has every right to kill, either within 
the group in order to preserve the rules 
establishing the hierarchies of domination, 
or outside it, against another State trying to 
establish its domination over it or over 
which it seeks to establish its own 
domination. 
Thus it seems that it is not culture or 
criminality and the relationships between 
them that should be studied, but the finality 
of the social groups and the central nervous 
mechanisms which enable individuals to 
establish relationships between each other, 
the establishment of forms of domination 
in terms of this finality. 
Probably the readiness with which the 
mass media report interindividual crimes is 
merely a response to the needs of States to 
have their own crimes forgotten and to 
create a state of anxiety which thrusts the 
“‘citizen’’ into their arms. These arms are 
the army and the police which protect per- 
sons and property according to a set of rules 
that form the distinguishing features of a 
“culture’’. The latter is always the culture 
of the dominant elements, that is to say of 
those who submit to the finality of the 
system because they benefit from it. 
The immigrant problem is an example. 
Whenever their labour is needed to produce 
goods, because machines have not yet com- 
pletely replaced man in his most ‘‘ther- 
modynamic’’ activities, they are welcome. 
But when machines are invented which can 
perform these mechanical tasks and this 
leads to increased unemployment, these im- 
migrants take away from the citizen the re- 
maining mechanical tasks. They deprive 
him of the benefit of remunerated work. 
They must be got rid of. The cultural shock 
which is often invoked thus seems to be 
secondary. 
Are our immigrants more criminally in- 
clined than we, the ‘““natives’’, are? They 
would seem to have every reason to be so— 
their inability to make full use of the same 
language and therefore to influence others 
through it, the fact that it is impossible for 
them to have an ideal image of themselves 
which could vie with that of the natives even 
when the latter are at the bottom of the 
social ladder and the resultant subjection, 
not to laws or to a ‘‘culture”, but primarily 
to a form of domination that is reflected in 
the native’s attitude of exclusion and con- 
tempt. In a period of economic crisis, the 
immigrant becomes a scapegoat—some- 
body has to be found outside the social 
group, ‘‘somebody else”’, who can be made 
responsible for its misfortunes. 
As far as the number of victims is con- 
cerned, there is no comparison between 
casual crimes and road accidents. The latter 
are regarded as normal and, as it were, 
‘‘healthy’’, because they are a result of 
economic development. It is the former 
which receive attention, because they 
enable individual members of the group to 
see themselves as belonging to a chosen race 
or elite. By banishing the criminal into 
outer darkness, they ensure the cohesion of 
the group through the flattering image 
which each member of it has of himself 
because he belongs to the group. As the 
French author Fernand Gregh wrote, 
““There are no wicked, there are only those 
who suffer’. 
The innumerable factors of suffering in 
the case of the criminal can all be put down 
to a single biological law—the inhibition of 
his gratifying action. We think we have pro- 
duced sufficient experimental proofs in re- 
cent years that this reality embraces the 
whole of pathology including that of 
behaviour. Violence amongst individuals is 
the violence of those who are not heard, 
whose voice is lost in the background noise 
of the socio-culture, those for whom the 
ultimate form of violence may be suicide, 
which is tolerated by the social group 
because its forces usually arrive too late to 
prevent it and it does not compromise the 
cohesion of the group. But to prove this 
statement our study must begin with the 
molecule and end at the level of the species. 
In fact, every expert who has studied 
violence and described its ‘‘causes’ has 
done so only at the level of organization 
covered by his speciality. The politician, the 
economist, the sociologist, the an- 
thropologist, the psychologist, the 
psychiatrist, the philosopher and in more 
recent times the ethologist, the 
behaviourist, the neuro-physiologist and 
the biochemist have all provided excellent 
explanatory reasons in an outmoded system 
of linear causality. It is high time for these 
studies to be combined into a coherent 
“system” according to inclusive and in- 
cluded levels of organization, which must 
have regard to the essential instrument of 
expression of violence, namely, the human 
nervous system, and to what we already 
know about its biochemical, anatomical 
and functional structure wherever this 
structure is placed in a social situation. We 
must even take the history of our species in- 
to consideration in our efforts to under- 
stand the problem. We must also avoid any 
facile solution based on innateness, on an 
“‘essence’’ of man, on instincts which are 
always available, depending on the ideology 
which inspires the speaker (i.e. the express- 
ion of the unconscious automatized in a 
““culture”’) to serve as an alibi for State 
violence or as an excuse or condemnation of 
individual violence. 
But in our opinion it is essential not to 
mix the levels of organization. Each level 
has its own structure which should not be 
superimposed by analogy on to the over- 
lying or underlying level. Above all, the 
structural and functional links which con- 
nect them must be identified, care being 
taken not to turn words into tangible ob- 
jects. One can touch one’s father, one’s 
brother, one’s friends, but one cannot 
touch the family, the State, the mother 
country, because they are not things but 
abstract which personify a 
structure. 
Now a structure consists of all the rela- 
tionships existing between the elements of a 
whole, and a relationship cannot be touch- 
ed. It is neither matter nor energy, it is in- 
formation which is given a form. Thus, a 
nation may be understood as a structure or 
a set of relationships uniting the individuals 
who live in a given geoclimatic space and 
who in the course of time have invented a 
““culture’’, that is a language and a form of 
behaviour which are effective within this 
space. But instead of allowing this 
‘regional’ structure to decide for itself 
what type of economic, political and 
cultural relationships it wants to have with 
the encompassing system (regional self- 
sufficiency is no longer conceivable 
nowadays) why inflict upon it the rules of 
behaviour of the encompassing system, the 
State which, as we have already said, is the 
expression of a hierarchical structure of 
aristocratic, theocratic, bourgeois, 
technocratic or bureaucratic domination? 
Why teach black children that their 
ancestors were the Gauls when the Bretons 
are being forbidden to use Breton? 
concepts 
It does seem that one must be profoundly 
regionalist in order to be truly interna- 
tionalist and a citizen of the world, just as 
one must be profoundly individualist in 
order to admit that one’s neighbour is 
different.

### 58049: Culture shock and criminality

Culture shock 
and criminality 
ISTORY offers few better ex- 
H amples -of the link between ac- 
culturation and criminality than 
the trial by Francisco Pizarro, the con- 
queror of Peru, of Atahualpa, the last 
sovereign of the Incas. Atahualpa was 
sentenced to death for the proven crimes of 
idolatry, incest, polygamy and subversion. 
He died without understanding what it was 
all about. For him, his legitimate wife had 
to be his sister, he was incapable of conceiv- 
ing that there could be superior gods to his 
own and he had never heard of a higher 
king against whom he could rebel. A change 
in the terms of reference had transformed 
what was normal or even pious and sacred 
into a capital crime. 
Atahualpa’s condemnation symbolizes 
what an encounter between two cultures 
can lead to, and how criminality can emerge 
from the conflict between them. At the 
dawn of American history (as Westerners 
would put it) acculturation was a massive 
social process imposed by a colonialist 
minority on an indigenous majority, and it 
was started by outlawing the latter’s 
culture. 
As a general rule, whenever acculturation 
is at issue it is regarded as something that 
affects only non-Westerners. The 
Westerner brings his own culture along with 
him and imposes it. Many people still find 
it difficult to regard the excesses of col- 
onialism as crimes. For long, Western 
violations of the rights of so-called 
primitive societies (once I was corrected and 
told that it was anachronistic to speak of the 
“rights of primitive societies’’) were not 
treated as crimes. The term used was 
“‘civilizing process’’. 
Since the eighteenth century, when Vico 
and Herder put forward the idea of a 
universal history led by progress, with 
Europe at its head, the West has allowed 
itself to break all the laws of the non- 
Western peoples in the name of progress. 
To consider this a crime would have seemed 
as strange as to describe as a thief the ar- 
chaeologist who removed Aztec antiquities 
to the great museums of the West. The, 
Third World has no ‘property’, only 
““treasures’’ and they were not “‘stolen’’ but

‘“‘/discovered’’. They were res nullius, they 
belonged to no one. 
Nowadays there are other massive ac- 
culturation processes which do not involve 
the movement of colonists overseas but 
take place in the metropolitan countries 
themselves, in industrial centres or—as is 
more frequently the case—on the outskirts 
.of the big cities of the West. These are the 
acculturation processes of the immigrant. 
Even now the term acculturation is still 
understood to be a one-way process. Like 
the notion of exoticism (1) it is not 
reciprocal but denotes only that which is 
strange to a Westerner. This disparity is still 
maintained. In many Third World coun- 
tries acculturation of the European does 
not arise because his status depends upon 
his being European. The identities of 
““bwana’® or  ‘‘sahib’®> are not 
criminogenous and do not imply a deprecia- 
tion of a person’s identity but rather its 
enhancement. In Latin America there are 
even compact European colonies, regular 
enclaves in which not only is the mother 
country’s culture preserved but the writ of 
an extra-territorial law runs. 
Depending on the ability of the two 
cultures to communicate, the cultural shock 
will vary in violence and in the scope for 
dialogue. In practice, cultural relations 
seem to operate better at a distance, in the 
form of occasional exchanges of exhibitions 
and theatrical performances rather than in 
the form of everyday dialogue in the ghettos 
of great industrial cities. In France and the 
Federal Republic of Germany, host coun- 
tries to large immigrant populations, the 
cultural shock is less violent for a Spaniard 
or Portuguese than for a North African and 
greater for an immigrant of rural origin 
than for one of urban middle-class 
background. 
In fact, acculturation presupposes the ex- 
istence of a dominant society and con- 
sequently a depreciation of the culture of 
origin. This is accelerated by two sets of cir- 
cumstances which are frequently linked to 
each other in the country of adoption, 
namely, the processes of civic assimilation 
and legal marginalization. Essentially the 
civic assimilation process occurs in the 
second generation through the education 
system and life in the urban community. 
Marginality results from a chronic feeling 
of insecurity and uncertainty about the 
future. It is certainly economic in character 
but it is also largely legal, being associated 
with such events as the renewal of residence 
and work permits and especially with the 
threat of expulsion. 
The result of this depreciation of the 
culture of origin, to which must be added in 
many cases racial prejudice, incomprehen- 
sion, intolerance and, generally, all the dif-

ficulties of coexistence, is that cultural iden- 
tity becomes a matter of questioning in- 
stead of self-acceptance. The response to 
this questioning will be either a search for 
identity or flight from it. 
The search for identity is often reflected 
in an obstinate attachment to the culture of 
origin, which is idealized, especially by the 
second generation which did not know it in 
situ. Material links with the homeland are 
tenaciously maintained or renewed, houses 
are bought in the native village and holidays 
are spent there, the journey home being 
made in a big car whose importance is less 
as a means of transport than as a success 
symbol with which to impress the folks at 
home. This ritual is important because it 
enables the emigrant to recover the esteem 
of his former neighbours, even if it is only 
in a remote, forgotten village. 
This attachment is also manifested in 
exile in the form of an exaggerated love of 
traditional customs. From time to time 
religious ceremonies, celebrations, and 
traditional dishes enable the immigrant, 
like Antaeus, to recover his strength by 
symbolically treading his native soil. This 
form of behaviour, typical of the first 
generation, contributes to deferring the 
conflict of identity to their children and 
even to their grandchildren. The identity 
problem, which is faced by all adolescents, 
is particularly acute for the young im- 
migrant, who has to assert himself both in 
the host country and in his family group.’ 
In their obstinate attachment to the coun- 
try of their birth, immigrants do not realize 
that customs change rapidly and that they 
themselves become cultural anachronisms, 
isolated colonies perpetuating models that 
. are already obsolete. 
By changing his social milieu the im- 
migrant loses the reference group in which 
~ his identity was recognized, and even if he 
does his best to behave in accordance with 
the norms of the host country, his per- 
sonality is called into question because of 
the culture difference. This is felt as an in- 
justice, leads to a sense of insecurity and 
may provoke reactions of various kinds in 
the individual concerned. It may lead him 
to seek a compromise and to assume a 
chameleon-like identity. Typical of this is 
the Muslim who observes Qur’anic rules at 
home but eats pork and drinks wine with his 
workmates in the canteen. On the other 
hand it may cause him to become ag- 
gressive. But especially it may lead him into 
a situation of fundamental uncertainty as 
regards social. models because he will 
discover the lack of coherence between the 
host culture and his own, and this may pro- 
duce in him an attitude of hostility to all 
value systems. He then finds himself in a

» poses the question of the criminal inten- 
"tions of the individual in a state of cultural 
transition who commits an offence of this 
kind. 
Another, much more dramatic, example 
concerns certain communities where the 
father makes an attempt on the life of his 
daughter because she has broken the rules 
of premarital chastity. For the father the 
essential matter is to purge the disgrace and 
save the family’s honour, an action which 
courts in his society treat with considerable 
leniency, whereas in the West it is an ex- 
tremely serious offence. Is the fact that the 
offender was complying with the code of his 
culture of origin taken into account? Is the 
question asked what kind of behaviour 
should be expected of the individual con- 
cerned? The problem is how to determine 
precisely the degree of culpability of this 
cultural nomad, who has not absorbed the 
system of values of the host society. 
On the other hand, where the criminality 
of the immigrant is concerned it should be 
pointed out that the acculturation problem 
must be considered in conjunction with 
other criminogenous circumstances which 
affect society as a whole, such as social and 
economic factors and the urban problem. 
Many young offenders come from ghetto 
communities. The formation of gangs leads 
to early delinquency, often only occasional 
but always dramatized and socially inaccep- 
table. It has also been established that ghet- 
tos favour recidivism. This group delin- 
quency offers a solution to the problem of 
flight from identity. The ghetto enables a 
second generation which feels completely 
marginal to respond to the questioning 
mentioned above by forming itself into a 
cohesive minority. 
.Broadly speaking, criminality through 
acculturation occurs only in two kinds of 
circumstances—where it is a product of two 
systems of social images in which one of 
them prohibits what the other permits or 
even commands, and where it is a product 
of cultural transition and the psychological 
factors created by the latter. In any case it 
must be observed that in spite of these addi- 
tional difficulties the incidence of criminali- 
ty does not seem to be significantly higher 
amongst immigrants than amongst the 
native population. 
But does this exhaust the subject of 
criminality through acculturation? Up to 
now we have considered only the case of the 
foreigner. But how should we classify 
racialist crimes committed against im- 
migrant workers? Are they also attributable 
to acculturation? At least they reflect a con- 
flictual shock between two cultures. 
Cultural dialogue between societies living 
side by side, dialogue with minorities, 
presupposes—much more so than the 
dialogue at a distance to which we referred 
earlier—a modification of social images, 
not only on the-part of the minorities but on 
that of society as a whole; otherwise 
minorities will eventually become unaccep- 
table. There seems to be a tendency for 
migrants to settle permanently in the host 
country. This involves a fundamental 
change in ideas about ‘‘the Other”’, about 
one’s neighbours, and more directly, a cam-

through acculturation otherwise than as the 
result of the failure of a society to integrate 
an exogenous group while at the same time 
protecting the latter’s right to its own iden- 
tity. Any integration policy raises a series of 
questions which do not so much demand 
answers as point to a number of certainties. 
It is inconceivable, for instance, that young 
people of the second generation of im- 
migrants should feel threatened by expul- 
sion to a country of origin they have never 
known, Equally unacceptable is any action 
aimed at imposing conformity on another’s 
culture in the name of ideals or slogans 
which are completely alien to it, such as 
feminism or ecology, however relevant 
these movements may be in the host 
country. 
The fact is that only a culturally pluralist 
society can provide an answer to these ques- 
tions, and only insofar as it eschews 
dogmatic models. Cultural pluralism in the 
sense of respect for regional and immigrant 
cultures is something which the developed 
world must preserve. External colonialism, 
now a thing of the past, must not be replac- 
ed by colonialist policies towards 
minorities. It is inadmissible that the sole 
logic and reason of history should be 
economic growth, which seeks higher 
returns by uniformizing society. 
But pluralism implies that ghettos, isola- 
tion and cultural enclaves must be avoided 
tod. To ensure this, minorities must par- 
ticipate on equal terms in the organization 
of society as a whole. How can this be 
achieved? Perhaps by recognizing their 
political rights. 
Apart from this, we should not overlook 
the real or potential importance of the 
growth of hybrid creative activities, 
especially when they succeed in ridding 
themselves of the clichés that are castrating 
them. They are one kind of response from 
those young people who are looking for 
new models. In practice, these models 
reflect the conflict between the big city and 
the Third World, like that of the 
Rastafarians (2) or their marginality, even 
in the legal sense. The most popular musical 
group founded by North Africans in France 
is called “‘Carte de Séjour’ (Residence 
Permit). 
This hybrid creative activity forms part 
of the mental decolonization process, and 
will become increasingly necessary as the in- 
habitants of the big cities of the West come 
into ever closer contact with the Third 
World, not by crossing the Ocean but in the 
suburbs of their cities. It will be conducted 
by the immigrant, not through servile ac- 
ceptance of the values of the host society 
but by realizing that he is creating new 
values with them. But it also implies aban- 
doning the illusion that the values of the 
past can be preserved, and understanding 
that the past can only be preserved as a fer- 
ment to develop the roots of a future 
identity. 
The West, for its part, will be able to ac- 
cept and contribute to this hybrid creativity 
only when it abandons its paternalistic 
universalism, retaining of it only that ele- 
ment which does not oppress the im- 
migrant; when it takes notice of the 
deleterious effects of its culture; when it 
ceases to deify itself and to treat as 
backward those societies which are ex- 
periencing acculturation; and when it stops 
killing Atahualpa merely because he is 
Atahualpa.

period of four years. Preparations are in 
hand for a preliminary symposium, to be 
attended by twenty-five international ex- 
perts, at which the new teaching formula 
and its relationship with the cultural 
heritage of each country will be examin- 
ed. The French composer Michel Fano 
has said of Julia Stilman’s musical works 
that "marked by a remarkable manipula- 
tion of timbre, they carry the attentive 
listener into a new and impassioned 
realm of poetry.’ The US choreographer 
Carolyn Carlson is to give a presentation 
of Stilman’s Barcarola, a cantata for 
soloists, chorus and orchestra on a poem 
by Pablo Neruda, at the music and dance 
festival La Rochelle 84.

The concept of development brings out a 
major paradox of our era: the desire for pro- 
gress and mistrust of its consequences. Francois 
| Perroux, a leading political economist whose 
innovative thinking has made a major con- 
tribution to development studies, aims in this 
work to analyse the ideas and theories pro- 
pounded by an economic approach to develop- 
ment and to clarify the meaning and direction
