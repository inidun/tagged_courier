WHEN TIBETAN EY 
ARE SMILING 
  
DP Photos by Michael Amendolia; Text by Mohan Bir Thapa 
Thanks to ingenious and inexpensive surgery, a Nepalese doctor has brought vision 
to thousands of people in Tibet, which suffers one of the world’s highest rates of cataract 
blindness

Mohan Bir Tapa is Chief Editor, Today magazine, 
Kathmandu, Nepal. 
gonga about four hours east of Lhasa en 
route toTibet’s famous Ganden monas- 
tery, Dr. Sanduk Ruit had a chance, four years 
ago, to savour one of the sweeter fruits of his 
work. It was on that occasion that a well-dres- 
sed woman in her early 40s approached him 
offering the traditional kadha (white scarf) 
and chhurpi (dried cheese). 
As it happened, she was the same woman 
upon whom Dr. Ruit, a Nepalese opthal- 
mologist who has caused a stir in Tibet, had 
operated two years previously. At that time, 
she had been totally blind as the result of a 
cataract, which is a cloudy patch over the lens 
B While staying at a small hotel in Meta- of the eye. Her husband had left her when 
she had become totally blind and she was 
living like an animal. Dr. Ruit’s operation 
had enabled her not only to regain her vision, 
but also to regain her dignity and financial 
well-being. The woman told the doctor she 
was now back with her family. 
Over the past 15 years,45-year-old Dr 
Ruit has performed 20,000 cataract ope- 
rations, each time replacing the damaged 
natural lens with a plastic intraocular lens, 
an approach dating from the 1980s when it 
was popularized by Australian eye surgeon 
Fred Hollows,Dr. Ruit’s teacher.

eye 1s washed, then a local anaesthetic 1s 
applied below the lower eyelid. The clouded 
interior of the lens 1s removed through a tiny 
incision, and finally the intraocular lens is 
inserted into the empty lens capsule. 
For centuries, until around the 1950s, 
Tibetans are believed to have practised cou- 
ching, an operation which involves remo- 
ving the clouded part of the lens but which 
provides no replacement. 
With Dr. Ruit’s surgery, which 1s vir- 
tually painless, bandages covering the eye 
can be removed within a day. From being 
able to see only vague outlines of objects at 
first, within weeks patients are able to enjoy 
full eyesight. HB 
  
  
 
Choki (centre) arrives at the eye clinic in Gucho 
(Tibet). She wears glasses but is completely blind.   
Dr Nyini screens patients in a makeshift surgery in 
Gucho. 
» in Kathmandu where Dr. Ruit works today, 
Hollows developed high quality intraocular 
lenses for an affordable $7 each, making 
the operation economically feasible in deve- 
loping countries. 
The development was a godsend for 
Tibet, an autonomous region of China that 
nestles on the border with Nepal. Tibet has 
perhaps the world’s highest incidence of cata- 
racts,partly because Tibetans live in one of 
the world’s highest inhabited regions. As alti- 
tude increases, so does exposure to ultra-vio- 
let radition that 1s harmful to the eyes. T he 
incidence of cataract blindness in Tibet is 
about six times that found elsewhere in China.

Operating on the roof 
of the world 
Dr. Ruit always had a fascination with 
Tibet, from where his own ancestors set off 
three centuries ago to settle in eastern 
Nepal. Finally it was in 1994, with the 
financial help of New Zealand Rotary 
Clubs and at the invitation of the Tibet 
Development Fund (TDF), a non-govern- 
mental organization, that he was able to 
make a foray on to the “roof of the world”. 
During Dr. Ruit’s first visit, members 
of the TDF asked how many operations 
could be done during a four-day session at 
Chusu, a village between Lhasa and its air- 
port. They gaped with surprise when Dr 
Ruit replied that going on past experience 
in Nepal, some 200 operations would be 
possible in that time. In Tibet, only 150 
cataract operations had been done throu- 
ghout the whole of the previous year. 
Dr. Ruit performs his operations within 
five minutes. It 1s actually a very simple surgical 
procedure which can be performed by even 
a neophyte doctor in half an hour. First the Ph

### 118791: The Electronic gap

THE ELECTRONIC GAP 
   
Paul Kennedy 
  
British historian Paul Kennedy 
is the J. Richardson Dilworth 
Professor of History at Yale 
University (U.SA.). He is the 
author of a widely acclaimed 
work, The Rise and Fall of the 
Great Powers: Economic 
Change and Military Conflict 
from 1500-2000 (Random 
House, 1987), in which he 
analysed the factors 
underlying the rise and fall of 
empires over the past five 
centuries. In the final chapter 
he evoked the coming collapse 
of the USSR, and also 
speculated about the decline 
of the United States as a great 
power and the rise of Japan 
and China. Notable among his 
other works are Preparing for 
the Twenty-first Century (1993) 
and Strategy and Diplomacy, 
1870-1945 (1983). 
The present text has been 
extracted from Prof. Kennedy's 
contribution to a series of 
“21st Century Talks” held at 
UNESCO Headquarters in Paris 
on November 6, 1999. 
paid consultants talk incessantly about the coming global boom, the transformation 
of the workplace, the technology revolution and the knowledge explosion. It is 
implied that the world is slowly becoming a reproduction of Silicon Valley. It is asserted 
that this is the future. But instead of swallowing this hype, perhaps we should pull back 
and look at the globe as a whole. 
a In the United States, business journals, market gurus, economics professors and highly 
The pessimistic view would be to point out what is currently occurring in Kosovo, West 
Africa,Rwanda,Chechnya, Kashmir and elsewhere. We might also follow Robert Kaplan 
in the trips he describes in To the Ends of the Earth’, only to discover that much of huma- 
nity is headed for disaster and self-destruction. I do not wish to be as negative as that. 
However, I would like to offer a caution to those who portray globalization in an uncri- 
tical and overly enthusiastic manner. 
Each day I send and receive up to 40 messages on the Internet.From my home I can 
search the web sites of the World Bank and the United N ations to find new data, read the 
NewYork Times and check the 9 million book titles in the Yale University Library. The Internet 
gives me, my students and my children immediate access to knowledge, and the knowledge 
explosion is at the heart of the modernization and globalization of world society. 
One in three Americans are regular, daily Internet users. Even within American 
society, the computer and e-mail have widened the gap between educated people (chiefly 
whites and Asians) and the less educated (chiefly black Americans). T his gap will be felt 
in every aspect of life,whether it is in opportunities,potential,education or job-hunting. 
The United States will be divided into two groups, one which is computer-literate and the 
other which is not. 
This phenomenon has been replicated at the international level. The most important 
fact is that we are in the midst of a technology revolution that seems less likely to close the 
gap between rich and poor countries than to widen the gap even further. 
The technology revolution and the communications revolution still bypass billions of 
human beings. From UNESCO’s standpoint, the Internet may have more influence than any 
single medium upon global educational and cultural developments in the coming century. 
Yet only 2.4 per cent of the world’s population is on the Internet, or one person out of 40. 
In Southeast Asia, only one person in 200 is linked to the Internet. In the Arab states,only 
one person in 500 has Internet access, while in Africa only one person in a 1,000 is an 
Internet user. T his situation will not change as long as those lands lack electricity, telephone 
wires and infrastructure. They cannot afford either computers or the expensive software 
they require.If knowledge indeed equals power,the developing world may have less real 
power nowadays than it did 30 years ago, before the Internet was developed. 
If we want to work toward a knowledge-based society in the coming century, over at 
least the next 10 years we need to make a concerted effort to bring poorer societies into 
the system of electronic communications. T his effort will need to be coordinated by the 
World Bank,the UN Development Programme, UNESco, the NGO community and the 
global business community. 
The alternative is to perpetuate a world which is fundamentally undemocratic and struc- 
turally unsound.If we do nothing, if we let the knowledge explosion intensify in techno- 
logy-rich societies while poorer societies fall further and further behind, the growing gap 
between haves and have-nots will lead to widespread discontent and threaten any prospect 
of global harmony and international understanding. T his is the most significant challenge 
we face. We have no time to waste in responding. [|

### 118792: Black and blue: Libya's liquid legacy

BLACK AND BLUE, 
LIBYA'S LIQUID LEGACY 
  
D Amy Otchet 
Libya is mining water to feed its Great Man-Made River but is still not sure how to use 
this precious resource 
Years can roll by without a single sho- 
wer raining on much of Libya’s 
Sahara—one of the world’s most for- 
bidding stretches of desert, covering 90 per 
cent of the country. Like a slab of clay for- 
gotten in an over-heated kiln, flat bands of 
scorched sandstone, cracked and brittle, give 
way to wind-rippled dunes, offering the only 
gentle touch to this barren landscape, where 
a scraggy tree exudes an almost spiritual aura 
by its defiance to survive. 
D Unesco Courier journalist 
Yet beneath this baked crust of earth, 
there is water—not just the last trickles of 
nearly dry streams but phenomenal supplies 
percolating in four sandstone aquifers. Ima- 
gine filling a pool the size of Germany, seve- 
ral hundred metres deep, to grasp the quan- 
tities of water contained in these basins. 
The aquifers are the liquid legacy of a 
climate gone by. About 10,000 years ago, 
the barren Sahara was a green savannah, 
crawling with crocodiles, giraffes and ele- 
phants. Tropical rainforests bloomed on 
mountaintops while our Neolithic ances- 
tors harvested wheat-like crops in the 
plains. Heavy rains regularly refilled the 
rivers and lakes, but significant amounts 
also seeped underground, saturating the 
layers of sandstone until they sloshed with 
water. At the bottom of the basins, reaching 
depths of four kilometres, there may be 
water millions of years old. 
Little remains from that green period: 
climate change choked off the rains about 
3,000 years ago. For millennia, the aqui- 
Huge pipelines have been laid to link wellfields in the desert with the coastal strip inhabited by 85 per cent of Libya's population.

In the next two or three years, Libya plans to irrigate 150,000 hectares of land in addition to its current 
irrigated area of some 500,000 hectares. 
fers lay largely untouched as very little 
water flowed in or out,according to scien- 
tists. Yet today most of Libya’s citizens are 
drinking and bathing in these extraordina- 
rily pure “fossil waters”. 
War of attrition 
between land and sea 
Authorities first turned on the taps of the 
Great Man-Made River Project (GMRP) in 
1991. Considered the world’s largest civil 
engineering project, the river is a work in pro- 
gress. Today, about half a million cubic metres 
of water are flowing daily through two giant 
underground pipelines connecting well-fields 
deep in the desert to the coastal rim where 
about 85 per cent of the population live. The 
government is mining water in much the 
same way as oil—and in so doing adds anew 
twist to an old debate:what are the risks of 
relying on a non-renewable resource?With 
every litre used today lost for tomorrow, what 
about generations to come?You don’t only 
inherit resources from your parents, say 
conservationists, you borrow them from your 
children. 
But asthe Libyans remind us, scarcely a 
whimper is heard today about the world’s 
dependence on another finite fossil resource, 
petroleum. Why balk at mining water and 
not oil? The two come hand-in-hand in 
Libya. In the mid-1960s, discovery of the 
country’s vast petroleum resources led geo- 
logists to explore the aquifers for a simple 
reason: oilrigs require water. But the scale 
shifted in the 1970s when the oil boom trig- 
gered a looming water crisis with the sharp 
rise in living standards and population 
growth (from 1.5 million to the current five 
million).Officials didn’t need a crystal ball to 
see groundwater supplies falling prey to the 
sea’s intrusion. Imagine a war of attrition 
between land and the sea, ever-hungry for 
more territory. The groundwater supplies 
reinforce the land’s resistance to the batte- 
ring waves of the sea. So a steep fall in water 
tables is like an open invitation for the sea 
which now intrudes another 100 metres 
underground each year. This saline trail 
contaminates what little freshwater remains 
and ravages the fine coat of ochre soil, lea- 
ving the roots of orange trees so choked with 
salt that many bear little more than green 
fruit the size of ping-pong balls. 
“The question has never been: should we 
mine water or not?’ says Omar Salem, direc- 
tor general of the General Water Authority. 
“Rather it’s been: if we don’t find a solution 
to the water shortage, we will face a very dark 
future.” After weighing the options, the 
government ruled out desalination,conside- 
red too expensive and risky as the country 
would be entirely dependent on foreign tech- 
nology and expertise to maintain the plants, 
explains Salem. With such fabulous supplies 
lining the desert (very roughly estimated at 
120,000 cubic km), the choice was clear: 
move the people to the water or the water to 
the people. With few families enticed by 
desert life, the government opted for the lat- 
PLANET 
ter in 1983 and began building the Man- 
Made River which is both praised as the 
World’s Eighth Wonder and branded as Col. 
Qadhafi’s “Pipe Dream”. 
It took an army of Asian construction 
workers years to dynamite and dig the tun- 
nels to lay the giant concrete pipes, four 
metres in diameter, wide enough for a sub- 
way train to pass—or tanks, missiles and 
troops, according to a few Western media 
reports citing anonymous sources which 
claim that the Man-Made River is inten- 
ded for covert military purposes. While 
these stories are rejected as fantasy by 
experts in international organizations 
(including UNESCO), the scale of the project 
opens the floodgates of the imagination. A 
road from Tripoli to Bombay could be 
paved with the five million tons of cement 
used to build the pipelines, which stretch 
over a total length of 3,500 km. Imagine 
“The difficult choice 
is between two development 
options. Do we want large- 
scale extraction of 
groundwater for maximum 
benefit of the present 
generation or limited 
extraction that ensures 
sustainable development 
and conservation of 
the resource base? 
transposing the conveyance system on a 
map of Western Europe: the pipeline would 
begin in southern Switzerland and head 
through Germany and on up to Poland 
before cutting west to northern Scotland. 
In reality, it takes an average of nine days for 
every drop of water to travel from Libya’s 
desert well- fields to the coast. 
The nightmare of construction logis- 
tics took a surreal turn in 1986 when the 
U.S. government imposed sanctions limi- 
ting travel and commercial operations with 
Libyal, says Mr A.M .El-Gheriani,general 
manager of the GMRP. The first order of 
business lay with the project’s designers, a 
consulting firm based in Houston and 
1 In 1992, the United Nations also imposed 
sanctions (including a ban on civil aviation and 
severely restricting commercial activities) in 
response to Col. Qadhafi’s refusal to extradite two 
suspects in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jet 
above Lockerbie, Scotland. The UN suspended 
these sanctions in 1999 after Tripoli handed over 
the suspects for a trial to take place in the 
Netherlands.

### 118792: Black and blue: Libya's liquid legacy

PLANET 
owned by Halliburton, whose CEO is none 
other than Dick Cheney, former U.S.secre- 
tary of defence. The company quickly pas- 
sed into the hands of a subsidiary, Brown 
and Root, conveniently located in England. 
The wheeling and dealing required to 
obtain spare parts has inflated the project’s 
hefty price-tag, estimated at a total of $27 
billion—which the government has been 
financing mostly by converting oil into 
water by taxing petroleum exports. 
“All major civil engineering projects are 
criticized, but especially the GMRP given 
the country that Libya is,” says Dr Abdulgader 
A.Abufayed, who is responsible for allocating 
GMRP water. Libya is not the only country 
mining fossil water. Egypt is tapping into 
aquifers in its western desert for a massive pro- 
ject to irrigate 200,000 hectares. Even the 
United States is pumping non-renewable 
sources. While California’s water mining is 
marginal compared to that of Libya, it is 
controversial given that the U.S. is a water-rich 
country with alternative supplies. But what 
choices are open to hyper-arid countries? For 
these countries, the question is not whether to 
use fossil water, but when and how? 
More today 
means less tomorrow 
“The difficult choice is between two deve- 
lopment options,” says Mohamed Bakhba- 
khi, a Libyan hydrologist with the Nubian 
Sandstone Aquifer System Programme, 
which promotes data exchange between the 
four countries sharing these basins (Chad, 
Egypt,Libya and Sudan). “Do we want large- 
scale extraction of groundwater for maxi- 
mum benefit of the present generation or 
limited extraction that ensures sustainable 
development and conservation of the resour- 
ce base?’ Libya is now at a crossroads: the 
Man-Made River is only flowing at about a 
tenth of its capacity to cover domestic needs 
on the coast. The government must now deci- 
de how to use the rest of the water and put 
the needed infrastructure in place. Should it 
use every last drop for large-scale irrigation 
projects or opt for a more conservative poli- 
cy, focusing more on ensuring drinking sup- 
plies and industrial use, which require far less 
than agriculture? 
Officially, agriculture is the top priority 
of the Man-Made River. For the next 50 
years, the project is designed to deliver about 
six million cubic metres of water daily, with 
75 to 80 per cent going to farms,according 
to Dr. Ali Giuma, secretary (minister) of agri- 
culture.It’s important to understand that 
major infrastructure projects are normally 
built to last at least 50 years. The aquifers will 
not dry up at the end of that period but they 
may be far more difficult to mine. “You might 
1 2 The Unesco Courier - February 2000 
be able to extend the conveyance system or 
put in another well-field,” says John Lloyd, 
a British professor at Birmingham Universi- 
ty and a leading groundwater expert. In the 
Libyan desert, the wells reach between 400- 
600 metres underground. In 50 years,the 
water tables of the western aquifers, for 
example, are expected to fall about 80 metres 
if they are pumped at full capacity. Techni- 
cally, it will be possible to continue pumping 
at these lower levels (assuming that the water 
quality doesn’t change). In Saudi Arabia, for 
example, water wells reach down a kilometre 
or two underground even though they are 
more expensive to operate. But as Lloyd 
points out, “Water may be more precious 
in the future, so it might be worth pumping 
deeper.” 
With this in mind, the agriculture 
minister, Dr Giuma, ploughs ahead with 
irrigation plans to work towards the natio- 
nal goal of agricultural self-sufficiency. “In 
the next two or three years, we plan to add 
another 150,000 irrigated hectares to the 
current total of about half a million,” says 
Giuma. While fruits and vegetables are in 
ample supply, Libya relies on wheat and 
barley imports to satisfy 60 per cent of 
domestic demand. To redress the balance, 
government-sponsored farms are starting 
to sprout around Sirt, Colonel Qadhafi’s 
native city, and Benghazi. 
This is big sky country, with the flatlands 
surrounding Benghazi looking picture per- 
fect for a giant wheat belt.Red topcoats of 
soil are carefully tilled beside white-domed 
water tanks crowning each of the 520 new 
farms, which the government is preparing 
to virtually give away at prices of just 2,000 
dinars ($1,000 at the black market exchan- 
ge rate) for 10 hectares. Not by chance, the 
Man-Made River flows nearby via two reser- 
voirs the size of football fields. 
Importing wheat 
saves precious water 
But the apparent abundance of irriga- 
tion water is a kind of mirage, hiding the 
fact that this is an arid zone where water 
evaporates at rates of 40 to 60 per cent. 
Indeed, half of all water now used for irri- 
gation is wasted, according to Ayad S. 
Kaal, a hydrogeologist with the Agriculture 
Research Centre. Kaal is hoping that 
conditions will improve as farmers learn to 
use more efficient techniques such as drip 
irrigation. 
But the decision to invest in agricultu- 
re leaves many scientific experts,particu- 
larly from the West, baffled. With the inter- 
national grain market in a glut, why not 
import wheat and save precious water for 
industries that not only use less but also pro- 
duce better paying jobs?*“Of course it might 
be cheaper to buy wheat abroad but what if 
there is another embargo to limit these 
imports? asks Dr Ibrahim Salem Haffala, 
an economist with the Agriculture Resear- 
ch Centre. 
As Haffala explains, Western principles 
of economics don’t seem to apply here as 
they fail to take account of surrounding 
RIVALLING THENILE 
ational pride runs high with the Great Man- 
Made River. The charming weather forecaster 
on the evening national newscast points to brewing 
storms over a continental map in which the Man- 
Made River appears as naturally as the Nile. And 
those giant pipelines offer the perfect backdrop 
for Col. Qadhafi to strike a regal pose beside women 
and children beaming in good health beside 
bundles of wheat—signs of hydrological abundance 
depicted in the billboards lining Tripoli’s streets. But 
the River has brought another benefit that isn’t as 
easy to illustrate: a generation of highly skilled 
engineers and hydrologists. 
While foreign consultants have provided the 
lion’s share of operational and technical expertise, 
the project has been “Libyanized” according to 
the general manager, Mr. E-Gheriani, who says that 
nationals now make up 80 per cent of all per- 
sonnel except for construction which isin the hands 
of a South Korean contractor, Dong Ah. 
UNEsco began co-operating with the govern- 
ment in 1990 to organize training for Libyan 
engineers and geologists at institutions in the   
Netherlands, UK and Australia. All expenses are 
covered by a trust fund, paid for by the government, 
which has also been used to finance training and 
documentation centres set up with UNESCO's assis- 
tance in Benghazi. 
Once the river began flowing, UNESCO assis- 
tance shifted to evaluating the project, with studies 
comparing, for example, the costs of the GMR 
water with desalination options. An international 
advisory board—eomposed of expertsin fields like 
geo-hydrology, agriculture and engineering—also 
meets regularly to assess the risks and resilience of 
the system. The major priority isto evaluate the next 
stages of construction, including a third pipeline to 
connect the other two. New well-fields are also 
under study. 
UNESO is also focusing on wider environmental 
and socio-economic issues surrounding the mana- 
gement of non-renewable water resources notably in 
North Africa and the Middle East. To find out more

political and cultural factors. For example, 
farming is seen as a partial solution to rising 
unemployment, says Dr Giuma. The 
government wants to diversify the job mar- 
ket, dominated by the energy sector, by 
subsidizing a new managerial class in agri- 
culture. These “gentlemen farmers” would 
supervise foreign workers from Egypt, 
Sudan and elsewhere in Africa. 
“It’s impossible to make a definitive sta- 
tement like, ‘Don’t use water for agricul- 
ture,” ” says Phillipe Pallas, a French 
consultant with the Food and Agriculture 
Organization who has worked closely with 
Libyan officials for the past 25 years. “But 
there are people questioning whether or not 
it might be cheaper to import wheat. This 
marks a big change.Five years ago, no one 
in the government would even agree to dis- 
cuss the option. Today there is a national 
debate, though it’s difficult to say at what 
level it’s taking place.” 
In the revolutionary rhetoric of Col. 
Qadhafi’s Jamahiriya—state of the masses— 
agricultural self-sufficiency appears to be 
an exalted principle, which few would publi- 
cly disavow. But respect for the principle 
might not translate into active commitment 
to the goal. “We will be as sufficient as pos- 
sible with our resources,” says Dr Abou- 
fayed, who isresponsible for allocating water 
to farms. “The Great Man-Made River Pro- 
ject is not the magic solution to all of our 
water problems. It gives us the breathing 
space to develop new technologies and an 
integrated water policy. To raise public awa- 
reness of the value of water, we are setting 
up economic disincentives for waste by 
PLANET 
making farmers pay for the water they use.” 
The apparent pragmatism should, however, 
be taken with a grain of salt: at just 48 
dirham (25-50 cents) per cubic metre, the 
price tag reflects only a fraction of the true 
costs of delivering the water. And even this 
nominal rate won’t be charged until farms 
are deemed “profitable”. 
It may be a matter of time before offi- 
cials admit to what experts like Pallas see as 
obvious: “They would need another two of 
three Man-Made Rivers to be self-sufficient 
in agriculture,” he says, pointing to projec- 
tions calculated with Libya’s General Water 
Authority. In the year 2025, Libya’s popula- 
tion 1s expected to reach almost 12 million 
(including non-nationals), with domestic 
water needs swallowing up about 55 per cent 
of the total capacity of the Man-Made River. 
Yet even if every last drop of water (GMRP, 
renewable groundwater sources and recy- 
cled supplies) was used exclusively for agri- 
culture, Libya would still need to import 
about half of its food supplies. 
‘Big fixes'— 
a technological mirage 
“The responsible use of such an extra- 
ordinary project demands that you develop 
the very best conser vation policies possible 
so that nobody in the future can look back 
and say: ‘What a waste!” ” says Mike 
Edmunds,a member of the British Geolo- 
gical Survey team which explored the aqui- 
fers in the 1960s. His praise for the project 
is tempered by caution: “I just hope they 
[officials] understand that big engineering 
‘fixes’ to water crises won't always be there.” 
Big fixes are a virtual obsession for the 
general manager of the GMRP, El-Gheira- 
nia. Sceptical that desalination will ever be 
affordable, he aims to keep the Man-Made 
River flowing as long as possible. In August 
1999, pipes burst along the eastern corri- 
dor, forcing the government to close the taps 
of this pipeline for about a month. Corrosion 
is the likely culprit. “With hundreds of thou- 
sands of pipes crossing through so many dif- 
ferent kinds of soils across a scorched desert, 
you can expect to have difficulties,” says El- 
Gheriani.Given the uncertainties, might it 
be time to invest in infrastructure to better 
conserve the precious water. “In the future, 
conservation will be an area of concern for 
all countries,” says El-Gheriani. Besides, “we 
don’t have the experience to know that the 
aquifers aren’t being recharged,” he says, 
brushing aside the studies showing the 
contrary. “They [Western experts] said we 
only had enough oil for 30 years but it’s still 
flowing. Why not water?” Inshallah!* |

### 118793: Will education go to market?

WILL EDUCATION 
GO TO 
MARKET? 
  
D Nico Hirtt 
The World Trade Organization has launched a process that could open up to competition 
the expanding and highly protected world market in education. What issues are at stake? 
foremost a public service which is res- 
ponsible for providing young people 
with instruction. For investors looking for 
somewhere to put their money it is also an 
annual budget of $1,000 billion worldwide, 
a sector employing 50 million people, and 
above all a billion potential customers in the 
form of students. After the collapse of the 
Seattle negotiations within the World Trade 
Organization at the end of 1999, it is hard 
to say when the “Millennium Round” of 
trade talks will start. But education will sur- 
ely be somewhere on the agenda,since the 
education market is growing at breakneck 
speed. 
The decision to extend to services the 
liberalization of international trade which 
previously applied to commodities was 
taken in 1994. The General Agreement 
on Trade in Services (GATS) which was 
signed in April of that year included edu- 
cation on the list of services to be liberali- 
zed. To stay outside the scope of this 
agreement, a country’s education system 
must be completely financed and admi- 
nistered by the state, which is no longer 
the case anywhere. However, each coun- 
try can still decide freely what commit- 
ments it wants to make, and especially 
which educational sectors it wants to 
expose to market forces. The New 
Zealand government, for example, has 
decided to open up to outside competi- 
tion the whole private education sector, 
from primary to university level. 
So far, New Zealand is an exception,

(EPO and VO Editions, Brussels-Paris, 2000). 
1 4 The Unesco Courier - February 2000 
but that situation is likely to change. Part 
4 of the GATS agreement (“Progressive 
liberalization”) requires that fresh nego- 
tiations should be held by the end of 2000 
at the latest, and should be directed to 
“the elimination of the adverse effects on 
trade in services of measures as a means 
of providing effective market access”. At 
the Geneva headquarters of the World 
Trade Organization (WTO), far from the 
headlines and the demonstrators, work 
still goes on. But independently of the 
WTO and national policies, a number of 
factors are driving educational systems 
towards “commercialization”. 
Pressures 
for change 
First, education is a rapidly-growing 
sector in which governments are finding it 
harder and harder to satisfy demand, 
above all in higher education. Between 
1985 and 1992, the number of students 
in higher education rose about 26 per 
cent—from 58.6 to 73.7 million. 
Meanwhile,public spending on education 
has tended to stagnate over the past 15 
years (5-6 per cent of GDP in rich coun- 
tries and 4 per cent elsewhere). 
In view of this dearth of public spen- 
ding, parents and students are increasin- 
gly looking to private education for a 
solution. In the United States, every epi- 
sode of violence in a state school and 
every scandal that rocks official school 
systems gives a boost to “home schoo- 
ling”, where children no longer attend 
school and are taught at home. 
Traditional public education is also 
coming in for strong criticism. Employers 
complain it is not geared to their needs 
and 1s not flexible enough. An influential 
European employers’ pressure group, the 
Industrial Round Table, deplores the fact 
that in most European countries, schools 
are integrated into a centralized public 
system run by a bureaucracy that slows 
down the process of change or makes 
them impervious to demands for change 
from outside. 
Under pressure from economic inter- 
ests, a process of “deregulating” educa- 
tion systems has begun. The growing 
independence of schools is encouraging 
them to look for alternative sources of 
funding, ranging from sponsorship to full 
management by private companies and 
including many kinds of partnerships bet- 
ween schools and firms. A European 
Commission working party on education 
and training says “the time for out-of- 
school education has come. . . . the libe- 
ralization of of the educational process 
thereby made possible will lead to control 
by education service providers who are 
more innovative than the traditional 
structures.” 
The development and spread of infor- 
mation and communication technologies 
on a massive scale make possible the 
development of paid distance learning, 
using multimedia and the Internet for 
tutorials, exams, etc. 
Secondary and primary education are 
also affected. More and more paying 
Internet sites bill themselves as alterna- 
tives to state schools or traditional private 
schools. The computer screen takes over 
from the teacher, for a fee of around 
$2,250 a year. 
The WTO secretariat set up a working 
goup in 1998 to look at the prospects for 
more liberalized education. Its report 
pointed to the rapid growth of distance 
learning and noted the increasing number 
of partnerships between educational insti- 
tutions and private firms such as the 
Western Governors’ University, which

was founded by 17 U.S. state governors 
and includes private sector partners such 
as IBM, AT&T, Cisco, Microsoft and 
International Thomson. 
The report also noted the increasing 
deregulation of higher education in 
Europe by governments which have 
begun “a movement away from public 
financing and toward greater market res- 
ponsiveness, coupled with an increasing 
openness to alternative financing mecha- 
nisms.” The WT O report lists many “bar- 
riers” that need to be removed before 
trade in educational services can be libe- 
ralized.T hese include “measures limiting 
direct investment by foreign education 
providers” and “the existence of govern- 
ment monopolies and high subsidization 
of local institutions”. 
Education 
for export 
It is true that these observations were 
made by a working group, but as Martin 
Khor pointed out in an article in the 
French monthly Le Monde Diplomatique 
in May 1997, “in the WTO, as in the 
GATT, setting up a working group is 
never innocuous. It triggers a chain of 
events which participating governments 
are soon caught up in. Suddenly it is no 
longer a matter of being for or against the 
aims of the working group but simply of 
how they are to be achieved.”

support the efforts of American business 
to take competitive advantage in foreign 
markets.” The U.S. currently controls

INTERNATIONAL TRADE IN EDUCATION 
e WTO uses four terms to describe different 
Toe of cross-border trade in services. Each 
kind is the subject of specific demands from those 
who favour liberalization. 
In education, “consumption abroad” is cur- 
rently by far the most important kind of cross- 
border trade, mainly in the field of higher education: 
in 1995, study abroad was a business worth $27 bil- 
lion. The United States had the lion’s share of the 
market ($7 billion), followed by France, Germany 
and Britain. In this field, advocates of liberalization 
want to abolish measures limiting student mobility 
(immigration red tape, exchange controls and non- 
recognition of equivalent qualifications). 
“Cross-border supply of services” is increasing 
in the form of courses sold over the Internet and the 
sale of CD-Roms and DVDs. This may be the fastest   growing category of trade in education services, but 
precise data are not yet available. Supporters of libe- 
ralization want to give young people better access 
to the Internet, deregulate distance learning, and 
harmonize conditions of access to it and equiva- 
lence between courses as well as ensuring reco- 
gnition of diplomas at international level. 
“Commercial presence”, another term used by 
the WTO, mainly refers to the setting up of private 
training institutes controlled by foreign firms. 
Among the obstacles hindering the development of 
this expanding market are refusal to recognize 
foreign institutions and award recognized qualifi- 
cations, conditions related to nationality, etc. 
The fourth category of trade in services involves 
the “presence of natural persons’, e.g. foreign tea- 
chers. Obstacles braking the growth of the market 
include limitations on the numbers of such tea- 
chers. []

services. Its services exports have more 
than doubled in the past 10 years and 
now cover 42 per cent of the non-services 
trade deficit. 
The United States is also the world’s 
leading exporter of educational services, 
and a working group at the Services 2000 
conference paid special attention to this 
sector. It concluded that the sector “needs 
the same degree of transparency, transfera- 
bility and interchangeability, mutual reco- 
gnition, and freedom from undue regula- 
tion or restraints and barriers that the 
United States acknowledges on behalf of 
other service industries.” The report said 
that three points should be at the centre of 
WTO negotiations about education. 
Firstly, there should be a free flow of 
electronic information and means of 
communication, nationally and interna- 
tionally. Secondly, the negotiators should 
tackle “barriers and other restrictions that 
limit or prevent the provision of educatio- 
nal and training services across countries 
and internationally.” They were also to 
deal with obstacles to the transferability 
of degrees and diplomas. 
Fighting 
for market share 
The U.S. demands are backed by 
most countries of the APEC (Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation) zone. In a note 
in October 1999, the Australian delega- 
tion to the WT O said it would be “encou- 
raging all members to make expanded 
commitments in all sectors, even the ones 
that have proved difficult in both regional 
and multilateral services negotiations”, 
particularly education. 
South Korea took a similar position. 
At a meeting of ministers of human 
resources from APEC countries that it 
hosted in September 1997, the Seoul 
government put out a memorandum 
which clearly stated its vision of education 
as a tool of economic competition: 
“The emphasis on education for itself 
or on education for good members of a 
community without a large emphasis on 
preparation for future work is no longer 
appropriate. Such a view of education and 
work cannot be justified in a world where 
economic development is emphasized. 
“At present, in many economies, the 
education systems do not sufficiently 
reflect labour market conditions. Their 
inflexible and inefficient education sys- 
tems could not meet the new economic 
environmental challenges.” So education 
should be made more “flexible”, i.e. be 
deregulated and liberalized. In particular, 
“school systems should be established to 
1 6 The Unesco Courier - February 2000   
allow all students to study what they are 
interested in” and “employers, with 
school educators, should share the role of 
educating students”. 
Some think resistance to liberalizing 
education will come from Europe, espe- 
cially France. “The future WT O negotia- 
tions cannot call in question France's tra- 
dition of public service in the field of 
education and health,” stressed a report 
on the WT O prepared for the French par- 
liament by Béatrice Marre. A few days 
before the Seattle meeting, French educa- 
tion minister Claude Allegre also empha- 
sized his “unshakeable support for educa- 
tion as a public service.” 
U.S. delegates at the Services 2000 
meeting were under no illusions. “It is 
likely that other countries, especially 
members of the European Union, may 
take the view that education and training 
  
are non-commercial activities and there- 
fore should be off the table during GATS 
negotiations,” the Americans said. “This 
position reflects their self-interest as com- 
petitors. . . . It should be resisted.” 
France is currently the world’s second 
biggest exporter of educational services. A 
year ago, the French group Vivendi (for- 
merly Générale des Eaux), through its 
subsidiary Havas, took control of 
Cendant Software, the U.S. educational 
and entertainment software giant. In 
January 1999, the French ministers of 
education and foreign affairs announced 
that France would fight to increase its 
share in the “market”in higher education. 
So one might well ask how far the 
“anti-American” stance of French educa- 
tion officials is simply to protect France’s 
position on the francophone education 
market. nu

Small media, 
new voices 
r centuries journalism has, when 
se omin at its best, been the craft 
through which skilled writer-reporters 
working for organizations financially powerful 
enough to afford expensive print, recording 
and broadcasting infrastructures have tapped 
into authoritative, trusted sources and 
followed events closely in order to provide 
information to the public. But now the rules of 
the game are changing. 
Today, via the Internet, where users as well 
as creators of web sites can contribute news, 
members of the public are often performing 
the jobs traditionally reserved for the media. 
This is but the latest breakthrough in 
technology which has helped pluralize control 
of the media. 
As technology improves, it generally gets 
easier to learn how to wield the tools of the 
trade. At the same time, costs of setting up a 
news service have overall dropped. Small TV, 
radio, print and online news outlets have 
proliferated (pp. 20-1). More points of view 
are being aired than ever before. 
In this Focus section, we discuss a few 
examples of the media’s new voices: Israel’s 
neighbourhood-run community TV stations; 
Romania’s newspaper deluge; a youth-run 
radio station that exerts political pressure on 
behalf of people living in a sprawling, poor 
suburban area of Senegal; a broadcast service 
that connects the Sri Lankan diaspora; an 
offshore Algerian news service that could 
probably have been conceived in no medium 
other than the Internet. 
We also reflect on the deeper social impact 
of the media explosion. John Pavlik, head of 
Columbia University’s New Media Center, 
explains how the Internet is redefining the 
role of journalists and empowering the public. 
But Aidan White, General Secretary of the 
International Federation of Journalists, 
wonders whether the headswirling quantity of 
news and information may be at the sacrifice 
of quality.

The technological revolution is helping to give voice to the voiceless

explosion of media offerings,from the pro- 
liferation of magazine titles, to the hun- 
dreds of cable television stations now available 
even in some poorer nations, and the never- 
ending expansion of the Internet. 
Underpinning this are advances in technology 
that have drastically reduced the costs of media 
production and distribution, making it possible 
for those without huge funds to launch their own 
ventures or simply to make their voices heard. 
Some of the most noteworthy technological 
breakthroughs include: digital layout of newspa- 
pers, replacing time-consuming and expensive 
typesetting; desktop publishing via the personal 
computer; increasing simplification of broadcast 
equipment; and, of course, the Internet. 
Among the more renowned beneficiaries of 
this technological transformation has been the 
Independent newspaper of the UK, which shook 
0: the past two decades, there has been an 
‘With the help of new 
information technologies, 
numerous opportunities exist 
for independent media to cut 
their production costs, add value 
to their product, expand 
their markets and consolidate 
their independence’ 
the media establishment when it was set up in the 
late 1980s. Digital layout and transmission to 
printers around the country cut production and 
distribution costs, helping make the venture 
financially possible. 
Since then, technological progress has 
enabled smaller and smaller players to set up their 
own media outlets. In televison,one can now pro- 
duce programmes with easy-to-handle digital 
video cameras costing as little as $1,000 each. 
Time required for programme editing has been 
radically slashed, saving on labour as well as other 
costs. 
Not only is it much cheaper to launch a media 
venture today, it’s also a lot simpler. Twenty years 
ago, jobs including handling even elementary 
radio transmitters, newspaper page layout, and 
television programme editing were reserved for 
specialists who trained and honed their skills over 
several years. Today, a few weeks or even days are 
sufficient to acquire the basic skills to accomplish 
more or less the same tasks. 
The biggest technological leap in media over 
the past century has permitted just about anyone 
to launch a media enterprise. With the Internet, 
“the costs of entry are nothing,” says Brian 
Trench, senior lecturer in communications at the 
Dublin City University. 
All of this has had profound social implica- 
tions, challenging the concentration of power in 
the media.“The traditional centres of control are 
withering away,” says Dr. Anura Goonasekera, 
Head of Research at the Asian Media 
Information and Communciation Centre in 
Singapore. “Mass communication under the pre- 
vious modes of production, both capitalist and 
socialist,used to be controlled by a group of func- 
tionaries. . . . [But now] such direct controls 
through ownership are becoming increasingly 
difficult.” 
To some extent the developing world is rea- 
ping the fruits of the technological break- 
throughs. But much more needs to be done if 
poorer countries are to benefit as much as the 
West from the diversity and democracy, not to 
mention more jobs and vibrant economies, pos- 
sible through new media. 
“With the help of new information technolo- 
gies, numerous opportunities exist for indepen- 
dent media to cut their production costs, add 
value to their product, expand their markets and 
consolidate their independence,” writes Professor 
Guy Berger of the Journalism Department at 
Rhodes University in South Africa. 
A number of analysts question whether the 
technological revolution will in the long term turn 
out to be a force of diversification. For instance, if 
start-up costs are miniscule, marketing for 
Internet services can often be enormously 
expensive in order to win the attention of consu- 
mers swamped with choice. University of Illinois 
professor Robert McChesney argues in Rich 
M edia, Poor Democracy that the major media com- 
panies will dominate the Internet because they 
already have big newsrooms, war chests and 
brand recognition. 
But on balance, the new technology appears 
to be a force of diversity and, by extension,demo- 
cracy. Andrew Shapiro, senior adviser at the 
Markle Foundation, in a a book entitled The 
Control of Change, cites the example of Radio B92 
in Belgrade. When Yugoslav leader Slobodan 
Milosevic shut the station down in late 1996, B92 
simply went online on the Internet. [|

Jerusalem's cub reporters 
D Claudine Meyer 
Israel’s proliferating community TV stations are becoming 
a power in the land. The enthusiasm of their staff helps to compensate 
for lack of funding 
young assistants, Yoni and Yossi, hurry off to shut 
themselves away for a couple of hours in a room 
at the centre. Here, every Sunday evening, the 15 
or so volunteer staff of the local community TV 
station, set up three years ago, meet with their 
teacher, Gilad, a 34-year-old ex-yoga instructor 
who is studying for his Ph.D in Hebrew poetry. 
The younger members of the team, like 15- 
year-old Roi, are all keen to learn about the tech- 
nical side of television—how to hold a camera, 
record sound and do lighting. The older ones are 
more concerned about what’s going into the next 
programme. Because of lack of resources the pro- 
grammes only last half an hour. They go out three 
times a week on cable Channel 9. 
Israel has had cable TV since 1988. Despite 
one of the most expensive monthly subscriptions 
in the world (around $35), 70 per cent (920,000) 
of households have signed up for it and have 
access to more than 40 channels, including 
Channel 9, which only carries community TV. 
The variety of topics tackled by the Lev Hair 
team gives some idea of its inclusive nature. Age 
differences are blithely ignored by the staff, which 
includes Yossi and his mother Shoshana,Anat and 
his brother Alon, and Sylvia and Wolf, who have 
three little blonde children. Such blood ties bet- 
ween staff members sometimes lead to family 
wrangles, but a strong sense of camaraderie soon 
developed between lay and religious people, 
locals and outsiders, emigrants from east and 
west, and Jews and Arabs. The team is a kind of 
microcosm of Israeli society. Its common deno- 
minator is a desire for self-expression. 
No taboos

basic training course for 400 shekels instead of

### 118796: The Global media boom

The global media boom 
he so-called information age, marked by the 
triumph of the Internet, started in the early 
1980s and really took off in the latter half of the 
1990s. In 1981, only some 200 people were 
connected to the Internet. T he turning point came 
in 1986, when the number of users quintupled. By 
the middle of 1999, 56 million computers were 
Internet-connected, an increase of almost 20 mil- 
lion over the previous 12 months. As the chart at 
right shows, the Internet phenomenon is still largely 
confined to the rich countries, which have 95 per 
cent of the world’s Internet-connected computers. 
The North-South gap is wider than for any of the 
other media (see article page 9).

levision has probably had the greatest social 
impact over the past century. Its predominance 
will likely continue for a long time to come as a result 
of the development of cable and satellite distribu- 
tion and local channels and the move towards digital 
instead of analogue transmission. Over the past 
three decades, the total number of television recei- 
vers has grown by 55 times in the developing world 
and their density (number in relation to population 
size) by around 16. The North-South divide is 
smaller for television than for the other media.

» English jargon such as “shooting . . . pan. . . tilt 
up. . . tilt down”. They also discuss supposedly 
taboo subjects including the three Ps—politics, 
pornography and publicity. Some of the students 
have been keen enough to go on Sundays to the 
Zippori training centre, tucked away in the heart 
of Jerusalem’s vast pine forest, and brush up their 
skills. 
Teams like this are appearing all over Israel. 
There are now 150 community television stations 
set up either by neighbourhood groups or by cul- 
tural communities such as Iranian Jews who 
speak Persian, newcomers to Israel from 
Ethiopia, or Russians who have arrived in large 
numbers since the fall of the Soviet empire. For 
all of them, community TV is a forum where 
people can say what they feel about all kinds of 
things, from their taste in music to their distaste 
for bureaucracy. 
This flowering, greatly helped by the steadily 
falling price of equipment, is what local people 
want. Community TV fills in the gaps left by the 
national channels. “These channels don’t fully 
take into account the diversity of the country’s 
population, which contains microcosms and cul- 
tural minorities with strong sub-cultures,” says 
Yehiel Limor, professor of communication scien- 
ce at Tel Aviv’s New School for Media Studies. 
The role of local television is particularly impor- 
tant because “the local press only stops being 
parochial when it brings out weekend editions,” 
Limor says, referring to leisure magazines whose 
content is usually superficial. 
Local gripes 
Local television tries to “get things moving”, 
and on many occasions has been successful. In a 
three-minute interview with the head of Bezek, 
the national telecommunications company, a 
team from the Gonenim centre managed to speed 
up repairs to public phone boxes smashed by 
vandals, after users had campaigned in vain for 
months. People living in the new out-of-town 
neighbourhood of Ramot got a bus service after a 
televised interview with the head of the Egged bus 
company. 
These tussles with local authorities have beco- 
me common. A team of reporters questioned the 
mayor of the mixed Jewish-Arab town of Ramle 
about garbage collection. At first he was hostile, 
but after a critical TV programme he improved 
the service. In exchange, the reporters abstained 
from making a follow-up film,so the mayor could 
save face and criticism from the townspeople did 
not spread. 
Today, the Lev Hair community TV team has 
decided to tackle the sensitive issue of how the 
local market and night-time garbage collection 
disturb the lives of those living nearby. Shlomi, 
who is something of a philosopher, is sitting on a 
pile of broken crates and discarded fruit. He 
laughs and says he’ll read extracts from what 
great thinkers have said about this kind of subject.

Michal says the real issue is that many of the wor- 
kers are young Arab boys who stack the stalls with 
produce, throw away empty boxes and swill down 
the paving-stones when squashed tomatoes and 
mangoes have made them slippery. A martial arts 
enthusiast, he willingly talks about this serious 
topic instead of his favourite subject, tokaido. 
Micha, a choreographer, calls for a programme 
about the growth of the underground culture. 
Sylvie suggests a vox pop fashion programme to 
find out what people think of the famous “bob”, 
the little cloth hat worn by Zionist veterans. An 
amusing and surrealist vox pop programme won 
the humour prize at Israel’s last annual communi- 
ty TV contest and got its authors a weekend holi- 
day at Shefaim kibbutz. The question addressed in 
the programme was: “Do you prefer white or yel- 
low stripes on pedestrian crossings?’ 
Short of shekels 
The last item on the agenda is money and a 
report on a demonstration held in Tel Aviv in 
mid-November to persuade the communications 
ministry not to cut the team’s 20,000-shekel 
(around $4,700) annual operating budget, a sum 
which would just about buy a camera. Additional 
funding amounting to 10,000 shekels ($2,350) 
comes from various money-raising activities held 
during the year. The proceeds go to each of the 80 
member stations of an association led by a tireless 
enthusiast and campaigner for communication 
rights, Zeevic Zaavi. 
Zaavi, who is in his 50s, keeps a stock of com- 
munity TV productions in his video library and 
compiles from them a 30-minute weekly magazi- 
ne for young people called Altematives, which

Meagre though they are, subsidies are vitally

abandoned children is a real goldmine for institu- 
tions involved in the field. This shows the impact 
these energetic young people have had on Romania’s 
political and social life. 
Has new information technology expanded 
freedom of expression? “It’s done more than that,” 
says Suciu.“It’s our guarantee of freedom.” 
Romanians have learned to turn IT to their 
best advantage. Largely due to new technology, 
the fortunes of the written press soared after the fall 
of President Nicolae Ceausescu in 1989. “When he

was in power, there were a total of 400 magazines 
and newspapers in the country,” says sociologist Alin 
Teodorescu. “I was amazed to see that figure 
increase tenfold in less than a year.” 
In 1990,the unchecked expansion of the press 
exceeded all expectations and became a honey-pot 
for local investors looking for quick profits. The 
daily paper Adevarul (“Truth”) was printing 1.8 mil- 
lion copies, Romdnia Libera (“Free Romania”) 1.5 
million,and the weeklies sometimes topped a mil- 
lion copies. These were huge figures for a country 
of 23 million people. 
“The media has been the biggest laboratory of 
private enterprise in Romania,” says Teodorescu. 
“Including advertising revenue, it accounts today for 
2.5 percent of GDP. If the whole economy was like 
that, our national income would be higher than 
that of Greece.” 
The figures speak for themselves. In 1989, there 
were only 2,500 people working in the media. Today 
there are 12,500. About 3,000 modern printing 
works have replaced old ones, some of which dated 
back to 1894.T he local capital the media attracted 
has been reinvested in computerizing editorial 
offices. 
At the start of the 1990s, paper and power 
supply were still government-subsidized, which 
Sa = The Unesco Courier - February 2000 
made production costs low and newspapers very 
cheap for the public. But low prices were not the 
only factor in boosting readership. After nearly 40 
years of silence under the Ceausescu regime,Roma- 
nians were hungry for information and any printed 
material interested them. Social and political life 
became an endless source of hot news, and most 
intellectuals abandoned their field and turned to the 
press, which became a kind of mirage of demo- 
cracy. 
Aware that people also needed to be entertai- 
ned after being numbed by long years of boring 
language, many new papers—big and small, natio- 
nal and local—were unashamedly lightweight.T he 
yellow press flourished.Commentary and personal 
opinion, expressed in language that was often vul- 
gar and sometimes violent and insulting, turned 
the press into a battlefield between the reformers 
and those who looked back nostalgically to the 
past. 
Competition from TV 
Things began to change in 1992. Production 
costs went up, people’s incomes fell and political 
controversy lowered the tone. T he audiovisual sector 
was also rapidly taking off and making Romania into 
the eastern European leader in the field with, today, 
48 television channels (40 of them local) and 250 
radio stations (all but five of them private). As a 
result,circulation fell dramatically and the written 
press had to rethink its strategy. It has since become 
more professional, with improved content and pre- 
sentation. It has mainly opted for news and left the 
job of entertainment to television. 
“Competition from television was a shock for the 
press,” says Teodorescu, “especially when T V made 
off with 61 per cent of advertising revenues. Today 
they're quits, each of them drawing 50 per cent. 
Income from advertising has actually risen by about 
a fifth every year and is a real powerhouse for the 
media. 
Freedom of expression, the market economy 
and new technology are the mainsprings of this 
extraordinary expansion of the press in Romania, 
Everyone has the right 
to freedom of opinion 
and expression; this 
right includes freedom 
to hold opinions without 
interference and to seek,

information and ideas

Senegal: Oxy-Jeunes is

Young people in a poor suburb of Dakar fought hard to get a radio frequency. 
Since their station started broadcasting in June 1999, it has given many ordinary citizens 
a chance to speak their mind

we can’t get it here in Dakar,” says Babacar, a 
young garage mechanic who works in the Senega- 
lese capital but lives out in the suburb of Pikine. 
When you tell him there are plenty of radio stations 
in Dakar, all broadcasting music and news, he 
replies with a laugh: “Yes, but they don’t say enough 
about the place where I live.” 
Pikine, an enormous suburban settlement with 
1.15 million inhabitants, was officially declared a 
town not long ago. Each day, thousands of people pour 
out of it to try to make a living in the “informal sector” 
in Dakar. Poverty-stricken Pikine is where migrants 
from the countryside end up, but it’s also known for 
the richness of its community life and the energy of its 
young people. 
When the people of Pikine set up Radio Oxy-Jeunes 
(“Jeunes” means young people in French), they came 
up against the tough world of Senegal’s bureaucratic 
jungle. They drafted a proposal with the help of Forum 
Jeunesse, a non-governmental organization (NGO)

Radio Broadcasters and a Canadian NGO, the Catho- 
lic Organization for Development and Peace. For three 
years, they wrote letters galore, hung about for hours 
at the ministry of communications and even resorted 
to scribbling graffiti on the walls of Dakar. 
Until recently, the authorities only issued FM 
broadcasting licences to foreign stations such as Radio 
France International and Africa Number One and to 
Senegalese-owned commercial stations. They made a 
lot of money because the stations were forced to pay 
an annual fee of several thousand dollars. However, 
underresourced local community stations had little 
chance of getting official approval. Until recently, 
there was only one community radio station in Senegal. 
But in June 1999, a young man from Pikine 
boldly cut his way through this thicket of restrictions. 
When he shook President Abdou Diouf’s hand at 
the inauguration of Dakar’s new stadium, he seized 
the opportunity to say: “Mr President, young people

» make themselves heard on the airwaves!” This 
simple sentence did the trick. 
The president responded at once by asking his 
prime minister to give the matter top priority. The 
next day, the people at Forum Jeunesse received a 
summons, delivered by a motor-cyclist, to go to 
the government’s main administration building, 
the citadel of the bureaucracy. When they got there, 
they were told they could use the frequency 103.4. 
From then on they were on their own! 
Today, the Oxy-Jeunes transmitter is a familiar 
sight to all the inhabitants of Pikine. It stands on the 
roof of the Léopold Sédar Senghor Cultural Centre, 
an imposing building that houses the municipal 
government and several community groups. Physical 
proximity to the local authorities does not seem to 
worry the 50 or so volunteers from community orga- 
nizations who run the station. The radio gives the 
town authorities a hand by broadcasting official 
announcements of general interest, but it carefully 
defends its independence. “Oxy-Jeunes is clearly not 
in the authorities’ pocket,” says opposition MP 
Amadou Yoro Sy. 
T he station broadcasts 40 hours of programmes 
a week. Within six months it had established itself 
as a forum of opinions focused on life in Pikine and 


### 118798: Senegal: Oxy-Jeunes is in the air!

The different communities in 
Pikine soon realized how useful 
Oxy-Jeunes could be in getting 
through to politicians and 
bureaucrats, and also in 
communicating with each other 
the concerns of its inhabitants. Its recipe is simple. 
The producers give the floor to listeners and allo- 
cate plenty of air time to social and political dis- 
cussion. T he titles of the programmes are revea- 
ling—“Mbedd mi” (the street), “Bla-Bla” (political 
satire) and “Fadiou Thiossane” (traditional hea- 
ling). T he station’s aims are to give a platform to 
marginalized people, strengthen grassroots and com- 
munity organizations,get people involved in deve- 
lopment and raise civic awareness. 
The different communities in Pikine soon reali- 
zed how useful Oxy-Jeunes could be in getting 
through to politicians and bureaucrats, and also in 
communicating with each other. All Senegal’s lan- 
guages can be heard on the station—French is only 
given 20 per cent of air time—and all the country’s 
ethnic groups have access to it. For example, says 
Oxy-Jeunes coordinator Oumar Ndiaye Seck, “the 
nearly one million Peulh-Fuutas people from 
Guinea who live in this country no longer have to 
send their announcements to Radio Labé in 
Guinea because they have no outlet in Senegal.” 
Oxy-Jeunes has knocked a few local politicians off 
their pedestals. When they answer listeners’questions, 
they come across as ordinary citizens, accountable to 
the people who voted for them. In a country built

ins with local authority officials. 
An Oxy-Jeunes studio during a broadcast.The station’s most popular programmes are phone- 
around traditional hierarchical relationships and poli- 
tical favouritism, this kind of awakening has not come 
easily. 
The prefect of Pikine district, Cheikh Tidiane 
Ndoye, points out that “the most popular pro- 
grammes are those in which mayors and local officials 
are invited to speak directly to the listeners.” The 
highly popular local news bulletin, which presents an 
hour of news “about Pikine for Pikine”, is an oppor- 
tunity for grassroots Pikine to bring its struggles for 
survival to the attention of officialdom. 
Pikine’s citizens, especially the younger ones, make 
no bones about reminding officials of broken election 
promises and demanding explanations. T hey also use 
the station to get decision-makers to promise to pro- 
vide basic social services. They realize that asking for a 
public drinking fountain in a poor area by cleverly 
using colloquial language is much more effective in a 
society with an oral tradition than sending letters that 
supposedly get lost in the mayor’s office. 
Publicity about Oxy-Jeunes’ achievements is 
causing a few problems. “What about us?’ say other 
communities which have seen nothing come their 
way. T his increases the pressure on the station and 
on local officials, who often cannot deliver the 
goods. And this pressure is increasing. 
Scrambling for funds 
“There’s too much music and not enough dis- 
cussion on Oxy-Jeunes,” say members of the eco- 
nomic pressure group Bok X alat (“shared vision”), 
who also complain that few of the programmes are 
presented by women. 
Another big problem is the lack of trained pre- 
senters and the paucity of resources. The manage- 
ment would like to have a core of paid professionals, 
but it has no money to hire them.It is also waiting 
anxiously for the end of the station’s first year to see 
if it will have to pay the $3,200 licence fee which is 
compulsory for community radio stations but which 
it cannot afford.

A Paris-based radio and television channel keeps Sri Lankan Tamils abreast of news from home 
while helping them adapt to life abroad 
 
Sri Lankan refugees who arrived in western Europe in the early 1980s often found it difficult 
to adapt to life in countries they knew little about. 
  
D Unesco Courier journalist 
Tamil,arrived in Marseilles last year without 
valid immigration papers after fleeing his 
country’s ethnic conflict. However, Yoganathan’s 
efforts to explain his tenuous situation to the local 
authorities proved futile, as he could not speak 
French. 
A month passed and Yoganathan decided to 
write to the International Committee of the Red 
Cross (ICRC) in Geneva explaining his plight. The 
ICRC responded to his request and asked him to 
provide documentary evidence justifying his case. 
Unfortunately, the reply was in French and Yoga- 
nathan was unable to understand it. 
It was then that he came upon a Tamil radio 
broadcast from Paris in which there was a phone-in 
programme addressing issues related to obtaining a 
stay permit or refugee status in France. Yoganathan 
Rw Yoganathan, a 40-year-old Sri Lankan 
immediately called to seek their help. He received 
guidance and assistance in obtaining his papers and 
is now living in France with his family. 
Yoganathan’s case is not an isolated one. For 
more than half a million Sri Lankan Tamils—most of 
them refugees—Iliving in western Europe, the Paris- 
based Tamil Radio and Television (T RT) network 
not only functions as a news source and an enter- 
tainment channel but most importantly helps them 
to better cope with living abroad. Because the conti- 
nent’s mainstream media takes little interest in their 
affairs, Tamils also say that TRT has given them a 
voice and an identity in their adopted countries. 
Started in January 1997 as a limited company 
by journalists and professionals from the Tamil 
community in Europe, TRT focuses mainly on 
news and current affairs. T here are hourly news 
bulletins in Tamil devoted primarily to the Sri Lan- 
kan situation followed by current affairs in the sub- 
continent and other parts of the world. The radio 
channel was an instant success among Tamils in 
Europe, who until then had no other daily source of 
information about their homeland. 
Wanting to feel 
at home 
TRT is more than a traditional news provider. In 
a weekly programme called “Udhavuvoma” (“Can we 
help?’), it invites experts to answer queries in Tamil 
on how to obtain work permits and on other admi- 
nistrative issues. “They don’t just ask about immi- 
gration problems; they are often looking for infor- 
mation about matters ranging from divorce to school 
admission,” says Sagadevan, an expert on French legal 
affairs who hosts this weekly programme. 
On the lighter side, the channel also airs inter- 
views with Sri Lankan and Indian celebrities, lite- 
rary reviews, sports and popular cultural pro- »

» grammes. Live coverage of community cultural 
events and festivals organized in Europe is attrac- 
ting a growing number of listeners. TRT also made 
arrangements with a local Tamil radio station in 
Canada so that its programmes could reach the 
100,000-strong Tamil community living there. 
“The overwhelming support from our people 
encouraged us to start a 24-hour television channel 
six months after we launched the radio,” says Guha- 
nathan Sabapathy Suppaiah, director-general of the 
TRT network. 
Started with an investment of $5 million in June 
1997, TRT’s television channel today boasts over 
7,000 subscribers, mostly Sri Lankan Tamils living 
in western Europe. Its programmes are beamed 
across Europe as well as to South Africa, Mauri- 
tius and the island of Réunion where there is a 
sizeable Tamil expatriate population. TRT officials 
claim they have an estimated viewing audience of 
between 50,000 and 60,000 people. The channel is 
free-to-air in places like Mauritius and Réunion. 
An alternative 
to Western films 
and serials 
Unlike radio, TRT television charges its sub- 
scribers in Europe about $25 per month, mostly to 
meet operating costs. At the Paris headquarters, 
there are about 20 full-time staff members and 
some 50 freelancers working round the clock. TRT 
has its own correspondents in the Tamil-dominated 
northern and eastern parts of Sri Lanka, in sou- 
thern India and in major west European cities, 
where there is a substantial population of Sri Lan- 
kan Tamils. The television channel also has a pro- 
duction unit in India. 
What prompted such a large-scale venture? 
“Our primary objective is to inform our people 
about what is happening at home and to address the 
problems of our community now scattered in 
various parts of Europe,’ says Guhanathan. 
Sri Lankan Tamil refugees started arriving in 
Europe in the early 1980s after fleeing the ethnic 
conflict in their country. Britain, France and Ger- 
many took in most of them.M aking a livelihood in 
the host country was their prime concern.T hen 
came wrangling with officials for visas and work 
permits for family members. Without any know- 
ledge of the area or the country in which they were 
living, they often found it hard to become accusto- 
med to conditions there. Their first community 
newspaper, Eelanadu, was published in 1991 in 
Paris and carried news reports about Sri Lanka as 
well as local community events. 
To attract the younger generation, TRT intro- 
duced popular feature films, classical music and 
soap operas produced by Indian television chan- 
nels as well as Tamil pop and rap music. Viewers 
can ask to hear their favourite songs or pose a ques- 
tion to an actor or actress during phone-in pro- 
grammes. TRT also regularly broadcasts pro- 
grammes produced by the Madras-based Sun TV 
channel. “Previously we used to ask our parents

about our music and dance traditions. Now we 
often watch them on TRT,” says Amirthavarshini, a 
university student living in Paris. 
The channel also provides the younger gene- 
ration with an incentive to learn Tamil. “Until TRT 
came along, my cousins, who were born here, were 
not interested in listening to Tamil songs and 
movies. Now they are regular TRT viewers. As a 
result, they have also picked up the language,” says 
55-year-old Fernando Thobias, who works at the 
Hotel Méridien in Paris. Among other things, TRT 
offers an alternative to Western films and serials, 
which Tamils sometimes find offensive. “They were 
eagerly looking for something close to their cul- 
ture which TRT now provides,” says Sivabalan, 
who has been living in Paris for the last 15 years 
and often takes part in the channel’s literary pro- 
gramme. In addition, TRT’s phone-in programmes 
help displaced Sri Lankan Tamils to get back in 
touch with their friends and relatives living in dif- 
ferent countries. 
Community 
support 
Some might wonder why it took so long for the 
Tamils to start up their own radio and television 
channel.“We came here as refugees. At that time, 
survival was our first priority,” says TRT’s Guha- 
nathan.“It’s only recently that some of our people 
have started to branch out into different areas, 
which has given us a greater sense of confidence.” 
TRT mainly depends on Indian satellite channels 
for its film-based programmes and most of those 
networks were started after 1992. It was perfect 
timing, since by then the Tamils were in a posi- 
tion—both technically and financially—to start up 
and operate their network. 
But TRT is not without its problems. Com- 
mercials are not generating sufficient revenue to 
run the network, which costs about $800,000 a 
year. ButTRT officials stress that their aim is not to 
make a profit but primarily to serve the commu- 
nity. They are confident that once the subscriber

Although TRT officials maintain that their net-

sed news of the crisis in Algeria but saw no 
easy way to do it. Until the Internet came 
along. 
Journalists have long been unable to work 
freely in Algiers. The independent press' was the 
first target of the authorities and the armed fac- 
tions, which had a shared interest in snuffing out 
dissent. Algerian journalists, faced with censor- 
ship and more and more of their number being 
killed, tried to start newspapers outside the coun- 
try. But their efforts failed, often because of lack 
of resources or because would-be financial bac- 
kers lacked credibility. The only real successes 
interface 
were a handful of supplements on Algeria written 
by Algerian journalists and published in the inter- 
national press, which showed there was a demand 
for news about the country. 
Noureddine Khelassi was one of the journa- 
lists who dreamed of starting up a newspaper 
abroad, though he had no funds to do so. He had 
worked on the independent press at the end of the 
1980s as editor of the daily paper La Nation. But 
like many of his colleagues, he was forced to flee 
Algiers in 1993 after an attempt to kill one of his 
journalists. The paper closed on March 30 that

year. Its farewell editorial said that “the present 
situation makes it no longer possible to publish a 
newspaper which believes in democracy, plura- 
lism and respect for human rights.” 
The turning-point came after Khelassi met 
Rolf Gauffin, a retired Swedish diplomat and a 
well-known expert on the Middle East and the 
Maghreb. In the mid-1990s, Gauffin had covered 
Algeria as a journalist, so he knew how hard it 
was to get unbiased news. Every time he visited 
the country, he was assigned bodyguards by the 
authorities. All foreign journalists were obliged to 
have bodyguards to “guarantee their security” but 
in fact this was the best way for the government 
to restrict their activities and intimidate people 
they spoke to. 
In 1996, a plan for an independent mains- 
tream newspaper reporting on political,economic 
and social matters was presented to the Swedish 
Development Agency (SIDA). “Our idea was to 
set up a paper written by Algerians for Algerians, 
with reporters living and working inside the coun- 
try, and so give Algerian journalists a chance to 
write freely,” says Gauffin. But the project was 
soon dropped in favour of a news-paper which 
would be put on the Internet. 
Building a network of correspondents 
Publishing on the Internet meant minimal 
production costs and free distribution. Few 
Algerians have access to the Internet, but the 
Swedish backers counted on people’s ingenuity to 
boost the paper’s readership by printing it out 
and photocopying it. Another big advantage was 
that the Internet would give the paper a worldwi- 
de readership, especially as it would be in both 
English and French. “The Internet enabled us to 
exist. Without it, we probably would never have »

As soon as SID A released the funds, with help 
from the Olof Palme International Centre, a 
Swedish NGO, the small team on the paper, 
which was called A lgeria-Interface, started work. 
They were based in Paris and consisted of an 
accountant, two part-time journalists and an edi- 
tor, Djamel Benramdane. They soon found an 
office and bought computers. Within weeks they 
had set up an Internet web site. 
Benramdane had been working for some time 
on the trickiest aspect of the project: during his 
many trips to Algeria he had set about building 
up a network of reliable and professional corres- 
pondents. The network, consisting of a dozen 
people, soon got off the ground. For the moment, 
the reporters prefer not to have bylines in print, 
partly to protect themselves but also to avoid 
making fellow journalists jealous, since A lgeria- 
Interface pays its contributors a lot more than they 
would get in Algiers. 
A crucial 
interview 
Algeria-Interface went online at the beginning 
of November 1999 with the declared aim of 
“reporting the news completely objectively while 
remaining faithful to the basic principles of free- 
dom of expression and press freedom, defence of 
human rights and promotion of democratic 
values”. The paper was launched quietly at a 
reception in Paris. “We sent invitations to the 
Algerian, Tunisian and Moroccan embassies,” 
says Taoufiq Derradji, the head of Inforum, the 
publishers of Algeria-Interface, “but only the 
Moroccans turned up.” 
The real test came a few weeks later, when 
Abdelkader Hachani, the number three man in 
the former Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), was 
murdered in Algiers on December 13. “At the 
time, negotiations were in full swing between the 
regime and the Islamists over how to apply the 
law on civil peace,” says Benramdane, “so I 
thought it would be interesting to ask Hachani 
what he thought. An Algeria-Interface reporter 
met him the day before he was killed. As soon as 
we heard he was dead, we put the interview onli- 
ne, describing how we’d got it. We weren’t happy 
about the situation, but it was a minor scoop and 
we were mentioned by many other media, inclu- 
ding the French daily Le Monde.” 
That day the site was visited by a record 6,000 
people. Algeria-Interface usually gets a fair num- 
ber of hits, even though at that time it could not

be found by any search engine. “We had 90,000 
hits between December 1 and 13, and we’ve had 
550,000 since we started in November,” says 
Derradji. “Easily a third of them have come from 
France, which has a large Algerian community. 
Another third have come from Algeria and the 
rest from countries such as Canada, Belgium and 
Switzerland, where there are sizeable communi- 
ties of Algerians who have been exiled because of 
the conflict.” 
Gearing up 
for real-time working 
Encouraged by this success and with a large 
amount of news to put online, A lgeria-Interface 
switched from fortnightly to weekly. “We're now 
preparing to work in real time,” says 
Benramdane, “but we’ve got a lot of problems to 
solve before we get there.” 
First there is the matter of the Internet in 
Algeria itself, where there is only one Internet ser- 
vice provider, CERIST, which is controlled by the 
government and sometimes people have to make 
dozens of attempts before they can connect.The 
authorities are afraid that they won’t be able to 
control the Internet, so they have still not allowed 
it to develop freely. 
Another problem is how to involve local jour- 
nalists. They are sometimes totally taken up with 
their regular jobs and many have not yet visited 
the A lgeria-Interface web site. “The Internet isn’t 
yet part of people’s daily lives and some are not 
sure whether a journal can be a serious enterpri- 
se if it isn’t printed on paper,” says Benramdane. 
But most of all there are problems of funding. 
The Internet means about a two-thirds saving in 
production costs, but overall costs are still nearly 
$24,000 a month. “The fact that the money 
comes from Sweden—a neutral country with a 
solid anti-colonial tradition where there was 
strong popular and official support for Algeria’s 
war of independence—gives immediate credibili- 
ty to Algeria-Interface,” says Gauffin. “But we 
know we have to broaden our sources of funding 
to ensure long-term viability.” 
Substantial investment is needed to finance 
serious investigative reporting and news gathe- 
ring. The Internet is a valuable tool for dissemi- 
nating unbiased news and getting round some 
kinds of censorship, but it does not solve the more 
important problem of financial independence. Hl

D Sevanti Ninan is a media 
columnist with The Hindu 
newspaper, published in Madras. 
She is the author of The Magic 
Window and Television and 
Change in India. 
What is the status of community radio, newspapers 
and television in India? 
Amazingly, a large vibrant democracy like India 
is totally devoid of a tradition of community radio sta- 
tions, whereas neighbouring countries like Nepal, Ban- 
gladesh and SriLanka have allowed them.The Indian 
government is not interested in allowing community 
radio centres because it is worried that secessionist 
groups and some non-governmental organizations 
could use them to spread subversive propaganda. I 
think this fear is unfounded, since there are always safe- 
guards, as in the case of commercial broadcasting, 
through which you can terminate licences and seize 
the equipment of broadcasters who violate rules. 
In the case of community newspapers, there are no 
legal hurdles, but it costs a lot to start a newspaper, 
however small it may be. In the past, community news- 
papers have not been able to generate sufficient ad ver- 
tising revenue, unlike the mainstream dailies, and as 
aresult many of them have closed down. In recent years, 
some private cable operators in the big cities have star- 
ted providing community news and information, but 
again these are very small initiatives. Actually, there is 
no culture of community media in India. 
Do you think countries like India are losing out socially 
and politically by restricting the number of voices that 
can be heard in small media like community radio? 
The restriction of community radio means that vil- 
lagers are not getting the local information they need 
about crop growing, cattle diseases and commodity 
prices. Mainstream as well as marginalized groups have 
their own communication needs. Information should 
be given in local languages, and it should be recognized 
that communication needs differ from region to region 
and community to community. In many developing 
countries like India the existing media do not always 
take account of these issues. 
In Medak district in the southern Indian State 
of Andhra Pradesh, UNEsco has helped set up a 
small local radio station with a 100-watt trans- 
mitter which still awaits government approval. It was 
to be run by rural women members of a local NGO 
and would help them to send messages to members 
of their group and other organizations in the area. 
The women argue that without a communication 
channel of their own, which is the case at present, 
their work is much more complicated. 
Unfortunately, there has been no sustained 
campaign on behalf of community radio in India. In 
1995 the Supreme Court ruled against govern- 
ment control of the airwaves and declared that they 
belong to the public, but so far no individual or 
group has sought legal intervention to help them 
start up a community radio centre. 
What is the status of the Internet in India? 
In India use of the Internet is less diverse than in 
the West. E-commerce, Internet magazines and 
Internet-based news sources have yet to become as 
popular as they are in the developed world. T his could 
be due to the fact that in India there are more Internet 
users than subscribers. People are accessing Internet 
mainly through Internet cafes and private computer 
centres rather than through connections of their own 
at home or at work. So they spend less time surfing the 
net than Internet users in the West. 
India has only recently allowed private Internet ser- 
vice providers to operate. T he cost of Internet sub- 
scription is falling as aresult, but computer prices are 
still high. An average middle-class person cannot 
afford to buy a computer as it costs four times more 
than a television set. So the Internet is accessible only 
to a select group of people. To narrow the gap, the 
government should introduce a computer policy to 
bring down the prices of computers and install them 
in community centres. If this is done, then there is a 
chance that the Internet will spread much faster and 
more evenly than at present. [|

### 118807: New media, new rules

ISthe media 
New media, new rules 
  
D John V. Pavlik 
The Internet is challenging the media establishment, empowering 
the public and redefining the role of journalists in society 
old West African immigrant Amadou Diallo 
stepped through the doorway of his Bronx, 
New York apartment building. As he reached for his 
wallet, four members of a special police Street 
Crime Unit drew their guns and fired 41 times. 
Nineteen bullets struck the unarmed man, 
several entering the soles of his feet as he lay dead. 
It’s unclear why the police opened fire on the man; 
as of this writing they had yet to be interviewed in 
the case, which is scheduled to go to trial in early 
2000.T hey were apparently seeking a suspect in a 
rape case,and may have thought Diallo was him. 
The case attracted world-wide attention and stir- 
red considerable controversy over the use of excess 
force by the police, especially in cases involving mino- 
rity suspects in the outer New York City boroughs, 
such as the Bronx. News media provided extensive 
coverage of the story, reporting in detail the events 
that transpired that evening, as best could be surmi- 
sed. 
One news organization, in collaboration with 
students in my class at Columbia University, offered 
an alternative perspective, or perspectives, on the 
Diallo case. In addition to providing the standard 
reporting on the events of that evening, an inter- 
disciplinary team of Columbia students, including 
students of journalism,international affairs, business 
and computer science, worked with journalists at 
APBnews, an online-original news organization 
devoted to crime coverage, to offer a multi-angled 
news report on the story. 
To provide a more contextualized view of the 
killing, the Columbia-APBnews team employed a 
new type of camera invented by a Columbia Uni- 
versity professor of Computer Science, Shree Nayar, 
which shoots a 360-degree view, to photograph 
both the vestibule of Diallo’s apartment building, as 
well as the street where he lived. 
A bout midnight on February 4, 1999 22-year- Those who visit the APBnews.com web site 
can examine the street and the vestibule,panning, 
tilting or zooming anywhere in the entire field of 
view. The view from inside the vestibule approxi- 
mates to the view Diallo would have had that eve- 
ning, but you can now see the bullet holes that 
pock-mark the walls. 
Letting the facts 
speak for themselves 
The view from outside the building, though 
taken during the daytime,approximates to the posi- 
tion the police would have had, giving the viewer a 
sense of perspective on the shooting not possible 
with conventional photojournalism. Together,these 
navigable images, only possible on the Internet,not 
only provide more context for the events of that eve- 
ning, but can engage the audience in ways impos- 
sible in the world of analog journalism. This heigh- 
tened engagement and greater context are critically 
important for journalism in the 21st century. 
As ABPnews.com demonstrates, Internet not 
only makes possible a more engaging form of jour- 
nalism; it also puts greater control in the hands of 
the audience. The facts presented need be less fil- 
tered by journalists; the public can draw its own 
conclusions as to their meaning. In other words, 
journalists online can increasingly let the facts speak 
for themselves. Is this not one of the most long-che- 
rished goals of journalism? 
The Internet also permits a greater range of jour- 
nalistic voices to speak to an increasingly global 
audience. APBnews was founded only two years ago, 
in 1998, and is already recognized by many other lea- 
ding news organizations as a reliable source of crime 
news. In fact, the APBnews service is carried by 
dozens of other news organizations. 
Many other credible Internet-original news sources 
have also arisen in recent years. One, T heStreet.com,

which covers the financial markets, is so respected by 
premier news organizations that on November 24, 
1999, The NewYork Times, perhaps the most highly 
respected news organization in the world,announced 
that it was going into partnership with TheStreet to 
launch a news gathering operation that would provide 
improved business news reporting. 
Examples abound of freelance journalists who 
provide credible news reports from all parts of the 
world. Freelance journalist Mario Profaca (Croa- 
tia), for example, reports on the situation in Kosovo 
and also provides extensive coverage of the spy world 
(http://mprofaca.cro.net/mainmenu.html). George 
Adams edits “Not the South China Morning Post”, 
offering a satirical view on press freedom in Hong 
Kong. These and other online news sources provide 
a global audience with alternative journalistic voices 
to contrast with the mainstream reporting of mul- 
tinational commercial media organizations. 
Research suggests that the public, especially youn- 
ger audiences who have grown up with the Internet, 
is increasingly finding value in this diversity of news 
voices. One study has shown that as of 1998 some 36 
million persons in the U.S. (including 30 per cent of 
18 to 29-year-olds, up from just seven per cent in 
1995) look to online sources for news each week,and 
that 77 per cent of those aged 18-29 “like having so 
many sources to chose from.” In contrast, older age 
groups less accustomed to interactive media are not 
so likely to find this diversity appealing (70 per cent 
of those aged 30 to 49, 64 per cent of those aged 50 to 
64 and 52 per cent of over 65s). It’s still too early to 
tell just what impact this increasing use of online news 
is having on the public. 
Personalized news 
The Internet also permits much greater custo- 
mization of news. Because of its ability to enable 
on-demand media, as well as audience segmenta- 
tion, the Internet permits audiences and news orga- 
nizations to provide increasingly personalized news. 
This personalization is a two-edged sword. 
Although it can permit audiences to get just the 
news they want, such as financial news customized 
to their own investment portfolio, it can also increase 
the level of audience fragmentation already ram- 
pant in the media. 
However, it’s also worth noting that there is a 
second type of customization of news possible only 
on the Internet, and this type is not necessarily a 
contributing factor to fragmentation. Unfortunately, 
it isonly in its earliest form, and in fact few news orga- 
nizations are actually employing it, although it embo- 
dies a fundamental news value—localizing the story. 
Online, it is possible to use databases that inclu-

interested in exploiting the capabilities of the online

third from a consortium of government agencies,

tions or weather patterns, can be transformed from 
a generic story reported in a uniform fashion for the 
widest possible audience, to customizable, interac- 
tive multimedia information that can permit anyone 
anywhere in the world to see what that story means 
for them in their own context.

The journalist: a disappearing

hat is the role of the journalist in the new, direct- access media system? Isthe journalist abso- 
lete? | believe not.i believe that in an online world where there isan abundance, in many 
cases an over-abundance, of information the role of the journalist becomes more important than 
ever. But that role must change. Journalists must amplify their role as sense-makers, helping direct 
the public to reliable information, and pointing out when certain online information should be ques 
tioned because of the partial nature of its source. 
Jumalists in the digital age must be even more zealous in their pursuit of the truth, of balance 
and fairness. These values are not necessarily part of the tradition of other “ content” providers 
who now have a ready-to-use medium to reach a global audience. 
Democracy depends on the effectiveness of its journalistic institutions to provide a fourth branch 
of government to act asa check on the other three, the executive, the legislative and the judicial. 
Journalism'sonly real power comes in the court of public opinion, and without credibility, this power 
is lost. 
In the age of online digital media, entrepreneurial journalists and journalism organizations must 
seek new ways to re-engage an increasingly global public without sacrificing any of the traditional 
newsroom values of accuracy, fact-checking, use of reliable sources and independence from cam- 
mercial governmental and other influences. if it can succeed in striking this balance, journalism 
will enjoy a renaissance in the 21st century, and society will be its beneficiary. A failure to find this 
balance can only lead te the collapse of impartial journalism and the loss of reliable information

also possible to see how much particular candidates

Election Commission. 
Finally, the DigitalEarth.gov initiative is an effort 
to provide a virtual representation of the planet enabling 
anyone online to “explore and interact with the vast 
amounts of natural and cultural information gathered 
about the Earth.” Not yet fully functional, the site does 
offer a series of operational prototypes, including three 
dimensional (3D) interactive models of the entire Earth 
offering detailed weather data collected via satellite 
around the globe, interactive 3D terrestrial topogra- 
phic visualizations of any part of the Earth,and much 
more. One of the principal agents in the DigitalEarth 
initiative is the U.S. government. In contrast to days 
past, government agencies, such as NASA, can now 
easily bring their “news” directly to the public via the 
Internet. 
This third example also illustrates an important shift 
in the long-standing relationship between news sources, 
news organizations and the public. In the past, news 
sources had to be challenged almost exclusively through 
news organizations before the public. In turn, the public 
looked almost exclusively to news organizations to filter, 
or act as gatekeeper, for news produced by others. The 
Internet changes this triangular relationship. Now ori- 
ginal sources of news and the public interface directly.

owards Mark Twain’s wry observation, “I’m 
all for progress, it’s change I don’t like.” But the 
rapid development of the Internet has forced 
changes, like it or not,in newsroom behaviour. 
While some changes are breathing new life into 
newsgathering, others are less welcome.Long-stan- 
ding notions of accountable, reliable and quality 
journalism are under intolerable pressure in the 
hothouse atmosphere of global competition. T here 
is little evidence yet that the long-heralded empo- 
werment of users is going to alter the balance of 
power in favour of consumers. 
Many celebrate the Internet as the vanguard in 
the dawning of the new media age, offering inter- 
activity, the end of information scarcity and ins- 
tant,inexpensive, global communication. T here are 
of course great advantages. 
Thousands of the nearly four million web sites 
now in existence have been developed by traditio- 
nal media. Traditional media organizations have 
turned to the web to establish information-rich 
intranets for internal office use—many of them with 
access to collections of public records or back- 
ground information on timely subjects. 
Personal computers and digital editors enable 
reporters to digest and revise data on spreadsheets, to 
manipulate images, to edit sound and image for 
broadcast, to insert, cut, add, and to check out 
F: much of the 1990s journalists have tended

verification of the past can be done in seconds. 
Huge databanks enable rapid and solid 
research. At the same time networks for global soli- 
darity ensure that dissidents in China are not for- 
gotten, opposition radio in Belgrade stays on the 
air in the face of Serbian censorship, and thousands 
of protesters are mobilized to embarrass the 
bureaucrats of the global economy in Seattle. 
But there is a dark side of the information revo- 
lution. Much of the information available on the 
Internet is dull, unreliable and trivial. T he reality of 
using the Worldwide Web for millions is endless 
waiting, unintended disconnection,an abundance 
of unwanted information and high telephone 
charges. Discussion groups, much admired for pro- 
viding access to information and diverse opinions, 
are in reality hotbeds of rumour and gossip where 
conversation about issues can swiftly degenerate 
into rude, offensive and tasteless discourse. Tech- 
nical questions often elicit inaccurate answers. 
Journalists have to be on their guard in the rush 
to meet deadlines not to absorb the unsavoury pre- 
judices of crackpots or be taken in by the bogus 
information that swills around the Internet. 
At the same time, the radical edge of the Inter- 
net is in danger of being blunted by the restructu- 
ring of the wider information and communication »

industry. Increasing deregulation of the informa- 
tion market and the growth of global media corpo- 
rations add to a widespread sense of unease over the 
suffocating spread of advertising and sponsorship 
across the Internet. 
Although there are new online news services, 
traditional press agencies and mainstream media 
leaders—CNN the BBC,and every major quality 
newspaper on the planet—are already established as 
key information providers. The advantage of low 
production and distribution does open the door to 
alternative information services, but the Internet 
increasingly is becoming the domain of media 
brand names that are linked to the major players of 
the global media market. An unprecedented wave of 
mergers and acquisitions among global media 
giants has created ten colossal vertically integrated 
media conglomerates. Six of them—News Corpo- 
ration, Time Warner,D isney, Bertelsmann, Viacom 
and T Cl—are already able to mix and match a full 
range of media services, including Internet outlets. 
Media conglomeration and commercialism in 
media content are driving down standards of jour- 
nalism and reducing the range of ideological and 
‘Press excitement was too intense 
for ordinary professional 
standards to prevail’ 
cultural output. Some eminent personages from 
within the media world itself complain that media 
are increasingly self-serving, vulgar, biased and 
malicious. Newspapers and television are ever more 
profit-centred, while journalism is intrusive, inac- 
curate and shallow with the dramatization of half- 
truths and the promulgation of information from 
unidentified sources. 
These criticisms were particularly pertinent to 
media coverage of the Clinton-Monica Lewinsky 
saga where, according one British media critic 
“press excitement was too intense for ordinary pro- 
fessional standards to prevail”! Ironically, it was 
this story that provided the first clear evidence of 
the Internet’s arrival on the world news scene. The 
dramatic online publication of the Kenneth Starr 
report on President Clinton’s relationship with 
Lewinsky was, according to United States media 
critic Jon Katz,the event that “ratified the Internet 
as America’s premiere means of rapidly dissemina- 
ting critical civic information” .2 
It certainly generated interest. This 120,000- 
word text file was seen by almost 28 million people 
in the first two days it was online—greater than the 
combined circulation of America’s top 50 daily 
newspapers. 
Although Starr proved that the Internet is a

perfect place for breaking news, the event also 
underscored just how important journalism is to the 
process of understanding the world around us. While 
millions of surfers had direct access to the Starr 
report in its tedious entirety, old style media scored 
highly by making sense of it. Newspapers and tele- 
vision ratings soared. 
People will always turn to a professional filter to 
make sense of massive amounts of raw data. But 
they also appreciate depth in reporting to better 
understand what is going on. Too often, however, 
modern news organizations give themselves no time 
for inquiry beyond trite and superficial reporting 
and analysis. 
Sound-bite journalism 
In the age of instant news, journalists are urged 
to compress complex and difficult issues into sound 
bites. There is no room for detailed research and 
background reporting. News organizations are not 
in the business of taking risks as they compete 
furiously for market share in the burgeoning media 
market. Cuts in editorial budgets, particularly in 
the field of investigative journalism, may explain 
why so much low-quality reporting finds its way 
into media both on and offline. 
Nevertheless, the values of editing, of profes- 
sionalism and ethical journalism remain the quality 
benchmarks for media. But these standards are not 
enforced in the online world. While complaints rage 
around the heads of traditional editors, online jour- 
nalism is largely unchallenged. In most countries 
media content is regulated through transparent 
structures, often administered by media themselves. 
Many people are sceptical about the effectiveness of 
Press Councils and broadcasting authorities, but 
even these watchdog bodies are missing in the 
online world. 
It is clear that the differences between new 
information services and traditional media are 
disappearing at a rapid rate. But some journalists 
remain unconvinced that the creation of a new 
media landscape will succeed in creating better 
understanding or widening the democratic process. 
That will only happen if the traditional mission of 
journalism and media to serve wider public and 
democratic interests is restored as the central and 
primary goal of communication and information 
policy. 
Absurd early predictions of the imminent death 
of traditional journalism have given way to a reali- 
zation that people suffering from information over- 
load and drowning in information are starving for 
the truth.As much as ever the public needs skilled 
news gatherers to sort through the confusion and 
chaos of the information society, to put information 
in context and to present it in digestible chunks. 
So, the future of journalism should be secure. After 
all,software robots will never overtake the work of 
journalists. Technology can do many things, but it 
cannot yet seek out and then elegantly speak the 
truth. Technology is only a tool and it should not be 
confused with talent. |

### 118811: For East Europe's women, a rude awakening

FOR EAST EUROPES WOMEN, 
A RUDE AWAKENING 
 
D Elisabeth Kulakowska 
Women are starting to react to the fallout from eastern Europe’s economic transition which has 
hit them hard, bringing growing poverty, social decline and prostitution 
In Romania and Russia, they have 
started by highlighting domestic vio- 
lence. In Poland, they are fighting for 
legal abortion. In Bulgaria and Hungary, 
they campaign to make girls aware of the 
dangers of making “easy money” through 
prostitution. Women everywhere in eas- 
tern Europe are trying to organize in 
defence of their rights. They have an 
uphill job on their hands. 
The political and economic changes 
which have swept the former countries of 
the Soviet bloc since the early 1990s have 
generally pushed women aside, both eco- 
nomically and in terms of their presence 
in government and administration. 
Equality of the sexes is still written into all 
the national constitutions of central and 
eastern Europe. But the reality is quite 
different. 
The first 
to be fired 
A UNICEF report, Women in 
Transition,! which looks at 27 formerly 
communist states, confirms this in detail. 
“While communism brought women 
many advantages, especially in education 
and health care, it did not manage to 
bring real equality of the sexes,” said 
UNICEF director-general Carol Bellamy 
when the report came out in September 
1999. “Today, in the transition to a mar- 
ket economy, the situation of women is 
deteriorating.” 
Since 1990, in every country of the 
region except Hungary, economic 
1 The report was produced by UNICEF’s Regional 
Monitoring Project (MONEE) at the UNICEF 
Innocenti Research Centre in Florence, Italy. It 
analyses in detail how the fall of communism has 
affected the 150 million women and 50 million 
girls who live in central and eastern Europe, in 
the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) 
and in the Baltic states.

Women held some 14 million of the 26 million jobs that have disappeared in eastern Europe since 1989. 
     
    
Some, like this Romanian woman, have gone back to work in the fields. 
restructuring has especially affected 
industries with a large number of women 
workers. Where there are both male and 
female employees, the women have been 
laid off before the men, in line with well- 
known discriminatory practices which 
send women “back to their homes”. 
“Of the 26 million or so jobs that have 
disappeared in eastern Europe since 
1989, about 14 million were held by 
women,” says Bellamy. Today unemploy- 
ment among women is about five per cent 
higher than among men. 
Employers, especially in Poland, will 
sometimes ask a job applicant to take a 
test to prove she is not pregnant. In 
Bulgaria and Romania, the newspapers 
are filled with blatantly sexist job adverti- 
sements. 
Because of the seriousness of the eco- 
nomic crisis, governments have sharply 
cut social welfare expenditure. They have 
also abolished many laws passed under 
communism that gave privileged status to 
single mothers and mothers with young 
children, and provided for infants 
through day-care allowances or creche 
facilities. The ending of these benefits has 
reduced women’s chances of getting a job 
or finding a new one. And when women 
do have a job, they get paid less than their 
male colleagues. The gap in pay is an ave- 
rage 24 per cent in Russia, 16 per cent in 
Poland and 15 per cent in Hungary, 
UNICEF says. According to specialists, the 
result is a “feminization of poverty”. 
One of the most serious consequences 
of the economic crisis and the opening of 
national borders is the growing number of 
young women who are being lured into 
prostitution or enmeshed in international 
sex rings. About half a million young 
women from eastern Europe, including 
Russia, are now prostitutes in the West, 
according to the Polish NGO La Strada 
and the Vienna-based International 
Organization for Migration. Regina 
Indsheva, head of the Women’s Alliance 
for Development, in Sofia, says, “10,000 
Bulgarian prostitutes are ‘on the market’ »

Sexually transmitted diseases, inclu- 
ding Aids, are spreading. One young 
woman in every 100 in Russia has syphi- 
lis, according to UNICEF. In the 27 coun- 
tries sur veyed in the report, cases of HIV 
infection rose from 30,000 in 1994 to 
270,000 by the end of 1998, says Bellamy. 
In addition, there 1s rising alcoholism and 
drug addiction among younger and youn- 
ger women, especially in Russia. 
Domestic violence against women, a 
taboo subject that was totally hidden 
under communism, has recently made 
headlines for the first time in Romania 
and Poland. The UNICEF report says that

in most cases the attacker runs no risk of

Georgia, hitting a spouse is not illegal. In 
Slovenia, it is only punished in “serious”

Each year, “60,000 women in

In Poland, abortion has stirred up tre- 
mendous debate. It was allowed between 
1959 and 1993, and was then severely 
restricted until 1996, when it was permit- 
ted again before being banned once more 
a year later except in cases of rape, a 
deformed foetus or when the mother’s life 
is in danger. These decisions have been 
greatly influenced by the Roman Catholic 
Church. More than 30,000 secret abor- 
tions take place in Poland every year, 
according to local NGOs. The Polish 
Federation for Women and Family 
Planning, founded in 1991, is campai- 
gning along with other organizations for 
legalized abortion. 
Romania has gone in the opposite 
direction. There, abortion was banned 
between 1965 and 1989 by the Ceausescu 
regime and was allowed without restric-

WOMEN’S STATUS 
UNDER SOVIET COMMUNISM 
 
fter the October 1917 revolution, the Soviet 
Ao proclaimed the emancipation of 
women through a “harmonious blending” of 
work and motherhood. The communist Family 
Laws, adopted in 1919, amended in 1926 and 
1936 and later passed on to the satellite coun- 
tries, guaranteed women a large number of 
rights. 
The state invested heavily to give women bet- 
ter access to health care, education and jobs. An 
extensive system of child care was set up, except 
in Poland. After the Second World War, the deter- 
mination to make jobs more accessible to 
women had more to do with the urgency of 
rebuilding countries in ruins than with egalitarian 
ideals. Despite implementing programmes to 
improve the situation of women, the communist   
regimes did not manage or even try to establish 
true equality between the sexes. 
Sexual discrimination was never tackled 
openly and mentalities remained very conserva- 
tive. Women in fact had the double burden of a 
job and looking after a home. They worked an 
average of 15 hours a week more than men, 
according to surveys. Equal access to jobs never 
went along with more equal sharing of family 
responsibilities or household chores. 
Abortion stirred up argument under commu- 
nism. In the 1920s, Bolshevik Russia took a very 
liberal position but Stalin banned abortion in 1936. 
It only became freely available again in 1955 but 
the conditions in which it was performed in hospi- 
tals were dreadful. In the present Russian 
Federation, itis still legal but is no longer free. WH   
tion after 1990.This led to a sharp drop 
in the hitherto very common practice of 
abandoning unwanted children in dead- 
end “orphanages”. In many countries 
(including Hungary, Lithuania, Slovenia, 
Slovakia and Ukraine), access to abortion 
has been either challenged or restricted. 
Equality slogans 
with a hollow ring 
Barbara Labuda, an adviser on social 
questions to the president of Poland, was 
a fervent advocate of women’s rights in 
the 1980s in Solidarnosc, eastern 
Europe’s first independent trade union. 
This tiny blonde-haired woman, who 
founded the women’s group in parliament 
in Warsaw, admits she is sometimes dis- 
heartened by the lack of involvement, 
especially political involvement, of 
women in eastern Europe. 
Only 13 per cent of the members of 
Poland’s parliament are women. In 
Bulgaria,the figure is 10.4 per cent, in the 
Czech Republic 10 per cent, in Estonia 
12.9 per cent, in Hungary 8 per cent, in 
Romania 7 per cent, in Slovakia 14.7 per 
cent and in Slovenia 7.8 per cent. 
Demands by women for a better social 
status are still generally scorned in eastern 
European societies. “The slogan about 
equality of the sexes was drummed into us 
for years by the communist party, but we 
knew perfectly well it did not correspond to 
reality,” says Labuda.“This is why women 
now are very wary of us.” 
Women feel crushed by a very heavy 
daily burden which discourages activism, 
says Erzsebet Szabo, Hungary’s official 
mediator between the government and 
citizens complaining about abuses by 
public officials. 
Networking 
businesswomen 
Bellamy is less pessimistic. For a start, 
democratization in eastern Europe has 
led to the setting up of many women’s 
associations and NGOs that are very acti- 
ve campaigners. In the Czech Republic, 
for example, 70 per cent of the members 
of NGOs are women, and 85 per cent of 
NGOs were run by women 
in 1984. Poland, where civil society was 
the first to organize during the commu- 
nist regime, has some 200 associations 
and groups working to promote the cause 
of women or defend their rights. The 
dozen biggest of them have at most 100 
members. Romania has about 60 
women’s associations, as do Albania and 
Bulgaria. 
Women are also getting more and 
more involved in business. In nine of the 
countries? studied by UNICEF, a quarter 
of commercial companies are headed by 
women. In Bucharest, Cristina Grigorescu 
runs AFIR which, with 100 members, is 
eastern Europe’s first businesswomen’s 
association. In all the other countries in 
2 The Czech Republic, Slovakia, Yugoslavia, 
Bulgaria,Romania, Estonia,Latvia,Lithuania and 
Russia. 
ETHICS 
the region, businesswomen are forming 
networks, especially to fight the reluctan- 
ce of banks to provide credit to women. 
The Beijing 
connection 
A turning point for women’s organiza- 
tions in eastern Europe came in 1995. That 
year, for the first time, they were able to 
take part freely in the United Nations Inter- 
national Women’s Conference when it met 
in Beijing. They made new contacts, with 
each other and with Western organizations. 
Since then, the KARAT Coalition has 
brought together 10 associations (from 
Albania, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, 
Macedonia, Poland ,Russia,Romania,Slo- 
vakia, Ukraine and Hungary) and holds 
regular conferences. 
In all the countries,such organizations 
are just starting out on a long journey and 
their achievements so far are few. But they 
are all still fighting, and counting on sup- 
port from younger generations, to ensure 
that women of the post-communist era are 
not labelled as “second-class citizens” and 
that democracy can thus be truly respec- 
ted in their countries. | 
  
TEN COURSES 
OF ACTION 
The main aims of eastern Europe’s women’s 
movements are to: 
  
® encourage political parties to get more 
women to take part in the electoral 
process; 
@® draft policies and professional practices 
that broaden possibilities for women; 
@® encourage women to run companies by 
giving them training and access to credit; 
@® organize public debate about the equality 
of the sexes; 
® combat violence against women; 
® encourage parents to share responsibility 
for educating children; 
® encourage the state to continue helping 
single parents, most of whom are women; 
® maintain and strengthen the educational 
level of women; 
® fulfil the targets of the World Health 
Organization and UNIcer in the field of 
maternal and child health care; 
® press for new laws.

### 118812: Dubrovnik reborn

DUBROVNIK 
REBORN 
D Maja Nodari 
  
Seriously damaged by the conflict in former Yugoslavia, the great medieval city on the shores 
of the Adriatic has been restored in record time 
“My wife and her mother died 
a without ever seeing our family home 
again,” says Ivan Kamber,a retiree in 
his 70s who lived until December 1991 in 
a magnificent 17th-century baroque 
house in the centre of Dubrovnik. “My 
brother-in-law, the painter Ivo Grbic, is 
still living in a hotel. All his canvases went 
up in smoke, along with his ethnographic 
collection and photo archive. I try to get 
by in this 30-square-metre studio that the 
city provided us with in June 1992.1 hope 
that I shall soon be able to return home.” 
A scorched facade and soot-covered 
walls are all that remains of the splendour 
of Kamber’s old home, which was hit by 
fire-bombs on December 6, 1991. 
Eight other buildings in Dubrovnik’s 
historic centre were just as badly dama- 
ged. Their ruins bear eloquent witness to 
the recent history of this unique jewel of 
the world’s cultural and historic heritage, 
which was described in 1929 by the 
English playwright George Bernard Shaw 
as “paradise on earth”. 
A rain 
of shells 
The medieval commune of Dubrovnik 
was founded in Late Antiquity (earlier 
than the 7th century AD), and grew first 
under Byzantine and then Venitian rule.It 
became an independent republic in 1358. 
A maritime and trading power that rival- 
led the Venetian Republic, it reached its 
apogee in the 15th and 16th centuries. It 
even managed to keep its political inde- 
pendence under Ottoman rule, which 
began in 1526. But it was sacked in 1806 
during the Franco-Russian war, and lost 
its status as a city-state two years later. It 
came under French rule and was ceded to 
Austria in 1815. A century later, it beca- 
me part of Yugoslavia. 
Dubrovnik’s urban fabric dates from

the 13th century, when its imposing forti- 
fications began to be built. These 1,940- 
metre-long walls and ramparts still stand 
intact. The austere elegance of the historic 
centre is a perfect blend of Gothic, 
Renaissance and Baroque architecture, 
making Dubrovnik the incarnation of what 
the Swiss art historian Jacob Burckhardt 
called “the state as a work of art”. 
The city’s style and identity have sur- 
vived despite being hit by many earth- 
quakes over the centuries, including one 
in 1667 which killed half the inhabitants. 
More recently, two severe quakes dama- 
ged about 1,000 buildings in 1979, the 
year the city was put on UNEsco’s World 
Heritage List (see box). 
The repair work was not complete 
when Dubrovnik was attacked in the 
autumn of 1991 by the Serbian- 
Montenegrin army. The Yugoslav conflict 
dealt a terrible blow to the cultural heri- 
tage of a city which, apart from the siege

of 1806, had never before come under 
fire. Within a year, about 2,000 shells rai- 
ned down on the walled city, damaging 
563 of its 824 buildings and two-thirds of 
its famous “fifth facade” —the roofs which 
provide a large part of the city’s beauty 
and harmony. Public and religious buil- 
dings, homes, cobbled streets, sculp- 
tures—all Dubrovnik’s ancient heritage 
was threatened with destruction. At the 
beginning of the bombardment, the city 
was placed on the List of World Heritage 
in Danger. 
Bandaging 
the wounds 
Reconstruction soon got under way, 
but it was not easy to reconcile the urgent 
needs of the people of a wounded city 
with the imperatives of restoring a World 
Heritage site. The first priority was to 
provide the inhabitants with a minimum 
degree of comfort, e.g. tarred felt was laid 
on broken roofs to keep the rain out. But 
provisional measures of this kind were 
soon replaced by long-term restoration 
project. In February 1993, UNEScoO laun- 
ched an action plan to save Dubrovnik, 
and specialists got down to work. 
To rebuild the roofs, the original raf- 
ters had to be strengthened—some of 
them dated from the 16th century. Some 
490,000 tiles had to be replaced.The ori- 
ginal tiles, known as kupa in Croat, had 
been made in the village of Kupari, about 
15 km from the city, and dated from the 
time of the Dubrovnik republic. But the 
workshops had closed at the beginning of 
the 19th century, and specialists now 
faced the delicate task of finding a kind of 
tile which could as far as possible be 
made using the original techniques and 
materials. After painstaking research they 
found a solution, and a Croatian and a 
French firm were commissioned to 
manufacture the replacement tiles. 
Restoration that rigorously respects 
the principle of authenticity is no easy

task when so many old crafts have died 
out. After a war, when resources are scar - 
ce, it is even harder. Tourism, which was 
Dubrovnik’s livelihood, was wiped out by 
the war. Revenue from two million over- 
night hotel stays per year had been the 
main source of funding for heritage 
conservation. But in 1998, the municipal 
authorities recorded barely 650,000 over- 
night stays. 
A 7-year 
repair job 
But determination triumphed, and 
Croatian and international teams of 
architects, sculptors, restorers and other 
experts managed to complete the bulk of 
the work within 7 years. In December 
1998, Dubrovnik was taken off the list of 
World Heritage in Danger. 
Much of the funding came from the 
Croatian government and the Dubrovnik 
Reconstruction Office. But the work 
could not have been done without aid 
from private Croatian and other sources, 
notably The International Trust for 
Croatian Monuments (United Kingdom) 
and the Rotary Club of Klagenfurt 
(Austria). UNEscO took immediate 
action. It drew up a list of the damage, 
earmarking $300,000 for the most urgent 
work and launching an international 
fund-raising campaign.Alone, Dubrovnik 
could not have tackled a repair job with 
an estimated price tag of more than 
$18,500,000 for the city within the walls 
and $30 million for the urban area as a 
whole. 
Artists also pitched in to help. The 
famous Croatian pianist Ivo Pogorelic gave 
two charity concerts, one in London and 
one in Brussels,whose proceeds made the 
first financial contribution to the costs, esti- 
mated at $500,000, of rebuilding the head- 
quarters of Dubrovnik’s summer festival, a 
prestigious cultural event that since its 
inception in 1950 had attracted theatre 
companies, musicians and folk performers 
from all over the world. The headquarters

Stone from 
ancient quarries 
Stonemason Vinko Fabris dipped into 
his own stock of stone for the most deli- 
cate repairs on the church of St Blaise, 
the city’s patron saint, whose narthex, 
pillars and balustrades had been serious- 
ly damaged. The original stonework came 
from the nearby island of Vrnik, whose 
now-abandoned quarries had been 
exploited since Antiquity. Today Fabris 
uses time-honoured methods to extract 
small quantities of limestone from these 
quarries. He is the living embodiment of 
a longstanding tradition of the island of 
Korcula, where he was born and from 
where the builders of Dubrovnik took 
most of their stone. 
For six weeks, he and a Dubrovnik 
sculptor, Ivo Jasic, worked together to 
reconstitute the church’s balustrade.

creating,” says Jasic, “it was an honour for 
me to be involved in the collective work of

their mark.” 
The church’s baroque festoon, to the 
right of the main entrance, was restored 
by French craftsmen Frédéric Mohus, a 
stone-carver, and Jean Garder, a sculp- 
tor, who familiarized themselves with 
the zubatka, an ancient Croatian serra- 
ted tool, to obtain results as close as 
possible to the work of the old master 
craftsmen. 
The damage to the church was a big 
blow to the inhabitants of Dubrovnik, 
who have revered St Blaise since 972 
when, according to legend, this martyr 
from Sebastia, in Asia Minor, saved the 
city from attack by the Venetians. On the 
pretext of wanting to stock up on water 
and food on their way to the East, the 
Venetians landed in Dubrovnik and took 
advantage of their hosts’ kindness to note

on coinage, official seals and state flags. 
Statues of him guard the gates of the city. 
He is still revered today and on February

place in his honour. 
In recent years, the parade has passed

WORLD HERITAGE IN DANGER 
swell asthe World Heritage List, which now 
Avera 630 sites in 118 countries, the 
World Heritage Committee maintains a list of 
endangered sites that require special monito- 
ring and urgent conservation measures. The list 
was set up in 1979 to alert governments and 
public opinion about the need to protect natural 
and cultural sites of outstanding universal value 
that are threatened by natural forces or human 
actions. 
Cultural sites that have been placed on the 
endangered list include Kotor (Yugoslavia), des- 
troyed by an earthquake in 1979, the royal 
palaces at Abomey (Benin), seriously damaged 
by a hurricane in 1985, and Timbuktu (Mali), 
which is under threat from advancing desert 
sand. Natural sites include Mount Nimba (Gui- 
nea and Cote d'Ivoire) and Yellowstone (United 
States), both of which are threatened by mining 
activity, and the remains of the ancient city of 
Butrint, which was looted in the spring of 1997 
during the uprising in southern Albania. 
In November 1999, four new sites were pla- 
ced on the List of World Heritage in Danger, 
bringing the total to 27. They were the Iguacu 
National Park (Brazil), the monument complex 
at Hampi (India), both of which are threatened 
by road and bridge building, the Rwenzori 
Mountains (Uganda), which have been occu- 
pied since 1997 by rebels who prevent conser- 
vation activities, and the Salonga National Park 
(Democratic Republic of Congo), which has 
been spared major fallout from armed conflict 
but is targeted by poachers and disfigured by   
illegal construction. 
Like the four other world heritage sites in 
Congo, Salonga can now get help from a UNESCO 
project. Largely funded by the United Nations 
Foundation, the project provides aid to the tune 
of $4.1 million, mainly for training and equip- 
ping staff and protecting biodiversity. 
Once a site is on the endangered list, the 
World Heritage Committee draws up an action 
programme in consultation with the state 
concerned, and monitors restoration work 
through to its completion. This is a very long job, 
as shown by how few sites have been taken off 
the endangered list—so far three natural sites 
(Djoudj in Senegal, Ngorongoro in Tanzania and 
Plitvice in Croatia) and two cultural sites 
(Dubrovnik in Croatia and Wieliczka in Poland). 
The inclusion of a site on the endangered list 
is not always considered a boon by the state 
concerned. Some countries ask for sites to be lis- 
ted as a way of attracting international attention 
to their problemsand getting help, but others see 
listing as a stigma. However, listing a site as heri- 
tage in danger is often the only way to meet 
conservation needs effectively and urgently. 
To benefit from listing, states parties to the 
World Heritage Convention must inform the 
World Heritage Committee as early as possible 
of threats to sites on their territory. Individuals, 
NGOs and other groups can also lobby the Com- 
mittee by writing to the Unesco World Heritage 
Centre at 7 Place de Fontenoy, 75352 Paris 07

### 118814: Indonesia: learning the ropes of press freedom

INDONESIA: 
LEARNING THE ROPES 
OF PRESS FREEDOM 
  
D Jose Manuel Tesoro 
   
  
CONNEXIONS 
Tight government control over the Indonesian media has ended, but there is still no social 
consensus about how far press freedom really goes 
changed since the fall of its longtime 
president Suharto, simply step out 
onto the street.Do not even search for one 
of the almost daily demonstrations that 
snarl traffic in Jakarta and other big cities. 
Just head as far as the nearest newsstand. 
There, on display, are the dozens of loud 
magazines,saucy tabloids and hard-hitting 
newspapers that have sprung up since riots 
in the capital ended the former general’s 
32-year rule in May 1998. 
Granted, media penetration is still low in 
this country of 204 million, the world’s fourth- 
largest in size. But in a short period of time, 
it has undergone nothing short of a press 
explosion. In the 12 months following Suhar- 
to’s resignation, the government granted 718 
new media licences, a leap from the 289 issued 
in the 53 years since the country’s indepen- 
dence. And more recently, in November 1999, 
the government abolished the all-powerful 
Department of Information (known as Dep- 
pen). For decades, this fixture of government 
exerted tight control over the media and for- 
bade coverage of any subject that stoked sen- 
timents of ethnicity, religion, race or belief— 
a justifiable policy in a nation made up of 
numerous ethnic and religious groups. But 
that rule was gradually stretched to cover any- 
thing that annoyed the government. 
In the mid-1990s, as Suharto’s authority 
was increasingly questioned, the press 
became bolder and the government har- 
dened its stance. When Tempo, a leading 
newsweekly, covered a debate within govern- 
ment over the purchase of 39 warships from 
the former East German navy, a deal 
arranged by the then-Minister of Research 
and Technology B.J. Habibie, its licence was 
revoked. Tempo successfully challenged the de 
facto ban in two lower courts before the

Under the Suharto regime in Indonesia, the newsweekly Tempo was banned for covering 
a politically sensitive topic. Its reappearance in October 1998, above, symbolized the beginning 
of a new era of press freedom. 
Supreme Court upheld Deppen’s decision. 
The government then went after journalists 
who had formed an independent journa- 
lists’ union. Many lost their jobs while two 
members and an office assistant received 
jail terms in 1995 for distributing informa- 
tion considered offensive to the government. 
King of Spades 
A popular TV talk show was cancelled 
after its host interviewed one of the judges 
who ruled in favour of Tempo. But the jour- 
nalists’resolve did not wane, especially from 
late 1997, when the media did its best to 
cover the increasing discontent and unrest 
throughout the archipelago, especially the 
student-led anti-Suharto demonstrations. 
After Indonesia’s parliament reelected 
Suharto to a seventh 5-year term, D&R 
magazine ran a cover portraying the president 
as the King of Spades. The act drew a sharp 
rebuke from Deppen, which initiated pro- 
ceedings against the magazine. But before the 
case could be resolved, riots erupted across 
Indonesia and Suharto resigned. 
When his vice-president, Mr. Habibie, 
stepped up to succeed him as a transitional 
figure, there were initial concerns about whe- 
ther the small gains the press had made cove- 
ring the tumult surrounding Suharto’s fall 
would be rolled back.T hose concerns multi- 
plied when Habibie appointed East Timor 
veteran Lieutenant General YunusYosfiah as 
minister of information. Yet expanded press 
freedom has actually been one of the much- 
maligned post-Suharto transitional govern- 
ment’s most significant accomplishments. 
One of Yosfiah’s first acts was to take 
away Deppen’s right to revoke press 
licences. He also streamlined the process of 
granting government approval to new media 
organizations. He even asked applicants to »

report any Deppen official who sought 
favours—such as stakes in media start- 
ups—in return for a licence. He cut the 
number of daily state-run radio news broad- 
casts that stations were required to air from 
14 to four. And he allowed the formation of 
other journalists’associations than the state- 
sanctioned PWI. In a recent interview, Yos- 
fiah explained the changes:“Now it’s dif- 
ferent. We consider journalists as colleagues. 
We have a new paradigm.” That new stance 
was symbolized by the reopening of Tempo 
in October 1998. 
At the same time, a group of publishers 
and broadcasters also began efforts to revise 
Suharto-era press regulations. The result 
was Law no. 40, passed in September 1999, 
and described as “the first law liberating the 
press from tyranny,” says S.L. Batubara, 
chair of the Indonesian Newspaper Publi- 
shers Association. The new law (see box) 
revises 25 articles in the previous press law 
that left the position of the press largely up 
to the discretion of the information minister. 
It abolishes the system of licensing the 
media, and transfers regulation of the press 
to the industry itself. The Indonesian Press 
and Broadcasting Society is now encoura- 
ging its members to set up internal ombud- 
smen, and is drafting a common code of 
conduct. 
Although the law leaves many questions 
unresolved—especially with regard to 
broadcasting, film and programme censor- 
ship and the apportioning of frequencies— 
the reform of Deppen’s role and the laws 
under which it controlled the press do mark 
a step forward.M any local journalists report

Neiss greets Megawati Sukarnoputri, now vice president of Indonesia. 
work. But legal restrictions formed only 
part of the constraints on Indonesia’s press 
under Suharto. The press is still vulnerable 
on other fronts. For example, while Indo- 
nesia’s laws expressly forbid foreign owner- 
ship of media, less is said about domestic 
conflicts of interest. Nothing protects jour- 
nalists from media owners. 
Habits that die hard 
Although Habibie himself tolerated daily 
criticism of his government and its poli- 
cies, some of his allies and supporters were 
less forgiving. Unrest erupted in Jakarta 
when Indonesia’s electoral college convened 
in November 1998 to confirm Habibie and 
his policies. Soon afterwards, private tele- 
vision station SCTV came under pressure. 
A state-owned bank called in the station’s 
$34-million loan, which triggered the sale of 
a majority stake in the company. A firm 
run by Habibie’s brother took the lead in 
negotiating for a share. In a statement, 
SCTYV news producers claimed that the 
government was punishing the station for its 
reports on the tumult. 
Another grey area is the criminal code, 
which retains many articles relating to the 
press,including one that threatens as long 
as four years in prison for writing or broad- 
casting enmity, hatred or insult to members 
of government. The criminal code poses 
an obstacle to coverage of past and present 
government misdeed s—especially since law 
in the past has regularly been used to brow- 
beat and control whistle-blowers. Yasmen 
Umar, editor of West Kalimantan’s daily 
Pontianak Pos, says the public does not 
know how to deal with negative coverage. 
Aggrieved parties, he says “head straight 
for the courts,not the right of reply.” 
In addition, public officials’reluctance 
to provide prompt and accurate information 
makes it difficult to report on government 
activities, much less suspected corruption. 
“It’s a constraint on our industry that our 
functionaries, our public figures,don’t pro- 
vide access to information,” complains 
Batubara. One recent case was a scandal 
involving the siphoning of over $70 mil- 
lion in bank-restructuring funds by figures 
connected to the government and the ruling 
party. For over three months, Habibie’s 
government refused to release an indepen- 
dent audit detailing the money trail and 
identifying beneficiaries. T he reason cited 
was banking secrecy. 
Journalists have to worry not only about 
those in positions of power. Post-Suharto 
Indonesia, with its economic collapse, rising 
separatist, ethnic and religious sentiments 
and politically charged atmosphere, is 
simply a much more dangerous place for 
journalists to work. Not everyone accepts 
the need for, or even the principle of, a free 
press. T he resistance lies both in a lingering 
sense that the media is responsible for poli- 
tical education and in perceptions by the 
public of bias among publications or jour- 
nalists. “The public for the first time has to 
put up with a free press, and views that 
may be incompatible with one pressure 
group or another,” says A. Lin Neumann, 
Bangkok-based adviser to the Southeast 
Asian Press Alliance. 
One example is the coverage of conflict 
between Muslims and Christians in Ambon, 
capital of multi-religious Maluku province. 
After riots broke out there in early 1999, the 
city was practically partitioned between the 
two warring groups. Christian reporters 
felt safe only in Christian areas. The same

went for Muslim journalists in Muslim 
neighbourhoods. The inability to cover both 
sides complicated the already sensitive and 
emotional issue of reporting religious-linked 
violence. Ambonese Christians felt that the 
national press focused more on attacks on 
Muslims, and became hostile to Indonesians 
working for local news organizations. 
Meanwhile, in EastT imor in the run-up 
to its U.N.-sponsored referendum on inde- 
pendence in August 1999, the situation was 
reversed. Armed pro-Jakarta militias sought 
out Indonesians and foreigners working for 
the foreign press, assuming that most outside 
observers favoured the territory’s separation 
from Indonesia. In the aftermath of the chaos 
that followed the vote,two journalists—one 
local and one foreign—lost their lives. 
With the sudden collapse of government 
restrictions, one oft-repeated complaint is 
that local journalists are not aware of their 
responsibilities and duties, much less their 
rights. “At every opportunity I always say the 
more the press are given freedom, the greater 
are the responsibilities they must assume,” 
says Atmakusumah Astraatmadja,executive 
director of the Dr. Soetomo Press Institute, 
which is one of Indonesia’s few organiza- 
tions providing formal training to journa- 
lists. Few universities have journalism facul- 
ties. 
Aside from a flurry of foreign-funded 
short seminars for local reporters, by and 
large, Indonesian journalists learn from their 
seniors and on the job. As such, standards are 
often confused with accepted practice, a 
situation exacerbated by low salaries. One 
long-standing habit is so-called “envelope 
journalism” in which reporters who attend 
press conferences receive envelopes of cash 
from the event organizer. The press also still 
largely covers current events by quoting 
public figures’ views and announcements, 
instead of setting its own agenda—a hangover 
from the Suharto era. 
Anxious readers 
question press freedom 
The Indonesian media is now unfet- 
tered. But it is also unprotected. Government 
restrictions and direction have vanished.But 
what is left is disturbingly ill-defined .Indo- 
nesian journalists and editors have to find out 
for themselves how far their communities will 
let them go; in other words, how free their 
readers or viewers will let them be. No 
consensus has been reached over how far 
the press can go in reporting the unprece- 
dented change shaking Indonesian society. A 
local media watch organization recently 
conducted a survey in which three out of four 
respondents believed that media coverage 
itself was contributing to “national disinte- 
gration.” 
The experience of Rusdi Amral, bureau 
chiefin South Sulawesi’s capital of Makassar 
for the national daily Kompas, is indicative.

TALKING TO... 


### 118815: Serbian film-maker Goran Paskaljevik

SERBIAN 
FILM-MAKER 
GORAN PASKALJEVIC 
The director of a dozen feature films internationally acclaimed for their blend 
of lyricism and realism talks about the background of his latest film, which deals with 
‘the eclipse of human consciousness caused by war 
When there’s a war on, what can 
a film-maker do? 
You can’t be indifferent to war, espe- 
cially if it’s ravaging your own country. 
But what can you do in practical terms? 
It’s very hard for film-makers to react 
quickly with their only tool, film. A poet 
can rouse the masses at the height of a 
war. But a film-maker works slowly and 
needs a lot of funding, which means that 
when the war is in your own country, your 
hands are tied. 
Anyway, you need to step back a bit, 
in time if not in place. It’s very hard to 
make a good war film in the heat of batt- 
le. The film-maker should denounce war 
while staying neutral. But in fact we very 
often take sides, consciously or uncons- 
ciously. They say history is written by 
people on the winning side. The same 
goes for war films. That’s why I don’t like 
this kind of film, with all due respects to 
Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket, the 
most brilliant war film of all time, and 
Jean Renoir’s La Grande Illusion. 
I decided to wage my war on war not 
through my work but through my position 
as a film-maker. I did that extensively 
when my latest film, The Powder Keg, 
came out in the spring of 1999, by talking 
to cinema audiences and in the media all 
over Europe and the United States. 
The Powder Keg deals with war but it isn’t a 
war film. 
For me, war is a total eclipse of human 
conscience. It’s that darkening which the 
film deals with. The script was based on 
an excellent play by Dejan Dukovski, a 
Macedonian playwright who a few years 
ago, when he was only 26, managed to 
capture the mood of the Balkans today. 
The play dealt with the war in Bosnia and 
4 6 The Unesco Courier - February 2000 
Herzegovina but it had no specific 
context of place or time. As co-author of 
the film script,I wanted to situate the plot 
in a definite place and time. So in the 
film, everything happens in the course of 
a single night in Belgrade. A night “haun- 
ted” by ordinary people whose paths 
cross and clash. Each person is a powder 
keg, so there’s an explosion. 
When we were filming in 1998, I was 
expecting a social explosion. I'd felt it 
coming in the streets of Belgrade during 
many anti-government demonstrations 
I’d taken part in. But I didn’t think the 
film was going to foreshadow a far more 
painful explosion, with a rain of missiles. 
As an opponent of the regime of Serbian 
President Slobodan Milosevic, what was your 
position on the Nato bombing in the spring of 
1999 that was supposed to overthrow him? 
The Powder Keg came out in Paris on 
March 24, the day the bombing started. 
The France 2 television channel had 
scheduled me for a live interview after its 
eight o’clock evening news programme. 
So I was in the studio, waiting for the 
news to end, when I saw live the first 
shells exploding over my country. I was so 
upset I had to leave the studio before I 
could speak. The presenter asked me what 
I was going to do. I said I was going to 
find a corner to weep in. I didn’t go back 
to the studio. 
In the days that followed, I really 
couldn’t decide whether to return to my 
country or carry on with the opening tour 
of Powder Keg. Should I be in Belgrade or 
should I be going round Western cine- 
mas? I chose the second option. I took 
part in hundreds of public discussions 
and gave as many interviews, trying to 
explain that the bombing would only 
increase the violence in my country. 
Events proved me right. The Serbian poli- 
ce, paramilitary and army immediately 
began expelling Albanians from Kosovo. I 
was ashamed of that and ashamed that 
such actions were taking place “in my 
name” as a Serb. And the violence is still 
going on. Now Kosovo, at last a secure 
place for Albanians, has become a hell not 
only for Serbs but also for Turks, Gypsies 
and even for Albanians who don’t support 
the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA).And 
Milosevic is still in power. 
I tried to explain that the bombs were 
actually falling on Serbian democracy and 
that by destroying the country, they were 
strengthening Milosevic’s hold on power. 
How, after bombing Serbia, can Europe 
say to the Serbian people that they should 
reject the authoritarian, short-sighted and 
selfish Milosevic regime and replace it 
with Western-style democracy? As a result 
of this war, the Serbs have lost the few 
points of reference they still had. They 
don’t know where to turn.T he regime has 
led them up a blind alley, the opposition 
is sporadic and disunited; Europe has 
betrayed them. If I spoke out publicly 
against Milosevic in Serbia today, the 
authorities would reply at once: “Don’t 
listen to him, he’s a Nato hireling.” Not 
many people would give me a hearing. 
Serbia’s pro-government press has already 
accused you of “treachery”. 
Yes, that was in September 1998, 
before the NATO bombing. It said I'd 
betrayed the Serbian people for having 
told the Italian newspaper La Repubblica 
that Milosevic was the main person to 
blame for the situation in Kosovo. The 
author of one article even suggested I 
ought to commit suicide if I had any self- 
respect left. Without dramatizing my 
present situation, I don’t think I'm safe

from a contrived “suicide” on the streets 
of Belgrade. But that doesn’t stop me cri- 
ticizing the regime, just as I denounced 
the bombing. One shouldn’t confuse the 
regime with the people, even if the people 
are partly responsible. I've noticed that 
the two have been bracketed together 
both in my country and in the West. 
What do you think is the people’s share 
of responsibility? 
There was a time when Milosevic was 
hailed by millions of Serbs. He was voted 
into power three times. OK, the third 
time the elections were rigged, but they'd 
voted for him before that. But that said, 
they were tricked.T he rise of nationalism 
But let me ask a question. 
Why were the Western 
democracies so indifferent 
to the democratic movement 
in Serbia? 
in the former Yugoslavia wasn’t sponta- 
neous. We know who the main culprits 
were. Milosevic in Serbia, Franjo 
Tudjman in Croatia and Alija Izetbegovic 
in Bosnia and Herzegovina. They all 
played the nationalist card to entrench 
themselves in power. It’s a card that 
always works at troubled moments in 
history. 
Why didn’t anti-nationalist intellectuals in the 
former Yugoslavia react strongly enough to 
the rise of nationalism? 
Many of us did react, but we have very 
little room for manoeuvre. Our voice 
doesn’t carry very far. We don’t have any 
power and we had no money to reach a 
wide audience, either at home or abroad. 
But let me ask a few questions. Why 
were the Western democracies so indiffe- 
rent to the democratic movement in 
Serbia? Why did they make Milosevic “the 
guarantor of peace” by accepting him as a 
signatory of the Dayton accords in 
November 1995? When we took to the 
streets in 1997 after the municipal elec- 
tions, it was 10 days before French TV 
decided to show that something was hap - 
pening in Serbia. Yet these demonstra- 
tions went on for three months. If we'd 
had a bit of material aid at that time—no 
more than the price of a single Tomahawk 
missile—we could have set up indepen- 
dent media, and Serbs could have heard 
another version of events instead of just 
the government’s. 
You're regarded as a committed artist. What

do you mean by commitment? 
Politically, my commitment has lain in 
carefully avoiding joining any party or 
accepting a government job. I value my 
independence and my freedom. For me, 
being committed means having a dialecti- 
cal relationship with reality and never fin- 
ding oneself outside or above it. That’s the 
sense in which my films are committed. 
Guardian Angel denounces the dreadful 
reality of the trade in Gypsy children, The 
Dog who Loved Trains the plight of social 
outcasts and Someone Else's America 
exposes the situation of immigrants. 
Although I stress feelings in my films, rea- 
lity is their dominant theme. 
Which school of film-makers do you 
belong to? 
You're asking me to do the critics’ 
job! I don’t see myself shut away in a dra- 
wer, even one lined with velvet and silk. 
I'm claustrophobic. I tend to see myself as 
being on a vast plain inhabited by disad- 
vantaged people whose fate concerns me. 
That’s the backcloth. Form is of seconda- 
ry importance. I tailor it to the story I 
want to tell. That’s why all my films are 
different. The one consistent thread is 
their humanism. The cinema classics I 
feel closest to are those of the Italian neo- 
realist Vittorio de Sica. They are full of 
feeling but they say more about Italy than

any documentary. I also feel close to the 
works of the French director Jean Renoir, 
which are both poetic and realistic. 
I don’t like films that go off into wild 
fantasies. Dreams are important in our 
lives, but life isn’t just dreams. It’s reality 
that hurts. Dreams only interest me inso- 
far as they bandage wounds. 
I also don’t like films that take too 
pessimistic a view of life in order to serve 
a political cause however just it might be. 
Your films seem to be metaphors rather 
than messages. 
I usually send messages by e-mail. 
Has life got a message? No. The wonder- 
ful thing about life is that it’s a great 
mystery whose secrets we constantly have 
to discover. The beauty of film for me is its

closeness to life. And if it’s going to reflect 
life faithfully, it has to draw on metaphor, 
just like poetry. The Powder Keg is realistic 
but it’s a metaphor too. Nights in Belgrade 
aren't all like the one in the film. 
Have you been criticized for being 
pessimistic? 
Yes, several times. The public’s need 
to see films that end with a ray of hope 
comes from the theory of socialist realism 
that was dinned into us at school, at any 
rate into those of us who were brought up 
in eastern Europe. Communism collap- 
sed and socialist realism with it, but its 
golden rule of “be optimistic and believe 
in a radiant future” still lives on in the 
public’s mind. Oddly enough, it’s the 
American film industry that went furthest 
with socialist realism, by introducing the 
notions of hope and optimism as intrinsic 
parts of a film. From then on it was hard 
to convince the public that these were not 
the criteria by which a film should be jud- 
ged. 
I’ve been particularly criticized by 
some of my compatriots who live abroad 
and think the media has already gone 
quite far enough in “tarnishing the image 
of the Serb people” and that there was no 
need for me to contribute with The

image of the French people? 
As an artist from the Balkans, do you think 
Western audiences expect something special 
from you? 
I sometimes feel they expect me to 
have an answer for everything, in my 
films, in public debate, and in interviews 
with journalists. A French film-maker is 
questioned about aesthetics; I am asked 
what I think of NATO. People also expect 
my films to denounce this or that policy. 
But I repeat, politics isn’t my business. I 
shall be making my next film in Mexico 
and it will look at disease and death. 
Nothing to do with Serbia. But I always 
find I'm defending a given area—the 
Balkans—and defending my work within 
that area. People forget I'm just someone 
who thinks and who tries to express, 
through films, what he thinks. 
At the 1999 Venice film festival, Scandinavian 
critics said The Powder Keg was over the top 
and unrealistic. Did they think the film was 
too “Balkan”, not universal enough? 
The film did go to the limit as far as vio- 
lence was concerned and some of the situa- 
tions shown might be considered impro- 
bable. But there was less blood in it than in 
many Hollywood love stories. I wanted to 
show that no country holds a monopoly on 
violence and that any one of us, anywhere 
in the world, at any time, can be a prey to it. 
That human beings are not inherently evil 
but become destructive because theyre 
egged on by circumstances. It’s in this sense 
that my film is universal. 
If the Scandinavians did not feel it was 
their kind of film, it was perhaps because 
they felt that their structured and well- 
ordered society is impervious to violence. 
Latin American critics and journalists in 
Venice, on the other hand, reacted as if 
the film might have been made in their 
countries, and so did the Italians and to 
some extent the French. Later, the res- 
ponse of the American public confirmed 
for me that the film could have been made 
in the Bronx or Brooklyn. 
To criticize it for being unrealistic is 
like saying Van Gogh's skies are too blue. 
Art isn’t a carbon copy of nature. The 
extent to which a film is realistic is of 
secondary importance, because reality 
itself is relative. The important thing, as 
with all art, is that the film is authentic. 
Film is an art-form, but it's also an industry, 
isn’t it? 
Above all it’s an art, but an expensive 
art. This means a film-maker always has 
to think about profitability, a concept 
from the world of industry and commer- 
ce. For fear of not being able to keep on 
making films, directors often try to please 
a wide public which has been suckled 
from its earliest years at the breast of 
Hollywood, has acquired a taste for it and 
doesn’t want to be weaned.But I trust the 
wider public, all the same. I don’t think 
the public always wants to see the world 
through rose-coloured spectacles. The 
success of Will It Snow for Christmas? 
(1995), the first film by French director 
Sandrine Veysset, reassures me about this. 
I think it’s the distributors who’ve impo- 
sed this false idea of the uniformity of the 
public which allows them to always take 
the easiest path. 
But you've made a Hollywood-style film, 
Twilight Time. Later you said you'd lost your 
soul. Why was that? 
It’s not, strictly speaking, a Hollywood- 
type film. It was ordered by Hollywood and 
filmed in Yugoslavia.l gave in to the temp- 
tation of the huge amount of money I was 
offered. When you're young and used to 
working with very little money and you see 
the gleaming prospect of gold ingots before 
your eyes, you don’t have the strength to 
say no. You tell yourself that at last you're 
going to be able to fulfill all your dreams as 
a film-maker. But from the start of the fil- 
ming, | realized money was creating more 
problems than the lack of it and that it’s far 
from being a guarantee of artistic freedom. 
It was a lesson to me. I lost my soul because 
I had to make too many compromises. 
Do you think there's such a thing 
as a “Balkan soul”? If so, how would 
you describe it? 
It does exist, but it’s impossible to 
define. Just when you think you've got it 
in your grasp, it slips away from you. But 
that’s what makes it “Balkan”and why it’s 
so splendid. It’s dishevelled and smiling, 
emotional and vulnerable. It likes to day- 
dream, it has a sense of humour and self- 
mockery. It isn’t pragmatic, it’s rather 
fatalistic, it believes in myths and it’s 
stubborn, very stubborn—to the point of 
self-destruction. |
