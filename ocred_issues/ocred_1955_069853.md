fA HE UNESCO COURIER is pleased to announce that the number of paid sub- 
scriptions has now passed the 50,000 mark. 
This was the first goal set early this year when the Editors agreed to spare no 
effort to bring readers a better, more interesting magazine with each succeeding 
issue. New features have been added, the number of pages has heen increased, a 
high quality white paper has been adopted, and both the contents and general 
appearance have been appreciably improved. 
Today, the UNEsco courIEr has the highest paid circulation of any periodical 
published by the United Nations or any of its affiliated international agencies. 
On this occasion, the Editors wish to express their appreciation to all readers 
throughout the world for their continued, enthusiastic support, for their many letters 
of praise and encouragement, and particularly for their magnificent response in 
renewing subscriptions before the new increased rates go into effect on January 1, 
1956. (One reader submitted a renewal for six years. The Editors regret that sub- 
scriptions cannot be accepted for more than three years at the present rates.) 
Several years ago, Mexico launched a great and successful campaign against 
illiteracy with the slogan “Each One Teach One”. The Editors have adopted a simi- 
lar phrase for a new campaign which has as its goal 100,000 subscribers. The phrase 
is : “Each One Reach One.” 
With this issue of the UNESCO coURIER, the Editors invite every subscriber to take 
advantage of the current annual subscription rate of 300 French francs, 6/-, $1.50 
by sending in a minimum of one gift subscription for a friend or relative. Many 
subscribers have already led the way by accompanying their renewals with four 
or five gitt subscriptions. 
As of January 1, 1956 thie new annual rate will be 400 French francs ; 8/- or 
$2.00. Gift subscriptions and rencwals will be accepted at tlie current rate of 
300 French francs; 6/- or $1.50 if postmarked not later than December 31, 1955. The

“Woman power" is today an increasingly vital 
factor in the economic life of most countries 
as millions more women take up jobs in 
industry and commerce. Conditions in modern 
factories are vastly different from those under 
which women worked even half a century 
ago. Shorter hours and health and safety 
regulations are now imposed by law. This

given the name ffomo Sapiens. Women make up 
half of humanity and in many countries outnumber 
the men. Yet for centuries they have been treated 
as inferior beings. They have been hewers of wood and 
drawers of waler; they have worked harder for a smaller 
material reward and enjoyed a humbler status in the 
eyes of society. They have received less education, 
have had less protection before the law, and have been 
denied even the most elementary civic rights. 
I T is no mere accident that the human race has been 
Some women, it is of course true, have had more noble, 
more important roles. Down through the ages there 
have been queens and women rulers. But almost always 
the story has been the same : either virtual serfdom or 
royal status. The notion of equality, of women recog- 
nized as citizens on an equal footing with men is a 
totally new concept which rightfully belongs to our pre- 
sent century. 
It is a long step from the Roman woman held in per- 
petual tutelage to England’s Mary Wollstonecraft and her 
“Vindication of the Rights of Women” published at the 
close of the 18th century. It is perhaps a longer step 
from the woman in her home among her children to the 
woman cxecutive or the woman delegate at an interna- 
tional congress, acling on an equal basis with her male 
colleagues. Countless women have laken this last step 
in the past 50 years and many more will certainly take 
it in the years ahead. 
The equal status of wortnen is now recognized hy a 
large number of countries. Women's rights are affirm- 
ed in the Charter of the United Nations and were pro- 
claimed for the entire world in the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights, adopted seven years ago, on Decem- 
ber 10. 1948 : “Free and equal in dignily and rights... ” 
“without distinction of any kind such as race, colour, 
sex...” 
In its Constitution, UNksco’s purpose is defined as 
promoting collaboration among nations through educa- 
tion science and culture “in order to further universal 
respect for justice, for the rule of law and for the human 
rights and fundamental freedoms... without distinction 
of race, sex, language or religion.” To realize this pur- 
pose, the Constitution adds, UNEsco will “give fresh im- 
pulse to popular education and to the spread of cul- 
ture... by instituting collaboration among the nations to 
advance the ideal of equality of educational opportunity 
without regard to race, sex or any distinctions, cconomic 
or social...” 
On the occasion of Human Rights Day 1955, the 
Unesco CouRiER devotes this issue to a report on the pro- 
gress made by women in recent years in their struggle 
for equality with men.

WOMEN 
ON THE 
by 
Alva Myrdal 
asked me to compare Japanese women with those of 
my own country—Sweden. I remember answering 
that the main difference was that the women of Japan 
were advancing at a much more rapid pace. So rapid in 
fact that it was hard to foresee how the new Japanese 
Woman would ultimately shape her own future. 
Japan has been telescoping into the short space of a few 
years changes that have been going on in the West for 
a century or more. Before 1945 Japanese women had no 
civil rights. They could not vote or own property ; their 
husbands were often chosen for them by others, and they 
could not seek divorce whatever the circumstances, Tra- 
ditionally their role was one of complete inferiority to men.

‘A DOG, A WOMAN, A WALNUT TREE, the more you beat them the better they be, ran 
the old adage which men supported with laws establishing the inequality of the sexes. After a long 
struggle, women in many lands have won the right to equality in all fields of human endeavour. 
MARCH 
Mrs. ALVA MYRDAL, recently ap- 
pointed Swedish Minister to India, 
Burma and Ceylon, is a leading authority 
on women's rights. Born in Uppsala, 
she founded, and for twelve years direct- 
ed, the Swedish Training College for 
Pre-School Teachers, She joined the 
Secretariat of the United Nations in 
1949 as Principal Director of the 
Department of Social Affairs. For the 
past four years Mrs. Myrdal has been 
Director of the Department of Social 
Sciences in Unesco. Mrs Myrdal is the 
author of several important sociological 
works. Her most recent book, ** Wo- 
men’s Two Lives”, written with Viola 
Klein, will be published next year,  
UNESCO     
By 1950 some 15 million women had registered at the 
polls. In January 1953 Japanese women’s organizations 
totalled almost seven million members. And today many 
women are entering new careers in industry, commerce, the 
government and diplomatic service and the liberal profes- 
sions. 
Ours is an age of rapid, drastic’ changes. Almost no- 
where can we still find the calm and tranquility of the past 
when life continued unmodified for generation after genera- 
tion. Everywhere today there is stirring and movement, if 
not unrest. Even in those countries where women seem, 
outwardly at least, to be an immobile, voiceless mass, the 
influences working upon them and the images entering 
their minds are new and different. And these must be 
having some effect and must be causing 
some stir or agitation. 
But is this ferment of new ideas a 
creative, positive thing, or is it no more 
than a form of restlessness? Is it being 
organized and directed into some kind of 
pattern which we can recognize as pro- 
gress? Or is it just leading to disorgani- 
zation—disintegrating the ‘world of 
women without giving them a better life 
in return? 
Whatever our opinion may be about 
what is occurring today, one thing seems 
clear to me: It is impossible for any so- 
ciety today to call itself advanced or to 
embark on the road to technological 
advancement and at the same time con- 
tinue to maintain women in their old 
inferior roles. 
That a tremendous change is taking 
place in the role of women all over the 
world would hardly seem like big news 
to a Westerner. Apart from interna- 
tionally-known figures like Mrs. Eleanor 
Roosevelt, Mrs. Pandit and some famous 
writers and scientists, the modern type 
of woman is taken pretty much for grant- 
ed in the West. Since the early “eman- 
cipation” period of the 1900's when the 
“blue stocking” was greeted with a smirk

or a lifted eyebrow, the West has travelled a long way. Today 
the successful career woman, the top executivk, the woman 
Member of Parliament, the ‘woman lawyer, doctor or scientist 
is no longer a novelty. She is accepted in a matter-of-fact 
way and treated like any other colleague. 
To me this fact is so important that I would put it at the 
top of the list of major contemporary achievements in what 
we commonly call the Western world. But it also applies to 
countries in Eastern Europe, and to a lesser extent, to others 
in Asia such as India where the Minister of Health, Rajku- 
mari Amrit Kaur, for example, is judged not as a woman but 
on the quality of her work as an official. 
Although women have practically achieved equal rights 
with men in the advanced countries, there are still quite a 
number of “buts” and “ifs” to be taken into account. Ne- 
vertheless there can be little doubt that 
the inequalities that still persist, parti- 
cularly those affecting women’s civic and 
economic rights, will be largely eliminat- 
ed in time. 
It will take much longer though to 
change public opinion. People cling to 
old ideas even after these have ceased to 
correspond to the facts for many years. 
This explains why public opinion polls on 
women, including the replies given by 
women themselves, are so disheartening. 
Thoughtless repetitions of old, time~worn 
opinions (“A woman’s place is in the 
home!” “A woman shouldn’t continue to 
work after having children”) figure pro- 
minently beside the more considered 
views of those who check their “opinions” 
with another compartment in their brain 
which has accepted women’s role in 
employment as well as in the home. 
Dangerous old idea 
it perpetuates the idea that mother- 
hood and full partnership in eco- 
nomic and civic life are completely 
irreconcilable when the facts prove they 
T HIS is particularly dangerous in that 
are not. The present lifespan of women 
in the industrialized countries now . ; 
averages more than 70 years. This garden with the children. 
means that a girl who marries between 
20 and 25 can look forward to some 
50 more years of life. This leaves her 
time both for a period of motherhood 
(usually though not necessarily some- 
what shorter now than in grandmother’s 
time since she has fewer children), and 
for a period of employment and com- 
munity activity (no shorter than for men 
and unmarried women in grandfather’s 
time). 
But let us glance at other parts of the 
world. The problems and the prospects 
are not the same, but the signs of pro- 
gress are just as marked. From my 
personal observations abroad on behalf 
of Unesco and from the studies which 
Unesco itself has instigated, I have ga- 
thered deep impressions of the rapid 
progress being made in respect of 
women’s rights in countries where mo- 
dernization and industrialization are in 
full swing. Japan, which I have already 
mentioned, Pakistan and the Arab 
World are cases in point. 
While in these countries neither the 
prolongation of life nor the general level 
of education have as yet brought all women to a new 
phase of development, a new type of woman is visibly 
and forcibly emerging. Relatively small in number, groups 
of these women today form a nucleus of female 
leadership. They have already enjoyed secondary schooling 
and many even a university education. They are now receiv- 
ing training for participation in community and other civic 
activities on a volunteer basis. Although this, of course, has 
definite shortcomings in comparison with work in officially 
recognized positions, it has given women more of an 
opportunity than most men have to learn businesslike me- 
thods and efficiency in organization. Their reliability and 
honesty will make them definite political assets to their coun- 
tries, once they become fully accepted.

Although their present rate of progress‘is as spectacular as 
that of their sisters in the more developed countries, their 
problems are not the same. They still have to be fully in- 
tegrated into their national society. However, they scem to 
have been able to find a key to the combination of mo- 
therhood and a socially active life. It is a remarkable fact 
indeed that most of these women leaders are married and 
mothers of children, unlike the leaders of the “suffragette” 
movements earlier in the century in western Europe. 
Their principal problem is the need to share their own ad- 
vances with other women in the poorer strata of society, who 
outnumber them enormously. This problem was examined 
this year in the Lebanon at a conference of 40 women leaders 
from five Arab countries. 
Their most immediate practical concern was how to reach

Another problem, ‘which is as yet perhaps not sufficiently 
sensed by women in countries where economic development is 
going forward with rapid strides, is the need to avoid making 
the transition from old to new in such a precipitate way that 
national cultural characteristics and values are lost. It is 
not merely sufficient to borrow a number of new patterns 
from countries which have already “arrived.”

NEW LEADERS OF CEYLON'S 
VILLAGE LIFE 
Eighty-five percent of Ceylon’s population lives in rural areas and among 
these village dwellers the welfare of the community depends largely on its 
womenfolk. One of the Government's chief resources in helping rural 
women to work for their own educational, economic and cultural progress 
is the Lanka Mahila Samiti {Ceylon Women's Institutes) movement founded 
25 years ago. Work by these institutes covers health, general education, 
rural development and industries. Training women for village leadership 
in these fields is given at a central school at Kaduwela, near Colombo. 
Left and centre, women trainees practise home garden cultivation with

basic feature of its work and the one which has been marked 
with the most forthright success has been its campaign to

mative reports which present the real situation today on a 
married woman’s right to her own nationality, on the right 
gain universal recognition of women’s right to vote and enjoy 
political rights on an equal footing with men. In December 
1952, an International Convention on the Political Rights of 
Women was opened for signature (40 countries have now sign- 
ed); the Convention entered into force in July 1954, 22 count- 
ries now having ratified it. 
The U.N. is continuing its 'work on a two-fold plan: firstly, , 
through a painstaking survey of present legal provisions in = . 
order to draw attention to the many flaws and loopholes in 
the protection of women’s rights. Secondly, through a 
progress report made public each year with the backing of 
the General Assembly to act as a kind of public opinion 
“pressure group” on recalcitrant states.

The International Labour Organization (ILO) has dealt with 
the problems of equal pay for equal work, working conditions 
for women and opportunities for vocational education. 
As for Unesco itself, it has devoted its efforts to trying to 
improve the status of women by drawing attention to the 
progress or lack of progress achieved in woman’s access to 
education, and by undertaking special investigations into the 
complex factors which either hinder or favour woman's 
progress.

tional Bureau of Education in Geneva, Unesco has investi- 
gated the educational opportunities of women in three widely 
differing countries, Chile, India, and Yugoslavia (published 
as “Women and Education”). 
Of considerable importance are the series of investigations 
now being made into the deep-seated social taboos which 
work against a more speedy acceptance of the true equality 
of women and hence against the full utilization of “woman 
power” by particular countries. Unesco has helped to orga- 
nize comparative studies on such matters as the trials and 
tribulations of women’s participation in the political life of 
Europe (see page 21); of the inherent traditional obstacles 
to woman’s access to education in Japan, Mexico, and Pakis- 
tan; of the active part played by women in local communities 
in Southern Asia. 
Many of these studies have as yet not been published, but 
all of them contain challenging and often entertaining in- 
formation. As Professor Maurice Duverger, author of 
UnNESco’s “The Political Role of Women” which has just been 
published writes: “There is no more an inferior sex than 
there are inferior races or inferior classes. But there is a

Union. About 77,000 are doing scien- 
tific work. There are more than a 
million women teachers in primary 
and secondary schools. Women tech- 
nicians and engineers number more 
than half a million, Women play an 
important role in politics: 348 are

sex, and there are classes and races ‘who have come to believe 
in their inferiority because they have been persuaded of it in 
justification of their subordinate position in society.” 
The close relation between economic change and women’s 
“emancipation” (which has been the main theme of this 
article) makes it quite important to discover women’s role in 
the very earliest stages of economic development. Astonish- 
ingly little knowledge exists on this subject; and it would 
almost seem as if previous economic studies of industrializ- 
ation had had a blind spot as far as women were concerned. 
Unesco has, therefore, just begun an extensive field study on 
the emergence of the first leaders among women in West 
Africa. This may help to throw light on some of the para- 
mount problems,

of social change? Do they, like the old people, remain 
in the safety and security of the village when their 
adventurous menfolk go elsewhere to seek new employment? 
Is it the women who refuse to give up the old and proven 
ways of housekeeping, agriculture and medicine rather than 
accept improvements? Are they the ones who cultivate 
superstitions and fear the light of fact and reason? 
To a certain extent women have come to represent the 
status quo, and to act as deterrents to change because they

Lost homes and lost husbands

Let us take the story of Jinja in the Uganda. Here, the 
installation of a giant electric power station at Owen Falls 
on the Nile sparked a process of extremely rapid industriali- 
zation. Elements of the time-worn methods of agriculture 
were cleared from the town and a seething new life began to 
stir. There was plenty of work, but for every seven men 
employed there was only one woman. For these men work 
meant abandoning their home life for barrack-like construc- 
tions with western-type collective services and sanitation.

Revolt against male authority 
RS. RHoNA SOFER, in her report on this question to the 
UnEsco-sponsored symposium at the World Population 
Conference in Rome last year described households in 
Bukesa—the most urbanized centre, as having no adult 
females and only 4% with children—one child each. “The 
 
urban wife,” she added, “finds herself without the functions 
that gave her status in the traditional system”, and is unable 
to guide her children into the new mode of living. Most 
Africans in Jinja today find that their early indoctrination 
and social training have not equipped them to deal with the’ 
pattern of living with which they are now confronted. 
So, the result of economic advancement is an urban life in 
a collectively-organized male society where the men are or 
consider themselves bachelors, while the women are either 
left behind or are in revolt against the traditions of paterna- 
lism. Once they come to town, women strongly resist their 
husbands’ desire to make them subordinate with the result 
that, as Rhona Sofer reports, “the area has many disaffected 
women who have left their husbands”. Thus, backwardness 
and disorganization appear to be the only alternatives open’ 
to women in this particular transition period. 
At the same conference, however, a very different story 
was told by Mrs. Yonina Talmon-Garber about Israeli 
collective farm communities. There it is quite frequent that 
women—even women from African territories--return from 
work to their homes and their children with new techniques 
and ideas because they are given independent jobs. Similar 
experiences to those recorded in Israel have been reported 
by anthropologists and sociologists about specific situations 
in Africa where care has been taken to provide women with 
meaningful tasks and varied social contacts. 
Evidence from social scientists, although only sporadic as

yet, does indicate therefore that ‘women could fill the role of 
true innovators and agents for introducing change. They 
have the opportunity of bringing new ways of doing things, 
with which go new lines of thought, directly to the place 
where it is of most importance—the home. Here, where the 
influence extends throughout all members of the household 
the mother is strategically placed for inducing social changes. 
Unesco has, hitherto, in its work for fundamental educa- 
tion, and in more formal schooling work, proceeded on the 
hypothesis of “no distinction between the sexes”. Per se 
this a laudable objective. But the social scientists are now 
wondering whether it might not pay to blueprint a new kind 
of development programme, with greater effect and advantage 
to all, which would be channelled much more directly through 
‘women, 
It would mean equating new reforms to the actual pattern 
of day-to-day life, to the demands of consumption, to 
people’s needs, and then letting it grow from these funda- 
mental factors until it encompasses the entire economic life. 
The transformation of the social economy would then come 
about as a result of changes in the household economy, and 
not, as nearly always is the case, by increasing productivity 
and leaving the lives of human beings to adapt as best they 
can. 
Of course, women are adaptable and will adjust themselves 
according to de- 
mands, They can 
ensure that the 
introduction from 
outside the home 
of new conditions 
and a new way 
of life does not 
cause too much 
harm to the in- 
dividual human 
beings. But there 
are many signs 
now that they 
would wish to 
give form and 
substance them- 
selves to new 
ways of life, and 
not merely play a 
passive role; they 
would rather be 
partners in the 
great process 
‘which is now re- 
shaping human 
society; they are 
ready to march 
forward and en- 
sure that pro- 
gress is really 
progress and not 
simply change.   
It is questions 
such as these 
which will one 
day find a place on the agendas of meetings of the U.N. and 
the Specialized Agencies. To take some examples : How 
can technical assistance be utilized so as to bring women's 
as yet largely dormant capacities into play for raising the 
people’s living standards? How can fundamental education 
programmes be initiated so that the “multiplier effect” of 
women as educational agents can be mobilized, and used as 
the main proponents in order to reach into those parts of 
cultural life as yet untouched by formal schools? 
They want full partnership 
HEN this day comes it will be understood throughout 
the world, as it does not appear to be fully under- 
stood yet, that the acknowledgment of women’s claim 
to Human Rights is not just a question of giving benefits to 
women, although these do mean much more symbolically to 
women as they can thus feel the emotional security of having 
their full worth as human beings recognized. 
It is not only a question of making a reality of those egali- 
tarian principles, which all democracies must honour if they 
are to justify the title of democracy. The real issue is some- 
thing much more fundamental: the participation of women 
as full partners in the economic, social and cultural life of a 
nation. When this is achieved, and women can play their 
role to the full, the results in terms of well-being for the 
peoples of the world will be immense.

From The Four Corners 
GROWING LABOUR FORCE : 
In the U.S.A. there are now over a million more 
women than men in the age group from 20 to 75 
and over (with the exception of the 55 to 59). 
Women also have lower mortality rates and their life 
expectancy is longer. 
American women today are marrying younger, 
having their children earlier, and bearing more se- 
cond, third and fourth children than in the 1920's. 
Approximately one out of every three women in 
the U.S.A. is employed outside her home. The total 
figure runs to about 20 million. Some 50% of 
these are married, and this figure marks an advance 
of 20% since 1940. 
RULERS OF THE ROOST: 
Among the Tchambuli tribes of New Guinea the 
women completely dominate the men. They go 
off to work each day and leave their menfolk at 
home to play the flute, decorate themselves with 
flowers and plan some amusement to entertain the 
women when they return tired and hungry after a 
day's work making nets and catching fish. The 
Tchambuli women are affectionately scornful of 
their men, whom they regard as rather frivolous, 
emotional creatures, given to quarrelling and endless 
chatter. 
WOMEN ARMY DOCTORS: 
Women doctors are now joining the Pakistan 
Army Medical Corps as regular commissioned offi- 
cers, Pakistani women have also shown a keen 
interest in civil defence, and have volunteered in 
large numbers for basic general training. Centres 
have been set up in Karachi for training women. 
FIRST TRIBAL DEPUTY 
In a white flower-embroidered tunic, with gold 
earings and necklaces worked like lace by tribal 
craftsmen, Aurora Montiel, addresses the Venezue- 
lan National Assembly in her tribal language. Re- 
presenting her tribe, the Uranis, she is the first 
Indian woman to sit as a Deputy. 
JILLS OF ALL TRADES : 
What jobs do European woman do? If we take 
France, as an example, we find the following statis- 
tics: there are more than 800 taxi drivers, 18 train 
drivers, 4 000 pharmacists, 860 lawyers, 12 surgeons, 
300 policewomen, 7 airport controllers, 320 drivers of 
heavy goods vehicles and 2 400 doctors. 
MODERN BREADWINNERS 
In more than four million U.S. families, or one 
out of every ten, a woman carries the main respon- 
sibility both for financial support and for family 
planning. 
In 1910 12,2 % of the total number of women em- 
ployed in the U.S.A. were engaged on newspaper and 
magazine work. Today this figure has nearly tri- 
pled (32 9%). This is by far the highest percentage 
gain for any of the professions.

### 69440: Are women the inferior sex? No, declares a scientist, women are superior to men

ARE WOMEN THE INFERIOR SEX? 
No, declares a scientist, 
Women are superior fo men 
  
by Ashley Montagu . 
HAVE spent a great part of my scientific and public life 
I pringing the facts of science to attest to the fact that no 
people is in any significant way naturally superior fo 
another, and that such superiorities as any human group 
exhibits as compared with another are acquired, and are 
usually due to purely accidentally determined historical 
causes. And yet, today, I have become identified with the 
viewpoint, which I put forward as a scientific fact that one 
group of humanity is naturally superior to the other, namely, 
that women are naturally superior to men—the very opposite 
of the view to which practically the whole of humanity has 
subscribed, possibly from its very beginnings! 
It has been obvious to practically everyone that by and 
large men are in every way superior to women. Men are 
stronger, more intelligent, less emotional, less flighty, 
more creative, even the best cooks are men, and the most 
successful designers of women’s clothes are frequently men. 
Has it not been the continuous experience of humanity that 
men are superior to women? How is it possible even to ques- 
tion so age-old and time-honoured a fact? 
As a scientist specializing in human naturesI know very 
well that what human beings often accept as d\fact may be 
no more than a belief which has become so encrusted with 
the moss of Time that neither its origin nor its true nature 
is understood. The belief is a fact because everyone regards 
it as so. As a scientist I am interested in discovering the 
processes by which such a belief came to be accepted as a 
fact, and to demonstrate whether the belief is true or false. 
How the whole myth started 
I T is not difficult to understand how the belief in masculine 
superiority came into being, but before we consider that, - 
let me say what the scientist understands by “natural”, 
and by “superiority”. By “natural” is to be understood what- 
ever is innate in one’s’ biological constitution. By “supe- 
riority” is to be understood the state of being adaptively 
better or more efficient in some trait or quality than the 
organism with which one is making the comparison. 
Now, how did it come to be believed, and how is it that it 
is so universally believed at the present time, that men are 
naturally superior to women? The ahswer is simple: Men 
are muscularly more powerful than women, women have 
babies, women have to lead more sedentary lives than men, 
because under primitive conditions, it is she who has to stay 
at home and look after the young, while her hushand travels 
over the face of the land hunting for game. 
This division of labour exists in all societies and exercises a 
powerful influence upon the socio-psychological development 
of the sexes. 'The woman becomes parochial, the male 
urbane. The woman's experience being largely limited to her 
domestic functions she becomes a domesticated creature, 
whereas her husband, as the hunter, learns a great deal 
about the world in which he lives, he improves upon techni- 
ques of hunting, he devises new implements, he learns of 
innumerable plants and animals, he enjoys large varieties of 
experience which never fall to the lot of his wife—in compari- 
son to her he knows and can do more about the world in 
which they live than she will ever know or do—not because 
she is incapable of knowing and doing the same things (or 
nearly so, for it is obvious that not being as muscularly 
powerful as he is she will be unable to lift heavy animals or 
Professor Ashley MONTAGU, of the United States has won especial note for his 
work in race relations and he was a member of the two committees composed of 
internationally-known scientists who drafted the Unesco statement on race based on 
the most up-to-date scientific data. Professor Montagu’s books include "On Being 
Human’, “Man's Most Dangerous Myth: The Fallacy of Race”, “An [ntroduction to 
Physical Anthropology’ and ‘The Natural Superiority of Women”, 
12 
run as fast), but because she will not enjoy the necessary 
opportunities to show what she can learn and do. 
To the domesticated female the prowess of her male and 
his superior knowledge and skill all bear testimony to the 
accepted belief that men are naturally superior to women. 
Once this belief is accepted and societies become more 
complexly organized the male becomes more complexly 
integrated into his position as the naturally superior 
creature, and everyone learns to accept the inferiority 
of the female as an established law of nature. But how 
often have the laws of nature turned out to be nothing more 
than the private and public prejudices of men! 
Anyone can check the facts 
HE scientific fact is—and a scientific fact is one that can 
be verified by anyone who wishes to take the trouble to 
do so—the scientific fact is that women are naturally 
superior to men, and I would add that we should all be 
grateful that this is the fact, for in this fact lies the hope of 
e world. 
The most valuable trait that human beings can possess is 
adaptability. This is the trait which enables human beings 
to get along with their fellow human beings in such a way as 
to contribute in a creative manner to the enlargement of 
their potentialities for being warm, loving, co-operative 
persons. Nature has endowed the female most abundantly 
with all those potentialities ‘which contribute to the develop- 
ment of this trait, and she has done so because it is the 
female who must gestate the young, who must give birth to 
and succour and nourish the young. 
Unless the female is biologically endowed with this kind of 
altruism the species would stand very little chance of sur- 
vival—unless the male were so endowed, but he is not, The 
male has to learn how to love; the female is biologically, by 
nature, equipped to do so. Because she is the biologically 
more valuable part of the species capital she has been 
equipped by nature with the necessary superiorities which are 
calculated to ensure the survival of the species. And this is 
where we come to the proof of the natural superiority of the 
female. : 
Beginning life as a double-X 
HE most important of the biological differences between 
the sexes are those ‘which determine the sexual differen- 
ces. These are the sex chromosomes. The sex chromo- 
somes are known as the X-and Y-chromosomes. X-and 
Y-chromosomes are carried in the heads of the male sperma- 
tozoa. Whether the child is to be a male or a female depends 
entirely upon whether it is a Y-or an X-chromosome which 
fertilizes the maternal ovum. The female ova carry only 
X-chromosomes. When a sperm carrying an X-chromosome 
fertilizes an ovum, the resulting fertilized egg is XX, one X 
from the male sperm and one X from the female ovum. Such 
an XX egg always gives rise to a female. When a sperm 
carrying a Y-chromosome fertilizes an ovum, the resulting 
fertilized egg is XY, an X-chromosome from the ovum and a 
Y-chromosome from the male sperm. Such an XY egg 
always gives rise to a male. 
The Y-chromosome is an incomplete chromosome, it is 
much smaller than the X-chromosome and lacks many of its 
properties—and it is to these deficiencies that almost all of 
the male’s troubles and inferiorities as compared (Contd on 
with the well-endowed double-X female can be 
traced. page 38)

Nearly half the 103,070 students enrolled in 
the universities and other institutes of higher 
learning of the German Federal Republic during 
the past university year were obliged to do 
some part-time work to help pay for their stu- 
dies. Nearly 46,000 out of 86,000 men stu-

### 69441: A Long road from the plough

A LONG ROAD FROM THE PLOUGH 
by Elina Almasy 
HE scene is a poverty-stricken landscape somewhere in 
the Carinthian mountains. In a barren-looking fleld 
six women are at work. Summer is ending and the 
time has come for ploughing. Three ploughs are turning 
over the heavy soil and yoked to each is an ox and a woman. * 
This scene, pictured in an engraving dated 1872, gives some 
idea of the lot of a European peasant woman a little over 86 
years ago. It seems hardly believable and one’s first reaction 
is to wonder how men could have been such tyrants. But the 
fault did not lie so much with the men as with the social and 
economic conditions of the period. The peasant in 1872 had 
in all probability no alternative but to yoke his wife alongside 
his ox, as he himself was probably labouring for his master. 
Communities still exist where women do the hard manual 
labour while the men busy themselves with housework. 
Strangely enough this is usually found amongst peoples who 
give their womenfolk a leading role in the social hierarchy, in 
the same way as in tribes where men are the leaders, there 
has always been the tendency to treat domestic work with 
contempt. The same idea was found in matriarchal commu- 
nities where the women banished men to the kitchen. 
In families living off the land it was not, in general, so 
much the tyranny of man ‘which turned women into some- 
thing not much better than a beast of burden, but the gene- 
ral poverty. However, with technical progress and the intro- 
duction of rational agricultural methods, the life of the pea- 
sant women was greatly improved in practically all countries 
of the world, and in general, independently of women’s eman- 
cipation in the legal and political fields. This favourable 
evolution is still going on. 
During the past century when women began to seek ad- 
vantages from the social revolution and the new economic 
opportunities opened up by increasing industrialization, the 
problem of women’s education immediately came to the fore. 
This led to a struggle in which women demanded the right 
of equal educational opportunities. In many countries it be- 
came a bitter struggle. To protect themselves from female 
competition men resorted to some insidious methods. Pub- 
lic demand led to women being allowed to follow certain 
trades and professions, but at the same time they were denied 
the training to fit them for these callings. They were told, 
for example, that the schools were full up. 
Medical schools open door first 
HE whole question of ‘women’s education is still far from 
settled today. Throughout the world there are still 
more female {lliterates than male. In Russia the illi- 
teracy figure for women is three times that of the figure for 
men. This year in the primary schools of India there are 
16 million boys but scarcely 5 million girls. In Indonesia 
such a shortage of schools exists that all secondary schools 
have been closed to girls. 
In the universities, the medical schools were usually the 
first to admit women students. The U.S.A. had its first 
woman doctor, Elizabeth Blackwell, in 1849. The University 
of Cambridge opened its doors to women students in 1869 and 
in 1870 women were given the right to study medicine at the 
University of Paris. However, the other faculties at Paris 
were slower to follow the example and in 1900 there was not 
a single woman student studying law. Today, 25 % of all law 
students in France are women. 
Although much progress has been made some professions 
are still closed to women. In the U.S.A. and Great Britain, 
they are not allowed to work in the mines or in forestry. 
France and Great Britain do not allow women to own 
money changing offices or stockbrokers businesses. In Paris 
Elina ALMASY, Norwegian sociologist was formerly head of research at the Oslo 
Institute of Social Rezecrch. Articles on this page ond page 28 are token from a 
study she completed lost year, on women’s progress in the world today. 
women were not allowed on the floor of the Stock Exchange 
until 1952. The Scottish Presbyterian Church allows women 
to become preachers but its English counterpart does not. 
The increasing share which women have obtained in 
general economic affairs has led to significant changes in 
day-to-day family life. In some countries women form a 
large percentage of the total population at work in industry, 
agriculture and commerce. Yugoslavia holds the record with 
49%, followed by Rumania with 46%. France occupies 
seventh place with 38%. In terms of the percentage of 
women workers from the total female population Yugoslavia 
again holds the world record with 57%. 
At the other end of the scale, women in the Latin Ameri- 
can countries play only a very small part in the professions, 
trade and industry. Out of 100 Mexican women only five are 
employed. In Cuba the percentage scarcely reaches seven, 
and In Honduras 7.5% However, in Colombia, by contrast, 
471% of the women are doing active work. 
Husband can veto bank account 
F all branches of industry, textiles employ the highest 
proportion of women workers. In the U.S.A, the figure 
is 71% and in Switzerland 65%. The Government of 
the U.S.S.R. has taken many measures to increase the role of 
women in the economic life of the nation. It has also en- 
couraged women to take up scientific ‘work. No fewer than 
0718 women have been awarded the Stalin Prize, among them 
the eminent biologist Olga Lapechinskaja. From the millions 
of factory workers 2,000 have been made “Heroines of Soviet 
Labour”, a title which carries a number of social privileges. 
The legitimate claim for equal pay for equal work has now 
been met in some countries, but many countries still do not 
adhere to the international convention on this tuestion. 
It is interesting to compare the respective incomes earned 
by men and women in the U.S.A. Among women, 48% earn 
less than $1,000 a year; 36% earn between $1,000 and $2,000; 
13% from $2,000 to $3,000, and only 3% have a salary of more 
than $3,000. For the men 26% fall in the $3,000 plus 
category; 29% earn between $2,000 and $3,000; 25% between 
$1,000 and $2,000, and only 20% earn less than $1,000. 
In France there are almost as many women heads of 
businesses as there are men. However, a married woman in 
France does not have the right to open a personal banking 
account without the written consent of her husband, except 
when a contract has been signed before marriage establishing 
a division of property. As regards the management of 
finances, women are still, as they were at the start of the 
century, under the control of men in most countries. 
Actually most governments today have not only given 
working women equal rights—equivalent salaries, possibilities 
of promotion, etc.—with men, but they have taken special 
measures to ensure that women will not suffer any physical 
harm from their work. In France, for example, women are 
not obliged to work at night, and working hours are arranged 
so that women can have 11 consecutive hours of rest during 
the 24. In the U.S.A. women cannot be made to work 
overtime, nor are they allowed to drive lorries of more than 
five tons in weight. - 
In most countries there are regulations obliging employers 
to provide chairs for women workers so that they can rest 
during the fixed breaks in the working day. There is an 
international convention which has laid down rules regarding 
the treatment of women workers who are expecting children. 
They have the right to a special holiday, receive free medical 
care and to be paid a salary wage bonus. After the birth of 
her child, when the women worker resumes her duties, her 
working hours must be arranged so that she can feed and 
attend to her child in the best possible conditions. 
A long road has indeed travelled since the days when 
peasant women helped oxen to pull a plough.

### 69854: The Unforgettable 'white cap' day

CAP AND GOWN (cont'd) 
THE UNFORGETTABLE 
‘WHITE CAP’ DAY 
One of the most important days in the life of 
Swedish girl students is “White Cap” Day. It 
is on this day that they will know whether, as a 
result of their examinations, they are to be 
“capped” or not. For weeks the young students 
have undergone searching written and oral 
examinations. And” in Sweden not only have 
the students to pass the examinations, but they 
are also marked for points on their school 
records. The universities demand a minimum 
number of points before they will admit candi- 
dates. In fact the Koralinum, the most impor- 
tant medical faculty in Sweden, demands such a 
high percentage that only the most outstanding 
are accepted. 
    
But at last the long weeks of work are over, and 
now the great question is “Who will be capped 1” 
The answer will only be known on the Day of 
the White Cap. Around four o'clock in the 
afternoon parents, brothers, sisters and friends 
gather in the school quadrangle to congratulate 
the young college students. This first success is 
celebrated in holiday mood. The groups of 
well-wishers have brought flowers, presents and 
balloons. They arrive in cars, hand-carts, 
donkey-carts, and with them come the musi- 
cians who enliven things with popular songs. 
As the hands of the clock near five, tension 
mounts. Spies report supposed successes and 
failures. Finally the doors are opened and the 
girls appear in a long file. They sing, and call 
out and wave to their parents and friends in 
the crowd. As the song finishes the girls rush 
headlong to greet their parents and tell them 
the news. But they are immediately surrounded 
by their colleagues who hoist them on their 
shoulders and place the white caps on their 
heads. Their parents embrace them, garland 
them with flowers and give them balloons. 
Accompanied by music from improvised bands 
the girls are escorted to their cars, carriages and 
carts, and the groups set out for their homes, 
Once there they will sing and dance until late 
into the night. This day of the white cap is one 
never to be forgotten.

SWEDEN'S SCHOOLS FOR 
GRAGE AND BEAUTY 
Sweden is known the world over for its gymnasts, 
and it is from the | 9th century “Swedish drill” 
that most modern systems of physical education 
have been developed. For Swedish girls physi- 
cal education is an important part of their 
general schooling. They learn how to walk 
gracefully, how to keep their bodies supple and 
how to give every movement of the body grace 
and beauty. Throughout the Scandinavian coun- 
tries there are innumerable physical education 
courses of this type, but no two have exactly 
the same programme. Each course is led by either 
a man or woman professor of physical education, 
who guides the course along his or her own 
personal lines. Here, Professor Ernst Idla 
instructs a group of Swedish girl students. His

### 69444: Report card on equal education

  
CAP AND GOWN (Cont'd) 
    
Ek DUCATION is recognized as the key 
to the improvement in women's status. 
It opens the door for women to new 
professions and a new place in society. 
Since 1946 Unesco has given special 
emphasis to the problem of increasing 
educational opportunities for women. 
It has brought together educational 
leaders from many countries to study 
this problem. An Arab States Con- 
ference on free and compulsory edu- 
cation in 1954 and a Pan-Pacific 
Women’s Conference held in Manila 
this year both gave the “access of 
women to education” their chief 
attention. 
Unesco has investigated why pro- 
gress has been hindered in certain 
countries. It has surveyed the reasons 
why girls and boys do not get an equal 
chance to go to school. It has issued 
comprehensive reports on education 
problems, such as: “Access of Women 
to Education”, “Women and Education 
(India, Yugoslavia and Chile)” and 
“Education of Women for Citizenship”. 
It has made country-wide surveys; 
established fundamental education 
training centres in the Middle East 
and Latin America and sent experts 
all over the world to help train women 
teachers. 
The facts and figures ‘which follow 
are taken from various Unesco reports 
and studies on women’s education, 
ILLITERACY 
I LLITERACY throughout the world is 
declining for both sexes, but it is de- 
clining more rapidly for men than for 
women. 
In only nine countries—Bermuda, 
Canada, Cuba, Hawaii, Jamaica, Span- 
ish Morocco, Sweden, the U.S.A. and 
the Windward Islands—is the illiteracy 
rate lower for women than for men. 
Female illiteracy usually runs much 
higher, particularly in Asia, the Near 
and Middle East and some parts of 
Latin America. In countries of South- 
East Asia female illiteracy averages 
71 % as against 44 % for men. In Latin 
America the figures are : 38.8 9% for 
men and 48.2 % for women. 
About 30 9% of the total population 
of the world lives in countries where 
female illiteracy in 1952 exceeded 50 %. 
Only between 5 % and 10 % of the 
world’s population lives in countries 
where female illiteracy is low. 
In Europe literacy is usually much 
higher, and in six European countries 
—Belgium, Finland, France, Italy, 
Spain and Sweden—the average illl- 
teracy rate for women is 13.4 %. The 
average for men is only 3.8 % lower. 
COMPULSORY 
PRIMARY SCHOOLING 
I N all countries where primary 
schools are open to boys and girlsthere 
are laws which oblige both sexes to 
attend these schools for a specified 
number of years, which differs from 
country to country. Canada has eight 
years of compulsory schooling for boys 
and girls, Denmark has seven, Finland 
has eight, France, the Netherlands and 
Switzerland all have eight, the U.K. 
has ten and the U.S.A. eight to 12. 
20 
S coor registers of the following 
countries show that 100 % of all the 
girls between the ages of five and 
fourteen go to school: Canada, the 
U.S.A, Belgium, France, German Fede- 
ral Republic, Netherlands, UK. Aus- 
tralia, New Zealand and Japan. In 
most of them there are more women 
teachers than men in the primary 
schools. Examples are: U.S.A. 88 % 
in 1951; Belgium 56 % in 1950; France 
64 % in 1951; England and Wales 72 % 
in 1951 and New Zealand 55 % in the 
same year. . 
* 
y V HERE there is compulsory educa- 
tion for girls, a Unesco report reveals 
that this has a direct bearing on 
family life. In such countries as Den- 
mark, the U.K. Sweden, the U.S.A, 
Australia and New Zealand the mor- 
tality rates per thousand live births are 
at their lowest. But in other countries 
where few girls go to school infant 
mortality rates are very high—from 
115 to 200 or more per thousand births. 
* 
A LTHOUGH in Asia co-educational 
primary schools are not the rule cer- 
tain countries, such as Burma, Ceylon, 
  
the Philippines and Thailand, have 
adopted the mixed primary school sys- 
tem. All these countries have shown, 
according to the findings of a Unesco 
study, an increase in the number of 
girls going to school. In Burma there 
was a 10 9% rise in 12 years, Ceylon 
showed an 8 % increase in 20 years, 
and the Philippines and Thailand have 
similar figures. The proportion of 
women teachers in these schools in 
Ceylon is 45 % (1952), Thailand 21 % 
(1951), and the Philippines 61 % (1948). 
* 
I. an investigation on the best me- 
thods to increase the numbers of girls 
at school, Unesco has shown that 
social aid measures yield practical 
results. The provision of school meals, 
clothing facilities, free distribution of 
school materials and free board and 
lodging have been introduced by many 
countries to encourage girls to attend 
school. Social workers are now being 
employed by many schools to deal with 
outside factors which affect school 
attendance, As a result flexible school 
schedules, whereby hours of work, 
vacation periods, and weekly holidays 
have been adjusted to suit local condi- 
tions, have been adopted. Other 
measures include : curriculum revision; 
improvement of the training and status 
of teachers ; closer links between 
parents and teachers and publicity 
campaigns. 
SECONDARY AND 
VOCATIONAL SCHOOLING 
E UROPE and North America have the 
largest proportion of girls in secondary 
schools, according to a Unesco report 
on the present position of free and 
compulsory education. Girls and boys 
have an equal chance of secondary 
schooling in 14 European and 12 North 
and Central American countries. No 
European country has an enrolment 
figure of less than 30 % for girls in 
secondary schools, 
* 
S EVERAL Latin American countries, 
where primary schools are open to 
girls and boys, now give opportunities 
for girls in secondary and vocational 
schools. Among these are the Domini- 
can Republic, Panama, Chile and Col- 
ombia all of which have roughly 
comparable figures. These work out at 
between approximately 40 % and 50 % 
of girls enrolled in secondary and vo- 
cational schools. 
* 
A recent Unesco report shows that 
more and more countries are trying to 
throw open their secondary schools 
equally to girls and boys, and at the 
same time to make part of the com- 
pulsory period of education for girls on 
the secondary level. Some countries, 
notably Canada, Denmark, Finland, 
France, the Netherlands, Sweden, 
Switzerland, the UK. and the U.S.A, 
have attained equality at the secon- 
dary level for girls and boys. But, says 
the Unesco report, in places where 
there are six years or less of compul- 
sory schooling for girls, and the law is 
imperfectly enforced, as in some Asian, 
Latin American and African countries, 
the proportion of girls in secondary 
schools is low. 
WOMEN TEACHERS 
y V HERE women teachers outnumber 
men in the primary schools the per- 
centage of girls attending schools in- 
creases from year to year. This im- 
portant point is brought out in a 
Unesco report on women teachers and 
teacher training. In countries such as 
Argentina, Chile, Mexico the U.S.A, 
France, Sweden, the U.K. the Philip- 
pines and New Zealand where the per- 
centage of women teachers is equal to 
or greater than that of men, there are 
as many girls as boys in the primary 
schools. However, in countries where 
there are few women teachers such as 
Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Egypt 
and Turkey, the number of girls in 
primary schools is low.

### 69472: Women in politics

Unesco Courier. — NT 11. — 1955 
  
      
Copyright Roger Viollet 
MILITANT SUFFRAGETTE speaks from the plinth at the base of Nelson’s 
statue in Trafalgar Square, London (above), early in the First World 
War. At this time, British suffragettes were not only demanding the 
right to vote but also asharein the country’s war effort (see posters   
POLITICS 
by 
Maurice Duverger 
in rear), Suffragettes, like the one seated behind speaker, often carried 
umbrellas. These were sometimes brought into play as ** weapons *' 
in the clashes that occurred with the police. Below, a woman at 
the polls in Australia, where women had the vote prior to 914.       
HERE are few modern countries which have not proclaimed 
T equality in the matter of political rights between men and 
women nor failed to establish it in their constitutions, codes 
and laws. But how far do the facts actually square with the law? 
How much real equality in political matters goes with the legal 
equality? 
To find the answers to these questions, Unesco’s Department of 
Social Sciences carried out an investigation into the part played 
by women in politics in four European countries. These countries 
were chosen on the basis of fairly comparable economic development 
and democratic beliefs, but at the same time on rather striking 
differences in the social and political situations which led to the 
granting of women’s rights. They were: 
Norway: where women were given the vote 50 years ago in the 
course of gradual development towards full democracy; 
France: where women got the vote after the Second World War; 
Yugoslavia: where a revolution in 1945 enabled women to obtain 
full franchise; 
Germany: where, although women obtained political rights in 
1919, normal development was interrupted by a period of totali- 
tarian government. 
The results of the surveys were assembled by M, Maurice Duverger, 
Professor of Political Science at the Universities of Paris and Bor- 
deaux, and published in the Unesco study “The Political Role of 
Women”. The situations revealed by the investigations and the 
conclusions drawn from them by Professor Duverger form the basis 
for the following article. 
ETWEEN the part played by women in elections and the 
part they play in political leadership a great difference 
exists. A close look at women’s political behaviour does 
not confirm the classic democratic doctrine that government 
reflects and represents the will of the people as expressed 
at elections. 
To judge by elections the proportion of women taking part 
in political life is large, and differs little from that of men, 
as regards either numbers or composition. There are gener- 
ally slightly more non-voters among women than among 
men, and the woman's vote is generally slightly more conser- 
vative and more subject to religious influences. But these 
differences are small and apply only to a tiny fraction of 
the female electorate. In certain exceptional circumstances, 
these marginal differences may have a considerable influence 
on the governmental majority and the trend of policy, but 
they still remain marginal. 
So far as government, in the broad sense of the term, is 
concerned, the position is entirely different. Here the poli- 
tical role of women is extremely small and grows still smaller 
as we approach the “centre” of political leadership. There 
are few women candidates at elections, fewer women mem- 
bers of parliament, still fewer women ministers, and no 
‘women heads of governments. (See diagram page 26.) 
This progressive decline in "women’s influence as the higher 
levels of leadership are reached is not only noticeable in the 
structure of the State and its political organs, but is also 
to be found in the government service, the political parties, 
the trade unions, private businesses, etc. Nor do there seem 
to be any signs of improvement. Although the difference in 
the proportions of men and women non-voters sometimes 
tends to lessen in certain countries, nothing similar can be 
noted at the parliamentary and governmental levels. The 
percentage of women members of parliament, for instance, is 
hardly increasing. On the contrary, it tends to fall after the 
first elections in which women have had the suffrage, and 
to become stabilized at a very low level. 
Though the part played by women in political 
leadership is small it has a special qualitative 
bias. "Here there is a fairly sharp difference in

* Restricted vote. 
GERMANY (1). — German women received the right to 
vote in 1919. Under the 1949 Fundamental Law of the 
Federal Republic of Germany and under the Constitution 
of the Democratic Republic of Germany, promulgated in 
the same year, women vote and are elected on an equal 
basis with men and have the same right as men to hold 
public office. 
AUSTRALIA (2). — In 189%, South Australia granted 
women the right to vote ; five years later West Australia 
did the same and by 1908 all the states had given equal 
voting rights. In 1902 the Commonwealth Franchise Act 
provided for a uniform federal franchise for the Common- 
wealth Parliament for all men and women over 21. 
BELGIUM (3). — Full voting rights were granted to Bel- 
gian women in 1948. Since 1921 they had only had the 
right to vote in local elections, with the exception of cer- 
tain women — wives, or failing them, mothers of men who 
had lost their lives during the First World War, or women 
who had been imprisoned by the enemy army — who were 
given the right to vote in national elections. 
BRAZIL (4). — In Brazil voting is compulsory for all 
men and women with the exception of infirm people and 
those aged over 70. 
CEYLON (5). — Women were enfranchised in Ceylon in 
1931, but their qualifying age was 30 as compared with 21 
for men. This inequality was removed in 1934, and by 
1946, two years before Ceylon achieved independence, uni- 
versality of suffrage and eligibility to public office were 
established on an equal basis for men and women. 
CHILE (6). — The right to vote in local elections was 
granted to Chilean women in 1931, providing they were 
literate, aged over 25, and had either property on which 
they paid taxes or followed a business or industrial pro- 
fession. In 1934 they were allowed to vote on equal terms 
with men in local elections, and in 1949 were granted 
suffrage in national elections. 
GUATEMALA (7). — Illiterate women may not vote, and 
voting for literate women is voluntary. Men, whether 
literate or illiterate, may vote; for literate men, voting is 
compulsory, for the illiterate, it is voluntary. 
HAITI (8). — Under the Constitution of 1950 women 
were restricted to voting in municipal elections until 1954. 
All disabilities will have been removed by 1957 and women 
will then have complete political rights. 
ICELAND (9). —— When Denmark enfranchised women in 
1915, Iceland was under Danish rule and the right to vote 
was extended to Icelandic women. In 1944 when Iceland 
severed its ties with the Danish Crown, women retained 
the right to vote under its new Republican Constitution. 
But to qualify as voters both men and women must be 
“of unblemished character and financially solvent”. 
LEBANON (10). — To be eligible to vote a woman must 
have a certificate of primary education or its equivalent. 
MONACO (11). — In Monaco, women have had the right 
to vote for and be elected to the Communal Council on 
the same conditions as men since 1945. 
PORTUGAL (12). — Women’s voting rights are subject 
to special educational or tax qualifications. Women who 
are heads of families may vote if they pay not less than 
100 escudos in taxes a year. Other women must either 
have completed a course in general studies in a secondary 
school, or taken a course in teaching or in an industrial or 
commercial institute, or studied fine arts or music, before 
they are eligible to vote. 
SYRIA (13). — Women over 18 years of age and possess- 
ing a certificate of at least primary education have had 
the right to vote since September 1949.

WOMEN [IN POLITICS (Cont'd from p. 21) 
EVE'S INHIBITIONS 
AND ANTI-FEMINISM 
IN BOTH SEXES 
Dr. Marie Elisabeth Liiders, the oldest 
member of the Federal German Bundestag, 
opening the constituent assembly session 
in the Bonn Parliament House on October 6 
1953. Opposite page, Mrs. Pankhurst, 
leader of the suffragette movement in

London policeman following a suffragette 
demonstration some forty years ago. 
behaviour between the sexes. In party.leadership, in senior 
administrative posts, in parliaments and in governments, the 
few women included concentrate on specialized matters, such 
as health, education, motherhood, family welfare, housing, 
etc.—on all problems which are generally considered to be 
of special interest to women. 
It might be thought that this specialization is chiefly 
characteristic of the first phase in 'women’s participation in 
political life, and that it will progressively diminish. But 
facts contradict this optimistic conclusion. So far, there are 
signs, on the contrary, of a very definite increase of this 
tendency towards specialization. 
Nothing demonstrates this trend more clearly than the 
history of the parties of the Left and the extreme Left as 
regards this problem. At the beginning of the century, they 
were vehemently against any sex discrimination and attempt- 
ed to give women and men strict equality in political life. 
Today, although they have not directly renounced their ori- 
ginal doctrine, they stress women’s role as wives and mothers 
and make their women leaders responsible for directing 
activities for women as such, developing housewives leagues, 
or mothers’ associations, in preference to encouraging women 
to join the parties themselves. 
First to lose jobs in a slump 
—_ 
He feminism of 1954 is not the same as that of 1900. 
In 1900, it refused to admit any distinction between 
the sexes and treated both men and women as citizens. 
But in 1954, it bases its doctrine on the differences between 
the sexes and encourages women to enter political life for the 
défence of interests which are considered to be their special 
concern. 
The small influence of women in the real leadership of 
States i.e. in the elaboration and application of political 
decisions, seems attributable, in the first instance, to male 
opposition. This opposition was already vigorous with regard 
to the suffrage. It is symptomatic that the right to vote has 
seldom been granted to women by a parliamentary decision, 
but has usually resulted from a revolution and the decision 
of a provisional government which had not been elected. 
In point of fact, this is true of three out of the four coun- 
tries investigated—Germany, France and Yugoslavia. Only

in Norway was woman's suffrage introduced by the ordinary 
democratic processes. Nevertheless, men’s opposition gra- 
dually abated as the results of women’s suffrage showed how 
little it had changed the earlier situation. At the govern- 
mental level, on the other hand, this opposition is still ex- 
tremely strong, since a strong feeling of competition exists. 
This seems to be a general tendency. As soon as there 
is a serious threat of unemployment in a trade or profession 
where the two sexes have previously been on an equal footing, 
women are the first to suffer, either by being the first effected 
by staff reductions or by discrimination in regard to wages, 
or by simply finding it impossible to obtain employment. The 
equality between men and women as regards gainful 
employment, seldom perfect, deteriorates as soon as compe- 
tition becomes keener. 
Now, there has always been extremely keen competition 
for political leadership. In the choice of a local party leader 
from among the members, of a candidate for election among 
the party leaders, or of a minister or 2 member of a parlia- 
mentary committee from among the members of parliament, 
the rivalry is intense. To give a post to a woman is to 
deprive a man of it and, in these circumstances, the posts 
given to women are cut down to the minimum required for 
propaganda purposes. 
All the evidence collected on this point in the various coun- 
tries is in agreement. In the realm of politics, the “promo- 
tion of women” comes up against a barrier of male opposi- 
tion. The official statements made at the last congress of 
the Yugoslav Communist League bear out the complaints 
formulated by French and German women members of par- 
liament and of political parties. ’ 
But the free access of women to education and higher 
education and their success in various careers makes it dif- 
ficult to maintain that they are by nature incapable of 
managing public affairs efficiently. Besides, as has often been 
observed, the results of men’s management have not been 
so brilliant in this field that the male sex can boast of its 
proven capability. Although the old argument of woman's 
mental incapacity is losing ground, it is being very success- 
fully replaced by a new form of justification which might 
be called the functional theory. 
In this, no attempt is made to maintain inequality bet- 
ween man and woman and the superiority of the former, 
but the object is to establish a kind of division of labour,

based on a difference of aptitudes. The slogan “woman’s 
place is in the home” is simply the extreme conservative form 
of a subtler and less uncompromising line of reasoning. More 
advanced exponents of the functional theory recognize the 
right of women to work outside the home and to take a part 
in civic and social life and in political affairs, but only on 
condition that they confine their activities to problems of 
motherhood, education, and the family—to what might be 
termed “home policy”. In this way they make the best of a 
bad job, whilst at the same time limiting the damages. 
However subtle their arguments in justification, men’s 
opposition to the participation of women in political life 
would not have succeeded so well if it had come up against 
vigorous resistance from women. But, in general, such resist- 
ance is weak and is conducted, in the main, by small isolat- 
ed minority groups which have no chance of securing results. 
It must be acknowledged that the small influence of women 
in State leadership is largely due to women’s own inertia. 
They don’t want to be leaders 
HERE can be no denying that women are less interested 
T in politics than men. In the IFOP (1) investigation 
conducted in June 1953, less than two months after the 
municipal elections, two out of three men (60 per cent) said 
that they had been interested in the results for the whole 
country, as against one woman out of three (34 per cent). 
Roughly the same proportion (70 per cent of men and 35 per 
cent of women) answered the following question in the affir- 
mative. “Do you ever discuss politics with people you know 
well?”. The answers to the next question “Do you ever 
discuss politics with people you know little or not at all?” are 
still more significant, for 30 per cent of the men answered 
“yes” as against 10 per cent of the women. To the direct 
question “Are you interested in politics” the answers were as 
follows: Men. “Yes”, 36 per cent; “slightly”. 36 per cent: 
“No”, 28 per cent. Women. “Yes”, 13 per cent; “slightly”, 
27 per cent; “No”, 60 per cent. 
As it was, this referred only to a vague general interest 
in “politics” as a whole. When we come to consider active 
participation in political life and the possibility of standing 
as candidates, women’s attitude is the same—46 per cent 
of the women questioned by the IFOP thought that a woman 
ought not to stand for the municipal elections (the least poli- 
tical of all) but only 14 per cent expressed the same dis- 
approval in the case of a man candidate. 
Not only do women show little desire to win a place in 
political leadership, but the great majority of them accept 
the system of justification invented by men to rationalize 
their standing aside from it. Curiously, they sometimes 
seem to be more uncompromising than men in this regard, 
and more anti-feminist. Consider the following results of 
the IFOP survey. The persons questioned were given a list 
of activities ranging from the simple reading of political 
news to standing for election or campaigning actively for a 
political party. They were asked if there were any activities 
on this list ‘which seemed to them unsuitable for members 
of their own or the opposite sex. The answers were as 
  
   
follows: 
For a person of For a person of 
Answer your own sex the opposite sex

% % % %

No, there are not .... 78 16 26 76 
No answer .......... 6 8 10 9             
The change in the attitude of the left-wing parties 
towards women is probably linked with the realization of 
this fundamental fact. When they championed the argu- 
ments of traditional feminism, of the absolute equality of 
men and women, of their identical part in political life as 
citizens, they were not followed by the female public any 
more than by the male public. It is significant from this 
point of view that the only mass movements which attract 
women are para-political organizations such as the Union des 
Femmes francaises and the Ligue Féminine d’ Action Catho- 
ligue, which have specifically “feminine” objects and specia-

d'Oplnion Publique),

lized interests and which do not openly admit their political 
connexions and their political interests. 
It may be that the change in the policy of certain left- 
wing parties in this field is purely a matter of tactics and 
does not compromise their long-term strategy, which is 
designed to establish real equality between the sexes; none 
the less, the change is important in analysing the present 
opinions of women with regard to their role in political life. 
We still have to determine on what grounds these opinions 
are based. Why do ‘women agree to specialize in family, 
household and educational matters, while admitting that 
men can do anything? Why are not women feminists, or not 
more so? There is a large measure of truth in the economic 
explanation advanced by some people. 
Women are intensely conscious of the 'wife’s economic 
dependence on the husband. To some extent, moreover, this 
feeling develops simultaneously with the increase in the 
number of women earning their own living, When very few 
women had their own income, those who remained at home 
felt that their position was natural and inevitable, in accord- 
ance with the natural order of things, unquestioned and 
unquestionable. Today, some women are developing an 
inferiority complex in this respect, often enough kept in 
being by the husband (“I earn OUR living” is a typical retort 
in family arguments). 
In point of fact, the economic factor ought not to be consi- 
dered in isolation. Whether a woman has a career or not, 
whether she earns her own living or not, she has a place in 
a general social structure (in which economic factors, inci- 
dentally, play an essential part). It is in the general struc- 
ture of society, in the psychological and social environment, 
that the fundamental explanation of ‘women’s behaviour 
should probably be sought. The laws establishing the civic 
equality of men and women are in advance of the customs of 
society. In spite of the far-reaching changes of the last 
half-century, western civilizations are still based 
on the pre-eminence of the man. (Cont'd on

From here and there 
IN LAW AND GOVERNMENT 
Recent advances made by women in the fields of 
politics and the law include the following: seven 
women senators and twenty-four women deputies in 
Argentina; two women deputies in Brazil; three in 
Costa Rica; three senators and two deputies in the 
Dominican Republic; three women mayors in Haiti; 
a woman senator and sixteen women representatives 
in the United States Congress; ten deputies in Vene- 
zuela; two in Colombia. In Switzerland, where 
women do not yet have the vote, the Canton of 
Basle recently granted women the right to be 
appointed judges and assessors. In Turkey, two 
women have been appointed to the Supreme Court 
and the Philippine Government has appointed three 
women district court judges. 
WOMEN AT THE U.N.: 
Seventeen nations include women as members of 
their permanent missions to the United Nations. 
Among them are Mrs. Nonny M. Wright, economist 
and Counsellor to the Danish Mission, who has been 
in the U.N. Economic and Social Council since 1947; 
Miss Uldarica Manas, writer and member of Cuba's 
foreign service since 1937, who has represented Cuba 
at the U.N. since 1946, and Mrs. Zena Harman, social 
affairs adviser and alternate representative on the 
Israel Delegation. 
A NEW MILESTONE: 
Adoption of the Convention on the Political Rights 
of Women by the U.N. General Assembly in 1952 was 
a new milestone in women’s advance towards equal 
political rights with men. So far forty States have 
signed the Convention; twenty-two have so far ra- 
tified or acceded to it. Altogether, women enjoy 
equal voting rights in sixty-two countries. 
SUCCESS IN BRITAIN: 
The first move in a campaign for votes for women 
in Britain which lasted 51 years was taken in 1867 
with the founding of the London National Society 
for Women’s Suffrage. Today British women voters 
outnumber men. There are one and three quarter 
million women in the trade unions, and women sit 
on the Council of the Trade Union Congress. The 
first Women’s Institute in Britain was founded in 
1917. There are now over 8,000—two for every 
three villages in the country. 
INDIA’S CIVIL SERVANTS: 
The total of 20,688 women now employed in Indian 
Government Departments is made up as follows: 
Ministry of Communications, 8,800; Defence, 3,000; 
Production, 1,072; Food and Agriculture, 206; Exter- 
nal Affairs, 701; Information and Broadcasting, 225; 
Other ministries, 6.684. 
EQUAL VOTING IN THE U.S.S.R.: 
After the revolution of 1917, a decree of the Provi- 
sional Government issued in the autumn of that 
year granted women the right to vote. The follow- 
ing year the All-Russian Congress of Soviets adopt- 
ed a constitution granting women of 18 and over 
voting rights, and the right to hold public office on 
an equal basis with men. The 1936 constitution 
proclaimed equal rights for men and women, 
THEY SIGNED THE CHARTER: 
Ten years ago in San Francisco four women 
representing their countries affixed their signatures 
to the Charter of the United Nations. They were 
Miss Minerva Bernadino for the Dominican Republic, 
Dr. Virginia C. Gildersleeve for the U.S.A., Dr. Ber- 
tha Lutz for Brazil and Dr. Wu Yi-fang for China.

### 69472: Women in politics

WOMEN IN POLITICS (continued) 
to political careers, it is because everything tends to turn 
them away from them; if they allow politics to remain essen- 
tially a man’s business, it is because everything conduces to 
this belief, tradition, family life, education; religion and 
literature. From birth, women are involved in a system which 
tends to make them think of themselves as feminine. 
Besides her specialization in the tasks of mother, wife and 
housewife, her introverted attitude towards the home, that 
closed world which should absorb all her energies and all her 
dreams, a woman also has a feeling of dependance on man. 
This is perhaps the fundamental obstacle to her playing a full 
part in political life. Under a democratic system, political 
activity is essentially adult. It presupposes that anyone en- 
gaging in it takes full responsibility for his fate and does not 
leave it to another to decide for him. It is diametrically 
opposed to any form of paternalism in social relations. But, 
while women have, legally, ceased to be minors, they still have 
the mentality of minors in many fields and, particularly in 
politics, they usually accept paternalism on the part of men. 
The man—husband, fiancé, lover or myth—is the mediator 
between them and the political ‘world. “When things go 
wrong, women blame their husbands, men blame the govern- 
ment” is a fairly apt summing up of this basic attitude. 
The French reporter’s analysis of sentimental women’s 
magazines (la presse du cceur) shows up all its implications. 
Faced with the same basic set of circumstances—an inferior 
social and economic position, leading to a sense of deprivation

and frustration and a feeling of belonging to a “proletariat”, 
young men tend to turn towards the revolutionary parties or 
the trade unions, young women towards the expectation of a 
rich and handsome “prince charming”, who will deliver them 
from the poverty and ugliness of their everyday world. 
It is therefore useless to seek to give women a larger part in 
political life by special reforms in this particular field. The 
small part played by women in politics merely reflects and 
results from the secondary place to which they are still 
assigned by the customs and attitudes of our society and 
which their education and training tend to make them accept 
as the natural order of things. Purely political reforms are 
effective here only so far as they tend gradually to modify 
this situation, to counteract the effects of habit and tradition, 
to help women to free themselves from them, and to awaken 
them to a sense of their own independence. 
From this point of view, woman’s suffrage is probably a 
most important reform; if its short-term political results are 
small, its long-term educational value seems to be great. It 
is probably still more important to fight against the deeply- 
rooted belief in the natural inferiority of women, based on 
physiological or psycho-physiological considerations—a par- 
ticularly serious obstacle because women feel deeply the 
special characteristics of their sex in this respect, 
All the efforts of mankind are, in fact, directed to overcom- 
ing inequalities deriving from differences in natural condi- 
tions. From this point of view, those deriving from sex are 
no more important than those resulting from climate, soil 
composition or difficulties of communications. There is no 
more an inferior sex than there are inferior races or inferior 
classes. But there is a sex, and there are ciasses and races, 
who have come to believe in their inferiority because they 
have been persuaded of it in justification of their subordinate 
position in society.

CUSTOM

THE LAW 
Jokakou University were ad- 
monished by the head of the 
university for having had their hair 
permanently waved.” This minor news 
item which appeared in a Japanese 
newspaper is surprising for two rea- 
sons: Japan is one of the countries 
where the fight for ‘women’s rights has

“F ORTY-FOUR women students of 
met with the least resistance; the uni- 
versity in question was one of the first 
to open its doors to women back in 
1906. 
The exact reason for the rebuke is 
of less importance than the incident 
itself, for here is one more proof that 
the customs of society evolve more 
slowly than the minds of lawmakers. 
The great spiritual and moral malaise 
which afflicts much of mankind owes 
a great deal to the fact that our moral 
conceptions and sentiments are still 
anchored in the past and have little 
in common with our own times. Cus- 
toms have not kept pace with the 
changes imposed by technical progress. 
A Japanese professor who tells his 
women students about the most recent 
discoveries in biology, and explains 
the various organic functions of the 
human body, is shocked because these 
young women come to lectures with 
their hair permanently waved. It would 
not have been allowed “in his time”. 
He drives a car, travels by plane and 
breathes the air of the 1950s but “his 
time” dates back some 30 years. 
How many others are there just like 
him? The member of parliament who, 
in the morning supports a new di- 
vorce law granting greater rights to 
women, may be outraged in the after- 
noon when he learns that his son loves 
and wants to marry a divorced woman. 
Civil Codes and laws may give a 
woman the right to do many things, 
but if she actually does them she may 
find herself criticized and condemned. 
She must always be on her guard 
against the pitfalls opened by the gap 
which exists today between customs 
and rights. 
The ethical principles ‘which govern 
the social behaviour of almost all peo- 
ples are nearly always religious in

origin. That is why religion has always 
played an important role in family 
organization and has determined the 
place of the wife. The family, as the 
basic unit of society, was established 
on the principle of monogamy. For far 
too long it has been asserted incorrect 
ly that human beings are polygamous 
by nature. Recent studies by anthro- 
pologists have shown quite clearly that 
the reverse is true. 
Queen with 400 ‘husbands’ 
oLYcaMy only appeared at .an 
P advanced stage of social evolu- 
tion. In patriarchial communi- 
ties where polygamy is practised, a 
man has the right to several wives, 
just as, in a matriarchy where polyan- 
dry is customary, it is the woman who 
can have a harem. Kahena, Queen of 
a Berber tribe in the Atlas Mountains, 
who resisted Islam and the Arab in- 
vaders, had 400 “husbands”. In Ruan- 
da-Urundi in the Belgian Congo, there 
is a tribe whose female chief has a 
harem of something like 200 men. And 
in the ancient world of the Middle 
East there were peoples whose customs 
required several brothers to marry the 
same woman. Jealousy seems to be 
one of the fruits of civilization. 
Because the family is itself a commu- 
nity it must have a head. Should this 
be the husband or the wife? As the 
question is not one of rights but rather 
of conventions, it cannot be settled by 
law. Such conventions may have an 
internal family character and be quite 
independent of customs. Although in 
past times the support of the family 
depended entirely on the efforts of the 
husband, and the wife concerned her- 
self solely with household tasks, the 
man did not always demand the rights 
of family head within his own home.

In China, until the Kuomintang 
came to power, women had practically 
no legal rights but they took the ini- 
tiative in the private affairs of their 
family, They decided how the chil- 
dren should be educated, what callings 
their sons should follow and even whom 
they should marry. In Asia and in 
Africa some tribes consider women as 
guardians of the line of family descent 
which, therefore, takes the woman's 
name, not the husband’s. 
Despite her emancipation a woman 
fills different roles from a man both 
in the community and the family. 
Equality of rights ought not to lead to 
the foolish idea that women should 
, live and behave like men. While en- 
joying the same rights men and women 
have their own places in life and are 
faced with different jobs and respon- 
sibilities. 
Sometimes society itself encourages 
a woman to develop an absurd idea 
about her role in life. Look how many 
people there are who quite wrongly 
think that the work done by a woman 
in her home is of less value than that 
done by her husband in an office or 
a factory. A woman who looks after 
her home properly and brings up her 
children to be honest, law-abiding citi- 
zens has just as much reason to be 
proud as a skilled surgeon who success- 
fully carries out a difficult operation. 
But it would be just as wrong to 
consider sewing on buttons or darning 
stockings as the ideal role for a woman. 
This brings to mind the case of the 
husband in the United States whose 
wife decided that she wished to conti- 
nue her education at a university. He 
forbade his wife to attend the univer- 
sity lectures and told her to spend more 
time mending his shirts and socks. The 
wife finally took her case to court 
which recognized her right to follow 
  
any studies she wished and ordered her 
husband to pay for this education. 
The nationality of married women is 
one of the problems with which legis- 
lators are working af present. Should 
the woman who marries a foreigner 
have the right to retain her own nation- 
ality or should she be obliged to adopt 
that of her husband? 
There are two main points of view 
on this question. The first is based on 
the principle of legal equality between 
the sexes. If a woman is recognized as 
being the equal of a man in all ques- 
tions of rights, she can hardly be fore- 
ed to renounce her nationality simply 
because she marries a foreigner. This 
principle has been accepted by most 
countries. 
Are men really unhappy ? 
HE second argument fakes as its 
basis the need for family unity. 
Those who support it claim that 
the moral and spiritual unity of the 
family is threatened if the parents and 
children are not of the same nation- 
ality, Complications may arise not only 
through purely administrative ques- 
tions, but also because of political 
events which may divide the members 
of the family. India and Egypt are 
two countries which support this prin- 
ciple and believe that in all cases a 
woman should adopt her husband’s 
nationality. 
The laws which govern this question 
vary widely from country to country, 
and an international convention bring- 
ing some order into the matter would 
be of great benefit. For several years 
prior to the Second World War. the 
League of Nations tried to draw up 
such a convention. Several countries 
Unesco Courier. — Nr 11. — 1955 
Copyright S. Matsubara 
have since revised their laws, but there 
are so many complications involved 
- that jurists working on the problem 
find themselves in a maze of par- 
agraphs with fine shades of meaning. 
Today the United Nations is working on 
the question and a draft convention is 
now before the General Assembly. 
But even in law the equality of the 
two sexes can never be complete. A 
woman’s physical capacities must be 
taken into account. Sometimes she 
obtains advantages from them. For 
example, in thirty-three countries the 
legal minimum age for marriage is 
lower for women than for men. In 
nine States of the U.S.A. girls reach 
their majority at the age of 18, but 
young men do so only at 21. 
In sport a woman’s abilities are go- 
verned by her physical capacities. It 
is interesting to compare the relative 
athletic records achieved by men and 
women. The fastest woman sprinter in 
the world is Mrs. Blankers-Koen of 
Holland, who ran 100 metres in 11,5 
seconds; the male record is 10.2 se- 
conds. A Russian woman, Mrs Pletnova 
ran 800 metres in two minutes eight 
and a half seconds; the German male 
record holder took 25 seconds less to 
run the same distance. The record 
high jump for a woman is 172 centime- 
tres; the male record is 211 centimetres. 
In swimming, the best time for 100 me- 
tres achieved by a man is nine seconds 
less than the woman’s record. Few, 
if any, women have distinguished 
themselves behind the wheel of a rac- 
ing car, although there are many who 
have become world-famous pilots. 
But are men really more unhappy 
because their womenfolk have come 
out of the home in order to add their 
energies to those forces which deter- 
mine the progress of the world? Cer- 
tainly not!

### 69475: Women in primitive society: exploding some false notions

inferior beings often described by writers of the last 
century? Many people still think they are, for the 
picture drawn by so many travellers, of the native ‘woman 
bent under the weight of a heavy burden, clutching a child 
to her breast, while her husband walks lightheartedly ahead, 
bow in hand, has become accepted as the symbol of the 
degradation of women In “savage” communities. 
It is also true that for some time an entirely opposite idea 
has persisted concerning a primitive matriarchy. Many 
historians ‘assumed its existence, traces of which could be 
found among “savage” tribes, and great efforts were made 
to seek facts which would point to a phase in human 
development when women ruled over men. 
Such ideas as these are apt to distort our judgment just 
when the so-called “primitive” peoples have ceased to belong 
to a distant world and are beginning to play a direct part in 
our own civilization. If we are to help them adapt 
themselves to this change we should not add to a somewhat 
condescending pity for their unperfected techniques, a 
disdain for customs we simply do not understand. Of course, 
innumerable studies have been written about this vast 
subject, and all I can hope to do here is to clear up a few 
points about which there are the most mistaken ideas. 
Before conclusions can be drawn about the status of women 
in any particular community it must be considered against 
each different aspect of the culture. Even in a civilization 
like our own where equality of the sexes is often given legal 
recognition and where, economically and socially, women are 
playing an increasingly important role, there are some insti- 
tutions in which they are given only a subordinate and 
insignificant place. 
\ RE women in “primitive” societies the drudges and 
Female shock troops 
sent heads flying 
N religion, for instance, a sphere in which women are 
I noted for their piety and zeal, the priesthood is barred to 
them, and with it the entire ecclesiastical hierarchy. 
The idea of a woman as a bishop or a Chief Rabbi seems 
slightly comic, if not sacrilegious and shocking. 
That women should be handicapped in this respect might 
well surprise members of other civilizations where it is 
precisely women ‘who are chosen as mediators between men 
and the spirit world. It is their privilege to receive revela- 
tions, and to invoke the spirits, to appease their wrath or 
obtain their favours. Men, even those most highly placed in 
the social hierarchy, listen to them and ask their advice on 
everything relating to the supernatural. 
This is particularly the case among fribes practising 
Shamanism, where women monopolize religious life, and are 
thought to be specially gifted for maintaining regular contact 
with spirits. Amongst the Araucanian Indians in Chile, a 
once great and virile tribe, men who felt drawn towards 
magic or the priesthood dressed as women and tried to look 
like them in every way. In North America, the ceremonial 
life of the famous Iroquois tribe of New York State was very 
largely controlled by its women. 
It is a sad reflection on our own times that women have 
been so associated with military life. Generally speaking, and 
despite legends about the Amazons, most “primitive” peoples 
considered women unfit for warfare, though the story of the 
women’s regiments of Dahomey, in Africa, throws doubt on 
the physical and physiological reasons usually given to justi- 
fy the exclusion of women from fighting. The Dahomey 
Dr. Alfred METRAUX was anly 2] when he made his first expedition, an archaeo- 
logical study in Latin America. Since then, his career as a practising anthropologist 
has taken him over most of Latin America and the South Sea Islands. He has 
conducted several missions for Unesco and as a member of Unesco’s staff is associated 
with its campaign against racial discrimination. Swiss born, Dr. Metraux is 
now a citizen of the United States. He has written numerous studies on tribes of 
South America and the Pacific.

shock troops were made up entirely of young women, who, in 
theory, passed for the ruler’s wives, During battles or sieges, 
they were held in reserve until the chief warrior decided that 
the moment had come to snatch a decisive victory by throw- 
ing his best troops into the fray. The women hurled 
themselves upon the enemy, brandishing enormous scimitars 
with which they sent heads flying in all directions. To these 
formidable Amazons fell the task of defending the indepen- 
dence of Behanzin’s Kingdom when Dahomey was conquered 
by French troops some fifty years ago.

HE worst mistakes that have been made in assessing the 
true status of “primitive woman” have generally been 
caused by confusion between legal status and actual 
status. By placing the emphasis solely on the authority of 
the husband, and in particular on such customs as the pur- 
chase of wives, a very grim picture can be painted of the life 
of women in “savage” communities. But when we take a 
closer look at the behaviour of both sexes and discover the 
true meaning of certain customs, we soon realize that the 
inequality between men and women is not early as great as 
it looks. In fact according to the angle from which we con- 
sider the problem, disadvantages are counterbalanced by 
privileges that are often of great importance. 
The famous American ethnographer and sociologist, 
Dr. Robert H. Lowie was not merely indulging in a witty 
paradox ‘when he wrote, in his treatise on primitive sociology: 
“George Eliot and Madame Récamier, in spite of their social 
influence, did not even remotely approach the legal position 
of the average Iroquois matron”. He could not have chosen 
a better example, for there are few communities in which 
women wielded such power as did the matrons of this Red 
Indian tribe. They had no place in the council of the tribe 
nor in the council of the great Iroquois League, but they 
nominated their members. Political authority rested on their 
choice and they had the additional power of deposing chiefs 
whom they deemed unequal to their task. 
The role of women in political affairs brings us back to 
the problem of matriarchy. The existence of a social order 
‘where women ruled over men has been relegated to the realm 
of mythology. With the exception of the Iroquois, and a very 
few other tribes, it is only by accident that women have 
wielded political power. 
Unsatisfactory husbands are 
turned out of the hut 
HE idea of primitive matriarchy arises out of a confusion 
between matrilineal descent and female rule. The fact 
that a person belongs to his mother’s clan, inherits 
from his maternal uncle and looks upon the members of his 
father’s clan as strangers, does not mean that women enjoy 
a privileged position. In a great many “primitive” commun- 
ities, the husband is obliged by custom to live at his wife’s 
home; but although this state of affairs may be advantageous 
to the wife, if does not imply any superiority of the female 
sex, though of course the woman who stays with her family 
does not run the risk of being ill-treated by her husband, 
since any injustice or brutality on his part would soon bring 
upon him the wrath of the whole household, 
Amongst the Pueblo Indians in the south-west United 
States, the women own the family hut, and can drive out 
husbands who no longer please them. It is not pro oe rr ® 
surprising that the men are ill at ease (Cont'd on.

they can count on the affection and trust of their relations. 
Some anthropologists have tried to correlate the economy 
of a given community with the status of its women. Indeed, 
amongst a number of so-called “primitive” peoples, soil culti- 
vation is left entirely to the women. In the Amazon region, 
for instance, the men simply clear the land, and all the rest 
of the agricultural labour is provided by the women. If is 
they who plant, harvest and carry the crops. As basic food 
supplies depend on agriculture, it is reasonable to suppose 
that women occupy a strong position in the life of the tribe. 
Conversely in communities which depend for their livelihood 
on hunting and fishing, the status of women might be 
expected to show their dependence on the men. Once again, 
however, facts disprove theory. 
In some communities of nomad hunters, the sexes have 
more or less equal rights, whereas in other groups, woman 
occupies a decidedly inferior position, even though she is the 
chief provider of food. From these examples, therefore, it 
cannot be said that economic development necessarily pro- 
32 
duces any change in the status of women. There does, how- 
ever, appear to be a close connexion between the raising of 
livestock and the relegation of women to a position of 
inferiority. 
The subordination of women and the very minor role they 
were given outside the home in early European and Asiatic 
communities is ascribed to the influence of the nomad 
herdsmen. Is there a cause and effect relationship between 
stock-raising—a masculine activity—and female inferiority? 
Some people have thought so, but anthropologists see in this 
relationship the effect of a historical accident, and cite the 
case of pastoral tribes like the Hottentots, who do not treat 
women as inferior beings. 
The argument most often used to demonstrate the infer- 
jority of “primitive” woman, is that in many communities— 
particularly in Africa—women are bought by their future 
husbands. Much has been ‘written both to protest against 
this custom, and to defend it and explain its significance. 
The purchase of women in East Africa, for example—the

lobola as it is called—generally takes the form of the delivery 
to the girl’s family of so many head of cattle. To acquire 
enough head of cattle to be able to marry is the main concern 
of the young men of many tribes. I{ is not a mere commer- 
cial transaction, but something much more complicated. In 
the first place, the handing over of the cattle gives official 
sanction to the marriage; it is the equivalent of a marriage 
contract in societies like our own, and the woman for whom 
no cattle had changed hands would not feel that her marriage 
was valid. 
The young man’s family, on the other hand, is not purchas- 
ing the woman herself, but a proprietary right over her issue. 
If no “payment” had been made, the children of the marriage 
would belong to the wife’s family. The cattle therefore 
represent a form of marriage settlement paid by the husband 
to his future bride’s parents, to be administered by them on 
her behalf and that of her children. Sometimes if the wife 
dies childless, the cattle must be returned to the husband. 
In short, in the transaction wrongly known as bride-purchase,

the legal aspect is more important than the economic. If is 
not a “business deal”, but a solemn act giving legal sanction 
to the marriage and ensuring the legitimacy of the offspring. 
In attempting to clarify these points, I have merely tried to 
render justice to peoples commonly called “primitive” or 
“inferior”. In spite of our enormous technical progress, we 
ourselves find it difficult to throw off customs inherited from 
our Indo-European forefathers—those nomad herdsmen who 
showed so little indulgence towards the other sex. The 
attainment of rights for women often does no .more than 
introduce into our civilization a state of affairs in fact and 
in law, which has existed for centuries and even for thousands 
of years amongst peoples we are too often apt to despise.

### 69476: The Hand that rocks the cradle...

THE HAND THAT ROCKS 
THE CRADLE. 
by Lucienne Noblet 
RADITIONAL ideas die hard. Eight men out of ten, if 
asked the not-so-simple question “Does your wife 
work?” rarely hesitate to reply: “My wife? She doesn’t 
do anything... She stays at home.” 
Most men take it pretty much for granted that the ordinary 
housewife has the luck to lead a privileged life of ease, with 
plenty of free time on her hands during the day. He is 
blissfully unaware of how much time really goes into the 
care of the home, cooking 
meals and looking after 
children. 
Just recently social re- 
search experts in the U.S.A, 
Gt. Britain, Belgium and 
France added up what they 
thought was the real value 
of work done by house- 
wives. First of all they 
found that the wife who 
“doesn’t do anything” pro- 
vides the country with more 
than a bit of all it’s money. 
The experts use the term 
“quite a considerable part 
of its national income”, 
They also found out that 
the figures for the four 
countries were all much 
about the same, and if the 
four sets of figures were 
put together the stay-at- 
home wives were handling 
and administering some 
60 % of all the money in 
the country. So it looks 
after all as if the mother 
in the home is, perhaps, 
just as much a financial 
wizard as any Wall Street 
tycoon. 
The French survey, carried out by the National Institute 
of Demographic Studies, got some interesting facts to show 
that a woman's work is never done. They found that the 
average French housewife in the large towns, such as Paris, 
Lyons and Marseilles, works a 70-hour week. They took 
this figure and put it against the total number of households 
in France (13 million). The surprising result was that 
housewives were found to work some four thousand million 
hours more than all the other kinds of workers in the 
country, both men and women. This means that looking 
after French homes and children takes quite a bit more time 
that the whole of French business, industry, agriculture and 
administration. Here once again the figures for the U.S.A, 
the U.K. and Belgium were much the same. 
These facts and figures are not, perhaps, so surprising if 
we take a look at some of the replies given by French 
housewives in another survey carried out by the International 
Association of Women Doctors, aimed at determining the 
extent to which housewives overwork. Most wives ‘with 
children to look after put in between 10 and 14 hours work a 
day, and only those with grown-up families said that they 
did less than 8 hours a day. 
Asked whether they had a complete day’s break in their 
working week, most replied “No” or “Rarely”, while some 
admitted to a half-day on Sunday. As for holidays the 
majority said that they never had any real holidays as 
34 
more often than not they had to carry on with their normal 
household chores in conditions which were sometimes worse 
than in their own homes. One mother with six children gave 
the shocking reply that her only holidays consisted of the 
eleven-day periods when she was bearing her children. 
All-in-all the surveys revealed that about three-quarters of 
housewives do not have a proper holiday. Some of the 
reasons given by French housewives for the causes of fatigue 
: and illness were: looking 
after children; noise; lack 
of time for rest and sleep; 
monotony of work; solitude. 
Going with these is the 
sense of inferiority with 
regard to their work which 
is not appreciated in the 
way it should be.

But this sense of inferio- 
rity is now on the way to 
being overcome, and Go- 
vernments in the UK, 
Ireland and Western Ger- 
many, to take only three 
3 
g 
examples, have now re- 
cognized that women’s 
work in the home is 
just as important as any 
other kind of “professional” 
work, and “without it, the 
nation could not survive.” 
Particularly important is 
the mother’s role in the 
training and education of 
her children. Here, her 
guidance and help are 
practically irreplaceable. 
To take the words of the 
French enquiry “Every child 
needs the warm affection 
of its mother, or of 
someone capable of replacing her permanently. If that need 
is not met, the psychological injury inflicted will have deep 
repercussions in later life.”

But, if the real ‘worth of woman’s work in the home is now 
being appreciated, little attention has been given to her 
status as a housewife. She has been called “irreplaceable”, 
but up to now she has not had a chance to benefit from the 
tremendous improvement in labour conditions. Not for her 
the five-day-week, holidays with pay and retirement on’ 
pension. In official eyes she still counts for little. 
Can anything be done about this? Certainly the first 
thing which comes to mind is the need for more domestic 
help. Although it is true that this is fast disappearing in 
most countries of the world, nevertheless some positive steps 
could be taken along other lines. 
For example, the French Association of Women Doctors has 
suggested that laundry services could be improved, the 
number of mothers-aid ‘workers increased, family holiday 
centres established and domestic science courses made more 
easily available. 
Here are some concrete proposals which could help in giving 
the housewife greater liberty, and more time to devote herself 
to outside interests, and to the training and education of her 
children.

### 69477: The Vanishing veil: a challenge to the old order

THE VANISHING VEIL 
A challenge to the old order 
by A.H. Hourani 
  
Unesco Courier, — Nr 11, — 1955 
OST Arabs are Moslems, and for 
M over a thousand years their 
social life has been governed 
by the Law of Islam. Therefore, if we 
wish to know what the life of Arab 
women was, and to some extent still 
is, we must first otf all ask what Islamic 
law says it ought to be. 
Islam allows polygamy : those who 
know nothing else about Islam know 
this, although they may not be aware 
of the limits placed upon polygamy—a 
man may have no more than four 
wives, and only on condition that he 
treats all of them justly. Islam allows 
easy divorce too, and in practice it has 
always been much easier for men to 
divorce their wives than for women to 
divorce their husbands. But on the 
other hand married women are given 
the right to own property and to be 
maintained if they are divorced; and 
women have the right to inherit, 
although within limits—a sister re- 
ceives only half as much as her brother 
from their father’s estate. 
Law is not the only force which 
moulds society; the Arab community 
has been influenced too by social 
customs which are not Moslem in 
origin, although they have been 
widespread in Moslem countries. By 
tradition Moslem women are secluded: 
hidden in the harem when at home, 
behind the veil when they go out. 
But seclusion existed in the Middle 
de 
Lal 
Two years ago Egyptian “suffra- 
gettes” went on hunger strike 
in Cairo for ten days (upper 
photo) to draw the Govern- 
ment’s attention to their de- 
mands for women's rights. Lea- 
der of this Egyptian women’s 
movement is Miss Dorria Shafik 
(being interviewed by journa- 
lists below). The Government 
is considering these demands. 
*   
East before Islam arose. From the 
time of the ancient Kings of Persia, 
Eastern rulers have withdrawn them- 
selves and their womenfolk from the 
public gaze, to emphasize the majesty 
of Kingship. Moslem Caliphs and 
Sultans adopted this habit, and what 
the rulers did their subjects copied, 
particularly the richer population of 
the towns. Perhaps there is something 
in Islamic conceptions which helped 
the spread of this custom: but it is not 
essentially nor exclusively Moslem, and 
until recently Christian women as well 
as Moslems wore the veil in the streets 
of Arab towns. 
This custom of seclusion, however, 
was always held in check by othe: 
traditions. Social customs among the 
Bedouin of the desert are freer than 
those of the towns; and in the country- 
side economic necessity made the 
woman the companion of her husband's 
labour in the flelds. Even in the towns 
there were women who broke through 
the barriers of custom and played a 
part in literary, religious and even 
political life. In thirteenth century 
Egypt there was a Queen, Shajar ad- 
Durr, who kept her husband and the 
country in subjection for seven years. - 
She was an exception, and virtually 
the only woman to have her name 
inscribed on Islamic coins. It is only 
in the last two generations ’ 
that the traditional idea of (Contd 
women’s status has been pag

(Continued) 
Tradition requires that Moslem women go 
veiled in public as in picture on right taken

to learn and to open their eyes to the world

. challenged on a large scale. It was 
indeed only about fifty years ago that a 
writer in Arabic gave the first full 
statement on the need and reasons for 
a change. He was an Egyptian, Qasim 
Amin, who wrote two famous books, 
“The New Woman” and “The Libera- 
tion of Woman”. In them he argued 
that a gradual and careful change in 
the status of women was not contrary 
to the principles of Islam. 
His ideas met with great opposition 
at the time, but in the last fifty years 
much of what he suggested has been 
carried out, at least in the more 
advanced Arab countries—Egypt, Syria, 
Jordan, Lebanon and Iraq. Even in 
countries where the process of social 
change has begun more recently, like 
the Sudan, it has already influenced 
the position of women. It is only in 
the countries of the Arabian Peninsula, 
Saudi Arabia and Yemen, that the old 
order still persists unaltered. 
First of all, there has been a change 
in the legal position of women. No 
Arab State has followed the example 
of Turkey and abolished the jurisdiction 
of Moslem law in such personal matters 
as marriage and divorce; but in some,

and notably in Egypt, the law has been 
given a new interpretation so as to 
bring it more intc line with modern 
conceptions. For example, two Egyp- 
tian laws, of 1920 and 1929, have made 
divorce less difficult, and have given 
women the right to obtain a divorce if 
their husbands ill-treat them, desert 
them or fail to maintain them. 
Again, the modern labour codes, like 
the Egyptian law of 1933 and the 
Lebanese of 1946, contain special regu- 
lations limiting the hours and laying 
down the conditions of women’s work. 
Syria was the first Arab State to give 
women the right to vote in elections; 
her example has so far been followed 
by Lebanon alone, but in Egypt there 
is a strong feminist movement, with 
Dorria Shafik as its glamorous leader, 
and it seems only a matter of time 
before women get the vote. 
Here once again we should remember 
that law is not the whole of life, nor 
always its faithful reflection. If we 
look beyond law to the life of the Arab 
countries as it is actually lived, we 
shall find a greater change. Perhaps 
the most important sign of it is the 
spread of women’s education. The 
pioneers here were the missionaries, 
Catholic and Protestant, who opened 
the first schools for girls a century ago. 
In the last thirty years modern govern- 
ments in the Arab States have set up 
their own systems of schools, for girls 
as well as boys. In Egypt, girls account 
for 35% of the school-population; 
and as the Unesco COURIER has re- 
cently told us, in the Arab refugee 
schools run by Unesco and UNRWA, 
489% of the pupils are girls. 
In some Arab countries schools of 
every type and at all levels are open 
to girls; and in those of the highest 
level, the colleges and universities, they 
study side-by-side with men. Un- 
obtrusively, without much publicity, 
the Egyptian State Universities, the 
French and American Universities in 
Beirut, the Syrian University of Da- 
mascus, the higher colleges in Baghdad 
have opened their doors to girls. 
The Director of the Higher Teachers’ 
Training college in Baghdad once 
explained how this was done. “We 
knew”, he said, “that to make an 
official decision and announce it 
publicly would arouse opposition. So 
we simply went round to a number of

men whose social position and respec- 
tability were beyond question, and 
asked them to send their daughters to 
our college. They agreed; their 
daughters came to our school, no 
announcement was made and there 
was no opposition”. 
As the numbers of educated women 
increase, the opportunities for them 
to work must be enlarged. Before 1914 
they could do little but adopt 
the honourable profession of school 
teacher. In the 1920's and 1930's 
however, girls began to enter offices 
as typists and secretaries, and nursing 
became respectable for girls of good 
family. More recently still they have 
begun to find their way into all the 
liberal professions. 
This spread of education has meant 
a change in social life, Educated 
women will not accept seclusion, and 
educated men want their wives to be 
companions. In all except the most 
backward regions polygamy has 
practically disappeared, and the veil is 
rapidly going. It is said that the first 
great Egyptian feminist, Huda Sharawi, 
solemnly cast her veil into the Medi- 
terranean as she returned to Egypt in 
1923 from a feminist congress in Rome; 
her symbolic action was quickly 
followed by her fellow-countrywomen, 
and within a generation the veil had 
disappeared in Egypt except for the 
lower middle-class, the most conser- 
vative of all classes. In most other 
Arab countries the process took longer 
to begin, but developed rapidly. 
It would be wrong to talk about 
women’s rights without asking what 
they have done with them once they 
have acquired them. In the Arab 
world as elsewhere, women feminists 
have demanded freedom not for their 
own sake alone, but to be able to play 
a part in the life of their peoples. In 
the vast changes of the Arab countries 
today, women play their full part. 
Visitors to Baghdad will know the 
beautiful building of the Red Crescent 
orphanage, created and maintained by 
a group of energetic Iraqi ladies; and 
in Egypt the hospitals and social insti- 
tutions of the Mubarrat Muhammad 
Ali bear witness to the sense of respon- 
sibility and organizing ability of the 
modern Egyptian women. The student 
Eric Schwab, United Nauons 
of Arabic literature and journalism 
will know such names as those of 
Malak Hifni Nasif, May Ziadeh and 
Julia Dimishqiya. 
Even in public life, the absence of 
the vote has not prevented women 
from taklng part in the national 
movement. Although women do not 
vet sit as deputies, they have created 
their own public organizations and held 
their own conferences, like the Arab 
Women's Conference held in Cairo at 
the beginning of 1945. 
Most important of all, a succession 
of distinguished women, beginning 
with the famous Princess Nazli of 
Egypt, has given political life an am- 
enity which it needs, and which only 
women could give; the salon, where 
politicians and men of letters and 
foreign visitors can meet and talk over 
the great issues of the day in an easy, 
civihized atmosphere.

### 69440: Are women the inferior sex? No, declares a scientist, women are superior to men

ARE WOMEN THE INFERIOR SEX? 
(Continued from page 12) 
The female is constitutionally stronger than the male, and 
what a good thing that this is so, for if men had to give birth 
to babies the human race would long have ceased to exist! 
Men are muscularly more powerful than women, but they are 
constitutionally weaker. Everywhere—with the ‘exception of 
certain parts of India, where food and sanitation is depres- 
singly bad—the expectation of life is higher for females than 
for males, and this holds true for the greater part of the 
animal kingdon. 
Women are also healthier than men-—if by health one 
means the capacity to deal with germs and illnesses, and they 
are more resistant to most diseases and recover from them 
more frequently than men.- 
There are certain disorders and diseases from which 
women suffer more frequently than men, such as gall-bladder 
disorders and cancer of the organs serving the functions of 
reproduction. Why women suffer more frequently from 
disorders of the gall-bladder we do not know, but the repro- 
ductive system cancers we do understand, and it will not be 
long before they are greatly reduced. But on the whole, men 
suffer more frequently from cancer than women, and from 
most other diseases, too. 
Girls are mentally two 
years ahead of boys 
oMEN are also better shock absorbers than men. They 
handle their emotions much more satisfactorily than 
men, and are hence more resilient than men. Every- 
where during the last war it was shown that women under 
the same siege and occupation, imprisonment and concen- 
tration camp conditions, withstood these conditions very 
much better than men. 
For every female stutterer there are five males. For every 
female colour-blind person there are sixteen males. Bleeders 
disease occurs almost exclusively in males. Almost anywhere, 
in any country, for every female suicide there are three male 
suicides. In almost all hereditary disorders males exceed 
females. 
Ah, yes, it may be remarked. But what about intelligence? 
Intelligence is the mark of the ability to solve problems, to 
make the best adjustment to the particular conditions one is 
called upon to meet. It has long been known to intelligence- 
testers and to school teachers, that on the average, boys are 
not as bright as girls. Even baby girls seem to be brighter 
than baby boys. Indeed, at five years of age, when most 
children enter school in the United States, the girls are 
mentally two years ahead of the boys, and what is more,

retain this advantage throughout their school years. If at 
college some girls do not do as 'well as boys, there are always 
others that do as well and often better, and we may suspect 
that many of the girls 'who don’t do as well are trimming 
their sails in order to enter another harbour than that of the 
professions, namely, the harbour of marriage and the family. 
For this is where the true genius of women lies. : 
I am convinced that women could achieve everything tha 
men have achieved in the arts and sciences did they but 
apply themselves in the numbers and in the kind of encour- 
aging environments ‘which men have enjoyed, but which 
women have seldom enjoyed in anything like such numbers 
as men. Women like Marie Curie, Liza Meitner, Gerty Cori, 
and Dorothy Needham, not to mention many others, have 
already shown what women can accomplish in the sciences— 
and but a pitifully small proportion of women have applied 
themselves to the sciences. It is the same for every other 
activity. Where women are afforded the opportunities they 
show that they can do at least as well as men, and a good 
deal of the time a great deal better! 
They must teach men 
how to be human 
HE intelligence that the world stands most in need of at 
the present time—indeed, at any time—is the intelli- 
gence with which women are most abundantly equip- 
ped. It is the kind of intelligence which ensures and 
conserves life and renders life more abundantly possible. Is 
this the kind of intelligence that men exhibit, or is it the 
kind that women exhibit ? 
It is to the advantage of everyone to afford women the 
opportunities to realize their potentialities to the fullest. 
Both men and women should learn to understand the full 
significance of the fact that women are largely responsible 
for caring for, and moulding the development of, the child. 
To bring up a child is the most important task that one 
human being can perform for another. Indeed, the future of 
mankind may depend upon the manner in which this task is 
carried out. This task is no “handicap”. It is the greatest 
privilege and responsibility ever placed upon the shoulders of 
any human being. The manner in which it has been 
performed has influenced the whole course of human destiny. 
he hand that rocks the cradle is, indeed, the hand that rules 
he world. 
If the world is not as it should be it is principally the doing 
of men who never gave women a chance to serve them in the 
manner they are best equipped to do—teaching men how to 
love their fellow men. It is the function of women to teach 
men how to be human. 
The best way in which men can help themselves is to help 
women realize themselves. In this way both sexes will come 
. for the first time fully into their own, and share complimen- 
tarily with each other what each has creatively to contribute 
to the making of a better and happier world.

### 69480: Five-star figures from the past: little-known artists from East and West

CHOPENHAUER’s definition of wo- 
man as a creature with a good 
head of hair but very little 
brain has probably made its author 
known to more people than all the 
rest of his philosophy put together. 
It is still remembered whereas 
Schopenhauer’s philosophy is half 
forgotten—and women have long 
since cut off much of their hair. 
In all countries and down the 
centuries men have been unsparing 
in their mordant opinions on the 
mothers of the human race. Soc- 
rates in ancient Greece, described 
woman as the source of all evil. 
“Her love”, he said “is more to be 
feared than the hatred of man”. 
And at just about the same period 
the Buddhists were even more 
categorical. “Woman is a creature 
who looks like an angel, but who is 
a devil at heart”, they declared. 
Now what was to be done with 
such a fundamentally bad nature except 
try to subdue it? As the innocent 
victims of these furies, men were well 
placed for the task—they made and 
enforced the laws. So down the years 
they wrote books, drew up laws and 
found ‘ways of keeping women in a 
continuing state of mental childishness. 
To convince ‘women that this was 
right was another matter. So men set 
down their arguments in books on 
education, and even a glance at these 
reveals such a wealth of unflattering 
remarks on womankind that it is 
difficult to know which to choose. A 
typical one taken from Orma Daigaku, 
a famous Japanese hook on education 
written in the 17th century, proclaims 
“such is the stupidity of woman that 
Cc ie 
‘Les feuilles’, a work by Seraphine de Senlis, a French 
she should be continuaily on guard 
against herself”. 
Women, however, were just as intent 
on escaping from this state of affairs 
as men were in maintaining it. As soon 
as tradition no longer systematically 
excluded them from civic, political and 
artistic life, they showed their capaci- 
ties as rulers (the queens and woman 
regents in Europe during the 16th cen- 
bury provide striking proof of this), 
writers and talented artists. Let us 
single out a few women—from different 
continents—who as writers and artists 
won honoured places in these fields of 
human achievement. 
There is hardly any need to mention 
the Greek poetess, Sappho, whose 
genius has already been so much ex- 
tolled. Such was her fame that her 
odes, translated into the language of 
the Pharaohs, have been unearthed by 
archaeologists in Egypt. Swin- 
burne described her as the 
greatest poet in the absolute 
sense of that term. 
Less well known is Ts’ai Yen 
who lived in China at the end 
of the Hun dynasty, a period 
which shone so brilliantly dur- 
ing the’ last centuries before 
the Christian era. Her father, 
Ts’al Yong, a high official, 
brought her up amid all the 
material and spiritual refine- 
ments of that period. She 
was widowed at a very early 
age, and then her life was 
completely disrupted at the 
end of the Second Century A.D. 
by the invasion of the Huns, 
who under the command of 
Attila, were to threaten the 
total destruction of Roman 
civilization. 
The Huns dragged her away 
with them beyond the Great 
Wall built for the defence of 
the Empire. For twelve years 
she was a slave, but during her 
captivity she wrote one of the 
most celebrated and moving 
works in Chinese poetry: 
“Eighteen measures sung to 
Gabrielle CABRINI is a French writer 
ond philologist and was formerly attached 
to the Cultural Affairs Department of the 
: CL. French Foreign Ministry. She has written 
charwoman turned painter, Her paintings are now several books, including La Résurrection des 
prized possessions of art galleries all over the world. Morts. 
Unesco Courter. — Nr 11. — 1955 
A 
the sound of the Hun's trumpet”. In 
it she captures the wild desolation of 
the barbarian camps, where every- 
thing was strange and foreign to this 
refined and captive woman: “I no lon- 
ger have anyone in the world except 
these unbridled hordes who force me 
to follow them to the ends of the 
earth. The road back is barred to me 
by mountain peaks crowned with 
clouds. There is only the swirling sand 
whipped up by the desert wind.” 
Nothing could calm Ts’al Yen’s des- 
pair. Everything about her masters 
irritated her; their savagery, their 
tents, their chariots, their endless 
herds, their food. Her hope had one 
lodestar: the huge Wall behind which 
lay the world that had once been hers. 
They gave her a husband: a warrior 
Hun. She hore him two children, 
whom she nurtured and loved, for 
though they were the children of a 
barbarian, they were nevertheless of 
her own flesh and blood; but there was 
no peace in her heart. 
Nor can my soul forget 
VENTUALLY the Emperor's envoys 
ransomed her; the war was over; 
Ts’al Yen could return to her own 
people. But then arose a conflict in 
her soul that was never to be stilled: 
On the one side, China; on the other, 
the childrernv—her children. 
After being torn with anguish by the 
memory of her native land, she was 
now tortured by the thought of her 
children "with the barbarians. “My 
children and myself at opposite ends of 
the world! Like the setting sun and 
the rising moon, watching each other 
from afar, and never drawing near to 
one another”. Her mother’s heart 
never again found peace, “for”, she 
said, “no river returns to its source, nor 
can my soul forget”. 
Whereas Ts’ai Yen's life was convulsed 
by war and its tragic effects, Murasaki- 
no-Shikibu, author of that masterpiece 
of classical Japanese literature, Genji 
Monogatar (The Story of Prince Genji), 
lived at the close of one of the most 
brilliant and civilized cen- s 
turies in the cultural his- (Cont'd on

### 69480: Five-star figures from the past: little-known artists from East and West

FIVE-STAR FIGURES 
(Continued) 
deeply Influenced by Chinese and 
Korean culture, but already steeped in 
a specifically Japanese atmosphere, was 
known as the Heian era, and saw the 
birth of Kyoto, “The city of peace”. 
It was about the year 1004 that 
Murasaki-no-Shikibu, widow of a high 
official of the Court and lady-in-wait- 
ing to the Empress, finished writing her 
long novel, which, in fifty-four chapters 
(the complete English translation runs 
to six large volumes), describes the life 
of two generations: that of Prince 
Genji, an imaginary character, and 
that of his son Kaoru. Although, dur- 
ing those times, many women writers 
were famed in Japan, and still are, 
Murasaki is outstanding because she 
started a new fashion by substituting 
for the legendary tale with its marvels, 
a romantic-realist novel, which reflect- 
. ed the life of that epoch. 
Like the characters of Proust, to 
which those of the Japanese writer’s 
great novel have often been compared, 
all her personages are imaginary, but 
they are so true to life that a whole 
civilization is reflected in them, and 
they remain an inexhaustible source for 
the study of an ultra-civilized society 
on the verge of decline. 
It is significant that the first two 
great psychological novels of Japan and 
of the West alike, should have been 
written by women: Murasaki’'s The 
Story of Prince Genji and Mme de La 
Fayette’s The Princess of Cleves. The 
first inaugurated, in an admirable 
literary style, the long psychological 
tale: the second created the concisely 
written psychological novel, in which 
there is not a superfluous word. Ma- 
dame de La Fayette, also lived in the 
centre of a refined and cultured world, 
where women were not excluded from 
the intellectual pursuits of men. She 
was the friend of the philosophers, 
poets and scientists of her age and 
lady-in-waiting to Louis XIV’s sister- 
in-law. 
The candid princess 
HE wrote a book which was, and still 
is, a perfect example of the style 
she created. The story is a simple 
one: the young and beautiful Princess 
of Cleves respects but does not love her 
husband; she loves, and is loved by, the 
Prince of Nemours. Out of loyalty, she 
tells her husband, thereby destroying 
his peace of mind for ever. Three cent 
uries have passed since The Princess of 
Cleves was ‘written; and the moralists 
still cannot agree whether the princess 
should or should not have told her 
husband... 
In the same century, while Mme de 
La Fayette was launching the psycholo- 
gical novel upon the Western World, 
there lived in New Spain—in Mexico— 
one of the most extraordinary figures, 
not only of Latin America but of the 
intellectual history of any age: Sister 
Juana Inés de la Cruz. 
490 
Born in 1651, when the Spanish Em- 
pire revived by the New World, was 
passing through its most brilliant 
period, Sister Juana, even from the age 
of four, burned with the desire to learn. 
The range of her knowledge—she 'was 
musician, poetess and mathematician— 
soon astonished and almost alarmed 
her friends, her teachers, and the 
scientists. She was familiar with every 
branch of study. She read, wrote, car- 
ried out scientific research and compos- 
ed poems which gave her a unique 
place not only in the literature of the 
colonial period but in the history of 
literature in general. 
But the world could not satisfy her 
longing for the absolute; she entered a 
convent, still consumed by her thirst 
for knowledge. Then, one day, she sold 
her library of four thousand volumes 
and her jewels, gave the proceeds away 
as alms, and spent the rest of her life 
caring for the victims of disease. She 
died at the age of forty-four, from a 
plague contracted at the sick-bed, just 
when Spanish Mexico was entering 
upon its decline. 
There are so many other illustrious 
women about whom one could speak 
for whenever women have lived in an 
atmosphere favourable to the develop- 
ment of intellectual talents, they have 
produced great works. Perhaps the 
best proof of this rule is offered by one 
of the exceptions to it—in this case a 
woman painter. 
Séraphine Louis, known as Séraphine 
de Senlis, was a charwoman. She was 
born in 1864, in the French village of 
Assy, and as a girl minded cattle. 
When still very young, she came to 
Senlis, the small, austere town in the 
Ile-de-France, whose name she was 
later to be given. Séraphine spent her 
time washing dishes, sweeping and 
polishing floors. At the end of the 
XI1Xth century life was far from easy 
for those who worked as hired labour. 
Séraphine lived a wretched existence. 
One day, she began to paint. She, who 
had never held anything but a broom 
in her hands, handled the paint-brush 
with ease. 
The charwoman-painter 
HE painted flowers, fruit—extraord- 
inary flowers and fruit. By a 
process which she kept secret, she 
mixed her colours in such a way as to 
give them a richness and brilliance 
which astound those who today visit 
modern art museums where her works 
are hung. Her neighbours, fellow- 
workers and employers made fun of 
her, but she shut herself in her room 
and painted. 
One day she decided to do nothing 
but paint, come what might. A Ger- 
man art critic, Wilhelm Uhde, who 
organized the first exhibition of Le 
Douanier Rousseau, discovered her, 
helped her and provided her with 
paints. Séraphine, although now an 
old woman, overcame with what 
amounted almost to a frenzy, the 
obstacles created by her ignorance. 
But one day her mind gave way. She 
was finally placed in an asylum at 
Clermont-Ferrand, where she died four 
years later (in 1934), destitute and 
forgotten by the world. Today, art 
galleries in all parts of the 'world are 
proud to possess a “Séraphine de 
Senlis”.

Letters to the Editor 
Sir, 
I want you to know how much I 
enjoy reading your magazine. During 
my work as an inspector of primary 
schools I shall show the Unesco COURIER 
to headmasters and headmistresses and 
get them to take out subscriptions for 
their schools. ‘Teachers will find it a 
rich, up-to-date source of information, 
sometimes amusing, often moving and 
always aptly illustrated. Older school- 
children, particularly, will learn much 
from it and find food for reflexion and 
comparison. The most recent issue, 
“Conquest of the Desert”, will undoubt- 
edly interest the majority of my staff. 
As an Esperantist I should like to see 
an edition of your magazine published 
in Esperanto since for nearly a year 
now the Universal Esperanto Asso- 
ciation has had consultative status with 
Unesco. While such an edition might 
be a little premature at present, don't 
you think that a résumé of the main 
articles printed in Esperanto would be 
welcomed in some of the countries 
which do not receive the Courier in 
their own national language? ‘This 
would further extend Unesco’s influence 
and prestige and encourage Esperantist 
associations which co-operate—as the 
Unesco General Conference at Monte- 
video recognized in December 1954—in 
spreading education, science and culture 
through their efforts to develop inter- 
national intellectual relations and 
draw together the peoples of the world.

Sir, 
The copy of the Unesco Courier No. 5, 
1955—Exploring the Oceans With 
Science—(Aug., 1955, U.S.A.) has so 
interested us that I hope never to miss 
it when it contains anything of interest 
to do with oceanography or general sea 
matters. 
J. N. Carruthers 
National Institute 
of Oceanography, 
Surrey, England. 
Sir, 
There is a social problem which 
should be widely known: the manufac- 
ture and sale of toys representing 
weapons or instruments of aggression. 
Shops are full of toy weapons of all 
kinds, and children use the toy pistols, 
rifles, tanks etc. their parents buy them 
to play at wars with their friends along 
the street, with “wounded” and “dead’’. 
If children learn indifference to the 
sorrows of others, they will never do 
anything to spare their fellows unhap- 
biness; they will on the contrary be 
callous and aggressive. They will rely 
on whatever means of attack they have 
at hand and will regard the impression 
which their toy weapons make as 
entitling them to impose their will. As 
time goes by, their attitude will grow 
more cynical as the power of their 
weapons increases, and they will feel 
superior to people who have had a more 
civilized upbringing. 
On the other hand, the child brought 
up In a healthy moral atmosphere of 
unselfish games, hobbies, and sport will 
grow into a well-balanced youth possess- 
ing the personality to find the path of 
duty and courage without the need of a 
military band to guide him,

No 6, 1955 issue (English edition) of 
the Unesco CourlErR—Twisted Images:

zine nor one so capable of interesting 
people with widely different tastes, 
Renée Galland

Sir, 
I get a great deal of pleasure from 
your magazine which is so full of dis- 
coveries and new facts. Among the 
issues which I found quite remarkable 
were those devoted to “The Last Fron- 
tiers of Civilization” and “Forgotten 
Shadows—the Birth of the Cinema.” 
- René de Berval 
Saigon, Viet-Nam., 
Sir, 
My thanks to the Unesco COURIER 
for introducing us to so many varied 
aspects of life on our planet, which 
retains its extraordinary diversity while 
growing ever smaller, The recent ar- 
ticle, “Indians with an Axe to Grind”, 
for example, vividly showed how an in- 
vention can disrupt a way fo life. The 
fact that men do not immediately adapt 
themselves to the new situation and 
even commit barbarous acts is a transi- 
tory thing. Mankind’'s entire history 
seems marked by such inventions—both 
material and intellectual—from making 
fire to splitting atoms, and between 
them the alphabet writing, printing, 
steam power and electricity, an inter- 
national language, Esperanto, aero- 
nautics, modern mathematics and a 
thousand and one other technical or 
cultural inventions—never one without 
the other. 
Today we are travelling more or less 
peacefully—that is, with varying degrees 
of savagery—towards a unification of 
mankind through a greater knowledge 
of matter and a better understanding 
of human solidarity. Within recent 
months, much more is being said in the 
daily press about ideas, which, only a 
few years ago, were voiced by only a 
few people. “Federalism” or even 
“Planetisation” are terms which seem 
to be becoming more generally used. 
There is evidence that a new form 
of humanism will spring from this state 
of things—a modern humanism of the 
“atomic age” or the “age of robots”. To 
Dr. William Perrenoud, of Neuchatel 
University. Switzerland, I think, goes 
the credit for clarifying what he calls 
“Géonism™ or new humanism. The 
UNEsco COURIER is undoubtedly helping 
men of goodwill to become conscious of 
this “Géonism". 
A. Albault 
Toulouse, France. 
Sir, 
I have received the first two numbers 
of the Unesco Courier and am very sa- 
tisfied with them. 
-.The effort to promote understanding 
between peoples is a significant feature 
of our time. Although it seems natural 
that we should not all have the same 
ideas, I welcome everything that raises 
man above prejudices of race or doc- 
trine and brings out those qualities that 
are common to all mankind. 
It Is true that there Is a long way to 
go before we achieve world-wide under- 
standing, and our material and intellec- 
tual advances are not always accom- 
panied by moral progress. 
Moreover there Is a serious and 
distressing fact that may well bring to 
nought the finest efforts and confirm 
the theory of man's essential wicked- 
ness, a fact which we either fear to 
denounce or prefer serenely to ignore: 
the world's unbalanced state is the 
inevitable result of desire to make 
profits. 
My aim in writing this letter is the 
social one of seeking to associate my- 
self with any endeavour whose aim is 
beneficient.

More BOOKS FOR 
ASIA: In 1950, UNESCO helped 
to open a model public library 
in New Delhi which, within a 
year of its opening had 2,300 
readers daily, more than three- 
quarters of whom had never 
used a library before. In five 
years it has lent over a million 
books. In October librarians 
and educators from 19 countries 
met in the library to work out

* PICKING GOOD FTI.MS 
One headache for parents — 
how to prevent chiwaren rom 
seeing the wrong types of 
films—may be removed 
following a recent UNESCO- 
sponsored meeting in Edin- 
burgh. Representatives of the 
film industry and organiza- 
tions concerned with child 
welfare agreed to set up an 
International Children's Film 
Centre, with assistance from 
Unesco. Due to open in 
1957, the Centre will act as 
a clearing house for infor- 
mation on films from all 
countries fit for children to 
see, Across the world in In- 
dia a Children’s Film Socie- 
ty has been set up to produce 
and distribute films for In- 
dian children. The Society 
will also try and weed out all 
films which could have a 
harmjul effect on young peo- 
ple. 
T. 1B. PROTECTION FOR 
8,000,000: Eight million children 
have been given anti-TB vacci- 
nations this year, according to 
the United Nations Children’s 
Fund (UNICEF), bringing the to- 
tal since 1948 to more than 50 
million, Children and mothers 
who have received direct aid 
through UNICEF's world-wide 
projects this year number no 
less than seventeen million. 
This is more than half-way to- 
wards this year’s target figure 
for giving assistance to 32 mil- 
lion mothers and children. For 
its world-wide anti-malaria 
campaign UNICEF's Executive 
Board has just allocated 
$ 2,400,000 — largest single sum 
allocated in the Fund's nine- 
year history—for assisting a 
five-year Mexican Government 
campaign. The plan aims to 
protect 17 million persons living 
in malaria~ridden areas.

Moscow - NEW YORK 
EXCHANGES : One hundred 
modern Russian paintings, se- 
lected in Moscow by the Direc- 
tor of the National Arts 
Foundation of New York, 
Dr. Carlton Smith, are to be 
exhibitea in the U.S.A. In re- 
turn the Foundation will send a 
similar number of contemporary 
American paintings to Moscow. 
Dr. Carlton Smith also invited 
the famous Obraztosov Puppet 
Theatre as well as Russian sing= 
ers and dancers to tour the 
United States. On benalf ot 
the Stanislawski Museum in 
Moscow, the National Arts 
Foundation is appealing for 
any letters and manuscripts of 
famous Russian theatre direc- 
tors which may exist in the Uni- 
ted States. These will be photo- 
copied and sent to Moscow. 
In exchange the Foundation has 
asked Moscow for a manuscript 
of one of Mussorgsky's works 
which will be produced by New 
York's Metropolitan Opera. 
* LOST HOMELANDS: By 
1952 nearly 29 million refu- 
gees had lost their home- 
lands and were faced with 
the problem of how to put 
down new rools. “Flight 
and Resettlement”, a recent- 
ly published UNESCO study, 
describes what has happened 
to these millions of people 
since the war, and what suc- 
cesses they have had start 
ing life afresh in new coun- 
tries. The study makes dra- 
matic reading. There is a 
detailed survey of the men- 
tal disorders suffered by re- 
fugees when trying to adjust 
themselves lo a new way of 
life. The tragedy of the 
fleeing refugees comes to life 
in passages like the follow= 
ing: “In ihe spring of 1945 
the roads of Germany and 
Austria were teeming with 
uprooted humanity. Amidst 
these moving masses chil- 
dren were wandering singly 
or in groups. They were in- 
distinguishable from the 
adults and they seemed moti- 
vated by the same uncontrol- 
lable desire to keep on mov- 
ing, to gel somewhere. 
When the process of sin- 
gling them oul got under 
way, it became apparent that 
thousands of children were 
completely on their own.” 
Ka LINGA PRIZE 
AWARD: Dr. August Pi Suner, 
Spanich physiologist and at 
present director of the Institute 
of Experimental Medicine at the 
University of Caracas, Vene- 
zuela, has been awarded the 
1955 Kalinga prize of £ 1,000 for 
his work in popularizing scien- 
tries. The Kalinga prize, award- 
ce in Spanish-speakine coun- 
ed annually by UNESCO, was 
established by Mr, B. ruunaik ul 
the Indian State of Orissa. Ka- 
linga was the name of the In- 
dian Empire conquered more 
than 2,000 years ago by King 
Asoka at such cost that he 
swore never to wage war again. 
Previous prize winners have 
included; Professor Louis de 
Broglie, of Paris, Dr. Julian 
Huxley, of London (Unesco’s 
first Director-General), and 
Mr. Waldemar Kaempffert 
science editor of the New York 
Times. 
* UNESCO ARTIST FEL- 
LOWSHIPS: Fourteen new 
fellowships for writers and 
artists (composers, painters, 
sculptors, engravers and ar- 
chitects) were recently esta- 
blished by UuUNEsco. These 
fellowships will last siz 
months and will provide a 
monthly allowance of bet- 
ween $200 and $300. UNESCO 
will also pay travel erpenses 
different countries. The Gift 
Coupon Scheme continues to 
grow. In early 1954 only 11 
countries participated as do- 
nors in the;programme. TO- 
day 18 are taking part and 
others are due lo join.

New U.N, STAMP DE- 
SIGNS: A panel of six artists, 
all from different countries, has 
been selected by the U.N. Postal 
Administration to design U.N. 
stamps for 1956. Countries re- 
presented on the panel are Aus- 
tralia, France, Israel, Mexico, 
the U. K. and the US.A. At

GRAMMES: Twenly-three 
women radio broadcasters 
jrom 11 different countries 
recently met in Unesco 
House, Paris, to exchange 
ideas on the content of radio 
programmes for women, and 
on the suitability of certain 
subjects for broadcasting on 
sound radio or TV. They 
agreed that science should 
play a more important part 
in women’s programmes. 
U NexPLORED OCEANS: 
Exploring uncharted oceans and 
investigating the mysteries of 
the sea were discussed at three 
meetings held in Tokyo recently 
under the the auspices of 
Unesco. One of the major 
subjects discussed was the help 
Unesco could give research 
workers in the vast field of 
oceanography where interna- 
tional co-operation is indispen- 
sable. Exploration of the 
world’s oceans is still far from 
complete and an immense ex- 
panse of the Indian Ocean, 
lying mainly between the Equa- 
tor and Latitude 40 South, is 
still virtually unknown territory.
