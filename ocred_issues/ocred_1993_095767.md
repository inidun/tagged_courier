### 95768: Michel Serres talks to François-Bernard Huyghe

ENTERYIEW 
MICHEL SERRES 
talks to 
Francois-Bernard Huyghe 
  
Michel Serres of the Académie Francaise is an educator and 
philosopher whose interests range from science and literature to 
painting and environmental issues and whose self-proclaimed purpose 
is to establish “the link between the sciences, law and religion”, He 
believes strongly that the philosopher should play a part in the life of 
the community and is a member of Unesco’s Ad hoc Forum of 
Reflection, which is seeking to strengthen worldwide intellectual co- 
operation in identifying and responding to the new challenges facing 
humanity. He is the author of some twenty books including Le Contrat 
naturel (1990) and Le Tiers-Instruit (1991). His most recent works are 
Eclaircissements (Editions Francois Bourin, Paris, 1992), a book of 
conversations with Bruno Latour, and La Légende des Anges 
(Flammarion, Paris, 1993). 
 
BM One of your books is entitled Le con- 
trat naturel (The Natural Contract). Does 
this mean man can make a contract with 
Mother Nature? 
—Mother Nature does not appear in my 
book. What I describe is a new shift, from 
earth with a small “e”, denoting earth as 
one of the elements or the earth of farming, 
to Earth with a capital “E”, meaning the 
planet, and hence a shift from a local per- 
ception to a global conception. We have FRANGOIS-BERNARD HUYGHE toa 
been witnessing the emergence of such a is a French writer and journalist. 
global conception, from the technological, 
human and scientific points of view, for 
the past twenty years, which is why I 
examine both meanings of the word 
“earth” and hardly ever use the word 
“Nature”. 
This idea of a new globality is perhaps 
best symbolized by a photograph taken 
from space, which arouses a feeling that just 
about everyone who has seen it must have 
shared. It shows the whole planet as seen 
by a human eye. This new perception is an 
event in the history of mankind. Owing to 
this globalization of the way the Earth as 
an object—the planet—is perceived, and by 
a kind of recoil effect, the unity of 
humanity is being gradually constructed. 
Societies can only come into being if they 
have an object in common; this object, the 
globalized Earth, is new, and new bonds are 
thus being established between humanity 
and the planet. 
The “natural contract” (which has 
echoes of Rousseau’s 
applies to this emerging bond. The idea of 
standing in a legal relationship with the 
social contract”) 
entire planet was foreign to previous gen- 
erations, but just as human societies cannot 
be conceived of without the social con- 
tract, the construction of the globality and 
unity of the hunian race cannot be con- 
ceived of without the idea of a natural con- 
tract. The Enlightenment philosophers had

already worked out a concept of the human 
Universal and natural law, but no-one 
before our times could have imagined this 
construction of the global. The natural 
contract is thus not a metaphor to describe 
our relationship with the Earth, but a full- 
blown philosophical concept. 
BM Does it not relate back to to the dis- 
covery of laws—the laws governing our 
survival, for example? 
—No law, in the legal world itself or in the 
philosophy of law, comes into being unless 
it is preceded by a contract. Contracts are 
a prerequisite for all laws. But the same 
word is used to denote laws in the physical 
sciences and the laws we humans enact, 
and until now these two sets did not inter- 
sect. The natural contract establishes a rela- 
tionship between the exact and the human 
sciences, between the two kinds of laws. 
Do you know of a single philosopher 
worthy of the name who has not at some 
time been forced to think anew about sci- 
ence and the law, and about the relationship 
between the two kinds of laws that govern 
them? The whole problem of Western phi- 
losophy resides in this relationship or 
linkage. 
The philosopher’s job is to describe 
the conditions that have to be met in order 
for laws to be made, not to describe the 
content of those laws. It is to think about 
the nature of the bonds on which duties are 
grounded. In the case of the social con- 
tract, the bonds are between human beings 
only, while physical laws relate exclusively 
to links between objects. What is the rela- 
tionship between these two kinds of bond? 
A link must be forged between 
humanity, now tn the process of becoming 
one, and this new object, planet Earth. 
This relationship, which entails new duties, 
is what I call the natural contract. We can 
discuss the duties when cases come to 
court. We have already seen lawsuits 
involving the users of a national park and 
the park itself—which thus becomes a legal 
entity possessing rights. As cases like these 
are tried, and judicial precedents are set, the 
duties involved will gradually be estab- 
lished. The law did not cover these areas. It 
therefore has to be thought through, first 
in philosophical terms, then in legal and, 
lastly, political terms. 
BW Should the Earth be viewed as a “sub- 
ject”, an entity possessing rights? 
—That is the main problem facing the 
philosopher. How can an object become a

## [Page 6](095767engo.pdf#page=6) 0

### 95768: Michel Serres talks to François-Bernard Huyghe

What steps can be taken against the development of a universal culture 
that only expresses a single force? 
subject? All advances in law have consisted 
of taking things that had been objects and 
turning them into subjects. Slaves, who 
were objects, became subjects before the 
law, and the same is happening with chil- 
dren and embryos. Every time law makes 
progress, it turns objects into subjects in 
this way. The planet was an object and I am 
suggesting it be made a subject. This inno- 
vation has met with a certain amount of 
resistance, but in philosophy one must 
learn to challenge generally accepted ideas 
and be ready to accept that an issue has 
taken on a new form. 
WM Have atomic weapons helped the idea 
of globality to emerge? 
—The shift from the local to the global 
did indeed begin some time ago. The 
atomic bomb has been what I have called 
a “world object”, in other words a tech- 
nological object one of whose dimensions 
is world-wide in scale. It was one step on 
the road from the local to the global. Today 
we have the means to assess this relation- 
ship between the local and the global and 
express 1t in equations. Climatological 
models are another example. 
BW Cross-fertilization is another of your 
concepts. 
—Education today produces scientists 
who, generally speaking, are ignorant out- 
side their own fields, and cultured people 
who know nothing about science. Most 
of today’s problems stem from the separa- 
tion between these two groups. Both have 
become decision-makers but they no 
longer understand each other. The latter 
enact human laws without bearing in mind 
the existence of objects and of science, 
while the former discover and apply nat- 
ural laws without taking human beings 
into account, This is where I first used the 
idea of cross-fertilization—imagine, as 
Plato did, a sociologist familiar with natural 
science or a politician well versed in 
physics. The idea of cross-fertilization 
means first of all devising an education 
system that does not separate the exact 
sciences and the humanities in a foolish, 
dangerous way. 
It then occurred to me that cross-fertil- 
ization was the global concept underlying all 
learning processes. If you start to learn 
physics, your life and your world are going 
to change. You become crossbred by the 
very fact of learning, That's why I started my 
book on education (Le Tiers-Instruit) with 
a portrait, describing how learned to write 
with my right hand even though I was left- 
handed. Left- or right-handed people will 
always be physically and intellectually hemi- 
plegic—half their body is paralysed. If you 
know how to use both hands your body is 
whole. The crossbreed I'm talking about is 
this monster—a human being—who can 
use his or her right and left hands at the 
same time, reborn at the point where the 
two sides meet. 
We experience this a little when we 
learn to speak another language. It is as if 
a second person were entering us to beget 
a third, by cross-fertilization. The hybrid 
offspring is what I call the tiers-instruit, the 
“educated third party”. oo 
WM Traditionally, culture is viewed as 
something that makes an individual 
“blossom”. Is there a relationship between 
your own idea of culture and this long- 
established metaphor? 
—I'm not really fond of the word “culture” 
which, like “nature”, is one of those words 
that always cause aguments. But to con- 
tinue with the metaphor let’s say that cross- 
breeding is similar to a graft. When some- 
thing is learned, a third person is produced 
from the rootstock into which the scion is 
inserted. 
BW Are you advocating a form of learning 
that would go on making us forever 
someone else, helping us each to become, in 
our own way, the “educated third person” 
that we unknowingly carry around inside 
usé 
—We must accept and acknowledge this 
“someone else”, who keeps company with 
us and takes us to meet a second person. 
The moment you acknowledge otherness, 
learning has this modifying effect. It is not 
a matter of developing a philosophy of the 
Other. The Other is the second person. 
We are talking about the educated third 
person begotten by the encounter between 
the self and the other.

teaching that have never served any pur- 
pose other than to enable inspectors to 
terrorize teachers. No amount of teacher 
training can provide you with specific 
details about the individual pupils in such- 
and-such a class at such-and-such a time of 
day, and so the more specific the textbook, 
the more tllusory it is. 
As far as teaching is concerned, giving 
practical instructions—advising teachers 
to get their pupils to read the newspapers, 
for instance—often amounts to giving 
abstract instructions. The reality consists of 
particular cases and particular types of 
pupil. Generally speaking, educational 
theory is middle-of-the-road, neither spe- 
cific nor abstract. It is much less useful 
than it claims to be or is thought to be. 
The issue I am interested in 1s, what are the 
“necessary conditions for learning? 
BM You are a member of a UNESCO Forum

which is concerned with getting to grips 
with specifics and recommending solu- 
tions, 
—In Le contrat naturel I take note of 
something that happened, perhaps, after 
the founding of UNESCO: the construc- 
tion of a human unity that, for many rea- 
sons, obj ective reasons in particular, could 
probably not have been foreseen in the 
late 1940s. The specific advice I give the 
Forum will take this rise of the global into 
account. 
We are currently witnessing an irre- 
sistibly growing trend towards the global. 
Unfortunately this trend is increasingly 
monopolized by the most powerful, whose 
might is right. That which is universal is 
warped when it is taken over by a single 
power, and we are increasingly under the 
sway of a single culture. 
What specific steps can be taken against 
the development of a universal culture that 
only expresses a single force? That is the 
question. 
  
M The media have a tendency to look 
upon philosophers as oracles, asking them 
for their ideas about how to save the world 
and their views on all kinds of current 
events. What do you feel about this? 
—It’s true that the media ask philosophers 
all sorts of questions on a host of topics. Per- 
sonally, I never answer such questions 
because I don’t think my ideas on all kinds 
of topics are necessarily useful. I only 
answer questions about topics dealt within 
my books or about things like the Forum 
you mentioned. In all other cases I keep 
out of the media because my mind is not all- 
embracing, Furthermore, I never engage in 
polemics. Polemics is the enemy of every 
form of invention. Those who do not invent 
have no right to be considered as intellec- 
tuals or philosophers. Polemics is an unmit- 
igated obstacle to the invention of concepts. 
Philosophers are not “competent” in 
the sense of being experts, but they havea 
very specific task, which 1s to produce 
ideas. I would rather produce in my field 
and refuse to answer questions outside it. 
I'd never write a book attacking another 
book. On the contrary, if I see someone 
come up with a new concept I'm as happy 
aboutitas if I had thought it up myself. A 
new concept 1s something very rare and 
very fragile. It must be protected like a 
newborn child. It will bear fruit later, per- 
haps in fifty years. |

ITH the collapse of the Berlin Wall, the ideological polarization in which intel- 
lectual life had been mired during much of this century came to an end. Ideologies 
are dead; they have been replaced by a globalism that brings with it new hopes 
but also new dangers. More diffuse polarities are emerging and spreading along ethnic, reli- 
gious, racial and regional fault lines. Above all there is the great divide that tragically iso- 
lates the privileged inhabitants of the prosperous, powerful North from the rejected 
masses of the South. 
Intellectuals of every standpoint are well placed to join forces and reflect upon these 
promises and dangers—as long as they can find a minimum of common ground from which 
to expose the delusions of nationalism on the one hand and the snares of totalitarianism 
on the other. In short, as long as they speak a common language. 
Earlier this year forty writers and artists from all over the world gathered at UNESCO 
Headquarters in Paris to discuss these issues. The meeting was organized on the initiative 
of the French journalist Jean Daniel, the French political theorist Régis Debray, UNESCO 
Courier Director Bahgat Elnadi and Editor-in-Chief Adel Rifaat. It was sponsored by La 
Repubblica (Italy), O Estado de Sdo Paulo (Brazil), The Los Angeles Times (United States), 
Le Nouvel Observateur (France), El Pais (Spain) and the UNESCO Courier. The event was 
envisaged as the first of a series of “Meetings of Intellectuals and Creators for a Single World” 
which will take place annually to discuss a given topic free from all political and commercial 
pressures. This year’s theme was, “Can North and South share the same idea of progress?”. 
On the following pages we publish excerpts from some of the oral and written contri- 
butions to the meeting, which gave rise to a fruitful exchange of ideas—not least on a fun- 
damental question of terminology, the meaning and implications of the ambivalent con- 
cept of progress. 
Progress can be seen as a myth of industrial modernity, an emanation of the Judaeo-Chris- 
tian tradition which has since the Enlightenment been treated almost as though it were a 
secular version of the concept of Providence. During the nineteenth century it spread in 
the wake of Western expansion. In all cultures and in all parts of the world, progress could 
be clearly measured in the fields of science and technology but had little or no meaning in 
art, religion and politics. Those who believed it would bring about international peace, social 
harmony, the end of religious superstitions and ethnic conflict, not to mention the stan- 
dardization of cultures, have continually seen their predictions come to nothing. 
For forty years the myth of progress has survived in its modern version, development, 
and has contributed to the establishment, under the rule of market forces, of a world eco- 
nomic system encompassing part of the peoples of the South, but excluding the vast 
majority. It has also had destructive and possibly irreversible effects on the environment. 
Perhaps the very perception of a North-South dichotomy is itself an offshoot of the myth 
of modernity. The geographical and chronological divisions between North and South have 
become blurred now that poverty and destitution have become part of the urban landscape 
north of the equator, and in all countries, rich and poor, new classes are living like their coun- 
terparts in London, Paris and New York. 
The French writer Julien Benda defined intellectuals as a group which should be con- 
cerned with universal issues. Their role in the face of today’s chaotic, divisive realities should 
be to free themselves from manichaean, reductionist thinking in order to identify the values 
common to people everywhere. 
Their task is not to promise a paradise on Earth, but to encourage respect for others and 
for their beliefs. It is not to impose an ideal world, but to help exorcize what is worst in 
the present one—xenophobia, intolerance and exclusion. |

Progress to what? 
There is currently widespread disenchantment with the idea of progress, 
especially pernaps in those societies in which it has been the motor of 
economic growth and technological change. 
Should it be scrapped as the dubious legacy of an outworn ideology, 
or are there circumstances in which it is still valid?

CCORDING to an old maxim, “Truth is one 
A and error manifold”. Strictly from the point 
of view of knowledge, it would be regret- 
table if North and South went their different 
ways. Both of them would do better to try to 
arrive at a correct and, therefore, shared under- 
standing of progress, the characteristic myth of 
the carly industrial age. Whether the idea of 
“progress” is an elaborate figment of the imagi- 
nation or a conventional but illusory represen- 
tation of reality, it is eminently emblematic of 
what used to be called “ideology”. 
The illusion comes from confusing two time- 
schemes, the cumulative time of “scientific and 
technological development”, which is linear and 
marked by constant innovation, and repetitive 
time, which belongs to the world of politics and 
symbols. In the former time-scheme, ever more 
efficient solutions are found to quantifiable prob- 
lems. In the latter, cach generation discovers, and 
immediately forgets, that certain problems will 
never be solved. 
Human groups have often adopted a less flex- 
ible language or a cruder religion, or exchanged 
democracy for dictatorship, but they have never 
been known to go back from the plough to the 
hoe, from wheels to sticks, or from aircraft to hot- 
air balloons. Just as living things do not regress

own momentum. This trend can be found 
throughout history and all over the world, inde- 
pendent of ethnic factors. The relationship 
between people and things is governed by a pre- 
dictable, though open-ended and non-program- 
mable, logic of progress. 
Relationships between human beings clearly 
obey other laws. The difference between “savage” 
and “civilized” peoples has some discernible 
meaning in the history of technology, but is 
meaningless in the history of art, religions, lan- 
guages or forms of authority. Our command of 
energy sources has increased a thousandfold since 
the beginning of our era, but Martin Luther King 
1s not a thousand times greater a moral authority 
than Jesus Christ. The computer represents an 
advance on the abacus, but Andy Warhol is not 
superior to Titian, nor is Husserl’s philosophy 
more “profound” than Plato’s. The notion of 
progress 1s without meaning in the symbolic, 
intellectual, emotional or psychological realms. It 
would be easy to show that it is equally mean- 
ingless in the realm of politics—the wars of the 
twentieth century have been more brutal and 
bloody than those of the nineteenth, which were 
already much deadlier than those of the eigh- 
teenth, and so on. In relation to the technological 
and scientific ways and means of dealing with 
objects—or of human beings as objects, in the 
field of medicine—there is an objective and ver-

ifiable “before” and “after”. In the forms of man’s 
domination over man, the only “before and after” 
is purely subjective, and reversible. 
Standard technology, 
specific cultures 
The noble advocates of progress who for two 
centuries have lumped together technological 
and political time, have been systematically 
wrong in their forecasts. They predicted not 
only that the railways would bring about world 
peace and that electricity would lead to social 
harmony and public education to the end of 
religious superstitions, but also that the stan- 
dardization of technical objects would result in 
that of cultures and religions. The emergence of 
a human mega-race or, more accurately, the 
superseding of the ethnically-based structuring 
of human communities, was supposed to go 
hand-in-hand with the emergence of the pro- 
ductive mega-system, or globalized industrial 
production system. However, far from dis- 
solving in a converging, globalized, fast- 
changing technological environment, ethnic 
environments, territorially based and slow to 
change, are turning inward, becoming more 
intransigent, and proliferating, The globalization 
trend is towards balkanization, each stage in 
the movement towards technological and eco- 
nomic unity reactivating ethnic and cultural 
diversity at a new level. The increasingly easy 
flow of goods and information is paralleled by 
an obsessive territorial neurosis. In a village that 
is increasingly global and chauvinistic, feverish 
migratory movements have as their counter- 
part a crisis-level siege mentality. 
It is thus easy to imagine a principle of con- 
stancy at work in society, similar to the prin- 
ciple of stability posited for the psyche by 
Freudian metapsychology, a constant relationship 
between the factors of so-called progress and so- 
called regression. The history of Pumanity 1 is 
recorded in a double-entry ledger. Each imbalance 
brought about by a technological advance causes 
an “ethnic” rebalancing, so that the present see- 
sawing between the trend towards world-wide 
uniformity and demands for the right to be dif- 
ferent, between the “rational” and the “national”, 
between the economic imperative and religious 
needs—this whole dynamic of disequilibrium 
could be interpreted as a zero-sum game, or 
rather as an equation with variable but corre- 
lated values. This is pure speculation, of course. 
In any case, let us admire the infinite superi- 
ority of the wisdom of Greek mythology over 
our present-day economic myths. In the myth of 
Protagoras, Zeus grants technical skills, or zechne, 
to the human race through Prometheus butis glad 
to have kept the “art of administering public 
life”, or wisdom, to himself, out of man’s reach. 
The Enlightenment philosophers forgot this little 
reservation, 
The verifiable fact of scientific and techno- 
logical progress became a myth by being improp- 
erly transposed to the symbolic and political 
realms, a transposition stemming from the late 
encounter between religious messianism and

industrial machinism, between a Judaco-Chris- 
tian cultural tradition (progress as a sccularized 
form of Providence) and the initial industrial and 
economic take-off of European societies. Out 
of the chemical reaction between them came a 
precipitate that settled out in France and England 
at the end of the Age of Enlightenment, philo- 
sophically linked with the names of Turgot, Con- 
dorcet and Comte. The nineteenth century saw 
the new religion spread throughout the world, in 
step with Western expansion, which of course was 
at the same time military, political, cconomic and 
mythological.

geneity. In north and south, cast and west,

variations in speed are not enough to change that 
direction or the order of events. In this view of the 
world, the continents may not be in the same 
time zone, but they all have the same watch and the 
same calendar. The East must necessarily make up 
lost time and join the West on its march—a pos- 
tulate common to both market economists and 
Marxists. The ideologies of progress therefore 
predate ethnography, anthropology, positivism 
and, « fortiori, the eulogizing of differences. 
The choice between tradition and progress, 
the closed and the open, may be a retrograde 
legacy of nineteenth-century Europe. It is perhaps

gadgetry but by a wooden Shinto temple. The 
super-modern East is forging ahead of the modern 
West because, in its symbolic structures, it has 
already reached the stage of pine, while we are still 
at that of fibrocement. 
Nothing could be more pointless than, for 
example, the rhetorical antithesis between “nation- 
alism” and “cosmopolitanism”. It has been the 
global tribes, formidably rooted in their indigenous 
identities and at the same time networking all 
over the planet—the Arabs of the Middle Ages, the 
Jews of the Renaissance and the Enlightenment 
and the British of the Industrial Revolution— 
who have always moved civilization forward. 
Globally positive 
The myth of progress continues to operate, in a 
latent or residual way in the North, in a driving 
and propulsive manner in the South. An idea 
that has been to a greater or lesser extent mythol- 
ogized but is accepted by all becomes an objec- 
tive social reality, to be treated as such, especially 
since, in the Third World in particular, it still 
plays a “globally positive” role. Just as contempt 
for money is a privilege of the rich, scepticism 
with regard to progress is the prerogative of those 
who have historically benefitted from it. Political 
redemption through technological progress is a 
false idea that the poor and oppressed truly need 
to cling to in order to face up to modernity and 
its gruesome spectacle of injustices without 
sinking into despair or delinquency. 
The problem is that the affluent West no 
longer really believes in its ideals and myths of 
redemption. After the collapse of socialism, we in 
the North no longer look forward to a future 
where a clean break with the past can improve our 
lot. What we sce ahead are not radical changes to 
be carried out but improvements to be made 
within the framework of the rational, democ- 
ratic state. This is called “managing”. The hope 
principle is defunct at its home base. Can it, 
should it be extinguished worldwide? 
Its extinction would put a cheap price on 
human suffering. Doubling average life 
expectancy in the span of a century, wiping out 
diseases, lowering illiteracy rates and boosting 
potential per capita energy consumption are ele- 
vating, worthy tasks that, though they do not

hold the key to long-term human happiness or 
usher in the classless society, at least have the 
enormous merit of narrowing the gap between 
the two hemispheres. 
In the short run, it is clear that North and 
South are instinctively nursing two opposing 
attitudes towards History and hence towards 
progress. Orphaned by the present, the “South”, 
unable to take refuge in a past that only evokes 
worse conditions, turns its eyes towards the 
future, which is identified with a better life. 
Orphaned by the future, the North has refo- 
cused on its present, which it no longer sees by the 
light of Utopia but by that of the past, glorifying 
memory above all other civic virtues. Europe is 
passionately building up its archives, recording 
everything, creating museums of all kinds and 
exulting in commemorations and anniversaries. 
Yesterday’ s forward-looking and messianic out- 
look has been replaced by a backward-looking or 
antiquarian view of history, in which we are no 
longer active participants but nostalgic, wistful 
onlookers. Nature was once a “conservative” 
value opposed to History. Ecology, the only new 
or rising political movement, mythologizes nature 
to rally support. Back to the land, to local com- 
munities, traditions and threatened ways of life is 
the order of the day. Even the idea of the 
Republic, as the author of these lines upholds it 
in the French context, can be interpreted as a 
form of “return to the past” in the face of the 
communalist and mercantile tendencies of the 
now dominant, devastating Anglo-Saxon model 
of democracy. “Preserving” is once again a pos- 
itive, even chic if not avant-garde term. It seems 
as if, faith in the future having taken refuge among 
the poorest inhabitants of the planet, the rich are 
getting used to seeing progress not as the pursuit 
of a better world but, to quote Milan Kundera, as 
  
“the forerunner of the worst”, and they have 
good reasons to do so. 
The danger lies in the advantage thus gained 
by nihilism and cynicism. If progress is dead, 
then anything goes. The law that says “the winner 
takes all” is the law of a self-sufficient present 
where making money fast and in any way pos- 
sible becomes the individuals supreme ideal. 
The solution doubtless lies not in creating 
yetanother utopia or a new secular messianism, 
but perhaps in waging a series of specific, single- 
minded, ethically-based struggles, if not to achieve 
the ideal best, then at least to steer clear of the real 
worst. And today the worst seems to us to be the 
very dilemma that the course of events would like 
to lock us into: either, in the name of modernity, 
to transform the planet i nto a supermarket, sub- 
jecting all public and private human activity to the 
law of supply and demand; or, in the name of 
identity, to shut ourselves off in vindictive fan- 
tasies of a return to some lost purity, to the exclu- 
sion of those who are different from ourselves, 
and to the integrity of an ideology, community or 
religious belief. To exchange the technocratic 
myth that technological progress is all it takes to 
solve political and cultural problems, for the 
ideocratic frenzy that claims a fine-sounding 
moral norm can take the place of economic and 
technological solutions, would simply be to 
exchange a caricature from the North for a cari- 
cature from the South. Another kind of public life 
could be reinvented in the middle ground 
between the politics of the dollar and the various 
politics of God, that would be worthy of the 
Enlightenment philosophers but without their 
illusions, and that would combine the pessimism 
of intelligence with the optimism of the will. The 
lie must, in short, be given to all those who believe 
that every criticism of the myth of progress is nec- 
essarily reactionary.

Metaphors should be made at home 
= by Daniel |. Boorstin £5 
HE Western idea of progress, widespread 
since the eighteenth century, had its roots 
in two characteristically Western ideas and 
experiences. First, the Judaeo-Christian belief in 
a Creator God who had made the world 1rew; and 
second, the rise of experimental science and the 
work of Galileo, Harvey, Newton and others, 
who documented man’s increasing ability to 
know and control the world. These ideas and 
experiences were at odds with the cyclical views 
of history presumed by other world-religions, 
and even in the classical Greek heritage. If God 
could make the world ex nihilo, and man shared 
the powers of that God, then making the new was 
not only possible for man, it revealed his spark of 
divinity. 
The Western enthusiasm for the natural sci- 
ences was contagious, inspiring social sciences 
which aimed to make new and better institu- 
tions. As scientific knowledge accumulated in 
the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, it was 
encouraged and shared by the European com- 
munity, with an increasing faith in its utopian 
possibilities. It was this faith which stirred the

14 
beliefs of Jefferson and the American revolu- 
tionaries in the possibility of creating a new 
nation in a New World, pursuing the idea of 
human equality and rights to life, liberty, and 
the pursuit of happiness. It also inspired the 
beliefs of the French revolutionaries of 1789 in 
their power to clean out the cobwebs of the Old 
Regime, and make a new Republic dedicated to 
Liberty, Equality, Fraternity and the rule of 
Reason. The spectacular successes of European 
industry in the nineteenth century—the creation 
of steam power and then electrical power, along 
with the epochal insights of Adam Smith, 
Auguste Comte, Charles Darwin, Karl Marx and 
others, with improvement of transportation, the 
growth of cities and the increase of wealth— 
reinforced the hope (in Tennyson’s words) that it 
would be possible to “Let the great world spin 
forever down the ringing grooves of change.” 
Can such an idea, that grew from distinc- 
tively Western memory, experience, and imagi- 
nation, take root and flourish elsewhere? Can it 
be credible in parts of the world that do not share 
the Judaeo-Christian belief in a Creator God, a 
God of Novelty, and in a Creator Man, Apostle 
of Novelty? Can the idea of progress survive in 
societies that lack the melodramatic Western tri- 
umphs of science and technology, that lack the 
rising standards of living, and have not succeeded 
in making viable societies by newly-drawn con- 
stitutions? Can peoples be expected to share the 
intellectual product when they had not shared the 
processes from which it came? 
More basic, even, than the idea of progress in 
Western thought is the notion of which Blaise 
Pascal was the eloquent spokesman. “Man is but 
areed, the weakest in nature, but he is a thinking 
reed.” And, though the universe destroy man, 
man is still nobler, for he is aware of the advan- 
tage the universe has over him. Man’s greatness, 
then, is in his consciousness, his awareness of 
his place in the world, of what the world holds 
and might hold for him, and what he might hold 
for the world. That consciousness has led man in 
the West to believe in progress. But where will 
that consciousness properly lead men who have 
lived in drastically different circumstances, with 
contrasting histories? While the idea of progress 
may be a suitable and suggestive metaphor for 
Western history, elsewhere, among peoples who 
have no similar historical roots, it may express 
nothing more than a bitter utopian irony. 
Finally, how does it benefit the world when 
people freeze the metaphors of alien history into 
ideology? For ideology itself is a contradiction 
and denial of man’s endless powers of novelty and 
change which are suggested by the very idea of 
progress. Would we not, perhaps, profit more 
from the diversity of human experience if we 
“encouraged all peoples to make their own 
metaphors? |

Adventures of Baron 
Miinchhausen (1786) shows 
Baron de Crac reaching for 
the Moon. 
¢ AN North and South share the same 
idea of progress?” This is a provoca- 
tive question which I must answer yes 
“and no. On one level, everybody has the same 
basic needs—adequate food, shelter, health care 
and a sense of dignity. The “South”, in its 
metaphorical meaning of the poorest societies, 
is still a long way from reaching these stan- 
dards. Moving towards them would certainly be 
seen as “progress” both by themselves and by 
those already much better off. But even in flat 
material and physical terms, the idea is not so 
simple. The population explosion in global terms 
is the result of a dramatic reduction in mor- 
tality rates and an increase in life expectancy. 
Women aren’t having more babies than a century 
ago in poor societies, but a lot more babies are 
reaching adulthood thanks to scientific and 
technological advances, which move geomet- 
rically while economic development moves far 
more slowly. 
Poverty increases because there are a lot 
more people, and in some cases it increases 
absolutely because of the consequent strain on 
resources—desertification (in the Sahel, for 
example), deforestation, soil erosion and so on. 
The fact that more people stay alive may be 
considered progress, but the fact that they live 
so badly, sometimes worse than their ancestors, 
cannot be. The prosperous tend to have far 
fewer children, who live better. Is that progress? 
Yes, they feel it is. So this idea of material 
improvement 1s shared. 15

### 95772: Relative values

Yet, still in strictly material terms, above the 
level of absolute misery, poverty and progress 
are felt as relative conditions and inequality 
measured by immediate surroundings can seem 
more important. The rioters in South Central 
Los Angeles last year certainly consider them- 
selves poor. They live in a city which flaunts 
wealth and luxury, they watch TV which not 
only urges ever more consumption but takes 
them inside the homes of the well-to-do for a 
vicarious taste of ease and comfort. They them- 
selves are enormously better off than many 
hundreds of millions in Africa, Latin America 
and Asia, but they do not make such a compar- 
ison. Why should they? They live in a society 
which preaches democracy, equity and justice, 
and they feel it has failed to deliver to them. Is 
this progress? Perhaps, in the sense that they do 
not simply accept their lot in resignation but 
look for one way or another to improve it, 
making their demands heard. This idea of 
progress is probably also shared. 
A challenge to the will of God 
But even in those societies which do believe in 
progress, at least as possible, if no longer 
  
inevitable, in the Victorian tenet, there is no 
longer such conviction about what it really is. 
Some cultures reject the whole idea as hubris, an 
unworthy challenge to the will of God. There is 
considerable confusion between “moderniza- 
tion” and “progress”. Are they synonymous, 
opposites, or simply different? All can be argued, 
though the urge to modernize making use of sci- 
ence and technology, economic development, 
greater autonomy, is very widespread, even 
among such groups as fundamentalists who 
think of restoring a golden age rather than “pro- 
gressing” toward an unknown future. 
Progress suggests a certain philosophical 
and moral content, as well as material improve- 
ment, and that, like beauty and justice, can be in 
the eye of the beholder. The image of the ideal 
society which would be the ultimate goal of 
progress 1s not shared, not only among cul- 
tures, but not even within them. I would main- 
tain that there are and always will be arguments 
because there is a permanent tension between the 
consciousness of man as an individual and man 
as a member of a community. Both are essential.

well as with cultural traditions, one or the other 
need is felt to be more urgent. Sooner or later, 
efforts to meet the one will lead to a feeling of 
intolerable constraint on the other, forcing a 
change of perceptions. This is why I reject 
Francis Fukuyama’s idea of an “end of history” 
even in his narrow Hegelian sense. The social 
versus individual dilemma is inherent in the 
human condition and will never be resolved. 
Therefore, I do not see how the idea of progress 
can mean much more than providing human 
satisfaction, which is inevitably an elusive, 
cvanescent state. 
A sense of void 
Modern industrial society ordered by democ- 
ratic government, which I assume is what is 
meant by “North”, has indeed gone a long way 
towards satisfying certain needs, compared to 
previous periods. But it also contains deep frus- 
trations and a sense of growing void, flagrantly 
displayed in the drug culture. I suppose this is 
what Malraux meant in saying “the twenty-first 
century will be spiritual or it will not be”. The 
North has been unable to explain that void, and 
therefore has come to doubt the reality of 
progress. The “South” sees the failings and looks 
for a different, more encompassing idea of 
progress with greater warmth, more human 
consolation and less alienation, though it hasn’t 
been able to explain it either. 
There are differences of emphasis, and in 
this sense, no, the idea of progress is not shared. 
That need not and should not be divisive or 
confrontational. There is still much to commu- 
nicate and share and enrich in all ways, pro- 
viding we do not fall into the trap of blaming 
“the enemy” for all that goes wrong, as we used 
to blame “God’s will”. Nor do I think it matters 
very much whether we all have the same idea of 
progress. Absolute conviction, certainty about 
the ultimate in human affairs, social blueprints, 
provide the one approach that is sure to be 
wrong, and they have been the source of a great 
deal of the harm people have done to cach other. 
It is as well that we try out different ways of 
secking to fulfill our hopes and aspirations, 
mindful that we all do have them. |

history obviously contains advance pointers to 
the state as an institution based on the rule of law. 
Africans have a saying, “The king does not have

suggests that of the rule of law. T have confirmed

every culture has good and bad, positive and neg- 
ative aspects. The universal must operate on the 
basis of positive particulars. None of us, I think, 
defends a “tribalization” of principles. The uni- 
versality of human rights is a just idea for the 
simple reason that we all have a human identity. It 
is as human beings that we all claim the applica- 
tion of these rights. 
On the subject of progress, I recently wrote, 
“It’s all very well to move fast as long as you 
know where you're going”. We cannot speak of 
progress solely in relation to means: the direction 
and purpose must be defined from the outset. In 
short, we cannot speak of progress without raising 
the question of ends: and this raises an ethical 
problem, since we have to choose a model or a 
plan for society. This aspect of the matter is often 
left out of the discussion. What kind of society do 
we want to build? In this context development 
has tended to mask—and even to promote— 
domination. Some Western leaders—I am 
thinking of Ronald Reagan in particular—have 
said, “They should do as we do!” On that basts, 
development becomes a way of imposing a pre- 
determined model. 
It is important to realize that the human and 
social sciences are lagging behind the other sci- 
ences. In my opinion no development is pos- 
sible without the development of the former. In 
the last ten years the world has witnessed a mul- 
titude of events that no-one foresaw because far 
too much priority has been given to the sciences 
that contribute to material development. People 
have devoted themselves to the accessories of 
intelligence, to the detriment of the brainwork 
that is the prime mover of human progress. 
We have reached the point where people’s 
individuality has been dismembered, split into 
fragments. They have lost touch with certain 
transcendent values and they have lost their 
sense of community. By way of illustration of

On/Off (1991), 
a mixed-media work 
measuring 48 x 39 x 25 cm 
by Romuald Hazoumé, an 
artist from Benin, 
this process another picture comes to my 
mind—that of the god-king Osiris, whose body 
was chopped up into pieces by his brother 
before being put back together again. I believe 
that this Egyptian myth is relevant today to 
human society as a whole: it is time to recon- 
struct man and put him together again. 
Intellectuals can play a crucial part in this 
respect, not only by weaving the dreams and 
myths that human beings need to give them a 
reason for living, but also by blazing the trail 
towards solidarity and mutual recognition on 
the basis of universal values. A Senegalese stu- 
dent recently said to me, “Professor, what we are 
interested in today is not development, but hap- 
piness.” I was impressed by his remark. Ata time 
when everyone is talking about progress and 
development, this young man brings us back to 
the essentials. No doubt people will say that 
happiness is as hard to define as progress. All the 
same, it is what we should be aiming for. 
Universality as the West understands itis a 
truncated concept. It is based only on one 
sequence of history. I have often rebuked my 
Western colleagues for their lack of receptiveness 
to other histories, their hermetic approach, and 
their tendency to think that things have only 
been happening in the last four centuries. If 
they do go further back, it is to make ancient 
Greece the absolute starting point, forgetting 
that Greece was itself influenced by other his- 
  
tories, especially that of Egypt, which in turn 
owes much to Africa. 
But let us go back to Ronald Reagan’s posi- 
tion. It does not hold water. Take the question 
of energy consumption. If the world’s per capita 
energy consumption was as high as that of 
North America, the consequences would be 
devastating. It is not enough to say that this 
model is undesirable; it is impossible. Wanting 
everyone to adopt it is a tragic mistake. Western 
thought, by persisting on this ecumenical path, 
actually tends towards exclusiveness. 
Could we not get intellectuals to turn their 
attention seriously to this dialectic between the 
universal and the particular? This would lead to 
agreement on some intangible principles which 
hold good for all human beings, such as respect 
for life and man’s relationship with nature and 
knowledge. What's the point of advocating uni- 
versality when in my country 70 to 75 per cent 
of the population can neither read nor write? In 
Africa we are moving directly from an oral tra- 
dition to the post-industrial era of the audiovi- 
sual, skipping the crucial stage of writing. 
It is utopian to propose the application of 
universal values to peoples in situations where 
the conditions for this do not exist. The principle 
of intercommunication, whereby individuals 
get to know themselves and communities get to 
know each other, is essential. I have already 
suggested that the right to know oneself and to 
be known should be added to the list of basic 
human rights. Many people, especially in the 
developed countries, think nowadays that there 
is nothing interesting to be learned in the coun- 
tries of the South. People who go there as 
tourists do not really enter into their histories, 
their cultures or their civilizations. This makes 
itimpossible to achieve the “co-responsibility” 
we sometimes hear about. 
The foundations of universality need to be 
strengthened and another organization of peo- 
ples established. People say that the United 
Nations Organization represents the peoples 
of the world, but today this is no longer true. 
States have gained the upper hand. They have 
been described as cold monsters, but I wonder 
whether they are not deep-frozen monsters. 
Transcending the paradigm of the national 
state, a legacy of nineteenth-century Europe, scems 
to me one possible route to the universal. Modern 
man’s technological achievements are creating 
new patterns, a new image of the world which 
makes this framework obsolete. We must tran- 
scend the nation-state and move towards the estab- 
lishment of livelier and more receptive communi- 
ties. Movement in that direction will bring us 
closer to the universal, and to progress. ||

### 95774: One world

Bl HE idea that the predominant trend is 
towards progress and universalism, with 
  
counter-currents running back towards 
religion and the irrational, is one that often seems 
to be taken for granted. 
This view is far removed from reality. As con- 
cerns the West, there is another way of looking at 
things that scems to me much closer to the mark. 
The idea of progress was uppermost in the minds 
by Alain Touraine = 
of certain intellectuals and statesmen for a century, 
but from 1870 onwards it was no longer dis- 
cussed. The history of the West has been some-

limits, I would even go so far as to say that if ever 
there was a time when people believed in progress, 
it was in the Middle Ages.

individual. These are becoming separate, distinct 
areas, and I think that political and cultural life in 
the West has been a matter of managing the rela- 
tionships between them. On the one hand, the 
idea of progress has been shattered and sup- 
planted by that of economic growth, and, on the 
other, an idea which is completely foreign to the 
very concept of progress has emerged, the idea of 
democracy, linked to that of individualism. None 
of the great eighteenth-century exponents of 
progress, including Rousseau as well as Voltaire, 
came out officially and openly in favour of 
democracy, quite the reverse. In fact, the concept 
of the nation, which first appeared in Germany, 
is the dominant concept of the twentieth century. 
In other words, the history of the West does 
not chronicle the universal triumph of reason 
but the process of learning how to manage the 
relationship between economic growth—what we 
may call practical reason—and the ideas of nation 
and freedom. 
This great current, previously moving in the 
direction of integration, is now moving, world- 
wide, in that of disintegration. We have the 
impression of living at a time when, to use expres-

sions that are almost slogans, markets, tribes and 
individual consciousnesses are living in separate 
worlds. Society as such no longer exists. This is 
important. Any solution that calls for the world 
to be rebuilt around the individual, around the 
economy or around cultures, is destined to fail 
and can only end in disaster. In the world of 
today, the objectivity of markets is completely dis- 
sociated from the plurality of individual con- 
sciousnesses and cultures. 
The West, and many other parts of the world, 
must now think how to live in accordance with 
several principles at the same time. The distin- 
guishing feature of Western modernity is, I repeat, 
not the universalism of progress, but the combi- 
nation of the universalism of reason, the partic- 
ularity of nations—stronger, of course, in more 
recently-built nations such as Italy and Ger- 
many—and the universality of human rights, in 
other words, the combination of individualism 
and democracy. 
I believe that this is the heart of the matter: not, 
above all, to argue the case for the universal 
against that of the particular, but to argue in 
favour of the need for a society, a country, a 
group of countries or the entire world to combine 
several principles. The desire to make societies 
one-dimensional—ethnically pure, dedicated to 
the rationale of the market or even entirely 
devoted to individual interests—is the funda- 
mental danger today. In every part of the world, 
learning how to combine several principles is 
essential. 
In my view it ts crucial that these problems 
should be discussed in the context of one single 
world. I believe it has become dangerous to talk 
about “the third world”, “the first world” and 
“the second world”. It is dangerous to think even 
that a North-South divide exists. This is a mis- 
representation. Today the same issues arise in 
both in differing proportions. Instead of saying 
that reason resides in the North, with all its flaws, 
while particularism reigns in the countries of the 
South, we should, I think, be stating this problem 
of combinations in the same terms for every part 
of the world; otherwise, there will be a head-on 
confrontation between those who argue that 
reason should be given priority and those who 
maintain that priority should be given to plu- 
rality and cultural diversity. |

I the world were a single country, it would 
be a “third world” country. Reduced to 
scale, the aggregate economic, social and 
environmental characteristics of the whole world 
arc the same as those of a typical third world 
country. The inequality of wealth, consump- 
tion and power, the diversity of cultures, reli- 
gions and languages and the degree and nature 
of conflicts over these differences, the diversity 
of genes and species and the rates at which they 
are being extinguished—where can one find 
these today but in the South? 
But the parallel runs deeper than levels of 
inequality, diversity or violence. There is what 
may be called an absence of a collective com- 
munity. Just as there is no such thing as a global 
community, in southern societies there is no 
such thing as a national community. Think about 
a reduction in global consumption levels to 
accommodate the environmental crisis, and ask 2 3

whether there can be a general agreement over 
whose consumption ought to be sacrificed. 
Should the poor die to enable the rich to live in 
the style they have been accustomed to, or 
should the rich give up centuries of progress 
and revert to what they might view as a sub- 
human form of consumption in order to let the 
poor survive? It is relatively easy to answer this 
question within the national boundaries of 
northern societies, but very difficult to do so at 
the global level. 
Thus the question “can the North and South 
share the same idea of progress?” can be refor- 
mulated more simply as “can the population of 
a southern country share the same idea of 
progress—or have any idea of progress at all?” 
In other words, instead of looking for a con- 
sensus between the North and the South, let us 
begin by looking at how the basis for consensus 
in the South differs from that in the North. 
A concept that continues to possess deep res- 
onance 1s colonialism. It is possible to portray the 
conflict over progress as one between two con- 
trasting attitudes towards colonialism. This con- 
flict squares off the (unconscious) champions or 
    
legitimizers of colonialism against its critics. Half 
a century after the supposed demise of colonial 
rule, these two strands have not moved towards 
a synthesis. On the contrary, one can sense 
already the distant rumblings of a revival of colo- 
nialism, first within the South itself, and later 
across the globe. There is a grave danger that 
from the standpoint of history the second half of 
the twentieth century will appear as but a brief 
interruption in the long march of colonial rule. 
One can be somewhat polemical here. It 
seems that while the discussion of progress solely 
in terms of outcomes is legitimate in the North 
(presumably because there is a consensus over 
institutions and processes, the so-called end of his- 
tory), this is not possible in the South, where 
there is a continuing history of powerlessness 
and injustice. If this is so, then the overall objec- 
tive of progress (growth, conservation) may be 
less important in the South than the mechanism 
through which the objective is to be achieved. It 
may make sense in the North to formulate theo- 
ries of salvation (which, in the words of Ashis 
Nandy, “do not save, but only justify action in the 
present”), but understanding in the South cannot 


### 95775: The Shadow of oppression

begin without a theory of oppression. 
In other words, the legitimacy of the idea of 
“progress” in large parts of the southern popu- 
lation would depend on our ability to formulate 
it, to use Nandy’s words again, in terms of “the 
expansion of the awareness of oppression”. In 
general, neither the North nor the clites of the 
South have defined progress in this manner. 
This was most evident in the discussions of 
the United Nations Conference on Environ- 
ment and Development (UNCED), which was 
itself a major attempt to define a shared idea of 
progress in the face of impending catastrophe. 
The North viewed itself as Noah building an 
Ark to defend us from the deluge; the South 
saw itself as Jesus being sacrificed on the cross 
for the sins of humanity. The North sought to 
focus on technology and organization, the South 
on politics and injustice. The story of UNCED 
is meaningless to one who sees only the shaping 
of a piece of wood but not whether it will bear 
the weight of Noah or of Jesus.

centuries and has since become universal. The 
idea of progress seemed to be a veritable law 
governing the way the world would evolve. It 
was based on the scientific determinism that 
then predominated—a kind of historical law 
that could be represented in various ways, that 
of Auguste Comte as well as that of Karl Marx. 
It seemed to have been reinforced by the idea 
that biological evolution started out with single- 
cell creatures and ended up with human beings, 
and to be supported by developments, which 
could only be beneficial, in science and in the fac- 
ulty of reason. In other words, the idea that 
spread was that of progress as being necessary 
and inevitable. World wars and other setbacks 
seemed to be merely unfortunate accidents 
caused by the death throes of reactionary and 
anti-progressive forces. 
Furthermore, the concept of development, 
which itself became generally accepted after the 
Second World War, gave rise to a kind of tech- 
nological and economic model of progress in 
which economic growth emerged as, so to speak, 
the only driving force needed for every form of 
human progress, including opportunities for 
personal fulfilment. This conception completely 
obscured the havoc wreaked by growth and 
technological and economic development on 
cultures, in Europe to begin with, but on a much 
greater scale in the rest of the world. 
Progress, that is to say the future, is today in 
crisis, a crisis of which there were already pre- 
monitory signs before the war but which is now 
omnipresent. It affects the entire world, and 
especially the developing countries, since it has 
become clear that both the Western and Eastern 
models of development have most often ended 
in failure. 
The crisis started brewing in the totalitarian 
regimes of the East, whose promise of a radiant 
future for mankind has crumbled in recent years, 
but it has also affected the West, where no-one, 


### 95776: A Shared crisis

and rightly so, any longer believes in historical 
or even physical determinism. The realization 
has dawned that science can manipulate, enslave 
and destroy as well as benefit humanity, and 
certain half-baked forms of reasoning—thinking 
that, in the abstract, is logical but is bereft of any 
empirical basis—have been spread abroad, mas- 
querading as “reason”. 
I therefore believe that we are experiencing, 
in various forms, a shared crisis of progress 
whose globalization I also believe to be the 
reason why people today are turning back to the 
ethnic group or to religion. When the future is 
lost and the present unhappy, miserable and 
distressing, the past is all that is left. I feel that our 
primary duty is to discard the idea of mechan- 
ical progress based exclusively on a technolog- 
ical and economic foundation. 
We should realize that underlying the idea of 
progress was the idea of “a better life”, lived 
decently and with a civilized respect for others. 
The idea of progress must henceforward be 
governed by this ethical imperative, thus 
becoming something desirable and possible 
rather than an inescapable mechanism. 
In my opinion this means that we must 
abandon the linear perspective according to 
which there was an advanced world, a back- 
ward world and a primitive world, all of which 
had to share the same conception. It must be 
acknowledged that every civilization or culture 
is a blend of the most diverse ingredients— 
superstitions, arbitrary beliefs, profound truths 
and age-old wisdom—and that this includes 
Europe, which also has its truths, its myths and 
its illusions, starting with the illusion of progress. 
Rethinking the idea of progress is becoming 
a priority. ||

### 95777: Treating nature with reverence

TREATING NATURE @ 
WITH REVEREN 
BY FRANCE BEQUETTE 
  
  
  
F the inhabitants of the Nicobar 
Islands in the Bay of Bengal 
south of Myanmar had not 
remained faithful to traditional 
ways of managing the resources 
of their ecosystem, the environment 
in which they live would not have 
survived for long. Some of the archi- 
pelago’s twenty-two unequally-sized 
islands are sparsely-wooded, while 
others are covered with dense 
forests that are home to rare tree 
species. A few of them, such as Car 
Nicobar and Chowra, are overpop- 
ulated, but no one goes hungry and 
everyone can get hold of enough 
wood to build a house and a fishing 
boat. According to a study carried 
out by G. Prakash Reddy, professor 
of social anthropology at the uni- 
versity of Tirupati (India), the bal- 
ance between forests, grasslands 
and farmland is respected. When- 
ever a villager needs grass to roof 
his house or wood to repair it, he 
asks the island Council. Anyone 
who cuts down a tree must replant 
one of the same species in the same 
spot. The Council recommends 
burning dried coconut shells and 
waste vegetable matter for cooking, 
except for great feasts, when dead 
wood is used. During one of the tra- 
ditional ceremonies that punctuate 
the year, pigs are sacrificed so that 
there are not too many of them 
when food for people and livestock 
becomes scarce. 
The example of the Nicobar 
Islands shows that, contrary to 
widespread belief, some of the 
planet's inhabitants did not wait 
until the 1970s before starting to 
take care of their environment.

TREATING NATURE 
REVEREACE WIT     
Social and religious traditions on 
every continent have helped to 
manage nature without destroying it. 
Travellers in the west African 
savanna, for example, can see dense 
forests or copses that have been 
respected because they are sacred. 
These areas, including some in 
Casamance (Senegal), are currently 
being studied for Unesco. Eugene 
Faty, who lives in Casamance, 
observed the sacred Oussouye 
forest south of Dakar, which no one 
is allowed to enter, on UNESCO's 
behalf. The fruits that grow on its 
trees are untouchable. They fall to 
the ground, where their seeds give 
rise to dense undergrowth. Trees 
and animals are strictly protected, 
and may be removed only during 
initiation ceremonies which take 
place every twenty or twenty-five 
years. If a tree must be cut down or 
an animal killed, its forgiveness 
must be asked first. The same tra- 
dition used to be found among the 
hunters of Parakou and Savé, in 
northern Benin. The hunters were 
also healers who maintained a close 
relationship with plants and ani- 
mals, from which they made med- 
icines. Not everyone had the right to 
kill alion or buffalo. Before and after 
the hunt, the privileged hunters had 
to offer sacrifices which cost them 
very dear, thus naturally limiting 
the quantity of quarry they could 
take. 
  
TE — 
READING NATURE'S OPEN BOOK 
Although European settlement has 
profoundly altered the quality oflife 
of Australia’s Aborigines, nature is 
still an open book to them. With nei- 
ther watches nor calendars, they tell 
the times and seasons by the blos- 
soming of plants and trees. When the 
milky-white “oyster flowers” are in 
bloom, real oysters are plump, white 
and ready for gathering, and when 
the pink heather in Darwin, Northern 
Territory, blossoms, it means honey 
is plentiful. Food is closely related to 
religion. People, the earth, animals 
and plants all belong within a vast 
system of laws created by the ances- 
tral spirits during the “dream-time”. 
The honey ants of Papunya, in the 
centre of the country, are a beneficent 
reincarnation of these spirits because 
they provide the Aborigines with the 
sweetmeats they relish. Some foods 
become totems and may sometimes 
be eaten during ceremonies, which 
helps regulate both hunting and 
gathering. Custom requires the Tiwis 
of Bathurst Island, not far from 
Darwin, always to rebury a piece ofa 
yam to make sure the tuber grows 
back right away. 
Shark fishing off the Tonga Islands 
is a ritual activity, remote from any 
concern for catch size or profit, and 
does not deplete the sea’s abundant 
resources. “Throughout the Pacific,” 
writes Marie-Claire Bataille-Ben- 
guigui of the French National 
Museum of Natural History, “the 
shark is a revered or even sacred 
creature. It is, depending on the 
place, theincarnation of either gods 
or ancestors”. In the Tonga Islands, 
the shark is considered to be alove- 
token from the deity Hina, a female 
figure observed on the moon, to the 
world of human beings. Harpooned 
or caught with fish nets or slip-knots, 
the sharks are shared out, but they

cannot be sold and the pieces cannot 
leave the village. Traditional fishing 
methods are, however, being 
replaced by more efficient, environ- 
mentally threatening techniques. 
The small kingdom of Bhutan, 
northeast of India, is another place 
where religious beliefs help protect 
the environment. A specialist who 
lived there for ten years says the 
people of Bhutan, steeped in Bud- 
dhist philosophy, have a profound 
respect for rivers and for mountains, 
some of which it is forbidden to 
climb. Species that have become 
extremely rare, such as the snow 
leopard and the Himalayan black 
bear, live in peace in Bhutan because 
animals there are never killed for 
sport. When black-necked cranes 
migrate from Siberia or northern 
Tibet to spend the winter, landing 
in the fields in large flocks, the local 
people, who respect the birds, con- 
sider it an excellent omen. 
On the other hand, the foresthas 
not been spared. The cutting of wood 
for fuel and the clearing of forests 
for agriculture have seriously jeop- 
ardized the ecological balance. The 
government has launched an $8.9 
million programme to set up exten- 
sive forest reserves and encourage 
farmers to plant trees around their 
property because wood supplies 98 
per cent of their energy needs. A 
World Bank report indicates that 
overexploitation of the forest does 
not seem to have alerted the local 
population, which, moreover, is 
increasing at a rapid rate, 
[tis hard to believe that the bare, 
eroded, arid lands of Cochabamba 
in central Bolivia supported a lush 
tropical forest as recently as the 
nineteenth century. Who was 
responsible for this act of destruc- 
tion? Trees played a major part in 
Inca mythology. Michel Schlaifer, a 
specialist in forestry who has been 
working in Cochabamba for three 
years, has written that the Incas 
regarded the roots of trees as a link 
with the ancestors in the world 
“below”, the trunk as representing 
the “present” world, and the 
branches as symbolizing the rela- 
tionship with the gods in the world 
“above”. In his History of the New 
World, published in 1653, the - 
Spanish historian Bernabé Cobo 
observed that a Spanish household 
burned more wood in a day than 
an Indian household burned in a 
month. The Spanish cooked several 
times a day whereas the Indians 
prepared all their food for the day in 
one go. The Indians built their 
dwellings of rammed earth, while 
the Spanish settlers used wood for 
house frames, furniture and doors.

THE ROLE OF THE SACRED 
Colonization brought with it the 
system of cash crops and quick 
profits, but it was not the only factor 
that upset the balance between man 
and nature. Some specialists argue 
that the New Zealand moa (or 
dinorcis), a giant bird that was 
unable to fly and was an easy prey for 
Polynesian hunters, became extinct 
because it was not protected by a 
taboo. Research in this field is con- 
tinuing in New Caledonia, where 
similar reasons may explain the dis- 
appearance of the macrofauna. 
According to the Zairian sociolo- 
gist Simon Mukuna, many activities 
by indigenous peoples are wrongly 
attributed to a desire to protect the 
environment, The Baoulé of Cote 
d'Ivoire, for instance, respect the trees 
on their sacred mountain because 
the spirits of the dead live there and 
harmony must be preserved between 
them and the spirits of the forest. Is it 
possible that the sacralization of 
nature is the best way to protect it? In 
the summer 1992 issue of Diogenes, 
the quarterly journal of the Interna- 
tional Council of Philosophy and 
Humanistic Studies (no. 159, pp. 58- 
60), the Mexican philosopher Luis 
Villoro writes of Aztec civilization as 
follows: “Time and space were deter- 
mined in terms of the sacred; the 
sacred pervaded their institutions, 
their daily lives, their artistic cre- 
ations, and formed the basis of all 
their beliefs. . . . The gods are a tan- 
gible presence in all things: in trees, 
rivers, mountains, time and space, 
and in the daily activities of men... . 
The desacralization of nature and of 
society began with transcendental 
monotheism. The alienation of the 
sacred was accentuated in the 
Renaissance. Nature began tobe scen 
not as the impression and sign of 
divinity, but as a manipulable object, 
destined to be dominated and 
moulded by man”. 
In Ghana forests have been pre- 
served because they are regarded 
as sacred. Untsco has launched a 
three-year project entitled the “Co- 
Prayer-flags in 
Bhutan. 
operative Integrated Project on 
Savanna Ecosystems in Ghana”, 
which will study carefully preserved 
sacred forests with the help of 
fetishists, village communities, 
farmers, women and local authori- 
ties. The aim is to reconstitute in 
the surrounding area the flora that 
is best-adapted to the climate and 
soil. This is a good example of how 
the knowledge and practices of 
indigenous peoples are being pos- 
itively reassessed during the Inter- 
national Year devoted to them. m

A Canadian company, Imperial Oil

Labrador retrievers, which are also 
used to detect drugs and as guide-

from pipes buried as deep as five 
metres underground. When a 
pipeline springs a leak, a foul- 
smelling chemical is pumped into 
the suspected section. This sub- 
stance, which was specially devel- 
oped for the Canadian company, is 
what the dogs actually detect. Impe-

UNDERSTANDING RIO 
A Geneva-based foundation, the Centre for Our Common 
Future, has published a remarkable little book entitled 
The Earth Summit's Agenda for Change. A plain-lan- 
guage version of Agenda 21 and the other Rio agreements. 
The book, written by Michael Keating, is divided into 
four sections: the social and economic dimensions of 
Agenda 21; resource conservation and management; 
strengthening the role of major groups; and the means 
of implementation of sustainable development. Each 
part is broken down into a number of one- or two-page 
sections illustrated with tables and graphs of great clarity. 
In addition to the English version there are also versions 
in French, German, Spanish, Italian and Russian. For 
further details please write to the The Centre for Our 
Common Future, 52 rue des Pdquis, 1201 Geneva,

THE WORLD'S COLDEST 
CASSAVA 
Cassava is a tuber that feeds approx- 
imately 800 million people, or one 
person in every seven. The Inter- 
national Center for Tropical Agri- 
culture (CIAT) in Cali, Colombia, 
has frozen cassava shoot tips by 
plunging them into liquid nitrogen 
at-196°C, stopping the plants’ cell 
functions and making it possible to 
preserve them indefinitely. Rigob- 
erto Hidalgo, a researcher at the 
Center, says, “Genetic diversity 
cannot be recreated after it disap- 
pears, so gene banks are the basis 
for tomorrow’s food supply.” In 1991 
CIAT froze plant parts in liquid 
nitrogen, recovered them and made 
them grow again into whole plants. 
The Center is already planning to 
extend the process, which so far has 
been used only to preserve cassava, 
to other tropical species such as 
potatoes, sweet potatoes and 
bananas. [| 
  
PROTECTING THE BIJAGOS 
ARCHIPELAGO 
The Bijagos archipelago is part of 
the west African country of Guinea- 
Bissau, which is wedged between 
Senegal and Guinea. Now part of 
the Archipel Island and Coastal 
Biosphere Reserves Network, which 
isintegrated into Unesco’s Man and 
the Biosphere (MAB) programme, 
the island chain comprises some 
80 islands and stretches over'900 
square kilometres. Social and cul- 
tural anthropologists as well as 
ornithologists are very interested 
in the archipelago, whose environ- 
ment is still well preserved, although 
new buildings for the tourist 
industry are starting to appear along 
the coasts. As a result, the govern- 
ment and a number of national and 
international organizations have 
decided to promote the establish- 
ment of a national park and a bio- 
sphere reserve. The project is 
accompanied by an awareness- 
raising and information campaign, 
training programmes for local 
people, and a coastal planning pro- 
ject that has already resulted in sev- 
eral land-use maps for Guinea- 
Bissau and the Bijagos archipelago.

INITIATIVES i | 
LONSERVATION INTERNATIONAL 
1X years ago Conservation International (CI), an 
American non-governmental organization, began 
breaking new ground in the field of environmental 
protection. In 1987 the group organized the first 
debt-for-nature swap by purchasing part of Bolivia's 
external debt on the international market. CI raised 
funds that helped the South American country’s gov- 
ernment create a “biosphere reserve” comprising 1.5 
million hectares of the Beni humid tropical forest in the 
middle of the country. 
A project aimed at breaking down the political borders 
between ecosystems by defining transnational “biore- 
gions” is even more far-reaching. Costa Rica and Panama, 
for example, signed an agreement setting up the bina- 
tional La Amistad Biosphere Reserve, and in 1991 CI 
brought together representatives of Guatemala, Mexico 
and Belize to define the boundaries of a tropical rain 
forest corresponding to those of the ancient Mayan 
empire. In Guatemala 25,000 square kilometres have 
become the Maya Biosphere Reserve, which is comple- 
mented by other reserves in the neighbouring countries. 
Large-scale projects currently under way in seventeen 
countries have made Cl famous. They are accompanied 
by a host of related activities. For example, teams of CI 
experts are assessing the diversity of plant and animal 
species inremote areas of the Amazon forest and Papua 
New Guinea. Cl has also developed a geographic infor- 
mation system to pinpoint environmental hotspots 
where protection and management are top priorities. It 
is encouraging young people in Costa Rica and Suri- 
name to study the medicinal properties of local plants 
with village shamans, ensuring that their knowledge is 
passed on to future generations. At the same time it is pro- 
moting sustainable use of the forests’ myriad non-timber 
products, such as the tagua palm nut, which looks and 
feels like ivory, decorative plants, spices, waxes and 
resins. In Guatemala, for example, 
villagers harvest chicle, a natural 
latex used in the manufacture of 
chewing gum. 
CI has adopted the “biosphere 
reserve” concept defined by 
UNEesco, combining nature con- 
servation with local development 
and scientific research. Michel 
Batisse, former Assistant Director- 
General with UNesco’s Science 
Sector, is a member of the orga- 
nizations Board of Directors. 
Unisco and CI have produced 
an educational film entitled 
Biosphere Reserves in Tropical 
America, which is available in 
English, French, Spanish and 
Portuguese. [|

India. He was formerly head of 
Unesco's Office of Public 
Information. 
AVE we become obsolete? We failed to 
H foresee the chaos, anarchy and violence 
that have been wreaking havoc in many 
parts of the world during the last few ycars. We 
were not prepared, mentally and emotionally, 
for the implosion of the Soviet Union, the upsurge 
of cthnic, nationalist and religious hatreds in 
Europe, Africa and Asia, the sight of people too 
emaciated or terrorized to express a single 
coherent thought or voice a single coherent 
sentiment. 
We do not know what questions to ask. The 
grandiose interrogations that world views, holistic 
approaches and ideologies prompted until only 
the other day now invite ridicule, scorn and, 
what is worse, apathy and indifference. Our 
  
  
vocation is to connect individuals and events, 
events and trends, trends and processes, signs 
and fantasies. We are not able to do so. And itis 
this inability which provokes us more and more 
to speak about the uncontrollable forces now 
taking hold of our minds in terms which are 
either apocalyptic or embarrasingly autobio- 
graphical. No longer can we echo Malraux:

### 95912: Asking the right questions

Qu’importe ce qui n’importe qu’a moi? (What 
does anything matter that matters to me alone?) 
This sense of our own obsolescence must 
lead us, inevitably, to question the assumptions we 
made, the logic we followed and the goals we set 
for ourselves during our intellectual itinerary. 
These are admittedly large questions which can 
at best yield tentative, vague and extremely gen- 
eralized answers. But we can no longer avoid 
them. Whether we were conservatives, liberals or 
Marxists, our notion of progress tended to be 
linear and measurable. Progress meant “marching 
ahead” on the strength of capital, technology, 
management, marketing and, depending on where 
we placed ourselves on the ideological spectrum, 
on the distribution of incomes and assets and 
the creation of cultural artefacts and services. 
We assumed that material wellbeing, civic 
order and cultural give-and-take were goals 
shared by humanity everywhere and that the 
obstacles in the way of reaching these goals were 
class interest, mercantile aggrandisement or the 
never-satiated appetite for influence and power of 
certain nations or groups of nations. This is why 
our moral categories were biased in favour of 
individual freedoms and egalitarianism. This is 
why we reposed our faith in reason and ratio- 
nality. This is why we assumed that cconomic 
advancement, social justice, higher standards of 
education, culture and health, equality before 
the law and such other elements of a democratic 
order would forever banish the demons of prej- 
“udice, hate and bigotry. 
Messianic creeds and millenarian 
fantasies 
We were wrong. In retrospect we made no 
allowance for several factors which have now come 
to play a pivotal role in shaping the destiny of 
individuals, communities and nations. We did not 
pay enough attention for instance to the fact that 
in two crucial areas of our life—the economy and 
information—the centres of decision-making 
would no longer be local or national bureaucracies 
but more and more transnational oligarchies of 
bankers, speculators and myth-makers in the 
media. In these two areas the sovereignty enjoyed 
by national governments is being eroded day by 
day in the name of the free market, the interde- 
pendence of economics, the free flow of ideas and 
images. 
Nor did we adequately appreciate the extent to 
which rising expectations for a better life—mea- 
sured almost entirely in terms of higher levels of 
consumption—would inevitably engender frus- 
tration, which in turn would lead to the atomiza- 
tion of individuals, the destabilization of societies 
and the progressive entropy of institutions whose 
role is to protect life and property, dispense justice, 
temper greed and avarice. When individuals, soci- 
eties and the various bodies of governance are 
thus rendered rudderless, messianic creeds and 
millenarian fantasies step in to promise a socially 
stable, spintually sound and materially prosperous 
future. In the period after the end of the Second 
World War these creeds and fantasies, which derive 
their sustenance from references to a glorious

past, a past free of ethnic, racial, linguistic and 
religious “impurities”, were fringe phenomena. 
Now in the North and South alike they threaten 
to come centre-stage. They frown on reason, sus- 
pect objectivity, decry tolerance, despise the sec- 
ular outlook and debunk modernity. 
Make no mistake about it. To people who 
are afraid of chaos and deprivation, this appeal to 
return to “fundamentals” of religious faith has a 
powerful emotional and moral appeal which is all 
the stronger because the rational and secular dis- 
course has proved again and again to be a case of 
hopes unfulfilled, a case of doubie-speak and 
double-think, of hypocrisy and arrogance. That 
those who advocate a return to “fundamentals” 
and to various “cleansing” operations have no 
. morally viable alternatives to offer is another 
story altogether. But few are willing to even con- 
sider listening to such a story right now. 
Lost certainties 
The India I come from is no longer the India of 
Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru. This 
was the India in which I was bom and where I 
grew up. When these two men held India in thrall 
every Indian had an entcing challenge to shoulder: 
to gradually minimize the importance of, if not 
altogether shed, the “givens” of his birth—his 
religion, his caste, his linguistic and provincial 
affinities—the better to assume his larger identity 
as a citizen of a vast multi-religious and mula-cul- 
tural nation. This, in turn, would enable him to be 
at pcace with himself and with the world at large. 
Our articles of faith were democracy, secu- 
larism, democratic socialism, non-alignment. We 
took pride in the fact that we were an old civi- 
lization but a young nation; that our pcople were 
poor and largely illiterate but yet held in their 
hands the power to make and unmake govern- 
ments; that our press was free; that though our 
country was partitioned on religious lines in 1947 
we refused to tread the path of theocracy; that 
Hinduism, which owed its genius to its eclectic 
and pluralistic nature, would ensure that our 
democracy would avoid the pitfalls of majori- 
tarianism; that our system would steer clear of the 
excesses of capitalism and communism alike, and 
that we would build a modern India on the foun- 
dations of a civilization which has given mankind 
some of its shrewdest philosophical insights and 
some of its most sublime aesthetic experiences. 
Today, money power and muscle power have 
often replaced arguments about clectoral pro- 
grammes. Corruption is all-pervasive. People have 
little faith in the fairness and efficiency of the 
administration and the courts. Our secularism 
too has come under a cloud because religion is 
being blatantly cxploited for electoral gain. The 
BHR minorities arc being told to reject all reform on the

ground thatit would endanger their identity. The 
majority is being persuaded that the “appease- 
ment” of the minorities has gone far enough. The 
secularists are clearly on the defensive. 
The collapse of the Soviet Union has if any- 
thing precipitated the fall of the two remaining pil- 
lars of Nehruvian India: socialism and non-align- 
ment. Interdependence in the economic sphere has - 
led purely and simply to obeying the dictates of 
international financial institutions and the transna- 
tionals regardless of the costs to social justice and 
to sovereign decision-making. As for non-align- 
ment, there is no-one left to be non-aligned against. 
The emerging world order is nothing if not “prag- 
matic”, that is, one where the currency of power 
is economic clout, military (preferably atomic) 
might and political and social “order”.

### 95912: Asking the right questions

Unwilling to participate in the media carni- 
vals, unable to succumb to the seductions of 
the marketeers, profoundly sceptical of funda- 
mentalisms, reduced to the role of a helpless 
spectator of nations losing their sovereignty 
and of societies redefining their identities on 
the aggressive agenda of separateness, the intel- 
lectual appears to have reached two debilitating 
conclusions. First, that the North-South 
dichotomy is not a geographical or even civi- 
lizational expression, but that it is very much 
present in the minds of individuals everywhere. 
Second, that for the present at least this 
dichotomy cannot be overcome because, in the 
truest sense, 1t is rooted in the quest for power 
at one end and in the quest for self-fulfilment at 
the other. The discourse of the International 
Monctary Fund and the Pentagon, and of their 
surrogates elsewhere in the world, shapes the 
former quest while the discourse of the cler- 
gyman shapes the latter. Nations may come 
together or fall apart but in both cases people are 
called upon to worship at the altar of Mammon 
and to converse with the Almighty, either 
directly, if possible, or through His intermedi- 
aries on carth if necessary. 
Striking a balance 
The cashier, the communicator, the clergyman 
rule the roost: none of them has any usc for clab- 
orate conceptual systems, logic or the reason of 
the sort dear to the Enlightenment philosophers. 
The cashier, communicator and clergyman enter- 
tain no doubt; their sole concern is how best to 
market their certainties. The certainty of the 
cashier is ever more cash; that of the communi- 
cator, ever more slick messages; that of the cler- 
gyman, ever greater simplification of the ago- 
nies that torment the soul. In plain words, the 
intellectual, to be effective, cannot be content to 
discredit cash, subvert the slick message and 
expose the chilling banalities of fundamentalist 
speech, but must propose solutions which do 
not emanate either from a cockily self-confident 
ideology or from its counterfeit, religiosity. 
This is of course easier said than done. 
Perhaps a beginning can be made if intellec- 
tuals learn to strike a balance between the imper- 
atives of economic progress brought about by sci- 
ence and technology and efficient management of 
men and resources, concern for human rights, the 
protection of the environment, and affirmation of 
cultural identity without aggressivity or apologia. 
Perhaps a constant preoccupation with the spir- 
itual and moral yearnings of individuals every- 
where is required. Emphasizing one of these 
imperatives at the expense of the others may well 
be the reason why the world appears to have 
gone out of gear. n

Assuming 
Running Man, a 
“geometric” photographic 
sequence produced 
in 1886 by the French 
scientist and photographer 
Etienne Jules Marey. 
IRST of all we must be clear about what we 
mean by the words “progress”, “North” 
and “South”. (“North” of what? “South” 
of what? The problem of positioning becomes 
crucial here; and the suggestion of tidy objec- 
tivity—north and south of an immovable neu- 
tral equator—has fallen into disrepute since 
Copernicus). 
Progress is a combination of motion and 
direction, from one point to another. Before 
anything else, we should clear our vocabulary to 
make surc North and South agree on starting 
points and (temporary) goals. All too often in the 
past the starting point has been implied to be 
wherever the South finds itself at a given 
moment; and the goal the position occupied by 
the North. At the very least, it seems to me that 
the guideline should be what Camus said about 
freedom and justice: accepting that neither is 
attainable in an absolute form, at least one knows 
that in any situation it is possible to aspire to 
more freedom and more justice. 
What sort of progress? 
But having clarified the principle, we still need 
to define the context of the progress we have in 
mind. Are we talking about technology, cco- 
nomics, social behaviour, judicial systems, or 
politics? Again, the vantage point would deter- 
mine everything. It is easy to predict which 
position will be assumed by those in the North

who interpret the collapse of Marxism as, ipso 
facto, the vindication of capitalism. And the 
very notion of “universalism” is suspect from the 
moment the question of “whose universalism?” 
1s posed. 
Are we talking about aesthetic progress? If 
we are, then surely the great Northern (here 
identical with Western) tradition of symmetries 
and masterpieces, of the pursuit of excellence, of 
the beautiful, of the whole, appears to serve, if 
not as a consummation devoutly to be wished, 
then at least as a time-honoured and thoroughly 
proven point of departure. But the South African 
experience places it under a question mark, if not 
under threat of erasure. How “valid” is a tradi- 
tion that originated in ancient Greece among 
those individuals who had the leisure to indulge 
in aesthetics because they had enough slaves to 
take care of their manual work? 
This dangerous division between “higher” 
and “menial” pursuits is itself open to ques- 
tion. (And yet it has “validity”! Who would be 
so rash as to discard all its products, from Homer 
and Sophocles via Chaucer and Ronsard and 
Michelangelo and Shakespeare and Rembrandt 
and Mozart and Tolstoy and countless others?) 
The point is that the moment “validity” enters 
into the discussion it invites, once again, the 
question, “Validity for whom?”, which sub- 
verts all aspirations towards the objective and the 
universal. It is so easy for such matters to be

drawn into the games of power that preoccupy 
our world. And of one thing I am sure—I 
hope!—and that is that when we speak of 
progress it is not progress in increasing the effi- 
ciencies of power we have in mind. (The oppo- 
site may be closer to our intentions: the curtail- 
ment of power; the minimizing of power in 
order to maximize freedom and justice and the 
pursuit of truth.) 
As a writer, my concern would primarily 
be with progress of a cultural kind, or within a 
cultural context; and for the purposes of speci- 
fication I would focus on those impulses of cul- 
ture involved in the production of meaning and 
the definition of morality, of ethical responsi- 
bility. Assuming once again, with Camus, the 
absence of objective or absolute value systems, 
certainly, in respect both of significance and of 
morality, it would be possible to strive for an 
increase, and an enhancement, in any given con- 
text, social or otherwise. 
Surely, actions, projects or products can con- 
stantly be improved in terms of their “load” of 
meaning or their moral “validity” to or for an 
increasing number of individuals (and in their 
impact on cach individual). The problem of a 
defining instance may appear to remain: who 
“decides” on what will make a given cultural 
achievement more morally acceptable, or more 
significant? And once again the danger of an 
imposition of criteria from outside or above is only 
too real. (But perhaps “value” may precisely be 37

starting point of cultural progress: yet that expe- 
rience remains at all times fully inserted within 
social interchange and collective responsibility. 
Obviously this goes far beyond, but need not 
exclude, the conceptions of culture presently 
encountered in much of the world: culture as the 
“organization of leisure” in the North; culture 
as combat and “conscientization” in the South. 
That dangerous animal, 
the intellectual 
We know that, at least since Julien Benda’s La 
Trahison des clercs, the term “intellectual” is 
itself at risk. We know Camus’s warning that 
“The intellectual is a dangerous animal that 
easily commits treason.” But who still conceives 
of that species as the lonely, aloof, disinterested 
creature who judges human events, in an ivory 
tower of dispassionate sanity, in terms of a tran- 
scendental Good or Evil? We know that the 
much-vaunted “free agent” of the Age of Reason 
is a fiction: we are all subject to the tussle and 
play of ideologies, even when we least suspect it; 
and at least we have learned this much from 
Marxism, that we accept our involvement 
even our implication—in our social context and 
in history. 
But this does not remove our responsibility. 
This, to me, is the key to the intellectual’s 
role, both within the general processes of change 
in which all individuals and societies are engaged, 
and in the specific convulsions of transition our 
world is experiencing in this particular fin de 
siecle: that of responsibility. Responsibility to the 
individual conscience as much as to the social 
collective; responsibility to history (that is, not 
only to the present, but to past and future); 
responsibility towards those values which guar- 
antce the compass of our humanity: freedom, 
truth, justice. And it also means a responsibility 
against whatever threatens to diminish that 
humanity, which would include a responsibility 
against ideology, against dogma. The intellectual, 
today, 1s no longer only the one who says, 
“Paccuse!”, but the one who affirms, “J assume 
ma responsabilité”. 
At the very least this assumption of respon- 
sibility by the intellectual towards the processes 
of progress would imply the elimination (in 
oneself; in one’s society) of mentalities and atti- 
tudes resulting from our adherence, for too 
long, to the divisions of Empire and Barbar- 
1ans, West and East, North and South: in the 
North, the belief in superiority and in centrism; 
in the South, the victim mentality, which makes 
it too easy always to blame others for all predica- 
ments and problems. Once again, both these 
attitudes are demonstrated quite spectacularly in 
South Africa today; but once again the virtue of 
this demonstration is its applicability to most of 
the world’s societies, in one form or another— 
ranging from ethnic jokes to genocide. 
The lure of power 
In the exercise of this responsibility the greatest 
danger is, once again, the lure of power. In the 
old South Africa, the white minority dictated its 
master narratives and used its control of the 
media and the means of cultural production to 
help maintain its political control. There are 
signs, in the transitional South Africa, of cultural 
commissars trying to impose their ideological 
position (curiously and anachronistically Stal- 
inist in many respects) on others in order to 
turn the tables on the “opposition”. Even if it is 
not hard to understand the justification of such 
a démarche, it goes without saying that this 
simply perpetuates the principle of binarity 
which was the undoing of the ancien regime. 
The intellectual—notably the intellectual in 
her or his manifestation as writer—should 
clearly distinguish between two separate possible 
roles to be played: first, as writer, in which the 
act of creating itself predominates, with its 
emphasis on individual experience and the indi- 
vidual conscience, the individual responsibility 
towards excellence (this is the context within 
which Marquez characterized the writer as rev- 
olutionary in terms of “writing as well as he 
can”); second, as “vedette”, which is the conse- 
quence of the first. (As a result of writing well— 
whatever that is perceived to be in a given situ- 
ation—she or he acquires notoriety, which can 
be used as a base for influencing the cultural/ 
social/political debate.) It is imperative to dis- 
tinguish between the two. 
The first role holds only the danger of with- 
drawal; but that, it seems to me, is a danger 
soclety has to accept as a given; it is the price to 
be paid for the possibility (never the guarantee) 
of cultural quality. For it is simply not possible 
to “program” writing—or any cultural activity 
for that matter; the whole value of the indi- 
vidual in society is vested in this. And in South 
Africa it is significant that, after decades of 
“struggle literature” (much of it, I should point 
out, remarkably good by any standards) the 
African National Congress itself is turning more

and more towards this aspect of individual 
unpredictability and responsibility in cultural 
activity. 
The second function of the writer—as “cul- 
tural worker”—holds the real danger of involve- 
ment in power strategies. It cannot be shirked, and 
it cannot be denied. The nature of our media- 
informed world is such that tremendous poten- 
tial power is lodged within this function. For 
that very reason, once again, one’s basic appeal is 
to responsibility—in respect of each of the social 
and moral forces I have outlined earlier. 
Ultimately, then, the differences we impose 
on our categorization of North and South are 
both confirmed and transcended within the

affirm our common humanity; through our 
dedication to mutual excellence, we foster a 
mutual respect; through our involvement in 
humanity we create space for the individual; 
through our assumption of responsibility we 
allow each other to assume our full worth as 
members of the human family. Progress is the 
same for all, and never the same; it demands 
awareness of difference and diversity as a starting 
point, yet it never fails to affirm that as women 
and men of South and North we are all as weak 
as the weakest among us, as strong as the 
strongest. [ am, we are; we are, I am. [|

### 95917: Listen for the stirrings of new life

‘LISTEN FOR THE STIRRINGS OF NEW LIFE’ 
HE closing years of the twentieth century mark a turning 
point in history. Fault-lines are appearing in the old world 
order, and as it breaks up it is as if history were subject to 
the laws of plate tectonics. 
We cannot stand idly by as passive witnesses to the rapid 
changes whereby our world is adapting to economic, social, 
and cultural upheavals of unprecedented scale. We have a duty 
to find new ways of freeing the human race from the threats and 
fears of this fin de siécle. 
Of course, all this is nothing new—-the world has long known 
the scourges of poverty and underdevelopment, illiteracy and 
unequal access to health care, war and genocide, hunger and 
malnutrition, massive indebtedness, unemployment, lack of 
equal opportunities for women, the scandal of great wealth 
alongside dire poverty, the population explosion and strife 
between communities. I, for one, shall not sing the praises of the 
1960s and 1970s. For the vast majority those were dark years in 
which the voice of human suffering was smothered under the 
heavy blanket of dictatorship and totalitariansim. 
But today we are seeing the hope born of democratic revo- 
lution, in the East and in the South, being transformed into anx- 
iety and despair, as reality falls short of expectations, as human 
aspirations are overwhelmed by the immensity of the problems 
that lie ahead, as development founders in so many parts of the 
world; and above all as the quest for happiness meets with failure 
in the most developed countries, where tried and trusted proce- 
dures and mechanisms have ceased to be effective, 
We must “invent” the future; we must find imaginative ways 
of redistributing both work and leisure. We must learn to give of 
ourselves. We must be prepared to make sacrifices in the search 
for new strategies. We must find a better way to share our one 
remaining unspoiled treasure—our future. 
In so-called “traditional” societies economic activity was 
regarded as merely one aspect of a wider existence. It was part of 
a daily routine conditioned by the rhythms of nature, faith and 
social relations. Over the centuries the means of production 
developed or were transformed slowly, in harmony with the 
seasons and the environment, in concert with myths and customs. 
Individual initiative formed an integral part of the collective 
enterprise. Each member of the community was guided in his or 
her behaviour by an understanding of the common culture and 
standards of the group. 
The first signs of the rapid disruption of this balance appeared 
in Europe. With advances in science and technology and the 
advent of industrialized society, a social system and methods of 
production were developed that led increasingly to the separa- 
tion of the individual from the community, of culture from 
nature, of work from leisure. Human beings were themselves 
fragmented, with the growing specialization of productive labour. 
By its progressive reduction of human relations to quantifiable 
factors, the industrial revolution began a standardizing process 
in which the natural differences between individuals were replaced 
by a heightened potential for social conflict; in which human 
beings could be treated as abstractions—added and subtracted, 
counted and manipulated. In short, spiritual and cultural values 
no longer played a part in the material world. 
No doubt the power and influence wielded over material 
things by industrialized society derive in part from the logic of 
this process whereby complex entities are systematically reduced 
to simpler and simpler elements. Meanwhile, we have lost a 
world vision, a feeling of respect for our neighbour and a sense 
of community. 
The gulf 1s not only between nations, but within nations. In the 
developing countries, in fact, the polarization of society, something 
virtually unknown in the past, is widening the gap between the 
incomes of certain privileged classes and those of the rest. And so 
it is that disparities arise in opportunities for education and par- 
ticipation in the cultural and political life of a country. 
THE POET'S MESSAGE 
Can we allow ourselves to remain unmoved by the mute con- 
frontation between the worlds of rich and poor? The American 
philosopher Hannah Arendt wrote of a “culture crisis”. But a cul- 
ture crisis 1s a soctal crisis, a crisis of the values on which society 
is founded. Work is becoming increasingly scarce due to increases 
in productivity. Unless it is shared it is hard to see how a culture 
based on industrial activity could fail to be in crisis. Sharing can give 
new meaning to the idea of development in industrial societies, by 
endowing it with an educating and civilizing function to replace 
the rigid concept of the three stages of life: youth, a time to learn; 
maturity, a time to produce; old age, a time to rest and await 
death. Tomorrow's culture must enrich all life’s activities, at every 
stage of lifc’s journey. 
In affluent societies the sense of life’s possibilities has been lost 
and must be found again. But how are we to grapple with the 
misery confronting the poor countries of the world, in which the 
gulf between rich and poor is even wider, even more unbridgeable, 
where extreme poverty can block all hope of access to stability in 
working life and to fulfilment as a human being? In these countries 
access to forms of culture that depend on investment in science, 
technology and education is usually out of the question. 
Yunus Emre, the great Turkish poet of Anatolia, whose 750th 
anniversary we celebrated last year, once wrote: “Our only enemy 
is hostility itself. We bear a grudge against no-one. For us 
humankind is indivisible.” Across the centurics, it was a man of sci- 
ence, the anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss, who was to respond 
to the poet’s message of universality through a lesson in diversity 
which he gave in a famous study prepared for UNESCO, Race and 
History: “It is diversity itself which must be saved,” he wrote, “not 
the outward and visible form in which each period has clothed that 
diversity, and which can never be preserved beyond the period 
which gave it birth. We must thercfore listen for the stirrings of new 
life, foster latent potentialities, and encourage every natural incli- 
nation for collaboration which the future history of the world may 
hold. . .. Tolerance is a dynamic attitude, consisting in the anti- 
cipation, understanding and promotion of what is struggling into 
being. We can sce the diversity of human cultures behind us, 
around us and before us.” 
It is by grasping the two handles—universality and diver- 
sity—that make up the uniqueness of culture that we may remain 
faithful to the message of the poet and the logic of the scientist.

### 95922: A Defence of the intellect

A R 
A defence of the intellect 
by Aldous Huxley 
The International Institute of 
Intellectual Co-operation, UNESCO's 
forerunner, held a meeting on “the 
future of the European mind” in 
“Paris from 16-18 October 1933 at 
which Aldous Huxley inveighed 
against the degradation of 
contemporary thought. The famous 
British novelist, who had recently 
published Brave New World (1932), 
passionately yet humorously 
defended the intellectual values 
threatened by the extension of mass 
culture. He spoke in French, the 
language in which, as he said, “the 
mind and rational goodwill of the 
age of Voltaire found expression and 
travelled from one end of Europe to 
the other” 
E are here to discuss the cur- 
rent state of the European 
mind and how to preserve 
what has been achieved by it. A look at 
contemporary intellectual life (I am 
speaking of the life of the masses, not of the 
elites) brings out two extremely impor- 
tant facts: firstly, that intelligence and its 
instrument, logic, are generally denigrated; 
and secondly, that what I may call the con- 
temporary lifestyle is remarkably vulgar 
and crude. Improving the lifestyle is desir- 
able in itself. We appreciate intuitively that 
beauty is superior to ugliness. The reaf- 
firmation of intellectual values is desir- 
able in itself, but also and especially 
because it is only in the name of intellec- 
tual values—such as truth and justice— 
that the countries of Europe can reach 
agreement. People only make sacrifices— 
and as Mr. Benda so rightly said yesterday, 
sacrifices must be made—for things they 
 
 
believe in and to which they attribute 
supreme value. 
Anti-intellectualism is already an old 
movement, and it shows itself in various 
forms—Bergsonism, Freudianism and 
Watson's behaviourism. There is no point in 
summarizing these doctrines, since 
everyone here is quite familiar with them. 
What interests us is to find out why anti- 
intellectualism has enjoyed and still enjoys 
such great popularity, and secondly how it 
can be combated. The reasons for its pop- 
ularity are, unfortunately, ail too obvious. It 
flatters men's passions, particularly lazi- 
ness: it is so difficult to reason, so easy to 
trust to instinct and intuition. If it were a 
matter of laziness the harm would not be 
very serious. But anti-intellectualism also 
flatters more dangerous passions. It is 
admirably well adapted to justifying the 
complex of hatreds and vanities that is the 
very essence of nationalism. National- 
Socialist philosophy, for example, continu- 
ally speaks of “particular truths” as opposed 
to the mundane objective truths of intel- 
lectuals. Then there are Nordic instincts, 
the infallible intuitions of blond men. 
How can we combat anti-intellectu- 
alism? How can we reinforce that faith in 
Aldous Huxley (1894-1963). 
reason without which the political unity of | 
Europe cannot be achieved? First of all there 
is logic. All anti-intellectual doctrines are 
self-destructive. For example, you may say 
with Freud that all intellectual construc- 
tions are merely rationalizations of con- 
scious or unconscious desires. Very well. 
But your own anti-intellectualist doctrine is 
one of these intellectual constructions. You 
find yourself on the horns of a dilemma: 
either your doctrine is true, in which case it 
represents no more than the expression of 
a repressed, probably sexual, desire, and 
has no objective meaning, or it has an 
objective meaning, in which case itis false. 
Unfortunately logic has very little influ- 
ence with the masses. The masses need to 
be spoken to in terms of absolute 
authority, as Jehovah spoke to the 
Israelites, or in parables, that isin terms of 
art. Children and the feeble-minded—and 
unfortunately there are many of those— 
are the only people who can be spoken to 
with authority, and that authority must 
first be possessed. The various national 
educational systems are not under our 
control, and we are not demagogues or 
rabble-rousers. So the only way we can 
influence people's minds is by persua- 
sion—that is, by art. Logic destroys anti- 
intellectualism. But the masses only accept 
this logic when it is embodied in a work of 
art. Unfortunately works of art cannot be 
produced to order, as Napoleon and the 
Bolsheviks painfully discovered. All we 
can do is hope. An intellectual artist may 
appear—and then again he may not. It is 
not within our power to create him. We 
can organize everything, except art. 
BAD LITERATURE IN INDUSTRIAL 
QUANTITIES 
I now come to the second observation we 
have made in examining the modern 
world. Our times are anti-intellectualist;

### 95922: A Defence of the intellect

I V 
they are also vulgar. The contemporary 
lifestyle is frankly disgusting. We live on a 
diet of Ponson du Terrail and Paul de Kock. 
The quite specific vulgarity of our era shows 
itself in the quite specific vulgarity of our 
popular art, which is also the cause of it. As 
nearly always happens, the movement is 
circular and vicious. What are the causes of 
this vulgarity? They are partly economic 
and demographic, partly intellectual and 
aesthetic. Industrial development and the 
development of virgin territory in the New 
World have led to a sudden expansion of 
Europe's population, which has more than 
doubled in one century. Next comes pri- 
mary education for all. An enormous poten- 
tial readership has been created, for whom 
entrepreneurs have set up a new industry— 
the reading matter industry. Now this 
reading matter could only be and will only 
be of very poor quality. Why? It is a matter 
of arithmetic. The number of writers with 
artistic talent is always very limited. So it fol- 
lows that at any time the bulk of contem- 
porary literature has always been bad. Now 
the amount of literature produced annually 
has grown faster than the population. There 
are twice as many of us today as there were 
at the beginning of the nineteenth century. 
But the number of printed words we con- 
sume each year is at least fifty—if not a 
hundred—times greater than the number 
consumed by our great-grandparents. 
Hence it follows that the percentage of bad 
literature in the total must be higher than 
ever. Europeans have got into the habit of 
reading all the time. It is a vice, like smoking 
cigarettes—or rather, perhaps, like smoking 
opium or taking to cocaine; for this litera- 
ture, which is almost all bad, is a mental 
substitute for narcotic and hallucinatory 
drugs. Europe is being fed—stuffed, one 
might say—with tenth-rate literature. 
This is completely new. In the past, 
people were only familiar directly or indi- 
rectly with a few books, but they were of 
very high quality. English people, for 
instance, until quite recently grew up with 
the Bible and Bunyan’s Pilgrim's Progress, 
both of unmatched purity and nobility of 
style. Nowadays, they grow up with the 
Daily Express, magazines and detective 
stories. Universal education has had the 
lamentable result that instead of occa- 
sionally reading masterpieces people con- 
tinually read rubbish. 
There is another very alarming phe- 
E S 
nomenon: language itself is being cor- 
rupted by advertisers. The disease is not as 
faradvanced in France as in America and 
England, where advertising has already 
tainted a great many of the noblest words. 
For example, the word “service” crops up 
again and again in English-language 
advertising. People talk about the manu- 
facture of pills and canned foods as they 
once used to talk about the work of Saint 
Francis of Assisi. A man sells you a can of 
beans with a 20 per cent net profit. Fine. 
But it is unacceptable that he should talk 
to you with clerical unction about the “ser- 
vice"—in the Christian sense of the word— 
he has done you. The same thing has hap- 
pened to many other words. Beauty, Grace, 
Adventure, Virile, Romantic—a whole 
vocabulary of splendid words has been 
used in advertising and thus made sus- 
pect. It is reaching the point where people 
cannot hear these words without imme- 
diately reacting with cynicism. It is very dif- 
ficult to separate words from the things 
they signify; and when words are tainted as 
they are every day, the values are tainted 
also. Every language is a vehicle for the 
best traditions of the race: if you ruin this 
vehicle, as advertisers are doing, you 
destroy these traditions. 
THE CATERWAULING 
OF POPULAR MUSIC 
What has happened in the realm of litera- 
ture has happened also in that of popular 
music. But here the invention of talking 
machines rather than primary education 
has created a big audience of listeners. (It 
is, by the way, the invention of the rotary 
press that has led to the current growth 
of the literature industry.) Listening matter 
is needed for this huge audience: it is man- 
ufactured, and inevitably it is of very poor 
quality. But in the case of popular music 
things are complicated by aesthetic mat- 
ters. For the last 130 years musicians have 
greatly developed the technical means 
used to express their feelings. Beethoven 
created a whole repertoire of technical 
means to express the passions—means 
unknown to even his most brilliant pre- 
decessors. The enrichment of musical 
technique progressed throughout the 
nineteenth century. Berlioz, Wagner, Verdi, 
the Russians, Debussy—all contributed 
new means of expression to the common 
Text selected and presented 
by Edgardo Canton 
stock. Naturally the feelings these com- 
posers aimed to express did not always 
have the purity and nobility that charac- 
terize Beethoven's. Wagner, especially, gave 
music the power to express—and with 
great power of artistic persuasion—things 
that are fundamentally despicable. Popular 
composers have learned their craft from 
the great artists. Thanks to Beethoven, 
Berlioz, Wagner, Rimski-Korsakov and 
Debussy, they are now in a position to 
express with gripping power the basest 
emotions—the most abject sentimentality, 
the most animal sexuality and the most 
frenetic collective joy... . 
The disease is not completely curable, 
but I believe it can be mitigated, firstly 
through education. We pay too little atten- 
tion to the development of taste and a crit- 
ical faculty; or if we try to develop them, we 
always choose remote, outdated exam- 
ples. If I had to teach young people the 
art of telling beauty from ugliness, the real 
from the imitation, I would try to choose 
my examples from the contemporary 
world. I would focus their critical facul- 
ties on politicians’ speeches and on adver- 
tising. I would get them to hear the dif- 
ferences in quality between a piece of jazz 
and one of Beethoven's late quartets. I 
would get them to read some detective 
story, and then Crime and Punishment or 
The Possessed. 
So much for what can be organized. But 
there are also forces that cannot be orga- 
nized, and this brings us back again to art. 
Iffine art remains pure, all is not lost. There 
will always be an elite to respond to the 
appeal of this art, to let itself be shaped by 
it, to experience its style. Artists have an 
enormous responsibility. It is for them, 
especially now that organized religions have 
lost their power, to undertake the task of 
restating, revivifying and preserving spiri- 
tual values. If they compromise with the 
world, in the Christian sense of the word, 
they lose not only their artistic souls but 
also the souls of a whole potential elite. H +4 3

### 95927: International Volunteer Day

International 
Volunteer Day 
by Bill Jackson 
ACH year since it was established 
on the initiative of the United 
Nations Volunteers Programme 
(UNV) in 1985, International Volunteer 
Day has been celebrated in at least 
ninety countries to honour the millions 
of volunteers all over the world who give 
their time to help their fellow human 
beings. 
At a point when the trend in many 
countries is to cut back on social ser- 
vices they once provided, international, 
national and local volunteer organiza- 
tions in both the North and the South are 
playing a vital role. 
In one developed country—Aus- 
tralia—the New South Wales Volunteer 
Centre describes volunteers as “the 
people who deliver meals, serve at 
school canteens, raise funds to buy com- 
munity equipment, run clubs, watch 
neighbourhoods, fight bush fires, 
operate drop-in centres and carry outa 
host of other services which the com- 
munity demands but could often not 
afford without the free help they pro- 
vide.” 
In developing countries it is some- 
times asked whether there is any real 
need for international volunteers and 
whether volunteering may not be an 
+4 outdated import from colonial times. 
Sadly, one has only to witness the degree 
of need and suffering in countries such 
as Angola, Somalia and Bosnia to realize 
how much there is for such volunteers to 
do. 
Some 120 countries on the long haul 
to development are happy to welcome 
specialists from the UN Volunteers Pro- 
gramme and other international bodies 
that work side by side with local orga- 
nizations. “It is a matter of pride,” said 
the governor of the Punjab (Pakistan) 
on International Volunteer Day 1992, 
“that nearly 3,500 voluntary social wel- 
fare agencies, comprising hundreds of 
Top, a UN Volunteer (at left of photo) 
supervises the unloading of sacks of grain in 
Afghanistan. Above, two Volunteers, one 
British and one Dutch, explain the electoral 
process to Cambodian villagers through an 
interpreter before the elections of May 
1993. With the help of almost 50,000 
specially trained Cambodians, 465 
Volunteers from 45 countries carried out a 
programme of civic education, registered 
4.7 million voters and supervised the polling 
stations.

### 95927: International Volunteer Day

thousands of dedicated and selfless 
workers all over the Punjab, are engaged 
in voluntary social service and as such 
supplementing government's efforts in 
every conceivable field.” 
The past two years have brought 
major changes for international orga- 
nizations that, like UNV, send volun- 
teers all over the world. The sheer scale 
and frequency of famines and refugee 
crises have required programmes that 
had been almost exclusively devoted to 
long-term development to set up spe- 
cialist humanitarian relief units. 
The current trend is towards having 
volunteers who serve in developing 
countries concentrate on helping local 
communities to manage their resources 
to the best effect. Thus we can expect to

UNEsco Director-General Federico

Programme Executive Co-ordinator 
Brenda Gael McSweeney have launched 
a joint appeal calling for the develop- 
ment of international volunteering, 
Noting that “Volunteers are urgently 
needed change-agents and peace- 
builders,” they call on “governments, 
United Nations agencies, non-govern- 
mental organizations and decision- 
makers everywhere to take advantage 
of International Volunteer Day to intro- 
duce practical measures to promote and 
facilitate voluntary service. There was 
never greater need, nor opportunity, to 
mobilize volunteers for international 
programmes of all kinds. Volunteers are 
an unparalleled source of energy, action 
and hope. Their efforts must be encour- 
aged in every way possible, so that they 
make the world a better place and 
inspire the next generation by their 
example.” [|

### 95928: The Painted caves of Mogao

The painted caves of 
Mogao 
ITH its paths shaded by slender 
poplars and its cool, swift- 
flowing streams, the oasis of 
‘Dunhuang is an island of greenery in an 
otherwise arid landscape on the edge of 
the Gobi and Takla Makan deserts in 
China's Gansu province. Some twenty-five 
kilometres to the southeast are the famous 
Mogao caves—492 temples and sanctu- 
aries hewn into a 1,600-metre-long stretch 
of a sheer cliff overlooking the Dachuan 
river. They are a unique record of a period 
when Buddhist culture in China was at its 
height, and the Tang dynasty, which 
reigned from 618 to 907, was at the apogee 
of its power. In 1987 they were placed on 
UNEsco’s World Heritage List. 
The area’s history is closely associated 
with the first Chinese raids against the 
nomads of central Asia at a time when the 
struggle to control trade routes and the 
Hexi corridor sparked endless clashes 
between the emperors of China and 
nomadic tribes of Huns, Mongols and 
Turks. 
A long section of the Great Wall 
defended the empire's northern border. 
Around 117 B.C. this line of fortifications 
housed two garrisons, one of which, based 
at Dunhuang, was for several centuries 
the last bastion of Chinese civilization at 
the empire's westernmost frontier. Beyond 
stretched an immense salt desert so hot 
that camels were provided with patches of 
leather to protect their knees from being 
  
by José Serra-Vega 
scorched by the sand when they knelt 
down. 
I ———— 
A CULTURAL CROSSROADS 
The two busiest roads plied by merchants 
travelling from the West to China followed 
the lines of oases that stretched to the 
north and south of central Asia. One fol- 
lowed the course of the Tarim river on the 
edge of the Takla Makan desert; the other 
ran through the oases fed by melting ice 
from the Kunlun mountain range. Both 
converged on Dunhuang. 
Dunhuang is strategically situated at 
an intersection of the Silk Roads which 
from the time of the Han dynasty (206 
B.C.-220 A.D.) brought China into contact 
with the Indo-Iranian civilizations and 
Mediterranean Europe. For more than a 
thousand years it was a busy frontier post 
and trading settlement where caravans 
came and went. It was also an active Bud- 
dhist centre. 
AtDunhuang travellers wearied by the 
harsh climate and attacks by desert looters

found a garrison to protect them, com- 
fortable taverns and hospitable young 
women. They could deposit or borrow 
money and hire camels for the 1,700-kilo- 
metre trip to the capital of the empire. 
There were warehouses where they could 
store their merchandise and many 
craftsmen were ready to serve them. Pay- 
ment could be made in gold, currency, 
textiles or grain. Debtors were penalized 
with high interest rates and, in serious 
cases, confiscation of their property. 
A RELIGIOUS MICROCOSM 
Cut off from the rest of the empire for long 
periods of time, Dunhuang was a cos- 
mopolitan enclave thronged with way- 
farers of diverse origins and callings. The 
intensity of its economic life was matched 
by the religious activities of the monks 
and missionaries who gathered there— 
Buddhists, Manichaeans, Nestorians and 
Muslims. 
Buddhism originated in India during 
the fifth century B.C. and reached China 
during the Han dynasty. But Buddhist cul- 
ture, thought and art only began to spread 
extensively throughout central Asia when 
it was encouraged by the rulers of the 
Kushan empire during the first four cen- 
turies of the Christian era. The Mogao 
caves are just one link—albeit the most 
famous—in a long chain of Buddhist cave-

## [Page 47](095767engo.pdf#page=47) 0

### 95928: The Painted caves of Mogao

temples stretching from Afghanistan to 
the heart of China. 
According to an inscription deciphered 
at Dunhuang, the first cave may have been 
hewn on the orders of a monk named 
Luzun in 361 A.D.—almost a century 
before Buddhism was recognized as 
China’s official religion in 444 A.D. This 
was the first step in the construction of 
the huge cave-temple complex, a task that 
took nearly a thousand years (from the 
fifth to the fourteenth centuries). 
Throughout this period, missionary 
monks who journeyed along the Silk Roads 
from India to convert China to Buddhism 
would meet Chinese monks and pilgrims 
travelling in the opposite direction, seeking 
the roots of their religion in India. To avoid 
the Himalayas the pilgrims had to make a 
long and dangerous detour through a vast 
expanse of unsafe or hostile territory. They 
trekked westward across the deserts and 
high plateaux of Tian Shan, the Pamirs 
and the Hindu Kush before reaching the 
Ganges valley. After purifying themselves 
in the river's sacred waters at Benares and 
visiting the site of the Buddha's Enlight- 
enment at Bodh Gaya, the travellers would 
study Sanskrit and learn about the mys- 
teries of Buddhist thought before setting 
out on their return journey laden with 
relics and holy books. 
A TREASURE TROVE OF BUDDHIST ART 
The Mogao caves bear witness to a number 
of important episodes in the history of 
central Asia. The Tang dynasty’s powerful 
grip on the Silk Roads during the seventh 
century is reflected in colossal statues of 
the Buddha and in frescoes illustrating 
transcendental doctrines. Tantric themes 
began to appear when the site was occu- 
pied by Tibetans between 790 and 851, 
increasing in number after the conquest of 
Gansu by the Tangut and the proliferation 
of lamaistic sects under the Western Hsia 
dynasty, which ruled from 1036 to 1227. 
This ensemble of statues and paintings 
deeply rooted in the events of Chinese 
history is also a treasure trove of a thou- 
sand years of Buddhist art. Each temple is 
entered through a chapel leading to a wide 
corridor. The lofty roofs are conical. Mag- 
nificent frescoes depict the birth, life and 
death of the Buddha and his successive 
incarnations; impressive processions of 
bodhisattvas and other Buddhist saints; 
dancing angels and magicians; disciples 
and believers; palaces and monasteries in 
the midst of awe-inspiring landscapes; 
dragons, elephants, wild beasts and bou- 
quets and garlands of flowers. 
The caves are covered by some 45,000 
square metres of splendid frescoes and 
house over 2,400 painted statues of out- 
standing refinement and beauty. 
 
A portrait of King Uygur, 
the principal donor of Cave 409 (Western 
Hsia dynasty), shows him holding a 
perfume-burner as he steps forward to pay 
tribute to Buddha. 
The paintings and sculptures display 
-an elegant blend of Hindu, Persian, Indo- 
Hellenic and Greco-Roman influences 
combined with characteristic features of 
Chinese art, which are prevalent in the 
treatment of architecture, landscape, 
clothing, facial expressions and women’s 
hair styles. 
The thousand or so caves must have 
been a spectacular site at the height of their 
splendour during the ate seventh and early 
eighth centuries. Some were perhaps the 
work of private individuals, but most of 
them must have been financed by pow- 
erful political clans whose exploits are com- 
memorated by carved stelae. Others were 
made by Buddhist communities dedicated 
to the worship of the household god and 
other divinities, to providing aid after nat- 
ural disasters, and to the organization of 
spring banquets, funerals and cultural activ- 
ities of various kinds. 
Invasions, the turbulent history of 
medieval China and natural wear-and- 
tear have taken their toll of the temples. 
Looting and profanation were only halted 
in recent times. The effigies of the Buddha 
were coated with soot and smoke when 
troops of the White Russian army 
retreating from Siberia spent the winter 
of 1920 in the caves. Considering the van- 
dalism they have suffered, it is a miracle 
that nearly half of them have survived. 
Since 1949, the Dunhuang Cultural Relics 
Research Institute has been engaged in on- 
site conservation, research and analysis, 
and the only invaders have been tourists. 
In the late nineteenth century the dis- 
asters and strife that engulfed China 
brought a flood of refugees to Dunhuang. 
In 1900 a Taoist monk named Wang Yuan 
Lu (Wang Gulu) attempted to restore one 
of the Mogao temples with his own slender 
resources, discovering in the process a 
walled-up hiding place where monks had 
hidden some 30,000 manuscripts and 
relics when the site was invaded by the 
Xias in 1036. 
The British explorer Sir Aurel Stein 
(1862-1943) heard of the discovery while 
on an expedition to the Takla Makan oases 
and in 1907 he visited Dunhuang and 
studied the documents with mounting 
excitement. The earliest text was a treatise 
on Buddhist canon law translated by Xuan 
Zhang, the most famous of the Buddhist 
pilgrims who visited India during the sev- 
enth century. With it were fifth-century 
scrolls written in Brahmi script, Tibetan 
religious texts, paintings on silk and reli- 
gious banners. To general indifference, 
3,000 scrolls and 6,000 manuscripts, 
objects and paintings made their way to 
the British Museum in London. 
Aurel] Stein was the first of along line of 
visitors to the caves. The French sinologist 
Paul Pelliot examined some 20,000 old 
documents by candlelight at the incredible 
rate of a thousand per day until over- 
whelmed by fatigue and by dust from the 
ancient manuscripts. He discovered 
Tibetan manuscripts preserved between 
two boards knotted together, Buddhist 
poems, folktales, accounting ledgers and 
other texts in Chinese, Sogdian, Uighur, 
Khotanese, Kushan, Sanskrit, Hebrew and 
Syriac. Some 4,000 of these documents 
were removed to the Guimet Museum in 
Paris. 
When they heard of the interest for- 
eigners were showing in the Chinese her- 
itage, the authorities in Beijing ordered 
10,000 documents to be brought to the 
capital, but they were transported in such 
unsatisfactory conditions that many of 
them were lost en route. Others reap- 
peared in Berlin, Saint Petersburg and 
Kyoto. Shortly afterwards, the market was 
flooded with copies produced in Tianjin. 
This extraordinary collection, now dis- 
persed, is vital evidence of the history of 
Asia and especially of the spread of Bud- 
dhism in China under the Tang dynasty. 
The documents and the cave-temples 
where they were found are also the most 
spectacular illustration of the cultural and 
artistic exchanges that took place along 
the Silk Roads. |

BOOKS OF THE WORLD 
by Calum Wise 
PAROLES DEVOILEES. 
An anthology of contemporary Turkish 
short stories by women writers. 
Edited by Nedim Giirsel. 
278 pp. Arcantére/UNesco Publishing. 
Unesco Collection of Representative 
Works. (In French). 
‘Women’s writing is a specific form of 
writing,” claims Nedim Gtirsel in her fore- 
word to this anthology—although no-one, 
in Turkish or any other language, has ever 
been able to define exactly what it is. One 
is on much firmer ground if one asserts 
that there is a specific Turkish women’s 
literature (that is, one written by women). 
This book is a proof of it. The authors of the 
stories in Paroles dévoilées (“Unveiled 
Words”) are outside the currents of militant 
feminism and a modern, theoretical 
approach to literature. Rather, their work 
provides an intimate, introspective 
glimpse of family life. They remain rooted 
in Turkish soil (like Yasar Kemal's Mehmed) 
and in contemporary Turkish life, yet their 
world has affinities with those of Katherine 
Mansfield and Virginia Woolf. 
There have been Turkish women writers 
who were militant socialists and repub- 
lican activists, but the sixteen authors 
selected here by Nedim Giirsel are not 
among them. All but one were born 
between 1925 and 1957, making them the 
heirs and beneficiaries of Mustafa Kemal 
Ataturk’s Republic, which was founded in 
1923. As if to give this first generation of 
women writers a certain amount of sym- 
bolic significance, the collection opens with 
a short story by Halide Edip Adivar, an early 
twentieth-century “ideological” novelist. 
The harsh yet sensitive tone of these short 
stories, often narrated in the first person, 
introduces the reader to.an objective fic- 
tional world where the events of everyday 
life upstage political and national ones.

Last year, UNESCO organized a series of 
events to mark the “Fifth Centenary of the 
Encounter between Two Worlds”, com- 
memorating the European discovery of 
America. The Unesco Courier devoted its

May issue, entitled “Rediscovering 1492", 
to the subject. The articles described var- 
ious aspects of the encounter as well as 
its intellectual, cultural and artistic reper- 
cussions, which have radically changed 
our view of the world. One of the authors 
concluded by suggesting that we should 
“begin preparing now for the fifth cente- 
nary of...1992. 
Two other contributors to that issue 
of the Courier, Fernando Ainsa and Edgar 
Montiel, were probably thinking of both 
present and future generations when they 
put together this anthology of Spanish- 
and Portuguese-langnage verse by ninety- 
seven poets spanning nearly five centuries. 
The volume contains works by interna- 
tionally-known figures who have been 
translated into many languages, such as 
Asturias, Borges, Garcia Lorca, Lope de 
Vega, Camdoes, Neruda and Paz, as well as 
poems by writers whose reputation is 
mainly confined to their own countries. A 
number of anonymous Guarani, Quechua 
and Nahuatl works are also included. 
Clearly there is a logic in this selection. It 
seeks to engage readers’ emotions as well 
as their intellects by presenting a broad 
spectrum of talents and sensibilities 
focused on a central theme: America, the 
source of one of the great myths of the 
modern Western world—that of the land of 
plenty.* 
AN ELUSIVE EAGLE SOARS 
An anthology of modern Albanian 
poetry. 
Texts selected, translated and 
presented by Robert Elsie. 
213 pp. Forest Books/UNesco. UNEsco 
Collection of Representative Works. 
Albanian is currently spoken by some six 
million people in the Balkans. The lan- 
guage is actually divided into two dialects, 
with Gheg in use to the north and Tosk to 
the south of the Shkumbin River, along 
whose course ran the Roman Via Egnatia, 
an extension of the Appian Way. The lit- 
erary language, which has become stan- 
dard throughout Albania as well as in 
Kosovo and Macedonia, is a mixture of 
both dialects, although approximately 80 
per cent of it is based on Tosk. The earliest 
vernacular texts date back to the Counter- 
Reformation, and the oldest known 
Albanian poem was written in 1592. 
Modern Albanian poetry came into exis- 
tence during the 1930s, when Lasgush 
Poradeci and Migjeni broke with the tra- 
dition of romantic nationalism that had 
dominated the genre until then. As Robert 
Elsie points out in his introduction, “the 
twentieth century arrived late in Albania.” 
The break with socialist realism was 
another turning point. The new departure 
sparked a lively literary debate pitting tra- 
ditionalist and innovative currents—the 
latter led by Ismail Kadare—against each 
other. This anthology recounts the difficult 
birth and stormy history of modern 
Albanian poetry with a representative selec- 
tion of verse written by poets within and 
outside the country. It includes a helpful 
introduction as well as an extensive bibli- 
ography of works published in five lan- 
guages. Mimoza Ahmeti (born 1963), is the 
youngest poet whose work appears in the 
collection. She wrote, “It would be awful/ 
Waking up the same every morning/But it 
would be even worse/Seeing the end of the 
day/With morning eyes”. [| 
* See The Discovery of Guiana, by Sir Walter Raleigh, 
who was a buccaneer in the service of Queen Eliz- 
abeth I of England, as well as an explorer. His 
account was largely responsible for the spread and 
success of this myth in Europe. This year, UNESCO 
and Editions Retz (Paris) are publishing the first 
unabridged French translation of Raleigh's work 
under the title El Dorado.

At a time when the great 
jazz divas—Billie Holiday, 
Dinah Washington, Sarah

either dead or retired, it’s 
encouraging to see that a new 
generation of singers is getting 
ready to take over. Gabrielle 
Goodman is one of them. 
Travelin’ Light is her first 
recording. Goodman, who 
started out singing gospel and 
classical music, is astonishingly 
smooth and natural. Her 
ascents to the upper end of the 
scale bring to mind the 1970s 
pop singer Minnie Ripperton. 
This is a splendid piece of work, 
with inventive backing from 
musicians Mike Cain and 
Anthony Cox, who often 
perform together, and Kevin 
Eubanks and Gary Thomas, 
who are well known for their 
love of experimentation and 
their refusal to make 
concessions to commercialism.

Accompanied by clapping,

community of the pearl divers,

number of white singers from 
the southern United States who 
flourished in the 1920s and 
1930s. The performers are 
unknown to the general public 
even in their own country, yet 
they laid the foundations for 
the work of an entire 
generation of folk and 
hootenanny singers, including 
Arlo Guthrie and Bob Dylan. It 
is often hard to tell the 
difference between them and 
the black bluesmen by whom 
they were strongly influenced. 
With their nasal voices and 
rustic instruments, they also 
form part of the hillbilly 
tradition. Some comic pieces, 
such as “Adam and Eve”, 
performed by Mr. and Mrs. 
Chris Bouchillon, came out of 
vaudeville, which declined with 
the growth of the record and

Erato CD 4509-21712-2. 
The Russian critic and 
impresario Sergei Diaghilev 
commissioned Ravel to 
compose this splendid three- 
part “choreographic 
symphony”, which is one of his 
major works. The scenario is by 
Michel Fokine, then the 
choreographer of Diaghilev’s 
Ballets Russes. The lush 
timbres and tonal colours 
create a magical, dreamlike 
atmosphere and an 
extraordinary sensuality. “My 
aim in writing it,” said Ravel, 
“was to compose a vast musical 
fresco less concerned with 
archaism than with fidelity to 
the Greece of my dreams, a 
Greece, moreover, that is fairly 
close to that imagined and 
painted by late eighteenth- 
century French artists”. This is 
an outstanding version by the 
London Symphony Orchestra 
and Chorus, sensitively 
conducted by Kent Nagano.

with this brilliant performance 
of two Schubert sonatas that

1828 as the second part of a 
trilogy that became famous. 
These charming works, in 
which Schubert has freed 
himself from Beethoven's - 
influence and already 
anticipates Bruckner, cast a 
spell whose effects linger in the 
memory.

Les Caractéres de la Danse. 
Le tombeau de M. de Lully 
Les Musiciens du Louvre, Marc 
Minkowski 
Musifrance CD 2292-45974-2. 
This recording is an 
‘opportunity to enjoy the 
little-known work of Jean-Féry 
Rebel, a pupil of Lully. Rebel is 
best remembered for his 
courtly music and dances, but 
his works are more profound 
than their titles suggest. Les 
Elémens opens with with a 
bold, gripping, almost 
Wagnerian “Cahos” which, 
wrote the Mercure de France in 
1738, “in the estimation 
of the greatest Connoisseurs is 
one of the most beautiful 
symphonic works that exist in 
this genre”. Rebel himself said, 
“Ihave dared to link the idea of 
the confusion of the Elements 
with that of confusion in 
harmony”. His undertaking 
is totally successful. The 
lightness of the delightful 
“Rossignols” and the two 
“Tambourins” from the same 
suite is in marked contrast with 
the introductory “Cahos”. The 
second part of the recording, 
Les Caracteres de la Danse, 
consists of a series of dances 
entitled “Bourrée”, “Chaconne”, 
“Sarabande”, and “Rigaudon”. 
They are less unusual than Les 
Elémens, but just as 
captivating. |
