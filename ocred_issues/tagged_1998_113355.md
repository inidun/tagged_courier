### 113356: Hopes and dreams of Algeria's youth

Hopes and dreams 
of Algeria’s youth 
by Dalila Taleb” 
  
  
How can the new generation of Algerians afford the luxury of a carefree youth? 
It isn’t easy to be young in Algeria, a 
country where five years of violence have 
claimed nearly 100,000 lives and economic 
upheavals are having drastic social 
consequences. In spite of everything, 
today’s young Algerians refuse to abandon 
their hopes and dreams

aspirations are no more than dreams. 
Working, travelling, planning for the 
future, making a home—even the simple 
things of life are beyond the reach of 
young people whose world has been 
mangled by violence. And yet they 
refuse to abandon their dreams and this 
impels many of them to leave the coun- 
try, even if it means becoming illegal 
immigrants in Europe. 
Like everyone else, young people

Dalila the militant 
hirty-two-year-old Dalila 
Taleb already has a long 
career of political activism 
behind her. The October 1988 
riots in Algiers, in which more 
than 500 young people died, 
filled her with passion to 
defend her country’s youth, 
tragically left to fend for itself. 
In 1993, with a group of 
friends, she founded the Youth 
Action Movement (RAJ) which 
was an overnight success. 
Dalila, its president, quickly 
became one the most popular 
figures among the youth in 
the poorer sections of the 
capital. The RAJ's members 
range from girls wearing the 
veil to pop music fans, from 
Islamist supporters to moder- 
nizers. And the movement 
works, despite the constraints 
and problems confronting 
voluntary organizations in 
Algeria. Without losing touch 
with the grassroots, Dalila 
went into politics and in the 
1997 parliamentary elections 
became an opposition FFS 
(Front of Socialist Groups) 
member of the National Peo- 
ple’s Assembly representing 
her home town of Bejaia. In 
the Assembly, where she is a 
member of the youth, sports 
and voluntary work commis- 
sion, she has made a name for 
herself as an orator who 
speaks out against all kinds of 
violence and arbitrary beha- 
viour— whoever its perpetra- 
tors may be. |

from insecurity. Many now cannot 
even study-hundreds of schools have 
closed in the worst affected areas such 
as Blida, Medea and Chlef. Social vio- 
lence is also soaring. The government 
is in many ways ineffective and daily 
life has become so difficult that parents 
can no longer minister to their chil- 
dren’s needs. Some 300,000 young 
people come onto the job market every 
year in a country where there are 
already more than two million unem- 
ployed. The middle class is shrinking, 
the poor are getting poorer and the 
rich are getting richer. The streets of 
the capital teem with young children 
selling newspapers or cleaning car win- 
dows—-scenes which 
money. The government pleads secu- 
rity reasons for restricting the activities 
of civil society. But preventing young 
people from expressing themselves pea- 
cefully can only push them towards 
violent forms of self-expression or even 
to extremism. 
They dream of escaping a “sick life” 
which weighs even more heavily on 
girls than boys. In big towns, coeduca- 
tion has survived the recent years of 
troubles fairly well. But everything is 
harder for girls. It’s hard for them to 
go out in an evening with boys, unless 
they belong to a very restricted social 
circle. As a result of a profoundly sexist 
education system, it’s hard for them to 
learn anything at

inconceivable a few 
years ago. 
If they can’t live 
normal lives, young 
Algerians can at least

Algiers, but the state of emergency is 
still in force and public gatherings are

staged these days are expensive. A 
black-market ticket costs 800 dinars* 
when the minimum wage is about 
5,000 dinars, and only about one 
young person in twenty can afford to 
go. Cinemas are closing. Film clubs 
have disappeared. Young people don’t

Young people dream of peace. They 
feel alienated by the violence that 
confronts them. Talk to them about 
peace and their enthusiasm is imme- 
diately aroused. Young musicians have 
written some amazing songs about 
peace. Others express themselves 
through theatre or painting. In the

All that needs to be done is to bring 
them together and involve them in a 
common project. For many young 
people feel frustrated that there is 
nothing they can do to bring about 
change. 
They dream of peace, but like the 
rest of the population they are caught 
between the violence of Islamist extre- 
mists and that of the government. In 
Algeria,sadly, difference is synonymous 
with intolerance. Hatred between the 
sexes, between different ways of looking 
at things, between regions, between 
Arabs and Berbers has been boiling for 
decades, turning Algeria’s magnificent 
diversity into an endless source of 
conflict. Algerians have barely had time 
to develop democratic practices. 
Without jobs, without being able to 
envisage a better life and without hope, 
young people lounge idly in the 
streets—“hugging the walls,” as Alge- 
rians put it, nicknaming them “hittists” 
(from the Arabic word hit, meaning 
“wall”). The young dream, but their 
dreams turn into nightmares because

### 113357: Progress for whom?

Progress for whom? 
t is too often forgotten that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is not only 
concerned with civil and political rights but also with what are known as economic 
and social rights. In the preamble to the Declaration, it is stipulated that “Freedom 
from fear and want” is “the highest aspiration of the common people.” It is no coin- 
cidence that the Declaration dates from the period when the foundations of the Uni- 
ted Nations system were laid and the Marshall Plan was launched. At that time it was 
possible to dream; pain and precarity were conducive to utopia; it was a time when a 
common horizon could be redrawn. 
Today, the civilization and culture of which we are so proud will break down 
unless we can stabilize and halt population growth, narrow the gap between rich and 
poor, and create decent living conditions—education, public health, work, housing—for 
the billions of people who share this beautiful planet. 
UNESCO believes that in order to successfully take up the challenge of poverty, 
four basic principles must be taken into account. 
- Development of endogenous capacities. This means giving each country, each 
. people and each person the capacity to decide for themselves, to make their own 
Federico Mayor choices, to exploit on their own account the natural resources around them. This 
imperative has a name: co-operation. It is something quite different from technical and 
other forms of assistance, such as they have been implemented hitherto. 
- Improvement of the quality of life in rural areas. If, in peacetime, we manage to 
mobilize all resources, including those of the armed forces, then this quality of life will 
reach the point at which immigration, primarily to the poverty belts around the big 
cities and then towards foreign countries, will disap- 
pear or at least diminish. 
   
 UNEsco/Ines Forbes 
 
If the rich countries have been incapable of - Citizenship and participation, especially at the 
local level. This is where democracy is cemented and 
devoting 0.7 per cent of their GNP to the where the guidelines traced by governments should be 
development of the most disadvantaged implemented by all citizens. It is here too that 
UNESCO envisages an extraordinary development of 
countries, how can we hope to bring {0 new jobs, new ways of taking part in working life, espe- 
iti : ially in envi 1 fruition the common enterprise known as “7 “lviont ene marie net 
- Continuing and out-of-school education. This is 
sustainable development? important for its own sake, of course, but also for the 
 global nexus of information and communication that is 
indispensable in today’s world. No one should be able 
to say that the train has left without them. Everyone must have an opportunity, in the 
course of their lives, to climb back onto the train of education, dignity, training and 
democracy. This possibility is one of the basic principles of the culture of peace. 
But if the rich countries have been incapable of devoting 0.7 per cent of their 
GNP to the development of the most disadvantaged countries, how can we hope to 
bring to fruition the common enterprise known as sustainable development? How 
can this be done when, until not so long ago, development was regarded as little more 
than economic growth, when the idea prevailed that a country would become modern 
and its people would have a better life if it increased its industrial output or its rate of 
electricity consumption? The inevitable corollary of that mistake is to impose models 
of development from the outside on the peoples who must apply them, taking no 
account of their specific historical, cultural or psychological background. The most 
immediate consequence of this approach is the gigantic moral and material cost paid 
by many countries subjected to measures of macro-economic adjustment. Paradoxi- 
cally, this sometimes leads to the bolstering of military regimes, the weakening of 
civil society and the retreat of democracy because the problems which it causes extend 
the repressive apparatus of the state. 
Of course the development process includes a quantitative and economic compo- 
nent. But, as the Spanish philosopher Julidn M arias once said, “nothing that is human 
is purely quantitative”. Progress does not consist of the accumulation of objects, 
nuclear missiles, automobiles or computers. It is indissociable from morality, from a 
teleological dimension of existence. When we ask questions about progress, the first 
question is not “how much or how many?” but “for whom?” [|

for worse? 
eeding the world is one of the big 
challenges of the next century. 
Paradoxically, whereas the planet’s 
farmers actually produce more food than 
world population needs, about 800 mil- 
lion people are chronically undernouri- 
shed and two billion suffer from malnu- 
trition, nearly all of them in the poor 
countries of the South. 
The number of mouths to feed is 
expected to increase by almost 100 mil- 
lion annually in the next thirty years. A 
worldwide shortfall in production is not 
yet the main cause of hunger, but output 
will have to be stepped up in the first half 
of the next century. 
The area of cropland will certainly 
have to be expanded, but a limit will 
quickly be reached. Biodiversity is 
already under threat; deforestation causes 
erosion and impoverishes soil, irrigation 
leads to salinization and water resources 
are shrinking. Today farmers are also 
required to respect the environment and 
the health of consumers. In the 1960s, 
the “green revolution” was about maxi- 
mizing production by using massive 
quantities of fertilizers, pesticides and 
other inputs. The downside of this race 
to boost output was that it generated 
pollution. 
Massive inputs did not eliminate crop 
losses, which are still considerable, run- 
ning in the early 1990s to 42 per cent of 
all the wheat, rice and maize harvested 
worldwide. Would it not be best to enable 
plants to fight diseases and pests by 
themselves? This is the proposal of the 
transgenic revolution which is currently 
sweeping the world of agriculture. 
In 1953 James Watson (USA) and 
Francis Crick (UK) discovered the spi- 
ral structure of deoxyribonucleic acid 
(DNA), but it was not until thirty years 
later that the first gene transfer was 
made, in the laboratory, on a tobacco 
plant. The first field tests were conducted 
in 1987 and the technique then took off. 
A decade later, genetically modified 
crops were growing on 15 million hec- 
tares of land around the globe. In 1998,

could become the backbone of tomorrow’s agriculture. For better or 
  
 
    
Cloning plants in sterile conditions in the Dominican Republic. 
United States farmers alone sowed 20 
million hectares of genetically modified 
maize, soya and cotton. Argentina and 
Brazil have accepted genetically modified 
organisms (GMOs), and so have China 
and Australia. By the year 2000, geneti- 
cally modified crops are expected to be 
growing on 60 million hectares world- 
wide-81 per cent of them in North Ame- 
rica, 10 per cent in 
Asia and one per cent 
species.” Genetic modification makes 
light of all these barriers. Theoretically 
gene transfer makes all kinds of things 
possible. Plants are already capable of 
producing haemoglobin, a growth hor- 
mone, and human insulin. 
The supporters of transgenic agricul- 
ture point to other advantages. If a plant 
has a gene which resists certain pests, there 
is no need for it to be 
treated with a chemical 
 
in Europe. In the Uni- 
ted States alone, they 
will comprise a $100- 
billion market over the 
next decade. 
Why this spectacu- 
lar expansion? Farmers 
have crossed different 
varieties and species 
from time immemo-

In 1998, 
United States farmers

be given a gene to make

change its taste or nutri-

with transnational firms like Monsanto, 
Novartis, AgrEvo, Dupont, Pioneer or

concern 
Several hundred of 
them are currently 
awaiting examination. 
Does this mean 
that Europe has not 
been won over by 
GMOs?The import of 
genetically modified 
maize and rapeseed 
has been authorized by 
to the American Bio- 
technology Industry 
Organization, things are less alarming. It 
gives examples of technology transfers 
such as the passing on to a research ins- 
titute in Indonesia of material to produce 
insect-resistant potatoes by tissue cul- 
ture, and the insertion of a fungicidal 
gene into African bananas. 
Since research in this field is very 
costly, genetically modified plants are 
usually privatized through patenting. 
Monsanto, with an annual turnover of 
more than $6.6 billion, says it spent $166 
million last year on GMO research, but 
refuses to say how many patents it 
the European Union 
since 1997 and will 
this year amount to $200 million. But 
some countries have expressed doubts. 
Austria and Luxembourg have forbidden 
imports and Italy has banned growing of 
GMOs. In April 1997, the European 
Parliament opposed the European 
Commission’s approval of such 
crops, declaring that “econo- 
mic and social pressures 
have overridden health 
and environmental 
considerations”. 
The introduction of 
antibiotic-resistant genes 
into plants is also causing concern, but there 
is no proof that such genes are passed from 
plants to animals and then to humans. In 
this case the gene acts as a marker in a gene 
transfer process. To find out whether the 
transferred gene is present in the cells, they 
are soaked in an antibiotic solution. Only 
the cells which have not accepted the resis- 
tant gene are destroyed. For example, the 
Flavr Savr tomato produced in the United 
States in 1994 contains a gene to keep it 
firm and slow the rotting process, along with 
a gene resistant to kanamycin, which is used 
to fight respiratory ailments. A single muta- 
tion of this gene also makes it resistant to 
other antibiotics used to treat meningitis 
and serious lung diseases. T he resistant gene »

Genetic modification: how it works 
  
he nucleus of each cell contains 
chromosomes made up of genes 
which govern heredity. Genes are 
sequences of long molecules arran- 
ged in the form of a double helix 
and known as DNA (deoxyribonu- 
cleic acid). DNA sees that the cell 
functions in a way specific to the 
species to which it belongs. A single 
gene can determine several charac- 
teristics, but sometimes several 
genes are needed to determine a 
single characteristic. Molecular bio- 
logists cut up the genome (the 
genetic endowment) of a given spe- 
cies, increase the number of genes 
and insert them into another spe- 
cies to obtain a new hereditary cha- 
racteristic coded by the transferred 
DNA. This is how genetically modi- 
fied organisms (GMOs) are obtai- 
ned. 
In the laboratory, though not yet 
on our plates, maize has been 
given a scorpion’s gene so that it 
can resist insects and a petunia 
gene to enable it to resist herbi- 
cides. Potatoes have been endowed 
with a gene from a chicken or a 
moth to fight disease, as well as a 
human gene to digest heavy 
metals. A fish gene can be added 
to tomatoes to help them resist the 
cold, and rice and sunflower seeds 
can be protein-enriched with genes 
taken from beans and brazil nuts 
respectively. Cucumbers fight 
disease with the help of a tobacco 
gene. All kinds of things are imagi- 
nable, if not immediately feasible: a 
gene from a bird with black fea- 
thers to colour roses, a lettuce gene 
to camouflage cows in green mea- 
dows. But beware of the hybrids 
that might escape from the lab. 
Truth may turn out to be stranger 
than science fiction! [|

Appeal 
for the 
Amazon 
an Brazilian President Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso keep his promise to save 25 mil- 
lion more hectares of Amazonian forest by the 
year 2000? The World Bank and the World 
Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) see his pledge 
made at the end of April 1998,as one of the 
first fruits of their June 1997 agreement to 
strengthen measures to protect “natural” 
forests, i.e.those largely untouched by human 
activity. 
The accord aimsto set up aworldwide net- 
work of protected areas totalling 50 million 
hectares by 2005.1t is an extension of WWF's 
campaign to bring,by the end of the century, 
10% of every type of forest (tropical Boreal, 
temperate, dry, humid) under protection from 
the pillage which isslowly eating away at the 
planet’s biodiversity. 
Only 6% of the world’s natural forests are 
legally protected at the moment, with wide 
regional variations—from 9% in Latin America 
to 2% in Europe. But often this protection only 
exists on paper. Many forests are being dama- 
ged by pollution from oilfields or mining (legal 
protection doesnot extend underground) and 
by continuing illegal activities. Eighty per cent 
of Brazil's mahogany, for example, comes from 
protected forest areas 
By promising to extend protected areas, 
Brazil, which contains a third of all the world’s 
tropical forests, has declared its determina- 
tion to break with policies which have paid 
little heed to sustainable management. 
Now the money has to be found.Brazil has 
very few means of enforcing protection and 
“there are only 300 people to monitor all of 
Amazonia,” notes WWF's Jean-Paul Jeanre- 
naud, who reckons that the project requires 
about $75 million immediately and $10 million 
a year thereafter. 
The World Bank is expected to help Brazil 
obtain contributions from the rich countries 
and the private sector. Without them, Presi- 
dent Cardoso’s promise may be an empty one.

dealt with? Science does not yet have enough 
data to answer these questions satisfacto- 
rily. 
Another unknown is the reaction to 
genetically modified bacteria of bacteria 
and fungi which act in myriad ways in 
the soil, e.g. to help plants with growth

lution products. A gram of surface soil

billion bacteria and between 1,000 and 
10,000 different species—and scientists 
say they have only investigated a tenth of 
those. Noélle Amarger of the French 
National Agronomic Research Institute

king about the ways and circumstances 
in which a micro-organism introduces 
itself successfully into the ground, stays 
there and performs its function.” So we

which it is put. Amarger concludes that 
“once they are introduced, micro-orga- 
nisms can linger for many years, even 
indefinitely, with no possibility of remo- 
ving them, so we should be cautious.” 
Have we gone ahead too fast and cast 
a basic precautionary principle to the 
winds? Fierce debate is going on between 
supporters and opponents of genetic 
modification. To give consumers a choice 
between consuming or rejecting food 
containing GMOs, clear labelling is 
necessary. This is easier said than done. 
Shipments of imported farm produce 
often contain mixtures. Unless they are

will have to carry out costly and elabo-

SOS 
whales 
H a century ago, whales nearly died 
out as a species as a result of being 
indiscriminately hunted. Then, in 1946, the 
International Convention for the Regulation 
of Whaling was signed and its management 
put in the hands of the International Wha- 
ling Commission (IWC), which recently cele- 
brated its fiftieth birthday. 
Today whale hunting has virtually cea- 
sed, except by the Japanese and the Nor- 
wegians, who kill about 1,200 minke 
whales each year out of a population of 
about a million. But although hunting may 
have been sharply curbed, whales are still 
in danger—from pollution. 
The IWC has not been able to enforce 
totally the moratorium on whaling it intro- 
duced in 1986, but the measure has 
enabled the population of great whales to 
increase. Now the Commission has taken 
on a new task—protecting the environment 
to safeguard whales, and by so doing to 
ensure its own survival. 
The commission’s 40 Member States, 
dominated by English-speaking countries, 
especially the United States, have realized 
that passing resolutions which were mostly 
ignored was not enough. Despite their 
infringements of the moratorium, Japan and 
Norway refuse to leave the commission and 
have obstructed its work, helped by several 
small Caribbean states. 
But all agreed at the IWC’'s meeting in 
Muscat (Oman) in May 1998 that a dete- 
riorating environment was now “the big- 
gest threat” to whales. The Commission’s 
scientific committee will give “the highest 
priority” to research into the impact of pol- 
lutants and chemical contamination on 
whales, as well as the effect of climate 
change on the biological and physical habi- 
tat of whales and their prey. 
The Arctic, where whale meat is now so 
contaminated it has become dangerous for 
human consumption, will be studied first. 
In recent years, scientists have found that 
whales, as animals at the end of a food 
chain, have absorbed large quantities of 
poisonous pollutants of all kinds, including 
pesticides, chlorine compounds and heavy 
metals. [|

### 113359: Colombia's community mothers

 
For years ‘community mothers’ have been helping to bring up children in 
Colombia, a country plagued by violence and poverty 
n the mid-1980s, the Colombian 
government, alarmed by very high 
rates of infant mortality and malnu- 
trition, launched a far-reaching pro- 
gramme to protect pre-school-age chil- 
dren, with the help of the United Nations 
and the Inter-American Development 
Bank. 
The first “welfare centres”, also 
known as hobis, opened in the slums of 
Cali, an industrial city of almost two mil- 
lion people, in Cartagena, whose 
550,000 inhabitants live mainly off the 
petrochemical industry, and Guspi, a 
small town in the southwest of the coun- 
try. They were run by volunteers known 
as “community mothers” who organized, 
on their own or with the help of NGOs, 
education and care facilities for about 
3,000 children. The programme initially 
reached only 7 per cent of the popula- 
tion concerned. 
Kindergartens for the children of 
working mothers appeared in Colombia 
in 1974. But a new educational model 
arrived in 1977 with “neighbourhood 
centres” based on parental and commu- 
nity participation. These centres soon 
opened their doors to very poor children, 
with the help of UNICEF and the 
Colombian Institute for Family Welfare 
(ICBF), an official body with ministerial 
1 4 The Unesco Courier - September 1998 
powers in charge of policy concerning 
the family and the protection of minors. 
In 1987, the ICBF funneled 8 per cent of 
its funds to the community mothers and 
offered them an institutional framework. 
Today, the figure is 40 per cent. 
The $55 million IC BF programme now 
reaches 60 per cent of very needy children in 
1,042 towns in a country where, according 
to figures provided by the United Nations 
Development Programme (UNDP), one 
person in five gets by on 
wage (about $130 a month) and the right 
to social security and a pension. Apart 
from food for her group (which she can 
also give to her own children), the ICBF 
provides utensils and a few staple items. 
It also grants a small loan to install sepa- 
rate washing and toilet facilities for the 
children and to improve hygiene in the 
kitchen, the eating areas, the bedrooms 
and the courtyard, where the children 
spend most of their time. About a mil-

dren through games, with an emphasis on 
social skills; using role-playing to familia- 
rize them in groups with real-life situations, 
like going shopping or visiting the doctor; 
and allowing the children to express them- 
selves by talking about their personal expe- 
riences or even describing their dreams. 
An apprenticeship 
in social skills 
The activities vary according to the age 
of the child, with the older ones being 
introduced to the main school subjects if 
the community mother is capable of 
doing this. Over the past twenty years, 
the mothers have managed, often with 
support of NGOs, to acquire more skills 
and undeniable social recognition, but 
many have not managed to finish their 
schooling, and some cannot even read. 
“There is no official certificate which 
says you can be a community mother,” 
says Lilia Labrador, the ICBF’s head of 
pre-school education, “but they have a 
chance to study to secondary school gra- 
duation level through coaching schemes 
recognized by the education ministry.” 
Before being hired, the “mothers” go 
on a short course to prepare for their 
future role and take a self-assessment 
test. Such workshops are held at inter- 
vals, allowing the participants to discuss 
their experiences and work out together 
any problems. These courses give some 
community mothers a chance to take up 
other work and skills or be chosen for 
other ICBF programmes such as family 
education or education for pregnant 
women. 
Substantial funds are needed to run 
all these activities. Apart from contribu- 
tions from international organizations, 
companies are obliged by law to chip in 
with three per cent of their total wage 
bill. Keeping tabs on that is not easy 
   
 


### 113360: Fighting for recognition

Fighting for recognition 
  
hough officially recruited by 
school parents’ associations, 
community mothers are in fact 
drawn from the ranks of very needy 
women who offer their services to 
regional ICBF offices which are 
eager to expand their network 
quickly, even if it means dealing 
later with problems of quality. 
Several hobis (welfare centres) are 
required to make up a parents’ 
association. The mothers can 
legally stand for election to an 
association’s committee but ICBF 
officials usually frown on this. In 
the early years in some regions, 
they even openly opposed it and 
refused to hire some women who 
were elected. It took many years of 
struggle before the mothers won 
recognition from ICBF officials. 
Parents and mothers often argue 
about how to use available 
resources. Some mothers have 
accused heads of parents’ associa- 
tions of dipping their fingers in the 
kitty, not replacing worn-out uten- 
sils, being unwilling to guarantee 
loans to improve their premises, 
and charging a new recruit an 
entrance fee when her predecessor 
has left without paying back her 
loan. 
At first there was a big turnover 
among the poorest mothers. They 
were drawn more by the chance of 
a house improvement loan than by 
the job itself, which proved more 
thankless than they imagined, and 
many left soon after being recrui- 
ted. Eventually, things settled 
down, after the mothers won 
battles for social security coverage 
and for better training and working 
conditions. 
The mothers were quick to set 
up their own organizations to press 
for improvements in the pro- 
gramme. The ICBF was cautious at 
first about this unionization and 
stressed publicly that the mothers 
were volunteers or employees of 
the parents’ associations and that 
their salary was a bonus. 
The mothers retorted that 
the ICBF could not duck its respon- 
sibilities, since it has chosen to 
define even the smallest details of 
the rules, closely monitoring time- 
tables, meal menus, working 
methods, punctuality, numbers pre- 
sent, hygiene and budgetary mat- 
ters, leaving very little to the 
mothers and parents. 
So a union soon sprung up, 
along with an association called 
Amcolombia. Gradually, regional 
associations grew up and dialogue 
developed between the two sides. 
This is how the mothers won the 
rights they enjoy today. |

however and evasion is widespread. So 
money has to be scraped together where- 
ver it can be found. For example, public 
law 333 of December 1996 stipulates 
that the proceeds of money, houses and 
vehicles seized from drug smugglers by 
the national narcotics authority must go 
to support street children. 
But things are not so simple. Sylviane 
Bourgeteau, representative in Bogota of a 
French watchdog on drugs, the Observa- 
toire Geopolitique des Drogues, says the 
law has “never been applied.” Apart from 
the inheritance tangles that arise after 
drug seizures, the new occupants of 
houses confiscated from drug smugglers 
often get threatened or are burgled. The 
then Colombian government even admit- 
ted on its official website last 24 March 
that despite the seizure of about 20,000 
items of property, only one such confis- 
cation had been legally confirmed. 
Also, seized property does not always

fit the practical needs of the welfare orga- 
nizations. The houses are very luxurious 
and need costly refurbishing. Sometimes 
when a bus is needed to take some chil- 
dren somewhere, the only vehicle avai- 
lable is a Rolls Royce Gucci. 
So the measure has its limits, but they 
are not insuperable. Just before public 
law 333 was passed, the ICBF managed 
to convert a former disco seized from 
drug smugglers in the chic Zona Rosa 
area of Bogota into a centre for haemo- 
philiacs. And more recently, the latest 
anti-drugs publicity campaign directed at 
young people was financed by money sei- 
zed by the national narcotics authority.

Learning to Be 
  
n 1972, a report by UNESCO's 
International Commission on 
the Development of Education 
adopted a new approach to the 
idea of education, long regar- 
ded solely as a school-centred 
activity. The report, whose title 
was Learning to Be, said that 
education should no longer be 
defined as a specific body of 
knowledge that had to be 
digested, but as a process w he- 
reby people, through the variety 
of their experiences, learn to 
express themselves, to commu- 
nicate, to question the world 
and to become themselves. This 
approach formed the basis of 
an agreement between govern- 
ments and funding agencies 
when the Declaration on Edu- 
cation for All was adopted in 
1990 at the World Conference 
on Education for All, at Jomtien, 
in Thailand. 
The traditional distinction 
between formal and non-for- 
mal education was thus super- 
seded. Informal learning, com- 
prising activities outside 
established systems, bridges 
the gap between institution- 
centred education and the 
socio-economic and cultural 
environment. It has proved its 
worth over the last 30 years 
and is now expanding rapidly.

From

he flow of thousands of experts and

rich ones is increasingly seen as a source of 
potential for the former, rather than a loss. 
Thanks to new technologies, knowledge 
now moves around the world very quickly. 
Over the past decade, many countries, 
especially in Latin America, have set up pro- 
grammes to put the knowledge of these 
“lost” experts to good use. Examples 
include: 
- The Inter-Regional Network of Latin 
American and Caribbean Scientists. Its data- 
base, created in 1994, keeps details of trai- 
ned citizens who have gone abroad. It 
responds to the technological and scientific 
needs of member countries by inviting 
these international experts to conferences. 
It will, for example, be represented at the 
regional governmental conference on 
science which will be held in October in 
Bariloche, Argentina. 
- Caldas, set up in 1991, encourages 
Colombian experts around the world to 
contribute to scientific and technological 
progress by publicizing the results of their 
research. It includes joint projects involving 
experts at home and abroad. E-mail com- 
munication is one of its main activities. 
- Talven (Venezuelan Talent Abroad), 
launched in 1994. It targets not only scien- 
tists and high-tech experts but also Vene- 
zuelans active in the arts and the humani- 
ties. Talven attempts to persuade them to 
return home not permanently, but from 
time to time. With financial backing from 
private firms and institutions, more than 
120 Venezuelans have been able to return 
and make contact with colleagues by taking 
part in seminars and workshops. This 
exchange of experiences is contributing to 
the country’s development in areas as 
diverse as Aids, computers, economics and, 
in recent months, parasitology, molecular 
biology, waste recycling and biotechnology.

n the past half century higher education has 
been transformed from a privilege conferred on 
social and political elites to a mass activity avai- 
lable to whole populations.T his process began in the 
United States in the 1940s and 1950s, spread to 
most of Western Europe and many other developed 
countries during the 1960s and 1970s and in the 
past two decades has become a global phenome- 
non.In the next half century it will accelerate,lea- 
ding perhaps to the replacement of “higher educa- 
tion” (still an elite-ish category despite its expansion) 
by extended systems of “lifelong learning”. 
The key to this transformation has been the expan- 
sion of secondary education. For example, in all but 
two countries of the OECD (Organization for Eco- 
nomic Co-operation and Development) at least two- 
thirds of young people now complete upper secondary 
education, and so are eligible to enter higher educa- 
tion. T he result has been a dramatic increase in enrol- 
ment rates in higher education. In Chile the total 
number of students has grown from 131,000 in 1978 
t0 235,000 in 1988 and to 343,000 in the mid-1990s. 
Even in the United States, the pioneer of mass-access 
higher education where very high secondary educa- 
tion completion rates had already been achieved 
before 1970, the student population has continued to 
grow, from 11 million in 1978 to 13 million in 1988 
and now to more than 14 million. 
Two forces have driven up completion rates in 
upper secondary education and enrolment rates in 
higher education. T he first has been democratization. 
As late as 1945 high levels of social, and hence edu- 
cational, inequality persisted even in democratic coun- 
tries, and much of the world remained in the grip of 
colonial and totalitarian powers. In North America, 
Western Europe and Australasia democratization typi- 
cally took the form of the development of “welfare 
states”, in which there was an increase in public expen- 
diture on education, housing, health and social secu- 
rity that was sustained over more than three decades 
after the end of the Second World War. 
More recently, as renewed emphasis has been 
placed on the market even in social policy, the rise of 
consumerism has continued to fuel demands for 
increased higher education opportunities. The older 
idea of education as a civic entitlement has been com- 
pounded by newer notions of free access to the edu- 
cation marketplace. Far from arresting the advance to 
mass higher education,consumerism has accelerated 
it in most developed countries. As traditional forms 
of social differentiation based on class, gender and eth- 
nic origin have been eroded by democratization and 
by market forces, new forms based on educational 
certification have become more important. In many 
developed countries the middle class and the “gra- 
duate class” have tended to coalesce. 
In much of Asia and Africa democratization took 
the form of decolonization. In newly independent 
countries the energy originally generated in libera- 
tion struggles against the colonial powers was direc- 
ted into a wider struggle to create fairer and more 
equal successor societies. Education was central to 
this struggle. The result has been a rapid increase in 
higher education enrolment—for example, in Tunisia 
from barely 2,000 students at the time of indepen- 
dence to more than 100,000 today. T hat process conti- 
nues. 
However, the relationship between democratiza- 
tion and the development of higher education has 
been less straightforward in developing countries. 
Despite very rapid rates of expansion the “metropo- 
litan” influences of the former colonial powers have 
lingered more stubbornly in higher education than at 
other levels of education. This is partly due to the 
continued influence of associations between univer- 
sities in the British Commonwealth as well as those 
between francophone universities. 
Partly because of these lingering “metropoli- 
tan”models and partly because levels of participa- 
tion are still lower than in developed countries,many 
African or Asian universities have remained more 
elite institutions than higher education institutions 
in North America and Europe. Also, as economic 
conditions have worsened in some developing coun- 
tries,the competition between primary and higher 
education sharpened in the post-independence years 
as both were seen as equally important priorities. 
This competition was often reinforced by the inter- 
vention of the World Bank. 
The second force driving up higher education 
enrolments has been the changing nature of the 
labour market. Traditional occupations have become 
comparatively less significant, while new service 
occupations, which often require graduate-level

## [Page 19](https://demo.humlab.umu.se/courier/113355eng.pdf#page=19) 0

### 113361: Shaking the ivory tower

skills,have become more important. 
Skill requirements have become more sophisti- 
cated. Jobs once done by unskilled or semi-skilled 
workers are now undertaken by technicians; and 
those which as recently as the 1980s were taken by 
technicians are now likely to be filled by graduates. 
The capital invested for every worker has more than 
doubled in the past 20 years. Even in occupations 
where there is less evidence that skills contents have 
changed significantly, university graduates are now 
employed in much larger numbers,partly to enhance 
the social status of these occupations and partly to 
compete in a graduate-dominated labour market. 
Healthcare is a good example. Once doctors were the 
only graduates;today, many para-medical workers 
are also trained in higher education. 
The second form taken by the economic driver 
has been the growing conviction that national suc- 
cess now depends on economic competitiveness 
which, in the context of a knowledge-based eco- 
nomy, depends in turn on an adequate supply of 
human capital. Knowledge is now seen as the key 
economic resource. 
This analysis may be exaggerated ;raw materials 
are still very important in national economies and the 
global economy. But it has become pervasive—and 
persuasive. The naive and linear theories of human 
capital popular a generation ago which postulated a 
direct link between investment in education and 
economic growth may have been challenged;some 
forms of higher education are now as likely to be 
labelled consumption as investment goods. Never- 
theless, the discourse of the “Knowledge Society” has 
become even more powerful. 
The impact of democratization and economic 
competitiveness on higher education has been 
immense. First,the expansion of student numbers 
has made the cost of higher education a significant 
element within national budgets for the first time. A 
number of important consequences has flowed from 
this—the opportunity, and incentive, to compare the 
value of investing in different levels of education; 
increasing demands that universities are run as effi- 
ciently as possible (compromising their traditional 
autonomy from the state—and the market); lower 
unit costs as budgets have been trimmed (which 
may have undermined higher education’s claim to 
represent academic excellence). Second, higher edu- 
cation systems have emerged that embrace not only 
traditional universities but also non-university ins- 
titutions. Two effects have been produced. One is that 
the ethos of the traditional university has been ero- 
ded; it no longer stands in glorious isolation. The 
other is that institutional differentiation has been 
encouraged, whether through active state planning 
or in response to markets for teaching and research. 
The prospects for the next half century are for an 
acceleration of both drivers—to include access to higher 
education among the basic entitlements enjoyed by citi- 
zens in democratic societies; and to “put knowledge to 
work” in order to generate wealth and to improve the 
quality of life. The prospects for higher education 
during the same period are also relatively easy to pre- 
dict-increased efficiency (which is likely to include 
growing pressure to make students contribute more to 
the cost of their higher education); greater accounta-

bility, although more probably in a “market” than a 
“planning” mode as even the state redefinesitsrole as 
the purchaser of higher education services; more dif- 
ferentiation, both between and within higher educa- 
tion institutions, as they struggle to identify market 
niches; and—possibly—growing demands that higher 
education become more relevant as instrumental 
considerations triumph over idealistic ones. 
However, the future may be more complex than the 
past. In the second half of the 20th century the encoun- 
ter between higher education and society has been 
comparatively straightforward. Although dynamic, 
society has presented a familiar enough face. It was cha- 
racterized by a combination of bureaucratic rationa- 
lity and secular (and liberal) individualism. T he bene- 
ficence of science and technology was uncontested. The 
dominant economic model was of large-scale indus- 
try, or analogous organizations in the corporate and 
public sectors. Although rapidly evolving, concepts 
and categories like “career” and “profession” remai- 
ned valid. Higher education too was familiar enough. 
Despite the great expansion of student numbers and 
its adoption of novel roles, the university continued to 
be recognizable as such. Other types of higher edu- 
cation institution have been deeply influenced by uni- 
versity values and practices. 
In the first half of the 21st century both society 
and higher education may become problematical 
and so contested categories. Some of these uncer- 
tainties are already emerging.Once firm demarca- 
tions between public and private domains, whether 
in terms of the balance between the state and the 
market or between social “spaces” and individual 
desires; between producers and users; between 
investment and consumption; between work and 
leisure are becoming increasingly fuzzy in the emer- 
ging post-industrial society. Wealth is being generated 
by the production of “symbolic” as well as—or more 
than-material goods. Value is created by design, 
sales,marketing, service rather than by primary pro- 
duction. Institutions of all kinds, civic and corporate, 
are being challenged by the rise of adaptable and 
flexible organizations, made possible by advances in 
communications and information technology. 
The force of globalization amounts to much 
more than round-the-clock round-the-world finan- 
cial markets or an emerging international division of 
labour;it isnot only undermining nation states but 
also reconfiguring time and space to produce global 
intimacies, again with the help of the information 
revolution. Social identities are no longer moulded 
by the “givens” of religion, class and gender,or by 
positions within the occupational structure, as they 
have been since the advent of the industrial revolu- 
tion in Europe two centuries ago. Instead they are 
being subsumed by a process of individualization 
in which life-styles rather than life-chances predo- 
minate. 
The superiority of science isnow being undermi- 
ned by the growth of what the German sociologist 
Ulrich Beck has called the “risk society”, in which 
risks, especially environmental threats, seem to be 
accumulating faster than the benefits produced by 
social improvements and technological advances. T he 
instrumental rationality on which Western notions of 
20 The Unesco Courier - September 1998 
modernization depend is being challenged by what 
Beck’s French colleague Alain Touraine has termed 
“new modernity” in which Reason and Subject are 
recombined in the form of new social movements. 
Higher education will have not only to continue to 
satisfy the predictable demands for democratic entit- 
lement and socio-economic utility with which it is 
familiar, but also to cope with the consequences of 
these new uncertainties. T hese may include: new cur- 
ricula that emphasize style and images at the expense 
of skills and information; recategorization of higher 
education as a playful,even selfish,activity; a tighter 
link between experience of higher education and social 
esteem; submergence of the universal, but also parti- 
cular, values characteristic of the traditional university 
by anomic globalization;threats to the scientific tra- 
dition and methods, from the “risk society”, from sub- 
jectivization and from demands that other knowledge 
traditions are accorded equal respect. 
The universities of the 21st century, therefore, 
may have to face two ways. They will have to conti- 
nue to pay attention to the democratization and the 
“knowledge society” agendas, which are likely both 
to be subsumed in a larger “lifelong learning” 
agenda. Their ability to sustain current levels of 
public funding and to satisfy their student-custo- 
mers will depend on their success in this respect.It 
will not be easy There is a danger that the essence 
of higher education will be lost if it succumbs to 
unconstrained populism. If this happens, the “qua- 
lity” of the university will disappear—and with it per- 
haps its distinctiveness and so its utility and mar- 
ketability. Similarly in the Knowledge Society of the 
future the university will face new rivals because all 
organizations will need to become “learning orga- 
nizations”. These rivals’ strength will be increased if 
the superiority of universal science is successfully 
challenged. 
But universities will also have to address the new 
agendas—of the “death” of work (and graduate 
careers?), of new social movements (and the erosion 
of individual enlightenment?) of globalization and 
virtualization (and the undermining of academic com- 
munity?); of “alternative”’knowledge traditions and,

### 113362: Four pillars of wisdom

Four pillars of wisdom 
by Guy Neave* 
  
Countries with a long university 
tradition,like the United 
Kingdom,have exported their 
model of higher education. 
  
* International Association of 
Universities 
Four countries have left their mark on the world’s 
higher education systems. What contributions have they 
made? 
 
or more than 900 years, the university has been 
remarkably active in “exporting itself”. T he 
great medieval universities of Paris, Oxford 
and Prague drew on the experience of Bologna, 
sometimes held to be the earliest university of them 
all. So it is hardly surprising if the inspiration of some 
forms the basis of others. But no higher education sys- 
tem is exactly the same as its neighbours. 
For all their variety, the way most systems of higher 
education have developed harks back to what may 
be seen as four referential and historical models of the 
university: the Napoleonic model (France), the Hum- 
boldtian (Germany), the “market-driven” model (the 
United States) and the model of higher education 
equated with the United Kingdom. Until recently, 
the so-called “Soviet model” and its derivatives from 
a command economy might well have figured 
amongst the ranks of these “system shaping” models. 
The Napoleonic model is one of the earliest 
examples of the state harnessing the university to the 
modernization of society. It did this by maintaining 
close control over financing, over academic appoint- 
ments and the use of legal instruments to ensure 
that national provision was similar across the natio- 
nal territory. In its classic form, the “Napoleonic” 
university is a powerful lever in asserting a singular 
national identity, based on the principles of formal 
equality and merit which are themselves both defi- 
ned and upheld by a powerful national administra- 
tion. In addition to France, this pattern ranged over 
such countries as Spain and Italy, and is also to be

seen in Argentina and many of the French-spea- 
king African nations. 
The Humboldtian model of university, so called 
after Wilhelm von Humboldt, a radical reformer of the 
Prussian higher education system in the early 19th 
century, is often seen as being at the origins of the 
present-day “research university” committed to 
“advancing the frontiers of knowledge” .Humboldt 
attached special importance to the freedom of senior 
members of the university to pursue enquiry without 
interference from government. And more to the point, 
government should, he argued, ensure the freedom of 
teaching and learning. Most important of all, the 
Humboldtian interpretation placed on the univer- 
sity the duty to conduct both teaching and research. 
The third model is that of the “market-driven” 
university, best represented by the various systems 
of higher education in the United States. Though 
deeply influenced by the Humboldtian ethic, the 
United States system contained three features which 
set it off from its European counterparts. The first 
was the emphasis upon “useful knowledge”; the 
second, its close ties with the local community;the 
third,and perhaps the source of its most powerful 
appeal today, its close ties with the economy. The 
United States was the first to develop a mass higher 
education system,more than half a century ago. 
T he fourth referential system is that of the Uni- 
ted Kingdom. It is often cited as an outstanding 
example of a university system enjoying immense ins- 
titutional autonomy. University independence was 
once ensured by a unique system of funding by 
which governments left the responsibility for dis- 
tributing public money to the universities them- 
selves. British universities were well known for their 
attention to student personal development in addi- 
tion to intellectual prowess. Important too was the 
idea of residentiality as the basis of an academic 
community. Students lived on campus. A system 
long devoted to an elite education, the United King- 
dom was relatively late in reaching massification, 
doing so only in the course of the 1980s. 
These models, in their different ways,have sha- 
ped the world’s universities, especially in the post- 
1950 period, when most of them were founded. But 
the “archetypes” themselves have also changed. Many 
of them look to developments in the world’s largest 
higher education system—the United States—as a 
source of inspiration. Whether this will alter as today’s 
version of globalization sets a premium on rapid 
change, and which will be the “referential” systems 
in two decades, time alone will tell. [|

What do students 
Germany: 
erman students took to the streets thirty 
years ago in a bid to overturn the “bour- 
geois” social order. Nowadays the mood 
could not be more different. Germany’s 1.8 mil- 
lion-plus students are learning to live in an era of high 
unemployment and dwindling subsidies. 
“Many students are under the illusion that if 
they work hard enough they’ll get a job,” says Carola 
Schmidt, a fourth year history student at Berlin’s 
Humboldt University. “But it’s not like that.Often

### 113364: What do students want? Indonesia: an uncertain future

Thirty years ago, from Dakar to Mexico 
City, from Paris to Berkeley, students 
took to the streets to announce the 
coming of a new world. Students have 
often been in the forefront of 
revolutions, and in several countries 
have brought down seemingly 
invincible regimes. But what do they 
want today? This is not an easy 
question to answer, if only because 
their status is by definition temporary, 
because the student population never 
forms a stable and homogeneous 
social group and student demands vary 
according to their context. The dreams 
of the students of 1968 in many 
countries have given way to a realism 
arising from the constraints of the late 
twentieth century. Today’s students 
want job opportunities more than 
anything else. But they have not all 
turned their back on the struggle for 
ideals. On this double page, we present 
reports on the student situation in 
Germany and Indonesia. 
22 The UNEesco Courier - September 1998 
there are just no jobs.” 
In the autumn of 1997,students staged a series 
of strikes and protests to try and focus national 
attention on their plight and the crisis overwhel- 
ming Germany's institutes of higher education. T hey 
called for more money to be spent on upgrading 
teaching and laboratory equipment,a comprehen- 
sive review of government support for students as 
well as reform of the country’s higher education 
system and moves to cut class sizes. Claudia Boege, 
a student representative at Frankfurt’s University 
of Applied Science, believes that public universities 
are facing the same difficulties as other parts of the 
country’s social system.The problem is, she says, 
“The politicians don’t have any new funding ideas.” 
Indonesia 
he future of a nation lies in the hands of the 
young. For Indonesia, that is no overstatement. 
In May 1998, it was the students who caught 
the world’s attention by spearheading the drive to 
unseat the nearly godlike figure of President Suharto 
from his more than thirty-two-year presidency. But 
after the jubilation, the students woke up to find the 
original problems still there, with the economy col- 
lapsing and politics getting murkier by the day. 
“What is the next move? Is this what you want?” 
a street vendor asks a student activist. Yet without a lar- 
ger-than-life common enemy like the Suharto regime, 
students have too many wants and too few resources 
to continue their movement, in the absence of either 
a nationwide organization or a shared agenda. 
For the more radical students from the Jakarta 
CityForum, a loose gathering of students from about 
100 Jakarta universities, a complete dismissal of the 
parliament and government is in order. They want a 
so-called Indonesian People’s Committee to replace 
the establishment and set up elections as soon as pos- 
sible. Why?“Because we don’t trust all of the old ins- 
titutions,” yells a student leader.

NEE EEE I a. 
The movement largely ran out of steam, leaving 
behind a trail of frustration and anxiety about the 
future. “The mood among students today is, ‘well we 
can’t change the process, so we had better make the 
most of it’,” says Herbert Dieter, a political scientist 
with the University of Duisenberg. 
Despite considerable media coverage of the 
strikes and widespread public sympathy towards 
the students’ cause, Dieter believes that the pro- 
blems of education in Germany remain. In parti- 
cular, he says that underfunded German universities 
are not offering their students much hope of fin- 
ding a place on an increasingly competitive job mar- 
ket. With classes so full that there is often just one 
professor for every 600 undergraduates, students 
say they have virtually no contact with their tea- 
chers. 
If finding a job after university is the key issue for 
German students today, supporting themselves 
during their years of study has also become a high 
priority for many of them.Higher education might 
be free in Germany, but students still have to make 
ends meet to pay for the rent and other expenses. 
Students have also been demanding increased 
government financial support. T he number receiving

to their causes, the more down-to-earth students are 
retreating from the political arena, to regroup and 
return to their classes. “My students are going back 
to campus to consolidate while keeping an eye on 
the new government’s moves,” says Sudarto, rector of 
Airlangga University in Surabaya. 
But this consolidation is far from areality. “Spon- 
taneous student unity is close to impossible when 
there isno political mainstream,” says Ismail, a now- 
apathetic former militant. And while the remaining 
activists argue over competing agendas, ordinary stu- 
dents have simpler desires. Marijono, a student from 
Jombang in East Java says:“We do not want to be 
fooled again, either by the government, by the Inter- 
national Monetary Fund or by self-acclaimed refor- 
mists.” 
He and others like him would prefer to see pro- 
gress in a field closer to daily life: education.“Edu- 
cational improvement should not be ignored. It is 
the way to enhance our quality of life,” says Dadang 
Budiana from the Indonesian Student Association 
for International Studies. 
Less than 10 per cent of the total national budget 
is allocated to education. Most state university stu- 
dents come from the middle class, which can afford 
income from the state has fallen in recent years and 
1s now down to about 17 per cent in the western 
part of the country, compared with 37 per cent 15 
years ago. A similar picture emerges in the east, 
where the number of students receiving govern- 
ment support has dropped over the last four years 
from 55 per cent to about 32 per cent. 
As a consequence, the number of students wor- 
king and studying at the same time hasrisen in recent 
years, while the percentage of undergraduates from 
lower income families has fallen from 23 per cent in 
1982 to 13 per cent last year. Working while studying 
also tends to exacerbate another problem facing Ger- 
man higher education, which is the number of years 
spent in the halls ofacademia.T his often means that 
many students do not take their first steps towards a 
full-time career until they are about thirty years old. 
Holding down a job while studying is also impor- 
tant because the lifestyle of today’s students is less 
frugal than that of their predecessors of three decades 
ago. According to a survey of German undergra- 
duates published in May 1998,six out of ten had a 
car and four out of ten had their own apartments. 
“T oday’s students,” says Schmidt, “like to have more 
fun and to live an easier life than those of 1968.” N 
the preparation courses for the rigorous national uni- 
versity entrance exam. Private universities are expen- 
sive.Lower-income youths are essentially left out in 
the cold, without access to higher education.“Poor 
students will always feel inferior,” says Budiana. “To 
get a scholarship, they must write a letter, approved 
by the local government,stating they are ‘financially 
incapable’.” 
Lower tuition fees are a key demand, according to 
Budiana. “The government should slash the military 
budget and reallocate funds from superfluous high-tech 
development for the sake of educating the people.” 
Zainal, a student from a poor village in East Java, 
couldn’t agree more. “Poor guys like me can’t afford 
to pay the tuition anymore.” But even the rich students 
now are feeling the crunch. The fall of the rupiah has 
tripled the prices of foreign textbooks. “I can’t buy 
books any longer. T hey are unbelievably expensive,” 
says Iwan, a student from privately-run Trisakti 
University. 
For Indonesia’s politically puzzled and scholasti- 
cally troubled students, helping overthrow the pre- 
vious government now seems a lot easier than for- 
ging their nation’s-and their own—future. N

e are living through a period of profound es Md 
historical change, marked by an on-going 
knowledge revolution. Society is chan- 
ging far more quickly than the structures it has crea- 
ted and the universities are lagging behind these 
changes.T hey, and the educational system in gene- 
ral, continue to teach the use of static processes, 
forecasting models based on historical experience 
and the memorizing of solutions to already solved 
problems. 
Higher education systems in both North and 
South are in crisis,both quantitatively and qualita- 
tively. Naturally the developing countries are the 
hardest hit, both in terms of available resources and 
levels of student enrolment (see box page 27). 
Is the crisis due to a shortage of funds alone? 
Does the fact that the countries of the North invest 
ten times more per student than those of the South 
mean that graduates from the former are ten times 
better trained ?C ommon sense says yes. But in most 
cases the answer is no. Generally speaking, univer- 
sity education has failings all over the world, in some 
cases because it is an offspring of a wasteful society, 
indifferent to the resources with which that society 
provides them. 
  
The missing link between 
education and the world of work 
In the United States, for example, many teachers 
and researchers come from developing societies 
which should theoretically have given them a less 
sound training than that provided by the 
immense academic and financial resources of the 
United States system. But this is not the case: 
they compete professionally and scientifically, 
with no major problems. In many areas the 
results of university training are comparable. 
Professionals move around because they need 
jobs and want to work in the best possible working 
conditions. There are,for example, almost 30,000 
African Ph.Ds working in Europe and North Ame- 
rica, and thousands of Latin American and Asian 
professionals working in the United States. By the 
beginning of the 1990s about a million professionals 
had emigrated to the developed countries over the 
previous three decades, and the figure hasincreased 
considerably in the last five years. While the number 
of opportunities and access to them are uneven, 
- v (} .

there is little difference between North and South as 
regards quality; nor is the availability of funding the 
only basis for improving the system. 
The problem is that post-secondary training 
today is diploma-driven. It is based on rigid 
study programmes and is changing at a rate 
which takes little or no account of the speed of 
knowledge accumulation. This is despite the fact 
that today’s graduate professional needs to have 
followed a flexible curriculum and must be a 
problem solver, extremely adaptable to new pro- 
cesses and technologies, generously endowed 
with creativity and firmly inclined towards life- 
long learning, as is clear from the studies on 
skilled labour done by industrialized countries 
and from numerous OECD studies. 
A recent study of the relationship between 
higher education and the labour market observes 
that there appears to be no connexion between 
the increase in professionals’ level of knowledge 
and changes on the labour market. Although the

continue to be high in both North and South. 
Graduate unemployment in Europe, for 
example, varies between 1.4 per cent and 16.6 
per cent depending on the country. What’s more, 
many graduates are working in jobs outside their 
field of training. T he increase in graduate unem- 
ployment in the developing countries is largely 
due to the drastic fall in demand from the major 
employer of graduates—the state—as a result of 
international competition and new political and 
economic approaches. T he private sector is in no 
position to absorb the supply of surplus gra- 
duates. World Bank studies carried out in Asia, 
the Middle East, North Africa and certain Latin 
American countries show that graduate unem- 
ployment is increasing: in Egypt it rose in barely 
five years from 9.6 per cent to 16 per cent; in 
Venezuela it went from 4 per cent to 10.3 per 
cent between 1981 and 1990. The picture is 
similar in many of the former countries of the 
communist bloc as a result of rapid privatization. 
All the same, higher education cannot be held

for the correlation that should exist between training, »

market undoubtedly demands basic skills and 
knowledge, it is attaching increasing importance 
to the emotional and psychological attitudes of 
future employees. In Belgium and Sweden, two 
of the countries with the lowest graduate unem- 
ployment levels (2.2 per cent and 2.1 per cent 
The North-South gap 
respectively), potential employers consider that 
although university graduates are very hardwor- 
king and possess an excellent knowledge of their 
specialization, they are ill prepared for conditions 
in the real world and show few signs of creativity, 
adaptability and flexibility. T his view has been 
expressed in other countries, including Germany, 
Japan, New Zealand, Norway and the United 
Kingdom. 
Although post-secondary education is clearly 
associated with higher personal incomes, lower 
unemployment and greater opportunities to 
climb the social ladder, unemployment rates for 
people with higher education qualifications   
n the last decade alone, the gap in 
higher education enrolment rates has 
widened by 6.7% in favour of the most 
developed countries. Africa, the region 
with the highest annual increase in uni- 
versity student numbers (7.5%), has a very 
low enrolment rate (2.5%), while North 
America, which has the lowest growth in 
student numbers (1.6%) has the highest 
enrolment rate (77.3%). 
Perhaps the most marked disparities are 
in student costs. A student in the North 
costs far less in relation to Gross Domestic 
Product (GDP) than a student in the South. 
In absolute terms, however, the latter costs 
only $651, as opposed to $6,520 for the 
former. 
On average, an investment by a poor 
country of $651 in higher education 
requires twice as big a sacrifice as an 
investment of $6,520 by a rich country. In 
other words, the poorer the country, the 
higher the relative cost per student and 
the greater the national budgetary effort.

Higher education cannot 
be held wholly responsible 
for graduate unemployment 
nor for the gap between 
training and market 
expectations 
study programmes and 
demand for labour. It is often 
said that higher education is 
failing to provide training in 
the activities required by the 
market, but the market is often 
incapable of adequately anti- 
cipating the type of professio- 
nals it is going to need. 
A survey conducted in 
 
‘I lam beginning to 
suspect all elaborate 
and special systems of 
education. They seem 
to me to be built upon 
the supposition that 
every child is a kind of 
idiot who must be 
taught to think. a. 
Anne Sullivan Macy, United 
States, 1866-1936  
26 The Unesco Courier - September 1998 
Florida (USA) among mul- 
tinationals in the high-tech 
and services sectors revealed companies that 
were unable to identify the professional qualities 
that would be required within ten years and, in 
many cases, within five years. T his is not surpri- 
sing, in view of the spectacular rise of the Inter- 
net between 1994 and 1998 which caught many 
hardware and software firms unawares. It is in 
information technology that redundancies and 
high unemployment levels are occurring, because 
systems are constantly changing and because of 
strategic mergers between the major companies. 
Another example of the difficulty of making 
reliable predictions concerns those made by the 
European Community and the US Government 
regarding the types of jobs that would be needed at 
the beginning of the new century. T hese predictions 
were inaccurate: what had been forecast to occur 
after 2001 actually came about in the late 1980s 
and early 1990s. 
It can be said, however, that professional training 
over the coming years will focus on areas such as 
high-tech electronics, information technology, aqua- 
culture,agro-energy, biotechnology and energy phy- 
sics. Jobs in information and communication systems 
will require new qualifications which will have to 
be continually updated. The service sector will expe- 
rience spectacular growth in the field of leisure and 
recreation because of the reduction in working hours. 
New professions in the human sciences such as 
“ludicadology”, incorporating psychology, peda- 
gogy, information science and the technology of 
education, play and creativity programmes, will 
replace the old single-discipline approach. 
In short, the great occupational change looming 
ahead will call for increased interdisciplinarity, revi- 
talization of the disciplines related to ethics and aes- 
thetics and sweeping changes in the attitudes of tea- 
chers and students: for the professional of the future, 
education will be a lifelong process,and education 
and work will go hand in hand. 
The great challenge will thus be to create a stable 
relationship between higher education and society 


### 113367: Vision and action for the next century

Vision and action 
for the next century 
Challenges await a World Conference on 
Higher Education in the 21st century, 
convened by UNESCO in Paris from 5 to 9 October 
s world mobilization in favour of higher edu- 
cation justified while millions of adults and 
children are illiterate and lack access to basic 
education? Is it reasonable to be concerned with 
the development of universities in regions where 
poverty, sickness and hunger are rife? These 
questions need to be asked since organizations 
such as the World Bank are urging developing 
countries to invest in primary and secondary 
education on the grounds that they offer a better 
return and contribute more to social equality 
than higher education. UNESCO believes, howe- 
ver, that neglect of higher education could 
deprive the countries of the South of an essential 
tool for their development and for strengthening 
their autonomy. 
UNESCO has therefore decided to convene a 
world conference on higher education. By doing so 
it is inviting countries to regard higher education 
not as a burden on state budgets, but asa long-term 
investment that is beneficial to economic competi- 
tiveness, cultural development and social cohesion, 
as well as playing a major role in training primary and 
secondary school teachers. 
The World Bank and other institutions cast 
doubt on the economic cost-effectiveness of uni- 
versities and their efficiency as vehicles of social 
change. This criticism is not totally unfounded. 
The goal of the world conference is to put for- 
ward substantial measures of university reform 
(redefinition of their mission, operations and 
funding) via action plans designed to enable 
higher education to play a central role in 
contemporary society. 
The conference is the result of a long process 
of international consultation and reflexion. Bet- 
ween November 1996 and April 1998, Havana, 
Dakar, Tokyo, Palermo and Beirut hosted regio-

through strategic alliances with the production sys- 
tem designed to promote participation by all sectors 
of the economy in the university’s basic and applied 
research programmes and by production-sector spe- 
cialists in university teaching. 
The problems of the university are also those 
of society, and so are the responsibilities. T his 
raises the question of the university’s specific cul- 
ture, especially the teacher-student relationship. 
Planning is currently based above all on the tea- 
ching staff, which is more corporatist than aca- 
demic. Physical spaces, salary scales, curricula, 
structures and timetables are more closely geared 
to the needs of the teacher than of teaching. This 
is the case all over the world. 
More serious still, this teacher-centred culture is 
giving way to one that is even more dangerous for the 
survival of university education: an administration- 
centred culture. This would mean an education sys- 
tem dominated by bureaucrats and the kind of mana- 
gement structures which would place an institution 
whose function is to produce and disseminate know- 
ledge on the same footing as a detergent factory or 
a multinational travel agency. 
But no strategy for change can work unless 
higher education adapts to the challenge of the 
knowledge explosion. It is vital that course 
 
nal conferences which examined trends in higher 
education worldwide and defined local needs. 
During the same period a wide range of nongo- 
vernmental organizations active in education 
took part in debates on specific themes. Their 
purpose was to gather the opinions of all concer- 
ned in order to prepare a declaration and a plan 
of action focusing on four key areas: relevance, 
quality, international co-operation, and manage- 
ment and funding. 
Accountable to society 
A framework for priority action proposes, 
through concrete means, a “new university com- 
pact” to redefine the relations between higher 
education and the state, civil society and the eco- 
nomy. It insists on the democratic nature of 
higher learning and its critical and future-orien- 
ted function, and the need for it to be accoun- 
table to society. It opens for discussion questions 
of funding and notes the importance of public 
support for higher education, as well as relations 
with the state including institutional autonomy 
and academic freedom. Such a pact should help 
transform the higher education institutions of the 
twenty-first century into centres of excellence 
and of the advance of knowledge which respond 
to growing student demand and the specific eco- 
nomic and cultural needs of each region. In short 
it sees higher education as playing a key role in 
measures designed to promote sustainable and 
equitable development. N 
Araceli Ortiz de Urbina 
content should be geared to what learners “must 
know” and not to what teachers “know” or 
“think they know”. This will force teachers into a 
permanent renewal of theories, techniques and 
processes, keeping up with knowledge produced 
both inside and outside the university. Higher 
education is evolving towards a model in which 
lecturers and students will be permanent lear- 
ners and where curricula will be drawn up on 
the basis of innovation, fresh knowledge and the 
latest teaching and learning technologies. Above 
all the university must teach people to think, to 
use common sense and to give free rein to the 
creative imagination. N

on the entrance exams, reputedly so 
tough that students often have to retake them 
two or three times before passing, or else give

The selection process up to now has been in 
two stages. In the first exam, with a more than 50 
per cent failure rate, candidates had to get 20 
points before they could go on to the second, 
which determined which university they went to.

cation system, draining candidates’ resources and 
swallowing up every year the equivalent of 40 per 
cent of the national higher education budget. 
The “survivors” of this rigorous selection 
process have no problem getting jobs afterwards, 
but the fact remains that of 100 children ente- 
ring primary school, only 11 reach university and 
only 17 per cent of them leave with a degree. 
This year, however, things will be much easier 
due to a switch from a two-stage exam to a single

of a 35 per cent enrolment rate in higher educa- 
tion. 
Yet Turkish higher education has come a long 
way since 1923, when the republic was proclai- 
med. Then the country had only 5,000 schools, 
with 360,000 pupils and 12,000 teachers. Wes- 
tern-style schools had begun to appear in the 
eighteenth century, but education had remained 
largely in the hands of clerical and Koranic ins- 
titutions which refused to train students to be 
open-minded and think for themselves. Indeed 
they were one of the reasons for the collapse of 
the Ottoman Empire. When the modern-minded 
Kemal Atatiirk came to power, the education sys- 
tem was drastically reformed. The country’s

oldest university, Istanbul D ariilfiinun, a bastion 
of conservatism which shied away from the 
sciences, was turned into a modern secular insti- 
tute of higher education in 1933 and renamed 
Istanbul University. 
It openly welcomed Jewish academics fleeing 
the Nazi extermination and completely transfor- 
med itself. Atatiirk’s passion for science encou- 
raged the founding of other universities along the 
same lines, notably the Istanbul Technical Uni- 
versity (ITU) in 1944 and the University of 
Ankara two years later. The second big educa- 
tional reform came in 1946, when universities 
won an independence which, despite poor wor- 
king conditions, made them the envy of many 
universities in the West. Two other major reforms 
followed, in 1961 and 1981. 
The number of universities had meanwhile 
grown to twenty-seven, each with its own sta- 
tutes and way of operating. This hasty and ill- 
thought-out expansion caused many problems, 
especially in harmonizing courses. The army 
cited the chaotic situation in education to justify 
its seizure of power in 1980 and 
cut back university autonomy, cau- 
a good reputation, help the government avoid the 
outflow of currency caused by a wholesale depar- 
ture of young people to study abroad. They are 
also a ray of light for hundreds of thousands of 
high-school graduates who cannot get into state- 
run universities. The snag is that tuition fees are 
very high, even though the government subsi- 
dizes up to 40 per cent of the cost for some stu- 
dents. 
As well as being privatized, higher education 
has also been regionalized. In Atatiirk’s day, the 
goal was to set up a secondary school in each 
province. The aim today is a university in each 
one. This has produced many institutions whose 
existence owes more to electoral politics than 
academic considerations, along with abnormali- 
ties like faculties with only one teacher. Gra- 
duates from these universities find jobs, but not 
the best ones. 
The labour market is increasingly deman- 
ding. Although education is divided up into four 
stages—undergraduate, graduate and masters 
(each requiring from two to four years of study), 
and then a doctorate—the only qua- 
lifications employers are really

sing many lecturers to flee abroad. 
The higher education law of 1981 
involved co-ordinating and stan- 
dardizing the structures, duties and 
responsibilities of all institutes of 
higher education and linking them 
to each other. All were to be atta- 
ched to universities and a new 
council for higher education

interested in are master’s degrees 
or doctorates. 
But the number of subjects on 
offer at each stage is growing all 
the time. More than a dozen new 
degree courses were offered in 
1997 alone and drew a large num- 
ber of students, though this gives 
no real indication of whether the 
(YOK) was put in charge of plan- 
ning and co-ordinating the reforms. The YOK 
was very controversial at the beginning, but it 
still exists today, though with different powers 
since the mid-1990s. 
Some schools, known as “other educational 
mstitutions”, do not come under YOK but 
various government ministries. For example, one 
which teaches “health sciences” is attached to 
the health ministry. Another teaches “internal 
security services” involving military colleges and 
the police academy. 
More and more higher education institutions 
are springing up, largely due to privatization.T he 
first private universities were founded in the 
1960s but closed a decade later because of 
poorly-constructed courses and degrees of little 
value. The 1981 reform law allowed only chari- 
table foundations to set up private universities. 
By 1988, 32 of the 33 existing universities were 
state-run. Today there are 72 universities, 18 of 
them privately-operated. In Istanbul, there are 
six state universities, but 12 private ones. 
The private institutions, which generally have 
courses teach skills which enable 
students to get jobs afterwards. They may be 
more of a fallback for students who failed to get 
into the university of their choice because they 
did not score well enough in the entry exam. 
University places are in demand, so exam results 
determine which students go where. 
Specialization and the proliferation of courses 
are the broad trends. This is particularly true of 
private courses at master’s level, where no fewer 
than 16 new subjects have been created in the 
past academic year, including women’s studies, 
robotics, aerospace studies, seismology, family 
medicine and gerontology. 
At this rate, Turkey will have plenty of experts 
at the start of the new millennium. But there are 
still big problems to sort out. More than two- 
thirds of the country’s 1,400,000 students are 
male, which is not surprising since a fifth of Tur- 
kish women are illiterate. Also, the average time 
a Turk spends in school is still only between 
three and six years. N

### 113369: Bulgaria's overdose of Russian profs

Bulgaria's overdose 
of Russian profs 
Since the Soviet collapse, the demand for 
Russian courses in Bulgarian schools has 
plummeted, leaving many teachers jobless 
n the early 1990s, after the fall of the Berlin wall 
and communist regimes, Bulgarians could hardly 
imagine what lay round the corner. Apart from 
the need for economic reform, they had to face swee- 
ping changes in ways of thinking and learning.“ We 
had to rewrite all our textbooks, from primary school 
to university level,” says a history teacher at the uni- 
versity of Sofia. The first thing to be done was to 
purge the national education system of the dead 
weight of ideology and of compulsory Russian classes. 
The history of Russian language teaching in Bul- 
garia goes back to 1878, when the Czar’s armies 
freed the country from the Ottoman yoke. As a token 
of gratitude to the “liberating brothers” from Russia, 
it was decided that Russian would be taught in secon- 
dary schools. Under the communist regime, Rus- 
sian became compulsory in primary schools, and 
was even taught in kindergartens. By the late 1980s, 
courses were being taught entirely in Russian in 
twenty secondary schools, and Bulgaria had 4,000 
Russian teachers. 
In 1992, the wind of democratic reform swept 
through the education system. Marxism and com- 
pulsory Russian disappeared from 
  
Sofia, a sound two-year cur- 
riculum has nevertheless 
helped many of them earn 
an English teaching degree. 
One expert says, “in the end 
EE i  ge) it was the right choice, 
because nowadays the Rus- 
sian-English combination 
is one of the most highly sought-after.” 
That was then. Four years ago the Bulgarian 
Socialist party was voted back into power and the 
retraining courses were abolished. The succeeding 
government, which has been in power for a year,is 
having a hard time managing a cumbersome legacy. 
Hostages to the education system reform, which 
itself has been buffeted by political squabbles and 
changing governments, many teachers have left tea- 
ching altogether for business careers. 
Svetla Djivreteva has started raising silkworms. 
“It wasn’t exactly my calling in life,” she says, “but I 
had to make a living somehow.” A graduate of the uni- 
versity of Veliko Tarnovo near her home village of 
Draganovo in Bulgaria’s heartland, she started out 
studying to be a Russian teacher. But 
curricula. But the decision was taken 
without much thought for the conse- 
quences, especially for teachers. 
School number 133 in Sofia, 
where 1,300 students start learning 
Russian in the first year of the pri- 
mary level, is the only holdover from 
the old system. It receives so many 
In 1992, the wind 
of democratic 
reform swept 
through the 
education system 
by the time she finished the reforms 
had been implemented. Svetla deci- 
ded to follow her husband to Ruse, a 
town near the northern border, but fai- 
led to find a job there. “I had to teach 
Bulgarian literature in a village twenty- 
five kilometres from home,” she says. “I 
got up at five-thirty in the morning to 
requests for admission that only one 
in four applicants can be enrolled. “We have sixteen 
Russian teachers, but many colleagues had to be 
retrained. I know of quite a few who went back to uni- 
versity to learn English or to become primary school 
teachers. Others left to sell books on the sidewalk,” 
explains the principal,Lyubov Micheva. 
Two thousand Russian teachers found them- 
selves without a job after the reform, says Letelina 
Krumova, a specialist on the issue at the ministry of 
education. In 1993 she started a programme to 
retrain “high-risk groups”, including jobless Rus- 
sian teachers. “But the amount of money required 
turned out to be exorbitant, so we soon gave up on 
the idea and asked the people concerned to manage 
on their own,” says Krumova. At the university of

catch the bus. In winter there wasn’t 
any wood to heat the school and the children tried to 
write with their gloves on.” 
After a year,Svetla was sacked and replaced by 
a friend of the principal. She moved back into her 
parents’ home near her alma mater, where she enrol- 
led on a primary school teacher training course. With 
her new diploma in her pocket, she is currently unem- 
ployed but has her eye on a job in the village school. 
In the meantime, Svetla survives by going each 
month to the nearby silk mill where she is given a large 
jar of silkkworms. This thankless job brings in 100,000 
leva (slightly over $50) a month. She wants to go 
back to teaching, but in the meantime all she can do 
1s wait and raise worms. [|

| usiness follows graduates. For the coun- 
\ Ntries that host them, today’s high-flying 
Ns oreign students hold the keys to tomor- 
row’s successful deals, because when they return 
home they will probably become influential deci- 
sion makers in politics and business. 
Meanwhile, they provide the countries where 
they study with hefty tuition and lodging fees. 
According to the non-governmental organization 
Education International (EI), each year foreign 
students bring in $7 billion to the US economy, 
between $1.7 and $2 billion to the United King- 
dom, $750 million to Australia and $730 million 
to Canada. “In Australia, the Royal Melbourne 
Institute of Technology and Monash University 
are considered among the top 500 service expor- 
ters.” 
1.5 million 
students abroad 
International student flows have increased at the 
same pace as worldwide demand for higher edu- 
cation in the past few years. In 1980, approxi- 
mately 900,000 young people left home to study 
abroad. Today the figure is 1.5 million, and, 
experts say, the upward trend is likely to conti- 
nue. Ninety-five per cent of students studying 
outside their home countries head for the indus- 
trially developed nations. T hree-quarters of them 
go to eight countries, and the trend is moving 
towards still greater concentration. By far the 
most popular destination is the United States, 
where the number of foreign students has increa- 
sed almost six-fold in thirty years, rising from 
82,000 in 1964-65 to 458,000 in 1996-97. “It’s 
never been so high,” although the number has 
flattened out in the past five years, says Todd M. 
Davis, director of research at the Institute of 
International Education (IIE) in New York.T he 
figures may be impressive, but foreign students 
account for only 3.2 per cent of the total in the 
United States—three times less than in Germany, 
France and the United Kingdom. 
  
  
    
A unive 
The second most frequented host country is 
France, with 140,000 foreign students in 1996. 
Although France has a strong, long-standing tradi- 
tion of welcoming foreigners, its market share is 
dropping, according to a 1996 study by SFERE, a 
French organization which monitors the export of 
educational resources. In Germany, Australia, Japan 
and the United Kingdom, on the other hand, foreign 
student enrolment has increased. 
Africa south of the Sahara and a number of Asian 
countries send the highest proportion of their stu- 
dent populations abroad: over 10 per cent. In terms 
of numbers,however, China is the biggest “expor- 
ter”, with 130,000 expatriate students, twice as 
many as Japan and the Republic of Korea, which 
come next. Young people from Asia account for 
nearly half of all students abroad. 
Why do more and more young people, usually 
acting on advice from their families, decide to study 
outside their home countries? First of all,because 
rightly (the usual case) or wrongly (sometimes for 
snobbish reasons), they believe that the quality of 
higher education is better abroad. Other, more spe- 
cific factors may also come into play. Flows bet- 
ween European countries account for a quarter of 
worldwide student flows. They are part of a gro- 
wing trend and a political movement towards regio- 
nal integration which are reflected in university stu- 
dent exchange programmes such as the European 
Union’s Erasmus scheme. In other parts of the 
world, restrictive measures encourage some com - 
munities to look elsewhere. For example, “the M alay-

nic Chinese allowed in its universities,” explains 
Robert Lawrence, director of LD & A, an Australian 
company which carried out a survey on Asian stu- 
dent movementsin 1997. In poor countries,candi- 
dates for emigration regard the university as an open 
door to an Eldorado in the West.Everywhere, the 
brightest hopefuls apply to elite institutions which 
have fiercely competitive selection procedures, such 
asYale,Harvard and Columbia on the east coast of 
the United States, Stanford and Berkeley in Cali- 
fornia, Oxford and Cambridge in England, the Ecole 
Polytechnique and the School of Advanced Com- 
mercial Studies (HEC) in France, and McGill Uni- 
versity in Canada. 
American universities are a powerful magnet 
for several reasons, including the use of English 
as a world language, the persistence of the Ame- 
rican dream and, above all, quality of education. 
“That’s where you find the most four-star pro- 
grammes,” says Denis Lévy, honorary president 
of the International Association of University 
Professors and Lecturers. “For example, Stan- 
ford is the best place to study European law. 
Schools like that have unlimited material 
resources. They subscribe to everything, use the 
latest information technology to the full and offer 
outstanding working conditions.” Universities in 
the developing countries cannot measure up. 
 
Asians in demand 
ost expatriate students are from 
  
Asian countries. In spite of the crisis, 
they are also the most sought-after. 
Europe and North America are vying to 
attract them but Canada and, especially, 
the United States win the competition 
hands down. A 1997 study by Australia’s 
LD & A company shows that 88% of Asian 
students believe the US offers the best 
educational services, followed by the UK. 
In non-English-speaking Europe, they 
regard the quality of the German system 
as higher than that of the French. Accor- 
ding to the Institute of International Edu- 
cation (USA), Asia provides 57% of all 
foreign students in the US, ahead of 
Europe (15%) and Latin America (11%). 
Most are from Japan (45,531), followed by 
China (42,503), the Republic of Korea 
(37,130), India (30,641) and Taiwan 
(30,487). Business is the Asians’ favourite 
major, followed by engineering and the 
sciences. [|

Often ill-equipped or transformed into battle- 
grounds during political conflicts, they are deser- 
ted by the best teachers. 
Young people believe that studying abroad is 
almost always a passport to employment.“T hat’s 
especially true when the recruiter has also stu- 
died outside his or her country. When he or she 
perceives the international student as equal to 
the domestic one, the overseas degree still makes 
the applicant stand out,” says Lawrence. Fami- 
lies, which usually foot the bill for their children’s 
education, do not hesitate to make the invest- 
ment. In the English-speaking world, tuition fees 
can run as high as $27,000 in the United States 
and $15,000 in the United Kingdom. Unlike the 
situation in European countries such as France, 
where access to most institutions of higher lear- 
ning is inexpensive, the poorest applicants are 
automatically screened out on financial grounds. 
They have access only if they are outstanding, in 
which case they obtain grants and scholarships 
from their governments, from international orga- 
nizations and private foundations. 
A valuable export 
The outflow of students is a serious loss for the 
“exporting” countries. According to UNESCO, 
30,000 African graduates, as well as many Asian 
and Latin American ones, may have settled outside 
their home continents. Among the reasons which 
make them hesitate to return home are their fears of 
saying goodbye to a high standard of living in the host 
country (including access to health care, quality 
education for their children and high salaries) and 
of running into a professional dead-end at home. 
“The conditions of scientific work are difficult in 
developing countries,” say Jacques and Anne-Marie 
Gaillard of France’s ORST OM research centre. 
“The research is not original, bureaucratic controls 
put a brake on initiative, equipment is hard to acquire 
and maintain,access to information is limited. ...” 
There may also be political obstacles. In the late 
1980s, China began to realize that expatriate stu- 
dents were not returning. D espite measures to lure 
young graduates back home,such as the allocation 
ofhousing and research budgets and the freedom to 
travel, between 1978 and 1994 only 70,000 out of

230,000 students who had left China to study abroad 
returned,according to official figures. 
The example of the Republic of Korea shows 
that an authoritarian regime is no obstacle if the 
economy is thriving. In the early 1960s, many 
Koreans remained abroad after graduation,80 per 
cent of them in the United States. But in the 1980s, 
two-thirds of those who had earned doctorates from 
American universities went back home within three 
years of receiving their degrees. Generally speaking, 
the “little dragons” of southeast Asia boast the 
highest percentages of returning students—at least 
until the recent economic crisis blew up. 
Whether they return home or not,foreign stu - 
dents are a profitable investment for the host coun- 
try. When they become decision makers in their 
home countries,they control access to markets. If 
they settle down where they studied, they often pro- 
vide energy and fresh ideas. 
That lesson has not been lost on the United 
States,where the Immigration and Nationality Act 
Amendment, which entered into force in 1968, faci- 
litates the immigration of qualified personnel and 
where several foundations offer grants to the most 
promising students. Today, private companies even 
pay some foreign students’tuition fees to make up 
for the shortage of skilled personnel, especially in the 
field of information technology. Most of the scien- 
tists living in the United States were born abroad and 
over one-third of Silicon Valley’s engineers and 
researchers are immigrants from Taiwan, say Jacques 
and Anne-Marie Gaillard.

sive policy for attracting foreign students, espe-

some forty countries and makes it easy for 
foreign students to obtain a visa. According to 
EI, Canada and the United Kingdom have done 
the same. Japan’s ministry of education has deci- 
ded to accept 100,000 foreign students by 2000, 
but in 1996 such students only numbered 
52,000 and numbers may fall, according to Akira 
Ninomiya, a professor at the university of Hiro- 
shima. Reasons include the high cost of living in 
Japan, the language barrier, the rigorous admis- 
sions process and the near-impossibility for forei- 
gners of finding work on the local market.

France has a very ambiguous policy. According to a 
recent study, “the current paradox consists of a drop 
in the percentage of foreign students and growing dif- 
ficulties in hosting them and, at the same time, a 
desire to be more present on the international edu- 
cation market.” The French are uneasy about the 
structure of the foreign student population,which 
reflects their country’s history. Over half come from 
former colonies in Africa, countries with “limited 
economic potential,” according to SFERE. But the 
French are also aware that they cannot afford to 
give up too much ground on the international stu- 
dent market, especially in a world where, according 
to EI, “employers seek qualified employees who 
thrive in foreign environments and understand mul- 
ticultural contexts.” N

best way of getting to know an individual’s abili- 
ties. If trainees’ profiles match the firm’s requi- 
rements, they are hired more or less on the spot. 
This explains why big firms are tending to 
make exchange agreements with universities and 
other higher education institutions. Philips, a 
Dutch multinational with 250,000 staff spread 
out over five continents, takes on 20,000 new 
employees every year. Of these, 20 per cent are 
young graduates who will work mainly in 
research, technical development, information 
technology or electronics and product marketing 
and sales. “Many of our staff come from the trai- 
ning forums and programmes we organize with 
leading universities in all world regions where we 
do business, for example IMD University in 
Switzerland, the London Business School in Bri- 
tain, Supelec in France and the Rotterdam 
School of Advanced Studies in the Netherlands,” 
explains Yan Lavenan, Philips’ General Manager 
for Human Resources. 
But diplomas aren’t everything. Charles- 
Henri Dumond, president of Michel Page, a lea- 
ding European employment agency, which 
recruits 2,000 employees every year, is convinced 
that initial experience is extremely important in 
recruiting a young person. “Academic knowledge 
1s very important,” he says, “but so is general

prestigious schools have their place but we also

For other companies, nationality or experience 
make little difference. Guido Tommei is respon- 
sible for staff recruitment for Africa at Schlum-

services and knowhow to major oil companies. 
“We primarily recruit recent young graduates,” 
he says, “regardless of nationality and or expe- 
rience, who are prepared to work in tough condi- 
tions and adapt to different situations.” 
Pascal Devoulon of Alexandre Tic, a French 
employment agency which forms part of an 
international network, sets a high priority on per- 
sonal initiative. “Unsolicited job applications 
receive more attention than many people think,” 
he says. “In our company we place such applica- 
tions on file and summon candidates when we 
receive a request that matches their qualifica-

Many of them are students wishing to go to their 
dreamland for higher studies, if possible for a 
bright future too. While some of them manage 
to get visas, others fail to convince the consulate 
officials. 
Three decades ago it was regarded as an 
exceptional achievement for an Indian to study 
abroad. Today, the phenomenon is much more 
widespread and hundreds of students leave India 
looking for higher qualifications and greener pas- 
tures in North America and in Europe. “Every 
year the US consulates in India give visas to 
nearly 1,500 students to pursue higher studies 
in American universities,” says an official at the 
United States Embassy in New Delhi. 
Though India has more than 260 universi- 
ties, comprising nearly 8,200 colleges, it has 
often been claimed that the standard of higher 
education has not kept pace with change. “There 
is no point in doing research in India. The lack of 
up-to-date facilities and funding forces students 
to come to the United States,” says Virul Acha- 
rya, a researcher at New York University. Acade- 
mics point out that the educational system in 
India was set up during the British era and only 
minor changes have been made to it since then. 
Moreover, in the post-independence period, 
emphasis was laid on the humanities at the 
expense of other disciplines. Educational institu-

according to Acharya there has been complete 
stagnation in higher research since the 1970s. 
“Most Indian colleges do not even have the 
Internet,” he says. 
Helped by their predecessors, Indian students 
carefully select which institution to apply to, for a 
place in a reputed college or university assures 
them of a lucrative job after their course. Many of 
them are recruited at campus interviews conduc- 
ted by multinational companies. For those who 
decide to return home, a well-paid job could be 
hard to find, as few companies in India offer high 
salaries. “I came here to do my studies in com- 
puters and I got a job the day after the course 
was over,” says Raj Lokaiyan, a computer-profes- 
sional turned businessman living in New York.“I 
am sure in India I would have had to wait for 
months, maybe years, to find a suitable job.” 
A golden highway 
to Silicon Valley 
Whereas in the early 1970s large numbers of 
Indian students went to the United States to 
study medicine, the most popular subject today 
1s information technology, followed by business 
administration. According to India Abroad, an 
ethnic Indian weekly published in the United 
States, there are nearly 35,000 Indian computer 
professionals in California’s Silicon Valley alone. 
“Some of them have started their own companies 
and are doing very well,” says Niraj Trivedi, a 
journalist working with the magazine. 
Indian students who go to the US and 
Europe are not necessarily rich. Most hail from 
middle-class families, which seek higher social 
status by sending their children abroad. It is 
impossible for a middle-income group family 
with a yearly income of $3,600 to send their chil- 
dren abroad for studies which cost at least 
$5,000 a year. Here, the low-interest educational 
loans (up to $15,000) offered by Indian banks 
come in handy. Studies in India cost very little, 
since most of the institutions are government- 
funded, causing some to denounce the brain 
drain caused when students use the nation’s 
resources for their initial studies and then 
migrate to other countries later. 
In the past, British universities attracted 
many Indian students because of historical links 
between the two countries. American universi- 
ties took over in the early 1970s following a dras-

tic cut in the number of scholarships in Britain. 
They were the obvious alternative because of the 
language and the higher level of education. All 
the same, a 1997 UNESCO study noted that 
India only ranked seventh among the countries 
sending students abroad, well behind such smal- 
ler countries as the Republic of Korea and 
Malaysia. 
Indian students wishing to study abroad face 
many hurdles since visa restrictions have been 
tightened by the US and Europe since the early 
1990s. Some of them opt for less expensive uni- 
versities in Australia or Russia. “The number of 
students coming to the US has dropped in the 
last few years,” says Virul Acharya. “However, if 
they want higher qualifications they have to come 
to the US or Europe as Indian universities lag 
far behind.” X

t the end of the academic year in June 1998, 
some 4,000 people with postgraduate

of Morocco set up a National Council of Youth and 
the Future (CNJA), on which all the country’s eco- 
nomic players are represented, and asked the new 
body to find solutions to the thorny problem. In 
1993 the council’s diagnosis of the situation led to 
the passage of a law that exempts companies from 
paying employers’ social security contributions if 
they hire graduates as trainees at a modest salary 
ranging from 1,600 to 2,600 dirhams ($166 to 
$270). In 1994, a job promotion fund was set up 
to help young graduates start their own companies 
and obtain loans. 
These measures were unsuccessful, so a 
“youth training and employment” programme 
was set up in October 1997. The goal is to place 
20,000 recent university graduates in private 
companies every year. The firms that hire them 
are entitled to all the advantages granted by the 
laws of 1993 and 1994, and in addition, half the 
salaries paid to the new recruits are reimbursed. 
The programme has a 1,710-million-dirham 
($176-million) budget spread out over four years. 
Furthermore, ten “job information and orienta- 
tion centres” have opened where employers and 
prospective employers can meet, and soon there 
will be twice as many. But in 1997 they helped 
only a thousand or so graduates find work. 
None of these measures has solved the problem.

D Is there really a crisis in higher education? 
I dislike the word “crisis”. Although the pro- 
blems differ from country to country, higher 
education all over the world is going through a 
period characterized by the growth of the stu- 
dent population, an increase in unit costs, and 
the difficulty of gearing courses to the graduates’ 
need to find jobs that match their training. The 
entire world is facing a hard choice between pure 
market logic, where universities would compete 
with each other like businesses, and the current 
system dominated by the public university 
bureaucracy. Lastly, the planetary development 
of the university system has not reduced inequa- 
lities as it was supposed to do, but has actually 
helped to exacerbate them. 
D Inwhat way? 
There are two mechanisms at work that attract the 
best students,regardless of their nationality, to the 
best universities,primarily American ones. Not only 
will the elites of the South continue streaming to 
the countries of the North, especially English-spea- 
king ones, but universites are going to create “nomad 
campuses” in the client countries. Like companies, 
brands such as Harvard and Stanford will be expor- 
ted with their standards of quality to Singapore and 
New Delhi. Because of this privatization, we will 
no longer be able to speak of the North as such, but 
of autonomous university systems. Harvard and 
Oxford will lend their labels to the universities of 
the South. The major universities will function like 
vacuum pumps,sucking up the best students. 
D Isthis trend unavoidable? 
It must be resisted by creating transnational ins- 
titutions capable of combating the introduction 
of market logic into higher education. The price 
to pay for that is the setting up of mechanisms to 
monitor the quality of public service. Public uni- 
versities must agree to submit to assessments 
made by outside bodies. Europe should set up 
an assessment agency that would make universi- 
ties permanently open to scrutiny and have them 
sanctioned if they do not comply with the stan- 
dards set for them. 
D What criteria would those assessments be 
based on? Should the aim of higher education 
be to train producers or citizens? 
It has to do both, of course. The ties between uni- 
versities and business must be strengthened so that 
companies more readily agree to accept training 
programmes that lead to diplomas. At the same 
time, every university graduate should have lear- 
ned at least four things there: how to be a good citi- 
zen,how to communicate, create and criticize.In a 
country like France, there is still room for impro- 
vement in that regard. Education does not stress 
the importance of those four concepts enough. Com- 
municating means knowing how to use a computer, 
but it also means knowing how to speak at least two 
foreign languages, which is rare. T he skills needed for 
critical discussion are also far from widespread. 
DP What does it mean to be a citizen? 
First of all, it means knowing the law, one’s 
duties and one’s rights. But it also means lear- 
ning how to live in society, to make decisions, to 
participate. Student life itself should be a first- 
hand experience in learning about democracy. 
D Your comments suggest that democracy is 
having rather a rough time worldwide, with 
inequalities increasing. But is higher education 
becoming more democratic in the wealthy 
countries? 
It is becoming a mass phenomenon without 
becoming more democratic. In the rich countries 
there is what might be called “cultural insider 
dealing”. This means that children whose parents 
are university graduates not only possess what 
the French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu calls “cul- 
tural capital”, but have another essential advan- 
tage as well: access to networks enabling them 
to find out how to acquire the best education. 
This phenomenon is worsening in societies that 
are increasingly fragmented into communities 
living side by side but cut off from each other. 
Today only a small number of people have access 
to genuine higher education. In many parts of 
the world we are witnessing a lengthening of the 
primary education period and the virtual disap- 
pearance of secondary education; primary and 
higher education meet up with each other. And 
higher education is splitting in two: “lower 
higher” education, available to everyone, goes 
more or less from the last years of high school to 
the master’s degree. Access to true higher edu- 
cation—postgraduate studies-requires member- 
ship of certain social and cultural circles. That is 
how inequalities persist behind a semblance of 
democracy. N

Will censorship on the Internet forbid the unacceptable or just silence 
troublesome voices? What grip can be held on a communications tool 
designed to be free from control? 
skull rotates on the black screen. 
The picture of a baby flanked by 
Hitler’s moustache or a photo- 
montage of Arnold Schwarzenegger wiel- 
ding a sword with Ingrid Bergman at his 
feet, both of them naked, file past. This 
sort of thing may amuse some people, 
but it is no laughing matter when sites 
on bomb-making, child prostitution and 
the superiority of the white race appear. 
T he Internet, the outcome of a successful 
marriage between telecommunications 
and information technology, is posing 
unprecedented information control pro- 
blems which governments, service provi- 
ders, educators and families are finding 
hard to solve. 
Messages travel without 
leaving a trace 
A newspaper has an editorial team and a 
printing plant, a television network has 
newscasters, studios and transmitters. In 
other words, traditional media are identi- 
fiable and have a physical or material 
component that the authorities can call 
to account when they consider that the 
law has been broken. They can prosecute 
a journalist, shut down a newspaper or 
confiscate a transmitter. The media are 
also attached to a territory. Their mes- 
sages may cross borders, but their activi- 
ties come under the jurisdiction of at 
least one country. 
The Internet is another matter alto- 
gether. First of all, there are countless 
transmitters of information. A hundred 
million people have access to the Inter- 
net, and any one of them can not only 
send electronic mail and take part in chat 
forums but, with a little electronic tinke- 
ring, turn their personal computer into a 
service provider that others can tap into. 
In a way, that person then becomes “vir- 
tual”. His or her message can travel along 
so many routes that when it reaches its 
destination, the original source can no 
longer be traced. 
Legitimate or not, the monitoring of 
contents must take this new situation into

account.T hat would require a universal 
agreement based on a common set of ethics, 
or at least a lowest common denominator. 
But that is far from the case. The Nether- 
lands, China, Zambia, the United States, 
Cuba and France, to name just afew coun- 
tries,have radically different and even irre- 
concilable views on what is and what is not 
permissible on the Internet. 
Internet service providers and some 
organizations campaigning to “clean up 
the Web” point to an assault on morality. 
The fierce competition among service 
providers has led many of them to culti- 
vate a wholesome image on issues such 
as paedophilia, which strikes a chord in 
public opinion, out of fear of being consi- 
dered purveyors of “smut”. 
InThe Netherlands, the authorities have 
no intention of passing repressive laws. Ins- 
tead they are encouraging service providers 
to clean up their act by eliminating paedo- 
phile and racist sites from their servers. In 
January 1996 Dutch Internet service pro- 
viders created a foundation in charge of 
tracking down undesirable sites. Law enfor- 
cement officials step in only when the author 
of the incriminating pages refuses to com- 
ply. But Renee Zwart, a member of the foun- 
dation who believes censorship is a “medie- 
val instrument”, says her organization does 
not attack freedom of expression. 
Many companies supply their clients 
with tools to screen out pornographic 
and racist sites. Several such programs 
are on the market, including Cyber

Patrol, CYBERsitter, NetNanny and 
Surfwatch. They offer a list of websites 
or forums with a reputation for contai- 
ning material considered offensive and a 
list of key words that are judged obscene. 
The connexion is interrupted whenever 
a user tries to log on to one of these sites 
or as soon as a forbidden word appears 
on screen. The Electronic Frontier Foun- 
dation, an American organization dedi- 
cated to a radical defence of freedom of 
speech on the Internet, is totally in line 
with its country’s laws and tradition. The 
foundation argues that although these 
programs screen out indecent content, 
they also block access to many political 
and social sites, including pages devoted 
to fighting Aids and promoting women’s

rights. The experiment is “inconclusive”. 
Moreover, “it is relatively easy to outs- 
mart these programs, even for a begin- 
ner,” says Jean-Paul Cloutier, an inde- 
pendent World Wide Web pioneer in 
Quebec and editor of Chroniques de Cybé- 
rie, an on-line information and commen- 
tary magazine about the information 
highways. 
Government restrictions can be enforced 
in the name of morality, but above all they 
are used to prevent the use of the Internet for 
“subversive” ends. In China, for example, 
Internet users must register with the police 
and agree not to use the medium for “anti- 
government activities”. What’s more, the 
government, which has every modem-owner 
on file, has monitored all traffic since 1996. 
“For example,it is now against the law for 
a businessman to use the Internet to obtain 
stock market information considered stra- 
tegic,” says Christophe Tronche, a member 
of the French section of Citadel, an organi- 
zation that campaigns for the upholding of 
individual freedom on the Internet. In Cuba, 
the regulation commis- 
some of the publication’s articles on line. 
Today, opponents of monolithic regimes 
can use the Internet to set up areas of 
freedom that are forbidden in their own 
countries and can reach an international 
audience that would be difficult to obtain 
otherwise. Censors around the world are 
coming up against this phenomenon 
because “right now the Internet is the 
only area of freedom outside all political 
control,” says Lyonnel Thouvenot of 
Reporters without Frontiers. 
In liberal democracies, where most 
efforts to ban material on the Internet 
are focused on sites with paedophile and 
racist content, the first attempt to control 
the Web dates back to 1995. That is when 
the US Congress passed the Communi- 
cation Decency Act, which aimed to 
severely punish the transmission of 
“shocking” and “indecent” material 
through computer networks in the name 
of the protection of children. Under the 
terms of the law, violators could face 
fines of up to $250,000 and two-year pri- 
son sentences. A year 
sion, which approves 
requests for Internet 
access, is entirely made 
up of representatives of 
the justice, interior and 
armed forces ministries. 
In countries like 
Chinaand Cuba, moni- 
toring cyberspace is 
easier because “the tele- 
Government 
restrictions are 
used above all 
to prevent the use 
of the Internet for 
“subversive” ends 
later the act was ruled 
unconstitutional and 
struck down by the 
Supreme Court. In the 
name of freedom of 
expression, neo-nazi 
sites have also been 
allowed to continue in 
the United States and 
to flourish in Den- 
communications opera- 
tors belong to the state,” Cloutier explains. 
But monitoring is less straightforward when 
the site is offered by a server located out- 
side the country. That is the case, for 
example, in Algeria, where Internet users 
have access to a site created by “dissident 
officers” in the armed forces. “The Alge- 
rian government doesn’t like our site’s 
content. ...We use the Web as an opportu- 
nity,” says the site’s anonymous webmas- 
ter. 
The Internet can be used as an alter- 
native to censored traditional media, 
especially the printed word. In Novem- 
ber 1997 the French organization Repor- 
ters without Frontiers, which defends 
freedom of the press, tried using the 
Internet to give a new lease of life to the 
Mauritanian newspaper Mauritanie N ou- 
velle, whose publication had been sus- 
pended for seven months, by putting 
mark. 
In Germany last M ay, a Munich court 
convicted Felix Somm, the former local 
manager of the service provider Compu- 
Serve, of spreading pornographic material 
over the Internet through newsgroups, 
handing down a suspended two-year pri- 
son sentence and fining him 100,000 
marks. T he conviction has been appealed. 
The judicial authorities in Germany are 
also uncompromising when it comes to 
neo-nazi propaganda or far-left on-line 
magazines such as Radikal, which is accu- 
sed of being an apologist for violence. A 
Dutch server offers the periodical, which 
is also banned from newsstands. However, 
Cloutier says, “few states have laws speci- 
fically pertaining to the Internet....Every- 
thing depends on how existing laws on 
freedom of expression are applied, on the 
margin of manoeuvre one has to criticize

Putting 
a price 
on life 
he current spate of lawsuits brought by 
cancer-stricken smokers or their rela- 
tives in the United States has taken the 
debate on smoking onto new ethical 
grounds. As lawyers for incriminated 
tobacco companies point out, the decision 
to smoke is an individual choice. It 
becomes a matter of public interest, say 
their opponents, when governments have 
to foot the medical bills for treating 
tobacco evils. 
In the US legal system, it is not enough 
to prove a wrong. You have to “quantify” 
the damages. This is where the law gets 
tricky, according to Tom Pursell, senior 
counsel for the Attorney General of Minne- 
sota, which on 8 May 1998 settled one of 
the biggest tobacco lawsuits, involving 11 
American and British companies. 
“With epidemiologists testifying as to 
which diseases and conditions are caused 
by smoking,” says Pursell. “we went 
through Medicaid [public medical system 
for the poor] payment files from 1976 to 
1996 to calculate what we consider a 
conservative figure-$1.3 billion.” 
“Junk science! Bad data!” roared the 
defence lawyers, quick to find holes in the 
accounting. For example, what about the 
money the state had raised in excise taxes 
on cigarette packs? More importantly, the 
industry was prepared to argue that it had, 
in fact, saved the medical system $2 billion 
in nursing home costs, as smokers die pre- 
maturely and need less long-term care. 
The court found it “abhorrent and hor- 
rendously contrary to public policy that a 
party should, in whatever guise, claim that 
the killing of individuals should be used as 
a defence or a factor in mitigating 
damages,” and rejected the so-called 
“death benefit” defence on 24 January 
1998. “The judge was hopelessly biased,” 
says Michael York, who represented 
tobacco giant Philip Morris, “and made it a 
point to disregard the facts” All the same, 
the defence agreed to settle out of court 
for more than $6 billion. [|

fears that these massive, repeated, cross- 
border electronic exchanges, which escape 
all control, will limit their powers and pri- 
vileges in the age of globalization.Some of 
these powers are legitimate if they help com- 
bat money-laundering or the spread of pae- 
dophilia.Others are obsolete. T he growth of 
electronic trade requires total protection of 
payment methods, which themselves depend 
on secure encryption. But most experts 
agree that the Internet must move out ofits 
present primitive stage, in which scholars 
and “plugged-in” individuals exchange 
information, and become an instrument of 
mass commercial communication,whether 
it is used by companies between them selves, 
by producers,or by consumers. 
Organizations that defend freedom of 
expression on the Internet, such as the Ame- 
rican Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and 
the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), 
are fighting for the total availability of encryp- 
tion technology, especially Pretty Good Pri- 
vacy (PGP). This software may be available 
to all Internet users in the United States, 
but only in a version that is also in the pos- 
session of law enforce-

main way in which the 
flow of information on

to make encryption

A FAR . Pd id ALE AE 
  
  
The Guggenheim Museum has become Bilbao’s leading tourist attraction. 
Life looked grim as the industrial heart of this 
Basque city ground to a halt. But an ambitious 
new cultural policy may be just what the 
doctor ordered 
ilbao’s Guggenheim Museum 
celebrates its first anniversary in 
October. In the year since the 
doors first opened, the gigantic glass and 
titanium building designed by Califor- 
nian architect Frank O. Gehry has attrac- 
ted more visitors than the population of 
the city which it has helped to place 
firmly on the world cultural map. 
In the early 1990s, following the decline 
of its heavy industry and the shut-down of 
steelworks and shipyards, Bilbao might have 
become a backward-looking city immersed 
in nostalgia.Instead, at a time when Seville 
was inaugurating Spain’s first high-speed 
train and smartening itself up to celebrate its 
Universal Exposition, Barcelona was sta- 
ging its Olympic Games and Madrid was 
chosen as the Council of Europe’s “Cultu- 
ral Capital of Europe”, this port on the 
Atlantic coast of northern Spain decided to 
look to the future and discard its traditional 
  
image as a grey city with nothing to offer 
but its financial status as the headquarters 
of Spain’s leading banks and the country’s 
second biggest stock market in terms of tur- 
nover. In short, it embarked on a revolution 
which is still only in its early stages. 
With support from the European 
Union, the Spanish and Basque govern- 
ments, the regional council and private 
enterprise, a wide range of initiatives 
were launched to transform industrial 
Bilbao into a city of culture and services 
with the aid of noted architects from all 
over the world. Facades were cleaned, 
port facilities were renovated, the airport 
was modernized, an eighteen-year motor- 
way construction plan got under way and 
drainage schemes were drawn up to 
enable the river Nervion to be used for »

The tomb 
that lost Its 
head 
n 27 November 1996, thieves behea- 
ded a stone statue from a tomb of the 
Song Dynasty (960-1279) in Gongyi, a city 
in China's central Henan Province. Sold by a 
peddler to a Hong Kong businessman for 
6,500 yuan ($812), the head changed 
hands three more times before fetching 
25,000 yuan in Hong Kong. 
It looked like just another case of cultural 
trafficking, a plague for developing coun- 
tries rich in antiquities but lacking the 
means to protect them. In China, tomb-rai- 
ding is on the rise, with gangs smuggling 
relics from the mainland to Hong Kong, 
where middlemen spirit them off mostly to 
the US and UK. While the trade’s extent 
remains a mystery, Chinese police and cus- 
toms officers uncovered more than 14,000 
smuggled relics in 1997. 
The story of the Gongyi head took an 
unexpected turn. The Hong Kong police 
were on the track of the object, when it 
suddenly disappeared— leading the Chi- 
nese to turn to Interpol for the first time. 
“This is one more aspect of China's 
openness to the international community,” 
says Lyndel Prott of UNESCO's Cultural 
Heritage Division, “and it couldn’t have 
ended better” 
While only about 12% of stolen relics 
reported to Interpol are recovered, the Gon- 
gyi piece was found in July 1997. It was 
about to come under the hammer of a San 
Francisco auction house for $600,000. 
But before a stolen relic can be recove- 
red, the international conventions require 
the claimants to prove that it has actually 
been stolen. This is not always easy. In this 
case, the Chinese proved their point with 
photographs of the intact statue originally 
taken to classify the tomb as a monument. 
Today, the relic is safe in Chinese hands, on 
its way back to the shoulders of the now 
famous Song statue. |

recreational sailing. T he whole operation 
will cost around $1,500 million. 
One major project was to provide Bil- 
bao with a metro. This idea, in abeyance 
since the 1970s, was executed by the Bri- 
tish architect Norman Foster, whose 
futuristic semi-circular fan-shaped 
entrances to the first line were immedia- 
tely dubbed “fosteritos”— “little Fos- 
ters”’—by the Bilbainos. The metro has 
helped soak up the traffic snarls that pla- 
gued this city of 370,000 inhabitants—a 
million counting the suburbs. 
The Guggenheim Museum is the keys- 
tone of this vast programme. It was given 
the go-ahead after a marathon series of mee- 
tings at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foun- 
dation in New York with the Basque autho- 
rities, represented at the highest level by the 
head of the autonomous government. The 
foundation’s administrators, who wanted 
to create a new European museum, in addi- 
tion to those in Berlin and Venice,to show 
their celebrated collection of modern and 
contemporary art, chose Bilbao after Seville, 
Madrid, Vienna and Salzburg turned the 
opportunity down. T he project has been 
totally funded by the Basques. The city 
authorities provided the land—a disused 
industrial site in the port district,the auto- 
nomous government and the provincial 
authorities coughed up 
$154 million, and eighty 
visitors said they wanted to come again. 
The Guggenheim effect was born. 
The last great museum built in the twen- 
tieth century stands in what was once a 
waterfront area littered with empty contai- 
ners. It is currently hosting (until 22 Octo- 
ber) an exhibition of 5,000 years of Chi- 
nese art, from neolithic times to the modern 
era. Bilbao is the only European city to hold 
the show. On its 10,000 square metres of 
exhibition space-nineteen galleries on three 
floors—sculptures and serigraphs by the 
Basque artist Cristina Iglesias are also on 
view (until January 1999). One of the rooms, 
130 metres long and 30 metres wide, is easily 
spacious enough to accommodate a foot- 
ball match. The museum also comprises an 
auditorium, a library, a restaurant serving 
regional specialities and a bookshop contai- 
ning the latest books on contemporary pain- 
ting. 
But the Bilbao Guggenheim is some- 
thing more than an art museum. Its cha- 
racteristic silhouette has been a backdrop for 
TV commercials and pop groups—Smashing 
Pumpkins launched their latest disc there, 
and Simple Minds used the gallery as a set- 
ting for their videoclip Glitterball. Coutu- 
riers Carolina Herrera and Paco Rabanne 
have transformed the central atrium into a 
catwalk to present their collections. For the 
first time in years,damp,

kidnapping.

nos, whose city once 
only received a brief 
write-up in the tourist 
guides, reacting to this 
newly acquired reputa- 
Bilbao Guggenheim has 
also assembled its own 
collection of works, largely by contempo- 
rary artists. Paintings by Willem De Koo- 
ning, Andy Warhol and Robert Rauschen- 
berg can be seen alongside works by 
important Basque artists such as T xomin 
Badiola, Eduardo Chillida and Prudencio 
Irazabal. 
The museum was inaugurated on 18 
October 1997 in the presence of King 
Juan Carlos and a 10,000-strong crowd. 
In the first month, it attracted 100,000 
visitors, becoming Spain’s third most 
popular museum, after the Prado and the 
Reina Sofia in Madrid. After eight 
months, 700,000 entries had been regis- 
tered (the most optimistic forecasts had 
predicted 400,000 visitors in the first 
twelve months), a quarter of whom were 
visitors to Spain. According to data col- 
lected by the museum, 86 per cent of the 
tion? At first they were 
sceptical about the 
whole thing, remembers journalist Felix 
Linares. Then they gradually realized that 
it was serious and today they are deligh- 
ted. “A familiar sight elsewhere, such as a 
Japanese tourist taking photos, was some- 
thing quite new here!” says Linares, who 
notes that it’s still virtually impossible to 
find a restaurant open on a Sunday eve- 
ning. 
Angel Gago, Secretary-General of the 
Biscay Hotels Association, thinks that 
there has definitely been a boost to tou- 
rism. “Until not so long ago the province 
mainly attracted business people,” he 
says. “They came during the week for 
trade exhibitions. From Monday to Fri- 
day there was a decent rate of room 
occupation, but on Saturday and Sunday 
the place was deserted” —especially since 
many locals leave the city during wee-

kends for nearby beaches. Today the 
annual rate of hotel-room occupation is 
around 42 per cent. “We are worried by 
talk of building four or five new hotels 
which could not be absorbed in the 
immediate future, and increased capacity 
would force us to lower prices,something 
we want to avoid,” says Gago. The tou- 
rists who visit Bilbao today are relatively 
well off, and Gago points out that “the 
hotels and restaurants which have bene- 
fited most are the fifteen or twenty featu- 
red in the tourist guides, whereas all told 
the city has 8,000 catering establish- 
ments.” 
Gago believes that anyone who drops in 
on Bilbao today is a candidate for a return 
visit.“Don’t forget,” he 
says. “We have the Gehry

it’s a very peaceful place. Bilbao was a 
grey city like . . . well . . . Manchester 
perhaps. Now it’s white, luminous.” What 
surprises her most is that “people have 
adopted the Guggenheim Museum, they 
don’t see it as the property of gentlemen 
in New York but as something of their 
own. The most encouraging thing is that 
young people are the chief admirers.” 
And she adds: “When you’re inside the 
building, the light, and the spirals of the 
architecture almost make you forget its 
contents. You would almost be willing to 
visit it if it was empty. The Guggenheim 
has made Bilbao a much more attractive 
city. You can see it from many parts of 
town. You walk along a street and sud- 
denly there is this great

Meanwhile other 
projects are fuelling the 
on-going Bilbao revolu- 
tion. “In the next three 
living in New York, in 
other words works by five 
or six world-famous architects within a few 
kilometres of each other.” 
In her book Txoriburu (“Linnet 
Head”) the Bilbao writer and illustrator 
Asun Balzola describes her city as it was 
in the 1940s. “These were years of iron 
and we lived at Bilbao, also a city of iron, 
always wet, gleaming and black because 
it was always raining. . . . The green sha- 
dows of umbrellas stained the streets and 
houses blackened by smoke from the fac- 
tories. . . . Bilbao was a replica of Coke- 
town, the imaginary industrial town des- 
cribed by Dickens in Hard Times.” Today 
Balzola smiles as she describes her city’s 
new image. “The district where I spent 
my childhood has changed beyond belief. 
Then it was a noisy industrial area, today 
or four years the city will 
totally change,” says 
Guillermo Fernandez, a Bilbao city official. 
In a few months’ time the Euskalduna Palace 
of Congresses and Music will be inaugura- 
ted. Likened by its architects, Federico 
Soriano and Maria Dolores Palacios, to a 
ship under construction;its role will be to 
put Bilbao on the international opera, 
concert and congress circuits. 
Meanwhile the Gehry Museum, the 
younger brother of Frank Lloyd Wright's 
building on New York’s Fifth Avenue, has 
already taken its place in the annals of 
twentieth-century architecture. Outside 
the building, beside the lines of visitors, 
the people of Bilbao look on with a mix- 
ture of astonishment and incredulity. HM

is the home of the collection of 
Peggy Guggenheim, Solomon’s 
niece, who by the time of her death 
in 1979 had assembled an outstan- 
ding collection of abstract and sur- 
realist art. 
The Guggenheim collection has 
regularly been enriched by fresh 
acquisitions and donations. With 
some 10,000 works, it is the worl-

art, comprising expressionist,

### 113377: Cybersnoopers on the prowl

Cybersnoopers 
on the prowl 
In the digital age, how can privacy be protected without infringing people’s 
freedom to trade via Internet? 
o one shall be subjected to arbitr 
interference with his privacy, family, 
home or correspondence... . Eve- 
ryone has the right to the protection of the 
law against such interference or attacks.” 
This may not be the best-known article of 
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
but the growing invasion of privacy by digi- 
tal technology and the Internet is bringing 
it to the fore. 
A number of opinion polls among 
Internet users show that protection of 
data about their personal lives has 
become a major concern. The inventor of 
the World Wide Web himself, Tim Ber- 
ners-Lee, said recently he was worried 
about the consequences for private life of 
use of the Internet. Cyberspace experts, 
consumer advocates and human rights 
defenders all warn that the “big-brothe- 
rization” of society is steadily advancing. 
And the political police are no longer the 
only ones involved, nor even the main 
perpetrators of it, at least in the Western 
democracies. 
These days,the most skilful manipula- 
tors of new information and communica- 
tions technology to build up files on indivi- 
duals are private companies collecting per- 
sonal data on tens of millions of people. 
Simon Davies, the British head of Privacy 
International, a human rights watchdog 
group, says every citizen of an industrialized 
country appears today in about 200 different 
data bases. Such mines of information are 
centralized, sifted through and correlated 
to produce very detailed profiles of consu- 
Protection of personal 
data has become a 
major concern among 
Internet users 
 
mers. The files are then resold to all kinds of 
firms, which use them to sharpen their mar- 
keting strategies, assess the economic relia- 
bility of customers and adjust to specific 
commercial demands. 
The Internet is an ideal tool for this 
meticulous task of categorizing the popu- 
lation. It is an extraordinary source of 
data as well as a practical way to handle 
such information and circulate it. Cana- 
da’s commissioner for the Protection of 
Private Life, Bruce Phillips, noted in 
1996 that surfing the Web was a bit like 
playing strip-poker: you start by taking 
off your tie and before you know where 
you are, your trousers have disappeared. 
In other words, “anonymity is not the 
rule on the Internet, still less is the idea 
that you don’t leave any traces behind 
you.” This warning by France’s Commis- 
sion on Data Processing and Freedoms 
(CNIL) applies to a broad range of prac- 
tices designed to tap into the secrets of 
Internet users. Most websites include 
some kind of questionnaire to fill in. The 
US Federal Trade Commission says 85 
per cent of 1,400 commercial sites it loo- 
ked at in March 1998 gathered personal 
information in this way. A medical clinic, 
for example, invited consumers to sub- 
mit their name, postal and e-mail 
addresses and insurance company and to 
make comments about their health pro- 
blems. Some on-line services require 
such details before they will give access 
to their site. 
Internet users can lie to get past these

urgency of political regulation and 
an ethical vision of the “ global infor- 
mation society.” With this in mind, 
UNEsco is organizing the second Info- 
Ethics congress, bringing together 
several hundred people, including 
some 30 leading international 
experts, in Monte Carlo from October 
1-3. 
“Cybersociety” has made the 
world a single country of which we 
are all destined to be citizens, as 
long as we have effective access to 
information. As economic, financial 
and technological globalization 
proceeds, we need to develop 
world citizenship and governance 
which guarantee access to quality 
public information and call for new 
tools of government. Factors in a 
fairer and more democratic infor- 
mation society include free access 
to public and government informa- 
tion, serious study of how privacy 
can be protected in the face of new 
ways of using personal data, 
encouragement of “free” software 
and open (“ non-proprietary” ) stan- 
dards to foster intellectual innova- 
tion and cooperation, and develop- 
ment of the World Wide Web’s 
cultural and linguistic diversity. 
These topics will be the focus of 
discussions in Monte Carlo. |

questions. A study by the University of Geor- 
gia, in the United States, showed that 40 
per cent did so when the questions got too 
detailed.But “most people are very naive,” 
says Alain Weber, an Internet expert with 
the French League for Human Rights. 
“They wouldn’t be so free with the infor- 
mation if they knew how it could be used.” 
A US banker in Maryland, for example, 
recently obtained a list of cancer patients, 
matched them with his customers and then 
automatically rejected loan applications 
from those who were ill. 
Data seekers on the Internet stop at 
nothing. The US Federal Trade Commis- 
sion is concerned about the “troubling” 
practices of commercial websites aimed at 
children: nine out of 10 of them extract 
information from these young people and 
fewer than a quarter suggest asking 
permission from their parents before 
providing it. 
Meanwhile, cybersleuths use many tools 
and monitoring programmes to record peo- 
ple’s movements around cyberspace.Data 
banks like DejaNews index all messages in 
on-line discussion groups. Anyone can type 
in the name of a person,click on “profile” 
and get their e-mail address and all the mes- 
sages they have sent to the group, which will 
provide information about their tastes, about 
how they spend their leisure time and what 
their opinions are. The CNIL also notes 
that the gathering and use of e-mail for com- 
mercial ends is a basic problem. 
To make matters worse,the Internet is 
a world of invisible tracks. You get the 
impression when you surf the web that you 
leave no traces behind you. The truth is 
rather different. Some sites place spying

how long. If you visit a site devoted to sado- 
masochism, for example, you reveal aspects 
of your character you would not admit to 
your closest friend. A survey last year by an 
American NGO, the Electronic Privacy 
Information Centre (EPIC), showed that a 
quarter of the 100 most popular sites on 
the Web use cookies to obtain profiles of 
their users. When you next visit them,they 
can present you with advertising tailored to 
your interests, or even send you without 
your knowledge programmes like Java 
Applets, which can reconfigure a site accor- 
ding to each visitor’s tastes. 
The range and power of new technolo- 
gies are creating a formidable “surveillance 
economy,” says Davies. So strengthening 
protection of the right to privacy is an urgent 
matter. The European Union directive on 
“the protection of individuals with regard to 
the processing of personal data and on the 
free movement of such data” is a step in this 
direction. 
Under the directive, which comes into 
effect on 25 October 1998, the processing of 
data about ethnic origins, political opinions, 
religious and philosophical beliefs, trade 
union membership, health and sex life, is 
prohibited except where

logy adviser Ira Magaziner has even threa- 
tened to go to the World Trade Organiza- 
tion (WTO) about it. At the same time, he 
insists that the US is just as concerned to 
protect the privacy of its citizens as European 
governments are. And all studies show that 
Internet commerce cannot succeed unless 
consumers can count on information about 
themselves being kept confidential. 
Behind such skirmishing lies the familiar 
difference of approach between the US and 
Europe. The former trusts the market to 
solve the trickiest problems, while the latter 
prefers to set up public-sector bodies to do 
so. Though the American authorities are 
well aware of the need to reassure Internet 
users, they are also sympathetic to the argu- 
ments of direct marketing and financial lob- 
byists, who think the solution lies less in 
imposed regulation than professional self- 
regulation through codes of conduct and 
the development of encryption technology

The battle 
of 
the bug 
A the third millennium draws near, the 
entire world is threatened by the mil- 
lennium bug, an unprecedented computer 
phenomenon that could have effects as 
wide-ranging as erasing maps to minefields 
and a recession more severe than the one 
caused by the 1973 oil price hike. 
Computers were programmed to indicate 
dates with just two characters-98 for 
1998-to save memory. At zero hour on 1 
January 2000 their clocks could turn back a 
century to the year 1900. The consequences 
could be unfortunate—an elevator could 
abruptly come to a halt between floors—or 
disastrous-the computers that help operate 
a nuclear power plant’s cooling system or 
manage air traffic could stop running. 
To avoid such scenarios, programs must 
be modified, tested and harmonized. Those 
operations are technically simple, but they 
require an exhaustive review of hundreds 
of millions of applications in every area 
from banking to manufacturing and health- 
care. 
This painstaking task requires implemen- 
ting major projects, hiring highly skilled 
workers and purchasing new hardware, lea- 
ding the world’s largest companies to make 
substantial investments. But for many busi- 
nesses, especially small- and medium-sized 
firms, it is apparently already too late to 
tackle the problem. 
According to upper-end estimates, on a 
planetary scale the operation will cost one 
trillion dollars, but the tab could soar even 
higher as the deadline nears and unexpec- 
ted snags crop up, especially since the cor- 
rections made to programs themselves 
cause new problems. 
The millennium bug has mobilized armies 
of computer programmers in the United 
States, Canada and the United Kingdom, 
but the problem has drawn scant attention 
in other industrialized countries, such as 
France. Meanwhile, Asia is crippled by its 
banking crisis and the developing countries 
are too poor to afford to modify their com- 
puter systems. |

TALKING TO... 


### 113378: Interview with Jeremy Rifkin: fears of a brave new world

Jeremy Rifkin: fears of 
a brave new world 
Will wars be fought for the control of genes in the 
21st century? Jeremy Rifkin fears the worst and 
explains why 
HB What isthe Biotech Century? 
Our futurists have too narrowly defined the 
twenty-first century as the information age. 
In fact, a far more profound shift is taking 
place in the global economy. Computers 
and genes are beginning to fuse into a single 
powerful technological and economic force 
that is laying the foundation for the biotech 
century. Computers are increasingly being 
used to decipher,manage and organize the 
vast genetic information that is the raw 
resource of the new global economy. Already 
multinational corporations are creating giant 
life-science complexes from which to fashion 
a bio-industrial world. 
T here are tremendous short-term bene- 
fits-new plants and animals,new pharma- 
ceuticals and energy sources. But it is naive 
to believe that these benefits come with no 
costs. The environmental, social and ethical 
implications of this science are chilling. Will 
the creation of cloned,chimeric and trans- 
genic species mean the end of nature? Will 
the mass release of genetically engineered 
organisms into our biosphere mean genetic 
pollution and irreversible damage to the 
biosphere in the twenty-first century?What 
are the risks of making a “perfect”baby? 
BM But how does this differ from our long- 
standing struggle to redesign nature? 
It is true that we have been engineering 
nature since the dawn of the Neolithic revo- 
lution in agriculture, but the new gene-spli- 
cing technologies are qualitatively different. 
In classical breeding, it is only possible to 
cross close relatives in the biological king- 
dom. Today, however, we are no longer 
constrained by these biological boundaries. 
For example, scientists have taken the gene 
that emits light in a firefly and injected it 
into the genetic code of a tobacco plant, 
which when fully grown,glows twenty-four 
hours a day. We have not seen that in evolu- 
tion. Genetically engineered plants, micro- 
organisms and animals bring greater risks. 
HB In discussions surrounding the use of 
gene therapy to cure or prevent human 
disease, you raise the question asto who 
should decide what isa “good” or “bad” 
gene. Are we heading into a new age of 
eugenics? 
Yes, but it doesn’t bear any resemblance to 
what we saw in Nazi Germany. The new 
eugenics is not social eugenics. It is banal 
and friendly. It is commercial and market- 
driven. Soon, prospective parents will be 
able to programme the biological future of 
their unborn children. T hey will feel pressure 
to rid their children of “undesirable traits”. 
If you knew you were going to pass on a 
gene for leukemia, wouldn't you like to eli- 
minate that from the sperm or the egg? And 
what about obesity or near-sightedness? 
Once we begin this journey, there is really no 
place to stop. Chilling eugenics issues will 
arise as we begin to see our children as the 
ultimate shopping experience. 
We already see this happening. In the 
1980s, the Genetech and Eli Lilly compa- 
nies were awarded patents to market a 
new genetically engineered growth hor- 
mone to the few thousand children suffe- 
ring from dwarfism in the United States. 
By 1991, the hormone had become one 
of the best selling pharmaceutical drugs 
in the country. Clearly, doctors were pres- 
cribing the drug to children who were just 
shorter than their peers. The companies 
are now pushing doctors to redefine nor- 
mal shortness as an “illness”. 
BM Some critics have branded you asan 
alarmist-they consider your views to be 
anti-science. These critics go too far, but 
at some level,do you feel that we should 
restrain this new genetic science? 
I believe that genetic science is invaluable; 
the question is not the science but the tech- 
nological application of that science. We 
must choose between a hard path and a soft 
path to the twenty-first century. In the case 
of agriculture, for example, the hard path 
would lead to genetically engineered plants, 
environmental risks and health problems. 
  
  
 
Jeremy Rifkin,economist and activist. 
In contrast, the soft path would mean 
using the same genetic sciences to create a 
sophisticated and sustainable organic agri- 
culture. The rule of thumb we ought to apply 
is clear: do no harm. Secondly, always 
choose the path that is least likely to foreclose 
opportunities for those not yet here and the 
one that is most able to sustain relationships 
instead of draining them. 
Bl Who is behind this new age of genetic 
commerce? 
Giant life-science companies are manceu - 
vering to control genetic commerce in the 
twenty-first century. The mergers and acqui- 
sitions going on in the life science industry 
rival those in the telecommunications,com- 
puter and entertainment sectors. T he giant 
chemical companies are beginning to sell 
off their chemical divisions to concentrate 
solely on the life sciences. They are making 
the shift from the petrochemical age to the 
age of geneticcommerce. Genes will be the 
primary raw material of the coming cen- 
tury just as oil, metals and minerals were in 
the colonial and industrial era. 
The name of the game is patents. In the 
next ten years, we will have isolated virtually 
all 60,000 genes that make up the blueprint 
for the human race. Virtually every one of

those genes will be the intellectual property 
of these life science companies for at least 
twenty years. 
The whole idea of patenting genes is a 
scam. Under US and European statutes, 
you have to prove that you have invented 
something that is novel, non-obvious and 
useful. So consider the example of a che- 
mist in the nineteenth century isolating 
helium which is not obvious and certainly 
useful. Now that chemist can patent the 
technique used to isolate helium but not 
the element. That’s because helium is not an 
invention but rather a discovery of nature. 
But in 1987, the US Patent Office issued 
a simple paragraph saying that it was possible 
to patent any genetically modified life form 
except a human being after birth. The only 
reason for excluding patents on humans is 
that the US Constitution forbids slavery. 
HB But aren’t you oversimplifying the issue. 
The patents don’t really cover the genes. 
They are awarded to companies and 
researchers to legally protect the 
methods invented to isolate or use them. 
They are actually patenting the genes. There 
are patents on thousands of human and ani- 
mal genes. For example,Myriad Genetics 
has isolated a gene that causes breast cancer, 
especially in Ashkenazi women (of Eastern 
European Jewish origin). The company has 
a patent on that gene—it is their invention.If 
any woman in the world goes for a scree- 
ning for that breast cancer gene, part of the 
fee that she pays isin the form of a royalty to 
TALKING TO... 
the company. 
Imagine the case of a chimpanzee with 
one human gene in its genetic code. The 
patent office would now consider that entire 
chimpanzee to be an invention. This is a 
gross violation of the mandate of the US 
Patent Office and its statutes. We are now 
challenging this in the US patent system. 
Bl How can you effectively try to counter 
thistrend given the tremendous finan- 
cial stakesinvolved? 
I have joined with the distinguished cell bio- 
logist Dr. Stuart Newman of New York 
Medical College. We have submitted a patent 
to the US Patent Office containing thirty 
claims covering all the human-animal chi- 
meras (human-chimpanzee chimeras, 
human-pig and other combinations) for 
medical purposes. As of now, there are no 
existing patents on this kind of chimera. 
If we are granted this patent, we will 
claim a “genetic conservancy” to forbid any 
researcher from crossing human-animal 
boundaries with embryonic cells for twenty 
years so that countries can have the time to 
debate this issue and hopefully pass the 
appropriate legislation to outlaw all trans- 
genic organisms. We are also seriously consi- 
dering whether to test the patent statutes 
in the European Union. 
BM The USand the World Trade Organization 
in particular have been pressuring deve- 
loping countries like India into adopting 
the US model of patent laws to protect 
Alarmist or seer? 
 
  
ctivism has been a way of 
life for Jeremy Rifkin, born 
in the US state of Colorado in 
1943. The founder and president 
of the Foundation on Economic 
Trends in Washington, D.C., he 
has testified before numerous 
congressional committees on 
subjects ranging from germ 
warfare threats to the labeling 
of genetically engineered foods. 
He has also been a consultant 
to numerous heads of state and 
officials, and has lectured at 
more than 300 universities in a 
dozen countries. Rifkin is per- 
haps best known for writing 14 
books examining the impact of 
scientific and technological 
changes on the economy, the 
workforce, society and the envi- 
ronment. One of his internatio- 
nal bestsellers The End of Work 
(Putnam,1995), is widely credi- 
ted for shaping today’s debate 
on corporate downsizing and 
technology’s role in displacing 
the workforce. 
In his latest book, The Biotech 
Century: Harnessing the Gene and 
Remaking the World (Tarcher/Put- 
nam,1998), Rifkin focuseson the 
negative implications of new 
genetic technologies which he 
feelshave been largely ignored in 
public debates The result isa frigh- 
tening view of a “ bio-industrial 
world” and an explanation of 
genetic commerce which hasbeen 
criticized as an unfounded back- 
lash against science

Jew,” Rifkin says.“ I culturally iden- 
tify with that but | am not reli- 
gious. For me, visiting the Nazi 
concentration camp at Dachau as 
a young man proved to be a defi- 
ning experience. ... We all want 
to make sure that such things 
never happen again.But we also 
have to understand that they can 
and do happen in ways we don’t 
suspect. That is why | have spent 
so much time focusing on how

mercial and market-driven. If there

their natural resources from exploitation. 
How would you advise them? 
Two positions are being championed. I think 
both are inappropriate. One position is that 
of the life-science companies. The other is 
that of many of the developing countries who 
are saying, “Look, these are our resources, 
just as oil is in the Middle East. We should be 
compensated.Otherwise, it is biopiracy.” 
But how do you ever compensate for the 
blueprints of life? Secondly, who do you com- 
pensate? Indigenous knowledge and 
resources cross all tribal and national boun- 
daries. For example Merck and Company 
have an absurd relationship with Costa Rica. 
They give a local non-profit institute a million 
dollars for access to all the country’s rich 
genetic diversity. Who does this institute 
represent? 
The gene pool should not be reduced 
to commercial exploitation by either govern- 
ments or companies. am hoping that gene- 
tically-rich countries like India will take the 
lead in developing a third way in which we 
keep the gene pool open—as we did with 
Antarctica-by covenant and treaty. If this 
doesn’t happen, we are going to have gene 
wars in the twenty-first century as we had 
wars over oil, metals and minerals in the 
industrial era. T his commercial competi- 
tion and conflict over ownership and control 
ofthe gene pool will further divide the haves 
and the have-nots.

journalists have treated the issue anecdo- 
tally, reporting on a new food crop here or 
a medical breakthrough there.Some of the 
science writers have a cozy relationship with 
the molecular biologists and the biotech 
companies which they don’t want to jeo- 
pardize. They also don’t feel confident in 
challenging the scientists. But more impor- 
tantly, the media have not yet understood the 
larger context because they have focused so 
closely on the information revolution.But 
once the context shifts to the broader eco- 
nomic arena of genetic commerce, all of the 
issues we have discussed will be on the public 
agenda. 
BW Isthe industry trying to hinder this 
debate? 
There is no conspiracy. Its just that the com- 
mercial floodgates are opening very quickly 
and the biotech business leaders are just 
trying to make as much money as they can 
and advance their portfolios as fast as pos- 
sible. They don’t even see the broader 
context. The last thing they want is to be 
slowed down by debate. 
They want to believe there 
TALKING TO... 
tists do not really believe in the demo- 
cratic process. We saw the same thing 
with petrochemical pollution and nuclear 
energy. 
BM Isthere a link between thisarrogance 
and the growing disregard for the idea 
that a species has an essential nature or 
an intrinsic value? 
Yes, this is critical. Living beings are no lon- 
ger perceived as birds and bees but as 
bundles of genetic information. All living 
beings are drained of their substance and 
life becomes a code to be deciphered. T here 
is no longer any question of sacredness or 
specialness. How could there be when there 
are no longer any recognizable biological 
boundaries to respect? In this new way of 
thinking about evolution,structure is aban- 
doned. Everything is pure process. So you 
can mix and match, and cross anything you 
want in the biological kingdom. 
The laws of nature are being rewritten to 
conform with our latest manipulation of the 
natural world. The old Darwinian notion of 
the “survival of the fittest” 
is being replaced by the “sur-  
will be no problems. 
At a deeper level, there 
is a new libertarian streak 
which insists that the mar- 
ket should be the final arbi- 
trator. This way you can 
avoid a debate and just 
The most chilling 
prospect of all is

will decide as to what kind of the future This new cosmology 
technology should be used offers the ultimate justifi- 
and how. To me, the most 
chilling prospect of all is letting the mar- 
ketplace and consumers decide the future 
evolution of our species and other creatures. 
BM But how do you explain the vehemence 
with which scientists respond to anyone 
questioning their work? 
There is a certain arrogance in science, espe- 
cially when a particular science is coming of 
age. We saw this with the chemists and phy- 
sicists and now we see it with the biologists. 
This arrogance is rooted in the old Baco- 
nian science which is based on power. Bacon 
called nature a “common little harlot. She is 
wild. We must tame, squeeze, mould and 
shape her,” he said.“Knowledge is po wer. 
We can be the masters of our destiny.” 
Many microbiologists—but not all of 
them—find it exciting to be able to control 
destiny, to be able to be God. They are 
the only ones who can not only decipher 
the code of life, but administer it. They 
believe that if we were capable of unders- 
tanding their work, we would be in 
favour of it. But for them being informed 
means knowing it as they do and accep- 
ting their moral view of it. T hese scien- 
cation for a hard-path 
science. It assures us that we are following 
the natural order of things and simply 
moving in the same direction as nature 
has already set out for us. In the next step 
on this path, molecular biologists won’t 
speak of genetic engineering, which is too 
cold. Instead they will consider humans 
and other creatures as unfinished works 
of art. Biotechnology will be seen as 
powerful “artistic tools” allowing us to 
finish the canvas. 
HB After a frightening outlook for the next 
century, your book ends with “the rest is 
up to us”.This is frustrating What can 
we do? 
It would be absurd to lay out blueprints 
as to what should be done. Instead, I 
have made a diagnosis of two different 
paths for the next century. It is up to the 
public and the next generation in parti- 
cular to politicize and argue, challenge 
and express their views in the streets, in 
the courts, the media, and so on. 
When great technological and com- 
mercial revolutions sweep over civiliza-

tunity to deal with the changing power 
relationships and ask what we want. 
We have to see past the myths that 
science is value-free and technology is 
neutral. If you start with the idea that the 
life science corporate agenda is simply 
the next stage in evolution-that just 
because we can do something means that 
we should or will do it-then there is no 
point in having a debate. 
By recognizing the power of the new 
technologies, we should ask: is that appli- 
cation an appropriate use of power? Is 
that power manageable or uncontrol- 
lable? Is that power going to potentially 
foreclose our options or the options of 
those not yet born? 
Hl Aren’t you being rather optimistic? Don’t 
you think that the lack of debate reflects 
a serious flaw in society’sinstitutions? 
I am neither an optimist nor a pessimist. 
I don’t know if this generation will do the 
right thing. But I am hopeful that it will. 
It can create different avenues for change 
instead of relying on the institutions of 
society which maintain and represent the 
status quo. 
However, activism is not just about 
shouting from the rooftops. Our passion 
and intuition have to be built into an 
intellectual framework. We must not only 
have a basis for discussion but an alter- 
native vision. 
HM Do you believe that public opinion will 
TALKING TO... 
have the sway needed for a soft path to 
the biotech century? 
I am saying that there is no public opinion 
yet. Once the focus shifts to genetic com- 
merce, debate will escalate exponen- 
tially-not just on the part of activists but 
also within industry. This is not just big cor- 
porations against the citizens—there will be 
a push and pull in the marketplace. 
In agriculture, for example, there will 
be a major battle between organic pro- 
ducers and distributors and the biotech 
companies for consumers. The same will 
be seen with medicine and health. The 
pharmaceutical companies are going to 
push hard path drugs (which I don’t 
necessarily oppose) and further down the 
line somatic and germ-line therapy. On 
the other side, the insurance companies 
will push to use the same science to pro- 
duce sophisticated preventive health care 
rather than paying for expensive drugs 
and therapies to heal the sick. 
Bl Does UNESCO have a role to play in the 
debate? 
It would be interesting if UNESCO could 
provide a galvanizing place so that the non- 
governmental organizations could have 
more sway. UNESCO doesn’t necessarily 
have to take a position but through the Inter- 
national Bioethics Committee it could offer 
a forum to debate the complexities of these 
issues. [|
