From Franco's regime in Spain to 
Hindutva historical revisionism in 
India by way of South American 
dictatorships, the dismal memory of 
the past can contribute to human 
: rights as long as it is revealed and 
repaired. 
To mark the 60th anniversary of the 
Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights, the Courier presents some 
backward glances that can help us 
move forward. 
In our editorial, Pierre Sané, 
UNESCO's Assistant Director-General 
for Social and Human Sciences, 
reviews the status of the dignity of 
the individual in the world today.

### 183348: Human rights, human dignity

HUMAN RIGHTS, HUMAN DIGNITY 
Sixty years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, what is the 
reality for individual dignity and observance of human rights, in a world where billions 
of people suffer from poverty? Safeguarding the ideals and missions contained in the 
Declaration means fighting poverty. 
Pierre San 8, UNESCO Assistant Director-General for Social and Human Sciences 
ll international texts on the pro- 
tection of human rights are 
based on the concept of human 
dignity, as proclaimed in the pream- 
ble of the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights. Often the concept is 
understood more through what 
assaults or opposes it, not what 
enriches and honours it; undoubted- 
ly this is because of its very particu- 
lar background, in the aftermath of 
the Holocaust and Nazi death 
machine. This strong affirmation of 
dignity shared by all humankind 
leads to the first and most famous 
article of the Declaration: “All human 
beings are born free and equal in 
dignity and rights. They are endowed 
with reason and conscience and 
should act towards one another in a 
spirit of brotherhood.” 
But equal dignity for all human 
beings does not generate only rights. 
In addition, and primarily, it repre- 
sents a call to action, vigilance and 
prevention. Recognizing our own dig- 
nity makes us answerable to every- 
one else; there can be no dignity 
without genuine solidarity and 
brotherhood. 
Sixty years after the adoption of the 
Declaration, where are we regarding 
fundamental respect for human dig- 
nity and integrity, these corner- 
stones of human rights? 
The UNESCO Courier ® 2008 ® Number 9 
We must recognize that today half 
the people in the world do not bene- 
fit even minimally from due consid- 
eration of their identity and their 
status, despite well-known interna- 
tional advances in domains as basic 
as the fight against torture, legal 
sanctions for assaults on women, or 
the recognition of the rights of refu- 
gees and migrants. 
The poverty that causes billions of 
people acute suffering obviously vio- 
lates the ideals promoted by the 
Declaration and calls into question 
Article 28: “Everyone is entitled to a 
social and international order in 
which the rights and freedoms set 
forth in this Declaration can be fully 
realized.” 
Defending the ideals and missions 
contained in the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights requires 
above all fighting poverty, this ten- 
tacular phenomenon. We know its 
causes, sometimes rooted in the 
social and cultural reality. 
The fight must first tackle prejudices, 
particularly the idea of human dig- 
nity as a mere refuge in face of the 
combined effects of discrimination, 
exclusion, inequality and injustice. 
The concept of human dignity goes 
far beyond that. It is inconceivable 
without the right to education, 
decent housing, sanitation. And it 
rejects resignation and helplessness 
in the face of situations experienced 
as inevitable. 
A single example to stress once more 
— the fight against extreme poverty - 
represents a problem that UNESCO, 
the NGOs, political decision-makers 
and civil society must put as first 
priority on their agenda. Their coop- 
eration is a decisive element in the 
fight to eradicate poverty and to 
ensure an international order that 
guarantee the observance of the 
rights contained in the Declaration. 
More than ever it is our duty to 
ensure the effective implementation 
of all the human rights in the 
Declaration. We must concretize this 
respect for human rights, which 
means simultaneously respect for the 
other in his difference and self- 
respect. [|

### 183347: Human rights are inalienable and indivisible

HUMAN RIGHTS ARE 
INALIENABLE AND 
INDIVISIBLE 
Stéphane Hessel, French-German diplomat and 
writer, participated in the great adventure that 
was the drafting of the 1948 Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights. Hessel, a concentration camp 
survivor, explains how the document is unique 
and why it must remain universal - but also why 
it might not be adopted today. 
Stéphane Hessel answers questions from 
Vincent Noce, French journalist. 
I What was the prevalent feeling 
when the Declaration was 
adopted? 
Relief. Don't forget we were already 
in the midst of growing opposition 
between the United States and the 
Soviet Union. Out of the first 50 
countries who were members of the

United Nations, 30 were Western. 
The battle was by no means already 
won. There were seven abstentions. 
As only the positive or negative 
votes were counted, the Declaration 
was adopted by consensus. The third 
UN general assembly (which adopted 
the Declaration) was held in Paris,

The building set to be the Manhat- 
tan headquarters was still under 
construction. The press was quite 
enthusiastic, but it didnt pay much 
attention to what was going on at 
the UN. Particularly in the European 
countries, which were rather 
nationalist. 
And the preliminary meetings? 
The first meeting of the nucleus 
committee was held in early 1946 in 
Manhattan. As for the secretariat, it 
was housed in a disaffected aero- 
nautics factory on Long Island. 
Sometimes we met in New York, 
other times in Geneva. René Cassin 
from France was one of the driving 
forces behind the preparation. It was 
thanks to him we were able to draft 
a text that was ambitious and unique 
in the history of international texts. 
We were working under the authority 
of Henri Laugier (France) who was 
the deputy secretary general for 
social issues and ceo

phrey from Canada, director of 
human rights, who had only one arm. 
It gave our committee a certain aura, 
because people thought he was a 
war invalid (note, his arm had been 
amputated when he was a child). 
Afterwards, when the Human Rights 
Commission was set up in 1947, it 
took over. It was chaired by Eleanor 
Roosevelt, who played a very active 
role. 
It should be noted that participants 
did not represent their governments. 
They were suggested by their govern- 
ments, according to their capacity, 
and picked by the secretary general. 
It gave us great freedom, although 
we were careful not to make things 
difficult for the states. René Cassin 
never had to report to the French 
government. 
As for me, I was called in February 
1946 to become Henri Laugier’s cabi- 
net director, which led me to get 
actively involved in these prepara- 
tions. I stayed at the UN for four 
years. It was an extraordinary period 
of expansion and innovation to make 
it the fine edifice it became. 
There were a few thorny issues in the 
committee, like the place of trust 
territories. We were still in the time 
of the Empires. But the main tension 
was between the West's emphasis on 
freedoms, versus the East's prefer- 
ence for economic and social rights. 
A “unique declaration”, you said? 
Already in the preamble, it stipula- 
tes the universal right to human 
dignity. That was our objective, after 
all the tragedies we'd lived through, 
from Auschwitz to Hiroshima... The

unquestionable leadership of Roose- 
velt in a strong institution that 
affirmed the person's rights and 
freedoms. 
The League of Nations (forerunner of 
the UN) had peacekeeping as its 
goal, but it did not concern itself 
with individuals. As for the 1789 
Declaration of the Rights of Man and 
of the Citizen, its purpose was to 
protect the citizen against the arbi- 
trariness of royal power. The whole 
ideology of human rights was thus 
positioned between power and those 
it dominated. But to extend this pro- 
tection to an international level, and 
even universal, that was very bold. 
This was the innovation: we are 
responsible for human dignity and 
the rights of the person. It was 
democracy’s catechism. In other 
words, we do not govern for the 
pleasure of power, but to guarantee 
the exercise of a democratic society. 
We were able to declare that govern- 
ments could be held responsible for 
the rights of their citizens. 
We had affirmed the universal 
responsibility of human rights. The 
word “universal” is obviously 
fundamental. 
How could the Khmer Rouge hold a 
seat in the United Nations? 
There were no criteria for admission 
to the UN, like the ones Europeans 
are imposing today on new European 
Union members. States that had 
gained independence automatically 
became members. It was inevitable, 
but it had consequences. 
The UN wager was the following: 
countries must come in, and once 
they were in, they had to be led to 
respect human rights. ceo

e o o Conflict - fundamental con- 
flict - therefore exists between 
diplomacy for peace and peace for 
human rights. 
These are concessions made to coop- 
eration. When we talk about diplo- 
macy for human rights, of course it 
implies obtaining states’ consent. 
The declaration is not a legally bin- 
ding treaty, even though it was fol- 
lowed by two pacts that are legal 
instruments ratified by states (note, 
the pact concerning civic and politi- 
cal rights and the pact covering eco- 
nomic, social and cultural rights 
adopted by the UN General Assembly 
in 1966). We can incite states to 
ratify pacts, we can say to them 
watch out! We'll bring charges 
against you to the Human Rights 
Commission. But there have been no 
exclusions with the exception of 
South Africa, for apartheid. 
Some criticize human rights rheto- 
ric for its strictly western values. 
Human rights are inalienable and 
indivisible. We must absolutely resist 
relativism. We cannot plead cultural 
differences to deny them. Moreover, 
western countries can be just as 
guilty, look at the prisons in Guanta- 
namo and Abu Ghraib. It isn’t 
because theyre western that they're 
any less responsible. We have to 
remain faithful to the principle of 
universality - it is fundamental. 
We can wonder whether the Decla- 
ration would have a chance of 
being adopted today as it was in 
1948. 
The circumstances aren't conducive. 
The shock of the Second World War 
made possible such radical ambition. 
Yet we could have a comparable 
shock tomorrow, notably about 
saving the planet. Or wild financiali- 
zation of the economy. If we were 
terrified by a worsening crisis, a text 
with the same range, about the envi- 
ronment, for instance, could have 
the same chance of success. Whereas 
60 years ago we weren't ready. |

### 183352: Capturing the essence of absence

CAPTURING THE ESSENCE OF ABSENCE 
Argentine photographer Gustavo Germano’s exhibition, “Absences”, explores the universe 
of the victims of “disappearances” during Argentina's “Dirty War” (1976-1983). Photos are 
juxtaposed in pairs, one old and one recent. On the new one, a person is missing. Disappeared 
for ever, without leaving a trace. 
Interview conducted by Lucia Iglesias and Casey Walther (UNESCO). 
  
In your photo exhibition “Absences”, 
you have documented the repres- 
sion that occurred in Argentina. 
Why is it important to document 
these violations of human rights, 
instead of allowing these painful 
memories to rest, as some have 
suggested? 
Some of the gravest human rights 
offenses, in my opinion, are those 
committed by States - that is to say, 
when the State is the agent of terror 
and becomes an instrument of illegal 
repression by using methods so per- 
verse as the forced disappearance of 
people. These sorts of actions have 
consequences for society: Initially, 
there is the fear and uncertainty. Then 
  
  
The UNESCO Courier ® 2008 ® Number 9 
over time, there is the sense of not 
being able to mourn. 
So what I am trying to convey in my 
work is that, more than just the forced 
disappearances of people that hap- 
pened in Argentina, there is also the 
time that has passed. I want to reflect 
the double effect that time has had. 
On the one hand, there is the time 
that the survivors endured while living 
in the absence of their lost loved one. 
On the other hand, there is the time 
forfeited by the persons who disap- 
peared and did not have a chance to 
live out their lives. When I was creat- 
ing the concept of this show, I thought 
that it would be good to capture the 
aging of the survivors. And it is this 
very basic and human concept that 
the terrorism of the State destroyed. 
How did your work develop with 
the relatives of those who 
disappeared? 
In all cases there were moments where 
real connections were made and where 
they relived the moment in the origi- 
nal photo. It was truly a journey to 
the past and, at the same time, a look 
into the future. There were cases 
where some of the relatives had never 
since returned to the place in the ori- 
ginal photo. I don't know whether it 
was consciously or instinctively, but 
every one of the relatives XY)

eee gave me their complete trust to 
work with them. I think this is reflec- 
ted in the photos. Personally, I am 
humbled to have been the vehicle 
through which these people were able 
to denounce these crimes, and to 
have created the moment that allowed 
this to be conveyed. I also believe 
that, even though my intention was 
not to do an autobiographical project, 
the fact that I myself experienced 
losing someone in my family to these 
same crimes has allowed a greater 
rapport with these people, because 
between us there is a shared brothe- 
rhood. And through this project, my 
own family has been able to grow. 
What's more, all the people that I pho- 
tograph are from the Entre Rios 
Province in Argentina, where suppos- 
edly “nothing happened”. I come from 
that province, and I felt that it was 
important to document cases of disap- 
pearances that were not known and 
affected normal people from distant 
villages and to show that the tragedy 
affected this province as well. 
What is the current situation in 
Argentina with respect to these 
crimes? 
In Argentina, they have abolished the 
laws that, until recently, had hampe- 
red the prosecution of those 
responsible for these crimes. Little by 
little, these people are finally being 
brought to trial, although to defend 
themselves theyre evoking the time 
that has passed and arguing that pro- 
secution should wait until their lives 
have ended since they are already very 
old. Nonetheless, a few have been 
convicted, which we of course 
applaud. This is why my work tries to 
raise public awareness of this issue. 
In 1999, UNESCO awarded its Prize for 
Peace Education to the Mothers of the 
Plaza de Mayo, an association of moth- 
ers whose children disappeared in that 
period. [|

### 183353: Ideology clashing with history

IDEOLOGY CLASHING WITH HISTORY 
Early in the decade, a woman raised her voice against 
Hindu fundamentalism asserting Aryan superiority. 
And she was heard. Her name: Romila Thapar. The 
famous Indian historian explains here how spurious 
identities founded on pseudo-historical arguments 
affect human rights. 
Romila Thapar is professor emeritus of History at 
Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi, and one of the 
world’s foremost experts of ancient Indian history. Her 
seminal work, “History of India, Vol. 1” has been in print 
ever since it was first published in 1966. Dr. Thapar, who 
believes in interpreting ancient Indian texts in the light 
of new insights, has taught at top institutions including 
Oxford University, Cornell, the College de France in Paris,

and the University of London. She has been involved in her 
country’s debates about historical truth, political identity and social reform.

You have strongly opposed the 
attempt to use history in support 
of an ideology of religious nation- 
alism by the right-wing Hindu 
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), 
which was in power from 1998 to 
2004. There was an attempt at the 
time to rewrite Indian textbooks. 
How does the rewriting of history 
The UNESCO Courier ® 2008 © Number 9 
to endorse recent political 
ideology affect human 
rights? 
Let me clarify here that my 
fight was against the BJP- 
led government and the Hin- 
dutva view of Indian history, 
and not against other govern- 
ments in India. The Hindutva 
lobby that insisted on the 
changes in Indian textbooks 
endorses a Hindu right-wing 
ultra-nationalism - often 
described as Hindu funda- 
mentalism - and is trying to propa- 
gate a revisionist history in 
classrooms and political discourse. 
The parent organization in India, 
known as the Rashtriya Swayamse- 
vak Sangh (RSS), has a distinctly 
religious fundamentalist political 
agenda. The RSS and its political 
arm, the Bharatiya Janata Party 
(BJP), gained power defeating mode- 
rate secular Indians by exploiting 
Hindu nationalist sentiments. The 
RSS has been involved in several 
high-profile incidents of religiously 
motivated violence over the last 
twenty years. 
The controversy on my work involved 
some textbooks I had written for 
middle schools, where I had talked 
about the lives of Aryans as we knew 
it from the Vedic texts. I had men- 
tioned, for instance, that the early 
Indians ate beef - the references in 
the Vedas are clear, and there is 
archaeological evidence for this. The 
Hindu right wing extolled the Aryans 
as the great model society for ancient 
India, and were opposed to any criti- 
cism of them. When they objected to 
this and other statements of mine, I 
provided evidence coe

### 183353: Ideology clashing with history

eee from the texts as proof. But 
they insisted that children should 
not be told that beef was eaten in 
early times. My reaction was that it 
was historically more correct to 
explain to school children why in 
early times beef was eaten, and why 
later a prohibition was introduced. 
Though the attack on me was vicious, 
I was not the only historian attacked. 
There were about six of us, who had 
authored the earlier textbooks, and 
others who spoke up against the 
changes in school curriculum and 
textbooks by the (then) government, 
made without consulting educational 
bodies that would normally have 
been consulted. The government 
then described us as being anti- 
Hindu, and therefore anti-Indian, 
and therefore anti-patriotic, and 
therefore, traitors. 
The deletion of passages from our 
books and the ban on any discussion 
of the deleted passages raised a 
number of issues of various kinds 
pertaining to the rights of individu- 
als and the ethics of government 
institutions. 
There was also a virulent protest 
by some Indians living in the 
United States when the US Library 
of Congress appointed you as the 
first Kluge Chair in Countries and 
Cultures of the South in 2004. 
What became of these protests and 
were textbooks revised when the 
Congress government replaced the 
Bharatiya Janata Party in New 
Delhi? 
The Library of Congress rejected 
without any hesitation the demand 
from the Hindutva lobby, particu- 
larly Indians living in the United 
States, to reverse my appointment, 
therefore the demand was slowly

silenced. The abuse online and 
through e-mails continued 
unabated. 
When the Congress reclaimed power 
in 2004, it decided to do away with 
all the previous textbooks, written 
by us as far back as the 1960s and 
70s, as well as those produced by the 
BJP government just prior to its fall. 
A new set of books was commis- 
sioned, which are now in use. They 
are different from the ones we wrote 
and reflect some of the new interests 
in history as a discipline, and do not 
push a Hindutva hard line. 
The worrying thing is, what will 
happen if the Bharatiya Janata Party 
returns to power in the next elec- 
tion, which will be held within 12 
months? Will they change the text- 
books again? I worry for the school 
children who have to be examined in 
the subject and depend on 
textbooks. 
Once we accept one religious group's 
agenda and beliefs to be taught in 
the public schools, it opens the door 
for every other group to do the same 
thing. As educators, we have to make 
a distinction between history on the 
one hand, which involves question- 
ing existing knowledge about the 
past where necessary, and faith on 
the other hand, where even myths 
are acceptable. The two have to be 
kept separate. The first is the domain 
of the historian and the second that 
of the priest. 
On a wider international level, 
many human rights atrocities in 
recent years have sought to draw 
legitimacy from history, using the 
pretext of setting right the wrongs 
of the past. How can this be 
avoided? 
Political parties today draw heavily

### 183354: Spain: pact of oblivion

SPAIN: 
Pact oF OBLIVION 
Nearly 70 years after its civil war, Spain has yet 
to establish an accurate tally of the victims of 
repression during Franco's regime. Thousands 
of citizens want to know where their murdered 
relatives were buried. No investigations, no trial, 
were held. Only now is the country beginning to 
uncover this part of its past. 
Antonio Gonzalez Quintana, President of the Spanish 
Association of Archivists as civil servants 
altasar Garzén, judge of the 
National Audience, one of Spain's 
highest courts, decided last August 
to start a investigation to locate 
those who disappeared during the 
civil war and its aftermath. This is 
very new for Spain, which had drawn 
a veil over these events until

Thirty years have passed since the 
death of the dictator Franco and nearly

70 years since the end of the civil war, 
but we still have no real measure of 
the full impact of political repression, 
illustrated by a total number of vic- 
tims. Thousands of people have no 
reliable information on where their 
missing relatives were buried. 
Unlike other European 
countries emerging 
from dictatorships 
around the same time, 
Spain never launched 
investigations or 
staged a trial. The 
archives remained 
under the “pact of 
forgetting” tacitly 
imposed by the tran- 
sitional government. 
This contributed to 
the 1977 amnesty law 
that freed imprisoned 
Franco opponents, 
allowed the return of 
those in exile, but 
also relieved the military and previous 
regime's high officials of any responsi- 
bility for suspected atrocities. 
In fact, numerous collections of doc- 
uments were destroyed or lost; others

remained inaccessible for decades. 
Even today the main documents 
referring to repression under Franco’s 
rule are either unavailable for public 
use or so badly preserved they are 
unusable. Even worse: since 1977, no 
government has managed to regulate 
the military justice archives, which 
exist in a legal void. 
Resurrecting the past 
But Spain could not for long remain 
opposed to the general trend, begin- 
ning in the 1990s, to uncover the 
truth about crimes against humanity. 
The duties of memory, truth and jus- 
tice converged within this movement 
into a single cause. Following the 
Truth Commissions experience and 
the creation in 1998 of the 
International Criminal Court, after 
the trials of General Pinochet and 
the junta in Argentina, associations 
for the recovery of historical memory 
sprang up all over Spain. 
The year 2006 was declared the Year 
of Historical Memory by the congress 
of deputies (Congreso de los 
Diputados), and revealing XY

eee the past became one of the 
main thrusts of Rodriguez Zapatero’s 
government in his first mandate 
(April 2004 - March 2008), after 
which the “law of historical memory” 
was passed. 
Historical memory

Nonetheless, all the new govern- 
ment’s good intentions have not pro- 
duced any strategies to preserve 
archives. Only the creation in 2008 
of the Historical Memory Document 
Centre - a controversial project, its 
structure and nature still in need of 
clear definition - can be cited as a 
concrete measure taken by the 
Spanish government in this domain. 
In contrast, the large collections of 
military documents considered secret 
(in some cases containing documents 
dating back to 1905, but mainly 
extensive documentation on the 
1936-1977 period) are still waiting to

be opened for consultation. As for 
the archives of the military tribunals, 
they will only be useable when they 
are assigned an appropriate location 
and an entity or organization to 
manage them. 
Moreover, the general government 
archives and the national historical 
archives are unable to process more 
material, due to saturation of their 
library space and limited staff already 
hard put to meet current challenges. 
Spain needs concrete measures, not 
declarations about the importance of 
knowing the truth about the past, so 
often used as a weapon against 
political opponents. It must pass 
legislation to regulate access to 
information and clearly define the 
structure of its archive system, set- 
ting out responsibilities and duties 
regarding the country’s documentary 
heritage. u

eee Of what is believed to be a 
national culture, THE national 
culture. This is never questioned, 
because if you question it, you 
become a traitor to the nation. And 
it is usually a single, carefully selec- 
ted strand from the broader culture 
which is drawn out and exaggerated, 
and this facilitates the potential 
exclusion of some citizens on the 
basis of either religion or race or 
language or whatever identity is 
conveniently within reach. This is 
very harmful to issues of human 
rights, because it gives priority to 
certain groups and their cultures 
over others. 
But isn’t it a dangerous notion, for 
those in power to believe they can 
set right the wrongs of the past? 
This is a commonly made claim. We 
have an example, in the Indian case, 
where a Hindu political faction led 
by BJP leaders destroyed the (16th 
century) Babri Masjid at Ayodhya (in 
Northern India) in 1992, and claimed 
that they were avenging Mahmud of 
Ghazni's attack on Somnath (a Hindu 
temple) and thereby setting right 
this wrong of the past. 
First of all, did it have to take a 
thousand years before this act (of 
Ghazni) was avenged if indeed the 
idea was to avenge it? More impor- 
tant, how did it set right the wrongs 
of the past? What was the result of 
the destruction of the Babri Masjid? 
It made not the slightest difference 
to our reading of the past. What it 
did was that it resulted in a massacre 
of Muslims in (the Western Indian 
state of) Gujarat, and since then, a 
continued series of bomb explosions 
in the major cities of the country. So 
what is argued as setting right the 
wrongs of the past cannot be set 
right in this fashion. And in any case, 
it's a rather silly argument, because 
the past is that which has happened. 
It cannot be changed, and therefore, 
it’s much more important to set right 
the wrongs of the present, rather 
than harping on what might have 
been the wrongs of the past. u

### 183358: The Fourth dimension

THE FOURTH DIMENSION 
I serve those who lived in 1600 and I'm serving those who 
will live in 2200, says Librarian and Archivist of Canada Ian 
Wilson. He promotes digitization and free acess to archives, 
which can play a crucial role in the fight against human 
rights violations. 
Ian Wilson, who was elected president of the International Council 
on Archives (ICA) in July, answers the questions of Jens Boel, 
UNESCO's head archivist. 
Archives and human right was the 
topic of the International Confer- 
ence of the Round Table on 
Archives (CITRA), a conference 
that you presided in Cape Town 
(South Africa) in 2003. Shouldn't 
archivists leave human rights to 
politicians? 
The archival world is not passive. We 
are actively engaged in sculpting 
social memory. 
In Cape Town, we looked at the rela- 
tion between archives, human rights 
and the protection of minorities. We 
had the pleasure of meeting 
Archbishop Desmond Tutu (South- 
African, Nobel Peace Prize, 1984) 
who said archives are the bulwark 
against atrocities we must never 
forget. He was engaged in this issue 
and he understands the absolute 
power of the record. 
Under former repressive regimes in 
South America, colleagues struggled 
to keep a record of the disappeared, 
those citizens who had run up against 
the regime in power and simply dis- 
appeared from the face of the Earth. 
Democratic countries have similar 
problems. During decades, the 
Canadian government supported 
residential schools, those boarding

schools maintained by churches to 
assimilate indigenous children. The 
children lost their language, their 
culture, their family, their identity. 
The government has apologized to 
the survivors and we have estab- 
lished a Truth and Reconciliation 
Commission. The Canadian Archives 
are very active in making available 
the existing record about this trau- 
matizing experience. We are also 
going to work with the Commission 
to preserve the testimonies and 
documents families bring forward. 
Why is it so important to come to 
terms with the painful past? 
We need to learn. The society needs 
to understand itself, to look at its 
strengths and weaknesses as it deals 
with the challenges of the future. In 
Canada, we are trying to build a truly 
multicultural society that respects 
and engages all cultures... The 
record on residential schools sat in 
archives for decades and decades, 
nobody ever looked at it. Finally the 
society was ready and began asking 
questions. 
There is an interesting dynamic going 
on as to how the society engages 
with its past. Archivists have a role 
in enabling that and in making sure 
that we take a comprehensive and 
 
very systematic approach to the 
preservation of the record. 
How shall the International Coun- 
cil on Archives (ICA) support 
human rights? 
We are not very structured to do 
advocacy. However, one thing we 
passed the motion on in Cape Town 
was to support our colleagues who 
work to preserve records under 
repressive regimes and very difficult 
conditions. 
Maybe we can engage some of the 
agencies of the United Nations who 
might be able to assist and put some 
pressure to bear, to bring the archi- 
val dimension to attention. Maybe 
there is room for us to talk to 
Amnesty International too. 
Do you believe ICA should take a 
public stand in situations where 
fundamental “archives rights” are 
violated? For example, in the case 
of systematic destruction of 
records or denial of citizens’ right 
to have access to archives. 
ICA could muster some of its network 
through one of its key elements: the 
professional associations around the 
world. There are ways ICA could 
monitor the situations, develop the 
facts and get the news YY

### 183358: The Fourth dimension

eee to professional associations, 
with some advice on how to commu- 
nicate with the national govern- 
ments and other bodies involved. All 
of this depends on capacity and 
capability, but the capacity of ICA 
to really pull out together and send 
out news notes and suggestions is 
limited. There are things one would 
like to do and there are things one 
can do. 
What is the role of archives and 
record management in conflict and 
post-conflict societies? Do you see 
issues of governance and building 
of democracies as priorities for 
ICA? 
We need to study how we can be 
effective. The Archivist of the United 
States, Allen Weinstein, and myself 
have already been to visit with col- 
leagues in Israel and Palestine. We 
looked at the importance of the 
shared record to develop understan- 
ding of people in a very difficult 
region of the world who frankly have 
certain elements of a shared history 
and a shared documentation. 
There are common needs there. Both 
the Palestinian Authority and the 
Israeli Archives talked to us about 
training and digitization of records 
of common interest. The Israeli 
Archives have been very generous, 
saying they have certain series of

records inherited from the British 
that they would be delighted to see 
digitized and shared. They have 
census records back to the Ottoman 
empire for that area! Can't we get 
them up online and available? There 
are in Israel significant collections 
of Palestinian newspapers from the 
1920s to 1948 in horrendous condi- 
tion, brittle and fragile, that need to 
be preserved. There are ways the 
international community can work in 
those situations, but in areas like 
Afghanistan and Sudan, where it is 
deeply troubled, I'm not so sure. 
What is the relation between 
archives, truth, memory and history? 
To me, archives are the fundamental 
source material, a mean of communi- 
cation across time. We 
allow the generations 
to talk to each other, 
we work in the fourth 
What we 
preserve and maintain, 
dimension. 
what we inherit from 
our predecessors and 
what we add ourselves 
are all part of this com- 
munication process. 
Each generation asks 
questions about its past, depending 
on its concerns about its future. To 
me, archives are essentially about 
the future. 
Human rights issues right now are 
very important for societies. As I 
said before, many records on human 
rights sat on the shelves for decades, 
for example in Canada, and nobody 
looked at them. Only when society 
was ready to look and learn about 
such things, we began to see these 
records used. 
Truth is a difficult issue. We can 
never document a society in all its 
complexities and diversity to get the 
whole truth. 
But I think archives really are about 
that dialogue across generations. The 
current population of Canada is about 
30 million but I serve 300 million 
Canadians. I serve those who lived in 
1600, I'm serving those who will live 
in 2200. [|

You recently coined the concept of 
“urban intensification”. What does 
it mean? 
By around 2050, one of two Africans 
will be living in an urban environ- 
ment, if the growth of cities in 
Africa continues at the current pace. 
Yet there is no surge of industriali- 
zation to go with the urbanization 
that would make it possible to offer 
hopes for the future to those who 
leave the rural areas. In European 
countries, the rural exodus went 
hand in hand with an industrial revo- 
lution. Those who arrived in the 
towns came to take work, jobs and 
positions created by industry. This is 
not at all the case in Africa. 
Millions of people are crowded into 
shantytowns, on vacant lots, getting 
by as best they can. There is no real 
preliminary urban planning - no 
housing, no drinking water, no

plumbing or electricity. Shelters 
spring up in a completely chaotic 
way. 
The expression “urban intensifica- 
tion” designates both the way in 
which people arriving from the coun- 
try take over this new space, by 
transposing their own ways of life 
there, and the transformations that 
thus take place at the level of values: 
the solidarity, sharing, generosity, 
sense of the collective that charac- 
terize our way of life are rapidly 
corroded. 
Do you see risks in terms of 
“human security”? 
“Human security”... It's a good thing 
this notion emanating from UNESCO 
is being imprinted on peoples minds, 
because security is linked not only 
to the fight against organized crime 
or terrorism, but also to life in gene- 
ral and to the future. Yet a complete 
uncertainty about the future is pre- 
cisely the most deeply rooted feeling 
in young Africans. It produces a fear 
of tomorrow, and this fear can in 
turn give rise to ethnic or religious 
fragmentation. In addition, the run- 
down and overburdened state of the 
institutions supposed to forge the 
future, such as schools and universi- 
ties, adds to human insecurity and 
adds to democratic disenchantment. 
You said “democratic dis- 
enchantment”? 
The daunting question that our 
societies must answer today is: what 
degree of poverty is compatible with 
normal democratic development? 
Senegal often serves as an example 
of democracy in Africa. 
It's true, elections are organized 
there regularly, and eco

eee those in power admit defeat 
and congratulate the winner. But is 
that enough? The prevailing level of 
poverty produces a despair that com- 
pels young people literally to throw 
themselves in the water to get 
away. 
For a long time, we analyzed emigra- 
tion as the search for greater eco- 
nomic and social well-being 
somewhere else. What is troubling is 
that today everybody knows this 
elsewhere is not paradise! They know 
it! On the other hand, they know that 
where they live, that’s hell. When a 
continent’s youth thinks its future 
lies elsewhere, we are forced to take 
notice. 
Can the pan-African ideal, which 
you say is resurgent, perhaps pro- 
vide impetus against this despair? 
The failure of the African state has 
already been noted. The African 
nation state is much too small to 
provide a real space for develop- 
ment. So the idea of an African 
union seems good to me, because it 
can offer larger spaces by decentra- 
lizing, by giving an expression to all 
differences, including the smallest 
ones that exist at a regional level. 
An integrated Africa can stand up to 
the trend towards fragmentation 
that we see here and there. 
The consolidation of States is the 
best response to young people and 
to the outside pressure of globaliza- 
tion. That's why I sometimes use the 
very American expression of “new 
frontier”. We have to imagine some 
form of future opportunities for the 
youth of our continent. 
Do you believe that the international 
community and the donor countries 
will think it is in their interest to 
support this integration? 
These outside communities do indeed 
realize that in helping us they are 
helping themselves. Our emigrants 
are their immigrants, after all. 
Recently we're talking about “co- 
development” again. It's time to 
flesh out that concept. If it consists 
of sprinkling a little money on our 
countries, it's ineffective. In con- 
trast, if the necessary measures are 
put into it, to help us build viable 
spaces of development, it takes on 
its full meaning. 
The African states and the European 
states can coordinate to allocate 
development aid to the creation of a 
physical space for integration. They 
can say to themselves - let us build 
together the infrastructure for devel- 
opment and leave the development 
for the people's initiatives. That's 
what helping means to me. If the 
continent’s young people feel this 
space exists and it is open to their 
imagination, their spirit of enter- 
prise, we will see their initiatives 
blossom. 
In Making peace with the earth 
(UNESCO, 2007), you advocate a 
“cosmology of emergence”. How 
should this be understood? 
The cosmology of emergence means 
the cosmos is alive, it evolves 
constantly. This theory of evolution 
must be a way of thinking about the 
world and of ourselves in the world. 
It can make us conscious of our res- 
ponsibility to bring the whole earth 
into being, which is at the same time 
humanity and nature. 
Humans are conscious of the world’s 
direction, while other living beings 
are subjected to this evolution. 
Because they have this conscious- 
ness, they have the responsibility for 
supporting this evolution, towards 
the positive, towards sustainable 
development. It's a responsibility we 
must imbue ourselves with to per- 
petuate the movement. 
You suggest establishing the pact 
of our responsibility towards 
nature in an “inter-human pact”. 
I don't much like the expression 
natural contract, or with nature. 
Nature is not a legal entity, we can’t 
sign a contract with it. It is between 
ourselves, we humans, that we make 
contracts. And our duty towards 
nature is a duty of humanity. It is 
because we are humans that we have 
the duty to safeguard the earth for 
future generations. And to be 
modern is to link a constantly emer- 
ging cosmology with the political 
work of broadening an open 
society. u

RESTORING AFRICA'S DIGNITY 
The Professor, his compatriots affectionately nicknamed 
him. His ambition: to unite science, consciousness 
and life as much as possible, to create a “different 
world”. Joseph Ki-Zerbo was born in Toma (Burkina 
Faso) on 21 June 1922; he died on 4 December 2006 
in Ouagadougou. 
Joseph Ki-Zerbo was one of the fathers of modern 
African historiography, the high point of which was 
the publication of eight volumes of “General History of Africa” 
(UNESCO Publishing, 1970-1990). A member of the scientific 
committee for the production of this collective work, Ki-Zerbo played a key role in the pioneering 
project.

ost African countries gained 
Mi: independence in the 
1960s. These new circumstances 
called for a decolonization of his- 
tory. Theories - including Hegel's - 
that kept Africa on the sidelines of 
history (calling it an “ahistorical” 
continent) had greatly influenced 
Europe-centred approaches to the 
African past: African history was 
considered an appendix to European 
history. African oral traditions were 
considered unreliable “repetitive 
memory” and could not, according 
to those fixated on writing, serve as 
a source for history. It was even for- 
gotten that Africa was not only a 
reservoir of oral tradition but had a 
long tradition of writing, not just in 
Egypt but also in Ethiopia, Mali (Tim- 
buktu), Nigeria (Kano) and Tanzania 
(Kilwa). 
Joseph Ki-Zerbo, alongside Cheick 
Anta Diop from Senegal, was the 
standard-bearer for decolonizing

African history. His intellectual lead- 
ership was key within the so-called 
“1956 generation” that set the foun- 
dations of African history “starting 
from the African matrix”, by ridding 
it of racist prejudice. Breaking with 
earlier approaches and methods that 
were inappropriate for reconstituting 
the African continent's past, the 
Professor pushed for acceptance of 
traditional African oral traditions as 
historical sources, in addition to 
written and archaeological sources. 
He called into question the idea of 
prehistory referring to the period 
preceding the invention of writing, 
which particularly on the African 
continent was rich in creativity. He 
directed Volume I of the “General 
History of Africa” published by 
UNESCO (1970-1990), devoted to this 
topic of African prehistory as well as 
to problems of methodology. 
In addition, his “Histoire de l'Afrique 
Noire d’hier a demain” (1972) (History 
of Black Africa) is the pivotal text 
that represents a new approach to 
African history, one that tries to 
identify the internal and external 
processes that can explain the long- 
term evolution of the continent.

### IGNORE

Historian and activist 
Ki-Zerbo’s intellectual opus cannot 
be analyzed separately from his 
political activism, which began when 
he was a young student and partici- 
pated in the founding of different 
political parties including the 
Mouvement de Liberation Nationale 
(MLN, National Freedom Movement), 
to promote independence and unity 
on the continent. A staunch pan- 
Africanist, supporter of N'Krumah 
(Ghana) and Patrice Lumumba 
(Congo), he made a point throughout 
his life of turning his thoughts into 
actions. In this spirit he cofounded 
the African Historians Association, 
of which he was president from 1972 
to 2001. He expressed his commit- 
ment to defending human dignity on 
every front. 
For Ki-Zerbo, “The real historian is 
the intellectual in the polis, the 
organic intellectual involved in his 
environment while maintaining a 
certain distance, without which he 
would be a mere partisan.” His edify- 
ing analyses of today’s challenges - 
development, 
education, environment, identities - 
gave rise to a series of books with 
evocative titles: “Educate or Perish” 
(1990), “The other's mat” (1992), 
“When Africa?” (2003). The knowl- 
edge and wisdom that impregnate his 
work give it universal impact. It is 
rooted in humanism, fed by profound 
African values and inviting otherness 
(the kind that does not alienate) to 
build “a different world” of solidarity 
and mutual respect.
