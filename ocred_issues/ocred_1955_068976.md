HERE seems to be an unfortunate prejudice today that 
puppet shows are merely a form of entertainment for 
children. While it is true that children and youngsters 
make an ideal audience since they are more apt to accept 
fantasies as perfectly natural, the scope of the puppet is 
much wider. What a pity to want to limit it to juvenile 
entertainment. 
The puppet theatre is of universal appeal and can offer 
rich nourishment to people of all ages, to the ordinary citizen 
as well as to the highly cultivated. In the Far East, puppetry 
has for many hundreds of years been considered on a par 
with the highest forms of theatrical art. In the past quarter 
of a century a great puppetry revival has been taking place 
in Western Europe and in North and South America. 
Professional showmen are today touring their own and 
foreign countries with fully equipped theatres in which 
serious, full-length adult dramas are staged, sometimes with 
many hundreds of puppets. 
In ever-increasing numbers adults are coming to recognize 
the puppet theatre's unique quality as a versatile form of art 
and entertainment. The moving figures often transcend 
human actors. They can be shaped to play any role. They 
can be realistic, expressionistic, fantastic or satirical. They 
can present classical drama, ballet, comedy or farce. They 
are being used in hospitals as a form of therapeutic 
treatment for children and adults. They are an excellent 
drawing-card in shop windows and for advertisements 
generally. And they have found new, sparkling roles in the 
cinema and in television. Their possibilities are as vast as 
they themselves may be small. Puppet shows exist today for 
almost every occasion and every type of audience. 
Perhaps the most recent development of puppetry has been 
its widespread adoption by schools in nmiany countries as a 
handicrait subject. Teachers who have pulled strings or 
manipulated fists and fingers realize the power of puppetry 
in freeing the student from self-consciousness and physical 
limitations, and in releasing untapped depths of emotion and 
imagination. Puppetry is a unifying factor in the school 
curriculum. Through it. pupils gain both in their social 
relationships and in knowledge and skills. Making a puppet 
and building a puppet theatre develops skill in drawing, 
cutting, carving, modelling, embroidering, and painting. 
Staging a puppet play develops imagination and writing 
ability and is excellent training for the eye and the ear. 
At the university level puppets can be used to present plays 
which cannot be performed as successfully by human actors. 
For experiments where the real stage is too expensive or 
unwieldy, the puppet theatre is usually ideal. Scenes acted 
out on a stage are much more forceful than if read from a 
book. Puppets have been used in foreign language courses, 
in history classes and for improvising current social and 
political events. 
Unesco is today using the puppet theatre at its two 
fundamental education centres in Mexico and Egypt as well 
as in Thailand to dramatize the advantages of reading and 
writing, of brushing one’s teeth and keeping clean. Where 
other educational methods have failed, thé puppet has often 
succeeded in getting results. Jules Romains foresaw the 
versatility of puppets when he wrote: “The day puppets 
resu their proper place among us, those people who dis- 
misSed them will be amazed to see how much they are really 
capable of doing.” :

gathered than the fields are ploughed and, at the same 
time, sown; year in year out, each acre yields cereals, 
then fodder, and then cotton. It is the land where the fields 
are ever green—the Nile delta, which for 5,000 years has 
produced the finest crops in the world. 
Nor have the peasants any easier lot. Regularly, at the 
appointed hour, they must irrigate the flelds : the water 
must be pumped, directed into a complex network of cuts, 
and distributed; every inch of ground must be flooded for 
just the necessary length of time; the channels must be filled 
up and then opened again. The men never part from their 
fas, the proverbial hoe so often depicted by 
the Pharaonic painters in their frescoes ; 
it is an all-purpose tool, almost the only 
tool they have. 
All day long they dig, weed, cart compost, 
clean the canals and, waist-deep in water, 
work the Archlmedean screws, or toil at the 
ancient swing-plough which has no wheel 
or mould-board, or work on their knees in

presenting a train, the sea, a steamer, or famous monuments 
—which pilgrims returning from Jerusalem or Mecca paint 
on the front of their homes. Many of these houses are 
indeed more attractive than the square cement buildings of 
the capital ; yet the visitor wonders how anyone could 
possibly live in them. 
The fact remains that people do live—and die—in these 
dwellings with their mud floors. For the fellahin, the earth 
is never dirty—it is the earth. Likewise, for them, the water 
is never impure ; it is the sacred, life-giving water of the 
Nile ; if it were too clean and too well-flltered, many people 
would think it lifeless and useless. 
But life is perhaps not long in these 
surroundings ; few old folk are about in the 
villages ; that toothless, wrinkled, spent 
old woman in the street may not have seen 
60. All the same, the fellahin are rightly 
renowned for their strength and toughness, 
their muscular arms and broad shoulders 
—as are the girls for their supple sturdiness. 
There has been no degeneration in the race, 
  
the rich mud that they seem almost to be 
modelling into a fetish. Men of the earth 
indeed, they are wedded to the soil. They 
are the fellahin—a word that to the world           
it is said, since the epoch of the Pyramids. 
It might be said that their faces, too, are 
still as handsome ; but trachoma has too 
often overlaid their deep-set brown or black     suggests humility and poverty, but in fact 
means simply “farmers”. 
The women, too, work in the fields ; they 
look after the poultry, cows and black 
water-buffaloes ; they mould the slabs of 
cow-dung, the only form of fuel ; they go 
to market to sell eggs, fowls and vegetables, 
all packed into big bundles that they carry 
on their heads ; and as travellers say, they 
walk like goddesses, head erect, until they 
die. They prepare the evening meal and 
make bread, but cooking is the least of their 
burdens. The children, boys and girls 
alike, also have their set tasks ; at the age 
of 10 they are already experienced workers. 
Little importance is attached to villages 
and houses. Land is far too dear for the 
people to be able to build comfortably on it. Only the mosque 
and the church are relatively spacious. The little dried-mud 
houses, huddled together, have two or three dark rooms 
shared by people and animals alike. They are furnished with 
a marriage chest, a few bowls, and perhaps a mat or two— 
nothing more, In winter, the occupants sleep on the clay 
stove. 
In this province, known as Menufia, there are more than 
740 inhabitants to the square kilometre. The town of Menuf, 
45 miles distant from Cairo, has over 60,000 inhabitants, but 
Is smaller than the Park of Versailles. “Little villages” here 
may have five or ten thousand inhabitants ; the fellahin do 
not take up much space. 
From a distance these villages are a beautiful sight, nestling 
on the banks of a canal or pool, or in the fields under giant 
palms and eucalyptuses. The little houses, too, which line 
the smelly, unbearably dusty alley-ways, are often pleasingly 
built ; and some visitors admire the rough Ifrescoes—re- 
eyes with a whitish stain, or the eyelids are 
covered with pus. Whether of native stock 
or Arab origin, the Egyptians have always 
lived frugally ; but today they are stalked 
by hunger. Of all the crops they grow 
they only keep some ‘wheat or maize for 
making bread, some beans for making soup, 
and a few vegetables to eat raw. They 
work the same soil as their forbears, with 
the same tools, though their crops are worth 
more because of the cotton—thousands of 
acres, cared for like “gardens”. But land 
seems harder and harder to come by. 
For this is the vital fact : Seven or eight 
million men are working on the land in 
Egypt, and at least three million of them 
own the land they work. But most of them 
own less than a feddan (some one and a quarter acres), while 
the country’s population has doubled in 40 years, the area of 
land under cultivation has only increased by one quarter. 
These tireless workers, these sturdy fellahin, are all sick 
men. Ninety-two per cent of them suffer from bilharziasis, 
a disease caused by a microscopic worm which is peculiar to 
swampy land or irrigation channels. The worm breeds in 
the snails which abound in the irrigation cuts where men 
work, children bathe and women draw drinking-water. It 
penetrates the skin of human beings and circulates through 
the body, lodging in the intestines or bladder and eating 
them away. A vicious circle is set up : the infection leaves 
the body with the excrement, which goes into the irrigation 
canals, where the snails are waiting. And so on. Ninety- 
two per cent ! 
And besides endemic diseases there are other scourges. Of 
cholera there have been only sporadic outbursts since the 
1948 epidemic, but the threat is ever present. Malaria seems

Feluecas on the Nile 
The Great Nile—3,900 miles long from Lake 
Victoria to the Mediterranean—is Egypt's 
commercial highway and its source of life. 
The yearly flood of the Nile has for centuries 
been the secret of Egypt's fertility. The heavy 
April rains in the basin of the White Nile in 
Central Africa start the first flood and the May 
rains in Ethiopia give the real flood of rich 
muddy water that fertilizes as well as irrigates. 
The great dam at Aswan stores up the surplus 
flood and releases it later on, to water the Nile 
Valley all the year round. (Unesco photos)

now to be under control, as a result of the introduction of 
DDT as a prophylactic. (The last epidemic, in 1946, is 
thought to have cost a million lives.) Tuberculosis, however, 
is rife ; the Ministry of Health records 55,000 deaths from it 
every year, which means that some 500,000 people must be 
suffering from the disease, in its active or arrested form, and 
that the annual death-rate from it is about 200 per 100,000 
inhabitants. In France the corresponding figure is 42, in 
Denmark eight. 
It should be added that in Egypt, as in many Middle 
Eastern countries, infantile mortality amounts to over 65 
per cent in the first five years. Trachoma afflicts about half 
the population, or even more, for the primary stage often 
escapes diagnosis. Sufferers will not consult the doctor for 
“mere conjunctivitis”. 
But when such economic conditions are combined with lack 
of hygiene and over-population, it is not easy to find solutions 
which go to the root of the trouble. We cannot in this 
instance say “the Government need only do so and so”; 
Egypt's official social services are exemplary in their scope 
and good sense. 
But what can in fact be done, not to bring about miraculous 
reforms, but simply to help these people to lead lives that are 
less hard and less narrow? And, after that, how can they be 
brought to share in the economic, technical, political and 
cultural exchanges which are the currency of modern civili- 
zation? How can we turn this inarticulate people into a 
body of citizens enjoying full rights? These are the questions 
facing the hundred members of the Sirs-el-Layyan funda- 
mental education centre today. 
Sirs-el-Layyan, in the Menufia district, is a large straggling 
village where, in 1952, the Egyptian Government and Unesco, 
with the help of other United Nations Specialized Agencies, 
opened a training-centre for the men and women who will be 
in charge of fundamental education in the Arab countries. 
It is thus not an institution working for merely local progress 
and the benefit of the Egyptian fellahin alone. Candidates 
come to it from nine countries—Egypt, Iraq, Hashemite 
Kingdom of Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Palestine (Arab 
refugees), Saudi-Arabla, Syria and Yemen.

They are there to prepare themselves for the tasks awaiting 
them when they return to their homeland. But around Sirs- 
el-Layyan each member of the centre sees, basically, the 
same kind of peasant society that he has known in his own 
country. It isa form of society found—with, of course, many 
variations—throughout the Arab world. The Egyptian delta 
Is, however, a particularly valuable field for experiment 
because of the density of its population. Within a radius of 
a few miles a hamlet, a small town and five or six villages 
may be studied at the same time-—some of them quite 
flourishing, others completely poverty-stricken; some entirely 
Muslim, others with a Christian minority; some peopled by 
small farmers, others by day-labourers and workmen who 
own no land. 
It was, moreover, in this district that the Egyptian Gov- 
ernment a few years ago embarked on an educational and 
social service scheme which was to lead to a nation-wide 
enterprise for social and economic progress. The “social 
centres” found in several villages comprise dispensaries, 
maternity clinics and assembly rooms. Evening classes for 
illiterates have been started, health campaigns organized, 
and agricultural information offices opened; playgrounds 
have been provided for children, as well as garden plots for 
them to tend. Thus with the help of trained staff, and 
thanks to tried methods, as well as experiments (sometimes 
successful, sometimes a failure, but always providing a 
valuable lesson), the centre’s work is greatly facilitated. 
At all events, even though the surrounding villages are 
primarily the centre’s “laboratories”, the trainees know that 
their daily work must contribute to the people's welfare. If 
they fail here, what will they do later? The solutions they 
will have to apply then must be worked out now, on the spot. 
Picture a team of 10 or 12 trainees of every nationality 
represented at the centre. In front of them is a village, 
which is to be their village for the next two years, They 
rent a house there, and at first visit it for one day a week 
(later they will live in it permanently); they are really face 
to face with the village, and for weeks will be looked upon as 
strangers, intruders, embarrassing and embarrassed. 
They are not young students; their average age is 30. 
Some are university graduates, while others have already

started their careers as teachers, social workers, agricultural 
engineers, or nurses; there are specialists in adult education, 
in anti-epidemic work, or in education by visual aids. But 
at first they lose their self-confidence, and walk about like 
shy visitors. 
The village with which they have to contend is an 
amorphous mass of men and women whose first instinct is to 
reject, to mistrust. The fellahin generally expect nothing 
good from the ladies and gentlemen of the towns. For centu- 
ries the city’s only interest in them has been to send them 
masters, tax-collectors and police. It takes days and weeks 
of mutual observation, patient explanations and experience 
of working with others, before the students are accepted and 
their role understood. They have come to help the village a 
little. But what can be done without money? They are not 
going to build, or put in drinking-water, or dig a new irriga- 
tion canal, or distribute presents. And besides, what are 
their qualifications? 
“We simply want to help you help yourselves.” It is a good 
formula; but no amount of talking will make it understand- 
able to the peasants, who have little faith in novelties and 
automatically run away from the idea of any new scheme. 
The trainees look through their list (which they think they 
know by heart) of the needs of every village in the delta, 
needs that are doubtless those of every village in the East: 
economic reform, agriculture, hygiene, education. But where 
are they to begin, and how? Which men and women would 
it be best to approach first? 
The trainees soon discover the ganglia, the nervous system 
as it were, of the mass. They identify the village “notables” 
—peasants more prosperous or better educated than the rest, 
influential and respected priests or religious teachers, or 
young people with a taste for progress and action. The Sirs- 
el-Layyan centre has now been operating for two years. If 
its efforts in the villages selected had to be described in a 
single sentence, it could be said that in every instance the 
trainees had achieved something unheard of: they have 
created true communities. Using a variety of tactics, they 
are gradually bringing into being an organized village life, by 
giving self-realization to groups of men with a clvic 
  
  
    
conscience, potential “leaders” in a system which, based on 
service, is the nucleus of a local democracy. 
Of course, to start a sewing-school or a dispensary and 
attract women and children to it, it “was enough” to gain the 
confidence of the village; it seemed quite a simple matter. 
But such confidence is not easily gained—quite the contrary. 
It is not the custom for women to go out at will except when 
going to work, or for them to meet apart from their families; 
they are afraid of ridicule, and normally do not dare to 
venture into a quarter other than their own; and as for girls, 
they are expected to remain shut up at home from the 
beginning of puberty until marriage. 
These customs and conventions seemed immutable. Yet 
the young women trainees of the centre do not merely visit 
homes; because their own hostel is practically sacrosanct, 
they can, and regularly do, receive children, girls and married 
women there. The hostel at Deberki, for instance, is built on 
exactly the same lines as the rest of the village, mud walls, 
three rooms and a cattleshed under a single roof, a small 
closed court and a rickety staircase giving on to the roof- 
terrace. In other aspects, however, the difference leaps to 
the eye: the whole hostel is spotless and almost comfortable, 
and all at the price of no more than a little work, the aim 
being to show the villages by example that they too, without 
dipping into their pockets, can live in healthier and 
pleasanter houses. The lesson has driven itself home, and 
several families have built themselves well-ventilated, white- 
washed llving-rooms, which are swept every morning. 
Again, it was probably only necessary to win the trust of a 
few to persuade people that a “family” Kitchen garden was 
possible and profitable, A few square metres set aside for 
vegetables and fruits to be eaten in the household and not 
marketed can have an influence on the children’s diet out of 
all proportion to the expenses involved. Nor is Egypt the 
only country where we find peasant children wasting away 
for lack of vitamins. 
However, the Sirs-el-Layyan centre by no means confines 
itself to such undertakings as these, where success depends 
upon calling forth a friendly feeling that might prove very 
ephemeral. In the same village of Deberki which, lying at 
the far end of the irrigation system, has the least fertile

farmlands of the region, 150 peasants have combined to form 
a co-operative, contributing from their scanty resources at 
rates ranging from 50 piastres for the poorest to £E5 for the 
richest; and they have bought a tractor. Now these people 
are cautious and suspicious in the extreme; they are usually 
terrified by the idea of the slightest form of “investment” : 
being firmly convinced that money should be used only to buy 
land. To get them embarked on something as audacious as 
this, more than mere friendly advice was needed. 
The centre’s trainees had, in fact, to unearth in the village 
qualities of organization and initiative whose existence the 
villagers themselves had never suspected. The trainees did 
not form the co-operative; they merely helped it into being. 
They certainly argued, and most persuasively, the virtues of 
pooled work and explained the operation of combines on a 
share basis, but they never postulated the need of a tractor. 
The village actually possessed potential leaders whose 
abilities were not being used; and it is these who now form 
the board of the co-operative, with its chairman, treasurer, 
secretary and so forth—men of all ages, meeting ceremo- 
niously to discuss the crops to be sown, the maintenance 
of tractor and tools and the liquidation of the debt incurred 
in their purchase. They are men who, for the first time in 
their lives, feel that they are managing their future, running 
their own affairs and deliberating about them publicly, 
instead of merely suffering in silence and submitting to fate. 
It may seem strange that, in writing about fundamental 
education, we have not yet spoken of actual teaching. It is 
generally admitted nowadays that “it is not enough to learn 
how to read” and that, in a peasant community, inability to

write Is merely one problem among many. Astonishment, 
however, is sometimes felt that educational work does not 
begin in a classroom; evening classes are an old institution, 
and history now records many well-known “literacy 
campaigns.” - 
The trainees of Sirs-el-Layyan would reply that education 
can begin anywhere, as they prove in all sorts of ways—in a 
group gathered round a tractor, in connexion with a health 
campaign, or on an open-air stage. The main thing, they 
would always tell you, is that people should want to learn. 
Once that desire is expressed, no teaching, no form of edu- 
cation is really difficult. Evening courses are, generally 
speaking, an outcome rather than a starting-point. Once 
such courses have begun, at the request of the future pupils, 
education is already on the right road. 
At Qalatta, the reading-classes would not have attracted 
many pupils had the trainees appeared at the outset in the 
guise of school-teachers. Qalatta is a charming village; it 
has plenty of trees, and lies on the bank of an ancient canal, 
wide as a river—the “blind river”, as it is called, where white 
birds glide and little girls steer the boats. 
For all its beauty of setting, however, Qalatta is one of the 
most neglected villages of the region. Land here is even 
scarcer and more broken up than in the neighbouring areas, 
on the plan, the farms look like a sprinkling of tiny gardens. 
The people of Qalatta, moreover, are famed for their feuds 
which are forever dividing man from man and setting 
districts, streets and families at odds. Possibly this is 
already a thing of the past, but at all events the village, two 
years ago, had an atmosphere charged with suspicion and

seemed doomed to chronic anarchy, mingled with apathy and 
dejection. 
Yet it was at Qalatta, one evening in February 1954, that 
hundreds of peasants could be seen, queueing up in orderly 
fashion in front of the trainees’ house. Adolescents, respec- 
table citizens, grey-bearded grandfathers—all were illiterates 
waiting to enrol for the evening classes which were being 
organized at the village’s request. One by one, they sat 
down before the table where the “literacy expert”, Mr. Rushdi 
Khatir, examined them and entered them for the appropriate 
class. Some of them in fact knew nothing at all; others 
could sign their names; a third group could still display the 
elementary knowledge acquired, in the past, during a few 
months at school. 
The last-comers waited patiently in the moonlight at the 
roadside, in the garden, or on the terrace overlooking the 
water. It was past midnight by the time the enrolment was 
completed; and there was an air of mystery about the scene, 
as if the occasion had been a meeting of conspirators or a 
gathering of volunteers. The fellahin may indeed have felt 
that they were taking an adventurous—or, at any rate, 
important—step in submitting their names for this initiation 
into the mysterious world of books. 
In order to achieve this result, the students had worked 
with unfailing tact for over a year to put an end to the feuds 
which, hitherto, had defeated every good intention. No 
reforms could be effected in Qalatta before a spirit of 
comradeship and mutual trust had been re-created among 
the people and the value of co-operation demonstrated to 
them. The first step was to set up a club—to be operated, 
almost at once, by the villagers themselves. 
During Ramadan the new club increased the number of its 
social evenings, calling for this purpose on all the talent of 
the village. Next a dispensary was organized, with two 
“attendants” trained by the students. The club was thrown 
open to the young people, who formed a special “cultural 
activities” section; and the officers, with the trainees’ help, 
are now organizing a small public library. 
The club, in effect, acts as a municipal council; on 
complaints from the village, last year, that there was a 
shortage of water for irrigation, it sent a delegation, 
accompanied by two trainees, to the Water Department. And 
when the engineer explained that the shortage was due to 
neglect of the canals In the Qalatta area, it was once again 
the club, at its regular meetings and at the mosque on 
Fridays, which campaigned for a general labour service, The 
canals were duly cleaned and, the following season, the water 
supply was so plentiful that irrigation was ensured with 
unexpected ease. Co-operation had proved its worth. 
Today the people of Qalatta, like those of Deberki and other 
villages, are learning to read and write. Twice or three times 
a week they go to the club or the village school and pore 
patiently over their spelling primers or plough through their 
first books; the methods and books they use are prepared for 
them by the experts at Sirs-el-Layyan, and are thoroughly 
up to date. That they make this effort at the close of a long 
day’s work shows that they want to make it and know what 
they want. For them, elementary education is not an end in 
itself; in the old days, they still regarded it as an unnecessary 
luxury, or perhaps as a means of becoming a police constable. 
Now they see that it can bring them definite advantages. 
One man wants to read so that he shall know the Koran 
better; another, so that he can examine his bills and tax 
forms. The majority want to have access to the practical 
knowledge provided by the pamphlets and books already 
displayed in their meeting-rooms—manuals on agriculture, 
co-operative farming or odd-jobbing, and illustrated 
pamphlets on hygiene, cattle diseases or cotton pests. This 
mine of valuable information is there, within reach; and 
each peasant feels that he will be able to take full advantage 
of it just as soon as he has completed the course he is 
conscientiously following. 
“Everything hangs together”, said one of the trainees. 
“When we set out to raise the standard of living a little, each 
step leads to another... but then the result depends on a 
third factor, which was not reckoned with.” What goes by 
the name of poverty, in the villages, is not a superficial

AT res NI NR a A AA ete He a 
  
A TIMELESS FEATURE of the Middle East scene is a shepherd and his flock on their way to 
new pastures, In addition to rearing sheep for their meat and wool, farmers in the district of 
Menufia—site of the Sirs-el-Layyan Centre—use ewe’s milk to make a cheese which is reputed 
‘ : throughout Egypt. Local producers have now received certificates of quality from the Centre, 
condition arising from a single simple cause which can be 
dealt with at one stroke. It is due to a whole tangle of 
causes, almost impossible to root out one by one. 
Hundreds of children fall victims to an epidemic. Why? 
Because the mothers have no notion of hygiene? Probably— 
because there were no schools for them, and there are still 
all too few for their daughters. But there are other reasons 
too: polluted water (and who is going to pay for a public 
water-system?) and, above all, insanitary housing. Homes 
are insanitary because the fellahin have only the vaguest 
notions of what a proper, healthy house is. We must teach 
them, if we can. But whether they are taught or not, the 
fact remains that the fellahin lack the wherewithal to build 
better houses. 
This argument seems decisive; in fact it is not entirely 
valid. In these villages and towns, every street, every square 
looks the same as it has looked for centuries past-—yet no 
house is more than 20 years old. Everything built falls to 
pieces after 20 years, and the fellahin rebuild it at great 
expense. What happens is that the foundations rot away; 
if the brick foundations could be reinforced, every fellah 
would have at least one less house to build in his lifetime, and 
could thus enlarge and improve his home without spending 
more than he does at present. An expert from Yugoslavia is 
investigating this question at Sirs-el-Layyan, and has reason- 
able hopes of being able to introduce a cheap type of concrete 
which would revolutionize peasant housing. 
The same expert is co-operating with the trainees to 
produce a new stove—a simple clay model designed to be 
much more effective and economical than the traditional 
type. This may seem a trivial matter; but if their stoves 
consumed less fuel, the latter could be supplied exclusively 
from wood, branches and twigs, and straw, The cattle-dung 
could then be used as manure. The invention of a good 
stove may, one day, spare them this vast expenditure of 
time and labour. 
10 
One fellah admitted as much, when he smilingly said: 
“It’s better to save your strength when you haven’t enough 
to eat.” It is shameful that such skilled and hardworking 
farmers should have to feed themselves and their families so 
badly. Apart from raw vegetables, the fellahin eat practically 
nothing but bread, beans and a little cheese. If they raise 
poultry, they do so for sale, and they themselves only eat 
eggs on special occasions: “They cost too much,” a fellah 
will tell you. 
It is, in fact, these slender profits that enable them occa- 
sionally to buy a few clothes or tools, or even to save a little 
money to buy another water-buffalo or donkey to replace a 
beast that has died. What then remains from all their work? 
People will quote an old proverb: “The fellah is like a needle, 
which dresses other people but itself remains naked.” 
But once the peasants can succeed in organizing a sound 
co-operative, escaping from the money-lender’s clutches, 
selling their corn or cotton crop at a proper price, obtaining 
good seed at the right time, and combining for the purpose 
of major irrigation, ploughing and harvesting work, they are 
freed from a host of daily cares. 
The conclusions of the women trainees are the same as 
those of their colleagues who are concerned with farming or 
rural planning. “Import progress ready-made from outside? 
Useless, ridiculous. Even the finest examples of progress 
would leave the community indifferent--people would not 
even look at them. You might as well give a refrigerator to 
a fellah who has nothing to put in it and has never set eyes 
on an electric lamp. No; true progress takes place in the 
mind, it comes from within.” 
Unesco has recently published a booklet entitled “Sirs-el-Layyan” which

Or three hundred years the port 
of Brouage on the Atlantic coast 
had been one of France’s greatest 
harbours—rich in peacetime, powerful 
in wartime, and known throughout the 
world. All that ended several centuries 
ago. Brouage became a ghost village— 
almost deserted, almost derelict. 
Two years ago, however, sixty 
students from ten countries came to 
Brouage to try to restore it to life. 
The students all belonged to the inter- 
national voluntary work camp move- 
ment. Brouage was their latest assign- 
ment in the “pick and shovel” interna- 
tional co-operation for which the mo- 
vement is famous. 
One of France's greatest scholars at 
the time of the Renaissance, Nicolas 
Alain, described the Brouage of his day 
in these terms. “Right in the centre 
of this plain,” he wrote, “you see a 
great arm of the sea reaching into the 
land, forming a port which is famous 
throughout Europe.” Alain pointed out 
that access to Brouage was as easy as it 
was safe. And he added: “Vessels come 
here from Germany, Flanders, England 
and other countries to load salt which 
is produced here in enormous quanti- 
ties.” 
That was the Brouage that existed 
until about three centuries ago—a 
major Atlantic port and a famous city

that occupied an important place in 
French history. It was, for instance, 
the birthplace of Samuel Champlain, 
the founder of Quebec in French 
Canada. Most important of all, Brouage 
played a key role in the struggle waged 
by «Cardinal Richelieu during the 
Seventeenth Century Wars of Religion. 
To counterbalance a hostile La Ro- 
chelle to the north, Richelieu ringed 
Brouage with a mile of ramparts that 
stood thirty feet high, crowned hy 
tall watch-towers. At one time four 
thousand men were garrisoned inside 
its walls, and ships-of-the-line rode at 
anchor in the harbour. 
But then history turned against 
Brouage. Richelieu’s enemies sank 
ships in the harbour mouth. Gradually 
the sand accumulated and the great 
natural inlet sil-

activities on French soil. Before long, 
Brouage was assigned: to the inter- 
national volunteers as a new project 
that needed their help—actually as 
one of the more than nine hundred 
projects taken on by the work camp 
movement in 1953 throughout the 
world. 
In July 1953 tents went up outside 
Brouage —for the first time in three 
centuries. The tents housed a peaceful 
army of sixty students. Some came 
from France and nearby countries. 
Others came from as far away as India, 
Togoland, and Viet Nam. Together the 
students got down to work. They 
stormed the ancient ramparts with 
ladders and mountain-climbing gear 
and began to restore them. They 
attacked the encroaching sand dunes 
with shovels, and they hacked away at 
the unsightly urderbrush. Once all 
this preliminary work had been com- 
pleted, the French Historical Monu- 
ments Office was able to go ahead with 
the delicate job of restoring the watch- 
towers and the other ruins. 
Brouage’s inhabitants quickly adopted 
the campers. The fishermen took the 
foreign visitors out to the famed oyster 
beds and showed them how a French 
fishing village works and lives. For 
both campers and fishermen, the whole 
scheme was a great success—a fine 
experiment in international co-opera- 
tion. And the officials of Concordia, 
the sponsoring organization, were so 
pleased that they organized a new work 
camp in 1954 to continue the job of 
restoring the almost-forgotten town—a 
task which will be carried forward 
again this year by a new group of 
students. 
The work camp at Brouage is only 
one of hundreds of projects organized 
in all parts of the world by the inter- 
national work camp movement. Re- 
cently, reports on such projects were 
made at the Eighth Conference of 
Organizers of International Voluntary 
Work Camps, sponsored by Unesco, and 
held at Marly-le-Roi, near Paris. 
They showed that 69,283 young people 
took part in 1859 work camps organized 
during 1954. Almost half of them 
(31,780) worked in village development 
schemes in India: digging wells, build- 
Ing roads, improving sanitation and 
irrigation. 
Seventy-seven camps were organized 
to assist in the construction of youth 
centres playgrounds or sports fields and 
2,527 volunteers in 36 camps assisted 
in reconstruction work after the earth- 
quakes in Greece and Algeria, the 
avalanches in Austria and the floods in" 
India.

### 68960: Munich: international weather vane for children's books

HEN you walk through the ruins of Kaulbachstrasse, 
Munich, a stone’s throw from the university, you will see, as 
everywhere in Germany's bombed cities, a sight most touch- 
ing to those unaccustomed to ruins: A slender birch-tree 
or a sappy lilac bush perched high upon a crumbling wall or 
a heap of rubble. It seems a miracle that they should take 
root and a mystery how they are nourished. But there they 
are, and they thrive. 
Nearly six years ago, when the International Youth Library 
was set up in a little villa in one of the backyards of this 
street, it was no less adventurous than those lonely trees or 
bushes. Of all countries, Germany seemed to be the most 
barren soil for such a project. But a journalist from London 
and a true friend of youth, Mrs. Jella Lepman, did not think 
50, and time justified her optimism. . 
“Children whose world has been destroyed, are just as 
hungry for food of the mind as for bread,” she said in a 
speech at the International Congress on Books for Young 
People, held in Zurich two years ago. 
The International Youth Library grew a little haphazardly 
at first, but for that very reason it had and has retained a 
charm so often absent from many state-run institutions for 
youth. The 200 to 300 children who walk in every afternoon 
seem to look on the library as their home. There are no 
entrance cards or fees. They move about freely among the 
shelves stocked with 24,000 children’s books from 39 countries. 
Most of them are gifts from publishers all over the world, 
from America or Turkey, Indonesia, India or Deninark.

For the past six years a unique project, the Inter- 
~ national Youth library, (Internationale Jugend-Biblio-

ternational understanding among children and young 
people through their books. Founded as a model 
library for children and as an international centre for 
0 hing all persons interested in youth literature, it has now 
collected some 24,000 books from 39 countries. In

When Mrs. Lepman asked publishers to send her free copies 
of their new publications the response was generous though 
not all the material that came in was really valuable, and 
some was even worthless. Little by little, however, 
Mrs. Lepman’s small staff—one administrator, four librarians 
and one assistant—have sorted the books, putting aside the 
inferior ones, and arranging the rest on shelves according to 
the countries they come from. Every year the best are 
displayed around Christmas time, in an exhibition which is 
visited by authors, publishers, parents, and people interested 
in juvenile literature from many places. 
But the final judges are the youngsters themselves. When- 
ever they return a book, they are asked to put down their 
opinion about it. And then there are the “Book Reviewers’ 
Groups” for youngsters between 9 and 17, who, under the 
guidance of a psychologist or a librarian, read books—fre- 
quently those by foreign authors—and discuss and review 
them. And they love it. 
Mrs. Lepman’s main object, of course, was to acquaint the 
children with literature from abroad. Did she attain her 
goal? It must be admitted that the language barrier still 
is a serious difficulty. The smaller children certainly take 
the attractive French, English, Italian or “still more foreign” 
(Chinese, Indonesian) picture books from their shelves and 
gaze at the illustrations. But they don’t understand the text. 
One of the library’s future tasks, with an enlarged staff, 
might be to make tests with at least some of these books by 
adding typed or mimeographed translations. Otherwise the 
diversity of languages remains forbidding. 
However, there is a great variety of translated books. (Up 
to 25% of Germany’s yearly juvenile book Cont'd 
production are translations). “How do the (Cont'd on 
youngsters react to them? page 14)

Children have thrown themselves heart and soul into varied 
activities that flourish in the friendly atmosphere of the Munich

in fine weather easels are moved into the garden. Exhibitions 
of these children's work have gone round the world and some of

child’s concrete and imaginative mode of thought Is rarely

had for lunch.” (Photos copyright Hans Schurer and ikki Lideke,

(Continued) 
It is quite apparent that, as a whole, German youth is more 
serious-minded than non-German children who visit the 
library. “Truthful” is the highest attribute German children 
can give to a book. This applies not only to the older ones, 
but even the 8 to 9-year-olds. In the written reviews 
“too sentimental” is a much repeated comment, or “..a 
valuable book, because of its high moral interest”. 
For instance, the majority deem “Alice in Wonderland” or 
P.L. Travers’ “Mary Poppins”, the flying nursemaid who 
drops from the sky, “too confusing and fantastic”. Adven- 
ture books are in high demand, if they describe something 
“one might do oneself”. For the same reason most “Uto- 
pian” ones are condemned with a smile as: “Teo improbable”. 
Of the foreign authors clear favourites—besides the old 
classics like Swift or Defoe—are: Hemingway (“The Old Man 
and the Sea”), Kipling, Pearl Buck, Lawson, Thurber, CS. 
Forester, Catherine Pinkerton, St. Exupéry, Guareschi, Heyer- 
dahl, Selma Lagerlof, Hamsun, Monroe Leaf (“Ferdinand, the 
Bull”) and, naturally, Felix Salten (“Bambi”). 
Findings of this sort are being collected and tabulated more 
and more and put at the disposal of 
interested writers, illustrators, publish- 
ers. Mrs. Lepman’s institute tries to 
become a sort of clearing house for 
youth literature by collecting informa- 
tion from all over the world. She 
began by sending out questionnaires 
  on youth book production, children’s 
libraries etc., to 24 countries, 21 of 
which have replied so far. And she 
hopes to extend this inquiry to all 
member states of Unesco. 
Due to her stimulation, an Interna- 
tional Board on Books for Young 
People was founded, uniting for the 
first time, publishers, librarians, writers 
and educators. It held its first inter- 
national meeting last year in Zurich 
Unaware of this growing clearing 
house and research work, for which 
they are the happy “guinea pigs”, the 
children enthusiastically embark upon 
the many more delightful activities 
that have sprung up like wild saplings 
in the friendly atmosphere of the house. 
The attic is the domain of Mr. Steidle, 
a gifted young painter and art educator, 
and his youthful artists. Exhibitions 
of their work have gone around the 
world, and some of their self-portraits pe 
were included in Unesco’s publication, ee 
“Art and Education”. 
There are the language classes— 
English and French, so far—taught 
from picture books; there are lectures by authors of youth 
books, who often have a hard time coping with the mer- 
ciless criticism of their young audience, 
And once a month the easels are moved out of the attic 
and the “United Nations” moves in. Sixty-eight children, 
aged from 12 to 17, find it fun to sacrifice their free Saturday 
afternoons to listen to 10-minute speeches, in which the 
youthful delegates give what an adult would often think a 
highly technical description of *“their” country. The 
favourite countries, mostly far-off ones, are represented by 
two or three delegates. 
The youngsters take their assembly very seriously and ask 
questions that might well embarrass a teacher. Yet most 
delegates can provide the answers, as they are excellently 
informed. Before they make their speech, they ransack 
library shelves for material. And without being aware of it, 
they become acquainted with many countries they never 
thought of before and, at the same time, with the forms of 
international parliamentary life. Adults, by the way, are 
not admitted to the sessions. “We want to keep this strictly 
a youth affair,” says Dieter Dederichs, the president, aged 16. 
The whole library is strictly a youth affair, Its refreshing, 
youthful atmosphere in itself is international. For, as 
Mrs. Lepman says, “The child still possesses the whole globe. 
Only the grown-ups are fenced in, or think they are.”

### 68961: The Case of the four-handled jars: how code-breaking techniques unravelled a lost Greek tongue

How code-breaking techniques unravelled a lost Greek tongue 
THE CASE OF 
THE FOUR- 
HANDLED JARS 
by 
Darsie 
recent discovery has made Greek 
the only rival to Chinese as the 
language with the longest written 
record. Both languages can now be 
traced back from their present modern 
spoken forms, through successive chan- 
ges, to somewhere around 1400 B.C, 
that is to say for three thousand three 
hundred and fifty years. 
The history of writing goes back for 
another fifteen hundred years in Egypt 
and Mesopotamia, and probably in 
India. But these earlier languages 
have all long ago died out. No one 
today speaks a language derived from 
Egyptian. There are very ancient 
Sumerian or Babylonian or ancient 
compositions in Sanskrit, but these 
were preserved for many centuries not 
by writing but by a very accurate sys- 
tem of memorising. At all events, 
Sanskrit became a purely literary lan- 
guage more than two thousand years 
ago. 
There are big differences between 
the oldest Chinese and the oldest 
Greek documents. Chinese writing, 
like Chinese speech, has had one con- 
tinuous history. The modern charac- 
ters are derived from the earliest, even 
though there has been so much change 
that only a few scholars can read the 
latter. The earliest Greek documents 
on the other hand are in a seript that 
has nothing to do with the alphabet 
that the Greeks adapted from the 
Phceenicians about 750 B.C. and con- 
tinue to use to this day. This “less 
ancient” Greek alphabet was the pa- 
rent of the Cyrillic alphabet, used in 
some modern Slav languages, and of 
Gillie 
the Latin alphabet used throughout 
western Europe, both the Americas, 
much of Africa and part of Asia. 
The documents on which the earlier 
script had come to light are clay 
tablets, found from 1886 onwards in 
Crete, and after 1939 at Pylos on the 
Greek mainland, Until their secret 
was finally broken by an Englishman, 
Michael Ventris, nobody knew in what 
language they were written, or whether 
the language was one to which we had 
a key. 
There are other differences between 
the early Chinese and early Greek 
documents. The early Chinese writ- 
ing is picture-writing and gives no clue 
to pronunciation. The earliest Greek 
is phonetic and expresses the sound of 
the word though very inexactly. The 
 
 
earliest Chinese documents are gues- 
tions inscribed on bone, so that the 
gods may give an answer by cracking 
the bone in one way or another when 
it is placed in the fire. The earliest 
Greek documents seem to be household 
accounts—though the household is 
generally a palace—and the resources 
drawn on are those of a small kingdom. 
When we hear of an ancient system 
of writing being deciphered, most of us 
think of the Rosetta stone with its 
texts in Greek that was known and in 
Egyptian that was not yet known. But 
that is not the only way a script can 
be deciphered. Just as any military 
cipher can be broken in time, provided 
the language is known, so any ancient 
writing can with patience be made to 
yield its secret provided the language 
is closely enough related to another 
known language. If the language is 
unknown, then there is no hope unless 
a document comes to light which gives 
the text in both the unknown and a 
known language as did the Rosetta 
stone. 
The excavations of Sir Arthur Evans 
at Knossos in Crete toward the end of 
the last century revealed a palace seve- 
ral times rebuilt and on the last occa- 
sion destroyed about 1400 B. C. In the 
ruins were found tablets in three 
scripts—a hieroglyphic or picture writ- 
ing, a more sophisticated writing called 
Minoan Linear A and, in much greater 
quantities and connected with the last 
palace, a third system called Minoan 
Linear B. This was derived from the 
second, as the second was from the 
first. It was long supposed that all

the language of the people who created 
the so-called Minoan civilization of: 
Crete; that the palace had been des-

mainland who called themselves 
Achaeans. 
It is certain that the Achaeans first 
learned from and then conquered the 
Minoans, but it now appears that they 
did it rather earlier than was first sup- 
posed. Already before the Minoan 
Linear B script was deciphered some 
archaeologists had pointed out resem-

came the discovery of Professor Blegen 
at Pylos in South Greece in 1939 of 
600 “Minoan” tablets in an undoubtedly

tablets were in some early form of 
Greek and might be read | 
The tablets of Knossos had been 
carefully scanned for years by scholars 
with little result. It was apparent that 
most of them were lists. Numerals 
could be distinguished. They seemed 
to be rather hurriedly written—like the 
day-to-day accounts of an office, There 
were about 80 different symbols, 
apart from little picture signs which 
seemed to indicate the kind of objects 
in a list—jars, men, chariots. 
Eighty signs were too many for an 
alphabet, that is a system of writing in 
which each sound has a sign of its own, 
but too few for one of the early compli- 
cated systems in which many whole 
words have a picture sign to them- 
selves. It must therefore be a sylla- 
bary, that is a system of writing in 
which each sign represents a syllable. 
But with only 80 signs, it must have 
been devised for a language in which 
most syllables consisted of one conso- 
nant and one vowel, rather like Japa- 
nese, in which there are rarely two

GREEK MYTHOLOGY SLAIN BY THESEUS. (Photos Violler) 
hundred years older than any that had 
hitherto been read, the proposed solu- 
tion did seem to work. Might this be 
chance ? Then in 1952 a tablet was 
discovered at Pylos, which contained a 
list of jars in the royal store rooms. 
There were little pictures of jars 
without handles, with two handles, 
with three and with four. The words 
beside them read, as deciphered by 
Mr. Ventris, “with no ears”, “with two 
ears”, “with three ears” and “with four 
ears”. There could be no more doubt— 
the right solution had been found. 
Greek had changed a great deal bet- 
ween the time of the tablets of Knossos 
(C. 1400 B.C.) and of Pylos (1200 B.C.) 
and even the time of Homer (perhaps 
750 B.C.), although the exacting rhy- 
thm in which the poems attributed to 
him are composed had preserved many 
old words. Secondly the Minoan B. 
script must originally have been devis- 
ed for quite a different language. It 
does not distinguish between P and B, 
K and G, R and L. It cannot express 
exactly any syllable which ends with a 
consonant. Thus the words “pater” 
meaning “father” and “pantes” mean- 
ing “all” are written by the same two 
signs indicating “pa-te”. You have to 
know the subject matter to avoid 
errors. That is why the little picture 
signs had to be used. 
Strangely enough, all that has sur- 
vived are bills, invoices, lists of persons 
owing money or services, lists of cattle 
and the like. The tablets were probab- 
ly of unbaked clay only kept until 
final entries could be made on more 
expensive material, vellum or papyrus. 
The palaces where they were kept were 
destroyed by fire. The “permanent” 
records perished in the same flames 
which baked and so made permanent 
* 
the rough notes of the bailiffs, tax col- 
lectors and merchants. 
Have we lost in those flames the 
works of earlier Homers ? That does 
not seem probable. So ill-fitting a 
script would be a very awkward instru- 
ment for writing down a poem or even 
a prose-history., It was apparently 
used chiefly by tax collectors and 
accountants. When the Dorian Greeks 
who had hitherto lived too far north 
to feel the influence of Cretan civiliza- 
tion swept south and destroyed the 
kingdoms of the Achaeans, the Minoan 
Linear B script seems to have dis- 
appeared along with the Achaean tax 
gatherers. ’ 
The records that have come down to 
us are very limited in scope, but they 
will provide a great deal of information 
about the Greeks, whose warrior kings 
besieged Troy. They show that the 
names of Homer’s heroes were common 
in the days of which he sang. They 
show that the gods of classical Greece 
were already worshipped in the second 
millennium B.C. They give a voice to 
centuries of which we had found the 
handiwork, but of which no words 
remained to us. 
Further, the deciphering of Minoan 
B, may yet lead to an understanding of 
the much rarer tablets in Minoan A; 
also to those in a kindred script of 
about the same date now coming to 
light in Cyprus. These still undeci- 
phered Cypriot tablets do not look like 
lists, but appear to contain texts of 
some length. One is perhaps a letter. 
But in what language ? That is ano- 
ther mystery—and another story.

an can live without clothes, without shelter and for some 
time without food. Without water, he soon perishes. 
The earliest settlements grew up around rivers, 
  
  f + springs, wells and other primitive sources of water. 
Later, great civilizations and cultures were nurtured in the valleys of 
famous rivers—the Nile, the Euphrates, the Indus and the Ganges. 
And as they grew always more and more water was needed. In 
fact, it has been said that throughout history, “after the passion of 
love, water rights have caused more trouble than anything else to 
the human species.” 
As time went on, the search for water for survival was gradually 
paralleled by an equally persistent quest for “pure” water. For thou- 
sands of years people increasingly demanded a more satisfactory 
sort of water for drinking and other purposes. 
“It is good to keep water in copper vessels, to expose it to sunlight, 
and filter through charcoal” is a dictum not out of an engineer's 
report in modern times. It goes back about 2,000 years and was 
found in a collection of medical lore written in Sanscrit. 
Another Sanscrit source ofthe same period gives more comprehen- 
sive and remarkably modern water purification suggestions: “Impure 
water should be purified by being boiled over a fire, or being heated 
in the sun, or by dipping a heated iron into it, or by filtration 
through sand and coarse aravel and then allowed to cool.” 
Unfortunately sensible advice like this has often been ignored in 
the past. As great civilizations flourished their growing populations 
very often themselves poisoned the waters on which their lives 
depended. Even a century ago cholera, typhoid, the dysenteries 
and other diseases caused by polluted water still ravaged the peoples 
of all the continents. 
Since then, spectacular results have been achieved in protecting 
people against the menace of the many water-borne diseases. But 
no country in the world can afford to relax its vigilance concerning 
water sources and supplies. Serious and widespread cholera and 
typhoid epidemics were still occurring in Europe and America at the 
end of the nineteenth century. As late as 1937, a momentary break- 
down in the water-purification system of Croydon, near London, let 
loose a terrible epidemic of typhoid fever. In Marseilles in 1943 
there were 639 cases of typhoid with 127 deaths. 
In the immediate post-war years 250,000 cases of typhoid with 
25,000 deaths were occurring annually in Europe. In Mexico it was 
estimated that in 1948, 22 per cent of all deaths were caused by water- 
borne diseases. Experts believe that in many Asian countries the 
sickness rate could be halved by protecting water supplies and provid- 
ing proper facilities for the disposal of wastes. 
So long as sanitation remains at a primitive level and water sup- 
plies continue to be dangerously polluted, there is little hope of - 
reducing the heavy loss of life that is brought about by water-borne 
disease. Moreover, the continuing drain on the finances of the 
underdeveloped countries resulting from the consumption of disease- 
ridden water constitutes a major obstacle in the path of their progress 
towards economic and social betterment. The provision of supplies 
of pure water adequate for their needs is a basic requirement of all 
countries and one that demands the highest priority in planning for 
the future welfare of their peoples. 
A vast problem such as this calls for world action and a wider 
understanding of the basic relationship between water resources, 
health and civilization. This was why the World Health Organization 
chose “Clean Watér Means Better Health” as the theme for this year's 
World Health Day on April 7. As such it served to emphasize WHO's 
concern for wider sanitation programmes and underlined a problem 
facing authorities in countries at all stages of health development. 
But there are some people who view the prospect of millions more 
people enjoying better health with some misgiving. Lower death 
rates, they point out, mean more and more mouths to feed in a world 
which already seems unable to adequately feed its present popula- 
tion. In the following article, Jean Manevy, of the World Health 
Organization, outlines the basic facts of this problem of food, 
people and health, and suggests how it may be solved in the future.

HERE do we go from here? In practically every country 
throughout the world life expectancy is rising and the 
death rate is dropping. The pessimists, though, are 
  7— wringing their hands in anguish over this and are fore- 
casting the blackest future for humanity. 
“All this is very fine,” they say, “but what are we going to do 
with all these extra people? With all this better health there 
will be fewer epidemics and people will live longer. How is our 
planet going to support them when there are millions now who 
haven’t got enough to eat?” 
Some pessimists have even gone so far as to label DDT the 
“demographic curse” because it saves lives by destroying malaria- 
carrying mosquitos. 
The cry of danger has been heard many times before. Even 
before the industrial revolution swept across Europe, economists 
saw that an improvement in world health would bring about a 
sharp increase in population and the pessimists predicted that the 
world would soon starve to death. 
On the other hand it is just as easy to be over-optimistic and 
look at the problem through rose-coloured glasses. What are the 
facts? And is man capable of really meeting one of the greatest 
challenges he has ever faced? 
Two hundred years ago, in 1750, the world’s population stood at 
700 million. By 1850 it had gone up to 1,000 million, and by 1950 
reached the figure of 2,500 million people. Thus, in the last 
century our planet’s population has doubled. Present calculations 
show that the world’s population is increasing at the phenomenal 
rate of 85,000 to 100,000 persons per day . 
By 1980, if the present rate continues, there will be an additional 
1,000,000,000 people in the world making a total of 3,500,000,000. 
This means another increase of 51 per cent. Continent-wise the 
increase would look something like this: Africa, 45 per cent; the 
Americas, 61 per cent (32 per cent in North America and 96 per 
cent in certain tropical regions of South America); (Cont'd on 
Asia, 52 per cent; Europe 31 per cent; Oceania, next page) 
30 per cent. . §

### IGNORE

Pessimists and Optimists in Hot Debate 
What do all these figures show? That our population is 
growing fastest in two-thirds of the world which is also the 
poorest and the least developed economically. 
In the more highly developed countries the rate of increase 
is much lower. At the beginning of the present century these 
countries saw the start of a concerted programme for improv- 
ing health conditions. 
Hygienic measures, the reduction of working hours, slum 
clearance and the building of better houses, the spread of 
education—all helped, first to reduce the general death rate 
and then to win impressive victories over the death rate for 
infants and young children. 
The average expectancy of life was 22 years among the 
Egyptians in the first century before the Christian era. In 
17th century Europe it was from 30 to 40 years. The great 
medical discoveries of recent times have further contributed 
to reducing the death rate and extending the life span. It is 
now as much as 77 years among white women in North Ame- 
rica. 
In the most under-developed countries, however, precarious 
living conditions, lack of proper food, low wages and illiteracy 
are linked with a high death rate (one in two among young 
children), the prevalence of deadly epidemics, and also with 
a high birth rate. 
Nevertheless, there has been progress—though small— 
during recent decades. Industrialization is under way, vast 
campaigns have been undertaken against tuberculosis and 
malaria, international action has been taken to check epide- 
mics of plague, typhus and yellow fever, and new kinds of 
treatment have been more widely used. All 
this has saved a larger number of lives 
every year. A lower death rate and a longer 
life span combined with a high birth rate 
have caused the total population to increase 
at a faster pace than that of the production 
of consumer goods. 
    Optimists and pessimists are engaged in 
a hot debate about the “daily quantity of 
calories needed for the subsistence of the 
individual.” Among optimists, estimates as 
to what the globe can maintain in the way 
of population range from 5,000 million to 
16,000 million human beings. The pessi~ 
mists, basing themselves on the one hand on 
the present Asian standards of consumption 
and on the other, on North American stan- 
dards, reach the conclusion that the earth’s 
maximum population should not exceed, in 
the first case, 2,800 million and, in the second case, only 
900 million. 
In addition, experts in population problems disagree as to 
what the future size of the world’s population is likely to be. 
Some think it risky to presume that the earth will be submer- 
ged by its population at the beginning of the 21st century. 
They judge that the curve of the birth rate must surely follow 
the descending curve of the death rate, and that the increase 
of population will lessen. At the same time production, 
manned by young and healthy workers and freed from the 
costly waste of ill-health, will tend to increase. 
Population specialists do agree, however, that there are 
three stages in population evolution. 
First, there is the period of extremely high rates, both of 
births and of deaths. Populations tend to increase because 
of the high birth rate, but the increase is limited by the high 
death rate. 
Then, there is the period during which both rates become 
subject to controls. First, the death rate tends to become 
lower in the direction of the ideal minimum which the pre- 
sent state of medical knowledge can hope to establish. But 
the birth rate remains high and is slow to follow the dimi- 
nishing curve of death rate. The result is a spectacular rise 
in population. 
Finally, there is the period during which both rates are 
maintained at a low level, with the result that the popula- 
tion remains stationary or tends slightly toward a decrease. 
The countries which have reached these different stages 
have been classed as under-developed, semi-developed and 
developed. The fact is that the natural evolution of popu- 
lation corresponds with economic evolution: the effect of 
industrial development is to improve living conditions and 
to lengthen the average life span.

### 68964: Is good health a world threat?

‘Good health 
(Continued) 
The estimated annual death rate in the whole world varies 
from 22 to 25 per 1,000 persons. In the most highly econo- 
mically developed regions it falls as low as 6 per 1,000 while 
in the least developed regions it soars as high as 30 per 1,000. 
Death rates vary within countries according to social groups. 
They are highest among the poorest classes and lowest among 
the top income groups. 
Between the years, 1000 and 1855, no fewer than 450 famines 
occurred in Western Europe alone, causing sharp increases 
in the death rate. Along with famines, great epidemics of 
plague, cholera, smallpox and typhus have until the recent 
past wiped out large numbers of persons. Plague alone 
claimed 10,000,000 victims during the Byzantine period and 
25,000,000 (a quarter of Europe’s population) in the 14th cen- 
tury. Smallpox and typhoid were responsible for from 10 to 
20 per cent of all deaths in the 18th and 19th centuries 
(40 000 deaths in Prussia yearly at the start of the 19th cen- 
tury). Typhus, a dreaded result of wars and famines, was 
particularly deadly to children and adolescents. 
Living conditions in the towns were often worse than in the 
country. In Stockholm, in the middle of the 18th century, 
the average length of life was 14 years for men and 18 for 
women, while in the whole of Sweden the averages at the 
same period were 33 and 36. In the United States in the 
1850’s, half of the five-year old children in the countryside 
could hope to live to 65, those in the small towns to the age 
of 56, and those in the large towns to the age of 41. 
The struggle to bring down the death rate really began 
about 1850 when important social and economic changes 
were taking place. Between 1840 and 1940 
the average length of life in Europe rose 
steadily from 39 years to 63 years for men, 
and from 42 to 66 for women. Since then 
the upward movement has continued. 
This does not mean that the progress of 
science and medicine has succeeded in 
lengthening the span of human life. Taken 
as an individual, a man of the 20th century 
does not live any longer than one who, two 
centuries earlier, was lucky enough to 
escape illness until an advanced age. But, 
in the 20th century, an infinitely larger pro- 
portion of men and women reach old age. 
It is the reduction of the death rate among 
children, and especially among infants, that 
has had a decisive effect on the extension 
of the human life span. 
Better knowledge of hygiene and increases 
in incomes have both affected the infant death rate. For 
example, in the United States during the 1920’s the rate 
among the poorest classes 'was 170 per 1,000 births while among 
the richer classes it was only 50 per 1,000 births. 
For a long time, while over-population was linked with 
bad housing conditions, the rate was higher in the towns 
than in the country. Nowadays, however, this situation has 
reversed. Wars, accompanied by serious food restrictions, 
quickly cause rises in the infant mortality rate. The example 
of Leningrad is especially dramatic : before the war, the 
rate varied between 140 and 150 per 1,000 births ; during the 
siege of 1942, it shot up to 748 per 1,000. 
Recently the rate has decreased in a most spectacular 
manner in the highly developed countries. In some it has 
fallen to the record low figure of 20 per 1,000 births, 
whereas at the start of the 20th century more than 30 out 
of every 100 infants died in their first year. There is a 
startling similarity between the health situation today in 
the underdeveloped countries and those that prevailed 150 
or 200 years ago in the countries now considered developed. 
Infant mortality still reaches 500 per 1,000 births. The 
average length of life is little longer than 30 years. Epi- 
demics still sporadically take their terrible toll. Tropical 
countries have even more of their share of illnesses : 
sleeping sickness, yellow fever, yaws and many others. 
Experts agree, however, that the death rate caused by such 
illnesses can also be reduced by improved living conditions. 
Important and successful steps have already been taken 
to force down the death rate in large areas of the world : 
great vaccination campaigns, a struggle against malaria on 
the international scale, quarantine measures to control 
epidemics, and the vigorous co-operative Cont'd 
activities carried out by the governments of (Sond on 
the countries concerned. ‘page 22)

| Good health 
(Continued) 
  
Nevertheless, the infant death rate in these countries is still 
from 40 to 50 per cent of the general mortality. Thus, a 
decisive factor in the campaign depends ultimately on 
substantial improvements in economic conditions. 
The birth of a child is considered a happy event in every 
class of society in every country of the world. Within the 
family, it means that there will be someone to go on living 
in the home, that the soil will be tilled, that the care of 
parents in their old age will be assured. 
To the nation, it means that the people have a future, 
that the homeland will be defended, and that the economy 
will have the manpower it needs to expand. Everywhere on 
earth, children and young people symbolize vigour and 
prosperity. 
In the under-developed countries, the birth rate is infini- 
tely higher than that in other countries, but so is the death 
rate. Though one out of every two children dies before his 
first birthday, this does not check the natural growth of the 
population. But when the total population of these countries 
rises through high birth and death rates, it does so waste- 
fully because such a growth of population means a high 
proportion of dependent persons. 
It has been calculated that each new child represents an 
economic deficit until he is 15 years old. From then on, the 
work done by the adolescent each year pays back the cost 
of his maintenance during a previous year. At 30 years, 
the “capital” invested in the child is paid back by the young 
man After 30, the grown man represents economic credit 
22   
    
—“active capital”—capable not only of taking care of 
himself, but also of a dependent person. But in the under- 
developed countries, infant mortality alone accounts for 
from 40 to 50 per cent of the total death rate, and the 
average expectancy of life scarcely exceeds 30 years. 
The demographic situation in the largest part of the world 
today can be summed up as follows. The efforts of medical 
science have almost everywhere reduced the general death 
rate, but the infant death rate has not diminished in the 
same proportions. The lowered death rate and the mainte- 
nance of the birth rate at a high level has speeded up 
population growth, but the development of young, healthy, 
productive generations has not been accelerated. If the 
death rate can be lowered for all ages, there is a chance that 
the proportion of children surviving until the period of their 
productivity will increase. And this will also mean an 
increased return on the investment in their upbringing. 
The situation can be compared to that of a young married 
couple with limited resources who, expecting a baby, get 
quintuplets. If the couple does not get outside help and 
if it has no chance of increasing its income, the result will 
be disastrous ; the children will starve. But, if by some 
miracle, the quintuplets can reach an age at which they 
can earn money, the family will be saved, and may even 
become prosperous. 
Today overpopulation is no longer a problem for individual 
nations ; it is one of the most important international ques- 
tions. That is why the United Nations recently convened a 
congress of leading population experts from all over the

world in Rome. They included specialists of the World 
Health Organization, whose activities have greatly contribut- 
ed to reducing the death rate ; of the Food and Agricultural 
Organization, and Unesco. 
Three major theses were presented at the World Popula- 
tion Congress. 
First, that “in order to build a family in a rational 
manner” man should use various birth control methods. 
Second that mechanical or chemical methods of birth 
control would be contrary to the laws of nature, but that 
man, as a superior being, should be able to master his 
instincts and to decide for himself the size of his family, 
adapting himself to the economic conditions which he faces. 
_ Finally, there was the view that the growth of population 
is not a problem which can be solved by birth control, but 
by a better division of consumer goods and resources. 
Nevertheless, the supporters of the three different view- 
points seemed to agree on one thing — that the generation 
which discovered the secrets of the atom should be able to 
find a constructive answer to the oft asked question : will 
the vast number of human beings who are being saved today 
by the progress of medical science be condemned to die of 
hunger tomorrow? 
Every night, more than half the people on earth go to bed 
hungry. Some 1,400 million men and women in Asia have 
only enough food to keep them alive. The situation as nu- 
trition experts see it is that each of these people has less 
than the 2,400 calories which are considered the daily mini-

mum requirement to maintain life. Immense numbers of 
people in Africa, Latin America and Europe have only a 
trifle more than that minimum. The people of some 
countries of Europe, North America and Oceania have rations 
equal to—or more than —the 2,800 calories which the 
specialists consider every human being should have daily. 
Growth of the population will make the situation even 
worse unless better means are found to increase the produc- 
tion of consumer goods and to improve their distribution. 
At a time when some regions are threatened by famine, 
other parts of the world face the problem of disposing of 
surplus stocks of cereals, and of reducing planted acreage. 
The earth has far from reached its maximum capacity of 
production. Some people believe production can be increas- 
ed from 40 to 50 per cent. Others are convinced that if all 
the farmers of the world adopted the best methods now 
known, food production could be doubled without adding to 
the present acreage. 
In the United States, for example, the 1952-1953 crop was 
double the annual crops during the 1934-1938 period. The 
yield per acre increased by 70 per cent while the planted 
area increased by only 20 per cent. However, increases in 
the yield of land will not suffice to feed mankind if during 
coming years the birth rate continues to be high, if more 
lives are saved by science, and if the life span is lengthened 
even more. 
At present the sea furnishes only about one 
percent of mankind's food, although it covers 
some ‘three quarters of the surface of the

FRIEND AND FOE. Man has always settled near water, but fishermen such as these on the River Niger in the French Sudan live closest to it. It is their 
friend and their foe, it provides their livelihood and may also destroy them. Millions still fail to understand the link between polluted water and disease, 
globe. Improvement in fishing methods could bring vast ad- 
ditional quantities of food out of the sea. 
About one fifth of the earth’s surface is unproductive be- 
cause of its cold climate. But the earth’s temperature is 
now tending to rise ; the ice is receding toward the poles. 
Every year new soil, varying from a few dozen yards to 
several miles, is being reclaimed for planting, 
The arid zones can also be used if they can be supplied 
with water (by dams and irrigation canals) ; if the water 
can be kept from evaporating (by reservoirs or vegetation); 
if sub-surface water can be extracted and used ; if sea 
water can be de-salted (although such foods as cucumbers, 
carrots, corn, cabbage can be grown in soil irrigated by salt 
water). Some plants, such as the eucalyptus, grow perfectly 
in the desert and provide shade and fuel. The extension 
of desert areas can be checked by controlling the foraging 
of certain animals; goats, rabbits and various birds destroy 
the vegetation and permit the advance of the sands. 
In the absence of electric and other power, the bringing 
of water into arid zones presents serious problems. Yet, 
studies are under way to solve them, for instance, by the 
use of solar and wind energy. 
Considerable progress has been made to increase the yield 
of various crops. But new discoveries open far broader pers- 
pectives. For example, by adding a tiny dose of certain 
antibiotics to the food of cattle and fowl, their rate of 
growth is increased rapidly. Pigs fatten three times as 
quickly, hens lay a larger number of eggs. A pig raised with 
aureomycine reaches the weight of 43 kilos in a period of 
24 
  
° NE a . E R ) . Tr w 0 EEN, A 
time during which it would normally reach only 30 kilos. 
Hybridization or cross-breeding of plants also can increase 
the yield of acreage. In the United States, for example, new 
hybrids of corn have led to a 25 per cent increase in produec- 
tion, to an additional profit of $700,000,000, and to an annual 
increase of about 5,000 million pounds of meat, that is, about 
40 pounds of meat more for each person. 
In addition to increasing the area and the yield of planted 
ground, steps must be taken to protect the soil against the 
rains (which, every year, wash millions of tons of good earth 
toward the sea) ; against drought (which, in the absence of 
irrigation systems, can transform fertile earth into dust, as 
for example, the immense Tigris desert area which was once 
able to feed 30,000,000 human beings) ; against insects and 
parasites which every year destroy at least 10 per cent of the 
world’s food crop (an amount which could nourish the whole 
population of Africa or North America). 
Moreover, there are possibilities beyond those which have 
been stated briefly here by which man can feed everyone 
on earth : there are the new perspectives opened since the 
beginning of the atomic era. 
The people of the world will have the chance for stu- 
pendous improvements in their food and way of life when 
atomic energy is fully used for peaceful, industrial purposes. 
The possibilities in this field seem limitless. Dr. Powell, of 
Bristol University, Nobel Prize winner, declared recently : 
“Used for production, the power of five hydrogen bombs 
could furnish a quantity of energy equal to that now produc- 
ed by the work of all Britain’s nuners auring one year.”

Water NIVERSALITY OF WATER, — 
covers about five-sevenths of the 
earths surface to an average depth of 
three miles. The Polar regions cf the 
globe are covered with great ice caps 
—water in solid form. The atmosphere 
contains enormous quantities of water 
vapour—often as much as 50,000 tons in 
the air over a square mile of the earth's 
surface at summer temperature. All our 
focd contains water, from about 60 % In 
lean meat to as much as 95 % in watery 
‘ruits. About 70 % of the human body is 
water. Even the solid rocks of the earth's 
crust hold water in chemical combination 
with different mineral substances—so much 
of it, that most of the land areas of the 
earth would be submerged, if this water 
were suddenly returned to the ocean. 
Pl 
HE WISDOM OF THE ANCIENTS : The 
Palace of Minos, at Knossos, dat- 
ing from about 2,030 B.C., possessed a 
system, of drainage, Nineveh had its 
sewers more than 3,000 years ago and, 
about 583 B.C., the Cloaca Maxima of 
ancient Rome was built. Nevertheless, 
in the modern world in general, sani- 
tation may be considered as having 
originated within the last two hun- 
dred years and as having been de- 
veloped, uninfluenced by ancient 
knowledge, mostly during the last 
century. 
- IF Fmranp a great problem is connec- 
ted with the wood-pulp industry. 
An average-sized Finnish pulp-mill dis- 
charges waste comparable with that of a 
city of one million population, demanding 
expensive treatment in order to prevent 
stream pollution. 
N Denmark the National Public 
Health Service, in collaboration 
with the Danish dairy organizations, 
has undertaken an examination of 
water from 13,000 wells serving rural 
communities. Action has also been 
taken against the use of town sewage 
for watering farm-land, since domes- 
tic sewage has been found to contain 
eggs from the tapeworm. 
OME FACTS ABOUT WATER in the Uni- 
ted States : More and more air 
conditicning, for instance, is a factor in 
our trend to comfortable living. But the 
air conditicning system of a large building 
may use 3,000,000 gallons of water a day— 
as much as a city of 25,000 people. 
In industry today, water is the universal 
raw material. We use pure water in 
fabulous quantities : 
24 gallons to produce a pound of paper; 
up to 10 gallons to produce a can of vege- 
tables; 70 gallons to make a pound of 
woollen cloth; 10 gallons of water to pro- 
duce every gallon of petrol; 65,000 gallons 
to produce a ton of highly-finished steel; 
750 gallons of water to produce a ton of 
dry cement. 
But even as the need for more water 
grows, the watersheds which nature fa- 
shioned to give us an ample supply are 
being despciled. Cut-over, burned over 
land has bz2en exposed to the gouge of the 
rain, letting it cut off topsoil and run use- 
lessly away with a load of silt to clog dams 
and reservoirs. 
8
 
£ 
id & oi
 
Because of silt deposits, it is estimated 
one out of five of the nation’s reservoirs 
will be useless in less than 50 years. 
Water supply is a big industry in the 
United States of America. By weight of 
material handled, it is seven times as big 
as all other industries put together. 
But vast thoagh today’s waterworks ins- 
tallations may be, they are not sufficient 
for the years ahead. 
The US Public Health Service reports 
that almost 6,000 communities with no 
waterworks need and could support such 
facilities. To meet these needs, as well as 
to provide for the normal expansion of 
existing waterworks, will mean an estimat- 
ed 3,050 new treatment plants, 9,000 wells 
and well-pumps, 8,000 storage tanks, and 
more than 45,000 miles of water-pipe. 
I" France in 1950, two thirds of 
country-dwellers did not have piped 
water in their homes. Of 37,000 ru- 
ral communes only 10,500 had a pub- 
lic service of potable water, Out 
of 38,000 French communes, scarcely 
1,000 had any system of sewerage 
whatever, 300 had a reasonably good 
drainage system and only 80 possessed 
sewage treatment plants. 
I3 Europe only one in four homes 
have an indoor water supply and 
even in most advanced countries running 
water does not reach more than two thirds 
of houses in rural areas. In urban areas in 
most European countries indoor water sup- 
ply is found in 56 to 96 houses out of every 
hundred. 
| PR IceLanD. — Iceland has plenty 
of excellent drinking water (for its 
sparse population of one person to the 
square kilometre) from springs, rivers 
and brooks and it 1s so pure, clear 
and free from bacteria that no puri- 
fication is needed. 
More than half the population 
makes use of natural hot water, to- 
gether” with electricity from hvdro- 
electric plants, for heating, lighting 
and cooking. 
The many swimming pools and 
swimming halls use natural hot water 
almost entirely and it is quite free 
from bacteria. In most cases the 
quantity is so great that no recircula- 
tion is used and the hot water flows 
straight through. 
F pure drinking water can be

Public-Health Engineer on rural 
conditions in Africa scuth of the

EEPING salt out of the water is one 
of the big problems in the Ne- 
therlands, much of which lies below sea 
level. The fact that the Rhine contains 
salt before it even enters the country is 
causing some anxiety. In 50 years’ time, 
salt content of the great river has doubled, 
and apparently continues to rise steadily. 
H eave INDUSTRIALIZATION, very high 
density of population, a small 
coastline and the absence of great riv- 
ers make for a serious pollution prob- 
lem in Belgium. Some rivers, for 
example the Scheldf, are polluted be- 
fore they even enter the country. 
Other rivers, the Lys, the Sambre, the 
Meuse, are polluted for long stretches. 
Sewage pollution of the coast, which 
in the holiday sezson is packed with 
people, is also an urgent problem. Re- 
search, the building of sewage treat- 
ment plants and the enforcement of 
laws against polluticn are being ener- 
getically pursued by the authorities. 
I DENMARK public opinion is strong 
in condemning river polluticn. This 
is partly due to the popularity of angling. 
Increasing Interest is being taken in this 
sport and the angling clubs are very active 
in drawing attention to cases of pollution 
and agitating for its removal, 
I" SwebeN, there is a strong public 
cpinion that something must be 
done about the pollution of rivers. 
This is partly because of the recent 
salmonella epidemic, on account of 
which numerous bathing places were 
closed. Though in Sweden, as else- 
where, it seems easier to prevent new 
pollution than to d=al with that which 
has been long established, pollution of 
rivers has been increasing. Of recent 
years there has been progressive urba- 
nization of the country and sewage 
treatment has not kept pace with this 
development. Improvement, however, 
may be expected. 
ETTER LIVING THREATENS WATER. — 
The higher the standard of living, 
the greater the danger of pollution. Im- 
proved hygiene means the rapid removal 
of dirt and waste, which leads to pollution. 
Greater material wealth mu<t mean an 
increase in manufacture, which leads to 
pollution. Less drudgery means a greater 
use of machines, which particularly 
through the processing of food leads to 
pollution. The more we have advanced, 
he more waste we have produced, and to 
expect our lakes and rivers to cope with 
the mess as they were often able to do in 
the past, is today asking too much.

by Maurice Kurtz 
liam Beeby, New Zealand educator, “but it even 
makes us pay fifteen shillings a seat for it.” He ad- 
ded with a wry smile: “How do theatre folk get away with it?” 
Puppets have their answer: for centuries now they have 
been lecturing and moralizing, and been loved for it, thanks 
to their innocent frames being so cleverly dipped into devil- 
ries and foibles of every kind of person from every clime. 
The French dictum that “ridicule kills” might well serve as 
the marionette’s motto, since its stock in trade is just that: 
to sell an audience laughter, mostly at itself, yet so deftly 
performed that no one realizes the moral has been driven 
home and the lesson learnt willy-nilly. 
In fact, before we know it, there is no longer before us a 
mere show-case, puppets clowning “just” for the sake of 
entertainment. We now see a laboratory teeming with 
absurd little guinea-pigs who attract their audience by 
meaningful antics that puncture a host of human peccadilloes 
—including those of their masters and on-lookers who have 
not yet donned a sanctimonious armour against fun and its 
unpredictable consequences. For sooner or later the puppets 
reach out and seize that unique opportunity to turn the 
thousand eyes and ears of their audience back upon itself, 
to hear its own thought-provoking rumblings above the din 
of its own laughter. 
And so once again the dressed-up dolis can make their stiff 
clumsy bow, rake in the applause, and retain their somewhat 
pompous title of Master Satirists. 
How puppetry manages to perpetuate this feat through the 
ages is an open secret, for all theatre people to use—if they 
can! But can they all create the illusion that we are looking 
“T HEATRE not cnly gives us a lesson”, exclaimed Dr. Wil- through a strange keyhole, straight into another world full of 
fascinating creatures who have few qualms—and much 
talent!—in revealing the inhibited side of Man? 
True, Sophocles and Euripides, who had their own vision of 
Man as a marionette strung from Olympus, portrayed Life 
and Earth has a playground for the gods of destiny. 
True, Goethe turned to the puppet-like world of the theatre 
because it seeks to unveil the secret of life, which is Living 
itself. And in this way the author of Faust hoped to satisfy 
Man’s unquenchable thirst for self-realization, his need of 
pleasure, beauty, emotion, excitement. 
True, Somerset Maugham, like Aristotle, declares that “the 
value of art is not beauty, but right action” which Luis de 
Leon, a sixteenth-century Spanish poet defined as acting in 
conformity with one’s nature and business. 
True, Jean-Paul Sartre and his French existentialist 
cohorts are concerned less with the action of man as an 
individual, and more with “the state of man in its entirety... 
to present to modern man a portrait of himself, his problems, 
his hopes and his struggles.” 
These and many other schools of thought have gripped the 
theatre public’s imagination for almost three thousand years. 
Yet puppetry continues to sail across them all, because there 
is no school, no philosophy or formula or style to compete 
with the disarming simplicity and the naked truthfulness of 
an irrepressible puppet that plucks at the gamut of emotions 
inside the eternal child forever playacting within each of us. 
Nor is it a small tribute to the magic of Theatre that a 
lifeless Thing called Puppet can command the attention, the 
affection and the loyalty of people everywhere—sometimes 
“at fifteen shillings a seat”!

### 68967: Shakes versus Shav : battle across the centuries

SHAKES versus: 
By 
James Douglas 
LTHOUGH the fact is not generally known, the last play 
completed by the late George Bernard Shaw was a puppet 
play. Intriguingly entitled “Shakes versus Shav”, it was 
given its first performance at the Shaw Malvern Festival 
in 1949 only 15 months before the world lost one of its 
greatest modern dramatists. In the preface to the play GBS 
noted, “This in all actuarial probability is my last play and 
the climax of my eminence, such as it is.” 
Written in blank verse, a medium which GBS described as 
being “easy and expeditious”, it only runs for ten minutes. 
The preface, which is cast in the inimitable GBS mould, 
contains some stimulating views on the art of puppetry. 
“I have learnt part of my craft,” he says, “as conductor of 
rehearsals (producer, they call it) from puppets. Their 
unvarying intensity of facial expression, impossible for living 
actors, keeps the imagination of the spectators continuously 
stimulated. 
“When one of them is speaking or tumbling and the rest 
left aside, these, though in full view, are invisible, as they 
should be. Living actors have to learn that they too must 
not move a muscle nor change their expression, instead of, as 
beginners mostly do, playing to them and robbing them of the 
audience’s undivided attention. 
“Puppets have also a fascination of their own, because 
there is nothing wonderful in a living actor moving and 
28 
‘SHAV_ 
 
speaking, but that woodenheaded dolls should do so is a 
marvel that never palls. 
“And they can survive treatment that would kill live actors. 
When I first saw them in my boyhood nothing delighted me 
more than when all the puppets went up in a balloon and 
presently dropped from the skies with an appalling crash. 
“Nowadays the development of stagecraft into filmeraft 
may destroy the idiosyncratic puppet charm. Televised 
puppets could enjoy the scenic backgrounds of the cinema. 
Sound recording could enable the puppet master to give all 
his attention to the strings he is manipulating, the dialogue 
being spoken by first-rate speakers as in the theatre. 
“The old puppet master spoke all the parts himself in 
accents which he differentiated by Punch-and-Judy squeaks 
and the like. I can imagine puppets simulating living per- 
formers so perfectly that the spectators will be completely 
illuded. The result will be the death of puppetry; for it 
would lose its charm with its magic. Solet reformers beware.” 
Happily what GBS feared has not come to pass. Puppet 
plays on television entertain and fascinate young and old 
alike. The magic and charm has not been lost as witness 
the tremendous popularity of puppets when televised in 
Britain and other countries. The children of Britain, and 
their parents, clamoured for more.

Tempers quickly rise and 
they fight it out with the 
result that each knocks the 
other down in turn. But 
Shaw, by reason of his 
greater youth—“Younger you 
are by full three hundred 
years” —knocks down Shakes- 
peare for a count of ten. 
Shakespeare then carries | 
the battle forward with 
words. They resume their f 
argument in quieter mood. | 
“Couldst write Macbeth?” 1 
asks Shakespeare. “No need,” Av 
says Shaw, “He has been 
bettered,” and he calls up ue 
Scott’s Rob Roy. Both char- 5 
acters appear and fight a , 
duel. Rob Roy decapitates a 
Macbeth and the latter, head- 
less, remarks “I will return 
to Stratford: the hotels are {3 
cheaper there.” 
Shakespeare, however, is 
not satisfied with this display 
of virtuosity and quotes a line 
from Macbeth “worth”, he | 
says, “a thousand of your 
piffling plays.” Shaw res- 
ponds by quoting some heavy 
cockney rhymes by Adam 
Lindsay Gordon on the same 
subject. Shakespeare is { 
amused but returns to attack (x 
Shaw again and challenges ud 
him to produce anything to 
match Hamlet and King Lear. a 
Shaw replies with an imag- Vi 
ined extract from Heart- ui 
break House, but Shakespeare Yi 
accuses him of plagiarism. 
Shaw then proceeds to 
plagiarize Shakespeare in a 
subtly twisted fashion “To- 
morrow and tomorrow and 
tomorrow we puppets shall ¢ 
replay our scene. Meanwhile, d 
immortal William dead and 
turned to clay may stop a 
hole to keep the wind away.” 
Shakespeare protests, 
“Peace, jealous Bard” says 
Shaw, “we are both mortal, 
for a moment suffer my 
glimmering light to shine.” al 
A light appears. “Out, out, 
brief candle” says Shakes- 
peare. He puffs it out, and ; 
the puppet plays ends. (Pho- ‘

region who can restrain from breaking into a broad grin 
when the name Crefalito pops up in a conversation. 
A howlingly funny, adventurous little glovepuppet, Crefalito is 
well on his way to becoming a legendary figure of farce and good 
sense for thousands of simple fishermen and farmers round 
Patzcuaro. Yet only a few years ago he ‘wasn’t even born. His 
sing-song Mexican accent was first heard when Alfredo Mendoza 
Gutierrez set up a puppet section in the rural theatre workshop 
he directs at Unesco’s Regional Fundamental Education Centre for 
Latin America. The Spanish initials for the Patzcuaro Centre are 
CREFAL. Mendoza naturally christened his new puppet Crefalito. 
Since then, Crefalito has been joined by a cohort of other comic 
characters: Don Coyote, Indio Panza Rota (Indian Broken-Belly), 
Charalito (Skinny Bones), Mechudo (Rufflehead) and many more 
almost as popular. Their antics, scraps and scrapes are eagerly 
followed by old and yéung Tarascans alike. The puppets have 
slapstick family arguments (in local dialect), fancy folk dances, 
drinking sprees, but in every play an educational point (such as 
literacy, hygiene or commupity development) is skilfully and 
subtly woven in. “We can get our message across and give them 
amusing entertainment at the same time,” Mendoza Gutierrez says. 
All Latin American teacher-students enrolled at the theatre 
workshop study every aspect of puppetry art: carving the wooden 
figures, painting and dressing them, stage designing and writing 
plays. They then learn to manipulate the dolls and go out into 
the villages to put on their own shows. Similar training is offered 
Arab students in Unesco’s second regional education centre at Sirs- 
el-Layyan, Egypt. 
Hundreds of puppets made at Patzcuaro have left Mexico with 
their teacher-student authors for other Latin-American countries 
where they are being used once again both “to delight and to 
teach.”

   ‘Scenes from 
a Mogul Court 
HE scene may be anywhere in Delhi 
T or in the State of Rajasthan, 
northern India. Hidden behind a 
colourful curtain, a puppet player begins 
to manipulate his gorgeously robed and 
decorated marionettes. The melody of 
his songs, the beat of the drum quickly 
reach the ears of passers-by. Very soon 
an inquisitive crowd is gathered before 
the small “theatre”. The farmer come 
to town for his week-end purchases, the 
schoolmaster, the office clerks hurrying 
past, and the group of young hoys 
running home after school—all are 
drawn together by the tunes. A hundred 
pairs of eyes are focussed on the beauti- 
ful dolls which now begin to dance and 
play, weep and shout. 
The cavalcade of Indian history com- 
mences. The court-dancer, wearing a 
crimson costume interwoven with gold 
and silver thread, swings across the stage 
while Akbar, the Great Mogul, watches 
her in profound admiration. The spec- 
tators laugh as the two court jesters, 
Birbal and Todarmal, the one reputed 
for his wit the other for his wisdom, 
affectionately hug each other in greeting. 
They share the tribulations of Laila and 
per lover Majnu—India’s Romeo and Ju- 
iet. 
There is a striking difference between, 
these puppet plays (or putliwallas as they 
are called) of northern India and those 
of the southern part of the Indian sub- 
continent. The northern Indian puppet 
artist presents true stories and episodes 
in the great pageant of Mogul history 
which reached its peak with Akbar during 
the 16th century, 
The characters vividly portray the lives 
- of prince and peasant and the manner 
in which they lived, dressed and behaved 
during the Mogul period. The southern 
puppeteer specializes in dramatizations 
of mythological stories drawn from the 
two Hindu epics, the Ramayana and the 
Mahabharata. By watching South In- 
dian puppet shows, the peasant audien- 
ces have learned the moral stature of 
epic heroes like Rama and Dharmaraya. 
Scenes like these have been enter- 
taining village folk in India for genera- 
- tions untold. There was a time when 
the puppeteer could rely for his income 
on the purses of villagers either at the 
weekly bazaar or during the frequent 
melas, or festive gatherings. But today 
things have changed considerably. The 
Indian peasants have been captured by 
the spell of the cinema and the ancient 
folk art is beginning to lose its powerful 
hold on the people. 
Modern Indian educators feel that 
these puppet plays can be used to spread 
education. The puppet player who edu- 
cates the ordinary people by describing 
Mogul history, they say, can also be 
taught to show stories of modern India. 
This idea is now being given serious 
thought in India, and if a successful 
scheme can be worked out, education 
would then go side by side with popular 
entertainment in rural India.

### 68970: Asian puppetry, a vanishing art

| ASIAN PUPPETRY — 
| A VANISHING ART 
by Roshan Dhunjibhoy 
Er ee TE rE 
3 
* 
  
T has been said that puppetry is universal and as old as civiliza- 
tion itself. Nowhere is this more true than in Asia where the 
origins of the puppet play are buried deep in the mists of 
antiquity. Writing one thousand years before the birth of Christ 
the Chinese chronicler, Let-Tse tells us how the puppets of that 
epoch were made and how the puppet plays were performed. 
In the East where the present lives side-by-side with the past, 
the stories of the puppet plays have been handed down from genera- 
tion to generation and thus many old legends and traditions have 
been kept alive. In the seventh century A.D. the shadow theatre 
in Java was already a well-established art form and this early tra- 
dition can still be seen today in the Wayang puppet plays. In 
Asian eyes the puppet is not simply a doll-like figure portraying a 
story ; it is a living ancestral symbol and an intrinsic part of each 
country’s religious life. The puppet drama remains to this day in 
Asia as a true Peoples’ Theatre, presenting in vivid form and colour 
old folklore and legends in a manner easily understood by all. 
Although it has never been definitely established whether puppets 
first originated in China or India the early Indian Sanskrit writers 
ascribe their origin to Parvati, the consort of the God Shiva. 
According to thé legend she made an ingenious doll which she 
refused to show to her husband for fear of the evil power the figure 
might possess. So she took it away secretly to a mountain and hid 
it. Shiva, however, could not resist the temptation of seeing this 
figure and followed his wife. Eventually he found the doll and was so 
struck with its beauty and grace that he gave it life and power of 
movement and sent it down to the world of men. 
    
TRAVELLING PUPPETEER of China in [8th century 
carried his theatre on his head and manipulated the puppets 
from beneath a curtain. (Jacques Chesnais Collection.) 
Tales from the epic Ramayana 
there are many and varied allusions to puppets and animated 
figures in the legends of Indian literature. In the puppet plays 
performed today in South and North India the whole cavalcade of 
Indian history and mythology marches past in an endless procession 
of amazing scenes. Episodes taken from the great Hindu classics, 
the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, are the classic themes for 
South Indian showmen. For generations puppet dramas of this na- 
ture have been enacted before village audiences throughout India. 
Today, however, the Indian peasants have increasingly been brought 
under the spell of the cinema and ancient arts are losing their hold 
on the people. 
This is also true of Ceylon where the puppet theatre is now confined 
to a single coastal town in the south of the island. Ceylon most pro- 
bably inherited her puppet art from India and references to methods 
of manipulating puppets are found in ancient literary works written 
in the days of the island’s kings. Although there is no record of a 
continued tradition, or even patronage, puppetry in Ceylon still exists 
in its primitive form and the reason for its survival most probably lies 
in its traditional significance and folk connexions. 
In Java and Bali the development of the art of puppetry has been 
complex. There are no fewer than five different types of Wayang- 
puppets, each with its own individual method of colouring, carving 
and dressing the figures. The Wayang Poerwa, one of the five types, 
was originally used as a rite to communicate with the dead. The 
puppeteer (the Dalang) was believed to possess occult powers which 
enabled him to entice the spirits of the dead into his , 
puppets. Although much of this religious significance Cont’d on 
has been lost, these plays are usually performed on page 42.

THIRTY YEARS TO MASTER 
THE ART OF 'BUNRAKU’ 
  
enturies of hfe-time devotion and painstaking study by generations of 
artists have gone into the development of Bunraku, Japan's unique 
form of puppetry. What makes Bunraku really differentis thatthe 
puppets are two-thirds lLfe-size and are manipulated on a stage in full 
view of the audience. It takes three persons to manipulate a Bunraku 
puppet: the chief puppeteer garbed in an ancient ceremonial robe works 
the head and the right arm, and two assistants, one to work the left arm and 
the other, the feet. The assistants, whose presence on the stage is supposed 
to be unnoticed, are clad in black robes and hoods which signify “noth- 
ingness.” Once the Bunraku play has started, the audience Is no longer 
conscious that the puppeteers exist. It sees only the graceful or forceful 
  
38 
“actors” whose every gesture is perfectly timed to the accompaniment of 
samisen music and the joruri singers reciting the theme of the play and 
speaking the lines, Japanese consider that perfection comes after 30 years 
of training and experience. Japan's most celebrated puppeteer, Bungoro 
Yoshida (above) has spent more than 70 years in the world of puppets. 
He is renowned for his skilful manipulation of female figures. A complete 
language of gesture and movement is used to express emotion. The master 
puppeteer (below, right) 1s making the woman puppet convey her grief by 
using a handkerchief, one end in the mouth, the other in the right hand. 
One assistant moves the left hand while another suggests the movement of 
the legs—a woman puppet having none. (Photos Iwanami Films, Tokyo)

A look into the 
puppet chamber 
of Bunraku 
The first thing that strikes the visitor to 
the puppet chamber of a Bunraku Theatre 
is the disharmony in the features of the 
puppets, the eyes, eye-brows and mouths 
being wholly out of proportion, and even the 
left and right features being dissimilar. 
These proud Samurai, venerable old men, 
shifty villains, lovely young women and 
droll jesters are not simply dolls to be admired. 
They are actors and in each of them the 
character and personality of the person to 
be played is personified in the puppet’s facial 
make-up, Some faces, painted dark red (evil 
characters), are quite grotesque, A close lock 
at a female puppet which appears so lovely 
on the stage reveals that its face has the quality 
of white porcelain, with not a trace of life- 
like colouring. Frigid eyes and mouth reveal 
little that is human, The reason is that exag- 
geration is an Important trait of the puppet 
which otherwise would lose much of its 
dramatic effectiveness at a distance. And itis 
amazing to observe how, from a distance, the 
expressions of a Bunraku puppet can be dis- 
cerned on an oversized stage, Puppet heads 
which have been handed down from long ago 
have the name of the maker inscribed on the 
central stick. Prior to each performance a 
puppet is carefully prepared with its wig 
smoothed down, or its hair put up in such a 
way as to suit its role. Uncanny and grotesque 
as they may appear off the stage, the puppets 
immediately become graceful and lively figures 
as they are handled by Bunraku master 
puppeteers. (Photos Iwanami Films, Tokyo)

### 68970: Asian puppetry, a vanishing art

Asian puppetry—a fast disappearing art 
(Continued from rage 37) 
occasions such as marriages and in connexion with cere- 
monies to celebrate pregnancy or circumecision. On such 
occasions the puppeteer is accorded almost the same respect 
as a priest. 
The Wayang puppets influenced other theatrical arts, 
especially the dance which adopted many of the same move- 
ments. The plays are usually performed after sundown with 
the men sitting in the privileged positions behind the 
puppeteer so that they can watch the actual manipulation of 
the puppets. On the stage itself there is a large transparent 
white cloth with a symbolic red border stretched much in the 
fashion of a home cinema screen. Behind this stands the 
puppeteer with a finely-fashioned oil lamp hanging above his 
head. In front of the screen the women sit and watch the 
spectacle as a shadow play. 
It commences with a long prelude by a Javanese orchestra, 
but before the last sounds of the gong have died away the 
puppeteer brings on his puppets made from buffalo hide and 
decorated and painted in symbolic colours. They are divided 
into two groups—the good and refined with long thin 
features and bowed heads, as a sign of humility, and the evil 
puppets with huge bulbous noses, fat bodies and heads held 
high in pride. The complicated plots, many drawn from the 
Hindu epie, the Mahabharata, familiar to the Javanese, take 
an entire night to perform. Despite their length the audience 
listens fascinated. 
As long ago as a thousand years before the birth of Christ 
puppets were as popular in China as the cinema is today. It 
is said of the Chinese Emperor, Muh, that on one occasion 
he called in a famous puppet showman, Yen Sze, to entertain 
him and his many wives. The puppeteer, elated at being 
invited to exhibit at the Royal Palace, went happily to work 
and made a wonderful set of puppets which could open their 
lips, move their hands and roll their eyes at the audience. 
But during the performance the puppets appeared so life- 
like that the Emperor imagined them to be flirting with his 
wives. He ordered the puppeteer’s head chopped off on the 
spot. The showman begged for his life and to prove his 
innocence tore his puppets into shreds. The Emperor, realiz- 
ing that he had been made jealous by mere coloured scraps 
of paper, relented and granted him his life. 
Perhaps not all puppets are as realistic as those of Yen Sze, 
but the measure of Chinese artistry is shown by the fact that 
today shadow plays are performed all over China. The 
tradition of the puppet theatre has been preserved intact and 
to old folk tales and legends have been added adaptations 
of Chinese plays and translations of foreign works. 
The making of shadow puppets in China is a special craft. 
The figures, cut by scissors, are individually styled. Open- 
work and embroideries are indicated by delicate traceries. 
Tinted in rich translucent colours the puppets have a decora- 
tive appeal which fascinates the audience. The travelling 
puppeteer is his own theatre as he carries his stage on his 
head and manipulates the puppets from underneath his 
voluminous robe. In the 1939-1945 war the Chinese puppet 
theatre was used as an effective method of anti-Japanese 
propaganda—a good indication of the profound influence of 
puppetry on the modern Chinese peasant. 
Kabuki actors out-classed 
HE Chinese taught the art of making puppets to the 
Japanese and although the growth of puppetry in 
Japan was comparatively recent, by the mid-eighteenth 
century the Japanese puppet theatre had become the most 
lavish in the world. Through the rivalry of two puppet 
companies, drama reached such heights that it outshone 
the traditional Japanese Kabuki. Human actors watched 
the puppets to learn the niceties of acting: the revolving 
stage was introduced in the puppet theatre; the greatest 
Japanese playwright of his day, Chikamatsu, found greater 
freedom in writing plays for inanimate actors. This was 
by reason of the fact that the oriental drama had kept to. 
its ritualistic and stylized character with the result that the 
puppets became more human than the humans. 
Following this apex of Japanese puppetry a decline set in 
and it was not until 1871 that a puppet company in Osaka 
brought new life to the art. From Osaka the new form of 
puppetry spread to Kyoto and thence throughout the length 
and breadth of the country. The name of this Osaka 
company, Bunraku, has since become synonymous with the 
classical puppet theatre. 
42 
Bunkaru puppetry is actually a puppet play co-ordinated 
with ballad singing—the musical instrument used being the 
Japanese samisen, a three-stringed instrument which was 
brought to Japan from the Ryukyu Islands at the beginning 
of the Tokugawa era. The puppets and the recital are one 
as the figures move in harmony with the recitation and a 
form of musical drama is thus produced. Perfect harmony 
and synchronization are required and even the slightest de- 
viation will disorganize the movements of the puppet. 
The puppets, which are almost two-thirds life size and 
weigh about thirty pounds, are beautifully dressed. They 
are manipulated from behind by puppeteers who make no 
‘attempt to conceal themselves from the public. The principal 
puppels are each manipulated by three men—one for ine 
head and right arm, one for the left arm and a third for 
the feet—who co-ordinate their movements with the lilting 
rhythm of the samisen and the moves of the puppet’s head. 
Burmese Kings portrayed 
ably impressed with the harmony of the performance 
and are curious to know how three men moving one 
puppet can read each others minds so perfectly. This 
harmony 1s achieved only by assiduous practice. It has long 
been an established rule among Japanese puppeteers that it 
takes ten years to handle the feet properiy, ten more years 
to control the left hand and another ten to control the 
central movements. 
Thirty years spent in perfecting the art of puppet mani- 
pulation is something which could be found nowhere else but 
in Japan. It should not be imagined, however, that the 
puppeteers are the most important part of the Bunraku per- 
formance: the singers and the samisen players must also 
co-ordinate exactly in observing the traditional rhythmic 
pattern which is maintained by all participants throughout 
the entire performance. 
The puppets themselves are extremely complicated in 
construction. One figure may have as many as five different 
kinds of string controls. The faces are carefully painted and 
the wigs and garments prepared with infinite care. After 
each performance the puppet’s clothes are taken off and 
stored away. As witness of the importance of puppet per- 
sonalities it is of some significance that the secript-writer of 
a Japanese puppet play will commence his work with the 
existing puppets in his mind’s eye. The theme of the puppet 
plays has always remained the same—the triumph of justice 
and the struggle of good against evil. 
In contrast with the high moral tone of the Japanese 
puppet plays the Burmese puppeteer gives his performance 
with the primary purpose of entertaining his audience, and 
many of his puppets are lively laughable figures of fun. 
However, in common with Japan music plays its part on the 
Burmese puppet stage. The Burmese puppeteer shows a 
fight between a dragon and a peasant. The dragon is killed 
and then quickly resuscitated since for the Burmese to show 
the taking of life would be an impropriety. Genial-looking 
puppet giants are brought on to dance, and animal puppets 
perform intricate figures each having its own signature tune. 
The true Burmese puppet play, however, is more often 
than not concerned with events in the lives of the former 
Burmese Kings. These semi-divine Kings did not, appar- 
ently, object to stage representation of themselves provided 
that every detail shown of the court dress, manners and 
customs was accurate. This custom is still followed today. 
Puppetry in Burma now is a declining art and the spirit of 
the puppet theatre is largely kept alive here, as in India and 
Ceylon, by the itinerant puppeteer wandering from village to 
village and fair to fair, playing to those audiences who still 
remain out of touch with the cinema—particularly true in 
Burma where the cinema has not spread to the same degree 
as in other Asian countries. These simple yet dedicated 
artists have most probably been given the secrets of their 
calling by their fathers as the art of the puppeteer tends to 
run in families. ’ 
Asia still has its puppet theatre but the art of puppetry 
is fast disappearing in face of the ever-increasing advance of 
the travelling cinema and the radio. If this fascinating link 
with the past is not to be lost entirely, urgent steps will have 
to be taken. A new renaissance is certainly needed if this 
Peoples’ Theatre of the East is to continue to function, as it 
has for centuries past, bringing art into the everyday lives of 
the ordinary people,

uPPET shows are extremely popu- 
lar with adults and children 
throughout the Soviet Union. 
Each Republic has its own national 
puppet theatre which sends out tour- 
ing shows to farms and villages. 
Training centre for puppeteers In 
Russia is the Moscow State Puppet 
Theatre, directed by Sergei Obrazt- 
sov who has supervised 16,000 perfor- 
mances since he started the theatre 
in 1931. Shows are given every everl- 
ing for adults and in the daytime 
for children. The theatre has a 
unique museum with over 3,000 pup- 
pets and marionettes from different 
lands. Obraztsov has brought hand 
puppetry—the most common form in 
Russia—to an elevated position as a 
branch of the theatre, an art in which 
actors, painters, designers, writers, 
composers and producers combine 
their talents to create spectacles 
ranging from fairy tales to biting 
satires. Photo, left, shows Sergei 
Obraztsov manipulating “The Drunk- 
ard”, a character he uses to satirize 
what he describes as the “dangerous 
romance” of drunkenness in many 
countries. To collect liquid “drunk” 
by the puppet, Obraztsov has a rubber 
bottle on his knee. Photos below 
show other puppets he uses in shows.

HATE to boast but everybody knows me. I'm an institution 
I like Father Christmas, summer vacation at the seaside 
or g good cup of tea. Every now and again the rumour 
may go round that I'm on my way out but you pay no mind, 
I'l] still be in business, alive and kicking when you're all 
gone, 
Kings and princes give me a good laugh. Can any of them 
trace their ancestors back more than a paltry thousand 
years ? Look at me, I've got a history that stretches three 
thousand years behind me. 
Yes I know, the chronicles say I first began to thump, 
thwack and thqueak in Naples towards the end of the 16th 
century. But chronicles be hanged! I was an up-and-going 
concern long before your serious-minded, grim-jawed chro- 
niclers began to take any real notice of me. 
I'm as old as Homer’s Greek warrior Thersites, “squinting, 
bandy, misshapen and deformed, with long pointed head 
and a strand or two of hair”; as old as the hunch-backed 
figures in those ancient Egyptian tombs. And who knows, 
maybe I'm even older than that, perhaps as old as creation 
itself and the first wry cry of mockery and revolt that hit 
the world. 
Of one thing you can be sure. That saucy buffoon, Maccus, 
who had the ancient Romans howling with laughter in his 
Atellan farces, was a great-great grandpappy of mine. He 
had my features, a long beaked nose, a humped back and 
a protuberant belly, and was a gay dog, witty, insolent and 
ferocious who ran all sorts of risks to satisfy his appetites. 
There was that other fellow too, Bucco, a sort of hanger- 
on of Maccus’s, a braggart, a coward and a flatterer. I have 
something of each of them in me. 
Where did my name come from? The historians are still 
puzzling their brains over that one and some pretty far- 
fetched explanations have been put forward. But it is gene- 
rally agreed now that my nanre has something to do with 
the word pulcino, a chicken (my beak, walk and chirping 
voice do resemble a bird's, I'll admit). My barnyard squawks 
earned me the latin name Pullus Gallinaceus. Pulcino 
became Pulcinella in Italy, Polichinelle in France, Punchi- 
nello and then just plain Punch in England. 
My voice, by the way, comes from a curious little metal 
whistle called “schwazzle” or “squeaker” which goes back 
to the ancient Greeks who first used it for their string ma- 
rionettes. When my master holds the schwazzle in his

mouth—and doesn’t make the mistake of swallowing it—it 
gives me my earsplitting falsetto. 
During the night of the Middle Ages, by which I mean the 
obscurity in which we lived during the vogue for mystery 
plays, I led a lusty but undistinguished life in the market 
place. Then came the Renaissance in Italy. A popular 
drama of stock characters grew up, some of them grotesquely 
padded—the Commedia dell’arte. 
Each of the characters spoke a different dialect; Pantaloon 
was a Venetian, the Doctor hailed from Bologna, and 1 
became a Neapolitan, I was no longer hunch-backed but 
stood as straight -as anyone, wearing a loose white smock 
held in by a leather belt, from which hung a money-bag and 
a wooden sword, loosely gathered trousers, a black half- 
mask with a beak nose and long mustachios and a beard, 
a white scull-cap and an enormous grey hat with the brim 
turned up on each side to form an over-sized peak. 
I was a boaster, conceited, cowardly, greedy, shameless 
and profligate, a real child of Naples, and Naples took me 
to its heart. It cracked me up to the skies, gave me a 
theatre, and created special plays for me in which I could 
disport myself as I pleased. Wooden puppet or flesh-and- 
blood, Naples rushed to see me, crowding in, from the king 
to the basest of the lazzaroni. And it went on for ages. I 
might lose my beard and grow wrinkled, change my hat 
for a sugar-loaf cap, and grow a wart on my nose, but Naples 
was still true to me and adored me. It was prouder of me 
than of Virgil’s tomb! 
In the meantime, having become a star, I began to travel. 
In 1653 I arrived in France. The welcome I received was 
not very enthusiastic; the audiences thought me crude, and 
gave me the cold shoulder. You will find me only in a few 
of Lulli’s and Campra’s ballets, in an interlude of Moliere’s 
“Le Malade imaginaire” and in plays where strolling players 
appear on the scene. And I should have led an obscure 
exile’s life indeed had I not found at fairs, in the little 
puppet theatres, the success denied me on the stage proper. 
As a marionette, I suddenly imbibed a Gallic with and 
became a hunch-back again. Certain French scholars have 
explained that I am a caricature, if not of Henry IV, at 
least of the Gascon officers who paraded around their master 
at Saint Germain or the old Louvre; that the hump on my 
back is the eternal symbol of raillery and that on my chest 
is the soldier's breast-plate fashionable at the time; that 
my cocked hat is the one worn by gallants of the day; that

my jovial bold and amorous humour is modelled on King 
Henry's; and in short, that I am, from head to foot, a spon- 
taneous product of the French imagination. 
Others, more cautious, agree that I hailed from Italy but 
became identified with the typical mercenary soldier of the 
French religious wars, a swashbuckler, a pillager. My bom- 
bast, my ruffianly insolence and my showy garb were suggest- 
ed by the absurd ostentation the Castilian nobles affected 
at Court when peace had been restored. 
At all events, now that I was a Parisian, I had to strip 
myself of clownishness, gluttony, cowardice, base vanity and 
brutish sensuality. Though still rather... Rabelaisian, I 
grew brisk, lively, gay and witty. In 1649, in the hands of 
Jean Brioché on the left bank of the Seine, by the Pont- 
Neuf, I came out boldly on the side of the Fronde against 
Mazarin; in 1686, just after the revocation of the Edict of 
Nantes, with Francois Brioché at the Chateau-Gaillard, I 
made sport of the discomfiture of the Huguenots.

But my real battlefield and happy hunting ground were 
the great Fairs of Paris, the Foire Saint-Germain and the 
Foire Saint-Laurent, where, for more than a hundred years, 
I played to full houses—and I don’t mean wooden benches 
in the open but proper theatres with pit and boxes and bal- 
cony—making game, more or less with impunity, of every- 
body and everything. I was not content with my repertory 
of often rather unsavoury short plays buf provided a run- 
ning commentary on major and minor contemporary events, 
from the occasion when Madame de Saint-Sulpice’s panniers 
caught afire to Law’s Mississippi Scheme. 
Above al], I flung myself heart and soul into the “Hundred 
Years War” then raging between the privileged players—the 
Opera and the French and Italian Players—and the stroll- 
ing players. My little wooden body could snap its fingers 
at edicts and penalties, so, in 1722, Lesage and other authors 
gave to me the plays they had intended for the Opéra- 
Comique. ’

And what a success they were! 
them. 
o'clock the next. 
painted and bedizened, tricked out with red and green and 
yellow, I parodied one by one all the successes of our rivals; 
Destouches and Voltaire had no terrors for me, and I was, 
in turn, Apollo, Cupid, Anadis and Alcide. 
All Paris flocked to see 
We played, from ten o'clock one morning to two 
I found I liked singing and dancing; 
Alas, with the eighteenth century, the Golden Age of the 
puppet theatre came to an end. The Foire Saint-Germain 
and the Foire Saint-Laurent faded away, and the fair on 
the Boulevard du Temple became the rage. There was no 
room for me there except in a few pantomimes not made 
to my-measure, and I preferred to retire to the world of 
children. I who loved no one, wanted to be loved. And 
they loved my bright motley, my cocked hat, my hooked 
nose, my nutcracker chin and my squeaky voice. I beat 
my wife, my creditors and the policeman, and they clapped; 
I was a creature of instinct, like them, and we were friends 
—even though that upstart Guignol was a very much milder 
version of my character. 
During the Revolution, in 1793, when Paris was the scene 
of bloodshed at the Carousel and the Champ de Mars, my 
plays ended, fittingly, with my death at the guillotine. 
And speaking of revolutions, it was not I but Mr. Payne 
Collier who said that the Revolution of 1688 brought about 
two memorable events: the accession of the House of Orange 
and my own arrival in England. In point of fact, it seems 
that I came not from Holland in the train of William III, 
but from France in the train of the Stuarts, At first I was 
a string marionette and only at the end of the 18th century 
did I become the glove-puppet Punch. 
I was a little over-awed at the beginning but still put on 
a gay, rowdy, boastful and rakish air, though there was no 
real harm in me. I gave light relief with my buffooneries 
to the puppet plays based on the Bible, as Sir John Spendall 
and the Old Vice had done and continued to do. But I 
soon put them in the shade and, in London as in Paris, 
became the king of the marionettes. Addison and Steele 
had something to do with it. Thanks to the articles in the 
Tatler, Powell, who I must admit was a very clever puppeteer, 
and I became famous. When we settled in London in 1710, 
Steele went so far as to say that we outshone the new Ita- 
lian Opera and that I, Punch, was as popular with the fair 
sex as the famous singer Nicolini. 
The following year, when we had established ourselves in 
Covent Garden, we had such a success they used to call us 
“cathedral emprtiers”, and our friend Addison said that 
Punch’s Theatre, was the place in all London where you 
were Ir ost likely to meet a violent death. I had the honour 
of appearing in Swift’s verse and Hogarth’s engravings.

All this success not unnaturally went to my head. I sat 
on the lap of the Queen of Sheba, sent the King of Spain 
about his business, attacked Saint George with his foot on 
the dragon, and made the most unsuitable jokes in the 
middle of the most pathetic scenes. And the more impudent 
I was, the more mocking, the more overbearing, irascible, 
rough and violent, the more the spectators loved it. It was 
really their fault that I became a rogue. 
By the end of the eighteenth century, the script makes 
me a sort of Henry VIII, a Blue Beard, a “Don Juan of the 
people”; I intrigue, beat my wife and her relations, throw 
my child out of the window, roam about the world and win 
all women's hearts, save three. I slay fathers and brothers, 
hang the hangman and kill the devil. 
And in the Tragical Comedy of Punch and Judy, published 
by Payne Collier in 1828, I am a combination of corpulent, 
sensual Falstaff and cold, inhuman Richard Crookback. I 
knock senseless the dog, the neighbour, my baby, my wife, 
the doctor, the servant, the policeman, the sergeant, the 
hangman and the devil, and I laugh. And everybody else 
laughs with me. No doubt, the merciless severity of the old 
customs made people kindly disposed towards those who fell 
into the clutches of the law, but there was a difference bet- 
ween that and applauding my crimes and urging me on to 
commit more. 
I believe that after all I personified one aspect of the 
English character—presence of mind, strength of character, 
self control. I might be a bad husband and a bad father 
but the English appreciated the stout-hearted mockery with 
which I met the sentence of death, the ruse I devised to 
take the hangman prisoner in my place, and my courageous 
struggle with the devil. This struggle with the devil was 
a great thing. In the old moralities, the Old Vice stood up 
boldly to the demon but was finally carried off to Hell; I 
killed him, so that we had something like the duel of Satan 
and Sin in Milton. And this out-deviller of the devil which 
Byron, smiling, finds akin to himself, this persevering and 
resourceful spirit which triumphs always and in everything 
was the kind of hero the English wanted. 
I might say that, in Germany, I am called Hanswurst, in 
Austria, Kasperle, in Holland, Hans Pickelharing and Jan- 
Klaassen, in Spain, Don Cristobal Pulchinela, in Russia, 
Petrouchka and, in Turkey, Karagoz. It would not be liter- 
ally true, and yet there would be something in it. 
At the end ofethe 15th century the buffoon in the German 
puppet plays was Hanswurst (John Sausage). His part was 
that of Polichinelle or Harlequin, and the character was 
similar, but his behaviour was quite different. , 
His two outstanding features were gluttony (Cont'd on 
—particularly excessive fondness for the next page)

Karagéz, the famous puppet character of Turkey, 
who looks strangely like Popeye, is now only a memory 
in the minds of old men. Puppets came to Persia and 
the Byzantine Empire from India. Their spread was 
~ quickened by their association with the Muslim faith. 
Karagoz moved from Turkey along the shores of North 
Africa to Macedonia and from there to Greece. 
: The plays revolve around the 
personality of one man, a stone- 
mason named Karagoz. It is 
believed that this man really 
did exist and was employed, 
together with a companion cal- 
led Hacivad, to build a mosque 
for the Turkish Sultan. How- 
ever, so the tale relates, the two 
masons were apparently great 
talkers and the other workers 
in the mosque would gather 
round and listen to them. 
Work was brought to a stand- 
still and the Sultan hearing of 
this ordered the two executed. 
After the sentence had been 
carried out the Sultan regretted 
his hasty action as he too had 
enjoyed listening to their con- 
versation. To distract his mas- 
ter the Vizier made two puppets, 
Karagoz and Hacivad, and with 
these he enacted the conversa- 
tions of the two friends for the 
Sultan’s pleasure.   
MR. PUNCH (cont'd) 
national dish to which he owes his name—and stupidity. 
He was so successful that he was gradually introduced into 
all the plays in the repertory. - 
The monotony of his character is therefore offset by the 
variety of his adventures; he is constantly struggling with 
bears, apes, snakes and dragons; he rides a flying horse 
and has an encounter with Death. He bears the head of 
Cyrus and, as a night watchman, sounds the last hour of 
Faust. With his materialism, his vulgarity and his cowardice, 
he is the living antithesis to the fearless, distinguished, 
metaphysically minded masters he serves. But he has the 
pedestrian common sense that they disdain and that is why, - 
unlike Don Juan, he is saved and unlike Faust, gets the 
better of the Devil. Driven off the stage in the eighteenth 
century by the ascendency of French taste in the theatre, 
condemned and outlawed, he yet survived, or rather his place 
was taken by Kasperle. 
Kasperle is the Austrian member of the family, from 
Vienna. Though foolish and credulous, he is less crude and 
unmannerly. He is a young peasant who combines simple 
mindedness with a certain native wit, and arouses laughter 
by his artless reflections and improbable schemes. 
In Holland, Hanswurst was supplanted by Hans Pickel- 
haring (John Salted Herring) and later by Jan-Klaassen 
(John Nicholas), who inherited the boisterousness and cheer- 
ful roguery of France’s Polichinelle and England’s Punch. 
In Spain, although most of the puppeteers were foreigners, 
and although the Italians had a great influence on the art, 
the subjects and characters are entirely Spanish. Only the 
strong personality of Pulcinella made a place for himself 
under the name of Don Cristobal Pulchinela. But in spite of 
the dignity of naturalization, he kept company for the most 
part with performing monkeys and blind men. 
Little is known about Petrouchka, the Russian buffoon. He 
has quite possibly been influenced by Germany, Italy and 
France, but there is not much sign of it. He is impetuous,

Although the story 
may be apocryphal 
there could be no 
question of the popula- 
rity of Karagoz, who 
was presented as a ra-~ 
ther crude rough and 
ready person. His op- 
posite number, Hacivad, 
was a would-be aes- 
thete who spoke Per- 
sian and Arabic and 
had some knowledge of 
music and literature. 
The scenes of the plays 
were laid in Turkey 
and typical local cha- 
racters such as the 
seductive dancing girl, 
the village simpleton 
Beberuhi, the opium 
addict, the local Don 
Juan and foreigners 
from Greece, Albania 
and the Levant all played their parts. However, the 
real charm of the plays lay in the dialogues between 
the two principal characters. These would often sati- 
rize day to day events, old literary classics and human 
nature itself. Although ribald in tone the plays 
usually contained a simple moral based rather on 
common sense than on any strict ethical code. The 
Karagioz puppet plays can no longer be seen in Turkey 
but stil] flourish today in North Africa and Greece.

shameless, pugnacious and slightly fatalistic in character. 
Lastly, Karagoz, the national hero of the Turks, lewd, 
shameless, an inveterate maker of puns and outrageous jokes, 
is surely the character through whom an oppressed people 
critized an oppressive government, and those who lived 
under constraint gave free rein to their imagination. 
And what is it that gives us all, despite our clear-cut and 
distinct national features, an undeniable family likeness— 
Punch, Polichinelle and all the others, my ancestors, my des- 
cendents, my brothers or distant cousins? 
Though bearing the stamp of different national characters 
and tastes, we are the incarnations of a single popular tra- 
dition; we represent revolt, the revolt of instinct against the 
prohibitions of law and morality, of simplicity against the 
complexities of civilization, of common sense against follies 
and stupidities and vices, of the love of justice —whatever its 
shortcomings — and 
of freedom against * 1]

### 68972: Strange tales from the puppet world

Strange tales from 
the puppet world 
m Puppets were once as famous and 
popular in the Western world as Mickey 
Mouse is today. In Greece “string- 
pullers” jogged along the roads to 
entertain the populations of Athens, 
Sparta and Thebes offering real mario- 
nette shows. Xenophon, in the 5th 
century B.C. tells the story of a Syra- 
cusan who earned his living at Athens 
with puppet shows, and relates how the 
  
man was called in to divert the guests 
at a famous banquet given by the great 
statesman Callias. At one period a 
puppeteer was permitted to play at the 
Theatre of Dionysius where the great 
tragedies of Euripedes had formerly 
been staged. Antioch, King of Syria, 
had a puppet theatre in his palace and 
even manipulated the dolls himself. 
m What's the difference between a ma- 
rionette and a puppet? In English, 
puppet is a much older word, coming 
from the Latin pupa for *“doll” or 
“girl” or “little creature”. It’s been 
spelled poupette, poppit and poppet. 
Shakespeare speaks of it many times, 
and as the story goes, he may have 
written “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” 
and “Julius Caesar” with puppets in 
mind. In his day a puppet show was 
called a motion. Today the general 
word for animated figures is puppet, 
which may be operated from below, 
from the plane of action, or from above, 
   
  
These airy plastic marionette toys are

with sticks, rods, strings or wires. 
Puppeteers refer to hand (or glove} 
puppets, finger puppets, rod puppets, or 
string puppets. There are other types 
such as the shadow plays, the lever- 
operated Japanese puppets and “jigging 
puppets”, a popular street entertain- 
ment for centuries in which a string 
passed horizontally through the breast 
of one or two figures to the performer’s 
knee. Marionette is the preferred word 
today for string or wire puppets, and is 
a relative newcomer to English. 
m Legend has it that in the early days 
of the Renaissance the name mario- 
nette was affectionately given to the 
little articulated images of the Virgin 
Mary. The word is of Italian-French 
origin, and a mariolette was a “little 
little Mary”. The early Christians used 
the dolls to teach the new religion. 
 
  
Later in mystery, miracle and passion 
plays jointed figures of madonnas, 
saints, angels and demons were used in 
church festivals. The church banned 
the practice in a 16th century edict. 
Hm It is a matter of opinion whether 
these religious figures used during the 
Middle Ages—and also up to compara- 
tively modern times—could justly be 
called true puppets. The same is true 
of today’s Giant Figures of animal effi- 
gies, inflated rubber figures in human 
shape and awe-inspiring dragons car- 
ried in street processions. 
 
Bm In Europe the puppet theatre is re- 
garded as part of the folk art and tra- 
dition of each country and is respected 
as such. Up to the end of the 19th 
century, the travelling puppet theatres 
were regular visitors to country fairs 
and remote villages throughout western 
Europe. Their performances were 
usually crude and sometimes vulgar 
but they carried the drama to places 
where even the strolling players never 
ventured. Puppet shows were essen- 
tially the drama of the people and 
preserved, often for centuries, age-old 
dramatic types and popular legends. 
In the past, puppet showmen were 
usually simple, unlettered men who 
earned a meagre livelihood enacting 
what their fathers had taught them. 
m The chivalric romances, for example, 
have been enacted from medieval times 
on as puppet plays in Sicily, southern 
Italy, northern France and Belgium, 
The noble paladins of the Crusades, 
Charlemagne, Roland, the four sons of

Aymon and many others have battled 
incessantly in their richly decorated 
suits of armour, their flowery plumed 
helmets and their capes of brightly- 
coloured fabrics. Most of these puppets 
are both heavy and large (three to five 
feet tall) and are operated by two iron 
rods attached to the head or to the 
wooden shoulder piece as well as 
strings. They must be strong and 
durable to carry their elaborate armour 
and heavy swords. Until recently they 
could also be seen in New York when 
“Orlando Furioso” was presented in 
Sicilian dialect with some 400 puppets 
each weighing nearly 100 pounds. The 
medieval knights fought so hard that 
the floor boards of the stage had to be 
renewed every two weeks. They per- 
formed for two hours or more every 
night and the complete cycle of the 
play lasted 13 months! 
Wm Bible stories were an important 
feature of puppet theatres in France 
for many years, in the pre-Revolution 
days of Paris and especially in Aix-en- 
Provence, Marseille, Nice and Besancon 
during the last two centuries. At 
Christmas time the little theatres 
showed the rising Star of Bethlehem, 
the journey of the Three Wise Men and 
the Nativity. No one minded when the 
Wise Men arrived by rail or a salvo of 
  
cannon shots greeted the birth of Jesus. 
Similar crib plays are still enacted in 
Poland today, and were the first type 
of puppetry to be shown in England. 
m Puppets were so popular in England 
in Shakespeare’s day that it is said that 
 
actors protested against them for 
taking customers away from the regu- 
lar theatres. When the English Parlia- 
ment closed the regular theatres in 
1642, at the start of the Civil War, 
puppet shows had their heyday. They 
fell heir to the wealth of plays that had 
been barred from the stage, and some 
of the former actors began speaking 
their lines under the direction of 
puppet masters. 
RB Charles the Second of England ap- 
pears to have been a keen puppet fan. 
Samuel Pepys also noted that the 
King's mistress, Lady Castlemaine, 
created a traffic block and attracted a 
large crowd when she visited the pup- 
pet theatre. Oliver Goldsmith, so 
Boswell says, almost broke a leg once 
trying to prove he could jump over a 
broomstick as gracefully as a puppet. 
mR At certain periods the puppet has 
been admired for its mechanism rather 
than for its dramatic qualities. Its 
  
SCHOOL PUPPETRY is a rapidly developing subject in schools around the globe. It has been widely adopted for its educational value 
and as a means of creative expression. Right, children put on a puppet show at Unesco's education centre in Cha-Choeng-Sao Thailand.

Strange tales from 
the puppet world 
(Continued) 
movements were regarded as a sort of 
conjuring trick and the secret of its 
construction was jealously guarded. 
This aspect of puppetry was probably 
first highly developed by the Italians 
in the Fantoccini of the late 18th cen- 
tury. It was advanced by the English 
  
showman, Thomas Holden and is fur- 
ther developed today in several coun- 
tries especially Italy and Britain. 
Among the favourite tricks are the 
“dissecting skeleton” whose bones gra- 
dually float apart and dance separately 
all over the stage and then reunite, and 
a figure whose arms, legs, head and 
trunk fly apart, each becoming a sepa- 
rate puppet. 
m Hernando Cortez had a puppeteer 
along with him when he set off in 1524 
from Mexico City for Honduras in 
search of gold. The chronicler of his 
expedition, Bernal Diaz del Castillo, 
noted in his diary that Cortez had 
“five players on the oboe, sackbut and 
dulcimer, and an acrobat and another 
who did sleight-of-hand and worked 
puppets.” According to the same chro- 
nicler, the Aztec Indians of Mexico 
understood conjuring and working pup- 
pets, (“saben jugar de mano y hazer 
titeres”). American Indians in the 
Southwest United States and Northwest 
Pacific coast of Canada produced reli- 
gious puppets before the arrival of 
white men. Puppets have also been 
found in the Pacific Islands of Hawaii 
and in Easter Island. 
HW Charles Dickens who was interested 
in everything having to do with the 
theatre failed to see a puppet show in 
America during a visit, Arriving in 
New York in 1842, he wrote: “But how 
quiet the streets are!l.. Are there no 
Punches, Fantoccini?... No, not one.” 
He apparently didn’t look hard enough. 
Punch had arrived in Philadelphia 
exactly 100 years before. 
Hm During the Manchu Dynasty in 
China, high-born women were nof per- 
mitted to go out to the theatre, Sha- 
dow figures were brought to homes 
and courtyards for these women, but 
ordinary folk saw the heroic legends 
and historical tales performed in rural 
market places and country fairs. To 
this day, the centre of the art of 
shadow figures is not in the large cities 
but in the little country districts and 
small towns. So common is the affec- 
tion for shadows in China that modern 
motion pictures are called “electric 
shadows”. 
Hm In Mexico, the Ministry of Educa- 
tion has a puppetry programme for 
mass education of the people. In 
March 1945 the Ministry launched ifs 
campaign to stamp out illiteracy and 
called in two of the nation’s most 
famous puppeteers, Roberto Lago and 
Lola Cueto. They built a special thea- 
tre mounted on a lorry and travelled 
fo public squares and parks in towns 
and villages. During one tour through 
the state of Oaxaca, the puppets played 
  
to more than 10,000 people. A special 
puppet celebration was given in the 
village of Soledad de Etla when it 
was first to reach 100 per cent literacy. 
Hm A survey conducted on puppetry in 
American schools and colleges in 1941 
revealed that 35 institutions offered 
accredited courses and many had been 
doing so for ten years or more. Great- 
est number was given In art depart- 
ments; some appeared in education, 
English, foreign language and speech 
departments. Puppetry was found to 
be faring better in colleges than in ele- 
mentary schools since it was treated 
as a subject to be studied not only for 
itself but as an enrichment of other 
courses. 
Hm In the old French and English fairs 
puppets were used as advertising de- 
    
  
vices. Spectacular shows have been 
presented in modern times at interna- 
tional expositions. At the New York 
World’s Fair in 1939, puppets told the 
story of refrigeration in a series of 
dramatic episodes from prehistoric 
times when man dragged his meat into 
cool caves to preserve if to modern 
electric refrigerators. One of Ameri- 
ca’s greatest puppeteers, Remo Bufano, 
told the story of pharmacy with his 
huge marionettes in a traly specta- 
cular show-

Brazil's mamolengo 
One of Brazil's most colourful puppeteers was an old vendor of natural 
flower oils at Pernambuco fairs. Nicknamed “Cheiroso” (the perfumed 
one) he delighted audiences until his death recently with his one-man 
shows in the public squares and sometimes in schools and private homes. 
Above, he puts on quick “mamolengo™ or puppet show for group of 
children friends. Left, some of his carved finger puppets. Puppetry 
has developed widely in Brazil in past ten years under impetus of Brazil's

plays based on country's rich folklore and music are aimed at adult 
public in Rio and other large cities. (Photos copyright Verger-Adep)

### 68973: Puppets, source of literary inspiration

Puppets, source of 
literary inspiration 
by Jacques Chesnais 
innovation as one of France's most famous theatrical 
producers, Gaston Baty—whose name is linked with 
those of Louis Jouvet, Sacha Pitoeff and Charles Dullin in 
the period between the two world wars—startled the world 
A FTER more than a quarter of a century of struggle and 
by announcing his withdrawal from the legitimate stage to- 
set up a puppet theatre. 
Gaston Baty had not suddenly gone mad nor was his 
decision a wild spur-of-the-moment flight of fancy. Baty 
had come to realize that puppetry was a new form of art 
which, though sometimes primitive in technique, opened vast 
potentialities for creative expression impossible to achieve in 
the legitimate theatre. 
In the history of modern art, a break occurred between 
figurative art which produced naturalism and abstract art 
which exploded on the world with surrealism. This eruption 
was to place puppetry—which had always been the theatre 
of the people—on a new level as a true art form. 
Baty was following in the footsteps of many great men of 
letters and artists of the past who have found a deep source 
of inspiration in puppetry. 
Almost all of the great writers of antiquity mention 
puppets. Even before they became a great means of 
expression puppets embodied a whole philosophy of their 
own. This did not escape the great Cervantes when he 
devoted a chapter of his “Don Quixote” to “the braying 
adventures and the droll one of the puppet master.” Cer- 
vantes perceived that the marionette could portray the true 
image of Man as reflected in his caricature and could give 
credulity to the poetic folly of his hero and his combination 
of idealism and plain logic. 
In his description of Master Pedro and one of the popular 
road puppet theatres of his time Cervantes blends reality 
with fantasy. The whole chapter is imbued with a profound 
sense of humanity. “In all earnestness, gentlemen,” says 
Don Quixote after he has slashed at all the puppets to save 
a doll-damsel in distress, knocking some over, beheading 
others, crippling this one and mangling that one, “I can 
assure you that everything that took place here seemed to 
me very real indeed, and Melisandra, Don Gaiferos, Marsilio 
and Charlemagne were all their flesh-and-blood selves.” 
The same episode inspired the modern Spanish composer 
Manuel de Falla to write a musical score entitled “Master 
Pedro’s Puppet Show”. De Falla also worked with Federico 
Garcia Lorca, who has been called the “poet of the puppets”. 
in productions of several puppet plays. 
Ben Jonson, the English dramatist, writing at almost the 
same period as Cervantes, used puppets in his “Bartholomew 
Fair’—one of the great London fairs of his time--to 
stigmatize fanaticism and intolerance. The puppets, serving 
as accessory bul vitally important characters, helped to tell 
a highly dramatic and human story. 
‘Shakespeare of the Far East’ 
INCE the 12th century, puppets have been part and 
parcel of Japanese drama and even were the basis of the 
theatre in Japan. They inspired more than 100 plays 
during the 17th century from the pen of Japan’s greatest 
dramatist, Chikamatsu Monzaemon. Born in 1653, Chika- 
matsu first lived the life of a Knight Errant until he settled in 
Osaka and began to write plays for the Joruri puppet stage. 
Chikamatsu has been called the “Shakespeare of the Far 
as ed 
In the West, puppetry has still to reach the great heights 
attained in Japan. Asian cultures are particularly suited to 
the conventions and symbolism which evolved in puppetry 
where every movement of the face or limbs of the dolls is 
part of a veritable language of gestures. 
Nevertheless Western puppets have played important roles. 
On several occasions the miniature theatres have served as 
a place of refuge for oppressed or victimized dramatists. In 
18th century France, for example, the ‘legitimate theatres 
held a virtual monopoly of dramatic productions and pre- 
vented competition from independent groups. A number of 
56 
Parisian dramatists had resort to the puppet theatres of their 
time to maintain their right to self-expression. 
Among the many men who have found deep inspiration in 
puppet shows is the great German poet Goethe. The legend 
of Dr. Faustus had been a frequent and popular theme of 
marionette theatres in Germany as early as the 16th century. 
During the Romantic period of Goethe’s time it struck a 
particularly sympathetic chord and like all his con- 
temporaries, Goethe found himself captivated by the puppet 
play. He was to transform this elementary tale of 
necromancy and mysticism into a theme that is today 
immortal. From the conflict naively expressed in the puppet 
drama, Goethe was to draw out a series of problems of 
universal impact and produce his greatest play. 
The same period saw another great German dramatist, 
Heinrich von Kleist, complete a tiny essay entiled “The 
Puppet Theatre.” Though small in size it was considerable 
in importance. Here for the first time, marionettes inspired 
a text in which the technique of puppetry was the basis 
for deep reflexions of a psychological nature and the basis 
of an admirable comparative study between the moving 
marionette and the human dancer. 
Rendez-vous of sophisticates 
UPPET shows had always been manifestations of folk art. 
In technique and repertory they were mainly traditional 
and handed down from generation to generation. That 
they could also provide fashionable, sophisticated entertain- 
ment was amply demonstrated in the private and semi-pri- 
vate performances in France during the mid-19th century. 
With her son Maurice, the novelist George Sand built the 
Theatre des Amis first at Nohant and then in Paris. The 
puppet theatre, with its satirical plays, soon became the ren- 
dez-vous of -all fashionable people in Paris, and George Sand 
a champion of the cause of puppetry. 
Other authors and poets of the time were also inspired to 
write passages on marionettes which are now considered 
famous. (Theophile Gautier, Gerard de Nerval, Charles No- 
dier and Louis Duranty are four outstanding names.) But 
it was not until the closing years of the 19th century that a 
real revival took place. Puppets were then “discovered” as 
an artistic medium and writers and artists accorded them a 
serious respect they had not enjoyed before. 
The year 1887 saw the birth of the now internationally 
famous “Black Cat” cabaret in Montmartre where successful 
poets, musicians and painters gathered to produce artistic 
shadow shows. It was followed by the “Little Theatre” 
which gave performances of Cervantes, Aristophanes and 
Shakespeare with stately rod puppets and revealed the great 
marionette poet Maurice Bouchor. . 
Puppets have continued to hold a great attraction for 
writers ever since. Maeterlink, the Belgian poet-dramatist, 
wrote some of his earliest plays for the puppet stage, though 
he later abandoned the little wooden actors. Collodi’s 
“Pinocchio” has become a classic; Bernard Shaw wrote 
“Shakes v. Shav” (see page 28); Bizet paid his tribs-te in “The 
Funeral March of a Marionette” and Paul Claudel wrote 2 
puppet farce “The Bear and the Mbon.” Alfred Jarry's 
satirical play, “Ubu Roi” greatly influenced the surrealist 
movement in literature. The list of authors is almost endless. 
The puppet revival in our own time has gained momentuns 
among playwrights and producers. Gordon Craig in his 
essay “On the Art of the Theatre” sees the future of the 
theatre in the creation of a super-marionette who is the 
“complete actor.” To Craig puppets are a serious matter 
and he restores them to their rightful place as an integral 
part of dramatic art. 
Today a new road is open to puppetry. Alongside the 
puppet theatre as a cultural medium on the one hand, and 
as an educational vehicle for children on the other, a new 
poetic form of marionette theatre has been born. Where the 
living actor cannot pretend to reach, the puppet, unshackled 
by human laws or limitations and symbol of dreams and 
fantasy, attains heights only the imagination can follow.

120 hours to carve 
and clothe a puppet 
Jacques Chesnais (above) manages to convey his own 
passion for the world of marionettes in the miniature 
size plays he stages with his large family of “wooden 
actors”, all of whom he designs and makes in his work- 
shop. It takes 60 hours to carve a puppet, says 
Chesnais, and 60 more hours to make the clothes. 
A wig costs 3,000 francs (£3) and the entire puppet 
adds up to 50,000 francs (£50). Thus, the kings 
and queens and fairy tale characters hanging side 
by side in their dormitory at the Comédie des Champs- 
Elysées Theatre, in Paris, add up to a tidy fortune, 
Jacques Chesnais, one of France's leading marionette 
artists, is the author of a recent history of world 
puppetry. (Photos USIS and A.T.P. Museum, Paris.)

CHILDREN MEET TURBULENT CONCERT PIANIST “PICCOLOVSKI”, WHOSE COMIC ACT CONTRASTS WELL WITH STAGECRAFT OF “VENETIAN SERENADE” SCENE. 
wEeLVE hundred marionettes, 15 tons of equipment and 
props, 100 packing cases, 1,000 costumes and 40 artists, 
technicians, musicians and singers—these are some of 
the factors which go fo make up the famous Ifalian 
“Piccoli” Theatre of Vittorio Podrecca. 
It is 43 years since Podrecca, then a journalist, art critic 
and secretary of a musical academy in Rome, decided to 
make his favourite childhood toy his life’s work. After 
minute studies of the art and history of marionettes, he 
gathered a group around his little wooden actors, three feet 
high, and presented his first spectacle of opera, variety and 
circus scenes in miniature. 
His blending of the decorative, the musical and the dra- 
matic was an immediate success in Rome. Since then, the 
“Teatro dei Piccoli” has been round the world three times 
with its remarkable repertory of operas, variety shows, fairy 
tales, ballet and folklore scenes. The reactions of audiences 
everywhere were well summed up by one theatre critic who 
wrote: “The quaint notion that the puppet show is exclusi- 
vely for children has been gently buried by Signor Podrecca, 
Who uses it brilliantly for all its quality of humour, satire 
and sophistication.” 
Podrecca’s art represents an advance in the intricate 
technique of puppet articulation. The result is a skilful 
combination of dancing figures, acting and comedy, music 
and singing. Podrecca is today recognized as one of the 
great craftsmen and artists of his time, and his performances 
have a depth and richness which go beyond the realm of 
mere entertainment. (Photos Vieno, Rome ; Vego, Paris and

EARLY SLAY PEOPLES, WHO SETTLED ON CZECH SOIL, WERE DEPICTED BY JIRI TRNKA IN HIS FILM “OLD CZECH LEGENDS. " 
N few countries are puppets held in such warm affection 
I as in Czechoslovakia. Today they are almost a national 
institution—3,000 amateur groups operate regularly in 
schools, co-operatives and cultural centres, and puppet thea- 
tres are to be found in practically every town in Czecho-

Long before the dream of the Czechs to possess a national 
theatre was realized, the puppet stage was, in fact, the peo- 
ple’s national theatre. Puppets have always been deeply 
rooted in Czech history and even participated in the long 
struggle for national freedom. When the Habsburgs tried to 
stifle Czech nationalism, travelling puppet theatres helped 
to keep it alive. In the First World War they sparked popu- 
lar resistance movements. Josef Skupa, today an interna- 
tional figure and a Czech State artist, used the voice of his 
mocking little Kasparek—a half brother to Punch, Guignol 
and Pulcinella—to rouse the people of Pilsen against the 
Austro-Hungarian monarchy. 
During the last war, Skupa’s marionettes again spoke out 
for freedom through his now internationally famous cha- 
racters, Spejbl, the vain, narrow-minded father, and Hurvi- 
nek, his young scamp of a son, cheeky, argumentative and 
full of mischief. Spejbl and Hurvinek were soon locked up 
in a cupboard at Gestapo headquarters in Pilsen, and Skupa 
found himself in a prison cell at Dresden. But other coura- 
geous marionettists like Jan Malik took his place and their 
secret performances were seen by hundreds of peoplg. 
In 1948, a law placed puppetry on a level with all other 
branches of drama. Today Czechoslovakia has ten profession- 
al marionette art theatres and even a Chair of Puppetry in 
the Prague Academy of Musical Arts. In schools and colleges 
the puppet show is widely used as a means of developing 
self-expression, arts and crafts and as-an effective way of 
teaching different subjects. 
Since 1946, Czechoslovakia has received international 
acclaim for its work in the new field of film puppetry. Fil 
by Hermina Tyrlova, Karel Zerman and especially Jiri rani 
have won leading awards at the Festivals of Venice, Cannes, 
Brussels, Edinburgh and elsewhere. Jiri Trnka, a former 
student of Josef Skupa, produced three full-length puppet 
films between 1947 and 1951. In Spalicek (The Czech Year) 
his puppets brought to the screen six merry peasant festi- 
vals. His “The Emperor and the Nightingale” was based on 
Hans Anderson’s fairy tale and in “Prince Bayaya” he 
recounted one of his country’s best-known folk tales. 
Hermina Tyrlova scored a great success with “The Toys’ 
Revolt”, an echo of Nazi occupation days, in which she used 
both living actors and puppets, as did Karel Zerman, in his 
“Christmas Dream.” 
o:awing on the rich ancient traditions of the Czech 
puppet theatres, these masters have succeeded in developing 
a new art form in today’s popular medium of entertainment 
—the cinema.

TWO THOUSAND DESIGNS recently

a gay, multi-coloured carpet (above), for there 
was not enough wall space to take them 
all. They were entries in a United Nations

international work in fundamental education. 
Photo (far right) shows a social science team 
being welcomed at a small village where it 
carried out a social survey of the people, 
their numbers, needs and the pattern of their

countries—these are the foundations on which 
fundamental education programmes are built, 
When the village education programme began 
a member of the Unesco Centre's literacy 
team recited prayers with the villagers. 
These prayers were later written on black- 
boards and posters and printed in booklets 
—and the villagers read them for the first 
time. (Unesco photos).

From the Unesco Newsroom 
I’AUSE FOR THOUGHT: 
Travellers who usually hurry 
through one of Paris’s largest 
railway stations nowadays stop 
to take a look at an exhibition 
which tells the story of man’s 
long fight for human rights. 
Organized by the French Na- 
tional Commission for Unesco, 
the exhibition stresses one par- 
ticular article in the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, 
adopted by the U.N. General 
Assembly in 1948 — Article 13 
which deals with the right to 
travel freely. The exhibition 
will eventually move to other 
French railway stations. 
% ISOTOPE TRAINING: 
The first radio-isolope re- 
search and training centre in 
the Middle East will shortly 
begin operations in Cairo. 
The Egyptian Government 
announces that teams of 
Egyptian doctors, physicists, 
chemists and other scientists 
will study radio-activily 
problems in U.S, universities 
and then return to work at 
the Cairo centre. 
‘EUROPEAN’ HIGH 
SCHOOL: The first “European” 
secondary school is now operaf- 
Ing in Luxembourg on the 
principle of “five nationalities 
—Belgian, Dutch, French, Ger- 
man and Italian—four langua- 
ges and one teaching method.” 
Altogether, in the new school, in 
a primary school opened a year 
ago, and in a kindergarten, a 
community of 225 children now 
receive a common education in 
four different languages. 
+ ART ON TOUR: Prints of 
works by Japanese artists, 
many of which have never 
been shown outside Japan 
before, are now being seen by 
people in twenty countries 
through Unesco Travelling 
Exhibitions. Twenty sets of 
one hundred prints, repres- 
enting the work of Japan- 
ese artists from the 17th to 
the 19th centuries, were 
offered by Unesco to iis 
member states. A new Unes- 
co Travelling Exhibition of 
colour reproductions of Chi- 
nese paintings is now also 
starting on a world tour. (See 
Unesco Courier, No. 1, Vol. 8, 
1955.) 
AID FROM NORWAY: 
Seventy-two Norwegian spe- 
cialists now work in various 
parts of the world under the U.N. 
Technical Assistance Program- 
me, and others are employed at 
Travancore, India, under Nor- 
ways own India Aid Pro- 
gramme. In addition, 244 stu- 
dents from underdeveloped 
countries have studied in Nor- 
way under U.N. Fellowships. 
This year, Norway intends to 
raise its U.N. Technical Assist- 
ance contribution  sharply— 
probably donating four times 
the money it gave last year. 
+ INDIA'S NEW INDUS- 
TRY: India’s first mnews- 
print factory recently slart- 
ed production at Nepa Nagar 
in the Slate of Madhya 
Predesh. It unll shortly be 
producing 100 tons of news- 
print a day—one third of the 
country’s newsprint require- 
ments. Though it is using 
imported chemical pulp at 
the start of production, the 
factory's own chemical sec- 
tion will be ready before the 
end of the year. 
Mow OTHERS LIVE: 
Swiss master bakers, Italian 
fishery workers, Danish taxi- 
drivers, German postal em- 
ployees, Swedish printers and 
people holding many other 
different jobs in 17 countries 
will be packing their bags dur- 
ing the next few months and 
setting off on Unesco study 
tours to see how their opposite 
numbers in other countries live 
and work. Altogether some 
1,200 workers will benefit from 
the 1955 study tours sponsored 
Ly Unesco which help to open 
international travel to many 
people whose budgets would 
otherwise keep them at home. 
Unesco is paying the travel ex- 
penses of 68 groups of from 10 
to 25 persons while the people 
concerned and their organiz- 
ations meet other expenses. 
Since 1952, 139 workers’ groups 
numbering 3,270 travellers have 
taken part in Unesco study 
tours. 
+ ATOMS FOR PEACE: 
Demonstrations by an oper- 
ating atomic reactor will be 
given at the forthcoming 
U.N. International Atoms for 
Peace Conference. The Con- 
ference meets in Geneva 
in August and will bring 
together scientific leaders 
from all parts of the world 
in search of fuller peaceful 
applications of nuclear ener- 
gy. Demonstrations of the 
reactor, which will be built 
in the United States, will 
enable scientists and techni- 
cians at the meeting to ob- 
serve some of its research 
possibilities. They will be 
able to operate the controls 
to start and stop nuclear 
chain reactions. From «a 
smell platform on top of the 
reactor a lecturer will direct 
the demonstrations and ex- 
plain the reactor’s operations 
to the general public attend- 
ing the Geneva Conference. 
(See special issue of the 
Unesco Courier, “The Pro- 
mise of Atomic Power”, No. 
12, Volume 7, 1954.) 
GoiNG TO TOWN: Just 
as city-bred children benefit 
physically from country holi- 
days, so those from rural areas 
san gain educationally from vis- 
sits to cities. In Poland, during 
the past three years, educational 
authorities have helped more 
than 100,000 country children to 
spend their holidays visiting his- 
torical monuments, theatres, 
art galleries and other places of 
interest in Polish cities. Last 
year, eight holiday centres in 
the chief towns were opened for 
these children. 
+ COLLECTED CLASSICS: 
Two of Latin America’s great 
classics have just been trans- 
lated into French and added 
to Unesco’s “Collection of 
Representative Works”. One 
is Gabriel René Moreno's 
“The Last Days of the High 
Peru Colony”—a 19th cen- 
tury history of the region 
that is now Bolivia. The 
other, “Tabaré’, by Uru- 
guay’'s famous poet, Juan Zo- 
rilla de San Martin, is an 
epic poem which helped the 
growth of a national senti- 
ment among the Uruguayan 
people. Unesco’s collection 
of translations from the 
world’s classics now numbers 
twenty-one. 
v 
UNEsco's STAMP : 
The United Nations is issuing 
its second commemorative stamp 
of 1955 to honour the work of 
UNESCO. Designed by George 
Hamori of Israel, the stamp 
shows the agency's symbol, a 
Doric temple whose pillars are 
formed by the letters vu-N-E-s- 
c-0. The stamp will be printed 
in three and eight cent denomi- 
nations, and will be on sale to 
collectors only in Europe. 
x FISHING FLEET FOR 
KOREA : Almost the entire 
Korean fishing fleet was des- 
troyed during the recent war, 
depriving the country of an 
important source of income 
and food. One of the pro- 
jects undertaken by the Uni- 
ted Nations Korean Recon- 
struction Agency is to rebuild 
the fleet at a cost of 
$ 3,500,000. Today shipyards 
all over the country are par- 
ticipating in the building 
programme, The first five 
fishing boats were launched 
in Pusan in January 1955.
