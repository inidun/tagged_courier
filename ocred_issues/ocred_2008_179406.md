EDUCATION: THE OTHER GLOBAL EMERGENCY 
The Global Monitoring Report Team 
Western countries have pulled together multi-billion-dollar plans to save 
their banking systems from catastrophe. The same determination, says the 
2009 Education for All Global Monitoring Report, Overcoming inequality: why 
governance matters, is needed to tackle failing education systems. 
hese are “extraordinary times”. 
In just a matter of weeks, seve- 
ral western countries have pulled 
together multi-billion-dollar bailout 
packages for their ailing banking 
systems, thus keeping the wheels of 
the global economy in motion. 
Without question, political leaders 
needed to act decisively and act 
now or risk catastrophic financial 
implications. 
The same determination, says the 
2009 Education for All Global 
Monitoring Report, Overcoming ine- 
quality: why governance matters, is 
now needed to tackle an equally seri- 
ous and no less urgent development 
challenge - that of ensuring social 
justice, fairness and the right to edu- 
cational opportunity for the world’s 
most vulnerable population groups. 
“When financial systems fail, the 
consequences are highly visible and 
governments act,” UNESCQ’s Director 
General Koichiro Maatsura has com- 
mented. Yet “...when education sys- 
tems fail the consequences are...no 
less real. Unequal opportunities for 
education fuel poverty, hunger, and 
child mortality and reduce prospects 
for economic growth.” 
The extent of global inequality in 
educational opportunity should give 
policymakers pause for thought. 
While over a third of children in rich 
countries complete university, a 
The UNESCO Courier ® 2008 * Special Issue 
much smaller share even completes 
primary education in much of sub- 
Saharan Africa (with just 5% reach- 
ing university level). One in three 
children in developing countries (193 
million in total) reach primary school 
age suffering from malnutrition and 
impaired cognitive growth - a figure 
that rises to over 40% in parts of 
South Asia. 
National disparities mirror global 
inequalities. In Peru and the 
Philippines, children in the poorest 
20% of the population receive 5 
years less education than their peers 
from the wealthiest families. But 
wealth is not the only marker for 
marginalization and disadvantage. 
Other deeply entrenched barriers 
result from geographical accessibility 
to schooling, gender, language and 
ethnicity. In Senegal, for example, 
children in urban areas are twice as 
likely to be in school as those living 
in rural areas. 
The picture, of course, is not all bleak 
and this year’s Global Monitoring 
Report highlights some impressive 
national and regional performances. 
Tanzania and Ethiopia have both 
reduced the number of children out 
of school by over 3 million. In a 
region marked by deep gender ine- 
qualities, Bangladesh now has as 
many girls as boys reaching second- 
ary school. In Latin America, several 
countries are enrolling and keeping 
more children in schools through 
innovative cash transfer programmes 
for the poorest households, eo e e

oe o o with payments made condi- 
tional on school attendance and 
health visits. Most remarkably, 
Mexico's Oportunidades programme, 
one of the country’s largest educa- 
tion schemes, is now being pilot 
tested in the New York City school 
system. 
Nevertheless, the overall figures 
speak for themselves. An estimated 
75 million children of primary school 
age world wide are currently out of 
school with partial projections sug- 
gesting that at least 29 million chil- 
dren will still be missing out on their 
right to an education in 2015. A fur- 
ther 776 million adults, or 16% of 
the world’s population, lack even 
basic literacy skills. Two-thirds of 
these are women. 
Without concerted and sustained 
action, the international develop- 
ment target of universal primary 
education by 2015 will move even 
further out of reach. 
More of the same will simply not do. 
That is why the way in which educa- 
tion systems are managed, policies 
developed, and resources allocated 
is in the political spotlight. ‘Good 
governance’ has become a rallying 
call, with decentralisation, the devo- 
lution of authority to parents and 
schools, and choice and competition 
recurrent themes in policy debates. 
But according to the Global 
Monitoring Report, 
reforms all too often fail to tackle 
the inequalities that are holding back 
education for all. 
governance 
Wide sweeping education reforms 
that give but a passing nod to local 
context, institutional capacity 
requirements and equity-related 
issues are not reaching the levels of 
impact desired. In fact the evidence 
shows that applying education blue- 
prints uncritically from the north, a 
practice frequently encouraged by 
the development community, will not 
lead to long term improvements in 
areas such as education resource 
allocation, school management and 
teacher recruitment. 
A perfect example relates to reforms 
surrounding the decentralization of 
national education systems in devel- 
oping countries. In the 1990s, such 
communities, they did not back this 
drive with measures to facilitate real 
participation. 
Neither have competition—and its 
corollary, choice—proved to be the 
antidote for the failings of public 
education systems, as many 
expected. Even in the United States, 
where the private and civil society 
sectors have been contracted into 
the management of public school 
systems under various forms of pub- 
lic-private partnership, the gains to 
efficiency and education perform-

reforms undoubtedly brought educa- 
tion planning closer to school com- 
munities around the world. However 
at a time when many countries were 
coping with a massive expansion in 
education provision, financial decen- 
tralisation left different regions with 
even less resources to fund learning 
resources, school maintenance and 
the teaching profession. And while 
central and local governments sup- 
ported the idea of devolving author- 
ity and decision-making to parents, 
schools and communities, especially 
those lacking voice in the poorest 
ance from the creation of charter 
schools, for example, have been 
uneven and remain inconclusive. 
In this year’s Global Monitoring 
Report, we especially take the aid 
community to task for its “collective 
failure” to deliver on development 
commitments. Many countries’ aid 
disbursements to basic education 
have stagnated since 2004. While 
countries such as the Netherlands 
and the United Kingdom still allocate 
over 60% of their aid to basic educa- 
tion in low-income countries, o o o

### 179482: Public support for education in Ecuador

PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR EDUCATION IN ECUADOR 
A public sector programme being implemented in Ecuador, where 
families are given cash to send their children to school, has led to a 
noticeable increase in attendance, while reducing child labour. 
Paulina Rivadeneira, 
Journalist with Diario Hoy (Ecuador) 
44T've often thought about taking 
my children out of school,” admits 
Luis Guaman, who earns the equiva- 
lent of US$3 a day as a construction 
worker, “but thanks to the school 
voucher, they can carry on learning.” 
This 30-year-old, who recently arri- 
ved from Imbabura, in the north of 
Ecuador, went to the offices of the 
state-run Social Protection Pro- 
gramme, looking for information 
about the Human Development Vou- 
cher (BDH). “They told me to come 
to the capital (Quito) for help,” he 
explains, looking tired after his two- 
hour journey. He has come with his 
27-year-old wife, Dolores Isama, and 
papers to prove he qualifies for the 
Voucher. His family is one of the 
1,303,318 households (October 2008 
figures) considered by the Ecuado- 
rian government as among the 
country’s 40% poorest. “Thanks to 
this help, my children can continue 
to go to school,” says Dolores, a 
housewife with three children aged 
eight, four and three years. “I want 
them to have a full education.” Like 
her, 78% of those receiving the BDH 
are mothers, and many are also head 
of the household. 
The BDH is a cash allowance set up in 
1999 under the name of “Solidarity 
Voucher.” Unlike similar programmes 
in other countries in Latin America, 
there were no strings attached. In 
the beginning, to qualify for the 
US$30 per month allowance, parents

did not have to prove they were 
sending their children to school, or 
had passed a medical examination. 
According to the World Bank, though, 
a number of beneficiaries of the BDH 
voluntarily applied these conditions. 
According to a 2006 impact assess- 
ment, the BDH scheme has led to a 
17-point increase in schooling and a 
10-point reduction in child labour. 
A new impact assessment is just 
being prepared, 
Minister for Economic and Social 
but Ecuador's 
Integration, Jeannette Sanchez, 
already expects the BDH to show “a 
significant qualitative leap” this 
year. “We are currently changing an 
assistance programme into one of 
economic protection and integra- 
tion,” she says. The main changes, 
she points out, are an increase in the 
allowance to US$30 a month, applied 
since she took office, and, especially, 
encouraging beneficiaries to take 
joint responsibility for the scheme’s 
implementation. 
“Joint responsibility means asking 
mothers to look after the education 
and health of their children,” explains 
Jeannette Sanchez. “In other words, 
that they use part of the Voucher to 
pay for these expenses.” To ensure 
that the money is being well spent, 
the government has recently carried 
out sample checks in three provinces: 
Napo and Pastaza (in Amazonia) and 
Carchi (in the mountainous region to 
the north of the country). “The pop- 
ulation in these provinces is spread 
out and health and education are 
precarious,” explains David Alomia, 
an economist and director of the 
body responsible for overseeing the 
Voucher under the ministry. 
He explains that the education and 
health controls in these three prov- 
inces looked at 1026 and 2054 house- 
holds, respectively. The study showed 
that 218 families did not present evi- 
dence of school attendance or care 
for their children under 18 years of 
age, that 242 mothers ceo

did not have certificates to 
show that their infants (under one 
year old) had attended a health clinic 
(six consultations a year) and that 
1999 mothers had not carried out the 
required health check-ups for their 
children aged between one and five 
(one consultation every six months). 
Although the latter figure seems 
alarming, David Alomia says that this 
is a general problem, affecting most 
Ecuadorians, regardless of their 
socio-economic situation. “We have 
no culture of prevention. If a child 
seems healthy, no one thinks of 
sending him to see a doctor.” When 
an irregularity is noticed, mothers 
are notified that they have 45 days 
to present a certificate. “It is likely 
that the school or health centre is 
too far from their home. But if the 
family is in the wrong, the allowance 
is suspended until they provide the 
required proof,” he explains, empha- 
sising that this is not a sanction. 
“We wouldn't want to penalise a pop- 
ulation that, until now, has already 
been excluded. Our aim is to raise 
their awareness of the importance of 
investing in education and health.”

ing the Voucher for five years and

has already seen its benefits. The 
wages of her farmer husband - US$7 
a day - are too low to send their four 
children, aged 11, 10, 7 and 5 years, 
to school. “We use the Voucher to 
pay for food and school fees. Without 
it, the children could not all go to 
school,” she says, handing a Social 
Protection Programme worker the 
documents to show that she had ful- 
filled her joint responsibility com- 
mitment - education, care, medical 
exam and vaccination certificates. 
State involvement 
Explaining that the verification cam- 
paign is now extending to cover the 
entire country, David Alomia recog- 
nises that the state also has its obli- 
gations of joint responsibility: “When 
we find ourselves faced with new

situations in terms of education and 
health care - a lack of centres, access 
problems, or complaints about the 
services provided — we pass on the 
reports to the Ministries of Health 
and Education. Once this campaign is 
over, we will have a detailed national 
picture of the social situation.” 
In 2008, the programme’s budget was 
almost US$408 million - US$48 mil- 
lion more than the previous year. 
Given the global economic crisis, it is 
difficult to predict what the BDH 
budget will be for 2009, but Ecuador's 
President, Rafael Correa, has sug- 
gested it should be increased. 
Magdalena Sepilveda Carmona, an 
independent expert on human rights 
and poverty for the United Nations, 
became particularly interested in the 
BDH scheme during a visit to Ecuador 
from 10 to 14 November. She says 
that the programme has grown, cov- 
ering a wider area, while the allow- 
ances have increased. However, she 
cautions that more efforts will be 
needed to enable families receiving 
the BDH to escape poverty and des- 
titution, especially given that almost 
38% of the Ecuadorian population 
lives in poverty and 12% in extreme 
poverty. Even if the State has 
increased its social sector spending, 
she says, “progress has only been 
partial and Ecuador is still signifi- 
cantly lagging behind.” u

### 179483: Scholarships make children hopeful

ScHOLARSHIPS MAKE CHILDREN HoPEFUL 
Nepal's innovative programme to expand primary education has proven successful. 
More than 1.7 million children get government support in the form of a scholarship 
so they can go to school... and get an education that improves their daily life.

reporter at the Nepali Times

eventh grader Shusmita Bishwa- 
karma already knows she wants 
to become a doctor. Not so long ago, 
she thought it was too good a dream 
to be true. But now she gets a scho- 
larship, she can go to school... a 
good start to fulfilling her dream. 
Shusmita is poor. Her parents moved 
to the Kathmandu valley 10 years 
ago, to escape the hardship of rural 
life and rising insurgency. Both work 
in a carpet factory 18 hours a day 
while she stays home to help with 
the cooking and the household 
chores. But Shusmita also goes to 
school. “I feel lucky because not all 
girls get the same opportunity as 
me,” she says. 
Shusmita is one of 847,412 Dalit chil- 
dren who receive financial help to

get an education. The Nepalese gov- 
ernment started the Dalit scholarship 
programme in 2001 to improve the 
literacy rate in the Dalit community, 
a low-caste group to which 13 per- 
cent of the Nepalese population 
belong. 
Shusmita and the other Dalit children 
of the neighbourhood attend Kanti 
Bhairab Secondary School in Dachi, 
on the outskirts of Kathmandu. 
Thanks to the scholarship programme, 
the school has had a significant 
increase in girls’ and minority stu- 
dents’ enrolment: today, 60 percent 
of the students are girls, and 65 per- 
cent are from the Dalit and the 
Janajati communities. 
Although fewer scholarships are 
available to older students- only 10 
percent of secondary school students 
get financial help- the programme 
has been a success. Bal Krishna 
Shrestha, the assistant headmaster 
at Kanti Bhairab, says the enrolment 
rate has jumped by 10% this year. 
“Some parents even pulled out their 
children from boarding schools and 
put them in our school,” he says. 
Shrestha adds that the scholarship 
initiative has driven down the drop- 
out rate, which is usually high among 
poor girls who often have to look 
after their siblings or work in the 
fields with their parents. 
Expanding primary 
education with 
scholarships 
In the past few years, Nepal has 
made education a priority. The gov- 
ernment, in close partnership with 
the school districts, sponsors several 
scholarships programme that make 
school more affordable to low-caste 
groups, low-income families and 
orphans. In the remote, mountainous 
zone of Karnali for instance, almost 
all girls from grade 1 to 10 receive a 
scholarship. 
The scholarship programmes also 
seek to reduce gender disparity at 
school. “The government is working 
with local organizations to campaign 
for girls” education. eee

e o o The campaigners visit door to 
door to explain to families why girls 
should go to school,” says Surendra 
Acharya, the section officer at the 
Department of Education. 
So far, the initiative has been very 
successful. According to UNESCO's 
Global 
Education (2009), primary school 
Monitoring Report on 
enrolment increased by 15 percent 
between 1999 and 2004, and school 
dropout went down by 42 percent. 
Overall, 75 percent of all primary 
school girls get some financial aid. 
In addition, the government provides 
hostel accommodation for 400 girls 
who would otherwise live too far 
from school. 
The scholarship amounts vary, 
depending on the grade and loca- 
tion. They range between 450 and 
1400 rupees per year, 
and are intended to 
cover uniform and 
stationary expenses, 
and possibly tuition 
the 
children seldom get 
fees. However, 
the amount they are 
entitled to. 
A system 
yet to be 
perfected 
The major problem of 
the scholarship pro- 
that 
schools do not gather 
gramme is 
the students’ infor- 
mation on time. By 
the time they receive 
the 
money, the number of 
scholarship 
registered students 
In Masta 
Baidhyanath Primary School in 
may have changed. 
Dadheldhura, for example, the 
number of registered students sud- 
denly increased from 25 to 31. “We 
decided to divide the amount among 
all 31 students,” says the school 
headmaster Durga Upreti.

Another problem is that the scholar- 
ship money is disbursed only at the 
end of the session. “How can they 
buy their uniform and stationeries if 
they get the money at the end of 
academic year?” Shrestha says. 
“Those who do not visit the district 
education office and wrangle over 
the money get nothing.” 
A most valuable aid to students is 
free textbooks. All girls in primary 
school can get their textbooks for 
free, but the government has not 
been able to deliver them to all the 
districts. This year, only 14 districts 
out of 75 received at least 80 percent 
of their load. 
“It is not possible with the govern- 
ment programme alone, we are also 
getting help from local trusts and 
organizations,” Shrestha says. 
Those difficulties don't make it easy 
for all to attend school on a regular 
basis. At Beg Lal Primary School in 
the Morang district, where the major- 
ity of students are Dalits, the drop- 
out rate is on the rise. “The amount 
of scholarship offered was too little 
to attract them,” says school teacher 
Krishna Hari Ghimire. u

### 179484: Illiteracy: impossible to hide

ILLITERACY: IMPOSSIBLE TO HIDE 
According to the latest UNESCO global report on education, more and more people know 
how to read and write, but 776 million adults are still illiterate. This phenomenon affects 
industrialized countries, where a minority of the population faces daily difficulties. 
Luc Cédelle, 
French journalist at the newspaper Le Monde 
omeone in the street, on public 
See or in a shopping centre, 
asks for directions, although every- 
thing is clearly indicated on signs. 
He or she seems absent-minded, very 
tired, or exasperated by contradic- 
tory information. Sometimes those 
asked for information think nothing 
of it. Other times, they understand: 
this person does not know how to 
read, and is making an incredible 
effort to hide it. 
Talking 
about illiteracy 
Terminology varies. In 1958, UNESCO 
declared that an illiterate person was 
someone who could not “both read 
and write a short simple statement 
on his [or her] everyday life”. Twenty 
years later, UNESCO introduced the 
more refined concept of “functional” 
illiteracy, designating the inability 
to “read, write and calculate for his 
or her own and the community's 
development”. Up to the 1980s, 
industrialized countries believed that 
they had eradicated the phenome- 
non. It was thought only migrants 
who had come from countries with- 
out compulsory schooling lacked 
mastery of the written word. This 
was an illusion, which technical 
progress has helped to dispel. 
The growing scarcity of purely 
“manual” activities has revealed that 
a minority of the populations of

Ravassard 
developed countries lack basic writ- 
ten communication skills. There then 
emerged in France the new word «ill- 
etrisme» (illiteracy), as opposed to 
formerly used “analphabetisme” 
(analphabetism), the idea being to 
distinguish between “analphabetic”, 
having never been to school, and 
“illiterate”, having learnt badly or 
forgotten everything. But many 
national and international institu- 
tions sometimes used one term and 
sometimes the other. The two cate- 
gories were inevitably mixed up, as 
some people had received little 
schooling, whereas others had 
acquired knowledge elsewhere than 
at school. Finally, there are many 
different levels between a complete 
lack of proficiency in basic skills and 
total proficiency. Writing a simple 
message phonetically or working out 
what a sign means are significant 
skills compared to total ignorance. 
For this reason, measuring illiteracy 
and comparisons between countries 
are difficult, as results vary 
enormously according to the criteria 
used. 
The paradox 
of rich countries 
In its 2009 Education for All Global 
Monitoring Report, UNESCO considers 
that the world literacy rate for adults 
has risen, increasing from 76% in the 
period 1985-1994 to 84% in 
2000-2006. However, 776 million 
adults still lack minimum literacy 
skills. And this figure does not only 
concern poor countries. Despite offi- 
cial statistics that “generally under- 
estimate” the phenomenon, by 
announcing, for example, a literacy 
rate of 99% in North America and in 
Europe, there are still pockets of 
illiteracy and of low literacy in devel- 
oped countries. 
The International Adult Literacy 
Skills Survey (IALSS), carried out 
from 1994 to 1998 coe

### 179484: Illiteracy: impossible to hide

e o o by the OECD and published in 
2000, defined a scale of proficiency 
from 1 to 5, which was later used in 
other surveys. Level 1 designated the 
weakest skills and level 2 the ability 
to “get by” despite insufficient pro- 
ficiency. But this survey sparked a 
controversy. While developed coun- 
tries consider that 10% of their pop- 
ulations have serious difficulties 
with writing, this survey gave much 
higher figures, putting 45 % of the 
population of Great Britain and 40 % 
of the population of Germany at 
levels 1 and 2. France, which was 
also rated at 40%, withdrew from the 
survey. 
In France, the subsequent use by the 
Agence nationale de lutte contre 
lillettrisme (ANLCI) (National agency 
to combat illiteracy) of a survey 
about “information and daily life”, 
carried out in 2004-2005 by l'Institut 
national de la statistique et des études 
économiques (INSEE) (National insti- 
tute for statistics and economic 
studies) estimated, but with differ- 
ent criteria, that 9% of the popula- 
tion aged 18 to 65 who had studied 
in the country were illiterate. 
However, for 15 to 18-year olds, the 
rate is much lower: only 4.5%. 
The IALSS survey was controversial, 
yet it had the positive effect of 
encouraging the countries concerned 
to implement plans to fight illiteracy 
and ask serious questions about the 
efficiency of their educational sys- 
tems, which are now measured by the 
PISA surveys (Programme for interna- 
tional student assessment), published 
every three years by the OECD since 
the year 2000. On the other hand, 
IALSS was not followed up. The OECD

Assessment of Adult Competencies

the lack of a common measurement 
tool, but its first assessments are not 
expected before 2011. 
Netherlands: 
Reversing the trend 
In 1994, another international adult 
literacy survey, (IALS), carried out in 
Canada, the United States, the 
Netherlands, 
Poland, Sweden and Switzerland, 
Ireland, Germany, 
already showed the complexity of the 
measurement criteria. On a scale of 1 
to 5, it measured three categories of 
skills: understanding prose, “docu- 
ments” and texts with quantitative 
information. In these three catego- 
ries, 10% of the Dutch population 
was no higher than level 1.

million Dutch people are at the 
lowest level of this scale, 1 million 
of whom were born and educated in 
the country. According to a survey 
by the foundation, a quarter of 
these are almost totally illiterate. 
Furthermore, 6% of salaried workers 
have major difficulties in reading 
and writing. 
“Illiteracy”, declared Princess 
Laurentien during a UNESCO regional 
conference in Baku (Azerbaijan) in 
May 2008, “is often linked to major 
personal problems - low self- 
esteem, social isolation and an ina- 
bility to function independently”. 
She concluded: “There is no silver 
bullet in eradicating illiteracy. We 
must work together to raise aware- 
ness, implement practical initia- 
tives and measure actual results”. 
All concerned countries are at this 
juncture today. u

### 179481: Education: the other global emergency

continued from page 4 
e eo o France allocates only 12% of 
its total development assistance in 
this area and Germany just 7%. 
Multilateral aid frameworks for sup- 
porting Education for All, such as the 
EFA Fast Track Initiative, are also 
failing to meet expectations. 
Inadequate donor support means 
that countries with approved plans 
will face an FTI shortfall of US$2.2 
billion by 2010. 
The circumstances into which chil- 
dren are born, their gender, the 
wealth of their parents, their lan- 
guage or the colour of their skin 
should no longer define their educa- 
tional opportunities and ending 
inequality’s “lottery by birth” is per- 
haps one the greatest global chal- 
lenges of the 21st century. The 
challenge is one that concerns all 
nations, since in a globalized world 
poverty and suffering do not remain 
confined within borders, but spill 
over in the form of conflict for 
scarce resources, mass migration 
and environmental degradation. 
The response to the financial crisis 
demonstrates what governments can 
accomplish when faced with 
“extraordinary times”. But if they 
carry on failing to tackle deep and 
persistent inequalities in education, 
targets set by the international 
community will be missed - in some 
cases by spectacular margins. Most 
importantly, millions of children 
around the world will continue to be 
consigned to lives of poverty and 
diminished opportunity. u
