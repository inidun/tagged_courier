It has often been said that Japan ,unlike 
Bo United States, is not a country of 
immigrants, and that for all practical 
purposes it has a single religion and a single 
language. What’s more, since their country 
emerged from isolation in the Meiji Period! 
the Japanese have had one overwhelming 
national aim: modernization. T he profound 
desire for modernization worked like a cen- 
tripetal force on the people to bring them 
all into a single close circle of stability. Today, 
that circle is disintegrating. The moderni- 
zation of Japan ended in the 1970s. That 
was when the great national aim that had 
existed since the Meiji period ceased to exist 
and as a result the nation’s centripetal force 
petered out. In every field, the communi- 
ty’s standards, the way things were done and 
even communicated were called in ques- 
tion. For previous generations of Japanese 
youth, it was enough just to become part of 
any highly ranked sector of the Japanese 
community. Entry into highly selective uni- 
versities, major industries and powerful 
bureaucracies brought with it the promise 
of a stable life. 
Today, in a Japan fully conscious that 
modernization is over and that we have 
caught up with the West, we turn to our 
youth and ask them not for the devotion that 
served us so well in the past but for fully

1912), emperor of Japan from 1867 to 1912. 
During his reign Japan began a rapid process of 
Westernization, industrialization and expansion in 
foreign affairs.

the necessary training. Whether this per-

to be what makes or breaks Japan in the

The great number of young people who

time as slaves to commercialism or fall 
under the sway of some charismatic fashion. 
The problem is that society has not made it 
clear enough to them that to lead a full life 
they now need specialized skills. So many 
elementary schoolchildren are still locked 
into gruelling exam preparation schedules, 
but no one is encouraging them to think 
about what sort of training they are heading 
for or how best to prepare for the future. I 
think this is unfair.

UNPREDICTABLE CHILD 
 
he prolific novelist, essayist and film-maker 
Ryu Murakami is a leading figure in the new 
wave of Japanese literature that emerged in the late 
1970s and the 1980s. He was born in 1952 in Sasebo, 
a city dominated by the nearby U.S. Navy base, and 
the experience of growing up in the shadow of the 
base underlies his views of America and Japan 
and formsa major theme of his writing. Described 
by another young Japanese novelist, Masahiko 
Shimada, as “Japanese literature’s unpredictable 
child”, he made a sensational debut as anovelist in 
1976 with the semi-autobiographical Almost Trans- 
parent Blue, a best-seller which portrayed the lives   
of young people immersed in a culture of sex, 
drugs and rock n’ roll. Notable among his many 
other novels, which have been widely translated, is 
the award-winning Coin Locker Babies (1981), the 
story of two infants abandoned by their mothersin 
train station lockers. The ambivalence of his fasci- 
nation with Western, and particular American, 
popular culture can be seen in 69 (1987), setin the 
midst of Japan’s 1969 student unrest, and also in his 
collection of essays American Dream (1985). Mura- 
kami has directed film adaptations of some of his 
novels. In 1997, Time magazine named him one of 
11 people who would revolutionize Japan. [|   
prising that we so often hear them saying 
that they don’t know what to do next. 
Today, so many Japanese have lost confi- 
dence in themselves that the young have 
become contaminated with it. T his is unfor- 
tunate. At the same time, many consider 
that the Japanese tradition of indirectness 
in communication is no longer functional. 
This is not so unfortunate. 
From now on, Japanese youth will be 
divided between the few who succeed and 
the many who fail. For the large number 
who are bound to fail, the future is uncer- 
tain. To forget this uncertainty, they delude 
themselves with video games, music, 
fashion,Hollywood,sex, drugs or cults. If 
we leave them as they are, they will even- 
tually seek revenge against a society which 
did not give them clear advice when it was 
needed. Unemployment amongst Japane- 
se youth has gone over the 10 per cent mark, 
but no adults here, politicians included, 
seem to be worried. u

THE KNOWLEDGE DIVIDE 
RV

Francisco Sagasti 
  
A former chief of strategic 
planning and senior adviser 
at the World 
Bank, Mr Sagasti is director 
of the Agenda Peru 
programme at FORO 
Nacional/ Internacional, 
an institution which 
promotes democratic 
governance and fosters 
dialogue and consensus on 
development issues. He isthe 
author of over 20 published 
works, the most recent of 
which is Development 
Cooperation 
in a Fractured Global Order 
(with Gonzalo Alcalde, IDRC, 
1999). The present text has 
been extracted from his 
contribution to a series of 
“21st Century Talks” held at 
UNesoo Headquarters in Paris, 
on November 6, 1999. 
      
Globalization looks very different when it is seen, not from the capitals of the West, but 
from the cities and villages of the South, where most of humanity lives. Four examples 
taken from my own country, Peru, illustrate how the paradoxical forces shaping glo- 
balization look when seen from the other side. 
In October 1999,28 schoolchildren died in Taucamarca,a remote village in the high- 
lands of Peru, after drinking water and powdered milk mixed in a vat that had contained 
a powerful insecticide. Nobody could read the label on the vat and the children were 
poisoned. The insecticide in question has been banned in practically every industrialized 
nation;its sale continues only in places like my country. 
Secondly, an important annual event recently took place in Cajamarca, in the north 
of Peru. Potato growers gather there to exchange the best seeds they have produced in the 
last year. It is an act of pride for communities to share with others seeds that will help 
improve the production of potatoes. In 1999, transnational corporations attended the fes- 
tival and are now working to patent the genes of these traditionnal foodstuffs in order to 
sell them at profit. 
Peru’s macro-economic indicators are excellent. In the offices of investment ban- 
kers, you will be told that Peru is a great investment opportunity. The situation is not so 
rosy however, when considered from the perspective of Peruvians. Fifty per cent of the 
population have been living below the poverty line for the last ten years. Twenty per cent 
of the population are living below the critical poverty line: their income is insufficient to 
pay for even minimal nourishment. Two-thirds of the workforce is unemployed or under- 
employed,and between now and 2005, more people will enter the labour market in Peru 
than in the whole of the European Union. 
A distinguished North American political scientist, Dr. Benjamin Barber, recently 
pointed out that in the United States democracy had degenerated into bringing one group 
of rascals in for four years,and then throwing them out and replacing them with another 
group of rascals for four years. From the perspective of the South, that looks very good! 
In a context where rascals manipulate elections and stay in power for fifteen or sixteen 
years,I would appreciate the chance to throw them out through peaceful elections every 
four years. 
Thus, the complaints of the North are often the aspirations of the South. Progress in indus- 
trialized nations can be a threat to developing countries. 
Ten years ago, in the euphoria of globalization and the expansion of services and finan- 
ce that followed the fall of the Berlin Wall, I advanced the idea that we were entering a frac- 
tured global order. Globalization brings us into contact with one another, but it also streng- 
thens profound divisions and fractures in terms of societies and income, and most 
importantly in our capacity to generate and utilize knowledge.O ver the last ten years,the 
concentration of wealth and power has greatly increased both within and between socie- 
ties. 
There is a real risk of two civilizations emerging, with two ways of viewing and relating 
to the world:one based on the capacity to generate and utilize knowledge;the other pas- 
sively receiving knowledge from abroad and deprived of the ability to modify it. 
T he world now faces the prospect of this Knowledge Divide becoming an unbridgeable 
abyss. We need the international community to return to the basic principles of interna- 
tional co-operation and introduce the idea that a minimum level of science and techno- 
logical capability, including access to the Internet, is an absolute necessity for develo- 
ping countries and should be the subject of international solidarity. 
T his can be achieved. However, contrary to the situation of 20 years ago, national 
governments are no longer the major players in the game of science and technology. Whe- 
ther we like it or not, the private sector and the international community of scholars must 
be invited to the table with governments from the North and South to begin discussing 
an agenda for the mobilization of science and technology for development. UNESCO, the 
only United Nations agency with a mandate for the development of the sciences, has a spe- 
cial role to play in the revitalization of international co-operation in this field. u

### 118491: The Aral Sea: back from the brink?

THE ARAL SEA: 
BACK FROM THE BRINK? 
 
+ Sue Lloyd-Roberts and Ethirajan Anbarasan 
An ecological disaster area, the shrinking Aral Sea generated a flood of assessment studies but 
little follow-up. Humanitarian action is now an urgent priority. 
“The health of women of child- 
bearing age is steadily deteriorating 
because of the bad quality of the drin- 
king water. There are as many pregnancies 
as ever but the women either miscarry or 
give birth to stillborn or handicapped 
babies. We have one of the highest infant 
mortality rates in the world,” says the direc- 
tor of the maternity hospital on the edge of 
the Aral Sea in the port city of Aralsk, in 
Kazakhstan. 
Behind him, pregnant women lie on 
rows of hospital beds. They have been 
brought in to ensure that they get clean 
food and water for at least the last trimester 
of their pregnancies. The eyes of one woman 
betray terror. “This is my ninth pregnancy,” 
she says, “I have yet to give birth to a live 
child and I am frightened.” Similar situa- 
tions exist elsewhere in this Central Asian 
region. 
Man-made 
environmental disasters 
The worsening health and environ- 
mental problems of people living in the 
Aral Sea basin, which consists of parts of 
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turk- 
menistan and Uzbekistan, are the direct 
consequences of man-made environmental 
disasters in the region—the shrinking of 
the sea and pollution of the rivers which 
flow into it. 
Experts say the disaster has left behind 
a 36,000-sq.km sea bed covered with accu- 
mulated salts, which the wind carries away 
and deposits over thousands of square kilo- 
metres of cultivated land. Pesticides and 
fertilizers have also found their way into 
water and irrigation channels, poisoning 
food and drinking water affecting the lives 
of about five million people. 
After the collapse of the Soviet Union 
in 1991, international donor agencies 
rushed to the Central Asian region to 
assess the environmental impact of the 
shrinking of the Aral Sea and to find ways 
* Correspondent with the BBC, London, 
and Unesco Courier journalist respectively.

of restoring it to its original level. Now, 
almost a decade later, after countless stu- 
dies and reports have been written,experts 
say that restoration is impossible and 
efforts should now focus on avoiding a 
humanitarian catastrophe. 
Rescue missions 
The Aral Sea,covering an area the size 
of Lithuania, started receding in the 
1960s after Soviet state planners diverted 
its water sources,the Amu Dar’ya and the 
Syr Dar’ya rivers, to irrigate cotton and 
other crops. 
From 1960 to 1990, the area of irriga- 
ted land in Central Asia increased from 3.5 
million hectares to 7.5 million. Cotton pro- 
duction soared, making the region the 
world’s fourth largest producer. But by the 
1980s the annual flow of fresh water into 
the Aral was barely one-tenth of the 1950 
supply. The salinity level increased, des- 
troying the sea’s flora and fauna. The 
  
fishing industry suffered; all but two of the 
30 species once found in the sea died out. 
With no other means of water supply, 
the sea started to recede, eventually losing 
half of its former area and a third of its 
volume. In 1989, it divided into a smaller 
northern sea and a larger southern one. 
The two main fishing ports, Moynaq in 
Uzbekistan and Aralsk in Kazakhstan 
were left high and dry, and fishing com- 
munities found themselves 100 kilo- 
metres or more away from the shore. 
Today, drinking water in the region 
contains four times more salt per litre 
than the limit recommended by theWorld 
Health Organization. This has caused 
increases in kidney disease, diarrhoea and 
other serious ailments. Tuberculosis has 
reached epidemic proportions. In some 
towns there are an estimated 400 cases 
out of a population of 100,000.

have been calling for help since Soviet times, 
but after their countries became indepen - 
dent at the end of 1991 their cries became 
more urgent than ever. International agen- 
cies including the World Bank,the United 
Nations Development Programme 
(UNDP),Unesco, and the European Union 
rushed to the region to offer help. Initiatives 
like the Aral Sea Basin Programme (ASBP), 
the International Aral Sea Rehabilitation 
Fund (IFAS),and the Interstate Commis- 
sion for Water Co-ordination (ICWC) were 
launched to assess the problems and find 
solutions. The activities they proposed 
brought high hopes to the people of the 
Aral Basin, who thought their problems 
would eventually be solved. 
So why after nearly a decade of rescue 
missions does the Aral Sea remain on the 
critical list of world environmental cata- 
strophes? According to experts, it is a classic 
case of too many players entering too late, 
with too few resources but in many cases 
with a huge stock of vested interests that 
are not necessarily consistent with 
environmental protection. 
The international aid agencies soon 
gauged the enormity of the problem and 
realized that the funds allotted were not 
enough to rectify a disaster of this magnitude. 
“Of course people here have been disap- 
pointed by the international community,” 
says Antonius Lennarts of the World Bank, 
in Almaty (Kazakhstan). “There have been 
lots of donor activity and promises but no

huge funds involved. The money available 
to solve a problem of this magnitude simply 
isn’t available.” 
In view of the gravity of the situation,

Drinking water

more salt per litre than 
the limit recommended 
by the World Health 
Organization 
nization Médicins Sans Frontieres (MSF), 
which is more usually associated with the 
world’s hot spots, has launched an emer- 
gency programme to save the people of Cen- 
tral Asia from what it calls in arecent report, 
“possibly the world’s greatest environmental 
disaster and human tragedy.” 
“To date,” the MSF report says, “millions 
of dollars worth of assessments have been 
made of the Aral Sea region, resulting in very 
little direct humanitarian action in the area.” 
MSF has some justification for lamenting 
that so much has been spent in the last eight 
years on talking about the Aral Sea and so 
little has actually been done. But why has this 
happened ?““It could be because the problem 
1s just so huge and everyone wants to help but 
many agencies just don’t know where to 
start,” explains Barbara Britton of the United 
States Agency for International Develop- 
ment (USAID), the biggest donor agency 
involved, in Tashkent. 
There is another major hurdle as well as 
lack of funds—TIack of co-ordination among 
the five Aral basin nations. “They started 
competing with each other to get interna- 
tional aid rather than co-operating in solving 
the problem,” says Professor J. A. Allan, a 
water resources specialist at the University 
of London. 
In the absence of the kind of federal 
authority that existed in Soviet times, the 
five states set up the International Aral Sea 
Rehabilitation Fund (IFAS) in 1993 in 
order to co-ordinate water and agricultural 
projects. In 1995, their leaders attended a 
UN-sponsored meeting in Nukus (Uzbe- 
kistan), which concluded with a resoun- 
ding declaration saying they would co-ope- 
rate to resolve the human and 
environmental consequences of the Aral 
Sea crisis. But, according to Britton,distrust »

The Aral Sea region has one of the world’s highest rates of or or re ala 
between the states continued. 
For example, when the Uzbekis were 
given the responsibility for water manage- 
ment, they were accused of producing a 
programme that would irrigate Uzbekistan 
and not other countries. Then the U zbekis 
accused Kazakhstan of draining water away 
from its southern neighbour by constructing 
a dam across the northern Aral Sea. 
Anatoly Buranov, technical director of 
the Executive Committee of IFAS,admits 
that the states could have done better. “Part 
of the problem is that we were all excited by 
independence and after so many years of 
enforced togetherness we enjoyed the cen- 
trifugal forces which the collapse of the 
Soviet Union allowed us. Now, however, 
we are realizing the importance of co- 
operation.” 
Ironically, the slow and delayed action 
from outsiders and their governments has 
had a positive effect on one Aral basin 
country. Frustrated by years of unfulfilled 
promises, the people of Kazakhstan raised 
an astonishing $2.5 million and built them- 
selves a sand dam 14 kilometres long and 30 
metres wide, creating a lake in the northern 
Aral Sea,close to Aralsk. 
Kazakh officials say they also made 
efforts to draw less water from the Syr 
Dar’ya than in the past and that the dam 
1 2 The Unesco Courier - January 2000 
contained the increased inflow into the 
smaller,northern Aral. As a result, the water 
level rose by three metres for the first time 
in 30 years, bringing back greenery and 
birdlife to the desertified area. 
As a result of increased inflow of fresh 
water the salinity level in the northern Aral 
fell, reviving the hopes of the fishing

industry. Above all,the dam brought hope 
to the people of Aralsk, “a commodity 
which until recently has been as scarce 
around here as water,” says Aitbai Kuser- 
baliv, the city’s mayor. 
Unfortunately, Kuserbaliv explains, the 
dam keeps breaking as a result of rainfall 
and increased inflow into the sea.In 1998, 
from three to five kilometres of the dam 
were washed away and water flowed into the 
southern Aral. Officials say the project 
cannot be sustained unless they get $15 
million funding they have asked from the 
World Bank to build a permanent structure. 
“I wrote to them several months ago and 
they still have not got back to me,” says the 
mayor. 
With the survival of the reclaimed sea, 
the efforts of dozens of dam builders and 
the livelihoods of several hundred fishermen 
at stake, the World Bank seems likely to 
come up with some funds. “We have agreed 
that it is a highly necessary dam and the 
money will be forthcoming,” says Antonius 
Lennarts of the World Bank. 
Even if the World Bank funds this pro- 
ject it will save only the smaller part of the 
Aral Sea. To maintain the present water 
level of the bigger southern part, at least 20 
cubic kilometres of water per year are 
required. Some grandiose schemes have 
been proposed,including diverting waters 
from Siberian rivers or from the Caspian 
Sea, over 2,400 km and 500 km away res- 
pectively, projects which could cost up to $8 
billion each. The Central Asian countries do 
not have the resources to embark on such 
costly undertakings. 
Another option would be to allow more 
water to flow into the Amu Dar’ya river, 
which means that agricultural patterns in

the region, especially in Uzbekistan, through 
which most of the river flows, would need 
to be changed. This proposal could invite 
stiff resistance from farmers in Uzbekistan 
who heavily depend on the river for irriga- 
tion. “It is a very uneasy situation for them. 
You cannot stop agriculture. People would 
lose their livelihood,” says Prof Janos 
Bogardi, senior water resources expert at 
UNESCO. 
The first priority: 
saving people’s lives 
There is no doubt that it would take 
billions of dollars and decades to change the 
agricultural pattern by introducing new 
technology and less water consuming 
plants. It is highly unlikely that Uzbekistan, 
the second largest cotton exporter in the 
world, would agree to shift from its prime 
cash crop. 
With the prospects of saving the sea 
remote, experts and locals now seem to be 
turning their attention to relieving the social 
disaster. If present conditions persist,then 
the southern part of the Aral is likely to 
disappear in the next 25 years. T he priority 
should be saving the lives of the people, 
says Vefa Moustafaev, a UNESCO water 
resources expert. 
After a decade of research and assess- 
ment reports, the international agencies 
have now started implementing some of 
their projects to help the Aral basin popu- 
lation, mainly by providing clean drinking 
water and better health care facilities. The

World Bank has financed a project to esta- 
blish 25 stations to monitor drinking water 
quality across the Central Asian region. 
The Bank also plans to fund projects to 
improve agricultural practices which 
consume a lot of fresh water. 
Experts say that the region may require 
an estimated $20 billion for much-needed 
development and environmental activities, 
mainly to modernize agriculture, to reduce 
river pollution and provide clean drinking 
water. At present, the cash-strapped Central 
Asian countries are in no position to raise 
such funds on their own. 
But the region is not without hope as far 
as its natural resources are concerned. With 
their enormous gas and oil reserves the 
Central Asian states would be among the 
major players in the global power sector in 
the coming years. However, it is far from 
clear what the consequences of oil and gas 
exploitation would be for the Aral Sea. 
“There is still lots of hope in the region. 
But the countries need to co-ordinate their 
efforts,” says Bogardi. []

UNRULY CLASSROOMS 
  
+ Lucia Iglesias Kuntz 
Teachers are not getting enough training and back-up to help them with worsening 
behaviour in schools 
Merlo, Argentina: “A 13-year-old woun- 
ded by a bullet at school.” Springfield, 
United States: “One dead and 30 woun- 
ded in a shooting.” Kobe, Japan: “A school- 
child decapitated by a 14-year-old.” 
In the past few years, killings,physical 
attacks, robberies, attempted arson and 
fights between children that end in tragedy 
have become headline news. With the appea- 
rance of security guards, police checks and 
metal detectors, the most “difficult” schools 
have turned into armed camps before the 
incredulous eyes of the public and burned 
out teachers. 
But school violence is not just a problem 
ofknives, baseball bats and marijuana in the 
classroom.D ay after day primary and secon-

dary school teachers in both private and state 
sectors are being confronted with examples 
of bad behaviour—the destruction of school 
equipment or furniture,pupils’ lack of res- 
pect for each other or for adults—which 
impede normal school routine. 
Bernard Charlot, professor of education 
at the University of St. Denis, near Paris, 
says there are four kinds of misbehaviour. 
First, real violence, involving “physical 
attacks or serious injury, which would be 
punished in a court of law.” Then there is 
unruliness, “a disrespect for school rules,” 
and rudeness, “breaches of good manners, 
like slamming a door in the face of a teacher 
or fellow pupil.” The fourth kind of indis- 
cipline—just as serious, he says—is “some- 
times ostentatious indifference by pupils 
which is increasingly stressful for teachers.” 
Charlot cites the cases of pupils who say 
they ought not to be punished for absen- 
teeism because “since they aren’t there they 
don’t do anybody any harm” or those who 
sit right at the back of the classroom doing 
what they like and when asked to take part 
in the lesson say “But sir, we aren’t bothe- 
ring you.” 
Visiting a school staff room and asking 
the teachers about their pupils means lis- 
tening to a litany of complaints about dis- 
respect, insults and vandalism and realizing 
what little back-up teachers have to help 
them keep order. 
Paloma Garrido, who teaches transla- 
tion at a private university in Madrid, lists 
disciplinary problems such as unpunctuali- 
ty, yawning, mobile phones that ring in class 
and “an insolent attitude towards the tea- 
Discipline, order and commitment are values that Glenwood School in Illinois (USA) seeks to inculcate in its pupils, many of whom come 
from troubled backgrounds. Below, 14 boys being punished in a corridor.

cher. Because I'm young, they think they can 
treat me like one of their pals,” says 31 -year- 
old Garrido, who has seven years’experience 
teaching children between 14 and 20. She 
says the teacher must set the rules from the 
very first day and “know how to keep a dis- 
tance so they know you're the teacher and 
not just a chum.” 
In Mexico or Italy, in Germany or India, 
teacher training, when it exists, focuses on 
the curriculum. No one says that lessons will 
be given to classes which are often too big 
and comprise pupils who, as in Spain for 
example, may witness during the school year 
an average of 8,000 crimes and 200,000 acts 
of violence on television. 
But Alfredo Furldn, an Argentine edu- 
cationist,says that “although the subjects of 
discipline and indiscipline are very rarely if 
ever tackled during teacher training, trainee 
teachers soon learn their strategic impor- 
tance. Keeping order in the classroom is the 
first professional skill they will have to 
demonstrate because if they don’t,conflicts 
immediately arise which have worse conse- 
quences than failing to get good academic 
results from their pupils.” 
The causes of bad behaviour are extre- 
mely diverse. Some studies make a distinc- 
tion between “structural” factors such as the 
inevitable conflicts between teenagers and 
adults who try to educate them and factors 
that are more specific to the age we live in. 
Gustavo Calotti, who teaches languages 
at a secondary school in Mayotte in the 
Comoros Islands and has 15 years’teaching 
experience, says today’s schoolchildren 
are “much more badly-behaved” than their 
predecessors 10 or 15 years ago. He thinks 
one reason is that “young people look at 
the adult world and see what’s in store for 
them when they leave school—a strong pos- 
sibility being that they either won't find a 
job or else end up in one that is badly paid. 
They gradually lose the desire to make an 
effort or feel the satisfaction of completing 
a job of work. Add to that the widespread 
belief that only those with a winner’s 
mentality will make it and you get a kind 
“Although the subjects 
of discipline and indiscipline 
are very rarely if ever tackled 
during teacher training, trainee 
teachers soon learn their 
strategic importance. Keeping 
order in the classroom is 
the first professional skill they 
will have to demonstrate.” 
of don’t-care atttitude, an apathy which is 
reflected in their behaviour.” 
UNESsco education specialist Alexandra 
Draxler does not see bad behaviour as a 
plague or isolated phenomenon but as “a by- 
product of the tremendous advance in indi- 
vidual rights and the broad democratization 
of public life over the last 25 to 30 years.” 
Before that, she says, “social problems stop- 
ped at the school gates. T he situation was 
sorted out beforehand: violent pupils just 
   WORLD OF LEARNING 
weren't allowed in or were expelled, and 
classrooms were quiet because the discipli- 
ne was strict enough to ensure that pupils 
didn’t break the rules.” 
Charlot admits that “these days you're 
getting children in school whose parents or 
elder siblings have had no secondary edu- 
cation, and the moment the school system 
starts taking in a new category of children, 
some of the unspoken rules don’t work any 
more. Pupils don’t turn up with the ‘pre- 
socialization’ they used to get and this shows 
up in their behaviour.” 
A social microcosm 
A school is not like a lone soap bubble 
separate from society, but a place where 
social problems are seen in a microcosm— 
problems like lack of communication, pover- 
ty, marginalization, intolerance and loss of 
values. All of them lead to what Antonio 
Garcia Correa, professor of educational psy- 
chology at the University of Murcia, in 
Spain, calls “emotional illiteracy”. Edu- 
cational systems, he says, “have been more 
concerned about filling heads with know- 
ledge rather than teaching children to think 
and reason. A lot of research has been done 
on children’s academic results and how to 
improve them, but we have been less 
concerned about their social and emotional 
development. The result is that pupils know 
more but behave worse.” 
Changes in educational systems also 
have alot to do with children’s behaviour. 
“We've switched suddenly from a system 
based on prohibitions and punishment to 
one based on sharing where the most impor- »

perts, businesses and institutions in several 
untries have come up with ideas to help edu- 
cational authorities to deal with bad behaviour in 
schools. In southern Spain, schools can join the 
SAVE (Seville against school violence) project set 
up in 1996 by Rosario Ortega Ruiz of Seville Uni- 
versity’s department of educational and deve- 
lopmental psychology. The project seeks to pre- 
vent outbreaks of violence between children by 
creating a friendly school atmosphere and impro- 
ving interpersonal relations. 
Using questionnaires and other forms of 
consultation, a group of experts study a specific 
school situation and make a detailed report on it. 
If the teachers decide to join the project after rea- 
ding the report, SAVE experts build a support sys- 
tem for their work in the classroom and set up a 
task force to prevent violence. With European and 
Spanish funding, Ortega’s team has also produ- 
ced a teaching kit called “Stepping stones to friend- 
ly schools,” which hasbeen distributed in all state 
schools in Spain’s Andalusia province. 
In the U.S. state of Georgia, a law passed in   
April 1999 requires its 6,500 schools to “imple- 
ment a character education programme for all 
grade levels” asfrom the 2000-2001 school year. 
To help apply the law, the state education depart- 
ment recently set up a Character Education Cen- 
ter, which encourages children to develop quali- 
tiesincluding courage, patriotism, citizenship, 
honesty, fairness, respect for others, kindness, co- 
operation, self-respect, self-control, courtesy, com- 
passion, tolerance, diligence, generosity, punc- 
tuality, cleanliness and respect for the 
environment. 
Jason Wetzel, the center’s associate director, 
hopes “the Georgia model”, as it isnow becoming 
known in the national media, will “reduce vio- 
lence, increase academic performance and gene- 
rally create a better and more civil community.” 
In France, the Gaspar network (Academic 
Group for Support and Prevention for Problem 
Teenagers), set up by the education authoritiesin 
Lille in 1989, has so far been active in about 150 
schools in northern France. Its chief work is pre- 
vention, and one of its salient featuresisthe invol- 
vement of student volunteers alongside teachers 
and administrators. 
In Japan, the Education for Compassion (Koko- 
ro no kyoriku) programme, sponsored by the 
ministry of education, aims to revive civic values 
and a sense of responsibility among Japanese chil- 
dren, as well as defending and encouraging the 
spiritual and moral aspects of education. 
In a number of places, such work is being done 
further outside the mainstream, and special 
schools have been created for children with serious 
behavioural problems. Such schools are really 
places of last resort, though most experts disap- 
prove of this kind of segregation—nearly always 
temporary—of problem pupils. 
Ortega Ruiz thinks keeping problem children 
away from othersisnot a good idea because “free 
state education should deal with them in their 
social context and face up to the real-life problems. 
In the worst cases, where such children need spe- 
cial re-education, this can be done in their nor- 
mal surroundings, using whatever individual 
approaches are needed.” u

tant thing is agreement between everyone 
involved in the education system and we’ve 
not yet learned how to put that new system 
into practice,” says Nora Rais, who teaches 
literature in Patagonia, Argentina. She says 
that “returning to an authoritarian regime 
isn’t the way to fix the situation. Encour- 
aging dialogue, making compromises and 
adopting values is one possible way. Tea- 
chers must act as mediators, but we must 
have the resources to do that.” 
The parents’ role 
The schoolteacher is no longer someo- 
ne held up as an example to others, and edu- 
cation is no longer a guarantee of social 
advancement. But the school remains a vital 
institution, along with the family, for encou- 
raging and instilling human values in young 
people. Many professionals blame parents 
for not pulling their weight here by being 
often only interested in their children’s aca- 
demic results and getting them into the next 
school year. 
“Parents are spending less and less time 
on their children’s education,” says Calot- 
ti. “They think it’s enough to pack them off 
to school and they don’t make a distinction 
between the academic education we give 
children and their education as members of 
society, which has to begin at home.” 
But teachers are less and less alone in 
the face of danger. A glance at the educa- 
tional plans of several countries shows that 
tackling these problems is a priority in desi- 
gning policies for investigating, handling 
and preventing bad behaviour (see box). 
The responses are starting to appear on the 
horizon, although everyone agrees that the 
more resources a school has, the fewer pro- 
blems it will face. Boosting resources will 
allow more teachers to be hired, enable class 
sizes to be reduced, good administration to 
be established and the number of teaching 
aids and non-teaching staff to be increased, 
introducing key figures such as psycholo- 
gists and social workers into the school. 
An educational priority 
The one thing teachers increasingly 
agree on—and they, after all, are the people 
who work day after day in the classroom— 
is that the answer is not to punish or expel 
pupils or to send them to the head teacher’s 
office. Civil behaviour and sociability are 
not values that can be instilled overnight. 
They are the fruit of a daily effort by eve- 
ryone—the authorities, the educational 
community, the parents and of course the 
most important people, the children. The 
rounded academic and social education of 
future generations depends on recognizing 
this.” u 
"In the past few years fights between children that end in tragedy have become headline news.”

decided to voice the universal 
aspiration for peace, an end to war and 
to all kinds of violence spawned by injustice 
and oppression. On Unesco’s initiative it has 
proclaimed the year 2000 as the 
International Year for the Culture of Peace. 
This decision also salutes the 
participation of “civil society”. Today a host 
of individuals and movements are breaking 
down traditional political frameworks 
through their contributions to community 
life, in different ways and on different scales, 
on their own doorstep or at the planetary 
level. As French political scientist Zaki Laidi 
and Spanish sociologist Manuel Castells 
point out in this issue, they are either short- 
circuiting or joining forces with governments 
which have hitherto 
called the tune. 
Peace is in our hands. It is within reach of 
all of us, if we can show the spirit and 
perseverance of some of the people 
portrayed in this Focus section: a Chinese 
mother who opened her country’s first 
school for autistic children; a man who 
makes videos to combat violence in Bogota’s 
biggest shantytown; a scientist who has 
opened his laboratory 
to the slum-dwellers of Rio de Janeiro to 
help them build houses for themselves. 
On a wider stage, a number of 
movements inspired by these same humanist 
values have devised original methods of 
achieving their goals. Among them are the 
Jubilee 2000 campaign to cancel Third World 
debt and the Sant’Egidio Christian 
Community in Rome, which has acted as a 
mediator in several wars. 
Meanwhile, the struggle of Indian 
farmers against genetically modified 
organisms shows that a movement 
originating in civil society may 
be motivated by the best intentions without 
fully belonging to this culture of peace.

peace between nations and peace within socie- 
ties—has been exclusively based on the inter- 
play between justice and force, a relationship which 
is at once conflictual and consensual. 
Over 300 years ago, this idea was expressed by 
the French philosopher Blaise Pascal when he wrote: 
“Since force cannot be made to submit to justice, 
men have made it just to submit to force; and since 
justice cannot be fortified, we justify force so that 
justice and force go together and we have peace, 
which is the sovereign good.” 
History shows that peace has been and conti- 
nues to be primarily an affair of state and of states, 
based on the use of force—in other words,ultima- 
tely, on recourse to war. T his force is legitimized by 
highly diverse and in some cases contradictory 
concepts of justice. 
In our time, however, the nature of war has chan- 
ged. Most often it is no longer waged between states 
but within their borders. Conflicts within states have 
become so widespread that warfare has never been 
so rife—and in many cases so unnoticed—as it is 
today. Furthermore, violence exists in all our socie- 
ties in one form or another, even if it does not neces- 
sarily erupt into armed confrontation. It takes many 
forms, and may even be considered the norm. Its 
most glaring symptom is the growth of inequalities 
F- time immemorial,peace—in the sense of and the social exclusion to which this gives rise. 
Societies torn to the point of disintegration by civil 
war or violence are societies whose regulatory 
mechanisms—the bodies which exist to settle 
conflicts—are warped or paralyzed. 
Some might say that this gloomy analysis heralds 
a future in which war and violence will inevitably 
prevail. The fact is,however,that these three deve- 
lopments—the changing nature of war, the prolife- 
ration of different forms of violence and the wea- 
kening of mediatory mechanisms, a process 
accelerated by globalization and the information 
revolution—create a new arena in which a culture 
of peace can emerge. And the prime mover in this 
culture of peace will no longer be the state but the 
individual, in other words each and every one of us. 
For surely the road to peace must start within 
ourselves—in values,behaviour and attitudes which 
can foster a sense of community that is today threa- 
tened. Where else can the foundations of peace be 
built but in our daily lives, through willingness to 
listen and talk things through with others on equal 
terms within the framework of a caring society? 
The only obstacles to this enterprise are those 
we create ourselves, because of ignorance or fana- 
ticism or because of the selfishness that today we 
are all too often asked to regard as the hallmark of 
human identity. T his approach requires more than

### 118493: The Fabric of peace

Manifesto 2000 
International Year 2000: peace isin our hands 
A group of Nobel Peace Laureates have written Manifesto 2000, which is open to signature by people all over the 
world. The goal is to present 100 million signatures to the United Nations General Assembly in September 2000. The 
Manifesto’s full text is as follows: 
Recognizing my share of responsibility for the future of humanity, especially for the children of today and tomorrow, 
| pledge in my daily life, in my family, my work,my community, my country and my region,to: 
— respect the life and dignity of every person without discrimination or prejudice; 
— practice active non-violence, rejecting violence in all its forms: physical, sexual, psychological, economical and 
social,in particular towards the most deprived and vulnerable such as children and adolescents; 
— share my time and material resources in a spirit of generosity to put an end to exclusion, injustice and political and 
economic oppression; 
— defend freedom of expression and cultural diversity, giving preference always to dialogue and listening without 
engaging in fanaticism,defamation and the rejection of others; 
— promote consumer behaviour that is responsible and development practices that respect all forms of life and pre- 
serve the balance of nature on the planet; 
— contribute to the development of my community, with the full participation of women and respect for democratic 
principles, in order to create together new forms of solidarity. 
You can sign Manifesto 2000 on the Internet:www.unesco.org/manifesto2000,or send a signed copy to:International

good intentions or the occasional act of generosity. 
The capacity to talk and listen to others and be 
receptive to their needs can pave the way to peace 
through an acceptance of a shared responsibility 
towards other people as well as towards ourselves. 
The mainspring of the culture of peace is making 
common cause with others in peace-building pro- 
jects in everyday life, in whatever area of society we 
may be involved. 
A participatory process 
This message is not new. T he culture of peace 
is a fabric that has been woven for generations in all 
societies, though its practices are not necessarily 
denominated by that specific title. In some places 
it may be known as tolerance, non-violence or jus- 
tice. In others, as harmony, solidarity or conviviali- 
ty. All over the world it has its defenders, some wor- 
king in obscurity, others in the spotlight of public 
life. But its scope would be much smaller today had 
it not been given expression in the disinterested acts 
of thousands of anonymous men and women 
capable of listening to others, talking to them and 
acting with them and on their behalf. 
The concept of “a culture of peace”has clearly 
not appeared from nowhere. But to have a single 
expression to describe a multitude of ethical and 
practical initiatives may help to highlight their com- 
mon purpose, make them more widely known and 
bring them together. It may sharpen the impact and 
focus of movements that are active in a vast range 
of fields and settings. 
The importance of the culture of peace has now 
been recognized by the world community. On 
November 20, 1997, the General Assembly of the 
United Nations unanimously proclaimed the year 
2000 as the International Year for the Culture of 
Peace. In taking this step, UN Member States accept 
their own limitations and their urgent need for a 
concept of peace that will be a participatory process 
to which all members of society can contribute, 
no matter how humble their circumstances. 
The culture of peace is intended to be a rallying 
point that transcends the treaties and agreements 
that have so often been given short shrift by histo- 
ry. It will become a real and living culture if we take 
its tenets to heart and shape a common future in 
our words and deeds. 
UNEscO’s role as the seedbed of the culture of 
peace is inscribed in the opening words of its Consti- 
tution: “Since wars begin in the minds of men it is 
in the minds of men that the defences of peace must 
be constructed.” The text goes on to say “that a 
peace based exclusively upon the political and 
economic arrangements of governments would not 
be a peace which could secure the unanimous, 
lasting and sincere support of the peoples of the 
world, and that the peace must therefore be foun- 
ded, ifit is not to fail, upon the intellectual and moral 
solidarity of mankind.” 
One of the chief architects of UNEsco’s Consti- 
tution, the American poet Archibald MacLeish, used 
the following eloquent words when he addressed 
UNESco’s first General Conference in 1946:“The 
peace to which the Constitution refers... is a condi- 
tion of mutual confidence, 
harmony of purpose, and co-ordination of activi- 
ties in which free men and women can live a 
satisfactory life.” [| 
Each person can 
help build a culture of 
peace and 
non-violence by living 
in each moment, 
joyfully 
and thankfully in deep 
consciousness of the 
sacredness 
of our own lives, the 
lives of all beings, and 
creation.

Meaning in World Politics 
(Routledge, 1998). 
2 0 The Unesco Courier - January 2000 
There is a lot of talk about the weakening of the 
state’srole in national and international life. 
What exactly isthe situation? 
In the last twenty years or so, the state’s regulatory 
powers have declined. T his decline began in the eco- 
nomic field, with the 1973 world oil crisis in the rich 
countries, which noticed that their economies no 
longer automatically responded to kick-start mea- 
sures imposed from above. It was then that people 
saw how far the Keynesian model of economics had 
broken down. 
Three things happened in the 1980s to speed 
up this process. The first was ideological. It was asso- 
ciated with the advent of new governments in Bri- 
tain and the United States which were strongly 
opposed to state intervention. T hese governments 
further discredited the state’s role as a social and 
economic regulator. Secondly, in the mid-1980s, 
the deregulation of financial markets and the free 
movement of capital began. This was a major tur- 
ning point. Thirdly, the collapse of the Berlin Wall 
rubbished the ideology of socialism and socialist 
policies around the world. 
How have these changes been transmitted to the 
South? 
Mainly through the structural adjustment pro- 
grammes of the International Monetary Fund 
(IMF) and the World Bank, beginning in the 1980s. 
This process had mixed results, depending on the 
country involved. But the pressure of structural 
adjustment was very strong until the 1997-98 Asian 
economic crisis, when we saw the effects of exces- 
sively rapid and poorly-organized economic 
liberalization. 
Isthere a link between the reduction of govern- 
ment economic regulation and the emergence of 
civil society? 
Yes and no. There is no automatic relationship. In 
most countries of the South and the East where eco- 
nomic privatization has been put into effect, you 
can usually see that traditional elites have jumped 
on the bandwagon and taken control of the 
resources made available by privatization. This is 
why there is more talk about the privatization of the 
state rather than about the privatization of the eco- 
nomy. So we must avoid being overly simplistic. 
At the same time, the loss of confidence in the 
state, its diminishing redistributory functions and its 
increasing ineffectiveness have spurred the members 
of society to take action and to abandon their 
deference to the state. In human rights and the envi- 
ronment, for example, NGOs have triggered new 
initiatives that governments have been forced to act 
on. 
Fragments of a worldwide public awareness are 
now having their say. It’s impossible to hold a world 
conference about anything these days without 
involving NGOs, which are a kind of indicator of 
the democratization of world relations. 
Why is this? 
Because they encourage and facilitate the world’s 
pluralization.States have lost their monopoly of vio- 
lence and of authoritative declaration. We're seeing 
an extraordinary and far-reaching reconfiguration 
of power into three components—the state, the mar- 
ket and civil society. 
But beware. Here too we must avoid stereotypes 
and utopianism.T hese players are not necessarily 
opposed or in contradiction with each other. It is 
too abstract simply to say that “civil societies” are 
in process of taking power. Something far more 
complex is going on. T here is now a stronger and 
more complicated interaction between the three 
components of power I’ve been talking about. And 
they aren’t very equal components either. 
Also, we mustn’t forget that governments can 
be tempted to outsource their functions and get 
various groups or the private sector to take over res- 
ponsibilities they formerly assumed. You're not going 
to understand much about what’s happening if you 
look at it in terms of a zero-sum game. 
What role do you think civil society will play in 
the future? 
As I said, I think we're moving more and more 
towards a kind of tripartite politics, associating 
government, the private sector and social groups. 
But I don’t think the state’s retreat means the end 
of politics. That would be an enormous step back- 
wards which would bring us face to face with the 
nightmare of the 17th-century English philosopher 
Thomas Hobbes of a “war of every one against every 
one”. So the really important thing is to expand the 
frontiers of politics,to think about politics beyond 
the state. After all, everything of concern to the com- 
munity is politics. And what people call “the crisis 
of politics” varies in intensity from society to socie- 
ty. It’s always more noticeable in countries where 
there is only limited mediation by cultural and wor- 
kers’'movements between government and society. 
In these cases, when the state gets weaker, society 
feels weaker too. 
I want to stress one point. The state isn’t dead, 
far from it. Even in the developed world, public 
expenditure has risen as a percentage of gross

national product in every single country. This is 
because the solemn responsibilities of the state remain 
very great in the domains of social security, pensions 
and debt repayment. There are also growing demands 
on the state in several areas, including education.So 
the state isn’t dead, just a certain conception of it— 
one that makes refrigerators, for example. 
Even civil societies need an organized state in 
which to flourish, one anchored in the rule of law 
and capable of expressing various demands and 
concerns at an international level. The recent 
attempt in Seattle to launch a new round of world 
trade negotiations shows the tightly-knit relation- 
ship between governments and economic and social 
players. 
What’s the role of new information technology in 
the emergence of a worldwide civil society? 
A tremendous one, provided of course that you 
don’t look for oversimplistic explanations. It’s 
obvious that the Internet plays a decisive role in 
mobilizing people about the environment,human 
rights and trade. The speed at which information is 
exchanged greatly strengthens the building of cam- 
paign platforms. It undoubtedly takes less time to 
mobilize social groups than to mobilize states. But 
once again, there’s no innate conflict between the OTE ES 
two. One might think, for example, that the social = Demonstrating against child labour in Colombo

### 118495: The South's fragile states

The South’sfragile states 
Developing countries are still wrestling with the business of fashioning a nation-state and building structures which in 
the West grew and matured over several centuries into modern, integrated societies. These societies only became demo- 
cratic after going through an industrial revolution. 
Until the late 1980s, the construction of nation-states in the countries of the South was seriously hampered by colo- 
nization and then by the Cold War. Before independence, nothing wasdone to integrate the different peoples living insi- 
de artificially drawn frontiers In fact,the colonial powers conducted a policy of divide and rule. 
Then during the decades of East-West confrontation, heads of state only won power through their loyalty to one side 
or the other, not because they were good rulers. The great powers clearly played a hand in this by often backing dicta- 
tors at the expense of certain “ founding fathers of independence” who had better intentions towards their people. 
Today, a third generation of rulersis gradually taking the reins in the countries of the South, mostly asa result of more 
or less democratic elections. But when these leaders are called upon by their subjects, sometimes violently, to install real 
democracy and develop their countries, they more than ever lack the means to do so. 
Development aid has fallen by 20 per cent since the end of the Cold War. Interest payments on debt are an increasing 
burden on government finances. Structural adjustment programmes have eroded the legitimacy of the state by dis- 
mantling public services and widening the gap between the haves and the have-nots. The deterioration of the environ- 
ment, notably soil degradation (six million hectaresare lost every year) and deforestation (10 million hectares destroyed 
each year), is depleting vital resources already in short supply. Another destabilizing factor is that 60 per cent of the worl-

Amid the poverty and violence of a Bogota slum, Victor Manuel makes videos

uns,” says 20-year-old Victor Manuel. “First you 
have to survive the gangs. Then you spend a year 
in the army, hoping not to be sent to a combat zone. 
After that, if you want to raise a family, you get a job as 
a security guard for a firm or a block of flats. Or else you 
do dirty work for the militias or the drug lords.” 
Victor is one of thousands of dead-end kids who 
grow up on the dusty hillsides of Ciudad Bolivar, in the 
slums around the Colombian capital of Bogotd. Over 
the past 40 years, one and a half million people have 
poured into the area—a fifth of the city’s population. 
Victor decided to steer clear of guns. He didn’t want 
to be a security guard, a soldier,a smuggler or a gang- 
ster. He didn’t want to get into drugs either. “T aking 
drugs is a form of weakness,” he says. “It shows you 
can’t face up to life. It’s the same with violent crime.” 
Instead, Victor wants to make videos. 
His new home is Ciudad Bolivar’s Youth 
Leadership School, a rather pompously named asso- 
ciation which was created by and for needy young 
people and which operates from the basement of a four- 
storey building. Victor and his friends make big sacri- 
fices to pay the $100 monthly rent for these premises. 
With help from private universities and a foundation 
run by a Colombian businessman, they are trying to set 
up a community radio station and meanwhile produce 
videos about the lives of young people living in the 
slums. 
They believe communication is the only way to 
change the lives of future gang members—the groups 
of street youths who hang out in houses or on waste

sometimes plan petty crimes. 
The themes of the videos, which reflect life in 
Ciudad Bolivar, are worked out together. Victor’s 
first production, A Taste of Evil, tells the story of a 
family that fled from the countryside when they 
heard rumours of massacres. For the children of this 
family violence was just that—a rumour of some- 
thing that happened in the next village. T hen,when 
they got to Ciudad Bolivar, they encountered vio- 
lence on a daily basis, along with the lure of crime 
and drugs. 
During the making of the second video, Dreams 
and Dreamers, a gang member from the slum stole the

equipment the team had painstakingly 
assembled. The boys at the Leadership School were 
ready to revert to their old habits of gang fighting to 
get the material back. But it wasn’t necessary. The 
local people protested and the gang members retur- 
ned the equipment. “They didn’t realize it was as if 
they had stolen something of their own,” says Victor. 
The Leadership School’s goal is to change the 
attitudes of young delinquents. The filming, which 
involves about 50 youths, is a chance to establish 
a dialogue with the street kids. T he videos are shown 
in churches, schools, community centres and at local 
festivals with the aim of trying to influence groups 
of youths by using codes and symbols they are fami- 
liar with. 
But it isn’t easy to persuade teenagers to aban- 
don violence when their cultural environment is full 
of despair. “Live hard and die young because the- 
re’sno hope,” say rock,rap and heavy metal songs. 
“It’s also hard to compete when a kid can make 50 
or 100,000 pesos ($25 or $50) in a 15-minute rob- 
bery,” says Victor. 
The Leadership School offers no real job oppor- 
tunities but it does provide one-year courses which 
give youngsters experience in community 
management. It equips them to contribute to the 
hundreds of small organizations and informal groups 
which spring up in the slums and constitute the only 
collective response to poverty and neglect. 
Forty young people have already graduated from 
this neighbourhood university where Victor took a 
second shot at life. [|

Stars through the rain 
  
+ Katherine Arms 
In China, there were no facilities to educate autistic children until Tian Huiping started 
a school in Beijing to help her son and other sufferers. 
  
  
®  Beijing-based writer 
hen Tian Huiping discovered that her son, 
Ww Taotao, was autistic, the world closed in 
on her. Her doctor in the huge inland 
metropolis of Chongqing had never seen a case of 
autism and was in no position to give any counsel. 
Neither could she turn to a community or a 
government department for support, China being 
a country where disabilities are even today not publi- 
cly discussed, scarcely researched and to all intents 
and purposes not treated. 
Now, eight years after the painful discovery of 
Taotao’s condition, Tian has managed not only to 
find a way to support her son, but also through crea- 
ting the country’s first and so far only school for 
autistic children,has offered a ray of hope to those 
suffering from the disease. 
To bring the Stars and Rain School for autis- 
tic children to where it is today required determi- 
nation,hard work and creativity in fund-raising.It 
also demanded a drive to keep going even when the 
mission seemed doomed. “People say to me, Why 
should we spend all of this time and money if there 
isno cure? I try to tell them that to get a child func- 
tioning will give that child a better life,” she says. 
Tian came to Beijing in 1992 with nothing but 
a suitcase and her son to look for someone who 
could offer her help and advice.One doctor’s offi- 
ce had a pamphlet about children with autism, a 
condition marked by severely limited responsive- 
ness to others and abnormal speech patterns. From 
what little information the pamphlet gave her, Tian 
decided she was the best person to try and help Tao- 
tao, now 14. Her personal quest soon turned into a 
mission to help others like her. 
Her idea for a school was picked up by a busi- 
nessman who thought it might be a good way to 
make money. She enrolled six autistic children and 
hired two teachers. The businessman backed out of 
their arrangement but Tian was so encouraged by 
the improvement of the children that she and one 
of the teachers decided to go it alone. They pac- 
ked all their possessions into a cardboard box and 
moved to a single dingy room in Beijing. 
The fees for the course, which among other 
things teaches parents to help their children and 
lasts about three months, are about $120 per child— 
a lot of money in a country where most make just 
about that each month. Even so, these funds are 
insufficient. Thankfully, Tian’s work has attracted 
the attention of the foreign community in Beijing, 
and a few foreign children from diplomat families 
have attended the school. 
Tian says that to meet annual costs she needs to 
raise about $12,000, while development will 
demand another $24,000. The school has recei- 
ved aid from the Canada Fund, the Austrian govern- 
ment, and Hong Kong’s Round Table, a philan- 
thropic organization. For the past few years a 
Christmas Bazaar has been held at the German 
embassy in Beijing with some of the proceeds going 
to Tian’s school. 
Before Stars and Rain,autistic children in Bei- 
jing could only attend schools for the mentally disa- 
bled. In many cases this doesn’t work well for autis- 
tic children because often they are extremely 
intelligent and above the level being taught. Stars 
and Rain tries to enable the child to function first, 
and then hopefully integrate into regular schools. 
WhenT ian started the school and parents would 
come to her or telephone from across the country 
asking for information about autism to help their 
children, she had a list of three doctors in China 
who could diagnose the illness. Now, six years later, 
she proudly shows a list of more than 20 doctors 
who have an understanding of autism. 
The school holds four sessions a year and is boo- 
ked at least six months in advance. The current ses- 
sion has 27 pupils and that’s about the maximum 
the school can handle at a time. 
Next project on Tian’s horizon: raising money 
to buy a house for adult sufferers. u

Casanova makes houses for the poor. He has 
developed a technique that has allowed fami- 
lies to move out of their shacks and into proper 
houses with solid walls. Working alone, he teaches 
700 low-income people—380 per cent of them slum- 
dwellers—to make special bricks which halve the 
cost of building a house. Then they learn how to 
build their own houses and can earn some money 
by working in one of the five co-operatives set up by 
Casanova to make and sell the bricks. 
Casanova,45,who teaches civil engineering to 
postgraduates at Rio de Janeiro Federal University, 
1s a solitary campaigner who does not rely on help 
from the government or any big company. “Poli- 
ticians don’t want people to organize among them- 
selves,” he says. “They’re afraid of losing control of 
them.” 
His personal battle involves teaching more than 
just the basics of civil engineering. What his pupils 
also learn in his classes are the principles of citi- 
zenship. “I’m not doing this for religious, political 
or financial reasons,” he says. “I want to see people 
becoming more confident. The idea is to teach 
people to fish and then give them a fishing rod.It’s 
not much good just giving them the fish.” 
In the three years his project has been going, a 
lot of fish have been caught. His impoverished pupils 
have built 18 houses for themselves to live in and 
another 10 are planned over the next year. 
Bc: chemist and civil engineer Francisco 
The country’s first 
self-governing condominium 
Another triumph for Dr Casanova is the Duque 
de Caixas slum, in the Baixada do Rio de Janeiro— 
one of the poorest places in Rio province. In the year 
2000,1t will have the country’s first self-governing 
condominium. About 15,000 bricks are ready for 
Casanova’s pupils, who will build 10 houses with 
them.T he land still has to be bought, and this will 
be done with funding from the Research Assistan- 
ce Foundation of Rio de Janeiro (FAPERI), the only 
public body interested in helping the project. 
Casanova will sign agreements with other 
departments at his university to provide the condo- 
minium with solar power, its own water purification 
system and a plan for organic gardening and far- 
ming. The residents will be pupils of Casanova who 
currently live in the Rato Molhado (“Wet Mouse”) 
slum, among filthy puddles, foul smells and violent 
drug-dealers. 
It has not been easy for Casanova.Sometimes 
drug-dealers have ordered work in a slum to stop, 
apparently because they are suspicious of social pro- 
jects and help from outside which they fear might 
undermine their authority in the slums. The big hou- 
sing developers do not like this kind of project either. 
When Casanova teaches people to make cheaper 
cement, it means less business for them. “The deve- 
lopers try to block anything that cuts costs,” he com- 
plains. But he is not deterred by such threats. 
What drives Casanova in his lone crusade is gra- 
titude, especially towards his university, which is 
public and free. He regards his university studies as 
a kind of gift from society. “Society has allowed me 
to study,” he says,“and if there’s anything I can do 
in return,then I must do it.” 
But this does not stop him criticizing scientific 
research geared to developing discoveries made in 
rich countries. “Ninety-nine per cent of what the 
university does serves the interests of those who can 
afford to pay,” he notes. 
It is true that Brazil’s university system is 
heavily involved in projects sponsored by big firms 
such as the oil company Petrobras and the Rio de 
Janeiro subway system. University departments are 
researching into fields like high speed calculation 
and high-resistance cement manufacture.“On top 
of that,” he says, “the university is the home of 
elites.” In defiance of this elitism, three years ago he 
By using this original brick-making process, the costs of

brought 15 of his building technology students to 
the university. When they went into the canteen, the 
university students were shocked and the most pre- 
judiced even laughed at them. 
“I brought these people from the slums without 
telling the university because I knew that if I had 
they wouldn’t’ve been allowed in,” says Casanova, 
who eventually managed to get them registered at 
the university. After the project achieved interna- 
tional recognition, there were no more problems. 
“Today, no one dares to criticize me,” he says 
happily. 
Dulcinéia da Rocha is 60 years old and the kee- 
nest of Dr Casanova’s students. After studying, she 
decided to teach, became his unofficial assistant 
and recently went to Paris with him to present the 
project at UNESCO Headquarters together with 
other grassroots anti-poverty initiatives within the 
framework of the UN Decade for the Elimination 
of Poverty. T he trip was a dream come true for Dul- 
cinéia, who lives in the Rato Molhado slum and is 
one of the lucky future owners of a new house in 
Duque de Caixas. 
A non-profit technique 
without a patent 
Casanova spent 400 reals (about $200) on da 
Rocha’s visit to Paris and also bought her a set of 
false teeth because she did not want to go without 
first visiting the dentist. But she paid Casanova back 
with interest by becoming an excellent example of 
women’s determination to build. “Some men don’t 
seem to have a will to live,” he says, “but women will 
do anything to change their lives.” 
The seeds of Casanova’s revolutionary enter-

The idea is to teach people

prise were sown in 1973, when he was an enginee- 
ring student and began studying road-building tech- 
nologies. “One day I said to myself: ‘Why don’t 
people use this technique to make bricks? If we can 
make cheaper roads, why not cheaper houses too?” 
Years later, one of Casanova’s students received a 
letter from someone who had bought a machine for 
making bricks and didn’t know how to use it. Casa- 
nova helped him and, after the story appeared in a 
popular magazine, started hearing from people wan- 
ting to learn how to build their own houses. 
Offers of funding followed,although not many 
actually materialized. The Comunidade Solidaria 
programme run by Ruth Cardoso, Brazil’s First 
Lady, donated 33,000 reals ($16,500). But finan- 
cial aid turned out to be no more than charity, 
because the pupils were paid 50 reals ($25) a day

to attend the classes and when the money supply dried 
up, they vanished. “The project is working today 
because people are working to build their own homes,” 
says Casanova. 
Some businessmen are also turning to 
Casanova, but he says “the product isn’t really accep- 
ted by the market” because it is not designed to make 
a profit and is not patented. Under Brazilian trade and 
industry ministry rules,Casanova’s technique cannot 
easily be registered because the bricks are made nei- 
ther of new materials nor in a new way. The only inno- 
vation is in the proportion of the ingredients used. “It 
would be like patenting the recipe for chocolate cake,” 
he says with a smile. u 
Magic bricks 
By using a mixture of earth, cement and water, strong 
and environment-friendly bricks can be produced five 
times cheaper than the market price. They are shaped to 
slot into each other horizontally so that no mortar is 
needed; this alone brings the price down by at least half. 
The bricks are machine-manufactured, take five or six 
daysto dry and do not absorb water. They also protect the 
natural environment. For every thousand bricks made, 
12 fewer average-size trees need to be felled. 
The main advantage, however, is the low production 
cost. For about $12.50, it is possible to make 1,000 bricks 
measuring 20 x 10 x 5 cm. Transport costs are also lower 
since the bricks are made with ordinary earth. [|

amble around a little square that slumbers 
beneath the sunny skies of Timbuktu. On 
March 27, 1996, it was thronged with the city’s joy- 
ful inhabitants who had come to get a look at “the 
flame of peace”, which danced before them as 3,000 
guns were burned, to signal with a flourish the end 
of the “northern rebellion”. 
Over the six preceding years, first the Malian 
army and then vigilante groups of the sedentary 
black Ganda Koy people had fought a war against 
Tuareg and Arab rebels. Many civilians were killed 
and about 200,000 nomads (about a fifth of the 
population of the North) fled. 
In choosing negotiation and sponsoring meet- 
ings between the communities to end the fighting, 
President Konaré’s Mali won a solid international 
reputation as a champion of the culture of peace. 
The international community provided consider- 
able technical and financial aid (development assis- 
tance makes up 20 per cent of Mali’s budget) and 
the country was held up as an example. Despite 
recent troubling developments, the United Nations 
hails M ali as an island of tranquillity in an ocean of 
wars and autocratic regimes. Symbolically, Tim- 
buktu has recently been awarded Unesco’s Cities 
for Peace prize.

At President Konaré’s instigation, the authori- 
ties always use kid gloves when trying to curb 
“residual” violence and new local conflicts. In recent 
years, especially 1999, several communities in the 
North and in the western Sahel—the country’s other 
“problem” region, on the borders with 
Mauritania and Senegal—have been caught up in 
bloody clashes. 
“Negotiation and consensus are at the heart of 
Sahelian culture, of which Mali is to some extent 
the epicentre,” says historian Doulaye Konaté,who 
has just completed a study of how Malians see the 
culture of peace. “We live in societies that are diver- 
se, hierarchical and very conflictual, where 
we can’t live together unless everyone makes 
concessions.” 
Community peacemakers 
Marriage isused to strengthen ties between clans 
and between communities. A vast network of 
alliances has also arisen from sacred pacts between 
the ancestors. Sanankouya (“relationship through 
jokes”) is a practice that brings together great fami- 
lies such as the Diarras and theTraorés,socio-pro- 
fessional groups (Peul herders and smiths) and 
peoples such as the Dogon and the Sonrhai. “Sanan- 
koun” have a duty to help one another and to inter- 
vene in conflicts between their allies and 
outsiders. 
Some members of the community specialize 
in peacemaking. Griots (storytellers) and smiths are 
the peacemakers among the Mandingo and Bam- 
bara people, while village chiefs and 
councils of wise men (ulemas and leading citizens) 
perform this role in Arab-Berber cultures. “We're 
lucky this tradition still exists,” says Mahamadou 
Diagouraga, the government’s commissioner in the 
north. “The traditional chiefs, the priests and the 
notables are still listened to, even ifit’s hard to talk 
to the young people.” 
When potentially explosive incidents occur, the 
authorities gather these conciliators together for 
several days, with the help of the United Nations 
(especially the UN Development Programme) and 
many national and international NGOs. “People 
are all worked up when they arrive, but when they 
get talking about their history and all the other things 
they have in common,they usually end up making 
peace with each other,” says Firoun Maiga, a for- 
mer Ganda Koy combatant. 
For the past seven years, the government has 
been relying on this underlying cultural cohesion to 
try to keep the peace. President Konaré says he 
wants to build a model democracy based on the 
Malian tradition of seeking consensus. The

oft-repeated project of this university lecturer and 
son of a teacher, with his approachable manner and 
reputation for honesty, seems to be one of the most 
promising in Africa. He wants freedom to flouri- 
sh, national identity and memory to be revived, 
differences to be respected and grassroots 
democracy established. 
His first task was to end the war and the 
marginalization of the North, a region which covers 
nearly three-quarters of the country and has tra- 
ditionally been a hotbed of rebellion.Sidelined for 
decades and long administered by the military, it 
has been a prey to arbitrary rule and abject pover- 
ty. The great droughts of the 1970s and 1980s were 
the last straw and the region exploded in 1990. 
After the “Timbuktu peace agreement”, the 
government set about bringing some 12,000 for- 
mer rebels back into civilian life, says commissio- 
ner Diagouraga. About 2,400 ex-combatants were 
absorbed into the army and the civil service. A total 
of 9,530 others were given demobilization payments 
0f 300,000 CFA francs (about $500), sometimes 
topped up with micro-credit to start a small busi- 
ness. Only about 10 per cent of the former rebels 
subsequently deserted the army or abandoned their 
new civilian jobs and the rate of their absorption 
into the private sector is reckoned to be 70 per cent. hd : ;

other. “It’s OK as long as the money keeps flowing 
in, but if it stops fighting will flare up again,” says 
a former combatant. On top of that, the pace of 
completed projects is too slow and the democratic 
process has suffered serious setbacks. 
The disbursement of more than $200 million 
earmarked for the development of the North has 
been held up since 1995 by red tape,rampant cor- 
ruption and the lengthy bureaucratic procedures of 
the funding agencies,say all the experts. 
“You can build schools,” says Youssouf, “but if 
you want to hire a teacher, you have to have a green 
light from the World Bank because Mali is under a 
structural adjustment programme. Who'll pay the 
teacher?T he villages don’t have the money and the 
government has just enough to pay the civil 
servants.” 
Some jobless young people have got tired of wai- 
ting for the peace dividend and are choosing to go 
abroad or make easy money by joining gangs of ban- 
dits and smugglers who roam the country. Crime 
ison the increase and large-scale smuggling of Ame- 
rican cigarettes is growing. A packet of Marlboros 
bought for 250 CFA francs ($0.40) in Burkina Faso 
sells for 650 ($1) in Mali and 850 ($1.30) in Alge- 
ria. 
The government does not have the means to 
curb these illegal activities over such a wide area. 
Local people are calling for military posts to be set 
up again, on a temporary basis. “When the govern- 
ment’s strong, it crushes us, and now it’s weak, we're 
dying,” says an inhabitant of Timbuktu. 
“Democracy is a hard road to follow,” stresses 
Gen Amadou ToumaniTouré, who overthrew the 
dictatorship of MoussaTraoré in 1991.Decentra- 
lization led to local elections in June 1999 which 
upset the balance of power. The subsequent 
redefinition of territorial boundaries has stirred up 
old land disputes. 
“The North is experiencing a social revolution,” 
says Diagouraga. “Decentralization disturbs peo- 
ple’s habits and their vested interests and 
arrangements. Disputes are often settled under the 
palaver tree and sometimes in court, but they can 
also degenerate into explosions of violence.” 
Clashes have already taken place. In the second 
half of 1999 about 40 people were killed in the most 
serious confrontation,between “Arabs” and “Koun- 
tas” (Muslim spiritual chiefs,who are also Arabs). 
The minority Kountas, who lost the elections, refu- 
se to yield control of an area they had dominated 
for centuries. 
Stalled political dialogue 
The Arabs have become rich in recent times by 
smuggling cigarettes, which has enabled them to 
buy arms, one of the country’s most frequently tra- 
ded items (see box). This old rivalry also takes the 
form of a “modern” political conflict: the Koun- 
tas have stood as candidates for the ruling Adema 
party, while the Arabs have supported the 
opposition. 
Political dialogue has been completely broken 
off ever since the “failed”elections of 1997, which 
human rights organizations said were marred by 
many irregularities. They were boycotted by the 
opposition and produced virtually a one-party 
parliament. 
“We don’t recognize the present institutions,” 
snap Choguel Maiga and Mountaga Tall, the two 
main opposition leaders, who accuse the govern- 
ment of bias in settling local crises. 
Such a situation is unlikely to boost the legiti- 
macy of the state,which sprang from colonial rule 
and 23 years of dictatorship, or to strengthen the 
authority of modern institutions such as the legal 
system, which allegedly lacks resources and inde- 
pendence. And no one knows how much longer tra- 
ditionalism can keep the lid on the old hatreds 
lurking beneath the Saharan sand. u

example of grassroots Third World opposition to

action against the plants, which were being tested 
for their resistance to pests, won particular note 
from Rural Advancement Foundation Internatio- 
nal (RAFI), which has been at the forefront of the 
worldwide movement against GMOs and coined 
the term “Terminator Technology”. 
The farmers belonged to the Karnataka Rajya 
Raitha Sangh (KRRS), a movement that regards 
the spread of transgenic breeds as “anew imperia- 
list assault” on the Third World. Today the KRRS 
claims to have 10 million members in Karnataka, 
whose total population is 60 million. 
This was not the first time that the KRRS had 
taken direct action against a multinational seed 
business. In 1992, for example, its members occu- 
pied and ransacked the offices of the giant U.S.seed 
company Cargill, in Bangalore, the state capital, 
and its administrative building in Bellary. 
The KRRS was formed in 1980. Its founding 
president, Prof M.D. Nanjundaswamy, told the 
n December 1998, when farmers in the south Courier that at first “the farmers tackled conven- 
tional grievances like debts, agricultural prices and 
discriminatory taxes. Within a year,however,they 
had spontaneously developed a comprehensive 
ideology to address issues raised by Green Revo- 
lution technology.” 
D.S.Kalmat, a farmer from Sindhanoor, a vil- 
lage in Karnataka’s Raichur district, where Mon- 
santo’s GM cotton was tried out on a tiny quarter- 
acre plot, described for the Courier some of the 
events leading up to a crop-burning operation. 
Outflanking traditional 
political parties 
“We had read many articles against genetical- 
ly modified varieties,” he said. “Prof Nanjun- 
daswamy telephoned me in December 1998 to find 
out where the trial was being conducted. We dis- 
covered that the seeds had been provided by an 
Indian company. The government’s Agriculture 
Department had no information about the trial, 
and the farmer himself had no idea of its im plica- 
tions. He was willing to co-operate with us till the

### 118500: Gandhi's disputed heritage

Peace is not just 
absence of war, and 
non-violence is not just 
absence of violence. 
Non-violence and 
peace are very much 
dependent on the 
practice of active 
compassion. Violence 
and non-violence 
cannot be distinguished 
from external factors 
alone. The real test of 
compassion is our 
correct motivation and 
how we conduct 
ourselves in daily life 
and not what we 
merely say or do 
physically.

» vists from Spain and Germany and we burned the 
crop.” 
Kalmat was one of 400 farmers, half of them 
from Karnataka, who in May 1999 went on a 
month-long trip to Europe organized by the KRRS 
to press their case. “An International Caravan tra- 
velled through Europe and was in Cologne to pro- 
test at the European Union Summit and the G8 
conference,” says Nanjundaswamy. 
Opposition environmental movements like the 
KRRS have often outflanked India’s traditional 
political parties. For example, no party in any 
Indian state has come out openly either for or 
against GMOs. The mainstream parties have exces- 
sively rigid structures and rely on their own far- 
mers organizations, which are reluctant to launch 
spontaneous actions and wait for diktats from the 
central party leadership, often based in New Delhi. 
Non-party mass movements like the KRRS 
have often shown up the shortcomings of the 
conventional political system and its inability to 
comprehend the linkages between economic libe-

Such groupings are much looser, ideologically and 
structurally, than traditional classic parties and 
draw their support from an assortment of farmers, 
urban activists, academics and sometimes inter- 
national environmental NGOs. 
One reason why a mass movement against

GMOs hasrisen in India, a country where 750 mil- 
lion out of the total population of one billion live 
in the countryside, is that it is easy to whip up pas- 
sions against technologies that are reminiscent of 
the oppressive rule of British colonialists. 
Nanjundaswamy says his movement is “based 
on Gandhian ideology.” Mahatma Gandhi saw the 
Indian village as a keystone in his non-violent 
struggle against British domination in the first half 
of the 20th century. 
“In the Indian village,” Gandhi wrote, “an age- 
old culture is hidden under an encasement of cru- 
deness. Take away the encrustation,remove the vil- 
lager’s chronic poverty and illiteracy and you will 
find the finest specimen of what a cultured, 
cultivated, free citizen should be.” 
The Gandhian lineage of the KRRS’s ideas has 
also been stressed by a famous Indian environ- 
mentalist, Vandana Shiva, who has given the move- 
ment much of its intellectual rigour. 
For Shiva, non-violence means that “we live 
ecologically and at peace with all species. In India, 
the Earth community has never been seen to be 
dominated by humans. A species are part of Vasud- 
haiva Kutumbhakam, the Earth family. Leaving 
space for others is a measure of non- 
violence. . .. Genuine non-violence and democra- 
cy call for pluralistic coalitions and multiple res- 
ponses, rather than monopolization and manipu- 
lation of movements. The horizon for activism is 
very wide.” 
However, KRRS violence in destroying GM 
crops and the offices of multinationals has been cri- 
ticized by hard-core Gandhians who emphasize 
that means are as important as ends. Nanjun- 
daswamy defended KRRS actions against this accu- 
sation when he told the Courierthat “It is similar to 
burning British goods during the freedom struggle. 
During the Quit India movement against the Bri- 
tish, Gandhi was asked whether burning cargo 
trains constituted violence and he said it didn’t, 
unlike passenger trains.” 
Rhetoric and symbolism 
Critics are also sceptical about the KRRS’s 
credentials as a mass movement. They say it is res- 
tricted to a few agitating farmers and to their urban 
leadership, which seeks support from the media 
and the courts rather than organizing action by even 
relatively small numbers of farmers who tend to be 
among the better-off, with larger holdings. T hey 
also point out that the KRRS has a traditional hie- 
rarchical structure, with a President, two General 
Secretaries and aTreasurer in Bangalore, and that 
it is dominated by its founder, who is said to beha- 
ve autocratically. They also maintain that the com- 
plexities of GM crops are in any case usually beyond 
the comprehension of the peasant. They point out 
that Monsanto spokespersons in India cite other 
Indian farmers’ organizations which have enthu- 
siastically supported the introduction of GMOs. 
As for last year’s European trip, the KRRS lea- 
dership emphasized that the farmers paid their own 
air fares, though it is hard to imagine poor peasants 
being able to do this. Obviously these were com- 
fortably placed farmers, although Kalmat, who 
owns just 6 acres, denies there are any of these in 
Karnataka because of land reforms. 
On the whole the media have been supportive 
of the KRRS, which is portrayed as David battling 
against Goliaths which are often backed by the state 
and powerful multinationals. It is certainly true that 
much of the rhetoric raised against these techno- 
logies, and Monsanto and Cargill in particular, is 
couched in nationalist terms. Demonstrations 
against multinationals often attract nation-wide TV 
coverage. The media are always keen to sniff out 
conspiracies, and the threat to farmers and food 
security from powerful Western commercial inter- 
ests is the stuff of many stories, not all of them 
accurate. 
In some ways neo-Gandhian movements like 
the KRRS are open to accusations of being high 
on rhetoric and symbolic action but low on deli- 
vering the goods in international and national fora. 
From all accounts, leaders like Nanjundaswamy 
are today somewhat isolated and may not be able 
to sustain a movement against GM crops and the 
introduction of other farm technologies into India 
for much longer. u

ch than campaigns on nuclear power or nuclear 
disarmament. With partner coalitions in 89 coun- 
tries, the initiative has already exceeded its target of 
collecting 22 million signatures by the end of the 
year 2000. 
All over the world, governments, experts and 
campaigners are watching Jubilee 2000’s extraor- 
dinary success both in mobilizing a global activist 
movement and achieving demonstrable success in 
pushing debt onto the agenda of the G-8 industrial

tedness of the poorest countries. Jubilee 2000 suc- 
ceeded in getting tens of thousands of people onto 
the streets for the G-8 summits in Birmingham 
(UK, 1998) and in Cologne (Germany, 1999). 
During the latter, finance ministers agreed in 
principle to cancel $70 billion of the $130 billion 
owed by the world’s poorest nations. Rival campai- 
gners amongst environmentalists, human rights acti- 
vists and trade unionists marvel at the way Jubilee 
2000 has trounced those who talked pessimisti- 
cally about the apathy and fatalism of civil society. 
Meanwhile,some governments are seeking advice 
from think tanks as to how such campaigns can see- 
mingly appear from nowhere, mobilize such force 
so quickly and with so few resources. 
The secret of Jubilee 2000’s success is simple 
but unfashionable: it is the Christian churches. There 
is a polite disagreement over who first came up with 
the idea of linking the Biblical concept of jubilee, 
expressed in the Old Testament Book of Leviticus, 
with the millennium and debt cancellation.Catho- 
lics maintain the Pope spoke of it first, while the UK 
evangelical aid agency Tearfund claims to have ini- 
tiated the campaign’s idea in 1994. What is without 
doubt is that both Catholics and evangelicals have 
found a common purpose in the 
campaign. Tearfund provided crucial initial funding 
for the Jubilee coalition and the Pope has played a 
vital role in raising the profile of the campaign in 
southern Catholic countries. 
The concept of Jubilee in the Old Testament is 
that anniversaries should be marked by measures 
of social justice: slaves should be freed, land and 
wealth redistributed and debts cancelled. Providing 
a target, a date and a biblical justification galvani- 
zed the long-running Debt Crisis Network, a Briti- 
sh debt cancellation campaign. 
T he involvement of the churches was crucial for 
two reasons. T heir backing brought with it millions 
of churchgoers in the UK and the ready-built struc- 
ture of churches and parishes, along with their publi- 
cations. News could—and did—spread fast, and 
Jubilee 2000 found the idea taking off as an integral 
part of the churches’ celebration of the millennium. 
Alongside plans for parish parties and fireworks was 
debt cancellation. Jubilee 2000 found itself addres- 
sing church meetings up and down the country. 
A winning combination 
Secondly, the churches brought an internatio- 
nal structure. As the idea gained ground in the UK, 
it began to spread through diocesan links, between 
bishops’ conferences and via parish twinning to the 
southern countries. Missionary societies and orders 
spread the word. For the first time, the churches 
found their belief in solidarity with the world’s poor 
taking concrete form and direct political expression. 
At times, this made the church hierarchies nervous, 
admit senior Jubilee 2000 staff, but they found 
themselves swept along by the enthusiasm of the 
rank and file in the pew. This was faith in action, 
their parishioners asserted, and it helped them make 
sense and give meaning to a date in the calendar. 
Jubilee 2000’s winning combination was to per- 
suade aid agencies (such as Oxfam and Christian 
Aid) and the churches to work together. It was— 
and still is—a relationship of creative tension. Left- »

bal consequences. The Labour gouvernment elec- 
ted in 1997 had been particularly sympathetic to 
the churches’ representation in the campaign. T his 
is partly a shrewd political move from a government 
anxious to extend its political base from a traditio- 
nal left-wing to a centrist position, and it partly 
stems from conviction. Both Prime Minister Tony 
Blair and Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon 
Brown are strongly influenced by Christian socia- 
lism. The latter took on the issue of debt as a per- 
sonal commitment and has consistently pushed the 
issue up on the international agenda, proving a cru- 
cial ally in chivying other finance ministers to consi- 
der the issues. 
What is interesting is that although many point 
to Jubilee 2000 as a new form of global activism now 
possible because of the Internet, it is again the 
churches rather than new technologies which have 
fuelled its development. T he Jubilee 2000 website 
gets about 15,000 visitors a week, but much of the 
information requested has to be printed out and 
sent to southern campaigners because their tele- 
phone links to the net are so poor. 
Advance information 
Where the net has been crucial is in connecting 
about 180 key activists and organizations around 
the world, enabling them to share strategies and 
information to move the global campaign along. 
Jubilee 2000 often received information from part- 
ner coalitions on debt negotiations forming in a par- 
ticular country before the UK Treasury. As a result, 
when lobbying ministers, campaigners were often 
better informed and could outmanoeuvre them. 
There has only been one assembly of all the part- 
ners; otherwise meetings have been rejected as 
expensive and not very productive. The efficiency 
of the information exchange enables a huge global 
campaign to be run with only 15 full-time staff in 
London supporting the entire edifice. 
Jubilee 2000 is a long way from achieving its tar- 
get but it has succeeded in getting a considerably 
more generous debt relief initiative underway. No

be able to achieve what it has. In part influenced by 
wing aid activists do not like working with religious 
institutions such as the Catholic church in Latin 
America, of which certain sectors have been sup- 
portive of oppressive regimes. But while the aid 
agencies offered expertise on debt and campaigning, 
the churches provided the footsoldiers to gather 
signatures,turn up at demonstrations or swamp the 
UK treasury or the German embassy with post- 
cards. It proved a powerful combination.Despite 
rivalries betwen aid agencies anxious to maintain 
their profile and funding, the fact that a coalition of 
over a hundred groups—including trade unions and

### 118502: Sant'Egidio's diplomacy of friendship

Sant’Egidio’s diplomacy

and mediating in international conflicts

law; in a spirit of 
mutual respect,

or force.

Section, Sant’Egidio community 
dated building in the slums of an Italian city. 
She refuses to open her door. Her neighbours 
are convinced she’s becoming a derelict. A member 
of the Sant’Egidio community knocks at her door 
and starts to speak to her. She replies in monosyl- 
lables. He leaves but comes back later to continue 
a dialogue that may go on for months,even a year, 
until she agrees to open the door and let him in and 
finally start getting some help. 
Using these skills in patient communication 
based on friendship, the community later made 
contact with a guerrilla chieftain hidden away for 
years in the heart of Africa,brought him out of his 
isolation and persuaded him to negotiate instead of 
fight. 
“The Church is a home for everyone,especially 
the poor,” said Pope John XXIII, who set the Chur- 
ch on the road to modernization and opened it up 
to the world, moves which were endorsed by the 
Vatican II Council. In line with this, a group of 
Catholic students decided in 1968 to set up a 
movement which would not be an NGO but a Chris- 
tian community where religious devotion went 
hand in hand with putting the Gospel into prac- 
tice by personal commitment to the poor. T heir 
leader was Andrea Riccardi, who now teaches his- 
tory at Rome University and has been awarded 
UNEsco’s Gandhi Medal for his commitment to a 
culture of peace. 
A n old woman barricades herself in a dilapi- 
A language 
of reconciliation 
The Sant’Egidio community, which takes its 
name from the disused Roman church it has adop- 
ted as its headquarters,today has 20,000 members 
in some 300 grassroots communities in 34 coun- 
tries. The community began by helping abando- 
ned children in the slums of Rome, then went on 
to work with immigrants, the elderly, the home- 
less, the handicapped, Aids victims and many other 
groups of disadvantaged people in Europe and in 
developing countries of Asia, Latin America and 
Africa. 
One country where Sant’Egidio (St. Giles in 
English) has been particularly active is Mozambique, 
where famine and war raged in the early 1980s. The 
fighting began against Portuguese colonial rule in 
1963, stopped with independence in 1975, and star- 
ted again a few years later for external and internal 
reasons. The apartheid regime in South Africa wan- 
ted to destabilize all its neighbours who refused to 
recognize its regional dominance. Socialist-ruled 
Mozambique was a front-line target. 
Humanitarian aid provided by the Sant’Egi- 
dio community disappeared into a bottomless pit 
because it was impossible to solve the hunger pro- 
blem as long as a war was going on.T he search for 
a traditional mediator—a state or an international 
organization—failed because diplomats couldn’t 
make contact with an invisible armed opposition 
and thought,wrongly as it turned out,that the war 
would not end until apartheid disappeared in South 
Africa. 
The community reluctantly saw it had no choi- 
ce but to act as a mediator. Lacking experience, 
it had to learn what to do as it went along. It inven- 
ted a “language of reconciliation” whose syntax 
it picked up as a humanitarian organization wor- 
king for the poor. 
Sant’Egidio had discovered how to talk to all 
kinds of people from its compassionate work in a 
wide variety of constantly changing situations in 
which its members related to the poor, shared their 
lives, spoke their language, went to the same places 
they did and regarded them not as welfare cases but 
as full members of society. 
Turning weakness 
into strength 
Such a dialogue might be regarded as ineffective 
when the resources to overcome poverty are una- 
vailable. But the community refuses to give in to 
these circumstances. Experience has shown that its 
mere presence can be vitally important, even if it 
doesn’t lead to any immediate results. In the age of 
the Internet,isolation, or solitude, is a serious ail- 
ment of our time. Personal isolation or loneliness 
can drive a person mad. The isolation of a move- 
ment, a party or a country can lead to war, espe- 
cially if the international community stands idly by. 
The persistence of wars in Africa—in southern 
Sudan, for example—provides ample proof of this. 
The community’s work has also taught it to be 
patient. When the foreign minister of an important 
country travels to mediate in a given situation, he or 
she has limited time yet their mission must lead to 
results. They cannot risk failing because failure would 
damage their credibility, because there is pressure 
from public opinion or because elections are immi- 
nent. But how can conflicts that have taken shape 
over several decades be solved in a matter of months? »

Peace negotiations started at the same time in 
Angola and Mozambique. In Angola, they were 
completed in three and a half months, and it was 
said that the talks in Mozambique were dragging 
on.Many people told the mediator he was wasting 
histime and theirs too. T he negotiations were indeed 
long—11 sessions over 27 months, between June 
1990 and October 1992. Every detail was careful-

friendship and peace. So different sides come to 
trust it and talk about their problems freely, without 
the restraints they would feel if dealin g with official 
bodies as part of the power plays that are inevitable 
in such contacts. This familiarity with the warring 
parties goes hand in hand with the in-depth unders-

ca,that Sant’Egidio has gathered from its local grass- 
roots communities.

cracy, reconciliation and remembering. The 
community cannot do this by itself and has never 
sought to do so. It does not believe in parallel diplo- 
macy but in promoting a synergy of resources and 
actions. 
Gatherings to pray 
for peace 
A peace accord’s chances of success depend 
mainly on those who sign it but also on civil socie- 
ty and the international climate. So Sant’Egidio 
encourages consistent and prolonged efforts by 
many other international parties—governmental 
and otherwise—to boost any peace process in which 
it is involved .Observers representing the United 
Nations and the governments of Italy, France,North 
America, Portugal,the United Kingdom and even 
South Africa took part in the final stage of the 
Mozambique negotiations. 
These talks brought the community into the 
limelight and it acquired a reputation and credibi- 
lity that have since been used by warring parties 
from Guatemala to Burundi, from Congo-Kinsha- 
sa to Kosovo and Algeria. In Algeria, Sant’Egidio 
managed to bring Muslim enemies to the negotia- 
ting table by using another of its methods, inter-reli- 
gious dialogue. 
For more than a decade,Sant’Egidio has orga- 
nized international gatherings to pray for peace. 
These are a key factor in the language of reconci- 
liation because they build a genuine culture of inter- 
religious peace. But Sant’Egidio’s commitment to 
peace continues to be an extension of its commit- 
ment to fight poverty, to which it still devotes 80 per 
cent of its efforts. u

International Year 2000: peace isin our hands 


### 118503: Revolt against violence

Revolt against violence 
Spanish sociologist Manuel Castells* thinks violence aggravated by globalization will trigger a 
new wave of planet-wide opposition 
  
Mr Castells is professor of 
sociology and city and regional 
planning at the University of 
California at Berkeley (USA).His 
trilogy about information 
technology and the global 
economy, The Information Age: 
Economy, Society and Culture, 
has been published by Blackwell, 
Oxford,UK. 
The 3 volumes are: The Rise 
of the Network Society (1996), 
The Power of Identity (1997) and 
End of Millennium (1998). 
You predict that a multitude of what you call 
ethical-pragmatic movements will gradually join 
hands until they're strong enough to counter the 
negative effects of globalization.Do you think 
they'll grow into a kind of worldwide “grand 
coalition”? 
First, the word “coalition” here shouldn’t be unders- 
tood in an organizational sense. I don’t see a sort of 
huge international solidarity organization emerging 
to replace old-style working-class and political orga- 
nizations. But tools like the Internet could enable 
these multifarious movements to keep in touch far 
more effectively without coming under the kind of 
bureaucratic control which organizations inevita- 
bly develop. I envisage stronger and more regular 
interaction between active grassroots communities. 
By being perfectly in tune with their own environ- 
ments and at the same time connected by the Inter- 
net, these communities will be capable of precise- 
ly targeted activities, while still focusing from time 
to time on major international efforts. 
What is the basis of your prediction? 
A process of elimination. History shows that injus- 
tice and oppression always provoke a reaction. We 
live in a very creative world, where the wealth of 
information is growing exponentially, but also in a 
world that is increasingly unjust, oppressive and 
absurd. There is a huge contrast between the cur- 
rent widespread violence and the universal harmo- 
War and peace 
For me, the culture of peace and the humanist values that I insist on are one and the same 
thing.Naturally, the culture of peace includes the idea of the absence of war. That's essential 
because in a sense peace has become the luxury of developed societies. These societies have 
managed to eliminate war from daily life, but only recently. My generation, now reaching the 
age of 50,is the first in European history which has not set about killing each other. But war 
hasn't disappeared from everywhere in Europe— look at the former Yugoslavia. And certainly 
not from the rest of the world, which is torn by dozens of armed conflicts which the media 
only occasionally report on. We, the developed countries are no longer at war, but the worl- 
d's poor people are. The culture of peace is first and foremost about ending war because war 
isn’t an abstract problem for most of humanity. 
If we define war more broadly, to include personal daily violence, from the violence of chil- 
dren in the United States who kill their schoolmates with guns to the violence that so many 
women are still subjected to, then the culture of peace ispart of a broad context of social pro- 
blems. Violence is at the root of our societies, and radical cultural change is needed to get rid 
of it. The culture of peace isthe most fundamental principle of our time, and one that’s easy 
for anybody to understand and accept. MC. m 
ny we could achieve. So there must be a potential 
for revolt. 
Also, the political tools and organizations we've 
used over the past century, especially governments, 
have lost their legitimacy. T he vast majority of people 
no longer trust them to do anything except follow 
initiatives originating elsewhere. 
Collective mobilization against injustice and 
oppression is not only inevitable but is already taking 
shape—individualism and cynicism are definitely 
not universal;social change is bound to come.But 
because political systems are no longer capable of 
spearheading it, it will come from outside, from these 
movements which share humanist ideals and orga- 
nizational innovations. 
But doesn’t the idea of people coming together 
conflict with the general trend towards indivi- 
dualism? 
Yes and no. Yes, as far as the dominant ideology of 
our advanced societies 1s concerned .N o, because 
if you take the world as a whole, this grouping of 
forces is in tune with vast grassroots movements 
of community solidarity based on spiritual values 
and sense of identity. On the other hand, this col- 
lective force 1s radically different from insular groups 
or movements based on exclusion of others. Even 
if it only acts on a one-off basis it can find a place 
for anyone who shares universal values or who 
believes in solidarity between humans and human 
solidarity with nature.In fact that’s its hallmark. 
Will it be strong enough to foster a strategy 
to counter the current shortcomings of globaliza- 
tion? 
I don’t think a united, coherent, long-term strate- 
gy based on a kind of counter-programme is going 
to emerge. T hat would just be harking back to old- 
style militancy, an attempt to put new wine in old 
bottles, something which an overwhelming majori- 
ty of these new movements'members reject. They 
will organize highly symbolic gatherings, like that 
which took place during the World Trade Organi- 
zation conference in Seattle in December 1999. But 
basically, they will continue to act in an unco-ordi- 
nated way, focusing on issues that are sometimes 
local and sometimes global.By global, mean eve- 
rything from saving whales to fighting against sla- 
very. 
These movements are having an undeniable

a kind of common currency at election time. “Adopt 
these values and we’ll urge people to vote for you,” 
they say. Take the example of ecological values. They 
have emerged from a changed perception of our

that it has markedly changed its ways in the last 10

Definitely, and that’s one paradox for these move-

paradox is that if they were to give priority to pres- 
suring states to change their policies, they would fail 
because they would lose their influence in society.

the pulse of social movements and translating them

this will be swept away by the democratic system 
because the control and monopoly of information 
are getting weaker all the time. Contrary to the recei- 
ved wisdom, the media will increasingly report on 
everything that’s going on in society because of the 
emergence of countless networks of alternative infor- 
mation. The end of the monopoly on information 
also means the end of government’s monopoly on

### 118504: Euthanasia and religion

EUTHANASIA 
AND RELIGION 
 
+ Courtney S. Campbell 
ETHICS 
The advance of technologies to prolong life and control dying can raise agonizing 
moral dilemmas. What guidance is offered by the great world religions? 
In “The Parable of the Mustard Seed”, 
the Buddha teaches a lesson that is valid 
for all cultures: human beings receive no 
exemption from mortality. Deep in the 
throes of grief after the death of her son, a 
woman seeks wisdom from the Buddha, 
who says that he does indeed have an ans- 
wer to her queries. Before giving it, howe- 
ver, he insists that she must first collect a 
grain of mustard seed from every house that 
has not been touched by death. She can- 
vasses her entire community, but fails to col- 
lect a single seed. Returning to the Buddha, 
she understands that, like all other living 
beings, we are destined to die. 
Professor of Philosophy, Oregon State University, 
USA 
Death is a defining characteristic of 
human experience. Yet, while the event of 
death remains elusively beyond human 
control, the process of dying has increasin- 
gly been brought into the domain of medi- 
cine and life-extending technologies. Some 
technologies, including organ transplan- 
tation,respirators, antibiotics like penicil- 
lin, and feeding tubes, enable life to be pro- 
longed. Other technologies may hasten 
death. 
The decision to use these technologies 
is a moral choice, because it involves a deci- 
sion about a fundamental human good, the 
preservation of life. Yet, in some situations, 
a resort to technology to stave off death 
comes at a price of compromising another 
fundamental human value, the quality of 
that life. Decisions about continuing treat- 
ment for the dying or of allowing death to 
take place by foregoing or terminating such 
treatment, or even by physician-assisted 
suicide or euthanasia are thus both existen- 
tially and ethically agonizing. As individuals 
and their families face these controversial 
questions and as many countries consider 
revising their laws on end-of-life choices, 
religious traditions and values can offer gui- 
dance and insight, if not solutions. 
Historically, religious communities have 
sought to appropriate death within the life 
cycle through rituals of remembrance, and 
religious teachings have emphasized that 
death brings meaning to mortality. The pro- 
cess of dying is often portrayed as an invita- 
tion to spiritual insight and a key moment 
Staving off death may sometimes compromise a fundamental value, the quality of human life.

### 118504: Euthanasia and religion

ETHICS 
in the cultivation of spiritual identity. 
The world’s great traditions of moral 
wisdom all begin with a strong predisposi- 
tion to favour the preservation of life, 
although the specific reasons for this convic- 
tion vary from tradition to tradition. Tur- 
ning first to three monotheistic religious tra- 
ditions which have had global influence, 
Judaism, Christianity and Islam, for all their 
differences, basically address ethical issues 
concerning the end of life from a common 
value perspective. In particular,discussions 
centre on the values of sovereignty, ste- 
wardship, and the self. 
Sovereignty denotes that the lives and 
bodies of persons are created by, and ulti- 
mately return to, God. We owe our existen- 
ce to a loving Being who has graciously 
brought us into being. Thus, the funda- 
mental passages in human life, including 
birth and death, are of divine concern. T his 
understanding of sovereignty has significant 
implications for decision-making at the end 
of life. It bestows sacredness upon human 
life, which supports the impulse towards 
preserving life by available medical tech- 
nologies. Yet sovereignty also entails that the 
ultimate authority for deciding our mortal 
passages belongs to God. Human beings 
must not overstep these boundaries, or so 
to speak “play God” with life and death. 
‘Agents of God’ 
Through the value of stewardship, we 
are considered “agents of God”, called to 
carry out the work of divine intent on earth. 
This task entails decision-making respon- 
sibilities for which we are accountable:our 
actions either further or violate divine intent. 
In addition, as emphasized in Islamic tea- 
ching, we are the trustees or stewards of our 
bodies. We are therefore entrusted with the 
capacities and responsibility to make appro- 
priate decisions when confronting a treat- 
ment choice at the end of our own life or 
that of a loved one. 
Indeed, with very few exceptions, the 
major faith traditions of the West have rejec- 
ted a view known as “vitalism”, which holds 
that biological life is to be preserved at all 
costs and with all available technologies. 
Vitalism is considered theologically mista- 
ken because it appears to make divine will 
and intent contingent upon the state of 
medical technology. In other words, it puts 
technology in the role of God. 
The dignity of persons, linked to the 
notion of “self”, is another core value of 
these monotheistic faith traditions. In Jewi- 
sh and Christian thought, this is expressed 
in the idea that humans are distinctively in 
the “image of God” .Islamic theology does 
not use such language, but no less affirms 
the significant value of persons. The “reli- 
gious self” is constituted in part by the per- 
son’s rationality, freedom, and decision- 
3 8 The Unesco Courier - danuary 2000 
making capacity, but also by relationships 
(with loved ones, for example) and bodily 
integrity. These characteristics support 
human responsibility in addressing end of 
life decisions, including refusals of medical 
procedures that invade the body with no 
real benefit, in the context of a caring com- 
munity. Put another way, preserving life is 
not an absolute good in and of itself. Life is 
a good that opens the way to achieving 
higher goods that constitute the religious 
self. 
So by looking within the moral para- 
meters set by these three values of soverei- 
gnty, stewardship, and the self, we find that 
a patient can decide to forego life support. 
A doctor can also allow a patient to die if 
the continuation of life (by technological 
means) assaults the dignity of the person— 
if it attacks their rationality, freedom,rela- 
tionships with others or their bodily inte- 
grity. Certainly, differences can be discerned 
between these traditions precisely over the 
priority of these goods. For example, Ortho- 
dox Jewish thought emphasizes the sancti- 
ty of life (as displayed in bodily integrity) 
which translates into a stronger commit- 
ment to life-extending technologies than in 
Roman Catholicism, which stresses the 
capacity for human relationships as a thre- 
shold for determining the permissibility of 
Judaism, Christianity 
and Islam basically address 
ethical issues concerning 
the end of life from 
a common value perspective 
stopping life support. 
The monotheistic faiths have also focu- 
sed a great deal on the legalization of phy- 
sician assistance in hastening death by pro- 
viding a terminally ill patient with a lethal 
prescription of medication. In each instan- 
ce, arguments supporting physician-assis- 
ted suicide have to overcome a long-stan- 
ding prohibition of suicide. For a variety of 
reasons, suicide is sinful according to the 
three traditions. Suicide constitutes a wrong 
against one’s nature and personal dignity 
(“religious self”). It also harms the com- 
munity and violates the sovereignty of God. 
As a result, a physician assisting in suicide 
may be seen as a moral accomplice in evil, 
undermining the sacred covenant of the 
healer. 
However, some faith communities in 
Protestant Christianity and in Reformed 
Judaism have argued otherwise. When faced 
with terminal illness, one may well be dis- 
posed to ending life, and one’s immediate 
community (or family) may support this 
method of death. T hese kinds of arguments 
stress the dignity of the individual as a free 
decision-maker (which also applies to per- 
sons entrusted with the decision-making 
responsibilities of others). T his dignity pro- 
vides the basis for a political and philoso- 
phical claim to self-determination and opens 
the possibility for choosing the timing, cir- 
cumstances and method of one’s death.So 
physicians may be permitted to hasten death 
by prescribed medications, or even by admi- 
nistering lethal medication. Yet they would 
never be obligated to do so. 
Many religious communities have 
denounced the question of legalizing phy- 
sician euthanasia,or administrating death. 
The most vigorous opposition has come 
from the Roman Catholic tradition, with 
Pope John Paul Il describing euthanasia as 
an example of the “culture of death” in Wes- 
tern societies. T he Pope believes euthana- 
sia 1s a manifestation of social views that 
have abandoned the protection of life and 
lent support to liberalized abortion,capital 
punishment,and incessant warfare. In 
general, much religious opposition is based 
on concern for patients who may be in vul- 
nerable positions because of their illness or 
their lack of social and economic resources. 
There is fear that patients who cannot afford 
expensive treatment, for example, will be 
pressured to accept euthanasia. T here is also 
great concern about the moral nature of the 
doctor’s professional self. Islamic teaching, 
for example, stresses the physician’s com- 
mitment or covenant to healing. Euthana- 
sia would violate this sacred role. 
Although few in number, there are indi- 
vidual theologians within both the Jewish 
and Christian traditions for whom eutha- 
nasia is not a contradiction but a culmina- 
tion of religious values such as compassion, 
mercy, and love.By joining these values to 
respect for self-determination, some theo- 
logians can find a way of tolerating eutha- 
nasia as a final resort. 
Eastern faith traditions 
To die well,say the teachers of eastern 
religions, one must live well. The views of 
eastern religious traditions and philosophies 
have been very influential in global unders- 
tanding about providing appropriate care 
to the dying. For example, the pioneering 
work of the Swiss-born psychiatrist 
Dr. Elisabeth Kubler-Ross in understan- 
ding the experiences of dying patients in 
Western medical institutions drew direct- 
ly on understandings of the meaning of 
“good death”and “stages”in life in Hindu 
tradition. Buddhist values of compassion, 
non-violence, and suffering have also 
influenced the discourse of Western medi- 
cal ethics. T he ethical tension in these two 
traditions about end-of-life choices is roo- 
ted in two main values,liberation and ahim- 
sa (non-violence).

### 118504: Euthanasia and religion

& 
ETHICS 
 
Hindus and Buddhists believe that it may be permissible to shorten life when physical suffering impedes a patient's self-control and lucidity. 
In Hinduism and Buddhism, human 
beings are captured in endless cycles of 
rebirth and reincarnation (karma-samsarna). 
The goal of mortal life is detachment from 
the material world,culminating in the libe- 
ration of the true self from the body-mind 
complex. To experience the good life and 
the good death, we must be constantly 
aware of the ultimate trajectory towards 
liberation. 
In both traditions, all living creatures 
(humans, animals, plants, etc.) represent 
manifestations of the laws of karmic rebir- 
th. To honour these laws, one must show 
great respect for the preservation of life and 
non-injury of sentient beings. Acts des- 
tructive of life are morally condemned by 
the principle of ahimsa, which is the concep- 
tual equivalent of the Western principle of 
the sanctity of life. In most circumstances 
ahimsa bears a moral bias towards life-pre- 
servation. Yet there is some ethical flexibili- 
ty which opens the possibility of foregoing 
treatment or seeking assistance to hasten 
death. 
As a general rule, both Hinduism and 
Buddhism oppose suicide as an act of des- 
troying life. However, a distinction is made 
in both traditions between self-regarding 
(or self-destructive) reasons and other- 
regarding (or compassionate) motives for 
seeking death. To commit suicide over the 
loss of a child or because of economic hard- 
ship (self-regarding reasons) is to commit 
a morally reprehensible act which reflects 
the individual’s ignorance about the natu- 
re of life and human destiny. Instead of 
achieving the ultimate spiritual goal of libe- 
ration, a person who acts in this way will 
remain trapped in the ongoing karmic cycle 
of life-death-rebirth. Those who assist in 
this suicide may also be subject to karmic 
punishment, for they have violated the prin- 
ciple of ahimsa. 
To die well, 
say the teachers 
of eastern religions, 
one must live well 
However, a very different perspective 
emerges when individuals seek death for 
spiritual motives, of which there are 
basically two kinds. T he first revolves around 
compassion; concern for the welfare of 
others as one is dying can be seen as a sign 
of spiritual enlightenment. So a person can 
decide to forego treatment to avoid impo- 
sing a heavy burden of caregiving on fami- 
ly or friends. He or she may also stop treat- 
ment to relieve loved ones of the emotional 
or economic distress of prolonged dying. 
The spiritual goal of liberation can also 
be seen as an ethical reason for seeking or has- 
tening death. When physical suffering 
impedes self-control and lucidity, it is per- 
missible to shorten life. Pain or lethargy might 
cloud the awareness and consciousness at 
death that both Hindus and Buddhists belie- 
ve is necessary to ensure a favourable rebir- 
th. Extreme suffering might also cause someo- 
ne to be so attached to their material life 
(bodily condition) that they cannot pursue 
the ultimate spiritual goal of liberation from 
the material world. 
This pattern of reasoning—the prima- 
cy of spiritual goals of liberation or com- 
passion relative to the preservation of life— 
also applies to euthanasia through physician 
injection or administration of a lethal drug. 
Hindu and Buddhist scholars have found 
support for this so-called “active” eutha- 
nasia in their traditions by reflecting on the 
meaning of death as a door to liberation, the 
culmination of life in detachment from the 
material world. They then go a step further 
by linking compassion to the norm of self- 
similitude:“one should act towards others 
as one would have them act toward one- 
self”.So euthanasia can be seen as a com- 
passionate act or a “mercy killing” for a 
dying person striving to the highest purpo- 
se of human destiny, liberation. 
A moral problem arises with euthana- 
sia, however, if the administered medica- 
tion renders the patient unconscious or 
unable to comprehend their descent toward 
death. The patient is unaware precisely at 
the moment when he or she should be most 
sensitive and receptive to spiritual teaching 
and meaning. For these reasons, other 
modes of bringing about death are prefe- 
rable morally and religiously. u

### 118505: The Hermitage comes out of its shell

THE HERMITAGE COMES OUT 
OF ITS SHELL 
  
+ Alexander Kan 
Long swathed in bureaucratic red tape and cushioned by hefty state funding, the great 
St. Petersburg museum is adapting as best it can to the rigours of the global marketplace 
“I wouldn’t think of trading now, in spite 
of the constant shortage of money and 
the incessant struggle to find it, for the 
seemingly carefree then with its guaranteed 
100 per cent budget allocation,” says Mikhail 
Piotrovsky, director of St. Petersburg’s State 
Hermitage Museum. 
Piotrovsky knows what he is talking 
about, because he has seen, and has been to, 
both worlds. T he son of the Hermitage’s pre- 
vious long-time director, Piotrovsky was vir- 
tually born in the museum, which is housed 
in the magnificent imperial Winter Palace 
and is home to one of the world’s richest art 
collections. He trod all 350 rooms of the 
palace as a toddler, and inherited his father’s 
dedication to the ancient art of the Orient. 
From early childhood he was also expo- 
sed to museum administration as a kind of 
family business. “My father did not have to 
think of all the countless financial problems 
we are facing now,” he says. “But every step 
he took had to be approved by Ministry of 
Culture bureaucrats in Moscow. The cur- 
rent lack or shortage of funding is the price 
we pay for freedom to make our own deci- 
sions. We must preserve this freedom.” 
Although this idea sounds like simple 
common sense, it is revolutionary for the 
Hermitage even now. For nearly two and a 
half centuries, since its beginning as a 
modest domestic collection of Russia’s impe- 
rial Romanov dynasty, the Hermitage was 
an ivory tower of art, far removed from the 
mundane and ignoble need to earn its daily 
bread. It was cherished, both by the T'sar’s 
government and later by the Politburo of the 
ruling communist party, as a symbol of the 
state’s wealth and might, and promptly and 
regularly received generous budget alloca- 
tions. 
The break-up of the Soviet Union at the 
end of 1991 brought freedom from weari- 
some bureaucrats but also brought the digni- 
fied museum up against an entirely new pro- 
blem: chronic failure by the government to 
fulfil its budget obligations. Even in relati- 
vely stable 1996, the government approved

$40 million instead of the $60 million the 
museum requested. What the museum recei- 
ved in fact totalled no more than $18 mil- 
lion. In 1997, now looked back upon as the 
most successful year in Russia’s post-com- 
munist history, the Hermitage requested $90 
million, $30 million were approved and a 
meagre $12 million actually allocated. In 
1998, $7.4 million were requested and $5.4 
million were approved, but the Museum 
actually received only $2.7 million. 
 
A TREASURE TROVE 
OF WORLD ART 
1764: Russian Empress Catherine the Great buys 
225 pictures by Dutch and Flemish masters for a 
court museum in the Winter Palace, her new resi- 
dence in St. Petersburg. This formsthe nucleus of 
a collection today totalling almost three million 
objects mirroring cultures and civilizations from 
the Stone Age to modern times. 
1852: A building (later known asthe New Her- 
mitage) is added to house the main collections 
and opened to the public by Tsar Nicholas |. 
Other collections acquired include: Scythian gold 
from south Russia (1830s on), Greek and Roman 
antiquities (Rome, 1861), Oriental, Byzantine and 
medieval objets d’art (Paris, 1884). 
1917: The Winter Palace and the Hermitage beco- 
me state museums. 
1941: Nazi Germany attacks the Soviet Union. Two 
million items evacuated to the Urals for safety. Part 
of the collections blocked by the siege of the city 
stay in the museum and survive intact. 
June 1999: The Hermitage opens a Web site 
(www .hermitagemuseum.org) giving access to 
a digital catalogue of its collection: More than 3,000 
works have so far been copied onto the site. ®     
However,Piotrovsky remembers 1992, 
when he was appointed director, as the most 
difficult year. T his was not only because he, 
a distinguished scholar in Arabic history, 
was suddenly faced with tedious routine 
administration, but also because the Her- 
mitage, like the rest of Russia’s cultural ins- 
titutions, had to learn how to swim in the 
turbulent waters of the ruthless initial stage 
of the market economy. Subsidies were dras- 
tically cut; there was runaway 
inflation; and there was not even enough 
money for basic maintenance of the buil- 
ding, let alone expanding and developing 
the collection. 
An influx of advisers and partners did 
not make decision-making any easier. They 
often made contradictory recommenda- 
tions, and their business reputations were 
difficult to verify. Then, along with the Bol- 
shoiTheatre and Moscow’s Lenin Library, 
the Hermitage was selected as a UNESCO 
flagship project in Russia. An international 
team of experts headed by Edmund (“Ted”) 
Pillsbury, former director of the Kimbell 
Museum of Art in Fort Worth, Texas,came 
to St. Petersburg. This team eventually deve- 
loped into the International Advisory Board, 
which now comprises, under Pillsbury’s 
chairmanship, a group of respected figures 
in the international museum world inclu- 
ding former and current directors of the 
Louvre, the National Galleries in Washing- 
ton and London, the Philadelphia Art 
Museum, and the Rijksmuseum in Amster- 
dam. The board, whose members all work 
on a voluntary basis, meets in St. Petersburg 
once a year. 
Rembrandts restored 
in Amsterdam 
UNESCO used a massive development plan 
worked out by the team as a foundation for 
grant proposals, and in 1994 the first major 
gift of $1.2 million came from the govern- 
ment of the Netherlands. “The Dutch were 
extremely enlightened,” remembers Stuart 
Gibson,co-ordinator of UNESCO’s Hermi- 
tage project. “T hey were interested in spen- 
ding the money on a series of projects to 
improve the management of the museum,

including such boring but essential things 
as accounting software and feasibility stu- 
dies on hydro-isolation of flooding in the 
basement.” 
The same grant made it possible for a 
group of Hermitage restorers to take 
the famous Rovinski collection—640 Rem- 
brandt etchings and prints—for restoration 
at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, at the 
same time making valuable contacts with 
their Dutch colleagues. Now a foundation 
in the Netherlands has decided that it would 
be a good idea to raise money for a Hermi- 
tage room or rooms in Amsterdam.A per- 
manently rotating exhibition,called “Her- 
mitage on the Amstel”,is in the works. 
In October 1999 it was announced that 
the Hermitage would take the same “satel- 
lite museum” idea to London, where it plans 
to open a permanent exhibition space at 
Somerset House, an 18th-century mansion 
which is the home of the Courtauld Insti- 
tute,Britain’s leading college of art history, 
and a gallery with an outstanding collection 
of Impressionist and neo-Impressionist 
paintings. 
Fundraising, a concept so new for Rus- 
sia that a proper Russian term does not even 
exist to describe it, is suddenly becoming 
an increasingly important source of the Her- 
mitage’s revenues. While the federal contri- 
bution to the annual budget keeps falling 
(from 70 per centin 1997 to 61 per cent 
in 1998),takings from the gate have fallen 
even more drastically. In 1989 the Hermi- 
tage had 3.5 million visitors; in 1998 the 
figure had plunged to 1.8 million. 
Since most visitors are Russians, who 
The break-up 
of the Soviet Union at 
the end of 1991 brought 
the museum up against 
an entirely new problem 
pay a very lenient 15 roubles (less than a 
dollar) per ticket, takings cannot really pro- 
vide a substantial slice of the budget. True, 
foreign visitors have to pay considerably 
more—250 roubles ($10), but Piotrovsky 
has no qualms about justifying this double 
pricing policy. 
“Russian citizens have already paid their 
dues to the museum via taxes,” he says,*“so 
they're fully entitled to a discount, and so 
are children and students of any nationali- 
ty. Criticism of double pricing usually comes 
from tourist operators who once used to buy 
our cheap tickets and resell them to forei- 
gn tourists at a 1,000 per cent margin.” 
Russians simply cannot afford more 
expensive tickets. The average monthly sala- 
ry of a Hermitage curator, at 1,000-1,500 
roubles ($40-$60) far from the lowest in the 
country, proves the point. 
Another potential source of revenue- 
museum shops—has not been a priority for 
the same reason. While the Russian public’s 
buying capacity remains very low, major 
investment to develop proper merchandi- 
sing would not be worthwhile. 
This brings us back to fundraising, and 
the extreme importance everybody I talked 
to—Piotrovsky, Gibson,Pillsbury— atta- 
ched to the fact that the Hermitage, first 
among Russian cultural institutions, makes 
its annual budget,calculated with the help 
of software purchased with the Dutch 
government’s gift, publicly available and 
transparent. 
“This is a revolutionary change,” says 
Nicholas Hoffman, an American fundrai- 
sing specialist who helped the Hermitage’s 
newly created Development Department 
to work out fundraising strategies and learn 
the complex techniques of putting them into 
practice.“T here has been a dramatic lear- 
ning curve. People at the museum have figu- 
red out that donors really have to see the 
results of their money and feel confident it 
isn’t being wasted,hidden, mismanaged or 
even stolen. So far the Hermitage has done 
better than any other institution in Russia »

SIGNS OF THE TIMES 
In 1998, 1.8 million people visited the Hermitage. 
 
at that. It’s not perfect, and it’s not nearly 
as easy as it would be for a foundation to 
give money to, say, the Metropolitan 
Museum of Artin New York, if only becau- 
se the Met has had 30 or 40 more years of 
practice doing this.” 
Piotrovsky likes to point out that 10 
years ago, the overall budget of the Hermi- 
tage was one per cent of that of the Metro- 
politan.Now it’s 10 per cent—still in a dif- 
ferent league, but he is justifiably proud of 
the tenfold growth. 
Among the more recent successful 
matches between the Hermitage and major 
corporations is the elaborate bilingual web 
site developed with the help of a two-mil- 
lion-dollar grant from IBM. And even 
though the digital library represents so far 
only a small share of the museum’s enor- 
mous 2.5-million-exhibit collection, it is “so 
advanced that it puts the Hermitage at the 
forefront of the world’s museums in the use 
of computer technology,” confidently claims 
Dr. Pillsbury. 
I couldn’t help asking Piotrovsky whe- 
ther among the growing number of Western 
donors and sponsors there are any mem - 
bers of Russia’s burgeoning business com- 
munity. “It takes generations for new busi- 
ness people to become genuine art donors,” 
he says, “and it would be wrong to say that 
Russian businesses are lining up to give us 
their money. On the other hand, we recent- 
ly had a major breakthrough— a serious 
donation from Vladimir Potanin,the foun- 
der and owner of the United Export Import 
4 2 The Unesco Courier - January 2000 
Bank (UNEXIM) and one of Russia’s weal- 
thiest men.” 
Mr. Potanin’s office explained that his 
donation “will be used for creating the new 
Hermitage exhibition to be opened later this 
year in the General Staff building.” Half of 
this crescent-shaped neoclassical building, 
which along with the baroque Winter Pala- 
ce forms St. Petersburg’s Palace Square, has 
been given to the Hermitage and is sche- 
duled to be developed in a project called the 
Greater Hermitage. The additional space 
Fundraising is a concept so 
new for Russia that a proper 
Russian term does not 
exist to describe it 
will increase the proportion of the collec- 
tion on public display from the current five 
per cent to 10-15 per cent. 
The original idea was to create a new 
Museum of Applied and Decorative Art to 
rival London’s Victoria and Albert Museum 
and the Paris Musée des Arts Décoratifs. 
However, museums of decorative arts tend 
to attract less visitors than collections of pain- 
tings and sculpture. 
Then the International Advisory Board 
proposed a radical solution—to move the 
famous Impressionist collection from the 
Winter Palace to the new building. T he first 
step has already been taken. Huge canvases 
by French painters Maurice Denis and Pier- 
re Bonnard, never previously exhibited, are 
on display in a few newly renovated rooms 
of the General Staff building. 
“Relocating the Impressionists is abso- 
lutely the right move,” muses Russian art cri- 
tic Kira Dolinina. “They have been tradi- 
tionally exhibited on the second floor of the 
Winter Palace with its low ceilings, crammed 
into small rooms where in summer it is so 
unbearably hot that the wardens have to 
open the windows, which damages the pain- 
tings. T he collection is extremely popular 
and in the new building it will be considered 
in a new way. It is definitely worth a sepa- 
rate museum. But is it conceptually compa- 
tible with the applied and decorative arts? In 
fact we are talking of two different museums. 
The big museums that have recently exten- 
ded their premises—the Rijksmuseum, the 
Louvre, the National Gallery in London— 
all found conceptual solutions before they 
actually set out for the major move. For the 
time being the artistic idea of the Greater 
Hermitage looks very vague.” 
An ambitious project 
Meanwhile, the tireless Piotrovsky is set 
on a more ambitious project. He has plans 
for turning the entire Greater Hermitage into 
a cultural and commercial centre with a 
concert hall, cinema,restaurants,hotel,gal- 
leries and shops. T he overall cost of the pro- 
ject is estimated at $150 million, and Pio- 
trovsky in his frequent visits to London and 
New York is actively seeking investors and 
a developer. This is a long-term project, 
aimed rather at the museum’s 250th anni- 
versary in 2014 than the city’s tercentena- 
ry in 2003. 
So is the Hermitage an exceptional suc- 
cess story in an otherwise dim Russian land- 
scape? On the one hand it definitely is. An 
undisputed leader among Russian museums, 
headed by a confident,internationally res- 
pected director, it is slowly claiming its place 
amongst the world’s best, not only by the 
scope and grandeur of its collection but by 
the scale of its development plans. On the 
other, it remains overburdened by an under- 
developed infrastructure and excess staff, 
some of whom have trouble understanding 
and accepting the ever accelerating pace of 
change. 
So far the Hermitage has been able to 
keep its younger, competent and dedicated 
staff who are prepared to moonlight as cab 
drivers so that during the day they can return 
to the world of art. In short, the museum is 
a rather optimistic microcosm of the coun- 
try it lives in. If the entire country can thrust 
itself into the third millennium as confidently 
as the Hermitage seems to be doing, the 
museum itself will have much less reason for 
concern. Hu

### 118506: Middle East: media pluralism via satellite

MIDDLE EAST: 
MEDIA PLURALISM 
VIA SATELLITE 
  
¢ Christophe Ayad 
    CONNEXIONS 
Satellite TV channels are making inroads on state-run monopolies and widening programme 
choice, but the number of households equipped with dish receivers is still generally low 
On October 21,1999,Syrian security 
forces mounted an attack on the house 
of President Hafez al-Assad’s brother 
Rifaat in Lattakieh. The latest of Syria’s 
many political vicissitudes, the event was 
triggered by an interview with a former U.S. 
ambassador to Jordan which had been 
broadcast on the Arab News Network 
(ANN), a satellite TV channel run by 
Rifaat’s eldest son Sumar. 
During the interview the ex-ambassa- 
dor had expressed scepticism about the 
capacities of the president’s son and heir 
* Middle East specialist 
Bashar to succeed his father. Earlier, in 
1997,a report on a reception given in Lat- 
takieh by Rifaat in honour of Saudi Arabia’s 
Crown Prince Abdullah had provoked the 
Syrian government’s wrath because it had 
violated protocol and, even worse, had been 
broadcast on ANN. 
Crumbling censorship 
Whatever its real aim—information or 
propaganda—satellite broadcasting has hel- 
ped turn TV into a major factor in the poli- 
tical life of a region which has never been 
noted for audiovisual pluralism. ANN is 
only one of the players in this process. 
On the 50th anniversary of what Arabs 
call the nagsa (disaster)—the founding of 
the Israeli state in 1948 after the Arab 
defeat—Arab viewers of the Middle East 
Broadcasting Corporation (MBC, see box) 
were able to see the same documentary film, 
made by Britain’s BBC, that the Israelis saw 
on their national channel. 
“The Jordanian government angrily 
denied the accuracy of a sequence in which 
King Hussein was said to have warned Israel 
of the imminence of a war in October 1973,” 
says Jon Alterman, a programme officer in 
the Research and Studies programme at the 
U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP).

### 118506: Middle East: media pluralism via satellite

CONNEXIONS 
“The main thing was that they couldn’t 
censor it,” says Alterman. “In the long run, 
the obstacles to the freedom to inform and 
be informed are gradually going to crumble. 
T he ability of governments to act as censors 
is weakening year by year,even if countries 
like Egypt and Jordan have recently passed 
repressive press laws.” 
Governments, he feels, will at least have 
to take account of public opinion in their 
countries, even if they do not set up real 
democracies. “And those that hesitate most 
about this will be left behind by the rest of 
the world.” 
The success of the Qatar satellite TV 
channel Al-Jezeera is significant in this res- 
pect. “It introduced discussions which sho- 
wed a clash of contradictory opinions,” says 
Alterman.Since it was started in 1997,Al- 
Jezeera has become a beacon of free expres- 
sion in the Arab world, thanks to the pro- 
fessionalism of its journalists, who once 
worked in the BBC's former Arab Service. 
And because Qatar is a small country, which 
is very rich but has no major geopolitical 
interests to defend, it can afford to rub its 
powerful neighbours up the wrong way and 
serve as a meeting-point for the Arab worl- 
d’s opposition politicians. The station has 
even brought Qatar regional prestige. 
Is this an exception which proves the 
rule? Journalist Daud Kuttab doesnot share 
this very “liberal” vision of steady progress 
towards democracy made possible through 
free competition in the information market. 
Kuttab, who is highly respected in the Arab 
world, was the first chairman of Palestinian 
Television but was soon dismissed for his 
independent approach. He was successive- 
ly jailed by the Israeli army and the Palesti- 
nian Authority and now runs the Jerusalem 
Film Institute. 
A two-speed information society 
He points out that many Arab satellite 
channels are simply offshoots of state-run 
TV. “Most were set up just so that govern- 
ments could extend their influence beyond 
national borders. That’s why they often only 
broadcast classical music and a screen sho- 
wing pink flamingos,with a small emblem 
or a flag in the top left corner of the screen. 
It’s also why they spend more money on the 
technical side of broadcasting than on pro- 
gramming.” 
Such channels are also the last place an 
independent Arab film-maker would go to 
look for funding, he says. For cost or poli- 
tical reasons, programmes (animal films, 
uncontroversial features, soap operas) are 
mostly bought in Europe and the United 
States. This has a schizophrenic effect on 
viewers: the gap between their own envi- 
ronment and the pictures they see on the 
screen is just as big whether they are loo- 
king at a state-run national channel or satel- 
lite channels. 
Kuttab is just as sceptical about the role 
of satellite channels in the emergence of 
independent news reporting. He has seen 
no sign of this. Not long ago, a minister of 
information told him “I can change and 
modernize as much as I want, but the first 
item on the television news will always be 
the daily report on the president’s activi- 
ties.” This news programme will usually be 
broadcast on the satellite channels of this 
particular state. 
Kuttab also thinks that satellite chan- 
nels are first and foremost powerful wea- 
pons that some states and politicians can 
use against their neighbours or rivals. In 
fact, he says, “even when the news they carry 
is better and more varied than on local chan- 
nels, the aim is more to harm their enemies 
than to inform the public.” Saudi channels, 
for example, talk a lot about pluralism when 
neighbouring countries such as Yemen are 
concerned, but say very little about Saudi 
internal politics. 
The other danger, says Kuttab, is that 
“these channels create a two-speed 
information society where you have people 
  
THE MAJOR PLAYERS IN ARAB SATELLITETV 
twas during the 1990-1991 crisisin the Gulf that 
pictures from the sky burst in on the Arab world 
in a spectacular way. As in other regions, the conflict 
brought CNN with it and showed up local coverage 
as mediocre. 
Egypt wasthe firstto respond, in 1990, by using 
its channel on Arabsat (a satellite launched in 1986 
by the Arab League) to broadcast a short program- 
me for itstroopsinvolved in action against Iraq. The 
government expanded the experiment by launching 
soon afterwards the Egyptian Satellite Channel (ESC). 
But it was the arrival on the scene of wealthy 
Saudis that really marked the start of the “satellite 
revolution”. In 1991, billionaire Saleh Kamel set up 
MBC (Middle East Broadcasting Corporation), a 
general interest, non-subscription channel out of 
London, which was later taken over by Walid and 
Abdelaziz al-Ibrahim, two brothers-in-law of King 
Fahd. In 1994, Kamel joined up with Prince al-Walid 
ben Talal ben Abdel Azizand founded a group of 
subscription-only channels called ART (Arab Radio 
and Television). The third big private Saudi TV group 
in the region is the Orbit group of channels, set up 
in 1994 by Prince Fahd ben Abdullah ben Abdel Aziz, 
a nephew of the king. 
These powerful initiatives were a spectacular 
response to Egypt's traditional domination of regio-   
nal broadcasting. Throughout the 1960s, the Voice 
of the Arabs, broadcasting from Cairo, had called 
for the overthrow of Saudi “reactionaries”. 
Starting in the mid-1990s, most Arab countries 
set up at least one satellite channel, which often pic- 
ked up broadcasts from their national TV station. 
Egypt made a special effort in 1998 by launching the 
Arab world’s first national satellite, Nilesat, which 
increased the number of special-interest channels 
and enabled Egypt to impose its digital decoder on 
the market. Another innovation in the late 1990s 
was the appearance of all-news channels like Qatar- 
based Al-Jezeera, founded in 1997, and ANN (Arab 
News Network), started in the same year and run 
by Sumar al-Assad, nephew of the Syrian president. 
They have all been successful and Al-Jezeera has 
emerged asthe “CNN of the Arab world”. Its contro- 
versial talk shows, open attitudes and spectacular 
news presentation have won it a sizeable, though 
hard to measure audience. 
Lebanon isa special case. During the 1975-1990 
civil war, the country’s audiovisual facilities deve- 
loped in complete disorder which encouraged plu- 
ralism and free expression. In the mid-1990s, 
the authorities took things in hand again and 
drastically reduced the number of broadcasting 
licences and divided up broadcasting on a politi- 
cal and community basis. Today, two channels domi- 
nate the market and have won a name for them- 
selves outside Lebanon. They are LBCI (Lebanese 
Broadcasting Corporation International), famous 
for its professionalism and attractive women pre- 
senters, and Future-TV, owned by businessman and 
former prime minister Rafiq Hariri. 
Jon Alterman, an American academic, says 
“nobody knows exactly how many people watch 
the satellite TV channels, or who they are or what 
they watch.” As yet there isno commercial and mar- 
keting infrastructure. But one thing is certain: none 
of them is making a profit, except perhaps Leba- 
non’s LBC. 
Al-Jezeera has given itself five years to balance 
its accounts and to be privatized. The chances are 
it will be bought back by its powerful benefactor and 
founder, Sheikh Hamad ben Jassem ben Jabr al- 
Thani, Qatar’ sforeign minister. Pay-per-view chan- 
nels like Orbit are a long way from making money. 
Credibility, audience size and benefactors’ financial 
resources will serve as a natural selection process 
in yearsto come. u

with access to information from abroad and 
the vast majority who have to make do with 
official propaganda.” Alterman notes that 
the numbers of households equipped to 
receive satellite TV are bound to increase 
but they are still generally low. “In the Gulf, 
two-thirds of the population have satellite 
dishes, but only 20 per cent in Palestine, 
Lebanon and Jordan, and only between 7 
per cent and 10 per cent of Egyptians.” 
So in Egypt, the Arab world’s most 
populous country but also one of the poo- 
rest, access to a choice of information is just 
one more privilege for the ruling class. In 
aless serious vein, Egyptian TV viewers last 
summer could not see the matches of the 
Confederations Cup, in which the Egyptian 
football team was playing, because ART, a 
group of subscription-only satellite chan- 
nels (see box),had bought exclusive rights 
to screen the matches. 
The rare attempts to ban satellite recep- 
tion have not amounted to much.In 1994, 
the Saudi authorities tried to do this, for 
commercial rather than political and moral 
reasons (some satellite-transmitted films 
are seen as offensive to Islamic morality). 
They were actually trying to promote the 
interests of cable operators who were close 
to the royal family. Later the government 
took a more tolerant view of satellite 
dishes. Today, Iraq is the only Arab country 
which has not entered the era of satellite 
television. 
It cannot be denied that satellite chan- 
nels are having profound effects on Arab 
societies. For example, they help to create 
what Alterman calls “a real basic identity”, 
based on a common mental landscape and 
references that are transmitted by the new 
channels all over the Arab world and thus 
transcend national frontiers. T his identity 
is much more sturdy than the one govern- 
ments have hitherto tried to create by 
“brainwashing”.Satellite channels are also 
a link between Arabs living in the region and 
the Arab diaspora in the West. 
Competition prises 
open state-run channels 
The appearance of anew kind of audio- 
visual operator, albeit few and far between, 
has helped to transform the media scene. 
“The competition has to keep up,” says 
Alterman. One example is MBC, which 
“has clear links with the Saudi government 
but can no longer afford to appear as 
the Voice of Riyadh if it wants to keep 
its viewers.” 
The new satellite channels are more 
attractive and modern and have an impact 
on the state monopolies. Douglas Boyd, 
who teaches in the University of Kentuc- 
ky’s Communication Department,says the 
lack of credibility of local media is the chief 
reason for the popularity of satellite TV. 
The competition from the sky has for- 
ced the state-run channels to open up and 
innovate. T he official Egyptian T V channel 
now screens a lot of talk shows which, 
though uncontroversial, at least give an 
impression of public debate. Jordanian TV 
has also given air time to the monarchy’s 
fiercest opponent, Laith Shbelat,rather than 
see him appear yet again on Al-Jezeera. 
“Even Syria has seen remarkable pro- 
gress in its television services over the past 
15 years,” says Nabil Dajani, a sociology 
professor at the American University of Bei- 
rut. In Qatar, the ministry of information 
has simply been abolished. 
“Paradoxically, it’s the interaction of 
conflicting interests, defensive government 
policies and competition between various 
channels which has increased pluralism,” 
says Boyd. “A biased and narrow pluralism 
but an embryonic pluralism all the same.”

TALKING TO... 
MICHAEL WALZER: 
A USER'S GUIDE 
TO DEMOCRACY 
A leading American political philosopher’s 30-year quest for a more just society 
You've written a great deal in support of multi- 
culturalism. In short, you describe systemsin 
which individuals wear different “hats” —that of 
the citizen, a religious affiliation, a union, etc.— 
and forge alliances with others in different 
groups. While many critics claim that multicul - 
turalism dilutes the common glue (national 
identity) which binds society, you maintain that 
the real culprit is rampant individualism. 
Actually, multiculturalism can work in both 
directions. Some cultures are coercive and 
need an individualist corrective.But when 
individualism is all powerful, the society 
needs the corrective of community and cul- 
tural cohesion. 
I was recently in Jerusalem—where an 
Israeli leftist intellectual turned to a visiting 
American communitarian political theorist 
and said: “For you, community is a dream. 
For us it is a trauma.” In Israel, the struc- 
ture of religious communities is so power- 
ful that it divides the polity in frightening 
ways. Very strong ethnic national and reli- 
gious communities are often oppressive to 
many of their members, most importantly 
to women.To be committed to a democra- 
tic society of which these women are sup- 
posedly equal citizens, you have to find some 
way to break into these communities and 
reshape their internal life. The only agent 
for doing that is the state and that means 
you need a strong sense of citizenship and 
common values in order to foster resistan- 
ce or intervention in the groups 
And what about more individualist societies? 
In the U.S., for example, individuals are 
radically focused on themselves, on their 
careers, their partners or a rapidly shifting 
series of partnerships. The individual has 
little, if any, sense of being obligated or 
connected.In such a society, there is a real 
necessity to foster and strengthen the bonds 
of community. For these bonds to be 
authentic, they have to be local or parochial 
in some sense. They aren’t going to connect 
every American to every other American. 
They connect much smaller groups of 
people to one another—neighbours, faith 
communities or people with common 
4 6 The Unesco Courier - danuary 2000 
ethnic history. These connections are essen- 
tial for a society to be capable of caring for 
its most vulnerable members. Radical indi- 
vidualism does not make for the kinds of 
ties that are necessary for basic decency— 
not for justice, either, which is another two 
stages away. 
There is often tension between the left and 
minority ethnicgroups. These groups are 
criticized for alienating the majority in a labour 
union, for example, by raising issues of racism or 
prejudice. They are told to leave their 
“identity politics” at the door and join the wider 
cause of the poor. How do you draw the line bet- 
ween identity politicsand multiculturalism? 
There are a couple of different issues here, 
one of which is the relation between class 
and racial or ethnic identity. Class identity 
used to be something not all that different 
from what ethnic identity is today. The wor- 
king class used to have a language,a mode 
ofdress, and a set of values just like any eth- 
When gay men and women 
can live openly in a society that 
has previously forced them 
into invisibility, 
they are not just enjoying 
more freedom. The society 
is more egalitarian 
nic group in American society today. It is 
the decline of the cultural cohesiveness and 
differentiation of the working class that has 
so greatly weakened the union movement 
in the U.S. The union movement was never 
simply a movement of people pursuing 
interests,it was also a movement of people 
who shared a way of life—a sense of identi- 
ty. 
Even so, the distinction is commonly 
made between economic interests (which 
are supposedly rational and bring people 
together) versus birth and blood, culture 
and history (which separate people). It is 
a common complaint on the left, to tell 
people defending identity politics,“ You're 
just getting in the way of the class struggle 
and a rational defence of the interests of the 
poor.” This isn’t entirely wrong because 
identity politics is often very divisive. But at 
the same time, identity politics is a form 
of egalitarian politics which must be held in 
some kind of useful tension with class. When 
gay men and women can live openly in a 
society that has previously forced them into 
invisibility, they are not just enjoying more 
freedom.The society is more egalitarian. 
How can we bring new groups into society? 
It is important that the naturalization pro- 
cess isn’t too long or discriminatory. The 
old price for admission—especially in coun- 
tries like France—was that you had to leave 
the old culture behind. You not only beca- 
me a French citizen, you were supposed to 
become French. In the United States,anyo- 
ne who has grown up in an immigrant 
neighbourhood has felt that there was some- 
thing shameful about the old culture. We 
knew that our parents or grandparents 
would stay awkwardly representative of 
something that we were going to and had to 
leave behind.It was an imposed surrender 
of identity. Now we’ve raised the question: 
can we redefine the terms of assimilation, 
of democratic citizenship? 
To be an American citizen, I have to 
learn the English language, study American 
history and learn about the political mores 
of Americans. But what more is required? 
How much of my old identities, commit- 
ments and loyalties can I retain and even 
cultivate and still be within the body of citi- 
zens?The terms are now being renegotia- 
ted to the advantage of the incomers. There 
are sure to be a lot of difficulties in that 
negotiation but I think the product will be 
a more egalitarian society. 
At the same time, there are real demands 
that have to be made on people entering a 
democratic society. You can see that in any 
religious fundamentalist example anywhe-

re in the world. Religious fundamentalists 
want their children to attend schools tea-

cratic politics. And they often want the state 
to pay for that education.The body of citi-

the plurality of parties, the freedom of argu- 
ment and the history of democracy in this 
country.” 
You maintain that multiculturalism can 
encourage social equality. Through political 
activism, groups will forge alliances while pres- 
sing ahead with their own interests. Yet you 
never examine the ways in which 
institutionalized racism can block the path 
to equality. Why do you barely even mention 
the word racism? 
Racism may be too broad a term.The U.S. 
1s an immigrant society within which 
immigrants have been very successful. T he 
conquered Native Americans and the ensla- 
ved black Americans are the two groups that 
have been forcibly prevented but also disa- 
bled from the inside in a variety of ways. So 
they have not achieved anything close to 
equal status in the society. But the Asian 
Americans are doing fabulously well and 
yet they initially encountered a racist res- 
ponse. And I would guess that Hispanic 
Americans will overtake both black Ameri- 
cans and Native Americans in terms of eco- 
nomic well-being in the near future. So the 
problems of American society are the pro- 
blems of the two non-voluntary immigrant 
groups—those did not choose, that were not 
able to choose, to be part of this society. You 
can tell long stories about the difficulties 
various immigrant groups have encounte- 
red. But I don’t think the story about insti- 
tutionalized racism helps to explain the dif- 
ference between, say, the Irish and the 
Japanese. 
You reject affirmative action programmes assu- 
ring minority representation in 
universities, for example. What then are the 
alternatives for redistributing resources? 
There is a reason for the success of affir- 
mative action. It is inexpensive and doesn’t 
make any demand on social resources. It »

TALKING TO... 
A FISH OUT 
OF WATER 
Or of the United States’ most renowned 
political philosophers, 64-year-old Michael 
  
Walzer is like a fish out of water. “Living in the U.S, 
where there is no leftist movement or social 
democratic party, | have a rarefied political exis- 
~ tence,” he says, explaining that his main activity 
  
isto write: books and a constant stream of articles 
for left-wing reviews, most notably as editor of Dis- 
sent, a pillar of America’s intellectual landscape. 
Unlike so many of his entourage of 1960s 
activists who fashioned themselves as profes- 
sors, Walzer was not a “red diaper baby” raised 
by communist parents. Experience piqued the 
political awareness of this philosopher. Born in the 
melting pot of New York City, Walzer was steeped 
in multiculturalism with his family of Jewish shop- 
keepers of Eastern European origin. Life veered 
left at the age of nine with the family move to a 
small Pennsylvanian steel and mining town, 
where the strength of the local labour unions 
offered a vision of activism. Walzer’s formal poli- 
tical education began at Brandeis University— 
the first Jewish-sponsored university in the U.S. 
and a refuge for leftist intellectuals subjected to 
the McCarthyite red-hunts of the 1950s. 
Next stop for Walzer: the civil rights move- 
ment. Within a week of the first sit-in at a segre- 
gated lunch counter, Walzer headed south to 
write about the movement for Dissent. Within 
months, he was involved in organizing northern 
support for the movement while pursuing his 
  
graduate studiesin political theory at Harvard Uni- 
versity. In the mid-1960s when “white agitators’ 
were “pushed out of the civil rights movement,” 
Walzer explainsthat he shifted camps to take an 
active role in the anti-war movement against U.S. 
intervention in Viet Nam. 
“The only way to survive as an American poli- 
tical scientist,” says Walzer, “is to have one door 
outside the academy through political action.” So 
throughout histeaching career at Princeton Uni- 
versity and Harvard, he has used his pen as a 
lance, most importantly through Dissent, “now a 
movement magazine without the movement,” 
he says. “But we keep going in the hope that we 
will encounter our necessary alter ego somewhere 
down the line.” A.O. [|

benefits a small, mostly younger,subsection 
of black Americans and creates a small, 
rather vulnerable, black middle class. At the 
same time,it avoids the kind of investment 
that would be necessary for improving the 
level of inner city schools, or for changing 
the racial hierarchy in the U.S. 
T he rectification of inequalities requires 
a political movement far bigger than the 
black community. But given the political 
context in the U.S., there isn’t going to be 
in the near future a significant redistribu- 
tion of resources to individuals. However it 
might be possible to organize a redistribu- 
tion to groups. For example, a significant 
part of the American welfare state is run by 
religious communities through hospitals, 
nursing homes, and day-care centres. When 
the Republican majority in Congress began 
cutting the welfare budget in 1995, the lou- 
dest screams of protest came from the cha- 
ritable organizations of the Lutherans, 
Catholics and Jews—the three most suc- 
cessful groups in getting money for welfa- 
re services from the state—which provided 
in fact something like 60 per cent of their 
charitable budgets. 
Why shouldn’t black Baptists control 
the same share of tax money as white Luthe- 
rans or Catholics or Jews? These other 
groups have greater organizational power, 
and a long history of collecting this money— 
so it’s going to take a deliberate political 
decision to make it available to black Bap- 
tists. I am not religious myself but I reco- 
gnize that these religious institutions are 
socially useful. We saw this in the 1960s 
when the whole civil rights movement was 
run out of the Baptist churches in the sou- 
thern towns. Now they might serve as agents 
of redistribution. 
4 8 The Unesco Courier - January 2000 
Tolerance is becoming a buzz-word, sometimes 
sounding like a polite way of accepting the 
unacceptable. Shouldn't we strive towards 
something more? 
The crucial thing is not tolerance but tole- 
ration. Tolerance is a mental attitude but 
toleration is a set of arrangements. I think 
that the attitudes matter less and will come 
in time if you get the politics right—if you 
find the right regime of toleration. This 
reminds me of a Puritan sermon (from the 
1630s or 40s) against divorce. It said sim- 
 
‘Give each community 
the right to worship 
as it wants to, 
in its own buildings, 
without 
interference. 
With this one thing, 
you will end the wars. 
ply: if you hold the estranged couple toge- 
ther long enough, something will happen 
that makes the marriage possible. I don’t 
believe that about marriage, but it may be 
true for the less intimate coexistence of 
groups. If you force Greeks and Turks to live 
together for 200 years, there is going to be 
commerce and friendship and even inter- 
marriage across the borders—if the politi- 
calregime is successful and imposes peace. 
My stress is not on mutual respect but on 
peaceful coexistence. Start there. In today’s 
world, it would be a huge gain. Then you can 
work towards higher levels of mutuality. 
Most philosophers on the left seem panicked by 
the rise of tribalism since 1989. Why aren’t you 
so alarmed? 
All forms of parochialism or particularism 
are dangerous. A parent’s love for a child 
can produce gross injustice and spawn 
forms of favouritism and nepotism. Yet you 
wouldn’t want to give up on parental love. 
The tribal, ethnic or national forms of par- 
ticularism have greater dangers than favou- 
ritism or nepotism because of the command 
of resources and weaponry. T here is some- 
thing to worry about. But many leftists have 
made the great mistake of opposing every 
form of particularism. This is like setting 
yourself against humanity itself. 
Consider the hypothetical argument of 
many philosophers on the left: I suddenly 
find myself in the situation where my child 
and another child whom I don’t know are in 
danger. If I can only rescue one, the right 
thing to do, according to these philosophers, 
would be to toss a coin to decide which child 
to save. But it’s not possible to turn that from 
a philosophical position to a real-life 
demand. It doesn’t recognize forms of 
attachment that are natural to human beings. 
We have to find a way of living with tri- 
bal loyalties that develop historically among 
groups of people. This is the 17th-century 
English philosopher John Locke’s original 
argument for toleration. Living in an age of 
religious civil wars, he said: establish a regi- 
me of toleration.Give each community the 
right to worship as it wants to, in its own 
buildings, without interference. With this 
one thing, he said, you will end the wars. 
We have to experiment with forms of 
“The conquered Native Americans and the enslaved black Americans... have not achieved anything close to 
equal status in American society.”

tunities for a “third way”—a socialism that 
didn’t rely on the state but encompassed a 
decentralized and highly participative form 
of democratic politics, with workers’control 
of factories and new social movements like 
feminism and environmentalism. 
But instead of opening this new path, 
1989 unexpectedly brought a crisis of faith 
in any sort of radical alternative. T he stories 
of more just societies now sound like uto- 
pian fantasies. So before we can start telling 
those stories again, we’ve got to argue that 
there are forms of life different from what 
we see around us which are still sociologi- 
cally or economically feasible. 
I don’t mean to sound grim. Political 
opportunities often take shape in unexpec- 
ted ways. We always misjud ge the time inter- 
vals. 1989 came sooner than we thought and 
the opportunities may come later. 
Maybe you're also a bit nostalgic for the excite- 
ment and activism of the 1960s and 70s. What 
about the new forms of opposition developing 
at the international level around a wide range 
of single issues—rom genetically modified 
cropsto human rights abuse? 
(With a broad smile and a chuckle.) You 
may be always nostalgic for those moments 
of exhilaration. But there certainly are new 
forms of organization with groups functio- 
ning in a space that is beginning to be cal- 
led international civil society. T hey recruit 
members from different countries and act 
across boundaries even though they are 
most often trying to bring pressure on spe- 
cific national governments. But it is not clear 
that these organizations can be fully parti- 
cipative and democratic. Instead of active 
members, they have a dues-paying mem- 
bership which supports the work of a

highly mobile, professional staff. Political 
activism often amounts to little more than 
signing a cheque.l am not sure that this is 
the kind of activism that makes for demo- 
cratic decision-making. 
How do you account for this decline in acti- 
vism? 
In the U.S., for example, political parties 
used to operate at many different levels— 
the state, city and even the precinct (neigh- 
bourhood). When you have a party articu- 
lated with activists at every level, you can be 
pretty sure of that group of people’s abili- 
ty to hold leadership responsible. The broa- 
der the activism, the wider the responsibi- 
lity of the leadership. 
Today, the precinct party offices are 
gone. You have a candidate and an entou- 
rage of publicity and make-up people who 
function like a commando unit. They des- 
cend on a place in time to make the evening 
TV news and then depart.T here is no local 
structure to hold them responsible. 
An alternative might be a civil society 
articulation of democratic politics. Instead 
of relying on party structures which are so 
far removed from local communities, citi- 
zens might form associations through 
churches, unions or philanthropic groups 
to press for their demands and hold politi- 
cal leaders responsible. 
When describing the “good life”, most 
philosophers offer sweeping refl ections 
on universal principlesand ideals. Yet you 
focus strictly on the nuts and bolts of political 
arrangements. Why? 
It’s a feature of Western philosophical, reli- 
gious and more recently political tradition 
to focus on the good society and the good 
life where that definite article is very defi- 
nite and singular in character. Monotheis- 
tic religion with its notion of the messianic 
kingdom contributes to that singular 
conception which the left inherited. Most 
people who talk nowadays about the good 
society are on the left. 
I have never believed that there could be 
either a definite or a singular picture of the 
good life. You could tell stories of good lives. 
You could point to people who had lived 
well. You could describe a variety of good 
societies in movements, communities and 
even states. But given the immense variety 
of human beings and the extraordinary crea- 
tivity of humanity, it never seemed plausible 
to think there can be one way of living, or 
one correct form of social organization. ®
