ALANCE-SHEET of a CONFERENCE 
44 alance-sheet of a Confe- 
rence’’—such is the title 
under which Le Monde, an 
influential French daily, sums 
up its impressions of the 
Fourth Session of Unesco’s General 
Conference. 
Is it possible—the question is worth 
raising—to strike a balance at this 
date? Unesco, and particularly its 
legislative body, the General Confe- 
rence, has so frequently been engaged 
in this kind of self-probing that it has 
been ironically called “an organization 
in search of a purpose”. Would it 
not be better to get on with the work 
in hand? Should one not leave the 
striking of balances to the future when 
the programme resolutions adopted in 
Paris have been translated into the 
realities of contemporary life ? 
But realities, for men, do not exist 
independently of ends. The health of 
the spirit, implies a ceaseless self- 
interrogation. This much we have 
learned in the first years of Unesco’s 
existence. And we have also learned 
that every meeting of men—whether 
it be a football match a symphonic 
concert or an international conference 
—has this in common: it adds up, as 
man himself adds up, to more than the 
sum of its parts. The balance-sheet 
of the Fourth Session can scarcely be 
a mathematical one. And the signi- 
ficance of a Conference cannot be 
found in a mere enumeration of the 
matters inscribed on its agenda. 
* 
t should be noted, of course; that 
| a meeting of men, a fortiori a 
conference of some fifty nations, 
could scarcely address itself more 
energetically than did the Fourth 
Session, to a given series of practical 
tasks. Between September 19th and 
October sth, the delegates examined 
and adopted a new budget, involving 
important matters of detail and prin- 
ciple. 
They defined Unesco’s position 
with respect to the United Nations 
Plan for Technical Assistance to 
Under-developed Countries. They 
discussed and voted on the Director 
General’s proposals for simplifying 
and concentrating the programme of 
Unesco, which meant a point-by-point 
analysis of projects in every field of 
education, science and culture. They 
elected six delegates to sit on the Exe- 
cutive Board. And they settled such 
thorny questions as the extension of 
Unesco’s work to Germany and Japan. 
These and many others, were the 
practical tasks of the General Confe- 
rence. A detailed account of how 
they were handled will be found on 
other pages of the Courier. But the 
Question remains: what is the balance, 
how does it all add up? 
15% Courier cannot pretend to 
give a final answer to this 
question. We have a sugges- 
tion, however, and one which proceeds 
from the proposition that Unesco must 
be, at this stage of its growth, “an 
organization in search of a purpose”... 
A few days after President E. Ronald 
Walker declared the Fourth Session 
closed, Unesco held a meeting of 
experts on the problem of juvenile 
vagrancy. This gathering, which took 
place in the Children’s Village of Mar- 
cinelle, near Charleroi, in Belgium, 
focussed the attention of many emi- 
nent sociologists and child psycholo- 
gists on one of the most moving phe- 
nomena of the post-war world. News-

wrote articles vibrant with compassion 
and protest. And then, after praising 
Unesco for organizing this confron- 
tation of methods experience and ideas, 
one Parisian journal asked: But what 
is Unesco going to do? 
The answer, in despite of all irony, 
lies in one more reference to our ends. 
The Organization has done what it can, 
within the limits of its meagre resour- 
ces, to expose the anguishing problem 
of homeless children. It is doing 
what it can to help the experts who are 
trying to create conditions in which 
these children can become healthy 
men and women. And now it~ can 
only turn to the States which have 
solemnly ratified Unesco’s Charter, 
and the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights, and say to them: 
What are you going to do? 
* 
een thus in its proper light, the 
meeting at Charleroi confronts 
the nations with their responsi- 
bilities. And does not this suggest 
a useful way to strike the balance- 
sheet of the General Conference? 
Our Charter has now been signed 
by fifty sovereign nations. Let the 
reader of the Courier, in examining 
the decisions of the Fourth Session, 
remember: this is what the nations 
have decided. 
Now what are they going to do?

### 74131: National Commissions draw blueprint for Florence Meeting

"NATIONAL COMMISSIONS DRAW UP BLUEPRINT 
FOR FLORENCE MEETING 
BY LORNA McPHEE 
elegations to Unesco's Fourth 
D General Conference this year in- 
cluded over one hundred repre- 
sentatives of permanent or provisional 
National Commissions from the 41 
countries where they have been 
formed. 
Advantage was therefore taken of 
their presence in Paris to hold two 
informal meetings for an exchange of 
views and information, and these took 
place on September 23 and October 4, 
under the chairmanship of Professor 
Marcel Florkin, vice-chairman of the 
Belgian National Commission. 
The main subject under discussion 
was the important meeting of repre- 
sentatives of National Commissions to 
be held in connection with Unesco’s 
Fifth General Conference in Florence, 
next year, 
The first official meeting of Natio- 
nal Commission represenvatives was 
held last November immediately before 
the opening of the Beirut Conference 
and was attended by members of 28 
commissions. The purpose of such ga- 
therings is to enable the members of 
Unesco’s National Cooperating bodies 
to become better acquainted with one 
another and to exchange ideas and 
experience. 
At the recent informal discussion it 
was decided that a three day meeting 
should be held before the opening of 
the Florence Conference on May 22, 
and that, if necessary, a further meet- 
ing could be called before the confe- 
rence ended. 
Before the representatives considered 
in detail the Agenda for the Florence 
meeting, a long discussion was held 
on a draft resolution proposed by the 
Vice-Chairman of the Turkish Natio- 
nal Commission, Dr. Tevfik Saglam. 
“The Director-General is instruct- 
ed to convene in the near future a 
meeting composed of a member 
from each National Commission or 
National Co-operating Body, with a 
view to co-ordinating the methods 
of work to be applied in common, in 
order to ensure that these National 
Commissions, in their relations both 
with Unesco and with their Govern- 
ments, achieve better results.” 
The essence of the Turkish proposal 
was that a special expert meeting of 
National Commissions representatives 
of a maximum duration of three weeks 
Should be held quite separately from 
sessions of the General Conference. 
While this proposal was received 
with great interest, many representa- 
tives considered that the problems re- 
lating to methods of work of the va- 
rious commissions might be more 
easily solved by the sending of Secre- 
taries of National Commissions to the 
headquarters of Unesco for periods of 
study and consultation and by the ge- 
neral discussion of common problems 
at the annual meetings of National 
Commissions held in connection with 
General Conferences,

It was, moreover, considered imprac- 
ticable to hold such a meeting before 
the Fifth Session of the General Con- 
ference. Finally, it was agreed that 
the Secretariat should prepare a do- 
cument on the implications of this 
proposal for consideration at the Na- 
tional Commissions Meeting to be held 
in Florence in 1950. 
AGENDA FOR FLORENCE 
fter a lively discussion, the repre- 
A sentatives agreed that the Agenda 
for the Florence meeting should 
allow opportunities for reports and 
discussion on the programme activities 
and organization of fhe various Natio- 
nal Commissions. 
These subjects would include: 
Organization of National Commission 
Secretariats and the financial resources 
at their disposal for programme acti- 
vities; action taken by Commissions in 
response to requests from the Secreta- 
riav; action taken on their own ini- 
tiative in supvort of Unesco’s program- 
me; areas of activity in which they 
may effectively engage; methods of 
work employed .by National Commis- 
sions; deeentralization of activities 
and relations between National 
Commissions and non-governmental 
organizations, e. g. Youth Organiza- 
tions, Labour Organizations, Universi- 
ties, etc. 
The meeting would also consider the 
report of the Secretariat on action ta- 
ken to carry out the decisions of the 
Fourth Session of the General Confe- 
rence on liaison with National Com- 
missions, and the report on the Turkish 
proposal. 
It was agreed that a Committee 
consisting of the representatives of the 
United kingdom, the United States, 
France and Belgium, should assist 
the Head of the National Commis- 
sions Division, in the drawing up of 
the final Agenda for the Florence 
Meeting, which should later be cir- 
culated to all National Commissions. 
The representatives at the Florence 
Meeting will, therefore, come prepared 
to speak with authority on the various 
items in the Agenda, since a sufficient 
interval of time will have been allowed 
to enable National Commissions to 
study these questions in detail. 
MESSAGE IN ANCIENT GREEK 
elations between National Commis~ 
sions and the Secretariat, it was 
agreed, had been more fruitful 
and generally more satisfactory in 1949 
than in previous years. Certain sug- 
gestions for improvement in liaison 
arrangements and on the subject of 
documents for National Commissions 
were made by the representatives of 
AuStralia and the United Kingdom. 
Mr. Gordon Menzies, the Head of 
  
Sydney. 
  
Central Administrative Services, re- 
plying to representatives who had sug- 
gested the need for improvement in 
the content and distribution of docu- 
ments, informed the meeting that a 
Committee of Experts on documenta- 
tion would meet shortly. 
It was hoped, he said, that the find- 
ings of the Committee would enable 
the Director-General and the Execu- 
"tive Board to evolve a sound policy for 
the future. 
The co-operation of the National 
Commissions in the distribution of in- 
formation documents and publications 
of Unesco was essential to the success 
of any policy adopted by the Unesco 
Secretariat. It was generally agreed 
that « a two-way effort » was required 
for the solution of liaison problems. 
Before the close of the meeting, Pro- 
fessor C. Eustathiades (Greece) abn- 
nounced the creation of the Greek 
National Commission for Unesco and 
read part of a message addressed in 
ancient Greek by the rresident of the 
National Commission to the Director- 
General of Unesco. .

tions attended the meetings as spokes- 
men for their National Commissions 
or Governments:

### 74132: One hundred non-governmental organizations now working with UNESCO

NON-GOVERNMENTAL 
ORGANIZATIONS 
NOW WORKING WITH UNESCO 
by Vladimir Hercik, Head, Non-Governmental Organizations Division 
LTHOUGH planned 
as “A short busi- 
ness session”, Unes- 
co’s Fourth General Con- 
ference has surpassed 
all previons Conferences 
as regards the numbers 
of observers sent by in- 
ternational non-govern- 
menta] organizations. 
The fact that  head- 
quarters of most of 
these organizations are 
located relatively near 
to Paris, and some of 
them in Paris itself, does f 
not wholly explain this { 
record attendance of sev- 
enty-nine obervers from sixty-three organ- 
izations. 
A more significant fact is that the number 
of non-governmental Organizations entitled 
to send observers to the General Conference 
has more than trebled since the Second 
Session in Mexico City, to which only 
thirty such organizations were invited. 
Participation in the General Conference 
with a right to speak is one of the basic 
privileges granted to organizations with 
which Unesco has concluded “consultative 
arrangements”, On the eve of the Confe- 
rence, the Executive Board had approved 
18 additional organizations to be included 
in this category, thus bringing the total 
number to one hundred. 
The organizations represented at the 
General Conference reflected in a striking 
way an amazing variety of interests pursued 
by these groups on an international level. A 
large majority of them have been in exis- 
tence considerably longer than Unesco and 
have consequently accumulated invaluable 
experience in most fields of Unesco's pro- 
gramme. 
Apart from specialized, professional bodies 
of educators, scientists, artists, architects, 
the groups represented included a number 
of women's organizations, others concerned 
with religious, humanitarian, relief, and 
child welfare work, as well as youth, stu- 
dents and trade-union groups. 
Something for Everyone 
EVERY one of these organizations was 
able to find in the programme that 
Unesco proposed for 1950 at least one, and 
often more than one, activity of particular 
interest to its members. Represen‘atives of 
several bodies spoke in the commissions on 
matters falling within the competence of 
their organizations. 
The Commission of Official and External 
Relations devoted two full sessions to dis- 
cussion of relations between Unesco and 
ion-governmental organizations. An annual 
review was made of all international non- 
governmental organizations with which 
Unesco maintains official relationship, either 
under consultative arrangements, or formal 
agreements. 
A report has been submitted on more than 
thirty contracts concluded in the course of 
1849 for a total amount of nearly $200,000 
between Unesco and competent non-govern- 
mental organizations for the execution of 
specific tasks listed in Unesco’s programme, 
such as surveys, investigations, bibliogra- 
« The evidence of good will which we have 
. already received in abundance from these asso- 
ciations is most encouraging. Whether it is a 
case of calling on the services of experts or mobi- 
lizing public opinion, they are ready to help us, 
so that there may be grouped around the work 
of the Secretariat great numbers of people united 
by a common interest, who, in conjunction with 
the work of governments, will convert Unesco 
into a true popular crusade for peace. » 
M. Jaime TORRES BODET, in his 
Report to the Fourth General Conference 
phies, international meetings and various 
studies. 
Another report gave an account of 
grants-in-aid accorded by Unesco to cer- 
tain very representative organizations 
which are in daily working relations with 
Unesco programme departments and 
contribute by their activity to the further- 
ance of Unesco’s objectives. These grants 
amounted in 1949 to $320.000. 
The Commission discussed at great length 
the question of how to make the co-ope- 
ration with non-governmental bodies more 
effective. Ii was felt that the time had 
come to make a thorough review of the 
directives governing Unesco’s relationship 
with these bodies and in the light of the 
experience acquired during the past two 
years, to amend and complete the policy 
of Unesco in these matters when necessary. 
Two-way Help - oo 
|B has therefore been decided to give spe- 
cial attention to this problem at the next 
session of the General Conference in Flo- 
rence. A comprehensive report will have to 
be prepared for the Florence Conference on 
the contribution to the work of Unesco 
made by all international organizations 
which have been brought into official rela- 
tions with Unesco and have received 
assistance in any form from the Organi- 
zation. - 
This decision is in line with the policy of 
the Economic and Social Council of the 
United Nations which is contemplating, for 
its forthcoming Tenth Session, a similar 
review of its relations with non-governmen- 
tal Organizations. 
In view of this special item on the agenda, 
the next General Conference is likely to 
attract at least as large a number of obser- 
vers of non-governmental organizations as 
the last one. Moreover, by giving its atten- 
tion to this matter, the Florence Conference 
will be able to realize what valuable 
resources may be made available for Unesco 
by these bodies representing all sections of 
public opinion and manifold forms of volun- 
tary effort throughout the world. 
It is safe to predict that in its own inta 
rest, Unesco will increase and intensify co- 
operation with International non-govern- 
mental organizations which are in their 
daily work bringing _about the underlying 
community of organized interests without 
which no form of international co-operation 
can succeed.

GENERAL

BUDGET 
ACCEPTS 
COMPROMISE 
FIGURE 
move by the United 
Kingdom, backed by 
several other General 
Conference delegations to 
apply the “axe” to Unesco’s 
proposed budget figure for 
1950, so as to maintain it at 
the 1949 figure of $7,780,000 
was rejected at the close of a 
dramatic discussion before 
a special session of Unesco’s- 
Programme and Budget Com- 
mission on September 29. 
Mr David Hardman, Mem- 
ber of the British Parliament, 
and head of the United 
Kingdom delegation, had, up 
to this point, led his dele- 
gation colleagues in a stre- 
nuous fight for economy cuts 
in the Budget. He finally 
agreed at the close of the 
debate, to accept a “target” 
figure of $8,000,000, proposed 
to the conference by Mr 
George V. Allen, principal 
United States delegate in 
place of the “devaluation-ad- 
justed” sum of $8,170,000, 
submitted by the Director- 
General. 
An indication that the U.K. 
delegation intended to press 
for a reduced budget ceiling 
was given by Mr Hardman in 
an earlier speech to the 
Conference. 
Quoting a phrase used by 
M. Torres Bodet, that Unes- 
co’s mission was “both mili- 
tant and practical” Mr 
Hardman commented “My 
delegation feels that being 
militant and practical means 
concentration: not .through 
re-organization necessarily, 
but in particular by wielding 
the axe and cutting out a lot 
of dead wood.” 
Mr Hardman asked for a 
careful examination of the 
system of payment of fees, 
and said he wondered if pre- 
paration by Unesco of forty 
million pages of cyclostyled 
memoranda and documents 
in a year was really neces- 
sary. 
Needs | Not Sole 
Criteria 
H E also advocated extended 
use of private publishing 
houses rather than an 
attempt to set up a “grandiose 
Unesco, avenue Kleber, pu- 
blishing house.” For the sake 
of concentration he appealed 
to delegations to give up 
some of their “pet schemes.” 
Mr Proceso Sebastian (Phi- 
lippines) declared that while 
he had no quarrel with the 
principles enunciated by Mr 
Hardman, it must be remem- 
bered that Unesco was a 
growing concern. “It must 
grow,” he said, “and we 
should not tie the hands of 
the Director-General by not 
giving an increase, simply 
because we do not want an 
increase’. 
Mr. John B. C. Watkins, of 
Canada, who followed the 
Philippines delegate, express- 
ed the following view 
“Needs alone cannot be ac~ 
cepted as the sole criteria 
for deciding on the extent of 
the Unesco programme. The 
world’s capacity to meet 
these needs must also be 
taken into account”. It 
was for the conference to 
decide, he told delegates, 
whether projects already 
under way and those still to 
be initiated were really a 
basic minimum which could 
be maintained. He added : 


### 74133: Budget for 1950 8,000,000 dollars

ror 1930 
8.000.000 DOLLARS 
“It would seem that, in the 
light of the general interna- 
tional situation, it is desirable 
to effect substantial econo- 
mies, and thereby limit ex- 
penditure to a figure which 
can more easily be borne by 
member states during 19507. 
Previously, at a joint meet- 
ing of the Programme and 
Budget and Official and 
External Relations Commis- 
“sion on September 24, M. 
Torres Bodet presented 
delegates with revised budget 
estimates “in the light of 
devaluation measures”. 
The Director General 
stated that, after consultation 
with the Executive Board, 
and in full agreement with 
the Board, investigations 
carried out by the Secretariat 
showed that a reduction of 
$575,000 might be made to 
the total budget figure under 
discussion, thus reducing the 
increase over the 1949 Budget 
from $968,000 to $393,000. 
Delegations had the Direc- 
tor-General’s report before 
them until the “key” discus- 
sion on the Budget ceiling 
took place at the meetings 
of the Programme and 
Budget Commission on Sep- 
tember 29. 
Dr. Tara Chand, of India, 
then opened the discussion by 
requesting delegates to ac- 
cept the adjusted Budget 
figure submitted by the 
Director-General, amounting 
to $8,170,000, He was sup- 
ported by Dr. Portuondo 
(Cuba), M. Bidault (France), 
M. Verniers (Belgium), M. 
Photiades (Greece) and 
Count Jacini (Italy). 
Mr. Hardman intervened 
after the Cuban delegate, 
with a United Kingdom pro- 
posal that the former ceiling 
of $7,780,000 should be 
maintained for the year 1950. 
“The National Commission of 
the United Kingdom,” he 
said, “has studied each item 
of the programme and has 
come to the conclusion that 
the former ceiling should be 
maintained during the coming 
year.” 
His proposal was supported 
by several other delegations. 
“ Prestige of Uneseéo 
Not At Stake ” 
R. Van ZyrL, of South 
Africa, said : “The pres- 
tige of Unesco is not at stake, 
but the fact must be consi- 
dered that all over the world 
nations are having difficulties 
in balancing their Budgets. 
It will be a very delicate 
matter to go back home and 
say that more money must be 
contributed to Unesco” 
“The proposed ceiling of 
$8.170.000 really means an 
increase of more than one 
million dollars.” he added, 
Dr. Alf Sommerfelt of 
Norway, backed the United 
Kingdom proposal and said : 
“My position is motivated by 
economic difficulties now

ber of countries.” 
Mr George Allen, head of 
the United States delegation, 
here provided the turning 
point in the debate. “I feel,” 
he told delegates, “it will be 
best not to fix a ceiling, but 
rather a target figure which 
the approximate total might 
be expected to come to. 
“I propose that the Com- 
mission should send instruc- 
tions to the Drafting and Co- 
ordination S ub - Committee 
that the target figure should 
be $8,000,000.” 
This new proposal had 
support from M. Jean Piaget, 
of Switzerland, and was 
agreed to by Mr Watkins, of 
Canada, with the qualifica- 
tion that the sub-committee 
would be very careful in its 
consideration of the appro- 
priation of each item.

T the Beirut Conference the Unesco Budget « ceiling » for 1949 was first fixed at 8,000,000 doilars, 
and finally reduced to $7,780,000. This year, delegates voted down a United Kingdom proposal 
for retaining last year’s figure, and accepted a United States « target » figure of 8,000,000 dollars 
This accepted total is to embrace the most important and urgent of the projects submitted to the Fourth

Kingdom delegation. Mr 
Hardman said he regretted 
“that he could not accept 
the terms” presented by 
Mr Allen “While fully 
agreeing’ he explained “that 
the proposed programme is 
most excellent, my conclusion 
is based on the complete dis- 
cussion which has been held 
by the National Commission 
of the United Kingdom, and 
on a full consideration of the 
Budgetary implications by 
those who would be obligated 
to request the appropriation 
of funds.” 
The Chairman of the Com- 
mission, Professor Carneiro, 
of Brazil, called for a vote 
on the United Kingdom pro- 
position. It was rejected 
by 23 votes to 7. 
U.S. Compromise 
Aceepted 
ROFESSOR CARNEIRO then 
put the United States re- 
commendation. As the dele- 
gates raised their hands to 
vote they saw that the United 
Kingdom delegation and the 
other supporters of Mr Hard- 
man’s recommendation had 
waived their opposition to 
join in the unanimous appro- 
val accorded by the Commis- 
sion to the $8,000,000 figure 
proposed by Mr George 
Allen. 
With the fixing of the 
Budget figure, there remained 
only a number of technical 
discussions in sub-committee 
before the final vote was 
taken at the last Plenary 
meeting. 
Sir John Maud, of the 
United Xingdom, while 
joining in the general support 
of the $8,000,000 figure at the 
last Plenary session, added 
“I think we ought not, at a 
conference, too hurriedly to 
assume that there are not 
disadvantages in, on future 
occasions, firing a Budget 
figure, and not proceeding 
towards a Budget figure by 
stages, the first of which is to 
decide provisionally on a cei- 
ling... In our experience 
during the past three years, 
we do not think that there 
are distinct advantages in 
starting with a ceiling.” 
Sir John suggested that in 
future years, on the lines of 
the House of Commons Public 
Accounts Committee, before 
the Conference assembled, 
there might be some smalil 
Commission of government 
representatives who would 
look at Budget proposals, not 
from the point of view of 
policy, but with a view to 
seeing whether all the pro- 
posed expenditure wag justi- 
fiable from an economic point 
of view. 
The Chairman put the 
resolution to the Conference 
and the Budget discussion 
had ended.

"BALANCE SHEET 
of he 
CONFERENCE” 
the opening of the Fourth 
Session of Unesco’s Gene- 
ral Conference on Septem- 
ber 19, delegates, hard at work 
in plenary sessions and com- 
mittee rooms, had reviewed the 
current Unesco programme 
and that for 1950, established 
the budget “ceiling” of the 
Organization at § 8,000,000 and 
also prepared the way for the 
Fifth General Conference, to 
be held in Florence next May. 
On the afternoon of Octo- 
ber 5, Dr. E. Ronald Walker, 
head of the Australian delega- 
tion, and Chairman of the 
Fourth Session, rapped his pre- 
sidential gavel on the desk 
before him in the main confe- 
rence hall at Unesco House for 
the last time. He said “Je 
déclare close la Quatriéeme Con- 
ference Générale de 1'Unesco”. 
Dr. Walker, speaking in 
French, had just made a busi- 
nesslike and friendly conclu- 
ding speech to the 47 delegates 
S EVENTEEN days after 
  
   
   
 
in draft, for final consideration 
by the plenary sessions. 
Four large-scale modern tra- 
gedies were brought home to 
delegates at a meeting of the 
Programme and Budget Com- 
mission on December 24 in a 
discussion on what Unesco 
could do to help victims of the 
Ecuador earthquake, the child 
refugees in Greece and the 
Middle East, and to aid the 
people of war-stricken China. 
Subsequent appeals by the 
Director-General, recommen- 
dations of the Executive Board, 
vaFious statements by local 
delegates describing the tragic 
state of present conditions in 
their countries, were heard 
and discussed in commission, 
sub-commission, and plenary 
session. 
At the close of the confe- 
rence, four important resolu- 
tions were approved, thus 
expressing in practical terms 
the urgent desire by all dele- 
gations to help. 
» International Interest » is strikingly expressed in this picture 
of delegates and visitors examining Unesco publications at 
the special stand set up in Unesco House, during the General 
: Conference. 
of Unesco’s fifty member states 
represented at the fifteenth 
and closing session of this 
Unesco “Business Meeting” 
conference. 
His review of the tasks ac- 
complished was loudly applau- 
ded by the 49 member states 
“shareholders” in Unesco, the 
observers from interested non- 
member countries, and the rep 
resentatives of associated non- 
governmental organizations. 
Looking back, the delegates 
had cause for satisfaction at 
the results achieved during the 
previous 17 days. 
After the opening meetings 
of the conference, as reported 
in the last issue of the Courier, 
several main issues had emer- 
ged. There was a general de- 
mand for closer concentration 
of Unesco’s programme. There 
was unanimity on the question 
of Unesco making an all-out 
effort to participate in the 
United Nations plan for Tech- 
nical Assistance to Underdeve- 
_loped Countries, and on the 
resolutions concerned with the 
welfare of the young, with 
special emphasis on help for 
. the refugee children of Greece 
and the Middle East. 
Another encouraging fact 
. was the staunch support ac- 
corded M. Torres Bodet in his 
“plea for the development of 
-Unesco National Commissions 
in Member States. 
With the end of the sixth 
plenary meeting on September 
22, much of the work of the 
conference was transferred to 
committees or commissions. 
It was, therefore, during these 
meetings that many of the 
thorny problems of the confe- 
rence were thrashed out. 
Most important of these 
working parties was the Pro- 
gramme and Budget Commis- 
sion which held all its meet- 
ings in the big hall used for 
plenary meetings. It was, in 
fact, a committee of the whole 
conference, at which the exist- 
ing programme, plans for the 
future, and the Budget were 
sifted, criticised, and approved 
These final resolutions called 
on Unesco to: — 
Co-operate actively with the 
United Nations and other Spe- 
cialized Agencies concerned 
with victims of the recent 
earthquake in Ecuador, and to 
address an appeal to donor 
organizations towards meeting 
these needs. 
Appeal to governments, Na- 
tional Commissions and Inter- 
national Organizations to 
secure aid in education, science 
and culture, additional to that 
already given by Unesco, for 
refugees driven from their 
homes in the Middle East. 
Appeal, on the same basis, 
for assistance to refugee Greek 
children, and to open and ad- 
minister a special fund for 
this purpose. 
Establish a special China 
Reconstruction Fund, out of 
unused funds allocated by the 
Executive Board for emergency 
aid to China in 1949, parti- 
cularly for assistance to child 
and student refugees. 
Uneseo in Germany 
and Japan 
T a joint meeting of the 
Programme and Budget 
Commission and Official 
and External Relations Com- 
mission on September 24, the 
delegations of Poland, Czecho- 
slovakia, and Hungary, made 
it clear they were opposed to 
the Unesco programme for 
Germany. They stated forci- 
bly that they were against the 
inclusion of Germany in Unes- 
co’s. activities, so long as 
Germany was split in two. 
Later, when the matter came 
to a vote and their rejection 
plea was defeated by 25 votes 
to 3, all three delegations left 
the meeting as a protest. 
Ten days elapsed before the 
three delegations returned to 
resume their fight against 
Unesco plans in Germany. this 
time during a full dress debate, 
spread over two plenary meet- 
ings, on October 4. After a 
lively discussion, followed by a

packed public gallery, the 
three-power motion for rejec- 
tion was again turned down, 
this time by 35 votes to 4,

and Mexico abstaining. 
A Brazilian proposal, desi- 
gned to strengthen the hand 
of the Executive Board in Ger- 
many, and to bring together 
the allied powers for promo- 
tion of Unesco work there, 
was carried and incorporated 
in the Executive Board pro-

(A report on the Budget 
debate appears on page 3.) 
By the opening of the second 
week of the Conference, the 
delegates of the 47 nations, in 
commission, sub-commission or 
committee were deeply immer- 
sed in the hard work of 
shaping, for ultimate appro- 
val by the concluding plenary 
session, the technically com- 
plex programme of Unesco’s 
educational, scientific and 
cultural projects. 
On Monday, September 26, 
the Programme and Budget 
Commission adopted the re- 
mainder of the Education 
budget, and the entire Natural 
Science budget. At the same 
meeting Dr. Hugo D. Barba- 
gelata (Uruguay) confirmed his 
government's readiness to bear 
the entire cost of a Seminar 
to be held next in Monie- 
video, on Primary Education 
problems in Latin America. 
During these discussions 
Dr. G. Zook (United states) 
sought assurances that Unes- 
co’s provisions for war-handi- 
capped children adequately 
covered all handicapped chil- 
dren, and the Chinese delega- 
tion asked for the creation of 
two more Field Science Co-ope- 
ration Offices in China. The 
Israeli delegation requested 
and received assurances that 
its government could co-ope- 
rate with Unesco Middle East 
office in Cairo. 
 
Some members of the Conference delegations wore their national 
dress. Above, one of the secretaries of the Indian delegation,

The joint commissions had 
reviewed at the same meeting 
Unesco plans for Japan, and 
turned down a Philippines 
amendment, which would have 
barred Japanese experts from 
attending Unesco - convened 
meetings, until the Allied 
powers had signed a peace 
treaty with Japan. Forwarded 
to the plenary session, the 
Japanese programme of Unes- 
co was also endorsed. 
An important part of the 
business of the joint commis- 
sions on September 24 was the 
announcement by M. Torres 
Bodet that a decrease in the 
Unesco Budget had been made 
possible by the devaluation of 
Delegates to the Adminis- 
trative Commission session of 
September 26 heard the audi- 
tors report that the finances 
of Unesco were satisfactory, 
but a committee was set up to 
discuss arrears in contribution 
payments of certain member 
states. . 
At the next day’s meeting 
of this commission a generous 
gesture was made by the Uni- 
ted States delegation which 
announced that it would not 
press for the full reduction of 
the United States contribution 
to Unesco, as originally plan- 
ned. This was followed by an 
important statement reitera- 
ting United States Government 
policy on the American contri- 
bution of two-thirds towards 
non-local costs of Unesco acti- 
vities in connection with the 
Technical Assistance pro- 
gramme. 
The debate at the Pro- 
gramme and Budget Commis- 
sion session of September 28 
on Cultural Activities produced 
a proposal from the Israel 
representative that Unesco 
should organize in 1950 appro- 
priate celebrations to mark the 
bicentenary of Johann Sebas- 
tian Bach. A representative 
of the Director-General replied 
that plans for this were al- 
ready under discussion, but 
further suggestions would be 
welcome. 
Miss Myrna Loy, the film 
actress, and active member of 
the U.S. delegation, told the 
meeting : “There seems to be 
a very general idea that 
Unesco is difficult to interpret. 
It is my belief that it would 
not be difficult to interpret 
Unesco once the interpreters 
had been enlisted”, This sta- 
tement drew applause, as 
did the later comment of Sir 
John Maud of the United 
Kingdom that his delegation 
would like to include a famous 
film star among its members 
next year. Miss Loy had also 
assured the conference of film 
world's interest in Unesco. 
Spanish As Third 
Unesce Language 
LEOPOLD Sedar Seng- 
° hor, French delegate, 
Senegalese representa- 
tive in the FPrench Parlia- 
ment, and author of the 
French Constitution, added, in 
this connection, the view that 
Unesco could produce an im- 
portant contribution to films, 
but he warned the organiza- 
tion against substituting itself 
for a censorship. 
September 29 was notable for 
the liveliness of its debates. 
Outstanding was the discussion 
leading up to provisional fixa- 
tion of the Unesco 1950 Budget 
“ceiling” at $8,000,000 (dealt 
with on page 3). In the 
Procedure Commission the 
chief delegate for Mexico, 
M. Antonio Castro Leal, was 
leading his Latin American 
colleagues into an animated 
discussion, urging the intro- 
duction of Spanish as a third 
working language of Unesco. 
Even voting of 11-11 on this 
issue threw the Commission 
into deadlock, but later confe-. 
rence developments resulted in 
the Mexican resolution being 
accepted for further discussion 
at the Florence conference. 
A United States delegation 
proposal this day aimed at the 
setting up of a Unesco Head- 
quarters Commission, with the 
objective of arranging perma- 
nent headquarters in Paris for 
Unesco, was welcomed by most 
delegations as a possible means 
of whittling down present high 
maintenance costs of the Orga- 
nization. At the final plenary 
session of the conference the 
American plan was handed 
over to a seven-nation ways 
and means commission. 
The following day the Chair- 
man of the Executive Board 
announced the Board's appro- 
val of Ceylon’s application for 
membership. There were 
cheers from delegates when 
the official observer from the 
prospective 51st member state 
of Unesco, Mr L. J. de S. 
Seneviratne, thanked the 
conference from the rostrum.

ELEGATES crowded into

kish Embassy in Paris. The 
two retiring members were 
Dr. George Stoddard (U.S.) and 
Resat Nuri Guntekin (Turkey). 
The Czechoslavakian nominee, 
M. Jan Boor, proposed by the 
Polish delegate, received 8 
votes against an average 35 of 
other candidates. The plenary 
session the following day en- 
dorsed the voting of the Nomi- 
nations Committee, with the 
exception that the Czechoslo- 
vakian candidate, though not 
elected, received 15 votes, after 
speeches, pleading for impar- 
tiality, from the French dele- 
gate, M. Senghor, and M. Jean 
Piaget of Switzerland. 
Busiest week of an energetic 
fortnight ended on Saturday, 
October 1, with unanimous 
agreement of the delegations to 
the recommendation that the 
Fifth General Conference 
should take place in Florence 
in May next year. 
After the heat of the debate 
on Unesco activities in Germa- 
ny which occupied most of the 
Twelfth and Thirteenth ple- 
nary sessions of October 4, and 
the ‘winding-up” sessions of 
the various commissions and 
committees, delegates went 
into the final Fifteenth ple- 
nary meeting on the afternoon 
of October 5, with the most 
important work of the confe- 
rence ahead of them — appro- 
val of the Programme and 
Budget Commission Report. 
But there was no serious op- 
position to any of the many 
resolutions, fixing Unesco’s im- 
mensely detailed programme 
and budget, carefully presented 
to the conference by the Rap- 
porteur of the Commission, 
Mr Ww. D. Pile (United King- 
om). 
Final Programme

projectors, 
Unesco is to encourage crea- 
tion of an International Insti-

This vital work accompli- 
shed, the conference went on 
to adopt the non-programme 
resolutions, after listening to 
the texts of appeals for Middle 
East refugees and for Greek 
refugee children, and speeches,

Brazil, Professor Photiades of

With the acceptance of the 
Appropriation Resolution for 
1950 the Director-General 
requested heads of dele- 
gations to intervene with their 
National Commission and go- 
vernments in order to facili- 
tate the work of the Executive 
Board in revising the pro- 
gramme. He was referring to 
an amendment, proposed by 
Mr Luther Evans (U.S.), sup- 
ported by the French delega- 
tion, and agreed to by the 
Conference, that the Director- 
General should be exempted 
from the requirements to re- 
port to the Fifth Session on 
any matter which in the Exe- 
cutives Board's judgment was 
not urgent. 
The conference adopted the 
report of the Sub-committee 
for Technical Assistance, with 
the addition of an Australian 
amendment, providing for 
maximum consultation on the 
project between: Unesco and 
international scientific unions 
and established scientific bo- 
dies throughout the world. 
Signifying the approval of 
delegates was the applause for 
the Director-General when he 
suggested amending a proposal 
by Professor Louis Verniers 
(Belgium) for publication of 
all M. Torres Bodet’s speeches 
for Unesco, to include only the 
more important. The propo- 
sal and amendment were ac- 
cepted. 
Tribute To 
José Clemente 
Orozeo 
RS. Gladys Tillett (United 
M States) then suggested 
that the Director-Ge- 
neral and the Executive Board 
should, in conjunction with 
United Nations, consider the 
services Unesco could render to 
bring about greater under- 
standing of the Convention 
against Genocide. 
A eulogy from Mr David 
Hardman (United Kingdom) 
on the Mexican painter, José 
Clemente Orozco, was acknow- 
ledged with tributes to the 
artist from M. Torres Bodet 
and M. Antonio Castro Leal. 
Mr Hardman had asked that 
Unesco associate itself in the 
tribute to the painter, whose 
death, he said, was a great loss 
to the world of art. The con- 
ference supported this request. 
Business of the 17-day Busi- 
ness Meeting of Unesco ended 
that afternoon with the pas- 
sing by 32 votes to 3 of an 
amendment to Article 9 of the 
Organization's Constitution, 
depriving of voting powers any 
Member State with two years 
contributions unpaid. 
It fell upon M. Leo Munde- 
leer (Belgium) and M. Jean 
Sarrailh (France) to thank 
Dr. Walker, the Director Gene- 
ral and the Secretariat for 
their efforts on behalf of the 
conference, and for Dr. Walker 
to sum up that work before 
bidding his conference col- 
leagues au revoir until next 
May, in Florence.

During the General Conference many of the delegates visited the studio in Unesco House to

stations.

### 74137: United Nations Day, 24 October

  
United Nations Day - 24 October 
ACH year, United Nations Day becomes more and 
more a truly international festival, an occasion on 
which people gather together in every part of 
the world to voice their longing for peace. 
In capital cities, provincial towns and in the coun- 
tryside, men and women of all races and creeds meet to 
celebrate the birth of the United Nations Organization 
and to affirm their belief in its future. 
IN PARIS, this year, important ceremonies brought 
together many distinguished Frenchmen and women to 
take part in the various celebrations arranged by the 
United Nations Information Centre. Those attending 
a reception at the Paris Hotel de Ville heard a speech 
from M. Jaime Torres Bodet, Director-General of 
Unesco, in which he outlined the purposes of the United 
Nations and described Unesco’s important contribution 
to its work of peace. 
In addition to a formal gathering in the great amphi- 
theatre of the Sorbonne, the press, radio, cinemas and 
many of the Paris theatres all collaborated in honouring 
United Nations Day. 
IN THE ARGENTINE, important ceremonies. in 
which educational institutions of all kinds were particu- 
larly prominent, were organized at Buenos Aires. 
THE PRESS IN COPENHAGEN published special 
articles, and all Danish radio stations broadcast 
feature programmes which included educational and cul- 
tural subjects. 
THE BRITISH FOREIGN OFFICE, the Ministry of 
Education, the Specialized Agencies and non-govern- 
mental organizations arranged a United Nations Week 
in Great Britain, covering London and the rest of the 
country. Ce TE a eT Tove. ed 
IN INDIA there was a happy coincidence in the fact 
that United Nations Day fell on the same day as the 
« Divani » or « Festival of Light », a great Indian 
traditional holiday. Local authorities there organized 
many joint ceremonies to honour the two occasions. 
AUSTRALIA, which had established a National 
Committee for United Nations Day, marked the anniver- 
sary with ceremonies in big cities and remote townships 
throughout the country. oo 
IN THE UNITED STATES, a National Committee was 
responsible for a big programme of commemoration held 
simultaneously in the forty-eight States. An address 
by President Truman and proclamations by all State 
Governors were widely disseminated with the help of 
3.500 local authorities. Tens of thousands of posters 
were displayed and hundreds of thousands of leaflets 
distributed. 
Thus, all over the world, with the growing support of 
more and more peoples, the custom is being established 
of setting aside October 24 as the day for spreading 
the aims and ideals of the Uniied Nations. In years 
to come this symbolic day will become for future gene- 
rations the Festival of Nations.

### 74139: Tasks for world understanding defined at UNESCO international debate

TASKS FOR 
* * 
T HE most important new feature of Unesco’s Fourth General 
   
Conference in. Paris, last month, was an international debate at 
which members of the public were able to “sit in” on discussions 
: . of one of today’s fundamental problems: what are the duties of 
the State in the modern World? 
The idea for Unesco to hold a discussion of this kind, coinciding with 
the General Conference, was proposed by the French delegation at last 
year’s Conference, in Beirut. 
One purpose of the debate was to broaden the scope of the Conference 
by bringing the public, as it were, “inside’’, and the interest shown in the 
discussions, which took place at the Maison de la Chimie, in Paris, on 
September, 27, 28 and 29, gave ample proof of its success and emphasized 
the significance of the subject being debated. 
Each evening, three eminent personalities from among the members of 
delegations to the General Conference, presented their points of view on 
the following question: “What are the duties of the State in regard to 
education, science and culture for the purpose of ensuring a better under- 
standing between peoples, and what practical steps should be taken to 
discharge those duties?” Following these speeches, five or six “debaters” 
from different countries, took part in a discussion on the views that had 
been expressed. 
In addition to associating the general public more directly with the 
activities of the General Conference, the debate helped to define the 
prospects open to Unesco in the present day world. 
This hope was expressed by M. Torres Bodet, Director-General of 
Unesco, in his report to the General Conference in which he said 
“The very existence of Unesco shows that States, bearing an immense 
responsibility, have felt the desire to break the vicious circle of the 
old struggles for power in order to accept in full measure their duty 
towards humanity. 
“We may therefore hope that the discussion will allow us to decide on 
a more accurate conception of the economic, social, political and legal 
functions in relation to spiritual considerations.” 
Lack of space prevents the Courier from publishing the full texts of the 
speeches made by delegates from many countries, particularly representa- 
ing page, of the main opinions put forward, includes passages from 
speeches made by delegates from many countries, particularly representa- 
tive of different cultures... 
The speakers who took part in the debate were : M. Georges BIDAULT

it. If there is not an integral community the police power is effective 
“only upon a recalcitrant minority, and it is a significant thing that 
behind the very power of a state there is not merely law and its police 
power, but the authority of the community itself, its willing and 
implicit acceptance of certain standards of justice. The community 
comes first. 'We cannot create a world community by law, we cannot 
create it by police force. We can create it only by the gradual growth 
of mutual forbearance within this multi-coloured world society. 
Now, we must not claim too much for this process, we must not 
claim that the process of cultural co-operation can obviate the 
necessities of political arbitration. There are particular kinds of 
friction in any community, even in national communities, where the 
      “A new duty for the State has come into 
being. It has not only to consider its own 
people; it must consider all, even if only

### 74139: Tasks for world understanding defined at UNESCO international debate

WORLD UNDERSTANDING DEFINED 
AT UNESCO 
FHuman sensibility 
Y drawing the attention of Member States to 
the duty of creating and fostering better 
understanding between the peoples, Unesco 
FO M B 0 N A has induced us to raise the question of human 
solidarity in a novel and striking fashion at our 
Conferences. The Organization has asked us to 
(Venezuela) look into our consciences and to reflect on this 
sense of solidarity, seeking the most effective means 
of carrying into practice the spirit which inspires the Organization 
and the aims which it has set itself. 
Is not science international, by nature and definition ? Does it not 
find its native soil in every land? A famous scientist is as much 
Professor E. Zerega |B 
admired and respected abroad as in his own country, sometimes more, 
if we believe Christ's saying that “A prophet is not without honour 
  
save in his own country.” But this scientific fraternity in its various 
forms — exchanges of teachers, student fellowships and the inter- - 
national recruitment of scientific staff — can have no influence (or 
very little) on the growth of a sense of unity in public opinion, unless 
the creation of an international public opinion is brought about by 
other means, 
This sense of solidarity and understanding is indeed already found in 
statesmen, philosophers, sociologists, scientists, writers and artists who 
are well acquainted with the present-day world. These men feel as 
true members of humanity, they are conscious of the interdependence 
of mankind, and they can derive happiness, comfort and hope from a 
fine and noble action or a scientific discovery, wherever it may take 
place. They are tragically and agonisingly afflicted at the idea of 
those catastrophes, near at hand or far away, which, if they occur, 
will not be local or national but general and universal, like those 
foreshadowed in the Apocalypse. 
This state of mind and sensibility, which are still confined to a few, 
must be developed in all human beings, by giving them access to the 
great currents otf information and opening their hearts to the emotions 
of all mankind. That is the duty of the State which Unesco has 
asked us to define and hopes to see carried out in practice. 
The brotherhood of nations A 
I contend that international education, mass 
— — 
i 
Professor Jean 
an 
education, the education of youth, is a task 
: that Unesco must embark on and must be 
P A 4 ET able to demand of States, and is no more than a 
Copernican revolution in intellectual and moral 
’ attitudes in every field of spiritual life. And that 
(Switzerland) is why the problem of international education 
which I was asked to speak of tonight is such a 
difficult one, infinitely more so than is generally supposed. This 
education entails a total change in the instinctive attitude of the mind, 
a complete reversal of instinctive egocentricity and socio-centricity in 
the direction of reciprocity. 
... It is quite hopeless to depend on specialized education for the 
building up of world-mindedness if the other branches of education do 
not inculcate a sense of the solidarity and interdependence of peoples. 
I am thinking of history lessons. Provided history is not regarded 
simply as the story of kings and of battles, but, as is generally accepted 
today, a history of civilizations, their coincidence or lack of coincidence 
in time and their interdependence — then nothing can be of greater 
help to the development of an international sense. The teaching of 
geography seems particularly designed to rid us of the egocentric 
illusions I have mentioned. The teaching of languages and of litera- 
ture can help us to read the soul of foreign nations. In the teaching 
of science, the close interdependence of research and discoveries, and 
their striking international character, proceeding simultaneously in. 
different countries, with repercussions from one country to another, 
and also the interdependence of techniques — these are all fields that 
illustrate this solidarity. ~~ 
... Our generation has known only gropings and setbacks in inter- 
national life and that is not a stimulating efXample for the generations 
to come, International teaching and the introduction to international 
life must therefore be based on careful study of the complexities of 
the problem.

merely nominal self-government, where under a very clever camouflage 
of so-called people’s government the power is in actual fact con- 
centrated in the hands of a small group. 
In our eastern democracies the decisive influence is held bv the 
people and we know very well that our people want peace. We are 
trying with all means at our disposal to show to our people that they 
are not alone in this peaceful endeavour, but that they have the 
support of millions of people from countries of East and West, and 
that there is a longing for peace in North and South, East and West 
alike. This longing for peace is the only common denominator of 
the most divergent sections of mankind. We are daily working for 
the intellectual and moral solidarity of men. In this respect our 
endeavours are in full accord with the Preamble of Unesco which 
reads : “that a peace based exclusively upon the political and eco- 
nomic arrangements of governments would not be a peace which could 
secure the unanimous, lasting and sincere support of the peoples of 
the world, and that the peace must therefore be founded, if it is not 
to fail, upon the intellectual and moral solidarity of mankind”. 
It is the close relation be- 
tween human rights and the 
duties of the State, and the 
need for defining States’ du- 
ties so as to safeguard man’s 
universal rights, which inspir- 
ed Unesco to choose the sub- 
ject for the debates. Public 
recognition of its importance 
was shown by the large num-

A E are faced with the real character of social 
P rofessor Eugene WwW reality; society is composed, neither simply 
of the sum of self-sufficient individuals nor 
simply of the sum of nations, or political, territorial 
or military states ; the complete human factor 
. comprises the sum of all the individuals contained 
(Belgium) in groups of this kind, each individual belonging 
simultaneously to several different groups — family, 
religion, political party, trade union and many more. The sociological 
conception which I wish to put before you is this : this sum of inter- 
mingled groups, serving both to unite individuals whilst at the same 
time separating them from their fellows I propose to designate by the 
term social symbiosis. 
The term ’symbiosis’ is berrowed from natural sciences and it 
signifies that social groups of differing and frequently conflicting types 
are agreed not only to exist side by side but, normally, also to help 
one another. 
... Many advocate the formation of a single strong unified group to 
which all other groups would be more or less directly subordinates 
Their theory is that humanity must pass from the stage of social 
symbiosis to that of a single social group based, if necessary, on force. 
What we must realize, however, is that the chief aim of all these 
groups is to perpetuate themselves. Any of the desires made manifest 
to unite with other groups is inspired, not by the desire to merge, to 
lose their identity in the whole ; on the contrary, they desire to 
confirm and prolong their existence. It is thus clearly the duty of all 
those who understand the need and the desirability of a society 
comprising plural groups to work for the organization of social sym. 
biosis. The aim is not to eliminate different groups but to make them 
more mutually compatible : antagonisms and rivalries cannot be 
entirely eradicated but their probability can be lessened, they can be 
reduced to tolerable limits, even made to act as a stimulus. 
But, ladies and gentlemen, you will doubtless anticipate my words ; 
there is an inner logic which moves faster than I can speak : “What 
then is Unesco ? Basically surely it is a manifestation of a sym- 
biosis, an organ designed to bring about that plurality of groups 
which constitutes social symbiosis.”

A SIGHTLESS — 1} 
SOLDIER   
WORKS 
for the 
BLIND 
    
  
HE problem of educating and assisting millions of blind 
T persons, especially those in Asia and Africa, should be 
greatly reduced through a plan approved by Unesco’s 
Fourth General Conference, last month. 
After considering a report on the problems caused by the 
diversity of Braille alphabets in use in different parts of the 
world, the conference decided that Unesco should study the 
world Braille situation and, with the advice of a committee 
of experts who are due to meet this month, call an international 
conference in 1950 for the purpose of reaching agreement on 
the standardization of Braille methods. 
The conference would comprise representatives from [8 or 
19 countries, representing each of the main Braille groups, who 
would try to establish certain international principles which would 
allow the greatest degree of uniformity in Braille and would 
improve its rationalization and develop its extension. 
The article below describes the preliminary work already 
carried out for Unesco in this field by Sir Clutha MacKenzie, 
of New Zealand, who, since he was blinded in the first World 
War, has devoted his life to helping the blind. 
By Daniel BEHRMAN = 
he world’s population of 
blind persons is great 
enough to make up a 
city rivalling New York, Lon- 
don or Shanghai in size. 
An estimated 7,000,000 men, 
women and children on five 
continents either are totally 
blind or unable to see enough 
to obtain a normal education 
or normal employment. 
Only two centuries ago, a 
vast majority of them would 
have spent their lives shut off 
by a wall of darkness from 
nearly all human relation- 
ships. A sightless person, 
before the beginnings of 
blind welfare activity, lived 
as a charge upon his family... 
or scraped his existence out 
of whatever he could earn as 
a beggar. 
« The blind long to have a 
normal place—not {to be 
unwanted, miserable people 
on the edge bf society. 
Through history, there are 
many blind persons who have 
taken leading places as poets, 
musicians, philosophers and 
statesmen, but even the most 
humble of the blind yearns 
to find a way of ending the 
monotony of long hours in 
the darkness. » 
These are the aims of the 
blind, as summed up by one 
of the world’s leading blind 
welfare workers, Sir Clutha 
MacKenzie, now at Unesco 
House in Paris to study the 
problem of setting up a 
single international system of 
Braille symbols for the bljnd 
in all nations. 
Sir Clutha was totally 
blinded himself in 1915 by a 
shell during the Gallipoli 
campaign of World War I 
while serving with the New 
Zealand Expeditionary Force. 
He then became one of the 
first students at St. Dunstan’s 
Hostel for Blinded Soldiers, 
Sailors and Airmen, founded 
in London in 1915. From St. 
Dunstan’s, he returned to 
duty and edited the New 
Zealanders’ army newspaper 
in Europe, occasionally acting 
as his own front-line repor- 
ter. Once the war ended, he 
entered the field of blind 
welfare and it has become 
his life's work,

In future, when parcels of 
books bought under the 
Unesco book coupon scheme 
are being examined at frontiers, 
the answer to this question will 
be plainly shown on the parcels 
themselves. 
To save the time and trouble 
of the customs men, and the 
buyer at the receiving end, it 
has been decided that the par- 
cels shall carry a special label 
bringing them to the notice of 
the customs authorities in dif- 
ferent countries. This decision 
was taken pt a meeting of 
experts on the Book Coupon 
scheme, held at Unesco House 
from 4 to 6 October, which 
made a thorough study of 
results of the scheme since its 
inception in December 1948. 
The new «Please hurry it 
through the customs » tag is one 
small move in the general 
policy of Unesco, aimed at 
securing abolition of present 
restrictions on free movement 
of books and scientific and 
educational material. Govern- 
ments are to be approached by 
the organization, with a request 
that they reduce to the mini. 
mum customs and other forma- 
lities in respect of parcels and 
packets bearing the Unesco 
Book Coupon label. 
With facts and figures before 
them of the immense success of 
the Coupon Scheme in many 
countries, the experts had hoped 
to bring into action an exten- 
sion of the scheme to embrace 
purchases abroad of scientific 
material and educational films. 
Examination proved that the 
projected widening of the 
scheme could not be achieved 
immediately, and that any hasty 
move might compromise the 
future of the scheme. 
The idea was not dropped.

«The result is that the 
education and cultural deve- 
lopment of the blind have 
suffered. There are not suffi- 
cient readers of any one 
Braille system in Asia to 
make Braille printing econo- 
mically possible, and there 
always is the danger that a 
book may become obsolete 
overnight through an admi- 
nistrative decision changing 
the Braille system in use », 
Sir Clutha explained. 
He has been surveying 
these differences in Braille 
systems for Unesco and his 
reports were presented to 
the Unesco General Confe- 
rence in Paris last month.

Demand exceeds 
Supply 
Mest encouraging news before 
the Unesco House experts 
was that a total of Coupons 
worth $250,000 has been issued 
by Unesco in ten months. But 
the demand greatly exceeds the 
financial resources which Unesco 
can at present place at the dis- 
posal of buyers. 
France, which has so far been 
allocated 20,000 dollars’ worth 
of Coupons, thinks that she 
could dispose of Coupons up to 
$150,000. Czechoslovakia up to 
now has used 50,000 dollars 
worth, and is asking for Coupons 
totalling $ 240,000. India has 
received Coupons for $15,000, 
and is now estimating her an- 
nual needs at $200,000. 
From some of the other coun- 
tries to which Unesco had allo- 
cated $56,000 worth of free 
Coupons came welcome expres- 
sions of wishes to join the 
Coupon Scheme. Israel has just 
enrolled as a member, and 
Belgium, Italy and Burma will 
be joining shortly. 
The object of the Unesco 
Book Coupon Scheme is gene- 
rally well known. It is to help 
cultural bodies and private 
persons to overcome currency 
and other difficulties. Since the 
war these barriers have made it 
almost impossible for some 
countries to obtain books from 
abroad, particularly from hard 
currency areas. The Book Cou- 
pon is a kind of international 
currency for the purchase of 
books, issued by Unesco, and 
guaranteed by its own reserves 
of hard currency. 
Final target of Unesco is 
destruction of all restrictions on 
the free circulation of indis- 
pensable media of culture. 
A UNIVERSAL SCRIPT . 
ir Clutha believes that the 
task of unifying Braille 
systems, while a tedious 
and complicated one, can be 
successfully tackled. « The 
blind, by being in possession 
of Braille, are a good lap 
ahead of sighted people—we 
have a universal script, » he 
said. 
Braille consists of 63 sym- 
bols, based on the Roman 
alphabet because the system’s 
founder, Louis Braille, was a 
Frenchman. Most letters in 
the Roman alphabet can be 
correlated with Oriental lan- 
guages, such as « kh » or 
« ch, » which can be given 
related Braille symbols. Spe- 
cial sounds, like variants of 
«s» and « z » in Persi-Arabic 
languages, call for linking 
with their own linguistic 
families. 
Since its invention in 1829, 
Braille has been adopted in 
a standardized form by 
nearly all of the western 
world. It was transmitted to 
Asia, however, mainly by 
missionaries and teachers 
who worked in remote areas 
where they were unaware of 
what was going on elsewhere 
and often made their own 
modifications. The result is 
the situation which Sir Clu- 
tha is trying to clear up. 
ASIA’S BLIND 
n his office in Paris, he 
talks eagerly about blind 
welfare work and his own 
task of modifying Braille. 
He was knighted for his 
work with the blind in New 
Zealand. There still is much 
to be done, however, espe- 
cially in Asia where more 
than half of the world’s 
blind population is to be 
found. 
« The aim of blind wel- 
fare, » Sir Clutha summed 
up, « is to give to the blind 
the same general opportu- 
nities for a full life as are 
provided for sighted people. »

### 74150: Integration is keynote of UNESCO's 1950 education programme

INTEGRATION IS KEYNOTE OF UNESCO'S 1950 
| 
NE of the most encour- 
oO aging developments of 
Unesco’s Education 
Programme for 1950 
is the growing cohesion be- 
tween its different parts. 
The experience of the last 
two years has greatly assisted 
the clarification of the Depart- 
ment’s work and this, more 
than ever, is reflected in the 
progress being made in 
carrying out the programme. 
In general, the whole edu- 
cation programme has been 
built around three fundamen- 
tal aims : 
the interchange of expe- 
rience between individuals 
and organizations as well as 
between States ; 
3 the raising of the world’s 
_.. education standard ; 
= and the promotion of in- 
ternational understanding. 
The main task of the Educa- 
tion Department is to act as 
a centre of exchange between 
the different parts of the 
world which are doing inte- 
resting and useful education 
work, and those parts desirous 
of knowing the results. 
This so-called clearing house 
function is, however, not 
merely mechanical. It is a 
matter of judging what is 
good education and what it is 
desirable to help to spread. 
Under this category, the ma- 
jor activities for 1950 will 
include : 
(a) the development of a centre 
of educational documentation. 
Materials on the specially signif- 
icant contributions of each coun- 
try to educational theory and 
practice will be collected and ana- 
lyzed. 
(b) publication of a world hand- 
book of educational systems in- 
cluding statistics. The work was 
started in 1949 and will be conti- 
nued through 1950. When com- 
pleted, it will form an important 
source of reference. 
(c) Publication of a series of 
monographs on current educatio- 
nal topics of practical interest to 
Member States. One of the first 
to be published will be on school 
buildings, in which different types 
of school architecture suitable to 
varied conditions will be fully 
described. 
(d) Continued collaboration with 
the International Bureau of Edu- 
cation, firstly to arrange the 13th 
Annual Conference on Public Edu- 
cation ; and secondly to study the 
problems involved in making free 
compulsory primary education 
more nearly universal and of lon- 
ger duration throughout the 
world, with a view to submitting 
the result to a meeting of Minis- 
ters of Education, which it is hop- 
ed to arrange at a future date. 
Attacking Ignorance 
And Illiteracy 
HE second important task 
T of the Department will 
be concerned with Funda- 
mental Education. It is a 
recognized fact that no one 
"EDUCATION PROGRAMME 
can be an informed and res 
ponsible citizen of the modern 
world without a certain mi- 
nimum of education, nor 
without it can he achieve his 
full development as a human 
being. 
In many countries, low and 
uneven standards of education 
are intimately connected with 
poverty, ill-health, inefficient 
methods of agricultural pro- 
duction and poor social orga- 
nization. II- nations are wi- 
dely separated by differences 
of educational‘ standard, it is 
certainly difficylt for them to 
understand one another. 
Unesco considers it, there- 
fore, its duty to launch a 
world-wide attack on igno- 
rance and illiteracy, aiming at 
the eventual realization of a 
minimum standard of educa- 
tion for all peoples in all coun- 
tries. This work represents a 
common problem for both fun- 
damental education and adult 
education. Consequently in 
1950, attempts will be made 
to fuse the activities of fun- 
damental and adult education 
as far as possible. 
Much useful work of this 
kind has already been done in 
many parts of the world. But 
cach country has been acting 
more or less independently and 
often in ignorance of what 
other countries are doing.

### 74152: Dr. Beeby: an appreciation

Dr BEEBY 
AN APPRECIATION 
IGHTEEN months may 
E seem a short time in 
which to leave one’s mark 
on an Organization, but it is 
nearly half the present lifetime 
of Unesco, and in saying 
good-bye last month to Dr. C.E. 
Beeby, who has been Assistant 
Director-General for Education 
since April 1948, delegates to 
the General Conference, his 
  
friends and colleagues on the 
Secretariat, all realized with 
something of a shock how 
much his contribution to 
Unesco would be missed in 
future. 
An implacable enemy of 
vague and woolly phrases, of 
verbosity and lack of precision, 
of any attempt to disguise litt- 
le things with big pretentious

tion, shortly before he left Unesco to return to his post as Director of 
Education for New Zealand. With Dr. Beeby is Dr. Cheng Chi-Pao. who 
wrote the article which appears on this page. 
As Head of 
with Unesco’s work from the beginning. 
  
He attended 
the Constitutive Conference of 1945 in London as observer for the International Bureau of Edu- 
Recently, he represented    * 
words, he expected of his staff 
in the Education Department 
the same high standards of 
clear, logical thought and hard 
work which he always showed 
himself. 
Under his leadership, 
Unesco’s educational pro- 
gramme has become integrated 
and the members of the De- 
partment have become a team 
of colleagues who can see the 
relationship of their own work 
with that of the Department 
as a whole. 
His conception of TUnesco's 
clearing house function in 
education is now bearing fruit 
and TUnesco’s educational 
missions have, since Dr. Bee- 
by’s arrival, developed into one 
of the Organization’s most 
valuable methods of placing 
the knowledge and experience 
of other countries at the dis~ 
posal of the States who have 
need of them. He, too, has 
been responsible to a very 
large extent for the plans that 
Unesco has presented for the 
help which it can give to the 
provision of technical assist- 
ance tc under-developed coun- 
ries. 
But even more than his 
work, for the foundatiofis that 
he has laid will remain, 
Unesco will miss Dr. Beeby 
personally. His friendliness, 
is quick wit and love of 
absurdity his complete lack of 
pomposity, and his frankness 
and courage, will be missed as 
much as his wisdom and his 
stimulating belief in the value 
of the work that Unesco can 
0. 
Hence there is a genuine need 
for Unesco to act as a clear- 
ing house of information 
about Fundamental Education, 
to experiment with new 
techniques, to provide expert 
advice and to help train 
people for work in this field. 
Among the major projects 
under Fundamental Educa- 
tion for 1950 will be : 
(1) The development of u 
system of associated projects 
and agencies. Many impor- 
tant works and experiments 
are being carried out in diffe- 
rent parts of the world: the 
cultural mission in Mezico, co- 
operatives in China; the basic 
education movement in India; 
school broadcasting in the 
United Kingdom, literacy 
campaign in Thailand; and 
Village Institutes in Turkey 
are but a few of such exam- 
ples. Unesco can do a useful 
job by linking them together to 
facilitate exchange of expe- 
riences and information likely 
to be of mutual benefit to all, 
(2) The continuation of the 
Pilot Project in Haiti. This 
Project, initiated in 1947 has 
met many difficulties, bul has 
also achieved striking results. 
We will continue our effort to 
employ the technical means 
within the field of Fundamen- 
tal Education to develop the 
Marbial Valley, where the pro- 
ject is located, to test and 
develop new techniques in 
Fundamental Education, so 
that cther localities requiring 
such educational development 
can have a source of :nforma- 
ticn based on experience. 
(3) The establishment and 
operation of a regional train- 
ing and production centre. 
Fundamental Education is still 
a comparatively new and un- 
organized field. There is need 
for both personnel and mate- 
rials. We need to train per- 
sonnel for the specific tasks 
embodied in the field of Fun- 
damental Education, and we 
need to produce the necessary 
materials in the form of books 
and audio-visual aids, such 
as films, filmstrips, posters, 
etc. A training and produc- 
tion centre for the prepara- 
tion of new educational mate- 
rials and the training of aboul 
40 students during a seven- 
month period is planned for 
1950. : 
Four Ways To | 
Understanding 
ASTLY, all the projects in 
the education programme 
are concerned with deve- 
loping international under- 
standing. The projects which 
have the most direct bearing 
on this development are group- 
ed together under the special 
heading of Education for 
International Understanding. 
These important activities in- 
clude: . 
(1) Assistance to Member 
States in teaching about the 
United Nations and its Spe- 
cialized Agencies, and the 
organization of cenlres to ez- 
periment with materials pre- 
pared by United Nations and 
Unesco as a result of the 
Seminar on Teaching about 
the United Nations; 
(2) The preparation and dis- 
tribution of educational aids 
to teachers, such as hand- 
books on teaching of geogra- 
phy and history, and the Uni- 
versal Declaration of Human 
Rights. ’ 
(3) The preparation of a se- 
ries of pamphlets for youth 
organizations and the publica- 
tion of periodical bulletins on 
the international activities of 
youth and student organiza- 
tions; and 
By 
Dr. Cheng Chi-Pac 
(4) The completion of the 
international study of success- 
ful methods employed in diffe- 
rent countries to overcome the 
barriers to universal educa- 
tion; 
The study of textbooks of 
the different countries is one 
of the main features of this. 
branch of the Department’s 
work. During 1949, a model 
plan by which each country 
can analyze its own textbooks 
as aids to international under- 
standing was prepared. This 
has now been sent to all 
Unesco Member States with. 
the suggestion that they exa- 
mine their own textbooks from 
the point of view of their prob- 
able effects on world under- 
standing. Unesco has no 
power to force any country 
to make changes in its text- 
books, But it is expected that 
as a result of making surveys 
of their own textbooks, many 
countries will themselves 
decide that some revision of 
the books is desirable. 
Linking Up 
The Peoples 
N this conection, the De- 
partment finds it extre- 
mely useful to bring people 
with similar interests together 
thus effecting across frontiers 
a functional link-up between 
peoples. Here, the organiza- 
tion of missions and seminars 
plays an important part. The 
consultative education mission 
is the most direct method of 
bringing to bear on the pro- 
blems of one country the accu- 
mulated experiences of a num- 
ber of others. The internatio- 
nal seminar constitutes one of 
Unesco’s most useful con- 
tributions to the interchange 
of educational experiences and 
the fostering of international 
understanding. 
In 1950, three missions have 
been provided for, and they 
are at the disposal of any 
Member State which cares to 
ask for them. Two internatio- 
nal seminars, one on teach 
ing of Geography as an aid 
to international understand- 
ing planned to take place 
in Canada, and one on impro- 
vement of textbooks, particu- 
larly history textbooks, to 
take place in Belgium, are 
already being prepared. 
A third seminar on adult 
education, as a result of the 
Elsinore conference on Adult 
Education, will be organized, 
and will probably take place 
in Austria in the summer 
of 1950. 
There are two remaining 
items in the educational pro- 
gramme which should be men- 
tioned. One is the work with 
universities. Following the 
Universities Conference 1n 
Utrecht in 1948, a Universities 
Bureau was created, and as 
soon as the Bureau gets into 
full operation it will take over 
much of the ‘work concerned 
with Universities formerly 
carried on by the Education 
Department. 
The other is the work with 
war-handicapped children. 
Four years after the war, it is 
becoming increasingly difficult 
to separate the problems of 
war - handicapped children 
from those of handicapped 
children in general. Conse- 
quently, starting in 1950, this 
project will have to be broad- 
ened to include studies of all 
types of handicapped children. 
As in 1949, it will confine its 
activities to publishing reports 
so as to create a wider under- 
standing of the problems, and 
to co-operating with national 
and international organiza- 
tions engaged in similar work.

UNESCO'S ** STUDY ABROAD ™ 
HANDBOOK IMPORTANT 
FACTOR IN WORLD 
FELLOWSHIP SCHEMES 
NESCO’s meeting of experts on 
| exchange of persons which was 
held recently, in Paris, provided 
an opportunity for exchanges of views 
and news on cultural policies and 
marked a stage in the further develop- 
ment of international co-ordination of 
exchange of persons programmes. 
Unesco’s annual Handbook on in- 
ternational fellowships and related 
opportunities was recognized as an im- 
portant tool in this field and sug- 
gestions for expanding and improving 
its publication and distribution were 
made. 
The experts also recommended that 
Unesco assist countries which offer 
fellowships and receive foreign students 
with technical advice, continue its sta- 
tistical information on the international 
movement of students and define fields 
of study in which fellowships are re- 
quired. 
Furthermore, countries engaged in 
sending large numbers of their natio- 
nals for overseas training requested 
Unesco’s help in developing techni- 
ques for analytical study in the country 
of its needs for overseas scientific and 
educational training and the provision 
of periodic information on outstanding 
facilities for study of specific subjects 
available in various countries. These 
suggestions, it was felt, would not only 
promote additional fellowship opportu- 
nities but would also rationalize and 
co-ordinate existing programmes. 
Expert discussion also centred 
around certain specialized interchange 
programmes. In reviewing the 
Unesco survey of young people’s 
exchanges, the group suggested that 
* 
National Commissions and sponsoring 
organizations should use teachers, 
youth leaders and mass media material 
in preparing young people for their tra- 
vel abroad, that Unesco’s efforts to 
co-ordinate and publicise information 
on exchange programmes should be 
widened and an information manual to 
facilitate young peoples’ exchanges 
should be published. 
It was also suggested that 
Unesco call a meeting of youth 
experts in 1951 to carry forward co- 
ordination and expansion of efforts. 
In discussing worker’s educational 
and training exchange programmes, it 
was felt that the close collaboration 
between the International Labour Of- 
fice and Unesco in publicising pro- 
grammes in the Unesco Handbook 
and promoting further exchanges 
should be continued. Existing sche- 
mes for the exchange of primary and 
secondary school teachers were review- 
ed and Unesco’s initial efforts in 
this field were commended. 
BREAKING 
THE BARRIERS 
T HE experts discussed the deve- 
lopment of techniques for deter- 
mining the success of program- 
mes in promoting international under- 
standing. The group was sharply di 
vided between those who felt that over 
elaborate investigations would not 
achieve desired results and those who 
wished to evaluate the results of exist- 
ing programmes with a minimum of 
technical machinery in order to bette 
the administrative procedures of ex-

September 10 to 26 were surprised 
to see among the exhibition 
stands one devoted to the activities of 
Unesco. 
V Far ne to this year’s Levant 
Encouraged by the success of a simi- 
lar exhibition it organized at the Milan 
Fair last April, Unesco accepted an 
invitation to take part in the Levant 
Fair so as to make its aims and acti- 
vities better known in Southern Italy 
and South Eastern Europe. 
A stand, situated in the Gallery of 
Nations, was placed at Unesco’s dis- 
posal and enabled the Bureau of. 
Public Information to display illustra- 
ted panels, graphs and pamphlets 
covering the different aspects of 
Unesco’'s work and its practical achie- 
vements in education, culture, science 
and reconstruction. 
The representatives of the Eastern 
Mediterranean States were greatly 
interested in the illustrations of 
Unesco’s werk on behalf of the refugee 
children of Greece and the Middle 
East. 
At the suggestion of the organizers 
of the Fair, a “Unesco Day” was held, 
on 25 September, in the great amphi- 
theatre of the Adriatica University. 
The Deputy Director of Cultural 
Relations at the Italian Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs, M. Orlandini, sent a 
telegram to M. Torres Bodet, Director- 
General of Unesco, informing him of 
the success of this Day, and including 
the following passage: 
“Unesco Day has just been cele- 
brated in the presence of representa- 
tives of the Government, delegations 
of several foreign universities, and a 
very large public. The Rector of the 
University, M. Presta, and the speakers 
who followed him emphasized the 
great importance of Unesco's aims 
and the work it is doing for science, 
education and culture in order to 
promote understanding between the 
peoples and to contribute to a fruitful 
and lasting peace”. 
change schemes. It was decided that 
any study of the effects of exchange 
programmes should be limited in scope 
and related to the practical needs of 
programmes. 
One of the major problems facing 
all administrators in this field is the 
many barriers — legal, economic and 
academic — which impede, to a greater 
or lesser degree, the movement of per- 
sons for educational purposes. In sur- 
veying this problem, it was agreed that 
it was part of a larger problem of bar-

riers to travel faced by all persons and 
currently under study by the United 
Nations. It was also felt that as the 
problem of barriers arose primarily at 
the national level it could best be met 
by action within member States. 
It was urged that Unesco’s role in 
this field was to define clearly and 
make known the various obstacles 
which obstruct the movement of per- 
sons and to publicise current proposals 
by States and groups of States to re- 
duce these barriers. os

TO BE EXTENDED 
| IN 1950  
HE Fourth Session of the Gene- 
ral Conference authorised a 
considerable increase in the 
exchange of persons programme of 
Unesco, both with respect to infor- 
mation and clearing-house activitics 
and in the number of Unesco-finan- 
ced fellowships available for the 
year 1950. 
The publication of “STUDY 
ABROAD”, Volume I, during 1948 
and Volume II in November of this 
year has provided the basic infor- 
mation for the extension of Uncsco’s 
planning and advisory scrvices in 
the whole field of international 
educational exchange. 
The first major cvent in the ex- 
tension of this part of the pro- 
gramme was a meeting of cxperts 
on fellowships and related problems, 
held at Unesco House in September, 
attended by individuals from four- 
teen countries and four United Na- 
tions agencies. This group, compo- 
sed of administrators of cultural 
relations programmes from five 
continents, commended Unesco’s 
work tn the information field, and 
urged development of further stu- 
dies and advisory services. 
UNESCO FELLOWSHIPS 
INCREASED 
URING 1950 a meeting of 
experts will be called, in col- 
laboration with the Internat- 
ional Labour Office, to discuss 
ways of increasing activities in 
the field of cultural exchanges 
of industrial and agricultural wor- 
kers. Later in the year, in connec-’ 
tion with the International Bureau 
of Education/Uncsco Conference, a 
group of cxperts will discuss ways 
of increasing and cxtending pro- 
grammes for the international ex- 
change of teachers. 
Special efforts will be made 
during 1950 also to extend Unesco’s 
current enquiries into organizations 
and programmes promoting the 
educational exchange of young 
people. The Supplement to Volume 
Ii, to appear in the Spring of 1950, 
will contain an extensive listing of 
_opportunitics for vacation study, 
which will be of particular interest 
to young people and students 
throughout the world. 
The General Conference authori- 
sed an increase in the number of 
Unesco-financed fellowships from 
20 to 55. This increase was explain- 
ed by the extension of the fellow- 
ship programme, approved at Bei- 
rut, to include under-developed 
areas and trust territories. During 
the course of the year Unesco fel- 
lowships designed to promote stu- 
dies in fields directly related to the 
programme of Unesco, will be allo- 
cated to various Mcmber States. 
In addition, five fellowships 
were authorised for the study of 
teaching about the United Nations. 
These fellowships are planned to 
implement a resolution of the Eco- 
nomic and Social Council and form 
part of Unesco’s collaboration with 
the United Nations in promoting 
teaching about the United Nations 
system.

T= over-all pattern of 
Unesco Reconstruction 
programme for 1950, 
as approved by the 
Fourth General Conference, 
follows much the same lines 
as that of 1949. But it is 
an enlarged pattern, 
bringing in more areas 
where reconstruction is 
badly needed, 
The emphasis is gradually 
shifting from the mechani- 
cal fulfilment of emergency 
requirements, and with 
greatly limited resources, to 
the marshalling of public 
endeavour and goodwill for 
the further alleviation of 
educational, scientific and 
cultural needs. 
Directly concerning the 
Unesco Secretariat and 
PATTERN 
widening its scope of res- 
ponsibility, is the Emer- 
gency Action resolution 
agreed to by the Conference. 
This instructed the Director 
General to take action to 
assist in meeting educatio- 
nal, scientific and cultural 
needs, not only of victims 
of war, but of several other 
modern tragedies. . 
This decision to widen the 
range of the reconstruction 
activities was hastened by 
the recent earthquake disas- 
ter in Ecuador. To help the 
victims of this catastrophe, 
Unesco, acting on another 
resolve of the conference, 
will co-operate with United 
Nations and other Speciali- 
zed Agencies concerned with 
aiding these stricken people, 
and will address an appeal 
to donor organizations to 
contribute towards meeting 
their needs. These include 
gifts of books for the libra- 
ries of Quito, teaching 
equipment for schools, and

The Republic of Ecuador, bounded on the West by the Pacific Ocean, with the Andes mountains 
running throughout its length, and spreading out in the East as far as the vast Amazon basin, 
became an independent state in 1830. Its capital. Quito, was devastated by earthquakes in 
1775 and 1797. 
On August 5, this year. the town of Ambato the country’s fourth largest city, 100 miles from Quito, 
was shaken by one of the worst earthquakes in history. 
In the space of a few moments, between five and six thousand people were killed and the 
exact total of those missing and homeless has not yet been estimated. 
A few days dfter this catastrophe, Mr. Walter H.C. Laves, Assistant Director-General of Unesco. 
on behalf of M. Torres Bodet, the Director-General, sent a telegram to the Government of Ecua-

In it, Mr. Laves expressed the “deep sympathy and fellow-feeling” 
“is based not only on human fraternity said Mr. Laves,

this, Unesco’s General Conference, at its recent session in Paris, issued a world appeal for help

additional resources have 
been received towards help-

### 74159: Why we fight

UNESCO COURIER — Page 12 
73 HY WE FIGHT. During the War, while the world struggled to 
determine its future, the United Nations illustrated their aims in 
a remarkable film whose title the Courier has taken to express 
the peaceful aims of UNESCO, to-day. 
The Constitution of UNESCO proclaims the basic aims which deter- 
mine its action, and in these pages the Courier is presenting pictorially 
the essential themes of this fight for peace in which no cannons speak 
— a Highs whose outcome is as vital as that of the struggle which ended 
in 1945. 
The duties incumbent on all men and women in the fight for peace 
were recently defined by M. Jaime Torres Bodet, Director-General of 
‘Unesco, when he spoke at the United Nations Day ceremony, held at 
the Paris City Hall, on October 24, 
~ Below, we publish extracts from this speech. 
x kk 
HE war which has recently wrought such havoc, was a crisis without precedent in 
T history. Begun in 1914, with an interval more apparent than real of twenty years, 
it ‘attained between 1939 and 1945 such proportions that we should today feel 
no surprise that peace is so difficult to establish, but rather wonder that civilization did 
not sink without trace during the storm, and that even before peace has been signed, 
the peoples had the wisdom to evolve a law designed to bind them all. 
We have barely started to blaze the trail of international co-operation through the 
darkness, our hands still stained with blood. We know that the task will be a harsh 
one, but we know, too, that there is no work more urgent or worthier of our devotion. 
Today all problems are universal; neither economics, education nor health can any 
longer be treated solely on national lines. Mankind has at Jong last realized this unchal- 
lengeable truth: its life is a single whole and its future indivisible. From now on, no 
race, no nation, can either owe salvation to, or seek it for, itself alone. For years it was 
said that collective security was an impracticable theory. Events have swiftly shown 
the fatuity of that assertion. The only security is collective security; and in our day 
collective means world-wide. The temporary check suffered by this principle was due 
not to the ideal itself, stated before the war by the League of Nations, but rather to the 
dangerous spirit of passivity with which the peoples received it, as though they saw in it 
an encouragement to sloth, a pretext for negligence and a premium on irresponsibility. 
Peace is only a finer name for work, for daily self-sacrifice. Or if we prefer, it is the 
collective name for all occupations and all skills aimed at serving humanity. Peace is 
not a rampart, erected once and for all against the forces of evil. Peace is man’s dwelling, 
which must constantly be rebuilt and strengthened, enlarged, adapted to changing needs, 
for as long as man survives and because man survives. 
As a result of the obstacles against which the United Nations have inevitably stumbled, 
the impatient lose hope on finding once again that peace calls for vigilance as stern and 
unceasing as in war. In so doing, they discover merely that collective security can never 
be a synonym for the collective neglect of duties incumbent on all and on each one. 
We must not hesitate to repeat, on every occasion and in whatever words and tones 
suit best, that the measure of peace’s worth is the degree of freedom and justice which 
it secures for the world 
We have been shown clearly enough that there is no victory to be won in modern 
war ; for the conquered there is suffering and humiliation; and for the conqueror, suffering 
and responsibility. 
All‘European wars, said Voltaire, are civil wars. In the twentieth century his formula 
applies to the whole earth. In our world, which shrinks progressively as communications 
become swifter, all wars are civil wars; all battles are battles between fellow-citizens, 
nay more, between brothers. 
...Through the Food and Agriculture Organization they concern themselves with the 
needs of a world which must eat to live. Through the International Labour Organization 
they co-ordinate endeavours to secure working conditions which are in accord with social 
justice. Through the World Health Organization they combat disease and contribute 
to bringing health to unhealthy regions. Through UNESCO they endeavour to increase 
international understanding by ensuring the spread of education, science and culture. 
The work of these Specialized Agencies does not always capture the interest of the 
general public as much as it deserves. Usually the newspaper reader does not attach 
much importance to an anti-malaria campaign, or to the ratification of a Convention on 
Women’s Hours of Work, or an agreement on the agricultural resources of Polynesia, 
or a pilot project in Fundamental Education in Haiti. He is more concerned with the 
political discussions proceeding in the limelight of actuality. 
In the final analysis, the most urgent political questions are no more than the conse- 
quence of age-long chronic problems, economic and social, ethical and educational, pro- 
blems ili-stated and ill-resolved. In every-political issue there lies latent a history, some- 
times centuries old, of incalculable and disastrous technical shortcomings. 
Undoubtedly, it is of very great importance to decide who is to rule over a particular 
area of the earth, for it may happen that such a decision may threaten the peace we need 
in order to rebuild a civilization in ruins. But if we take a truly historical view, the most 
urgent task is to satisfy the manifold necessities of men, by devoting to that end all the 
resources available through international co-operation. Political solutions merely cure 
the symptoms; and they do not always do that much. Economic and social solutions 
go to the very roots of the evil. 
In the few years of their existence, the several Institutions making up the complex 
system of the United Nations have been able to do no more than plot the course they 
must follow in the future. Let us not grudge them the support they need. Let us not 
despair of their success, for that would be to despair of humanity itself. 
A rule of justice such as the San Francisco Charter offers us, is not born full-fledged 
in the moment of its acceptance by the plenipotentiaries of governments, nor even later 
when it is ratified by the parliaments of the peoples. Such a rule must be ratified by 
every man, at every moment, everywhere and by all his acts.

TRYGVE LIE ‘commends UNESCO'S work 
  
  
nw ArM commendation” for Unes- 
co's work in supplying urgent 
educational assistance to Arab 
children in Middle Eastern refugee 
camps, was expressed in a tele- 
ram received October 13, at Unesco 
eadquarters, from Trygve Lie, 
- Secretary General of the United 
Nations Organization. The telegram, 
addressed to Director-General Jaime 
Torres Bodet, declares that an Advi- 
sory Committee on Palestine Relief 
which recently met at Lake Success 
has associated itself with Mr. Lie, 
“in expressing warm commendation 
for the valuable work being done” 
by Unesco in its programme of 
urgent aid to Arab children. 
Reference was made in Mr. Lie's 
message to the thirty-odd Unesco- 
sponsored schools which were im- 
provised this year with the help of 
such organizations as the Internation- 
al Red Cross and the American 
Friends Service Committee. These 
schools, located in Syria, Transjor- 
dan, the Lebanon and the Gaza area 
for Palestine Refugees 
of Palestine, are designed to provide 
elementary instruction to homeless 
children. Conceived by Unesco as 
emergency measures, they are part 
of an integrate United Nations cam- 
paign to relieve the physical and 
moral sufferings of several hundred 
thousand victims of the Palestine 
war. 
Taking note of an appeal for aid 
to Arab children refugees issued by 
the Fourth Session of Unesco's 
General Conference, the UN Secre- 
tary General stated : “The recent 
actions of Unesco's General Confe- 
rence, taking cognizance of the si- 
tuation of the Palestine refugees are 
most gratifying. I trust that existing 
cooperative arrangements between 
Unesco and field missions of In- 
ternational Red Cross Organizations 
and the American Friends Service 
Committee in their respective areas 
of administration can be continued 
and strengthened”.

lppeal on behalf 
of gheck children 
tress. In spite of the ordeals of the 
second World War, which have blunt- 
HE General Conference of Unesco 
meeting in plenary session, ur- 
gently «appeals to the Govern- 
ments of Member States, to the 
National Commissions and to interna- 
tional organizations on behalf of the 
340,000 Greek refugee children from 
the northern provinces al present liv- 
ing in makeshift camps or in hastily 
requisitioned buildings. They are 
without schools, teachers, teaching ma- 
terial, clothing, medical attention and 
a social and cultural environment cap- 
able of meeting their essential needs. 
Out of 10,000 schools, 7,625 have been 
completely destroyed or badly damag- 
ed. In the educational field alone 
the losses amount to more than 50 
million dollars. } 
Instead of the relief which the end 
of the war brought to almost every 
country, the situation in Greece today 
is worse than during the bitter years 
of 1940-1944. Nine years of incessant 
ftghting have reduced the children of 
this country to an indescribable state 
of physical debility and moral dis- 
ed human sensibilities, we cannot 
but be moved at the thought of these 
340,000 children whom it ts necessary 
to .save from ignorance and from re- 
volt against an inhuman destiny. 
The sense of continuity and of cul- 
tural influences needs no rekindling in 
regard to Greece, which gave birth to 
the art, science and philosophy that 
are ours today. All those who share 
the advantages of modern civilization 
know well what they owe to its Helle- 
nic Sources. 
Resolved to give effective help to the 
Greek refugee children. Unesco is 
anxious to find the means necessary 
for this work of mercy. 
It therefore launches this appeal 
with confidence. In the name of civi- 
lization as well as of humanity it asks 
for a gesture of gratitude and solida- 
rity which will help education, science 
and culture to flourish once more on 
the devastated soil of Greece. 
{E RIGHTS OF MAN. — In response to an appeal by the United Nations and in particular by 
J, the press in all parts of the world is helping to make known the Universal Declaration of 
Rights. In October, for example, the American newsmagazine “Time”, describing the Decla- 
s summing up man’s aspiration in 30 articles, published four drawings from a photographic 
illustrating the Universal Declaration, and placed in the entrance corridor of UN Headquarters 
Success. The photos above were taken from the same exhibition.

education of these refugees will not be able to meet 
all needs unless a big collective effort brings them 
immediate relief. 
These children cannot be brought up on bread alone. 
Like other children, they have the right to learn, to 
develop themselves and to grow up into men and 
women. Unesco wants to enable them to do so by 
providing them, in the camps where they are forced 
to live, with the schools, books, materials and teachers 
;hey need. And those are what Unesco is asking 
for. To condemn these children to ignorance would 
be to condemn men and women to despair. If the 
world of tomorrow were to be peopled by desperate 
souls, it would be doomed to the most atrocious of 
wars, 
Unesco therefore appeals to its Member States, 
the National Commissions and international organiza- 
tions to co-operate in a charitable work which is 
justified by the most natural of human sentiments as 
well as by the duty of constructing morg stable 
defences of peace in the minds of men.  
Help for the people of countries devastated by war. One of the most urgent 
problems UNESCO is tackling is to help Greek refugee children, like the ones 
shown above, driven from their homes by 
war,

### 74163: The Question of race and the democratic world

THE QUES TION of RACE 
AND THE DEMOCRATIC WORLD 
by Dr. Arthur RAMOS, Head of Unesco’s Social Sciences Department 
While endeavouring to make known and understood the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights, UNESCO must also encourage the creation of conditions favourable to their 
application. 
One of the important ways it can do this is by fighting against all forms of racial pre- 
judice—a task which the UN Economic and Social Council has already requested it to 
undertake. 
It is by seeking and assembling historical scientific data on racial questions, and in 
making them widely known, that UNESCO can strike a useful blow in this fight. 
Already itis carrying out preliminary investigations into present day fallacies concern- 
ing racial questions, and the results will be given wide publicity. 
organization of the post- 
war world, particular ac- 
count must be taken of an- 
thropology. No other science 
has been so deflected from its 
true ends. In its name, whole 
nations have resorted to con- 
flict, to defend the false ideal 
of racial or ethnic supremacy. 
It is, therefore, entirely natu- 
ral that anthropology, restored 
to its proper place and strip- 
ped of the myths in which it 
.had been veiled, should now 
deliver its scientific message to 
the world. 
‘War is the most serious 
example of a lack of balance 
in communities. Its causes are 
many and complex, but the 
form it takes is always strife 
between men - peoples, races 
and civilizations. Regarded, in 
its accepted modern sense, as 
the « general science of men », 
-anthropology is no longer a 
mere descriptive or illustrative 
study of the so-called « primi. 
tive » peoples, but is, at any

rate for some, a science of 
« human relations ». 
The objective attempt to es- 
tablish the importance of these 
variable factors inevitably pro- 
duces the normative attitude, 
which today is rightly one of 
the most essential objects of 
what is known as «applied 
anthropology ». This branch of 
science, at first merely a tech- 
nical means of securing better 
treatment for colonial peoples, 
is now concerned with the 
more far-reaching task of ana- 
lyzing and adjusting human 
relations. 
Before suggesting rules or 
measures for correcting and 
preventing lack Of racial bal- 
ance in the world of foc-mor-

turn back for a moment and 
take a general look at this 
tremendous history of the rela-

ween races. The mythology of

of Social Sciences has begun 
quarterly publication of an Inter- 
national Social Sciences Bulletin 
designed to act as a Iink be- 
tween specialists in different 
countries and Unesco, and to 
spread knowledge of the activi-

ces : the International Associa- 
tion of Economists, the Interna- 
tional Association of Compara- 
tive Law, the International Poli-

International Association of 
Sociology. The formation of an 
international association of 
social psychology is also planned. 
A scheme to co-ordinate the 
exchange of social science infor- 
mation has been completed and 
should make possible an exten- 
sion of the services of documen- 
tary analysis. In point of fact, 
abstracting and bibliographical 
index services are channels of 
communication essential to any 
science and more particularly to 
those of relatively recent origin.

METHODS IN POLITICAL 
SCIENCE. The work entitled 
“Enquiry into Political Science” 
summarizing the present position 
regarding the teaching of research 
and the methodology of political 
_ science during the past thirty 
years, to be published in French 
and English by Unesco at the 
end of 1949, will be widely dis- 
tributed in all countries. 
has always been adopted, at 
various periods of history, 
when a civilization at its ze- 
nith attempted to rationalize 
its « ethnocentric » feelings. 
As regards psychological 
« grading », it was Aristotle 
who sought to define the diffe- 
rences between the free man 
and the slave. It was the view 
of the Greek philosopher that 
those differences did not deri- 
ve from the vicissitudes of the 
environment or society, but 
were in fact « gradings» pres- 
cribed by nature. According to 
the same train of reasoning, 
some « races» are destined to 
command, others to obey. 
| Grafting oo 
of Culture 
HE contrary view of the 
T Sophists, who maintained 
that these inequalities 
were merely a man-made 
convention, was accepted by 
many people, including certain 
politicians and generals of 
ancient times like Alexander 
the Great, who even advocated 
intermarriage between the 
conquering Greeks and the 
barbarians. Christian huma- 
nism gave a new turn to this 
old dispute by preaching the 
doctrine of the fundamental 
equality of all human beings. 
We have seen that, in hu- 
man relations, the “racial” 
technique has led to one of 
the greatest states of disequili- 
brium that exist, namely war. 
The present century has paid 
tribute in the shape of two 
great wars of the European 
nations, wars of which there 
were many causes; but one 
cause was undoubtedly the 
philosophy of racial domina- 
tion espoused by several na- 
ions. 
‘We see then, in the last 
analysis, that racialism is a 
direct result of Europeaniza- 
tion and imperialism. This is 
amply proved by the research 
engaged in by contemporary 
European sociologists and 
anthropologists themselves. 
Economic and cultural supre- 
macy leads to a {feeling of 
“ethnocentricity’, and this is 
rationalized in biological terms 
of racial supremacy. Every- 
thing, in the last resort, is 
reduced to “methods of domi- 
nation”. 
It is on the peoples of 
Europe that the results of 
having had to accept domina- 
tion by the “master races” 
have borne most heavily and 
disastrously. Cultural disequi- 


### 74164: Political scientists form first international association

POLITICAL SCIENTISTS 
FORM FIRST INTERNATIONAL 
ASSOCIATION 
NEW organization in the 
field of social sciences—the 
: International Political 
Science Association—was set up 
in Paris at a conference held 
under the auspices of Unesco’s 
Social Sciences Department from 
September 12 to 16. 
Meeting at Unesco House. 
scientists from 17 countries set 
up a Provisional Executive Com- 
mittee with Professor Quincey 
Wright. of the University of 
Chicago as chairman, and Pro- 
fessor M. Bridel, University of 
Lausanne, and Dr. W. Brogan, 
University of Cambridge, as 
vice-chairmen. Professor Fran- 
cois Goguel, of the Institut 
d'Etudes Politiques, Paris, is the 
Association's first executive se- 
cretary. 
The Association will work to 
stimulate the creation of poli- 
tical science groups in countries 
where the study of political 
phenoniena is not vet recogniz- 
ed as a distinct academic disci~ 
pline. Ab present, pic fessional 
associations of poiitical science 
specialists exist only in Canada, 
France, India and the United 
States, although plans are under 
way to form groups in other 
countries, including the United 
Kingdom. 
With the recently established 
associations of Economics and 
Sociology. the Political Science 
Association should become an 
important instrument for fur- 
thering international wunder- 
standing. 
- viduals 
Joss of 
 
librium has led to processes 
whose favoured form today is 
the transfer of cultural 
characteristics from one group 
to another (the “grafting” of 
culture). Cedric Dover has 
provided us with a masterly 
analysis of the half-castes in 
India, those types of men who 
oscillate between two conflict- 
ing kinds of culture. They 
are the men whom Park and 
Stonequist have described as 
“marginal” man, an admir- 
able expression meaning indi- 
who live on the 
borderland of two civiliza- 
tions or two ethnic groups, 
but who fail to attain a 
balance between the two. 
The studies conducted by 
contemporary sociologists and 
anthropologists into cultural 
contacts, with particular re- 
ference to those transfers of 
culture between 
groups, reveal all the results 
of contacts between two or 
more types of culture. As 
these authors show us, the 
usual results of this state of 
things are acceptance, com- 
promise and reaction. But in 
most cases, despite an appa- 
rent, superficial equilibrium, 
there is a clash produced by a 
reaction against these trans- 
fers of culture, 
Objective analysis of all the 
results of contacts between 
races and civilizations has led 
some observers to propose 
certain steps for safe-guarding 
so-called “primitive” peoples 
against the various attempts 
summarily to impose on them 
the methods of the ruler 
nations, that is to say, gene- 
rally speaking, the European 
whites. After the First World 
‘War, Britisn colonial policy 
registered some progress by 
introducing “indirect rule” 
(“Gouvernement indirect”, 
indirekte Vorwaltung). 
Applied Social 
Anthropology 
TRUCK by the demorali- 
zation caused by the 
breaking up of the tribal 
and cultural units, the flight 
of the natives, the loosening 
of social and political ties, the 
the characteristic 
marks of culture, the “disillu- 
sioned melancholy” and so 
forth, and also by the inevi- 
table repercussion of this state 
of things on economic output, 
the British administrators re- 
called many native chiefs who 
had been banished from their 
territories and reinstated them 
as leaders of their former 
subjects. 
They also tried to recons- 
truct, so far as they could, the 
aboriginal cultural framework 
which was in process of di- 
sappearance or dissolution. 
This “indirect rule”, ie. rule 
exercised through the native 
chiefs, was designed to repair 
the serious damage previously 
caused to the natives’ tradi- 
tional civilization. And the 
seal was set on this policy by 
the establishment of institu- 
tions which set about trying to 
give concrete effect to the li- 
beral principles of applied 
social anthropology. 
Several other nations have, 
since the 1914-1918 war, 
pursued an enlightened policy 
in regard to ethnic minorities. 
The work done by the Danes 
as regards their Eskimoes 
should be mentioned ; anthro- 
pologists have, at various 
congresses. constantly suggest- 
ed steps that should be taken 
for the preservation and 
defence of the culture of these 
Arctic peoples. 
In the United States, too, 
after many years of vain 
different 
effort, the policy of protecting 
the Indians seems to have 
become more humane and 
scientific. Here it is a 
question not only of protecting 
the Indians’ ‘‘reserves’”, but 
of respecting the characteris- 
tics of their civilization, 
material or otherwise; liberal 
protective measures of an 
economic kind have even been 
taken as regards the inheri- 
tance of tribal land that had 
formerly been taken from the 
natives. 
In Brazil, the National Ser- 
vice for the Protection of the 
Indians, mainly through its 
authorized spokesman, General 
Rondon, has fought for a 
policy of cordial and peaceful 
co-operation with the native 
masses who are still scattered 
throughout the vast area of 
the country. The results have 
been highly encouraging. 
In this humanitarian and 
scientific movement in applied 
anthropology the religious 
missions are making every 
effort to co-operate, ‘ 
The work accomplished be- 
tween the two wars shows us 
what lines to follow for the 
future. Much, indeed, remains 
to bz done, and much to be 
corrected. The violence of the 
last war shows us clearly that 
men are still unbalanced. In 
many countries, contacts be- 
tween groups and castes conti- 
nue to be dominated by misun- 
derstanding and hostility. In 
some, racial antagonism 
breaks out in hatred and 
violence. Anti-semitism and 
anti-negro feeling are still two 
disagreeable phenomena. And 
in its contacts with so-called 
“primitive” peoples, colonial 
policy still reveals features 
that hark back to the early 
days of European exploitation. 
One cause of the recent war 
was a conflict between racial 
castes, brought about by a 
false philosophy of racial 
supremacy. The first task, 
then, will be to correct this 
odious frame of mind scientifi- 
cally. The working must be 
laid bare of that ‘historical 
rationalization”, which reach- 
ed its zenith in European 
racialism, beginning with Go- 
- bineau and Chamberlain and 
ending with Rosenberg. The 
ideological battle is just as 
important as the military 
battle fought by armies. 
Disarmament of the mind can 
only be achieved through a 
reasonable, humane and scien 
tific policy, designed to bring 
about harmonious contact 
between he different races of 
the world. 
Enyé amé= 
“He is a Man” 
HIS is the new humanism 
we all hope will triumph 
in the post-war world. It 
involves, not the imposition of 
the ways of life and culture by 
a dominant nation but the 
democratic view of existence, 
Westermann reminds us 
that the Ewe of Dahomey, 
when speaking of a cherished 
friend, say enyé amé — “he 
is a man”. For their enemies, 
for egotistical and cruel people 
(including Europeans), they 
reserve the expression menyé 
amé — “he is not a man”. 
These expressions correspond 
to the Latin humanus and 
inhumanus, and reveal an 
empirical view of human na- 
ture. Only those who as Te- 
rence says, bring scientific 
curiosity to bear on human 
affairs, with a generous desire 
to help to remove conflicts 
between human beings, truly 
deserve the name of men.

### 74165: Scientists "in front line"

SCIENTISTS 
“IN THE FRONT LINE”   
Field Science Co-operation Offices is precisely in line 
with the intentions of the founders of Unesco. 
Science had to be included in the organization because 
it affords perhaps the most striking example of the unity 
of humanity, and also because the understanding of the world 
of nature alone permits its control, and hence the raising of 
the standard of life of millions of our fellowmen in those 
farflung countries which, perhaps by a series of historical 
accidents, have remained underdeveloped. 
“In the building of a better world, the fostering of culture 
without science and technology would become a mockery ; 
and the attempt to spread education without spreading decent 
minimum standards of freedom from disease and malnutri- 
tion would only lead to a discontent worse, and more justi- 
fied, than before. 
“Hence the watchword, All Aid to the Scientists and Tech- 
nologists in the Front Line! While not neglecting the due 
provision of facilities for the men in the great centres of 
science and technology to meet together, to publish, and to 
work for the advancement of knowledge, help must urgently 
be sent to the less favoured areas. 
“Whether it is a Chinese engineer building a bridge on the 
borders of Mongolia, or a Haitian entomologist studying insect 
carriers of disease through the microscope in a tropical grass 
hut, or an Arabic successor of al-Razi teaching chemistry to 
young Iraquis, these are the men who stand at the invisible 
foeal points of the advance of civilization. 
“These are the men who need, and most fully deserve, all 
possible help. The International Science Co-operation Ser- 
vice which earlier scientists hoped for, is now in being — let 
it not fail for lack of means.” 
These are the concluding paragraphs of a booklet “Science 
Liaison, Unesco” describing the Unesco Field Science Co- 
operation Offices obtainable from Unesco House.

A prediction that natural 
science, whose revolu- 
tionary advances in recent 
years have plunged man- 
kind into the maelstrom of 
social upheaval, will yet 
lead us safely through to a 
better world, was made by 
Professor Arthur B. Lamb, 
of Harvard University at 
Atlantic City recently. 
“With the advance of 
science”, said Professor 
Lamb, “a host of favorable 
forces will operate on man- 
kind’s behalf : his ever-in- 
creasing power; his wider 
and deeper understanding of 
his environment, of himself, 
and of the social organism; 
his enhanced realization of 
the unity of the human fa- 
mily;his heightened intellec- 
tual activity resulting from 
the eager and widespread 
prosecution of science ; 
and, best of all, the increas- 
ing myriads of men and 
women with active and train- 
ed intellects available to 
stasm and objectivity of the 
scientist. 
“By these means mankind 
will master his difficulties 
and achieve a richer and 
more significant existence. 
Our watchword should then 
be not to falter but with 
confidence to redouble our 
efforts toward the progress 
of science.”

launched. The Departmental

of the provinces and the 
Matriculation Board could 
perhaps be influenced to in-

departments should be soli- 
cited by the National Com- 
mission.” 
EXPLAINING 
SCIENCE TO THE 
WORLD 
T HERE is a great demand 
for popular science ar- 
ticles throughout the world, 
particularly in underdeve- 
loped territories, where the 
need is, as yet, largely un- 
satisfied. 
An indication of the 
extent to which there is a 
desire to read popular 
science articles is given 
through the fortnightly 
Unesco Features Service. 
There appears in each 
issue of this Service a co- 
lumn -called “Science and 
You” written by Maurice 
Goldsmith of the Section for 
the Popularization of Scien- 
ce in the Natural Sciences 
Department. This column 
has probably ome of the 
widest circulations through- 
out the world of any po- 
pular science articles at pre- 
sent being written. 
Press clippings sent to 
Unesco show that the co- 
lumn has been published in 
_at least eleven countries. 
FOOD AND PEOPLE 
R EPORTS reaching Unesco 
show how its “Food 
and People” campaign to 
stimulate discussions about 
and understanding of the 
problems of world popula- 
tion and world food resour- 
ces, is being taken up in all 
parts of the world. 
In London, last month, 
the third of a series of 
briefing courses on the sub- 
ject, designed to equip peo- 
ple to play their part in 
Unesco's campaign, was 
organized by the United Na- 
tions Association and the 
Council for Education in 
World Citizenship. The 
course was attended by 
extra-mural lecturers, tutors 
and discussion group lea- 
ders. 
Publication in Dutch of 
some of Unesco's Food and 
People pamphlets has also 
begun. The first to appear, 
called “Komt er Honger” 
by Aldous Huxley and Sir 
John Russell, can be obtain- 
ed directly from the pub- 
iishers, Stichting IVIO West- 
einde 13, Amsterdam. 
In South America, during 
the period May to Septem- 
ber, four meetings were or- 
ganized by the Centre of 
Scientific Co-operation for 
Latin America, in collabora- 
tion with scientific organi- 
zations in the different 
countries where the meet- 
ings took place. The ini- 
tiative for the meetings 
which took place in Monte- 
video, Lima, Quito and San- 
tiago was taken by 
Unesco’s Field Science Of-

A SOUTH SEAS 
OBSERVATORY 
T HE Bosscha Sterrewacht 
Observatory at Lembang 
in Indonesia, which was 
seriously damaged during 
the war, is to receive malc- 
rial assistance organized by 
Unesco. 
American and Dutch as- 
tronomers are collaborating 
to ensure the construction 
of a new type of astronomi- 
cal telescope, consisting of 
two mirrors, one of them 
3 ft. in diameter. 
The Bosscha Observatory 
is situated in what the fa- 
mous astronomer Dr. Gerard 
P. Kuiper of the University 
of Chicago Yerkey's Obser- 
vatory describes as « one of 
the most beautiful spots on 
earth ». 
The opportunities for 
good research work at this 
observatory are great, be- 
cause of its favourable loca- 
tion 7° south of the 
Equator, which makes the 
southern stars visible; and 
its adequate elevation, 4,200 
ft, which ensures a good 
climate. 
The observatory was heav- 
ily damaged during the 
war and the young Director 
and his two assistants died 
at the hands of the Japan- 
ese. Chicago University and 
Yerkey Observatory, the 
University of Leiden, Hol- 
land, the University of Lou- 
cain, Belgium, and Unesco 
are shortly to sign an agree- 
ment whereby this Far East 
observatory will receive 
help, and thus be able to 
play an important part in 
udrvancing astronomical 
knowledge. :

### 74166: UNESCO's cultural activities

UNESCO’S CULTURAL ACTIVITIES 
nesco’s programme of 
cultural activities approved 
by the 4th General Confe- 
rence is not designed to 
break into many new fields, but 
at the same time it allows for a 
considerable development of exist- 
ing activities. 
So far as ideologies are concern- 
ed, it is not Unesco’s task to sug- 
gest the imposition of any given 
doctrine or belief, still less to claim 
the right to impose it. Unesco can 
suggest no choice between different 
and virtually conflicting ideologies; 
but it must provoke comparisons 
and exchanges of ideas, and try to 
find occasions and subjects on 
which practical collaboration is 
possible. . : 
It is therefore essential to main- 
tain and promote co-operation 
between Unesco and those inter- 
national associations which, in 
every country, comprise men who 
work to enrich and disseminate 
culture, whether they be artists, 
authors, thinkers, humanists, libra- 
rians or curators of museums and 
monuments. This form of indirect 
action is more necessary in the 
cultural than in any other field. 
  
One of the direct activities 
planned by Unesco is to ask an 
international committee of disting- 
uished experts to put the final 
touches to the plan for the Scien- 
tific and Cultural History of Man- 
kind, Once in possession of this 
plan, the Member States will be 
able to consider it before the Flor- 
ence General Conference, and if 
they agree, a start can be made in 
carrying it out. 
Carrying on its work of dissemi- 
nating and popularizing the arts, to 
which the exhibitions of colour 
reproductions have already made a 
considerable contribution, Unesco 
will arrange next year for the pu- 
blication, in several languages, of 
an international review of art, This 
will be, not a critical or biased 
periodical, nor one with an educa- 
tional purpose, but an objective. 
popular publication designed to 
spread among the public a taste 
for and a knowledge of the out- 
standing works of art of all periods 
and all countries. Drafted by the 
best available experts and amply 
illustrated, it will be published at a 
low price for sale through the ordi- 
nary commercial channels,

### 74167: Art and education

ART : 
and Education 
RE RC Ey RR NK Sa AS inde 44 
N recenl years there has been a 
| great increase of interest in the 
part which art can play in educa- 
tion, not merely as subjects such 
as painting, music, dance or drama in 
the school syllabus but as a principal 
means towards education. We all need 
the arts in our daily lives and they play 
a much more important par tin our ge- 
neral well-being than many of us rea- 
e. - 
Apart from the 
ways in which we 
decorate our homes, 
or choose our 
clothes or lay out 
our gardens, most 
of us go the theatre, 
the cinema, the concert hall, the dance 
floor, or even sit at home alongside the 
radio, in order to relax from our 
regular routine. These are mostly 
forms of passive relaxation but is 
through the most active forms of 
artistic creation that the greatest per- 
sonal satisfaction can be found, as 
one world-renowned = statesman has 
recently testified in his war memoirs. 
One of the projects which come wit- 
hin the framework of Unesco’s aim in 
promoting international understanding 
1s concerned with the role of the arts 
in general education. It is intended to 
find out what is being done by various 
people in different parts of the world in 
reference to art education, in order to 
circulate this information. 
Unesco has just published the first 
issue of a Bulletin entitled « Arts and 
Education » (Publication N° 349) which 
in future will be published quarterly as 
separate issues in French and in Eng- 
lish. In the first issue there is a gene- 
ral account of this project, the range of 
subjects which it covers. 
  
Towards World Peace 
D Museum of Art, U.S.A, contributes 
the main article, an authoritative 
account of interchange in the arts as 
a means to world peace and of the 
place of the arts in education. He 
writes that underlying the Unesco pro- 
ject is “ a belief that the arts can and 
should be used as a means to interna- 
tional understanding... and to develop 
mutual tolerance and friendship ”. He 
advocates that the arts should be used 
in a systematic way under some such 
administration as that of Unesco, and 
points out that it is “ not enough to 
rain and encourage artists themselves, 
or even to help circulate their works 
among the general public”. 
Of the other items in this Bulletin, 
one of the most stimulating is an ac- 
count by M. Marcel Cuvelier, Director- 
General of the Brussels Philharmonic 
Society, of the creation in Belgium in 
1940 and extraordinary subsequent de- 
velopment of the movement known as 
“ Jeunesses Musicales ” which aims at 
encouraging young people to appreciate 
and perforin good music. 
Forbidden by the Germans, this move- 
ment carried on clandestinely during 
the occupation, spread its influence to 
other European countries and North 
Afriea, and after the war held the first 
Congress of the International Federation 
of Musical Youth which has now be- 
come an annual event with its own 
international orchestra of young mu- 
sieians. : 
by 
Trevor THOMAS the 
Rr. Thomas Munro, of the Cleveland 
From the Museum of Modern Art in 
New York, Mr Victor d’Amico sends an 
account of two major activities sponsor- 
ed by the Museum in the interests of 
art and education. The first is the Com- 
mittee on Art Education which is an ¢r- 
ganization of teachcers, parents and 
students acting as a forum for the ex- 
change of ideas through its conferen- 
ces. It has workshops and groups for 
the discovery and development of 
new and improved 
methods. 
But perhaps it is 
the second activity, 
People’s Art 
Centre, “organized 
. to help satisfy the 
creative needs of the community”, 
which is of the widest interest because 
it provides classes for children and 
adults in which they can receive expert 
guidance of a practical character. 
Schools, institutions and individuals

“ Unesco must provoke comparisons and 
exchanges of ideas, and try to find occasions 
and subjects on which practical 
The preservation of historic 
monuments and archaeological 
sites, including their protection 
against the ravages of time and 
the dangers of war, raises difficult 
technical and financial problems 
for many countries. Unesco is, 
therefore, trying to bring about 
real co-operation between the 
various States, through exchanges 
of information (for example as 
regards methods), the despatch of 
expert missions, and the establish- 
ment of a special international 
fund. Measures will also be sug- 
gested with a view to co-ordinating 
excavation and ensuring access to 
sites. 
There can be no world-wide 
dissemination of culture without a 
free flow of books and publications. 
Unesco’s international “book cou- 
pon” system has produced such 
good results that the General Con- 
ference has decided to extend it to 
other materials like scientific and 
educational films. But it is not 
enough to facilitate the purchase - 
of books; exchanges between libra- 
ries, and particularly the interna- 
tional lending of publications, must 
also be encouraged. 
There cannot, moreover, be any 
proper circulation of books and 
publications unless readers are kept 
informed of the important works 
that are published in the various 
countries. Unesco will try fo 
encourage the preparation, in each 
country, of lists of bibliographies, 
and the international co-ordination 
of the sciences of bibliography and 
documentation, by re-starting, in 
particular, the publication of the 
Index Bibliographicus. : 
PILOT PROJECT 
“PECIAL attention will also be 
S paid to the development of 
public libraries. For this 
purpose Unesco organized, in 1948, 
an international seminar for pro- 
fessional librarians; and it was so 
successful that the General Confe- 
rence decided a second one should 
be held in 1950 on the role of public 
and school libraries in adult edu- 
cation. 
Aimed at making Unesco’s ac- 
tion more direct and concrete, a 
pilot project will be carried out at 
Delhi, in co-operation with the 
     
s part of its work to encourage the growth of a popular appreciation 
of the arts, Unesco has just published a catalogue containing 
“information on over 400 colour reproductions of paintings. 
Because of the difficulties encountered in moving exhibitions 
of works of art from one country to another at the resent time, most 
people are obliged to develop or complete their artistic culture, through 
studying reproductions of the original works. 
The Unesco catalogue, which lists reproductions of paintings from 
1860 to the present time, will be of great help to schools, museums and 
other institutions, in choosing good quality reproductions. 
In a preface to the catalogue, Jean Cassou, Curator, of the Paris 
Modern Art Museum, who helped to choose the reproductions from among 
700 in Unesco’s archives, writes : “Art is a language which all the 
peoples of the world are now learning to speak, and which they are eager 
to use in understanding one another. They need to become familiar with 
the symbols of this language, and with symbols that ara as close as possible 
to the thing expressed, that is to say, to the heart of a masterpiece which 
the genius of man has invested with such vital and pregnant meaning.” 
A second catalogue of colour reproductions covering paintings prior 
to 1860 is being prepared and will be published by Unesco, next year. 
collaboration 
is possible ”. 
Government of India, as part of 
fhe literacy campaign undertaken 
by the local authorities. The pur- 
pose of this project is to provide 
persons who have just learned to 
read with carefully chosen libraries. 
and to assemble the staff required. 
The results achieved in the Delhi 
area can be applied on a larger 
scale and later used in other coun- 
tries. ’ 
As regards Unesco’s work in the 
field of copyright, preliminary in- 
vestigations have convinced the 
experts concerned of the need for 
a universal convention, to which 
all countries could agree. The 
principle of such a convention has 
now been accepted, as has also the 
idea of convoking an international 
conference to work out its text. 
Member States are shortly to be 
consulted in order that their points 
of view and policies in this matter 
may be ascertained. 
MESSAGES FROM GREAT 
HIS very substantial pro- 
gramme of cultural activities, 
which is taking concrete and 
detailed shape as Unesco defines 
more closely its purpose and 
methods in this particular field of 
international collaboration, invol- 
ves a considerable number of 
publications. Some of these perio- 
dicals like the Bulletin for Libra- 
ries, Museum, the Copyright Bulle- 
tin and the Index Translationum 
are part of the normal functioning 
of the permanent services of 
Unesco as an international centre 
of information and exchange, 
Others, like the publication on the 
Rights of Man and the Scientific 
and Cultural History, bring to all 
peoples what Unesco has to say on 
the subject of peace and interna- 
tional understanding. 
Others, again, like the recently 
published collection of essays on 
Goethe or the similar collection 
which is being prepared on Balzac, 
convey messages from great men 
who have been educators of huma- 
nity. There are, no doubt, many 
ways in which Unesco can deliver 
its own message to the world, and 
of these, the printed word is one of 
the most effective and least ephe- 
meral.

### 74168: UNESCO catalogue lists recorded works of Chopin

* * 
UNESCO 
catalogue lists 
recorded works 
of CHOPIN 
catalogue, which constitutes the 
A first general list of the works of 
Frederic Chopin in recorded 
form, has just been published by 
Unesco and thus coincides with the 
tribute paid to the great composer by 
Unesco, in the form of a concert of 
chamber music. At the concert, which 
took. place at the Salle Gaveau, in 
Paris, on October 3, unpublished works 
written by leading contemporary 
composers “in homage to Chopin” 
were heard for the first time. . 
The catalogue of Chopin recordings 
— it comprises 5,000 — was prepared 
under the direction of M. Armand Pa- 
nigel and presents full details of each 
— title, interpreter’s name, date of 
recording, record number and publish- 
ing company. 
In the preface to the catalogue, 
M. Marcel Beaufils, a noted musicolo- 
gist and author of several works on 
Wagner, analyses the works of Chopin, 
including the very few works which 
have not yet been recorded. His in- 
formative study makes the catalogue a 
valuable reference book both for record 
collectors and professional musicians. 
Following the Chopin catalogue, 
Unesco proposes to make a list of 
the recorded works of Western and 
Eastern music, and also of ethno- 
graphical and folk music. The first to 
appear will cover the recorded works 
of J.S. Bach and Mozart, the music or 
India and China, and the collections 
of the National Records Library (Pho- 
nothéque Nationale) gnd the Musée de 
I’'Homme in Paris.

### 74169: Case dei bambini became model for the world

CASE DEI BAMBINI 
  
BECAME 
ne Eighth International Montessori Con- 
gress held at San Remo this year 
honoured the work of a very distin- 
guished woman, Maria Montessori, 
who has spent forty years studying 
the psyehology of children and their educa- 
tional problems. 
More than five hundred delegates from all 
parts of the world joined in a well earned 
tribute to the originator of the now famous 
educational system which bears her name. 
Although Maria Montessori is 79 — she was 
born near Ancona, in Italy, on August 31, 1870 
— she is still engaged in the work she began so 
many years ago and she herself presided at the 
Congress, whose main discussions concerned 
the training of men and women for world

Of her work there, one writer has said 
“It was with bewilderment, and therefore dis- 
frustfully, that these backward people greeted 
the idea of the Montessori schools, which made 
a complete break with the local 
allowing children to wander about in the 
woods and fields as they liked. At the end 
of a year the whole physical and mental make- 
up of the children had been miraculously 
iransformed: their manners and speech had 
greatly improved, and they began to apply 
themselves to their work. The pupils deve- 
loped a new personality, a sense of solidarity.

scientifically with a view to developing the 
maximum forces latent in the child, it would 
now be less difficult to altain the social and 
international harmony we are aiming at”, she 
has said. 
Speaking to the Congress on conclusions she 
has drawn from her experience as a 
teacher. Dr. Montessori, paraphrasing Unesco's 
Constitulion, said that “peace as well as war 
is born in the minds of men” and that there- 
fore it is within our own power to establish 
the conditions necessary in order that peace 
and not war may reign among men. 
Listening delegations were well aware of 
her tremendous influence in education, and 
notably how her ‘inspiration and personal 
efforts created children's schools in the rural 
areas of Lazio and .\bruzzi in Italy, where the

“The child must be regarded not only as a 
spiritual entity, but as a cosmic force with the 
capacity to influence the development of lhe 
human personality”. 
This Congress, to which many distinguished 
cducationists contributed their views was wi- 
dely reported in the Italian press, which also 
published many articles on school problenis. 
The Congress debates also emphasised that 
ftalian educational traditions are still very 
much alive. 
The presence at San Remo of represenia- 
tives from Ceylon, Austria, Colombia, France, 
Guatemala, Britain, Lebanon, Greece, India 
and many other countries demonstrated the 
general awareness among teachers thal edu- 
cation is an international problem, of econ- 
cern to all men.

Congress was Dr Clarence Beeby, the then

### 74170: Italy's damaged art treasures are losing their scars

    
ITALY'S DAMAGED ART 
TREASURES ARE LOSING 
THEIR SCARS 
ISCUSSIONS by a group of 
experts on the question of 
restoring and preserving 
historic and artistic sites 
and monuments, which took place 
at UNESCO House from October 
17 to 21, served to highlight the 
tremendous restoration problems 
resulting from the Second World 
War, 
Among the questions of war 
losses in works of art and monu- 
ments discussed at UNESCO 
House, those suffered by Italy 
received special attention, for 
war damage was spread over 
almost the whole of the country. 
One of the fullest surveys on 
this subject, “Works of Art in 
Italy - Losses and Survivals of 
the War”, was published by the 
British War Office, in 1946, and 
presents interesting facts about 
real and apparent losses. 
Monte Cassino, for example, 
was among the names most often 
mentioned in the war communi- 
ques and the destruction was 
deeply deplored because it was 
a famous old centre of culture 
and religion. 
But many people do not realize 
that, long before its destruction, 
this monument had lost most of 
the traces of its early Christian 
origin. Between the 16th and 
18th Centuries the monastery 
had been virtually rebuilt and 
historians agree that In its 
modern form it was of no great 
artistic value, 
MANUSCRIPTS 
ESCAPED BOMBS 
N the other hand, the 
manuscripts in the library 
> were unique, but these it 
was possible to carry into safety 
before the bombing began. It is 
evident, therefore, that in esti- 
mating the exact extent of 
damage to a monument, account 
must be taken not only of its 
architecture, but also of sculp- 
tures, paintings and frescoes, as 
though a complete inventory was 
being drawn up. 
To take an instance, the partial 
destruction of the Church of 
Santz Maria della Verita at 
Viterbo would have mattered 
comparatively little, were it not 
for the unfortunate loss of all 
the frescoes of Antonio da 
Viterbo. These the Restoration 
Institute in Rome has only been 
able to re-assemble in part after 
very careful work. The restora- 
tion of a fresco from often 
unrecognizable fragments pre- 
sents insuperable difficulties. 
Then, there is the case of the 
Church of Santa Chiara, the lar- 
gest church in Naples. 
On 4 August 1943, incendiary 
bombs destroyed the roof and 
the interior, charring the 
frescoes and many of the tombs 
and statues. It was found im- 
possible to restore the baroque 
interior, as all the 18th Century 
decoration had disappeared. 
There was only one solution : 
to rebuild on the basis of the 
14th Century structure, bringing 
to light more of the edifice which 
the fire had partly exposed. is 
solution, however, presented many 
difficulties, and it was necessary 
to sacrifice the stucco pillars and 
the cornices of the windows, 
because they had no organic 
counterpart in the new architec- 
tural style of the church. 
Other technical problems of 
reconstruction concern the mate- 
TRF YW TE 
 
rials used in the work. The 
roof of the Cathedral at Bolzano 
has been rebuilt in reinforced 
concrete instead of wood, which 
is locally scarce, Or was sO 
when restoration began. 
These and other examples 
show that it is impossible to lay 
down hard and fast rules in the 
matter of restoration and that 
much depends upon the diffe- 
rent styles, Gothic or Byzantine, 
and upon the mathematical 
design of decorations. The latter 
can be altogether ruined by the 
collapse of an arcade or by the 
shifting of the foundations, In 
any case, the work to be done 
exceeds the present resources at 
Italy's disposal. 
“LEANING WALL” 
OF TREVISO 
NOTHER instance of difficul- 
ty in the restoration of old 
walls is presented by the 
gallery of the Palazzo del Tre- 
cento at Treviso. Here, bomb ex- 
plosions had left a large part of

the wall on one side of the gal- 
lery leaning 87 cm. out of true. 
But for the presence of a 
fresco, it would have been easy 
to pull down the wall and re- 
build it in identical form “with 
the same kind of materials. It 
was, however, thought better to 
re-erect the wall piece by piece 
with the help of steel ties, care 
being taken to reinforce the wall 
beforehand with a brick support. 
Many countries, including Italy 
with its wealth of historical 
records, lack the necessary funds 
to repair the damage. The re- 
construction and protection of 
buildings, sculptures and other 
art works would call for resour- 
ces which are beyond the means 
of any single nation. 
Accordingly, UNESCO is trying 
to make everyone realize that he 
or she has a share in the world's 
cultural heritage, and, therefore, 
an obligation to care for its 
reconstruction today and for its 
preservation in the future, disre- 
garding frontiers and the preju- 
dices which have hitherto pre- 
vented a general recognition of 
the fact that art is universal.

### 74171: UNESCO's Germany, Japan programmes endorsed by General Conference

UNESCO’S GERMANY, 
   JAPAN PROGRAMMES 
FOUR NATIONS 
OPPOSE CONTINUED 
NESCO'S activities in Germany 
"became one of the big policy 
issues of the Fourth Session 
of the General Conference, 
following a speech on Sep- 
tember 20 by M. Jan Boor, delegate for 
Czechoslovakia. “Sonner or later Ger- 
many will have-to find her place as a 
member of the community of the Euro- 
pean nations”, M. Boor told the Confe- 
rence. “We do not see any other solu- 
tion of this painful problem than an 
agreement between the Big Four and 
the consequent early signing of a peace 
treaty with a unified Germany. Once 
this is achieved, the function of Unesco 
in Germany becomes quite clear”. 
From then on the delegations of Po- 
land, Czecholovakia and Hungary 
‘made it plain, in words and by vote, 
that they desired a postponement of 
the organization's activities in Germa- 
ny. 
The case for this delay was based 
on the political considerations M. Boor 
had already put to the conference, plus 
his contention that there had been a 
revival of national movements in Ger- 
many, which, it was asserted, rendered 
Unesco’s current and projected pro- 
gramme in Germany valueless. 
Against this submission the majority 
of member states taking part in the 
sometimes lively discussion through 
commission and plenary session, 
strongly supported Unesco policy for 
Germany, which aims at strengthening 
democratic elements particularly among 
young Germans, so that they might 
reject Nazism. } 
It is with this purpose in view, and 
with the important final project of 
bringing Germany as a partner into the 
community of nations always in mind, 
that the Organization has drawn up its 
work-plans for Germany. 
These include the revision of fext- 
books for schools, the spreading of 
knowledge about Unesco and its pur- 
pose, and a variety of projects, in which 
Germans themselves will co-operate, 
directed at securing a peaceful and 
democratic development of cultural 
life in Germany. 
Revival of Hitlerism. 
HE first important débate on 
I Unesco policy in Germany took 
place at a joint meeting of the 
Programme and Budget and Of- 
ficial and External Relations Commis- 
sions on 24 September. A proposal from 
M. Fleischmann (Czechoslovakia) to re- 
move Unesco’'s proposed 1950 Ger- 
many programme from the agenda was 
rejected by the majority. 
Immediately, M. Ogrodzinski, Vice- 
president of the Polish delegation, 
spoke of evidence of a revival of Na- 
zism in Germany, and of monuments 
erected to the victims of Hitler having 
been besmirched. “Under these condi- 
tions”, he said, “the campaign of 
Unesco becomes useless”, 
He stressed that the absence of uni- 
fled control in Germany, the creation 
of a “pseudo-state” of Western Ger- 
many, far from creating an atmosphere 
favourable to the work of Unesco, had 
led to exploitation of divergences of 
opinion with a view to revenge. His 
delegation could not then vote in favour 
of the proposed programme. 
“To refuse to collaborate with 
Messrs. Heuss and Adenauer, whose 
names are associated with the memory 
of aggressions against Poland, Czecho- 
slovakia and Austria”, he said, “will 
indicate to the Germans that only the 
way of peace will lead them to become 
part of a world community. Unesco 
will not be able to work usefully in 
Germany until there is a return to 
agreement between the four occupying 
powers”. 
Dr. Kruyt (Netherlands) declared 
that, after Poland, no country had 
suffered as much at the hands of the 
Germans as had Holland. He said 
*#The general opinion in my country is 
that it is absolutely necessary to re- 
educate the German people and it is 
Unesco's task to do this”. He added 
that the Netherlands delegation was 
satisfled with the work done by 
Unesco in Germany in 1949, and 
wished to approve the Director-Gene- 
ral's report. 
Italy’s viewpoint was expressed by 
Count Stefano Jacini, who said he 
sympathised with the sentiments of the 
Polish and Czechoslovakian delegations, 
but considered that the activity of 
Unesco in Germany would only have 
the consequences implied in its pro- 
gramme. 
The importance attached by Switzer- 
land to the activities of Unesco in 
Germany was emphasised by M. Zutter, 
who described the educational and 
cultural interchange his country was 
prepared to make with Germany. 
Four Power Support 
Requested. 
R. NIEBUHR of the United States 
D delegation, answering the Polish 
delegation’s contention that no 
work could be accomplished in 
Germany without Four Power Accord, 
reminded the meeting that the Director- 
General had sought Four Power sup- 
port. 
 
Unesco’s decision to work 
ACTION 
Unesco had initiated in 1947 and con- 
tinued in 1948. “In my opinion *, he 
said, “the re-education of the German 
people depends on the re-education of 
the occupying powers. Unesco has 
been doing its very best to overcome 
existing obstacles, to break down bar- 
riers and teach German youth to follow 
Goethe and Kant. The good work has 
begun and must be continued”. 
Miss Pedersen, of Denmark, informed 
delegates that for two years Danish 
women’s organizations had been in 
close contact with German women’s 
democratic organizations, who repre- 
sented 65 per cent of the electorate. 
Everyone would understand the impor- 
tance of Unesco’s co-operation with 
those women, an importance which 
transcended the question of who was 
President of the new German State. 
‘Dr. Vejarano of Colombia, felt that 
Unesco’'s action in Germany was a 
vital matter. He could not belicve that 
the German people, who had contribu- 
ted so much to world culture and 
in Germany is a message 
to men of goodwill in all countries 
of Brazil, made an 
impressive speech, from which we print exiracls below, In 
which 
unin the General Conference Debate on Unesco's work In Ger- 
many, Professor de Berredo Carnelro, 
he urged the continuation and development in 1950, of 
the work already undertaken in Germany. 
Professor Carneiro declared 
“ To abandon our task in Germany because if is a difficult one and

because Nazi demonstrations are al present taking place would be to 
betray our mission. The motives of owr action and the rules of our 
conduct In Germany must remain completely independent of political 
gims and economic interests. We are not swooping down on Germany 
like vultures, but are going there as wissionaries with our charter in 
our hands, and it is in the name of this code of [freedom and solidarity 
that we intend fo act, It is because wars arise in the minds of men 
that we are going to eradicate them [from minds of the Germans, 
“What does Unesco propose to do? Is programme includes nine 
parts, and each is to contribute to the forming of a new public outlook 
capable of neutralizing the poison of Nazism.” 
“Mr. President, how can we possibly consider these nine ariicies as a 
form of collaboration with anti-gdemocrals or with Nazis? I is precisely 
in arder to help the democratic and anti-Nazl groups — which, nlas, are 
all too weak — that Unesco intends to carry oul work in Germany. I

constantly be admonished to respect the common rights of mankind, and 
in order that all governments and peoples and private or governmental 
organizations, may constantly be reminded of their duties that we intend 
to be present in Germany.” 
Professor Carneiro then Introduced two amendments, the first 
emphasising the desirablity to work in the whole of Germany and the 
second aimed a! adapling Unesco's activities in Germany, so as 10 
safeguard the Interests and Ideals of the Organization. 
Introducing these amendments, which were finally adopted by the 
majority of the delegations, Professor Carneiro sald 
“The first, recognizing how ftmportant # is to defend the unity of 
Germany and how desirable i is that the Allied Powers should co- 
operate logether for this purpose, aims af Wmforming the Germans and 
all other peoples that Unesco's volee must be heard everywhere and thot

The second amendment, noting that the Executive Board is able 
fo control Unesco's present activities in Germany, and to modify or 
suspend any or all of these activities if the principles of the Organic 
general situation In Germany so 
require, meets a need which we all recognize, namely, the need to adapt

Unesco, and the whole world, was 
seeking to help a very sick nation and 
he advocated the usual therapeutic 
method of turning to the residual 
health of the patient. “It is monstrous 
to suggest”, continued Dr. Niebuhr, 
“that Unesco’s programme could aid 
the re-birth of nationalism in Germany; 
none of its activities is in any way 
likely to do that”. It was obvious that 
Unesco's aim was the democratic edu- 
cation of the German people, and, the- 
refore, he moved that the programme 
be adopted. 
Sir Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan of In- 
dia, seconded Dr. Niebuhr’s motion. He 
recalled that the proposal before them 
was to extend the scope of the work

science, could be impervious to that 
action. He emphasised that the demo- 
cratic neighbours of Germany favoured 
Unesco’s programme and approved 
the Director-General's report. 
Changed German 
Situation. 
  
. FLEISCHMANN of Czechoslo- 
M ° vakia then renewed his earlier 
demand for the German ques- 
tion to be removed from the 
agenda. The first results of the Bonn 
Constitution had revealed, he said, the 
real intellectual state of Germany. 
ENDORSED BY 
IN GERMANY 
He re- called that the Unesco Com- 
mittee of Experts on Germany was in 
agreement that the current nature of 
the situation in Germany should be 
defined, and that it should be recogni- 
zed as different from that of the epoch 
of the Mexico and Beirut conferences. 
They should not precipitate the march 
of events, and until new orders had 
been made, all decisions concerning 
Germany should be made after agree- 
ment between the four occupying 
powers. 
M. Verniers (Belgium) approved the 
programme of the Director-General, but 
suggested amending the text to throw 
into relief the importance of providing 
the fullest Unesco documentation for 
educators and youth movement leaders 
in Germany. 
M. Ogrodzinski of Poland, here de- 
clared that not a single delegate had 
denied the existence in Germany of a 
military and nationalist spirit, which 
continued to grow. He again under- 
lined the necessity for four-power, 
accord in Germany before Unesco 
could act there. 
A compromise was suggested by 
M. Perrin of France, in the form of an 
amendment calling on German circles, 
especially educators : to refrain from 
action prejudicial to the principles of 
Unesco, and urging them to help 
create the atmosphere of international 
understanding necessary for develop- 
ing the work in Germany of the Organ- 
ization. 
This brought from M. Gyalmos of 
Hungary the comment that progressive 
education for democracy was indispen- 
sable in Germany, but conditions in that 
country, its way of life, the degree of 
denazification, of minds as well as of 
institutions, and its genuine desire for 
democracy must be taken into consi- 
deration before any action was under- 
taken. 
Unesco should consider the question 
of German unity, the fundamental 
condition of peace and human progress. 
As German nationalism still existed, he 
said, his delegation did not think 
Unesco’s action opportune and sup- 
ported the Polish motion. 
The meeting ended on a dramatic 
note after the motion for the removal 
of the Germany programme from the 
agenda, on which the delegations of 
Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland 
agreed to combine, was put to the vote 
and defeated by 25 votes to 3 with 
- 2 abstentions. Shortly afterwards, the 
delegations of these three countries rose 
and left the meeting. 
The United States proposal, made by 
Dr. Niebuhr, approving the Director- 
General's report on Germany and the 
policy to be adopted in 1950 was then 
unanimously approved by the remain- 
ing delegations with one abstension. 
As a result of these decisions new 
resolutions were tabled. In the first, 
the Czechoslovakian, Polish and Hun- 
garian delegations proposed postpone- 
ment of the discussion and decision on 
Unesco’s German Programme until 
next year's Conference in Florence. 
The second, presented by the Brazi- 
lian delegation, proposed the continua- 
tion of Unesco's work in Germany, 
and called on the Allied Powers to 
promote German unity. It also empha- 
sised that Unesco could only succeed 
in its German activities with German 
co-operation, and underlined the impor- 
tance of a supervision by Unesco’s 
Executive Board, of the work under- 
taken. 
These two resolutions were the focal 
points of the debates which took place 
at two plenary sessions of the Confe- 
rence on October 4. Professor Vana, of 
Czechoslovakia, opened what was to 
prove the liveliest discussion of the 
conference. Moving the new three- 
power resolution, he said the funda- 
mental principles on which they could 
form their relations with Germany after 
the war were expressed clearly and 
precisely in the agreements of Yalta 
and Potsdam. 
“On the proposals now before us”, . 
he continued, “we must ask ourselves 
varous questions. Has the moment, of 
which we spoke in the Potsdam agree- 
ment, come for Germany to participate 
in the life of peaceful peoples. Has

### 74173: Illiteracy and hunger: twin evils of Asia

ILLITERACY AND HUNGER 
-TWIN EVILS OF ASIA 
Vital Link Between Education and Living Standard is Theme for Mysore Seminar 
read and tending a plot of rice 
land may seem rather vague— 
until you sit down at the table of 
a typical illiterate farmer in Asia. 
There the tight bond between ignor- 
ance and hunger is demonstrated, and 
much more forcefully than by any 
column of statistics. 
Multiply this man by hundreds of 
millions and you have an idea of what 
education must accomplish in its 
indirect role as a farm tool. The land 
of Asia can be made to produce more 
food, but the men who work it are 
isolated, by ignorance, from new and 
improved techniques. 
This is the reascn for the Unesco 
Seminar on Rural Adult Education in 
Asia, to be held from November 2nd to 
December 14th at Mysore under the 
joint auspices of Unesco and the 
Government of India. For many 
years, educators, agricultural sciéntists, 
health specialists and other experts 
have been conducting rural education 
projects in many areas. Unfortun- 
ately, this work cannot be done at a 
large, centrally-located university 
under the eyes of an international 
audience. By its very nature, it is 
carried on in more remote regions. 
The purpose of the seminar which will 
bring together men from such widely- 
separated nations as Australia, Saudi 
Arabia, China and Great Britain, is to 
pool the results of these experiments 
and extract the best of the techniques 
tested. : 
This international meeting in India 
is part of a continuous pattern of 
Unesco seminars for educators. The 
first was held in France a little more 
than two years ago; the most recent 
one has just completed its work in 
Brazil. The Brazil seminar, which 
took up “Illiteracy in the Americas,” 
provided a wealth of new material on 
adult education which will be brought 
into Mysore. 
Tr connection between learning to 
In operation, the seminar at Mysore 
will be divided into four sections. The 
first is the only one which could pos- 
sibly conform to a narrow interpre. 
tation of the functions of education.

There methods of fighting adult illi- 
teracy will be discussed In its other 
sections, the seminar will cover such 
fields as the improvement of farming 
methods, better hygiene and health 
education techniques, and the training 
(Photo Y. Lasmar.) 
of the former illiterate to play a 
healthy role in society. 
The men and women who are run- 
ning the seminar are anything but dry 
theorists. Typical of the organizers is 
Dr. Spencer Hatch of the Inter- 
American Institute of Agricultural 
Sciences, who will act as chairman. ot 
the group studying the economic side 
of rural adult education. 
Dr. Hatch has become a leading 
exponent of the rural centre, where, 
on plots varying from one to fifty 
acres, the local farmer is shown how 
he can improve his land and his way 
of life. A rural centre, as set up by 
Dr. Hatch in Costa Rica, Mexico, and 
India. usually consists of demonstra- 
tions in strip cropping, erosion control 
and the proper methods of handling 
cattle and poultry. In addition, a 
community Kitchen is organised for 
farmwives, and, in some centres, model 
houses have been built out of local 
materials—often nothing more than 
whitewashed mud. 
Dr. Hatch bristles when you describe 
his rural centres as “model farms.” 
These he considers as attempts by 
outsiders to do things better than the 
farmer could possibly do them himself. 
As a rural educator, he is completely 
opposed to absentee experiments. He 
and his students work and live on the 
job they undertake. 
In addition to Dr. Hatch, Unesco is 
sending two other experts to the 
seminar. They are Dr. Frederick Rex 
of its Fundamental Education division, 
and Dr. Ismael Rodriguez Bou of the 
University of Porto Rico. Three other 
United Nations specialized agencies, 
the International Labour Office, the 
‘World Health Organisation and the 
Food and Agriculture Organization— 
will send observers to Mysore. Parti- 
cipants from eighteen countries are 
expected at the seminar. 
It is this international mingling of 
men and their ideas which is one of 
the most important principles of the 
Unesco seminar—over and above its 
printed agenda. The farmer in Asia, 
his wife and his family, for whom the 
Mysore seminar has been organized, 
may hope for a much better chance to 
escape hunger and misery if they have 
the educational resources of a good 
part of the world working to help 
em. 


### 74171: UNESCO's Germany, Japan programmes endorsed by General Conference

UNESCO IN GERMANY AND JAPAN couse rege 0 
militarism and Nazism in Germany 
been extirpated? Has Germany ceased 
to constitute a threat to her neighbours 
and to the peace of the world? Has 
the activity developed or proposed by 
Unesco in Germany any uniformity 
for the German population throughout 
Germany? » 
“Germany Divided.” 
 
the activities of Unesco in Ger- 
many touched only the Western 
zone... That signified that Unesco 
approved the concept of a Germany 
divided into two parts which was a 
violation. of the Yalta and Potsdam 
agreements. Unesco should not conti- 
nue its activities in Germany if it was 
not possible to spread that activity over 
the whole of German territory. 
Of present conditions in Germany, he 
said : “The situation is changing, but 
it is changing only in one direction, ma- 
nifest in the fact that the renaissance 
of Nazism in Western Germany is 
transforming Western Germany, not 
into a democratic state, but into a 
centre of Neo-Fascism and militarism. 
The so-called Parliament of Bonn is 
merely a platform that calls out for 
revenge”. 
M. Pauio de Berredo Carneiro, Head 
of the Brazilian delegation, put his pro- 
posal declaring, “Hitlerism is a conta- 
gious epidemic and the countries far- 
thest away from Germany have also 
gone through its consequences. Unesco 
cannot fail to give attention to this 
problem, and try to find a solution. 
There is in German youth a tendency 
to follow again the road of yesterday. 
"No one ignores this. No one wishes to 
ignore it. 
“It is because we are faced with 
this picture that we have to be assured 
Unesco is working to fight this atmo- 
sphere, which, during the Hitler years, 
allowed this situation in Germany to 
survive. Give up the task of Unesco 
in Germany, because at this moment 
Hitlerite manifestations are taking 
place? No! Whatever the difficulties 
of the task Unesco cannot give up 
"without betraving her charter”. 
P ROFESSOR VANA protested that 
not 
Professor Alf Somuerfelt of Norway, 
while understanding tne anxieties and 
pcepticism of the Polish, Czech and 
Hungarian delegates, said : “We cannot 
abandon this fight. In reality, if we stop 
work in Germany, we declare ourselves 
beaten in this fight. When we cannot 
work in the whole of Germany, and we 
have never received a reply from the 
authorities of Eastern Germany, we have 
to work where we can, in Western Ger- 
many”. He therefore supported the 
Brazilian proposal. 
Sir John Maud of the United King- 
dom, answered the Czech delegate point 
bv point, stating: “It is solely because 
the Soviet authorities have not felt it 
possible, either in quadripartite discus- 
sions or in respect of an individual 
invitation. to agree that Unesco should 
work in the Soviet Zone, that the ans- 
wer to the Czechoslovakian delegate's 
question is probably, that Uneseco’s 
~ activity will not, in the coming year, 
be in the whole of Germany”. But, Sir 
John added, the Brazil resolution left 
the door open and invited participation 
of the Soviet authorities, so 
Unesco might work in a united and 
whole Germany. 
To the question: “Is Germany demo- 
cratic enough?” Sir John said: “Which 
of us, in all honesty, can say that our 
Member State is perfectly democratic 
to-day? Most certainly the United King- 
dom would not claim to be perfectly 
democratic, and it is because we believe 
that Unesco can help us to become 
more democratic, that community will 
become more of a community, because 
we believe that men and women can 
forgive each other, that they can be 
converted, that we remain in Unesco. 
It is in that faith that we believe it is 
a perfectly clear answer that we can 
give to the question of the Czechoslo- 
vak delegate. It is because Germany is 
vet democratic enough that 
Unesco should work there”. 
The first speaker at the second ple- 
nary session on October 4 at which 
Germany was discussed, was Dr. Mau- 
rice Fischer, head of the Israel Dele- 
gation, who said his delegation would 
oppose the developing of a Unesco 
programme in Germany. “We are for- 
ced to the conclusion”, he said, “from 
information that comes to us from Ger- 
many that the Nazi spirit is very much 
alive”. 
“If German People are N 
that. 
foolish”. 
  
r. GEORGE V. ALLEN, United 
States chief delegate, who fol- 
“lowed Dr. Fischer, said : “We 
have listened today to implica- 
tions that there is evidence that there 
continues to exist in Germany a spirit of 
nationalism; that by implication those 
that favour Unesco's activities in Ger- 
many favour that revival of Nazism. 
That is a most unpleasant reflection for 
anyone to discern, particularly anyone 
representing a couniry which has 
recently contributed to the defeat of 
Nazism. 
“The German people have brought 
on a world war twice in the last gene- 
ration. I am entirely convinced if the 
German people are so foolish as to bring 
on another, the destruction of Germany 
will be greater than it ever has been 
before. There is not the slightest doubt 
about the fact that as far as my country 
is concerned we are as indelibly opposed 
to the rise of Nazism in Germany as 
we are in any other country in the 
world”, 
“All the action my country has taken 
is directed against the wiles of the Fas- 
cist type of mentality or an aggressive 
nation — it does not matter who it is — 
including Germany”. 
There were those, he added, who 
thought the only way to treat this or 
that country was by force. The Unesco 
approach was direetly opposite to that. 
“There are those who propose the 
alternative that Unesco should have 
nothing to do with the German people. 
I believe that is dangerously on the road 
towards every principle we detest so 
strongly in the Nazi regime: that of 
condemning an entire race -because of 
the actions of certain of its people”, 
he continued. 
“I submit to you, that that is dange- 
rously close to the theory of genocide, 
which we all condemn so bitterly.” 
“their attitude 
For the second time member states 
were called upon to declare by vote 
to Unesco plans for 
Germany. The first poll rejected the 
three-power postponement resolution 
by 35 votes to 4, Israel joining with 
the minority, and Mexico abstaining. 
By the same number of votes the Brazil 
amendment was carried, and was embo- 
died in the introduction to Unesco's 
programme for Germany. 
The German debate ended with a 
protest on behalf of the Czechoslovak, 
Polish and Hungarian delegations, made 
by 'M. Ogrodzinsky, Polish delegate, 
who said they considered it necessary 
to protest energetically against the 
resolution wich had been adopted “By 
this resolution”, he declared, “Unesco 
recognises and supports the idea of the 
partition of Germany which is a fla- 
grant violation of the Yalta and Potsdam 
agreements”, 
Compared with the protracted inter- 
changes on Germany, the following 
discussion on Unesco plans for Japan 
was brief. M. Proceso E. Scbastian of 
the Philippines, reaffirmed his delega- 
tion's belief that it was much too early 
to admit the Japanese into Unesco’s 
Seminars and Conferences, before a 
peace treaty had been concluded. He 
proposed that the section of the reso- 
lution enabling Japanese individuals to 
be invited to conferences and seminars, 
be suspended until the 5th General Con- 
ference. The Philippines, however, 
wished Unesco’'s work to continue in 
Japan. 
Mr. AJ.A. Nelson, of Australia, 
while stressing that their aim in Japan 
was not to open wounds but to heal 
them, supported the Philippines propo- 
sal. Dr. William K. Bunce, representa- 
tive of the Supreme Commander for the 
"Allied Powers in Japan here intervened 
to state that the Supreme Commander 
believed it was desirable to extend to 
the Japanese people participation, as 
observers and visitors, to international 
conventions or meetings of a technical 
nature, not involving political conside- 
rations. Put to the vote, the Philip- 
pines amendment was defeated by 17 
votes to 6 with 5 abstentions. Thus, 
Unesco plans for Japan were finally 
approved.

Don ARMANDO SOLANO, 
Head of the Colombian Delegation, Minister Plenipo-

Unesco: 
“The conscientious and solid hard work done at 
the Conference by some of the most distinguished 
scientists in the world, as well as by others in a 
humbler position who labour in their respective 
countries on behalf of the Organization, justifies 
a sober faith in everything that has been done 
towards achieving our goal. Every matter of 
controversy or dispute was thoroughly thrashed 
out. The Conference provided the opportunity 
for numerous consultations and hard work on every 
item of the Agenda, ending in that full measure of 
agreement upon which all fruitful activity must 
be based.”

also like to say, at a moment when delegates are leaving 
for their own countries, we must all assist those directed 
to carry out the heavy tasks of Unesco.

in order to combat the scepticism which still exists in the 
minds of some who could be working with us, and to dispel 
the ignorance about Unesco, which is still too widespread

that an organisation is

said: 
““That is why | would like 
to make a suggestion, a 
proposition: that the Confe- 
rence should decide to 
publish in brochure form, 
the speeches delivered by 
the Director General, since he took on his heavy and 
important duties of assuring the progress of Unesco. This 
would be the finest propaganda for Unesco”.

### 74175: Student groups "behind the scenes" at UNESCO Conference

STUDENT GROUP 
“BEHIND THE SCENES” 
AT UNESCO CONFERENCE 
  
¥ 
By Georges N. SKAFF 
PRESIDENT OF THE LEBANESE 
STUDENTS UN ASSOCIATION 
representing five coniinents, 
gathered round g table in one of 
the rooms of Unesco House, during the 
progress of the Fourth Session of the 
General Conference, to learn about the 
“know-how” of Unesco. This study 
group, or seminar, had been inspired 
by the World Federation of United 
Nations Associations (WFUNA), whose 
business it is to spread knowledge to 
young and old about the behind-the- 
scenes mechanism of Unesco and other 
United Nations Specialized Agencies. 
An important purpose of WFUNA 
in convening this seminar was to give 
the young people concerned, who are 
preparing for political, economic and 
international careers, a chance of be- 
coming acquainted with the technique 
of a large international conference. 
The Federation had made similar 
arrangements for doctors to attend 
the WHO Assembly in Rome and the 
same opportunity will be given at the 
Economic Commission for Europe 
meeting in Geneva, next May. 
Students Came 
From Five Continents 
Ge students wa distribution of 
T repres men and women students, 
the students was wide. From the. 
Argentine came a student of the 
Institute of Social Studies, from Bel- 
gium a student of journalism, and from 
Cambodia and Ceylon, law students. 
A Chinese woman student was 
preparing a thesis on Unesco, while 
several French women students were 
studying law and literature. Science 
was the chosen study of the Egyptians, 
Syrians and Turks while Dominican 
students had taken up social science. 
20% 
cultural organization of the United 
Nations is concerned. 
Dr. E Ronald Walker, President of 
the General Conference, was able to 
present them with a first-hand pre- 
view of what the Conference hoped 
to do in Paris. M. Maquet, of the 
Belgian delegation. gave up some of his 
 
Members of the student group. who had an « inside view » of Unesco’s General 
Conference. with Miss Myrna Loy a member of the United States Delegation, 
after she had spoken to them on films and mass communications. 
Young Americans were going in for 
international studies, and an English- 
man was taking modern languages. 
All these studies are closely linked 
with Unesco’s work. 
For a fortnight, the students were 
part of the conference organization. 
They enjoyed the same advantages as 
delegates, attended plenary and com- 
mission meetings, and were guests at 
official receptions. They had the full- 
est opportunity to make close contact 
with those responsible for shaping 
Unesco’s future. 
Anthropology and 
Conference Preview 
But the students had not come to 
the conference merely as obser- 
vers. They had their own special 
work in the Unesco House room, where 
every day an important spokesman or 
spokeswoman from Unesco spoke to 
them, often after lunching with them, 
on one of the problems with which the 
conference work time to address them 
on one of Unesco’s most serious pro- 
biems: fundamental education. His 
example was the Belgian Congo. Pro- 
fessor Somunerfelt of Norway used the 
latest discoveries of anthropology to 
demonstrate how out-of-date are racial 
and nationalist doctrines. 
How Education May Save 
Civilization 
R. G. Zook, Chairman of the 
United States Council of Educa- 
tion, spoke about higher educa- 
tion in his country, and described 
Unesco’s work at the Universities Con- 
ference held at Utrecht last year. 
Mr. Mei, president of the Chinese 
Univesity of Pelping, told about his 
country’s students and their work. 
M. Sarrailh, Rector of the Academy 
of Paris, dealt with the mission of the 
universities, and detailed his plan to 
bring higher learning more into line 
with the needs of modern life. 
a 
wv 
Mr. David Hardman, British Mem- 
ber of Parliament, and Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Ministry of Educa- 
tion, broadened the scope of the se- 
minar discussion with a lively, per~ 
sonal account of how education may 
save our civilization. 
Count Jacini, head of the Italian 
delegation, lectured on Europeans’ pro- 
blems, and gave his conclusions on the 
work of the Council of Europe at 
Strasbourg, which he had attended. 
Dr. Zeissel, head of the Austrian dele- 
gation, had a busy time answering 
questions on current happenings in 
Austria. 
To end this round of prominent 
Unesco speakers came U Ba Lwin, 
head of the Burma delegation, who 
talked about his country, and Miss 
Myrna Loy, film star, and member of 
the United States National Commission 
for Unesco, who spoke on films and 
mass communications. 
Twelve Voices 
Round a Microphone 
and this unofficial, frank and 
lively exchange of views between 
students was steered by Mr John 
Ennals, Secretary General of WFUNA, 
and his assistant, M. Dausset. 
Outside their work as observers 
and debaters, the visiting students 
made excursions to centres of cultural 
interest in the vicinity of Paris: mu- 
seums, historic chateaux and libra- 
ries. At the Palais de la Decou- 
verte, M. Leveille spoke to them, on 
behalf of the International Council of 
Museums, about the links between 
Unesco and museography. At the Mu- 
sée Galliéra, they saw the Unesco Exhi- 
bition of Human Rights. At the Salle 
Gaveau, they listened to the concert 
of works by international composers 
to commemorate the centenary of the 
death of Chopin. 
A dozen students of different na- 
tionalities went to the microphone for 
a broadcast arranged by the Unesco 
radio division, to give impressions of 
their visit to Unesco. They welcomed 
the invitation of other broadcasting 
stations, Paris-Inter and Radio-Luxem- 
bourg to relay these impressions to stu- 
dents throughout the world.

A MESSAGE FROM 
DR. H. V. EVATT 
To the General Conference 
I believe the Universal Declaration 
will stand as « lasting monument 
to the United Nations and to the great 
city of Paris, especially having regard 
to its historic association with many 
past struggles for the liberation of the 
human spirit. The Declaration was a 
solemn pronouncement by governmeats, 
that power exercised by governments 
is to be used by them, in 1rust, for the 
benefit of those they govern. 
“It is my fervent hope that the efforts 
ot the United Nations will be as suc- 
cessful in propounding a Covenant and 
measures of implementation as it was 
in propounding the Universal Declara- 
tion of Human Rights. I commend the 
United Nations Educational, Scientific 
and Cultural Organization for spread- 
ing knowledge of and respect for tha 
lofty principles of the Declaration of 
Human Rights.”

New Charter 
—— —— — rT ara TT 


### 74177: New charter defines code for Latin American universities

defines Code 
for Latin American Universities 
M Fev in the City of Guatemala, for the first Latin American Congress of Universities, 
representatives of 134 universities and state and denominational institutions have 
approved a new Charter, defining the principles which will govern their activities. 
The Charter, accepted by the Congress, at a special meeting under the chairmanship of 
Dr. José Rolz Bennet, Dean of the Faculty of Philosophy of Guatemala, lays down that the 
Universities of Latin America shall : 
« Direct education towards the complete 
development of the human personality and 
towards ensuring respect for human rights 
and fundamental liberties; towards the 
promotion of understanding, tolerance and 
friendship between all nations, social or 
religious groups; towards furthering the activ- 
ities of the United Nations for the maintenance 
of peace, in close co-operation with institutions 
devoted to the advancement of culture, science, 
education and arts. » 
The Charter also enumerates the Principles 
of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
to the realization and maintenance of which 
the Universities must also contribute. In doing 
so, it confirms the words of M. Jaime Torres 
Bodet, Director-General of Unesco, who in a 
message to the Congress said that such a 
Declaration : 
« ..is not the fruit of a moment’s legalistic 
euphoria on the part of governments. Though 
it yet lacks the contractual character which 
would make it a legal weapon in the hands of 
men meeting their current trials, it is even 
now a spiritual buttress of the future peace. 
Its importance springs from the fact that 
every stone in this buttress is a contribution 
from some different section of the human race. 
All history, all races and all languages speak 
its precepts. And with them are heard the 
voices of all civilizations; for many of the 
rights here stated found their first refuge ir 
halls of learning like your own ». 
Universities Union 
Established 
T° carry out the directives of the Congress, 
the Union of Latin American Universities 
was established, on a proposal from the 
University of Havana and the Institute of 
Qniversity Relations and Research of Santiago, 
ile. : 
By these means an improvement of the edu- 
cational centres will be sought through the 
strengthening of their relations with Unesco, 
and with the Inter-American Cultural Council 
of the Organization of American States. 
Wider co-operation in the academic and 
administrative organization of Latin American 
Universities is one objective, but without pre- 
judice to the distinctive qualities of each. 
There will be considerable increase in exchan- 
ges of professors, students, research workers 
and graduates as well as freer flow of publi- 
cat‘ons, articles and research and teaching - 
material. 
Thirty-four delegations, under the Presi 
dency of Dr. Carlos Martinez Duran, Rector of 
the University of San Carlos, approved these 
fundamental bases for co-operation between 
educational centres. 
pe

I 
M. Jaime Torres Bodet, in his message to 
the Congress, also stated : 
« In this age of transition the fundamental 
problem is that of Duty in Fréedom. To the 
solution of that problem the universities are 
committed as irrevocably as Unesco. Were 
there no other reason, that joint task would 
alone explain my fraternal interest in your 
Congress and my eager wishes for your suc- 
cess », 
Living Expression 
of Community 
A number of international observers studied 
the work carried out by the Congress 
commissions, set up for examining the 
various programme items : the mission of the 
University, organization of studies, University 
co-operation and the formation and indepen- 
dence of the University patrimony. Among 
these visitors were the Rector of Brussels Uni- 
versity and representatives from the University 
of California, the George Washington Uni- 
versity of Seattle, the University of Tulane, 
and of the Paris Sorbonne. 
The meetings unanimously upheld the prin- 
ciples relating to the intellectual freedom of 
professors and research workers, and to the 
independence of Universities. 
Another clause in the new Charter declares 
that the University is : 
« The living expression of its times and of 
the community in, which it operates. It is not 
only an entity which accumulates culture and 
transmits knowledge, but an active system of 
functions benefiting the community in which 
it is born ». 
The new code also cites the manner in which 
a University must contribute to the forming 
of a civic outlook, in order to achieve an era 
of peace, based on respect for human persona- 
lity in accordance with the ideals of democracy 
and social justice. 
Professor Bosch-Gimpera, Head of Unesco's 
Division of Philosophy and Humanistic Stu- 
dies, who attended the Congress as personal 
representative of M. Torres Bodet, has reported 
that the University spirit dominated the work 
done in Guatemala. 
« The majority of those present were Uni- 
versity Rectors », he said, « convinced of the 
extreme importance of the moment, and of 
the need for ‘maintaining close contact with 
Unesco and with the Interim Committee of 
Universities, which is at present functioning 
at Unesco House, and which has been instruc- 
ted to organize the First World Conference of 
Universities », 
The Congress supported Unesco’s drive to 
ensure that the great Educational Centres 
in the world co-operate more closely. 
    
Thirty-seven organisations were represented ot the Panama Conderence of non-governmental organizations.

For four days, delegates, 
representing 37 organizations. 
including the International 
Law Organization, Rotary and 
Lion Clubs, Trade Union asso-

of all denominations, met and 
talked over problems of Edu- 
cation, Public Information, 
and methods of reaching the 
minds and hearts of the 
people. 
Reporting on the conference, 
Professor de Benito, a member 
of Unesco Public Information 
Bureau, states: 
« It is encouraging to note 
that the women of Latin Ame- 
rica do not lag behind in this 
crusade. Together with the 
professionals, educators and 
labour leaders, they have acti- 
vely co-operated by presenting 
proposals, amendments and 
projects for raising the stan- 
dard of life on a foundation of 
freedom and peace ». 
In accordance with plans of 
the United Nations, and follo- 
wing a resolution adopted by 
a UN conference held at 
Geneva in July, a series of 
conferences is to be arranged 
in different Latin American 
cities, to guide private asso- 
ciations who are able, in one 
form or another, to help make 
known the aims and work of 
United Nations. 
A resolution adopted at 
Panama affirms the necessity 
of teaching in schools the 
fundamental principles of the 
United Nations Charter, and 
emphasises that this is one otf 
Unesco’s main tasks, adding 
« the non-governmental orga- 
nizations will work in close 
co-operation with this Specia- 
lized Agency. » 
Call For 
Information Centres 
HE Conference also urged 
the establishment in 
each country of a centre

Costumes. such as the ones shown above worn by Indians of Latin America, 
are an important source of information to scientists studying the evolution

### 74178: Congress of Americanists extends international cultural ties

CONGRESS OF 
AMERICANISTS 
extends international 
cultural ties 
Ip relations by way of the Pacific exist in far-off times between 
D the people of America and those of Southern Asia? 
. This was one of the questions raised at the Congress of Ameri- 
canists which recently brought together distinguished American spe- 
cialists in the historical sciences, archaeology, anthropology, ethnology 
and history at the Natural History Museum of New York. 
The Congress, in addition to studying the linguistic problems pre- 
sented by the Indian languages and the results of the civilizations of 
Peru (Inca and Pre-Inca), considered the parallels between Hindu Art 
and the Mayan Art of the Central American regions. 
The research so far carried out reveals a striking coincidence of 
artistic ideas, religious symbols and ornamental themes in large monu- 
ments and in the industrial works of art, as well as in the sculptural 
decorations and friezes of the temples and in ceramic decorations. 
At the same time, various exhibitions were held in order to give a 
comparative picture between Asian archaeology and that of the New 
‘World. The exhibits came from China, Indo-China and the Facific Regions 
and included magnificent bronze vases, ceramics and jade ware from 
the time of the Shang dynasty — the second half of the second mille- 
nium B. C. — and from the Shui dynasty, dating from the last centuries 
of the same millenium up to several centuries before the birth of 
* Christ. : 
Another exhibition, held in the Brooklyn Museum, contained a 
collection of North American indian costumes, which traced the historical 
evolution of Indian wearing apparel over a period of 1.500 years. 
From the international point of view, the Congress was of great 
importance as a factor in relations between the New and the Old 
‘Worlds through its adoption of the constitution of the International 
Committee of Americanists. This committee will be a permanent member 
organization of the Union of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences 
which forms part of the International Council for Philosophy and Huma- 
nistic Studies, which was established under the auspices of Unesco. 
In other words, the old cultural relations between the organized 
~ institutions of America and Europe will gain in importance by beirg 
ro, 
extended to the whole of the American continent. 
Professor Pedro Bosch-Gimpera, Head of Unesco’s Division of Philo- 
sophy and Humanistic Studies who attended the Congress, reported 
that he was very satisfied with its resuits, and particularly with the 
readiness shown by American investigators in general to try to streng- 
then their research and co-ordinate it with that of their colleagues in 
Europe and in other parts of the world, in accordance with the aims 
of Unesco. 
Much of the work of the Congress, whose president was Professor 
Paul Rivet, was concerned with chronological research and the inves-. 
tigations of the American archaeological groups. The Congress, in fact, 
served to emphasise the progress which nas been made in the use of 
cirronology for the study of ancient American civilizations.

### 74180: Children of the street: urgent problem of post-war child vagrants studied at Charleroi Conference

     Urgent Problem of Post-War 
Child Vagrants Studied 
at Charleroi Conference 
NE of the greatest and perhaps the most pathetic of problems left by 
the Second World War is that of the host of vagrant children to be 
found in many parts of Europe and also in those areas of Asia which 
have known War for cver a decade. 
Idle for the most part, often homeless or housed in hovels, eking 
out an existence through various forms of petty crime, most of these children 
would appear to have little to hope from life. 
A hope exists, however, thanks to the numberless people who are working 
to help them and to show them how to become useful members of the commu- 
nity. . 
Some cf these people met last month at a two-day conference, called by 
Unesco, in the Children’s City of “Marcinelle”, Charleroi, Belgium, to discuss 
this vast problem of re-adjusting vagrant or war-orphaned children to social 
‘life. 
The conference, first of its kind since the war, brought together magistrates, 
psychologists, social welfare experts, and directors of children’s communities. 
These experts exchanged views, presented on-the-spot reports of every phase of 
this vast problem of social and psychological causes of vagrancy, outlining, 
practical ways and means for educating vagrants and dealing with youthful! 
gangs, and previding assistance for badly-placed children and their families. 
Various Children’s Communities of Europe, important pest-war centres in 
the struggle to alleviate the problem of juvenile vagrancy, were represented at 
the Charleroi meetings. Other interested international associations, the Red 
Cross, International Union for the Protection of Children, and United Nations 
agencies, sent delegates to the conference. 
The dramatic facts of the present-day plight of these children and their 
clders were laid in euaccession before the assembled experts, first in a moving 
survey from M. Jean Chazal, a magistrate and a leading authority on the 
  
subject, from his day-to-day dealings with children in the Seine Court. 
ROM Italy, Dr. Maria Venturini, 
FE presented a heart-rending pic- 
ture of conditions in her 
country. “Even before the war”, 
she said, “many people lived in slum 
conditions, in a single room below 
street level, where the only light came 
through the open doorway, and 
where anything from four to ten 
people were huddled together like 
animals. But those days now seem 
like a past Golden Age to the poor of 
Naples. 
«The war has destroyed 100,000 
houses, and half a million people live, 
-if it can be called living, in hovels, 
in barrack yards, in caves. There are 
even cases of eighteen people from 
two or three families living together 
in a single room, often without 
‘windows. There is frequently only 
one water-closet for ten or twenty 
people, and, as a rule, none at all. 
«There are three caves at Capodi- 
mento and at Mergellina”, she went 
on, “where more than one hundred 
families, or at least five hundred per- 
sons, live together. There are long 
passages dug out of the hillside, 
without air or light. Water and 
hygienic facilities are all at the en- 
trance to the cave’. 
No Help From Family 
[13 HERE are the children when 
W they are not forced back 
into these icy tombs by 
rain or sleet?” asked Dr: 
Venturini. “In the street, where they 
can at least play in the sunlight. The 
eldest go further afield to beg in 
districts where people have money in 
their pockets. I think Naples is the 
only large city in the word without 
public gardens. 
«The family is no help. Why 
should families wish to share the 
hazards of the street with their chil- 
dren, who haunt them by expressing 
the mere instinct of self-preservation. 
No, their families send them into the 
street to play and to beg. The family 
exploits children because it has sunk 
so low, because it is so poor. They 
teach thzm to pick up cigarette 2nds. 
knowing that all the rest can be 
learned in the streets. The police 
know all about it, so do the law courts. 
«Children convicted in juvenile 
courts should theoretically be sent to 
reform schools, but there are none. 
But in this respect there are couniries 
much worse off than Italy. 
“Police and magistrates therefore 
close their eyes, waiting for some 
crime to be committed, since it will 
then be easier to pick out those who 
will always remain beggars and 
thieves from those who, once they 
have food inside them, are capable of 
scmething better. In our cowardice, 
wz gamble on the chance that despair 
may not drive these children into the 
courts, where it is they who will have 
to answer the charge.” leroi Conference also revealed the efforts being made to save these children. 
While emphasising the tremendous scale of modern child vagrancy problems. the Char-

pretexts, they win the children’s 
confidence and encourage them to go 
in for sport, camping and work. In a 
year and a half, this new kind of 
Salvation Army has transformed eight 
gangs of such children into useful 
apprentices”. 
Unesco has been asked to give 
material support to these Friendship 
Teams, to enable them to extend 
their work, and set up homes to 
shelter these children from the street. 
The Friendship Teams 
OUNDER of the “Friendship 
Teams”, M. Dacier-Falque, des- 
cribed to a journalist-observer of 
the conference the preventative 
methods of the teams. “The Friend- 
ship Teams”, he said, “are made up 
of young people from every class. 
Outside their ordinary work they 
devote themselves to re-educating

AM 
, - — Sha 
HERE are numerous and important links between the field of popular arts and fun- 
damental education. The preservation and development of traditional arts present 
a series of urgent problems which require a prompt solution. These must be faced 
not only for aesthetic or sentimental purpose, but also for practical reasons. The exis- 
tance of popular arts is often closely related to the economic life of societies and contri- 
butes substantially to their well-being. 
The important part played by the popular arts in the programmes of fundamental 
education prompted Unesco to convene a conference of experts in Paris to examine the 
whole problem and offer practical suggestions regarding the future activities of Unesco 
in this promising field. 
The Committee of experts, who met at Unesco House from 10 to 15 October, 
discussed the significance of popular arts in three types of culture: tribal, pre-industrial 
and industrial. In their reports the experts cited numerous examples of decadence and 
disappearance of once vigorous arts and they stressed the need to help the people con- 
cerned in saving their cultural heritage. 
On the other hand, occasional revivals of popular arts were also noted and their 
significance was duly analysed. Some interesting observations came out from the discus- 
sions. Thus, for instance, it was remarked that action by governments and private orga- 
nizations, though sometimes instrumental in the rebirth of a dying tradition, often created 
a danger of formalism and archaism. Interference with the liberty of the artist was 
unanimously condemned, for popular arts should reflect the tendencies and aspirations 
of the culture which produced them. 
Finally, the Committee recommended that Unesco should take the initiative in 
publishing a symposium dealing with the main problems of popular arts in the modern 
world and should undertake surveys in a few communities where experiments had been 
tried out. It further called on Unesco to support efforts to prevent the disappearance 
of folk arts and to preserve a valuable part of the cultural heritage of the world. Lastly, 
the committee unanimously recognized Unesco to be the most suitable organization 
for encouraging the exchange of information and documentary material, as well as orga- 
nizing exhibitions on this subject. 
In a few months time the first 
Friendship Home is to be established. 
From it, the children will leave daily 
for their factory or training centre, 
and will find a large measure of 
freedom in their new home, 
Honorary chairman of the Charleroi 
Conference was M. René de Cooman, 
Vice-President of the International 
Federation of Children’s Communities. 
Experts from several war-devastated 
countries in Europe and the Far East 
contributed to the useful exchanges 
that took place. 
These experts included: M. Jean 
Chazal, Children’s Magistrate of the 
Seine Court (France); Professor De- 
motre Caranicas of the University of 
Salonika (Greece); Dr. Maria Ventu- 
rini, a prominent Italian child psycho- 
logist; Mr. U Ba Lwin of Burma; 
M. Jean Francois, Inspector-General 
of the French Educational System and 
Dr. Préaut, President of the Interna- 
tional Federation of Children’s Com- 
munities. Chairman of the confe- 
rence was Mr. Maurice Millaud, a Eu- 
ropean representative of the UN De- 
partment of Social Affairs. 
“Understand Then Act” 
HE importance of the Conference 
| was stressed by the Press of 
many countries. Alexis Danan, 
a leading authority on the pro- 
blems of neglected children, wrote in 
the French daily “Franc-Tireur™” : 
“The general public knows little of the 
wide range of work Unesco is carrying 
out to solve the manifold problems of 
neglected children.Its mission is not 
confined to investigation : the practi- 
cal results it has achieved are asto- 
nishing. 
“And while giving immediate assis- 
tance to relieve proven needs, it spares 
no efforts to assess requirements 
throughout the world. It has corres- 
pondents and information agents in 
every country and organizes working 
conferences to which it invites anyone 
able to give useful advice. Its motto 
might well be: ‘Understand then act’”. 
A report is being prepared from the 
conference, on which further action to 
improve the tragic existences of these 
young vagrants of Europe and Asia 
will be based.

### 74182: Florence "where the spirit lives" will welcome UNESCO in May 1950

  
    
LORENCE 
WHERE THE SPIRIT LIVES” 
WILL WELCOME UNESCO IN MAY 1950 
Form which is continuously chan- 
ged and renewed in space. A 
continuity exists in the various 
forms of art which mark through the 
centuries the city's glorious passage in 
the history of the world. The fine and 
translucent air emphasises the outlines 
of its hills, soft yet firm surrounding 
the Arno like a protecting arm. 
Perhaps this happy conjunction of 
natural elements has made Florence a 
spurce of forms in space. Throughout 
centuries filled with history, its artists 
have created visible equivalents to the 
liopes and anxieties of man. 
The Etruscans had already brought 
into the Valley of the Arno extreme 
refinement and the mystery of their 
rites. The soft Tuscan hills have wel- 
comed austere priests who studied the 
divine laws of the lightning or the flight 
of birds. - 
Today, the Archaeological Museum 
enables us, in the heart of Florence, to 
make a mysterfous and fascinating

journey into the life and times of more 
than two thousand years ago : arms, 
works of art, jewels which were worn 
by knights dnd ladies during their life- 
time and then placed in their tombs, 
guarding their eternal rest. 
It is a glimpse into an extremely 
civilized epoch when men tried to find 
forms which would express the sense 
of their possible relations with the 
world. Transcending space and time, 
mysterious and subtle bonds link the 
sculptures of the Florence of over two 
thousand years ago with the sculptured 
forms of the East, of India, China... 
As a result of the Roman conquest, 
the life of the region considerably 
changed. Forms became less inventive 
and took on a powerfully realistic 
aspect which answered the needs of an 
organized life, but diminished the poetic 
impulse. The architecture is the best 
proof of this, the most striking example 
being the Roman theatre at Fiesole. 
In the Middle Ages Florence again 
took up its primarily creative role. 
This was a dark and magnificent era 
filled with bloody strife. The citizens 
gathered round Church and Empire in 
two hostile factions and both sides 
waged a releutless struggle for power. 
The vanquished lost all; exile was their 
last resource. During such an exile 
was created that tremendous and divine 
work which summarises passions, 
poetry and learning of the period : the 
Divine Comedy gave birth to the Ita- 
lian language. 
It may have been during this period 
that the walls of Florence acquired 
their forbidding aspect, which persisted 
even in full Renaissance days. Around 
the Ponte Vecchio, the mediaeval part 
of the town spread out in straight lines, 
their severity making a striking contrast 
with the soft curves of the surrounding 
hills. 
The Renaissance was the splendid 
close of a triumphantly successful crea- 
tive period, which is almost without 
parallel in history : Cimabue, Giotto, 
Orcagna, Donatello, Masaccio, Fra An- 
gelico, Brunelleschi, Michelangelo, Leo- 
nardo... The history of forms offers 
few examples of such a wealth of 
mighty creations in such a compara- 
tively short time. 
The Uffizi Gallery, the Pitti Palace, 
the Bargello, the Monastery of St. Mark, 
the Gallery of the Academy, the Chur- 
ches... everything in Florence bears the 
stamp of unique lives and works of art 
and their creative power, transcending

national boundaries, still stirs our emo- 
tions with the high poetical value of 
their message. 
The Medicis, particularly Cosimo the 
Elder and Lorenzo, greatly stimulated 
the creative urge of the city in a highly 
civilized age. Poetry, painting, sculp- 
ture, architecture, craftsmanship, every- 
thing contributed during this period to 
make Florence one of the most vital 
centres in the world. 
In the following centuries, the ferti- 
lity of ideas that began in Florence 
developed in the world a certain sense 
of balance and harmony which still 
represents an ideal of life. 
Florence, on which the War left its 
cruel marks, must itself be considered 
as one great museum.

The smallest break was bound to deal 
a serious blow at this carefully arranged 
harmony. Its logical construction has 
today perhaps been destroyed forever; 
two pitiless gaps are to be seen in the 
two mediaeval quarters around the 
Ponte Vecchio. 
The compact line of houses along the 
banks of the Arno, from the Ponte 
Vecchio to the Ponte Trinita, which 
made the river almost like a closed-in 
basin — shut in still more by the row 
of houses on the Ponte Vecchio itself — 
has been broken. The Ponte Santa Tri- 
nita, which connected the two sides of 
the city by its incomparable arches, and 
which was one of the purest examples 
of Renaissance architecture, has dis- 
appeared.

blem of restoring the unity of the city 
have grasped the full gravity of this 
break. 
What was slowly built in the course 
of ages by the combined efforts of the 
city's artists who gave it a harmony 
answering to the political, rconomic and 
social demands of life, has been des- 
troved by one violent and sudden blow. 
The Fifth Session of the General Con- 
ference of Unesco will be held in a 
building which is one of the master- 
pieces of Florentine architecture. 
The Palace which Luca Pitti asked 
Brunelleschi to build as a private resi- 
dence, and which was to constitute an 
ideal link between town and country, 
has become one of the living symbols 
of Art. It combines the constructive 
harmony of ancient Roman walls with 
the hard austerity of the Middle Ages. 
The citizens of Florence, who have not 
forgotten the flashes and explosions 
which accompanied the terrible wounds 
inflicted on the city one night in July 
1944, await the words of peace, encou- 
ragement and understanding which are 
to come from these same austere walls.
