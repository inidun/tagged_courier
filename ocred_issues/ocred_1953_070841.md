TO OUR NEW READERS 
ast month the Courier announced its new subscription drive to obtain 
50,000 additional subscribers. It is as yet too early to judge the 
results but already the number of subscriptions received and the 
letters accompanying them are most encouraging. The publication 
of the Courier depends, as most periodicals do, on the continued support 
of its subscribers. 
Our latest subscription campaign, however, has a more profound 
purpose: to be able to bring the ideals and goals for which Unesco stands 
to an increasingly larger body of readers throughout the world. 
Unlike most of our numbers, the present issue is devoted in its 
entirety to one subject: the struggle for human rights. 1t will be read by 
large numbers of teachers and education leaders who will be seeing the 
Courier for the first time. For their benefit, we wish to state briefly the 
purpose and nature of our periodical. 
The Courier, we believe, is a unique venture in international 
journalism sponsored by Unesco. Published in three languages— 
English, French and Spanish—it seeks to develop the habit of a global 
outlook in readers the world over. The Courier offers a monthly selection 
of illustrated feature articles and news relating to the educational, 
cultural and scientific problems and life of peoples throughout the world. 
Each month it devotes a section of its issue to an authoritative 
treatment of an important world problem and shows how it is being 
dealt with practically on both national and international levels in 
different regions of the globe. Recent issues have featured themes such 
as: The Intellectual Fraud of Racial Doctrines; Television : A Challenge 
and a Chance for Education; Pushing Back the World's Desert Frontiers; 
Music at School and in Our Everyday Lives; The Cinema and Inter- 
national Understanding; Books Without Chains (Public Libraries and 
Popular Education); World Newsprint Famine; Understanding Other 
Peoples in the Geography Class. 
If you are interested in people of other nations, and in the events and 
problems affecting their daily lives, subscribe to the Unesco Courier. 
It is a periodical published for you.

### 70572: The Child in school and human rights

THE CHILD IN SCHOOL 
NOVEMBER 1953. Page 3 
AND HUMAN RIGHTS 
ISTORY is in part the record of men’s struggle to 
H win recognition of many of those human rights 
which are enumerated in the Universal Declaration 
adopted by the United Nations in 1948. 
At first glance, the Declaration might seem to be the 
culmination of the hopes and efforts of all who have 
fought the cause of human freedom in one form or 
another ; and it is true that all their struggles have 
contributed to the creation of the conditions in which 
the drafting and acceptance of the Declaration became 
possible. But it would be a serious mistake to see in 
each instance a conscious movement in favour of the 
universal enfranchisement of man, or to represent the 
history of human rights as one of steady and unbroken 
progress towards that end. 
Although, throughout history, people have struggled to 
defend or establish certain rights, this does not mean 
that they were freely claimed for all men nor that those 
who enjoyed them felt themselves under any obligation 
to give their leadership or encouragement to other less 
fortunate groups. On the contrary, we find that in the 
past these rights were often regarded as the privilege 
of certain limited sections of the community. 
For example, the democracy of Athens observed equa- 
lity before the law, equal participation in drama and 
games, freedom of speech and many other rights for those 
who were citizens, but these privileges were denied to 
the greater part of the population. Moreover, Athenian 
democracy was to a great extent treated by the Athenians 
as something peculiar to themselves, which marked them 
off from Sparta, for instance, and above all from the 
“Barbarians”. 
Thus, while the democracy of Athens in the fifth cen- 
tury B.C. was perhaps one of the most complete the 
world has known, it was also one of the most limited in 
scale, for the number of people in Athens with full 
privileges of citizenship at this period was probably no 
greater than 40,000 (women, children under 18, resident 
foreigners, and slaves did not count as citizens in the 
political sense). 
In the English Magna Charta of 1215, which is com- 
monly regarded as one of the milestones in the struggle 
for human rights, we read : “No freeman shall be taken 
or imprisoned or dissiezed or outlawed or exiled or in 
any way destroyed, nor will we go upon him nor will 
we send upon him, except by legal judgment of his 
peers or by the law of the land.” 
* 
N A.D. 1215 this was a far-reaching restraint on arbi. 
trary government. Neverthless, we may note with 
interest today that the “law of the land” meant feudal 
law and that the “freemen” were the English feudal 
barons ‘who were forcing King John to sign their Charter. 
They little thought that before long new classes of men 
would be claiming their rights as free men, or that one 
day women also would be claiming them as the equals 
of men. 
So we find that the advancement of many human rights 
has often taken a strangely 
ironic form. Groups within 
a society or nation strug- 
gled for the recognition of 
rights which they conside- 
red their own particular 
privileges, only to find, 
after victory, that they had 
prepared the ground for 
new groups to demand in 
turn these very rights from 
them, and ultimately for the 
proclamation of these rights 
as being common to all 
men. 
During the past century, however, the world has grown 
suddenly smaller than could have been foreseen two 
generations ago. The development of new means of 
communication, the spread of industrialization and the 
wider flow and accessibility of ideas and information are 
among the factors which have made us interdependent 
today. 
It is not only that no one can ignore the problems of 
others, but also that the very problems which confront 
us, and our needs and aspirations, have assumed a close 
.similarity. It would seem that this, and our growing 
realization that universal peace can be established only 
if it is based upon social justice, have made it possible 
for our generation to propose a universal declaration of 
‘human rights. 
We know how varied were the ideas and conflicts and 
how uneven the progress which led to the making of a 
Universal Declaration. Even in modern times, this 
progress has been neither smooth nor sure. We need not 
go far back in memory to see how close we are still to 
the abyss, how easily all gains may be lost if we do not 
devote all our energies to the preservation of our rights. 
This is one reason why the Universal Declaration pays 
particular attention to education, for advances in the 
cause of freedom and of social rights as well as their 
defence depend very largely on education, just as the 
dissemination of the Declaration itself is in a great 
measure the teacher’s task. It is at school that the indi- 
vidual learns, or fails to learn, to think honestly and with 
purpose, to test out the standards of the community in 
which he lives, to accept responsibility for his actions, to 
assume duties. 
Another reason for the Declaration’s emphasis on 
education, is that education itself is all too likely to 
be subjected to attack in these times, and the educational 
freedoms are particularly vulnerable. Moreover, the De- 
claration is concerned with education because the teacher 
is also a citizen, and, like other citizens, has rights and 
responsibilities which need to be affirmed. 
It should also be remembered that the Declaration pro- 
claims standards to be achieved, and that they will be 
achieved only if education, along with the other organs 
of society, accepts and performs its tasks in the common 
sense. In the classroom and outside there are many 
aspects of school life which coincide with articles in the 
Declaration, and this is another demonstration of the fact 
that the Declaration is not remote and artificial, but is 
"a reflection, albeit an ideal reflection, of the world in 
which we live. 
It has often been asked whether every teacher can teach 
about human rights or if it is a subject only for the 
specialist, the history teacher for instance. The answer is 
that human rights concerns all teachers whatever their 
subject, and every teacher can contribute even if his share 
amounts to little more than ensuring mutual respect in 
the classroom. Human rights is as much a matter of 
encouraging certain attitudes and habits of behaviour as 
of learning the Articles 
themselves. Cg 
Thus, general teaching 
about human rights has 
been approached through 
discussions of current 
events. These have raised 
many issues such as free- 
dom of movement, the pro- 
blem of nationality, equa- 
lity of races and sexes, 
without the children realiz- 
ing that they were in fact 
discussing the content of 
the Universal Declaration. 
Eventually, however, the Declaration is also used so that 
the pupils can check the attitudes they expressed with 
the international standard. Teachers have found this 
approach from the human problem to the appropriate 
Article quite effective. 
Other teachers, using a different technique, have taken 
up some of the broad issues embodied in the Declaration 
(such as the principle that the will of the people should 
be the basis of government). They introduce each dis- 
cussion by recounting an episode from past or present 
times which illustrates the topic in a dramatic way. One 
episode shows where a particular right has been notably 
absent, another how people have struggled to achieve it, 
or how it has been gained. Groups of children have even 
dramatized one or several of the events. 
This method has been found to be a more exciting 
introduction to human rights for children than a direct 
study of the Articles. Biographies of great figures in the 
history of human rights have also been used in much 
the same way. 
Teaching human rights in special subject courses offers 
many rich and varied possibilities without the teacher 
neglecting the fixed curriculum. Literature classes have 
thus been assigned themes from the Declaration as essay 
subjects. Foreign language 
© students have translated 
the various Articles and 
compared their translations 
with the official text (obtain- 
able from the U.N. Public 
Information Department on 
request). Civics classes 
have made detailed compa- 
risons between their nation. 
al constitutions and the 
Declaration. 
The science teacher too 
can incorporate human 
rights in his teaching. He 
can explore the scientific bases of the Declaration with 
his students. Many questions suggest themselves. Why 
may the family be said to be the natural unit of society? 
What justification is there for the anti-racial and anti- 
discriminatory clauses of the Declaration ? (Here, the 
special Aug-Sept 1953 issue of the Courier and the series 
of Unesco pamphlets on race may prove useful.) 
The history class offers the most obvious possibilities 
for teaching about human rights. It has therefore been 
suggested that a term’s or a year’s work be based on 
human rights in history classes. First, because it is im- 
possible fully to appreciate the meaning and importance 
of the Declaration without a study of its larger historical 
context. Second, because a study of history which does 
not give proper emphasis to the human struggles it em- 
bodies has not exploited all its possibilities. 
  
A s a particular project, history classes could assemble 
a set of episodes iin world or national history to illus- 
trate the story of human rights. After a discussion of one 
of the rights under consideration, the class could be divi- 
ded into teams of about four pupils each for independent 
research. Each episode could then be presented to the 
entire class by each team, and the episodes finally com- 
piled under a single cover for use by other students. 
More advanced pupils could examine the history of 
particular rights. It would be an interesting project for 
example to study the changing concepts of “the will of 
the people” (Article 21) at different times and places. 
How have different peoples at different times made their 
wishes felt? What government techniques have been 
created to enable their will to express itself? 
As an alternative approach a class could be asked to 
concentrate on the history of human rights in its own 
country. But this approach will have value only if the 
work is conducted in a critical and dispassionate spirit. 
For few countries can lay claim to an unblemished histo- 
rical record in human rights; and no country can claim 
that it altogether fulfils the precepts of the Declaration. 
The object of teaching about human rights is not to 
deal only with the Articles as such, but also to introduce 
the principles of the Declaration in such a fashion as to 
encourage a constant concern for human rights. Such 
an attitude is likely to develop only from discussion 
conducted with all the honesty and mutual criticism and 
guidance that it requires. 
The teacher should do everthing he can to get the 
children to investigate their own doubts and queries, 
deflecting questions addressed to him back into the class 
for further consideration. It is the children themselves 
who must learn to pass judgment on events at first hand, 
for the Declaration is intended as a standard for everyone 
to apply. 
Today, teaching about human rights is being carried 
on in the schools of many different countries. A group of 
studies showing the scope 
and character of such edu- 
cational programmes was 
submitted to Unesco in 
1952 by four international 
organizations of teachers : 
the International Federa- 
tion of Secondary Teachers, 
the International Federa- 
tion of Teachers Associa- 
tions, the New Education 
Fellowship, and the World 
Organization of the Teach- 
ing Professions. webu GENTE a wr eg 
These reports, based on 
extensive surveys, show that human rights is being 
taught not only in the classroom but outside as well, 
through extra-curricular activities which link the school 
with the neighbourhood and bring children into personal 
contact ‘with some of the important community problems. 
More important still, many teachers feel, is the extent 
to which the spirit and the atmosphere of the school itself 
gives children an opportunity to grasp the implications of 
the Declaration and carry them out in terms of their own 
lives. For it is the life of the school which probably 
counts for most in forming the character which the child 
takes with him into society. It is reflected in the whole 
nature and tone of the relationships between the children, 
and between the headmaster and the staff and the chil- 
dren. It is reflected in the extent to which the school 
fosters friendliness and cooperation, whether it tends to 
perpetuate or correct undesirable social divisions in its 
environment, and whether discipline is arbitrary and 
over-severe or understandable to the children. 
* 
ERE is an interesting outline of how one school in 
H Great Britain sought to link up human rights with 
the life of the children in school : 
Article 3 (security of person) : physical safety rules, fire 
drills, ete. 
Article 5 (no cruel punishment): protection from 
“bullying”. 
Articles 7, 8, 9 (justice) : minimum of rules; no favour- 
itism; appeals against injustice. 
Articles 2, 15 (equality of races, right to nationality): 
pupils of various nationalities treated alike; hospitality 
and good manners with foreign visitors; opportunity for - 
foreign travel; friendly relations between staff and boys; 
friendly relations with other schools; pen pals overseas. 
Article 18 (religious liberty): the “conscience clause” 
— the right to withdraw from religious instruction and 
act of worship (Jews, Moslems, Roman Catholics, and 
sceptics may withdraw at parents’ request). 
Articles 18, 19 (freedom of expression): Freedom of 
class and discussion groups to speak freely without 
censorship, and to write freely in essays and magazines; 
training in public expression. 
Articles 20, 21 (freedom of association, freedom to 
participate in government): school clubs and societies; 
prefect system ; election of club and sports leaders. 
Articles 22, 25 (social security) ; tutorial system; grants 
to boys of 15-4; free milk (to all), free meals (to needy) ; 
free travel to school (over three miles) ; scholarships and 
higher education grants. : 
Article 24 (rest and leisure) : holidays, breaks, ete. 
Article 23 (free choice of employment): school careers 
bureau; free choice of special studies. 
Article 26 (right to education): no fees or charges for 
schooling or participation in any school activity. 
Article 27 (cultural participation): cultural visits 
(concerts, theatre, ballet) ; out-of-school cultural activities; 
school assembly; School Eisteddfod. 
It may be said, therefore, that the real measure of the 
success of education on human rights is the extent to 
which children develop qualities of mind and behaviour 
that reflect the principles of the Declaration. These 
qualities can be developed by teaching in the classroom, 
and by activities outside the class. But above all they 
come from the school’s purpose, spirit and philosophy. 
The above article is based on chapters from “The Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights — A Guide for Teachers” just 
published by Unesco. See bibliography p. 16.

I have an example of real progress made by 
humanity relatively quickly, thanks principally 
to the efforts of a few courageous minds, and 
despite the opposition of powerful vested interests. 
At the beginning of the nineteenth century 
slavery was still a basic institution in a number 
of great and otherwise highly developed countries. 
In 1835 it flourished in the colonies of all the 
great European countries, and in North and South 
America. Immense economic interests and a 
complete social sys- 
tem were based on it.

does to his ox or goat. 
Egypt, Greece, Rome 
and practically all the 
countries of the ancient Orient practised slavery. 
Among the Greeks, Aristotle, one of the greatest 
minds of the ancient world, said, “The lower sort 
of mankind are by nature slaves, and it is better 
for them, as for all inferiors, that they should 
be under the rule of a master.” 
In early times, men often sold themselves or 
members of their family to pay a debt. In Greece 
and Rome a debtor could be enslaved by his 
creditor, though this was soon forbidden. Slavery 
flourished jin the ancient world principally 
because people of one country regarded foreigners 
as their inferiors; (our word barbarian comes 
from the Greek barbaros which meant “foreign”). 
A conquering nation took not only the land and 
herds won in war but the inhabitants as well. 
Julius Caesar once sold 60,000 captives. 
In most of the ancient communities, gangs of 
slaves played the part of machinery in modern 
society with men for parts. They erected the 
gigantic monuments of the Pharaohs, built the 
 
“They are rounded 
up on a beach and 
  
 
‘aqueducts of Rome, were the chained oarsmen of 
the galleys of old, and worked under frightful 
conditions in Greek and Roman mines and 
plantations. 
Not all slaves, however, lived lives of horror. In 
Athens their conditions were remarkably good; 
they dressed like the other residents and could 
aspire to purchase their freedom. The great 
French Orientalist, René Grousset has even 
remarked that “the slave found himself treated 
with more consideration in Athens than was the 
free man in most other countries”. 
In Rome slave labour was used to an extent 
never seen before. The hundreds of thousands of 
slaves taken in her endless series of wars made 
slavery the very foundation of the state. Slaves 
were the physicians, teachers, house servants, 
farm hands, actors, acrobats—and Gladiators. 
Though never given the free movement in Rome 
which they enjoyed in Athens, the Roman slaves 
could still save money and in the end purchase 
their freedom. 
From the earliest times there was always protest 
among the Greeks and Romans against slavery. 
For whatever their conditions, slaves could neither 
possess goods nor take part in public life. Their 
children belonged to the master who could sell 
them at will. The master’s good or bad will alone 
determined whether a slave was treated kindly 
or cruelly. And the master had the right of life 
and death over his slave. 
In the time of Pericles (5th century B.C.) 
Sophocles and Euripedes reminded Athenians 
that a slave was a man: “Though the body be 
enslaved, the soul is free”, said Sophocles. But 
few persons advocated slavery’s abolition because 
they did not see how society could do without it. 
Many slave uprisings occurred in the history of 
Rome, the most formidable being that headed by 
Spartacus in 73 B.C. Escaping from the school 
of Gladiators at Capua, he fled to Mount Vesuvius 
where he collected an army of 60,000 runaway 
slaves like himself. For two years he fought 
army after army sent against him from Rome. 
But the insurrection was finally crushed, 
Spartacus was slain and 6,000 of his followers 
were crucified along the Appian Way leading to 
Rome. 
The messages of the early Christian churches 
were so permeated by the principle of equality of 
souls that the application of this principle to 
slaves occupied an important position in those 
messages. Slaves flocked to the new doctrine. 
It is noteworthy that during this same period 
when the early Christians were concerned with 
alleviating the condition of slaves, the Chinese 
emperor Kuang-Wu, in the year 35, enacted laws 
to protect their lives and safeguard them against 
mutilation. 
In the scale of Chinese virtues, to give a slave 
a violent scolding counted as one fault; not to 
care for him in sickness or to overburden him with 
work as 10 faults; to prevent him from marrying 
as 100 faults; and to refuse to allow him to buy 
his freedom as 500 faults. 
Although slavery was actively practised for 
generations in Islamic countries and isolated 
traces of it are still to be found, Mohammet 
declared: “He who frees a slave redeems his 
entire body from the fire of hell.” 
In India, owing to the strict social cleavage of 
caste, slavery was relatively little practised. In 
Japan it was apparently unknown. 
Slavery gradually disappeared from Europe 
after the 4th century. In its place appeared the 
serfdom of feudalism, where the worker was no 
more the “chattel” of his master but had to render 
his lord a fixed portion of his services. He was 
“pound to the soil” and when the land was sold 
he and his family went with it. If he fled he 
could be brought back unless he hid “for a year 
and a day” in some free city. He could not give 
his daughter in marriage without permission. 
Serfdom ceased in England after the great Peasant 
Revolt of 1381; in France on the eve of the French

Revolution; and in Russia in 1861 when Czar Alex- 
ander II liberated 40,000,000 serfs. 
Slavery revived in the 15th century when Euro- 
peans first came into contact with the African 
Negroes. The Portuguese introduced the slave 
trade in 1444, although their Prince, Henry the 
Navigator, who was in advance of his time, quickly 
forbade it. Soon after the New World was disco- 
vered, the slave ships of Spain, Portugal, England 
and other European countries, with their “cargoes 
of despair” were a regular sight on the ocean rou- 
tes between Africa and the Americas. It is esti- 
In 1776 the motion was made in the English 
House of Commons that “the slave trade was 
contrary to the laws of God and the rights of 
men”. This motion did not pass but the end was 
near. To Denmark belongs the honour of being 
the first Western nation to abolish the slave trade 
in 1792. 
The name of a great Englishman, William Wil- 
berforce, stands out in the struggle against slave- 
ry. After many efforts, he achieved his object in 
1807, when England abolished the trading in sla- 
ves throughout the Empire. The example was fol-

mated that between the 16th and 19th centuries, 
thirty-two million Negroes were thus shipped to 
the New World. 
For one Negro who arrived alive, four died, 
either in the manhunts on African soil or during 
the crossing. The conditions under which they 
travelled, crowded together for weeks on board 
ship, beggar description. When the slave-trade 
wags prohibited their lot grew worse aboard smug- 
glers’ ships, for they were often thrown into the 
sea on the approach of a policing frigate. 
As the true nature of this revolting traffic in 
human beings came to the knowledge of Euro- 
peans it outraged men’s sense of justice and free- 
dom. One of the great forerunners of abolition 
was William Penn, an English Quaker, who after 
founding the colony of religious tolerance and 
freedom of conscience in Pennsylvania, returned 
to England where in 1697 he strongly advocated 
the abolition of slavery. He was still too much in 
advance of his time but in the following century— 
“the century of enlightenment”—many voices 
were raised on behalf of abolition. 
Thomas Jefferson favoured it and if one more 
vote had been obtained when the U.S. Constitu- 
tion was drawn up in 1787, slavery would have 
been abolished then and there. 
Generally speaking, the abolition of slavery in 
the modern world was achieved in two stages. 
First by forbidding the slave-trade, and then by 
the elimination of slavery itself. 
lowed by the United States in 1808 (though slave 
smuggling continued until abolition in 1865) by 
Holland in 1814, and France in 1815. 
It was well enough to stop the traffic in slaves 
but slavery itself—“the shame of humanity”—still 
continued. In England, Wilberforce spent the lar- 
ger part of his life denouncing it over the country 
and introducing measures for its abolition. A 
number of smaller nations in Europe had already 
abolished slavery, and all the abolitionists in Eng- 
land redoubled their efforts. Finally in 1838, 
three years after Wilberforce’s death, complete 
emancipation was achieved. 
The enthusiasm of humanity associated with 
the revolutionary movement, spurred many 
Frenchmen in the struggle for abolition. A 
“Société des Amis des Noirs” was formed in Paris 
in 1788. And it was in France, by a decree 
passed during the Revolution by the National 
Convention in 1794, that slavery was first abo- 
lished by a great nation. This measure was 
introduced by a deputy, the Abbé Grégoire, who 
at the same time had civil and political rights 
restored to the Jews. The decree, however, was 
not fully carried out. In 1801, Bonaparte re- 
established slavery officially in the colonies. 
Public opinion, moved by the work of Victor 
Schoelcher and others, finally secured complete 
abolition in March 1848. 
The most stubborn resistance was put up in 
North and South America, in the regions where 
slavery constituted an essential basis of economic 
wealth. 
Negroes continued to arrive from Africa, 
brought in by well-organized slave-traders, des- 
pite the fact that slave trading was forbidden. 
It is estimated that at about 1820, 20,000 Negroes 
were arriving annually. Between 1840 and 1860, 
New York was the most active port of commission 
in the world for this trade; Beston and Portland 
came next. At about 1856, forty slave-ships left 
annually from North American ports, and this 
“black market” brought in 17 million dollars 
profit. 
A little more than a hundred years ago, in 1852, 
appeared the famous Uncle Tom’s Cabin by 
Harriet Beecher-Stowe. Translated into many 
languages, it rendered signal service to the cause 
of abolition. (See Courier, February 1952). It was 
only after a long, costly and bloody Civil War 
and the ratification of the Thirteenth Amend- 
ment to the U.S. Constitution in December 1865, 
that the seal was set on the total and definitive 
abolition of slavery. 
In most Latin American countries, emancipation 
came fairly early, the first nation effectively to 
liberate the slaves being Equador in 1851. One 
country, Brazil, remained the last great strong- 
hold of slavery in the New World. 
Slavery came to Brazil some 30 years after its 
discovery in 1500. It continued uninterrupted 
for nearly 300 years assuming its largest propor- 
tions in the 18th and 19th centuries. How many 
Africans were brought in will perhaps never be 
knewn, but the number undoubtedly ran into 
millions. 
Many of the Negroes brought to Brazil were 
superior in cultural equipment to their masters. 
Large numbers were literate and some are said 
to have written Arabic fluently.” It is not sur- 
prising therefore that the history of Brazilian 
slavery records numerous examples of Negroes in 
revolt. Fugitive slaves occasionally banded 
together in considerable numbers for mutual pro- 
tection into quilombos, settlements established 
in the jungle. 
Perhaps the greatest quilombo was the famous 
“Negroes of the Palmares” in Northeast Brazil in 
the 17th century. The fugitives, numbering in 
the thousands, set up a series of heavily fortified 
villages scattered over some 240 miles. They 
became so strong and difficult to dislodge that 
numerous expeditions sent out by the Dutch and 
later the Portuguese were unable for 70 years to 
destroy them completely. The quilombo, some- 
times called a “Negro Republic”, was finally sub- 
dued in 1697 and its leader, a Negro named Zumbi, 
slain. 
The first recorded protest against slavery in 
Brazil was that of the Jesuit Manoel de Nobrega 
who wrote to his superiors in Lisbon decrying the 
importation of Africans. In 1758 Manoel da 
Rocha published a book in Lisbon advocating 
abolition of the slave trade. He called for the 
freeing of slaves after a certain number of years 
of service and the emancipation of their children 
at birth. } 
Sixty-five years later, in 1823, Jose Bonifacio 
unsuccessfully propcsed in Parliament a measure 
to end the importation of slaves. This was 
achieved in 1831. Public opinion demanded that 
owners set at liberty any slave requesting his 
. freedom and offering the price of his purchase. . 
In 1871 the so-called “Law of Rio Branco” freed 
children of slaves born after the adoption of the 
law. 
By 1880 a widespread emancipation movement 
was under way. “No more slaves! No more 
masters! Liberty to all hands, liberty to all 
heads!” cried Ruy Barbosa the great statesman 
and orator, echoing the words of a colonial 
author, Gonzaga. 
Brazil was no longer a pro-slavery nation; it 
was a country fighting for abolition. In the fore- 
front of the battle was Joaquim Nabuco, “the 
great and illustrious leader of the abolition mo- 
vement.” In one of his first parliamentary 
speeches he roared: “I see Liberal Deputies, but I 
see no liberal ideas.” In a Rio de Janeiro news- 
paper he wrote: “Slavery is a word which may 
have lost all its force for certain consciences, but 
like a red-hot iron it marks a sign of degradation 
on the foreheads of others.” 
On the eve of nation-wide abolition, slaves were 
being freed by the thousands across the length 
and breadth of the country. 
In 1888, the Imperial Government at Rio, 
through a decree signed by Princess Isgbel, abo- 
lished slavery entirely, freeing the last 600,000 
Negroes in bondage throughout the country. 
The extinction of the institution of slavery in 
Brazil thus came about gradually by means of a 
progressively increasing and finally irresistible 
popular movement. 
Thus, the history of slavery and its abolition 
in a relatively short space of time shows that an 
idea which is apparently Utopian but basically 
true can be finally translated into fact when 
men who are at once courageous and discerning 
will take a hand in public affairs. It is on this 
that the authors of the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights based their reasoned hopes.

Regulations regarding work in danger- 
ous industries are of comparatively 
recent origin, most of them having 
been enacted between 1905 and 1911. 
HE recognition of the person- 
al rights of the worker is 
the result of a recent deve- 
lopment in our civilization. 
Until a very short {ime ago, no 
matter how much suffering or in- 
equality was caused by unemploy- 
ment, differences in wealth, the 
misuse of power, or other circum- 
stances, it was generally considered 
that each man had to “shift for 
himself” to find work, and protect 
his interests as best he could. 
It was only when faced with the 
new economic and social condi- 
tions of the nineteenth century that 
legislators were forced to acknow- 
ledge that, where labour was con- 
cerned, the absence of regulations 
led to new privileges, fresh oppres- 
sion, and an increasing risk of dis- 
turbances and violence. The task 
of freeing the human person re- 
mained unfinished so long as the 
. ‘fundamental principles formulated 
for citizens in general had not been 
legally applied to the protection of 
the worker as such. 
A little over a century ago, the 
industrial revolution bore its first 
fruits. In the factories of England, 
France, Belgium and Germany, in 
the mines, and in the workrooms 
of the textile industry, working 
men, women and children laboured 
in ever increasing numbers. And 
under what conditions ? 
The exploiting of man by man 
was at its height, with nothing to 
curb or counterbalance it. A few 
generous souls were tormented or 
revolted by these conditions, but the 
rest of the public was scarcely 
aware that anything ‘was wrong.* 
From time to time, a novel by 
Charles Dickens or a pamphlet 
from the pen of some sociologist, 
reminded people of the existence 
of a proletarian universe. Then 
the matter was dropped and for- 
gotten. 
In French silk factories, workers 
laboured as long as 18 hours a day. 
In Germany, the Silesian weavers, 
oppressed and over-burdened with 
taxes by the King of Prussia, tried 
to move their master by telling 
him of their woes. The king had 
them shot down by soldiers. 
In the United States in the pri- 
vately-owned factories of Massa- 
chusetts, men worked 12 to 14 
hours a day for 5 dollars a week; 
women and children were paid 
ess. 
Nowhere did the workers have 
the slightest remedy against abuses 
of power. In Europe, the prole- 
tariat had no vote, for lack of the 
minimum qualifying income. A 
worker was forbidden to form an 
association with other workers, on 
pain of instant dismissal as well 
as severe legal penalties. 
Women and children worked 
under worse conditions than men, 
in dark, unhealthy, airless roors, 
and without any legal redress. 
This was in effect a new form of

THE CENTURY OF 
THE WORKING MAN 
slavery, introduced at the very time 
when the Negroes were being set 
free. 
The French revolution of 1848 
was accompanied by a great wave 
of reforms. But the Second 
Republic was speedily followed by 
the Second Empire, and the 
proletarian returned to the inferior 
status which, in other countries, 
had never ceased to be his. 
Both in Europe and America, 
however, ideas of reform were 
making headway, particularly in 
political and intellectual circles. 
But the worker's personal condi- 
tion changed little, and in some 
cases grew worse, 
In the small factories of earlier 
days, a man could still hope to 
count for something and, if only 
on a personal score, to make him- 
self heard; in the vast industrial 
organizations of the second half 
of the nineteenth century, in enor- 
mous conglomerations of imported 
manpower, in a world of machi- 
nery and trusts, what could an iso- 
lated worker do? Submit to his 
fate, emigrate, or die. There were 
no other solutions open to him. 
 
gress was made in almost all coun- 
tries. As a result : 
A law prescribing a weekly day 
of rest was voted in 1904 in Spain, 
in 1905 in Belgium and Switzer- 
land, in 1906 in France and Cana- 
da, and in 1907 in Italy; 
Regulations regarding labour 
underground and work in danger- 
ous industries were enacted bet- 
ween 1905 and 1911 almost every- 
where; 
The eight-hour day, long consid- 
ered an infringement of the li- 
berty of both employers and em- 
ployees, was legally imposed in 
the United States in 1912 under a 
Federal law, and in France, Swit- 
zerland, Austria, etc., in 1919; 
Insurance against accidents 
while at work became obligatory 
in France in 1898, in Germany in 
1900, and in Belgium and Italy in 
1903. Sickness and disablement in- 
surance was adopted in various 
countries between 1909 and 1912. 
Even in the absence of any inter- 
national agreement, the reforms 
were more or less simultaneous 
throughout the Western world. 
  
fore were made during this period 
of twenty years. 
Many persons had difficulty in 
following this evolutionary pro- 
cess ; and there were always in 
opposition to it, those inconvenien- 
ced or dispossessed by the reforms. 
As in the previous case of the civil 
emancipation of the individual, 
certain people were seized with 
panic when confronted with the 
worker's economic emancipation, 
and made a great outcry, pronounc- 
ing it a sacrilege, a disaster and 
the end of all things. 
The history of contemporary 
progress as regards the rights of 
the worker is too closely involved 
with nations’ internal political con- 
troversies to allow an entirely 
detached presentation of it. But it 
can truly be said that the period 
1932-1948 has everywhere seen a 
new wave of social reforms, based 
on the official acceptance of 
collective contracts, social insur- 
ance, the minimum wage, and 
holidays with pay. Such measures 
could hardly have been dreamt of 
in 1900. 
It was the coincidence of these 
reforms in a great number of coun- 
At the beginning of the twentieth century labour organizations were exerting a growing pressure on legislators for improved 
working conditions. Major reforms appeared in rapid succession and ideas that had once seemed vain hopes were now 
accepted as reasonable. But though social reforms have been introduced and the right to just and favourable conditions 
of work has been recognized in many countries there are still many millicns of workers to whom this right is denied today. 
By 1900, appreciable progress 
had been made and the more scan- 
dalous abuses remedied. In all 
countries, more or less, there were 
laws designed to curb the exploit- 
ing of women and children, and 
to introduce safety measures into 
mines and certain dangerous in- 
dustries. 
That was about all; but the way 
had been paved, and major reforms 
appeared in rapid succession at the 
beginning of the twentieth century. 
Moreover, labour organizations and 
political parties expressing their 
demands had become powerful and 
efficient, and ‘were exerting a 
growing pressure on the legisla- 
tors. 
Popularized by sociologists, no- 
velists and political parties, ideas 
that had once seemed Utopian were 
now accepted as reascnable; and 
between 1900 and 1920, before and 
after the first world war, rapid pro- 
The explanation is not far to seek : 
the main argument used by the 
opponents of a reform was the 
forecasting of the dangerous conse- 
quences it might have; once the 
experiment had been made in 
some country without any disas- 
trous results, the advocates of the 
reform used this as a fresh argu- 
ment in its favour, and their adver- 
saries became disarmed. 
International organizations were 
not slow to make their appearance. 
A non-political association for the 
protection of workers was founded 
in Berne in 1905. The Internation- 
al Office at Basle was instituted 
in 1913. Lastly, the Labour Char- 
ter was inserted into the 1919 peace 
treaties; and the Washington 
Conference, attended by 39 Slates, 
created the International Labour 
Organization and its functional 
body, the International Labour 
Office. Enormous strides there- 
tries that enabled the General As- 
sembly of the United Nations in 
1948, to reach agreement on the 
terms of Articles 23, 24 and 25 of 
the Universal Declaration. They 
were voted by 48 nations, many of 
whom are already putting them 
into practice. Recent history has 
shown us that, given the impetus, 
social evolution of this kind 
spreads rapidly throughout the 
whole world. 
The progress achieved, or still to 
be achieved, follows logically upon 
the civil and political progress 
made during the last 150 years. It 
has been made possible only by 
the establishment of unrestricted 
universal suffrage, which is an 
application of the basic democratic 
principle of equality. This con- 
quest of universal suffrage has 
been largely due to the constant 
and strenuous efforts of labour or- 
ganizations themselves.

### 70588: From Roman law to human rights

FROM ROMAN LAW 
TO HUMAN RIGHTS 
By another order (lettre d’abolition), 
he could place a culprit beyond the reach of any UMAN justice, though it will probably never 
H be perfect, has made great strides since it 
was originally conceived. A study of 
ancient laws and customs shows the state of 
personal insecurity and social injustice in which 
our fathers lived. 
Athenian legislation was somewhat summary in 
form. Actually, justice was meted out by the 
people, who decided on the sentences to be passed. 
But far too much was left to the wantonness of 
the crowd, to the eloquence of accusers, and to 
the arbitrary caprice of witnesses. 
The Sophists endeavoured to preach a more 
humane justice, and Theophrastus, a disciple of 
Plato and Aristotle, laid down various principles 
of jurisprudence. However, Greek history 
abounds in glaring injustices, like the conviction 
of Socrates and the banishment of Aristides 
whose fellow-citizens grew weary of hearing him 
called “the Just”. 
The classical period of Roman jurisprudence 
was the first century of the Christian era; it is 
curious that the works of such jurists as Proculus, 
Sabinus and their disciples should have appeared 
at a time when Tiberius, Caligula and Nero were 
inflicting on Rome the most arbitrary and 
scandalous form of tyranny. Yet it was this 
period that produced the first idea of the “Right 
of the Person”, applicable to citizens and non- 
citizens alike. 
The laws were codified by Theodosius, and then 
by Justinian, so that Roman law reached full 
flower just when the empire began to disintegrate 
under the attacks of the barbarians. 
In the sixteenth century, Roman law ex- 
perienced a brilliant revival with the humanists, 
and remained a source of inspiration for jurists 
up to our own day. However, during the Middle 
Ages and until the dawn of the present era, 
legislation in the great countries of Europe was 
mainly a combination of Norse customs, in- 
‘troduced by the barbarian conquerors, and laws 
of ecclesiastical origin, designed to ensure, in 
social customs, the supremacy of the Church as 
well as the authority of the sovereign. 
As for legal respect for the human person as 
we conceive it today, “without distinction of race, 
sex, religion, opinion, social origin or property”. 
although this idea vaguely occurred to some men 
of judgment and to a few reformers, Western 
societies provided very little example of it for 
eighteen centuries. 
Let us take, for example, a few features of 
customary, feudal and royal justice as it existed 
in France, and, except for a few differences of 
detail, in Germany, Spain and Italy under the old 
regimes. 
In the first place, customary law varied ad in- 
finitum, according to the regimes and the temper 
of the authorities. The great feudal lords were 
accountable only to the king. They had the sole 
right of jurisdiction over their vassals, and over 
the serfs and villains living on their fiefs. Lesser 
nobles, and the ecclesiastical authorities also 
possessed the right of justice, from which they 
derived handsome benefits in the shape of fines, 
confiscations, fees for procedure, etc. 
The machinery of the law, and the laws and 
penalties themselves, varied according to the class 
to which a man appearing before the court 
belonged. Nobles brought to law by their peers 
could appeal to the sovereign; a commoner was 
judged by a court that allowed of no appeal, serfs 
were judged by a minor officer delegated by their 
lord and, of course, had no right of appeal. 
        
  
Trial by ordeal, or the “judgment of God”, was 
in general use during the Middle Ages; it might 
take the form of ordeal by water (for accusations 
of sorcery), ordeal by fire (which meant picking 
up a piece of red-hot metal), ordeal by boiling 
oil, or trial by combat (legal duel); this latter was 
reserved for nobles and free men. The evidence 
of witnesses could always be contradicted by the 
“judgment of God”. 
During the thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth 
centuries, these forms of judgment were con- 
demned by the Popes and gradually disappeared, 
to be replaced by enquiry and testimony. From 
the time of Saint Louis onwards, royal justice 
entered into competition with the feudal courts 
and then attempted to supplant them. 
In criminal matters, only nobles and eccle- 
siastics could be summoned before the par- 
liaments. Penalties invariably differed according 
to the rank of those concerned; judicial inquiries 
were secret; and the accused, who was presumed 
to be guilty, had no advocate. Lastly, the dis- 
cretionary power of the sovereign always allowed 
him to intervene, arbitrarily and unrestrictedly. 
By a “sealed letter” (lettre de cachet), the 
sovereign could order the immediate, definitive 
imprisonment of anyone, without previous 
judgment. 
punishment. By a third (lettre de surséance), he 
could suspend all proceedings under way. Finally, 
the King could at any time remove a case from 
Parliament and have it judged by his Council. 
Justice, moreover, was extremely slow. Owing 
to the superposition of seignorial and royal courts, 
it was sometimes necessary to pass through four 
jurisdictional bodies prior to appearing before the 
parliaments. The expense of litigation was so 
great that poor people could never obtain justice. 
It was only at the end of Louis XIV’s reign that 
the official drafting of customary laws was 
embarked upon by Chancellor d’Aguesseau. The 
Constituent Assembly introduced into the Consti- 
tution of 1791 an article ordering the estab- 
lishment of a unified code of laws. The present 
Civil Code, abrogating both Roman and customary 
law, was drawn up under the Consulate. 
The Constitution of 1791, based on the first 
Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen 
(1789), established certain principles that are to 
be found in various legislations throughout the 
world in the nineteenth century. The Universal 
Declaration of 1948, particularly in its first twelve 
articles, restates and expands those principles. 
Henceforth, no one could be arrested except as 
prescribed by law and under specified procedures. 
Detention before trial was suppressed where 
minor offences and misdemeanours were con- 
cerned; in criminal law, a defendant could be 
released provisionally on bail. A defendant was 
no longer required to prove his innocence; it was 
the court’s task to prove him guilty. The jury 
system was introduced, together with the right of 
the defendant to choose a lawyer to plead for 
im. 
In England, the judiciary was centralized 
earlier than in the rest of Europe. As early as 
the latter part of the twelfth century, the 
supremacy of the law and the recognition of in- 
dividual liberties gave the country a judicial 
system that endures to this day. 
The Anglo-Norman feudal nobles never pos- 
sessed the right to administer justice. In each 
country, royal authority was represented by a 
sheriff; judges travelled from county to county 
to preside over local assizes. Common law de- 
veloped and was early applied everywhere. En- 
quiry and jury systems tended to replace the 
“judgment of God” and trial by combat. 
The Magna Carta of 1215 contained an article 
declaring: “No free man shall be taken, or im- 
prisoned, or disseized, or outlawed, or exiled, or 
in any way destroyed... except by the legal 
judgment of his peers or by the legal law of the 
land.” There was a retrogression of freedom 
during the Wars of the Roses and under the 
despotic Tudor and Stuart dynasties. This period 
was marked by the jurisdiction of ’ 
courts extraordinary, illegal acts, (Cont'd on

of torture. However Parliament revolted 
against royal tyranny. In 1679, the writ 
of habeas corpus protected personal 
liberty. The Bill of Rights was formally 
carried in 1689, after William of Orange 
came to the throne. 
In the eighteenth century, all arbitrary 
acts (that is, all tyrannical and despotic 
decisions emanating from absolute power) 
disappeared, and every man, irrespective 
of his station, was judged according to 
law by the ordinary courts. 
In other European countries, the eigh- 
teenth century princes introduced reforms 
inspired by the ideas of the English and 
French philosophers. 
In the New World, the remote settle- 
ments and the isolation of the first 
communities, the perilous conditions under 
which they were organized, and the bold 
and independent character of the original 
immigrants made justice for a long time 
summary, irregular and often arbitrary. 
~ But with the twentieth century, “lynch 
law” lost all semblance of justification. 
In the rest of the world, similar progress 
has gradually replaced arbitrary justice by 
regular laws, that are equally applied to 
all and respect the essential rights of the 
 
Widespread penal reforms: have taken place during 
and since the 19th century. The aim is now not merely 
to punish the criminal, but also to reform and educate 
him. Note the contrast between the harsh conditions 
of an 18th century prison shown in the engraving (above) 
and those of today in this photograph taken in the 
reading room of a modern prison, in Sudbury, England. 
  
In the East, the law of absolute 
sovereigns has gradually made way for

more equitable and less cruel legal 
systems. In China, habeas corpus was in- 
corporated in the Constitution on 21 June 
1935. In contrast with the brutal and 
unjust practices that still subsist in many 
parts of the world, we may quote the 
following passages from the New Consti- 
tution of India which is now in force, and 
frees all citizens from the fear of arbitrary 
arrest and wrongful interference at the 
hands of the State: 
“The people of India, solemnly resolved 
to constitute India as a sovereign and 
democratic Republic, undertake to gua- 
rantee to all its citizens; 
“Social, economic and political justice; 
“Freedom of thought, expression, 
opinion, faith and worship; 
“Equality before the law and access to 
all rights; it further undertakes to promote 
among all men; 
“Fraternity, which ensures the dignity of 
the individual and the unity of the 
nation.” 
These words show us how far the 
fundamental ideas as to human rights 
have progressed throughout the world. 
The conquest of the rights of the person 
is a modern enterprise, far from complete 
and constantly threatened with setbacks. 
The progress so far made, however, jus- 
tifies the further efforts that are in- 
cumbent on the men and nations of today.

ERTAIN articles, the more daring, of the 
Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights have caused many people to 
declare: “But this is Utopian! Un- 
fortunately, the world hasn’t reached 
that stage!” 
True, the world has not yet reached that 
stage. But the world is in process of evolution, 
and that evolution depends on men. We have 
seen slavery, a well-established institution, 
disappear from English, French, Russian and 
American soil within a quarter of a century 
(1835-1865). It may be that, in another twenty- 
five years, nothing Utopian will be seen in 
Article 25 of the 1948 Declaration: 
“Everyone has the right to a standard of living 
adequate for the health and well-being of himself 
and of his family, including food, clothing, 
housing and medical care and necessary social 
services, and the right to security in the event 
of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, 
old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances 
beyond his control.” 
People will still say: “The world would be 
paradise if all these fine ideas were put into 
practice; it’s far from being the case in most 
countries.” But the question should be considered 
in relation to what has already been achieved. 
It is useless to dwell at length on the rights of 
the person in Spartan society. There, the 
abandonment and sale of children were common 
practices. Disabled slaves were put to death. 
And the other Spartan customs were not dis- 
similar. 
The laws of Athens were less harsh. The poor 
benefitéd from whatever relief was dispensed; the 
people cared for the infirm, and adopted the sons 
of citizens who had fallen in battle. Public 
doctors visited the poor, and artisans were help- 
ed by mutual aid societies. But childhood was 
ill-protected. 
Rome practised social assistance at an early 
stage. Poor citizens were forgiven their debts, 
land was distributed, 
large families were help- FELLOW -PASSEN GERS

TO OBTAIN BETTER 
LIVING STANDARDS 
ed: food was sold at 
reduced prices and even, 
under the lex clodia, 
distributed free. 
Trajan founded a col- 
lege for needy children, 
and Antoninus one for 
poor girls. Medical wel- 
fare services functioned 
in the cities. Septimius 
Severus and Diocletian 
forbade fathers to sell their children and, finally, 
Justinian’s Code declared foundlings to be free, 
whereas previously they had been classed as 
slaves. 
A great contribution to social welfare was made 
by Christianity. The Christian emperors of 
Byzantium, through the bishops, increased the 
number of charitable institutions, like alms- 
houses, orphanages, hospitals and homes for the 
aged. The laws of the Christian Councils and the 
first decretals of the Popes enjoined aid to the 
poor and to orphans, the ransom of prisoners, and 
hospitality to strangers. A quarter of the 
Church’s revenues should be spent on works of 
charity. 
In the East, meanwhile, there were many ex- 
amples of humanitarian effort. In Persia, 
Khosroes Anouchirvara, in the sixth century, gave 
AND 
* money to the poor to allow them to marry; in 
India, King Uposadh was famous for his alms- 
giving. 
In Christian Europe, charity had a hard task 
to alleviate the evils that followed in the wake of 
almost continual warfare, famines, epidemics, 
brigandage and vagrancy. 
Famine was rife in eleventh-century England, 
in thirteenth-century Bohemia and, during the 
Hundred Years War, in fourteenth-century 
France. Leprosy spread to an alarming degree 
during the twelfth century. Lepers were objects 
of terror and repulsion, and were excluded from 
communities, penned up In lazar-houses and 
regarded from the civil point of view, as dead. 
It is estimated that twenty-four million people 
died of the Black Plague in the fourteenth- 
century, a quarter of the population of Europe. 
When the power of the throne became more 
Armly established in France, a start was made 
with organizing social welfare. Saint Louis, who 
personally cared for the lepers, was its forerunner. 
By an edict of 1536, supplemented in 1545, 
Francis I directed that parishes should feed the 
poor and give work to able-bodied men. There 
UNESCO 
was a certain improvement in the general 
situation during the reign of Henry IV, but with 
the Thirty Years War and the Fronde, social evils 
including plague and famine, reappeared. 
It was then that St. Vincent de Paul (1581-1660) 
mobilized the whole of France in the cause of 
charity through the enterprises he set on foot, 
which reached full fruition after thirty years of 
effort. The parochial associations known as 
“Confraternities of Charity”, which were estab- 
lished in the smallest villages, cared for the sick 
and gathered in children who had been 
abandoned, with the help of the “Servants of the 
Poor” (later called the “Daughters of Charity”). 
Under the influence of St. Vincent, Louis XIV 
took steps to protect childhood and promote 
general relief. St. Vincent had established a 
home for foundlings; the edict of 1662 prescribed 
the establishment of homes for the poor and 
orphaned “in all cities and market towns where 
none such yet exist”., In his Instructions to the 
Dauphin, Louis XIV stated: 
“I will try to arrange things in such a manner, 
not indeed that there will be neither rich nor 
poor in the kingdom, but at least that want and 
beggary disappear. I mean that there will no 
longer be anyone, no matter how wretched, who 
is not assured of a livelihood, either by work or 
by settled and steady aid.” This statement is not 
so far removed from Article 25 of the 1948 
Declaration. 
Despite these efforts, however, the eighteenth 
century saw a continuation of the scandalous 
social inequalities and cruelties which are always 
present when a large proportion of the population 
languish in misery and want. Hospitals were in- 
adequate; the sick were harshly treated. Save in 
Paris, nothing was done for children or disabled 
soldiers. Unemployment remained an unsolved 
problem. 
It was cnly the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of 
Man, and the Constitutions of 1791 and 1793 that 
finally and officially proclaimed the notions of 
equality, solidarity and 
the right to relief for 
which the Encyclopedists 
had paved the way. 
In England, through- 
out the centuries, the 
process was much the 
same, Having suppressed 
Catholic organizations at 
the time of the Re- 
formation, the State, 
from Henry VIII's time 
onwards, took charge of 
charitable institutions. 
In 1551, a register of the poor was instituted in 
each parish. Anyone refusing to subscribe alms 
could be summoned before a court. On the other 
hand, vagrants and beggars incurred the harshest 
penalties, which included whipping, the loss of an 
ear for a second offence, prison and, for in- 
corrigible delinquents, death. 
In the reign of Queen Elizabeth, an Act of 1601 
permitted the levy of regular taxes on all 
landowners in a parish; it also directed that poor 
children be apprenticed to a trade, that able- 
bodied persons be put to work, and that all relief 
be reserved for the disabled. Workhouses were 
introduced in the seventeenth century. 
In the eighteenth century, under the influence 
of sociological moralists like Hume, Bentham and 
Adam Smith, the ideas of “solidarity” and of 
“service rendered by work” were the source of new 
welfare laws. 
An Act of 1796 included, among persons to be 
assisted, all workers whose salaries were judged 
to be inadequate. 
The custom of paying workers an allowance 
varying with the price of living gradually became 
a recognized obligation. 
The novels and articles of Charles Dickens ex- 
erted a tremendous influence on public feeling as 
regards pauperism and its attendant evils. 
On the international plane, few events have 
had greater scope and significance than the 
signing of the Geneva Convention in 1864. It 
gave the war-wounded a legal status recognized 
by all belligerents, and resulted in the estab- 
lishment in various countries of Red Cross 
Societies designed to aid the wounded (even on 
the battle-field) and to provide combined 
assistance in the event of calamities (floods. 
epidemics or earthquakes) whenever local or 
national resources seemed likely to be inadequate. 
During the last hundred years, numerous laws 
have improved the living conditions of the less

favoured classes throughout the world. Hospitals 
have been modernized, and social welfare enter- 
prises have increased. The world has become 
accustomed to the idea that a nation is fully 
responsible for the lot of each of its citizens, no 
less than to the democratic principle that each 
citizen must assume some responsibility in public 
affairs. 
Contemporary society has gone even farther, 
however. It has seen the growth and de- 
velopment of the idea of an increasingly inter- 
dependent world. It has witnessed the ac- 
ceptance by nations of international co-operation 
to promote higher standards of living, full 
employment and conditions of economic and 
social progress of the peoples of foreign countries 
as well. 
Nations have become aware that more than 
half of humanity lives in poverty, disease and 
ignorance. The more prosperous nations have 
come to realize that prosperous, progressive 
people make better neighbours, better friends and 
  
better customers. They no longer doubt that 
economic development and higher living stan- 
dards are to their interest as well as to the 
interest of the economically under-developed 
countries and of a stable world economy. 
The outlook of millions of people is being 
transformed from resigned despair to courageous 
optimism. For they now know that they can 
better their lot—if their resources, their labour 
and their skill are put to the best possible use. 
The 20th century has seen the growth of 
programmes of mutual international aid such as 
the American Point IV, the British Colombo Plan, 
the Caribbean Commission and the South Pacific 
Commission. The United Nations, in co-operation 
with its related agencies, today operates the 
largest programme ever set up for providing 
technical aid through an international orga- 
nization. 
The U.N. Technical Assistance programme is an 
attempt at the interchange of ideas and 
techniques which raise living standards. It is an

effort to give freely, without concern for 
national boundaries, the vital ideas in science and 
aducation upon which modern life depends. It 
is entirely a co-operative affair; it is not only 
supported and controlled co-operatively but its 
operations within particular countries are also 
joint enterprises. And what is not generally 
known—there is no assistance from an inter- 
national agency without a national contribution 
to match it. 
By the end of last year, the U.N. and its agencies 
had sent over 1,500 highly-trained specialists to 
under-developed countries, and had provided over 
2,700 fellowships to enable selected people in these 
countries to continue their studies abroad. 
On the next pages we present a few examples 
of how, with the aid of the United Nations, the 
peoples in one country—the Philippines—are 
working to achieve the “adequate standard of 
living” proclaimed in the Declaration of Human 
Rights.

SOCIAL AWARENESS AND 
DUTIES TO COMMUNITY 
“Everyone has duties to the community.” At 
industrial suburb of Manila, civic 
leaders elaborated a plan to develop social res- 
Punta, an 
ponsibility in the community. Workers, teachers 
and children of the school all took part in a 
programme which included a scheme for a new 
town plan, a new library, a campaign for town 
hygiene and sanitation. Unesco was asked to 
send a specialist on community development to 
help the community in corrying out the plan.

A PROPER STANDARD 
OF LIVING FOR ALL 
During the final discussion of the Universal 
Declaration before its adoption in 1948, 
Mr. Carera Andrade of Ecuador commented that 
many of the rights had been the heritage of 
mankind for years but others, such as the right 
of man to work and the right to a decent 
standard of living, had only recently come into 
existence. The craft weavers of the Philip- 
pines recently found these rights menaced when 
machine-made fabrics began flooding local 
markets. The Government, with UN aid, set up 
a workshop to help the weavers improve their 
production and thus safeguard their livelihood. 
i 
FRIENDSHIP COMES 
FROM SHARED SKILLS 
The Preamble to the Universal Declaration 
states that “it is essential to promote the deve- 
lopment of friendly relations between nations”. 
The U.N. programme of technical assistance 
is a practical application of this principle. In 
the Philippines, where timber is an important 
natural resource now being developed, local 
timbermen have invented special methods in this 
industry which the Food and Agriculture Organi- 
zation felt could help other countries. The 
Philippine Government therefore invited twenty- 
one countries to send timber experts to study 
Filipino methods as part of a technical assis- 
tance exchange of information programme.

Women began actively to organize 
the fight for their rights at the start of 
the 19th century. They progressively 
demanded the right to earn their own 
living outside the home and of compet- 
ing in factories, business, or the 
professions on an equal basis with 
men. Here is a woman's trade union 
member card issued in Scotland in 1833. 
HE story of women’s rights 
is a fascinating one. They 
have been subject, through- 
out history, to extraordinary 
changes of fortune. In some 
instances women have been re- 
garded as chattels; in others, they 
have been honoured like sove- 
reigns, from the mere fact that 
they were women. Civil law has 
frequently regarded women as 
irresponsible; but there have also 
been matriarchies, in which home 
and society alike were founded 
upon maternal authority. 
There have been periods of total 
emancipation, and periods of en- 
slavement beyond all hope of deli- 
verance. Sometimes men have 
placed ‘women in a position of 
eminence; at other times, women 
have had to win their own rights 
at the cost of a long struggle 
against the distrust, fear and deri- 
sion of their contemporaries. 
In Ancient Egypt, woman, 
though for a time enslaved to man, 
very soon attained complete equa- 
lity with him. Girls, when they 
came of age, were given the same 
rights as men. 
A marriage involved a double 
contract, in which the rights and 
duties of each spouse were clearly 
stated; these were to all intents and 
purposes the same for each party. 
These contracts show that the right 
to personal property existed for

both sexes, and that either spouse 
could divorce at will, subject to 
payment of fair compensation. 
In the working classes, women 
seem to have been given the lighter 
tasks, such as weaving or the busi- 
ness of buying and selling. Men 
were responsible for the hard 
work. In the country, women and 
children shared labour in the fields 
with men, on an equal footing. 
Although Egyptian civilization 
readily recognized the rights of 
women, this was not the case with 
most of the peoples of antiquity. 
In Ancient Greece, especially 
with the Boeotians and the Spar- 
tans, society long adhered to the 
primitive law that regarded women 
as veritable beasts of burden. Wo- 
men were bought and sold like 
cattle, or captured by force. Even 
at a later stage, a father long pre- 
served the right of marrying his 
daughter off as he chose, without 
consulting her wishes; and he had 
the right of life and death over her. 
Philosophers disagree 
THENIAN civilization grew less 
harsh, under the influence 
of certain philosophers. But 
though Xenophon took up the 
defence of women, Plato was 
shocked to see them become the 
equals of their husbands. Aristotle 
declared that women were very 
inferior, particularly as regards 
their reasoning powers. “Virtue is 
conceded to them; but it is a virtue 
proportioned to their capacities, and 
so a lesser virtue than that of men.” 
We know, from the comedies of 
Aristophanes, to what freedom and 
self-reliance women had attained 
in his century. But it was custom 
rather than law that gave them 
this freedom. 
In Rome, the legal status of wo- 
men varied with the times. At an 
early period, they lived in a state 
of utter subjection to father or 
husband. Except for the priest- 
esses, who were granted certain 
privileges, women were excluded 
from any intellectual life. Cicero, 
Tacitus and Cato denied that they 
had any capacity for judgment. 
s which control their own we 
At the most, they were consulted 
about the choice of a husband; but 
divorce, by mutual consent, was 
permitted. 
Finally, Seneca and the Stoics in 
the first century of the Christian 
era, affirmed the equality of the 
sexes, though stating that women 
were less fitted than men for the 
study of philosophy. A system of 
co-education was adopted, in the 
upper classes, so that a master 
could teach a brother and a sister 
at the same time. 
This accession to intellectual life 
enabled women to take a greater 
part in the propagation of 
Christianity. But women were 
not emancipated either in private 
or in public law. 
The great Renaissance, which 
began as early as the twelfth cen- 
tury in Mediterranean countries, 
was accompanied by a great ad- 
vance in women's emancipation. 
Chivalry honoured women as a 
source of fine feeling. Thus la- 
dies, princesses and middle-class 
women took a distinguished part 
in the social and cultural life of 
this period. In Italy more partic- 
ularly, in Provence and in Lan- 
guedoc, women spoke Latin, wrote 
verse, and encouraged arts and let- 
ters. Certain women even taught 
in universities. 
The fourteenth century provides 
many examples of women of dis- 
tinguished mind; the court of 
Queen Joan of Naples was one of 
the most brilliant of the period, and 
Christine de Pisan, daughter to 
Charles V of France's physician- 
astrologer, must have been stirred 
by the condition of women in her 
time, for apart from poems and 
tales she wrote The City of Ladies, 
a discourse on women’s education. 
She maintained that the social in- 
equality of the sexes was not dictat- 
ed by nature : “If it were the 
custom to put girls to school and 
teach them as boys are taught, 
women would understand the sub- 
tleties of art and science as well 
as men do.” It took a few cent- 
uries to fulfil this prophecy. 
Famous women in the sixteenth 
century included Margaret de Na- 
The winning of 
li-being and that of their homes and chil- 
dren. In 1911 when Danish women gained the right to vote, they acknowledged it in a warm display of loyalty to the King.

varre, sister of Francis I; Margaret

and Miss de Gournay, who was 
Montaigne’s adopted daughter and 
wrote a treatise on the equality of 
men and women. So much for 
France. In Italy, Angela di Bres- 
cia founded the Ursuline order 
(1337). In Great Britain, we have 
Queen Elizabeth of England and 
Mary, Queen of Scots. 
Two independent and unpreju- 
diced minds of the sixteenth cen- 
tury, the great Erasmus and Cor- 
nelius Agrippa, championed the 
education of women and their 
access to professions then closed 
to them. 
No legal status 
Nx the following century, in 
France at the time of the 
Fronde, some great ladies 
played an active part in politics, 
while others greatly influenced lite- 
rature. If was not long before 
the question of women’s right to 
education, and of their civil rights, 
which had been left to custom and 
the good pleasure of parents, arose 
in a compelling form. 
In ancient French and English 
law, an unmarried woman Or a 
widow could go to law, enter into 
a contract, or make a will in the 
same way as a man. But with 
marriage a woman lost all legal 
status from this point of view. 
In England, Mary Astell (1668- 
1731) was the author of two works 
demanding the equality of the 
sexes in family and social life. 
Later, Elizabeth Montagu and 
Hannah More, through their 
writings and their influence, 
continued the struggle for women’s 
rights. Mary Wollstonecraft was 
also devoted to the same cause; 
her Vindication of the Rights of 
Women (1792) claimed economic 
rights for women — a prerequisite 
of social and political equality — 
particularly as regards the labour- 
ing classes. This work was de- 
dicated to Talleyrand, who had 
recommended equal education for 
both sexes. 
France of the eighteenth century 
had made little progress in these 
matters from the legal point of 
view, but shortly before the Revo- 
lution there was a great advance 
in outlook particularly among the 
bourgeoisie 
Sadly prophetic 
HEN the States General were 
\W convoked in France in 1789, 
women presented petitions 
for their cause. A pamphlet 
demanded that they become eligible 
for membership of the Assembly. 
Dressmakers, embroideresses and 
modistes called for the protection 
of their professions, “not to usurp 
men’s authority, but to be more 
highly considered, and to be shel- 
tered from adversity”. 
The women’s movement was led 
by Olympe de Gouges, who pub- 
lished an eloquent Declaration of 
the Rights of Woman : 
“Woman is born free and equal 
to man in rights. The principle of 
all sovereignty resides entirely in 
the nation, which is but the asso- 
ciation of men and women... The 
law must be the same for all... A 
woman has the right to mount the 
scaffold; she should also have the 
right to mount the tribune.” 
This last sentence proved sadly 
prophetic, for Olympe de Gouges 
was guillotined in 1793, for having 
opposed the principles of the 
Terror. 
After lively controversies during 
the nineteenth century the women's

Though most countries have recognized the principle of equal rights for both sexes, women are still 
subject to some inequalities and anomalies in their work and everyday lives. But wherever the oppor- 
tunity has been given to them, they have more than proved their capacity to meet responsibilities of 
citizenship and of professional and vocational life, whether as nurses, teachers, telephonists or artists. 
IN EVERY FIELD OF 
HUMAN ACTIVITIES 
  
a 
movement continued to expand 
under the Third Republic. In 1880, 
a few militants demanded the 
registration of women as voters. 
No positive results were secured 
by the end of the century, but 
women had succeeded in entering 
various liberal professions (the bar, 
medicine, etc.). 
In England, however, the wo- 
men's movement developed on a 
large scale, with John Stuart Mill 
as its most distinguished cham- 
pion. He wrote : “The subordina- 
tion of women stands out as an 
isolated fact in the midst of 
modern institutions... It is a relic 
of an ancient intellectual and 
moral world, destroyed everywhere, 
yet preserved in a single aspect.” 
In the House of Commons, when 
the electoral (reform) bill of 1867 
was discussed, he proposed the 
substitution of the word “person” 
for “man” (as has been done, by 
the way, in the Universal Declara- 
tion of 1948). His motion was 
defeated by 196 votes to 86. The 
women’s movement pointed out 
that, several centuries before, 
women had had the right of 
suffrage, and that no legal act 
had been passed to deprive them 
of it. Many women thereupon 
-entered themselves on the electoral 
lists, but the authorities struck 
their names off. However, the 
movement grew and enfranchise- 
  
  
ment for local clections was finally 
obtained. , 
In most countries political rights 
were finally conceded to women 
in the twentieth century. 
In England, the “suffragette” 
movement was vigorously con- 
ducted by Christabel Pankhurst 
and Annie Kenney. These two 
women unflinchingly used the 
most riotous forms of publicity — 
public demonstrations, tumultuous 
meetings, etc. 
Hunger-strikers 
oMEN’s eligibility for muni- 
\W cipal office was secured 
in 1907, but this merely 
stimulated the emancipationists to 
further efforts. Windows were 
broken, letter-boxes were des- 
troyed, and the Prime Minister 
was insulted in the House of 
Commons by suffragettes who had 
managed to enter in disguise. 
When the militants were put in 
prison, they promptly went on 
hunger-strike. 
When the first World War broke 
out in 1914 they declared a truce 
and went into war service. The 
partisans of women’s suffrage 
continued to increase; shortly be- 
fore the end of the war, in 1918, 
the Representation of the People 
Act was carried, giving voting 
rights to women over thirty years 
of age. This Act was completed, 
in 1928, by a measure that entitled 
women to vote at the same age as 
men. 
In France, between 1897 and 
1927, married women obtained the 
right to retain their nationality, 
to dispose of their salaries, to go to 
law, and to be guardians. They 
also secured the right to higher 
education. 
The Constitution of the Fourth 
Republic gave women the same 
political and civil rights as men, as 
1s now the case in most countries. 
In the United States, women had, 
shortly before the end of the 1914- 
1918 war, secured the right to vote, 
by virtue of an amendment to the 
Constitution. 
In the political field, the greatest 
progress in the fight for women’s 
rights has been made since the end 
of World War I. Before 1914 only 
four countries — Australia, Fin- 
land, New Zealand and Norway —- 
accorded voting rights to women. 
By 1918, the number had increased 
to 13, though in some cases rights 
were resiricted. Between 1917 and 
1945, however, a further 34 States 
gave women the right to vote, and 
in the first four years after World 
War II, women in 12 other coun- 
tries finally enjoyed this right. 
Yet by 1949, in only 52 of these 
59 States did women have full 
voting rights with men and in a 
number of other countries the right 
is still withheld. Since 194C the 
United Nations has been working 
to end such discrimination. One 
country which recently (November 
6, 1952) accorded voting rights to 
women is the Lebanon. Here, 
women form the majority of the 
voting population — 395,000 com- 
pared with 385,000 men of voting 
age. 
During the past fifty years 
women have played an increasing 
part in the professions, in industry 
and in public affairs. In many 
countries they hold public office as 
cabinet ministers and some are 
serving their countries as ambassa- 
dors. Recently an Indian woman 
diplomat, Mrs. Vijaya Lakshmi 
Pandit, sister of Prime Minister 
Nehru of India, was elected Pre- 
sident of the United Nations Ge- 
neral Assembly. 
Though women have proved 
their capacity to meet all the res- 
ponsibilities of citizenship and of 
professional and vocational life 
they are still subjeet to many in- 
equalities andanomalies. Discrimi- 
nation regarding employment and 
education are two examples. The 
United Nations is working to bring 
about a wider application of the 
principle of “equal pay for equal 
work” and, in co-operation with 
Unesco, to ensure that women are 
accorded equal educational oppor- 
tunities with men.

### 70610: The Right to differ

THE RIGHT TO DIFFER 
yr “The happiness of the 
times was extraordinary. 
because it was lawful to 
think what you wished, 
and to say what you 
thought”. 
o wrote the Roman historian 
Tacitus in the first century of 
the Christian era when he sel 
down his account of life under one 
of the nine Roman emperors 
through whose reigns he lived. 
Tacitus was fortunate to be able to 
record such a state of affairs, for 
in the eighteen centuries which 
have passed since he wrote his 
Histories, freedom of thought and 
expression has been the exception 
rather than the rule. 
Even today there are few places 
in the world where the diffusion of 
ideas is not restricted in one way 
or another. In the 1948 Declaration 
of Human Rights the Article 
regarded as the most daring—some 
people refer to it as Utopian—is 
Article 19 which states that the 
right to freedom of opinion and 
expression includes “freedom to 
seek, receive and impart in- 
formation and ideas through any 
media and regardless of frontiers”. 
Now the right to impart an idea 
is quite different from mere 
freedom of thought. Although the 
theocratic and absolutist regimes 
have been the only ones to pursue 
heresy and insubordination into the 
very conscience of men, most 
authorities, even liberal and de- 
mocratic ones, have appointed 
limits to the right to propagate 
ideas that every man can hold as 
his private view. These limits 
have often been somewhat strict in 
the case of political and social 
ideas that are considered sub- 
versive either by governments or 
by majority opinion. 
At what point does an individual 
cease to have the right to say 
everything, to spread his opinions, 
broadcast and to criticize every- 
thing? At what point do the 
authorities begin to have the right 
of defending themselves against 
attack or of protecting existing 
societies from destruction? 
We can only note that in the 
course of history, and particularly 
for the last two hundred years, 
constant progress has made the 
propagation of ever more daring 
ideas possible; that cruel, corrupt 
and unhealthy regimes are vul- 
nerable to such freedom of ex- 
pression; but that regimes founded 
on the free consent of individuals 
draw strength from it. At all 
  
periods, the progress of civilization 
has been retarded by lack of 
freedom in the dissemination of 
ideas and opinions. An idea 
cannot be killed by censorship or 
prohibition, but its advance can 
long be delayed. 
The invention of printing in the 
fifteenth century placed a formi- 
dable ‘weapon in the hands of 
innovators and reformers, whose 
resources increased with the spread 
of pamphlets and, later, perio- 
dicals. Little brochures like those 
printed in the United Provinces of 
Holland were the best, and the most 
feared by absolute monarchs. 
The propaganda “war” ‘waged 
between Louis XIV and the Dutch 
gazetteers is an amusing instance 
of this. The Dutch, feeling that 
their independence ‘was threatened, 
encouraged these gazettes. Louis 
XIV, powerless to stop their 
circulation, remonstrated with the 
Dutch authorities. The latter pro- 
mised to take severe measures 
against the gazettes, but did 
nothing whatever. Louis XIV then 
paid gazetteers to attack and abuse 
the Government of the United 
Provinces, and thus a sort of 
compromise was effected. But it 
remained the custom to stamp 
“Printed in Amsterdam” on most 
of the clandestine books in France, 
especially those written by philo- 
sophers. 
At the time of the American War 
of Independence, the ‘writings of 
Tom Paine, The Crisis and Common 
Sense, recruited many a soldier for 
George Washington's armies. In 
Paris, from 1789 to the time of the 
Directoire, people devoured po- 
litical newspapers, but freedom of 
opinion was under a cloud during 
the Consulate and Empire, owing 
to the severity of Napoleon's police. 
The struggle ‘was renewed under 
the Restoration, and’ public feeling 
was so strong on the side of 
freedom of opinion that the seizing 
and destroying of the Temps and 
the National newspapers’ printing 
presses ‘was the signal for the 1830 
revolution, which put an end to the 
Bourbon dynasty. Under Napo- 
leon III, newspapers expressing 
political opinions kept alive the 
republican faith and since 1871, 
freedom of opinion has remained 
a tradition in the French press. 
On the other hand, French 
tradition is less tolerant than that 
of England and America as regards 
open-air meetings in streets and 
parks, and the right of every man 
to give vent to his views in 
public places. In this matter, each 
country has its own customs and 
characteristics. But there are few 
nations, if any, where the diffusion 
of all ideas by every available 
means is permitted without re- 
striction. 
There is no doubt that, in certain 
parts of the world, freedom of in- 
formation is in retrogression. On 
the other hand it is noteworthy. that 
the new Republic of India has, 
through its Constituent Assembly, 
proclaimed the right to freedom of 
speech and expression for all iis 
citizens. 
When it comes to be generally 
admitted that it is jp sign of 
strength in authorities to grant all 
citizens a wide measure of freedom 
of discussion, and that to suppress 
that freedom is a sign of fear and 
therefore of weakness, Article 19 
of the 1948 Declaration will readily 
find its place in national legal 
systems. 
At present, however, the various 
authorities, and even certain sec- 
tions of public opinion, are not 
ready to give this sign of strength. 
They still believe in suppressing 
opposition, which means that they 
fear that free discussion would be 
fatal to their own ideas. They sin 
from a great lack of faith, perhaps 
because they have never seriously 
taken stock of their own ideas. 
He who holds strong opinions 
and feels he can make them 
prevail seeks free discussion and 
does not retreat from it. He who 
needs freedom in order to impart 
ideas which he feels to be right 
does not fear the freedom of others. 
These principles are equally 
applicable to freedom of religion. 
From time immemorial, men con- 
vinced that they possess the truth 
have thought it their duty to im- 
pose it, by law or force, on other 
men whose idea of the truth was 
different, and those who serve one 
god have called those who serve 
another god, “infidels”. 
It was often easy, in days gone 
by, to convert a whole nation to the 
religion of its ruler; but it has 
always been difficult to make men 
of one belief live peacefully side 
by side with men of another. 
Nevertheless, tolerance was 
widely practised in ancient times 
especially in the Far East. An- 
cient Chinese philosophy, for ins- 
tance, was based on a doctrine 
known as “non-injury”, or “non- 
interference”, that is, non-inter- 
ference "vith the rights and lives of 
others. In seventh century Japan, 
Prince Shotoku promulgated a 
system of laws that were dis- 
tinguished by their humanity and

i tolerance. Buddhism teaches re- 
spect for the beliefs of others. 
Hinduism, as Mahatma Gandhi 
explained, is not an exclusive 
religion, It tells everyone to 
worship God according to his own 
faith or dharma, and so it lives in 
peace with all the religions. 
Jewish doctrine, taken from the 
laws of Israel, forbids hatred: 
“Thou shalt not hate thy brother in 
thy heart” ... “thou shalt love thy 
neighbour as thyself”... “thou shalt 
love a stranger as thyself...” 
Similarly, we have the example of 
Christian doctrines: “Thou shalt 
love thy neighbour as thyself” and, 
in the first epistle of St. John: “He 
that loveth not his brother whom 
he hath seen, how can he love God 
whom he hath not seen?” 
Like the (Old and New Tes- 
taments, the Koran exhorts Mos- 
lems to respect Christian beliefs. 
A striking example of this to- 
lerance was the scrupulous respect 
for freedom of worship practised 
by the Moors when they conquered 
Spain at the beginning of the 
present millenary, at a {ime when 
culturally and politically the power 
of the Arab world was greatest. 
Furthermore, this tolerance of- 
fered an example to the Christian 
world which had not always paid 
attention to the exhortation of 
Tertullian, a Doctor of the Church 
who lived from 160 to 240 A.D. 
“Allow one man to adore the true 
God”, he said, “another man to 
adore Jupiter; allow one man to 
raise his arms fo heaven, and 
another to stretch his toward the 
altar of faith... Beware that it be 
not a kind of irreligion to take 
away freedom of religion and the 
option of God, and not to allow me 
to adore the God I wish to adore...” 
Examples of tolerance, however, 
are not lacking in the Western 
world despite the persecutions and 
massacres that sometimes took 
place in the very name, and for the 
greater glory, of the God who 
preached love and forgiveness. 
In France, after the Wars of 
Religion, Henry IV pacified his 
country by the celebrated Edict of 
Nantes, of 1598; it ‘was later 
revoked by the narrow despotism 
of Louis XIV. King Sigismund of 
Transylvania allowed four re- 
ligions to be freely practised in his 
kingdom. Poland at first conceded 
religious. freedom both to Pro- 
testants and to the Greek Orthodox 
Church. The United Provinces 
(the Netherlands) recognized free- 
dom of conscience -as early as the 
seventeenth century. 
In contrast to these examples is 
that of the Inquisition which dealt 
severely with the Bogomils in 
Bosnia and with the Waldenses in 
Piedmont; and which, in Bohemia, 
sentenced John Huss to the stake. 
In France, the Inquisition was 
suppressed in 1360, but in Spain 
it came to an end only in 1806. 
It was to the eighteenth century 
that fell the honour of fighting 
religious intolerance unremittingly 
and defeating it almost every- 
where, at least legally. 
The writings of Montesquieu and 
of Voltaire, and those of the 
Encyclopedists, influenced the 
spirit of the times and the minds 
ot liberal European monarchs. 
The Emperor Joseph II, Fre- 
derick IT of Prussia and Catherine 
the Great of Russia recognized or 
extended freedom of worship. In 
England, the right to teach was 
conceded fo Catholics in 1791. The 
United States was the first country 
to make freedom of conscience a 
fundamental law. According to 
the Constitution of 1789, public 
offices could be filled by persons of 
all creeds. An amendment in- 
troduced in 1791 prescribed that 
Congress could not establish a 
State religion, or forbid the free 
exercise of any religion. 
In France, freedom of worship 
was instituted in 1795. Bonaparte 
NOVEMBER 1953. Page 15 
settled the relations between the 
Catholic Church and the State by 
the Concordat of 1801, ~which 
remained in force until the 
complete separation of Church and 
State in 1902. The Protestant and 
Jewish religions benefited from 
the terms of the Concordat, which 
established unrestricted freedom of 
conscience throughout all French 
territories. 
Other concordats were concluded 
between Pope Pius IX and Austria 
Spain, and the main States o! 
Germany and South America. Re- 
ligious persecution, properly =o 
called, had disappeared from the 
Western world. It reappeared, in 
an aggravated form, under {o- 
talilarian regimes, that nightmare 
of modern times. 
We should not forget, however, 
that if the spirit of persecution is 
declining in the matter of religious 
beliefs it has never been more 
aggressive in the political and the 
social sphere. The old intolerance 
characteristic of religious fanatics 
has reappeared in disturbing 
fashion in regard to persons who 
do not conform to prevailing po- 
litical doctrines. In various placess 
in this respect the final conquest of 
the rights of the human person in 
our world of today is far from 
having been achieved.

Bevin, speaking as Great Britain's Mi- 
nister of Foreign Affairs, said he 
wished that he and other British people who 
felt like going abroad could do so without 
having to worry about anything else but the 
purchase of a rail, air or steamer ticket. 
These are the sentiments of people in every 
country in the world today for whom the 
simple act of crossing a frontier involves 
the filling in of innumerable application forms 
for passports, visas and currency allowances. 
“Everyone has the right to freedom of 
movement and residence within the borders of 
each State.” — “‘Everyone has the right to 
leave any country, including his own, and to 
return to his country.” 
So states Article 13 of the Universal Decla- 
ration of Human Rights. While this article is 
readily acknowledged in theory, it is far from 
being put into practice everywhere. And even 
in areas where freedom of movement is 
accorded there are inevitable obstacles in the 
shape of forms and formalities. 
It can certainly be said that in the twentieth 
century, freedom of movement has suffered a 
setback despite the tremendous improvement 
and development of means of transport bet- 
ween one part of the world and another. 
This is obvious when we look back on the 
historical sequence of events that has led to 
this paradoxical situation. 
Primitive communities generally regarded a 
stranger as an enemy, or at least as a suspect. 
However, as soon as men began to trade and 
barter, the advantage of allowing travellers 
freedom of movement was recognized. 
A few years ago, the late Mr. Ernest 
Pioneer travellers 
great routes followed by the merchants 
were channels of prosperity, carrying 
fruitful knowledge from country to country, 
from continent to continent. To take one 
example, the travels of Marco Polo, the Vene- 
tion, at the end of the thirteenth century had 
an immense effect on life in the Western 
world. 
In the fifteenth and eighteenth centuries, 
the Portuguese and Dutch, who were great 
traders and navigators, stood in the forefront 
as pioneers of international freedom of mo- 
vement. Pilgrims, too, played a great part in 
developing international relations. Jerusalem, 
Benares and Mecca attracted the faithful by 
hundreds of thousands, and on the roads 
leading to them there were countless inns and 
chapels, so many meeting-places where goods 
T HROUGHOUT the Middle Ages, the 
ond ideas were exchanged between travellers 
from alt lands. 
In Europe, feudal particularism tended to 
box communications, or at least to hamper 
them, through tolls and other taxes. On the 
other hand, the Crusades created many 
contacts with the Near East, the Byzantine 
Empire and the Moslem countries, most of 
which possessed a high degree of civilization. 
As trade increased, the exporting countries 
were more ready to welcome strangers. In 
the fourteenth century, Ghent, Brussels, Ant- 
werp and Louvain were open to all. 
The great discoveries in the fifteenth and 
sixteenth centuries led to large-scale emi- 
gration to the New World; some emigrants 
left Europe to escape religious or political 
persecution. These constituted an élite, whose 
love of freedom left its mark on the new 
countries’ institutions. 
In the fields of culture, man’s freedom of 
movement produced especially beneficial 
effects. When Irish monks journeyed to Italy, 
when Albertus Magnus and Saint Thomas 
Aquinas taught in Paris, Erasmus in Oxford 
and Copernicus in Bologna, when students of 
all countries flocked to the great universities 
of Salamanca, Coimbra, Montpellier, Toulouse, 
Cambridge and Heidelberg, it is hard to say 
which derived the greater benefit from these 
sojourns, the traveller or the place itself. 
No passport needed 
ARIOUS factors, of course, combined to 
Y curtail freedom of movement. Travel 
by road was anything but safe ; and the 
pirates who infested the seas often made jour- 
neying positively dangerous. Unquestion- 
ably, however, the eighteenth and nineteenth 
centuries saw a great increase in travelling 
facilities.  Unpoliced areas grew smaller, and 
the rapidity of transport increased by leaps 
and bounds. The Atlantic, which in former 
times had often taken several months to cross, 
was usually crossed in under three weeks by 
the large sailing vessels of 1850, and by the 
steamships of 1900 in a week. Where a 
coach had taken two weeks to cross a big 
European country, the railway train took 
twenty hours. Continents that had hitherto 
been pronounced “impenetrable” were opened 
to explorers, colonists, traders and promoters 
of industry, 
It would seem that the first fourteen years 
of the twentieth century marked the apex of 
man’s freedom of movement on earth. Not 
only were time, cost and insecurity then 
reduced to a minimum, but the obstacles 
placed in the way of travellers by States had 
almost entirely vanished. In 1913 one could 
travel without a passport in all Europe, with 
the exception of Russia and Turkey. What is 
more, currencies were easily exchanged, and 
even tended to become standardized. 
But after the 1914-1918 war, human 
obstacles to freedom of movement increased ; 
passports, formalities and restrictions reap- 
peared. The New World was partially closed 
to immigrants. After the 1939-1945 war diffi- 
culties became general, and were added to by 
financial regulations. Today, despite marked 
improvements in aircraft and automobiles, the 
delightful freedom of movement of 1913 is no 
more than a memory. 
A brooding fear 
OT only in entering various countries, 
N but in leaving them, the traveller comes 
up against regulations that everyone 
deems excessive, but that nevertheless exist. 
In most cases they are direct or indirect evi- 
dence of the fear that broods over men and 
nations in regard to one another. 
Freedom of movement is a perfect example 
of a principle that men dare at one in pro- 
claiming but render invalid in practice. Only 
international agreement based on firm, clear- 
cut undertakings, will suffice to remove, for 
the benefit of the majority, the present obsta- 
cles which profit scarcely anyone. When Arti- 
cle 13 of the Universal Declaration has 
assumed the force of a general obligation, it 
will allow humanity once more to resume pro- 
gress in a form that is essential to its well- 
being, and individuals will again enjoy the 
exercise of a natural right: freedom of move.

UNEsco COUR 
NE of the greatest para- 
doxes of the twentieth 
century is that in an age 
of aviation, radio and 
nuclear physics, the people 
in the world who cannot 
read or write outnumber those who 
can. Although in some places the 
percentage of illiteracy is slight, 
there are also vast areas where men 
and women are mostly incapable of 
reading the instructions they receive 
or of signing their name to an agree- 
ment, and yet the right of every 
human being to education is, of all 
the rights affirmed by the United 
Nations Declaration of 1948, one of 
the least contested. 
Article 26, which deals with the 
right to education, was adopted una- 
nimously with two abstentions. The 
terms of the article are couched in 
no uncertain language, although na- 
tions and families are given all rea- 
sonable freedom in interpreting it : 
elementary education must be free 
and compulsory, technical and pro- 
fessional education must be made 
generally available, and higher 
education must be equally accessible 
to ail, on the basis of merit. 
This is the culmination of a cen- 
tury and a half of effort made in 
almost all countries with a view to 
a truly democratic distribution of 
education. A hundred years ago, not 
only did the immense majority of 
human beings not know how to read 
or write, even in the Western world, 
but the idea of making education 
accessible to all appeared, to many, 
to be dangerously Utopian. Yet 
today such ideas have triumphed 
throughout the world. 
The principle is now admitted, but 
in many countries it is not applied. 
There are countries where education 
cannot be made accessible to all, for 
lack of resources. There are those 
again, where such a state of things 
is not really desired, because certain 
elements doggedly resist it, eg. - 
governments that are not in too 
great a hurry to turn their subjects 
into citizens capable of understand- - 
ing and criticizing the conduct of 
public affairs. 
Some people have been surprised 
to find the word “compulsory” in an 
article that deals only with “rights”. 
But to each right corresponds the 
obligation of others to respect that 
right. The right of children and 
students is inseparable here from 
the obligations of parents and the 
State, whose responsibilities, in this 
respect, are joint. There are other 
rights, that those who hold them 
can make prevail through the vote, 
the power to act collectively, and so 
forth. Youth is deprived of such 
weapons, 
Fears and objections 
education the child, the youth 
and the young girl have the 
right to receive; and who, parents 
or State, should decide this. There 
is no single universal answer, because 
conditions vary greatly and most 
communities are very jealous of 
their independence in this matter. 
Some countries have made reser- 
vations regarding possible inter- 
ference by the State usurping the 
role of families and inculcating ideas 
contrary to those of the parents. 
These reservations are of two Kinds: 
Some quarters fear that the State 
might infringe the rights of minori- 
ties, uproot legitimate traditions and 
respected customs, obliterate region- 
al characteristics, and establish arbi- 
trary uniformity. 
A like objection is raised through 
fear of totalitarian methods ; people 
are concerned lest the State should 
mass produce little soldiers for the 
régime, fanatically attached to a 
party or man in power and dead to 
the exercise of free thought and 
civic responsibility. 
The first category, then, fear the 
misuse of new ideas in the education 
of their children, and the second are 
concerned to avoid tyrannical forms 
of collective discipline. The first 
fear that child will be deprived of 
tested values and that his thinking 
will drift towards anarchy. The 
second are afraid that he will not 
think at all. 
To meet these apprehensions, Ar- 
ticle 26 gives parents a prior right to 
choose the kind of education that 
shall be given to their children. But 
this does not give them the right to 
leave their children without educa- 
tion. In any case, parents’ rights 
are not absolute ; they cease when 
the child comes of age. 
In many countries, the democratic 
State has had to contend with

COURIER 
family opposition that was not always 
inspired by a desire to preserve tra- 
ditions. It has often been a question 
of greedily exploiting a child by 
setting him to hard manual work 
instead of teaching him how to read. 
The idea of equality has some- 
times led to misunderstanding. It is 
not a case of equality in the results 
of education, these depend upon 
vocation and effort. Equality means 
that every child should be given an 
equal chance at the outset of its 
pursuit of learning. Not so very long 
ago, in certain countries that are 
foremost in modern civilization, the 
price of a good, complete education 
was prohibitive for anyone of modest 
means. 
the Declaration of Independence of 
the United States, seems to have 
been the most keen and far-seeing 
of the pioneers in this respect. For 
him, the normal exercise of demo- 
cracy necessarily implied a relatively 
high degree of education among the 
citizens. 
Great pioneers 
EFFERSON wrote: “Popular edu- 
J cation producesself-government, 
and popular government is nei- 
ther sure nor efficacious if the 
people are not educated”. 
It is largely due to him and to 
Benjamin Franklin that the United 
States was the first nation to 
    
  
What must be popularized are the 
means of acquiring culture. Whether 
it is thereafter obtained depends on 
personal effort. What is essential is 
that no human being who really 
wishes to learn should be prevented 
from doing so by reasons extraneous 
to culture — distance, class preju- 
dice, or financial obstacles. 
In a word, the acquiring of culture 
should be free and difficult, not 
expensive and easy. 
The history of education, at va- 
rious periods, bears a clear relation 
to the history of civilization at those 
periods. But it must not be confused 
with the history of the right to 
education, a comparatively recent 
ideal. There have been periods of 
great culture when education was 
fairly closely reserved for the pri- 
vileged classes. 
It was really only after the 
recognition and proclamation, at the 
end of the eighteenth century, of the 
civil rights of the person, that it 
became clear how valueless those 
civil rights would prove if a citizen 
did not enjoy, fully and equally with 
others, the right to education. 
Thomas Jefferson, the author of 
establish free and compulsory edu- 
cation. (It had been compulsory in 
Sweden and Denmark since 1719, 
but not free). 
The great French advocates of the 
idea that education should be 
accessible to all were Condorcet, 
Carnot, Guizot, and later Paul Bert 
and Jules Ferry. In England, the 
leaders of the movement were John 
Stuart Mill and Huxley and, so far 
as post-school education was con- 
cerned, Owen, Kingsley and Ruskin; 
in Germany, Wilhelm von Humboldt; 
and in Russia, Tolstoy, who wrote 
simple stories of a few lines for 
children learning how to read. 
For the very modern conquest of 
the universal right to education, the 
ground had been prepared, of course, 
by all the great educators who, 
throughout the ages, had tried 
to promote study and raise its 
level. Some struggled against the 
ignorance that was too generally 
accepted as being the lot of the 
poor classes, of other races, or of 
women. 
Others fought against false forms 
of culture, like dogmatic or routine 
education, sciences that had become 
petrified in false formulae, or 
pedantic and lifeless knowledge. 
At the dawn of modern times, while 
Comenius, Thomas More, Erasmus, 
Budé, Vives and Montaigne planned 
the lines of a powerful new culture, 
Rabelais and later Moliére cruelly 
satirized the shallow and soulless 
learning of incompetent teachers 
or doctors. 
As regards rational pedagogy, this 
came to growth mainly in the 
nineteenth century. Its great 
pioneer was Pestalozzi in Switzer- 
land ; he died in 1827. Others were 
Froebel, Miss Edgeworth (Scotland), 
Channing and Horace Mann (United 
States), and, more recently, Mrs. 
Montessori and many others. 
India, China and Persia have 
always honoured the man of letters, 
the scholar and the artist. Once 
material conditions allow of elemen- 
tary and subsequently higher educ- 
ation accessible to all, these great 
countries with their ancient tradi- 
tions of culture will make tremen- 
dous contributions to human civili- 
zation, which must call, more than 
ever before, upon the efforts of all 
its children. 
In our times, whole continents, 
where lower standards of living 
seemed inseparable from an equally 
low standard of education, are now 
adopting popular education, acces- 
sible to all. This, as Jefferson said, 
is essential to any democratic regime 
based on popular endorsement. 
Recognizing that human dignity 
demands that all men be educated 
with a view to the preservation of 
justice, freedom and peace, the 
United Nations wrote the right to 
education into the Universal Decla- 
ration of 1948. 
Unesco, whose constitution enjoins 
it “to advance through the educa- 
tional, scientific and cultural 
relations of the peoples of the world, 
NOVEMBER 1953. Page 17 
the objectives of international peace 
and of the common welfare of 
mankind”, has a major role in the 
implementation of this right. 
In a “Basic Programme” drawn 
up in 1950 Unesco broadly defined 
its task with regard to education as 
follows: “To help Member States to 
ensure that their educational systems 
are adequate in every way to meet 
the needs of society and of the indi- 
vidual.” 
As well as helping its Member 
States to improve their existing 
educational systems, Unesco has 
taken the initiative in helping them 
to extend these systems to meet new 
needs. There are areas where 
schools are almost unknown ; illi- 
teracy is widespread and even on 
the increase. There are deficient 
and handicapped children who 
require special treatment. Adult 
education must be developed every- 
where for “you cannot have a wholly 
educated younger generation amid 
an adult society remaining sunk in 
ignorance.” 
Wider horizons 
HAT is why Unesco, in colla- 
boration with its Member 
States and with the United 
Nations and some of the Specialized 
Agencies has undertaken a pro- 
gramme for the development of 
what is known as “fundamental 
education”, particularly intended for 
the vast underdeveloped areas of 
the world. 
Literacy teaching is just one aspect 
of fundamental education. It merely 
opens up wider horizons which lead 
to campaigns for the improvement 
of health, living standards, food 
production and hygiene. Its aim is 
“to help people to achieve the social 
and economic progress which will 
enable them to take their place in 
the modern world.” 
To bring fundamental education 
to all who need it requires a great 
many teachers possessing the right 
techniques and teaching aids. As 
a first step to meeting this need 
Unesco has undertaken a bold expe- 
riment—the creation of a network 
of regional fundamental education 
centres where technicians receive 
practical training in this new branch 
of education. 
The basic purpose of these cen- 
tres is to produce teachers of 
teachers’, as graduates from the 
courses return to their own countries 
to staff similar centres organized on 
more local lines. In these centres 
teachers who are to work in the 
field will be trained. 
Already two regional centres are 
operating. At Patzcuaro, Mexico, 
the first course of student-teachers 
has graduated and its members have 
returned to countries in all parts of 
Latin America. The second centre 
serving Middle East countries was 
opened in Sirs El Layan, Egypt, last 
year. 
One basic aim 
O keep in touch with educa- 
tional developments through- 
out the world, Unesco has 
organized an Education Clearing 
House which carries out enquiries 
and studies in co-operation with the 
International Bureau of Education 
at Geneva, and with national docu- 
mentation centres. 
It has also sent international mis- 
sions of educators to give technical 
advice and assistance to Member 
States which ask for such help. 
Missions working on such subjects as 
primary and secondary teaching, 
literacy campaigns, adult education 
in rural communities and education 
for women, have visited such coun- 
tries as Thailand, the Philippines, 
Afghanistan, Bolivia, Burma, India, 
Pakistan, Iraq, Syria and Ecuador. 
The United Nations Programme of 
Technical Assistance has made it 
possible to increase the number of 
such missions. 
Whether it concerns itself with 
education for women, education for 
international understanding, the 
special problems of children, the 
improvement of curricula, methods 
and teaching materials, teaching 
about Human Rights and United 
Nations, or work for young people, 
all Unesco’s activities in these fields 
have one basic aim—making the 
principle of the right to education a 
practical reality.

### 70836: Twelve characters in search of rights

TWELVE 
CHARACTERS 
In search 
of rights 
  
  
characters in, fictional literature who have 
fought for the rights proclaimed in the 
Universal Declaration or who have suffered 
because they were deprived of these rights. Many 
other examples might have been chosen. World 
literature, indeed, provides numerous novels and 
plays in which one or several characters could be 
used to symbolize man’s struggle for human 
rights. The examples given here are intended 
merely as suggestions for the teacher and as an 
idea which offers almost unlimited possibilities 
for development by students in classes anywhere.

The Martyrs 
Lygia is a highly romanticized characterization of an 
early Christian martyr who does not die. But the Chris- 
tian martyrs who are burned alive, tortured and fed to the 
lions in Quo Vadis are not characters of fiction and Hen- 
ryk Sienkiewiez had no need to invent them. 
If the Albigenses, for example, or Jan Huss have inspired 
poets ; if Joan of Arc, the Quakers and Giordano Bruno 
have appeared on the stage or screen, they were not crea: 
tions of the imagination but real victims in history who 
suffered the tortures inflicted upon them by other men 
because of their religious beliefs. Perhaps no book of 
fiction can plead the cause of religious liberty or religious 
tolerance with the same force as the straight, dry account 
of a martyrology or with the persuasion of a simple 
monument in certain concentration camps. But these 
poems, these plays, these novels and films help to remind 
us that the message of the victims still needs retelling and 
that all human beliefs have had their martyrs.

century ago, however, a 
book appeared which 
oME of the greatest 
writers in history have   
 
attacked slavery, but 
while their reasoned argu- 
ments in favour of its abo- 
lition convinced the few 
who read them, they never 
succeeded in rousing pub- 
lic opinion. Just over a

anti-slavery agitation in the 
United States. Uncle Tom’s

the prophecy of a French

who wrote : “It will do

thus degraded themselves 
— Dostoevsky suffered 
forced labour, hunger and 
fear because he had believ- 
ed himself free to think as 
he pleased. His book, 
however, is not a personal 
complaint but an indict- 
ment of all forms of arbi- 
trary imprisonment. It is 
on behalf of all prisoners 
— criminals included — 
that he denounces inhuman 
treatment, cruelty and tor- 
ture. In the 19th century 
his book profoundly shock- 
ed society. Even in the 
middle of the 20th century 
his words have not lost 
their significance: “Anyone 
who has once experienced 
this unlimited mastery of 
the body, blood and soul 
of a fellow man, the power 
and full licence to inflict 
the greatest humiliation 
upon another creature made 
in the image of God, will 
unconsciously lose the mas- 
tery of his own sensations. 
The right of corporal 
punishment given to one 
man over another is one of 
the sores of social life, one 
of the strongest forces des- 
tructive of every germ, 
every effort in society 
towards civic feeling, and a 
sufficient cause for its ine. 
vitable dissolution.” 
Phileas Fogg 
HREE quarters of a century ago Jules Verne wrote his 
Round the World in 80 Days, but even to early 
twentieth century travellers this record seemed 
extremely modest. Today the thought of the *‘hasty” 
world tour made by Phileas Fogg and the superhuman 
  
efforts he made to complete the circuit of the globe in 
time to win his bet may bring smiles to the faces of 
those whe live in the age of jet airliners and rocket 
planes. But if today a new ‘Phileas wagered that he 
could leave his club on the 
instant and return to it 
eighty days later, having 
been around the world in 
the meantime, he would 
probably lose his bet. He 
would need a passport, and 
a whole series of visas. He 
would have to make reser- 
vations, apply for currency 
allotments, be medically 
examined, undergo innocul- 
ations... and even then he 
would probably still be 
waiting for a visa. In other 
words his trip would re- 
quire weeks of prepar- 
ations. The relative ease 
with which Phileas Fogg 
moved from country to 
country serves to remind 
us how many obstacles 
have since been raised to 
prevent everyone from in- 
joving... “the right to freedom of movement... to leave 
any country including his own... and to return...” 
Nora 
N lbsen’s A Doll's House, Nora is not a woman 
oppressed by a cruel master or crushed by inhuman 
treatment. On the contrary, her husband Torvald 
loves her dearly and treats her with the utmost tenderness.

«1, IKE many fond parents”, 
wrote Charles Dickens, “I 
have in my heart of hearts 
a favourite child, and his name is 
David Copperfield”. Dickens’ 
book remains one of the most 
loved and one of the most moving 
pieces of fiction in the English 
language. To young people, living 
normal family lives and who are 
not forced to go out to work at 
the age of ten, David’s experiences 
are a reminder that they are for- 
tunate to be warmly clothed, to 
have a home, to be adequately fed, 
and to go to a good school. 
Though it is over a century since 
Dickens told his story of David 
Copperfield, he still speaks out on 
behalf of the millions of children 
who grow up as he himself did, 
abandoned or at best merely tole- 
rated, victims of unkindness, of 
want or simply of the ignorance 
of their elders. Dickens died over 
80 years ago but his young hero 
still speaks in the name of all 
children who are today deprived 
of the “right to education” and 
“the right to special care and 
assistance” affirmed in the Uni. 
versal Declaration.

But to him she is no more than a 
little girl—or an amusing doll. 
“Only lean on me”, he tells her, 
“I will counsel you, and guide 
you. I should be no true man 
if this very womanly help- 
lessness did not make you 
doubly dear in my eyes.” 
When she revolts at the end of 
the play it is to claim only one 
right: that of being a person. 
Nora reminds Torvald that no 
marriage can be built on inequa- 
lity. And as she slams the door 
of her doll’s house behind her 
with irrevocable . finality, she 
declares that she is going to try 
to become a reasonable human 
being, to try to understand the 
world—in short to become a 
woman not a doll to flatter her 
husband’s selfish vanity. Al- 
though Ibsen did not write A 
Doll's House as a feminist play, 
it still stands today as a classic 
expression of the theme of 
woman’s rights. Nora delibera- 
tely leaving her husband and 
family shocked Ibsen’s contempo- 
raries, and though it roused towers 
of argument in many countries, 
it had the effect of a tremendous

cho, “is one of the most precious gifts that the heavens 
have bestowed sn men; with it the treasures locked in 
the earth or hidden in the depths of the sea are not to 
be compared; for the sake of freedom, as for the sake of 
honour, one may and should risk one’s life, and captivity, 
on the other hand, is the greatest evil that can befall a 
human being. You have seen, Sancho, the abundance 
and luxury in that castle we have just left; yet I assure 
you that in the midst of those delicious banquets and 
snow-cooled beverages it seemed to me as though I were 
in the straits of hunger, since I did not enjoy them with 
the same freedom as if they had been my own. The 
obligation to return benefits and favors received is a 
shackle on the liberty-loving spirit of man. Happy he to

The Joad Family 
T HE Joad family wanted 
to work their land 
and wanted a decent 
home to live in. But they 
had neither. Their farm 
was barren sand, parched 
by drought and swept by 
dust storms and rolling 
tumbleweeds. Like thou- 
sands of farmers in Oklaho- 
ma and other southwestern 
states, the Joads were 
reaping the Grapes of 
Wrath sown by their grand- 
fathers who had recklessly 
misused the land, “skimmed 
off the cream” and left 
them with a Dust Bowl. 
Unable to make a living 
they took to the roads, and 
instead of Oklahomans 
became “Qakies”, 20th cen- 
of a follower of the Buddha who accepts water from her 
hands and teaches her to judge herself, not by the artifi- 
cial values that society attaches to the accidents of birth, 
but by her capacity for love and service. Tagore was 
not only a great Indian poet but a great social thinker. 
‘Perhaps nowhere is the essence jof his social philosophy 
enshrined better than in the ringing lines of his poem 
on Freedom: “Where the mind is without fear and the 
head is held high; Where knowledge is free; Where the 
world has not been broken jup into fragments by narrow 
domestic walls; ‘Where words come out from the depths 
of truth... Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let 
my .country awake.”

ved country, his grief at the widespread demoralization 
he finds among his own people, epitomize the sufferings 
of his race. Cry, the Beloved Country is a novel of love 
not hate, of hope and courage springing from the daunt- 
less spirit of man. It lacks entirely the bitterness, dogma- 
tism and exaggerated melodrama which disfigures most 
fictional treatments of race relations. It is a book steep- 
ed in sadness over man’s inhumanity to man but it is 
illuminated by a compassion and a generosity of spirit 
which is as rare as it is beautiful and moving. The book 
suggests that there are men of good intentions every- 
where but still not enough of them to rebuild society in 
terms of equality, justice and generosity. 
William Tell 
«TT HE will of the people shall be the basis of the 
authority of government” states the Universal 
Declaration. This is essential “if man is not to 
be compelled to have recourse, as a last resori, to rebel- 
lion against tyranny and oppression.” The struggle 
against tyranny throughout history has been illustrated in 
all languages and in the most ancient tales and legends. 
Perhaps the most famous tale is that of William Tell, the 
Swiss hero, now a universal hero. Many versions of the 
Tell legend exist. In Friedrich Schiller’s play, the tyrant 
Gessler continues to crush the people with his intolerable 
injustice until William, the ckilled erossbowman, rises 
“to defend and avenge all men” and rids the land of the 
oppressor. A similar story is told of Egil, in Scandi- 
navian legend ; of Toki, the Danish hero ; of Eindridi, 
in Norse legends, and of Adam Bell in English ballads.

‘EVERYONE HAS THE RIGHT 
TO CLIMB TO THE TOP OF A TREE 
by Andréa Salieri 
HE “Sauvage” was really 
right after all. Even if 
he did cause the two 
scandals which created 
such. an uproar in the class on 
human rights in our small school. 
We had nicknamed him the 
“Sauvage” because he let his hair 
grow so long, because of the 
acrobatic tricks he was always 
performing, and the earsplitting 
shrieks which filled the courtyard 
as he raced gleefully from school 
each day. But that didn't 
prevent him from being an 
excellent student. He ‘was ex- 
tremely well liked by our teacher 
even though he once admitted 
(privately of course) that the 
“Sauvage” sometimes terrified 
him. 
Our school, located at the edge 
of a small village in central 
France, had only one teacher 
and only one classroom—like so 
many other schools in France 
today. One day, the teacher 
decided to organize a small ex- 
hibition on human rights. He set 
up a series of beautiful white 
panels with the 30 Articles of the 
Universal Declaration displayed 
in large printed type. There 
were simple explanations for 
each Article, and many photo- 
graphs and engravings to illus- 
trate them. 
And then the “Sauvage” 
stepped in with his scandal. 
On the first night of the 
inauguration of the exhibition, the 
“Sauvage” got hold of a huge 
sheet of paper and wrote out the 
following inscription: “Article 31: 
Everyone has the right to climb 
up to the top of the tree”. The next 
morning he nailed his notice to 
the trunk of the chestnut tree 
which rose majestically in the 
middle of the courtyard. Its 
lowest branches were some 30 
feet above the ground. 
The notice was a huge success 
with all the students. We roared 
with laughter. And yet we felt 
there was something embarrass- 
ing about the whole thing like 
a poor joke, not in very good 
taste; and almost sacriligious. 
“He’s making fun of human 
rights”, one boy whispered. 
What surprised us most, how- 
ever, was that the teacher didn't 
get at all angry. He merely 
announced that he recognized the 
handwriting. And after the 
“Sauvage” admitted that he had 
done it, the teacher turned fo him 
and asked simply: “What on 
earth made you want to do that?” 
The “Sauvage” hung his head 
and fidgeted, but made no reply. 
“What did you want to do”, asked 
the teacher, “make fun of the 
exhibition?” This .jerked the 
“Sauvage” out of his silence. 
“Oh no”, he protested. “It wasn’t 
that at all. It was just an idea I 
had...” 
It took him five full minutes to 
explain his idea, simple though it 
was. “In other words”, said the 
teacher, “it’s one thing to have 
rights and quite another to be able 
to exercise them. Is that what 
vou were driving at? If it is, I 
agree with you.” 
The fact is that the “Sauvage” 
knew the text of the Universal 
Declaration quite well. He had 
noted, for example, that “Every- 
one has the right to property”. 
But his parents had no property 
except their clothes and their 
furniture. He had also read: 
“Evervone has the right to rest 
and leisure”, and that reminded 
him how tired his mother was 
 : FEN ed A 
every evening—too tired to speak 
and too tired even to eat when the 
family sat down to dinner. She, 
of course, had the right to leisure 
—in principle. 
He had also read: “Everyone 
has the right to education”. But 
-in class he had learned that there 
was a shortage of schools in most 
countries and that in huge regions 
of the world there were no schools 
at all. In such places children 
might well have the right to 
education, but it didn’t change 
their situation. 
“Well”, said our teacher, “I see 
you are beginning to understand. 
The Articles of the Declaration 
aren't a magic formula; they are 
rules. They point to the rights 
that people have and imply that 
everyone—that is every citizen in 
any country anywhere — should 
have the possibility of enjoying 
them. And if a person doesn't 
have the possibility then it's got 
to be given to him. By whom? 
Well, the government, the state 
or the community — in fact 
everyone. When the Declaration 
says ‘Everyone has the right to 
education’ it means ‘the commu- 
nity is required to build enough 
schools so that all children can 
get a proper education’.” 
“Everyone would have the 
right to climb up the chestnut 
tree”, said the “Sauvage” to 
himself, “if it was ‘worth the 
trouble, and if someone provided 
a ladder.” 
But he said nothing since he 
had grasped the teacher’s point 
and that was what mattered. In 
fact the “Sauvage” said nothing 
more about human rights until he 
precipitated the second scandal. 
This occurred on the day our 
{eacher discussed the great men 
of history, the martyrs and refor- 
mers to whom we owe many of 
the rights and freedoms pro- 
claimed today. At the end of the 
lesson our teacher asked us a 
question. “Do you think these 
great men succeeded”? “Do you 
think they won their fight for 
freedom and justice ?” 
Everyone of us in the class 
replied with an enthusiastic 
“ves” — the proof: being the 
Universal Declaration itself. 
Every one of us, that is, except 
the “Sauvage”. When his turn 
came {o reply he shook his head 
firmly. “It's nothing but lies,” 
he said, and ignoring the horrified 
“ohs” and “ahs” that went up 
from all of us, he went on : 
“You can't tell me that all men 
have become brothers. Or that 
justice exists everywhere today 
any more than equality. It's a 
lie.” 
Once again the teacher said 
that it was the “Sauvage” who 
was right. Ie explained that the 
fight for real freedom was not 
won — far from it. 
the Universal Declaration was 
not a communiqué of victory and 
He said that 
compared it rather to an order of 
the day. 
Then he turned to the “Sau- 
vage”. “The Declaration seems 
to make you boiling mad”, he 
said. “That’s fine. That's what 
it's supposed to do. It doesn’t 
describe human rights as they 
are but as they ought to be. 
I've told you how other men and 
women have fought in the past. 
When you think of the Declara- 
tion today, you can think of the 
rights that still don't exist, and 
you can get angry. But also try 
to think of ways in which you can 
live up to the Declaration and 
make it a reality.” 
The “Sauvage” was no longer 
thinking about the chestnut tree 
in the playground. He was some- 
-what embarrassed that the tea- 
cher seemed {0 be speaking just 
to him. But when the teacher 
suddenly asked : “Do you think 
the world is civilized — the 
people in our own country for 
example ?”, the boy's reply came 
quickly. “No, not entirely. 
Otherwise we wouldn't have to be 
taught about human rights.” 
“Well then”, said our teacher 
speaking now to the entire class, 
“Let's learn to apply human 
rights to everything in our daily 
lives. If every class everywhere 
did that, I think we'd end up in 
time being really civilized. And 
remember, if we don’t act human 
rights ourselves no-one else will 
do it for us.”
