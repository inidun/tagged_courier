### 73851: Scientists at Fontainebleau study nature preservation

Scientists At Fontainebleau 
Study Nature Preservation 
I Fontainebleau, in the very heart of one of the loveliest forests 
in France, the “Conference for the Establishment of the Inter- 
national Union for Protection of Nature” 
30 September to 7 October 1948, 
French Government, and Unesco. 
Since the beginning of the cen- 
tury, much consideration has 
been given to the International 
Protection of Nature; under 
Unesco’s sponsorship, practical 
propesals are being drawn up and 
will be given final shape at the 
Conference. 
The spiritual value of the 
beauties of nature, which must oe 
preserved for future generations, 
has been admirably described by 
G.M. Trevelyan in the following 
words: 
“By the side of religion, 
by the side of science, by 
the side of poetry and art, 
stands natural beauty, not 
as a rival to these, bul as 
the common inspirer and 
nourisher of them all, and 
with a secret of her own 
besides . . . It alone makes 
a common appeal to the 
sectar’es of all our diffe- 
rent schools of poetry and 
art, ancient and modern, 
and fo many more besides 
these. It is the highest 
common denominator in the 
spiritual life of today.” 
And Bernard de Volo, writing 
in “Fortune” on the same theme, 
says: 
“Our civilization excludes 
steadily increasing numbers 
of Americans (and men

throughout the world) from 
frst-hand knowledge of na- 
ture... streams, plants, for- 
ests, animals, plants, for- 
the effect of storm...and 
yet their need of it can 
never be extinguished...” 
In the words of Henry G. Mau- 
rice, Secretary of the Society for 
the Preservation of the Fauna 
of the [British] Empire, man 
“living in most unnatural cond.- 
tions in crowded cities, has been 
pillaging the world not only to 
supply himself with the neces- 
sities of a natural ex'stence, but 
for the creation of the means for 
and amenities of a wholly artifi- 
ial existence”. 
" This way of l.fe leads to reckless 
exploitation of the g’fts of natu- 
re. A campaign must therefore 
be launched against the gradual 
destruction of the beauty, wealtn 
and spiritual values which this 
nature lavishes on the human 
race. . 
Two Interhational Conventions 
for the Protection of Nature are 
already 'n force: the London 
Convention on African Nature 
, Protection (1933), and the Con- 
vention on Nature Protection anc 
Wild Life Preservation in the 
Western Hemisphere (1942). 
These precedents are a s:rong 
foundation for future work. and 
the efforts and achievements of 
all communit:¢s which have given 
attention to the problem will 
serve as a guide for the Fontaine- 
bleau Conference. 
At the Unesco General Confer- 
ence in Beirut next month, the 
Director-General of the Organiz..- 
tron will propose that Unesco 
convene in the same place as, 
and jg co-ord'nation with, the 
United Nations Scientific Confe- 
rence on the Conservation and 
Utilization of Natural Resources 
(UNSCUOR—scheduled for 16 
May—3 June 1949 in the U.S.A.)

ference on the Protect’on of Na-

Cheap Radio 
Receivers 
In Illiteracy Battle 
The poss bility of producing 
simplified radio receivers on 
a large scale which would be 
distributed directly through 
governments at the manufac 
turer’s selling price and at a 
cost far below current market 
prices, was seriously cons dered 
at a recent meeting in Paris 
last August of Unesco’'s Com- 
mission on Teclinical Needs of 
Press, Radio and Films, 
The proposal, one of the 
most important and far- 
reaching in the field of <du- 
cational radio, was strongly 
recommended by the Commis- 
sion as a practical means of 
combating ill'teracy in the 
world today. 
The radio experts voiced 
their conviction that consid- 
eration must be given to the 
millions of people who cannot 
read or write and whose stan- 
dards of l'ving render the pes 
session of a radio receiver an 
impossibility under present 
conditions. . 
Unesco w'l sdk tae collab- 
oration of radio manufac- 
turers to carry out thie neces- 
sary rescarch in the develop 
ment, for example, of low- 
cost valves and components, 
and in the use of printed cir- 
cu’ts calculated to give: satis- 
factory performance under 
tropical conditions. 
Although it is as yet foo 
early to state the definite 
price of such receivers, the 
Commission had in mind that 
the selling price level of the 
five recommended types of 
receivers should be of the 
order of $4.00 to $10 and consid 
cred that there is a market 
for several millions of recei- 
vers which should make such 
a project practical. 
(See Central Page for other 
details.) .         
Extraordinary Session. which was 
under the chairmanship of Dr. 
Francisco del Rio y Canedo, Mex- 
ican Ambassador to France, voted 
to “maintain the decision of the 
Mexico Conference to hold the 
Third Ordinary Session of the 
General Conference at Beirut in 
November unless prevented by 
grave obstacles.” The voting was 
34 in favour, three against (New 
Zealand, Poland and Czechoslo- 
vakia), with one abstention (Hun- 
gary). Six countries, Boliv'a, El 
Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, Uru- 
guay and Saudi Arabia) were not 
represented. 
Another resolution had been 
submitted by the Executive Board 
as an alternative if the Beirut 
choice was to be reversed. It 
suggested the convening of the 
Third Conference in November :n 
Geneva, or the convening of the 
Session in Paris in December and 
the submission of a proposal that 
the Conference adjourn to Beirut 
at a later date. 
In the debate that took place, 
the prevailing view of the dele- 
gates was that a change in the 
original decision would cause con- 
siderable moral prejudice to the 
position of Unesco in the world, 
and more especially so in the 
Middle East. But were the Third 
Conference to meet in Beirut, an 
excellent opportunity would thus 
be available to Unesco to make 
itself better known in that part 
of the world. and even to play a 
conciliatory role in the present 
delicate conjuncture. 
Commenting on the view of 
some" delegates that there were 
no political 1mplications in the 
issue under review, the New Zea- 
land representative, Dr. W.f. 
Sutch. said that if this were the 
case there would have been no 
need for the Extraordinary Ses- 
sion, and one had to face the fact 
that there was a political element 
in the decision. 
Tensions No Obstacle 
The Indian delegate, Sir Sarve- 
palli Radhakrishnan, rejected the 
idea that the state of tension pre- 
vailing in the Middle East shouli 
prevent Unesco from holding its 
Third Conference there. There 
was, he said, no place on earth 
where there was no tension. 
“It is argued that the Middle 
East today is a hot-bed of mn- 
trigues, suspicion, misunderstand- 
ing and even physical hostilities. 
But is it not our duty to go to 
a place like that to proclaim our 
ideal of humanity ? 
“Whatever decision we may 
take will be regarded as nolitical 
today. We have nothing tr do with 
politics. If we are to avoid going 
to places where there is political 
tension, where is such a place 
in the world today? 
“Beirut,” he added, “may per- 
haps be the meeting-ground of the 
intellectual Arabs and Jews and 
the General Conference may itself 
contribute to the easing of the 
tension.”

atives of twent-eight National 
Commissions and Of persons 
concerned with the setting up 
of National Commissions in 
the other Member States of 
Unesco will be held on 15 and 
16 November, 1948, :mmedi- 
ately before the opening of the 
Third Session of the Generul 
Conference at Beirut. 
Included in the Agenda jor 
this meeting are the following 
subjects for discussion—the 
role of National Commissions 
and National Co-operating 
Bodies in relation to their 
Governments and to the Se- 
cretariat of Unesco; the effect: 
iveness of National Commis- 
stons’ participation in the 1948 
programme of Unesco; co- 
operation between Commniis- 
sions and the possibility of 
direct exchanges of visits und 
publications between Commis- 
sions, and the review of the 
action taken by the Secretar- 
iat to carry out the Resolu- 
tions of the Second Session of 
the General Conference on 
National Commissions. 
A further meeting of the 
representatives will be held 
during the closing days of the 
Conference to enable them to 
discuss the responsibility of 
National Commissions in rela-

SCIENTIFIC WORK 
AT the ceremony on September 
* 10. :n the Great Hall of Mon- 
tevideo University, which brought 
to a close the first Scientific Co- 
operation Conference convened by 
Unesco in Latin America, a prom-

amid applause from the govern 
ment and university dignitaries 
present : 
“This is one of :he most im- 
poriant moments in the history of 
Latin Amer’can science.” 
That exclamation was a tribute 
to the efforts of some of the most 
distinguished representatives of 
science in Latin America who had 
come together to draw up plans 
for the best ways Unesco could 
help scientific progress in their 
countries. 
The scientists reaffirmed the 
great usefulness of the Unesco 
Field Science Co-operation Office 
in that region of the world and 
agreed on the suitab:litv of trans- 
ferring the Office from Rio de

### 73853: Brussels Meeting extends Copyright Convention

  
Brussels Meeting 
Extends Copyright 
Convention 
By : 
Francois HEPP 
Head of the Copyright 
Division. 
 
  
 
Note © On the eve of his departure 
jor ‘Buenos Aires, where he is lo 
represent Unesco at the Inter 
national Congress of Authors’ 
Societies to be held between 5 
and 15 October, M, Frango:s 
Hepp has kindly recorded for 
COURIER readers some of the 
results of the important Diplomai- 
ic Conjerence for the revision of 
the Berne Convention which met 
in Brussels this summer, at which 
he was present as a Unesco 
observer. 
NESCO’S interest in the work 
of the Brussels Conference 
was dictated by the high import: 
ance which this Qrganization at- 
taches to unification of Copyright 
as 2 means of dlssipating many 
international misundersiandings 
arising from insufficient know- 
ledge among peoples. The Berne 
Convention is the first, and an 
enduring. mnumert or Feterog- 
tional Copyr'g .t, and a Conference 
for its rcvision couid no. fail to 
b=, in Unesco’s eyes, an event of 
the first importance. 
From the Brussels conference, 
at which there were 35 Member 
countries and observers from 18 
non-members, the Berne Convent- 
jon emergad considerably streng- 
*hened, and with a greater meas- 
ure of unity. 
The practical results cbtained 
may be summed up as follows : 
Inclusion of phetographie, cine- 
matic, and in ceriain condit ons, 
“applied works of art,” among the 
categories protected ; 
agreement™n the period after 
the dealt of an author during 
wh'ch the “moral rights” may be 
exercised ; 
important provisions regarding 
press publications (including 
news-reels) gramophone record- 
ings, cinema, and particularly 
broadcasting and televis'on ; 
acceptance of the “continuing 
participating right” (droit de 
suite) in respect of resales of 
works of art. 
Finaly thers are three mnicas- 
ures of major importance : 
1. acceptance of the principal 
that authors’ rights be directly 
protected by the instrument of 
the Convention wihout previous 
amendment of national legislat- 
‘on 
J. unanimous acceptance of fifty 
years as the period during which 
an author’s work continues to be 
protected after his death; 
3. agreement on the long sought 
principle that any difference 
betw=en Member countries regard- 
ing the interpretation of the 
Convention's provisions be re- 
ferred to the Internatonal Court 
af Just'ce. 
In addition it was decided that 
the text of the Convention be 
henceforth drafted in two lang- 
nages, French (formerly the 
sole language) and Engl’sh, 
though the French text shall 
be authoritative in cases of dis- 
nute. 
Furthermore all Member States 
may require the Berne ( ifice to 
publish an “author’zed” text in 
‘heir scveral languages.

World Cultural Reviews 
T is somewhat disappointing to think of the 
| disproportion between the constant improve- 
ment in the facilities for conquering space 
offered by modern life and the failure to sur- 
mount the barriers to thought presented by differ- 
ences of ranguage. 
“We can hear the wireless words spoken at the 
other end of the world; we gan pass in a few 
hours from Europe or America to China, and

almost insuperable for the reviews themselves, 
may not be so for an international organization. 
Reviews have been “paired off” according to 
their character and their readers. Literary reviews 
offer many diverse nuances in content and 
approach. Philosophic, technical ang medical 
periodicals appeal to a well-defined audience. The 
appeal of literary reviews, on the other hand, 
ranges from avant-garde readers to the man in 
the street, and covers a wide 
field from the short story and 
the essay to criticism or poetry. 
In suggesting the first articles, 
the Literary Pool took acount 
passed its borders. . 
What more insoluble mystery is there for a 
Freachman than a book printed in Chinese or 
Swedish, or one in Dutch for an Egyptian or an 
Indian? How many fundamental works consist 
of nothing more than incomprehensible signs 
for people living only a few miles from the place 
where they were written? 
Intellectual Exchange 
-Through Contemporary 
N Periodicals 
And if this is true of the masterpieces of the 
past. with names and characteristics of which 
we are at least familiar by hearsay, how much 
truer is it of contemporary thought, which 
nevertheless already contains the embryo of the 
future? 
This great problem has not been overlooked 
by Unesco, and while the Philosophy and Human- 
istic Studies 
Division has 
concentrated 
on finding 
the best 
means of 
tr,a n sl ting 
the master- 
pieces of the 
past, the Arts 
and Letters 
Division has 
und ertakan 
to bring liv- 
ing civiliza- 
tions into 
touch with 
one another, 
by concen- 
trating on 
the form in 
which  con- 
temporary 
thought most 
readily finds 
  
expression—the review. 
That is how the International Literary Pool was 
conce.ved. Iis principal purpose is to establish 
an active two-way flow between reviews in all 
countries and to serve as an international source 
of information and mutual understanding. In 
order. to achieve this aim. the Literary Pool 
endeavours to offer reviews in different countries 
articles which have alreadv been published in 
others reviews and which may help them to inform 
their readers about artistic or literary movements 
in countries of which little or nothing is known. 
It was first necessary to obtain an accurate list 
of the literary reviews, or those reviews which had 
a literary section, in each country. In many 
countries almost all the reviews which were 
published before the war have ceased, or changed 
their character. These lists also have to be 
constantly kept up-to-date, as one of the char- 
acteristic features of our time—and not the 
least regrettable—is the uncertain ae of re-. 
views. 
Scheme Enthusiastically . 
Welcomed by Reviews 
~~ In Many Countries 
When the lists had been obtained, Unesco 
wrcte to each review, asking it te take part in « 
the project. Over 300 were approached and 160 
have replied. The scheme was enthusiastically 
welcomed by 140. who, in their first reply, also 
indicated the countries with which contact in 
the literary sphere had prover mest difficult, 
and mentioned the general subjects and the 
countries which interested them most. * 
In order to understand the interest displayed 
by tne reviews, the circumstances of Iliterarv 
Life throughout the wortd and the difficulties of 
arranging exchanges must be borne in mind. 
People are sometimes inclined to think that 
intellectual contacts between 
countries are easy; that is not 
by any means the case. Ever- | 
growing barriers have been built | 
up by the war and by customs 
restrictions. Furthermore. the 
interest in the literature of 
lester - known countries—apps- 
rent for some 50 years—his 
gradually decreased. b 
These difficulties, which are 
  
of the space available in the 
reviews, since long articles were for all practical 
purposes, unusable in certain countries which 
had been particulary hard-hit by the war. 
The intellectual and practical independence 
of almost all literary or artistic reviews is well 
known. What is therefore required, first and 
foremost. is to offer them articles which do not 
represent a particular form of propaganda, but 
show what critics, 
artists and writers 
think of the special try 
problems of their own po C 
country, and of those 
concerning some part 
of the world or man- 
kind as a whole. 
The Pool endeavours 
chiefly to concentrate =A, 
on those countries A ak 
whose languages are @ “ET 
less familiar: 
For example, an ar- 
ticle by Rabindranatn 
Tagore on the place of music 11 education and 
culture, originally published by the Indian review 
“Visva Bharati”, was offered to the Ecuador 
review “Letras del Ecuador’ which recently 
published it. Another Indian review, “United 
Asia”, reproduced.a fine poem on Gandhi's death 
by the Brazilian writer, Cecilia Meireles. This 
poem was also published in the Lebanese review 
“Les Cahiers de Est” of Beirut. 
One of the principal Egyptian reviews In 
Arabic, “El Kitab”, is publishing in its October 
issue a long article on the literary unity of Eu- 
rope. which originally appeared in the French 
review “La Table Ronde”, and has alreadv been 
accepted in Italy by the review “Rassegna d'Ita- 
a”. A French review has published a. short 
story by the Dutch writer. Crollius wich had 
appeared in the Dutch magazine “Apollo”. The 
editors of Turkish and Norwegian reviews have 
been sent American and Indian poems. 
    
Since April, some 60 articles have heen accepted 
by reviews of differents types in various coun- 
tries. 
Pool Is Not 
A Literary Agency 
The aim of Unesco is not to act as a literary 
agency, but rather to encourage the cross- 
fertilization of ideas between the main cultural 
arzas of the world and thus to make it possible 
later, for reviews to carry out exchanges directly. 
In some instances, articles are submitted 
already translated and ready for printing, such 
as articles in Chinese and Arabic intended for 
the rest of the world, articles in Dutch or Polish 
for Latin America, etc., etc. Reviews which have 
published articles from magazines in another 
country have already shown a desire to establish 
direct contact with foreign reviews, in order to 
consider the possibility of regular exchanges. 
Others have asked for and received lists of 
foreigh reviews similar to their own. 
The problem of copyright, which so often 
prevents exchanges. is solved, whenever possible. 
in accordahce with international commercial 
agreement. Where that is not possible because 
of currency 
or other diff- 
iculties, re 
views anda 
writers have 
given ev- 
dence of sin- 
cere undar- 
standing; 
they nave 
authorized 
the transla- 
tion and re- 
production 
of articles 
without pay- 
ment, in order that their thought, their culture 
and henc=2 their country may establish spiritual 
links with ther countries. 
The International Literary Pool hopes in the 
coming months, with the assis- 
tance Of other departments 
and bureaux in Unesco, to 
extend its system for exchang- 
ing articles to other fields 
which have not so far been 
developed, such as films, philo- 
sophy and all forms of expres- 
sion of thought which are a 
feature of periodicals in every 
country.

Beirut 
Prepares 
Conference 
(Continued from Page 1) 
The Australian delegate, Col 
W. R. Hodgson, said that the ele- 
ments of conflagration existed 
when the Mexico decision was 
taken and things had not radically 
- changed since. 
“ We are a cultural body,” he 
said, “and should not aspire *o 
handling political questions. Hav- 
ing embarked on one course, we 
should steer by that course firm- 
ly and SonSisteniyy . and go to 
Beirut.” 
Pole Favors Geneva 
The holding of the Conference 
at Geneva was advocated by the 
Polish Delegate M. Henryk Bi- 
recki, who recalled that when the 
decision was taken at Mexico City 
to go to Beirut, the United Na- 
tions General Assembly was then 
discussing the fate of Palestine. 
He pointed out that delegates who 
voted for Beiru; at Mexico City 
were unaware of the U N. decision 
regarding Palestine and could nog 
foresee that there would be States 
which would not apply a decision 
taken by the United Nations. The 
necessity for the Conference to be 
held this year and the fear of a 
decision not to meet at Beirui 
being interpreted as a demonstr- 
ation against the peoples living 
in that region vould be reconcil- 
ed, he considered, by having the 
Conference in a traditionally 
neutral country. 
The Lebanese delegate, Dr. 
Charles Malik admitted that the 
issue was a political one. But “al- 
though it is a political question, 
Unesco must be above politics. 
“There is an Englisn saying 
that you cannot prevent birds 
from flying over your head, but 
you can certainly prevent them 
from building their nests in your 
hair. Thus only by being above 
Jew and Arab can Unesco, in the 
first place serve its own purpose. 
and in the second place help . 
‘to serve as much as possible Jew 
and Arab alike.” 
- 
Amendment Voted 
After the adoption of the reso- 
lution to hold the Third Ordinary 
Session of the General Confer- 
ence in Be'rut, the Extraordinary 
Session unanimously voted an 
amendment suggested by the Exe- 
cutive Board to modify the rules 
of procedure so that: 
“In the event of grave obstacles 
developing in the course of the 
year which. in the opinion of the 
Executive Board. render it impos- 
sible to hold the General Con- 
ference at the place fixed at the 
revious Session, the Executive 
Board may, after eonsultation 
with Member States and if a ma- 
jority of them concur. convene 
the meeting elsewhere.” 
It was pointed out by the Chair- 
man of the Executive Board that 
the Board regarded itself bound 
by the decision taken by the Ex- 
traordinary Session to call the 
Third Conference in Beirut and 
that the Board did not consider 
the above resolution as implying 
any reservations or any arriére- 
pensée such as might give rise to 
misunderstandings 
The Session then adjourned 
until the Third Ordinary Confer- 
ence in Beirut. in November.

### 73855: Tiny Lebanon offers great cultural wealth

_ Vol. 1.—Ne 9. UNESCO COURIER 
Tiny Lebanon Offers 
‘Great Cultural Wealth 
HE choice of the Lebanon 
as the seat of Unesco’s 
Third General Conference 
is a specially interesting one at 
a time when a veritable intel- 
lectual renaissance is evident 
in the seven Arab countries of 
the Middle and Near East. 
Since ancient t'mes the Leba- 
non has been a centre of inter- 
national exchange. Archaeologists 
and ancient historians teach us 
that the first international rela- 
tions on a large scale—the 
exchange of works of art, com- 
mercial and cultural exchanges 
were peacefully establ'shed by the 
seamen and merchants of Byblos, 
Tyre, Sidon, Beryte, etc. 
These men were bold naviga- 
tors who explored the wnoie of 
the ancient world and set up 600 
trading posts from the Gulf of 
Guinea to Scotland and from 
Gibraltar to the Indies. Their 
most certain title to a place in 
history is the'r invention of the 
alphabet of 20 consonants and 6 
vowels, which has remained 
unchanged since then and 
which we use today. The first 
- inscription in this alphabet is on 
the tomb of Ahram. King of 
Byblos 'n the Lebanon. 
Close Arab Ties 
It is -interesting tb note that 
even then 
most closely linked with the 
countries which are today Arab: 
Syria, Iraq, Egypt. Cyrenaica, 
Carthage and Morocco. 
Later the School of Law of 
Beryte, where Ulpian of Tyre, 
Papin‘an and Justinian were 
trained, and which was as impor- 
tant as Rome itself in the crea- 
tion of Roman law, was for long 
the intellectual beacon of the 
East. 
In modern times the first Arab 
printing press was set up at 
Choueir nn the Lebanon by 
Abdullah Zakher; there, too. 
were produced the first Arab dic- 
tionary, the first Arabic daily 
paper and play, and the first 
grammar of Arabic syntax. The 
literary revival which took place 
in the Lebanon n the 19th Cen- 
tury spread so swiftly to Egypt 
and Syria—indeed in all direc- 
tions—that it was directly res- 
ponsible for the major cultural 
renaissance to which we owe the 
polit'cal independance ‘of the 
majority of the Arab lands today. 
Humanistic Revival 
It is safe to forecast that the 
presence of those countries will 
be increasingly felt in interna- 
tional assemblies. From the cul- 
tural, scientific and educational 
point of view, it was important, 
therefore—indeed necessary—for 
Unesco to make direct contact 
with the Arab world. 
Today there are 250,000,000 
men, Arab in civilizat'on, lan- 
guage and customs, who seek lo 
revive the humanistic values 
which flowered among them 
some centuries back, when Eu- 
rope was still sunk in the dark- 
ness of the Middle Ages. At that 
time the Arabs were the frst to 
translate and annotate the philo- 
sophers of Greece: they had 
invented algebra and had given 
an impetus to geometry, astron- 
omy. medicine and architecture 
which served as the starting 
point of modern science. 
Nerve Centers 
In the old world the Arab 
countries lie along the nearest 
marches of the non-European 
continents. They are found at the 
most sensitive geographical nerve 
centres: Gibraltar, Suez, the 
Straits; on the turntable and 
meeting place of Europe, Africa 
and Asia. Nearly half their coasts 
are washed by the Mediterranean 
and they have a considerable 
coast-line on the Atlantic and the 
Indian Ocean. 
Unesco, which seeks to encour: 
age scient'fic, intellectual and 
artistic expression, and a rich 
cultural interchange among peo- 
ples, underlines by this meeting 
its interest jn the culture of the 
Arabs, just as Unesco's confe- 
rence in Mexico last year marked 
the Lebanese were 
the importance of Latin Ameri- 
can culture, 
Much will be asked of the Arao 
world because it has much to give 
in a field whose spiritual climate is 
that of ardour and of faith. ‘That 
is the most rewarding path in 
these Eastern countries where so 
many mystics and rel'gions have 
been born. The Lebanon will give 
itself to this task without reserve.

### 73856: Iran extends its educational programme

Iran Extend Its 
Educational Programme 
by Dr. A.H. MALEKI, 
Delegate of Iran at the Universities Conference, 
[The article printed below is the par- 
tial text of an address given by br. 
AH. Maleki at the Utrecht Universities 
Conference, called by Unesco and the 
Netherlands Government early in 
August. | 
RAN possesses a culture and 
a history going back for 
thousands of years. Evidence 
has been found, dating from 30 
centuries B.C., of a «ivilization 
which extended to the fields of 
science, art and architecture. 
Iranian culturz was profoundly 
influenced by th2 com!ng of Is- 
lam, but at the same time it 
spread to all the Islamic terri- 
tories. Iranian writers and schol- 
ars, such as Avicenna and others, 
provided Islamic civilization wit 
its scientific and cuitural busis. 
The Iranian language was rep- 
resented at different times in 
our history by celebrated philo- 
sophers and writers, whose fame 
became world-wide and whose 
works were lranslated into 
French, German and English. As 
instances, we might mention 
works of Khayyam, Haliz and 
Nezami, 
These men often dealt with 
pedagogic problems, and devoied 
important works to the education 
of young people. Eight hundred 
years ago Sandi, the famous phi- 
.losopher and author, completed 
4 work on pedagogic methods. He 
wrote: “Men are all members cf 
the same body; when one memb- 
er is wounded, the whole body 
suffers. He who gives no thought 
to the relief of human suffering 
is unworthy of the name of 
man.’ 
That idea was the soil irom 
which education has Sprung in 
our country. The universily, in 
the modern sense of the term, 
only came into being in our coun- 
try in. 1954. But it has existed 
before that. Umnwersities and 
large schools, the cultural insti- 
tutions of Iran, enjoyed immense 
prestige in the Middle Ages. They 
taught pedagogy, philosophy, lo- 
gic, astronomy, medicine, litera- 
ture, 
tural sciences. In the M:ddle Ages 
it was the science and’ education 
emanating from these institutions 
which led the peoples out of 
darkness nto light. } 
Iran sujjfered severely from the 
war. She laced her forces at the 
aisposal of the Allics, and there- 
earned the title of the 
“Bridge of Victory”. After the 
war Iran jell the need of opening 
fresh universities, chiefly tor the 
training oj teachers and doctors. 
Thus, when political order had 
been re-established in the coun- 
try in 1947, the Government of 
Iran caused a new University to 
be cpened at Tabriz. 
The University of Tabriz has 
  
RISSALAT EL UNESCO 
Arabic Edition of “Courier” 
Published this month 
The Unesco Courer will be 
published this month in ‘Arabic. 
A special edition of this news- 
paper, bearing the title “Rissalat 
El Unesco”, will be published at 
Berut in the second half of 
October in honour of the Third 
Session of the General Confe- 
rence. M. Wajdi Mallat, Lebanes= 
man of letters and now a mem- 
ber of the Bureau of Public Infor- 
mation of Unesco, has been 
charged with the preparation of 
this sp=cial number. 
The form of the Arabic “Cour- 
ier” will be similar to thai of 
the French, English and Spanish 
editions. Besides statements and 
studies on Unesco’s principles, 
programme and achievements, it 
will conta’n articles specially 
written for this particular edition 
and signed by some of the most 
eminent scholars of the Arab 
world and the East. 
The main purpose of these arti- 
cles is, on the one hand, to make 
the Arab peoples and countries 
acquainted wth Unesco, and, on 
the other hand, to show the im- 
portant part to be played by the 
Arab civilization in world culture 
and in Unesco’s work. 
Some of the articles will be 
published in the November issue 
of the French, English and Span- 
ish editions, and is hoped that 
they will h:lp to strengthen 
understanding and cultural co- 
operation between the Orient and 
the Western World.

only two faculties: letters and 
medicine. It is hoped before long 
to create. in addition, the other 
facuities which are normally in- 
cluded in a university. This insti- 
tution 1s temporarily housed in 
buildings which were not design- 
ed for that purpose, but provision 
has now been made for the con- 
struction of special buildings on a 
cite having an area of 200,000 
square metres. The adnunistra- 
tion of the new university is on 
the same lines as that of the 
University of Teheran. Le Shahan, 
the Shah of Iran, has authorized 
a grant of 10 million rials (350,064 
dollars) for. the construction of a 
hospital attached to the facuily 
of medicine, where students will 
be able to engage in practical 
work. 
The foundation of the Univer- 
sity of Tabriz has been applauded 
by the whole nation, which re- 
gards it as a new and important 
centre for the diffusion of science 
and culture. Azerbayan has ul- 
ways, from the most ancient 
times, been the religious and 
scientific centre of Iran. 
It was Zarathustra, one of tiie 
ancient prophets oj fran, who 
kindled in the very heart of Azer- 
barjan the sacred fire from which 
science and whilosophy were dif- 
fused throughout the whole coun-- 
try. This philosophy declared: 
“Darkness and light are in per- 
petual conflict with each other; 
but, in the end, Light will triumph; 
truth will erpel falsity; science 
will illuminate ignorance.” 
It is this philosophy which in- 
spires our methods of teaching, 
and we trust that, with the aid of 
great cultural organizations, and 
especially with the support of 
Unesco, our young university will 
attain its full development, ond 
will succeed in fully accomplishing 
its educational mission; it will 
thus become an efficient member 
of the world-wid: organization of 
Universities.

Of Middle East 
Scientific Works 
A “List of Scientific Works

The Middle East Field Sci-

the region were ignorant of 
what was being published else- 
where in the region, decided 
to collate this information 
and make it available to 
scientific workers and students 
in the Arabic world. 
It is hoped that the “List

Press, Radio 
N 1947 and 1948 Unesco carried 
out surveys in a number of 
countries to disccver their 
technical neads with regard to 
the press, radio and film. 
Following the spirit of the 
Organization's Constitution the 
first two sessions of the General 
Conference of Unesco held that, 
to ensure “full and equal oppor- 
tunities for edu- )

exchange of

film, and to give such require- 
ments a high priority. 
The Commission emphasized 
the value of developing co-opera- 
tion between Unesco and the vari. 
ous Specialized Agencies and Eco- 
nomic Commissions of the United 
Nations for the assistance of the 
diferent countries covered by the 
1947 and 1948 surveys. The Com- 
mission request- 
ed Unesco to ex- 
tend such surv- 
eys gradually to 
cover the whole 
world and to 
keep them up to 
date, so that in 
By 
  
ledge”, Unesco 
should lend its ass'stance to “all 
means of mass communication”. 
In 1947. surveys were carried 
out in 12 war-devastated coun- 
tries. and in 1948 in 6 war-devas- 
tated countries and 11 countries 
in which the technical means of 
mass commun’cation are perhaps 
not yet sufficiently developed (3%). 
By the term “tecrnical needs” 
Unesco implies: 
(a) Inadequate supplies of raw 
. materials (such as news- 
print, raw film stock); 
(b) Shortage of equipment 
itself; 
c¢) Inadz2quacy of professional 
training. 
Fifteen experts on mass com- 
munication; invited in their per- 
sonal capacity, constituted the 
Commission, which met ‘n August 
this year to consider the reports 
prepared by the Unesco Secreta- 
riat on the press, radio and film 
situation in the seventeen coun- 
tries covered by the survey. 
As in 1947, the experts found 
that “if the full capacity of in- 
dustry were utilized, production 
throughout the world could, with 
the possible exception of news- 
print, be sufficient to meet the 
essential requirements of the coun- 
tries considered” and that it was 
“the shortage of foreign currency 
which prevented the acquisition 
of adequate quantities of raw ma- 
terials and the equipment mne- 
cessary for the press, radio and 
films”. 
In its general. recommendations 
the Commission stressed the vital 
importance of cultural and in- 
formation needs in the defence of 
peace. It ga. 2 special emphasis to 
the problem of newsprint, and 
asked Unesco to draw the atten- 
tion of Governments to the im- 
portance of expanding the produc- 
tion of raw materials and the 
equipment necessary for the de- 
velopment of the press, radio and 
* In 1947, the following countries 
were surveyed: Belgium, China, Czccho- 
slovakia, Denmark, France, Greece, 
Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Phil- 
ippines, Poland and Yugoslavia. 
In 1948, the survey was extended fo 
the following 17 countries: Austria, Bur- 
ma, Cuba, Dominican Republic. Ecuador, 
Haiti, Honduras. Hungary. India, Italy, 
Malayan Union, Mexico. Pakistan, Peru,

ed. It also requested that the 
various plans for assiting coun- 
tries where the press, radio and 
film are still undeveloped be put 
into effect, 
In 1947. the three Sub-Commis- 
sions—Press and News Agencies, 
Radio and Film—had tried in 
some cases to calculate the needs 
of the surveyed countries, and to, 
give a precise indication of the 
measure of assistance that should 
he carried out. 
In view of the existing world 
economic situation, and aware of 
.the financial obstacles to the im- 
plementation of such projects, the 
members of the second Commis- 
sion on Technical Needs this year 
indicated to the Unesco Secre-   tariat measures easier to apply: - 
with limited financial resources. : 
The experts did not this time -try 
to state the essential needs of the 
countries in question in terms of . 
quantities and prices. but emphbas-

"a whole series of measures which 
the Unesco Secretariat might con- 
sider with a view to promoting 
effectively, even if not with ma- 
terial assistance, the development 
of the press, radio and film.

mendations of each of the three 
Sub-Commissions will be found 
elsewhere on this page. 
  
In conclusion, it may be of in-| 
terest to mention that the various 
reports on the Press and News 
Agencies, Radio and Film were 
prepared by sending specialists to 
each of the countries covered by 
the survey; those specialists were 
able to consult not only the offi- 
cial services but also experts in 
all branches of mass communica- 
tion, and thus for the first time 
assembled a complete body of 
material which was entirely ap-.

mental representatives of the

### 73858: More newsprint urged by Press Commission

 
NEWSPRINT URGED | 
Y PRESS GOMMISSION 
n 
HE Conclusions and Recom- 
mendations of the Commis- 
sion on matters dealing with 
news agencies and the press dif- 
fered in some respects from those 
formulated by their predecessors 
in 1947. This was because some of 
the countries surveyed this year 
were not sufficiently developed to 
provide adequate and stable press 
organizations, In some cases, the 
effects of the war were still evi- 
dent. Furthermore, the press 
being dependent upon the written 
word and a number of the nations 
under review having a high rate 
of illiteracy, the problems of as- 
sistance to the press were found, 
in some cases, to be more of an 
educational character than strictly 
one of reconstruction or expansion. 
News Agencies 
The position of news agencies 
was found to be more fluid than 
that of the press itself and 
generally dijfered between in- 
dividual nations. 1t was seen 
that the importance of these 
agencies in the transmission of 
foreign mews could only be con- 
sidered as an integral part of 
the Press organization in any 
one given country. It was recom-- 
mended that, in view of chang- 
ing circumstances, regular revi 
sion of the factual reports 
prepared by the Secretariat 
should be carried out. In addi- 
tion, the importance of training 
journalists who were likely to 
become editors in news agencies 
was outlined, since this work had 
a considerable bearing upon the 
character and scope of news and 
information of an international 
nature. 
Newsprint 
One of the most important 
subjects dealt with by the Com- 
mission was that. of the raw 
material jor the press, the supply 
of newsprint. It was recom- 
mended to Unesco that the only 
practical method of increasing 
the supply was by the restoration 
to full production of existing 
newsprint mills which are either 
idle, operating at reduced rates, 
or producing other grades of 
paper. 
Research and efforts to dev- 
elop newsprint production should 
be stimulated by Unesco in con- 
junction with other international 
organizations already active in 
this field. There were also recom- 
mendations to the effect that 
Unesco should use its influence 
to point out the importance -of 
newsprint and paper for Other 
reading materials. T'hese should 
20t be considered as an ordinary 
commodity, but one of great so- 
cial importance in providing in- 
tellectual food for thought. 
The provision of equipment to 
print in many vernacular langua- 
ges was found to be a technical 
need in Asiatic couiitries. It was 
suggested that small, cheap, flat 
bed presses would be of greater 
utility in many countries jor the 
small circulation press ‘han mod- 
ern high speed equipment. 
Training of Journalists 
The education and professional 
training of journalists was con- 
sidered by the Commission as an 
important factor towards a more 
» 
responsible press playing a greater 
part in removing barriers to in- 
ternational understunding. 
The Commission advised Unes- 
co to assist the schools of jour- 
nalism in preparing their pro- 
grammes based on the experience 
of older and well-established ins- 
titutions, It was suggested that, 
not only by this training, but also 
in arranging for interchanges of 
working journalists between na- 
tions, a more international out- 
look might be fostered among 
those writing, editing and select- 
ing information and news. 
The Commission underlined the 
recommendation that Unesco 
should establish an International 
Institute of the Press and Injor- 
mation which would help to car- 
ry out many of the ideas and 
recommendations resulting from 
the Technical Needs Survey. Fi- 
nally, it was felt essential that 
the three media of Press, Radio 
and Film should be considered 
together, since in areas with a 
high rate of illiteracy, it might 
be more effective and cheaper to 
use audio-visual means for the 
mass communication of ideas and 
information, than an immediate 
expansion of the press facilities.

It was found that in the 17 cow

jittle prcduction or use of suc 
films, which could have .suc 
value in areas where a h'gh ra! 
of illiteracy and little develo] 
ment of radio facilities exist. 
A general proposal was Ppt 
forward that Unesco should ¢ 
operate with governments fo st 
up regional film boards, whic 
would provide a wider an 
cheaper means for the produ 
tion, distribution and display c 
educational films within eac 
area. Proposals were made tha 
the reciprocal exchange of film 
should be undertaken, and 1 
order to make this poss’ble, de 
tailed information and catalogue 
of educational films would haw 
to be established. 
It was further recommende 
that Unesco should faster the dis

asking nations to accept a con 
vent'on facilitating exchanges bj

ination of import duties. 
It was suggested that in orde: 
~ to use educational films to theii 
* fullest extent, especially for pur 
poses of fundamental education 
the us: of mobile un’ts should be 
encouraged. Such units could 
reach large audiences in outlying 
districts, particularly in those 
where no cinema nor electricity 
exist at present.

News Agencies 
[Following is part of conclusions 
of Technical Needs Commission 
last August on question of news 
agencies | 
USTRIA, Hungary, Italy 
~-X each has a natioral 
agency dealing almosy exclus- 
ively, with collection of domes- 
ic news and through cor- 
respondents and agreements 
with other agencies provides 
a foreign news Service. 
In Central and South 
America, position is reversed. 
Only in Venezuela and Uru- 
guay do small independent 
agencies exist. In Peru an 
agency exists, but serves only 
one newspaper, and is also 
closely connected with a 
foreign news agency. The 
U.S.A. agencies are predomin- 
ant in all the countries. 
Only in Mexico is there some 
competition from European 
news services. The press of 
Honduras, Cuba, Dominican 
Republic and Ecuador is 
almost entirely dependent 
upon international agencies 
for foreign news. In Haiti 
there is no regular news ser- 
vice, 
In the Far Eastern coun- 
tries, previously dominated 
by a British agency, there is 
a tendency, with growing 
independence, to set up na- 
tional agencies. 
Burma has already set up 
an independent agency, and 
same may shortly be true in 
both India and Pakistan.

### 73859: Cheaper films wanted for educational aims

ims Wanted 
lional Aims 
who would produee and use edu- 
cational films. Without such 
training an increase in the num- 
ber of films to less advanced 
countries would be valueless. If 
was urged that there should be 
seminars for audio-visual educa- 
tors in different regions in 1949, 
so that the best use might be 
made of educational films, 
In addition, a recommendation 
was made that Unesco should 
approach governments and if 
possible provide ths means for 
scholarships and travel so that 
more technicians and students 
should be able to study produc- 
tion and developments in educa- 
tional film work. 
A first volume covering twelve 
countries surveyed in 1947 was 
published last year and proved 
highly successful both for its 
informational value and as a 
guide to reconstruction activities. 
A further recommendation’ pro 
poses that Unesco should ask 
each country with production fa- 
cilit’es to make a full length 
film in 1949 destined for audien- 
ces of childrzn, and telling one 
of their own children’s favourite 
stories or nursery tales. These 
films would be d'stributed all 
- gover the world, and combine an 
excellent theme for a basis of 
international understanding at 
an early age with a simple and 
‘inexpensive method.

### 73861: Mass schooling, technical training stressed by radio experts

MASS SCHOOLING, TEGHNIGAL TRAINING 
STRESSED BY RADIO EXPERTS 
IY 1948, wunl'ke last year. 
Unesco's enquiry into techni- 
cal needs in radio covered coun- 
tries not directly hit by the war. 
Because of this fact and be- 
cause these surveys will oe 
extended in the next years to 
other regions of the world not 
directly affected by the war, the 
Radio Sub-commission on Tech- 
nical Needs, which met in Pars 
last August to study the reports 
of Unesco's field workers, form- 
ulated conclusions and recom- 
mendations aimed at eliminating 
the most outstanding general 
problems of the radio industry. 
Thus the commission did not 
limit itself merely to a 1'st of the 
radio needs of the countries sur- 
veyed but concentrated on such 
problems as the use of radio in 
schools, and in mass education 
and the development of profes- 
sional radio personnel. 
This year’s radio surveys 
showed that the s°'tuation in the 
European war-hit countries (Aus- 
tria, Italy, Hungary) is subsian- 
tially the same as those consid- 
ered in 1947; the posit.on is par- 
ticularly serious in the war- 
devastated nat'ons of Asia (Bur- 
ma, Federation of Malaya). 
Except in Uruguay and Mexico, 
the radio picture in countries 
which did not suffer directly 
from the war—whether in Asia 
or in Central and South America 
—Iis not very satisfactory. Uru- 


### 73860: Survey shows radio deficiencies

SURVEY SHOWS 
  
  
    . Unesco’s 1948 field surveys in radio 
eovering 3 European, 9 Latin American 
and 5 Asiatic countries showed that 
the organization of broadcasting in 
these three regions and the equipment 
available are very different. Their 
needs may be summed up briefly as 
follows: 
RADIO ORGANIZATION 
EUROPE. — In Austria and 
Italy, broadcasting monopolies 
have been granted to private 
companies over which the State 
exercises direct supervision. In 
Hungary, radic is a State monop- 
oly. All three countries broad- 
cast advertising programmes. Re- 
venue derived frem this ccvers 
only a part of expenses. Bulk of 
radio budget in all 3 countrizs 
comes frem compulsory annual 
p licence fees receiving sets. 
LATIN AMERICA. — Advertis- 
ing permitted in all these coun: 
tries makes up majority of finan- 
cial resources of radio orgati2a- 
' tions. The considerable time takzn 
up by advertising inevitably re- 
duces that devoted to cultural 
programmes. 
In Haiti and Honduras 
are only private stations. 
there 
In Ecuador, State has part-time . 
. use of “La Voz de los Andes” 
(privately owned missionary sta- 
tion). In Cuba and Venezuela the 
official broadcasting orga:iization 
has only low-powered equipment. 
Peruvian State network is rather 
more important. In Mexico, the 
Government and University Of 
Mexico own 8 transmitters be- 
tween them, but power of the 
official network is considerably 
lower than that of a single one 
of major private stations. 
Only Uruguay has a powerful 
and well-equiped official broad- 
casting system. 
~~ SOUTH EAST ASIA. — All 
broadcasting stations belong to 
government. No advertising dac- 
cepted. Annual license jee for 
receiving sets. 
In Burma, Federation of Ma- 
laya, India and Pakistan the 
respective governments have 
available a radio network which 
already enables them to muke 
educational and cultural broad- 
casts, particularly necessary in 
countries where illiteracy rate is 
high. The position will be still 
further improved in the future, 
when their schemes of expansion 
have materialized. Gavernment 
broadcasts are also designed for 
the information of rural popu- 
lace, but latter own only a small 
number of receiving sets.

RECEIVING SETS 
See chart on right 
EUROPE. — Austria is one of 
best equipped countries in Europe 
as regards receiving sets and has 
one set per seven inhcbitants 
(this is the same as for France 
and Norway). Hungary is less 
well equipped: one set per 20 in- 
habitants. Local industry cannot 
meet country's needs, which is 
the more regrettable as autlor- 
ities are making a considerable 
effort in school broadcasting. 
Italy has one receiving set per 23 
inhabitants. 
LATIN AMERICA. — Propor- 
tion of receivers in each country 
is related to magnitude of their 
transmitting equipment. Thus 
Uruguay and Cuba have one re- 
ceiver per 7 inhabitants, Vene- 
zuela one per 28, Mexico one set 
per 32 inhabitants, Honduras one 
per 61, Peru one set per 65, Ecua- 
dor cone per 111, Dominican Re- 
public one per 164, und Haiti one 
per 1,000. 
Except for Uruguay, where 
there is a small local output of 
receivers, quite inadequate for 
the country’s needs, there is no 
radio industry capable of manu- 
facturing sets in any of the coun- 
tries surveyed. However, Mexico 
is considering establishment of 
such an industry. 
SOUTH EAST A§JA. — In 
Burma, there is one receiving 
set per 3,400 inhabitants; in In- 
dic one per 1490; Federation of 
Malaya one per 207; Pakistan 
one per 920. 
with the exception of India, 
where output is still low, none of 
these countries manufactures re- 
ceiving sets and it may be said 
that for the general population 
in all these countries radio 
RADIO 
 
remains a luxury. as the selling 
price of sets is jar beyond their 
reach. 
TRANSMITTERS 
AND EQUIPMENT 
EUROPE. — The most power- 
ful Austrian transmitter was des- 
troyed in 1945, but country hopes 
to have its pre-war network recon 
structed by next July. Austrian 
radio industry comparatively uii- 
developed and lacks foreign ex: 
change for necessary purchases 
abroad. 
Eighty percent of Hungarian 
equipment was destroyed, but ¢ 
great effort has been made and 
country. has already re-formed 
its pre-war network. By end of 
1949, Italy will have reconstructed 
its 1940 network and proposes 10 
improve it thereafter to cover 
whole of its territory satisfactorily. 
Italy has a considerable radio 
industry, but the high cost price 
makes export impossible. 
LATIN AMERICA.—Both pri- 
vate and official stations, 
generally speaking, are inade- 
quately equipped to meet needs of 
their countries, as thewr popula- 
tions are often widely dispersed. 
Transmitting licenses granted in 
response to local needs hove not 
been issued according to any 
coherent plan. 
Honduras and especially Haiti 
are the two countries where this 
lack is most readily perceptible. 
Uruguay is only one oj nine 
countries surveyed by Unesco this 
year where there are manufac- 
turing possibilities permitting 
further improvements in an 
already satisfactory network. 
. SOUTHEAST ASIA.—Require- 
ments in broadcasting equip- 
ment in this part of world are 
enormous, particularly :n case of 
Pakistan and Burma. Even India, 
which owns a network of an 
overall power of 350 kilowatts, 
which it is developing according 
to a very well thought out plan, 
has in fact only one kilowatt per 
million inhabitants, . whereas 
Mexico, for instance, has 50 
kilowatts per million inhabitants. 
An even more striling comparison 
perhaps is that India has oniy 
one kilowatt power approximately 
per 10.000 square kilomelres, 
whereas Mexico kas six kilowatts 
for the same area. 
None of the countries surveyed 
manufactures transmitters or 
spare parts. Principal difficulty 
in purchasihg needed equipment 
in the U.S.A. i§ lack of dollars.   
guay and Mexico, however, have 
satisfactory equipment and high- 
grade staff and might provide 
usefu. professional training cen- 
tres for the staff of broadcasting 
organizations in certain Latin 
American countries. 
Both in Asia and America, the 
experts had to consider one 
problem of exceptional seriousness 
—the problem of illiteracy—which 
in some cases concerns 85 % of 
the population. 
Education by Radio 
For this re ason, the radic com- 
mission considered the use of 
school broadcasting and mass 
  
FILM & RADIO 
education by radio of vital 
importance for sll countries and 
especially so for ‘hose with large 
ittiterate populations. 
It urged Unesco t0 request 
governments as well as national 
and :nternational organizations 
to step up radio education by 
devoting a fixed portion of their 
usual broadcasting time to school 
broadcasts. 
It specifically requested that a 
maximum number of schools be 
- equipped with rece’ving sets and 
that at least one receiving set 
be provided for community listen- 
ing in each village where illit- 
eracy is high. The use of mobile 
radio equipments, providing tem- 
porary service, was also urged 
along with mobile cinema pro- 
grammes, as an effective means 
of mass education. 
The radio experts also sug- 
gested that the Radio Division of 
Unesco shculd co-operate in an 
over-all joint study of the means 
of combating illiteracy by the 
use of radio. 
Professional Training 
Turning to the problem of pro- 
© fessional radio training in the 
countries surveyed this year, the 
sub-commission concluded that 
“the quest'on of professional 
training is even more acute than 
in 1947”, 
“In the great majority of the 
countries covered by the 1948 
. WOrk on news 
establishments specializing in the 
professional training of news and 
programme personnel. In addition 
many countries are suffering 
from a shortage of specialized 
staff, alike on the technical and 
on the programme and news 
sides’. 
Considering the composite pic- 
ture presented by the two Unesco 
surveys of 1947 and 1948, the 
radio commission emphatically 
confirmed last year’s recommen- 
dations for the training of tech- 
nical personnel and rad.o journ- 
alists by the use of finishing 
instructional courses and the 
training of programme personnel 
by instructors brought in from 
other countries as well as the or- 
ganization of practical courses 
and professional training centras. 
In addition, the commission 
this year urged the creation of 
special courses on broadcasting 
techniques and the inclusion of 
radio courses in the curr‘cula of 
existing schools. 
These courses would include 
broadcasts, 1n 
schools of journalism; producing 
and broadcasting of radio plays. 
in Conservatories; the art of 
broadcasting, in secondary schools 
and universities; and “broadcast- 
ing as a social factor”, in schools 
of political and social science”. 
Publications Urged 
In order to facilitate the organ- 
ization and development of edu- 
cational broadcasting, and publi- 
cize the need for professional 
training, the Radio comm’ssion 
suggested that Unesco undertake 
the publication of two books: 
1) A WORK ON SCHOOL 
BROADCASTING AND EDUCA- 
TIONAL BROADCASTING, IN- 
TENDED CHIEFLY FOR THE 
USE OF GOVERNMENTS AND 
BROADCASTING ORGANIZA- 
TIONS. 
2) A WORK ON THE PROBL-~" 
EMS OF PROFESSIONAL 
TRAINING FOR RADIO PER- 
SONNEL. 
The commission also recom- 
mended that Unesco sponsor the 
publication of technical, histori- 
cal and sociological by Unesco 
broadcasting. 
Radio Summer University 
The radio experts also called 
for the orfanization by Unesco 
each year, on a regional basis, 
of Unesco summer universities 
for the study of broadcast art and 
information. The summer univer- 
s'ty would be open primarily to 
news and programme staff of 
    
  
      
survey”, it said. “there are no broadcasting organizations.

### 73862: Forty agreements signed with non-governmental bodies

Forty Agreements Signed 
With Non-Governemental Bodies 
Fro the very beg.nning Of 
its existence, Unesco has been 
aware of the essential part which 
the voluntary international bodies 
working in the fields of educa- 
tion, science and culture can play 
in carrying out its aims. 
Formal agreements between 
Unesco and two international 
voluntary organizations, the World 
Federation of United Nations 
Association (WFUNA) and the 
International Council of Mu- 
seums (ICOM) have been recent- 
ly signed in Paris. 
On 7 and 8 October an Interim 
Committee representing some 70 
‘international non - governmental 
organizations having consultative 
status with the United Nations 
Economic and Social Council will 
meet at Unesco House to. study 
the ways by which these volun- 
tary international bodies can best 
contribute to the work of the 
United Nations and their Spe- 
cialized Agencies. 
‘The Executive Boards Com- 
mittee on Relationships with 
Non-Governmental Organizations 
meets on 11 October to review the 
"© present co-operative arrangements 
of Unesco witn voluntary organ- 
izations and to consider how their 
resources could be, in the future, 
most fully emnloyed for Unesco’s 
objectives. 
In more than one instance in 
the past Unesco has been in the 
fortunate position of being able 
to benefit from an existing inter- 
national network built up by long 
years of voluntary efforts. This is 
the case of the International 
Council of Scientific Unions (IC 
SU), the chief non-governmental 
body in the field of Natural 
Sciences, established in 1919. By a 
formal agreement with ICSU in 
December 1946, ICSU became one 
of Unesco’s chief instruments of 
scientific co-operation and ex- 
change on a world scale. . 
. Through an agreement with the| 
Internaticnal Studies Conference, 
in force since June 1947, the De- 
partment of S06cial Sciences bene- 
fits by the contacts in many coun- 
tries of this international organ- 
ization. 
However, the bulk of non-gov- 
ernmental organizations co-oper- 
ate with Unesco under “consulta- 
tive arrangements”. These arran- 
gements include certain basic 
privileges granted by Unesco to 
the international voluntary bodies 
satisfying certain criteria as to 
the aims, structure, international 
character and represéntativeness 
of the organizations concerned. 
Facilities offered by Unesco to 
organizations approved for con- 
sultative arrangements include in 
particular: invitation to the Gen- 
eral Conference and to other 
meetings convened by Unesco; re- 
ceiving of relevant documents 
and publications; a right to sub- 
mit written statements concern- 
ing matters of common interest. 
At present, 69 internationai 
non-governmental bodies have 
been approved for this type of 
arrangement. They include youth, 
women’s and relief organizations, 
professional bvodies of teachers, 
lawyers and artists, and special- 
ized scientific societies. 
A considerable number of the 
organizations enjoying “consulta- 
tive arrangements” contributed 
during the present year towards 
the execution of Unesco’s Pro- 
World Political Science 
Association Planned 
The first international con- 
ference of political scientists 
called by Unesco took place in 
Paris from September 13 to 16. 
The conference agreed on the 
establishment of an International 
Political Science Association, and 
a Preparatory Committee was set 
up to draft the constitution of the 
Asociation. Late in 1949 or early 
in 1950, it is hoped to hold a re- 
presentative meeting of national 
political science groups and other 
‘interested bodies in order to de- 
termine the structure, functions 
and activities of the International 
Political Science Association.

request of Unesco and against 
payment made on a contractual 
basis, surveys, investigations, bib- 
liographies or various stud es. -

an exclusive feature .of Unesco's 
policy towards non-governmental

organizations—was approved by 
the Mexico City General Confer- 
ence. As a result, 40 contracts of 
this nature have been concluded, 
for a total amount of more than 
$100,000, enabling Unesco to use 
the experience and competence of 
international non - governmental 
bodies for a common purpose, 
In several instances, Unesco has 
requested these organizations to 
hold international congresses with 
a programme mutually agreed 
upon, thus taking advantage of 
the facilities which well establish- 
ed international bodies have in 
certain fields. 
There is a third type of co-oper- 
ative arrangement provided in 
Unesco’s policy towards interna- 
tional non-governmental organ- 
izations. “Advisory Committees” 
aim at grouping non-government- 
al organizations having similar 
objectives or working in the same 
field, such as TICER, grouping 28 
independent international organ- 
izations working in the field of 
Educational Reconstruction. A se- 
cond Advisory Committee group- 
ing major international Univers- 
ity Organizations is on the point 
of being constituted. 
The chapter of Unesco’s co- 
operation with non-governmental 
organizations is at its very begin- 
ning. The framework provided by 
the Constitution and the direc- 
tives adopted by the Mexico City 
Conference, offer, however, a solid 
basis for associating with Unes- 
co's venture invaluable resources 
of competence, experience and 
goodwill accumulated in numer- 
ous non-governmental organiza- 
tions. Unesco” is well aware that 
these organizations, representing 
the actual “producers” and “con- 
sumers” of education, science and 
culture constitute an element 
which is essential for the success 
of the Organization.

(Continued Irom Page 1) 
An opin‘on which is to-day 
widely held throughout the scien- 
tific world, even outside Latin 
America, is that on the day Latin 
American scientists and techn- 
cians pool ther knowieuge, a 
fresh era of progress will begin 
for that quarter of the world. 
Some thirty scientists from 
eleven South American countries 
outlined. such a programme for 
co-ordination in the five days of 
the conference. 
“I shall give only one example 
of the mportance of the problem 
  
Dr Nestor- Bernaide Caceiapucti, 
a young Italian .nuclear physicist, 
was the Unesco representative and 
general secretary at the Conference 
in Uruguay, Me has recently been 
appointed Field Science Officer in 
Latin America and wili leave Paris 
2arly next mouth to establish the 
Office in Montevideo.     
we have to solve which is of 
practical and scientific interest.” 
said Dr. Eduardo Cruz Coke, Pro- 
fessor of Physiological Chemistry 
at the University of Saritiago. 
Chile, who was specially invited 
to attend the conference convened 
by Unesco and the Government 
of Uruguay. 
“In South America, on which 
the world is becoming increasingly 
dependent for its food supplies. 
we see vast stretches of arable 
land being irreparably impoverish- 
ed by erosion and lack of proper 
care. It is the result of inadequate 
knowledge of the nature of the 
land in America, we can acquire 
such knowledge only if we are able 
to co-ordinate our experiments and 
supplement research carried out 
in one of our countries by tne 
results obtained in others.” 
As early as 1946, Unesco pro- 
posed that, as a general solution 
to the problem of scientific co- 
ordination, a Field Science Co- 
operation Office should be esta- 
blished in Lat'n America. Such 
an Office was set up in Rio de 
Janeiro the following year. 
The South American experts 
brought together by Unesco on 
September 6 (under the honorary 
chairmanship of Professor Ber- 
nardo Houssay, eminent Argenti- 
nian scientist and 1943 Nobel Prize 
winner) approved Unesco’s project 
Latin American Science Coordination Totibell ob 
  
for extending the activities of the: 
Oficina Cientifica de Cooperacion 
en América Latina, and advised 
Unesco on the best ways the Of 
fice would aid scientists in Latin 
America. The recommendations 
on this subject transmitted to 
Unesco, constitute one of the most 
remarkable programme for scien 
tific co-ordination in South Amer- 
ica. so far proposed. 
One cof the tasks which the ex- 
perts would like Unesco to un- 
dertake, with the support of the 
governments concerned, is the or- 
ganization of two SYMPOSIA, 
one devoted to “the study of phy- 
siological conditions im high alti- 
tud=s” and the other (in co-ope- 
ration with FAO) to “Physics, 
Chemistry and Biology of Latin 
American Soil.” 
These two subjects for study 
and discussion, which Unesco is 
asked to suggest to meetings of 
scientists convened by the Office 
in Montevideo, are not only of 
undoubted sc'entific interest but 
also of considerable social im- 
portance. Many South Americans 
live in the mountains or on very 
high plateaux. A problem of 
adaptation thus arises—for the 
indigenous population ho less

peansg—with numerous socal re- 
percussions which demand tho- 
rough consideration. 
It was also decided that, in the 
initial period. the main task of 
the Montevideo Office should be 
in the field of bibliography-—to 
organize a bibliographic inform- 
ation service, disiribute micro- 
films, publish a South American 
scientific year-book, etc. 
The final recommendations of 
the Montevideo Conference cover 
no less than 15 pages of type- 
script. In them, Unesco and the 
Governments of South America 
are asked to develop to the maxi- 
“mum exchanges of students and 
teachers between the various 
countries of Latin America and 
between those countries and the 
other great cultural centres of 
the world. The _ experis also 
stressed the need for increasing 
the number of scientists and 
technicians in Latin America and 
recommended the establishment 
of “National Funds for scientific 
research in South America.”

written in 1917 of Looking at

Shotwell, a 
noted American 
historian. Al- 
though the radio 
newspaper and

are powerful 
sources of in-

Understandings and attitudes

The first step in the improve-. 
ment of textbooks and teaching 
materials as aids to peace is to 
discover what has already been 
done and what is being done to 
achieve this end. Consequently, 
the Secretariat has been assemb- 
ling and studying the materials 
on textbook improvement pro- 
duced in var‘ous parts of the 
world. 
Enquiry Sent To Member |

An enquiry has been sent to 
Member States to discover what is 
being done at the preseni{ time 
and what is planned for the fu- 
ture. In addition te informational 
material, lists are beng prepared 
of individuals and groups inter 
ested in the improvement of 
textbooks and teaching materials. 
These resources will enable Unesco 
to serve as a clearing house in 
th's fleld. 
Another aspect of Unesco’s pro- 
gramme is the preparation of 
principles and criteria and a 
model plan for the analysis and 
improvement of textbooks and 
teaching materials. The model 
plan, including the princ’ples and 
criteria, is now in draft form and 
will be submitted to Member 
States in the near future. It will 
be accompanied by a recommenda- 
tion that Member States study 
the treatment of agenc’es of 
international co-operation in their 
own textbooks. At a later time 
these reports will be studied at 
Unesco House and a summary 
rzport will be prepared. 
Handbook Planned 
On Improved Textbooks 
The Unesco Secretariat is also 
seeking to extend bilateral and 
reg'ogsal agreements and enter-

agreements and enterprises is 
being assembled and studied and

NewZealand 
Offers 
Fellowships 
The New Zealand 0vern-. 
ment has set aside a sum of 
£15,000 to finance a fellowship 
scheme to provide study op- 
portunities in New Zealand jor 
an initial group of five Far 
Eastern studznts. 
The first grants being made 
atrailable include twos in China 
and one each to the Philip- 
pines, Malay and Burma. 
In approving the scheme, 
the New Zealand Minister of 
Education declared that the 
needs of these Far Eastern 
countries “for the kinds of 
training and experience avai- 
lable in New Zeatand are more 
urgent than those of the war- 
devastated countries of FEu- 
rope”. It was pointed oul, 
however, that the programnie 
will be extended to otner 
Eastern couniries and event- 
ually to European nations. 
The governments of the 
countries to which the fellow 
ships are being Offered are 
being informed about the racil- 
ities which New Zealand can 
offer. Final selection of the 
candidates will be made by the 
Fellowships Committee set up 
by the New Zealand National 
Commission for Unesco. 
Fields of study suggested for 
the first five candidates in- 
clude: agriculture, rural life 
and education, Maori educa- 
tion, education in the Island 
Territories, social services, 
mining, engineering, teacher 
training and the technical as- 
pects of broadcasting. 
At the conclusion of the fel- 
lowship, each student will be 
expected to return to his home 
country to put his training 
and experience to use in re- 
construction work. The grants 
will be generaily of six months’ 
duration and will allow for 
£ 450 including travel ex-. 
penses within New Zealand.

[Ruth Benedict, world-renowned social anthropologist, was one of the participants at the Unesce- 
sponsored Seminar en Childhood Education, held in Podébrady. Czechoslovakia from July 21 to August 235 
Shortly after her return to the United States, Ruth Benedict suddenly died on September 1ith. tier

read and discussed in many 
HEN Unesco drew up its programme of 
WwW work it stressed the need for “an enquiry 
into the distinctive character of the various 
national cultures and ideals, with the a:m of 
stimulating the sympathy and respect of nations 
for each other's ideals and aspirations and the 
appreciation of national. problems. One focus of 
such an enquiry would be the study oI ways 
by which the young are trained to become res- 
ponsible participants in the national culture”. 
Unesco has in this statement of policy stated 
its belief that recognition of cultural differences 
among civilized nations can promote internation- 
al co-operation. Usually. in most nations. the 
attitude has been quite different. Usually people 
who hope for world co-operation ar€ the very 
‘ones who minimize fundamental 
differences among the nations ; 
they emphasize the similarity 
of human virtues and motives, 
no matter what the differences 
in cultural practice and behav- 
iour. 
Those who oppose interna- 
tional co-operation, on the othar 
hand, blame the chaos of the 
werld on the presence of 
these differences between 
one nation and another. 
They stress that other nations 
must accept the virtues and 
practices with which they are’ 
familiar in their own culture 
before it will be possible to 
make a peaceful world. This 1s 
an attitude which is centuries 
old. It has not made for world 
peace. ’ 
Now Unesco proposes that 
social scientists should take the 
lead in promoting a new and 
different attitude, studying na- 
tional differences even down 
into such fundamental things 
as the way we bring up our 
children. 
Unesco is saying, in effect. 
that it is part of wisdom to 
recognize that human commun- 
. ities are not all alike, and is 
suggesting that we cultivate psychologically heal- 
thy attitudes also among ‘he nations and that by 
greater study and understanding of national diff- 
erences we could promote a more co-operative 
world. 
Ne Nation Can Live To Itself Alone 
This programme of Unesco’s is especially neces- 
sary ir the world today. No nation any longer 
lives by itself alone. In the modern world it is 
absolutely necessary that each nation take sone 
attituce about other modes of life than its own. 
. Any study of national differences is a study: 
of comparative cultures. This is the special field 
of social anthropology, and it is necessary to 
stress a few of the principal conclusions which 
have been derived from such study. 
The way of life among people, the virtues. 
they exhibit and the aggressiveness they show is 
learned in their experience in that social order: 
it is not racial ; it is not instinctive. in the sense 
that human beings everywhere are born with a 
set of instincts which account for their aggres- 
sions and their cruelties. 
The cultural patterns which mena in all societies 
invent for themselves and transmit down the 
generations have in each community a cons:der- 
able degree of consistency within them- 
selves. These patterns of learned behaviour have 
to be taught anew to each generation. No matter 
how distinctively French France seems over 
several centuries, or how Dutch Holland seems, 
with each new generation the personnel of 
France and Holland changes completely. One 
generation dies and another is torn. In the way 
in which parents handle their babies, in the 
way in which older children treat youager 
children, in the way in which teachers reward 
and punish their pupils, emotions are selected 
and cultivated in them which fit them to be 
members of their own community and nation. 
Cultural study of national differences is just 
beginning to be accepted. The members of this 
 
The Jate Ruth Benedict 
  
seminar have therefore an eopnortunity te con- 
tribute to the research which is necessary, and 
it is well to say a few words about methods of 
training for such work. 
Comparative study of human culture was not 
possible before the development of certain cli- 
mates of opinion, and ne student of the subject 
can do excellent work whe finds this climate of 
opinion personally distasteful. } 
Students of comparative cultures have usually 
been trained by acquainting them with a wide 
range of the diversities of possible social nsti- 
tutions which are traditional in various parts 
of the world and then sending them to fairly 
small simple communities very different from 
their own. These are often pre- 
literate tribes. 
Because the social arrange- 
ments and motivations of 
these communities are entirely 
unfamiliar to the student, he 
has to observe and record every 
etail of their lives in order 
to understand them. The “cult- 
ural surprise” he experiences 
gives him an education in patt- 
erns of culture which it is hard 
to give in any other way. 
Genetic Study 
of National Character 
This Unesco seminar is de- 
voted to the study of childhood 
education, and Dr. Chen's study 
group has as its subject “Child- 
hood Education in Different 
Nations”. In line with Unesco’s 
programme, seminar members 
are interpreting their assign- 
ment, not merely as the child's 
school education, but as his 
home and community exper- 
iences as well, “the ways in 
which the young are trained to 
become responsible participants 
in their national culture”. 
It is hoped that some of the 
delegates to this seminar will 
be stimulated by the discussions here, to go back 
to their countries to record observations and mm- 
terviews, and thus contribute to mutual knowledge 
among nations of the world. . 
Genetic study of different cultures is precisely 
the study of how each generation is conditioned 
* to become responsible participants”. in the way 
of life which is traditional in the community 
into which it is born. The technical development 
of such study is possible today because of 
knowledge that has been‘ acauired in several 
sister sciences, all of which are involved in such 
genetic studies: (a) the study of the physical 
maturation of the child; (b) medical studies in 
the field of psychosomatics; (c) psychiatry. 
Training The Young 
As Responsible Participants 
- In National Cultures 
Aided by the development of these related 
sciences, the time is ripe for the study of the 
“ways in which the young are trained to become 
responsible participants in national cultures”. It 
is only necessary to collect the observations and 
record the attitudes upon which understanding 
can be based. 
Thus when all European naticns have made 
systematic records of observations of child life 
and have gathered data from pareats and from 
educators can adequate understanding be 
obtained of the ways in which children in difter- 
ent areas of Europe are fitted “to becOme res: 
ponsible participants” in national life. 
If we are to accept the different ideals and 
alternative social arrangements of the nations ot 
the world, those of us who are professionally 
concerned with childhood education have a task 
which extends far beyond problems of curricu- 
lum revision. We need the clear-sightedness and 
the tolerance which will help us to appreciate 
the different kinds of strengths which different 
nations could contribute to the world in which 
we desire to live.

to verbal clarification, 
Whenever 1 see an Exhibition 
which, like this one, tells a story 
so graphically, I call to mind the 
exhortation dinned into me, as a 
hoy, by my boxing-instructor. “4l- 
ways remember”, he used to say, 
“that one in the eye is worth 
three on the ear!” 
Many visitors from Member 
States, admiring the lay-out, and 
{even more) the beautiful colour- 
effects of this display, have de- 
elared that replicas of it, sent on 
tour among the nations, could do 
much to familiarize people with 
the work of Unesco. That, no 
doubt, is true, but I hope myself 
that this attractive visualization 
will not become a mere stereotype 
of its kind. To. 
What we want is not a stan- 
dard Unesco Exhibition but an 
assortment of such displays, each 
one expressing afresh the basic 
aims and methods of the organiza- 
tion. Unesco 1s always, and right- 
ly. endeavouring to scotch the de- 
lusion that it is a universal pro- 
vider, and constantly reminding 
the world that its purpose is to 
stimulate appropriate activities 
and attitudes in the Member 
States. 
The Exhibition which is now 
permanently installed in Unesco

jor wictory it it incites Member 
States to design and produce their

given a place of honour gn that 
World's Fair of Culture which is 
being mooted in Unesco nowadays. 
Exhibitions of this highly-skilled 
professional kind have an evident 
publicity value, but I should like 
to see them supplemented, in 
every school, community centre 
and similar strategic spot, by a 
totally different kind of display 
—by unpretentious, amateur, 
home—made jobs, planned, and 
put together as a group activity. 
There is no more effective me- 
thod of “bringing home” Unesco 
to a group of people than to set 
them, under well-informed guid- 
ance, the exercise of building a 
Unesco exhibition for themselves. 
partly by making their own maps, 
charts and diagrams and partly 
by ransacking albums, family 
archives, books and periodicals for 
illustrative material. The results 
of these adventures in initiative 
can be very good to look at but. 
apart from their success as a 
finished product, they represent 
a process of the highest educa- 
tive value. 
As a G.H.Q. job the Exhibition 
at Unesco House is appropriate 
to its setting and a most atirac- 
tive show-piece. But the most 
dynamic kind of visual aid is the 
kind which communities invent 
for themselves,

### 73866: An Educational weapon: the museum

  
AN EDUCATIONAL WEAPON 
The Museum 
THE stimulating and sugges- 
tive article by Mr. HE Wil- 
liams, concerning the Unesco ex- 
hibit new in the main hall of 
Unesco House, Paris, emphasizes 
not only the value of such exhi- 
bits to the public generally, but 
also the educational value to 
those who may participate in 
their preparation. : 
There remains hcwever one 
further question which Mr. Wil- 
liams does not discuss in his 
article, and that is the means by 
which such exhibits can most 
effectively and most efficiently 
be presented to a wide public. 
The value of such educational 
exhibits depends net only upon 
their attractiveness and the edu- 
cational message which they 
present visually, but equally 
upon their presentation in such 
a place and in such a manner 
to make their appeal to the 
widest public possible. 
Museums, organized as they 
are as popular educational ins- 
titutions, desi gned to reach 
through their exhibits and edu- 
cational programme masses of

amongst the most effective me- 
dia for eommunicating educa- 
tional information. 
I doubt whether it is generally 
appreciated that there are very 
few population centres through- 
out the world, where museums 
are playing an active part in 
educational life, in which the 
combined annual attendance at 
the museums does noi exceed 
the population of the city in 
which they are located. 
By —— 
CHAUNCEY J. HAMLIN 
President, International Coun- 
cil of Museums.    
Further, most museums, accus- 
tomed as they are to presenting 
exhibitions have, through their 
experience, competence to at- 
tract large numbers of visitors. 
The - International Council of 
Museums was organized to pro- 
vide a suitable organization to 
further international co-opera- 
tion among museums, and to be 
the co-ordinating and represen- 
tative international body fur- 
thering museums interests. 
The museums of the world, as 
custodians of much of the cul- 
tural heritage of mankind, and 
as dynamic educational institu- 
tions, stand ready through this 
Council to place their resources 
and professional talent at the 
disposal of Unesco in helping to 
further Unesco’s fundamental - 
objectives of promoting interna- 
tional understanding and co- 
operation. 
In this connection this Council 
has already taken action through 
the adoption of Resolutions, 
. {Mr, Chauncey J. Hamlin, of Buf- 
falo, New York, U.S.A. is President 
of The International Council of 
Museums. Mr. Hamlin has recently 
retired from the presidenoy of the 
Buffalo Museum of Science, after 
serving in this capacity for 28 years. 
He was a former President of the 
American Association of Museums, 
and is a Trustee of the American 
Museum of Natural History, New 
York.)     
offering its co-operation in the 
preparation and circulation of 
such exhibits. 
To this end we shall indeed be 
happy to collaborate in any way 
that Unesco may desire, and we: 
take this opportunity of congra- 
tulating Unesco upon the very 
fine exhibit now appearing in 
Unesco House. We hope that 
ways and means can be found 
whereby the same, or replicas, or 
similar exhibits, can be circulat- 
ed to museums throughout the 
world, utilizing, as far as pos- 
sible, the facilities of these 
museums through the madium 
of this organization.
