IN THIS ISSUE 
© The power of words 
March 8 is International Women’s 
Day, a stark reminder of the long road 
to be travelled before the two sexes 
share the same rights. In Kuwait, 
women are fighting for the right 
to vote (pp. 4-9).In Afghanistan,they 
are being humiliated by the Taliban. 
With words as her only weapon, 
the exiled writer Spdjmai Zariab has 
taken up their cause and denounced 
the nightmare imposed upon 
her people (pp. 47-51).1t is also 
with words that young women—and 
men—belonging to the Otpor 
movement (“Resistance” in Serb) 
rocked the establishment to bring 
down the Milosevic dictatorship. 
...and of technology 
New technologies can serve the cause 
of freedom,but they are also chipping 
into our privacy and eroding our 
rights. Under the pretext of economic 
efficiency or security, our daily lives 
are too often placed under 
surveillance (pp.16-37). While these 
new technologies have enabled 
journalists to chronicle wars in real 
time, they have not always been 
to truth’s advantage (pp. 44-46). 
Technologies are also a formidable 
arm for book pirates, who are making 
a dent in authors’ royalties while 
putting cheap quality works on 
the market (pp. 41-43). They are 
omnipresent in Canadian schools, 
although their impact on learning 
is yet to be gauged (pp.13-15).And 
their unbridled use is contributing 
to global warming, killing off coral 
reefs, one of the world’s greatest 
underwater riches (pp. 10-12).

Hava AL-MuGHNI Is A KUWAITI SOCIOLOGIST AND AUTHOR OF 
Women IN Kuwait: THE Politics oF GENDER (LONDON: SAQl Books, 2001). 
 
  
Since the end of the Gulf War, Kuwaiti women have 
stepped up their campaign for the right to vote. Even the 
most ardent Islamist activists espouse the cause, touting a 
different vision of women’s role in Muslim society 
po 
few Kuwaiti women received more than a basic religious education. Those from 
althy households were confined to their courtyards, in a section of the house without win- 
ws so their voices could not be heard from the outside. Women from more modest hou- 
olds fared slightly better:some worked as midwives, marriage brokers, dressmakers and 
Bi ranic teachers who used their homes as schools, while others were peddlers or market tra- 
ders. In public, however, all women had to cover themselves in long black cloaks (the 
abbayat) and veil their faces with thick black cloths, the boshiat. 
Change was prompted by Kuwait's transformation from a small seafaring community 
relying on maritime trade to a major oil producer after 1945. Such rapid economic expansion 
created a demand for an educated workforce and the state made education available to all 
Kuwaiti citizens. The educated woman became a symbol of modernity, an icon of the modern 
state. The new generation removed the traditional black veil, enrolled in higher education and 
competed with men in the labour market. By the 1990s, Kuwaiti women made up 35 percent 
of the workforce, with a vast majority employed as teachers, doctors, engineers and lawyers 
Despite these strides Kuwaiti women continue to be legally defined as family members, 
whose rights and responsibilities are circumscribed by their roles as mothers, wives and 
daughters. Although the constitution does not discriminate between women and men with 
respect to their citizenship rights, a number of laws passed since its adoption are discriminatory. 
The 1962 Election Law, for example, restricts the right to vote and run for office to Kuwaiti 
men. 
After the Gulf War, the Kuwaiti women’s movement brought the voting issue to the fore- 
front, providing the ground for an alliance between Islamist and liberal women activists. Suf- 
fragists invoked the heroic roles of women under Iraqi occupation,the sacrifices of female 
martyrs and wartime hardships as justifications for gaining political rights. Women inside 
Kuwait had participated in armed resistance and risked their lives smuggling food, money and 
medicine through military checkpoints Many were caught,tortured,and killed.   ®

But whatever the sacrifices made and stereotypes chal- 
lenged, the all-male parliament remained reluctant to extend to 
women full citizenship rights, theoretically guaranteed by the 
constitution. In November 1999, an Islamist-tribalist coalition suc- 
ceeded in defeating a decree issued by Kuwait's ruler, Sheikh 
Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, which would have granted women the 
right to run for office and vote in parliamentary and municipal 
elections. 
Opponents appeal to narrow interpretations of religious 3

not only beginning to dominate some sectors in the labour 
market, they are also moving into positions of power in govern-

under-secretary in the ministry of higher education, and the 
managing director of the oil industry are all women. Female suf-

They blamed rising divorce rates, child delinquency and decli

parliament to pass a law allowing working mothers early reti-

of the role of mothers as educators has increased their authority 
in the home. At the same time, by elevating the importance of 
female modesty, Islamist women have acquired a dignified and 
respected position in the public arena. 
Empowered Islamist women activists share with their male 
counterparts the same dream of achieving an Islamic society 
ruled by religious idioms and norms. However, their ideal 
society appears to differ from the masculinist, hierarchical, 
ethical order in which women are disenfranchised and confined 
to roles dictated by their biological constitution. Islamist women 
activists are today embracing a more autonomous vision of an 
Islamic society and gender roles. Working from within the reli- 
gious movements has given them the chance to engage in a dia- 
logue over women’s rights issues and create a new model of 
Muslim womanhood. 
Women’s gender activism in Kuwait is as diverse as it is 
complex, and highlights the ambiguity of their social status in a 
rapidly modernizing country. Most importantly, it reflects the 
variety of women’s choices and aspirations in their struggle for 
gender equity. [|

he vibrantly coloured rainforests of the 
sea received a disturbing bill of health 
during a recent gathering of marine bio- 
logists in Bali: in the past few decades, 
than one quarter of the world’s 
coral reefs have been destroyed by 
human activity. At the present rate, at 
least 57 percent will 
be lost within our 
lifetime. 
This destruction 
threatens not only 
coral reefs, but also 
the lives of some 
500 million or so 
people in southeast 
and southern Asia, 
eastern Africa and 
the Caribbean. For 
many of these 
coastal communi- 
ties, corals are the 
largest source of 
protein: a healthy 
reef can provide 
more than 15 
tonnes of fish and 
seafood per square 
kilometre each 
year, enough food 
for 2,500 people. And often they are the 
only source of income, employment and 
foreign exchange. 
Coastal communities depend on their 
reefs to attract tourists, develop the capa- 
city for commercial fishing, and protect 
shorelines from erosion and storm 
damage. In the British Virgin Islands, for 
example, 45 percent of revenue comes 
from tourism, which provides more than 
half of the territory’s employment. A loss 
of reefs would probably cause the water 
to cloud with algae and the beaches to 
erode under the pressure of waves, leading 
to an estimated $130 million loss in 
income.

### 122146: Corals under siege

Corals under siege 
Threatened by pollution, overfishing and global warming, coral reefs— a lifeline 
for millions of people—are dying off at an alarming rate 
Created by more than 50 million 
yearsof evolution,coral reefs are one of 
the most complex and fragile webs of 
biodiversity on earth. Naturalists have 
catalogued more than 800 species of 
reef-building coral and 4,000 species 
of reef-dwelling fish. In total, coral 
reefs may shelter as many as one quarter 
of all marine species, and are especially 
important as nurseries for young fish. 
So why are these lifelines disappea- 
ring faster than ever? On a local level, 
overfishing has decimated many indivi- 
 
dual reefs, notably in Malaysia, Vietnam, 
Indonesia and the Philippines. The 
removal of too many plant-eating fish 
allows algae to overgrow and kill the 
coral, beginning a chain reaction of local 
extinctions that quickly grows beyond 
the reef’s natural ability to recover. 
Several fishing techniques are particu- 
larly lethal. 
Blast fishing, when fishers explode 
homemade devices over reefs to kill fish, 
has severely damaged corals in eastern 
Africa. Fishing with sodium cyanide is 
no better: exposure to this chemical 
makes tropical fish slow and clumsy, and 
therefore much easier to catch,while at 
the same time killing off corals and many 
other reef animals. 
Cyanide-fished reefs are often 
stripped of their marine life and over- 
grown by algae. Despite efforts to halt 
cyanide fishing, its frequency has 
increased in the past few years, driven by 
the high prices paid for live fish at tropical 
fish restaurants in Asia and aquariums 
in North America. Since this form of 
fishing began in the 1960s, the amount of 
cyanide dumped on coral reefs in the Phi- 
lippines alone has exceeded one million 
kilograms. 
But fishing is 
just one chapter of 
the story. Reefs 
are also being 
killed by indus- 
trial pollution, 
sediments running 
down rivers from 
deforested land 
and run-off from 
agricultural 
fertilizers. 
Activities such as 
coral mining, 
dredging, ship- 
grounding and 
construction 
break apart large 
coral strips and 
shatter delicate 
branches. Since 
reef-building 
corals only grow at a rate of 1.3 to 10.2 
centimetres per year, each blast-fishing 
explosion and dragged object can destroy 
a century of reef development. 
To make matters worse, global war- 
ming is adding to the plight of the reefs. 
Not only are corals fragile, but they are 
highly sensitive to temperature change. So 
when the 1998 El Nifio winds warmed 
tropical waters from Africa through Indo- 
nesia and the Philippines and out into 
the Pacific, reefs in the region turned pale 
and quickly faded to an eerie shade of 
bone white, a phenomenon known as 
bleaching. Many bleached corals are 
finally killed by algae. The Global Coral

Reef Monitoring Network estimates that 
bleaching in 1998 destroyed 16 percent of 
the earth’s reefs. In the Indian Ocean, 
the Maldives, Sri Lanka and western 
India, bleaching had a devastating effect 
on reefs already damaged by sedimenta- 
tion and pollution from onshore industry 
and land-clearing. Those that continue 
to be exposed to harmful human impacts 
are unlikely to ever recover. Above and 
beyond all other destructive pressures, 
there’s a good chance that coral reefs as 
we know them will be gone in 30 to 50 
years if global warming continues as 
expected. 
While communities cannot do much 
about global warming, they can find ways 
to ally protection with economic growth. 
For example, tourism development and 
coral protection go hand-in-hand at the 
Bonaire Marine Park in the Dutch 
Antilles. The park, established in 1979, 
employs rangers to enforce bans on the 
collection of coral, spearfishing and com- 
mercial fishing in park areas. To make 
the park self-sustaining, managers began 
charging a user fee to all visitors in 1992. 
Bonaire was one of the first marine parks 
to fund itself, instead of relying on money 
from foundations or local taxes 
Now, the degradation of unprotected 
reefs elsewhere in the Caribbean has left 
Bonaire with some of the healthiest coral 
in the area. Almost 30,000 visitors flock to 
the park each year, which has fed Bonai- 
re’s tourism industry. The continuing 
efforts of park rangers to protect their 
reefs indicate that the island is set to 
maintain healthy coral and increase its 
revenue from tourism. 
Bonaire is just one example of about 
400 marine parks designed to protect 
reefs. Unfortunately, many of these are 
“paper” parks, lacking the funding or 
community support to enforce protec- 
tion laws. Many are geographically iso- 
lated and, more often than not, near coast- 
lines that are not managed properly, 
allowing erosion and chemicals from 
areas outside the park to flow in and 
damage coral. 
With financial resources in develo- 
ping countries stretched thin, the most 
effective path to protection lies in part- 
nerships between local governments, 
international aid groups, NGOs and 
national foundations. The goal: to design 
effectively managed marine parks where 
communities maintain control over their 
resources with help from more expe- 
rienced and better funded national or 
international organizations. Wealthy 
nations have an added stake in these bio- 
diversity havens: they could well harbour 
precious chemicals for developing medi- 
cine. The most notable is azidothymidine 
(AZT), a drug widely used in industria- 
lized countries to treat people with AIDS. 
AZT was created from a chemical pro- 
duced by a Caribbean sea sponge that 
slows the growth of viruses. It is unknown 
how many more chemicals derived from 
coral reef animals may become the basis 
for similar life-saving drugs, but that is 
just one more good reason for speeding 
up the protection of our imperilled reefs.

But landing just east of the park, there 
can be no doubt that we are in 21st-cen-

bajo airport, protesters are exercising 
their newly-won political freedoms to 
demand that the regent in charge of this 
part of the province hear their call for 
greater local autonomy before he steps on 
the twice-weekly flight out of town. Inside, 
a glossy display from the U.S.-based 
Nature Conservancy (TNC) alerts new 
arrivals to the tremendous diversity of 
Komodo’s reefs and the many threats to 
them, from anchors to bombs to cyanide. 
With their bewildering array of 
colours, shapes, textures and behaviours, 
Indonesia’s psychedelic reefs leave first- 
time visitors, even experienced scuba 
divers, slack-jawed. Komodo National 
Park alone is home to 250 species of reef- 
building corals and 1,000 fish species— 
more than the entire Caribbean. Coral 
reefs are tremendously important for the 
people of Indonesia, providing half of

nation, the stakes are high in the struggle »

villagers of Blongko set aside six hectares 
of degraded coral reefs and mangroves 
as the first community-run marine sanc- 
tuary in Indonesia. Less than a year later, 
local fisheries have already made a noti- 
ceable recovery. 
“We started the sanctuary to bring 
the fishing back to how it was in the past,” 
explains Blongko’s village head, Dolvi 
Janis. “Now, for the first time in years, we 
can even cast a line from the beach near 
the sanctuary and catch a pelagic [open- 
ocean] fish.” 
Two other Sulawesi villages have since 
established their own marine sanctua- 
ries, and all 13 coastal villages in Blong- 
ko’s district want to establish their own 
reserves. No-fishing reserves, even small 
ones, let fish recover so dramatically that 
they spill over to adjacent areas, actually 
allowing more fishing to occur than 
before the reserve was established. 
The community-run reserves to date 
are quite small compared with national 
parks like Komodo, but they can be repli- 
cated widely at low cost.If the reformasi 
and international conservation forces on 
display in Labuanbajo airport combine to 
support them,even these small reserves 
have big potential to help Indonesia’s 
reefs, fisheries, and coastal villages flourish 
into the future. [|

(ToronTo, CANADA) 
  
    
t Toronto’ Holy Family Catholic Ele- 
mentary school, grade eight teacher Irene 
Korbabicz-Putko yearns to help her stu- 
ents make the most of computers. Her 
school bo ers instruction to the tea- 
chers, but in a suburb a good 45 minute- 
drive away in rush hour. Not surprisingly, 
Ms. Korbabicz-Putko sometimes has other 
commitments. 
Halfway across the country, at Calga- 
ry’s Glendale Elementary School, the local 
school board has received funding not only 
for on-site teacher training but for an inno- 
vative programme that sends experts in 
computer education into classrooms to 
serve as mentors to the teachers. 
Schools like Glendale are finding that 
new technology holds extraordinary pro- 
mise. But Canada’s experience with com- 
puters is very much a tale of two schools. 
Holy Family, for instance, has just one com- 
puter connected to the Internet for 600 
students from kindergarten to grade eight. 
Glendale has several per classroom. 
Nationwide, the computer revolution is 
still in its early stages. 
“Clearly we're in pioneering days,” 
says Richard Smith, the director of Simon 
Fraser University’s Centre for Policy 
Research on Science and Technology, who 
is studying the introduction of computers 
into the country’s classrooms. “There will 
be missteps and mistakes made, but some- 
thing is changing in education and clearly 
computers are part of it.” 
Back in 1994, Canada set a goal of 
having a computer connected to the 
Internet in every school and library. 
Federal politicians felt that for Canada to 
thrive, it must move beyond its traditional 
resource-based economy and prepare its 
young people for the knowledge-based 
  
world. By 1999, the country 
could boast that it was the first 
to hook up every willing school 
and library to the Internet. 
Only Sweden has a higher per- 
centage of its students logging 
on at school. 
But education in Canada 
remains the responsibility of 
the provinces. Each one has its 
own education budget to allo- 
cate. And each has its own 
views on how and when to 
integrate computers into the 
curriculum. In Alberta, for ins- 
tance, computers are inte- 
grated in grade one, while in 
Ontario they are not generally 
given that kind of prominence 
until as late as grade seven. 
Alberta,after years of squee- 
zing the schools for money, is 
now making extra funds avai- 
lable for innovation, and Cal- 
gary’s school board has been 
quite bold in tapping into those 
funds. The Galileo Educational 
Network is one of its innova- 
tive projects designed to bring 
schools into the age of the 
knowledge-based economy. 
Explore and 
discover 
The three-year project, 
funded by $600,000 from the 
province and matching funds from 
industry, isin place in ten schools, including 
Glendale Elementary. The idea is that tea- 
chers learn to use computers not only as a 
means of instruction, but as a tool for chan- 
ging the very nature of the classroom. 
“Schools are set up on the industrial model. 
Children are educated to be workers for 
industry,” says Pat Clifford, the president of 
Galileo. “They learn very early on the vir- 
tues of compliance. They are moved on 
every year. The learning is very structured

Now, she says, students must take more 
responsibility for their own learning, with 
the teacher acting as a guide and facili-

teachers can do this alone. The Galileo 
programme works closely with school prin- 
cipals and the local school boards, and 
allows teachers to take time off to chart out 
new approaches. When given this support, 
teachers can afford to confidently test out 
different ways. Susan Marinucci,a Grade »

Five teacher at Glendale Ele- 
mentary, has woven computers 
into projects involving team work 
and real-life situations. When I 
recently visited the school, her 
28 students were enthusiastically 
involved in a math and chemistry 
project. With their teacher’s help, 
they had made soap and were 
discussing the best price to sell it 
at. The whole exercise had 
involved searching for recipes 
and pricing information on the 
Internet. In another class, 
younger students had to imagine 
they were on a desert island and 
design survival tools with very 
few resources at hand. Again, 
with the teacher’s help, they drew 
some inspiration from pictures 
of tools found on the Internet. 
These fledgling efforts reflect 
Smith’s vision of computers as 
“providing an opportunity to 
engage students in a new style of 
learning—the explore and discover style.” 
This includes opening up connections to 
new people and information sources. For 
Marinucci, the prime benefit is obvious: 
“we’re connected to the world,” she asserts. 
An end to 
the sage? 
Connection, so far, is probably the key 
word to describe a flurry of initiatives 
across the country, inside and outside the 
classroom. The Writers in Electronic Resi- 
dence programme, for instance, connects 
budding student-writers at several schools 
to far-off professional authors who act as 
readers and mentors. In the eastern pro- 
vince of New Brunswick, a programme 
keeps teenage mothers in electronic 
contact with their schools after they give 
birth. In numerous schools, students are 
developing CD-ROMs documenting envi- 
ronmental and heritage issues, creating 
web pages and producing online maga- 
zines. Through its SchoolNet programme, 
the government works with the private 
sector and education groups to finance 
and promote these innovations 
Teachers experienced with computer 
learning understand that their roles must 
change, but that they are still vital to the 
learner. Larry Danielson, of Garden Valley

But his first principle stresses human 
contact:“We really focus on personal rela- 
tionships, whether on-line or face to face.” 
“What we're seeing,” says Elise Bois- 
joly, the executive director of Canada’s 
SchoolNet, “is gradually the teachers are 
becoming less of the ‘sage on the stage’ 
than a ‘guide on the side.” It’s a cultural 
shift,and one that will take a bit of time.” 
Her hope is that such methods begin as 
early as grade one. “If you start early it 
will be in the culture of the learner. That’s 
part of the larger goal of building a lifelong- 
learning culture.” 
But she acknowledges that there is a 
long way to go. Lack of teacher training is 
amajor barrier, she says. In Ontario, for ins-

impede learning,” Boisjoly says. “The gui- 
dance of the teacher is critical.” 
But as the experience of Irene Korba-

begun to address the issue of how to train 
its 300,000 public school teachers. “There 
are exceptional cases of well-trained tea-

times per hour. He also found they were unable to take in what they were 
seeing. After observing 1,000 or so students, he concluded that most of them 
simply weren't absorbing anything of any value. Teachers must also become 
conversant with new varieties of plagiarism made possible by computers. Before 
the Internet can be of use to anyone, and to prevent it from being an expensive 
distraction in the classroom, a human scaffolding must be put into place. There

INTERVIEW BY 
CYNTHIA GUTTMAN 
Unesco COURIER JOURNALIST   
OECD countries allocate one to two percent 
of their education budgets to information 
and communication technology (ICT). How 
far have they come in making them real 
learning tools? 
Relatively speaking, education hasn’t 
even begun to look at what the implica- 
tions are, and they are huge. On average, 
OECD countries spend around 0.25 per- 
cent of their education budgets on 
research and development compared to 
seven percent for certain sectors of 
industry. As a result, we still know very 
little about ICT impact on individual lear- 
ning, and teachers are not being equipped 
with the necessary skills to use these new 
tools. 
So schools are being equipped without 
much thought about the next step? 
Here there is a paradox. ICT can help 
students develop a range of skills required 
by the modern economy, such as learning 
how to learn, problem-solving, knowing 
how to acquire and evaluate informa- 
tion, but these are not reflected in the 
school curriculum. Teachers are not going 
for open-ended inquiries and the 
exchange of ideas with other schools and 
people. Leaving exams at the end of 
secondary school are still broadly based 
on a corps of knowledge and the ability to 
produce. Why should teachers invest time 
in developing new techniques that are 
not sufficiently valued by the system? At 
the same time, those who are doing so 
run the risk of prejudicing their students’ 
chances at exams 
Is ICT nonetheless changing the teacher's 
role? 
I recoil strongly from the idea of the

Schools still have to make a quantum leap if they are to prepare students 
for the information society, says Edwyn James, of the OECD Centre for 
Educational Research and Innovation 
teacher just being there when a student is 
having trouble. It suggests an aimless kind 
of educational experience. Learning is a 
planned exercise. But the pace of change 
ushered in by computer technology has 
made us more aware than ever that know- 
ledge is transient. We cannot see the tea- 
cher as someone who gets pumped up at 
university and repeats the same lessons 
for the next 40 years. Teachers have to 
develop more ties with universities and be 
well enough connected within society to 
know whom to turn to and ask questions, 
on a basis of mutual respect. 
How could training be improved? 
Teachers have to be empowered to 
use ICT. If professional development 
could take place online and provide tea- 
chers with resources to integrate ICT, 
they would gain confidence in these tech- 
nologies. Poor-quality software is ano- 
ther big obstacle. The way forward is to 
encourage dialogue between manufac- 
turers and teachers in order to decide 
what type of software is required and 
what is feasible, both technically and eco- 
nomically. This is just beginning to 
happen. 
Is ICT economically viable? 
Most computers have five-year write- 
off periods at the very most. How do you 
justify putting enormous amounts of 
hardware into a school open six hours a 
day, 40 weeks a year, when in five years, 
things will be obsolete anyway? There 
are universities where facilities are open 
around the clock,allowing users to plug 
in when they wish. The school should also 
give the community a chance to take 
advantage of its facilities. For example, 
technically skilled students could receive 
modest honoraria for doing work in the 
evenings at school. You have to see the 
school as part of the community, networ- 
king in both directions, rather than as a 
walled entity. | 
STUDENT WORDS 
o find out how ICT—notably CD- 
ROMs and the Internet—help 
or hinder learning, CERI set up an 
international network comprisedof 
29 students between 17 and 20 
years old, which culminated in a 
roundtable in December 2000. Whe- 
ther they came from North Ame- 
rica, Europe or the Pacific, their 
assessments were remarkably ali- 
gned. While recognizing that the 
Internet was a powerful tool for 
learning, many expressed frustra- 
tion with it: “Teachers say ‘You can 
search on the Internet,’ but mostly 
do not give us time to do so”; 
“Sometimes teachers give us 
addresses but we discover that they 
do not exist”; “Very often the 
lesson is spoiled by having to solve 
technical problems”; “the tradi- 
tional method of searching [in the 
encyclopaedia] is faster and safer.” 
While crying out for better teacher 
training and software, students 
also proposed steps for reducing 
the frequent “digital divide” bet- 
ween school and home. Finally, 
they expressed unease over the cul- 
tural dominance of Microsoft, rejec- 
ting the idea of a commercial 
monopoly making big profits from 
schools. Students felt that greater 
priority should be put on develo- 
ping materials with a local cultural 
flavour, while acknowledging that 
computers had the potential to 
start bridging the cultural divide.

into daily life that we barely notice it, says Simon Davies,

somewhere may be watching as you switch TV channels or 
call on a mobile phone (pp. 18-19). We are witnessing the 
rise of a surveillance society, where social control is deemed 
essential for economic efficiency and security (pp. 20-22). 
Yet even in Japan, where a high-tech market in voyeurism

Protect yourselves! To reinforce defences, the European Union is fighting to

to protect their sources (pp. 27-28). And then there is the ultimate, yet diffi-

### 122150: A Privacy divide?

A PRIVACY DIVIDE? 
BY ROHAN SAMARAIJIVA 
VISITING PROFESSOR AT DELFT UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY, NETHERLANDS; DIRECTOR OF EXTERNAL PROGRAMS, LIRNE.NET [LEARNING INITIATIVE FOR REFORMS IN NETWORK 
Economies]; AND FORMER DIRECTOR GENERAL OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS OF SRI LANKA. 
Over the past decade, the talk,and to 
some extent the practice, of privacy in rich 
countries has undergone a sea change. Pri- 
vacy, once seen as a minority concern of 
paranoid activists, is today at the centre 
of e-commerce and information society 
discussions. 
Is this concern limited to rich coun- 
tries? Is Internet and telecom privacy not 
a policy issue or a public concern in coun- 
tries on the bleak side of the digital divide? 
Is privacy a non-universal human right? I 
address these questions from the dual pers- 
pectives of a student of privacy and of a 
former privacy policy-maker. 
There is little, if any, evidence on the 
level of public concern about privacy in 
poor countries. But it is a fact that the issue 
does not figure large in the policy agendas 
of these countries. For example in Sri 
Lanka, the civil war and its attendant pro- 
blems of security, the cost of living and 
unemployment are likely to be listed as 
priority issues, not privacy. Even if the 
focus were to be narrowed to Internet and 
telecom, it is likely that access to voice 
telephones would be given more weight. 
Attitudes toward telephone numbers 
can indicate the intensity of telecom pri- 
vacy concerns. In parts of the United States 
such as Nevada well over 50 per cent of 
residential telephone numbers are unpu- 
blished. Home telephone numbers are 
usually not printed on U.S. business cards. 
By contrast, it is a rare Sri Lankan business 
card that does not flaunt one. The street 
sign of the Coroner’s Court of Sri Lanka’s 
capital city displays the Coroner’s home 
number. 
In 1998-99,1 chaired a public hearing 
on the improvement of telephone billing 
that addressed the making available of 
hitherto undisclosed and uncollected call 
details. I was surprised that only one of 
the over 400 public submissions mentioned 
privacy—an objection to the distribution of 
telephone bills unprotected by envelopes. 
Until the hearing, the major operator did 
not collect or provide call details. This was 
good for privacy but cause for much 
consumer unhappiness and billing disputes. 
The hearing had to decide on the form of 
disclosing more information. 
Do these facts not reinforce the claim 
that privacy is not universal? Academic 
research suggests otherwise. [rwin Altman 
of the U.S has shown that the essence of 
privacy—the ability, explicitly or impli- 
citly, to negotiate boundary conditions of 
social relations—is transcultural. What dif- 
fers among cultures is the concrete form of 
privacy concern. It is natural to see a heigh- 
tened awareness of Internet privacy in the 
U.S. The same form will not be found in Sri 
Lanka, where there are less than four tele- 
phones per one hundred people 
When privacy was given concrete form, 
such as indiscriminate access to the details 
about telephone calls, people understood 
and cared. That enabled the crafting of a 
final order of the public hearing that safe- 
guarded privacy while improving the trans- 
parency of the billing process 
Policy discourses in digitally deprived 
countries have emphasized external forces 
as drivers of privacy policies. In develo- 
ping elements of the legal information- 
communications infrastructure for the Sri 
Lankan government in the late 1980s, I 
found most persuasive the claim that our 
privacy policies must meet European 
Union standards for the sake of our trading 
relationships. But the external rationale 
alone is a weak foundation. Effective poli- 
cies need public support. Privacy advo- 
cates within and outside government must 
rethink their missions as including a strong 
component of public education. What I 
learned in the public hearing was the need 
to translate abstract privacy concerns into 
stories that relate to the everyday lives of 
citizens. This is the key to bridging the 
privacy divide. [|

in your refrigerator... 
Governments and corporations are wiring their way into your home and 
you may not even notice it, according to Simon Davies. The world's 
leading privacy advocate chronicles the rise of the surveillance 
society where the bedrock of civil rights—privacy—is being 
systematically chipped away (pp. 20-22) 
SIMON DAVIES 
DIRECTOR OF PRIVACY INTERNATIONAL, A HUMAN RIGHTS GROUP BASED IN LONDON (WWW.PRIVACYINTERNATIONAL.ORG) 
 
0 imagine the year 2020, forget for a 
moment the cumbersome technology por- 
trayed in George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty- 
Four. If present trends continue, surveillance 
tools will be so seamlessly integrated in our 
environment that we won’t even notice the constant 
intrusion into our privacy. 
Closed circuit television cameras (CCTV) may be 
the most obvious—and onerous—future intrusion. As 
is already the case in Britain (see p. 36), cameras will 
become a fixed component in the design of modern 
urban centres, new housing areas, public buildings and 
the road system (thanks to a massive network of linked 
number plate recognition cameras). Perhaps itis only 
a matter of time before legal and community pres- 
sures force the cameras into our homes. 
As visual surveillance becomes ubiquitous, so will 
mass surveillance of Internet and telephone activity. 
American and European law enforcement agencies 
have already laid the foundations for a massive eaves- 
dropping system capable of intercepting all mobile 
phones, Internet communications, fax messages and 
pagers throughout Europe. The plan, known as Enfopol 
98, has been drawn up in secret by police and justice offi- 
cials as part of a strategy to create a “seamless” web of 
telecommunications surveillance that will one day cross 
all national boundaries—touching citizens everyw- 
here. 
The strategy will oblige all ISPs (Internet Service

Providers) and telephone networks to provide 
agencies with “real time, full time” access to all com- 
munications, regardless of the country of origin. All new 
communications media, including interactive cable 
television, will be required to do the same. 
Enfopol will be aided by a subject-tagging system 
capable of continually tracking targeted individuals. 
Known as the “International User Requirements for 
Interception” (IUR), the system, which is currently 
being designed, will include not only the names, 
addresses and phone numbers of targets and asso- 
ciates, but email addresses, credit card details, PINs, 
passwords and even geographic data from mobile 
phones. 
Enfopol is just one of several burgeoning systems 
used to monitor and profile international 
communications. Perhaps the most astounding is 
Echelon, a global eavesdropping system established by 
the U.S. National Security Agency that is further dis- 
cussed on pages 34-35. 
Perfect surveillance requires perfect identity, and 
the next 20 years will see a comprehensive effort by 
authorities to achieve this end. As well as creating 
DNA databases—notably to identify people convicted 
of violent crimes and missing children—governments 
and companies are likely to expand the use of national 
electronic finger and hand-scanning systems. 
Known as “biometric identifiers,” these systems 
are already used throughout the world. They are sup-

posedly able to perfectly identify an individual by 
electronically scanning the fine details of a hand, finger 
or eye (retina). Spain has begun a national fingerprint 
system to control unemployment benefits and health- 
care entitlements. Russia has announced plans for a 
national electronic fingerprint system for banks. Jamai- 
cans are required to scan their thumbs into a database 
before qualifying to vote at elections. In France and 
Germany, tests are underway to put finger-print infor- 
mation onto credit cards. 
For the past five years, the U.S. Immigration and 
Naturalization Service (INS) has been developing an 
automated passport control system using hand geo- 
metry captured on a “smart” computer chip card. At the 
airport, frequent travellers present their card and then 
pass their hand through a scan. More than 70,000 
EE — 
\    
people have already enrolled in the plan which, accor- 
ding to an INS spokesman, will be expanded world- 
wide. 
Butit is the growth of workplace surveillance that 
will most directly affect people. In a majority of coun- 
tries, employers are permitted—*“within reason”—to 
place all employees under constant surveillance. They 
can tap phones, read email and monitor computer 
screens. They can bug conversations, analyze com- 
puter work, peer through CCTV cameras and use 
tracking technology like “smart” ID badges to even 
monitor trips to the bathroom. Indeed, employers now 
routinely insist on urine tests to detect drug use and 
review the most intimate personal and medical data. 
The current telephone software for keeping tabs on 
employees’ calls seems primitive compared to the new 
generation, which can analyze keystrokes on a ter- 
minal to determine if time is being efficiently used 
between conversations. Even highly skilled workers can 
expect to be regularly put under the microscope. It’s 
likely that network-operating software (which lets 
you exchange files with a colleague) already permits 
your manager to eavesdrop by observing your screen 
in real time, scanning data files and email and even 
overwriting passwords. All of which leads us in one 
direction: the workplace of tomorrow will have many 
features of the Dickensian workhouse. 
Even your home will not be free from surveillance. 
The new generation of interactive digital television 
(known as i-TV) services, currently being developed, 
will offer a new intimacy between TV service pro- 
vider and customer. By directly drawing information 
on viewing habits, financial transactions and on-screen 
“vox pop” surveys, the company can create a com- 
plex profile of every customer. 
A recent investigative book, Spy TV (edited by 
David Burke,an American researcher), describes how 
i-TV broadcasters will use neural network software to 
create “psychological profiles” and then “modify the 
behaviour” of viewers. Basically, your TV will show you 
a product, monitor your response and then show you 
something else based upon it. This cycle will let your TV 
set learn enough about you until it has you doing what 
it wants. And one day, the person controlling your TV 
will be replaced by a computer running artificial intel- 
ligence software. 
Privacy is and will be eroded in countless other 
ways. Mobile phones are being turned into geogra- 
phical tracking devices with the aim of providing cus- 
tomers “useful” information, like the location of the 
nearest petrol station or an advertisement for a local 
restaurant. The question is not whether you want or 
need these services, but do you want to be trailed? 
You are probably already being followed on the 
Internet. While some on-line companies keep track of 
consumers’ purchases, others offer personalized ser- 
vices like news searches, free email and stock portfo- 
lios. They then sell or trade this information to business 
associates without the consumer’s consent (see p.24). 
Every time you visit a website, a small file contai- 
ning an ID number—known as a “cookie”—is auto- 
matically placed on your hard drive to make it easier 
to “flip” back through pages on a website. However, 
advertising networks can use a single cookie to track 
a user across thousands of websites. The Internet Engi- 
neering Task Force (made up of network designers, ven- 
dors and researchers) is now developing a system to 
assign a permanent ID number to every device, like a 
VCR, hooked onto the net. So it may be only a matter 
ot time before somebody somewhere knows exactly 
what you keep in the refrigerator. |

HE picturesque streets of Edinburgh 
(Scotland) are currently playing host to 
an extraordinary episode in the ancient 
struggle between individual privacy and 
state power. Here, at the headquarters 
of the Lothian and Borders Police, the DNA of the 
local population is being systematically archived. 
For the past two years, every person arrested or 
detained by Edinburgh police has been forced to 
take a DNA test. The offences that warrant this 
practice are not confined to the obvious categories 
of murder, rape and burglary, but also to traffic 
offences, shoplifting, and public order transgres- 
sions such as breach of the peace. 
The collection and storage of DNA must surely 
rank as one of the most intimate invasions of the 
person,and yet the policy appears to have secured 
substantial public support. A recent opinion poll sug- 
gests that nearly three-quarters of the local popu- 
lation would be willing to give up their DNA in 
the “pursuit of a crime.” 
The UK Home Office and other government 
agencies have also been excited by the potential of 
DNA testing. Recent Child Support Agency legis- 
lation requires all alleged runaway fathers to submit 
toa DNA test. Failure to do so is tantamount in law 
to an admission of guilt. 
The current mania for DNA testing is merely a 
symptom of a much broader trend throughout the 
world. In the past, surveillance was based on the tar- 
geting of specific individuals or groups. In recent 
years, governments and private sector organiza- 
tions have moved to incorporate it into almost 
every aspect of our finances, communication and 
lifestyle. While paying lip service to privacy, they 
argue that surveillance is necessary to maintain

law and order and to promote economic efficiency. 
The rationale is often self-serving, and somewhat 
bogus, but a substantial number of people have 
nevertheless been persuaded that the surrender 
of privacy is the price we must pay for a better and 
safer society. 
The result is that many countries are becoming 
surveillance societies. There has probably never 
been a time in history when so much information has 
been amassed on the population-at-large. Details of 
the average economically active adult in the deve- 
loped world are located in around 400 major data- 
bases—enough processed data to compile a formi- 
dable reference book for each person. 
It is common wisdom that the power, capacity 
and speed of information technology are accelera- 
ting rapidly. The extent of privacy invasion—or cer- 
tainly the potential to invade privacy—increases 
correspondingly. But it is not merely the increased 
capacity and decreasing cost of information tech- 
nology that creates threats to privacy. Globalization 
of systems such as the Internet removes geogra- 
phical limitations (and legal protections) to data 
flows. Modern information systems are increasingly 
compatible and can exchange and process diffe- 
rent forms of data.Meanwhile multimedia, which 
fuses many forms of transmission and expression of 
data and images, creates vast difficulties for legis- 
lators wishing to protect personal privacy. 
An example: the company UK InfoDisc has 
produced a CD-ROM that merges the electoral 
roll data with the telephone book and geo-demo- 
graphic data.So now the most basic and innocent 
information about you can be entered into the disc, 
revealing all manner of facts. Your telephone 
number leads instantly to your address. Your name 
leads automatically to your occupation and age. It 
goes without saying that the finance and credit

industry, private investigators, newspapers, marke- 
ting companies and police all make extensive use of 
the product. 
These issues are important because the growing 
informational bond between citizen and state (and of 
course the private sector) is nibbling away at human 
autonomy. As decision-making by institutions 
becomes automated, the factors that affect our lives 
are made on the basis of an increasing mass of inti- 
mate personal data. The risk of statelessness or dis- 
crimination correspondingly intensifies. 
In developing countries, the threat is magni- 
fied. The perfect identification of individuals can 
have fatal consequences. Governments of develo- 
ping nations rely on first world countries to supply 
them with equipment for digital wiretapping, trac- 
is

king and deciphering data along with scanners, bugs 
and computer intercept systems. The transfer of 
surveillance technology from first to third world 
a lucrative sideline for the arms industry. While 
information technology companies routinely pro- 
mote their products as a means of achieving social 
reform,the human rights community increasingly 
defines them as a means of social and political 
control. 
In this environment, the struggle to strike a 
balance between individual autonomy and state 
power is more complex than ever. Not surprisingly, 
no other fundamental right in the public policy arena 
has generated such turbulence and controversy as pri- 
vacy. While the international community has rea- 
ched a baseline consensus on torture, discrimina- 
tion and racial hatred, privacy is viewed by many 
governments and corporations as the bogeyman of 
human rights. While opinion polls consistently indi-

cate that people care about privacy, public opposition 
even to the most blatant intrusion is sporadic. 
In the United States, the fingerprinting of wel-

fare recipients has proceeded with scarcely a » 
  
he world’s leading experts are still unable to agree on a 
single definition of privacy despite decades of academic 
debate. One pioneer in the field, Alan Westin of the U.S., des- 
cribed privacy as “part philosophy, some semantics, and 
much pure passion.” On that point, at least, everyone agrees. 
The recognition of privacy is nevertheless deeply rooted in 
history. The Bible makes numerous references to it. Jewish 
law has long recognized the concept of freedom from being 
watched. There were also protections in Classical Greece and 
ancient China. The Hippocratic Oath, dating from 300 BC, 
demands the confidentiality of doctor-patient relation- 
ships. Western countries have had protections for hun- 
dreds of years by, for example, applying rules to arrest 
peeping Toms or eavesdroppers. In the early 19th century, 
parliamentarian William Pitt famously wrote, “The poo- 
rest man may in his cottage bid defiance to all the force of 
the Crown. It may be frail; its roof may shake; the wind may 
blow through it; the storms may enter; the rain may enter— 
but the King of England cannot enter; all his forces dare not 
cross the threshold of the ruined tenement.” 
Indeed privacy is neither a modern nor a western concept. 
While the idea of privacy as a fundamental human right 
still raises eyebrows in many developing countries, the 
concept is familiar to the citizens of those cultures. At a 
societal and government level, privacy may be viewed with 
some suspicion, and yet at a personal level, everyone draws 
a curtain around certain aspects of family and private life. 
In some respects, privacy is similar to freedom: the less you 
have of it, the easier it is to recognize. Like the concept of 
freedom, privacy means different things to different cul- 
tures. In France, it equates most closely to liberty. In America, 
it is an inseparable component of individual freedoms— 
particularly freedom from intrusion by federal government. 
Many European countries interpret privacy as the protection 
of personal data. 
For numerous Anglo-Saxon and French authors, the right to 
privacy entails respect for “private life”: the right to live, as 
far as one wishes, protected from publicity and to develop 
fulfilling relationships. 
“In one sense, all human rights are aspects of the right to pri- 
vacy,” as Fernando Volio Jimenez, a champion of democracy 
from Costa Rica, once observed. Privacy protection is one way 
of drawing the line on how far society can intrude into your 
affairs. In that context, privacy is a question of power— 
your own as well as that of the government, your family, 
employer and neighbour. It can even be a benchmark to 
indicate how much autonomy a nation should have in the 
emerging international order. [|

murmur of discontent, while in Australia,attempts 
by the federal government to introduce a national 
identity card sparked the biggest public protest in 
recent memory. And yet while Australian legislation 
forcing banks to report suspicious transactions 
passed without notice, similar legislation in the U.S. 
provoked more than a quarter of a million written 
complaints. In Germany and Australia, proposals to 
introduce digital phone services sparked wides- 
pread privacy concerns. Identical technology in Bri- 
tain was introduced with little or no discussion. 
The most dangerous enemy of privacy, however, 
is the well-meaning individual who argues “I have 
nothing to hide, so I have nothing to fear.” Nothing 
could be further from the truth. Everyone has a 
= 
sphere of private life which must be protected from 
intrusion. Few people could honestly claim that 
their life—their family details, financial affairs and 
health history—is an open book.Even if this were 
so, their happy position should not provide a ration- 
ale for the invasion of other people’s lives. 
But the argument for privacy goes well beyond 
the integrity and autonomy of each individual. 
Privacy is the fundamental test of a free society’s 
strength. The right to privacy is the right to protect 
ourselves against intrusion by the outside world. It 
is the measure we use to set limits on the demands 
made upon us. It is the right we invoke to defend 
our personal freedom, our autonomy and our 
identity. It is the basis upon which we assess the 
balance of power between ourselves and the world 
around us. 
Privacy is also the natural partner of freedom of 
expression. They are equal and compatible rights. 
More so, both have evolved in the modern context 
as a synergy. As the world embraces the information 
 
society and our lives go increasingly on-line, the 
forces that promote censorship also diminish pri- 
vacy—and vice versa. 
It will become apparent in the coming years 
that these two rights will form the Great Pillars of 
any free society. [|

more and more miniaturized devices Prices range 
from 30,000 yen ($255) to 
200,000 yen ($1,700), and sales 
at Laox have been rising since 
1999. These items are especially 
popular with 15 to 25 year-olds 
(the sedai video-game genera- 
tion) and with otaku (children of 
the virtual empire). Others, 
known as the camera kozé , get 
their share of fun from snapping 
embarrassing pictures with 
remote-controlled miniature 
cameras. 
In Japan, a society influenced 
by Confuciansim, control over 
the self and others has always 
been the norm. The neighbou- 
rhood police station (koban) and 
foot patrolmen still frequently 
draw up detailed lists of local 
residents and inquire about the 
identity of newcomers as soon 
as they move in. Neighbourhood 
committees (fonarigumi), an ins- 
titution dating back to the 16th 
century, were used during the 
Second World War to punish acti- 
vities deemed anti-Japanese. 
Although the committees are on 
the wane, they still exist. 
Today, these traditional ways of watching people 
seem harmless compared to the spying being done 
with new electronic products. There are regular 
reports on television about acts of voyeurism. Some 
people specialize in spying on public toilets, while 
others hide cameras and microphones in the homes 
of friends or young, single women. Others have 
turned into Internet paparazzi, broadcasting their 
stealthy pictures on the Web. Recently, the marathon 
runner Naoko Takahashi, who has become a star 
since bringing home a gold medal from the Sydney 
Olympics, found that her fame had stretched beyond 
acceptable limits. Thousands of copies of a video 
featuring her naked in her bathroom have been ille- 
gally sold. A miniature camera filmed the pictures 
without her knowledge. 
The Japanese are increasingly concerned about 
the rising number of abuses. In January, a high school 
teacher was arrested for filming his students changing 
in the locker room, and a cameraman from the 
national NHK television network filmed people at 
home without their knowing it.Debate is stepping 
up over an inexpensive service called Imadoko 
(“where are you?”),which allows parents to track 
their children’s every move. A microchip built into 
a cell phone tells the company where the user is at 
all times. At the parents’ request, the company sends 
them a map showing their child’s exact wherea- 
bouts. 
The Japanese feel even more anxious because 
HENRY 
on A 
the government has recently passed a law streng- 
thening the powers of the central police authorities 
(NPA) and the justice ministry to use spying tools 
such as phone taps and email screening. “This law 
is designed to help criminal investigations, not to 
interfere in people’s daily lives,” the NPA says. 
But some specialists, such as Shin Mizukoshi, a 
media expert at Tokyo University, are asking 
uneasy questions:“Has Big Brother broken into 
our homes? Isn’t police interception of commu- 
nications a new invasion of privacy?” 
These methods are mainly used to combat com- 
puter piracy. A law “forbidding illegal access”has 
just come into force — it punishes computer crimes 
with a year’s imprisonment and a 500,000-yen fine 
(85,000).Eighty engineer-police officers stalk cri- 
minals at the NPA’s High-Tech Crime Technical 
Expert Center, a cyber-surveillance centre with an 
annual budget of 190 million yen ($1.85 million). 
But trouble-makers are also honing their elec- 
tronics skills. Recently, a pair of kidnappers used 
prepaid phones to announce their ransom 
demands and conditions. “The omnipresence of 
advanced mobile communication systems creates 
new challenges,” says an NPA official.“ Compro- 
mises are necessary in the interest of the public 
and its security.” As legal expert Yoichi Higuchi 
observes, the right to privacy may remain “virtual” 
in Japan. |

wo hundred dollars just for answering a 
questionnaire. The offer from an Ame- 
rican group called Greenfield Consulting 
recently landed in the electronic mailbox 
of a member of France’s Information Tech- 
nology and Freedom Commission (CNIL). The attrac- 
tive proposal reflects the high premium that com- 
panies put on gathering data about Internet users. 
Every year in late January, a huge file fair, the 
“customer relations” exhibition, takes place in 
Paris. At this year’s event, entirely devoted to e- 
commerce and the Internet, I-Base, a start-up 
founded in 1999, offered its file of 15 to 35 year-olds, 
“a behavioural database of over 700,000 young 
people.” Where do the names and data come from? 
The company refuses to answer the question. Ano- 
ther firm taking part in the event, Consodata, is 
one of France’s two megabase companies. Each 
year, Consodata and its counterpart, Claritas, send 
a form to millions of mailboxes with questions 
about outstanding loans, reading habits, hobbies, etc. 
Every bit counts: with time, these information snip- 
pets turn into refined consumer profiles that are 
worth gold. 
In the age of e-commerce and personalized 
services, these companies are increasingly inter-

Consodata has set up a special subsidiary called

send forms to the most popular sites, asking visitors 
to answer questions about their profession, leisure 
activities, children and so on. What’s more, the 
Internet users are “tracked” while making pur- 
chases and surfing the Net. This enables online 
marketing firms to send them increasingly specific 
offers. These companies boast about being able to 
send up to 100 million emails a day! Since there are 
about 200 of them worldwide, their total strike 
force may be as high as 20 billion emails a day, 
says Gauthronet,or “about sixty emails per elec- 
tronic mailbox every 24 hours!” 
When the cookies 
crumble 
Gauthronet has just submitted a detailed report 
about these practices to the European Commis- 
sion. His first conclusion is that data-gathering 
methods seem more transparent now than they did 
a few years ago, when the overwhelming majority of 
companies collected information without Internet 
users knowing it. Their most widespread methods 
consisted of using “cookies” (software installed on 
hard drives to record users’ comings and goings on 
the Net), or directing their questions to children, 
who are more forthcoming. Nowadays, informa- 
tion is increasingly gathered with the express 
consent of the consumer (known as the “opt-in” 
principle), who can pull out of the game at any 
time. Another advance is “permission marketing”: 
e-marketers are starting to ask users for their

mine Internet surfers’ profiles so that they can be sent tailor-made adver-

As long as Internet users were identified only by information about their 
computers, they remained relatively anonymous. But everything changed 
in 1999 when DoubleClick bought out Abacus, a database company that 
kept track of some two billion online orders—and the names of millions 
of Americans who placed them! DoubleClick combined its own files with 
that of Abacus to make an even bigger, more accurate database—and, more 
alarming still, one with names. 
Privacy watchdog groups went on the offensive and sued the company. 
Eventually, DoubleClick was forced to give up its megabase. 
More recently, the world’s biggest e-bookseller, Amazon, sparked another 
controversy. In September 2000, the money-losing business suddenly 
decided to rent customer information to third parties, something it had 
agreed not to do. Again, American privacy advocates sued. The bookseller

So, where’s the threat? First,says Gauthronet, 
some companies don’t always have a very scrupu- 
lous vision of opt-in. “For example,” he explains, “an 
Internet user just has to bookmark a site to be 
considered giving consent for everything and any- 
thing.” In another abuse, sensitive information 
sometimes finds its way into a routine and autho- 
rized data-gathering procedure without the Internet 
user knowing it. Beyond that, Gauthronet raises 
issues of freedom and “the dispossession of the 
self” that databases are going to bring about. “When 
your identity is frozen,” he says, “you're stripped of 
the right and means to define yourself the way you 
want to.” And of course, he mentions the steady 
erosion of the consumer’s privacy. 
Vacancies 
in the safe harbor 
On October 25, 1995, the European Union 
unanimously adopted a directive that gives all its 
citizens the right to access databases, the right of rec- 
tification,and the right to refuse the sale of data to 
a third party. The measure also stipulates that no file 
may leave Europe for a third country unless the 
latter can guarantee an “adequate” level of personal 
data protection. This means that American Express 
and Microsoft, for example, cannot repatriate 
employee and client files to the United States unless 
they sign a contract agreeing to respect certain 
rules. 
However, even a united Europe is having a hard 
time making its views heard, especially in the United 
States. Shortly before the directive entered into 
force on October 25, 1998, Washington was still 
defending the principle of “self-regulation.” The 
deadlock between the U.S. Federal Trade Com- 
mission and the European Commission dragged 
on for two years. Eventually, in July 2000, both par- 
ties signed the “safe harbor”accord,which quietly 
entered into force on November 1. According to the 
agreement, to keep trans-Atlantic data flowing, 
companies must agree to observe the European 
directive’s basic principles and to accept sanctions 
if they don’t. The United States, Hungary and Swit- 
zerland have received the EU’s “clean country” 
label. 
However, the measure is not to American com- 
panies’ liking. So far, just seven businesses have 
joined safe harbor! French legal expert Etienne 
Drouard,who is following the issue for the CNIL, 
doubts it will be successful: American companies 
“consider the agreement as a relinquishing of 
national sovereignty!” he says. But the whole issue 
may crop up again this year, because Washington is 
showing signs of taking a harder line on privacy. 
After the Amazon and DoubleClick scandals (see 
box) among others, privacy has become a hot poli- 
tical issue. The new congressional members had 
barely taken their seats when several of them put 
forward bills on the matter. Apparently, free-market 
America is coming up against its citizens’ increa- 
singly fierce resistance. [|

The dot.bomb syndrome 
Everyone agrees that privacy is good for business. But is there a market 
for companies offering to protect it? 
EVAN HENDRICKS 
EpITOR/PUBLISHER OF PRIVACY TIMES, BASEDIN WASHINGTON DC 
    hile several firms have recently suf- 
fered class-action lawsuits and public 
outrage over apparent intrusions 
into customers’ personal data, 
American Express is one of a 
number of businesses that may be blazing the right 
path from privacy to profits. 
Last year, the credit card issuer rolled out 
“Private Payments,” enabling its customers to go 
online and obtain “Disposable” credit card numbers 
that could be used for only one online purchase. If 
the number was ever stolen after being used for a 
purchase, it would be worthless. 
A key lesson is that protecting privacy, in this 
case the credit card number, became an “enhanced 
value”to an existing service. Moreover, American 
Express understood that the credit card number 
was the “tip of the privacy iceberg”—it plans to 
roll out a suite of related services, like anonymous 
Internet browsing, in 2001. Rival companies, like 
Visa/Mastercard,are following the same trail. 
Another company to watch is PrivaSys, of San 
Francisco, which has patented technology to enable 
plastic credit cards to generate disposable num- 
bers for each purchase. 
PrivaSys does this by 
equipping the card with a 
calculator-styled key pad 
and LCD screen, a very 
thin battery, and a special 
magnetic stripe. The card- 
holder punches a 4-digit 
PIN into the credit card 
itself and—voila/—the card 
generates the disposable   
number. 
But securing payments 
is just one part of an emer- 
ging privacy protection 
market. Other firms are 
offering anonymous or 
“pseudonymous”’browsing 
tools, packages to control     
cookies—the strings of 
code that are planted on 
the user’s computer by 
websites—and services to 
block hacker intrusion.

companies will control niche markets or achieve cri- 
tical mass. 
What's clear is that the nascent e-commerce 
industry badly miscalculated the importance of pri- 
vacy to their business model. For without privacy, 
there was no consumer confidence, and without 
such confidence, e-commerce had no chance of ful- 
filling the short-term, high expectations that ini- 
tially sent their stock values soaring. The current 
shake-out of the “dot.bomb” industry shows how 
costly this miscalculation over privacy was. 
An added but 
essential value 
But if you thought privacy was a big issue for e- 
commerce, consider the debate on the wireless 
industry. Referred to as Mobile or M-commerce, this 
industry appears to have unlimited potential to 
deliver information and location-based services, 
advertisements, and discount coupons to cellular 
phones and hand-held wireless devices. M-com- 
merce risks hitting the major “privacy buttons’: 
constant surveillance via location-based tracking; 
unsolicited ads clogging communications devices; 
detailed profiles of individuals’ interests and move- 
ments;and insecure payment mechanisms. 
Nonetheless, the industry is showing signs that 
it has learned from the mistakes of e-commerce. A 
few months ago at a workshop of the U.S Federal 
Trade Commission, leading wireless industry groups 
unveiled guidelines requiring companies to obtain 
a consumer’s consent before collecting or using 
personal data. This wasn’t altruism: the industry 
understands that consumers will not tolerate com- 
mercial services to their cell phones unless they 
explicitly consent. 
So far, privacy’s brief tenure in the commercial 
marketplace indicates that some people are willing 
to pay extra to protect their privacy. But the more 
important lesson is that consumers are unlikely to 
take more than a few extra steps to secure their data. 
If they perceive that a given medium, like the 
Internet, is not privacy-friendly, they either change 
their habitual uses or actually refrain from them 
altogether. 
The likelihood is that privacy will become an 
“added value,” creating a market for those who can 
integrate privacy into payment mechanisms without 
excessively burdening the consumer. |

### 122157: The Quiet revolution

The quiet 
revolution 
From Guatemala to Kosovo, 
human rights groups 
have taken a page out 
of a spy thriller by learning 
the art of encryption 
SUELETTE DREYFUS 
AUSTRALIAN JOURNALISTAND AUTHOR OF 
UNDERGROUND—TALES OFHACKING, 
MADNESS AND OBSESSION ON THE ELECTRONIC FRONTIER (RANDOM 
House, 1997) 
  
quiet revolution is creeping through 
human rights groups around the world. 
Don’t expect to see noisy marches 
through the streets of Guatemala or 
angry protests in Kosovo, though both 
places are hotspots in the transformation. The revo- 
lution is running through electronic ether and human 
grey matter. 
Computer technology, and particularly crypto- 
graphy software (which uses secret codes to trans- 
form data into a stream of seemingly random cha- 
racters), is subtly changing the balance of power 
between repressive governments and the human 
rights groups that watch them. From Cambodia to 
El Salvador, grassroots human rights organizations 
are embracing software that allows them to track 
government abuses and then hide their data in 
order to protect sources. 
A driving force in this revolution is Dr. Patrick 
Ball, deputy director of the science and human rights 
program at the American Association for the Advan- 
cement of Science (AAAS). For the past nine years, 
Ball has been discreetly travelling in the wake of wars 
and insurrections to train human rights workers in 
the science of information gathering. He has shaped 
and protected databases in places such as El Sal- 
vador, Guatemala,Haiti,Ethiopia,Albania, Kosovo 
and South Africa,among others. 
Crucial testimony 
under lock and key 
When Ball first began this training in the early 
1990s, most human rights workers were techno- 
phobes. Technology, used for so long as a tool of 
spying by repressive governments, was clearly the 
enemy. Every project was tough work, as Ball tried 
to convince people in the field to adopt increasingly 
cheap computer software as a means of deftly tur- 
ning the tables on governments. About three years 
ago however, the climate began to change.

gnize the tremendous analytic power large-scale 
data brings to us and you simply cannot do that 
without technology,” says Ball. While visiting groups 
in Cambodia who were learning to use this tech- 
nology, I was struck by the enormous piles of paper 
on every desk. It could take two weeks to extract one 
simple figure, such as how many rapes were reported 
in Cambodia in a month. 
Cheap computers and, more importantly, easy- 
to-use software programmes are changing that, says 
Ball. Database, spreadsheet, word processing and 
communications programmes have made it pos- 
sible for even small organizations to track abuses 
with scientific rigour. 
This analytic precision makes a powerful 
weapon.It also makes a logical target for political 
opponents. Witnesses often risk life and limb when 
they come forward to report an abuse committed by p

the government. As a result, “human rights groups 
are using cryptography in the field to secure data- 
bases, investigations, field reports and witness iden- 
tities—all data that might put somebody’s security 
or liberty at risk,” Ball says. 
In fact, encryption played a key role in breaking 
the silence born from 36 years of terror and civil war 
in Guatemala, which killed more than 100,000 
people, most of them Mayan Indians. Until recently, 
most Guatemalans would have been shocked by the 
fact that the following testimony was publicly docu- 
mented: “My sister went shopping in Rabinal,but 
when she got to the hamlet of Plan de Sanchez the 
army was already there. There they grabbed her 
and raped her in a house. There were fifteen girls 
raped and then they were riddled with bullets. After- 
wards, they were buried by the people in a clan- 
destine cemetery.” 
New flashpoints in 
the crypto-wars 
This personal account, from a report by AAAS 
and the International Center for Human Rights 
Research (CIIDH) in Guatemala City, was one of 
many given by witnesses who wanted their names 
kept secret for fear of retribution. The CIIDH and 
several partner organizations gathered more than 
5,000 testimonies between 1994 and 1995. 
CIIDH was one of the first human rights groups 
in the world to secure its database by using PGP, 
now the most popular cryptography software in 
the field. Workers smuggled laptop computers and 
solar panels into remote mountain areas where 
they spent months scouring the region by foot and 
mule to gather testimony from people forced to 
hide from the military. They systematically burnt 
every paper trace of their work and encrypted the 
data before sending it back to the capital for analysis. 
They later emailed PGP-encrypted copies of the 
material overseas to a safe back-up site. 
Guatemala remains one of the best examples of 
how a human rights community embraced techno- 
logy, according to Ball. They continue to use secu- 
rity software to protect the identities of witnesses as 
well as the integrity of the data—to ensure that 
political opponents don’t sneak into databases to 
corrupt the information and discredit the group’s 
work. 
Nevertheless, “some groups choose not to use 
cryptography because hiding their work would 
make the government consider them a national 
security threat,” says Ball. “I don’t really think that 
any of the human rights groups is a security threat. 
They may embarrass certain military or police offi- 
cials who have committed atrocities, but all the 
groups I know are dedicated to their country’s 
democratization and civil liberties” 
Throughout the 1990s, the U.S. government and 
activists fought a political war over the right to use 
The Unesco Courier - March 2001 
and to share strong cryptography with the rest of the 
world—a war that Ball says has now finished in the 
U.S. “At the end of the day,” he says, “the U.S. 
government decided the economic and civil liberty 
costs of regulating crypto were greater than the 
rather shrill claims made by law enforcement and 
national security officials,” who maintained that 
the tools would assist criminals and terrorists. 
While he has not seen any crypto-wars waged in 
the countries where he has worked, there are still 
places that either control the use of cryptography or 
are hoping to do so in the future. According to Ball, 
“the war front in the fight for widespread human 
rights access to crypto is currently in North Korea, 
Iran, Vietnam—and the UK.” To avoid this battle, 
many groups don’t admit to using encryption. Why 
advertise the fact that a computer screen of see- 
mingly random characters can be transformed into 
witness reports of killing and torture? |

quantitative reflection, can be found at:

THE TRUTH ABOUT HAITI 
he revolution in human rights work isn’t just 
about securing data, it's also about uncovering 
and analyzing the right information. A case in 
point is Haiti's Truth Commission, which has wor- 
ked with Dr. Ball since 1995. After conducting 
about 5,500 interviews, the commission documen- 
ted more than 18,000 reported human rights 
abuses before analyzing the data to determine the 
truth about what happened in Haiti under milita- 
ry rule, specifically in 1993-94. 
“When we took a list of all the people who were 
killed and made a graph of it, we saw that political 
murders bunched up in a couple of different points 
in time,” says Ball. When the team timelined the 
data against other events, they discovered a surge 
in human rights abuses at the same time as a U.S. 
troop carrier entered the waters around the 
island—a possible first step to military interven- 
tion. 
“What was interesting is that a lot of apologists 
for the Haitian regime had argued that this vio- 
lence in the streets was just nationalist fever— 
that it was really the fault of the U.S. by threate- 
ning to intervene. But over time, you see the same 
fights all over the country implying a kind of co- 
ordination of those who were committing the ter- 
ror,” says Ball. “You also wouldn't expect deten- 
tion by state authorities to increase at the same 
time as extortion by paramilitary organizations.” 
The most logical conclusion, says Ball, was that 
Haitian paramilitary groups created state-sanctio- 
ned terror in the streets to intimidate and dissua- 
de Haitian society from calling for U.S. interven- 
tion and the restoration of President Aristide. HW

  AMY OTCHET 
Unesco COURIER JOURNALIST 
bout five years ago, my mother started 
acting bizarre: telling secrets and lies. 
She was only 59 but she began falling 
down a lot and her eyebrow would 
twitch uncontrollably. The day after I 
found out she had Huntington’s I went to the library 
because I knew nothing about the disease. I 
remember standing there, my two young boys playing 
at my feet, as I went through the medical jargon to 
find out three things: first, there is no cure—my 
mother is going to die; second, her children—my 
brother, two sisters and myself—have a 50 percent 
chance of inheriting the gene causing the disease; and 
third, our kids are at risk.” 
“I knew that I had to keep this secret—from eve- 
ryone but my family. I went on the Internet where 
I found a kind of underground Huntington’s com- 
munity—they told me about the genetic test for 
the disease but warned me to be careful. After hea- 
ring the stories about people losing their jobs and 
medical insurance, I decided not to test.” 
Julie Sando is not alone in the U.S. Many people 
are protecting their genetic secrets by foregoing 
intimate knowledge about themselves and their 
families. Indeed fear of genetic discrimination is 
cited as the major reason why about one-third of 
people approached by the National Human 
Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) refuse to 
participate in testing according to Barbara Fuller, 
senior policy advisor. After geneticists first identi- 
fied the gene linked to Huntington’s in 1993,they 
predicted that they would eliminate the disease in 
a generation. Yet only 15 to 25 percent of eligible 
people in the U.S. have undergone testing. To grasp 
the emotional stakes embedded in these genetic 
secrets, Julie Sando recounts her experience. 
  
A hazy view of genetics as 
a window on the soul 
“I waited four and a half years to have a test. Not 
one day went by that I didn’t think I saw a symptom 
of the disease—I’d see my hand twitch or just 
stumble over my words. Every time, I asked ‘is that 
it?’ I couldn’t stand the mental anguish of not kno- 
wing if my kids had the disease. It was time to face 
it... There are two ways of testing: either go through 
your insurance and put it on record or stay anony-

mous and pay out of pocket (about $1,000). We 
didn’t have the cash so I took the ultimate risk.” 
To protect patients like Julie about 75 percent 
of the states have passed laws, mostly in the last five 
years, to protect the confidentiality of genetic infor- 
mation. A new set of federal regulations to reinforce 
medical privacy in general is supposed to apply in 
2003,but the new administration may re-open the 
debate. 
Yet some studies suggest that fear of genetic 
discrimination overshadows the actual number of 
cases documented. A major survey of health insu- 
rance regulators, company representatives, agents 
and genetic counsellors from seven states was publi- 
shed at the end of 1999 to compare the impact of 
genetic privacy legislation. According to one of the 
authors, Mark Hall, a professor at Wake Forest 
University School of Medicine, “we didn’t find a 
single well-documented case of discrimination.” 
On the contrary, he reported that a person with a 
serious but asymptomatic genetic condition faces 
little or no difficulty in obtaining health insurance. 
The reason,Hall says, is that insurance companies 
assume people will change jobs and therefore poli- 
cies every two to five years. So by the time a client 
actually requires treatment, it is likely that he or she 
will have moved on to another insurer. 
But as critics point out, though this may be 
the case for a 35-year-old woman genetically p

at the age of 50? As genetic tests become more 
accurate and accessible in the next few years, “I 
cannot think of a reason why underwriters would 
not use them,” says Fuller of the NHGRI. Hence 
Julie Sando’s expression, “I took the ultimate risk. 
” By notifying her insurer, she may have put her chil- 
dren at risk of being denied coverage in the future 
(see box). 
“At the first appointment,” recalls Julie, “the 
geneticist asked all kinds of questions: ‘who will 
you tell about the test and why?’ But the real kicker 
was, ‘Do you have nursing home insurance?’ I was 
35 and asked if that wasn’t far-fetched. The res- 
ponse was a dead,’ No.

public fear may be tinged by confusion over gene- 
tics and the notion that “we are the sum of our 
genes,” which pervades popular culture. For many 
people, test results are seen as windows onto our 
souls, says Wertz. Not only are we powerless to alter 
this information, but it may be used against us. 
Hence the gut instinct to preserve “genetic pri- 
vacy”at all costs. 
Yet this notion of “genetic privacy” doesn’t 
make sense biologically. For example, many of 
the state laws offer special protection for genetic 
testing of a disease like Huntington’s. Yet an ordi- 
nary cholesterol test can reveal a great deal about 
family history like predisposition to heart disease.

he said, “You don’t have the 
gene and neither do your children. But that doesn’t 
change anything for your siblings.’ I felt like a 
zombie. It took a year to get over survivor's guilt. 
“I’m the only one in the family who has gone for 
a test. I recently asked my sister what keeps her from 
going. She said, ‘I’ve a friend who tested negati- 
vely for the disease but her company found it in her 
files and they let her go. I have a sick husband. How 
would we live if I lost my job and our insurance 
benefits?’” 
While recognizing the threat of discrimination, 
some experts like Dorothy Wertz of the Shriver 
Center (a research organization) wonder whether 
Julie agrees that the 
solution lies in protecting 
medical, not just genetic, privacy. Yet this does not 
rule out the need for laws to prevent genetic discri- 
mination,according to patient rights advocates like 
Joanne Hustead, director of the non-profit National 
Partnership of Women and Families. “This is the new 
frontier of civil rights—which is about protecting 
people from discrimination on the basis of immutable 
and very personal characteristics like race and reli- 
gion. There is also a bit of self-interest involved,” 
she says. “Everyone has genetic mutations and the 
moment that you start making decisions on the basis 
of one mutation or another, there is no end to it. We 
are all at risk.” | 
THE LUXURY OF INSURANCE   
nlike the universal healthcare systems of 
Canada or France, most people in the 
U.S. rely on their jobs for access to health 
insurance. Either employers negotiate com- 
petitive deals with the major insurance com- 
panies or they actually pay for their wor- 
kers’ medical services. Employers are 
increasingly (55-65 percent) opting for the 
latter option because of tax benefits. 
However, their employees risk paying a high 
price in terms of privacy. As medical records 
become incorporated into electronic data- 
bases, employers may increasingly identify   
 
“expensive” workers: those suffering from or 
predisposed to a serious condition. Moreover, 
these employers are exempt from state insu- 
rance regulations protecting genetic infor- 
mation. 
Individuals can also apply directly to insu- 
rance companies. However, most policies 
are “rated”: different customers pay different 
costs according to their health risks and 
family histories. So it may be only a matter 
of time before genetic tests are used in the 
screening process. [|

### 122159: A Tireless troubleshooter

A tireless troubleshooter 
A renegade legislator introduces Hong Kong to the “luxury” of privacy 
GLENN SCHLOSS   
3 ey i 
James To:bugged by surveillance. 
ames To is convinced his telephones are 
tapped. A policeman tipped him off but To 
feels neither paranoid nor outraged, simply 
resigned. For the past ten years, he has relent- 
lessly monitored the surveillance tactics of 
Hong Kong’s 
rulers—British and Chinese—and phone- 
tapping has been on top of his list. 
“My interest is very simple:it’s about Big Bro- 
ther. The government should have the minimum 
amount of information about citizens,” says the 
Democrat Party legislator. “I don’t want the govern- 
ment to be my friend.It should leave us alone and 
then we will have the potential to develop our- 
selves into what we want to be.” 
To’s strong views were forged by experience. He 
was first elected at the age of 28 in 1990—a pivotal 
moment in Hong Kong's history when British admi- 
nistrators sought to reassure a population panicked 
by the 1989 violence at Tiananmen Square and the 
return to Chinese rule in 1997. The colonial powers 
sought to calm public fears by introducing a Bill of 
Rights to locally enshrine the International Cove- 
nant on Civil and Political Rights. 
After examining the much-touted law, the 
young To found little in the way of privacy pro- 
tection, which was not surprising. “Even in the 
mother country, Britain,there is no Bill of Rights 
or mechanism to ensure privacy,” says To, aside 
from jurisprudence. Ironically, it was a British lec- 
turer, Raymond Wacks, who first introduced him to

Hong Kong in the 1980s. Since then, academic 
curiosity has become a personal commitment. 
The colonial authorities paid little heed to To’s 
warnings. But they could not ignore the European 
Union’s threats in 1994 to prohibit its member 
countries’ banks from dealing with their counter- 
parts in Hong Kong without legal data protection. 
A year later, the legislature passed the Personal 
Data Ordinance. Once again, To uncovered a major 
loophole:the law did not apply to the Telecommu- 
nications Ordinance that gave the government 
extensive wiretapping powers. He introduced his 
own bill requiring a judge to oversee the process, but 
the British authorities rejected it. 
Today his battle against phone-tapping covers 
wider ground. New laws permit the police to create 
an extensive DNA database by collecting samples 
from anyone suspected or convicted of a serious 
crime. Immigration officials are also spearheading 
efforts to install a national system of “smart” cards, 
embedded with microchips, to replace the paper 
identity cards. Residents must now carry these paper 
documents at all times and apply for identification 
numbers for the most banal tasks, like getting a 
phone line installed, visiting a residential building 
after hours or even booking a tennis court. 
The omnipresent 
“smart” card 
The smart cards are supposed to offer more 
efficient services, but privacy advocates fear they 
could do far more. By centralizing the most personal 
and minute details—from the title of a book bor- 
rowed from a library to medical data—any “card- 
reading” authority could use these profiles to exert 
leverage over the individual by, for example, passing 
sensitive information to an employer. 
Yet as To pushes for legal protection, his fellow 
citizens seem uninterested. The entrenched habit of 
carrying identification papers, he says, has made sur- 
veillance seem normal in Hong Kong. People are 
willing to tolerate intrusion so long as it doesn’t 
hinder their attempts to make money, according to the 
legislator. And if the situation becomes difficult,they 
are prepared to emigrate overseas. “Privacy is viewed 
as a luxury,” he says. “It’s not part of Chinese culture,” 
which privileges the collective over the rights of the 
individual. But for To, the opposite is true: the well- 
being of the group depends on the security of each 
and every one of its members. |

U.S. ATTORNEY AND DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF PRIVACY INTERNATIONAL, A UK-BASED HUMAN RIGHTS GROUP 
s you flip through the pages of this 
March issue, members of the Council of 
Europe will be poring over a blueprint 
to force its countries and others around 
the world to dramatically increase sur- 
veillance and invade your privacy in the name of 
preventing cybercrime (see box). An eclectic coalition 
of civil rights and corporate groups however, has 
launched an offensive against the proposed cyber- 
crime treaty as well as a battery of controversial 
national laws and international standards. 
Not surprisingly, the first privacy campaign 
emerged in the US. an Internet stronghold, against 
the infamous Clipper Chip. According to the govern- 
ment, this cryptographic device would have offered 
a standard for securing private voice communication. 
Two government agencies would have held the 
“keys,” to be handed out only with “legal authori- 
zation.” Privacy-minded citizens quickly saw the 
dangers of this in light of the federal government’s 
history of illegal domestic surveillance. In 1994, 
50,000 people—a hefty chunk of the cybernaut popu- 
The Unesco Courier - March 2001 
lation—signed the largest Internet petition of its 
time against the proposal,which died soon after. 
Perhaps the most striking feature in the battle to 
protect privacy has been the diversity of groups 
involved. The year 1996 saw a motley crew of immi- 
gration groups, gun-owners, liberals and conserva- 
tives band together to oppose legislation that would 
notably have extended wiretapping and allowed 
for more investigations of political groups. Irish- 
American and Arab-American associations joined 
out of concern that they would be more aggressively 
targeted in the “war on terrorism.” Meanwhile, the 
fear of a more invasive government rallied gun- 
owners alongside groups from across the ideological 
spectrum. Once again, by tapping the Internet’s 
power to organize and disseminate information, 
they shelved the legislation. 
But this ad hoc co-operation is based on shaky 
ground. There was considerable coordination, for 
example, between civil liberties groups and the 
industry to oppose the 1994 Communications Assis- 
tance for Law Enforcement Act, which requires

telecommunications carriers to modify their equip- 
ment, facilities and services in order to comply with 
authorized electronic surveillance. Yet once the 
industry received a promise of government fun- 
ding to implement the law, it quickly abandoned the 
coalition.Corporate representatives then jumped 
sides again and sued the government over imple- 
mentation rules in a controversy that is still brewing. 
Old enemies 
become new allies 
With the Internet’s growth, the privacy battle is 
becoming increasingly international. Most Western 
European countries have at least one cyber-rights 
group, a trend that is spreading across the continent 
and Asia, particularly in Japan.At the same time, 
existing human rights groups have also started to 
focus on the Internet. All it takes is for a single 
national government to ban free speech on the Web 
and the issue instantly takes on a global character. 
For decades, international bodies like the Orga- 
nisation for Economic Co-operation and Develop- 
ment (OECD), the Council of Europe and the 
European Union (EU) have been developing inter- 
national standards relating to privacy, free speech 
and other civil liberties issues. Their work has 
included brokering common rules on data protec 
tion and encryption policy to promote e-commerce. 
While some government representatives have put 
a stronger emphasis on protecting human rights, 
debate, strongly influenced by the International 
Chamber of Commerce, a powerful lobby of 
industry groups. Today, by pressuring governments 
bilaterally and multilaterally, the U.S. is leading the 
efforts to expand surveillance worldwide. This pres- 
sure amounts to what privacy advocates call “policy 
laundering”: by pushing other governments into 
accepting controversial plans like the Clipper Chip, 
international standards will be developed which 
will in turn force the U.S. Congress to accept pro- 
posals it had originally rejected. 
To respond with more muscle to these trends, a 
new opposition front emerged in 1996:the Global 
Internet Liberty Campaign (GILC), started by the 
Electronic Privacy Information Center, Human 
Rights Watch and the American Civil Liberties 
Association. The group now represents over 50 
NGOs from some 30 countries. GILC operates by 
consensus. Member organizations propose specific 
actions such as drafting letters to world leaders, 
releasing reports and holding conferences. Member 
groups then agree to join in the action. 
GILC and groups like the Trans-Atlantic 
Consumer Dialogue (TACD) are making inroads 
into the policy processes. Perhaps the most tan- 
gible signs of their success are the frequent invita- 
tions to participate in OECD meetings. But the 
movement has just one foot in the door: the next 
step lies in strengthening the role of NGOs out- 
side the U.S. The problem lies in the old Achilles heel 
IN A WIRED WORLD 
  
economic interests have clearly dominated the 
  
CYBERCRIME CONVENTION: 
of international movements:a lack of funding. m 
ONE FALSE MOVE, AND YOU'RE A HACKER! 
In 1997, a Council of Europe working group formed by law 
enforcement officials and interior ministers from select COE 
member countries, the U.S., Canada and Japan began drafting 
an international convention on cybercrime. Since then, the 
treaty has gone through 25 drafts. 
Unlike similar actions at the OECD, civil liberties and industry 
associations were not invited to participate. The Committee 
met behind closed doors for several years and did not release 
a draft until April 2000. Instead of openly discussing the pro- 
posal, the COE asked people to submit comments via the 
Internet. Despite the hundreds of emails sent, only minor 
changes have been made to the original draft. 
The treaty is extremely law-enforcement oriented, barely 
mentioning civil liberties, human rights or corporate inter- 
ests. The basic premise is that behaviour is prohibited unless 
allowed. The first section creates broad new categories for com- 
puter crimes that could, for example, outlaw the develop- 
ment of basic tools to test the security of computer systems. 
The treaty also expands the definition of hacking to include vio- 
lations of contracts and the terms of service posting on web- 
sites. One example: bypassing the main page (and the adver- 
tising) of a commercial site to reach an inner page would be a 
violation of law. Similarly, Internet service providers could be 
held liable if their users link to child pornography, even if 
they are not aware of it. Average citizens could even be held 
guilty for putting incorrect information on web forms to pro- 
 
tect their privacy. 
Governments would also have the mandate to enact broad 
new powers on wiretapping, real-time collection of traffic 
data as well as the search and seizure of information. 
Most strikingly, the draft treaty fails to incorporate the COE’s 
long-standing human rights protections. When asked publicly 
why the proposal has nothing on procedural protections for 
civil liberties, the chair said that it would be too difficult to come 
up with privacy standards, perhaps inadvertently admitting 
that the members of the panel knew very little about the 
subject. 
GILC and industry associations led by AT&T and the Interna- 
tional Chamber of Commerce have recently begun working 
together to oppose the convention. The companies are pri- 
marily concerned about the costs of redesigning systems and 
undertaking surveillance activities on behalf of governments. 
They also fear being held liable for the actions of their users 
or third parties. 
Whether this NGO/corporate alliance will manage to ove- 
rhaul or stop the treaty remains to be seen. Not only must they 
reverse years of secretive negotiations, but the unity of the 
groups has yet to be tested. Many companies sit on the oppo- 
site side of NGOs when dealing with the protection of consu- 
mers’ personal data. [|

### 122161: Shhh... they're listening

Shhh... they're listening 
The journalist who first uncovered Echelon, a major electronic spy 
network, reveals how international surveillance touches us all 
and international trade. Europe is focusing on 
“Echelon,” a system that relies on listening stations in 
about ten countries to intercept and process interna- 
tional satellite communications. Echelon is just one 
part of an immense network run by the U.S. and its 
English-speaking allies—Britain, Canada, Australia 
and New Zealand—known as UKUSA after a secret 
agreement that created the alliance in 1948. Little 
escapes the UKUSA network, which intercepts mes- 
sages from the Internet, undersea cables and radio 
transmissions as well as from monitoring equipment ins- 
talled in embassies. It even operates in space with a fleet 
of orbiting satellites. 
The history of systems like Echelon is as old as 
radio itself. The first international scandal over secret 
listening occurred in the 1920s, when the U.S. Senate 
discovered that British agents were copying every 
international telegram sent by American telegraph 
companies. Today’s international networks were 
founded in the early years of the Cold War, when 
many western countries began jointly monitoring the 
former Soviet Union. 
Fear not 
the word “bomb” 
Who is listened to, and why? Officially govern- 
ments only admit that surveillance is aimed at com- 
monly agreed perils such as arms proliferation, ter- 
rorism, drug trafficking and organized crime. But this 
is the tip of the iceberg. The main aim is to spy on other 
governments’ diplomatic messages and military plans 
while collecting information about trade. In fact, in 
1992, the U.S. re-adjusted its national intelligence 
priorities, specifying that 40 percent would be eco- 
nomic or “economic in nature,” according to Robert 
Gates, director of the Central Intelligence Agency at 
the time. International and non-governmental orga- 
nizations like Amnesty International and Greenpeace 
are also targets. 
While UKUSA is the world’s largest network, 
France, Germany and the Russian Federation have 
similar systems. On a smaller scale, so do countries in 
Scandinavia and the Middle East, including Israel, 
Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states. The budgets of all 
government sigint agencies probably add up to an 
annual expenditure of $20 billion, according to my cal- 
culations for a European Parliament report publi- 
shed last year. 
Despite the extraordinary scale of Echelon and 
its sister systems, the press has mistakenly reported 
that the network could intercept “all email, telephone, 
and fax communications.” Nor can it recognize the

KEEPING PRIVATE IN A WIRED WORLD 
 
content of every telephone call. And it is pure fiction 
that by typing key words like “bomb” in an email, you 
can trigger a tape recorder in some secret base. For 
every million messages or phone calls intercepted, less 
than 10 will be used for intelligence purposes. Most per- 
sonal communications are ignored except those of 
“important”individuals, like politicians, top business 
executives and their families. 
The UKUSA network, however, does have the 
power to access and process most of the world’s satel- 
lite communications and relay contents to client states. 
The system provides participating countries an enot- 
mous, unfair political advantage, since most developing 
nations cannot afford the expertise and equipment 
necessary to protect the privacy and security of their 
networks. 
Spying on the goverment 
for the people 
News about these systems began to leak out in the 
1970s as U.S. intelligence agencies came under scrutiny 
in the “Watergate” affair, when former president 
Richard Nixon used electronic bugging against his 
election opponents. Since then, an increasing number 
of whistleblowers have revealed the scale and effects 
of sigint spying. 
I first wrote about electronic spying by Britain in 
the 1970s. While completing a university degree in 
physics, I'd noted that the countryside was dotted 
with mysterious radio and satellite stations. In 1976, 1 
uncovered the British dimension to the activities of 
America’s National Security Agency (NSA), which 
had been revealed the previous year by Congres- 
sional enquiries. Officials were aghast that a sacred cow 
of eternal and indivisible secrecy had been slaughtered. 
Soon after the article’s publication, my American co- 
author was deported from Britain as a “threat to 
national security.” 
The government then arrested me, along with 
another journalist and our source. The authorities 
didn’t dare accuse us of espionage for a foreign 
country. Our “crime” was spying on the government 
for the people. Had the prosecution succeeded, we 
would have faced heavy jail sentences. 
Over the next 20 years, official secrecy relaxed as 
U.S. Congressional investigations notably turned the 
spotlight on sigint agencies. In Britain in the 1980s, a 
controversial ban on trade union membership at the 
Government Communications Headquarters 
(GCHQ) boomeranged by shifting attention on its 
spying activities. 
The growth of the public information culture on 
the Internet has taken these developments a step fur- 
ther. Now, even GCHQ and NSA have websites to 
reassure UKUSA citizens that they are not targets. No 
such safeguards apply to the rest of the world: these 
citizens are by default denied the right to privacy. The 
countries intercepting their communications are free 
to use the intelligence for whatever they wish. 
Such conduct violates the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights, as well as the European Convention

on Human Rights and the International Telecommu- 
nications Convention, which assures the privacy of 
international communications. Indeed sigint agencies 
trample over a long line of treaties. 
While individuals probably never know that they 
have been spied upon, their organizations and coun- 
tries may pay a high price for it. During trade nego- 
tiations, sigint agencies can sweep up the messages of 
a producer nation to discover their bottom line. Armed 
with such secret reports, the negotiators for the deve- 
loped world can force prices down to a minimum. 
Several governments have recently begun targeting 
environmental organizations or those protesting unfair 
world trade. 
Even when there are no direct adverse conse- 
quences, the mere existence of powerful surveillance 
systems can exercise a chilling effect on free speech, 
inhibiting political and cultural development. 
As these activities have become more contro- 
versial, the U.S. has tried to expand its circle of 
collaborators. Countries like Switzerland and 
Denmark are currently building new satellite stations 
to gather and trade spy data with the US. But, as the 
ongoing European Parliament inquiry indicates, public 
awareness and concern are growing fast. Yet vigilance 
is not enough: if countries and peoples are to have 
equal rights in the global information infrastructure, 
concerted action must quickly follow. |

rits may appear to be paragons of discretion 
but actually we're a nation of voyeurs and 
exhibitionists. For the past 25 years, the 
government and citizens have been instal- 
ling closed circuit television cameras 
(CCTV) in the most banal places: train stations, buses, 
airports, town centres and even telephone booths. We 
have hidden cameras in the changing rooms of shops 
and parade before men in uniform with cameras tucked 
inside their police helmets. 
George Orwell’s homeland has the most sur- 
veillance cameras per capita in the world: one for 
every 55 people, according to a recent study by the 
University of Hull. In 1995 almost 80 percent of the 
Home Office’s crime prevention budget went into 
funding new cameras. And the private sector now 
accounts for about 30 percent of the market, worth 
£150 million ($210 million) a year according to conser- 
vative estimates, and growing 15 to 20 percent annually. 
In the words of former Home Secretary Michael 
Howard, “CCTV catches criminals, spots crimes, iden- 
tifies lawbreakers and helps convict the guilty,” yet 
there has never been an official Home Office assess- 
ment of the cameras’ impact on crime rates. Only 
weeks ago, it emerged that the Scottish Parliament has 
no information on the number of convictions resulting 
from evidence gathered by CCTV. And yet, James

Satirist Mark Thomas uses the law to sidestep the UK's ubiquitous 
nology, reported in 1999 that the 32 cameras in 
Glasgow city centre had produced just one arrest 
every 40 days. 
Indeed the exponential growth of CCTV has been 
accompanied by rising crime rates and falling numbers 
of police on the streets. Crime rates doubled between 
1980 and 1990 and reached an all-time high last year 
at 5.22 million, with violent crimes rising eight percent 
nationally. On any one night in London, a city of 
seven million people, only 300 police officers are 
actually on patrol, according to the Police Federa- 
tion. 
Sketches, lies 
& videotape 
So let’s scratch the crime prevention argument 
and return to the original hypothesis: an obsession with 
surveillance for social control—which seems only fit- 
ting given that the British don’t have a legally ensh- 
rined right to privacy. But we do have data protection 
legislation, first introduced in 1984 and reinforced in 
March 2000, which gives citizens the right to see and 
correct personal information kept by anyone—govern- 
ment, company or fellow citizen. 
I work with Mark Thomas, who spends a lot of 
time in front of and behind cameras for the TV pro- 
gramme, “The Mark Thomas Product.” So in the spirit 
of public service, we have sought to uphold the new law. 
According to the guidelines, CCTV operators must

camera anywhere. Quite logically, we made our first 
stop at a security industry exhibition. Of about 200 exhi- 
bitors, we discovered that 127 had failed to register and 
were therefore breaking the law. We invited them to the 
exhibitions cyber café to register online. Most declined 
and we were soon ejected from the conference but not 
before the organizers had drafted a letter to all exhi- 
bitors, notifying them of their legal obligations. 
We then stumbled upon an interesting phrase in 
the act: “the same legally enforceable information- 
handling standards as have previously applied to those 
processing personal data on computer now cover 
CCTV.” Translation: any identifiable individual filmed 
by a camera now has the right to obtain a copy of those 
images. This is a satirist’s dream. If we are to be filmed 
half our lives, then we want the footage for a 40-year 
long out-of-home video. Perhaps this is the real reason 
for the new law: why else would it stipulate that ope- 
rators put their contact information on each camera? 
This took us to our next stop, Britain’s privatized 
and chaotic railways. We figured that a lot of people 
were getting into trouble for being late to work. So we 
found several harassed commuters eager to act as 
guinea pigs by standing under their local station’s 
cameras holding a half-metre high clock. All it took 
was a quick letter of request and each commuter 
received a personal video, courtesy of Railtrack, to 
prove to their bosses that they weren’t the culprits— 
the company was. 
The real surprise came while testing the latest 
CCTV hi-tech wizardry. Newham Council in London 
has spent £2 million ($2.8 million) on computerized 
cameras to automatically recognize certain vehicle 
number plates and identify known villains with facial 
mapping software. We sent six traditional English 
folk dancers, donning garters and bells, to do the 
“rattlebone” and “ploughjack” through the streets of 
the housing estate. Shortly after our visit, we received 
a letter explaining that the council couldn’t release our 
footage since “it has not been possible for us to extra- 
polate your images from those of unknown third par- 
ties.” 
Announcing the world’s first 
international CCTV competition 
We had a major dilemma: had taxpayers’ money 
been used for faulty equipment, or was something 
else going on? We happened to be outside a Ford 
Motor Company plant when a few union people dis- 
tributing leaflets about a forthcoming strike ballot 
were suddenly threatened by employees. Ford com- 
plied with our request for the CCTV footage of the 
incident. But aside from a riveting view of the nearby 
car park, there was no sign of life. Another round of 
technical problems? 
All of which leads us to the following conclusion: 
CCTV’s potential lies in the entertainment field. As a 
result,we’ve launched a competition for the best foo- 
tage obtained through data protection laws. None 
other than Jonathan Ross, the BBC's film critic, will 
judge the results. And perhaps most importantly, I 
hereby formally announce the creation of the new 
category, “Best International Picture.” Any CCTV 
footage will qualify, edited or uncut, from countries 
with or without appropriate legislation. Please send 
your tapes marked “CCTV Competition” to Vera

that “we’re not against all forms of co-operation. We'd be 
willing to go along in specific cases, but not systematically. 
For example, if the FSB brought us court documents pro- 
  
government decided to take a close 
interest in Russia's three million Internet 
users. By passing a resolution setting up 
SORM 2, (an acronym for a system of 
operative investigation measures), the 
secret services and the State Telecom- 
munications Committee extended SORM 
1 to the Internet. Since 1995, that system 
has allowed the Federal Security Bureau, 
the KGB's successor, to eavesdrop on tra- 
ditional communications (telephones, 
telex, fax and so on), as long as it had a 
warrant. 
So far, a single man has dared to challenge SORM 2. Nail Mur- 
zakhanov, 34, is the chairman of Bayard-Slaviya Communi- 
cations (BSK), an Internet access provider based in Volgograd 
(1,500 kilometres south of Moscow). “When the FSB agents

says. “My team and | went through the document with a fine- 
ving that an individual is suspected of tax 
evasion or pedophilia, we could coope- 
rate. But that has never happened.” 
Cut to the quick, the ministry of com- 
munications threatened to take away 
the rebellious provider's license. But in 
January 2000, Murzakhanov sued. The 
court has met three times. Each time the 
session was adjourned because the 
ministry's representatives failed to show 
up. The case dragged on. Then, in 
August, Murzakhanov received a letter 
from the minister himself, who with- 
drew his threat to take away BSK's license. “There was no 
longer a need to maintain our lawsuit,” the young busi- 
nessman says, frustrated at seeing the Russian government 
get off the hook so easily. [|

a band of youth in the streets of Bel- 
pe ugoslavia’s capital city. Defeated 
in the presidential election on September 
24,2000, Slobodan Milosevic—Slobo for 
short—kept clinging to power. On 
October 5,the dictator fell. 
Opposition parties, international 
pressure and mass demonstrations contri- 
buted to Milosevic’s doomsday. So did 
Otpor (“Resistance” in Serb), whose 
story is unique in the annals of eastern 
European protest movements. Without 
leaders or a clear cut political ideology, 
the group played a decisive role: like a 
termite colony, Otpor gnawed away at 
the regime’s foundations before the top 
realized that the whole edifice was roc- 
king. 
Founded by a handful of libertarians 
in October 1998, Otpor counted 
4,000 members by the end of 1999, a 
number that has swelled to 100,000 today. 
The overwhelming majority can’t even 
remember when the movement was born.

most stylish pedestrian thoroughfare, 
where anti-NATO demonstrators sacked 
the French, British, German and Ame-

1999 bombing campaign. Otpor squatted 
an old, run-down Belgrade university 
annex there. In this tiny beehive of acti- 
vity, covered with stencils of the resis- 
tance movement’s famous black fist and

initiatives were hatched that brought a 
13-year-old mafia-ridden political system 
to its knees. 
Sofia,Ana, Milos and Mihailo are bet- 
ween 17 and 24 years old. When a western 
journalist arrives, many of their friends in 
the office join in the discussion held in a 
small, narrow room. Soon the tiny desk is 
cluttered with cups of Turkish coffee. 
Everyone serves each other and trades 
cigarettes in a good-natured atmosphere. 
The first observation is that all those pre- 
sent come from the same social back- 
ground. Like most Serbs, their parents 
get by on $40 to $80 a month, working 
occasional odd jobs Their grandparents, 
who still live in the countryside, send a 
little food to help out. 
It doesn’t take long for the conver- 
sation to switch to recent history. In 1989, 
nationalism of all stripes was tearing the 
Yugoslav federation apart. In June 1991, 
war broke out in Slovenia, spreading like 
wildfire to Croatia and, in spring 1992, to 
Bosnia. The Yugoslav army was made 
up of draftees, and an entire age group 
was mobilized.By the end of 1991,Bel- 
grade’s youth were in the streets, and the 
police brutally cracked down on the pro- 
tests. Otpor’s young activists only have 
vague memories of these events Barely 
10 years old at the time, they were living 
in a climate of war, deprivation and impo- 
verishment. 
On November 17, 1996, Slobodan 
Milosevic lost the municipal elections 
and annulled them. Tens of thousands of 
Serbs took to the streets in Belgrade and

other cities. Students, who spearheaded 
the protests, demanded that the results be 
recognized. Eventually, after three 
months, Milosevic made concessions and 
the movement ran out of steam. 
Recruiting the 
disenchanted 
Sofia Jarkovic, 17,is in her penulti- 
mate year at a Belgrade high school. 
She took part in these demonstrations 
alongside her parents. Their failure made 
a lasting impression on her, and on 
March 20,2000 she joined Otpor, whose 
sole aim was Milosevic’s overthrow. Ana 
Vuksanovic, 24,who is working on her 
master’s degree in French literature, 
participated in every day of the 1996-97 
protest marches .“The problem was, we 
had set our sights too low,” she says. 
“We were demanding recognition of the 
voting results, when in fact we should 
have been demonstrating for new muni- 
cipal, legislative and presidential elec- 
tions, under the supervision of interna- 
tional observers. Like many people, | 
took this failure hard. That’s why I joined 
Otpor as soon as it was founded two 
years later.” 
The movement got off to a quiet start 
outside Serbia’s mainstream opposition. 
Milosevic had managed to corrupt 
several opposition municipalities while 
students had become disgruntled with 
politicking and established parties. The 
leaders of the 1996-97 movement went 
into exile, as many deserters and draft 
dodgers had done during the 1991-1995

wars. Soon, they were joined by deserters 
from the Kosovo war (March-June 1999). 
In less than ten years, several hundred 
thousand Serbs became expatriates. And 
most of them were the elite of pro-demo- 
cratic youth. 
The next generation found itself iso- 
lated. They had to come up with their 
own methods of struggle, forge their own 
experience, and above all, avoid selling 
out. These teenagers had political 
acumen, but more than anything else, 
intuition. And they wanted to stop a 
regime that was stealing the fire of their 
youth. 
Armed with their impetuousness, 
they managed to shake their parents and 
grandparents out of lethargy. Adults 
started feeling ashamed of their apathy. 
Rather than stir up revolt in army bar- 
racks and corridors, they preferred to 
convince the people around them. Police 
manuals had no chapters on how to stifle

the awakening of civil society. Meanw- 
hile, Milosevic, shut up in his ivory tower, 
was incapable of sensing the agitation 
that was about to sweep him off the stage. 
One of Otpor’s greatest strengths lay 
in its absence of hierarchy, a rule of 
thumb for a movement grounded in 
joyous anarchy. It’s a free-wheeling, any- 
thing-goes protest movement. “I showed 
up at their headquarters on March 20, 
2000,” recalls Sofia Jarkovic. “I was a 
little scared. I opened the door and said, 
‘Hi, my name is Sofia and I want to be an 
activist.’ They handed me a membership 
form. I filled it out and left. Two weeks 
later, they called me up, gave me an 
appointment and I joined.” Milos Stan- 
kovic, 17,is in his penultimate year at a 
Belgrade high school and has belonged to 
Otpor since February, 2000. “I joined 
Otpor because it was against political 
parties,” he says. “I wanted to help change 
things, because I couldn’t stand seeing 
people dealing with so many problems in

their day-to-day lives anymore.” Ana 
Vuksanovic adds, “What got me excited 
was that there weren’t any leaders, so 
there was no risk of being betrayed.” 
Within a year, the movement took 
root in four Belgrade universities, mostly 
with first and second-year students. The 
hard core consisted of three small groups: 
Democratic Students, the Students’ 
Union and the Students’ Federation. 
Otpor forged relationships with Neza- 
visnost (Independence), Serbia’s only 
free trade union, as well as with the 
defence workers’ union and the pensio- 
ners’ organization. There were no ulterior 
political motives for these choices. It was 
just that the kids had parents in these 
organizations. That’s vintage Otpor. 
Sowing revolt 
in the family 
Milosevic took a harder line after 
losing Kosovo in June 1999, but graffiti 
calling for “Resistance until Victory” 
began flourishing on walls. Slogans were 
increasingly disrespectful and, therefore, 
incomprehensible for rank-and-file mili- 
tiamen and their leaders (see box). Some 
100,000 copies of the newsletter Serb 
Resistance were secretly circulating. 
During school vacations, university stu- 
dents, joined by many high school and 
even junior high school students sowed 
the seeds of revolt in their families, neigh- 
bourhoods and villages. Otpor infiltrated 
the provinces. The democratic termites 
were at work. 
They scored a major success when 
they went after the sacrosanct Yugoslav 
army. Activists held demonstrations in 
front of military tribunals every time a

deserter went on trial. Adults, who had 
lost so many children on the Croatian 
and Bosnian fronts, could only be deeply 
moved. Otpor was changing mentalities. 
The teens struck a painful nerve, without 
ever resorting to violence. The police 
were baffled by this type of protest move- 
ment. In one year, they arrested 60 
people for spraying graffiti or wearing 
badges with the black fist,but balked at 
beating up the kids, who were the same 
age as their own children. 
Sofia took part in her first street 
demonstrations in April 2000: “One day, 
a policeman tore off my badge. But he 
didn’t dare arrest me.” Ana and her boy- 
friend,Branko, were expelled from their 
university dorm rooms for protesting, 
and her parents were summoned to the 
police station. 
  
        
“We started from nil.” 
In July 2000, Milosevic laid the 
groundwork for a constitutional coup 
d’état and announced a presidential elec- 
tion for September 24. The divided oppo- 
sition managed to cobble together an 18- 
party coalition, the DOS (Democratic 
Opposition of Serbia).At the first mee- 
ting, Otpor representatives solemnly 
offered their black flag with a white fist. 
They were not joining, but warning: 
Otpor will keep an eye on you until the 
final victory. No more wheeling and dea- 
ling. 
The Otpor wave had risen.“I wasn’t 
old enough to vote on September 24,” 
says Sofia. “My parents were against 
Milosevic. My mother, Mira, wanted to 
vote for the DOS, but my father, Dragan, 
thought of abstaining. I talked him into 
voting.” 
The defeated dictator annulled the 
election results. The wave swelled, cove- 
ring the whole country with the same 
graffiti:“He’s finished ”and “Slobo, save 
Serbia: kill yourself!” Provincial opposi- 
tion municipalities, the DOS, trade unio- 
nists and veterans started talking to 
Otpor. 
40 The Unesco Courier - March 2001 
On October 5, all of them were ready. 
“That day, I dragged my father to the 
parliament building at 2:30 in the after- 
noon,” recalls Milos. “I joined Otpor in 
front of the philosophy department at 
the university,” says Sofia. “We stayed 
there until three o’clock before conver- 
ging on the parliament. I was always 
afraid of the crowd the whole time.” Ana 
adds, “With four boys, I was part of an 
Otpor group in touch with the DOS. Our 
job was to call on Belgrade’s citizens to 
come out into the streets. We were among 
the first wave of protesters who occu- 
pied the B92 radio station, which the 
government had taken over. I couldn’t 
sleep several nights in a row. I was afraid 
the government would launch a counter- 
attack.” 
Otpor could have disbanded on 
October 6, but, mistrustful of politicians, 
the movement decided to stay alert and 
uncompromising until democracy is firmly 
established. Mihajlo Cvekic, 18, is in his 
last year at Belgrade’s vocational school, 
where his major is tourism. He became a 
member of Otpor on October 8 “because 
of their decisive role on October 5,” he 
explains. “Before then, I didn’t dare join 
because I was afraid of retaliation, but 
also because of my parents and grandpa- 
rents, who were hard-core Milosevic sup- 
porters. Today, they feel ashamed.” The 
teenagers have quietly instilled demo- 
cratic aspirations into the minds of family 
members corrupted by nationalism.

“The year 2000 will be the one” 
could be read on walls everyw-

invented a new resistance mea-

meter.” After the September 24 
elections, the famous “Gotov je” 
  
(“He's cooked”) became the 
slogan spray-painted most on walls, staircases and in bar restrooms. On 5 
October 5, when a bulldozer broke down the door of the state radio and 
television headquarters, the government's main propaganda mouth- 
piece, Otpor printed posters and calendars with the slogan, “A bulldozer 
operator is asleep in all of us.” Leery of all politicians, even if they belong 
to the opposition, Otpor’s new slogan is, “We're keeping an eye on you.” 
tpor became famous because of its favourite weapon: caustic slo- 
gans spray-painted on the walls of Serbia’s cities. The first, when 
nobody had heard of them yet, was the clearest and simplest, a kind of 
birth certificate: “Resistance until Victory.” In December 1999, Otpor

### 122165: Pirates and the paper chase

Pirates and the paper chase 
Book piracy is a thriving trade in poor nations, sometimes raking in bigger profits 
than the real thing. In Spanish-speaking countries, publishers and governments are 
stepping up their campaign to stop the scourge

reprinted every year in Latin America, 
ranging from photocopies to the repro- 
duction of entire books. The annual tur- 
nover of the legal publishing industry in 
Latin America and Spain is about $5 
billion a year, compared with the $8 bil- 
lion of the pirate sector. This means a 
loss of about $500 million in royalties 
every year. 
Carmen Barvo, a Colombian publi- 
shing consultant and leading expert on 
the subject, cites a particularly blatant 
case. “Even the book Checkmate written 
by Rosso José Serrano, Colombia’s 
national police chief and a model officer 
for the whole country, was pirated and 
sold in the streets, proving that criminals 
don’t care who the author is.” 
Pirated books these days are such 
good copies of the original that they 
are sometimes hard to detect, even by 
the authors and publishers themselves. 
Not only is the text copied, but also the 
design, the cover, the colour and the 
bar code. Pirated Argentine books made 
in Colombia or Brazil are ironically 
marked “printed in Argentina” while 
those in Chile shamelessly carry the 
warning that “reproduction is for- 
bidden.” Loaded into trucks and vans, 
they are exported from one country to 
the next, even making it to the display 
windows of genuine bookshops—per- 
haps innocently, perhaps not. 
New technologies 
speed up the task 
Those who support book piracy, by 
buying the forged copies for example, 
argue that the original versions are too 
expensive. As Barvo notes, the issue has 
to be seen in a social context. “Selling a 
pirated book is part of a vendor’s daily 
bread. Today he may be selling books at 
traffic lights, but tomorrow it might be 
cigarettes, paper handkerchiefs or 
Barbie dolls. I don’t regard him as the 
guilty party—that honour belongs to 
the person who produces the book and 
violates the rights of the author and »

publisher.” 
New technologies clearly make it 
much easier—and much cheaper—to 
pirate books. “Technically speaking, you 
can do it all these days,” says the owner 
of a legal Paris printing works. “To copy 
a book, all you need is two copies of 
the original, a scanner, a computer with 
an optical recognition programme, some 
ink, paper, a small rotary press and a 
binding machine.” With all this and a 
place to operate the printing press, a 
pirated book can be produced in two or 
three days. 
Resorting to police 
raids and law suits 
Attempts to fight book piracy 
through technology appear to have 
failed. All that is left are the weapons of 
police raids and the law, both of which 
are exploited to the full by bodies such 
as the Regional Centre for Book Pro- 
motion in Latin America and the Carib- 
bean in Bogota and the Spanish Centre 
for Reproduction Rights in Madrid. 
The strategy depends largely on 
legal action, says Manuel José Sar- 
miento,sub-director for anti-piracy and 
illegal reproduction at the Colombian 
Chamber of Books. “Since 1997, the 
Chamber, the publishers and the 
ministry of culture have stepped up 
their efforts, ranging from police raids 
to publicity campaigns in the press and 
on television.” By January 2001, a total 
of 139 lawsuits had been successful in 
Colombia’s courts, leading to the clo- 
sure of places where pirated books 
were being produced, distributed or 
sold. 
In Peru,on the other hand,pirated 
books continue to flourish,and publi- 
shers are denouncing the government’s 
failure to act. German Coronado, head 
of the Peisa publishing house, says the 
country has “quite progressive legisla- 
tion protecting intellectual property in 
accordance with international stan- 
dards. Our 1996 intellectual property 
law punishes illegal copying with up to 
eight years’ imprisonment and clearly 
supports authors by giving their heirs 
the right to receive royalties for up to 
70years after an author’s death. 
“All this sounds wonderful and Per- 
uvian technocrats turn up at interna- 
tional meetings to boast about it. But 
the law isn’t worth the paper it’s written 
on. The pirates have a bigger turnover 
42 The Unesco Courier - March 2001 
now than the legal sector, and we reckon 
they sell nearly three times more books 
than we do.” 
Calls for lower sales tax 
and quality paperbacks 
In Argentina, which has a strong 
publishing industry and the best book- 
shops in the region, “it’s mainly tech- 
nical and self-help books that are 
pirated,” says Ana Cabanellas head of 
the Heliasta publishing house, some of 
whose books have been copied. “It’s 
very painful, like being raped. The 
pirates are very clever and however 
much we try, they always manage to 
make copies. Each year I publish a Basic 
Legal Dictionary written by my father, 
Guillermo Cabanellas, and we change 
the colour of the cover each time. Even 
that doesn’t stop them.” 
As well as cracking down, publi- 
shers could make an effort to put out 
high-quality works in pocket editions, 
an area in which Spanish-language 
publishers lag far behind. 
Governments could also help to 
boost the legal book sector by lowe- 
ring the sales tax,which is one of the 
highest in the world (18 percent in 
Chile), or by building networks of 
public libraries where all Latin Ame- 
ricans can have free access to their 
favourite authors. 
The task is huge, but so is the deter- 
mination of some. “We're going to 
stamp out book pirating,” says Sar- 
miento. “It’s almost a personal thing 
for me. We'll get there.” [|

A: is another continent afflicted by book piracy. In India, where the 
country’s 11,000 publishers put out more than 57,000 new titles a year, 
an education ministry survey pinpoints three kinds of forgery. The most 
common is copying a book and selling bogus versions—the Indian writer 
Arundhati Roy and her book The God of Small Things is one of the most recent 
victims. Another more laborious method is to print books ostensibly by 
famous authors but in fact written by clumsy imitators. A craftier way is to 
sell foreign books that have been translated illegally, without any formal 
contract. The famous young sorcerer’s apprentice, Harry Potter, had just 
such an unfortunate experience in China. A few days before the legally- 
translated version of one tome came out, a version translated in Taiwan 
was selling on the streets. The state company publishing the book then 
printed the genuine version with green pages to distinguish it from the 
bogus one. [|

Escobar, a deputy judge of the Second 
Criminal Court, the collection marked 
the biggest defeat yet for the country’s 
pirate book industry. 
But these impounded books only 
created a new problem: what should be 
done with them? Judge Escobar took 
the initiative, ordering that they be dis- 
tributed to the city’s poorest neighbou- 
rhoods and other parts of the country. 
“I did so because a judge is free to 
decide what happens to seized items, 
and if they'd stayed under court control, 
their condition could have deteriorated,” 
he explained.“Our country is poor and 
there’s an urgent need for our children 
to read. That's why I think burning 
books is an outrage.” 
Just a bargain or the only 
road to reading? 
The judge’s decision sparked very 
different reactions. Most people thought 
it was a good idea. Some authors, such as 
journalist Patricia Verdugo—whose 
many books investigating the Pinochet 
dictatorship have been widely pirated— 
thought the judge was wrong. “What 
right does he have to give away things 
that don’t belong to him?”’she asked in 
an interview with the daily newspaper 
La Tercera.“ These books should be des- 
troyed, just like confiscated drugs are 
destroyed.”

### 122166: Chile: a judge steps in

PIRATES AND THE PAPER CHASE 
Chile: a judge steps In 
Are illegally copied books like forged banknotes and should they be destroyed? 
Judges, authors and publishers in Chile are all taking a stand in a heated debate 
lier, a popular Chilean author translated 
into several languages, does not agree. 
Pirated books, he argues, are a way to 
reach more readers. “I'm not siding with 
the pirates but with the readers,” he says. 
“The people who buy one of my books 
in the street aren’t the same as those 
who’d buy it in a bookshop. They're less 
well-off and can’t afford the official 
prices.” Not true, replies Bartolo Ortiz, 
general manager of the Planeta en Chile 
publishing house. “I’ve seen very ele- 
gant-looking people buying books on 
the street. I think reading is just less 
important for them compared to other 
things.” 
Whichever stance is adopted, one

fact is certain: the publishers are going to 
appeal Escobar’s decision. 
During the year 2000, a total of 
308,000 pirated copies of 400 books put 
out by various publishers were seized in 
Chile. “We reckon we lost $25 million 
last year,” says Eduardo Castillo, presi- 
dent of the Chilean Book Association. 
“This country is top of the league in 
terms of pirated books.” 
The publication of pirated books in 
Chile grew out of the need for under- 
cover political activity. During the 1973- 
89 military dictatorship, for example, 
the Chilean Communist Party publi- 
shed Che Guevara's diaries and other 
banned material. Various people 
recently interviewed in the book 
industry insist that certain unnamed 
employees of lawful publishing firms 
themselves deal out original copies of 
books to the forgers, obviously in return 
for money. 
Bringing the government 
to heel 
Castillo disagrees, noting that publi- 
shers have joined together to investi- 
gate, file lawsuits and gather evidence in 
an effort to punish the guilty. Pedro 
Bosch, a lawyer who works for Editorial 
Sudamericana, says that in two years of 
investigations, the firm has filed 60 com- 
plaints resulting in charges against 
200 people, 50 trials and the seizure of 
over 30,000 books. “In this way we’ve 
been able to find out who the pirates 
are, build a database and curb the 
damage being done,” he says. “But the 
market isn’t going to go away.” 
Authors, publishers, booksellers and 
judges at least agree that the govern- 
ment has so far paid little interest in 
taking a firm stand against book piracy. 
They nevertheless hope an imminent 
report commissioned by Chilean Presi- 
dent Ricardo Lagos from the Book 
Association may change all that. 
Meanwhile, on a corner of Santiago’s 
busy Avenida Providencia, a street 
vendor asks his assistant to fetch some 
more Harry Potter books. She goes off to 
get them from her makeshift storeroom, 
hidden behind an ice-cream cart.I was 
interested in one book and asked the 
price. It was $6, less than a third of the 
price in a bookshop. She said she sold 
between $35 and $55 worth of books 
each day. 
The average monthly salary of most 
Chileans is about $625.1 told the vendor 
it was a pirated version of the book. She 
nodded and asked me: “Are you going to 
buy it?” [|

the midst of World War I. Nearly a cen-

still remains the first casualty, buried 
under layers of propaganda, vested inter-

From Africa to East Timor, from Kashmir 
and Sri Lanka to the killing fields of 
Chechnya, Bosnia,Colombia and Sierra 
Leone, old ethnic hatred is rekindled, and 
wars are fought not on battlefronts but in 
the midst of civilian populations. Accor- 
ding to Robert Manoff, director of New 
York University’s Center for War, Peace, 
and the News Media, mass violence is so 
“universalized” that there are currently 
over 200 communal groups fighting poli- 
tical and military wars in 93 countries. 
The media’s role remains essentially 
to act as a messenger. Yet journalists also

“The outcomes of these small, post-

National Public Radio. Gjelten,who has

Do the exigencies of war justify a dif- 
ferent set of ethics from those of peace- 
time? The principles are essentially the 
same, but for one major difference: jour- 
nalists are more vulnerable in war. In 
Sierra Leone, East Timor and Chechnya, 
the bulletproof jackets that Western jour- 
nalists donned provided little protection 
from the wrath of a killer squad or a vin- 
a TS 
dictive soldier’s bullet. For local journa- 
lists, the terrors are even starker. Yves 
Sorokobi, who coordinates the Africa 
programme for the Committee to Pro- 
tect Journalists, recounts that ten repor- 
ters were executed by rebels in Sierra 
Leone over 21 days in 1999 (see box). 
Reporting is also hampered by

government restrictions on access to 
trouble spots. Since 1995, hardly any jour- 
nalists in Sri Lanka have had access to the 
area where the government is fighting a 
deadly battle with the separatist guer- 
rilla group, the Liberation of Tamil Tigers’ 
Eelam.“We don’t get anywhere close to 
the conflict,” says Nirupama Subrama- 
nian, special correspondent of The Hindu 
in Colombo. Instead, both sides transmit 
their version of the news via contradictory 
press releases. “It is a fax war we are cove- 
ring,” Subramanian says. “There’s no way 
of knowing the truth.” 
The proliferation of real-time news 
has made political control even tighter. 
Journalists often find they have little trai- 
ning for the choices they are forced to 
make in tense situations. When two coun- 
tries are at war, whose “truth” should the 
correspondent convey—that of the 
  
country to which the journalist belongs or 
that of the enemy, whose version might be 
more compelling? For the writer and war 
correspondent John Pilger, it is exactly 
this “virulence of an unrecognized cen- 
sorship, often concealed behind false prin- 
ciples of objectivity” that serves to “mini- 
mize and deny the culpability of Western 
power in acts of great violence and ter- 
rorism,such as the Gulf and Kosovo.” 
Powerless observers 
of unfolding dramas? 
War reporting has nevertheless come 
a long way since the two world wars, when 
most journalism was an uncritical arm of 
the war effort. Twenty years later, govern- 
ments learnt from Vietnam that unres- 
tricted access to war zones, particularly 
with the advent of television,was poten- 
tial political suicide. In his classic book 
The First Casualty, Phillip Knightley 
concludes that the freedom journalists 
had to operate in Vietnam “to go anyw- 
here, see anything, and write what they 
liked is not going to be given again.” 
“In a democracy, you cannot get away 
with the crude authoritarianism of clo- 
sing down newspapers or taking over 
broadcasters,” writes 
Steven Barnett, senior lec- 
turer in communications 
at the University of West- 
minster, reviewing Knight- 
ley’s book. “You can, 
however, have a subtle 
mixture of information 
control, drip-feed propa- 
ganda stories about the 
enemy, cosy briefings for 
‘friendly’ journalists and 
more blatant attempts at 
intimidation for the less 
obliging.” 
The British devised an 
excellent strategy to 
manage the media during 
the Falklands war in 
1982—they denied access, 
except to “friendly” jour- 
nalists willing to report 
defence briefings. 
The Gulf War was the 
first in history where the 
public expected regular 
reporting from an 
“enemy” capital under 
siege. Fought mostly from 
the air, with attacks deep within enemy 
territory, it was impossible for interna- 
tional journalists to verify military infor- 
mation or report on Iraqi casualties. It 
was only later that the deceptions were 
exposed, whether it was Iraqis flinging 
premature Kuwaiti babies out of incuba- 
tors (which turned out to be the work of

an American public relations agency com- 
missioned by the Kuwaiti government), or 
the filmed preparations for an allied lan- 
ding on the Kuwaiti coast, which was 
never part of the military plan. 
During the NATO bombing of Serbia 
in 1999, the press was actively used to 
drum up public support. The pitfalls of 
instant news became all too obvious during 
the conflict. With 2,700 media personnel in 
the region when NATO entered Kosovo 
(compared with 500 in Vietnam at the 
war’s peak), the war could have produced 
unprecedented free and fair reporting. 
But instead, the story behind the sound 
bytes was missing. “The public drowned in 
wave after wave of images that added up 
to nothing,” writes Knightley. 
Above all the clamour, however, 
several war correspondents have worked 
at great risk. John Burns of the New York 
Times, a Pulitzer Prize winner, spent more 
than a year in besieged Sarajevo, sharing 
many nights of terror with the local people 
to tell the world what was really going 
on. For such journalists, objectivity may 
have little to do with neutrality, especially 
when the choice is between hapless vic-

tims and perpetrators of genocidal crimes. 
For many reporters, the greatest 
dilemma comes down to how involved 
they should get. Often, journalists are 
overwhelmed by fear and helplessness, 
but are still called upon to provide the 
only link between a war-afflicted people 
and the outside world. “I couldn’t stop the 
smallest part of it,” recalled Lindsey 
Hilsum of the British news service ITN 
about reporting the massacres of Tutsis in 
Rwanda in 1994. “I could only watch and 
survive.” Yet Hilsum decided to testify 
before the International Criminal Tri- 
bunal for Rwanda. “It was not my res- 
ponsibility, and testifying could even have 
compromised my role as a journalist,”

she explained. “But I also have responsi-

Courses at journalism school and pro- 
fessional guidelines drawn up by media 
organizations like the Freedom Forum 
are widening the debate on professiona- 
lism in war reporting, though most agree 
that the basic qualities needed are inte- 
grity and a good dose of common sense. 
Anthony Borden, executive director of 
the Institute of War and Peace Reporting 
in London, stresses the importance of 
engaging and valuing the work of local 
journalists, especially at a time when com- 
mercial pressures threaten the continued 
coverage of conflicts in regions not per- 
ceived to have strategic importance. 
Given all the dangers, why do journa- 
lists choose to cover certain conflicts? It is 
unlikely they do it for fame or fortune, or 
as some people believe, for the thrill of it.

In 1995, when the historic town of Charar-e-Sharif in the Kashmir valley 
was burnt to a cinder, army officials escorted busloads of visiting foreign 
and Indian journalists to see the devastation. To prove it was the work of 
mercenaries from Pakistan, reporters were guided to a courtyard to photo- 
graph five corpses they claimed were “foreign” mercenaries killed in a gun- 
battle with the army. 
Journalists who returned to the site after the “guided tour” discovered that 
the bodies were not “foreign” at all. Five men from a nearby village had 
been arrested that morning and killed to serve the government's propa- 
ganda machine. Almost every Indian newspaper carried the photograph of 
the “dreaded Afghan mercenaries.” Only one foreign news magazine publi- 
shed photographs of the anguished villagers grieving their dead that day.

### 122168: Reporting from death row

  
JIA KANGBAI*: REPORTING FROM DEATH ROW 
Ginee it began in 1991, Sierra Leone's conflict between 
rebels and the government has claimed close to 30,000 
lives while mutilating 120,000. Outside the warring fac- 
tions, no group has been more targeted than journalists. 
Reporting involves a constant face-to-face meeting with 
death, kidnappings, torture and even long detention 
without trial. 
Every Sierra Leonean journalist has a horror tale to tell of 
his or her experience in the field. | received my war bap- 
tism in 1995 while heading for the southern town of Bo to 
investigate alleged collaboration between government 
forces and Revolutionary United Front rebels. Barely an 
hour into the journey the convoy of more than 100 vehicles 
ran into an ambush. That was the closest call to death | 
have ever had. More than 75 vehicles lay in ruins and 36 
people were killed. Those of us who survived were forced 
to tote the rebels’ loot back to their base. 
Many have not gotten off so lightly. Mustapha Sesay, who 
used to work for the Standard Times, had his left eye perma- 
nently damaged by a machete while trying to flee the 
rebel invasion of the capital, Freetown, in 1999. The inva- 
ding troops killed Sesay’s deputy editor, Paul Mansaray, and 
his entire family in front of their home. Rebels went on to 
set the paper's offices ablaze and destroy five other news- 
paper offices. Both parties to the conflict, meanwhile, 
conducted house-to-house searches for blacklisted jour- 
nalists, raising the question of whether it is necessary to 
prostrate one’s life at the abattoir table for an objective 
report in a war like ours. 
Objective reporting was constantly on the mind of Corinne 
Dufka, a researcher with Human Rights Watch, during a 
visit to Freetown last year. “Don’t the authorities know 
that you journalists are required to have every side of the 
story including that of the rebels?” Ms. Dufka asked while 
discussing the fate of a local journalist, Abdoul Kouyateh, 
who was detained for six months for having links with the 
rebels. 
There is no official rebel-run newspaper in the country, and 
a balanced or critical article written about either of the two 
stakeholders (government and rebels) in the peace process 
is invariably interpreted as partisan reporting. Write an opi- 
nion piece or editorial lampooning the government for not 
honouring its side of the 1999 Lome peace deal and people 
will brand you a rebel. Give me a local newspaper, and | 
will tell you which government minister or official financed 
its publication. 
In times of “peace,” what you write and say in your report 
will be the bullet that kills you when the war intensifies. 
Most local journalists, especially those in the print media, 
have unfortunately contributed to this deplorable state of 
affairs. 
In October last year, the pro-government Kamajor militia 
abducted and tortured me for three days. The whole epi- 
sode was the machination of the country’s defence chief 
and militia head, Sam Hinga Norman, who four days 
before my abduction had tried to bribe us into dropping 
a story of a clash between his militia and the army. A col- 
league of mine, who doubled as a militia informer, had 
leaked the story to his patrons. 
We are now fearing a possible attack from the Kamajors, 
whose head we recently lambasted for alleged corruption. 
I have yet to see a local court which could pass a guilty ver- 
dict on the militia or security apparatus. 
The few journalists who dare to file stories from this death row 
should be encouraged and highly appreciated. But they need 
to understand that no matter how important a story is, it is use- 
less to risk their lives for it: war reporting is for the living, not 
for the dead. u

Spojmai Zariab:

The Afghan writer Spojmai Zariab is haunted by bitter memories and deeply 
apprehensive about her people’s future. Exiled in France, she tirelessly 
denounces the wars that have laid waste to her country, without ever losing 
hope. Each of her short stories rings like a verdict against the regime of terror 
imposed upon her compatriots, and against the humiliations inflicted upon 
around the world, translated into Per- 
sian. We lived free and fulfilling lives. 
We could hold public meetings, speak 
openly and set up political parties. 
Afghanistan achieved a kind of poli- 
tical and social stability after a long 
and turbulent history. 
But this short period of great hopes 
came to a sudden end in 1973 with the 
coup d’état of Mohammed Daoud, 
which paved the way for communist 
rule and later the arrival of the Red 
Army.

Your short story, “Boots of Delirium,” 
describes the Soviet invasion. 
The narrator is a dying woman who 
witnesses Soviet tanks arriving in her 
village. She has one obsession: to keep 
the gate to her house firmly shut.But 
the soldiers break it and come in. The 
image represents the outright viola- 
tion of a country. 
The young woman suffering from 
head injuries, becomes delirious. She 
wanders through the country in her 
imagination. Instead of bunches of 
grapes hanging from vines, she sees 
arms, legs and heads. The cows no 
longer give milk but blood. In the 
town,she approaches a group of chil- 
dren but sees they're wearing huge 
muddy boots like the soldiers. Their 
eyes have turned to stone pebbles, 
expressionless and inhuman. They 
stand for the lost youth of my country, 
young people turned into instruments 
of war. 
In another short story, “Identity Card,” 
you describe a teenager whose mother 
hides him for fear he'll be drafted into 
the army. 
This story symbolizes the future of 
the country, which was subjected to a 
totally fabricated war. The two great 
powers of the time [the Soviet Union 
and the United States] made the 
country a battleground for their Cold 
War. The Afghans were just cannon 
fodder. Their trust was betrayed and 
their rage against the invader cynically 
manipulated. They became tools of 
ideologies that didn’t serve their coun- 
try’s interests. This fratricidal war conti- 
nues today and has taken on wider 
dimensions of ethnicity and language. 
Did the Afghans have a choice other 
than siding with one of these camps? 
Unfortunately those extremes 
were the only choice. But most 
people, the “silent majority,” didn’t 
join either camp. This was my family’s 
case. For this majority, killing people 
on either side was equally horren- 
dous, because it was always an Afghan 
who died. A nation is like a wall—

orn in Kabul in 1949, Spojmai Zaridb began publishing short stories 
when she was 17. “My father gave me a love of literature,” she says. “He 
was a exceptional man. He never made me feel | was just a girl and never 
forbade me or forced me to do anything. There was no television when |

the end. | must have been about three or four years old. After that, Persian 
classical poetry greatly helped me on my literary journey. But the short 
story, my favourite literary form, is a Western invention | owe my love for 
it to foreign writers, especially Europeans and Americans.” 
After attending the Faculty of Literature and the Fine Arts School in 
Kabul, Zariab spent a year studying literature in France. When she retur- 
ned home in 1973, a military coup by Mohammed Daoud, the king's cou- 
sin, ended the constitutional monarchy and a series of conflicts began. 
Five years later, Daoud was murdered in another coup d’'état, and in 
September 1979, President Noor Mohammed Taraki was killed by his 
deputy, Hafizullah Amin. Two months later, Amin was assassinated by 
Soviet forces. They installed Babrak Karmal in power and invaded the 
country in December 1979. 
During the 10 years of Soviet rule, Zariab continued to work as a trans- 
lator at the French embassy in Kabul. She published her work in Iran and, 
despite censorship, through Afghanistan's only publisher and printer, the 
Writers’ Union. 
In 1991, when the situation was fast deteriorating, Zariab moved to 
Montpellier with her two daughters. When the Taliban seized Kabul in 
1994, her husband Rahnaward Zariab, himself an eminent Afghan writer, 
joined his family in France. 
Spojmai Zariab’s short stories—written in Dari, a variation of Persian 
which, with Pashtun, is the official language of Afghanistan—are crafted 
in a harmonious blend of simplicity, sparseness and poetry. Humanism 
and universalism are the two features of her work, which continues to 
draw inspiration from her native land. 
Her collection of short stories, “The Plain of Cain,” won her many readers, 
as well as “Portrait of a City on a Purple Background,” a theatre adapta- 
tion of her work presented at the Avignon Off festival in 1991. In the 
postscript of her book, “These Walls That Listen to Us,” Michael Barry, a French 
expert on Persian literature, writes that “Sp6jmai, whose name means 
‘full moon,’ is one of the three greatest Afghan writers of our time, along 
with the two poets, Khalili, who died in exile, and Madjroiih, who was 
assassinated.” [|

enchanted me. It said everything, indi- 
rectly. Aytmatov became a ray of hope 
for me. 
When writers find themselves in 
this situation, they have to find lite- 
rary techniques to convey their mes- 
sage. Fortunately, the censors did not 
quite measure up to their job. They 
didn’t know much about literature and 
a lot of poets and novelists were publi- 
shed by the Afghan Writers’ Union, 
which was very active and had a 
sizeable budget. 
When the Soviet troops left, what did 
you think would happen to the country? 
There are some historical moments 
when you simply can’t predict any- 
thing. After all that had happened 
since 1973, we were still in for some 
surprises. Anything was possible. 
Nothing could be forecast. We missed 
opportunities to take quick and wise 
decisions to head off disaster. Now 
we’ve ended up with the Taliban,who 
know nothing about Afghanistan. 
They’re religious apprentices who’ve 
been trained in Koranic schools in 
Pakistan from the youngest age. They 
arrived with a rage to destroy, to des- 
troy everything, 
I heard they burned all the 
vineyards and pulled up the pistachio- 
nut trees. Pistachios were one of 
Afghanistan’s main exports. All the 
Taliban’s actions are guided by one 
idea:to make the country completely 
dependent — no more agriculture, no 
more irrigation systems, no more eco- 
nomy, just a completly devastated 
country. With the Russians, it was the 
tanks. With the Taliban, it’s fire. We 
had political fanaticism 
and now we’ve got reli- 
gious fanaticism. And 
fanaticism of any nature 
leads to a kind of blind- 
ness. 
You emigrated to France 
in 1991 a few years 
before the Taliban took 
over, having stayed right 
through Soviet rule. 
Why? 
I didn’t want to leave 
but Kabul had become 
too dangerous. The 
schools had closed 
because of repeated 
bombings of the city. At 
the time, my two daugh- 
ters were seven and 
eleven. I have three now. 
I wanted to protect them for a while 
and I went to live in Montpellier. But 
I didn’t intend to stay. I couldn’t face 
applying for the status of political 
refugee and giving up my Afghan pas- 
sport. Many times I went to the post 
office to send the application, but I 
could never bring myself to post it. 
But when my husband arrived in 1994, 
I realised all the bridges had been 
burned. I had to accept that I might 
never again see my country,my home- 
town and my house. 
Do you have any contact with Afgha- 
nistan these days? 
 A lost generation.

We had friends there, but they've 
all left. So has my entire family. We 
stayed for as long as we could in the 
country. We always said that every- 
thing could change but they couldn’t 
take away the country. 
Are there ties between Afghan com- 
munities around the world? 
There are some associations, 
newspapers and magazines. But such 
links are very hard to maintain. For 
one, immigrants don’t have the 
money to keep in touch all the time. 
Also, Afghans don’t have a long expe- 
rience of exile. There was no Afghan 
emigration before the Russians came. 
We're a people very attached to the 
land, to our families. Now we're scat- 
tered all over the world—Europe, the 
United States, Canada, Australia and 
Asia. Most of the refugees don’t know 
the language of their host countries. It 
takes them five or six years to adapt. 
It’s very tough being forced to look 
for refuge somewhere else in the 
world. The war’s been going on for 20 
years now. It’s a lost generation. Six 
million Afghan refugees — it’s a terri- 
fying figure. Dispersing a nation is the 
best way to wipe it out. 
How do you see the future of Afgha- 
nistan? 
As Tsay, after 1973 all bets were off. 
This hasn’t changed. No prospect 
seems more likely than another. But 
there’s still hope. 
One solution might come from 
King Zahir Shah. He’s the only person 
who all the tribes, all Afghans, still 
listen to. But we have to move quickly. 
Time is running out. My country is 
losing another generation because chil- 
dren aren’t getting access to educa- 
tion.And education is a basic right of 
all the world’s children. Why should 
it be an impossible dream for Afghan 
girls? They’re only allowed to go to 
Koranic schools, until they’re about 10 
or 12. And what do they learn? To 
recite verses in Arabic, a language they 
don’t even understand. It isn’t any 
better for boys. The lack of teachers, 
administrators and equipment has 
reduced schools to nurseries, without 
the facilities. 
But people are organizing to provide 
minimal education services. 
There are underground schools in 
Kabul. Mothers teach girls in their 
homes. It’s a kind of resistance. You   
“Dispersing a country is 
the best way to wipe it out” 
have to be very brave to do that 
because it’s illegal and the regime 
cracks down hard on illegal activity. 
For example, a woman just has to be 
accused of adultery, by anyone, without 
any proof, and she is stoned. 
How do the men—their husbands and 
their sons—react to this kind of punish- 
ment? 
The Taliban control nearly 90 per- 
cent of the country. Read the latest 
reports of Amnesty International and 
the UN Human Rights Commissioner. 
They describe these atrocities. Not only 
have ethnic minorities been uprooted 
and persecuted, the entire population 
lives under the constant threat of sanc- 
tions and all kinds of punishment and 
humiliation.Most people who stayed 
in Kabul are those who could not 
afford to escape. So they obey the 
“laws” to survive, laws that are uni- 
maginably absurd. 
One example: I heard of one 
Afghan living in Pakistan who died. 
He wanted to be buried in Kabul, so 
his family decided to take him there in 
his coffin. When they reached Afgha- 
nistan,the procession was stopped by 
the Taliban. They wanted to check the 
contents of the coffin, since smuggling 
is common. They saw the corpse, but

noticed the dead man didn’t have a 
beard. It 1sn’t obligatory in Pakistan 
like 1t 1s in Afghanistan. So the body 
was given 80 lashes as punishment. It’s 
madness. 
There's been an increase in religious 
fanaticism in many countries. Why has 
there been this radicalization of Islam? 
The two keys to the rise of Islamic 
fundamentalism—whether in Afgha- 
nistan, Iran, Algeria or other Arab 
countries—are illiteracy and ignorance. 
They pave the way for a “poor unders- 
tanding” or rather a total misunders- 
tanding of religion. To add to these 
deficiencies, there’s the gap between 
y 
Before being a writer, I am an 
Afghan, and I think that all Afghans 
today share the same concern—that 
the nightmare their country has 
endured for the past 20 years come to 
an end. That the country be saved from 
the discriminatory rule of the Taliban 
who are still backed by Pakistan, Saudi 
Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. 
That Afghan women be rescued from 
the clutches of these religious luna- 
tics. Before the Taliban,40 percent of 
teachers were women, a clear proof 
of their intellectual level. Now they 
are excluded from society. Their phy- 
sical, intellectual and psychological

generations, and the deep divide bet- 
ween rural and urban people. Don’t 
forget most members of the jihad 
(holy war) movements come from the 
countryside, where people generally 
distrust modernization and freedom, 
regarding them as a threat. In recent 
years, globalization and other kinds of 
progress that serve the political and 
economic interests of large industria- 
lized countries have been imposed on 
these countries at a vertiginous pace. 
Perhaps the fundamentalists are trying, 
in their panic, to bolster their move- 
ments by taking an increasingly hard 
line. In any case, the rise of funda- 
mentalism harms Islam because it 
makes 1t look like a fanatical religion, 
devoid of spirituality. 
The horrors of war have inspired most 
of your short stories so far. What are you 
focusing on today? 
plight 1s alarming. They’re not allowed 
to consult male doctors. Worse still, 
many are being sold into sexual slavery 
in Pakistan. 
Never before have the women of 
my country been subjected to such 
humiliation, and never has Afghanistan 
gone so far backwards. What's left of my 
country? The land is destroyed and 
strewn with landmines. There are many 
thousands of widows, orphans and 
maimed people. The country is ravaged 
by war, cold, drought and famine. Mil- 
lions of refugees live in camps, mostly in 
Pakistan and Iran,without any means 
of subsistence and in inhuman condi- 
tions. What I write, and will write can 
only be about these concerns
