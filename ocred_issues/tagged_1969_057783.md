Nasredin and the moon 
Little Nasredin was listening to his teacher reading a passage from the Koran : “God 
gave brilliance to the sun, and radiance to the moon”. 
— Which is the more useful, the sun or the moon? asked the teacher. 
— The moon, replied Nasredin without a moment's hesitation. 
— And why is that? 
— Because the sun only comes when it's daylight. But the moon lights up the world 
when it’s dark. 
The old teacher sighed and deemed it wiser to return to the rules of grammar.

Nasredin the Sage— 
story telling 
with a smile 
To the people of the Middle East 
the name Nasredin always in- 
vokes a chuckle—of admiration. 
Nasredin was a famous story 
teller-philosopher-jokester who 
lived in Anatolia during the 
13th century—but who he ac- 
tually was, where he came from 
and where he went remains a 
mystery. Turkey claims him as 
its national hero, in a sense so 
does Iran. There are those who 
say he never actually lived. But 
his anecdotes, mined from the 
rich vein of folk wisdom and 
always humorous, are more 
alive today than ever, from Tur- 
kestan to the Balkans and the 
eastern Mediterranean. Here, 
an 18th century Turkish minia- 
ture depicting Nasredin, the 
jovial philosopher-story teller.

Along with the higher quality and more 
abundant harvests which science 
helping the farmer to win from his 
fields, new foods are making their 
appearance on the market. Originally 
conceived and produced in scientific 
laboratories, these foods are “artificial” 
only in terms of the techniques used 
in their manufacture. They provide all 
the elements of a balanced diet, and 
in particular the vital proteins and amino 
acids. Photo shows various cells and

|. relatively recently, all 
too few practical measures had been 
taken to come to grips with the prob- 
lem of producing more food of the 
kind that was needed in the places it 
was needed most. 
Much attention has been given to 
throttling, by medicinal or other arti- 
ficial means, the population explosion 
—ironically enough, due largely in the 
first place to the introduction of 
modern medicine in less-developed 
countries. But one serious estimate, 
by the U.S. scientist and educator 
Harrison Brown in “The Challenge of 
Man's Future,” holds that the earth 
could—with technology now within 
our reach—sustain a population of 
50 thousand million, which even at 
the uncontrolled rate of present popu- 
lation growth would not be attained 
for four or five generations. 
Since the evidence to date is that 
birth control methods simply are not 
working, and are not likely to be fully 
effective for another generation or two, 
more immediate solutions to the 
world's food problem must be sought 
elsewhere. Highest priority must be 
given to the expansion of food pro- 
duction, within each of the lesser- 
developed countries. 
Food aid, while beneficial as a stop- 
gap measure to relieve famine caused 
by drought or flood, tends to attack 
the symptoms rather than the causes. 
While necessary in times of distress, 
even when food aid is maintained for 
a few years only, it breeds an 
unwholesome attitude of dependence 
among the recipients and makes it 
very difficult for local agriculture ever 
to get properly organized in face of 
competition from “free food.” 
  
GENE GREGORY has made a close study of 
food manufacturing and processing, particu- 
larly in Asia. He is a chemical engineer, 
business consultant and journalist and was 
formerly editor-in-chief of the “Weekly Tri- 
bune", Geneva, Switzerland, and a member 
of the editorial board of “Asia Magazine”, 
Hong Kong. He spent many years in 
South-East Asia where he was a foreign 
correspondent for Reuters Agency and held 
several editorial posts. He has written widely 
on economic and political questions. 


### 188409: The New food revolution

THE NEW FOOD 
REVOLUTION 
Even where shipments of agricul- 
tural goods have been used to 
generate local currencies which in 
turn become part of the overall funds 
available for economic aid pro- 
grammes, those funds have too often 
been diverted into the development of 
new non-agriculture-related industries 
rather than improving and increasing 
food production. 
The possession of a steel mill, a 
national airline and a polyethelene 
plant have been considered as symbols 
of progress—but were in fact monu- 
ments to the misconceived notion of 
planners that somehow these invest- 
ments constituted a short cut to the 
solution of underdevelopment prob- 
lems. 
Even though as much as 80 per cent 
of the population of the less-developed 
countries is engaged in agricultural 
pursuits, according to a recent review 
of the Development Assistance Com- 
mittee of the Organization for Econo- 
mic Co-operation and Development 
(OECD), only 12 per cent of the total 
aid flow (including food aid) went to 
agriculture. As a result of misplaced 
emphasis on industrialization, agricul- 
ture was deprived of needed local 
investment inputs at all levels—irri- 
gation, manufacture of fertilizers and 
pesticides, research, education, pro- 
cessing industries. 
In a sense, the fearful spectre of a 
world food crisis was a blessing in 
disguise. There came a widespread 
recognition of the truth that while 
massive emergency food aid could 
alleviate much of the immediate 
suffering, a change of emphasis in 
foreign aid programmes was long 
overdue. 
But perhaps even more important, 
the urgency of immediate action on 
the part of the governments of lesser- 
developed countries provoked a 
general up-grading of agricultural 
priorities for investments as well as a 
lifting of some of the impedimenta 
that have prevented private foreign 
capital from investing in industries 
for the manufacture of badly needed 
agricultural inputs and the processing 
of farm products for the home and 
export markets. 
But, as yet, in the lesser-developed 
countries, all of them agricultural 
countries, there has been almost no 
agricultural research or higher agri- 
cultural education. Three exceptions 
are examples for all governments to 
imitate: 
B® Mexico, which had for years 
imported half of the wheat consumed 
in the country, after an extensive 
wheat research programme begun in 
1944 and conducted by the Rockefeller 
Foundation, was self-sufficient in this 
grain by 1956, and in 1964 exported 
a half million tons. 
BM At Los Banos in the Philippines, 
research sponsored jointly by the 
Rockefeller and Ford Foundations 
developed new varieties of rice, the 
IR 5 and IR 8, which increase yields 
up to 8.5 tons per acre—or about 
15 times the average yield of tradi- 
tional varieties. As a result, in the 
short span of about three years the 
Philippines has been transformed from 
a rice deficit to a rice surplus country. 
BR American aid agronomists adapted 
improved varieties of Guatemalan 
corns to Indonesia and Thailand which 
did, in fact, produce something of an 
agricultural revolution in the latter. 
In eight years the crop in Thailand 
increased from non-existent production 
to an export of $104 million, the fourth 
largest corn export in the world. 
Extended to other critical food 
deficit areas, the results of these 
research efforts, largely privately 
financed, have produced a veritable 
“green revolution” in the world’s most 
food deficient regions which just two 
years ago were threatened by 
widespread and seemingly continu- 
ing famine.

### 57796: India moves towards self-sufficency in food

### 188409: The New food revolution

THE NEW FOOD REVOLUTION (Continued) 
HB In India, the area planted with 
new varieties of wheat, rice, millet 
and sorghum increased from about 
23,000 acres in 1965-66 to nearly 
4 million acres one year later. As a 
result, India harvested 95.6 million 
tons in 1967-68, and expects to achieve 
self-sufficiency in 1970-71 (see text 
opposite). 
HM Pakistan, which imported large 
quantities of Mexican wheat seed, 
will harvest a record 5.5 million ton 
grain crop this year; and by 1970 
should be producing twice as much 
food grains as in 1965, enough to meet 
the country's requirements. 
Particularly noteworthy results have 
been obtained by development teams 
of the Republic of China in African 
countries where they have introduced 
their Taiwan Native 1 rice species. 
Extensive experiments in the Cam- 
eroons, Gabon, Gambia, Malawi, Niger, 
Senegal, Chad and Togo by these 
teams have more than doubled 
production obtained with traditional 
rice strains. ) 
As a result of these and other 
developments, farming has suddenly 
become both respectable and lucrative 
in many countries. 
In Rome, early last October, Addeke 
H. Boerma, Director-General of FAO, 
expressed cautious optimism that 
“the long lag in food production which 
plagued the past decade may be 
coming to an end.” And in Paris, he 
told delegates to a Unesco interna- 
tional scientific conference on the use 
and conservation of the resources of 
the biosphere, “I believe that the 
agriculture of the developing countries 
is now reaching the point of "take-off." 
(See the “Unesco Courier,” January 
1969.) 
But the coming agricultural revolu- 
tion is not confined to progress in 
the developing countries. New but 
untried ideas will displace a whole 
raft of outdated notions about food 
production—first in the advanced 
industrial countries, but eventually 
profoundly affecting the developing 
countries.

### 57796: India moves towards self-sufficency in food

TOWARDS SELF-SUFFICIENCY IN FOOD 
bos is in the midst of a dramatic revolu- 
tion: using new, high-yield food grains, chemical 
fertilizers, progressive mechanization and modern 
irrigation techniques, this nation of 540 million people 
—long cited as proof of the inevitability that the 
world's population must increase faster than its 
ability to feed it—expects to be self sufficient in food 
production by 1970-1971. 
This extraordinary leap forward, has been made 
possible by the successful development of high- 
yielding strains of rice, wheat, jowar, bajra, maize, 
groundnut, linseed, rapeseed, mustard, lucerne, etc. 
This means that the Indian farmer is now able to 
increase production not by 15 to 20 per cent but 
by 70 to 80 per cent or more. 
Working to bring 32.5 million acres (one-eleventh 
of India's cultivated area) under the new seed 
varieties by 1971, he has so far had remarkable 
success. After the disastrous 1965-67 drought, 20 
million acres were planted with a sturdy, prolific wheat, 
perfected in Mexico. The result was a bumper crop 
in 1968 of 16.6 million tons, exceeding the previous 
record by 35 per cent (4.3 million tons). Thirty-eight 
million tons of rice were grown in the same period, 
as well as a record maize crop of 6.3 million tons. 
| arid and underproductive lands are 
now blossoming under the benign influence of the 
“green revolution” as growers and government work 
together to consolidate their achievements, Several 
states have launched ambitious programmes to 
increase handling capacity, storage, transportation 
and distribution of the bigger crops. Punjab’s crash 
road construction programme is bringing every village 
to within two miles of an all weather road. 
Spurred on by nationwide promotional measures 
including rebates, transport subsidies and credit, the 
fertilizer gap is being closed with increased home 
production that will reach almost two million tons by 
1971 and over five million tons by 1973-1974. 
Where one kilogramme of nitrogen used to produce 
10 additional kilogrammes of grain, the same amount 
now produces 20-25 kilogrammes of the high-yield 
crops; the same quantity of water by means of new 
technology produces at least 2-3 times more food. 
Through scientific management of soil and water, 
agronomists and farmers have come up with results 
that a few years ago would have been considered 
almost impossible. On land whose production capa- 
city was 3-4 tons of grain per hectare, 10-12 tons 
are now considered a minimum goal, with 15-20 tons 
an immediate possibility. 
Among the most important grains are new dwarf 
varieties of rice and wheat. India's first high-yield 
rice came from Taiwan, followed by a new strain 
developed by the Philippine International Rice Insti- 
tute. The dwarf wheat was developed by the Rocke- 
feller Foundation in Mexico, and made available to 
India by the Ford Foundation. Standing only 18 inches 
high on a sturdy stock, the new wheat can bear more 
grain without falling over (see article page 4). 
Another decisive factor in India's agricultural 
renaissance is its increasing independence from the 
vagaries of the monsoon and ancient irrigation 
devices. Modern irrigation systems and efficient 
electrical and diesel pumps have taken over in many 
areas from bullock-powered water wheels and work 
will begin next month to extend the area under modern 
irrigation by 35 million acres. 
Well into the planning stage are projects to harness 
nuclear energy for tapping underground water, manu- 
facturing fertilizers and operating agro-industrial com- 
plexes, and current research points to nuclear energy 
for desalting sea water for use in agriculture. 
Priority has been given to the manufacture of 
modern agricultural machinery, which until now has 
been mostly imported. Both the power tiller and 
tractor industries are exempt from licensing provi- 
sions, and tractor production reached almost 12 
thousand units in 1967-1968, compared to only 880 
units in 1961-1962. The target for this year is 
18 thousand Indian manufactured tractors. 
India's problem is no longer that of getting agri- 
culture moving; it is to keep it going. With the 
population growing by 13 million each year, pro- 
duction must be increased to 150 million tons to meet 
the needs of between 630 and 650 million people in 
the latter half of the 1970s. Indians are confident it 
can be done. J.S. Kanwar, deputy director-general 
of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, writing 
in the Indian journal, Seminar (August 1968), stated 
“...A country with 80-90 million acres of irrigated area 
should be able to produce without difficulty, even with 
the present technology in agriculture, about 300 million 
tons of food per annum”. 
i industrious and tenacious Indian farmer, 
no longer condemned to subsistence living, is the key 
to continued success. His determination to build upon 
the present “green revolution” is being matched by 
pragmatic educational programmes to equip him to 
deal with management and market problems, and to 
use his resources rationally. 
The educational and research challenge is being 
met by eight new agricultural universities, Quickly 
responding to the need, the Punjab University—the 
state's sole agent for agricultural research—has 
already established a successful range of programmes 
in co-operation with local farmers, while the agri- 
cultural universities of Mysore and Pantnagar have 
developed far-sighted research and education policies 
tailored to the needs of their respective areas. 
Agriculture's new success appears to have checked 
the migration of workers to cities and towns, and the 
more successful farmers can now earn over $1,300 
a year, twice as much as a clerk. Land prices have 
risen, medical services in rural areas have improved 
and, armed with superior raw materials and benefitting 
from advanced technology, the Indian farmer is becom- 
ing a dynamic contributor to national well-being. 
India has made impressive progress in a short time; 
serious problems must still be overcome, but the 
agricultural pattern which has been set is a solid 
foundation for future prosperity.

### 188409: The New food revolution

THE NEW FOOD REVOLUTION (Continued) 
1,000 calves from a single cow on computerized farms 
per acre, against today's average 
75 bushels. 
HM A single cow will produce as many 
as 1,000 calves in its lifetime, as 
compared to the present 10, through 
the use of hormones which keep the 
entire cycle of ovulation and pregnancy 
in cows and other domestic animals 
under exact control. Embryos will be 
transferred from special breeder ani- 
mals to ordinary “incubator” animals 
with substantial increases in prolifi- 
cacy of a herd and a radical improve- 
ment in quality animal production. 
HW Milk production will soar to 
30,000 pounds per cow from today's 
8,000. Synthetic milk will also be 
manufactured from carrot tops and 
pea pods. 
HM Today's farm labourers will be 
increasingly replaced by “farm 
engineers,” scientists and technicians 
trained in fields ranging from elec- 
tronics to air conditioning. 
Mm Farming will become automated 
and computerized, with tilling of the 
soil, planting and harvesting crops 
and regulating the growing process 
controlled from a centre equipped 
with computers, radar and remote 
control devices. 
WM Fields will be covered by huge 
plastic domes, or by other means 
enabling the constant control of 
environment affecting crop growth. 
HM Remote-controlled harvesters will 
not only pick but also grade, package, 
freeze and deliver food to wholesale 
depots. 
HM Space satellites will collect up-to- 
the-minute data on soil conditions, 
insect damage, crop growth patterns 
throughout the world, as well as make 
long range weather and production 
forecasts. 
B UT this is just a beginning. 
In the United States alone there are 
presently some 30,000 research pro- 
jects under way, and spending for 
agricultural research is more than $850 
million annually. 
While today 7,000,000 Americans 
live on farms producing many times 
the volume of food 31,000,000 farmers 
produced a century ago, by the 
year 2,000 a scant 2,000,000 of the 
300,000,000 people in the U.S, will be 
“farmers.” The average U.S. farmer 
now produces enough food to feed 
40 people, four times the number he 
could feed 30 years ago; in the next 
30 years, productivity will increase 
another four-fold based upon techno- 
logy already known and within reach. 
But in agriculture, as in other fields 
that are increasingly science—and 
technology—based, half of what is 
known today will be obsolete by 1980. 
Or, to put it another way, at the present 
rate of technological advance, half of 
the agricultural technology of 1980 
has not yet been discovered. 
One of the most immediate effects 
of the coming agricultural revolution, 
both in the advanced and in the deve- 
loping countries, will be an increase in 
capital intensive farming. Post World 
War Il increases in mechanization in 
the advanced countries have already 
far surpassed the “tractor stage”: 
WM airplanes are increasingly used to 
spray test-tube “miracles” over crops 
and pasture lands; 
MW computers determine when and how 
to breed calves by artificial insemi- 
nation; 
WM devices such as the “autosow,” 
which acts as a kind of mechanical 
mother for baby pigs, are turning pig 
farming into a mass production indus- 
try much like the poultry business; 
HM the “Bacon Bin,” a recently devised 
total confinement production facility— 
complete with automatic feeding and 
manure disposal systems—can raise 
and fatten 1,000 hogs at once, from 
birth to maturity, in record time. 
Major international food companies 
continue to expand their large-scale 
farming activities, primarily in develop- 
ing countries, But since foreign- 
owned “plantations” smack of “colon- 
ialism,” and for a host of other 
impedimenta common to the newly 
independent countries, there have been 
limited opportunities for private busi- 
ness to contribute directly to the devel- 
opment of badly needed food industries 
through this kind of direct invest- 
ment. 
With the change of attitudes in the 
developing countries toward the deve- 
lopment of the agricultural sector, the 
day may not be far off when direct 
foreign investments in agricultural 
enterprises may again be welcomed, 
but for the moment the opportunities 
for investment in the developing 
countries lie in other equally interest- 
ing sectors vital to increasing food 
production. 
Someone must supply the new varie- 
ties of wheat, rice, corn, millet and 
sorghum in massive and continuing 
quantities at relatively low prices. And 
the new “miracle” seed varieties are 
not enough by themselves to insure 
the fruition of a green revolution in 
the developing countries. Suitable 
quantities of fertilizers, insecticides, 
water and farm machinery are necess- 
ary. Credit, marketing, and other ser- 
vices of modern agricultural systems 
must be made available. 
The way the new seed varieties 
were introduced into the Philippines, 
India and Pakistan had as much to do 
with their success as does the quality 
of the seeds themselves. Rice “kits” 
consisting of the seed, fertilizer, insect- 
icides needed to grow a half-acre of 
one of the seed varieties were sold 
or distributed together. This novel 
distribution concept presents a special 
challenge to abilities of international 
corporate enterprises to develop the 
required joint marketing facilities. 
Ie governments of devel- 
oping nations, local private business 
and the farmers cannot sustain this 
effort without outside help. They lack 
the means to do the adaptive research, 
the facilities needed to train farmers in 
modern agricultural techniques, the 
public finances for large-scale irriga- 
tion and rural electrification projects, 
or for adequate storage and modern 
transport facilities. They often lack 
the required technology, capital and 
managerial personnel necessary to 
build new plants to produce the requir- 
ed seed, fertilizer, insecticide and other 
essential inputs. 
To meet these needs, governments of 
OECD countries have appreciably 
increased their aid to agricultural pro- 
grammes of developing countries in 
recent years. The World Bank an- 
nounced in October 1968 that it would 
quadruple loans to speed the develop- 
ment of world agriculture. The Inter- 
American Development Bank now com- 
mits about 27 per cent of its funds for 
agricultural development purposes, and 
the Asian Development Bank—formed 
just two years ago—is presently engag- 
ed in a country-by-country survey to 
‘assess priority projects to be con- 
sidered for assistance by its projected 
Agricultural Development Fund. 
But producing food is business. 
And many of the resources needed 
by developing countries to get the 
nascent agricultural revolution off the 
ground are the almost exclusive pos- 
sessions of private enterprise in west- 
ern industrial countries.

The most tangible sign of the effec-

THE NEW FOOD REVOLUTION (Continued)

national business. Almost all develop- 
ing countries have undertaken more 
or less extensive agricultural training 
programmes, which hold the key to the 
introduction of new farming techniques 
including the mechanization of farm 
production. The South American Farm 
Mechanization Training Centre at Buga, 
Colombia, illustrates how such pro- 
grammes can be effectively developed 
through co-operation among industry, 
the FAO and governments. 
With FAO's guidance through the 
Freedom from Hunger Campaign, the 
Colombian National Training Service 
and a British farm machinery manufac- 
turer set up the centre to train tech- 
nicians from Colombia and other Latin 
American countries as instructors in 
farm machinery operation and repair 
and as government extension officers. 
With wide experience in such train- 
ing programmes in the United King- 
dom, France, the Federal Republic of 
Germany and each of the Scandina- 
vian countries, the British firm was 
in a position to provide the necessary 
instructional staff, as well as a broad 
range of tractors, equipment for work- 
shops and teaching aid. The com- 
pany's donation to this project, which 
will eventually amount to approximately 
$300,000, represents a far-sighted 
investment in South American agricul- 
ture development. 
Aorer field of potential 
industry-government co-operation in- 
volves one of the most widely discuss- 
ed developments in the world food in- 
dustry, a process developed by a 
British petroleum company at its French 
refinery for producing protein from 
crude oil. The final product, a yellow- 
ish, odourless powder, is comparable 
to fishmeal in composition. But, like 
fishmeal, it is not yet suitable for direct 
human consumption. It is, however, 
suitable for feeding to animals and 
poultry, which in turn convert it to the 
traditional and still most acceptable 
food forms—meat, milk and eggs. (See 
article page 21). 
While some experts say that it will 
be at least ten years before we will 
see human food derived directly from 
protein produced from petroleum or 
from natural gas, several oil and chem- 
ical companies consider the potential 
demand for the product great enough 
to begin their own development pro- 
grammes. India has already started 
producing proteins from petroleum 
hydrocarbons with pilot plants under 
the direction of the Indian Institute 
of Petroleum at Dehradun and the 
Regional Research Laboratory at 
Jorhat, 
A number of high protein concen- 
trates have also been developed from 
various vegetable and fish sources. 
Dr. Norman W. Pirie, head of the bio- 
chemistry department at Rothamsted 
Experimental Station in England, has 
developed one of the most recent—a 
process for extracting protein from 
green leaves, such as pea cannery 
waste. 
A Swedish company is now produc- 
ing a fish protein concentrate which, 
mixed with water and cocoa powder, 
has been used recently in Nigeria and 
Biafra. 
At the American University of Beirut, 
a new supplementary—called Aubina— 
has been developed from wheat, Egyp- 
tian chick-pea, bone-ash and skim 
milk, and tests have shown that child- 
ren find it good to eat. 
Both soya and cotton-seed have long 
been sources of protein concentrate. 
But while the day may not be far off 
when meat, bread and even bacon 
made from these materials will be part 
of man’s normal diet, so far protein- 
rich foods have received an extremely 
cool reception. 
While there is a certain compelling 
logic in the argument that protein 
concentrates are “good for you,” 
there still remains the problem of how 
the stuff tastes. And experience shows 
that unless people are really at the 
starvation level, they are particular 
about the taste of the food they eat. 
This was the sum and substance of 
a number of scientific papers present- 
ed to the combined FAO/WHO/ 
UNICEF Protein Advisory Board last 
September. According to Dr. O. Bal- 
larin, an executive of the Brazilian sub- 
sidiary of a Swiss food company, all 
efforts by private enterprise in South 
America to sell and promote high-pro- 
tein produce have met with disappoint- 
ing results, and in some cases failed 
completely. In Peru, production of a 
high-protein fish flour produced from 
anchoveta was discontinued after sales 
sank to a disastrous low. Similar diffi- 
culties have been met with in Africa. 
Specialists give these reasons for 
consumer resistance to something 
that is obviously “good for them”: 
BM Traditions regarding food are 
stronger in developing countries than 
in developed ones. New foods, deliver- 
ed in a new form or a new package, 
are looked upon with suspicion. 
HB Most people ignore the meaning of 
the word “protein,” which has no 
commercial appeal. 
HM People shun high-protein products 
for social reasons, regarding them as 
“the food of the poor.” 
| Ethiopia, some of these 
obstacles were overcome by the nutri- 
tionists, who called their product Faffa 
(meaning “grow big and strong” in the 
local language). Faffa was a success. 
But in many other countries, where 
illiteracy ranges up to 85 per cent, and 
people cannot even read the name of 
the product, promotion campaigns have 
to be carried out through films, radio 
and television. 
Nevertheless, specialists such as 
Dr Husain Ali Bhimjee Parpia, Director 
of the Central Food Technological Re- 
search Institute in Mysore, India, are 
firmly convinced that protein malnutri- 
tion can be overcome in much of the 
developing world if the available 
resources of oil-seed protein are utiliz- 
ed more efficiently. As soon as 
acceptable products can be perfected 
and attractively presented through 
regular commercial channels, vegetable 
protein sources will certainly make a 
major contribution to solving present 
nutritional problems. 
Weaning foods, biscuits, ice cream, 
beverages and candies are the prep- 
arations which are now under consid- 
eration by major international food pro- 
cessors. Three American companies 
are now apparently convinced they are 
on the brink of a major breakthrough 
in this field. One is planning to manu- 
facture and sell throughout Asia a 
highly popular Hong Kong soybean 
drink with a satisfactory amino acid 
content. A major soft drinks bottling 
firm has developed a chocolate-flav- 
oured, soybean-based high-protein 
beverage, fortified with vitamins; this 
potent concoction has already been 
launched on the Brazilian market. In 
El Salvador, a third company has just 
completed consumer testing on a new 
high-protein soft drink made from corn 
meal, cottonseed and nut meal. 
But if the development of synthetic 
nutrients provides the basis for an 
entire new sector of the food industry, 
prospects for expansion in the exploita- 
tion ‘of the world's marine resources is 
undoubtedly more immediate. The sea 
is, for the foreseeable future, an al- 
most limitless source of high-protein 
content food. Annual production of 
plants within the oceans, according to

Several years ago, certain communities in 
the Republic of Chad were found to be 
eating a blue alga called Spirulina {above 
left), which grows in ponds rich in mineral 
salts, and highly alkaline. After it is 
harvested, women form it into pancakes 
to dry in the sun (above), before taking 
it to market. The ancient Aztecs consum- 
ed a similar alga which grew in Mexico's 
lakes. Spirulina contains between 60 and 
68 per cent protein, that is, six times as 
much as in wheat and three times as much 
as in beef. French and Mexican research 
laboratories, excited by its large-scale 
nutritional possibilities, are experimenting 
with its artificial cultivation. The culture is 
produced by photosynthesis in vats of luke- 
warm salt water (left), which are fed with 
carbonic gas. Results show that the annual 
yield of Spirulina could be 40-45 tons per 
hectare with a 25 ton protein content, as 
compared to only 30-40 kilogrammes of 
beef protein per hectare.

THE NEW FOOD REVOLUTION (Continued) 
the FAQ's Fish Stock Evaluation Branch 
Chief, John Allan Gulland, is approxi- 
mately 130 thousand million tons— 
hardly any of which is used for human 
consumption. And of the 23 thousand 
million tons of fish and shellfish the 
ocean grows per year, the present 
world-wide catch is about 60 million 
tons. 
While much of the plant life—the 
phytoplankton—is generally microscop- 
ic and neither easy to harvest nor 
attractive to use, there are vast possib- 
ilities for expanding the fishing indus- 
try. At present the world catch of 
fish, rising annually by from 6 to 8 per 
cent is growing faster than the world's 
population. World fisheries production 
increased from 19 million metric tons 
in 1948 to 60 million tons in 1967, or 
at a rate much faster than food produc- 
tion from the land. 
But present fishing methods are still 
traditional and primitive. Production 
might well be doubled in the next ten 
years through the use of new electronic 
equipment which detects the presence 
of schools of fish, speeds the move- 
ment of nets, and even lures fish into 
the nets. 
While most of the world's fishing 
grounds are being quite intensively 
worked, the Indian Ocean—one of 
the world’s least known oceans—may 
well be one of the richest and most 
underdeveloped. Recent estimates 
submitted to the FAQ's Indian Ocean 
Fishery Commission indicate that the 
yearly catch of fish in the Indian Ocean 
could be increased about ten times, 
from its present level of 2 million to 
20 million metric tons annually—with- 
out damaging the stocks. In the more 
immediate future, current production 
could be raised to 10 million tons a 
year, putting the ocean's fisheries on 
On this diet provided at the Max Planck Horticultural Institute 
in Hamburg, Germany (Fed. Rep.) the fish grow to 14 pounds (instead of 3) in three 
years. Rose flower, opposite, is extraordinary pattern, formed by sea slug 
eggs on sea floor. 
a par with those of the North Atlantic, 
which yield approximately 11 million 
tons a year. 
Still, if fishing remains confined to 
the types of fish now exploited, experts 
estimate that the world catch would 
probably approach its physical limit 
within the useful working life of fish- 
ing vessels now being built. Alter- 
native sources of natural production 
include both fish and other animals 
more or less unfamiliar to most fish 
consumers. 
For instance, squid of various types 
appear to be abundant in many parts 
of the world, but exploiting the very 
large quantities of this creature—now 
eaten readily only in Japan and Med- 
iterranean  countries—depends as 
much on changing the tastes of the 
consumer as on being able to catch 
the animals economically.

A common misconception contributes 
to the rise of such a tragic spectre. 
WESLEY MARX has written widely on the 
impact of technology on the environment, 
particularly the ocean. He has participated 
In several scientific expeditions and made 
extensive field trips on both the Atlantic and 
Pacific coasts of the U.S.A. to gather 
material for this article. His book on ocean 
conservation “The Frail Qcean” (Coward- 
McCann, New York) was published in 1967. 


### 57797: Nurseries of the sea

NURSERIES 
OF THE SEA 
by Wesley Marx 
While the ocean regime may appear to 
stop at the shore, its vital processes 
extend into our bays, salt marshes, 
rivers and even our mountain streams. 
In a magnificent migration, silver- 
toned salmon rise from cold ocean 
depths, navigate to river mouths in 
Europe, Scandinavia, Asia and the 
Americas, swim intently against river 
currents, hurdle small waterfalls and 
finally pause in green-shaded mountain 
streams far from the blue ocean. Here 
they were born and here they will 
give birth, their tail fins scratching out 
cribs in the gravel bottom. Many other 
marine fish use rivers as nurseries: 
 
shad, striped bass, alewife and the 
ugly, caviar-bearing sturgeon. These 
river-ascending fish are called anadro- 
mous—"upward-running”. 
An even greater spectrum of marine 
life is nursed and reared in estuaries, 
those places where the oceans and 
rivers of the world collide to form bays, 
salt marshes and fjords. Here, suc- 
coured on rich nutrients and shelter- 
ed from sharks and other marine pre- 
dators, young tarpon, snook, mullet, 
menhaden, dab, plaice, flounder and 
smelt prepare themselves to enter the 
vast ocean. 
Estuaries nurse West Africa's prin- 
cipal catch, the bonga, and India's 
favourite fishes, the hilsa, bombay duck, 
cock-up and pearl spot. Shellfish— 
clams, oysters, scallops, mussels—and 
crustacea—shrimps, lobsters, crabs 
—flourish in estuaries. In the Urited 
States, two-thirds of the marine catch 
is estuary-dependent. Many fish which 
keep to the sea are, in turn, dependent 
on estuaries for providing forage fare. 
Our rivers and our estuaries are thus 
vital nurseries of marine life, the re- 
pository of the birthright of so many 
fish and shellfish. 
Much of the world's population lives 
on or near coast-lines and we tend 
to see estuaries and rivers in man- 
made roles: harbours, navigation chan- 
nels, land reclamation projects, sewage 
ponds, sand and gravel pits. This 
narrow vision triggers a tragic collision 
between human geography and natural 
geography, as exemplified by one 
beautiful, world renowned bay. San 
Francisco Bay makes the city of San 
Francisco one of the most charming 
urban regions in the world, part penin- 
sula and part ocean bay, part green 
mountains and part blue plains. Here 
the United Nations was created. The 
bay traditionally serves as a vast mar-

NURSERIES OF THE SEA (Continued) 
Let’s not kill the fish that lay the golden eggs 
ine nursery and a passageway for 
salmon and other anadromous fish. 
At one time, the Pacific coast's larg- 
est commercial fishing fleet docked 
in the bay. Yet today no commercial 
fishermen trawl their seine nets in 
its sunlit shallows. The marine nur- 
sery is a ghost nursery. It exists 
largely as a giant cesspool, a gar- 
bage dump and a real estate reservoir. 
As a cesspool, it receives the dis- 
charges of over 80 sewage outfalls. 
Daily, some 60 tons of greases and 
oils cascade into the bay and paralyze 
the nerves of striped bass. Acid 
wastes burn salmon gills and disrupt 
breathing. Papermill effluents disrupt 
the normal division of eggs and fisher- 
men catch freakish flounder. These 
wastes have transformed the life-giv- 
ing bay waters into a toxic broth. 
Ninety per cent of the bay is closed 
to shellfish harvest. Keeping it clear 
as a navigation channel means that 
fish habitat is dredged up and oyster 
beds interred under silt avalanches. 
As a garbarge dump, marshes that 
once nurtured eelgrass and other nu- 
trients now exude only hot, pungent 
odours of decay. Tideland habitat 
has been buried to accommodate 
apartments, shopping centres, airport 
runways and athletic stadiums. A third 
of the bay—some 257 square miles— 
has been reclaimed. 
I. bay that once provided 
15 million pounds of oysters annually 
no longer supports oyster production. 
The bay that once provided 300,000 
pounds of clams annually no longer 
supports clam production. The bay that 
once provided six and one-half million 
pounds of shrimp annually now pro- 
duces only 10,000 pounds. 
Such a tragic waste is repeated in 
other famous estuary and river systems 
throughout the world. Dr. Pieter Kor- 
ringa, Director of the Netherlands 
Institute for Fisheries Investigation 
notes: 
“The river Rhine, in season, used 
to teem with salmon making their way 
to their spawning grounds in Germany, 
France and Switzerland. Old paintings 
in art galleries reveal that salmon was 
on the table of the poorest people in 
the Netherlands. In the Netherlands 
today, few people have even seen a 
salmon which did not come out of 
a tin, or was on display, smoked, in a 
fishmonger's shop. The Rhine is now 
called Europe's open sewer.” 
In the 1900s, fishermen on England's 
River Tees harvested 8,000 pounds of 
salmon yearly: by the 1920s, 3,000 
pounds; now, virtually zero. A new 
and deadly tributary empties into the 
Tees: twelve million gallons of sewage 
daily. Sewage-nourished “blooms” of 
scum algae render some of Norway's 
deep blue fjords opaque. These dense 
greenish blooms, by exhausting oxygen 
in the waters, suffocate marine life 
and leave stinking windrows of dead 
fish on the beach. 
Le sewage outfalls, river 
dams can seriously impair the nurseries 
of the sea. Soviet marine biologist 
G.V. Nikolsky notes in his book 
“Special Ichthyology” : 
“The fishing industry and ichthyo- 
logy in general are faced with new, 
vast problems through the construction 
of huge hydroelectric plants. Dams 
built across the southern rivers of 
the U.S.S.R. are liable to obstruct and 
prevent valuable anadromous commer- 
cial fish, primarily the sturgeon, from 
reaching their spawning grounds.” 
The dams, by directing river water 
into irrigation diversions, also serve to 
lower the level of seas such as the 
Caspian, further shrinking the habitat 
of the famed sturgeon. Sewage out- 
falls threaten sturgeon as well. Soviet 
author Mikhail Sholokhov recently re- 
ported that almost a million sturgeon 
died on one polluted stretch of river. 
Today, in a critical effort to sustain its 
long-established caviar industry, the 
Soviet Union loads sturgeon aboard 
river boats to carry them safely through 
slime that covers their migration 
routes. 
Unprotected, the nurseries of the 
sea can degenerate into nurseries of 
death that threaten human beings as 
well as fish. Eleven fishing villages 
and the industrial city of Minamata 
line the shores of Minamata Bay in 
Japan. In 1950, a nerve disease began 
affecting some residents. A once 
bright teenage boy could no longer 
button his clothes or hold his 
chopsticks. A fisherman clawed his 
hands, bared his teeth at doctors 
and growled at his children. Between 
1953 and 1963, some 105 similar cases 
occurred, most ending fatally or with 
severe disability. 
Perplexed by “Minamata Disease,” 
doctors tried to isolate living habits 
common to victims. Most victims lived 
in the fishing villages rather than the 
city, and these victims subsisted on 
the bay's abundant supply of shellfish. 
While healthy in their own right, the 
bay shellfish were found to contain 
unusually high concentrations of mer- 
cury, a substance highly injurious to 
human nerves. 
Where did the mercury come from? 
Investigators, including Professor Mak- 
io Uchida of Japan and Dr. Leonard 
Kurland of the United States, found 
that a chemical plant was dumping 
mercury wastes into the bay. The 
wastes were diluted, but shellfish can 
filter out and concentrate dilute sub- 
stances. “Ecological magnification,” a 
basis of survival in the dilute solution 
of sea water, had thus been perverted 
and the shellfish turned into living 
vials of poison. “Minamata Disease,” 
according to Professor Uchida, ceased 
once the chemical plant stopped dump- 
ing mercury wastes into the bay and 
consumption of bay shellfish was pro- 
hibited. 
Recenry New York City 
experienced a sharp rise in cases of 
hepatitis (inflammation of the liver). 
Many victims remembered consuming 
oysters. The source of the oysters was 
traced to a nearby bay. Oysters in 
this bay were found to have an oily 
taste. The oyster meat was greenish 
rather than white. Oil wastes in the 
bay contributed to the oily seasoning. 
Copper wastes contributed to the 
greenish hue, These oysters, marin- 
ated and steeped in wastes, were 
inflaming the livers of New Yorkers. 
Today the bay oysters lie in quarantine 
just like the shellfish of Minamata Bay.

NURSERIES OF THE SEA (Continued from page 14) 


### 57797: Nurseries of the sea

Leading the salmon by the tip of the nose 
its landward nurseries, we will grad- 
ually doom our most valuable and 
popular sea foods. 
Not only will the livelihood of fisher- 
men, the diet of millions of people 
and the favourite recipes of gourmets 
be jeopardized. Nutrition experts see 
in the food stocks of the ocean the 
potential to satisfy the hunger of an 
increasingly congested planet. (See 
article page 4.) National agencies 
and international agencies like the 
Food and Agriculture Organization are 
attempting to cultivate this potential, 
but these attempts will be seriously 
jeopardized if we persist in sterilizing 
the nurseries of the sea. 
Efforts to reverse this trend are 
intensifying but face great obstacles. 
The banning of all man-made activities 
on rivers and estuaries would certainly 
serve to reverse such a trend. But 
such a ban would be not only impos- 
sible but unnecessary. Estuaries and 
rivers can act as both nurseries of the 
sea and as an industrial resource—but 
only in proper balance. To effect such 
a balance, the stresses and tolerances 
of marine life must be known and 
evaluated. 
Yo man's study of the land 
environment has traditionally (and 
understandably) outstripped his study 
of the marine environment, and his lag 
impairs marine conservation. The dan- 
gerous plight of salmon and other ana- 
dromous fish has been known for some 
time, but solutions have had to await 
a better scientific acquaintance with 
these fish. Only recently have investi- 
gators offered a substantial explan- 
ation of how spawning salmon find 
the stream where the were born five 
or six years earlier. Experiments by 
Dr. Arthur Hasler at the University of 
Wisconsin in the United States indicate 
that salmon locate their parental 
stream by sniffing out the stream’s 
particular odour. 
The application of such knowledge 
can prove as time-consuming and 
rigorous as its discovery. Salmon 
eggs were artificially hatched over 
50 years ago. This capability was 
heralded as the answer to salmon 
conservation. Yet salmon hatcheries 
have never been able to match 
nature's former abundance. 
In the final analysis, proper pro- 
tection of fish habitat determines sur- 
vival. Accordingly, on many rivers, 
dams have been fitted with salmon 
ladders, water quality standards im- 
posed on sewage outfalls, spawning 
streams cleared of logging debris and 
mine tailings, and screens placed on 
irrigation canals that can divert young 
salmon into fatal dead ends. 
Bon scope and cost of 
such measures can rise quickly. The 
Columbia River in the United States 
has 21 salmon hatcheries, 22 fish 
ladders and some 600 screened irrig- 
ation diversions. Some 1,700 miles 
of stream bed have been cleared of 
debris. To better conserve ‘salmon 
conservation funds as well as salmon, 
Dr. Hasler is now considering the 
possibility of diverting spawning sal- 
mon from polluted parental streams 
to clean streams by duplicating stream 
odours. Clean streams are being 
created by draining wilderness areas 
with concrete water channels and 
coating these channels with gravel 
suitable for salmon cribs, Through 
such techniques, salmon and other 
anadromous fish may be diverted to 
habitat purposely maintained to per- 
petuate their abundance. 
Maintaining the habitat of estuarine 
life is proving an even more demanding 
task. Though seemingly a simple body 
of water, an estuary is in reality a 
biological engine driven by currents, 
tides, wind and other mechanisms that 
change from day to day. Left to its 
own devices, this sophisticated engine 
can sustain a natural productivity that 
rivals the fertility of jungles and that 
nurses millions of the ocean’s young. 
If disrupted, it falters as assuredly as 
an automobile engine fed on salt water. 
Circulatory currents serve to trap 
nutrient matter in an estuary as food 
for young fish. But these currents 
cannot discriminate between nutrients 
and toxic wastes, and research scien- 
tists now find that the waste receiving 
capacity of estuaries is sharply cir- 
cumscribed by this factor. A sewage 
outfall that discharges large amounts 
of fresh water, or a dam that restricts 
fresh water inflow can alter the critical 
mixture of fresh and saline water that 
estuarine inhabitants require. Thus 
fresh water, or the lack of it, can 
become a polluting influence. 
We will never be able to conserve 
the nurseries of the sea until we can 
understand such complex relationships, 
understand them so well that we can 
break them down in as much detail as 
the components of a jet engine. The 
United States is creating a hydraulic 
model of the Chesapeake Bay, a 
body of water nourished by 100 tribu- 
taries, the tides of the Atlantic and 
numerous metropolitan sewage out- 
falls. The model will be used to predict 
and balance the impact of sewage, 
dredging projects and dams on the 
Chesapeake biota. The aim of this 
large-scale project is not only to 
conserve Chesapeake Bay but to 
advance the knowledge of estuarine 
conservation in general. 
Through extensive research, investi- 
gator E. Foyns of Norway has evolved 
technology to prevent sewage from 
producing deadly slime in estuaries. 
Sewage entering the Oslo Fjords is 
exposed to electrolytic precipitation to 
remove phosphorous, a slime-forming 
catalyst. 
IT. common global int- 
erest in conserving the nurseries of 
the sea and preventing marine pollu- 
tion, is more and more being recogniz- 
ed. The FAO Advisory Committee on 
Marine Resources Research (ACMRR) 
has been questioning governments on 
the fisheries aspect of marine pollution. 
Working with ACMRR, the Intergovern- 
mental Oceanographic Commission 
(IOC) has set up a Working Group on 
Marine Pollution, headed by Dr. Kor- 
ringa of the Netherlands. This month, 
specialists from Unesco, the Food and 
Agriculture Organization, the Inter- 
Governmental Maritime Consultative 
Organization and the World Meteoro- 
logical Organization meet in London 
to study problems of marine pollution. 
Such efforts are aimed at estab- 
lishing a general scientific framework 
for the conduct of research into marine 
contamination that will serve to avoid 
duplication and expedite practical 
control measures. In addition, indus-

FORMS OF 
NATURE 
“No artist could improve the beauty, 
no craftsman match the perfection 
of execution, of these structures that 
grew in accordance with inherited 
patterns going back to the beginnings 
of time.” Thus writes Andreas 
Feininger in “The World Through My 
Eyes” {Crown Publishers, New York), 
where the famous American 
photographer presents some of his 
favourite pictures taken during the 
past 30 years. Among these are 
masterly close-ups from nature, 
including the shells shown on these 
pages. “The variety of forms of 
nature Is unlimited, their number 
infinite”, he says. “These 
photographs show different solutions 
to the protective needs of certain 
molluscs. Each sheil evolved to 
provide maximum protection in 
accordance with the specific 
environment and way of life of the 
respective mollusc, the different 
requirements being reflected in the 
differences in design: corrugated, 
ribbed, or spherical surface; 
presence or absence of protective 
spines; thinness or thickness of the 
wails.” Opposite, gasteropod;

NURSERIES OF THE SEA (Continued from page 17) 
 
Oysters at bay 
 
trial nations which learn how to salvage 
desecrated nurseries can show deve- 
loping nations how to avoid such dese- 
cration in the first place. 
Comprehending the nature of the 
nurseries of the sea will not alone 
guarantee their survival. An obstacle 
as formidable as would be a dam 
without a fish passage remains. Tra- 
ditionally, estuaries and rivers have not 
been administered as complete marine 
systems but as subdivisions of political 
systems on land. 
Thus, some 90 bayfront communities 
and a host of private and government 
agencies have utilized San Francisco 
Bay with little reference to each 
other's needs or the health of the bay 
itself. (The land reclamation project 
of one community now threatens to 
cut off a neighbouring community's 
access to the bay). The equivalent 
on dry land would be the use of a 
farmer's wheat fields by his neigh- 
bours as a cesspool, a dump, a play- 
ground and a highway right-of-way, or 
their requisition for use as a reservoir. 
Effective conservation of the nurs- 
eries of the sea will require more 
comprehensive systems of manage- 
ment. In the case of San Francisco 
Bay, a pioneer marine commission has 
been formed. Composed of local, 
state and federal officials, the commis- 
sion is empowered to view the bay 
as a single system and evolve a plan 
that will balance development with 
conservation. A major goal of the 
commission is to restore the bay as 
a prime marine nursery. 
| - countries are in- 
creasingly realizing the importance of 
marine nurseries and at the same time, 
invoking penalities against exploiters 
who ignore their true values. In 
Sweden, sponsors of hydroelectric 
dams must provide compensation for 
any disruption of salmon runs. In 
the Soviet Union, fish protection 
agencies may bring suit against 
industries or communities which 
pollute fish habitat by dumping 
excess wastes into the water. In 
Japan, fishermen can claim heavily 
from industrial construction enterprises 
that usurp or damage marine nurseries. 
In many places, protection of marine 
nurseries requires international action. 
The Fraser River flows through the 
‘Canadian province of British Columbia 
and empties into Puget Sound, a Paci- 
fic coast estuary bordered by the 
United States and Canada. By banding 
together in an international commis- 
sion, these two countries have restored 
the Fraser's great salmon runs, once 
blocked by careless riverside construc- 
tion. An international commission has 
now been formed to restore the Rhine 
to its former biological wealth. In time, 
fresh salmon may once more grace 
the dinner tables of Western Europe. 
Te growing efforts to save 
the nurseries of the sea will demand 
much in the way of research, tech- 
nology, money and political co-ordin- 
ation. But these nurseries will reward 
such attention amply enough. In sup- 
porting a new programme to conserve 
the United States" 106 anadromous 
rivers, the director of the U.S. Bureau 
of Commercial Fisheries declared: “In 
looking at what | consider to be the 
rather phenomenal success in the 
Columbia River, | would say that we 
could certainly justify this on the cost- 
benefit ratio very well.” 
Yet there is far greater justification, 
indeed necessity, for such efforts. We 
now realize that, if we deny the ocean 
its nurseries, we deny ourselves a food 
source regarded as crucial to human 
survival. We also deny ourselves a 
grand opportunity. Dr. Lionel Walford, 
Director of the Sandy Hook Marine 
Biology Laboratory in the United States 
observes: “While the estuary is the 
one part of the sea that man can ruin, 
it is also the part that he can control 
in order to increase the production of 
marine life.” 
Oyster and mussel cultivation pro- 
vide only a glimmer of the future bene- 
fits to be derived from ranching and 
farming our estuaries. The nurseries of 
the sea, with their present bounty and 
great potential, demand our respect 
and our care. Leaving a heritage of 
carp, gar, rat-tailed maggots and other 
pollution-resistant fish to future gener- 
ations would be a grave folly indeed. 
Our children will have little need of 
oysters turned green and reeking of oil.

THREE-STAR 
SYNTHETIC CUISINE

|. is already possible to 
foresee the day when man will be 
freed completely from all recourse to 
animals for his food and clothing,” 
wrote the distinguished Russian 
chemist Dimitri Mendeleyev, in 1875. 
Subsequent achievements of science 
have confirmed the validity of this bold 
prediction by the scientist who 
established the Periodic Table of 
chemical elements. To a large extent, 
synthetic fabrics have today replaced 
natural textiles, and the next task for 
science is to increase—and change— 
man's food resources by creating 
synthetic foods. 
  
ALEXANDER NESMEYANOV, former presi- 
dent of the U.S5.S.R. Academy of Sciences 
and member of its Praesidium, is founder 
and director of the Academy's Institute of 
Elementary Organic Compounds. For his 
achievements in chemistry and research he 
was awarded the State Prize in 1942 and the 
Lenin Prize in 1966. Professor Nesmeyanov 
is a member of many foreign scientific 
societies, including the Royal Society, London, 
the Royal Society of Edinburgh and the 
American Academy of Arts and Sciences. 
VASSILY BELIKOV is a specialist in the 
field of amino acid synthesis and theoretical 
organic chemistry. He is head of the laboratory 
for the synthesis of nutritional substances at 
the Institute of Elementary Qrganic Com- 
pounds (U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences). 
So far, chemistry has made no 
attempt to compete with agriculture. 
Instead, it plays an auxiliary role, 
seeking to provide agriculture with 
chemical fertilizers, pesticides, growth 
agents and products designed to 
preserve natural foodstuffs and im- 
prove their taste, appearance and 
digestibility. But basically, food 
production today is in no way different 
from what it was in the primitive 
communities of hunters and farmers. 
And yet the role which organic 
chemistry could play in providing man 
with a profusion and variety of foods 
has long preoccupied many of the 
world's leading scientists, 
Dimitri  Mendeleyev (1834-1907) 
declared: “As a chemist | am con- 
vinced that we can obtain nutritive 
substances by a direct combination of 
elements contained in the air, water 
and soil, not by the ordinary methods 
of agriculture, but in special factories. 
If the need for this has not yet been 
felt, it is because unused land still 
abounds everywhere... and | believe 
that the day when the density of the 
world's population reaches alarming 
proportions, man will learn to use the 
colossal mass of sea water around 
him to provide abundant food, before

More nourishing and cheaper 
synthetic food. In all probability, the 
first factories will be for the cultivation 
of primary organisms, similar to yeast, 
by the use of water, air, minerals and 
solar heat.” 
A similar idea was advanced by the 
French scientist Marcelin Berthelot, 
a 19th century pioneer of chemical 
synthesis. “The day will come,” he 
said, “when everyone will take for 
their meals a tablet of nitrogen, a small 
amount of fat, a little starch or sugar, 
and a bottle of aromatic flavouring, 
mixed according to taste. All these 
ingredients will be manufactured 
cheaply and in unlimited quantities in 
our factories. Food will thus be un- 
affected by good or bad seasons, 
neither by rain nor drought, neither 
by heat which withers plants nor 
frost which destroys all hope of 
their bearing fruit. Finally, all these 
products will be free from the patho- 
genic microbes which cause epidemics 
and threaten human life. When that 
day comes, chemistry will have brought 
about a revolutionary transformation 
in the world, the effects of which no 
one can foretell.” (“Science et Mo- 
rale,” 1897.) 
ls it still too soon to tackle 
the problem of creating synthetic foods? 
Let us take a look at a basic factor 
in the global equation of food and 
people: the needs of the individual 
human being in terms of nourishment? 
Apart from water, man needs five 
groups of basic elements—proteins, 
carbohydrates, fats, vitamins and 
mineral salts. As daily nourishment, 
an adult should have, on average, two 
litres of water, 80-100 grammes of 
protein, 400-500 grammes of carbo- 
hydrates and 80-100 grammes of fats. 
WHICH CAME FIRST, 
THE CHICKEN OR 
THE BACTERIA ? 
As for vitamins (0.1 gr. a day, excluding 
choline, of which 0.1 gr. is also 
needed) and salts (20 gr. in all, 
including 10 gr. of cooking salt), the 
needs are small and can be easily met. 
Synthetic foods must obviously 
include all the indispensable salts 
and vitamins which are already 
being produced on a large scale 
through chemical and microbiological 
processes. And with the present 
industrial manufacture of vitamins, it 
is clear that man has already entered 
the age of artificial, non-agricultural 
production of nutritious substances. 
The role of the other three groups 
of elements is to provide the human 
system with energy and “building 
materials.” The first function is largely 
carried out by carbohydrates and fats 
and the second by proteins. Here we 
have a major distinction between 
groups of nutritious substances, 
The carbohydrates and fats which 
provide energy are burned up during 
assimilation and lose their original 
chemical identity. Certain components 
of these two groups are interchange- 
able and the groups themselves can 
largely be replaced and transformed 
one into the other, by the human 
organism. 
Proteins are completely different. 
Turned into amino acids by the 
digestive system, they provide the 
body with the “bricks” which it needs 
to build its own proteins, of which 
eight out of a total of 20 (9 in the case 
of children) are indispensable. Food 
should contain all these amino acids 
in strictly controlled proportions. 
Proteins are thus the most expensive 
and deficient items in our human diet, 
their most valuable and rarest elements 
being the indispensable group of 
amino acids. 
Any pronounced protein deficiency, 
particularly if it is due to the absence 
in the diet of one or more indis- 
pensable amino acids, results in 
specific vitamin deficiency diseases 
such as kwashiorkor. Once restored, 
the missing amino acid re-establishes 
the balance and leads to a striking 
increase in the nutritive value of many 
proteins of vegetable origin. 
It should be noted that the 
synthesis of the protein component 
of food bears no relation, contrary to 
what one might expect, to the highly 
complex problem of synthesis of 
natural albumin. This is because the 
alimentary proteins undergo complete 
hydrolysis in the digestive system and 
go into the blood in the form of amino 
acids. 
0. can readily see, then, 
that the problem is reduced to either 
the microbiological synthesis of protein 
or the microbiological or chemical 
synthesis of amino acids which can 
then be used, in suitable doses, in the 
composition of synthetic diets. 
Such synthetic diets, consisting of 
amino acids, vitamins, minerals, glu- 
cose and linoleic acid ether, have been 
prepared by a U.S. scientist, Dr. Milton 
Winitz and tested on human beings 
over extended periods. They are used 
especially in the intravenous feeding 
of patients who, for one reason or 
another, cannot be fed normally. 
Here we have a true model of 
synthetic nutriment. Apart from its 
strictly medical application, its real 
significance is in showing that it is 
possible to be nourished by a proper 
mixture of synthetic substances each 
ingredient of which can be obtained 
by synthesis. 
Unfortunately the cost price of many

cells produced are then spun rapidly to separate them from the de-waxed 
oil which is returned to the refinery. Drying and extraction process 
then turns protein into a white and nearly tasteless powder, which can be 
incorporated into food. Extensive trials made by adding it to animal 
feed have been highly successful.

of them is still prohibitive which is 
explained by their limited production. 
Produced on a large scale and by 
more efficient methods, their price 
could easily be reduced, as has been 
the case with methionine, lysine and 
glutamic acid, the annual world 
production of which now exceeds 
100,000 tons at a price of only a 
few dollars per kilogramme. 
If all the other amino acids were 
manufactured at the same price, the 
daily needs per person would be met 
for about 50 cents. There is no 
reason why the reduction in cost could 
not be even greater—the present 
technique of producing amino acids, 
which is based on the cheap substance, 
nitromethane, seems very promising. 
The Institute of Elementary Or- 
ganic Compounds of the U.S.S.R. Aca- 
demy of Sciences and the Pedagogical 
Institute of Leningrad, among other 
research institutes, have developed 
the synthesis of all the amino acids 
from this substance. No less en- 
couraging possibilities are offered by 
the microbiological method, especially 
if the micro-organisms which produce 
amino acids can be switched from 
carbohydrate foods to hydrocarbons. 
A number of achievements in this 
direction have already been recorded. 
| - from agriculture, 
another technique exists for the pro- 
duction of proteins on an industrial 
scale : that provided by microbiology. 
Scientists in a number of countries 
(including France, U.K. and U.S.S.R) 
are already working on the production 
of fodder yeasts for which the raw 
material is provided by paraffins, one 
of the cheapest by-products of petrol- 
eum. Hydrocarbon yeast is exception- 
ally rich in protein. It contains over 
40 per cent compared with the 
30 per cent protein content of soya 
beans, the most nourishing of all 
agricultural products. 
The French scientist, Alfred Cham- 
pagnat, director of a Marseilles 
laboratory specializing in this research, 
was first to draw attention to the 
extraordinary possibilities of these 
yeasts in making up for the present 
protein deficiency: “The annual world 
shortage of animal protein can be 
estimated at three million tons. This 
corresponds to 15 million tons of beef 
cattle. For an annual production of 
1,000 million tons of petroleum it can 
be assumed that 700 million tons are 
paraffin based. The production of 
7 million tons of protein-vitamin 
concentrate, equivalent to 3 million 
tons of protein, would consume only 
1 per cent of these 700 million tons 
of petroleum.”

Proteins as everyone knows are fundamental to life. Every minute 
in each of the hundred million million cells in the human body, 
protein molecules perform thousands of complex reactions to keep 
the cells alive and healthy. Scientists have closely studied 
the structure of proteins and their building blocks, the amino acids, 
which enable living organisms to synthesize proteins. This 
model from the Paris science museum, the Palais de la Découverte, 
shows the complicated chain-like molecular structure of a protein.

SYNTHETIC CUISINE (Continued) 
 
The new chemistry of the gourmet 
interested in food for human consump- 
tion than in animal fodder? Here 
again, figures provide an explanation. 
Six million tons of synthetic protein 
are required annually to meet the 
needs of 250 million people; to 
nourish the same number of people 
with protein produced by stock farming 
would require the production of from 
50 to 100 million tons of dehydrated 
protein to feed the animals themselves. 
The problem facing chemists is the 
following: is it possible to transform 
a daily diet consisting of 100 grammes 
of protein, 450 grammes of carbo- 
hydrates, and 100 grammes of fats 
into food which, far from being less 
good and less varied, is even better 
and more varied than the usual fare? 
In other words, the problem is one of 
taste, smell and consistency. 
In their original state, practically all 
natural proteins are odourless and 
tasteless due to the fact that they are 
macromolecular substances and con- 
sequently non-volatile and odourless. 
The same applies to starchy macro- 
molecular carbohydrates and to fats. 
It is what is added to and mixed with 
our food which gives it a special smell 
and taste, and especially the sub- 
stances formed in the process of 
cooking. 
As we all know, the taste of any 
substance can be broken down into 
four main categories—sweet, salty, 
sour and bitter—which we identify 
through the taste-buds on our tongue. 
If we consider taste separately from 
smell, it is clear that any taste can be 
reproduced by a suitable addition of 
say, sugar, salt, acid and caffeine. 
However, the question of smell is 
a much more delicate problem because 
smell combines with taste to form 
flavour, which is really what makes 
food appetizing. In our everyday fare, 
flavour is obtained by heating or the 
addition of loca! spices (onion, garlic, 
paprika, parsley, celery) or tropical 
ones (pepper, ginger, cloves, etc.) 
The action of these substances is 
well known and corresponds to a 
simple principle. The effect of heating 
food is to form a mixture of substances 
giving off an attractive odour formed 
by dozens of volatile ingredients of 
which only a few are responsible for

the specific smell. This aroma can be 
reconstituted either by mixing the same 
quantity of ingredients or by heating 
certain amino acids and their mixtures 
with different sugars. 
We have found that the smell is 
enhanced when an unsaturated fatty 
acid is added to the mixture of amino 
acids. The characteristic odour of 
boiled beef or chicken casserole can 
be obtained in this way. Adding a 
trace of trimethylamino oxide produces 
the smell of salt water fish, and amino 
valeric aldehyde imitates the smell of 
boiled fresh water fish. 
The final problem is that of the 
consistency of food. A variety of 
methods now exist for making sophisti- 
cated imitations of standard human 
foods from synthetic proteins. In the 
United States, certain firms are selling 
soya protein products which simulate 
various parts of chickens and different 
cuts of beef. Our Institute has . 
developed a technique for making 
sturgeon caviar whose quality is 
practically indistinguishable from the 
real thing. In both cases, the methods 
used are borrowed from other bran-

ches of physics and the chemistry of 
macromolecular combinations. It can 
thus be seen that any alimentary 
protein can be turned into food which 
has the consistency and flavour of 
any animal protein. 
Let us imagine the day when a 
country's economy is based on the 
manufacture of synthetic food instead 
of on traditional methods of food 
production. A few huge factories 
sited in different parts of the country 
where coal and petroleum are to be 
found, prepare all the food required 
by the population. Altogether, these 
factories occupy barely a few hundred 
square miles. Agriculture with its need 
for a vast labour force and its hmited 
capacity for progress, has been 
abolished, with the exception perhaps 
of market gardens and horticulture, 
There is no longer any need for the 
vast industry which formerly provided 
agriculture with its equipment—tractors, 
machines, tools. Nor for the metal 
used in making them, nor for the fuel 
used to power them. Nor for chemical 
fertilizers, pesticides, etc. A large 
proportion of the population previously 
engaged in these industries and in 
agriculture itself is thus freed for more 
productive work. Only a minute part 
of this manpower is needed for the 
production of synthetic food. 
The old food industry gives way to 
an entirely new industry, infinitely 
more compact. No more bad years, 
poor harvests, unproductive land. No 
more calamitous losses due to climate, 
natural. catastrophes, parasites, plant 
diseases, all of which today still take 
their toll of a considerable part of 
every harvest, 
All the conditions are to hand for 
the transformation of villages into 
towns and towns into garden cities. 
Food products, ready to eat, packaged 
or tinned like the products on sale 
today, but with the fundamental 
difference that they contain the normal 
amount of vitamins and have the 
highest nutritive value, have only to 
be heated. 
The appearance of these dishes 
leaves nothing to be desired. With a 
standard composition (proteins, carbo- 
hydrates, fats, salts, vitamins) adapted 
to each age need, these foods are the 
best source of health and energy 
the human system can have, infinitely

better, at all events, than the best 
natural products. 
No more obesity, no more fatty 
degeneration of the heart, liver and 
other complaints of the kind. At the 
least sign of physical abnormality, 
special diets can be composed with 
more or less of one or other ingredient. 
Vast tracts of land previously 
reserved for crop growing give way 
progressively to forests and parks. 
The silting and drying up of rivers is 
stopped and the abundance of food 
products leads to the solution of the 
world shortage of drinking water which 
at present is steadily worsening. 
The society of the future gains on 
all fronts: economic, social and also 
moral, as the slaughter of animals, a 
cruel vestige of the past, is pro- 
gressively done away with. 
Naturally, this is only a brief 
glimpse of stimulating problems for 
which solutions will need to be 
found by the joint efforts of chemists, 
biologists, doctors and economists. 
Whatever success, even partial, is 
achieved in this direction, those efforts 
will be repaid a hundredfold.

HE How will radio communication be 
established between the hidden

HE How will research stations 
established on the moon 
communicate with each other? 
by Georges Phélizon 
  
GEORGES PHELIZON is director of long-term 
planning of the new applications of electro- 
nics at the Central Telecommunications Lab- 
oratory in Paris. From 1965 to 1968, he direct- 
ed the development and construction of the 
European scientific satellite, ESRO |, launch- 
ed into orbit on October 3, 1968, for the 
European Space Research Qrganization. 
Mr. Phelizon made a special study of the 
problem of communication on the moon for 
the conference of the International Academy 
of Astronautics, in New York in October 1968.

‘Radio communication on the moon 
will be a serious problem with the 
‘lack of atmosphere and ionosphere. 
How can science solve this? 
Tie recent success of 
Apollo 8, which circled the moon with 
three U.S. astronauts on board, was 
largely due to the power and quality of 
the remarkable telecommunications 
system planned and built by the U.S. 
civilian space agency, NASA. 
The most spectacular feature of the 
service provided by the system was 
undoubtedly the direct transmission to 
the world’s television networks of live 
shots showing life in the astronauts’ 
cabin, the low altitude flight across the 
face of the moon, and the earth as 
seen from its natural satellite. 
All this seems little short of miracu- 
lous when it is realized that the trans- 
mitter on board the spacecraft was no 
more powerful than that of a radio-taxi; 
at under 20 watts, it consumed hardly 
more power than an’ ordinary electric 
razor. 
Just as the reflector in a car head- 
lamp beams the light forward, the

reflector of Apollo’s transmitting aerial 
beamed the radiated energy to the 
earth, and thus magnified its intensity 
about 500-fold. 
But the moon is a long way off 
(240,000 miles, or nearly 10 times the 
earth's circumference) and over that 
distance radio waves are dispersed; so 
that they are so weak at the receiving 
end that they cannot be captured with 
an ordinary aerial. 
With the aid of a parabolic dish 
85 feet in diameter at the NASA 
station, at Goldstone, California 
their intensity was multiplied about 
100,000 times. This dish is mounted 
on a swivelling base, and can be 
aimed with great accuracy. Two iden- 
tical ground stations were set up at 
Madrid in Spain and at Canberra in 
Australia. 
Because of the rotation of the earth, 
the moon appears to be revolving 
around every point of our planet, and 
the geographical location of the listen- 
ing posts was therefore chosen to 
ensure that at all times at least one of 
these posts would be able to pick up

the signals. The three stations were 
linked by a high-reliability network to 
the Mission Control Centre at Houston, 
Texas, which was thus in constant 
touch with the spacecraft as it moved 
across the moon. 
Apart from the transmission of TV 
images and cross-talk between the 
astronauts and the flight controllers 
at the Houston mission direction 
centre, the telecommunications system 
played a vital part in ensuring the safe 
and successful accomplishment of the 
mission by keeping track of the space- 
craft's position and speed with a high 
degree of accuracy. 
The data it provided was fed to a 
battery of computers which, by compar- 
ing the spaceship’s actual flight path 
with the flight plan, could immediately 
signal any correction needed to keep 
Apollo 8 on correct course. And 
indeed, one aspect of the success of 
this intricate earth-moon mission, i.e., 
the precision with which the whole 
operation was executed, is a triumph of 
the computer; credit is due to the 
scientists and technicians who built 
and programmed the computer units. 
Thus, with the vital part played by 
radiocommunications in a reconnais- 
sance mission such as that of Apollo 8 
in mind, let us now look a few years 
ahead when man has established him- 
self on the moon. 
The short trips of 1969-1970 have 
been succeeded by longer and more 
sophisticated scientific expeditions. 
Lunar tourism, of course, is still a thing 
of the future. 
The lunar environment is hostile to 
man; there is no atmosphere, and man 
can move about only if garbed in a 
space-suit. During the lunar day, which 
lasts a fortnight, the temperature rises 
to something like 150° C; by night it 
falls to about minus 150° C. From the 
moon, the “full earth” appears four 
times as large as the “full moon” fami- 
liar to us all. 
| nae bases will probably 
be built in greater part underground, 
partly to offset the changes in tempera- 
ture and partly to give protection 
against radiation or falling meteorites. 
Exploring parties of scientists will 
travel about in curious, highly func- 
tional vehicles. 
For adequate scientific coverage, a 
number of bases will be needed on 
both the visible and the hidden sides 
of the moon. 
Here again, the role of telecommuni- 
cations in linking up the various bases 
and exploring parties as well as in 
connecting these lunar outposts with 
stations on earth will be of vital import- 
ance. 
Radiocommunication conditions un- 
fortunately are rather different from

The moon’s fickle gravitational field 
those we are used to; while it is easy 
on earth to arrange for a caller in Paris 
or New York to talk by short wave 
radio-telephone to a passenger on a 
liner crossing the Atlantic, the same 
equipment would have a range of only 
a few score miles on the moon. 
The chief reason is the absence of 
atmosphere on the moon; the earth's 
atmosphere plays an important part in 
using radio waves for communication 
purposes; the lower density of the air 
at higher altitudes acts somewhat like 
a prism, curving radio waves back to 
earth, and extending their range 
beyond the horizon. (There may well 
be planets where the atmospheric 
pressure is much higher than on the 
earth, in which case the prism effect 
would be so marked that radio or light 
waves would go right round the globe; 
this seems to be the case for Venus, 
in particular.) 
However, the most important factor 
for long distance communication on the 
earth is undoubtedly ionospheric 
reflection; under constant bombard- 
ment by various particles and radia- 
tions (especially ultra violet rays) 
emanating from the sun, gas atoms in 
the upper atmosphere are robbed of 
some of their electrons. 
When released, the electrons form 
conductive layers known as the iono- 
spheric layers, These were deduced 
as early as 1910 and experimentally 
confirmed in 1925; they reflect back 
towards the earth the radio waves 
which would otherwise escape. 
Fortunately for space communi- 
cations, the ionospheric barrier is not 
insuperable, and chiefly affects wave- 
lengths of roughly over six metres, 
that is, frequencies under 50 mega- 
hertz per second. 
It can thus be understood why the 
radio-telephone which makes it pos- 
sible to reach a liner in mid Atlantic

### 57802: Radio communication on the moon will be a serious problem with the lack of atmosphere and ionosphere; how can science solve this?

  
This diagram shows how two communication satellites, S-1 and S-2, could enable stations on the hidden 
face of the moon to communicate with the earth, and provide a radio link between research stations 
anywhere on the moon. These relay satellites could be established at certain points where the earth and 
moon cancel out each other's gravitational attraction (known as libration points), requiring only minimum 
corrections from time to time to keep them in position. The relay satellites would be placed in orbit 
at about 60,000 kilometres from the moon. At L-1, the lunar attraction LA combined with the centrifugal 
force of the satellite CF would balance the terrestial attraction TA. At L-2, the lunar attraction LA and 
the terrestial attraction TA offset the centrifugal force CF and would maintain the satellite in position.

would be useless on the moon, where 
there is neither atmosphere nor iono- 
sphere, so that all radio waves on the 
moon would escape freely into space. 
This is precisely one of the reasons 
why scientists are interested in install- 
ing radio-astronomy laboratories on the 
moon, as the “radio sky” would be 
clear for all frequency ranges. 
Does this mean that lunar explorers, 
will be completely cut off from the 
earth 7 The answer, fortunately, is no, 
since communications satellites provide 
a solution. Waves reflected by the 
Scientific expeditions travelling across the 
moon's surface will need specially-designed 
vehicles. Conventional lubrication would be 
useless since oil evaporates in the prevailing 
vacuum. Rubber tyres would crack or fry in 
temperature extremes. Above all, mobile 
machines will have to negotiate difficult terrain.

transmission of high quality TV images 
whereas satellites can do so even for 
intercontinental programmes. 
it will thus suffice to put a number of 
satellites in orbit round the moon to 
link up the scattered bases; but here 
again, conditions are not the same as 
on earth. The first TV relay satellites, 
placed in terrestrial orbit a few thous- 
and miles up, girdled the earth in a 
few hours; they could therefore 
connect only two stations at certain 
times and for very short periods. It

the Soviet Union, for example, follow a 
pronounced elliptical orbit thus consid- 
erably extending the time available 
for transmissions, which in the case of 
a link via satellite between Paris and 
Moscow can be maintained for up to 
six hours.

COMMUNICATION ON THE MOON (Continued) 
 
Sail-powered satellites operating on solar radiation 
period will be 24 hours; such a satel- 
lite, launched on an east-bound equa- 
torial orbit, will take just as long to go 
round the earth as the earth takes to 
spin on its axis: it will thus appear 
stationary. This is the case for “Early 
Bird" stationed above the Atlantic at 
27 degrees West. A stationary satellite 
will thus permit permanent connexions 
to be established, and it is very tempt- 
ing to transpose this solution to the 
moon. 
But, as everyone knows, the moon 
takes 28 days, not 24 hours, to rotate 
on its axis, which is why it always 
turns the same face towards us, the 
other side remaining invisible from the 
earth: for a satellite to revolve round 
the moon in 28 days, it would theoreti- 
cally have to be placed in orbit nearly 
62,500 miles up. In actual fact, this 
would be possible only if the moon 
were isolated in space, as the attrac- 
tion of the earth completely alters the 
situation. A satellite placed in such an 
orbit would rapidly escape from the 
moon's gravitational field. 
0. possibility would be to 
place our lunar communications satel- 
lite near enough to the moon for its 
attraction to exert a greater pull than 
the earth's; a suitable height would be 
something over 3,000 miles, giving the 
satellite a revolution of about 12 hours. 
The satellites would then revolve much 
faster than the lunar stations, and for 
quasi-permanent liaison, a dozen satel- 
lites would be needed. 
Another conceivable solution which 
has great appeal, as it leads back to 
almost stationary satellites, utilizes a 
relatively simple phenomenon of celes- 
tial mechanics known as libration 
points. If a body is close to earth it 
feels the gravitational pull of our planet 
(this is what we call weight). If the 
same body finds itself in the proximity 
of the moon, it is similarly attracted by 
the force of the moon. 
it is not difficult to imagine, there- 
fore, that there is some intermediary 
point where the force of attraction of 
the earth and the moon are equal in 
both directions, and therefore cancel 
each other out. In determining this 
point, actual calculations made also 
take into account an additional factor:

centrifugal force which tends to pull an 
object away from the earth, since the 
body together with the moon rotates 
around the earth in 28 days. 
Diagram on page 29 shows the first 
libration point L-1, at about 34,000 
miles from the moon in the direction 
of the ‘earth. It also shows a second 
point L-2, off the hidden side of the 
moon, where the centrifugal force 
counteracts the combined attraction of 
the moon and the earth. If a satellite 
S-2 is placed at L-2, it will thus be 
able to serve nearly all the bases 
established on the hidden face of the 
moon, but will not allow communication 
with the earth which is not visible 
from this point, since it is hidden by 
the moon. 
Man's creative genius has overcome 
this difficulty: satellite S-2 will not be 
placed exactly at L-2; it will be shifted 
a few thousands miles sideways, so as 
to be in sight of the earth; and even 
perhaps of L-1, where a second 
satellite S-1 will relay communications 
to the stations on the visible face of 
the moon. 
For both S-1 and S-2 to remain sta- 
tioned near the selected positions will 
require the use of an extremely low- 
powered position-correcting device

(less than 1 milligramme force per kilo- 
gramme of satellite). 
Such a low thrust can be produced 
by ion engines, but another possibility 
is to stabilize the satellites with sails. 
In “The Planet of the Apes,” by 
Pierre Boulle, the two chief characters 
roam across interplanetary space, pro- 
pelled by the pressure of the sun's 
rays on the sails of their spacecraft. 
Some American scientists have seri- 
ously considered equipping satellites 
placed near the libration points with 
sails which would maintain them in 
position thanks to the pressure of solar 
radiation.

The satellites would in fact describe 
a small individual orbit around the 
libration points to allow for the changes 
in the moon's and earth's position in 
relation to the sun in the course of the 
year. Calculations have shown that a 
sail area of one-third of a square metre 
per kilogramme of satellite would be 
sufficient to produce the force needed. 
To install on and around the moon 
all the components of the communic- 
ations networks briefly described here 
will demand many years, but this does 
not mean that the first scientific 
missions will be deprived of the means 
of communication. The powerful 
 
communications system installed on the 
earth to keep in touch with spacecraft 
could provide similar services to moon 
stations on the visible face of the 
moon, and could also be used even 
to interconnect them. In that case, 
since the velocity of radio waves is 
187,500 miles per second, a lapse of 
about five seconds between question 
and answer would have to be allowed 
for in telephone conversations between 
two points on the moon via the earth. 
Of course, other means of commun- 
ication used on earth before the 
satellite era began could also be used 
on the moon. But it appears unlikely 
that they will be used to link points 
more than a few dozen kilometres 
apart. 
T.e most simple idea would 
be to lay a telephone cable on the 
lunar surface, but the operation would 
be far from easy. 
Another possibility would be to use 
pylons brought from earth, or the 
mountains of the moon to install radio 
relays similar to those first used around 
1950 as boosters for long distance TV 
transmissions through microwave radio 
links. But as the moon's radius is 
only a fourth that of the earth, the 
transmission range would be only half 
that on earth, and a larger number 
of relays would be needed. Each relay 
would also have to contain its own 
long-duration unattended electric power 
supply. This of course will be rather 
difficult in the lunar environment. 
Finally, we must not forget that every 
piece of equipment used on the moon 
will have to come “from the sky.” As 
the moon has no atmosphere, the only 
way to slow down a lunar-bound 
spaceship is to brake it by firing a 
rocket engine. So it may be more 
economical to use equipment placed in 
lunar orbit rather than land it on the 
moon. Another consideration is that 
climatic conditions in lunar orbit may 
well be far more temperate than those 
on the moon's surface. 
Both these factors point to satellites 
as the best solution, and in our opinion 
the full scale use of lunar bases, parti- 
cularly on the hidden side of the moon, 
will not be feasible until such time as 
communication satellites have been set 
up in the vicinity of the moon.

### 188409: The New food revolution

THE NEW FOOD REVOLUTION (continued from page 12) 
decade in the conversion of fish into 
seafoods for indirect or direct human 
consumption have been little short of 
spectacular. Large quantities of fish 
are now converted into meal, which is 
in turn indirectly consumed in the 
convenient protein form of meat, eggs 
and chicken, 
Fish protein concentrate (FPC), a 
high protein powder made from other- 
wise inedible fish, is also highly 
suitable for direct consumption by 
people. FPC is dry, can be stored 
indefinitely and transported convenient- 
ly without wastage. Both tasteless and 
odourless it is suitable as an additive 
to other foods such as breakfast 
cereals. Added to animal foods, it 
will lower the production cost of 
meats, poultry and eggs by shortening 
the growing period and improving their 
quality. 
Ec more important inves- 
tigations are currently being made in 
the U.S.S.R. and Japan into the possibi- 
lities of exploiting the vast quantities 
of Antarctic krill, Euhausia superba. 
This small shrimp, about five centi- 
metres long, is the main food of the 
balloon whale. Rough calculations, 
based partly on estimates of the 
quantities that must have been eaten 
by whales before whaling drastically 
reduced their number, suggest that the 
annual yield of krill could be at least 
50 million tons—or about the equi- 
valent of the entire world fish catch at 
present. 
Soviet experiments show that catch- 
ing the krill in quantities may be quite 
easy and that an acceptable form of 
meal for animal feeding can be produc- 
ed. A more interesting prospect is 
that, if the technical problems of separ- 
ating the meat from the shell can be 
resolved, krill may be used for direct 
human consumption. Properly present- 
ed, in the form of imitation lobster 
tails, for example, it would appeal to 
the rapidly growing number of con- 
sumers of the much similar prawns, 
shrimps and other crustaceans. 
Much has been made these days of 
advancing fishing from the primitive 
stage of hunting to the stage of agri- 
culture. All the many forms of farming 
—pastoral, ranching, intensified gar- 
dening and factory farming—have their 
marine equivalents. Oysters, mussels 
and shrimp have long been raised 
in shoreline ocean beds and on ropes 
suspended from special rafts, just as 
the Japanese systematically have for 
centuries raised and harvested large 
quantities of nori (a highly nutritious 
edible seaweed) in their bays and 
inlets. And recently in Britain there 
has been an increasing interest in 
intensive marine farming of battery 
plaice and sole. 
The importance of sea farming is 
primarily that fish can be raised with 
relatively cheap food. Unlike chicken, 
which can have no more than about 
5 per cent of fish meal without tast- 
ing of fish, the diet of plaice or sole 
can presumably contain much more 
fish meal or other products—includ- 
ing perhaps meal from krill. 
Last autumn, a subsidiary of an 
Anglo-Dutch food-detergents manufac- 
turer, put the first crop from its fish 
farm at Loch Ailort in the western 
Scottish Highlands on the U.K. market. 
In its initial stage of fish-raising, the 
firm is now concentrating on raising 
rainbow trout—but with a difference. 
Trout farming in fresh water is a well- 
established industry in many countries. 
But Loch Ailort trout are raised in sea 
water and the largest—a little over 
two years old—tip the scales at 5.5 Ibs. 
each. Not only do the salt water trout 
get bigger faster, but due to the careful 
regulation of their diet, the trout have 
delicate pink flesh resembling salmon. 
Understandably, these pioneer ef- 
forts in fish farming have been concen- 
trated on the highest priced varieties, 
but with a fish farm of eight square 
miles able to produce more fish than 
are presently caught in the entire North 
Sea, the business could soon take on 
massive proportions including a wide 
variety of popularly priced seafoods. 
This emergent aquicultural revolution 
has its parallel in British agriculture, 
and Britain's “convenience” food 
industry has played a major role in 
both. The experimental and develop- 
mental fish farming was a logical out- 
growth of the heavy investment in the 
British frozen foods industry. 
To meet the tight standard specifi- 
cations, the introduction of new varie- 
tal strains and improved growing tech- 
niques have also produced substantial 
vield increases in all crops grown 
under contract for the convenience 
food industry. Pea yields, for exam- 
ple, have risen by more than 40 per 
cent while other crops such as spin- 
ach and broad beans have increased 
even more. 
Forward planning of the industry, 
with its ability to forecast sales and 
plan production tonnages, has brought 
a measure of stability to vegetable 
growing never before known. Like- 
wise, as a result of the development 
of convenience foods, average output 
of poultry in Britain more than doubled 
during the past ten years. 
But a comparison of per capita 
British consumption of frozen foods in 
1967 (11.4 |bs.) with consumption in 
the U.S. (68.0 Ibs.) indicates that the 
convenience food revolution in the 
U.K. has just really got underway. And 
the same conclusions can be drawn 
for Sweden (22.7 lbs), Switzerland 
(15.4 Ibs.), and Denmark (11.4 Ibs). 
In all other European countries and 
the lesser-developed countries it has 
hardly begun. What is true for frozen 
foods, largely holds for the entire 
range of convenience foods and the 
catering industry. 
Consider further that the U.S. is 
on the threshold of still another stage 
in the revolutionary development of 
the convenience food industry. What 
are considered convenience foods now 
will be dwarfed by what will be accept- 
ed as convenience foods only a decade 
from now. 
In spite of the critical dimensions of 
the world food situation at present, 
food production is already the world’s 
greatest success story. Most develop- 
ed countries have solved their basic 
problems—with the possible exception 
of the problem of mounting surpluses, 
Ts great achievement of 
the past two decades can be attributed 
to reliance, not on grandiose theories, 
but on treating food production as a 
business—from the farm, to the pro- 
cessing stage and distribution—all 
requiring respected skills and capital 
inputs which are essential to ultimate 
success, 
FAO Director-General Addeke H. 
Boerma recently said that he saw no 
intrinsic reason why yields in most 
developing countries should not grow 
at the same rate as those in the 
advanced and largely temperate areas. 
Nature has been “reasonably impar- 
tial” in distributing her riches, both 
natural and human. We have the 
knowledge of technology, and, hope- 
fully, the understanding of human na- 
ture necessary to assure that the world 
will in the future be well fed. Through 
the close co-operation of governments 
and private business, of all nations, 
the last three decades of the twentieth 
century can go down in history as 
the age of the revolution that achieved 
this monumental feat.

UNESGORNEWS ROOM 
World anti-pollution 
conference 
Sweden, supported by 50 co-sponsoring 
nations, has asked the United Nations to 
organize an international conference in 1972 
on man's pollution of the world. Sweden 
hopes the conference will promote measures 
against contamination of the environment, 
dispel public ignorance and apathy towards 
this increasingly critical problem, and 
also cut down costly duplication of world 
pollution research while giving it a common 
outlook and direction. 
Norway aids Indian 
cancer project 
One million kroner has been given by 
Norway to India for a new, “early detection” 
cancer control project near Madras (80 per 
cent of India's cancer patients seek help 
too late). Under the scheme, 100,000 
people. will be examined. 
Rabies menace 
Rabies caused 637 deaths in 92 countries 
in 1967, 62 less than in 1966. But these 
WHO figures represent only one-fifth to 
one-tenth of the actual deaths caused 
by rabies. Sixty-three countries report 
rabies on theijr territory, and 560,000 people 
have received anti-rabies vaccinations. 
Foxes, dogs, bats and skunks are major 
carriers of the disease. 
Population growth 
vs. economic growth 
To help developing countries reduce 
population growth, and so speed up econo- 
mic development, the, World Bank has set 
up a new programme to finance facilities 
for family planning projects, and to c¢o- 
operate in research on the most effective 
family planning methods. 
Japan's talking’ computer 
A major breakthrough in computer dev- 
elopment has been made at Kyoto Univer- 
sity, Japan where scientists and engineers 
have developed a “talking” computer. 
The main innovations are, an automatic 
translating device which has memorized 
the grammatical rules of English and Japan- 
ese, and a voice-producing mechanism 
with 550 vocal factors. When a question 
in English printed on tape is fed into the 
computer, its mechanical voice can either 
translate the question, or give the answer 
in Japanese. 
Lilliputian carving in ivory 
An almost incredible piece of miniature 
ivory carving is featured in a current 
exhibit at the National Palace Museum at 
Taipei, Taiwan {Republic of China). It 
consists of an outer box no larger than 
1.68 by 2.9 by 3.48 centimetres with nine 
smaller boxes inside, all with different 
latticed decoration. Water-chestnuts, 
pomegranates, mushrooms and “Buddha- 
fingers” (a fruit), no longer than .3 centi- 
metres are stored in the boxes, some 
attached to chains as thin as a piece of 
thread. Also on display are miniature 
animals of jade and semi-precious stones 
and diminutive albums of paintings and 
calligraphy, all selected, like the box, 
from the collection of trinkets, curios and 
miniatures of an 18th century Chinese 
ruler, Emperor Ch'ien-lung.

Letters to the Editor 
LIFETIME OF PUNISHMENT 
 
Sir, 
In your issue on Human Rights 
(November 1968), you published the 
picture of a slave wearing a kind of 
muzzle over his mouth. In my opinion 
the poor man was made to wear the 
device not as a punishment, but to 
prevent him from eating soil. 
In many countries slaves were al- 
ways hungry and many tried to fill 
their stomachs with soil; in the long 
run this caused their death. 
Their whole life was a punishment. 
Jan Miller 
Amsterdam, Netherlands 
REGRETTABLE OMISSION 
 
Sir, 
From its title, “Human Rights”, | 
expected the “Unesco Courier” for 
November 1968 would prove to be an 
outstanding number. On reading it, 
| was greatly upset by an omission 
which to my mind is both incompre- 
hensible and inexcusable. 
The passages you published from 
“The Right to be a Man" quoted the 
words of Gandhi, Marx, Mohammed 
and the Talmud, among other sources, 
but not a single word of Jesus Christ, 
who sacrificed his life for the salva- 
tion of mankind. 
This omission is indeed regrettable 
in a magazine of such broad scope 
and readership. 
Lucien Moulin 
Al-Attaf, Algeria 
See “The Golden Rule”, December 
1968 issue, page 49—=Editor. 
FREDERIC JOLIOT-CURIE 
AND THE ATOM 
 
Sir, 
I was interested to read your issue, 
“Peaceful Uses of the Atom™ (July- 
August 1968) which summarizes pre- 
sent achievements in this field and 
outlines prospects for the future. But 
| was sorry to find no mention of 
Frederic Joliot-Curie, 
This great French scientist spoke 
out against any use of the atom other 
than for peaceful purposes. As early 
as 1949 he declared: “If in the future 
| want to be able to engage in re- 
search, and if 1 want young people 
to be able to devote themselves to 
research without misgivings and under 
the best conditions, it will be ne- 
cessary to build a society which rec- 
ognizes the true role of science, a 
society in which war will not only be 
impossible, but unthinkable. This res- 
ponsibility | cannot delegate to others 
and, in the final analysis, it is science 
itself that 1 am defending.” 
The article by I. H. Usmani (Charting 
the Nuclear Labyrinth) retraces the 
history of research on artificially creat- 
ed radioactivity, but omits any refer- 
ence to the work of Iréne and Frédé- 
ric Joliot-Curie in 1934, which earned 
them the Nobel Prize the following 
year. 
The author mentions the research of 
the German scientists, Otto Hahn and 
Fritz Strassmann, who discovered that 
when slow neutrons hit uranium 235, 
the nucleus splits in two, releasing 
energy. The research of Hahn and 
Strassmann, in fact, began where that 
of P. Sairtch and Iréne Joliot-Curie left 
off. Moreover, reservations were 
expressed on the results of ther 
experiments. It was Jeliot-Curie who 
immediately formulated the fundamen- 
tal theories on fission, who invented 
the apparatus which demonstrated 
the reality of the phenomenon and 
who photographed the trajectory of 
a particle produced by fission. The 
way to the use of atomic energy 
was finally opened by Joliot-Curie's 
research with Halban and Kowarski 
in 1939. 
In my view, failure to give these 
facts shows a lack of objectivity. It 
is to be regretted that Joliot-Curie was 
ostracized in his own country for 
declaring that his work on the atom 
would be devoted solely to peaceful 
research, and a similar ostracism 
should not be shown by a magazine 
which, according to its own definition, 
is “a window open on the world,” 
and which, in its July-August 1968 
number, merely restated the general 
principles formulated by this distin- 
guished and deeply humanistic scien- 
tist.

THE FORCE OF PUBLIC OPINION 
Sir, 
Unesco strives unremittingly to ac- 
complish its great mission, so that 
everyone may enjoy the nght to edu- 
cation, so that all men, transcending 
frontiers and continents, may learn to 
understand and respect one another, 
so that the vestiges of the past may 
be preserved to enrich a world 
cultural heritage. 
The “Unesco Courier's” task—and 
major responsibility—is to make those 
efforts known as widely as possible 
and to promote international under- 
standing. To this end, it is better for 
the magazine to eschew political 
problems and to open its columns to 
authors from every country, express- 
ing every view-point. 
When basic human rights are vio- 
lated, however, the “Unesco Courier” 
does not remain silent. In its March 
1967 number, it took a positive stand 
against the policy of Apartheid in 
South Africa. In “30 Questions on 
Human Rights” (January 1968) it stat- 
ed: “The main instrument at the dis- 
posal of the international community... 
Is exposure to world public opinion.” 
And in the same issue, Sean MacBride 
wrote, in "The New Frontiers of Inter- 
national Law,” “No dictator or authori- 
tarian regime can now remain immune 
from the impact of world public 
opinion.” 
This applies not only to racial discri- 
mination but to every other violation 
of human rights. 
All free men and women are still 
shocked by recent events in eastern 
Europe. A small country which set 
out courageously to chart its own 
course was occupied by foreign 
troops; a government vested with the 
confidence of an entire people—a rare 
phenomenon indeed—is no longer able 
to take its decisions freely. How can 
we reconcile these events with the 
image of the Soviet Union presented 
in your November 1967 number, 
“U.8.8.R. Today?” 
Little courage is needed to protest 
against the racial policy of South Afri- 
ca. It is isolated and shunned by other 
nations. It takes far more courage to 
condemn the intervention in Czecho- 
slovakia. | know that a number of 
agreements and conventions can be 
quoted to justify the legality of this 
intervention. But, legal points apart, 
the fact remains that the occupation of 
Czechoslovakia, viewed objectively, is 
a blow against human rights. 
This occupation is not an internal 
matter for the socialist countries. If 
such were the case, then the policy 
of Apartheid could equally well be 
considered as an affair that concerned 
South Africa alone. The occupation 
of Czechoslovakia is a very different 
question, an event that vitally concerns 
all who are resolved to preserve the 
rights and hberties they hold dear. 
| would ask you to add your support 
to public opinion. Condemn without 
reserve the occupation of Czecho- 
slovakia, so that when we look back 
on International Year for Human Rights, 
1968, we may do so without a sense 
of shame.

IN THE EPIC TRADITION 
Sir, 
Congratulations on the issue, devot- 
ed to the “Two Great Epics of Asia, 
Ramayana and Mahabharata,” (Decem- 
ber 1967). | have just re-read your 
brilliant and unusual account of these 
two great Eastern epics. | personally 
am a lover of the epic tradition in 
literature. The study of literature must 
begin from sources which are close to 
a people, a nation, a civilization. 
Would that more such studies were 
carried out for the, benefit of all people 
proud of an undying and rich culture 
and tradition. Would a similar treat- 
ment of the Greek epics—I/liad and 
Odyssey—be possible in your maga- 
Zine?
