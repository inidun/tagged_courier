A new Courier 
magazine you are holding is 
the trial issue of the new bi-annual 
UNESCO Courier. We hope readers 
will find it has the same rigorous standards and open- 
minded approach that the old monthly magazine was 
admired for over several decades. We also hope you like 
the changes we have made such as: 
BM A lighter and more flexible layout, lending itself to both 
a quick glance - at titles, intros, excerpts, captions, brief 
items - and a good read. 
Bl New sections -such as Zoom, UNESCO in the news and 
Partners- that will feature in each issue, giving different 
angles on UNESCO'’s various activities. 
HB A new system of distribution too for a magazine that 
is now free of charge, through UNESCO’s regional offices 
and National Commissions, and the many other networks 
the Organization is linked to around the world. The 
magazine will be chiefly aimed at these key partners. 
Each issue will include articles about topics linked to each 
one of UNESCO's fields of activity - education, culture, 
communication, the social and exact sciences — written by 
journalists from our Bureau of Public Information. It will 
also contain a feature dossier put together by a specially 
chosen guest editor. In this issue we discuss some of 
the major challenges to be faced in the 21st century and 
next October we will focus on Afghanistan. 
We wish you an interesting read and thank in advance 
those of you who will send us comments, suggestions and 
criticisms.

Moscow alone has 
50,000 homeless,

from the former

since a 1999 law 
banned non-

running orphanages, 
the city has had just 
three such facilities, 
with a total of 
250 beds. Moscow's

6d jobs vs. schoolwork 
An “International 
Study on the 
Sciences and 
Mathematics” 
conducted in the 
United States shows 
that students’ 
abilities decline as 
  
they reach junior 
and, especially, 
senior high school. 
One possible 
reason: 55 percent 
of seniors (most of 
whom are 17 years 
old) work at least 
three hours a week, 
whereas that 
percentage never 
exceeds 18percent 
anywhere else. 
However, the New 
York Times reports, 
although youth 
employment may 
harm school 
performance, it is 
vital for the 
economy and 
impossible to call 
into question 
because teenagers 
work neither to 
round out their 
families’ income, 
nor to pay for 
school, but to 
finance leisure 
activities and 
purchase clothes, 
which is a US $150 
billion market.

Killer particles 
Up to a fifth of all 
lung cancer deaths 
in cities are caused 
by pollution mostly 
from vehicle 
exhausts, according 
to the biggest study 
conducted on the 
problem. By 
tracking half a 
million Americans 
from more than 
100 cities for more 
than 16 years, 
researchers studied 
the impact of tiny 
particles, less than 
2.5 micrometres in 
diameter, that 
lodge deep in the 
lungs. In cities like 
  
Los Angeles and 
New York, these 
particles range 
from 16 to 20 
micrograms per 
cubic metre, even 
though the limit 
set by the U.S. 
Environmental 
Protection Agency 
is 15. The new 
research has found 
that for every 10- 
microgram 
increase, the 
death-rate from 
  
» 
lung cancer rises 
by eight percent. 
The new study 
reveals that the 
situation is far 
more dangerous 
than previously 
understood, 
especially in 
developing 
countries, where 
air pollution in 
many cities has 
reached high levels 
and shows no 
signs of abating.

The biggest census ever; 
Disesvering life on earth 
Taking their cue 
from international 
efforts to decode 
the human 
genome, an 
international group 
of taxonomists, led 
by Edward O. 
Wilson of Harvard 
University, has 
formed the All 
Species Foundation 
to complete a 
global biodiversity 
map within 
25years at an 
estimated cost of 
US $3 billion. The 
aim is to build a 
single catalogue of 
every living 
species, from 
bacteria to 
vertebrates, by 
combining results 
of individual 
taxonomic projects 
and hiring more 
researchers in the 
field. There are 
now only about 
10,000 active 
   
taxonomists. Less 
than two million 
species have been 
identified out of at 
least 10 million and 
perhaps as many 
as 100 million. 
The foundation 
will also focus on 
updating 
taxonomic 
techniques, notably 
through the use of 
new software. 
Instead of sending 
samples and slides 
  
from one research 
centre to another, 
researchers could 
use digital and 3-D 
imaging techniques 
to exchange and 
verify data on new 
species at a 
fraction of the 
current cost. By 
2007, the 
foundation hopes 
to identify 60,000 
new species every 
year, up from the 
current 15,000.

this study. In mid

200 metres thick and 
had a surface area of 
3,250 km?, broke apart 
in less than a month. 
Scientists were shocked 
by the speed of the col-

atmospheric and ocean 
warming, noting that 
region has warmed 
2.5 degrees in just

B collapsed, a monster

Education systems need reinventing. From the courses being taught 
to the schools they are taught in. Author and award winning journalist 
Reva Klein is the Chair of the International Consortium on School 
In the USA, one child in 
four leaves school without 
that most basic of 
necessities - a high school 
diploma 
What do you mean when you speak 
of disaffected students? 
> They're the ones who slam the 
door on their education. Not just the 
kids who walk away from school, but 
also the those who drop out in their 
minds. The young people who feel 
alienated from the school 
environment or the curriculum for 
example and who switch off, who’re 
not engaged with the syllabus, not 
engaged socially. In the education 
system, they take one of four routes. 
Either they are pushed out - excluded 
—- or they truant persistently, fail their 
exams or drop out before taking 
UNESCO | the new Courier | May 2002 
Disaffection, which aims at making education 
more humane, and more relevant 
them. Whatever direction they go in , 
they face a precarious future, dogged 
by stigma, no qualifications and low 
self-esteem. 
You've looked mainly at the situation 
in the United Kingdom, the USA 
How serious is the problem in those 
countries? 
> In the UK, according to official 
figures, nearly 20 percent of 14 to 19 
year-olds are out-of-school without 
any qualifications. They’re not in any 
sort of vocational training, and 
they’re not working. They're referred 
to as a being at “status zero”. 
Unofficially, their numbers are 
probably much higher. 
At the same time, and even though 
the government has committed itself to 
social inclusion, the number of pupils 
being shown the door has risen 
inexorably over the past decade. In 
1990/91, 2,910 children were excluded 
from English schools; by 1996/97 the 
number had skyrocketed to 12,700, and 
1,600 of them were primary students. 
In the United States, an average 25 
percent of 13 year olds fail to graduate 
from high school. But this figure hides 
big differences between states and 
cities. In New York City and 
Washington D.C’s public schools, the 
figure is a staggering 45 percent. This 
means that one child out of every four 
in the United States leaves school 
without that most basic of American 
necessities, a high school diploma. 
Who are the young people 
dropping out? 
> There are no simple profiles, but 
there are a number of factors that 
keep cropping up. 
The home and social environment 
and family circumstances are 
obviously critical. The US

Reva Klein: fighting for the status zero group 
example, reports that around half of 
all families on welfare are headed by 
early school leavers. 
Race and ethnicity can also be major 
hurdles. In the U.K. disproportionate 
numbers of African Caribbean children 
are doing badly - although they don’t 
necessarily drop-out of their education. 
Gypsy and Traveller children are 
particularly at risk of failing and 
dropping out, even though they, like 
African Caribbeans, start their 
schooling on a positive note. 
In the US, although the situation 
for black children is still far from 
acceptable, it has dramatically 
improved over the last three decades. 
The latest figures show that about 13 
percent of young black students drop 
out, as against 40 percent in the 
1970s. On the other hand, the drop- 
out rate for young Latinos in the mid 
1990s was around 30 percent making 
them the worst hit ethnic group for 
dropout figures. 
Gender is another indicator for 
school disaffection and 
underachievement. In the United 
States, “special education” classes for 
underachieving and disruptive 
students ar-85 percent male. 
Young people living in foster 
situations or in the care of a local 
authority are one of the highest risk 
groups. In the UK over a quarter of 
14 to 16 year olds in care are either 
persistent truants or have been 
excluded from school, and between 
half and three quarters of those 
leaving a foster or care situation have 
no educational qualifications. 
That's not really surprising though. 
Kids in underprivileged situations 
have always faced these sorts of 
difficulties. What's new? 
 
First, although they probably 
make up the bulk of dropouts and 
disaffected students, young people in 
socially difficult situations are not the 
  
  
a 
A te 
9 
only ones that don’t make it. There 
are plenty of “mom and pop” kinds 
of kids who’re also dropping out, or 
are disaffected. 
Perhaps what’s new though is our 
concern over the situation, and our 
understanding of the high cost of 
disaffection. As an example, almost 
95 percent of boys in young offender 
institutions in the UK have either 
been excluded from school, 
persistently truanted or dropped out 
before reaching their 16th birthday 
(and every young offender costs at 
least £75,000 per year to keep in 
prison). Girls who become alienated 
from school run an increased risk of 
getting pregnant. Britain holds the 
worst records in western Europe for 
teenage pregnancies at 33 births for 
every thousand girls aged between 15 
and 19: five times the rate of Holland.

development, their capacity to 
survive and lead a fulfilling life in our 
so-called knowledge societies - where 
knowledge is the key to a country’s 
economic and social development, 
but also the key to individual 
empowerment, to a decent job, home 
and lifestyle. 
That we still have such a significant 
dropout problem in those countries 
that supposedly have the capacity to 
provide an education for all, means 
that what we are providing isn’t good 
enough. It means that schools are not 
in tune with what young people need 
and want today. It means that teachers 
are not well enough equipped with the 
understanding and skills to deal with 
the problems and difficulties of young 
people; that schools are not providing 
the right environment for children to 
develop as citizens. 
What can be done to reconnect 
kids with education? 
> Clearly if the tide is to turn, so too 
must policies, attitudes, structures. 
The system must be more responsive 
to the various needs, backgrounds 
and abilities of all students while not 
compromising standards and 
expectations for the more able end of 
the spectrum. The response must be 
comprehensive in scope. 
Concretely, that means designing 
education systems that are more

flexible. It means making schools 
truly democratic — and that goes 
beyond the simple establishment of 
school councils. We should be 
striving for is real participation in the 
classroom. We need to open schools 
to the outside community and to 
parents. And we need to pay much 
more attention to individual children 
and have mechanisms in place to get 
them the expert help they need as 
early as possible. Kids on the skids 
need monitoring by properly trained 
people. It’s been well established that 
a “significant” adult in a child’s life 
can turn them around. 
Are there any examples that could 
show us the way forward? 
“>There are plenty. In Europe, 
Denmark’s education system takes 
top marks. The system is based on 
mutual respect between teacher and 
pupil and a culture of dialogue: the 
teachers don’t just stand up in front 
of the class - children work with 
them and with each other in a 
collaborative effort. There’s no 
grading system, no high stakes 
testing. It’s a system that also offers 
strong vocational programmes to 
students. Denmark’s drop out rate is 
only 4.3 percent. 
While the US is home to some of 
the worst results and practices, it is 
also where some of the best work is 
being done. In New Haven 
(Connecticut), a compulsory 
programme of social and emotional 
learning for children from six to 18 - 
teaching skills required for decision- 
making, peer relationships, problem- 
solving, resisting drugs and alcohol, 
stress management, self-control, 
violence prevention and sexuality - 
has reaped amazing results. Between 
1992 and 1996, the numbers of sixth 
graders having to repeat a grade was 
cut by ten percent. The number of 
fourth graders achieving good or 
excellent results in tests of their verbal

and non-verbal skills jumped from 41 
to 72 percent. Dropout rates, 
suspensions and exclusions all fell, the 
number of kids carrying guns to 
school dropped by half. 
In Australia, multi-agency 
approaches are turning up good 
results. Schools are linking up with 
public and private welfare 
organizations and community groups 
to bring kids in difficulty the support 
services they and their parents may 
need, and opening up different 
learning opportunities. 
Cooperation, collaboration and 
coherence are also the pillars of a 
model being used successfully in 
Holland, which aims to help young 
people in difficulty to overcome some 
of the disadvantages —- economic and 
cultural for example, that may hold 
them back. The main idea is that the 
fewer the differences between the 
ethos and experiences at school, at 
home and in the community, the 
greater the progress of children’s 
development. And because of the 
enormous resources available to 
schools, it is there where the ultimate 
responsibility for creating educational 
opportunities lies.

### 125735: Schools are failing our children

  
Aren’t these rather piecemeal 
solutions for a problem that is 
becoming more complex and truly 
international? 
 
>There are so many pedagogically 
and psychologically sound approaches 
being used in diverse corners of the 
world to engage young people in their 
learning that not a single spoke of yet 
another wheel needs to be invented. 
It’s all there for the taking, if we know 
where to look for them and how to 
adapt them to our particular needs. 
In an ideal world, for example, the 
education system in Taiwan, say, will 
admit that though it produces top 
marks internationally in math and 
science, the creative expression of the 
children there has been sacrificed in 
the process to their detriment. So it 
will look to, for example, a school in 
Tennessee (USA) using the Leonard 
Bernstein Center model, in which the 
curriculum is delivered through the 
arts, and borrow some of the 
methodologies from there. At the 
same time, pre-school educators in 
Britain will reassess the wisdom of 
introducing literacy and numeracy to 
four year olds and look at Hungary, 
where children attain higher test 
' "We need to 
| pay much more 
attention 
to individual 
children” 
scores although they start reading 
and number work two to three years 
later. And in the same hour, a 
secondary school in Caracas 
(Venezuela) with a heavy caseload of 
truancy, underachievement and 
disruptive behaviour will look to the 
multi-agency support systems 
practiced in Western Australia. There, 
no child is left to suffer or drift off, 
because assessment of all students 
ensures that a myriad of problems are 
identified and dealt with in different, 
student-friendly ways. 
Children of the future, like those of 
the present, will need to communicate 
well, to interact at sophisticated levels 
with others, to solve problems 
creatively and to be flexible and 
imaginative in their thinking. For that 
to happen, schools need to see them 
and treat them as individuals, helping 
them to deal with the baggage that 
they’re bringing in with them 
everyday and stimulating them so that 
they will want to learn. For unless 
school learning is seen as part of a 
continuum in the context of each 
child’s life, it will remain stuck in the 
19th century, where it remained for 
most of the 20th. 
The International Consortium 
on School Disaffection, was 
created last October under the 
auspices of the National Dropout 
Prevention Centre based in 
Clemson, South Carolina (USA). 
Reva Klein is the chair. 
The consortium is a multi- 
disciplinary group of academics, 
psychologists, researchers and 
practitioners working in the area of 
disaffection from the US, Europe, 
Asia, the Caribbean and Africa. 
Their rationale is to discuss our 
common concerns and challenges 
and to explore strategies. While Fein te 
education systems and 11 
they represent a diverse range of 
philosophies working within equally 
diverse political systems and 
economies, they recognize that 
school disaffection is a 
phenomenon that transcends these 
differences and unites them. 
They don’t function solely as a 
talking shop, although annual 
meetings and online 
communications allow for plenty of 
lively and informative discussion. 
The organization also wants to 
foster possibilities for 
educationalists to visit each other's 
countries to observe different ways 
of tackling familiar problems and 
then feed back and possibly adapt 
those strategies to meet their 
schools’ needs. 
At the forthcoming national 
conference in San Diego in 
September, the Consortium will 
announce the launch of the 
International Journal on School 
Disaffection, the first journal of its 
kind to be published anywhere.

has above all helped the Cambodians to become reconciled with each other

1 he I pray here, my spirit flies up to 
C/A heaven and I see Buddha,” says 
78-year-old Heanj Tan, as she valiantly climbs 
down the perilous stone steps of Bayon, the main 
temple of Angkor Thom. This elderly woman, 
illiterate and with failing eyesight, seems happy to 
be detached from the Earth, where she has seen so 
much death. All her family disappeared, some of 
them massacred “under Pol Pot’s regime” 
(1975-1979). She survived and prayed often in the 
pagoda of Kompong Chnang until one day Angkor 
Wat appeared to her in a dream. 
“It was two years ago,” she says. “I saw the wat 
(pagoda in Khmer) very clearly, in my eyes and in 
my heart, and I came here.” 
Heanj Tan’s devotion is not necessarily shared by 
all the Cambodians who flock to Angkor with the 
foreign tourists. Alongside a large number of 
monks, we came across a waitress who had come 
from Phnom Penh “just to visit”, or a young lawyer 
who came because he is proud of his culture. And 
there was also the father of an affluent family, who 
was conscious that a visit to Angkor is a external 
sign of social prestige. The number of Cambodian 
visitors exceeded 120,000 in 2000 and is rising 
every year. 
Why do so many people visit Angkor? The return 
of peace in 1998 and the demining of the site, has 
allowed Cambodians to travel there in safety. But in 
a country which is struggling to cast off decades of 
nightmares and humiliation - civil war, genocide, 
Vietnamese occupation - the memory of Angkor 
soothes a shattered nation.

### 125737: Angkor's role in the search for a lost unity

“The last 25 years have been a period of 
intense philosophical reflection for the 
Cambodians,” says Azzedine Beschaouch, 
UNESCO'S Scientific Advisor for Angkor. “They 
have asked themselves whether the decline of 
the Angkor empire (9th to the 14th century) 
signalled the end of a Cambodia that was 
peaceful and highly cultured, and whether they 
themselves were part of another Cambodia, one 
which is destructive and barbaric. Angkor above

charge of the site’s development (see box). 
15,000 people visit 
the site 
“In times of despair, Angkor is the only 
reference point.” 
It is a religious symbol, the mythical base of 
the “Khmer nation” and therefore a national 
emblem. Since independence in 1953, Angkor 
Wat has featured on Cambodia’s national flag. 
Ang Chouléan recalls that in 1991, when the

Since the site was inscribed on the World Heritage List ten

made up of 35 states and international organizations, is

After helping the Cambodian authorities to define the 
layout of a site of more than 400km2, UNESCO encouraged 
the creation of APSARA in 1995. This Authority for the 
Protection of the Site and the management of the region of 
Angkor, whose acronym refers to the renowned celestial 
dancers which are engraved in stone there, has set up a 
range of projects, mainly related to tourism, town planning 
and the maintenance of the monuments.

National Council in order to reunite the country, 
“the first thing that the Council did was to 
appeal to the international community to 
safeguard Angkor.” 
In December 1992, the site was inscribed on 
UNESCO’s World Heritage List, an act Ang 
Chouléan says sealed “the start of the process 
of national reconciliation”. Since then, Angkor 
has loomed large whenever peace in the 
country needed propping up. In 1993, when 
King Norodom Sihanouk returned to the throne, 
the first decree he signed —- NS 001 - regulated 
the protection of the archaeological site. 
American anthropologist Ashley Thompson 
underlines that after the events of July 1997 as 
Cambodia once again tottered on the brink of 
chaos, it was to Angkor that the king turned to 
“pay homage to the statues” and to appeal for 
reconciliation. 
However, the control of the former capital and 
the tourist boom that it has led, have given rise 
to dissent in some quarters. 
“On one hand, Angkor has shown 
Cambodians that they can earn a lot of money 
by working together but, on the other hand, it 
has caused numerous tensions,” says Tamara 
Teneishvili from UNESCO’s Bureau in Phnom 
Penh. 
Property developers are holding up the 
introduction of town planning rules designed to 
protect the area around the site and the 
neighbouring town of Siem Reap, which has 
almost doubled in size in 10 years. And the 
residents of the 75 villages in the archeological 
park, and the long-term residents of Siem Reap 
have see more and more people moving into the 
region from other provinces to get a share of the 
profits. 
The gold mine generated by ticket sales for 
Angkor is also a source of bitter dispute. The 
number of foreign visitors has increased greatly 
since 1998 (see graph), pushing ticket receipts 
beyond US$5 million dollars in 2000, compared

with US$1.8 million in 1999. Since April 1999, a 
private company, Sokha Hotels, has held the 
concession to sell tickets. It takes a cut of 
almost 40 percent of the proceeds. The rest goes 
to the Public Treasury, which is supposed to 
pay it back to APSARA, the tourism ministry 
and the culture ministry. The agreement has 
already been revised once and a new review 
will take place this year. 
“All the donors who have contributed to the 
development and protection of the site, 
regularly denounce the situation,” says Etienne 
Clément, the director of UNESCO’s Bureau in 
Phnom Penh. He points out that elsewhere in 
the world, companies running the ticket 
operations for public monuments are rarely 
allowed to keep more than 15 percent of the 
receipts. But to place the situation in context, 
he observes that prior to April 1999, “all the 
money disappeared into a black hole”. 
“In Cambodia, the tradition of transparency in 
public finances is a very recent thing,” 
Etienne Clément, choosing his words carefully. 
“Why don’t we let APSARA collect the ticket 
receipts?” says Son Soubert, an archaeologist 
says 
and a member of the Constitutional Council. 
“Because, as everyone knows,” he alleges 
“Sokha finances the Prime Minister’s party.”

### 125739: Mostar, a bridge to peace

Restoring 
Mostar, 
part of the common 
heritage of Serbs, 
Croats and Muslims that disappeared during the 
war in Bosnia could help to start the long 
process of healing the wounds opened by the 
conflict. To this end, UNESCO is helping to 
rebuild Mostar’s Old Bridge, a jewel of Ottoman 
architecture, to make it once more a symbol of 
that heritage of peaceful coexistence. 
But reconciliation is no easy task in a city that 
lost more than 2,000 of its inhabitants in fighting 
between the three communities from 1992 to 
1995. The traces of war are still very visible. 
Near what used to be the front line, many 
bombed buildings are still derelict and bear signs 
warning of the danger of going near them. Holes 
in the roads and pavements made by shells and 
houses pock-marked with bullets are a reminder 
everywhere of the bloody conflict. 
Soldiers of the SFOR international peace force 
still patrol the town daily, along with Italian 
carabinieri, French gendarmes and Spanish civil 
guards. But those who knew the city during the 
fighting say things have much improved. 
Although the divide between the Croatian 
part of the town (along the west bank of the 
Neretva river) and the neighbourhood of the 
majority Bosnian-Muslim population (on the 
other side of the river) is still clear, three of the 
nine bridges destroyed in the area during the 
war are back in operation. But the most famous 
one, that gave the city its name (Mostar means 
“keeper of the bridge”), is still a makeshift foot 
crossing. 
The Stari Most (Old Bridge), built in 1566 by 
the Ottoman architect Mimar Hayreddin, was 
destroyed by Croatian artillery on 9 November 
1993. But the bridge lives on in the old part of 
the town, where artists paint it and craft 
workers make miniature copies of it in metal, 
ceramics and leather. Restaurants and radio 
stations are named after it and you can see it on 
postcards all over the town.

But the memory of it burns brightest in 
people’s hearts. “When I dream about the war, I 
never see my father or my brother, I always see 
the bridge,” says Selma, a 27-year-old widow. 
“When I used to go out with friends, we’d 
always arrange to meet up at the bridge. We 
just called it ‘Stari’ (the Old Man),” says 
Snjezana Hadzic, a civil engineer who is a 
consultant with the reconstruction project. 
Every August, the town’s youngsters would 
dive off the top of the bridge’s 20-metre-high 
single arch into the Neretva in a contest that 
was shown on nationwide Yugoslav television. 
“When it was destroyed, I was the mayor, and 
we all wept,” says Cisic Rusmir, head of the Old 
Bridge Project Coordination Unit, which is 
funded by the World Bank and brings together 
international, Croatian and Bosnian experts. 
“But I was also there a week later when it was

“Many people who hastened to deplore its

young Bosnian writer Nenad Velickovic, nearly 10 
years after the event. “The worst thing is that since 
then, it's become a kind of international badge of

In the 1960s, the bridge and its approaches were a place 
of leisure where the different communities mixed freely.

already been cases where the international

renovation, only to have the real or bogus former 
owners appear, waving titles to the land. Before 
doing any such work on the library, it's vital for local 
authorities to come to an agreement about the future 
use of the land.” 
Meanwhile, UNESCO is providing US $220,000 to 
renovate the temporary premises and has helped to 
restore one of the library's most famous

seeing each other as enemies. 
This is no small achievement in a town where 
SFOR soldiers say Bosnian-Muslim and Croatian 
police patrol side by side in the same uniform 
sometimes without exchanging a word for 
weeks and where the hatred simmering just 
below the surface means proceeding very 
carefully because so many families who lost 
loved ones know the names of those who 
killed them.

other foreign donors have provided the US $15 
million needed to rebuild the bridge and its two 
towers and also restore 11 buildings in the old 
part of town that were badly damaged in the 
fighting. Of the total, US $2 million is coming 
from the Mostar town council and recently the 
Croatian government said it would give 
US $660,000 for the new bridge. 
“This is a remarkable gesture from a country 
with economic problems, especially since the 
local Bosnia-Herzegovina press has kept quiet 
about it,” says Colin Kaiser, head of UNESCO’s 
office in Sarajevo. 
Ivo Andric, the only Nobel Prizewinner for 
Literature that former Yugoslavia produced, 
wrote in 1945 that “bridges are more important 
than houses and more sacred than temples, 
because everyone uses them and they belong to 
everyone.” 
It is up to the different communities in 
Mostar to make sure that when the new bridge 
opens in 2004, it fulfils Andric’s description.

### 125741: Bioethics: the ethics of genetics

IN S ( " human embryos as a source 
Aa spare body parts is an 
idea that both fascinates and terrifies. We are 
drawn by its promise. We are also frightened, 
because it has changed too quickly from 
science fiction to being real science and 
because we feel those involved in it have new 
and fearsome powers through their knowledge 
of how to alter living organisms. 
The idea of beating an illness such as 
Parkinson’s disease by replacing old or 
damaged cells with new and efficient ones 
taken from an embryo is by no means the only 
one that life sciences offer us these days. 
Other possibilities, on the contrary, are 
downright alarming. They include, for 
example, reproductive cloning of human 
beings, which some scientists and doctors say 
they are determined to press ahead with 
despite its prohibition by both UNESCO’s 1997 
Universal Declaration on the Human Genome 
and Human Rights — which calls it “contrary 
to human dignity” (article 11) - and the laws 
of many countries. 
To the already tough question posed by life 
sciences of “how far shall we go?” we must 
add another: “how far do we have the right to 
go?” This is the extremely broad domain of 
bioethics. So what are the ajor problems it 
faces today? 
Embryonic stem cell research could allow 
production of what we desperately lack - 
organs, tissue and cells for transplants - that 
give hope of spectacular progress in the battle 
against ailments that are difficult or currently 
impossible to cure, such as Parkinson’s, 
Alzheimer’s disease and Multiple Sclerosis. 
The legitimacy of such research — which 
countries either ban, permit or simply tolerate 
- depends first of all on the status given to the 
embryo. If considered to be already a human 
being, its use obviously cannot be envisaged, 
even for respectable medical treatment. But 
the debate goes further than this. Though not 
against the idea of using human embryos as a 
source of ESC, some people object to it in 
practice because of the danger of abuses and 
misuse of the embryo in the course of such 
research. Even those who consider it ethically 
acceptable are often concerned to establish 
safeguards and conditions about using them 
for medical purposes.. 
Other questions arise about the source of 
ESC. Is it right to create human embryos just 
for research purposes? And if the only 
embryos used are those no longer intended to 
grow into children (such as embryos frozen 
after in vitro fertilisation), how should the 
  
acceptability of the research be judged and 
how can the rights of the donor parents be 
respected? Ultimately, other questions must be 
asked. Do these cells, with their great 
potential for replication, risk becoming 
cancerous? If so, how can this be dealt with? 
Several countries that banned ESC research 
(Germany and France, for example) have or 
appear to be switching to a more liberal 
position. Also, while the most promising cells 
seem to be ESC (totipotent ones), cells taken 
from adults (ASC -only multipotent but raising 
fewer ethical issues) are making a come-back 
after discoveries in Canada and Sweden. 
The prospect of human cloning has also set 
off intense debate. Although the international 
community has already rejected the idea as an 
unacceptable misuse of human beings, the 
threat remains. Certain scientists and doctors 
have dismissed the widespread objections and

Genetic AAA: 
gathering, 
processing, 
storing 
and use 
The collection, treatment, storage 
and use of genetic material raise a host 
of ethical problems. They include the 
purpose of gathering it, informing 
sample donors, obtaining their free 
and informed consent, regard for the 
sensitivity of some social, religious or 
ethnic groups about genetic testing 
(for such things as parentage), 
confidentiality and what happens 
to the samples gathered. 
Courier | May 2002 
The spread of genetic 
“fingerprinting” could lead to all kinds 
of discrimination. First against people 
whose genes showed an anomaly 
indicating an existing disease or the 
predisposition for one. This could put 
them at risk of being barred from jobs, 
being refused or charged more for 
insurance, and blacklisted by credit 
organizations. There might be more 
general discrimination if a genetic 
survey of a given population led to 
stigmatisation of entire groups. 
As data banks spring up all over the 
place and genetic and medical data 
about whole populations passes into 
the hands of private firms with 
exclusive rights, the issue of genetic 
data needs to be urgently tackled. 
UNESCO's International Bioethics 
Committee is working on this and has 
  
produced a report.* An international 
instrument is being prepared and a 
first meeting about it was held at 
UNESCO headquarters in Paris on 
11-12 February this year. The IBC's 
drafting committee will work over the 
next few months on a proposal to 
present to the IBC before the end of 
the year.

say they are determined to go ahead with 
cloning. The prospect looms of “cloning 
havens,” not unlike today’s “tax havens.” If this 
situation were ever to result in the birth of a 
human clone that survived, another grave 
question would arise: what would be the legal 
position of a cloned human being “conceived” 
or “born” in a country where such a practice 
was banned? 
There are also questions about therapeutic 
cloning, which involves transferring a nucleus 
to create an embryo simply to provide stem 
cells. Is this acceptable if it can vanquish 
incurable or crippling diseases? Does accepting 
human cloning for these purposes (and 
developing the necessary techniques) leave the 
way wide open for reproductive cloning of 
human beings? Here we come up against the 
problem already mentioned: when does 
human life start? . 
Less-frequently posed questions such as 
diagnosis (the core of medical practice) are 
just as ethically important. Bioethics has 
already been confronted with the question or 
pre-natal diagnosis, and how to prevent it 
from being used to determine the sex of a 
The 'BC,

Currently headed by Ryuichi Ida, professor of law at 
Japan's Kyoto University, the International Bioethics 
Committee (IBC) was set up by UNESCO in 1993 to 
follow the progress of research in the life sciences and 
its applications by ensuring that the principles of human 
dignity and freedom are respected. The IBC is the only 
global forum which can facilitate in-depth ethical 
reflection by exposing the issues at stake. However it is 
not the IBC’s role to act as a tribunal passing judgement 
on one position or another. It is up to each country, 
particularly the legislators, to reflect societal choices 
within the framework of national legislation and to 
decide between the different positions. The Committee 
comprises 36 members, designated by UNESCO's 
Director-General, and who serve is a personal capacity. 
The IBC was the author of the Universal Declaration on 
the Human Genome and Human Rights, adopted by 
UNESCO in 1997, which is still the only international 
instrument in the field. 
foetus so as to eliminate those that are female. 
Technological advances have brought a new 
kind of diagnosis that has its own dangers: 
pre-implantation genetic diagnosis, which not 
only detects gender but countless other 
characteristics. The fear is that this technology 
- currently limited to spotting serious diseases 
— will be used for eugenic purposes, for 
“selecting” human beings. 
The status of the human genome is at the 
root of another big question: who owns 
genetic data? The person who provides parts 
of hisor her genetic material? The scientist 
who identifies its characteristics? The scientist 
who devises a use for it? The company that p=" o |

RESERVED FOR THE RICH 
In theory, only genuine inventions that have a 
purpose or might have industrial uses can be 
patented, but in fact there is an upsurge in 
patent applications for genomes and their 
uses, including gene sequences, whose future 
usefulness is unclear. According to the draft 
report on the follow-up to the international 
symposium on Ethics, Intellectual Property 
and Genomics the rocketing number of patents 
being granted means that “the costs of future 
therapies and genetic tests will become 
prohibitive for most human beings and 
nations.” 
Should these “discoveries” be protected, thus 
depriving some people of their possible 
benefits? Or should intellectual property 
protection in this area be reduced, at the risk of 
deterring corporate investment because of 
diminishing profitability? Although genetic 
discoveries compound this problem, it is not a 
new one, as shown by the debate over the cost 
of AIDS drugs, which are protected by patents 
and therefore too expensive for some countries. 
The question of equity also arises in the area 
of donating human organs and tissue. Scientific 
advances, such as xenotransplantation (trans- 
plants of genetically-altered animal organs into

a human body), and genetic engineering in 
animals as a potential source of organs 
compatible with the human body may mean 
the imbalance between supply and demand can 
be restored. But this will be at a heavy price 
mostly for poor countries. This takes us to the 
broader ethical problem of solidarity. Since the 
human genome is, according to the first article 
of the Universal Declaration on the Human 
Genome and Human Rights, part of the 
“heritage of humanity,” should not the benefits 
of this research - mainly done in rich countries 
often using material from elsewhere - be better 
shared? 
Finally, there is the problem of what to do 
with all the genetic data gathered in the 
UNESCO | the new Courier | May 2002 
course of all the discoveries that promise both 
remedies and future dangers. Such material 
ranges from initial biological samples, the 
isolated DNA, records of DNA sequences, 
genetic profiles and information about the 
state of the chromosomes. It can also include 
written family medical records. The collection, 
treatment, storage and use of this genetic 
material - which determines a person’s 
genetic identity and is passed down through 
generations — also raises very many ethical 
problems (see box p.21). The International 
Bioethics Committee (IBC) has published 
several reports on this and UNESCO has begun 
work this year on drawing up international 
guidelines in the field.

t centuries after it disappeared, the 
Ji Xt CON biggest library of ancient times is 
coming back to life in the Egyptian city of Alexandria. The 
library where the Bible’s Old Testament was first translated 
from Hebrew into Greek and where Euclid invented 
geometry. 
“It’s wonderful that amid so many wars around the 
world, and when people are talking about the clash of 
civilisations, that a few metres from where the old library 
was, a new and wonderful institution is rising that’s also 
dedicated to universal knowledge, understanding and 
tolerance,” says its director, Ismail Serageldin. 
The official opening of the new library had been 
scheduled for April 23, World Book and Copyright Day. 
However, events in the Middle East forced a postponement. 
The library is noetheless ready to go. It is the biggest such 
institution in the Middle East and Africa, with room for 
eight million books and equipped with state-of-the-art 
information technology, including a section for digitally 
scanning manuscripts. Its physical design is also unique. 
“The building is conceived as a solar disc rising out of the 
ground and looking towards the sea, symbolising the 
openness and vastness of knowledge,” says Serageldin. 
“Like the Sydney Opera House or the Guggenheim 
Museum, it has its own very distinct character.”

TERT RI CRU ELE RIDE 
As well as the library itself and a spectacular reading hall 
for 1,700 people, there is a conference centre that can hold 
3,500 people, a planetarium, five research institutions, an 
Internet centre, three museums and four art galleries. For 
Serageldin, it’s much more than a library, rather “a vast 
international cultural centre,” comparable to the Museion - 
part of the ancient library and the University of Alexandria 
and the gathering place for poets, scientists and artists. 
Founded by Ptolemy I Soter in 288 BC, the ancient library 
contained nearly 700,000 manuscripts. It was there that 
Aristarchus suggested for the first time that the Earth 
revolved round the Sun, where Eratosthenes calculated the 
circumference of the Earth and Herophilus discovered that 
the brain controlled the body. After 450 years, the library 
disappeare, the victim of attacks and fires - the first of them 
in 48 BC, when Caesar backed Cleopatra against her 
brother Ptolemy XIII. 
But this glorious past doesn’t intimidate Serageldin. “I 
want to make the new library into a meeting-place where 
thinkers, artists and scientists from all over the world can 
lay the foundation of mutual understanding through 
dialogue,” he says. 
UNESCO | the new Courier | May 2002 
“Our primary vocation is the Mediterranean and then 
the Arab World and Africa,” he says. “We’re going to 
develop close ties with institutions such as the University 
of Alexandria, Senghor University, the Arab Academy 
of Science and Technology and the Egyptian Centre 
for Creativity. We will focus on researching the history 
of the old library, the ethics of science and technology 
and studying water as a development issue.” 
As a trained architect, Serageldin is keen to talk about 
the building itself: “It was designed by a group of very 
talented young Norwegian architects (from the firm 
Snohetta) and construction was supervised by an 
outstanding Egyptian engineer, Mamdouh Hamza, who 
faced the challenge of building part of it 18 metres below 
sea-level. You can approach the building without feeling 
crushed and you don’t realise it’s 160 metres across and 
11 storeys high. It’s surrounded by a wall in the shape of a 
half-moon, on which are carved letters from the alphabets 
of 120 languages. The overall effect is sedate, human, 
open and elegant.” 
Serageldin, a Moroccan academic, is most proud of the 
great reading hall, “one of the most beautiful in the world,” 
he says. “The soft mellow daylight reaches everywhere and 
the ceiling elevated on very elegant columns creates an 
atmosphere of a "cathedral of learning, as someone put it.” 
Looking down on the reading hall from the Callimachus 
Triangle, a vantage point from where you can see the 
building’s seven levels, he adds confidently that “in future, 
people won’t come to Egypt to see the Pyramids. They’ll 
come to see this library.” 
He firmly rejects criticism of the project’s cost: “The final 
cost was US$220 million, US$97.6 million of which was 
provided by the outside world and the remainder by the 
Egyptian government. For a country of 67 million people, 
US$120 million over a 10 years isn’t an unreasonable 
investment for a centre of excellence.” 
The Ptolemies were also criticised in their time, says 
Serageldin, but history proved them right. “The 
contribution of the Ancient Library of Alexandria to the 
knowledge of the world, to the patrimony of the whole 
human race, continues to this day to inspire us as one the 
greatest adventures of the human mind.” 
Restoring a link with that noble tradition is what gives 
the project its universal character. “It’s wonderful to see 
the excitement of thousands of people all over the world 
at the inauguration of the library, which they feel belongs 
to them as much as to Egypt,” says Serageldin.

At the Egyptian government's request in 1986, 
UNESCO helped give an international dimension to 
the scheme to build the Alexandria Library. 
“UNESCO's international backing was crucial to this 
project going forward,” says, Ismail Serageldin, the 
library's director. 
In 1987, UNESCO launched an international appeal 
to support “the revival of the Ancient Library of 
Alexandria” and paid for a feasibility study that said 
a big library should supply the needs of the 
Mediterranean region. A year later, together with the 
International Union of Architects (IUA) and the UN 
Development Programme (UNDP), UNESCO 
announced an international competition to design the 
library. It also organised the Aswan Meeting in 1990, 
where it got the first international funding for the 
project — US$65 million, mainly from Arab countries. 
UNESCO has provided an Internet server and money 
to set up the library's website. It has also funded an 
electronic library for blind people and the training of 
librarians, as well as providing technical documents [t

Commissioned by Congress to study 
the effects of climate change on Metropolitan 
New York, William Solecki of Montclair 
State University and Cynthia Rosenzweig, 
of Columbia University’s Earth Institute, have 
been taking a look “under the hood” 
of New York City, from an ecological point 
of view. In their Metro East Coast Assessment 
report, which has just been published 
(http://metroeast_climate.ciesin.columbia.edu/) 
they emphasise the role of the City’s biological 
diversity in reducing negative impacts of global 
warming. And over the past two years, these 
scientists have also teamed up with UNESCO’s 
Man and Biosphere programme, to see if it can 
provide useful research and planning tools.

“The biosphere reserve concept (see box) 
and the world network of biosphere reserves 
have usually been associated with more 
pristine, scarcely populated environments,” 
says Christine Alfsen-Norodom, of UNESCO’s 
Man and Biosphere Programme, who is 
coordinating the project in New York. 
“Never before has the biosphere reserve 
concept been examined in terms of its direct 
relevance or usefulness to a mega-city, 
like New York.” 
But for Pietro Garau, Director of the UN 
Center for Human Settlements (Habitat) 
European Office, it’s not necessarily a city’s 
green spaces that make it ecologically 
interesting. Speaking at a conference last year 
in New York on “Biodiversity and Society”, 
Garau pointed out that “a ‘passenger’ in the city 
uses less land and energy than a rural 
‘passenger’. In a 'no-city’ planet, if we divided 
all available land by the number of inhabitants, 
each ‘passenger’ would be using 2.16 hectares 
in 2001. But with population growth, this would 
become 1.4 hectares by 2050. So the ‘no-city’ 
model is not sustainable.” And, he added, 
provocatively, “cities may be the best we have 
for saving the planet’s environment.” 
In fact, urban environments can provide a 
variety of habitats for plants and animals, 
sometimes mimicking natural conditions. Tall 
stone buildings can resemble cliffs, while lawns 
are like savanna. And there are some unique 
inner-city places, not often frequented by 
people, where even rare animals and plants can 
thrive, such as ancient churchyards, or disused 
railway lines, as well as abandoned factories 
and other brownfield sites. 
ON THE WATERFRONT 
New York City’s waterfront geography also gives 
it some unique natural features. Much of the 
city, for example, is built on prehistoric swamp 
and salt marsh, similar to that still found in 
Jamaica Bay, within sight of Wall Street (see 
map). “Traditionally,” says Bill Solecki, 
“wetlands have been used as sacrifice areas to 
build airports, waste dumps, or whatever.” But, 
he warns, “the greatest biodiversity in the city 
is found at the water’s edge. And it is also the 
area most vulnerable to climate change.”

 Shortly after UNESCO set up the Man and Biosphere 
Programme in 1968 it invited member states to submit 
proposals for the first biosphere reserves. These were to be 
experimental sites, attempting to strike a balance between 
the apparently conflicting goals of conserving biological 
diversity, promoting sustainable economic and social 
development and maintaining associated cultural values. 
Since then, a network of some 409 reserves has grown up 
in 94 countries. 
Traditionally, biosphere reserves are organised 
geographically into three separate zones - core, buffer and 
transition. In the core area, critical habitats and biodiversity 
are protected. The buffer zone is there to protect the core, 
while the transition area serves as an intermediate zone 
between the buffer and the surrounding region. 
In the past, nearly all biosphere reserves have been in 
  
relatively remote, natural areas. But since the late 1990's 
MAB has been looking at ways to extend the biosphere 
reserve concept to urban areas. One of the difficulties is to 
know where to locate the “core” area in a city reserve. 
Some argue it could even lie outside the city, in the more 
pristine hinterland. But researchers running a case study in 
New York (see main article) have suggested the waterfront 
area; it is the most fragile and active in terms of biodiversity, 
but, historically, also the most important economically. 
Member states themselves have to nominate areas as 
biosphere reserves and there are no official plans for New 
York at present. The concept could be a useful toolkit for 
discussion and research, though.

Salt marshes naturally act as a buffer against 
sea level rise, one of the most immediate threats 
to New York City with global warming. But when 
Ellen Hartig, a wetlands consultant, compared 
archive and recent photos of Jamaica Bay, she 
found the marshes had shrunk by 12 percent 
since 1959 - and up to 60 percent in some small 
island areas. “In one Long Island bay, there were 
13 islands at one point,” she says. “Now there 
are only seven. Six are submerged.” The marshes, 
she explains, would usually compensate for sea 
level rise by “retreating” inland. But since the 
waterfront has been built upon, the marshes can 
no longer adapt, making the developed areas 
prone to flooding, while killing species of salt- 
marsh grasses that cannot survive in deep water. 
AS THE CITY SPRAWLS 
ITS CENTRE GETS GREENER 
The complex interactions between man and 
environment in an urban setting like New York, 
argues Solecki, can only be understood - and 
therefore mastered - if the city is viewed as 
a complete ecological system. From this 
perspective, then, the flood protection offered by 
salt marshes is one of the natural “goods and 
services” for which New Yorkers will have to pay 
if the marshes disappear. To compensate for the 
loss of this protection, city planners are already 
having to think about artificial flood barriers, 
while the Port Authority of New York and 
New Jersey has elevated JFK’s main runway 
once and may have to do so again. Similarly, 
the trees and green spaces of Central Park reduce 
air pollution levels, as well as the “heat island 
effect”, where the combination of heat-absorbing 
concrete and human activity causes temperatures 
in the city to rise. 
And as the city sprawls, the natural goods and 
services upon which residents depend are coming 
from increasingly far away. In 1992 the Canadian 
economist, William Rees coined the term 
“ecological footprint”, to refer to the amount of 
productive land needed to sustain a city’s 
population and its levels of consumption. This is 
usually found in the local hinterland. But in a city 
like New York, the “footprint” might include parts 
of Nebraska, where acres of prairie are turned into 
wheat and potato fields, or even South American 
coffee plantations. Ironically, as the city chomps

into the hinterland, there is a move to “green” 
downtown areas. Since 1978 community 
gardening associations, like Green Thumb, have 
planted some 700 productive vegetable and flower 
gardens on over 60 hectares of vacant lots, 
according to its founder, Jane Weissman. And 
heated discussions are going on about what to do 
with the “Ground Zero” site left by the World 
Trade Center disaster last September. “Developers 
in NYC are stating that rebuilding commercial 
developments at Ground Zero is a national duty,” 
says Alfsen-Norodom. “But their haste shows their 
fear that, in a wounded city, people may aspire 
to alternative uses of a space made highly 
symbolic by its very destruction.” 
Popular support seems to be moving towards a 
cultural use of the space, which cuts across the 
“nature” versus “concrete” divide. And the 
cultural diversity of New York is going to need to 
find its place in any biosphere model of the city 
alongside biological diversity. This could be what 
will set the New York case study apart from other 
studies of urban ecology going on in the USA at 
the moment, such as those in Baltimore and 
Phoenix, Arizona funded by the US National 
Science Foundation (see: www.lternet.edu/sites/). 
Meanwhile, armed with the Metro East Coast 
Report, city planners have realised that what is left 
of the City’s nature is not just pretty. It could help 
save New Yorkers from going to work in a rowing 
boat, if, as predicted, the threat of floods will 
increase with global warming. Christopher Zeppie, 
of the Port Authority, at a launch for the report, 
called for planners to be more proactive: “The 
stone age did not end because the human race ran 
out of stone.”

On a bright May morning in the 
Ramble, a wooded area of New 
York's Central Park, birdwatchers can 
almost outnumber the birds. This is 
the time of year that hundreds of 
tiny, colourful warblers from as far 
away as Mexico and Bolivia, stop off 
in Manhattan to feed, on their long 
migration to the forests of Canada. 
And if the whole park suddenly 
comes alive with the din of birds’ 
alarm calls, one of the city’s resident 
Peregrine falcons is probably 
overhead. 
By the 1960’s peregrine falcons had 
disappeared from the state of New 
York — victims of the pesticide, DDT — 
until a project to reintroduce them in 
the 1980's. But no-one expected 
these mountain birds to move into 
the city, building their nests on 
Brooklyn Bridge. Now as many as 
14 pairs nest in other unlikely spots, 
like Riverside Church on the sedate 
John F. Kennedy airport's 
main runway is built on salt 
marsh. One of the richest 
ecosystems in the area, 
it is home to the Fiddler 
crab that emerges from 
its burrow at low tide, 
giant egrets (inset) 
and hundreds of other 
species

In Africa, the 
question of quality is 
still intrinsically 
linked to access 
1. Education 
Statistics 2001, 
Regional Report 
on Latin 
America and 
the Caribbean 
UNESCO | the new Courier | May 2002   
A estimated two million primary-age 
Nn children and 20 million secondary- 
age children in Latin America don’t attend 
primary or secondary school according to 
UNESCO’s Institute for Statistics (UIS). In the 
region’s rural areas, two out of every five 
children fail to finish primary school or are at 
least two years behind when they finally do so. 
This compares to one urban child in six. 
The Institute’s report on Latin America and 
the Caribbean! examines the state of education 
around the world. It presents figures for 19 
countries gathered over the 1998 - 1999 school 
year from national and other sources including 
the Economic Commission for Latin America 
and the Caribbean (ECLAC), and covers access 
and participation of pupils and students from 
early childhood to tertiary level in both public 
and private education, teaching staff and 
education expenditure. 
The report shows that although overall school 
enrolment is improving in the region, countries 
there are still a long way from ensuring that 
their children succeed at school. 
“Getting kids into school is one thing. 
Keeping them there, and ensuring that they 
learn something is another,” says Ken Ross, a 
senior researcher at UNESCO’s International 
Institute for Educational Planning (IIEP). 
In all of the countries surveyed at least 80 
percent of primary school-age children are 
enrolled in primary education. However, the 
report finds that only 54 percent of secondary 
school-age youth are enrolled, leaving an 
estimated 20 million “out-of-school” or still in 
primary classes. 
High drop out and repetition rates are the 
norm in several countries. In Brazil, for 
example, 24 percent of primary-school pupils 
and 18 percent of secondary students are 
repeaters. For every 100 children who enter 
primary school in Nicaragua, only 55 reach 
grade 5. Argentina has the highest “survival 
rate”, with 94 percent of pupils reaching 
grades. 
Tertiary education is one of the region’s 
“greatest educational challenges”, according 
to the report. Despite increased enrolment 
throughout the 90s, only 9.5 million people were 
enrolled in tertiary education in Latin America 
in 1998, with Brazil, Mexico and Argentina 
alone accounting for almost 60 percent 
of the total. 
Overall, the report states, Latin American 
children spend less than nine years at school, 
which is only one a half years more than 
20 years ago. It is also well below the 12 years 
judged by the Economic Commission for Latin 
America and the Caribbean as being “the 
minimum amount of education necessary to earn 
a wage that will make it possible to rise above 
poverty in the course of a person’s active life.” 
The report doesn’t give any detailed 
explanation of why kids are not making through 
primary and secondary school in the region, but 
highlights difficulties in implementing 
institutional reforms and a continued 
vulnerability to external events which has left

School hours rarely take into 
account the need for extra hands 
at harvest time 
The UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) 
was established in 1999 to improve UNESCO's 
statistical programme and to develop and deliver the 
timely, accurate and policy-relevant statistics 
needed in today’s increasingly complex and rapidly 
changing environment. 
The statistical information gathered by the UIS 
not only helps interpret and report on global 
developments in education, science, culture and 
communication, it also helps countries to formulate, 
implement and monitor policies and programmes 
in areas such as education and poverty reduction. 
UIS is located on the campus of the University 
of Montreal in Montreal, Canada. 
The two reports mentioned in the main article are 
available in PDF format on the UIS website: 
http://www.uis.unesco.org  
Latin America’s economic performance fairly 
weak. 
The good news is that that despite the 
varying levels of development across the region, 
countries are committed to the modernization 
and reform of their education systems. It also 
notes that a real opportunity to improve is 
emerging as population growth slows. Across 
the region the population is increasing by 
approximately 1.5 percent annually. This 
means, says the report, that there will be a 
smaller number of children to educate without 
necessarily increasing education budgets. 
AFRICA: AN UPHILL BATTLE 
In Africa , the question of quality is still Esco 
intrinsically linked to access. According to the HA 
UIS, four out of every ten primary-age children 
in sub-Saharan Africa do not go to school, and 3 1 
of those who do, only a small proportion reach 
  
a basic level of skills. 
The Institute’s recent report, Education 
Statistics 2001 - Regional Report on sub-Saharan 
Africa, examines education in 49 countries and, 
as with the Latin American report, covers the 
1998 and 1999 school years. 
Data were provided by national authorities 
responding to the annual education 
questionnaire from the Institute, and 
supplemented by figures from other 
international bodies including the United 
Nations Statistics and Population Divisions, and 
the World Bank. 
It finds that pre-primary education is 
extremely limited in the region, involving only 
one child in ten, or some four million children. 
The situation varies greatly from one country to 
another, with Eastern and Southern Africa 
accounting for 62 percent of these children. The 
pre-primary institutions are largely private, 
catering for more than eight children out of 
every ten enrolled. 
Primary education is clearly the priority for 
most of the countries of sub-Saharan Africa. 
Yet, according to the report, only 60 percent of 
primary-age children were actually enrolled 
throughout the region in the survey years, but 
that average hides big differences between 
countries. In Niger, for example, only 26 percent 
of primary-age children were in school, 
UNESCO | the new Courier | May 2002

### 125744: Quality and quantity

  
compared to 93 percent in Mauritius. 
Based on these figures, the report estimates 
that some 38-million primary-age children were 
out-of-school in sub-Saharan Africa in 1998, 
about 60 percent of them in the countries of 
Central and Western Africa. 
The data also indicates a “relatively high” 
level of repetition in the region, with an average 
of 17 percent of pupils repeating a year. 
Secondary education, says the report, “is still 
not widespread in sub-Saharan Africa,” and 
complete data are not available for all countries 
in the region. Late entry and high repetition 
rates also mean that, in many countries, the 
majority of secondary-age children are still 
attending primary classes. In the 21 countries for 
which data were available, an average of only 19 
percent of young people of secondary-school-age 
were enrolled at that level. In five countries 
(Burkina Faso, Chad, Guinea, Mozambique and 
Niger) it was less than ten percent. 
Many more boys than girls are enrolled in 
secondary schools across the region. In 
countries such as Benin, Chad, Guinea-Bissau 
and Togo, more than twice as many boys as 
girls attend secondary classes. There are 
however exceptions to this pattern with girls

However, tertiary education remains “marginal” school... 
with only about one and a half million students 
enrolled in these institutions (these figures 
exclude Nigeria). The report signals that many 
students - particularly those in advanced 
research — have to study abroad because 
programmes are not available in their home 
countries. Within the region, a majority of 
tertiary students choose to study education and 
social sciences (including humanities). 
“MARGINAL” 
Overall, there is an average of 40 pupils per 
teacher across the region, but again the 
situation varies considerably from country to 
country. In St Helena, the ratio is nine pupils 
for every teacher, but in Mozambique, Uganda, 
Chad, Mali and Congo it is more than 60 to one. 
“It should be stressed,” says the report, “that 
national mean figures of 60 pupils or more per 
teacher in fact mean these countries may have 
some teachers in charge of 100 pupils of more.”

o Getting A clear pictuve 
In 1995, UNESCO's International Institute for Educational 
Planning (IEP) and the education ministries of southern 
African countries launched a major project to monitor 
education quality in the region with a view to improving it. 
The first phase of the Southern Africa Consortium for 
Monitoring Educational Quality (SACMEQ) project focused on 
assessing the conditions of schooling - looking at the 
infrastructure, numbers of teachers and availability of 
teaching materials for example. SACMAQ Il includes an 
assessment of the performance levels of students and their 
teachers in literacy and mathematics. Some 50,000 students, 
5,000 teachers and 2,500 school principals from primary 
schools across 15 southern African countries were involved in 
data collection for the project. Results are expected out late 
this year or early in 2003. 
Teachers throughout the region are generally 
poorly trained with considerable variation 
between countries. For the 16 countries, which 
provided figures on pre-primary education, an 
average of only 30 percent of teachers received 
any training. The situation is somewhat better 
in primary education, but again extremely 
variable. Equatorial Guinea claims that 100 
percent of primary teachers there have received 
some training. In Guinea Bissau only 28 percent 
have. In half of the 26 countries for which data 
were available, 20 percent of primary teachers 
had not received any training at all. 
Total spending on education ranges from one 
percent of GDP in Sierra Leone to over ten 
percent in Zimbabwe (10.1) and Lesotho (13.2). 
Most of the money goes towards current 
expenditure, including teachers’ salaries and the 
purchase of materials, and the lion’s share is 
devoted to primary education. 
The educational challenges facing the 
countries of sub-Saharan Africa are 
considerable. Poverty, HIV-AIDS (see box), war 
and civil conflicts and high population growth 
are major hurdles for all governments and 
populations throughout the region. One person 
in three is of primary or secondary school age 
compared to only one in five in Latin America 
and Asia and one in six in OECD countries. “A 
sustained and substantial increase in GDP 
growth rates would seem to be an important 
precondition for improving access to 
education,” concludes the report. 
To make a difference, the report suggests that 
governments need to recognize the crucial role 
of education in development; enhance the 
capacities of institutions and education 
personnel; and extend access and increase 
equity while improving the quality and 
relevance of education. 
COMMITMENTS 
Most of the world’s governments, development 
agencies and donor organizations now accept 
that education is a key factor in determining a 
person’s quality of life, as well as productivity, 
employability and national development . At the 
World Education Forum held in Dakar, Senegal, 
two years ago, 164 countries committed 
themselves to achieving quality basic education 
for all by 2015 or earlier. For their part, donor 
countries pledged “no country seriously 
committed to basic education will be thwarted 
in the achievement of this goal by lack of 
resources”. 
Two years down the track, many countries are 
obviously struggling. According to a monitoring 
report released late last year on Education For 
All, at least 32 nations may not even be able to 
meet the basic goal of enrolling all children in 
primary schools by 2015, let alone make sure 
that they at least get a minimum and 
meaningful education.

More than half of those 
students who know where 
- and from whom - arms 
can be bought (55 percent) 
say that getting hold of a 
weapon is easy. Seventy 
percent of those students 
who have, or have had a 
firearm, say that they are 
used in schools, and more 
than half of these young 
people say that their 
parents and those close 
to them also own weapons. 
These figures, and others 
on gangs and drug 
trafficking in or near 
schools, come from a new 
book, “Violencias nas 
Escolas” (Violence in

school violence in 14 major 
Brazilian cities. 
Launched in March 
by UNESCO’s regional 
office in Brazil 
(uhbrz@unesco.org.br) 
the book presents the 
 
results of the biggest study 
of its kind ever carried out 
in Latin America. More 
than 50,000 questionnaires 
were distributed 
to students, parents 
and teachers and more 
than 2,000 people were 
interviewed. 
The study found that 
school violence badly 
affects the school 
environment, leads to an 
increase in absenteeism 
and a drop in the quality 
of education.

competition. It’s open to 
classes of children from four 
to seven years old, who're 
invited to invent - with their 
teacher’s help - a story in 
pictures, illustrating one or 
several of six themes: 
respect for all life, non- 
violence, sharing, listening 
to understand, preserving 
the planet, tolerance and 
solidarity. 
Two winners per age 
group (4-5 and 6-7 year 
olds) will be chosen in 
September. 
The competition is 
organized in the framework

freedom 
in the 
Palestinian 
Territories 
As escalating violence in the 
Middle East took its toll on 
journalists covering 
Palestinian territories under 
Israeli military attack, 
UNESCO’s Director-General, 
Koichiro Matsuura, 
condemned increasing 
restrictions on press freedom. 
He urged “Israel, as a 
signatory of the International 
Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights,” to respect its 
Article 19 which enshrines 
the “right to freedom of 
expression” and states that 
“this right shall include 
freedom to seek, receive and 
impart information and ideas 
of all kinds.” Mr Matsuura 
deplored the constraints on 
journalists covering events in 
the region and condemned 
Israeli measures against the 
Voice of Palestine, the radio 
station of the Palestinian 
National Authority, and the 
Authority’s television 
broadcaster.

UNESCO backs 
Afghanistan's independent media 
Music, films, kite-flying and football have 
returned to Kabul. The independent media is 
back too. Kabul Weekly reappeared on January 
24 (five years after it had closed), the women’s 
magazine Malalai was launched on February 
21 and the satirical monthly Zambel e Gham in 
mid-January. 
The help of UNESCO and the French

This “project nursery,” whose buildings

Geoffrey Nyarsta of Zimbabwe awarded 
Werle Press Freetlom Prize 2662 
Zimbabwean journalist 
Geoffrey Nyarota, founder 
and editor-in-chief of 
Zimbabwe’s only independent 
daily newspaper, the Daily 
News, was awarded the 
UNESCO/Guillermo Cano 
World Press Freedom Prize 
for 2002 on World Press 
Freedom Day, May 3, in 
Manila (Philippines). 
Mr Nyarota, 50, has been 
tireless in denouncing 
corruption and criminal 
activities among top 
government officials in his 
country despite intense 
harassment by the 
authorities. 
The US $25,000 prize was 
awarded by UNESCO 
Director-General 
Koichiro Matsuura on the 
recommendation of an 
international, independent 
jury of journalists. 
Mr Matsuura praised 
Mr Nyarota’s “courage and 
persistence” as “an example 
to all the world’s journalists.” 
Mr Nyarota has paid 
heavily for his professional 
commitment. Already in 
1983, he lost his job at the 
The Chronicle in Bulawayo 
because he broke the story on 
the “Willowgate” scandal that 
forced the resignation of five 
cabinet ministers. In 1991, he 
was dismissed from his post 
as editor of the weekly 
Financial Gazette in a dispute 
over editorial control. The 
biggest battle waged by Mr 
Nyarota’s own Daily News 
has been over its coverage of 
the invasion of white-owned 
farms by war veterans 
encouraged by Zimbabwe's 
ruling ZANU-PF party. The 
paper’s reports, including 
stories about the use of police 
vehicles in the pillages, has 
led to death threats against 
Mr Nyarota, to his arrest and 
to the bombing of the Daily 
News offices.

Counting the grains of 
santl in the Caribbean 
In Caribbean islands, 
the coastline plays 
an important role in 
the economy, from 
tourism to fishing. 
But poorly-planned 
construction, sand 
mining and even sea 
defences, can disturb 
fragile beach 
ecosystems, accelerating 
erosion and worsening 
the impact of natural 
disasters. When 
Hurricane Luis struck 
Anguilla in 1995, much 
of the beach was lost 
at Mead’s Bay on 
the island’s north coast. 
But local people can 
help to slow down 
the rate of erosion 
and offset some of 
the damage done 
to property. In some 
cases, it is simply 
a matter of building 
a house, hotel or 
business a certain 
minimum distance from 
the beach. 
For the past year 
UNESCO has been 
teaming up with local 
planning experts in nine 
Caribbean Islands 
to publish a series of 
short, but highly 
informative booklets 
on “Wise practices 
for coping with beach 
erosion”. The first 
of these, published with 
Anguilla’s Department 
of Physical Planning, 
is filled with practical 
information. Other 
booklets are being 
published this year for 
Grenada, St Kitts, Nevis, 
Antigua Barbuda, 
Dominica, Monserrat, 
St Vincent (Bequia), and 
Turks & Caicos Islands. 
Clean water for the Afghans 
Cities across Central 
Asia are threatened by a 
battery of water-related 
problems—from violent 
flooding to severe 
drought and disease 
resulting from 
insufficient treatment 
facilities. To improve the 
situation, UNESCO and 
the Islamic Republic of 
Iran will set up the first 
Regional Centre on 
Urban Water 
Management, to be 
based in Tehran. 
The centre should be 
operational by mid-year, 
with a key priority to 
train technicians from 
Afghanistan to 
rehabilitate what 
remains of Kabul’s 
UNESCO | the new Courier | May 2002 
water infrastructure and 
that of other major 
cities. In addition to 
training professionals, 
the centre will also 
serve as a clearinghouse 
for scientific data, 
international assistance 
activities and other 
resources required to 
better manage urban 
water problems. 
Regional water 
managers are 
particularly interested in 
developing “ecological 
sanitation,” in which 
traditional technologies 
are updated and 
adapted to reduce the 
amount of treated water 
used to wash away 
sewage, which has been 
the standard yet 
expensive approach 
taken in most Western 
cities.

An AIDS prevention 
centre for Cameroon 
Dr. Luc Montagnier, one 
of the French biologists 
who discovered HIV, is 
working with UNESCO 
to create and oversee 
an AIDS research and 
prevention centre 
in Cameroon, where 
the infection rate has 
reached 12 percent of 
the national population. 
The centre will have 
branches in two hospitals, 
in the capital, Yaoundé, 
and Douala. Staff will 
focus on bioclinical 
research, teacher training 
activities for AIDS 
prevention as well 
as counselling and 
treatment on an out- 
patient basis for people 
with HIV. 
The centre is part of 
the World Foundation 
for Aids Research 
and Prevention, created 
in 1993, by UNESCO 
and Dr. Montagnier. A key 
aim is to bridge the gap 
in terms of research and 
treatment options between 
rich and poor nations. 
Various UN agencies are 
involved in the foundation, 
which operates a similar 
research centre 
in Cote-d’Ivoire.

Kabul gets

The rehabilitation of 
Afghanistan’s 
national museum in 
Kabul got under 
way on March 1 
with the signing of 
a memorandum of 
understanding 
between UNESCO 
and the Afghan 
government. 
The museum has 
no roof or windows 
at the moment, says 
Jim Williams of 
UNESCO in Kabul. 
Most of the exhibits 
are in storage 
on the ground floor

and its curator, 
Omar Khan Masudi, 
says a third of 
them have survived.

languages - half of 
the world’s total - 
are in danger. 
UNESCO stirred

with the launch of 
the second edition 
of its Atlas of the 
World’s Languages 
in Danger of 
Disappearing, on 
International 
Mother Language 
Day on February 21.

them from the

depiction of living

hammers and axes. 
Until then, the

Russian. But 
experience shows 
that all is not lost.

Ten long-term trends shaping 
humanity in the 21st century 
At a time of globalization and the 
acceleration and multiplication of exchanges, 
the future appears, if not obscure, at least 
opaque. Complexity and uncertainty are the 
defining words of our era. Caught up in 
the frenzy of the immediate, victims of the 
tyranny of urgent tasks, we do not take the 
time to develop well-constructed actions 
or to reflect on their consequences. We have 
embarked, without brakes and without 
visibility, on the adventure of the future. 
But the fastest automobiles need the most 
powerful headlights. It is therefore no longer 
a matter of adjusting and adapting since 
adjustment and adaptation are always 
trailing the times. We must take the initiative. 
We must look into the future, adopt 
a forward-looking vision of the world: 
tomorrow our children will harvest the fruits 
of our foresight, or of our blindness.

investment in education? How can we 
ensure that globalization becomes a 
powerful force for emancipation and 
international solidarity, instead of one 
that generates exclusion and inward- 
looking attitudes? 
It is true that globalization offers 
the potential benefit of improved 
means of information and 
communication, as well as the 
transport of this information. The 
new information and communication 
technologies provide fresh 
opportunities in the area of distance 
learning; they hint at the promise of a 
society of networks — one which is 
decentralized, more democratic and 
less hierarchical. Globalization could 
contribute not just to the 
fragmentation of societies but also to 
the spread of an international 
consciousness. This is perhaps how 
we should see the ill-named anti- 
globalisation protest movement that 
sociologist Edgar Morin calls a 
second globalisation: one of 
awareness, alongside economic and 
technical globalisation.

Are poverty

could be living below the absolute 
poverty threshold, compared to 1.5 
billion people at the dawn of the new 
millennium and 1.2 billion in 1987. 
In 25 years time, at least 85 percent 
of the total world population will 
probably live in developing or

Refugees returning 
to Kosovo in 1999 
Tl events of September 11 
he and their consequences 
seem to have created a new pattern 
of international security, of war and 
peace, in which an alliance of 
“civilised” states faces countries 
supporting international terrorism. Of 
course this picture should be 
qualified, if only to avoid spreading 
the dangerous (and largely refuted) 
myth of “a clash of civilisations.” 
Despite the genuine risks of 
international terrorism and the 
tensions and imbalances it creates, 
we must remember that this new 
situation has not abolished the risks 
there were before: it has simply 
superimposed itself on them. 
Since the end of the Cold War, 
peace appears to be less impossible, 
 
while war often seems to be that 
much less improbable. A number of 
states continue to devote considerable 
sums to defence, which are then not 
available when it comes to dealing 
with the non-military threats to their 
future. In addition, we have seen a 
rise in the number of intra-State 
confrontations and inter-ethnic or 
inter-communal conflicts, which now 
represent the type of conflict par 
excellence at the dawn of the 21st 
century. Such conflicts often take 
place against a background of the 
breakdown of the rule of law and of 
the powerlessness of national 
institutions. In such circumstances, 
are we to fear the growth, in the 
coming decades, of the phenomenon 
of “failed states” and an increasing 
number of conflicts that take place 
without any respect whatsoever for 
international legal norms, making any 
attempt at mediation on the part of 
international institutions extremely 
difficult? 
Intolerance, xenophobia, racism 
and discrimination are resurfacing, 
sometimes in violent and even 
genocidal fashion; their practitioners 
justify them on the grounds of 
religious, national, cultural and 
linguistic affiliation. Are we going to 
see further globalization of terrorism 
and organized crime, repeated

great hopes: at long last, it would be

defence budgets and invest more in

a “disarmament race” which began in 
1989 after the fall of the Berlin Wall, 
we are now seeing new increases in 
military spending and new growth in 
the arms trade. 
The threats to peace and security 
are no longer solely of a military 
nature. In recent decades there has 
been an increase in awareness, at 
both the national and international 
level, of the many different 
dimensions of peace and security. In 
view of the increasing 
interdependence of political, 
economic, financial, social and 
environmental phenomena, will the 
United Nations Security Council not 
feel impelled to include on a more 
systematic basis, among its fields of 
competence, other threats which 
endanger human security: the 
degradation of the environment and 
living conditions; population 
problems; cultural and ethnic 
rivalries; and all forms of violations 
of human rights?

loneliness of the

Demographic 
changes 
Tl United Nations projects 
he that the world’s 
population could reach eight billion 
in 2028 and nine billion in 2054, 
when it will then stabilize at about 
that figure. Thus, there would not be 
any demographic bomb, but a strong 
increase followed by a levelling off; 
according to some demographers 
there could even be, in a few 
decades’ time, an implosion: the low 
projections by the United Nations 
predict that world population will 
reach a ceiling around 2050 of about 
7.3 billion, and then begin to fall. 
Since the demographic transition has 
accelerated, it can therefore no longer 
be excluded that the world’s 
population will scarcely exceed 
8 billion people by about 2050. 
Moreover, the world’s population 
is ageing: the under 15s would go 
from 31 percent to 19 percent of the 
world’s population from 1995 to 
2050, according to the United 
Nations’ intermediate scenario, and 
the over 60s would increase 
proportionately during the same 
period from 10 percent 
to 22 percent. 
The geographical distribution of the 
world’s population is also changing. 
In the absence of strong migratory 
flows that cannot be ruled out, the 
populations of Europe and Japan 
should decline over the next 50 years. 
According to some analyses, there 
would be no other solution than 
immigration to offset the drastic 
decrease in the balance between the 
working and non-working 
populations. 
The causes of mortality are also 
changing. The World Health 
Organization (WHO) has warned of 
an impending global crisis concerning

treatments that have protected us up 
to the present, and they all have a 
worrying tendency to travel. One 
disease departs and another arrives: 
in 1980, WHO announced the 
worldwide eradication of smallpox; in 
the following year, 1981, AIDS was 
identified for the first time. 
Meanwhile, major diseases like 
tuberculosis are re-emerging, new 
agents of infection such as the prion 
have been identified, several known 
diseases have developed resistance to 
the traditional antibiotics, and 
vaccine research is on the decline. In 
Botswana, the country most affected 
by the AIDS epidemic, a quarter of 
the adult population is infected by 
the AIDS virus. Life expectancy at 
birth has fallen from 61 years to 47 
years over the last decade, while, 
without the AIDS epidemic, it would 
now be 67 years. Life expectancy has 
also fallen in the Russian Federation 
and in several countries of the former 
USSR. 
There is a link between the 
education of girls and issues of 
population and development. There 
are plenty of case studies on the 
impact of the education of women on 
social development and health, and 
especially infant mortality and the 
birth rate. Is not the best form of 
contraception education for all 
throughout life? 
World population growth is 
accompanied by a massive 
urbanization, accelerated by 
economic and social changes, which 
is bringing about a change of scale in 
the cities and is accompanied by 
unprecedented phenomena and

natural and cultural resources; the 
right to housing; new problems of 
urban citizenship and the contraction 
of public space). If these trends are 
confirmed, it has been estimated that 
the equivalent of a thousand cities of 
3 million inhabitants would have to 
be built over the next 40 years - 
almost as many cities as exist today. 
Urban expansion is now strongest 
in the poorest regions — where it is 
unaccompanied by real development 
— but also in those regions which 
are experiencing the most rapid 
economic growth. In the latter case, 
a “boom” often produces a chaotic 
explosion which gives rise to 
considerable problems relating to the 
provision of drinking water, energy 
and food security, and to violence, 
marginalization and exclusion. 
Consequently, many countries have 
experienced a growth of “gated 
communities” surrounded by walls, 
protected by barriers or isolated 
by distance. In the United States, 
between four million and eight 
million people, according to some 
assessments, live like this in 
very highly protected residential 
areas. According to an OECD report 
published in 1996, 35 million 
Americans live in 150,000 
communities managed by private 
associations. 
Attracted by the bright lights of the 
city, millions of people leave the 
poverty of rural areas to go and live 
in the wretched “accompanied 
loneliness” of large cities, where they 
often find themselves lacking 
the most elementary amenities, 
Urban growth is now 
strongest in the poorest 
regions 
such as schools, sanitation or basic 
infrastructure, in a situation of 
poverty and exclusion that often 
provides fertile ground for violence 
and extremism. In such situations, 
how are cities to be humanized? 
How are habits of urban behaviour 
and civility to be re-created? How are 
the excluded to be assimilated?

UNESCO | the new Courier | May 2002 
The world’s 
environment in danger 
now know that failing 
N l widespread measures, the 
impact of human activity on the 
global environment threatens the 
survival of the biosphere and future 
generations: 
Global climatic warming largely 
results, according to the vast majority 
of scientists, from “greenhouse gas” 
emissions caused by human activity 
and modern modes of consumption, 
primarily those which are bound up 
with urbanization (thermal power 
plants, industrial pollution, motor 
traffic, etc.). The thawing of the 
Earth’s glaciers would lead to a 
veritable ecological disaster. Global 
warming also seems to be 
accompanied by greater variability 
and considerable regional or local 
disturbances. These could be the 
cause of radical climatic changes in 
some regions of the world and of a 
growing number of increasingly 
serious “natural” disasters whose 
precursory signs are already to be 
observed. It is nevertheless clear that, 
where control of greenhouse gas 
emissions is concerned, the progress 
made since the Rio Conference in 
1992 has had a limited impact, as 
shown by the problems of getting the 
Kyoto Protocol ratified. 
Water is not evenly distributed: it is 
abundant, it is “running”, but not 
everywhere and for everyone. Almost 
a quarter of humanity - 1.4 billion 
people — does not have access to 
clean and drinking water and over 
half the world’s population lacks 
proper sanitation. To meet the 
challenges will require above all 
policies on the judicious use of water 
resources so as to put an end to the 
excessive consumption of water in 
agriculture, which at present uses up 
worldwide close to two thirds of all 
the water taken from rivers, lakes, 
streams and underground. But 
behaviour patterns must also change. 
The depletion of the ozone layer, 
protector of life on Earth, has never 
been so great. But there are 
encouraging signs: if the provisions of 
international protocols are complied 
with, the ozone layer could be 
completely reconstituted by 2050. 
Desertification is spreading and 
today directly affects 250 million 
people and is threatening close to one 
billion human beings living on arid 
lands in approximately 110 countries. 
This figure could double by 2050 if 
desert areas continue to expand at 
the present rate. 
All natural environments are 
directly affected. While forests still 
cover a quarter of the planet’s land, 
the net loss of forest cover in the 
world is estimated at some 11.3

The rise of the 
information society 
Tl emergence, at greatly 
Ihe differing paces in the 
various parts of the world, of an 
information society is raising hopes 
regarding access to knowledge, 
communication and culture. But it 
will need to take up a major 
challenge: that posed by the unequal 
distribution of access between 
developed and developing countries, 
and even within countries. 
Many experts consider the 
informatics, telecommunications and 
broadcasting industries to be 
converging. Information, sound and 
images can nowadays be transmitted 
at high speed with the same digital 
coding processes. However, 
digitization and mathematization of 
the real are not without their 
drawbacks: a certain ontological link 
with reality slackens, opening the 
way to many abuses, of which image 
manipulation and electronic tricks are 
a foretaste. But above all, the spread 
of digital representations encourages 
a certain confusion between truth 
and fiction, nature and artifice, reality 
and the depiction of what we believe 
to be reality. It encourages the 
manipulation of codes, images and 
symbols. 
The rapid development of new 
technologies nevertheless raises great 
expectations since it creates a new 
generation of instruments that can

assist development, education and 
the transmission of knowledge, 
democracy and pluralism. But the 
ongoing revolution also raises some 
essential questions about the 
consequences of this form of 
“globalization.” Apart from the 
industrial innovation that the new 
information and communication 
technologies introduce, societal 
options can be discerned. How can 
we help “maintain, increase and 
diffuse knowledge,” as UNESCO’s 
Charter requires, in this radically new 
context? Some are already speaking 
indiscriminately of the “information 
society” and the “knowledge society”. 
Should we not stop confusing 
“information” and “knowledge”? The 
oversupply of information may be 
condemning knowledge — which 
involves mastery of information 
through knowledge and critical 
reflection. In short, education. 
UNESCO | the new Courier | May 2002 
Most of all, participation in the 
“civilization of the immaterial” is 
extremely patchy in different parts of 
the world. How can we fight against 
“techno-apartheid” when, as we 
know, the new technologies are one 
of the keys to the 21st century, to 
accessing information and setting up 
distance education networks? A 
system where five per cent of people 
have access to new information 
sources such as the Internet is surely, 
“undemocratic and structurally 
unsound system” as Paul Kennedy 
suggested at UNESCO’s 21st Century 
Talks.

Towards

The role of women

Of all the inequalities linked 
to development, gender 
inequality is one of the most specific, 
cutting across all countries, even 
those that are most advanced and 
proudest of their achievements in this 
regard. Contrary to received wisdom, 
progress in gender equality is not 
always related to the wealth of a 
country, or even - at first sight more 
surprisingly - to the level of what 
UNDP calls “human development.” It 
is more a question of how 
development is viewed, of political 
will, cultural change, and the 
commitment of society at large.

UNESCO’s fields of competence. In 
view of these advances, the role of 
women should grow during the first 
decades of the 21st century and most 
societies should move towards greater 
gender equality. 
The most remarkable advances are 
those that have been made in 
education. Significant progress has 
also been achieved with regard to 
health: the life expectancy of women 
has risen at a rate 20 percent higher 
than that of men during the past 20 
years; their average fertility rate has 
fallen by one third. Very slowly, the 
gateways to political power are 
opening up to women, at least in 
some countries. Despite popular 
belief, this progress has been even 
more appreciable in the South. 
However, the progress achieved over 
the past 30 years in the fields of 
education, health and participation has 
far from eliminated all the obstacles. 
With regard to education, nearly two 
thirds of the 880 million illiterates in 
the world are women, and one adult 
woman in three today cannot read or 
write; most of them live in rural areas. 
Despite their specific health and 
nutrition needs, women, particularly in 
the Third World, receive poorer care 
than men. In politics and in the

is probable that the rise of 
t the new information and 
communication technologies, 
information networking, and growing 
interactivity and interconnectivity will 
substantially and permanently alter 
not only the economic, social and 
political landscape, but also the 
cultural landscape in the coming 
decades. 
The key question is whether 
globalization and the new technologies 
will promote the rise of cultural 
pluralism, dialogue and cross-cultural 
encounters. If so, what will be the 
nature of those encounters? Will they 
be rewarding and creative, or will they 
be hostile and destructive? Are we 
heading for a “clash of civilizations” or 
cultural and ethnic hybridization? 
Will the new encounters between 
cultures will lead to the dominance of 
one or more of them over the others 
’¥ New cross-cultural 
4 encounters 
(even the cultural homogenization 
feared by some). Or will they 
exacerbate cultural differences and 
bring about new cultural 
fragmentation? Put another way, what 
will happen to the rich diversity of 
cultures in an increasingly global, 
“networked” and interconnected 
world? Let us not forget that at least 
half (or perhaps a lot more) of the 
5,000 to 6,700 languages spoken in the 
world today may die out by the end 
of this century. 
Will cultural identities, over the 
coming decades, replace citizenship or 
help to reinforce and reinvent it? 
According to French sociologist Alain 
Touraine, “the central question to 
which political thought and action 
must respond” is “how to restore a link 
between the excessively open space 
of the economy and the extremely 
closed and fragmented world of 
cultures?” Another question then 
arises: what type of identities and what 
sorts of authorities will be fostered by 
the information society and the 
information networks? 
The technologization of culture is 
another observable trend. The 
application to culture of industrial 
techniques, while helping to 
disseminate culture, may also presage 
the disappearance of traditional ways 
of producing and transmitting it. Will

the new facilities for duplicating, 
disseminating, recomposing and 
manipulating images and sounds speed 
the rise of a society of pretence and a 
fully virtual era? What will intellectual 
property mean in the new context? 
What will the future of copyright be? 
The 21st century will have to meet 
another challenge: how to ensure the 
access of all to culture, and to all 
cultures. How can we foster genuine 
dialogue between cultures? In what 
direction is the digital world moving: 
will networks be opening up or 
becoming more exclusive? In this 
context, one of the major issues of the 
  
coming decades will surely be 
development of information in the 
public domain and providing equal 
access to it, in particular in developing 
countries. 
What effect will the new 
technologies have on books and 
reading? The increasing digitization of 
written texts and the development of 
new aids are already giving rise to new 
forms of writing and reading but also 
of printing and circulating material; 
books are becoming a form of raw 
material that can be manipulated 
endlessly. With interactivity, readers 
now have an almost infinite number of 
  
  
choices with regard to texts and, as a 
result, reading could become genuinely 
plural and pluralist. 
What is more, the new technologies 
will be bringing about marked changes 
in the creation and communication of 
knowledge. In the 21st century, 
textbooks and educational texts in 
general might be designed with a view 
to greater interactivity between the 
various fields of knowledge in order to 
meet the individual needs and tastes of 
every learner. They would thus 
encourage self-instruction and self- 
learning and a new way of reading 
akin to navigation. 
Another major trend is the 
development of the notion of heritage, 
which has broadened over the last few 
decades from preservation of the 
cultural and natural to recognition of 
intangible, symbolic and spiritual 
heritage and then to protection of the 
human genome. What will the new 
terrain of heritage be like in coming 
decades?

UNESCO | the new Courier | May 2002 
Science and technology: 
the new ethical 
ay many advances in 
he biotechnology, genetics, 
astrophysics and the sciences of the 
infinitely large and the infinitely 
small are revolutionizing our 
perception of living things and the 
world around us. 
In many cases these scientific and 
technological advances hold the 
promise of positive applications for 
the benefit of humankind. This is 
true of progress in genetic 
engineering, which is paving the way 
for new gene therapies. It also applies 
to the development of energy-efficient 
techniques and the field of 
nanotechnology, which concerns 
medicine and computer technology. 
Use of biotechnology in agriculture 
could, if properly controlled, help 
combat food shortages. 
But these advances also raise 
questions and ethical concerns. To 
begin with, there is the application of 
technology to living organisms, 
especially human beings. Will the 
power to artificialize nature and 
manipulate species - even the human 
species — take us into the “brave new 
world” foreseen by Aldous Huxley 
and an ethically unacceptable 
situation in which humans 
domesticate other humans? What 
status will human beings have when 
they are the object of manipulation,

experimentation, mutilation or even 
destruction? What, in this new 
context, will be the meaning of life 
and death? Who will decide on the 
supposed “usefulness” of a particular 
genetic feature? Parallel manipulation 
of the genetic heritage of plant and 
animal species will in future decades 
surely be an unprecedented challenge 
for the global environment. 
Over and above society and the 
environment, the very definition of 
the human species and its biological 
integrity is at stake and in danger. 
Human beings can now alter the 
genetic heritage of any species, 
including their own. They even have 
the dismal privilege of being able to 
plan their own destruction. What 
must be done now is to agree to 
limit, through ethical guidelines and 
wisdom, the currently boundless 
power of technology. We must apply 
to technology Montesquieu’s maxim 
that absolute power corrupts 
absolutely. We must apply to science 
Rabelais’ observation that science 
without conscience is but the ruin of 
the soul.

“The dying and disappearance of 
languages has been going on for 
thousands of years as a natural event 
in Burman society, but at a sow rete,” 
sayy the study, funded by the United 
‘Nations Educational, Scientific und 
Cultursd Organization and published 
on Thursday 
"However, the past 300 years ar so 
have seen A dramatic Increase in the 
| death or disappearance of Bnguages

The study, an updated and ex- 
panded versson of the first edition 
that appeared in 1996, pinposnts 
threatened languages in “crisis 
areas” on a series of maps on i scale 
ranging from “potentially endan-

“The loss of any one language 
means a contractyon, reduction and 
impoverishment of the sum total of

“When their languages and cub

The study cites the Americas and 
Australia as having the worst record 
over the past century, with hundreds

UNESCO’S law on wrecks 
UNESCO has recently Introduced a dr 
a document that has taken four years to 
complete and bans all underwater wrecks from being looted by privately 
funded commercial salvage and treasure hunters. 
More than 3 million shipwrecks are estimated 
to lie in across the world. Current laws 
glve of different countries rights over 
what is found in their coastal watersy but not in 
international waters, and there is no law that 
preservation enforces the universal of wrecks. 
UNESCO's main concern is that artifacts 
salvaged by private companies are not properly 
protected and recorded, and are often dispersed 
worldwide when sold to collectors, thus dimin- 
ishing the heritage value. The draft convention 
has to be ratified by at least 20 countries before 
it will be adopted. iw A

New DE, January 30 
An independent newspaper, 
Kabul Weekly, has hit the news- 
stands in the Afghan capital after 
five years with the help of 
UNESCO. 
Sources in UNESQO House 
here said the paper was one of the 
first independent media publica- 
tions to appear in the wake of the b 
Taliban defeat. ‘ 
The first issue of the revived 
paper was put together in less 
than two months by joumalists 
who founded Kabul Weekly 
(Hafteh Nameyeh Kabol) in Feb. 
ruary 1993 in the midst of dis- 
putes between rival Mujahideen 
factions. 
UNESCO contributed to the 
relaunch with a grant of $12,000 
and is armnging more funds to 
keep the paper afloat. The 
relaunched paper had a print order 
of 2,500 copies in Kabul, 
The paper has an all-Afghan 
staff comprising 11 men and three 
women (in the age-group of 28 to 
35) and is produced with the help 
of a French NGO, Alna. The edi- 
tor is Mohammed Fahim Dashty 
who had survived the bomb attack 
which killed Northern Alliance 
chief Ahmed Masood, :

AVEDA & UNESCO/UNEP/RARE 
 
al goal of developing sustainable 
hese in some of the 
world’s most beautiful, yet fragile natural 
environments received a boost earlier this 
year with the announcement of 
US$1 million to support a project that 
links conservation and tourism at six 
World Heritage sites. In the initiative, the 
cosmetics company, Aveda, agreed to 
give US $500,000 to the project, jointly 
managed by UNESCO, the United Nations 
Environment Programme (UNEP) and the 
RARE Center for Tropical Conservation. 
The United Nations Foundation (UNF) is 
matching the new funds with an equal 
amount. 
The project, which uses tourism to help 
mitigate threats to conservation of 
biological diversity, could become a 
blueprint for initiatives elsewhere, where 
the demands of tourists can be balanced 
with the needs and cultural traditions of 
local people, the landscape and 
environment. By working with managers, 
industry and local people the Heritage 
sites project aims to bring together 
conservation education, planning, 
business development, training and 
marketing techniques to create a model 
for using tourism to promote the 
protection of important habitats. A key 
part of the project is to involve tour 
operators in site specific activities so as 
to create better tourism products and 
sustainable management systems. 
According to UNF’s Seema Paul, "There 
is no doubt that tourism can be 
beneficial, but there are not very many 
successful models of eco-tourism - 
meaning tourism that is ecologically 
sustainable. Our idea is to experiment 
with these programs in order to find the 
UNESCO | the new Courier | May 2002 
 
best way to capture tourism revenues for 
the local community and the site, and 
then to apply those ideas to other sites." 
Key objectives of the World Heritage site 
project are to ensure that tourism is 
sustainable and does not negatively 
impact these places. But there is also the 
issue of why sites need to develop 
tourism in the first place - to generate 
income for parks and economic 
incentives for local communities. Many 
local managers of World Heritage sites 
are looking to sustainable tourism as a 
means of balancing the need for 
economic development with 
conservation, by bringing income into 
cash-strapped park budgets and 
impoverished local communities. 
The World Heritage sites to benefit from 
the new funding are the Sian Ka’an and 
El Vizcaino biosphere reserves in Mexico, 
Tikal national park in Guatemala, the Rio 
Platano biosphere reserve in Honduras, 
and the Komodo and Ujung Kulon 
national parks in Indonesia.

ASE & UNESCO 
 
Monkey business in space 
UNESCO and the European Space Agency 
have joined forces to check on the health of 
the gorilla population in the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo. 
The gorillas are having a tough time of it. Since the mid-1990s 
they’ve had to share their homelands - notably the World 
Heritage listed Kahuzi-Biega National Park - with tens of 
thousands of refugees, who've fled the numerous political 
upheavals in the countries around Africa’s Great Lakes region.

Seeking food and shelter, the refugees have cut down vast 
swathes of forest and hunted the gorillas for their meat or 
to sell them to traffickers who resell them to the highest bidder 
as pets. 
The destruction of the gorillas’ habitat has been further 
aggravated by the discovery of coltan (colombo tantalite), 
in the region. This precious hardening agent for metal is used 
in a range of high-tech industries, including the manufacture 
of mobile telephones. 
The World Conservation Union (IUCN) reports that the illegal 
mining of this substance in Kahuzi Biega and the Okapi 
Wildlife Reserve in the east of the country is “seriously 
impacting on the ecology of these sites,” and that “the wildlife 
is being des-troyed at an alarming rate.” 
The precise extent of the damage though is not known. 
To help answer that question, UNESCO is working with the 
European Space Agency (ESA) to analyse satellite images of the 
region. Such analysis will allow the experts to evaluate the 
degradation of the primates habitat, and allow UNESCO and 
local authorities to then work out ways of improving the 
situation. 
Other leading space agencies, including NASA and the 
Canadian Space Agency are also interested in coming on board.

The language of Discovery 
  
help save endangered 
languages, Discovery 
Channel, the world’s 
leading non-fiction enter- 
tainment channel, has joined 
forces with UNESCO. 
This new partnership, 
finalized mid-April, will serve to 
the channel’s fans in 154 
countries more aware of the 
world’s extraordinary linguistic 
heritage. 
UNESCO | the new Courier | May 2002 
Under the agreement, UNESCO 
will provide Discovery with 
critical information about 
specific cultures and languages 
at risk (see p.37). The 
organization will also facilitate 
contacts with prominent 
linguists and researchers also 
working to save the some 3,000 
languages considered under 
threat. In return, the channel 
will produce special 
programmes for broadcast in 33 
languages to the 125 million 
households Discovery reaches 
outside the United States. 
As a result of globalisation 
and the homogenizing influence 
of information technology, 
thousands of languages could be 
lost of this century. Yet, a 
language under threat, or even 
considered as having died out, 
can be saved through pro-active 
language policies. At the end of 
the 80s in Japan, for example, 
there were only eight people left 
on the island of Hokkaido who 
knew how to speak Ainu. A 
museum devoted to the 
language was established and 
courses offered to young people 
and today Ainu is on its way 
back. Even those languages 
considered extinct can be 
“raised from the dead”. Such is 
the case with Cornish, in 
England, which died out in 1777 
but has been in recent years, 
with nearly 1,000 people now 
speaking it as a second 
language. 
The UNESCO-Discovery 
Channel partnership is also 
supported by the UN Works 
Programe, which aims to make 
the activities of the UN family 
and their impact on people’s 
lives better known throughout 
the world.

3 November 1958: 
TNNEICO's nem buildings ave officially opened 
NESCO’s special mission - to build peace on 
the foundation “of the intellectual and moral 
solidarity of mankind” - called for a grand 
architectural statement. This was achieved, according 
to Luther Evans, the Organization’s then Director- 
General. At the opening of the new building, 
he praised its “harmony” which, he said “attains 
the purity of a symbol”. 
The two years of surveys and research before 
actual construction began included broad cooperation 
between the greatest architects of the time —- Walter 
Gropius (United States), Le Corbusier (France), 
Ernesto Rogers (Italy), Sven Markelius (Sweden) 
and Lucio Costa (Brazil). 
The planners conceived a big work of art and 
from the beginning the architecture was blended with 
 
paintings, sculpture, tapestry and other artistic forms. 
Control of the project was given to three architects. 
Bernard Zehrfuss (France) was in charge of the 
overall planning. Marcel Breuer (United States) 
conceived the main building in a Y-shape and the 
Conference Hall in the shape of an egg. Luigi Nervi 
(Italy) designs the 72 ribbed beton brut pillars on 
which the main building rests. 
UNESCO finally moved into its new home on 
3 November 1958, on a three-hectare site donated 
by the French government at the Place de Fontenoy, 
next to the Ecole Militaire and not far from the 
Champs de Mars - “in a quintessentially French 
landscape” as Evans put it.

iosphere reserves 
Special places for people and nature 
    
UNESCO 
Publishing 
78 
Thirty years ago, an international group 
of ecologists began experimenting with a radical new 
concept, sustainable development. But instead 
of debating the merits of the concept and its tools 
in university halls or institutes, they set up a series 
of “open-air” laboratories or biosphere reserves 
through UNESCO’s Man and the Biosphere (MAB) 
programme. Those testing grounds now span 
thousands of kilometres, from the Egyptian desert 
to the tundra of Greenland. Moreover, the importance 
of the original experiment intensifies daily, with 
practically every plant species or water source   affected one way or another by unbridled population 
growth and economic consumerism. 
“Biosphere Reserves — Special Places for People and Nature” 
traces the progress and pitfalls of MAB’s quest to develop 
the concept and tools of sustainable development. By 
recounting the history of MAB, the authors take a critical 
look at conservation. In the not-so-distant past, colonial and 
romantic notions of pristine landscapes were used to brand 
indigenous peoples as enemies of reserves from southern 
Africa to northern America. Yet today, growing respect 
for indigenous land rights takes on an ecological dimension 
as scientists find that cultural diversity plays an essential role 
in preserving biodiversity. The book provides several 
examples in which biosphere reserves play pivotal roles in 
current environmental debates. 
  
For example, the number of species threatened with

In the southern region of the Czech Republic, the Trebon 
Basin has been shaped by human activities for more than 
eight centuries. The result is a diverse semi-natural 
countryside — a mosaic of more than 500 artificial 
fishponds, deciduous and coniferous forests, meadows, 
fields and wetlands crossed by numerous small streams, 
canals and dykes. Inscribed on the list of UNESCO’s world 
Network of Biosphere Reserves in 1977, Trebon is also one 
of about 60 reserves worldwide that are part of the Ramsar 
Convention on Wetlands. 
This volume of the Man and the Biosphere series, 
renowned for its scientific rigour and precision, presents the 
major research findings of nearly one hundred researchers 
studying at Tfebon over the last few decades. These 
scientists have worked at a wide range of different 
disciplines, space and time scales as well as levels of 
biological complexity, from the cellular to the ecosystem. 
Their research findings are grouped in five sections: the key 
role of wetlands in the Tfebon Basin; fishpond management 
and its ecological consequences; the wetlands surrounding 
an ancient man-made lake; marginalized mires and 
peatlands; and future prospects for the Trebonl wetlands, 
including their ecological and socio-economic functions.

to contribute to the protection of “biological hotspots”, 
where exceptional concentrations of endemic species are 
undergoing major loss of habitat. However, other experts 
fear that by focusing on hotspots, we may indirectly give 
the green light to ravage or neglect areas surrounding 
areas, which require protection. 
This book will serve as a useful guide for anyone 
involved or interested in the MAB network- from 
national leaders to research students and even local 
farmers. After laying the analytical and historical 
foundations of the MAB concept as 
well as major environmental 
conventions, the book presents 
concise portraits of diverse 
reserves to highlight 
accomplishments as well as 
difficulties encountered in 
promoting sustainable 
development in different socio- 
economic, cultural and geographic 
contexts. The Maya Biosphere 
Reserve of Guatemala, for 
example, has been engulfed 
by a steady stream of poor settlers 
in search of land, which threatens 
the fragile ecology, economy and 
Freshwater wetlands 
and their sustainable 
future

social relations with the indigenous population. A major 
effort is now underway to diversify local income. Other 
reserves offer important lessons on rehabilitating 
degraded ecosystems, such as the mangroves of Can Gio 
in Viet Nam. After 25 years of intensive efforts to recover 
this delicate ecosystem, national and local authorities 
are now trying to integrate protective measures with 
plans to enlarge local fisheries. 
From the monitoring of invasive alien plant species 
to long-term studies on forest chimpanzees, the book 
shows how communities and leaders of the reserves have 
dealt with very different financial resources. Canadian 
authorities use the latest satellite images to track 
landscape changes, while in western Africa, reserves 
are investing in solar-powered ranger stations and health 
clinics for local communities. Local herders in both 
the Bookmark reserve in southern Australia and 
the Xilingol reserve of Inner Mongolia are working 
together to find ways to better manage semi-arid grazing 
lands. Innovative twinning projects of this kind 
highlight another key MAB ingredient: regional and 
international co-operation.

Growing Up in Cities 
Children have the right to express their 
views freely in all matters affecting them, 
states Article 12 of the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child. A right that is almost 
never enforced as far as their urban 
environment is concerned, where more than 
half the children of the world live. This is a 
pity, because when children are given a 
chance to express their views and to 
participate in urban decision making, as the 
Growing up in Cities Project did in eight 
countries between 1996 and 1998, they 
know better than adults the local barriers 
and resources that shape the quality of their

affordable education and transportation, 
freedom of movement, accessible green 
spaces and recreation places, and safe, 
animated street life. These are the qualities 
of better cities for everyone. By taking part 
in decisions, young people also have 
opportunities to break down 
misunderstandings between generations and 
learn essential skills of citizenship, as shown 
with the examples of Melbourne and 
Johannesburg, two cities which have 
integrated the children’s recommendations.

Languages 
in Danger 
of Disappearing 
New revised edition 
Close to half of the 6,000 
languages spoken in the world 
are doomed or likely to 
disappear in the foreseeable 
future. The disappearance of any 
language is an irreparable loss 
for the heritage of all 
humankind. This new edition 
of the “Atlas of the World's 
Languages in Danger 
of Disappearing”, first published 
in 1996, is intended to give a 
graphic picture of the magnitude 
of the problem in many parts 
of the world. The reader will 
find a comprehensive list 
of languages in danger and 
a concise summary 
of the worldwide language 
endangerment situation.
