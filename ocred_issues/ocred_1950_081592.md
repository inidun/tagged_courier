UNITED NATIONS DAY 
October 24, 1950 
‘*“ There shall be peace >> 
“There shall be peace.” This has been decided. WE have 
decided it—we, the peoples of the United Nations, who constitute 
more than nine tenths of the people on the face of the earth. 
For once, let us be impatient. Let us brush aside all the timi- 
dities, the hesitancies of mere talk about the ‘“hope” of men, 
women and children to have the chance to live in peace. It has 
been decided. There is more than talk and hope. 
For, five years ago our DETERMINATION that there shall be peace 
was written — written not only in ink but large and clear enough 
in our faith and will to justify all the blood, sweat and tears that 
had gone before. Five years ago, we said in our Charter, the 
Charter of the United Nations, that we are: “DETERMINED to 
save succeeding generations from the scourge of war.” Now, five 
years later, the slogan for United Nations Day — for the generation 
of the United Nations, for the century of the United Nations — is: 
“THERE SHALL BE PEACE.” 
But peace is not merely an absence of war — a refuge for cowards, 
a cave for hermits, a playground for idlers — a kind of surrender 
in the face of the enemy. 
Peace calls for heroes, who do more than hold their ground and 
rest on their fading laurels. It comes from the power, the courage, 
the intelligence of man, age-old weapons against the {raditional 
enemies of men — war, famine, pestilence, ignorance. 
This is the kind of peace we are building — we the peoples of 
the United Nations — five years after we signed the covenant we 
call the Charter. . 
And of the new weapons we are using, the new tools we are 
using, none is more important than the United Nations Programme 
for Technical Assistance. For this programme will help in a great 
task of peace — a difficult, yet entirely feasible task — nothing less 
than the remaking of the world — in which men, women and 
children may live in the reality of peace and with the sound hope 
for a better life.

Nations Secretary-General and M. Jaime Torres Bodet, 
Unesco's Director-General, are published in page 3 of this

### 81586: A Science museum goes on tour in Latin America

A SCIENCE MUSEUM GOE 
IN LATIN AMERICA 
HE National Library of Peru, 
| in the heart of Lima, created 
a traffic jam early last month, 
which was repeated every day for 
more than two weeks. Outside the 
library, the sidewalk was crowded 
with adults and children. As they 
filed past the entrance, they were 
counted by a photo-electric cell, 
clicking monotonously at a rate 
which went as high as 5,000 visitors 
a day. 
The attraction was a travelling 
museum, intended to explain simply 
the newest developments in science. 
The story of crowds in front of the 
National Library in Lima goes back 
to Paris—to Unesco’s Department 
of Natural Sciences. There the idea 
was first conceived of a prefabricated 
museum, which could be crated, pla- 
ced in a train or the hold of a ship 
and then set up on short notice. 
The purpose of the museum was to 
take science out of the bewildering 
terminology of the laboratory and 
bring it to the public in Latin 
America—both to adults and chil- 
dren. Unesco’s funds, however, 
were limited, and the museum 
became a reality only with the offer 
of help from universities and science 
organizations in the United States. 
When, last August, the museum 
had been stowed in Boston aboard a 
ship bound for Callao, Peru, it repre- 
sented the combined efforts of 
Unesco, the Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology, the Harvard College 
Observatory and the Science Clubs 
of America. Its construction was 
carried out under the eyes of 
Mrs. Christine Buechner, an official 
of the National Research Council of 
the United States. 
The portable museum’s first stop 
was Lima, where it was shown under 
the auspices of the Peruvian Minis- 
try of Education. After the coun- 
try’s senate registered a vote of 
thanks to Dr. Jaimes Torres Bodet. 
Unesco’s Director-General, the 
museum moved on to Quito, capital 
of Ecuador. It is scheduled for a

December appearance in Havana 
next month, during a conference of 
representatives of Unesco National 
Commissions in the Western 
Hemisphere. 
Trip To The Stars 
o far, the astronomy section of the 
museum has proved to be one 
of the biggest attractions. 
There, a portable planetarium, which 
can be viewed by as many as sixty 
persons at a time, takes visitors on 
a trip to the stars. (At the end of 
its run, the planetarium folds up into 
units no larger than a table.) 
This astronomy section also inclu- 
des photographs of such phenomena 
as comets, sunspots and meteorites 
as well as illustrated explanations of 
the workings of the solar system and 
of the giant telescopes used to study 
it. Part of this section is devoted 
to a telescope built by an amateur 
astronomer to demonstrate that this 
science can be appreciated and 
enjoyed with simple equipment—the 
kind that a schoolboy might cons- 
truct. 
The physics exhibit fs the first to 
greet the visitor, since it begins with 
the beam of light broken on entering 
the museum, setting the photo- 
electric cell in operation and auto- 
matically recording the visitor's 
entrance. It displays operations in 
mechanics, heat, sound, electricity 
and electronics, optics and nuclear 
physics. 
Among the equipment which the

whose exhibits included a portable planetarium. 
museum displays is a triple-axis 
motordriven gyroscope which visitors 
are invited to attempt to push off 
balance. Then there is a Van de 
Graaf generator, an electrostatic 
machine that builds up high voltages 
by charges carried on a moving belt. 
This machine, which steps up the 
speed of slow-moving ions (posi- 
tively-charged particles) or electrons 
(negatively-charged particles) is 
often used by scientists to investigate 
nuclear atomic structure or to pro- 
duce high-power X-rays. 
As a whole, the museum is desi- 
gned to be understandable to children 
and yet valuable to adults who have 
some background in science. 
Although there are simple models to 
explain each principle, the texts 
accompanying the display develop 
the theories and the applications of 
these principles. 
This travelling science museum is 
much more than an educational road 
show. Its main objective is to give 
youth in Latin America a good look 
into the wonders of modern science 
in the confidence that this will 
encourage some of these boys and 
girls to make science their life work 
and thus to become the technicians 
and the engineers their countries 
need so urgently. 


### 74450: Educators seek answers to problems of primary schools in the Americas

EDUCATORS SEEK ANSWERS TO PROBLEMS 
OF PRIMARY SCHOOLS IN THE AMERICAS 
Brazilian cducator described the 
state of primary education in most 
Latin American countries in the 
following terms: 
“Quer a large part of the continent, 
primary schooling is not only in- 
adequate, it cannot even fulfil its allol- 
ed task of helping to raise the commu- 
nity’s standard of living This explains 
the people’s indifference to it, the poor 
school attendance and leachers’ lack of 
social prestige and their low salaries.” 
Jo over a year ago, an eminent 
The educalor, Professor Lourengo 
Filho, of Brazil, was making the closing 
speech at the Inter-American Seminar

cation, whose work he had directed,

up the findings of a seminar group 
which dealt wilh problems of primary 
education and which reported: “its 
quantitative and qualitative deficiencies 
are one of the principal causes of illite- 
racy on the continent.” B 
Last month, solutions to some of the 
tremendous difficulties facing primary 
schools in the Americas, where 
19,000,000 children of school age are 
deprived of schools, were again being 
sought by a group of educators, this 
time, at a Seminar entirely devoted to 
primary education. 
The Seminar, which was formally 
opened in Monlevideo on October 2nd, 
sponsored by the Government of Uru- 
guay, the Organization of American 
Slates and Unesco. was in reality a 
continuation of work done by the 1949 
Seminar in Rio. 
Three Vital Questions 
LTHOUGH most discussions concern- 
A ed Latin American problems, ex- 
perts had come from other parts 
of the world to discuss those common 
to their own areas and to contribute 
their knowledge and experience to the 
work of the various study groups. 
Unesco contributed extensive inform- 
ation on primary education in non-Ame- 
rican countries and sent to the Seminar 
four distinguished specialists,—Mr. Ro- 
bert Dottrens. Director of the Geneva 
Institul. universitaire des Seienees de 
"Education, Professor P. Rossello, \s- 
sistant Director of the International Bu- 
reau of Education, Mr. Giovanni Vozzer, 
Secretary of the Italian Commission for 
Educational Reconstruction, and Mr. Fa- 
ker Akel, Inspector of Schools and Pro- 
fessor of Education. 
The seminar study groups had before 
them five main themes for discussion: 
the organization of elementary school 
syslems; plans, curricula and methods: 
universal, free and compulsory educa- 
tion; the edueation of teachers. and 
textbooks and schools materials. 
Some of the vital questions for which 
these educators were seeking the most 
effective answers were ciled by Unes- 
co's Director-General. M. Jaime Torres 
Bodel, in a message to the Seminar. 
M. Torres Bodet said: “..The following 
three problems of primary educalion 
reserve, I feel, special consideration by 
Latin American educationalists: Jow 
may the lileracy campaign be speeded 
up cithout relaxing effort to introduce 
the necessary reforms in primary school 
curricula? How should curricula be 
varied to suit regional conditions, und 
more rationally adapted to the needs 
of rural conununities? How is the prin- 
ciple of compulsory educalion to be 
made a reality? 
“In short, illiteracy must be resolute- 
ly stamped out, and living standards 
gradually raised, hrough a programme 
in which equally effective provision is 
made for primary education and for 
tileraey campaigns...” 
HE first Regional Conference of Unesco 
National Commissions—the co-operat- 
ing bodies set up by Unesco’'s Member 
States to associate their peoples with the 
work of the Organization—will open in 
Havana, Cuba, early next month. 
Representatives of National Commis- 
sions in nearly 20 countries in the Western 
Hemisphere will concentrate their efforts 
on educational, scientific and cultural pro- 
blems in Latin America, and Unesco’s 
possible contribution to their solution. 
The Conference, aided by Unesco's 
Regional Office in the Western Hemis- 
phere, at Havana, aims to make Unesco's 
programme and work better known among 
the general public and intellectual leaders 
of Latin America. It will also work to foster 
the growth and help perfect the working 
methods of National Commissions there. 
In addition, detailed studies will be 
made of subjects in Unesco's programme 
that are of special interest to Latin America. 
These include Fundamental Education,   
FIRST REGIONAL CONFERENGE OF UNESCO NATIONAL 
GOMMISSIONS TO GPEN IN HAVANA NEXT MONTH 
Technical Assistance, the organization 
of work of the National Commissions 
and the Dissemination of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights. This last 
subject will be of particular significance, 
as “Human Rights Day’ will be celebrated 
in all parts of the world on December 10th 
—two days after the Conference opens. 
Working parties will study this and other 
conference agenda subjects and their 
findings and recommendations will be 
submitted to plenary sessions, for prac- 
tical action to be taken by the National 
Commissions. 
A Committee of Experts will also dis- 
cuss Unesco’s contribution to international 
exchange of persons programmes, basic 
aspects of exchanges of persons and 
recommendations for the programme in 
Latin America. 
The Conference will end on December 
20th with the adoption of a work plan for 
the Latin American National Commissions 
for 1951.

the peace in freedom under the law 
which is alone consistent with their di- 
gnity. That answer, which is in con- 
flict with all the forces opposing « 
world organization, demands active 
assent to the two great postulates of the 
United Nations — solidarity in the face 
of aggression and mutual aid for the 
prosperity of all. 
If we wish to achieve total security, 
these two postulates are indivisible. 
The mutual interdependence of the 
peoples, at all levels of their activities, 
links the fates of all countries. Yet that 
circumstance might open the way to 
abuse of power by the strongest if 
there were no rule of law to impose 
upon all men the moral judgment of 
mankind. Thus solidarity must be ex- 
pressed in a system of international 
- law and in effective guarantees of se- 
curity. Co 
SELF-FULFILMENT UNDER 
LAW AND EQUITY 
NEG any solidarity bas- 
ed purely on detence of the sto- 
tus quo would run the risk of 
crystallizing those same conditions in 
which the weak and unfortunate feel, 
not without reason, that their legitimate 
aspirations are being thwarted. Such 
a solidarity as this, founded only to 
perpetuate a static situation, could not 
withstand the irresistible march of his- 
tory. Seeking only to stabilize what is 
by definition liable to change, it would 
be doomed to violent disruption unless 
balanced by that other principle which 
I have described as mutual aid bet- 
ween the nations. 
It is not a question of abolishing 
rights; rather must their enjoyment be 
extended to the largest possible num- 
ber of human beings. It is mutual aid 
between the nations which will ena- 
ble the weaker fully to play their pro- 
per part in the economic, political and 
moral organization of peace. In the 
United Nations system, while political 
organs such as the Security Council 
guard the peace, it is the task of the 
Economic and Social Council and the 
Specialized Agencies — the World 
Health Organization, the Food and 
Agriculture Organization, the Interna- 
tional Labour Organization, and Unes- 
co — to make this peace more fruit- 
tul for all. The object of these bodies 
is the same; to: afford every man the 
means of free self-fuliilment under a 
system of law and equity to which all 
have free access, in which all have 
their place.

of the new body was to

and mutual aid mindful both of the established order

Since then peace in freedom under the law has 
become the prey and the victim of conilicting propa-

so many lives were given, hove today become peri- 
lously ambiguous. A great wave of disappointment has 
swept over the world, begetting doubt, fear and

Was 
The purpose 
of collective security and mutual aid 
between the nations are not mere sub- 
jects for academic oratory; in the cour- 
se of this very year there have been 
two outstanding demonstrations of 
their effectiveness. 
The principle of collective security 
was challenged by armed attack 
against the Republic of Korea. Never 
have the United Nations and the Spe- 
cialized Agencies reacted with such 
singleness of mind. Each organization 
took steps to answer the victim's cry 
for aid; to help restore peace and, each 
in its own sphere, to ensure that, when 
peace returned, that peace should ha- 
ve its full human significance. It may 
be that «ll the general public has noti- 
ced is news of the battles in South 
Korea: nevertheless, what really gives 
to the sacrifice of the United Nations 
soldiers its true meaning is the hope 
that, when peace comes. health, work, 
culture and education will be not mi- 
nor considerations, but matters of pri- 
. me importance, and the fact that even 
now the Specialized Agencies are tak- 
ing practical steps to improve existing 
conditions as soon as the time for 
reconstruction comes. 
ARMED RESISTANCE 
IS NOT ENOUGH 
LMOST simultaneously with the 
Security Council's decisions on 
Koreq, the principle of mutual aid 
was strikingly demonstrated when the 
Conference on the United Nations pro- 
gramme for Technical Assistance, with 
its 54 participating countries, approved 
the allocation of more than twenty mil- 
lion dollars for the economic advance- 
ment of under-developed countries. 
Here we are no longer concerned with 
the restoration of peace on the princi- 
ple of collective security, but with rais- 
ing the standard of life of the peoples 
by helping them to develop their hu- 
man and material resources. 
It is obvious that the bond of unicn 
 
UNITED NATIONS DAY, OCTOBER 24, 1950 
“ WE THE PEOPLES OF THE UNITED NATIONS... ” World citizens 
of tomorrow read the preamble to the United Nations Charter. Every hour, 
every day, the work of the United Nations and its Specialized Agencies goes 
on all over the world—constructive work--work for peace that seldom gets 
into the headlines... 
between activities so different in them- 
selves must be a view of life derived 
from a particular concept of mankind. 
We are convinced that man will find 
the way to seli-fulfilment only in a 
community living in freedom under the 
law, and striving for social progress, —— 
in other words, seeking always to 
excel its own past. That is the order 
which the United Nations are endea- 
vouring to establish in a World 
of greed and passion. That is the order 
which Unesco would, through educa- 
tion, science and culture, wish to see 
reign in the minds of men and in the 
practice of their lives. 
Most of the criticism directed against 
the United Nations and their Speciali- 
zed Agencies springs from a defeatist 
attitude towards the heavy responsiki- 
lity laid on twentieth-century man to 
strive for a united world. Indifference 
to aggression is unthinkable, but it is 
just as wrong to imagine that armed 
resistance is enough in itself to avoid 
or repel aggression. The difficulties 
which the United Nations must inevi- 
tably encounter can only arouse the 
spirits of all men of goodwill. For this 
victory they must not spare their 
strength. Nevertheless what we must 
recall to the minds of the peoples in 
such days as these is not merely the 
fact that it is necessary to guarantee 
collective security, but also the prin- 
ciple which makes such a guarantee 
essential. That principle is the one 
which brought the United Nations and 
the Specialized Agencies into being 
— that peace, to be enduring, must 
be based on right — and that the 
rights which ensure the liberty and 
dignity of man must be won and de- 
fended, under collective security by 
mutual aid. 
Let us hope that, in the peaceful fu- 
ture to which Unesco is dedicated, the 
balance of these two forms of human 
solidarity may be preserved. The one 
is as necessary as the other for the 
safeguarding of peace and for our 
common progress.

mittee when it held its first meeting on

director-general would head a new body 
to be known as the Korean Rehabilitation 
Agency. This would be independent of 
other U.N. Commissions and would be 
completely responsible for the economic 
reconstruction of the country. 
Among his other tasks, its director- 
general would be required to determine 
the types of goods and services required 
for the aid programme, to obtain sea 
transport for these materials and to advise 
Korean authorities on the allocation of the 
aid.

T is now five years since the 
United Nations Charter set forth 
the principles of a new world 
order. The past twelve months have 
been dangerous and difficult for the 
nations and the peoples of the world; 
a future of danger and difficulty 
confronts us all. And yet the United 
Nations still stands; the forces of 
Member states have rallied around 
its flag to turn back armed aggres- 
sion; the Fifth Session of the General 
Assembly has begun with an unpre- 
cedented demonstration of purpose to 
work effectively for peace, 
It is this purpose to work for 
peace by every means available 
which — coupled with enduring 
patience — is needed to see us 
through. I have never imagined 
that there was an easy way. A year 
ago on the anniversary of the United 
Nations I said that the United 
Nations way is a slow and often 
discouraging way to go about the 
work of building a peaceful world, 
but there is no short-cut. 
The stake is the future of all 
mankind, the future of all cultures 
and all civilizations and all the varied 
ways of life which men have deve- 
loped to meet their needs and their 
circumstances. If we succeed, the 
future is limitless in its possibilities 
for growth and for good ; if we fail 
there will be no future worth the 
having for any of us. We must not 
fail. Coa 
NEXT TO PEACE — 
PROSPERITY 
EXT to the problem of peace, 
but allied to it, is the problem 
of raising the living standards 
of the many millions throughout the 
world who now exist in poverty. 
This problem, too, we must solve if 
we are to live together in amity and 
with a clear conscience. The United 
Nations in the past year has made a 
start towards solving this problem 
in the expanded programme of 
technical assistance; it is only a 
beginning, but a good one. We must 
follow through ; again we must not

THE KING OF TH 
civilization in advanced 
countries is frequently 
advanced as an argu- 
ment to demonstrate the basic 
superiority of the “white 
race” in character and intel- 
ligence. “Have the Negroes 
or the Indians produced a 
Plato, a Shakespeare, a Des- 
cartes, a Newton?” is the 
question which has greeted 
even the most convincing 
scientific evidence of the ba- 
sically equal abilities of ali 
branches of the human family. 
To compare such varied cul- 
tures in order to prove that 
the Negroes or Indians are 
congenitally inferior to the 
whites is a process of reason- 
ing withiour valve. The fun- 
aamental discoveries on Which 
our whole civilization has 
been built—fire, weaving, 
pottery, agriculture, rearing of 
stock—were made by men 
whose skin pigmentation is 
today unknown, but whose 
stage of development was 
certainly far behind that of 
the peoples of Africa or Ame- 
Ts rich complexity of 
by 
Dr. Alfred Metraux 
    
writing and instructed his 
people in its use, should help 
ill-informed sceptics to over- 
come their doubts about the 
creative spirit of the Negro 
race. The details of the 
following story are taken from 
an article written for a scien- 
tific journal by the French 
scientist Maurice Delafosse. 
In 1899, when the Germans 
cccupied his kingdom, Njoya 
needed to communicate with 
his village chiefs and with 
those of his people attached to 
the German Command, but he 
did not want the Germans to 
know wnat was in his letters. 
He therefore decided to invent 
a writing that the Europeans 
could not understand. Call- 
ing together his head men, he 
explained his plan and asked 
their assistance in finding 
signs for each of the words of 
thus creating a syllabic writ- 
ing. 
These signs acquired a pu- 
rely phonetic and conventional 
value, instead of suggesting 
objects or ideas. For instance, 
a calabash (ka) was first 
shown by the drawing of a 
gourd; later this same but 
simplified drawing was used 
to signify the syllable “ka” 
which forms part of many 
words. 
In a few years, Njoya had 
advanced from picture-writ- 
ing to a phonetical system — 
achieving what the Egyptians 
accomplished, and then in a 
very imperfect fashion, only 
after centuries of stumbling 
efforts. For a time, King 
Njoya’'s system of writing re- 
mained half-pictorial, half- 
phonetic, yet all the while the 
syllabic side was nevertheless 
being perfected. 
Five years later, the king, 
influenced this time by obser- 
vations made in a missionary 
school, introduced a new re- 
form by giving his system a 
purely alphabetic character.

living in an isolated region 
and provided with few cultural 
advantages, required far more 
genius to discover the bow or 
the boomerang than inventors 
today in their work to split 
the atom and to perfect the 
machines which are the pride 
of this modern age. 
Each new discovery is the 
product of people engaged in 
simultaneous research, who 
frequently arrive at identical 
results at the same time. La- 
boratories and research wor- 
kers collaborate so closely in 
this twentieth century that 
individual discoveries are be- 
coming increasingly rare and 
difficult to achieve. The pro- 
gress of our civilization 
indeed relies on this vast 
network of reciprocal contacts 
and on this collective research 
performed by teams of experts. 
To evolve a new technique 
from nothing, as one might 
say, is obviously a much slower 
and more difficult process. 
The Unknown Heroes 
ENTURIES ago, a poet 
sadly recalled the heroes 
who had died unknown, 
because there was no Homer 
at that time to record their 
valorous exploits for future 
generations. One could spe- 
culate on the number of great 
men who lived among the pri- 
mitive races but of whom we 
know nothing simply because, 
lacking the written word, all 
remembrance of them has 
been lost. If we study ancient 
chronicles, missionary ac- 
counts, books of travel and 
works of modern ethnogra- 
phers, we can discover an 
amazing gallery of talented 
men, even men of genius, 
among the so-called “inferior 
races”, who have been so 
lightly dubbed “the white 
man’s burden”. 
A man’s accomplishments 
are limited by his cultural 
background. The story of 
King Njoya of the Bamouns, 
in the Cameroons, who invent- 
ed, by himself, a system of 
ration with his counsellors, 
began as a picture language 
in symbols, each sign repre- 
senting either the drawing of 
a definite object or “the ma- 
terialised shape evoked by an 
abstract idea”. Each sign 
thus corresponded to a word, 
but without relation to the 
number of syllables in this 
word. 
A Stroke Of Genius 
EVERAL years later, Njoya 
conceived an idea that 
was truly a stroke of 
genius. Words were no longer 
to be represented by drawings, 
but the same drawings were 
to represent groups of sounds, 
first ten numbers. He stipu- 
lated that “each of the alpha- 
bet signs should represent one 
sound only, the numerical 
signs keeping, in addition, the 
value of figures”. 
Frankly speaking, this last 
step towards alphabetic writ- 
ing was by no means perfect. 
The royal phonetician did not 
succeed in breaking entirely 
free from syllabism, so the 
phonetic value of the 80 signs 
was not always clearly shown. 
Aware of the faults in his 
system, he made several 
attempts to simplify it. In 
1916, the year when his writ- 
ing-method was the subject of 
the story here outlined, his 
system seemed well on the 


### 81595: The King of the Bamouns and his alphabet

 
E BAMOUNS AND HIS ALPHABET 
Native kings. such as this West African ruler, must exercise judgement 
and statecraft of the same kind as heads of state in larger and more 
“advanced” countries, though the problems are different. But, men like 
these are little known to the world, chiefly for luck of Boswells. It was 
a native ‘ruler, Njova, King of the Bamouns. for example. who, with a 
superlative use of intelligence and initiative invented a form of picture 
writing, and within ten years transformed it into an efficient alphabet. 
The evolution of our own and similar alphabets took many centuries. 
way to becoming purely alpha- 
betic. The signs bore less and 
less relation to primitive pic- 
ture-symbols and became let- 
ters with increasingly simple 
outlines. 
A Royal Teacher 
NCE having evolved a 
method of writing, this 
wise man launched a 
large-scale campaign to teach 
the alphabet to his people. 
He bought slates from the 
whites and personally taught 
pupils who, in turn, became 
teachers. The period of ins- 
truction over, the king conti- 
nued to correspond with them 
and this interchange of letters 
kept alive their interest. BY 
the middle of 1907, more than 
600 of his subjects knew how 
to read and write. Njoya 
formed cffices of administra- 
tion, a public records depart- 
ment and a Registrar of re- 
ceipts and expenses. 
Attempts may be made to 
belittle the genius of Njoya by 
stating that he probably ob- 
tained the idea of writing 
from the Arabs or the whites. 
‘But this in no way detracts 
from the significance of his 
discovery. He may have 
known that the whites used 
written symbols to communi- 
cate with each other, but he 
certainly could have known 
nothing of the method. His 
own system originated out of 
his native intelligence and in- 
itiative. Let us also remember 
that cutting through time and 
tradition he achieved results 
in a few years that other sys- 


### 81596: Social science in the modern world

SOCIAL SCIENCE IN THE MODER 
ur. development of social 
sciences during the last 
fifty vears holds as rich 
‘a promise for mankind today as 
did natural sciences at the 
beginning of the last century. 
Man is alarmed by the bilter- 
ness and anguish which go with 
the transition from one form of 
civilization to another and 
demands to know if science can 
help him to understand the 
laws which govern the complex 
relationships between and 
within different societies and 
thus to control the great 
changes of our cpoch. 
The role of the social sciences 
within Unesco has bcen con- 
ceived 1o answer the specific 
aims upheld by the Organiz- 
ation. All activities must be 
specifically directed to serve 
the cause of peace within the 
international framework. To 
serve these two conditions has 
been the aim of the Department 
of Social Sciences. 
It is now time to draw pract- 
ical conclusions from research 
carried out over three years 
with the collaboration of scient- 
ific organizations and eminent 
specialists. The sum lotal of 
this knowledge offers a rational 
basis for the recommenda- 
tions that Unesco proposes lo 
place before governments and 
non-governmental organizations 
anxious to preserve peace. 
The programme, to be sub- 
mitied to Unesco's Executive 
Board this month, marks a 
definite step forward. It is 
proposed that Unesco inves- 
tigate the scientific methods 
and techniques which offer the 
best means for overcoming cer- 
tain existing tensions. 
Hundreds of governmental 
or private agencles in many 
countries are striving to abate 
racial prejudices and to fight 
the discriminatory measures 
which result from them. So- 
ciologists and psychologists, for 
their part, suggest new ways 
by which the energies at pre- 
sent wasted in fruitless fighting 
can be directed lo constructive 
ends. Groups and individuals 
continue their efforts in diffe- 
rent directions without refe- 
rence fo the experiences of 
their neighbours. To make 
these methods more widely 
known, to assess their effi- 
ciency and encourage the use 
of those which prove the best, 
is one of the tasks which falls 
to Unesco. 
Social tensions are fed by 
wrong ideas based on irrational 
beliefs or outmoded scientific 
interpretations. The authority 
that its international character 
gives Unesco, enables it to 
undertake a campaign lo put 
within the reach of the masses 
the results achieved by scieni- 
ists in their study of racial 
problems and the effect of 
the diseriminatory measures 
against minorities. 
Unesco played an important 
part in the drafting of the Uni- 
versal Declaration’ of Human 
Rights. It is, therefore, mo- 
rally responsible to uphold and 
disseminate these rights which 
it helped to formulate. Unesco 
must fight racism and all forms 
of social discrimination, in 
conformity with the spirit and 
letter of its Constitution. 
Unesco is making an impor- 
tant contribution to the United 
Nations broad programme of 
technical assistance to help 
economically under-developed 
countries to enjoy the benefits 
tems of writing known to us 
today took centuries and even 
thousands of years to attain. 
About the middle of the 
19th century, another Negro, 
Momuru Doalu Bukere of the 
Vai tribe in Liberia, invented 
a system of writing which won 
a certain fame. Based on the 
pictorial writing used by his 
tribe, he gave a phonetic value 
to the signs. Today, thousands 
of natives still use this system 
invented by the “noble and 
modest” Momuru Doalu Bu- 
ere. 
The story of King Njoya was 
deliberately chosen for this 
article because documents are 
available, and a study of them 
enables us to follow Njoya’s 
line of reasoning. Many 
examples of talent, sometimes 
of genius, could have been 
cited among primitive tribes. 
A great deal could be said of 
the Maya Indians of Central 
America, who, entirely removed 
from outside influences, had 
already—between two and 
three thousand years ago— 
discovered the zero and given 
a positional value to figures. 
The so-called “savage” or 
“barbarian” state does not 
originate from any congenital 
inability. It is simply one 
transitory form of culture 
among others, equally trans- 
itory. Neither primitive nor 
advanced civilizations have 
explored the full possibilities 
of mankind. One thing that 
seems certain, however, is the 
statement in the Declaration 
on Race published by Unesco, 
which affirms that: “the 
range of mental capacities in 
all ethnic groups is much the 
same." 
N WORLD 
of science and industry. Again 
it becomes the responsibility of 
the social sciences fo bear in 
mind the human factor in {he 
transition from one type of 
economy {fo another. Material 
development must harmonise 
with the cullural and social 
changes which will inevitably 
result. Unesco will play a 
useful role if it helps prevent 
a too sudden dislocation of 
cultures, with its aftermath of 
suffering and squandering of 
energy and goodwill, 
It can he foreseen that, in 
a few years, new states will 
he added to the already large 
family of existing ones. These 
states will have {o prepare, 
with as little delay as possible, 
a complex system of institu- 
tions, without which they 
cannot survive in the modern 
world. The adoption of enti- 
rely new organizations and 
procedures will provoke inter- 
nal anguish and violent fen- 
sions. Unesco's experience in 
this field will perhaps be 
turned to good account hy 
those states who accept the 
co-operation which will then 
be offered to them.

### 81599: Economic underdevelopment: enemy of man; "technical assistance": a weapon for man

" — Enemy Of Man: 
  
Yet as a definition solely in the 
CONOMISTS were the first to use the phrase ‘“under- 
E developed areas’. 
language of monetary exchange — in dollars, pounds, pesos, 
rupees or gourdes —it is grossly inadequate. A better 
definition would have to include the overtones of graphic 
descriptions of famines, epidemics; of unceasing and un- 
rewarding labour, of the plight of hundreds of millions of 
human beings, prevented by ignorance from finding a way 
out of their misery. Statistics fail to give these overtones of 
tragedy that alone can provide an adequate definition. Yet 
statistics are used here for their graphic simplicity. 
In 1939, a survey was made 
of fifty-three nations on all 
the world’s continents These 
countries were divided into 
three groups; the first was 
of fifteen nations with a per 
capita annual income of more 
than $200; the second, ten 
countries, with a per capita 
annual income of between 
$100 and $200; the third, 
twenty-eight countries, with a 
per capita annual income less 
than $100. The first group 
made up one-fifth of the 
world’s population; the second, 
one-sixth; the third, making 
about two-thirds of the world 
people, was co-terminous with 
the “under-developed areas’. 
The Yawning Gap 
HIS was before a tremend- 
ous war which widened 
the gap between the high- 
est and the lowest. Here are 
some further differences : 
1. Life expectancy at birth 
in the first group was sixty- 
three years. “Under-developed 
areas’ showed, when figures 
were available, an average of 
forty years, in some cases fall- 
ing as low as twenty-seven 
years. 
2. Out of every 100,000 per- 
sons in the first group, sixty- 
four died of tuberculosis 
annually. In the third and 
largest group, the rate was 333. 
3. In the first group, less 
than five per cent of the 
population were unabie to read - 
and write. In the “under- 
developed” countries, the il- 
literacy rate averaged 78 per 
cent. Eighty per cent of the 
world’s literate people lived in 
countries which made up only 
40 per cent of the world’s 
population. 
4. It has been estimated 
that a man needs a diet cont- 
aining 1,800 calorles as a vital 
minimum for life. In the first 
group, the average food supply 
was 3,000 calories; in the last 
it was 2,150 calories, a slim 
margin against poor harvests 
or insect plagues. 
H unger And Ignorance 
HE shortage of doctors and 
teachers was greatest in 
the regions where they 
were most needed. In the 
relatively healthy countries of 
‘the first group, there was 
more than one physician for 
every 1,000 persons. In the 
last group, there was only one 
for every 6,000. The countries 
with less than five per cent of 
illiteracy had almost four 
elementary schoolteachers for 
every 1.000 persons. Those 
where illiteracy was as high 
as 90 per cent had less than 
two elementary schoolteachers 
for every 1,000 persons — less 
than half, 
In food production, the story 
was similar. The hungriest 
peoples, partly through lack of 
technical knowledge produced 
the least food. In the first 
group of countries, wheat 
fields were as high as forty 
bushels per acre in the period, 
1935-39; in the third group, 
the figure fell as low as eleven 
bushels. Properly cultivated, 
an acre of rice land was made 
to yield — as a national aver- 
age — seventy-six bushels, but 
in countries where rice was 
the staple diet, production fell 
as low as twenty-six bushels. 
Human Realities 
ECHANICAL energy 
M — the greatest liberator 
of man from drudgery — 
was developed in few countries 
and was pitifully absent in 
precisely the regions where it 
was most needed. In the first 
group, the average person had 
26.6 horse-power hours a day 
at his command; in the last, 
he had 1.2. 
These facts and figures — 
horsepower hours, teachers per 
1,000 persons, bushels per 
acre, life expectancy — con- 
tribute to a definition of 
under-development. But the 
human realities are more 
eloquent. A phrase like “life- 
expectancy” has echoes of 
tragedy in a nation which, 
while {rying to increase its 
standard of living, finds that 
disease carries off its popula-

young nation building for the 
future. “Horsepower hours”

\X/ When a child reaches school age, he is taken to the

These simple sentences are statements of fact, however. 
only if an individual or a community has the money to pay 
for the services, and if the persons with the right qualifications 
to perform them can be found. For a whole country, the money 
needed may amount to millions of dollars or pounds. The 
persons with the proper training and education may be 
thousands of niles away. A rich country can get what and 
who if needs, if not at home then abroad. But where can a 
poor country find an expert on the newest technique in 
insecticides or a man qualified to run a soil research laboratory? 
And how will he be paid? 
One important form of mu- 
tual technical assistance among 
nations has already Deen 
successfully in operation either 
on a regional or on a bhi- 
lateral basis, through public 
and private agencies, and 
increasingly through the United 
Nations and a number of the 
Specialized Agencies, 
In December, 1948, the 
United Nations General As- 
sembly voted the modest sum 
of $288,000 for technical 
assistance, mainly through 
fellowships and expert advice. 
In March of the following year, 
the UN Economic and Social 
Council instructed the Secre- 
tary-General to work out an 
expanded programme of tech- 
nical assistance. 
Four Basic Conditions 
HE next step in the de- 
T velopment of technical 
assistance as a major 
objective of the UN was a 
report drawn up for the Counci! 
by representatives of the UN's 
Specialized Agencies. They 
outlined an international 
scheme for technical aid in - 
agriculture, transport, industry, 
labour, education, - finance, 
health and welfare. And to 
carry out the new programme, 
the Council formulated a set of 
operational conditions. These 
points were emphasized : 
1. 1t would be a joint, co- 
operation programme for as- 
sistance in economic develop- 
ment, given only on the 
request of the country concern= 
ed ; 
2. The assistance would be 
designed to increase productiv- 
ity in fields where benefits 
could be distributed to the 
entire population ; 
3. The government 
assistance would assume pari 
of the costs ; (in practice as 
high as 80 per cent) ; 
4. The assistance would not be a 
means of foreign political or 
economic interference with the 
domestic affairs of the country 
receiving It. 
'fhe Council also created the 
framework of the administra- 
tive structure of the pro- 
 
ON MARCH 4, 1949, THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL 
COUNCIL OF THE UNITED NATIONS adopted a 
resolution requesting “...the Secretary-General in con-

agencies... to prepare a report setting forth: 1. A compre- 
hensive plan for an expanded co-operative programme

General, has described as “what should become and 
can become one of the world’s greatest achievements 
for lasting peace and for the social progress and better

gramme, in a manner designed 
to avoid duplication and wasted 
effort. It decided that the UN 
would itself take care of 
requests which did not fall 
within the specific provinces of 
its Specialized Agencies, such 
as industrial development and 
transport. And it proposed 
the formation of a Technical 
Assistance Board, made up of 
representatives of the UN's 
agencies, to co-ordinate the 
programme. 
The Council's proposals were 
submitted to the fourth session 
of the UN General Assembly. 
They were unanimously ap- 
proved on November 16, 1949. 
Spirit Of Generosity 
T HE next step was to finance 
the programme. ‘The 
Assembly asked contribu- 
tions from. the UN Member 
States and they were given 
generously at the United 
Nations echnical Assistance 
Conference held at Lake 
Success in June, 1930. Fifty 
nations not only reached the 
conference's goal of $20,000,000, 
but exceeded it by another 
$12,500. 
The had conference the 
atmosphere of an international 
© competition in generosity. This 
started when the United 
States pledged $10,000,000 if 
other contributions totalled 
$7,000,000. Then the American 
delegate offered to raise the 
United States’ share to 
$12,500,000 provided that it 
amount, at that sum, to not 
more than 60 per cent of the 
total reached. 
The responses of other dele- 
gales matched the American 
spirit. 
The delegate from Venezuela 
— My Government is prepared 
lo raise its contribution to a 
total of $44,000, an increase of 
$4,000 over the amount pre- 
viously pledged. 
The delegate of the United 
Kingdom — We regard it as 
umportant that that figure 
($20,000,000) be reached. We 
propose to increase the United 
Kingdom contribution to 
$760,000, that is, an additional 
$28,000, 
The delegate of the Nether- 
lands — Two days ago our 
delegation pledged 1,500,000 
Dutch guilders. Now we find 
that it is only $396,000. We 
should like to raise this $4,000 
to make the $400,000 round

THAT ALL MAY LEARN is a film made under supervision of the United Nations Film Board, to show 
the world-wide efforts of Unesco in the fight against illiteracy. 
film demonstrates the down-to-earth values of being able to read and write. 
Set in a small Mexican community, the 
Here, peasants are being 
told by an educated member of their community what they must do to reclaim land that belongs to them. 
Bare literacy is not the end and may not even be the beginning of education, yet the printed word is a potent 
means of conveying ideas. The mind of the illiterate is often closed to ideas which are essential to eco- 
nomic and political development. 
EFORE the end of next year, 250 Libyans—some of them now illiterate— 
will have learned enough about Arabic typing and shorthand so that 
their country, now a United Nations trusteeship, will have clerks to man 
government offices when it gains its independence in 1952. 
During the same period, an engineer will have surveyed the length 
and the breadth of the major rivers of Ecuador to determine the best sites for 
future dams to tap their hydro-electric resources. 
And, also by the end of 1951, farmers in Ceylon will be learning how to 
read and, at the same time, how to produce more food from the same amount 
of soil, thus preparing themselves to be shock troops in their country’s peaceful 
campaign to recapture three fourths of its land area from the jungle. 
These examples from three 
continents are culled from a new 
“programme of the United Nations 
Educational, Scientific and Cultural 
Organization. They represent the 
    
set in motion ? The administrative 
machinery set up by the United 
Nations for its programme is extra- 
ordinary in its simplicity. 
Basically, the process of asking inter- 
national aid for economic development is 
no more complicated than that of writ- 
ing a letter. In this case, the letter out- 
lining what is wanted is written by a 
government and sent to Unesco or one of 
the United Nations agencies. 
in every case, the letter is turned over 
to the United Nations Technical Assist- 
ance Board, which is charged with the 
responsibility of finding exactly the right 
Agency—or Agencies—to deal with it. 
Te cope with the question of priority, 
the Board and the Agencies have before 
them six basic standards by which to 
measure the importance of any request. 
These are: 
1. The relation of a project to economic 
development or to the betterment of 
social conditions essential to economic 
development; 
2. The increase in productivity which the 
project would bring about; 
3. The extent to which the requesting 
a nation can help in the execution of the 
ol project; 
4. The financial ability of the requesting 
government to continue the work begun 
by the UN after the assistance has 
ended; 
8. The possibilities of applying the bene- 
fits of the project to other countries in 
the same region; 
6. The urgency of the aid requested; 
7. The equitable distribution of aid to the 
different regions of the world. 
The responsibilities of requesting gov- 
ernments are mainly financial. They 
include the payment of subsistence allow-

ance to cover the living expenses of 
experts; the payment of such costs as 
transportation and medical expenses; the

‘in the cost of fellowships and scholarships 
offered as part of the aid programme. 
UNESCO FIELDS OF ACTION 
HE formulation of requests by govern- 
ments is not a difficult procedure. 
Unesco and the other Specialized 
Agencies have made clear just what they 
are prepared to do to aid the economic 
development of a country. Unesco’s fa- 
cilities for technical assistance, which is 
usually provided in co-operation with the 
other UN agencies, can be summarized 
under the following headings: 
1. ELEMENTARY EDUCATION. The 
Organization is prepared to help in 
| PRIORITIES, W, 
realisation of part of a world scheme 
of “technical assistance for economic 
development”, now being carried out 
by the United Nations and its agen- 
cies, nations and organizations. 
educational administration and finance, 
curricula and teaching methods, text- 
books, school buildings and equipment, 
the planning of compulsory education 
programmes and the adaptation of 
educational systems to meet changing 
community needs. 
2. FUNDAMENTAL AND ADULT 
EDUCATION. To raise the standard of 
living of the people through education, 
Unesco offers aid in literacy campaigns, 
education in health and agriculture, the 
development of co-operatives, and the 
encouragement of small industries and 
handicrafts. 
3. TECHNICAL EDUCATION. Unesco 
has interpreted this term to mean 
education and training for industries, 
trades, agriculture and commerce from 
the primary school to the university level. 
Aid is available in the organization and 
financing of such schools, and on 
problems relating to their buildings and 
equipment, textbooks, the selection of 
staffs, and the co-ordination of their 
programmes with the country’s overall 
economic development. 
4. BASIC AND APPLIED SCIENCES. 
This extremely important phase of 
Unesco’s technical assistance covers both 
teaching and research in the Natural 
Sciences. Physicists, chemists, mathema- 
ticians, biologists... all are essential to eco- 
nomic development. 
5. SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION. This 
field is a broad one, covering various 
forms of documentation needed for scien- 
tific and technical education for carrying 
out research and for developing industry. 
SERVICES UNESCO OFFERS 
HESE are the fields in which Unesco 
is prepared to offer aid. Govern- 
ments requiring assistance in one or 
several of these fields, normally indicate 
the form of aid they feel will be most 
effective. Here again, Unesco has drawn 
up a simplified list of the methods avail- 
able to governments seeking technical 
aid. They are divided into four main 
types of services, as follows: 
EXPLORATORY MISSIONS. These 
are teams of specialists intended mainly 
to aid countries on fact-finding projects 
in education and the natural and social 
sciences. The exploratory mission is 
usually of short-term duration and, under 
normal conditions, completes its work 
within six months. 
ADVISORY SERVICES. This form of 
aid is intended for countries which have 
already carried out their own exploratory 
missions and gathered the preliminary 


### 81602: UNESCO's share in United Nations Technical Assistance Programme

UNESCO’S SHARE 1D 
TECHNICAL ASSIST 
The meaning of “Technical Assis- 
tance” and the desperate, almost 
world-wide, needs it is designed to 
serve are dealt with on Page 5 of this 
issue of the COURIER. 
Of the total funds, $ 20,012,500, 
pledged by fifty countries for the 
whole programme of the United 
Nations and its Specialized Agencies, 
Unesco has been allocated 14 %, 
$ 2,300,000, for its share in the work. 
TWELVE REQUESTS ANSWERED 
N the case of Unesco, as well as 
that of the other United Nations 
Agencies, there was no shortage of 
requests to put the money to work. 
In July of 1950, the Technical Assis- 
tance Board reported that it had 
received requests from fifty-seven 
countries. Unesco, at present, has 
requests from nearly two dozen coun- 
tries on hand, and it has already taken 
action on twelve of them. 
These twelve countries, are Ceylon, 
Ecuador, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Le- 
banon, Liberia, Libya, Mexico, Pakis- 
tan, Persia and Thailand. In their 
requests, they produced twelve diffe- 
rent intepretations of “Technical As- 
sistance for Economic Development” 
that is, interpreting it to fit their 
own immediate needs. 
These varied interpretations are 
completely in line with the United 
Nation’s conception of technical aid. 
This programme has no intention of 
setting up a production line from 
which would stream prefabricated 
economies and, even worse, stan- 
dardised societies and cultures, The 
new economies will be fitted into the 
needs of the countries — not vice 
versa. 
data needed for a proposed project. In 
this case, a government may request an 
advisory mission to guide it in projects 
in education, basic and applied sciences 
and the use of the radio and visual 
material for educational purposes. 
Unesco’s experience in operating re- 
gional scientific offices around the world 
suggested a longer-term type of advisory 
service—the Advisory Science Office. If 
requested by a country, such offices will 
be set up to supply scientific and technical 
information. 
TRAINING. Unesco is prepared to 
help in the training of teachers, scientists 
and other needed personnel by facilitating 
study abroad through fellowships or by 
assisting in the establishment of training 
centres within a country. Unesco is also 
prepared to call study groups for short 
intensive studies of problems arising in 
technical assistance, and may help set up 
demonstration projects to show people by 
example just what the use of new 
educational and scientific techniques can 
do for a region. Unesco is also equipped 
to aid governments in setting up centres 
for producing educational films and radio 
programmes. 
RESEARCH TEAMS AND INFORM- 
ATION SERVICES. The research team, 
as defined by Unesco, consists of a group 
of scientists who will aid a country in 
ressarch on technical or scientific prob- 
lems standing in the way of economic 
development. One of the main inform- 
ation services offered is the biblio- 
graphical centre, including a library 
designed to collect, classify and digest for 
ready use, scientific documentation on 
problems of technical assistance. The 
information series will also include a 
photographic reproduction office to handle 
microfilmed documents. The biblio- 
graphical centre will make ifs services 
available to United Nations Agencies 
working on technical assistance problems 
and to scientists and industrialists in the 
entire region. The information services 
available through Unesco also cover public 
information teams; that is, press and 
radio specialists to aid countries in telling 
the largest possible number of people the 
alms of specific technical assistance pro- 
jects. : 
The above categories of technical assist- 
ance teams and facilities are available to 
under-developed countries for 1950-51. 
But here again, Unesco’s view of tech- 
nical assistance is an elastic one. This 
“prospectus” does not necessarily mean 
that the Organization’s activities will be 
limited to such services. If the needs of 
countries call for other techniques, the 
way is not barred to their use. In a sense, 
it will be the countries receiving aid who 
will help determine what Unesco’s future 
technical assistance programmes will be. 
This principle explains the em- 
phasis which the United Nations and, 
in particular, Unesco have placed on 
the educational side of technical as- 
sistance. If a nation does not have 
an adequate number of trained scien- 
tists and educators to pick up the 
work begun by specialists from 
abroad, technical assistance will 
merely die of inertia. 
It also should be remembered that 
$ 20,000,000 is all that the United 
Nations has available at the present 
moment for the needs of the entire 
world. With that sum there will be 
no deserts blooming overnight, or mud 
huts mushrooming up into skyscra- 
pers. Therefore, Unesco has decided 
that the amount of money it has on 
hand will give a greater return if it 
is invested in men instead of in 
drawing up grandiose paper projects. 
Unesco cannot build dams, but it can 
train engineers and teachers of engi- 
neering. When the money for the 
dams is available, the men — native, 
not foreign — will be there to build 
them, 
TECHNICAL AID PHILOSOPHY 
HIS might be called the philosophy 
of technical assistance as conceiv- 
ed by Unesco and the United 
Nations, Here, in twelve coun- 
tries, is how it is being transformed 
from a philosophy into a programme 
of action. Space does not permit 
detailed treatment for each of these 
twelve countries. The single case 
history of Libya, described in a sepa- 
rate story on this page, will serve to 
illustrate many of the principles and 
methods to be used by Unesco in its 
part of the work of technical assis- 
tance. 
CEYLON. This country, on its own 
initiative, launched a large-scale pro- 
gramme to reclaim its so-called “Dry 
Zone”, which makes up 75 per cent 
of its land area. Unesco is aiding 
this programme with a fundamental 
education centre, emphasizing, literacy 
training and better farming methods. 
Ceylon also will have the services of 
two geologists to make an inventory 
of its mineral resources. 
ECUADOR. Here, a four-man team 
of scientists and educators will be sent 
into the field. One member of the 
team, a chemical engineer, will assist 
in setting up a chemical engineering 
institute to put added research faci- 
lities at the disposal of Ecuadorian 
industry. The second will work with 
Ecuadorian educators on improving

the organization and the curricula of 
the country’s universities; the third 
‘will assist the country in its literacy 
campaign, and the fourth will be the 
electrical engineer previously men- 
tioned. In this joint mission, the ILO 
will send three advisers on industrial 
education and handicrafts. 
INDIA. At a cost of $229,200, 
Unesco is helping India in its na- 
tional programme of improving faci- 
lities for scientific research and train- 
ing. As one phase, Unesco is sending 
seven experts in such fields as plas- 
tics, dam design, electrical engineer- 
ing and low temperature physics. 
The second part of the programme 
will see Unesco help India to set up 
- a bibliographical centre for scientists 
working in India, in technical assis- 
tance programmes in the region and 
in ali of South-east Asia. At present, 
India has a tremendous number of 
scientific documents on its hands 
with no adequate facilities for putting 
them into a condition where they can 
be readily used. 
INDONESIA. Unesco will help In- 
donesia set into motion a training 
programme for teachers in resettle- 
ment areas, as well as to establish 
an adequate primary school system (at 
present only 25 per cent of the coun- 
try’s school-age children are in class- 
rooms). 
IRAQ. The University of Baghdad, 
building up its science department, is 
suffering from a shortage of teachers. 
In response to the government's 
request, Unesco is sending out a biolo- 
- gist, a mathematician and an indus- 
trial chemist to become temporary 
members of the faculty and, from a 
long-term viewpoint, is providing 
‘fellowships to enable Iraqui science 
teachers to study abroad, 
LEBANON. Here Unesco, during 
+ 1950-1951, will make a study of the 
country’s technical assistance needs, 
especially in the field of scientific and 
- educational research, 
LIBERIA. This African country 
presents a strange picture of economic 
development far outstripping what 
‘might be called human development. 
To enable Liberians to reap the full 
henefits of the tremendous changes 
being made in their country’s econ- 
omy, Unesco is helping their govern- 
ment with a broad educational pro- 
gramme. This scheme will concen- 
trate on the expansion of facilities at 
Liberia College, the country’s only 
higher educational institution and, at 
the same time, will work out methods 
of raising educational standards 
throughout the country— not an easy 
task since Liberia's population of 
1,500,000 is divided into nearly twenty 
language groups. 
LIBYA. By January 1, 1952, this 
country will become independent, but 
it is desperately short of civil servants. 
Unesco is helping in the operation of 
what can only be called a clerical and 
typing school and, in addition, is sup- 
plying funds to ‘enable prospective 
holders of higher governmental posi- 
tions to study abroad. (For addition- 
al details of the programme in Libya, 
see separate story on this page). 
MEXICO. Here Unesco, in coopera- 
tion again with the ILO is planning 
to assist Mexican industrial training 
schools. At the same time, a biblio- 
graphical centre very much like the 
one planned for India will be set up 
to serve countries throughout Latin- 
America. 
PAKISTAN. Two missions are 
to be sent to this country. The first, 
a team of four scientists specialised in 
seismology, atmosphere ahd magnet- 
ism research, will help set up the 
irst institute of geophysics in Asia. 
Once it is in operation, its initial task 
will be to survey Pakistan’s vast desert 
area to assess the possibilities of 
salvaging land, through irrigation, for 
food production. The second mission 
will seek to develop radio broadcasting 
and receiving facilities in Pakistan in 
order to make them effective media 
for adult education. - 
PERSIA. A scientist sent out by 
Unesco will advise the Persian Go- 
vernment on its seven-year economic 
development programme and will help 
determine where Unesco’s technical 
aid facilities can fit into this pro- 
gramme. 
THAILAND. A team of educators 
specialised in primary school training, 
vocational education, and the teach- 
ing of science and the English lang- 
uage, is going out to Thailand to 
help cope with a shortage of 20,000 
teachers in a country where only one- 
third of the 70,000 available teachers 
have had adequate training. 
In all of these countries, every 
foreign specialist will have his count- 
erpart studying abroad on a fellow- 
ship to replace him at the end of his 
mission. In most cases, too, the accent 
has been placed on training teachers 
rather than students. Unesco does 
not want to become an international 
faculty : rather, it wants to give 
educators in individual countries the 
initial impetus they need to get their 
own systems under way.

TECHNICAL AID IS NOT A NEW IDEA. Unesco and other United Nations Specialized Agencies have 
been straining their limited resources for several years to carry out their own “technical aid” programmes. 
Unesco has given aid in education, science, mass communication, and in various cultural fields. To pre- 
pare audio-visual materials for fundamental education, for example, Unesco set up an experimental centre 
in China. Filmstrips, posters and pamphlets dealing with health precautions were tested in local villages. 
This photo shows members of a Unesco team preparing for a film show. The materials and lessons 
learned from the experiment will be available to educators all over the world. 
  
N March 1950, 
United Nations Commissioner in 
Libya, sent a letter to Unesco 
asking for help. Mr. Pelt’'s assign- 
ment in the former Italian colony was 
to put into effect the resolution of the 
United Nations General Assembly pro- 
viding for the establishment not later 
than January 1, 1952, of a constitutional 
government in a free, united Libya. 
The area involved was under three 
different administrations : Tripolitania, 
administered by the British, with a 
population of 800,000; Cyrenaica, with 
a semi-independent government advised 
by a British Resident, and a population 
of 200,000; and Fezzan, with a popula- 
tion of 40,000 under French administra- 
tion. Mr, Pelt needed help in training 
a corps of Libyan minor civil servants 
who would be prepared to carry out 
their tasks as soon as the new govern- 
ment began functioning. 
Mr. Pelt’s first requirement was for 
helpers well below the level of minis- 
terial rank. He merely wanted persons 
who could help him provide the new 
nation of Libya with enough file clerks, 
stenographers and typists to carry on 
the normal business of government. 
Unesco responded at once to the 
appeal, sending to Libya a representa- 
tive equipped to make for Mr. Pelt an 
expert survey of the situation. The 
Unesco expert reported that Libya had

duate since 1939. Before 1939, the 
general level of education had been very 
low because of economic backwardness. 
It was only in 1947 that secondary 
schools were opened again in Tripolita- 
nia and Cyrenaica. No students would 
therefore graduate until 1951. 
FIRST TASK LITERACY 
T= task of training Arabic typists 
and stenographers seemed relati- 
vely simple until it was discovered that 
the available personnel was illiterate 
and would, first, have to be taught to 
read and write. 
The Unesco report also showed that 
the prospective nation’s deficiencies in 
competent government personnel were 
equally great in the higher brackets. 
To remedy this lack, it was suggested 
that fellowships and scholarships for 
study in foreign countries as well as in 
Libya be provided. These were pro- 
posed to cover courses in local govern- 
ment methods, forestry, customs admi- 
nistration, police work and accountancy. 
It was also suggested that seven Libyans 
with teacher training be offered an 
opportunity to make further studies in 
England, for three or four months. The 
shortage of teachers in Libya was so 
grave that they could not be spared 
for a longer period. 
Acting on the basis of the report, and 
on requests received from the adminis- 
trations of the three areas which will 
form United Libya, Unesco decided to 
help in three ways: first, by esta- 
blishing a clerical training centre; 
second, by providing scholarships to 
enable prospective holders of higher 
governmental positions to prepare 
themselves for these new duties through 
study; and third, by providing scholar- 
ships in education to ten men and 
women from the Fezzan. 
TRAINING CENTRE OPENED 
HE total cost of this project is 
$ 57,500. In common with all the 
other technical assistance projects un- 
dertaken by Unesco, the sum is to come 
from resources outside the Organiz- 
ation’s normal budget. The clerical 
training school will cost Unesco $ 32,000 
to operate during the year 1950-51, a 
figure which includes the salaries of a 
principal and thirteen teachers. Unesco 
and the United Kingdom will share the 
other costs of operating the centre. 
These include subsistence allowances for 
pupils, the purchase of thirty-one Ara- 
bic and thirty-one English typewriters 
and the repair of the school building. 
The training centre is already operat- 
ing in Libya. Literacy training plays 
as important a part in its curriculum as 
the proper techniques of” writing a bus- 
iness letter. : 
The case of Libya is an example of 
the kind of technical assistance which 
Unesco can offer, for it represents the 
maximum utilization of a small amount 
of funds to accomplish a definite pur- 
pose within a given time. :

### 81603: Science and technology to help under-developed lands

SGIENGE AND TEGHNOLOGY TO HELP UNDER-DEVELOPED LANDS 
  
ODEKN society is the result of man’s 
IM Cinereacing but still incomplete 
"conquest of nature. Technology 
and engineering are powerful weapons 
in effecting this conquest. Historically, 
there are good reasons for the advanced 
technological society of the West. 
Today, however, as the Dutch historian 
R. J. Forbes has written : “We live in 
a stage of human history in which the 
answers to the common problems that 
occupy men’s attention at every point of 
the globe are no longer limited to certain 
areas and artificial lines on a map. The 
new science has established an interna- 
tional brotherhood of scientific thought”. 
It is this recognition which accounts 
for the key role played by science in 
all programmes for technical assistance. 
As the Indian monthly journal, Science 
and Culture, has said (speaking for all 
under-developed territories) : “We are 
convinced that the only way to achieve 
economic independence and regeneration 
‘would be through intensive application 
of science and technology to all pro- 
ductive endeavours”. 
The Republic of India is indeed 
moving into action along these lines. 
Prime Minister Nehru has declared : 
“I believe that all problems, both world 
problems and national, should have a 
scientific approach”. India herself has 
a great scientific tradition. In recent 
  by 
Maurice GOLDSMITH 
    
vears, great Indian physicists like Sir 
C. V. Raman and Professor H. Bhabha, 
and chemists such as Sir Shanti Swarup 
Bhatnagar, have made unique contri- 
butions to world science, 
To Narrow A Gap 
HERE is much to do in India, a 
country with a population of over 
300,000,000, and natural population 
increase larger than any nation in 
Europe (with the exception of Russia). 
Taking the amount of energy available 
per head of population as an index of 
the level of technical civilization, India 
uses yearly the equivalent of less than 
one-fifth of a ton of coal per head as 
compared with the USA’s 9 tons and 
Britain’s 4, The technical assistance 
programme is designed to help narrow 
this whose ill- 
nourished millions demand the material 
means for better lives. 
Unesco will make available to India 
$229,000, a large share of its technical 
assistance budget for the first year. 
Specialists will be engaged by Unesco 
to assist India in several aspects of her 
gap for countries

Then, almost at the turn of the century, 
the discovery of radioactivity, of X-rays 
and of electrons shook the world of 
science. The era of Modern Physics 
was born. 
Not long thereafter came the first hint 
that something about our understanding 
of the physical world was not quite in 
order. The trouble was precipitated by 
a study of the radiation of light from a 
glowing solid object, such as a hot coal. 
Classical physics, eminently successful 
in accounling for the minute details of 
fight in all its other manifestations, was 
apparently powerless lo explain the 
observed distribution of brightness in 
the light coming from an incandescent 
lump of solid matter.

physicist Max Planck in De-

was based on 
assumplions so novel and so utterly 
different from previous concepts that 
the first reaction of the world of 
science was one of outraged scorn. 
For, in order to make theory match 
observation, Planck was forced to 
assume that the radiation of light is a 
discontinuous, intermittent process—not 
at all comparable to the smooth, steady 
flow of walter from a tap, but more like 
the discharge of bullets from a ma- 
chine gun, : 
The individual “bullets” of course 
must be exceedingly small to give the 
appearance of steady illumination ordi- 
narily observed. 
that an average bullet—or gquantum— 
of visible light carried only about one 
millionth of the energy expended by a 
mosquito in climbing a distance equal 
lo ils own length. 
If this novel idca of “energy done 
up in packets” had succeeded only in 
explaining the single phenomenon of 
radiation from a healed solid it might 
have remained a mere scientific curio- 
sity, provisionally tolerated only until 
the “true” cxplanation should turn up. 
Buf this was not to be the case. 
When, presently, the Danish physicist 
Neils Bolir began to look for an explan- 
ation of the radiation from individual 
aloms and molecules of matter, lie 
found that Planck's quantum idea gov-~ 
erned this field also. Moreover, it did 
so with a precision equalling that with 
which Newton's gravitation described 
‘the wheeling of the planets in space.

Since 1800, physical theory and the practice of fire fighting have apparently developed along 
contradictory lines. Only « half century ago. it was assumed that all energy “flowed”

### 74461: UNESCO asks five nations to aid in high altitude research work

Unesco Asks Five 
Nations To Aid In 
High Altitude 
Research Work 
HE process of acclimatization of 
man living at sea level to the 
atmospheric conditions of high 
altitudes is still insufficiently known. 
Continued research work is needed to 
solve this problem—and is also impor- 
tant for gaining a better comprehension 
of the respiratory function of the blood. 
Research dealing with the physiology 
of men living on the high plateaux of 
Peru, by scientists from the National 
institute of Andean Biology, of San 
Marcos University, Lima, Peru, was 
recently recognized by the Joint Com- 
mission on High Altitude Research 
Stations, which urged that it should 
be extended to other Latin American 
countries. 
Undertaken by Professor Carlos 
Monge and other members of the 
Peruvian institute, it showed the neces- 
sity to establish norms. in medical. 
practice—of blood counts, chest mea- 
surements, etc.—for people living at 
high altitudes. The Peruvian scientists 
accumulated a large number of norms 
which are necessary for medical prac- 
tice on high plateaux. 
fn its resolution, the Joint Commis- 
sion on High Altitude Research Stations 
requested Unesco to draw the atten- 
tion of medical and university autho- 
rities in Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, 
Mexico and Venezuela, where there 
are people living at high elevations, to 
the opportunity they have to co-operate 
in this field. It also suggested that 
these countries form a Joint Committee 
to initiate and co-ordinate this type of 
research in their territories. 
Unesco has now officially informed 
the governments of these five countries 
of the suggestions.

N international agreement which will allow a wide range 
of educational, scientific and cultural materials to move 
across frontiers free of duty will be opened for signature 
on the 22nd of November. at United Nations headquarters, Lake 
Success, New York. The text of the Agreement was adopted 
unanimously at the last General Conference of Unesco. at 
Florence. 
All Member States of Unesco and of the United Nations may 
adhere to the “Agreement on the Importation of Educational. 
Scientific and Cultural Materials,” as the new pact is called. 
It will come into force following ratification by ten countries. 
Sponsoring the Agreement, the Unesco General Conference 
urged Member States to sign and ratify it and to implement 
its provisions in the most liberal manner. The United Nations 
Economic and Social Council has also drawn the attention of 
Member States to the “practieal importance” of the agreement. 
the Second World War, 
a large oblong crate 
turned up at the Customs 
warehouse of a busy port. 
The Customs inspector, upon 
opening the crate, discovered 
that its contents consisted of a 
smooth and graceful piece of 
solid brass, shaped rather like 
a banana standing on its end. 
The inspector was completely 
at a loss as to how he should 
classify the object. Finally, he 
arrived at a decision: the 
object was “block matter” — 
and duty was charged accord- 
ing to the relatively high rate 
for imported raw material. 
But the importer challenged 
the inspector's decision. The 
“raw material” turned out to 
be the abstract sculpture “Bird 
in Flight” by the noted Ru- 
manian sculptor, Brancusi, 
and, in the opinion of art 
critics, one of his finest works. 
After much delay and ar- 
gument, the inspector's ruling 
was reversed by the courts and 
the piece of sculpture was 
allowed to enter duty-free. 
The inspector’s view that the 
Brancusi was just a piece of 
brass, is not as extraordinary 
as it might seem. It is reflect- 
ed in the tariff regulations of 
many countries which tend to 
regard not only works of art 
but other educational, scientific 
and cultural materials as or- 
dinary commodities, subject to 
the same restrictions which 
are imposed on commercial 
imports. 
This tendency has for 
many years seriously hinder- 
ed the international circula- 
tion of educational, scientific 
and cultural materials. Some 
O NE day, some years before

Austria-Hungary, Germany, 
Japan and many smaller 
countries had followed the 
French lead. Italy, Russia,

languages to enter freely but 
imposed a duty on imported 
books printed in the native 
language.

WARS RAISE BARRIERS 
HE outbreak of war in 1914 
brought this comparatively 
happy period to a close. 
During World War I itself, 
tariffs rose generally and new 
restrictive measures were de- 
vised to meet the emergency. 
Of these, the most notable was 
the licensing system, which 
enabled governments to exer- 
cise an unprecedented degree 
of control over foreign trade. 
Since the aim was to restrict 
trade in goods considered non- 
essential to the war effort, 
many articles of educational 
value suffered. 
By the end of World War I, 
the whole structure of pre-war 
trade had been shattered. The 
economic depression of the 
1930’s led to a host of restric- 
tions more rigid and extensive 
than those adopted after 1914. 
The division of the world into 
currency blocs and the intro- 
duction of quota systems plac- 
ed an even greater check on 
world trade. Informational 
materials suffered particularly, 
though films enjoyed some re- 
lief under the “Convention to 
Facilitate the International 
Circulation of Films of an

HE vast devastation caused 
by the recent war and the 
external indebtedness of 
many countries struck a final 
blow at the multilateral trading 
system. Informational mate- 
rials, which had never been 
more greatly needed, suffered 
as much, or more, than other 
commodities, since internatio- 
nal trade was still largely 
confined to the exchange of 
“essential goods” and nearly 
all countries were faced by 
extremely complex payments 
difficulties. 
Despite the growth of 
restrictions generally, many 
countries were 
disposed to pro- 
vide special fa- 
cilities for trade 
in instruments 
of knowledge. It 
was necessary, 
however, for an 
inter - govern- 
mental agency 
to draw atten- 
tion to the pro- 
blem as a whole, 
to stimul- 
ate governmenis 
into concrete 
action and 
provide a frame- 
work within 
which remedial 
might be effected. 
Unesco’s first undertaking 
was to sponsor a new agree- 
ment to replace the League of 
Nations Convention on educa- 
tional films, already mention- 
ed, which had lapsed during 
the war. The draft of a con- 
vention, broadened to include 
many other audio-visual ma- 
terials, was approved by the 
Unesco General Conference 1n 
November, 1948. Known as the 
“Agreement to Facilitate the

SCIENTIFIC AND CULTURAL MATERIALS 
  
  
ATIONS adhering 10 the Unesco-sponsored 
Agreement on the Importation of Educational,

duty-free entry, under prescribed conditions, to a 
wide range of commodities. These are grouped in 
five categories:

The duty-free entry of visual, auditory and sclen- 
tific materials, objects of art, scientific collections,

nals for public exhibitions will be granted import 
Hcences and relieved of duties and other charges. 
Contracting States will, furthermore, grant licences

will also undertake to simplify administrative pro- 
cedures governing the importation of educational,

for schools or art galleries, 
languish in customs ware- 
houses while their sponsors try 
to raise the heavy bond often 
required by the authorities. 
HISTORY OF RESTRICTIONS 
OST of the tariff, quota 
M and currency restric- 
tions on the movement 
of informational materials 
are of fairly recent origin. In 
many cases, moreover, they 
have been extended to instru- 
ments of knowledge as part of 
a general trend toward control 
which engulfed these materials, 
along with other “commodi- 
ties”, fortuitously rather than 
by design. 
During the earlier part of 
the period between 1850 and 
today, informational materials 
benefited by the general mo- 
vement in favour of 
free trade. The Indu- 
strial Revolution and 
the absence of major 
wars led to a general 
demand for tariff re- 
form, which in Europe 
led to the conclusion 
of a number of cormn- 
mercial treaties inspir- 
ed by liberal princi- 
ples. Thus, in 1860, 
the United Kingdom 
concluded with France 
a commercial treaty 
providing for free 
~ trade in books.

When the Unesco General 
Conference met at Beirut 
in November, 1948, it instruct- 
ed the Director-General to 
prepare the draft of a second 
international agreement, de- 
signed to facilitate the inter- 
national circulation of public- 
ations. A draft was drawn up 
and the Director-General tock 
the opportunity to submit it 
for consideration by the Con- 
tracting Parties to the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade (G.A.T.T.), which met 
at Annecy, France, in April 
1949. Thirty-four nations, in- 
cluding 26 Unesco Member 
  
States, took part in this mee- 
ting. 
The conference set up a 
seven-nation working party, 
under the chairmanship of 
Belgium, to consider the Unes- 
co Agreement. The working 
party concluded that Unesco’s 
general objective to remove 
trade restrictions on instru- 
ments of knowledge would best 
be furthered through a broad 
international agreement to 
facilitate the international cir- 
culation, not only of publica- 
tions, but of a wide variety of 
educational, scientific and cial- 
tural materials. The working 
party then proceeded to draft 
such an agreement and the 
G.AT.T. conference, after 
approving the text, recom- 
mended the convention to 
Unesco for sponsorship. 
RECENT UNESCO ACTION 
HE General Conference of 
Unesco, at its 4th session 
in September, 1949, ins- 
tructed the Director-General 
to circulate this text to Gov- 
ernments and to convene a 
meeting of experts to revise it 
in the light of comment re- 
ceived. Delegates from 25 
Member States met in Geneva 
for two weeks in March 1950 
and reached agreement on a 
revised text. The Agreement 
on the Importation of Educa- 
tional, Scientific and Cultural 
Materials, as it was now called, 
was submitted to the General 
Conference, at its 5th Session 
in Florence, and, with a num- 
ber of further revisions, was 
adopted unanimously. Its 
terms are described in an 
accompanying article. 
The General Conference 
urged Member States to sign 
and ratify it and to implement 
its terms in the most liberal 
manner. In a statement to 
the Conference, the Direcfor- 
General declared that the 
entry into force of the Unesco 
Agreement would represent a 
substantial contribution, in the 
technical field, to mutual un- 
controls. signed by 18 nations and rati- derstanding and peace.

T Union has informed postal administra- 
tions throughout the world of favour- 
able replies which Unesco has received from 
Member States {o its request that they sup- 
port measures for wider circulation of

Unesco asked Member States to support a 
scheme, initiated by ithe Universal Poslal 
Union, which allows readers to pay in their 
national currency, at their local post office, 
for subscriptions fo newspapers and maga- - 
zines published in other countries. Belgium. 
Denmark, the Netherlands. Norway and 
Sweden informed Unesco that they were 
already applying the system in regard to 
certain countries and that they were increas- 
ing the number of countries from which 
their nationals could obtain publications. 
In addition, Italy advised Unesco that it 
would establish the service with all countries 
willing to carry out such exchanges. 
Unesco also asked Member States to carry 
out provisions of the Universal Postal Con- 
vention, by which a 50 per cent reduction is 
allowed in postal rates for newspapers, 
periodicals, books and pamphlets. Iraq 
replied that it was willing to reduce rates 
for publications mailed from ils territory. 
This brings 1o 36 the number of Unesco: 
Member States which have announced their 
agreement to reduce postal rates for printed 
materials.

ESSONS ‘come alive” 
and schoolchildren 
understand and re- 
member them more 
easily when teachers can 
supplement explanations with 
visual impressions of the sub- 
ject being taught. Only a 
few years ago, however, 
teachers were obliged to 
improvise nearly all their own 
visual aids. Many adults can 
certainly still remember their 
teachers using an orange, an 
apple and a lighted candle to 
give a crude, but effective 
demonstration of the rela- 
tionship between the earth, the 
sun and the moon. 
Today, with films, wall 
charts, filmstrips, models and 
special maps supplementing or 
replacing teacher-made devi- 
ces, one of the countries 
giving a valuable lead, espe- 
cially in the field of films, is 
Great Britain, where the 
development of such visual aids 
has been going on for many 
years. 
The belief in the value of 
films as educational aids began 
to grow in Britain about 1920. 
Since then, the interest and 
activity shown by teachers 
associations, education insti- 
tutes and Local Education 
Authorities has encouraged 
film makers to produce mate- 
rial suitable for the school 
curriculum. 
Further development is being 
made possible today through

formed to plan and develop a 
visual aid policy for England 
and Wales, and the Educa- 
tional Foundation for Visual 
Aids (E.F.V.A.) whose work 
includes the provision of infor- 
mation and facilities for edu- 
cational authorities and 
teachers and help, in an advi- 
sory capacity, to sponsors and 
producers of new educational 
films. 
Industry Helps Education 
pucATIONAL film libraries 
have been set up by such 
bodies as the British 
Electrical Development Asso- 
ciation, the Petroleum Film 
Bureau, the British Iron and 
Steel Federation, the Inter- 
national Wool Secretariat and 
the Tea Bureau. The first of 
these groups, for instance, has 
produced over 15 films dealing 
with the basic theories and 
principles of electricity. 
These ten minute films explain 
in simple language the why 
and wherefore of electricity 
and its different applications 
in the home and in the 
factory. They are loaned 
to teachers together with 
detailed notes and question- 
naires which help them to 
make the fullest use of the 
films as visual aids. 
In all, 1,000 prints of 15 
films are in constant circulation 
throughout the country today, 
and in the case of “Generation 
of Electricity” and “Trans- 
mission of Electricity”, 120 
prints of each film have been 
made to meet the needs of 
schools and technical colleges. 
An important contribution 
to the teaching of science and 
engineering has been made by 
the iron and steel industry. 
Films and filmstrips cover the 
obtaining of raw materials and 
the production of iron and 
steel. Area training officers in 
the steel industry use them for 
training apprentices, but they 
are also available to schools 
and technical colleges. 
Wool has always played a 
large part in British national 
life. Accordingly, the industry 
has for years helped develop 
the use of visual aids for the 
teaching of economics, geo- 
graphy, chemistry, biology and 
domestic science. Similarly, 
the tea industry has done a 
great deal to instruct teachers 
in the use of visual aids and to 
provide schools with material 
which will enliven lessons on 
geography, history, transport 
and social customs. In addi- 
tion to films, exhibitions are 
organised; cardboard models 
with sheets of cut-out figures 
made for children to assemble 
in the course of a lesson.

twelve different language

weeks to follow their training 
course in mining. Although 
the lessons were based on the

pupils to repeat—filmstrips

been made to show people in 
other lands as real people,

Hence, there is little generali- 
sation. A filmstrip on Persian 
oil-fields, will take a specific 
Persian worker and tell the 
story of his daily life against 
a background of the oilfields 
and will thus create an under- 
standing of his problems.

value of education is found in 
the efforts made to obtain fe-

English schools. British pro- 
ducers and British teachers are 
looking across the seas for 
available material. 
The day is fast approaching 
when such exchanges will be 
facilitated by the removal of 
customs barriers through two 
international agreements 
sponsored by Unesco. The 
first agreement would relieve 
educational films from licences, 
quotas and tariffs and the 
second (described on page 9 of 
this issue of the Courier) 
would also free the movement 
of films as well as other edu- 
cational materials. 
Such exchanges are expected 
to give an added incentive to 
commercial firms and indus- 
trialists willing to undertake 
the production of films for 
schools, by providing a wider 
market for their productions.

### 81614: Experts plan action to resolve international copyright tangle

EXPERTS PLAN ACTION TO RESOLVE INTERNATIONAL COPYRIGHT TANGLE 
0 NX October 23, a group of international 
cxrperts

met in Washington at the incitalion of 
Uncsco to consider the drafting of a Universal 
Convention on Copyright. The wmecting marked an im- 
portant step in Unecsco’s efforts to protect creative workers 
and to help remove intellectual and cultural barriers 
between peoples. A majority of the 37 countrics which 
“have thus far replied to a Unesco questionnaire are in 
favour of the establishment of a Universal Convention. As 
the cxperts met, they had before them a proposal that

conference to 
some of the problems caused by the maze of legal dif- 
ferences in the field of copyright. 
—any creative worker— 
has two important rights 
in the product of his labour: 
the right to a proper share in 
‘the profits of its sale and the 
right to have its original form 
and meaning preserved. These 
things taken together form 
what is known as “Copyright” 
or “literary and artistic owner- 
ship.” The Universal Declara- 
tion of Human Rights gives it 
special mention in Article 27: 
“Everyone has the right to 
the protection of the moral 
and material interests result- 
ing from any scientific, literary 
or artistic production of which 
‘he is the author.” 
But, in the same afticle, the 
Declaration mentions another 
right no less important: 
“Everyone has the right free- 
T HE writer, the musician ly. to participate in the cul- 
tural life of the community, to 
enjoy the arts and to share in 
scientific advancement and its 
benefits.” In other words, 
literary and artistic works 
must be as easily accessible to 
the public as achievements in 
the scientific field. 
At first sight, these two 
prerogatives may seem to 
conflict: the right of the 
author to protect his work; 
and the right of the public to 
have access to it. One of the 
most serious problems to be 
faced in any definition of 
copyright is the need to main- 
tain a delicate balance bet- 
ween interests equally deserv- 
ing of consideration. Accord- 
ing to the importance which 
legislation places on author’s 
rights or those of the public, 
the definition varies of lite- 
rary and artistic copyright. 
Many other factors play their 
part in the promulgation of 
copyright laws, not the least 
of which are the interests of - 
distributing agencies. 
When Creative Works 
Cross Borders 
ACH country has to 
E contend with internal 
difficulties according to 
its own legislation. But the 
problems of copyright go 
beyond national frontiers: 
books are translated, pictures - 
reproduced, plays adapted and 
performed outside the country 
where they originated. As 
soon as we examine copyright 
from the point of view of its 
international application, the 
problem becomes even. more 
complex. For instance, how 
can a French musician exer- 
cise his rights when one of his 
symphonies is performed in 
another country? Clearly, due 
consideration for the artist’s 
rights must be safeguarded in 
foreign countries as well as in 
his own. If not, what would 
happen? : 
The creative work, lacking 
adequate protection, could be 
freely reproduced, its author 
receiving no profit at all; 
there is even the possibility of 
distortion or wrongful use. 
‘The author is in no position to 
take defensive measures. 
To widen the sphere of pro- 
tection over literary and artis- 
tic works in different coun- 
tries, international agreements 
on copyright have been estab- 
lished. But since there are 
several of these agreements, 
the international protection 
of the artist’s ownership is not 
uniformly assured throughout 
the world. In some regions, 
there is no protection at all. 
A book published in English 
by a British citizen in Great 
Britain is automatically pro- 
tected in the whole of the Bri- 
tish Commonwealth, in 22 Eu- 
ropean countries, two South 
American countries, Israel and 
five Arabic-speaking coun- 
tries. The same book is also 
protected, with reservations, in 
seven other countries. 
Towards A Universal 
Convention

fulfilled the formalities re- 
quired by Chilean legislation, 
which include the deposit of 
T AKE the case of a book 
extra copies for each of the 
signatory countries to the 
Convention of Rio-de-Janeiro, 
his rights will be safeguarded 
only in ten Latin American 
countries, in four European 
countries and in three Arabic- 
speaking countries. 
Foreign works come under 
different regulation in almost 
every country. Some laws give 
equal protection to national 
and foreign works Others only 
protect works created or pub- 
lished on national territory. 
Others again give varying 
treatment to foreign authors 
according to whether or not 
they belong to a country with 
which an agreement has been 
signed. : 
Such cases give only a par- 
tial idea of the confusion that 
exists regarding copyright, and 
of the need for the work un- 
dertaken by Unesco. 
This work is not so much 
intended to achieve a stan- 
dardization of national legisla- 
tions, but to unite internatio- 
nal conventions now in force 
into a single convention that 
will include not only countries 
which adhere to existing 
agreements but also those 
which have so far remained

designed to give employment and homes to nearly 700.000 Arabs refugees. 
Unesco's work for Palestine refugee children has resulted,. thanks to 
the co-operation of relief organizations and the generosity of donors all 
over the world, in the opening of over 62 schools now attended by over 
33.000 children. To enable the education and training of these children 
to continue, Unesco’s Fifth General Conference issued an appeal for 
further assistance “in the name of civilization and humanity”.

in November... 
BENVENUTO CELLINI 
On 1! November 1500 an 
artist was born in Flo- 
rence who was almost 
perfectly “typical” of the 
vigorous and questing 
spirit of the Renaissance. 
His compatriot Baldinucci 
described him as fol- 
lows: “Benvenuto, ren- 
owned for his flute play- 
ing and his great skill as 
a goldsmith, an excellent 
engraver of medallions, a 
sculptor of more than or- 
dinary distinction, an ar- 
chitect and metal-fcunder, 
an ardent admirer of Mi- 
chelangelo, skilful, vigo- 
rous, bold of speech and 
with a natural eloquence, ready at all times with 
the cutting phrase or repartee, and wont to ex- 
press his opinions with the utmost frankness, 
irrespective of his audience. even to people of 
the highest rank...” 
THE METRIC SYSTEM 
In their decree of the 13th Brumaire in the 
year IX (4 November 1800) the Consuls of the 
French Republic laid down: “First the decimal sys- 
tem of weights and measures shall be used 
throughout the Republic...” Man thus ceased to 
be the measure of all things. Cubit, foot, inch, 
acre, yard and fathom, gave place to more exact 
and objectively definable quantities as did the 
grain, pint, bushel, quart and pound. 
Huygens and the mathematician Picard had al- 
ready proposed that the unit of length should be 
that of the pendulum whose oscillation measured 
seconds, but it was not until the Revolution that 
universally applicable measures were adopted : 
the me‘re—a ten millionth part of a meridional 
quadrant of the earth; the kilogramme—the 
weight of a litre of pure water at 4° centigrade. 
‘FOR THE PURPOSES OF MUTUAL 
UNDERSTANDING...’ 
Five years ago, Unesco was established. On 
16 November 1945, representatives of 40 govern- 
ments and 7 in‘ernational organizations, assembled 
in London, signed the Final Act, which is now 
the Constitution of Unesco. On behalf of their 
peoples, the governments then declared that : 
“The States pariies to this Constitution, believ- 
ing in full and equal opportunities for education 
for all, in the unrestricted pursuit of objective 
truth, and in the free exchange of ideas and 
knowledge, are agreed and determined to develop 
and to increase the means of communication bet- 
ween their peoples and to employ these means 
   
for the purposes of mutual understanding and a 
truer and a more perfect knowledge of each 
other's lives’. 
LEO TOLSTOIl 
Two months before his death, on November 20, 
1910, Count Tolstoy, greatest writer of his time, 
wrote a letter to Mahatma Gandhi, then a lawyer 
practising in Johannesburg, on non-resistance, 
anpther name for the “law of love which has 
been preached by all the sages... and expressed 
most clearly by Christ...” “The aspiration of the 
soul for communion with our fellow men”, he 
wrote, “is the only ultimate law of life”. “And 
50”, he told the young Hindu, “your work in the 
Transvaal, which seems to us to lie at the utter- 
most end of the earth, is yet the thing on which 
our interest is concentrated; it is the most im- 
portant work in the world today...” 
ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON 
- On 13 November 1850, 
Stevenson began the fe- 
verish life which was to 
take him from his native 
Scotland through a suc- 
cession of seaside resorts, 
hotels and sanatoria to 
the fabulous islands of 
the Pacific. His tubercu- 
losis gave him little 
peace, yet the creation of 
a new book marked al- 
most every stopping-place 
on his distressful journey. 
The last phase of his life 
began in 1890 when Ste- 
venson, his wife and his 
adopted son, cruising in 
the Pacific, landed in 
Samoa, where Stevenson started to build a house. 
He was to remain there until his death, as the - 
protector of the people, the friend of the king, 
and almost a king himself, exhausting himself 
by his efforts to stir the world to indignation 
against colonial exploitation.

   Australia’s “Phantom Schools” 
| Serve 18,000 Children 
By Walter GEORGE 
| Dig in Australia is free and compulsory, and yet 18,000 
children don’t go to school. 
way of His Majesty's mails. 
Instead, the school goes to them by 
In each of the Commonwealth's 
six capital cities there is a school, complete with complement of 
teachers, yet no pupils are to be seen; a kind of phantom school. 
If you ask, you'll be told that ils pupils are all over an immense 
land —in the mountains and forests of Victoria perhaps; in the tropics 
of Queensland, or the Northern Territory; in the far north of Western 
Australia—anywhere, in fact, where Australian children need educa- 
tion and are out of reach of Australian schools. 
These are the Correspondence Schools. Since early in the first 
World War, they have been taking education to children, and to 
some adults. Some pupils lived in lonely, outback homesteads or 
prospector’s camps, or were isolated in lighthouses, or travelling 
with some circus. Others were bedridden or in hospital. 
Several years ago, two children did a full course while fravelling 
with their mother through England, Europe, and America. 
In Vietoria, for example, educa- 
tion by correspondence began in 
1914, when a countryman who lived 
nore than eight miles from the 
nearest school asked the Education 
Department if anything could be 
done to teach two of his boys. The 
Chief schools’ inspector passed the 
question on to the principal of the 
Teachers’ Training College, who 
put it to some of the students. 
Five of them volunteered to try 
teaching the boys by correspond- 
ence, each one making himself 
responsible for a subject. Before 
long, they were sending out lessons 
to a younger brother as well, and 
soon afterwards there were so 
many requests for correspondence 
work that the student teachers 
could not cope with them. 
That was when the correspond- 
ence schools officially came into 
being. Other States soon followed 
suit, and now, although there is 
some slight = variation between 
States, the broad plan is Common- 
wealth-wide. 
At each of the headquarters 
schools, those phantom scheols at 
the State capital, is a headmaster 
or mistress with a staff of one 
teacher to about every 40 or 45 
pupils enrolled. 
Keynote of the work is a friendly 
personal interest, and letters and 
gifts that come to the schools show 
what a happy bond exists. 
The schools usually provide three 
courses of instruction. The primary 
course covers all the normal 
subjects children learn during their 
first seven years at school, and in 
the last two years the giris learn 
plain sewing and cookery. In the 
super - primary course, children 
prepare for the Qualifying Cer- 
tificate (common entrance) exami- 
nation, and most of the work is in 
English, with craft - work like 
fancy stitching, free-hand drawing, 
elementary design, some applied 
arts, knitting, and crocheting. The 
secondary course is for (hose 
preparing for the Intermediate 
(junior local), and Leaving Cer- 
tificate (matriculation) examina- 
tions.

Parents Learn Too 
LL this brings about a close 
friendship between teacher, 
parents, and pupils, for 
teachers sometimes have to instruct 
supervisors as much as they du 
children. : 
Usually the supervisors are 
mothers who, despite the many 
duties of the outback housewife, 
are willing to do anything to help 
their children receive an education. 
It is noticeable that the less 
educated a mother is, the more 
determined she is that her children 
shall learn their lessons. : 
One mother wrote : “I will do my 
best to keep the children’s work up 
to standard, but when I tell you 
that 1 have five children between 
the ages of five and eleven, as well 
as a tiny baby, you will understand 
just how difficult it is al times {ov 
cope with ceerything”. 
One mother could read only very 
little herself when she applied to a 
school for lessons for her first 
child, When the first set arrived, 
she learned the lesson herself 
before giving it to the child. After 
a few weeks she managed to gel 
one set ahead. She carried on like 
this for years until, in fact, her 
child passed the Qualifying exami- 
nation. Eventually her five children 
completed the course. 
Many of the children, too, do 
their work under great difficulties. 
One liltle girl who could not walk, 
did everything up to the Leaving 
examination by correspondence. 
Another, who lived far out on the 
Nullarbor Plains, in. Western 
Australia, was left motherless at 
the age of nine. She carried on 
bravely with cooking, bread-making. 
sewing and mending for the family. 
and found time to do her own 
correspondence lessons and super- 
vise those of her two brothers. Her 
lesson books were always a model 
of neatness.

Besides giving formal instruction 
in school subjects, the correspond- 
ence schools do a great deal to 
foster a sense of community life 
among outback children, and to 
lead their interests into wider 
fields. 
Not only children learn from the 
schools. Many adults have taken 
advantage of the lessons, and the 
school rolls include well-sinkers, 
opal miners, station hands, and 
alien immigrants who want to 
earn English. 
These, then, are the correspond- 
ence schools, Their work is not 
as well known as it should be in 
the cities, but they have a very 
real place in the hearts of the 
country people. This is easy to 
‘understand, for the schools bring

education {o children who other-. 
wise would be untaught, and 
enlightment where it has been 
previously shut out.
