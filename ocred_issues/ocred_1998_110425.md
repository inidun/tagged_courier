1997, pastel and ink 
(81cm x 65 cm) 
by Jean-Baptiste Belvisi 
Doors of buildings in the 
Medina of Tunis are 
depicted in this pastel by 
Jean-Baptiste Belvisi, a 
Tunisian-born artist who 
lives in France. Together 
with members of his family 
and figures from Arab 
mythology, they are a 
recurrent theme of Belvisi’s 
work, which seeks to 
recreate the atmosphere of 
his Tunisian childhood. The 
artist makes extensive use 
of pastel to evoke the 
colours reflected on the 
doors of the old city in the 
morning and evening light, 
and says, “My pastel stick is 
my bridge between East and 
West.” As a sign of his 
desire to strengthen the 
fragile link between the two 
worlds, he used the 
expression Trait d’union 
(“Hyphen”) as the title for 
a recent exhibition held in 
Tunisia of his works on the 
door motif.

This issue explores the idea of frugality in its most positive sense. Not as 
deprivation enforced by lack of resources or as willed abstinence but as 
moderation of conduct—eating habits being only one aspect of this—responding to a need 
to strike a balance and to draw an acceptable line between the necessary and the 
superfluous. 
But who should draw this line? And according to what criteria? Here there is 
considerable room for subjective opinion. Even if it is accepted that a minimum of 
quantitative, objective needs must be met in terms of food, clothing and housing, itis 
clear that history, culture, tradition and hierarchies of values are bound to have a big say 
when it comes to defining quality of life. To take just one example among many, the idea of 
well-being is bound to vary depending on whether or not one is used to the standards of 
comfort associated with the consumer society. 
For the consumer society is here challenged on two counts. Philosophically in the 
sense that it artificially stokes up certain needs; economically in the sense that satisfaction 
of these needs, which have now spread all over the world, is only possible for the few and 
provokes mounting frustration among the many. 
Nowhere in these pages does frugality appear as a counsel of despair, a call for the 
victims of the consumer society to tighten their belts. It is presented instead as an 
alternative philosophy, a vision of Life that replaces today’s malfunctions and distortions 
with a sense of balance, on the social and human scale, between needs and resources, 
especially between material needs and ethical, aesthetic and recreational aspirations. 
What remains to be seen is whether such an attempt to find a way between materialism 
and the spiritual aspects of life can be successful. |

### 110419: A Subversive idea

A subversive idea 
The values of frugality fly in the face of the prevailing 
economic order 
It is doubtful whether many people 
“would subscribe openly and explicitly to 
the notion that human happiness derives 
exclusively, or even mainly, from the con- 
sumption of goods and services, or that the 
only, or even main, way of increasing that 
happiness is to increase consumption. So it is 
surprising that this notion has come to exer- 
cise a near-dictatorial power over public pol- 
icy, and thence over the way societies are run 
and over the directions in which they are con- 
strained to develop. How has this situation 
come about? What results has it had? What 
would be the rationale for, and some of the 
implications of, an alternative view of how 
human happiness comes about, in which fru- 
gality plays a significant role? 
Clearly all living things need to consume in 
order to stay alive, and humans are no excep- 
tion. The use of matter and energy is neces- 
sary to sustain our bodies and to protect us 
from hostile environments. Many, but not 
all, human societies have also sought to achieve 
more than this by generating (often through 
the use of slave or forced labour) surpluses 
over and above basic consumption needs in 
order to build civilizations. But until rela- 
tively modern times the goal of such civiliza- 
tions was not simply to increase aggregate con- 
sumption. While they seem to have been no 
less fond of wealth and power than modern

BY PAUL EKINS 
societies, they also had complex belief systems 
which provided them with explanations of 
human life and purpose that went far beyond 
accumulation and consumption. 
Economic growth: 
benefits and costs 
It was the conceptualization of “the economy” 
as a macro-social entity, and of economics as a 
macro-social science, rather than as household 
management (which is the root meaning of the 
word) that began to stress the importance of 
consumption as an end in itself. Adam Smith, 
often called the father of economics, wrote: 
“Consumption is the sole end and purpose of 
all production.” As the economy has come to 
dominate public discourse, and as the only goal 
of economics is to increase consumption, which 
it views as synonymous with human welfare, 
this has become the prime objective of modern 
societies. No matter what the question, in prac- 
tical politics economic growth is the answer. 
This primacy is acknowledged in the collective 
term used to describe Western industrial soci- 
eties: consumer societies. 
Atleast for those who tried it first the pro- 
ject of increasing consumption has been phe- 
nomenally successful in its own terms. Eco- 
nomic output in the early industrialized 
economies has increased by orders of magni- 
tude over the last 200 years. This has brought 
many benefits to the populations which have 
participated in this growth. These benefits 
should be neither denied nor belittled. They 
are so obvious to those who do not yet have 
them that in practically every country of the 
world their achievement has become the prin- 
cipal social project. 
But with these benefits have gone costs. 
Most obviously the explosion of consump- 
tion, coupled with the growth of human pop- 
ulation, and the vast increase in the use of energy 
and materials that have accompanied them, have 
put unprecedented pressure on natural systems. 
Other costs are less easy to measure and 
quantify but are no less keenly perceived. The 
processes of capitalistic accumulation through 
competition in markets, the promotion of 
which is now generally considercd to take pri- 
ority over all other social cbjectives, have led to 
what can only be described as profound social 
unease. Social institutions, like the family or 
community, disintegrate or degenerate; anti- 
social behaviour—crime, vandalism, drug 
abuse—proliferates; unemployment becomes 
less cyclical and more structural at higher levels,

and threatens previously secure white-collar 
employees; countries that try to sustain com- 
prehensive systems of social security find them 
an unsustainable economic burden, those that 
donot experience sharp increases in inequality; 
and, finally, social values of trust, integrity and 
public service are eroded by the increasing iden- 
tification of personal success with private gain. 
Clearly notall these phenomena are equally 
evidentin all countries, but they are ever more 
apparent in both industrialized and industri- 
alizing societies. Not only are they negative 
effects in themselves, but they threaten to ren- 
der the growth proccss unsustainable. Growth 
in all the old industrial economies is substan- 
tially slower in the 1990s than in previous 
decades. It is at least possible that these 
economies are beginning to experience social as 
well asenvironmental limits to growth. This is 
potentially traumatic in a society for which 
economic growth is the be all and end all of 
social purpose. Perhaps it is time to ask whether 
there are other sources of human happiness 
which could be given a higher social profile and 
receive greater emphasis in public policy. 
Once sources of human happiness apart 
from consumption start to be identified, they 
seem so obvious that it is difficult to under- 
stand how they were cver allowed to be mar- 
ginalized by the quest for economic growth or 
compromised by its consequences. They 
include: stable, caring families; secure, con- 
vivial communities; meaningful and satisfying 
work; good health; a sense of personal identity

and social purpose; a diverse, beautiful and 
sustainable natural environment; and open, 
participatory and democratic societies. 
Clearly these sources of happiness are inter- 
related in many different ways. Equally clearly 
they can be, and have been, adversely affected 
by a pursuit of economic growth that does 
not recognize their value. A question then 
arises as to what concept may be able to tem- 
per modern societies’ obsession with growth 
in order to give weight to some of these other 
sources of human happiness. This is where the 
idea of frugality may havea role to play. 
Downshifting 
In a society devoted to consumption, it is 
hard not to identify frugality with notions of 
sactifice, of “doing without” or “giving things 
up”. Such identifications are, however, mis- 
placed. Certainly frugality implies modest 
consumption and simplicity in personal 
lifestyle. But these are not motivated by 
abstract asceticism or self-denial, but from a 
perception that frugality in consumption per- 
mits a greater emphasis to be placed on other 
aspects of human experience, which are actually 
more personally rewarding and fulfilling than 
consumption. Far from entailing self-denial, 
frugality in this reading is a means of libera- 
tion, An all-absorbing concern with con- 
sumption is replaced by the pursuit of other 
values that yield more happiness. 
This may seem fanciful, but in fact just

### 110419: A Subversive idea

» such a calculus is at the heart of the growing 
movement of “downshifting” which has taken 
place in recent years, especially in the United 
States. Downshifters are people who, by 
reducing their employment commitments, 
and therefore their income, have chosen some 
or all of the following: to have more time 
with their families; to contribute to their com- 
munities; to do more work of their own 
choosing; to experience less stress; to reduce 
their impact on, and/or increase their contact 
with the natural environment. So much 
momentum had this movement gathered by 
1995 that the Wall Street Journal was openly 
speculating whether so many people refraining 
from market-based consumption could have 
a depressing effect on share prices. Such a con- 
cern well expresses how deeply subversive fru- 
gality is of the prevailing economic order. 
However, a commitment to frugality in 
order to have the time and attention to con- 
centrate on other sources of human happiness 
and fulfilment is entirely in line with some 
recent theories of human motivation and behav- 
iour. For example, the American psychologist 
and philosopher Abraham Maslow postulated 
that humans have a hierarchy of needs, in that 
they seek first to satisfy material needs of com- 
fortable survival and security, then are con- 
cerned with social needs, including being 
accepted and esteemed by their social group, 
and then direct their energies towards the sat- 
isfaction of self-actualization needs, seeking to 
actinaccordance with ideals of love, truth, jus- 
tice and acsthetics in order to realize a higher 
human purpose. In this framework increasing 
material consumption is irrelevant to human 
fulfilment once a reasonable standard of living

tion Max-Neef calls “satisfiers”. Some satisfiers 
only satisfy the needs to which they are 
directed, while others synergistically satisfy 
other needs as well. Less positively, there are 
“pseudo-satisfiers”, which do not really sat- 
isfy the relevant need; “inhibitors”, which sat- 
isfy one need but simultaneously inhibit the 
satisfaction of others; and “violators” which 
militate against the satisfaction even of the need

identity), over-indulgence in watching televi- 
sion (a leisure pursuit which inhibits creativity) 
and the arms race (which sought to give both 
sides protection but ended up making them 
both less secure). From this perspective over- 
emphasis on material consumption is often 
evidence of a counter-productive fixation with 
pscudo-satisfiers, inhibitors or violators. Con- 
versely, embracing frugality can be a means of 
liberation from negative satisfiers involving 
material consumption, in order to concentrate 
on satisfying needs of which consumption is 
not and cannot be an authentic satisfier. 
It seems, therefore, that frugality is a valid, 
and perhaps a necessary, value of a society that is 
truly promotive of human fulfilment. This 
raises questions as to why it occupies little or no 
space in the social psyches of industrial cultures, 
and why frugality as a value (if not material 
deprivation as a fact) is increasingly being driven 
out of societies worldwide. The answer to the 
second question is largely historical and has to 
do with power and empire. Put crudely, cul- 
tures geared to increasing material consumption 
developed more powerful weapons than those 
which valued frugality, permitting the former to 
conquer, and colonize or enslave the latter. Decol- 
onization and independence generally failed to 
restore traditional values of frugality, the resid- 
ual of which have suffered a further sustained 
assault from the globalization of Western com- 
merce, culture and consumerism. 
Unresolved contradictions 
The answer to the first question renders very 
problematic the rediscovery of frugality in cap- 
italist industrial societies. In such societies, where 
the achievement of greater material consump- 
tion has become the dominant social objective, 
economic growth is a condition not just of sup- 
posed greater human well-being, but also of 
basic economic stability. Capitalism operates 
through the generation of economic surplus 
that accumulates into capital and generates more 
production through investment. Unless eco- 
nomic growth 1s in prospect, capitalists will not 
invest. Economic growth requires increased con- 
sumption, even in the richest societies in the 
world. Such a requirement is hardly consistent 
with a resurgence of frugality. 
Moreover, under capitalism, work is orga- 
nized as employment. The profitability of 
business is increased when labour becomes 
more productive, and the whole thrust of 
technological development has been and is to 
raise labour productivity. Yet without eco- 
nomic growth increased labour productivity 
in a given labour force means greater unem- 
ployment, with all its attendant personal mis- 
ery and social strain. If a new commitment to 
frugality were to hold back growth in con- 
“Perhaps it is time to ask 
whether there are other 
sources of human happiness 
apart from consumption.”

sumption, but the forces increasing labour 
productivity were to continue to operate, then 
frugality would have produced unemploy- 
ment, which is hardly a recipe for human hap- 
piness even among the more frugally inclined. 
Developing new institutions and ways of 
working that can resolve the contradictions 
between frugality as an individual value and the 
social need under capitalism for investment, 
economic growth and more jobs, will not be 
casy. It will only happen, of course, if the quest 
for frugality becomes a far more widespread 
and potent social movement than is currently 
the case even with regard to downshifting in the 
United States. If greater adherence to the value 
of frugality is indeed a necessary part of the 
solution to the environmental destruction and 
social degeneration brought about by materi- 
alistic consumerism, the transition whereby 
frugality is either accommodated to capitalism, 
or transforms it into a different social and eco- 
nomic system, is likely to be a rough ride. W

### 110420: Is frugality a virtue?

Is frugality a 
virtue? 
BY JAMES GRIFFIN 
If not an end in itself, frugality can 
lead to a better quality of life 
3) Does frugality have some sort of ethi- 
W cal status? Orisitjustan optional “life- 
style” —admirable in its way, perhaps, but 
admirable as lavish life-styles can be too? Is 
frugality any more firmly rooted in values 
than luxury is? 
Or is it, perhaps, valuable only in special 
circumstances, when food or clothes or other 
goods are in short supply and sparing con- 
sumption is only good sense? Is it a virtue in 
the Third World but not in the First? Is it 
appropriate in some settings and wildly inap- 
propriate in others? 
Well, let us see where frugality might fit 
into ethics. It is not a virtue, at least in the 
sense that philosophers use that word. It may 
be a virtue in a popular, everyday sense: that is, 
generally a good thing, a thing to be admired 
or praised. I shall come back to that possibil- 
ity in a moment. By a “virtue” philosophers 
mean a disposition that will carry one through 
typical trying circumstances in life, when, 
without the virtue, one’s spirit would be either 
deficient or in excess. 
Temperance is the classic virtue closest to 
frugality. A temperate person does not react to 
testing circumstances with either too much 
heat or too little, too much desire or too little. 
Temperance is defined as striking a certain sort 
of desirable balance. But what is suspicious 
about frugality is, precisely, that it stands res- 
olutely at one extreme: sparing use. But why is 
that the right balance? And balance between 
what vices? On one side of sparing use we might 
see waste. But what is on the other side? On the 
other side we might see hurtful under 
consumption. But why should we regard fru- 
gality as the ideal balance between these two

evils? One could go well beyond frugality into 
a fairly liberal use of goods without crossing 
over into waste. Why is this greater liberality 
not the more desirable balance? 
Nor, I think, is frugality intrinsically valu- 
able. Imagine, first, a frugal life: I am careful and 
sparing in all that [ use; I consume enough for 
health but no more than is required for me 
to meet simple, basic needs. Now imagine a 
non-frugal life: I am less vigilant about and 
more liberal in what I use; I consume more 
than is strictly needed for iy basic nceds but 
[ do not waste anything. Now, if one sees cach 
The cultivation of “deep 
personal relations” is an 
aspect of the good life that 
societies based on 
consumption tend to 
relegate to the 
background. Above,

The quest to understand

of these lives simply as the lives I have just 
described and apart from any consequences 
that they might have, is there any reason to say 
that one is better than the other? I atleast can 
see no reason to think so. 
So if a frugal life 1s in some way valuable, it 
must be because of the things that it leads to. 
It must be, not intrinsically valuable, but 
instrumentally valuable. 
And here, it seems to me, there is an inter- 
esting case. Frugality strikes most modern 
people as out of date—and that no doubt for 
different reasons. It seems appropriate to a life 
of scarcity and as the world grows richer, fru- 
gality grows irrelevant. And Freud will have 
had something to do with it: we suspect that 
behind a frugal exterior there is an unattractive, 
anal-retentive interior. But, most of all, our 
modern value system seems to have gone over 
to a form of consumerism. Weare dominated 
by an economic model of the quality of life. 
A human is seen as a complex of desires. The 
quality of a human life is seen as in direct pro- 
portion to the satisfaction of these desires. 
The social sciences, and through them the pop- 
ular consciousness, are dominated by this 
desire-satisfaction model of value. 
But its dominance is now, fortunately, 
 
  
weakening. The theory is poor. One cannot 
equate what makes a person’s life good with 
what satisfies that person’s desires. Itis possi- 
ble—in fact, all too common—for a person’s 
desires to be satisfied and the person be no 
better off. For example, I may desire revenge on 
someone—indeed it may be the strongest 
desire in my life—yet find that when I have it 
I am no better off, even possibly worse off. 
An instrument for good 
Nothing becomes valuable just by being 
desired. Some things in life just are valuable 
and others not. That is a strong claim, and a 
much disputed one in philosophy, but it 
seems to me right. [ think that, with experi- 
ence, we can compile a list of the valuable 
things in life—the things that may not make 
absolutely any life better (people are too var- 
ious for that) but that make normal human 
lives better. My list would contain at least 
these unsurprising things: enjoyment, deep 
personal relations, accomplishing something 
in the course of one’s life, understanding cer- 
tain basic metaphysical and moral matters, 
autonomy, and liberty. 
Consumerism is not just weak in theory. It 
does not work out happily in practice either. »

One all too common feature of the life of a 
modern consumer is that one set of desires is 
satisfied only to be succeeded by a new set, 
with no advance in quality of life. These con- 
sumerist desires often form a treadmill. One 
runs but makes no real advance. When that 
happens, it is clear that onc has lost sight of 
values. What are really valuable are the things 
on the list that I just mentioned. And other 
things are valuable, valuable in a secondary, 
instrumental way, if they lead to the values 
on the list. 


### 110420: Is frugality a virtue?

This, it seems to me, is where frugality 
comes in. Itis valuable if, and only if, a frugal 
style of life is generally conducive to some of

the values on the list. There ts much to be said 
for that. A frugal life avoids the more value- 
destroying forms of consumerism. A frugal 
life tends to be a simple life, and, though sim- 
plicity in life is not guaranteed to put one in 
touch with real values, it substantially increases 
the chances that one will be. Many of us, from 
time to time, have had the experience of living 
more simply than we usually do and finding 
ourselves, as a result, more in harmony with 
what matters in life. Of course, we return to 
our everyday life and lose this precious insight. 
That is another reason why a frugal life-style 
can be valuable. One’s style of life not only 
can embody values; it can also be the best way

to open one’s eyes to values that one would 
otherwise be blind to. 
That is to say that frugality can, in this 
instrumental way, be a personal good. It can 
also be a community good. A frugal commu- 
nity can save and invest for a better future. 
Frugality can also be a global good—indeed, a 
little more frugality may be necessary simply 
to avoid global disaster. We consume fossil 
fuels without serious constraint. We justify 
ourselves with the thought that advancing 
technology will be sure to come up with sub- 
stitutes for them. But just as good? Without 
undesirable side-effects? We do not really 
know. And our consumerism pollutes the 
atmosphere, producing global warming. We

certainly do not know all the consequences 
in store for us from that. 
But I must not end with praise of frugality. 
My life is better for my living simply on holi- 
days, consuming much less than I normally do. 
But then I live in the prosperous part of the 
world. I choose simplicity. But millions of peo- 
ple are forced to consume sparingly. They are 
destitute. Their lives are not better for it. The big 
killer in the world is not war or periodic famine. 
It 1s something undramatic and unreported: 
chronic malnutrition. Chronic hunger, some 
claim, kills eighteen to twenty million people 
annually, which is over twice the number that 
died annually in the Second World War. Their 
sparing consumption is nothing butevil. MH

WM Posterity has seen you as a pleasure-seeker and 
your philosophy as pure hedonism—the opposite of 
the truth, since your whole philosophy of pleasure 
revolves around the idea of moderation. But what is 
it based on? 
Epicurus: Firstly, on the idea that pleasure is 
the beginning and end of a happy life. We seek 
pleasure only when we are suffering as a result 
of the absence of pleasure, and when we are 
not suffering, it is of no concern to us. Sec- 
ondly, on an ordering of our desires: some 
are necessary, others merely natural, and yet 
others vain. By necessary desires we mean those 
that relieve some pain, like the desire to drink 
when we are thirsty; by natural but not nec- 
essary desires, we mean those that simply 
diversify our pleasures without relieving 
pain—like the desire to drink good wine. 
Among vain desires is the desire to offer 
wreathes or erect statues. 
Desires which, if unfulfilled, do not cause 
pain are not necessary. They involve an appetite 
that may easily be restrained whenever it is 
hard to satisfy, or when it is harmful. Nat- 
ural desires whose non-fulfillment does not

Plain living

AN IMAGINARY INTERVIEW WITH

A bust of the Greek

Herculanum (lHtaly, 
3rd century B.C.) 
cause pain and which take the form of a violent 
appetite are desires formed by an empty mind. 
Such pleasure as they bring comes not from 
them but from our vanity. 
HM [nwhat forms of behaviour is this ethic 
expressed in daily life? 
Epicurus: The simplest of dishes give as much 
pleasure as a groaning board when the suffer- 
ing caused by want is absent. Bread and water 
afford the keenest of pleasures to those long 
deprived of them. Leading a simple, modest 
life is thus a good way to stay healthy, and 
moreover enables a man to face up stout-heart- 
edly to the tasks that life imposes and to bet- 
ter appreciate occasional high living, and for- 
tifies him against the fickleness of fortune. 
Hence, when we say that pleasure is the 
supreme good, we are not speaking of the plea- 
sures of the debauchee, nor of sensual aban- 
don, as is claimed by certain ignorant persons 
who take issue with us and misrepresent our 
thinking. We are speaking of the absence of 
physical suffering and of moral disquiet; for 
neither drunken revelry nor continual feasting, 
nor the enjoyment to be had from consorting 
with catamites and women, nor yet that deriv- 
ing from tables heavy laden with fish and 
meats, none of these afford a happy life, but 
reasonable and sober habits, reason ever seek- 
ing after legitimate causes of clection or aver- 
sion and rejecting any opinions that might 
greatly trouble the soul. 
The principle underlying all this, and at 
the same time its greatest benefit, is prudence. 
It must be adjudged superior to philosophy 
itself, since it is the source of all the virtues, 
which teach us that happiness cannot be 
attained without prudence, honesty and jus- 
tice, and that these things cannot be obtained 
without pleasure. Indeed, the virtues origi- 
nate from a happy life, which in turn is insep- 
arable from the virtues. |

### 110423: Three exceptional figures

Three exceptional figures 
Frugality as a moral and 
political protest against 
the established order 
BY ADAM ROBERTS 
Frugality implies care or sparingness in the use or supply of 
food and other resources. The first “frugal” people were 
those who lived by gathering fruit (fruges in Latin), and were des- 
ignated as frugal by the Romans, whose life has also been described 
as “a frugal thing, sparing in food, temperate in drink, modest in 
clothing, cleanly in habit.” I would suggest that a frugal person is 
one who is able to make informed decisions concerning his or her 
use of resources, and does so believing that moderate consumption 
allows other pleasures or benefits to be enjoyed. 
The lifestyles of frugal individuals illustrate how the idea of “fru- 
gality” differs from others such as meanness or prudence. If frugal- 
ity 1s to do with making rational choices about consumption and how 
to live one’s life, frugal persons must have the opportunity not to be 
frugal and yet choose to be this way. To adopt a frugal way of life is to 
adopt an ethical, if nota political, position. Here are some examples:   
toicism was prominent between 300 
B.C.and 180 A.D.,as a philosophy 
and a guide to right conduct. Roman 
Epictetus 
( ) 50-125 A.D. 
Stoics were interested, almost exclu- 
sively, in ethical and political issues of 
concern to all people, not only the 
privileged few. Four beliefs characterize 
the Stoics’ view of the world: that all 
people are radically equal and part of 
the natural universe; that thercare nat- 
ural laws; that a person should live in 
perfect conformity with nature; and 
that fate is determined. The text 
Encheiridion contains Epictetus’ 
thoughts, many of which reflect his 
attitude towards consumption and 
frugality. Here is his advice to a young 
man sitting down to a great feast: “But 
if when things are setin front of you, 
you do not take them but despise 
them, then you will not only sharea 
banquet with the gods but also be a 
ruler along with them.” Here is a sign 
that frugality is a political action. 
Choosing to control, strictly, how 
you consume is a controversial act. 
Epictetus warned about this too, and 
discouraged his followers from show- 
ing off: “When you have become 
adapted to living cheaply as far as your 
body is concerned, do not make a 
show of it, and if you drink water do 
not say at every opcning that you 
drink water. If you wish to train your- 
self to hardship, do it for yourself and 
not for those outside.”

Henry David 
Thoreau 
(1817-1862) 
 
Mahatma Gandhi 
(1869-1948) 
  
THE UNESCO Gounier B JANUARY 1998 
A young, Harvard-educated Ameri- 
can, Henry Thoreau chose in 1845 
to live alone for two yearsina wooden 
forest hut not far from Concord 
(Massachusetts). While his university 
contemporaries were away making 
small fortunes, trading and dealing, 
Thoreau built his hut using a few hand 
tools and some old planks, planted 
beans and listened to the water ripple in 
Walden pond. Ridding himself of the 
trappings of a “civilized life” and try- 
ing to live self-sufficiently, he was 
repeating the experience of the carly 
American settlers. The difference was 
that he wrote about it, and celebrated 
the virtues of a simple life. “The ancient 
philosophers, Chinese, Hindoo, Per- 
sian and Greek, were a class than which 
none has been poorer in outward 
riches, nonce so rich inward,” he 
enthused, hoping to emulate them in 
both respects. His book Walden (1854) 
is a manifesto against modern indus- 
(Phe Great Soul” Gandhi is a pow- 
erful example of a man who used 
issucs of frugality and poverty in his 
philosophy, politics and private life. 
In 1888, when he moved from India 
to Britain, he joined the London Veg- 
ctarian Society. There he met George 
Bernard Shaw and the travelling lec- 
turer and socialist Edward Carpenter, 
who was then known as the “British 
Thoreau”. At that time he read the 
Bhagavadgita, which would become 
his “spiritual dictionary”, and became 
fascinated by two Sanskrit words in 
particular, aparigraba (non-posscs- 
sion) and samabhava (cquability). 
These influences led Gandhi to have an 
“irresistible attraction to a life of sim- 
plicity, manual labour and austerity”, 
and the belief that man has to jettison 
the material goods that cramp the life 
of the spirit. 
Ever since St. Francis of Assisi 
sought a life of poverty, chastity and 
humility, those who have preached such 
values have been seen as dangerous by 
authorities. Thus, when Gandhi moved 
to South Africa and set up as a farmer 
trial life and an account of the two 
years when he drank water from his 
pond, had a diet of pulses and pos- 
sessed a minimum of objects. He wrote 
that he would rather “sit on a pump- 
kin and have it all to myself, than be 
crowded on a velvet cushion.” In his 
hut there were only three chairs: one 
for solitude, two for friendship and 
three for society. 
He did all this by choice, aware that 
he had an option to return from such 
a life to a more “comfortable” one, but 
confident that “the so-called comforts 
of life are... positive hindrances to the 
elevation of mankind.” However, 
Thoreau eventually chose to opt out of 
his life-style, and after two years he 
returned from the woods to write and 
publish his book. But because of his 
experience he felt he had become a wiser 
observer of human life “from the van- 
tage point of what we should call vol- 
untary poverty.” 0 
near Durban, where he and his friends 
could live a simple life by the sweat of 
their brow, he took the first step 
towards becoming a controversial polit- 
ical activist. Gilbert Murray later 
warned, about Gandhi, that “Persons in 
power should be very careful how they 
deal with a man who cares nothing for 
sensual pleasure, nothing for riches, 
nothing for comfort or praise.” 
Six years later, Gandhi moved nearer 
to Johannesburg, and set up another 
farm, which he named Tolstoy, after 
the great Russian writer with whom 
he corresponded. Soon he began his 
political career, campaigning against 
racial laws in South Africa and the 
removal of voting rights from 
“coloured” voters. Back in India, he 
took frugality to its extreme, by con- 
ducting fasts for political ends (he also 
fasted to “stir the conscience and 
remove mental sluggishness”). In 1947 
he fasted in an attempt to stop riot- 
ing between Hindu and Muslim com- 
munities in Calcutta. Four months 
later, in Delhi, such a fast brought 
about another communal truce. (3

From zero

INTERVIEW WITH SHIOUN MICHIKO NAKASATO 
BW Are the drawings shown here inspired by 
calligraphy, like most of your works? 
Michiko Nakasato: Yes. In calligraphy you try 
to express yourself simply with lines and dots 
using two colours, black and white. White 
signifies space, which changes its features 
according to what you write on the sheet. It- 
could be spring or autumn, for example, * 
depending on what the artist wants. When 
you make the first stroke on a white sheet of 
paper, you should imagine doing it on the 
ocean. This first stroke is very important. You 
are making a mark on a vast space where there 
is nothing, and with this stroke the whole 
space becomes alive too. I thought of this when 
I did these drawings. 
\ 
BM What does the word ‘frugality’ signify to you? 
M. N.: 1 associate the notion of frugality with 
the presence of a strong individuality. It is not 
something imposed by others. It is a deter- 
mination to return to a life in which thereare 
only essential elements. Of course these ele- 
ments differ from one person to another. Each 
person’s choice must be respected.

### 110416: From zero towards one: interview with Shioun Michiko Nakasato

M. N.: I have always looked upon the number 
one as something extraordinary. Zero 1s the 
state where there is nothing. With the arrival of 
one, there is a birth. The distance between zero 
and one is not measurable. One is also differ- 
ent from other numbers in the sense that itis 
the only number we can call single; all the oth- 
ers (except for 0) are plural. In today’s world 
there is too much esteem for quantity and a 
neglect of the individual. 
HM Could you explain the drawings to us? 
M. N.: In the first set there is nothing at first. 
Then a stroke appears, and suddenly the space 
becomes alive. Then a second stroke arrives. 
This time there 1s an encounter. The notion 
of distance is created and the two strokes com- 
municate with each other. 
The process in the second set is similar, but 
the impression it gives is very different. The 
first stroke is powerful, and as the second 
stroke crosses the first, there is a sort of shock. 
The communication here is more violent; you 
feel a vibration in the space. 
In the last set, another type of space is cre- 
ated. There is tranquillity. Even when the second 
one touches the first and new spaces arecreated 
here and there, the atmosphere remains calm. 
I am not trying to say here what is right or 
wrong. I am just trying to show how space 
can be influenced by the movement of an indi- 
vidual. To me one plus one is not two, itisan 
encounter of one individual with another. B

based on the principle of shakker (literally, a 
“borrowing of landscape”), whereby a real fea- 
ture of the landscape is introduced into an 
artificial setting, and a bonsai may be regarded 
as an artificial, miniaturized symbol standing 
for nature in its entirety. 
In the formal gardens of Western coun- 
tries, the artistic conception is human-cen- 
tred. People cut and prune trees into sym- 
metrical shapes and build fountains whose

statues are erected and arranged for ornamen-

seem at first sight merely to be a downscaled 
version of nature, and the signs of human 
handiwork are unobtrusive, if not invisible. 
A floating’ life 
ina ‘floating’ world 
For the Japanese, nature and the world are syn- 
onymous. Over the centuries, they have 
accordingly developed a way of life based on 
moderation and respect for everyday objects. 
But Japan is today a consumer society, and 
the Japancse have become very materialistic. 
Contrary to a common misconception, 
Japan was already an economic power in the 
sixteenth century, and its standard of living 
may well have been even higher then than itis 
now. At the time of the Ashikaga shogunate 
(the Muromachi period, 1337-1573), the coun- 
try was very prosperous, as may be judged

from the splendour of the temples of that 
period, a prime example being the Kinkaku-ji, 
or Golden Pavilion, in Kyoto. However the 
influence of Buddhism, Zen Buddhism in par- 
ticular, produced a reaction against such osten- 
tation and a “renaissance” of aesthetic and 
moral criteria, a return to a tradition that 
emphasized simplicity, sobriety and purity 
of form, as typified in architecture by the 
shéin style in sixteenth-century architecture. 
This aesthetic is reflected in Japanese classical 
literature. The author of the Heike monogatari 
(“The Tale of the Heike”, second half of the 
twelfth century), for example, considers all for- 
tune to be fleeting and all prosperity to be 
doomed sooner or later to disappear. The com- 
bined influence of Buddhist culture and the 
hard living conditions caused by a rugged climate 
have led the Japanese to regard life on carth as a 
“floating” life, constantly changing and finally 
vanishing. The term #kiyo means both “float- 
ing world” and “world of privation”. 
For the Japanese, the ideal of beauty is to 
be found in communion with nature. The tea 
ceremony, an art that proceeds from the zen 
aesthetic, is not only a sequence of ritual ges- 
tures but a moment of harmony encompass- 
ing the world in its entirety. It was codified in 
the sixteenth century by Sen no Rikyd, who 
also created the wabi sabi acsthetic—beauty 
shorn of all ostentation that charms by its 
simplicity—underpinned by the Buddhist 
teaching that plenty cannotendure and is not 
to be found in immoderation. What should be 
respected is the transience of things. 
A tradition of moderation 
Respect for all things is thus a traditional atti- 
tude in Japan. Thereare some colloquial expres- 
sions, mottainai for instance, that express the 
chary national attitude to any kind of waste. 
Older people can remember saving water all 
their lives, though water is plentiful every- 
where in Japan. There is a single bathtub for 
each household, and people use it in the 
evenings after washing outdoors. But habits 
are changing and Japanese girls who used to 
wash their hair in the morning (asa-shan) now 
shampoo it again in the evening (yoru-shan). 
Grandparents also used to tell their grand- 
children not to leave so much as a single grain 
of rice in their bowls, an attitude that was in 
fact prevalent in all countries before waste was 
urged upon us by the consumer society. The 
Japanese have an insulting term for someone 
who wastes things—monogoroshi, “killer of 
objects”. Anyone to whom it is applied is a 
kind of social outcast since, according to an 
idea whose roots go back to animism, even 
inert objects have a soul. 
On a more down-to-earth level, we learn 
from sixteenth- and seventeenth-century 
archives that the reason why there were so few »

» waste-bins in Japanese cities was that people 
then made a point of using every object as 
long as possible. 
Changing times, changing ways 
Since the 1950s, Japan has modelled itself on 
the United States, a land of plenty where to be 
frugal is a vice and to consume a virtue. This 
trend, which is affecting more and more coun- 
tries, inevitably raises problems. If a country 
like China, for example, were to indulge in 
unrestrained mass consumption, the earth’ 
resources would very likely soon run out. 
Twenty years ago I bought a German car. It 
has so far done 280,000 km and I am still using 
it, to the derisive amusement of some of my 
friends, most of whom change cars every other 
year. The dynamism of the Japanese economy 
is fuelled by such behaviour patterns on the 
part of consumers. In fact, the law itself encour- 
ages people not to hang on too long to the 
same material goods. Motor vehicles, for exam- 
ple, have to undergo a thorough roadworthi- 
ness test after seven years, and an annual test 
thereafter. The test costs the equivalent of about 
$900, and it costs about $1,100 to send a vehi- 
cle to the scrapyard—an incentive on the part of 
the authorities to sell as soon as possible. 
Since the earth’s resources are limited, it is 
essential that our ways of life should change, 
that we find a new “global way of life”. In a

time maintaining a growth rate conducive to 
the raising of living standards. We, the con- 
sumer countries, should therefore work 
together to find a middle way that encourages 
neither American-style waste nor withdrawal 
into the past. |

~ There are two radically different ways 
for members of a society to satisfy all 
their needs: by producing a lot, as in Western 
societies, or by not wanting a lot, as in those 
the American anthropologist Marshall Sahlins 
has called “Zen” societies. The “Zen” way cho- 
sen by hunter-gatherer societies is to stop pro- 
ducing food as soon as they consider that the 
quantity in hand has reached a level sufficient 
for their needs. 
It has been shown, and statistically con- 
firmed, that, contrary to a widespread mis- 
conception, population groups who live by 
hunting, fishing and gathering do not live in 
utter privation, nor are they constantly in 
scarch of permanently inadequate food. On 
the contrary, they may be said to have created 
“the first affluent society”, spending only a 
few hours a day on meeting their material 
needs and keeping the rest of their time free for 
recreational and social activities. It is only 
observers who are unaware of these people’ 
cultural values who find their few plain pos- 
BY MARIE ROUE 
sessions so inadequate. Nomads, for instance, 
set particular store by light, portable objects, 
but this does not make them poor. One 
observer has testified that “their extremely 
limited material possessions relieve them of 
all cares with regard to daily necessities and 
permit them to enjoy life.” 
Sharing and solidarity 
However, not all hunter-gatherers live in an 
earthly paradise where they need only to stoop 
to pick fruit and vegetables and where game 
animals give themselves up voluntarily. Thereare 
some groups or families within these societies 
who can never manage, or can manage only at 
certain times, to meet all their needs, while any 
group is bound at times to include individuals 
who are too sick, too young or too old to take 
part in productive activities, and disaster can 
sometimes befall the harvest or the hunt. Itis 
in such circumstances that the sharing of 
resources becomes especially important.

observers claim that it fulfils the same func- 
tion—that of risk limitation—in “traditional” 
societies as insurance policies do in Western 
societies. By sharing a surplus thatin any case 
could not be consumed in the immediate 
future, individuals or families are ensuring 
that other members of the group will do the 
same for them when the time comes. Other 
observers, however, are not entirely satisfied 
with this materialist explanation, since it pre- 
supposes an egalitarian, turn-and-turn-about 
system, when in fact that is far from being 
the case, and it is rare for those who are never 
on the giving end to be excluded from the 
benefits of sharing. Why, in that case, do the

Inuits hunting for seal in 
Greenland. 
Every summer the Cree Indians 
of Chisasibi (Quebec, Canada) 
gather on the site of their 
former village. Below, meals 
are prepared jointly and 
served to everyone present. 
 
ablest hunters who, as everyone knows, pro- 
duce more than they can consume, continue to 
hunt large animals when nearly all the meat 
will be consumed by people other than their 
own kith and kin? For prestige and the atten- 
dant social advantages, to qualify as a hus- 
band, a son-in-law, a partner in some under- 
taking or simply an envied neighbour—these 
are some of the possible reasons. 
One good turn 
deserves another 
Beyond these reasons of self-interest, how- 
ever, underlying the good hunters’ generosity 
is a whole outlook that is intolerant of selfish 
individualism. In the past, Western mission- 
aries and travellers often misinterpreted atti- 
tudes quite unlike those that prevailed in the 
villages where they themselves grew up. Seeing 
how Eskimos and Bushmen feasted when 
food was abundant, so that sometimes there 
was nothing left over for lean times to come, 
they reproached them for their lack of fore- 
sight and their gluttony. But in fact feasting is 
another way of redistributing to the com- 
munity as a whole the foodstuffs brought 
back by its more fortunate members, thus 
strengthening the social fabric. 
There are also rules of sharing whereby 
“one good turn deserves another” through- 
out life, as with the Arviligjuarmiut Inuits 
when they share a seal they have killed as a 
team working together. Each member of the

team always receives the same part of the beast 
and indeed takes his name from it—“my 
shoulder”, “my head”, and so on. 
Some of the peoples living in the Arctic 
and sub-Arctic regions believe that the ani- 
mals caught by a hunter have given themselves 
to him, so it is not surprising, for example, 
that among the Cree Indians of Quebec the 
hunter’s generosity to his companions in the 
hunt should match that of his quarry. If the 
favour was not returned, the cycle would be 
broken and the animals would not let them- 
selves be caught. Similarly, when a feast is given 
everything must go, a custom that astonished 
those who first observed the Algonquins’ way 
of life and is still maintained today. When the 
whole village—visitors included—is invited 
to a feast, guests will find a plastic bag by the 
side of their plates, an invitation to them to 
take away anything left over when they have 
eaten enough, to be shared with those who 
could not be present. 
Many peoples—the Mbuti of the former 
Zaire, the Canadian Cree and Inuit, the Batck 
of Malaysia and the Nayaka of southern India, 
to name but a few—are ignorant of the West- 
ern dichotomy between nature and nurture. In 
many cases, they see their relationship with

### 110429: Making a little go a long way

Making a little 
go a long way 
BY BABACAR SALL 
Needy African societies governed by an ethic 
of sparing, caring and sharing 
~ In some parts of Africa frugality is a 
_ quality thatis central to social and eco- 
nomic life, partly because poverty has become 
so taken for granted in recent years. The Wolof 
language has an expression for it: doy lu, which 
may be translated as self-sufficiency. 
Society is built around the idea of potential 
scarcity, and sharing and solidarity are highly 
regarded. Seeking personal profit is frowned 
on. Building up your own stock of something 
means taking away from the group a resource 
which it could otherwise use. This has given 
rise to an ethic of parsimony and sharing. 
Drinking, eating, spending and having a 
good time should be done on the basis of 
“keep nothing for yourself which could be 
useful to someone else”, to quote a Wolof 
saying. Keeping a share of something for some- 
one else is seen as a way to avoid excess.

lian nomads such as the Peul even in a situation 
of abundance. Housing is spartan, light and 
made of casy-to-dismantle vegetable matter. 
The basic diet consists of dairy products. 
Above all, water is using very sparingly. 
Another Wolof proverb—*“tomorrow isn’t 
today’s guest, but we must put something aside 
for it”—shows how far saving, forced on peo- 
ple by an unpredictable food supply, is rooted 
in people’s mentalities. Excessive consumption 
upsets the future sharing of a product. Most 
Senegalese believe God does not give things but 
entrusts them to a person’s care. In return, peo- 
plecarefully look after what does not belong to 
them but which they are given to share.

In Mali, a Dogon farmer 
sprinkles his field with water 
during the dry season. Such sharing, essential when there is per- 
petual scarcity, governs all social activities— 
work, income, joy and unhappiness. But this 
modern-day harmony only works because of 
its ties to a traditional solidarity.

Drought in the 1970s and the widespread

The Malian village of Sanankoroba, which 
is usually held up as an economic develop- 
ment success story, shows how a mixture of 
local organization and modern equipment can 
have good and lasting results. 
The villagers launched a development pro- 
ject along their own lines in 1984 with the 
help of a twinning agreement with the Quebec 
town of St. Elizabeth. Instead of foreigners 
taking the decisions, the villagers used their 
own methods. Public meetings were held and 
the supreme tribal authority, the council of 
elders, was consulted. The council decided to 
extend the decision-making process to other 
age-groups, which served as links to different

tribes and to associations of women, young 
people and professionals. The council then 
gave its opinion and decided how the project 
should be carried out. 
The 24-member committee that was setup 
contained two new elements—it had five 
women on it and a local farmer as its chairman, 
despite the participation of people who had 
been trained in developed countries. This break 
with the classic pattern of development aid 
organization shows a determination to adapt to 
local physical conditions. Also, rather than tak- 
ing the name given to the project by the Que- 
beckers—“Des mains pour demain,” or “Hands 
for the Future” —the villagers chose a name 
closer to their way of thinking: Benkadi, or 
“good understanding”. This name stressed that 
the project’s goal is unity and social cohesion 
rather than transformation and planning, as 
conveyed by the Canadians’ name.

A technical adviser (right) and

So there were two ways of looking at the 
project. The Western approach was to shape 
the future by technical mastery of time and 
space, based on the belief that agricultural 
problems are essentially technical and can be 
solved by technical means. The African 
approach did not systematically take on board 
such a concept, since it regards the future as 
God’s responsibility, so that the relationship 
between technical power and divine power 
requires careful handling. 
These different ways of thinking did not 
prevent fruitful co-operation. The main thing 
for the villagers of Sanankoroba was to express 
their own values in a productive manner with 
foreign help, and they managed to do that very 
well. The project led to better integration of 
several usually dependent social categories such 
as young people, women and lower classes. It 
also checked emigration to the capital, Bamako,

and the newly-irrigated fields and bountiful 
orchards even lured many back to the village. 
Street schools 
Another example, this time involving educa- 
tion, shows that consumption of knowledge, 
like consumption of anything clse, requires 
that the product offered be carefully chosen 
and adapted to immediate needs. 
In Senegal, non-attendance at school, which 
mostly affects country areas, has spread to the 
towns, with nearly 40 per cent of school-age 
children not attending. A system set up by 
the government to tackle the problem in pri- 
mary schools in poor areas—a half-day of 
lessons daily, with some children coming in 
the morning and others in the afternoon— 
has proved inadequate. 
The situation has given rise to the creation of 
“street schools”, mostly in Dakar, with impro- 
vised classes in the street or in the yard of a house 
and plain wooden benches. The many children 
who attend these schools show how popular 
they are, especially as the fees are modest. Among 
the subjects taught are human rights, theatre, 
Arab language and environmental education. 
One basic difference from the state schools is 
that classes are usually in the children’s mother 
tongue rather than French. Another is that the

“street schools” meet the general demand for 
children to be taught not in a selective way but 
by giving them the basic knowledge to cope 
with the society they live in. 
The same kind of priorities, springing 
from constant scarcity and structural ineffi- 
ciency, apply in the economic and financial 
sphere. This has led to rival mail distribution 
networks and even banking services—mainly 
between African states and European coun- 
tries with immigrant populations, like France. 
They are run on non-capitalist principles such 
as trust and personal and blood relationships. 
The “banks for the poor” arc another example 
of adapting a consumer-oriented capitalist sys- 
tem to local conditions where modest con- 
sumption patterns are the rule. 
All these initiatives, carried out in condi- 
tions of scarcity, poverty and sometimes suffi- 
ciency but never abundance, show that even 
needy people can build community projects 
with what they have. In this way the link-up 
between frugality, economy and society leads 
to anew work cthicand gives an example to the 
world at a time of increasing breakdown of social 
ties and environmental degradation. Perhaps the 
ball is now in the rich countries’ court... HN

THE UNESCO Courier B JANUARY 1958 
~ Doubts are now being raised about the 
© aura—almost of majesty—that sur- 
rounds motor vehicles, which, despite being 
too noisy and too big and guzzling too much 
energy, have long been regarded as symbols of 
national cconomic success and individual sta- 
tus. Since the 1992 Rio Conference and the 
cries of alarm that went up from the scientific 
community about threats to the stability of 
the earth’s ecosystem, transport policies and 
especially policies in regard to the car have been 
under fire from all sides. 
Bicycles have scized this opportunity to 
go on to the offensive. Fifty times lighter than 
cars, they have plenty going for them. They arc 
non-polluting, nifty, silent and healthy. The 
number of cars in circulation worldwide will 
reach the billion mark in twenty-five years or 
even less, and this at a time of climate change. 
A certain measure of self-restraint in terms of 
individual mobility is thus an essential pre- 
caution to be taken to preserve the environ- 
ment, and in fact more and more city-dwellers 
want to live in conditions of less pollution 
and stress. Cycles, especially when taken in 
conjunction with public transport, scem to 
provide an answer to this new-found aspira- 
tion to win back the streets and public places 
from colonization by the car. 
In Amsterdam in March 1994, the Euro-

to which sixty towns, including Aosta, 
Athens, Barcelona, Bremen, Granada, Gronin-

mote policies for sustainable development, 
encourage a gradual reduction in the use of 
private cars in towns, and serve as an interna-

The best results achieved so far have beenin 
Copenhagen, where bicycles are regarded as a 
means of transport in the full sense of the 
term, and account for 33 per cent of jour- 
neys—a share equal to that of public trans- 
port and private motor vehicles. Although, 
admittedly, the local terrain lends itself to this 
mode of locomotion, it should be pointed 
out that the climate—the wind in particular— 
is a considerable disincentive, which never- 
theless does nothing to discourage the towns- 
people. One of the reasons for the bike’s 
success is the fact that there is an almost unbro- 
ken network of cycle lanes along the streets 
and the main thoroughfares. Since 1962, the 
policy has been to reduce the number of park- 
ing spaces for cars, often to make way for cycle 
lanes, with the result that motor traffic has 
gone down by 10 per cent since 1970. 
Cycles are small machines that have had a 
big impact all over the world with people of 
all ages, male and female, rich and poor. In

their quiet way they have helped to shape the 
modern world. In the Western countries, at 
the turn of this century workers were using 
them to get to work, and in this way, while 
themselves being an important industrial 
product, they contributed to the process of 
industrialization and to countries’ economic 
prosperity.

wind of freedom blew through people’s pat- 
terns of behaviour. Weekends in the country 
began with the bicycle and, when youth hos- 
tels first appeared in the early 1930s, so did a 
new form of tourism, the cycling holiday. The 
New Woman on her bicycle became an emblem 
of emancipation, so potent that when under- 
graduates at Cambridge (U.K.) protested in 
1897 against the admission of women they 
hanged a bicycling woman in effigy. 
Pedal power is of great importance in the 
developing countries, enabling doctors to get 
around quickly in wartime in Nicaragua, 
allowing foodstuffs to be moved from one

dominicales. In China, where there are over 
400 million cycles—nearly as many as there 
arc cars in the world!—over 80 per cent of indi- 
vidual journeys are made this way. 
Less calories per kilometre 
For use in town, cycles compare very 
favourably in many respects with other means 
of transport. 
Efficiency: the modern bike has the high- 
est ratio of distance covered to energy input of 
any means of transport; at an average speed of 
17 km an hour, a cyclist uses between three 
and four times less encrgy per kilometre than 
a pedestrian; 
Resources: Marcia Lowe, of the World- 
watch Institute in Washington, has calculated 
that it takes a hundred times less raw material 
and energy to make a cycle than it does to 
make acar; 
Health: a British Medical Association 
report published in 1992 pointed out that 
cycling is one of the simplest and most effec- 
tive ways of keeping fit; 
Cost: the cost of creating a cycle track in 
Britain is anything from 67 to 230 times less 
per mile than that of building a road, and even 
the most expensive bike will always be far 
more affordable than a car. 
Cycling to a healthier world 
Some commentators state categorically that 
sustainable development is not feasible without 
multimodal mobility combining public trans- 
portand two-wheelers. The irony of the situ- 
ation is that just when the industrialized coun- 
tries are starting to realize the virtues of the 
velocipede, some of the developing countries are 
trying to clear them off the streets, believing

The modern bike: 
a blend of hi-tech 
and simplicity 
Advanced technologies can now 
be integrated into bicycles ina 
way that can revolutionize their 
use. In 1994, a Japanese firm 
launched a bike with a small electric 
motor and two sensors which calculate the cyclist's effort and his or her 
speed. A built-in microcomputer then works out the extra power to be supplied to 
the pedal-wheel in order to maximize the rider’s performance, e.g. when setting off, 
on a gradient or with a head wind—inconveniences that put many people off as soon 
The Dutch engineer Alan Lentz has developed another Interesting innovation, a 
solar-powered trailer. The prototype won first prize in the 1993 Dutch Solar Bike 
Design Competition, which rewards the best suggestions for the combined use of 
solar power and the bicycle. A solar panel connected to a battery is built into the lid 
of the trailer and powers a small electric motor that drives the hub. The power 
generated is enough to propel the loaded trailer and can even push the bike. For 
campers, the battery can supply power for lights, radio, electric razor or any other 
An impressive range of increasingly practical accessories is now available. 
Furthermore, the one-hour speed record held by the “horizontal” cycle—so called 
because the rider is in a lying position with his feet up in front of him and back 
arched—is 77 kilometres, as against 55 kilometres for a conventional machine. The 
horizontal cycle was invented at the beginning of the century and broke a number of 
speed records, but was banned from international competitions in 1934—because it 
was so efficient it enabled lower-rated riders to beat competitors riding conventional 
machines! Fortunately, since the 1970s associations for the promotion of human- 
powered vehicles in the United States and Europe have revived the horizontal bike. 
The back support given by the seat increases the power of propulsion and makes 
such bikes much more comfortable.

This begs the question as to what “moder- 
nity” means today. Shouldn’t we be standing 
up for the idea of “cyclomodernity”, using 
the bicycle to treat the planets ills? It has been 
reckoned that by the year 2005, more than 
half the world’s population will be living in 
towns and cities, and that by 2025 the num- 
ber of city-dwellers will have doubled to five 
billion. At the same time, the worldwide pro- 
liferation of cars has resulted in the “auto- 
mobile phenomenon” becoming almost co- 
extensive with what Pierre Teilhard de Chardin 
called the “human phenomenon”. In these cir- 
cumstances, bikes come to symbolize a simple 
life attuned to the limitations of our bio- 
sphere and responding to the new demands 
from a growing number of city-dwellers for 
a less motorized environment. |

### 110431: Fact file: youth finds use for waste

FACT FILE 
Youth finds use 
for waste 
I n 1994 UNESCO’s Division of Youth and Sports Activ- 
ities conducted a survey on youth, recycling and devel- 
opment involving 120 youth organizations worldwide 
with members aged 25 or younger. Contrary to the 
widely held belief that young people who have grown up 
ina world bombarded with new products and advertis- 
ing are trapped in a consumer culture, the survey showed 
that many young people in both industrialized and 
developing countries are taking part in a range of inven- 
tive recycling schemes whose objectives include waste 
reduction, environmental education, reconsideration of 
current development patterns, job creation for young 
people and the socially disadvantaged, and international 
co-operation. Their common denominator is that they 
all find a use for what is normally regarded as “waste”. 
The survey gave rise to a UNESCO programme, 
“Youth and Recycling for Sustainable Development”, 
which held a World Forum in Nagoya (Japan) from 7 to 
12 March 1996 attended by young people from 14 coun- 
tries who swapped ideas and experiences. A number of 
practical initiatives were described, including a recycling 
programme by the Tumi Tugetha youth group (“You

who recover non-ferrous scrap metal and process it for 
export. Another project in Pakwach (Uganda) employs 
youngsters to collect scrap metal and use it to make 
hammers, chisels and other tools. 
Other schemes are based on North-South co-oper- 
ation. A group of young people in France are running a 
“Bicycles for Africa” programme, whereby discarded 
bicycles arc collected and shipped to a partner group in 
Burkina Faso, where they are repaired and sold cheaply. 
The German Association for the Promotion of Training 
and Employment (GAB) collects and reconditions used 
hospital equipment, household appliances and tools and 
sends them to Africa and Eastern Europe. A joint Cana- 
dian-Filipino scheme called Race Against Waste orga- 
nizes a competition to make toys from waste in order to 
raise awareness of environmental issues in hundreds of 
schools in Canada and the Philippines. 
The Nagoya Statement signed by participants at the 
Forum, “Make Haste Against Waste” (sce page 35), rec- 
ognizes the value of recycling initiatives taken by young 
people all over the world and identifies some of the 
obstacles they have encountered. It emphasizes that recy- 
cling is not an end in itself but a tool in the service of sus- 
tainable development, and calls on educators, NGOs, 
the media, artists, consumer groups, businesses, gov- 
ernments and United Nations agencies to support recy- 
cling in policy and practice. 
Results of the Forum include the development of the 
international network of youth recycling groups, the 
promotion of their activities in the media and the exten- 
sive distribution of the Forum Report. A quarterly 
newsletter, YARN (Youth and Recycling Newsletter), 
was started to serve as a link between the informal group 
network. Many Forum participants have been commu- 
nicating with each other and new groups have been join- 
ing the network. Many new partners have received con- 
tainers filled with tools, sewing machines and bicycles.

for rescarch designed to set the activities of young recy- 
clers into an ethical and historical context. A CD-Roms

among secondary school students. 
These activities are being carried out by schoo! science and technology clubs. 
They give students the opportunity to learn more about the environment, broaden

als at very low prices.

» - 
(Excerpts) 
Young people all over the world are tak- 
ing initiatives to recycle at the local, 
national and international levels. In both 
developed and developing countries, and 
sometimes Involving these countries in 
innovative partnerships, these youth ini- 
tiatives: 
« are genuinely useful, productive and 
of direct value to people and the environ- 
ment; 
« bring immediate economic returns 
by providing jobs and increasing income, 
particularly of young people; and by gen- 
erating useful products and resources; 
«mobilize young people with various 
abilities, educate and develop both tech- 
nical and social skills that enhance con- 
viviality and young people’s integration 
into the community; 
« promote partnerships in furtherance 
of international co-operation for social jus- 
tice, equity and development; 
«are drawn from or in Some cases actu- 
ally revive indigenous knowledge systems 
and orient young people towards sustain- 
able practices and lifestyles. . .. 
In order to be holistic and effective, recy- 
cling should be: 
« economically viable, enhancing the 
economic standing of those involved and 
opening up the possibility of developing 
Development (1996) 
local/domestic production, thereby reduc- 
ing imports. 
«promoting social justice by addressing 
the disparities between developed and 
developing countries; 
« engendering values of stewardship, 
community and responsible lifestyles; 
« ysing safe and appropriate technol 
ogy and encouraging innovation; 
«showing gender, generational and cul- 
tural sensitivity by enhancing the partici- 
pation of disadvantaged and marginalized 
groups in all stages of recycling. . . . 
We, the participants in this Forum, 
commit ourselves to: 
« strengthening our institutions and our 
recycling for sustainable development 
efforts with a view to achieving self- 
reliance; 
« continuing to communicate and co- 
operate with each other; sharing tech- 
nologies, models and information; and 
evolving new forms of collaboration involv- 
ing developed and developing countries; 
« evolving, committing to and propa- 
gating a Code of Ethics on recycling for 
sustainable development; 
& Linking up with other sectors involved 
in research and development; 
«doing all these things in the convivial 
spirit of “lumi Tugetha” (the name in pid- 
gin of a Papua New Guinea youth recycling 
scheme). 
Abandoned bikes become ‘feet of life’ 
In Japan many bicycles are abandoned, and loca! authorities have a hard time cop- 
ing with the problem. 
A project to donate these bicycles to other countries has been launched by 
MCCOBA (Municipal Co-ordinating Committee for Overseas Bicycle Assistance) and 
JOICFP (Japanese Organization for International Co-operation in Family Planning 
Inc.). The former, a consortium of 15 local authorities, supplies the bikes, while the 
latter is in charge of accepting them in recipient countries. 
Once collected by MCCOBA, the bicycles are recycled and either sold to local 
residents or donated overseas. To date, 17,350 recycled bikes have been shipped 
free of charge to 41 countries via JOICFP and other projects, with transportation 
costs financed by local authorities. 
JOICFP, which is engaged in village development activities in developing coun- 
tries, is the project co-ordinator. Recycled bikes are given to villagers who have 
received traning in family planning and health care. Bicycles are used as a means 
of communication and to transport food in remote areas. In Tanzania they are 
known as the “feet of life”. An umbrella, a knapsack and boots are provided with 
each bicycle for the rainy season.   
In Mozambique farm and health workers 
get around on mountain bikes. 
  
n n 
Bicycles for Africa 
In Burkina Faso, the bicycle 1s nicknamed “the iron horse” and is an 
important means of transportation. In recent years, however, the 
price of a new bicycle has soared 500 per cent, putting it on a par 
with a rural family’s annual income. 
In France on the other hand bicycles are discarded by the thou 
sands. In the Chambéry area alone—Chambéry 1s a sister city to 
Ouahigouya in Burkina Faso—1,000 bicycles are discarded every year. 
Young people in Chambéry have taken to collecting them from tips, retail 
ers and police stations and sending them to Quahigouya, where they 
are sold to local people for one-third of the price of a new bicycle. 
In Burkina Faso the bicycles are dismantled, repaired and reassem- 
bled. This work is performed by persons with physical disabilities, 
unemployed persons and those on the margins of society. This pro- 
gramme has been useful In creating jobs and in fostering self-reliance. 
More than 3,000 bicycles have been collected over the past few years. 
Future goals include improving the system for sorting bicycles in 
France, increasing the qualifications of African workers and obtaining 
cheaper spare parts.

Let us cast our minds back to the world situation as it was 
in 1945. In that fateful year the North was in ruins and 
a sombre post-war mood prevailed. In the South, the 
struggle to achieve freedom from colonial domination 
was already under way, and in many cases a pre-war 
atmosphere reigned. The founders of UnEsco decided to 
confront this civilization of weapons with the weapons of 
civilization. They took inspiration from the radiantly sim- 
ple idea of constructing peace in the minds of men 
through education, science, culture and the free flow of 
ideas—in short by communication, 
In the prophetie words of the French poet Paul Valéry, 
they intended to build a “league of minds” as well as a 
League of Nations. At the same time they were deter- 
mined that this international fornm should serve the eth- 
ical goals which the world community set for itself: peace, 
the intellectual and moral solidarity of humanity and its 
common prosperity, freedom and justice. 
As the intellectual institution of the United Nations 
system, UNESCO has heen entrusted ever sinee its incep- 
tion with an ethical mission. In this capacity, it must con- 
demn wrongs, whatever their origin, wherever they occur 
and whatever form they take. UNESCO must have the 
courage to raise its voice and take action. It must not 
allow itself to tolerate the intolerable. To niy mind this mis- 
sion is today more timely and urgent than ever. UNESCO 
can and must make its presence felt in the world—by 
the force of ideas and above all by setting an example. 
In less than three years’ time, the world will enter 
the third millenninm. It is now, when the twenty-first 
century is already knocking on UNESCO’s door that we 
must think about the Organizations future shape, UNESCO

### 110432: Sharing: an ethic for the future

Sharing—an ethic 
for the future 
will become increasingly forward-looking, because the 
Internet, the protection of the human genome, the increas- 
ing development of what Néstor Gareia Canelini has 
called “hybrid eultures”, the rapid emergence of “virtual 
cultures”, lifelong education for adults and the revolu- 
tion in the efficient use of environmental and cnergy 
resources are all 2Ist-century issues. 
Development is now in jeopardy. We cannot close our 
cyes to poverty and indebtedness, exclusion and diserim- 
ination, non-stop degradation of the environment, exploita- 
tion, persecution and marginalization affecting whole pop- 
ulations—especially indigenous populations—the scandal 
of faminc, illiteracy, intolerance, violcnee, war, soeial 
instability and even—after racial apartheid—the threat 
of social and urban apartheid, which is gradually under- 
mining the foundations of democracy. On no account 
should we bequeath to posterity this grievous legacy. 
Can we accept the fact that almost one-third of the 
population of the least developed countries die before the 
age of forty or that 20 per cent of the inhabitants of the 
planet shave 1.1 per cent of world income? As Mr. James 
Wolfensohn, the President of the World Bank, recently 
pointed out, there can be no satisfactory economic devel- 
opment withont parallel social development. 
The answer to the challenge of poverty is contingent 
upon sharing, whieh is to my mind the mainspring of 
UNESCO's mission. The duty to share is but another form 
of the duty of solidarity, that “inteHectnal and moral sol- 
idarity” of humanity which is the only possible basis for 
a true and lasting peace. 
We must share in tine as well as in space. Onr duty 
is to think of future generations. What do we want to 
pass on to our children? The prospect of a better future, 
or chronic poverty? Opportunities for all, or hardship

for a quarter or even a third of humanity? A living envi- 
ronment, or a planet without a future? 
An ethical approach to the future must recognize the 
vital responsibility of today’s generations towards future 
generations. Itis now that we must lay the foundations of 
this ethic if we wish to build the peaceful conditions nee- 
essary for development in the next century. At a time 
when people all over the world are acting as though 
they had rights over the people of tomorrow we are start- 
ing to realize that we arc compromising the full exercise 
of human rights hy future generations. lence the estal-

Hence the Deelaration ou the Protection of the Human

a genuine worldwide awareness that could lead to prae-

But above all we must dare to love. Today's biggest

by Plutarchos Theocharides 
Ten centuries of uninterrupted creative effort shaped the 
architecture and art treasures of Mount Athos, which was 
placed on the World Heritage List in 1988. 
Mount Athos, a rocky head- 
land soaring 2,000 metres 
out of the Aegean Sea, is the most 
easterly of the three promontories 
of the Greek peninsula of 
Chalkidiki. The peninsula’s rugged 
terrain and inhospitable coastline 
make settlement and communica- 
tions on it extremely difficult. 
There is evidence that five towns 
existed there in Antiquity, but 
later, after the destruction and rav- 
ages of the early Middle Ages, the 
site appears to have attracted only 
anchorites and monks. 
The origins of monastic life on 
ft 
  
Athos are lostin legend. The ear- 
liest historical sources attesting 
to the presence of a solid religious 
structure date from the ninth cen- 
tury. At that time the monks lived 
ascctic lives in isolated huts or 
Eellia that were in many cases 
interconnected to form small 
monastic communities or lavras. 
There also seems to have been a 
rudimentary form of central orga- 
nization, perhaps not unlike the 
monastic republic that developed 
later. But cenobitic monasteries 
(where the monks have everything 
in common) were only found out- 
side the peninsula in the nearby 
inhabited regions. 
The first cenobitic monastery 
on Athos (the Great Lavra) was 
the 
Athonite in 963 and was soon fol- 
founded by Athanasius 
lowed by others. By the middle of 
the eleventh century there were 
no less than 200 “monasteries”, 
but numbers fluctuated eonsider- 
ably during the Byzantine period, 
and it was only under the Ottoman 
occupation that the numbers and 
types of monasteries on Mount 
Athos stabilized into more or less 
their When

number. During the same period, 
the kellia, some of which replaced 
defunct monastic communities, 
gradually came under the control 
of the twenty monasteries. At the 
end of the seventeenth century, 
shetes—large communities depen- 
dent on the monasteries—were 
founded. The first of these foun- 
dations were “idiorrhythmie” 
(cach monk living at his own 
thythm); later ones were cenobitice. 
Throughout their history, both 
under the Byzantine and Ottoman 
Empires, the large monasteries 
wielded exceptional economic 
power and enjoyed a privileged 
position. Their main sonrces of 
wealth were the exploitation of 
large estates (metochia), dona- 
tions received from sovereigns and 
other prominent people and, in 
later times, from zeteies (long- 
term fund-raising trips) made by 
monks to the Orthodox countries 
where Athos always exercised 
great spiritual influence. 
These spiritual and material 
factors had important reperecus- 
sions on building activity on Mount 
Athos. 
reflects architectural ambition and 
Athonite architecture 
a diversity of influenees-—the latter 
being particularly apparent in the 
later (eighteenth-twentieth cen- 
tury) buildings. This marriage of 
different cultural and arehitec- 
tural inputs and the use of crafts- 
men from different regions gave 
rise to organie building complexes 
which served as prototypes for 
other Orthodox countries. After 
the fall of Constantinople in 1453 
and the Ottoman dissolution of the 
Byzantine empire, Mount Athos, 
which was directly subject to the 
Patriarch of Constantinople, 
became one of the nost important 
centres of artistic activity in the 
Orthodox world and perhaps its 
leading architectural eentre. 
In thelate fourteenth century, 
Mount Athos entered a period of 
cconomijc depression which lasted 
until the end of the fifteenth cen- 
tury and, for some monasteries, 
until the early sixteenth. The pop- 
ulation, which in its two great peri- 
ods of expansion (the eleventh and 
fourteenth eenturies) is reckoned 
to have numbered about 6,000 and 
4,000 monks respectively, proba- 
bly fell to around 1,500. But as 
the fifteenth century came to a 
close, a new period of activity 
began with the renovation of build- 
ings, the construction of imposing 
fortifications and the extension of 
the enclosures in some monasteries. 
This activity came to an end at 
the beginning of the seventeenth 
century, when Mount Athos again 
gradually sank into decline, this 
time until the mid-eighteenth cen- 
tury. From the second half of the 
eighteenth century until the Greek 
War of Independence of 1821, 
there was a renaissance during 
which some of the idiorthythmic 
monasteries converted to the ceno- 
bitic way of life. New construction 
work continued until the end of 
the nincteenth century, and the 
main architectural imprint on 
Mount Athos today is that of the 
eighteenth and nineteenth cen- 
turies. From 1850 on, Russian 
monks flocked to the peninsula, 
bringing with them an entirely dif- 
ferent kind of architecture. At the 
turn of the century construction 
activity agaiu slackened and was 
then interrupted by the First 
World War, Mount Athos {ell hack

### 110435: The Garden of the Virgin

THE GARDEN 
OF THE VIRGIN 
by Christine Quenon 
According to legend, after the Res- 
urrcetion, the Virgin Mary and St. 
John the Evangelist set sail for 
Cyprus to visit Lazarus. During the 
voyage they were caught in a violent 
storm and their ship was cast onto 
the eastern shore of Mount Athos. 
Captivated by the beauty of the 
plaee, Mary prayed to her son and 
asked him to grant her sovereignty 
over the mountain. A heavenly voice 
replied, saying, “May this place be 
yours, may it be your garden and 
your paradise and a haven of peace 
for all those who seek salvation.” 
This is why the monks called Mount 
Athos “The Garden of the Virgin”, 
and the Greeks called it “Hagios 
Oros”—the “Holy Mountain”. 
In the Middle Ages a charter 
issucd by the Byzantine emperor 
defined the rules of monastic life, 
which have changed little sinee 
then. The Virgin Mary is the only

female presence. Only men are 
allowed to live on the oly Moun- 
tain. Since the 1920s, Monnt Athos 
has been a theocratic republic 
which enjoys a certain amount of 
autonomy within the Greek state. It 
is comprised of twenty monaster- 
ics. This nnmber is immutable, 
CHURCHES, TREASURES AND 
LIBRARIES 
The monasteries of Mount Athos are 
usually girdled by a fortified outer 
wall. Each one has a central church, 
or katholikon—in many cases a 
medieval Byzantine chureh painted 
red on the outside and surronnded 
by dependencies. The interior of the 
chureh, as at Vatopedi monastery, is 
decorated with frescoes, icons and 
mosaics. The monastery nsually 
houses a treasury which the monks 
are reluetant to show visitors and 
which nay contain reliquaries, icons 
and cult objects like the 14th-cen- 
tury jasper, silver gilt and enamel 
chaliee, a masterpiece of Byzantine 
craftsmanship, preserved at Vato- 
pedi Monastery, and Emperor 
Nicephorus II Phoeas’s vestments, 
whieh are kept in one of the penin- 
sula’s most beautiful monasteries, 
the Great Lavra. The monastie 
libraries are often rich in ancient man- 
useripts, some dating from the 4th 
century. The Great Lavralibrary, for 
example, contains more than 2,000 
manuscripts and 5,000 volumes. 
To fully appreciate the beauty 
of these monasteries, which blend 
harmoniously into the beantifully 
preserved landscape, it is best to 
approach them from the sea. Some, 
like the monasteries of St. Grego- 
riou, Vatopedi and St. Panteleimon, 
are located on the shore. Others, like 
Dionysiou, the Great Lavra, St. Paul 
and Simonopetra, perch on hilltops or 
rocky onterops. With its jumble of 
roofs, towers, hell-towers and erenel- 
lations each monastery is a village. 
Small white buildings with wooden 
balconies cling to high, monumental 
walls. 
A PLACE 
OF SANCTUARY 
The monasteries are divided into two 
groups. In the eenobitic monaster- 
ies, governed by a single rule, every- 
thing is done in common: the monks 
live under the same roof, join in the 
same prayers throughont the day 
and night, share meals and work, and 
have no personal possessions. In what 
are known as “idiorthy thmic” monas- 
teries each monk lives at his “own 
thythin”, owns his own cell, is not 
obliged to do any communal work 
and can freely use any income he 
may have. For the monks in these 
monasteries sharing is limited to liv- 
ing under the same roof and attend- 
ing certain services together. 
Other forms of religions life on 
Mount Athos fall outside these two 
major categories and include 
anchorites, hermits who live alone in 
secluded cells or in groups of two or 
three in remote houses with their 
own chapels, and gyrovagues—itin- 
erant, mendicant monks, 
The Athonite monks use the 
Julian calendar, and their day 
begins at sunset, not midnight. The 
hell that signals the start of a day of 
prayer and work is tolled at one 
o’clock in the morning. 
The monks come from all over the 
Orthodox world. After a period of 
decadenee, monastic life is today 
experiencing a renaissanee and 
attraeting new vocations. The 
Atlionite sehool is also open to young 
men who do not wish to make a life- 
long commitment to the monastic life. 
Many of the monasteries are under- 
going major restoration work. The 
monks and anchorites who live in this 
sanctuary are keeping alive the con- 
temnplative tradition of the Orthodox 
Chureh. |

Some of the masterpieces of Byzantine and 
post-Byzantine sacred art housed in the 
monasteries of Mount Athos were publicly 
displayed for the first time at a recent exhi- 
bition held in Thessaloniki {Greece). The 
exhibition, entitled The Treasures of Mount 
Athos, was organized jointly by the Holy 
Community of Mount Athos and the Orga- 
nization for the Cultural Capital of Europe 
Thessaloniki 1997. It was held at Thessa- 
loniki's Museum of Byzantine Culture from 
21 June to 31 December 1997. 
The exhibition, whose unifying theme 
was the spirituality that informs all aspects 
of life on Mount Athos, was divided into four 
sections: natural environment, architecture, 
daily life and worship, and—the centrepiece 
of the show—the treasures of the monastic 
heritage. On display was an exceptional col- 
lection of sacred art objects and other pieces 
{1,500 in all) selected from among those 
accumulated by the monastic community 
over the centuries in the fields of architec- 
ture, sculpture and, most especially, paint- 
ing and the minor arts: icons {fixed and 
portable), mosaics, fragments of frescoes, 
silverwork, stone and wood carving, embroi- 
dery, ceramics, illuminated manuscripts, 
chrysobulls {edicts issued by the Byzantine 
emperors), archive documents and rare 
books. |

### 110436: Cities: residents to the rescue

 
GREENWATCH Cities: 
residents to 
| the rescue 
BY FRANCE BEQUETTE 
In the next ten years, the 
number of people living in 
cities will rise to around 3.3 bil- 
lion. Tokyo already las a popula- 
tion of 27 million, Sdo Paulo 
(Brazil) 16.4 million, and Bombay 
15 million. World Bank forecasts 
show as much as 80 per cent of 
the developing countries’ economie 
growth occurring in the cities and 
major conurbations. 
There are both positive and neg- 
ative aspects to these developinents. 
As the Organization for Economie 
Co-operation and Development 
(OECD) points outin a recent study 
on Innovative policies for sustain- 
able urban development, “At each 
  
THE UNESCO Courier B JANUARY 1998 
stage in the history of urbanisation, 
environmental conditions in cities 
were improved dramatically. The 
process was often slow, hut over 
time, many epidemic diseases have 
been controlled, the supply of clean 
water and the removal of wastes 
have become routine, the risks of 
fire have been contained, and stan- 
dards of comfort and cleanliness 
haverisen to unprecedented levels. 
Cities could not have hecome as 
large and as numerous as they are 
now if environmental conditions had 
remained unchanged.” 
In a curious way, the pollution 
that cities suffer is largely due to 
their wealth. The rich consume a 
great deal more energy, water, 
building materials and other goods 
than the poor, and thus produce 
much more waste. This is what is 
happening, for example, in the 
cities in south-east Asia and Latin 
America where rapid industrial- 
ization is taking place—only the 
rich enjoy the benefits of piped 
water and refuse collection. 
INCREASINGLY 
INSANITARY 
CONDITIONS 
There is another, often tragic, 
aspect to this situation. The poor- 
est of the poor are reduced to liv- 
ing in outer-edge shantytowns in 
extremely insanitary eonditions 
and, lacking the resources to deal 
with the problem, the city as a 
whole has to endure eongestion and 
air and water pollution. In Africa, 
where some towns and cities are 
expanding at a rate of over 7 per 
cent a year, municipal sanitation 
departments are no longer able to 
cope, and it is estimated that as 
 
many as 30 per cent of the popu- 
lation are without running water. 
According to a remarkable 
report that was published recentlyl, 
in many of the world’s major cities 
runaway population growth, an epi- 
demic of Aids and rising social ten- 
sions have been combined in the last 
few years with a steep drop in 
incomes. The population living on 
the outer edges of the cities con- 
tinues to grow apace, hundreds of 
thousands of people are without 
running water and 15 per cent of 
them without sanitation of any sort. 
Various voluntary bodies and 
non-governmental organizations 
have got together, often success- 
fully, to work out solutions. In 
Abidjan, an original refuse-collec- 
tion scheme has resulted in the 
scashore being cleared of rubbish 
and has also given regular employ- 
ment to hundreds of people. Sim- 
ilar schemes have been initiated in 
Nairobi, Acera and Ndola (Zam- 
bia), where small-scale enterprises 
producing bricks have been set up, 
thus not only providing their

arefuse reeycling project in Ilanoi

problem is, however, that these 
informal activities are much less 
well paid than “traditional” jobs. 
In the thirteen countries studied in 
the report, the average income in 
the parallel economy was well 
below the official poverty line. 
WATER AND THE 
ENVIRONMENTAL CRISIS 
One key problem eoncerns the avail- 
ability of clean water. Some progress 
hasbeen achieved as a result of the 
International Drinking Water Supply 
and Sanitation Decade, but in 1994 
at least 220 million people still 
lacked a source of drinking water 
near their homes. In some cases, 
communities of 500 or more inhab- 
itants are served hy a single tap. In 
some towns, communal taps func- 
tion for only a few hours a day, so 
that people cannot build up suffi- 
cient reserves of water for their per- 
sonal needs if it takes too long to 
fetch or if the water has to be car- 
ried long distances. 
As there are no proper sanitation 
measures, the disadvantaged mem-

bers of the population have to drink 
dirty water, fishin polluted streams, 
and eat vegetables that have been 
grown by the side of refuse tips. 
A further major problem arises 
from the threefold harmful impact 
of cities on the environment: urban 
development on agricultural land, 
the extraetion and exhaustion of 
natural resources, and the dumping 
of refuse. The area covered by 
downtown Sido Paulo has grown in 
fifty years from 180 sq km to more 
than 900 sq km, while that of 
greater Sdo Paule now stands at an 
incredible 8,000 s¢ km! The pro- 
ductive areas—of land or water— 
from whieh food for the eities 
comes are gradually vanishing. 
Growing pressure on coastal 
regions, where nearly a billion peo- 
ple now live, is doing serious dam- 
age to the marine environment. 
Development activities pose a 
threat to nearly half the world’s 
coasts. In the diminutive island 
state of Singapore, for example, 
land is in such short supply that 
6,000 hectarcs have 
reclaimed from the sea, increasing 
the land area by 10 per cent in rela- 
tion to what it was thirty years ago. 
Ahundred and fifty years of recla- 
mation along San Francisco Bay, 
the most densely built-up estuary 
in the United States, have reduced 
the area of the bay by a third. 
RESIDENTS TAKE THINGS IN 
HAND 
The report on the urban environ- 
Leen 
ment gives many examples of local 
schemes being launched, in both 
developed and developing coun- 
tries, to keep these harmful 
effects in check. 
The city of Graz (Austria) had 
anidea for reducing pollution from 
automobile and machine produc- 
tion, footwear manufacturing and 
brewing. A partnership was estal- 
lished with the Chemical Engi- 
neering Institute of the city’s Uni- 
versity of Technology, allowing the 
companies concerned to sct up a 
project team to develop a eleaner 
production programme. In six years, 
not only was the volume of toxic and 
solid wastes reduced by 50 per 
cent, but production costs also fell, 
in some cases by 60 per cent. 
Cajamarca (Peru) is one of the 
world’s poorest cities, with a sul)- 
stantial infant mortality rate. The 
river Kilish, from which most of 
the population get their drinking 
water, is seriously polluted. The 
provincial authorities devolved 
some of their powers on to neigh- 
bourhood councils in the town and 
the surrounding countryside, and 
these bodies have given top prior- 
ity to water delivery systems. They 
are also terracing the badly eroded 
slopes of the Andes, establishing 
seed banks, introducing health ser- 
vices and carrying out a programme 
of refuse eollection and park 
improvement. 
In Colombia’s second largest city, 
Cali, 350,000 people were living in 
squalid shacks in the Aguablanca 
settlement. To help them make 
decent homes for themselves, the 
Carvajal Foundation built a ware- 
house selling good-quality building

celebrated are being destroyed. The park’s living heritage seemed to be 
sinking into oblivion. 
In 1991, the Project selected a number of loeal young people, aged 14 
to 18, to work as guides, make contact with other young people and act 
as outreaclr agents in schools and in the community at large. Twenty-six 
teachers and 700 students were then recruited to replant and restore 
the candomble sites, A library was opened in 1995 and an environmental 
education programme was started, offering students a chance to take 
part in practical activities, including school vegetable gardens. Seeing 
the good work that was being done, UNESCO decided to make Piraja Park 
an experimental zone of the Mata Atlantica Biosphere Reserve, 
In 1996, the Project published a newspaper, put on a play, set up eraft 
workshops for children, spread its activities to other schools, mobilized 
public opinion, and asked artists to act as “militants” in the cause of the 
park. So many initiatives have been launched that they cannot all be listed 
here. Work is now proceeding on the establishment of an open-air museum 
to draw attention to the region’s history and eulture, and the local pop- 
ulation is being encouraged to learn more about nature and respeet it. 
These activities form part of a wider socio-economic development strat- 
egy lor the region, one of the poorest in the world. The United Nations

ROOTS, TUBERS AND GREEN 
BANANAS 
Roots such as manioc and tubers 
such as potatoes, sweet potatoes 
and yams are, together with plan- 
tains, the staple foods of over 1.5 
billion of the world's population. 
Some 650 million tons of these 
foods are produced a year, 70 per 
cent in the countries of the South. 
Their cultivation is an issue of such 
importance that a network for the 
promotion of tropical starch-pro- 
ducing plants (PROAMYL-CIO) has 
been set up, linking a hundred or 
so full-time researchers from 
CIRAD, France's International Cen-

WORMS RID SOIL OF OIL 
Australia's Murdoch University in 
Perth has carried out a study on 
the capacity of earthworms to 
decontaminate oil-polluted soils. 
Worms aerate the soil and enrich 
it with nutriments. When they 
ingest hydrocarbons their colour 
changes from pale pink to black, 
but they revert to their original 
colour when they have eaten 
organic wastes, their usual food. 
An oil company experimentally 
spread its sludge in a field which 
was later ploughed. Micro-organ- 
isms in the soil decomposed the 
light parts of the sludge. The 
worms dealt with the heavy parts.

Some of the trees go to restore 
damaged wocdlands or protected 
areas such as the Delta det Ebro

the Mediterranean coast. 
GETTING RID OF LEADED 
PETROL 
The World Bank has this year pub- 
lished a report on the dangers of 
leaded petrol in Eastern and Cen- 
tral Europe. While some 18 coun- 
tries, including Brazil, Thailand, 
Canada and the United States 
have now phased it out, the coun- 
tries in this region have not done 
so. In Budapest (Hungary), for 
instance, 90 per cent of airborne 
lead comes from vehicle exhaust. 
Children are most at risk from the 
neurological damage and heart 
disease associated with lead expo- 
sure. The report recommends tax- 
ing leaded fuel more heavily than 
unleaded and helping refineries 
upgrade to new technology. The 
 
reduction in health care expendi 
ture should more than cover the 
costs involved. y 
MYSTERY IN NIGER 
Hydrologists from France's 
ORSTOM Institute recently came 
upon a puzzling phenomenon. 
Although rainfall has been declin- 
ing since the 1960s in West Africa, 
the Sahel in particular, the under- 
ground water level near Niamey, 
capital of Niger, is rising, despite 
a serious twenty-year drought. The 
reason is that the plant cover has 
changed, the cultivated area 
around Niamey increasing from 
12 to 63 per cent of the total. Rain- 
water runoff thus increases, as a 
result of several factors. The crust 
that forms on the surface of irri- 
gated land is only slightly perme- 
able, there are fewer obstacles (in 
the form of twigs and grasses) to 
runoff, and the activity of crea- 
tures—termites for instance— 
which used to be conducive to infil- 
tration into the soil surface, has 
been reduced. Hence, rainwater

CONTRABAND CFCS 
[tis ten years since the signing of 
the Montreal Protocol, whereby 
the use of “ozone-munching” 
chemicals was to be eliminated. 
The number of signatories has 
risen from the original 24 coun- 
tries to 163. Some Western coun- 
tries have already reduced the 
release of these substances by 
half, while other countries like 
China and Brazil are making 
efforts to follow suit. Unfortu- 
nately, it is reckoned that the ille- 
gal trade in one of the com- 
pounds—chloroflucrocarbons or 
CFCs—amounts to roughly 20,000 
tonnes a year, and some unscrupu- 
lous producers even advertise 
their wares on the Internet. The 
ozone layer may have to wait until 
2050 to heal itself. 2 
PESTICIDES DUMPED IN 
AFRICA 
More than 20,000 tonnes of dete- 
riorated pesticides are currently 
stocked in Africa, amounting to a 
fifth of the total stored in developing 
countries. This estimate by the 
Food and Agriculture Crganization 
of the United Nations (FAQ) is 
alarming. More than 70 tonnes 
have been recorded in Benin alone. 
These highly dangerous products 
are largely intended for agriculture, 
but they are also found in aerosol 
form in markets and shops, dis- 
played beside foodstuffs. It would 
cost from $80 to $100 million to 
get rid of them. .

### 110437: Toto la Momposina

Listening ~ Toto la Momposina 
A Colombian singer with « tremendous voice, Toto la Momposina 
(Sonia Bazanta) is an internationally known exponent of the rich musical 
tradition of her country’s Atlantic seaboard. 
Toto la Momposina is a singer and 
dancer who releases seismic forces 
on stage. “The maelstrom of brass and 
drums and the colonrful costumes made 
me think of back home,” said a young 
South African dancer after onc of Toto’s 
concerts. “ There's the same enthusiasm 
and energy that you {ind in Zulu music.” 
Toto’s hand features a trumpet, abom- 
bardino (a precursor of the oboe family), a 
guitar and a double Dass as well as folk 
instruments such as the tiple (a small 
twelve-string guitar) and a gaita (a hamboo 
or caetus-wood Amerindian flute). She also 
lias a perenssion section that weaves com- 
plex rhythms with various kinds of drums, 
including the deep-toned bombo, hongos, 
claves, maraeas, guache (seed-filled tubes 
that are shaken) and marimbulas (drums 
containing small strips of metal). “Drums 
make yon react in an instinctive and spon- 
taneous way,” she explains, “and the music 
I perform is basieally percussive.” 
Five-hundred-year-old music 
Toto belongs to the fourth generation of a 
family of musicians (her father is a drum- 
mer, her mother a singer and daneer). She 
was born in Talatgua, a village on Mompos 
Island (whence hier nickname), in the nortli- 
ernreaches of Colombhia’s Magdalena River. 
An intensely musical area, this lush, trop- 
Toto La Mompasina and her group. 
he unesco (COURIER 8 january 1908 
ical region was originally inhabited by Indi- 
ans and then during the colonial period 
became a haven for Maroons (fugitive 
slaves), who built fortified communities 
known as palenques. 
The best known palenque, located near 
Cartagena, was founded in 1608 under the 
leadership of the African-born King 
Benkos. It still exists, and ancient Angolan 
customs are practised there. Maroons and 
Indians often intermarried, producing off- 
spring who prized their freedom and orig- 
inality. Musically speaking, Colombia’s 
Atlantic coast is part of the Caribbean 
world, and over the years has produced a 
host of intense musical genres that have 
emerged from a blend of the African, 
Amerindian and Spanish cultures. 
As a child, Toto learned the chandé, 
the mapalé, the fandango, the currulao, 
the porro, the puya, the merengue and 
the cumbia, all of whieh are secular or 
sacred musical forms. She also learned the 
art of the cantadoras, female singers who 
improvise coplas (verse couplets). She took 
part in fiestas, wakes and eeremonies in 
neighbouring villages, listened to the rhyth- 
mic songs of itinerant salesmen and was 
taught by many musicians, including the 
wonderful cantadora Ramona Ruiz, who 
visited the family home. 
She made up licr mind to devote the 
 
BY ISABELLE LEYMARIE 
rest of her life to upholding her region’s 
musical traditions. “You could describe 
our music as an enterprise that began 500 
years ago,” she explains, “a process that 
has developed and changed but perpetu- 
ates the village traditions from which it 
has emerged. What we want to do is inject 
our own energy into it, develop it to the 
full and help to strengthen our national 
musical identity. We want to help our coun- 
try’s music express the culture of all our 
people.” The baton of tradition has already 
been taken up by her son and daughters, 
who play in her band, not to mention her 
granddaughter, Maria del Mar, who moves 
happily around the stage during some of 
their concerts. 
Humanist and mystic 
Toto began her professional career in 1968. 
With her own band she has made several 
European and Latin American tours. After 
a stay in Paris where she studied the his- 
tory of dance at the Sorbonne, sometimes 
sang in train stations and on street corners 
and cut two records: Toto La Momposina 
(Auvidisc) and Colombia, Music from the 
Atlantic Coast (Aspic), she returned to 
Colombia. “I was falling prey to ethno-musi- 
cologists and needed to recharge my bat- 
teries.” She then studied the bolero in 
Cuba and incorporated the son, the 
guaracha, the rumba and other Cuban 
beats popular in Colombia into her reper- 
toire and travelled all over the world. 
She dislikes the term folklore which, 
she feels, designates ossified forms of 
expression, and prefers to talk of tradi- 
tional music or, making a punning refer- 
ence to “folklore”, conflor (“with a flower”) 
music. With its roots in the soil and in tune 
with the cosmic order, her country’s music 
possesses inexhaustible vitality, “At home,” 
she says, “the rural people have always 
composed music based on nature, and when 
music comes {rom the land, its language 
knows no frontiers. When I listen to drum- 
mers from Senegal or the Congo, I can hear 
affinities with Cuban, Brazilian and Colom- 
bian drummers.” 
“Upholding my cultural lieritage inter- 
nationally is a mission for me,” she says, 
“but the road is not easy. There can’t be 
any stars in this field. I have a spiritual 
idea of my art.” |

this month's interview 
BM What sort of a childhood did you have? 
Luis Sepiilveda: I was lucky enough to have a 
normal childhood in a family whieh was imbued 
with the spirit of curiosity and which gave me the 
urge and the opportunity to travel. From the 
age of fourteen onwards, I used to spend my hol- 
idays backpacking around Chile—which is 5,000 
km frou north to south—and the neighbouring 
countries, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina and Uruguay. 
BM What about your studies? 
L.S.: After secondary school in Santiago, I stud- 
ied theatre production at the National Univer- 
sity. In 1969, 1 was given a five-year scholarship 
to continue my drama studies at Moscow Uni- 
versity, but it was withdrawn after five months on 
account of “misconduct” —I had made friends 
with some dissidents, who in my opinion were 
producing the best artin the Soviet Union. 1 had 
to go back to Chile. 
BM How did you become a writer? 
L.S.: Through reading, especially the great 
authors of adventure stories like Jules Verne, 
Jack London and Robert Louis Stevenson. We 
read a fot at home. My grandfather, who was a 
Spanish anarchist, loved books and had a small 
library. I think the urge to write came from read- 
ing Francisco Coloana, a Chilean writer. 
B What was your first book? 
L.S.: It came out in 1966, a collection of very had 
juvenile poetry I shall never have republished. I 
went on writing because I had acquired a taste for 
it, but without believing myself to be a writer. 
Then one day a friend put together a dozen of 
my stories into a book, Cronicus de Pedro Nadie, 
and sent it to Cuba, where it wou the Casa de las 
Americas Prize in 1969. Later it was published in 
Colombia and Argentina, and [started to be known 
throughout Latin America. I'd become a writer

excellent training for a writer heeause of the need 
to meet deadlines. 
BM You had a political role at the same time... 
L.S.: While writing I was also politically active, 
first as a leader of the student movement and 
then in the Salvador Allende administration, 
especially in the department of enltural affaivs. 
I acted as a mediator between the government 
and big business, and 1 also worked for the

but 1 was rearrested and given a life sentence 
for treason and subversion, finally reduced to 
twenty-eight years, thanks to my defence lawyer.

### 110438: Novelist in exile: Luis Sepúlveda

» exile, s0in 1977 I left the prison for the airport 
to fly to Sweden, where I was to teach Spanish lit- 
erature. At the first stopover, Buenos Aires, 1 
managed to make my getaway. 
HM That was the start of a long exile... 
L.S.: Yes, I went first to Urnguay but many of my 
friends there, asin Argentina, which was then a 
dictatorship, were dead or in prison, so I went on 
to Brazil, to Sie Paulo, but had to leave there for 
Paraguay, where I couldn’t stay because of the 
regime. I went from there to Bolivia and then to 
Peru, finally taking up residence in Ecnador 
after a great {riend of mine, the novelist and poet 
Jorge Enrique Adoum, had invited me to attend 
a meeting of Latin American writers there. In 
Quito I was director of the Alliance Francaise 
theatre and founded a theatrical company and 
then I took part in a UNESCO expedition to assess 
the impact of colonization on the Shuar Indians. 
HM Was that important for you? 
L.S.: Enormously important. 1 shared the life of 
the Shnars for seven months. It was a decisive 
experience that ehanged my whole outlook. 1 
suddenly realized what it really meant to be 
Latin American, to belong to a maltienttural, 
multilingual continent—over ninety languages, 
not counting Spanish and Portuguese—with its 
own conceptions of time and history, its own rites. 
realized that the Marxism-Leninism I had grown 
up with was not a reeipe that could be applied 
to a continent whose population is mainly rural 
and stands in a close relationship of dependence 
and proteetiveness with nature. 1 worked in con- 
tact with the Indian organizations and I drew up 
the first literacy teaching plan for the Ilhambura 
peasants’ federation, in the Andes. 
HM Then you went on again to another country... 
L.S.: Yes, but I went on writing short stories the 
whole time and I had plans Tor longer works. In 
1979, 1 joined the Simon Bolivar international 
brigade, which was fighting in Nicaragua. hnme- 
diately after the victory of the revolution, I 
started working as a journalist writing on inter- 
national affairs, but the following year I decided 
to leave Nicaragna and go to Europe. 
NM You decided to live in Germany. Why was that? 
L.S.:1 chose Ilamburg as my base because 1 had 
learned German in prison ont of admiration for 
German literature, especially the romanties, 
Novalis and Ilolderlin, without whom it is impos- 
sible to understand modern literature and Latin 
American literature in particular.

1 also have a strong emotional rapport with 
Namburg: it has links with Valparaiso that go 
hack to the heroic days of sail. In addition, ITan- 
burg is the place with the greatest concentration 
of media in Europe, so I had the opportunity to 
work for the press and write for television. I did 
a great deal of journalism, which gave me the 
opportunity to travel widely and spend much 
time in Latin America and in Africa. 
It was in Hamburg in 1982 that I first came 
into contact with Greenpeace. 1 joined in their 
struggle for the environment. For five years, until 
1987, I was a crewman on onc of their ships. 
Later I acted as co-ordinator between various 
hranches of Greenpeace. 
HM What about your writing in the meantime? 
L.S.: I never stopped. My first novel, Un viejo 
que lela novelas de amor, (The Old Man Who 
Read Love Stories) came out in 1989, followed by 
a sccond, El mundo del fin del mundo. They 
have been translated into many langnages. [also 
kept on writing (or the theatre. 
HM Has living in Europe changed your attitude to 
Latin America? Do you feel farther away from it now 
or closer to it? 
L.S.: I feel much more Latin American than if 1 
were living in Latin America. But I don’t think it 
necessary to come to Europe to write Latin Amer- 
ican literature. I can write anywhere in the world. 
Distance, I must admit, does have the advantage 
of offering a panoramic overview of the conti- 
nent and the reality of life there. The ehallenge 
in these circumstances is to keep yourself well 
enough informed to be able to understand the 
changes taking place and the reasons for those 
changes, which I do by going hack every year— 
I have an excellent information network back 
home in the shape of my friends who live there. 
That being said, my time in Europe is a rather 
happy and persistent accident that has undeni- 
ably leftits mark on me. L have soaked up Euro- 
pean culture. 
HM Do these different influences come together in 
some way? 
L.S.: Literature is one and indivisible. Different 
writers take different paths but they all lead to 
the same destination. Literature is a great broth- 
erhood, Jean-Marie Gustave Le Clézio, for exam- 
ple, is a European writer but he spends much of 
his time in Mexico and his outlook is such that we 
regard him more as a Latin American writer! 
Latin America is a continent of contradictions 
and wide differences but in some respects it is

also an extension of Europe, a continent of emi- 
grants. Borges referred to us Latin Americans of 
the southern cone of the continent as Europeans 
born in exile. Our way of life follows European 
models. We are republics, we fought for our 
independence and our political sovereignty, pat- 
terned on that of the French revolution, and the 
great poetical founder-figures of our modern lit- 
erature, such as Ruben Dario or Vicente [Tnido- 
bro, are undeniably mature Europeans. 
HB What makes you write? 
L.S.: I write simply because I like writing. I don’t 
want to do anything clse. 1 gave up journalism 
to devote myself entirely to literature. This may 
sound like the answer of someone who has heen 
privileged or an anarehist, but I do what [ like 
doing and I make my living doing it. 
[don’t regard writing as a gift from the gods, 
a privilege accorded to a certain caste. It’s just 
a job! It makes me laugh when Lhear of authors 
who claim to suffer a lot when writing. 1f they 
suffer so mucli, why do they write—they don’t 
have to be masochists. 
HB Do you rework your books a lot? 
L.S.: Yes, a lot. I'm a very disciplined worker 
and Idon’t regard them as finished unless I have 
been over them at least ten times from begin- 
ning to end. 
BW Your books are short. Is that a deliberate 
choice? Is there a rhythm you feel obliged to follow? 
L.S.: Length and style depend on the story you 
want to tell. T have cut fifty pages out of some of 
my novels because they got in the way, they inter- 
rupted the flow I wanted to give them. 
HB Is concern for the environment winning out over 
the political commitment that typified so many Latin 
American writers of the previous generation? 
L.S.: They go hand in hand. Literature cannot 
change reality, but it can refleet—re flect upon— 
avery important aspect of it. Rediscovering eco- 
logical dignity is very much a political struggle. 
Some present-day writers, like Paco Taibo or Rolo 
Diez, are just as politically committed as their 
predecessors were, hut they approach political 
matters from the angle of historical memory, by 
reference to what has happened and what should 
neither be forgotten nor reenr. Their approach 
is critical, not without passion but far removed 
from perfunctory militancy. 
BM Geography getting its revenge on history? 
L.S.: A revenge that is all the more necessary   
I want to 
stimulate my 
readers to think 
and to sharpen 
their awareness 
of others

now that the new world order, although it has 
done away with the East-West confrontation, is 
constantly and increasingly exacerbating the 
North-South confrontation. 
Latin America is pact of the South. We are 
alone, but itis better to be alone than to keep 
bad company. A political project can’t be built 
in a day. Onr conception of time must inevitably 
he different from the North's conception, but we 
have the time. 
Hl Do you write to forget barbarism or to 
denounce it? 
L.S.: All that concerns me as a writer is that my 
readers should come to the same conclusion as 
my characters, that they should take notice of 
what is happening to them and think. I respect 
readers’ freedom, and 1 have abolutely no wish to 
impose anything on them. All Taim to do is give 
them food [ov thought, thus helping them to 
discover the rules governing relationships with 
others, the rules of respect for others, with their 
culture and their traditions, and to sharpen their 
awareness of others, whicliis, incidentally, a tra- 
dition in adventure-story writing. 
HB How do you explain your fascination with travel 
and with the extremes of the natural world, the 
southern seas or the Amazonian forest? 
L.S.: Tam not a eity person. like to spend a cer- 
tain lime iu towns, but I need to come face to face 
with the elemental forees of nature, to prove to 
myself that I can survive on my own, relying on 
myself, aud also to prove that the individual can 
live without being dependent on the state. 
HM Or on other people? 
L.S.: No, not on other people. We always need 
other people. Humans are social animals, hut 
they onghtn’t to get involved in relationships 
based on dependence or domination. 
BH You are internationally famous. How does that 
affect you? 
L.S.: Success came as a pleasant surpise, but 
my character hasn’t changed. I'm happy to have 
freedom of movement and be free to decide what 
to do with my time, but it is above all a great 
responsibility to bear. I have an ethical position 
in relation to life and an aesthetic position in 
relation to literature, I would like the distinction 
to be understood, so that readers eould say “1 
like Sepilveda’s hooks hut I don’t agree with 
his views” or “I like wha! he writes, so 1 would 
like to know Lis views”. Literature is a means to 
an end. ||

Il A REMARKABLE DICTIONARY 
OF CARIBBEAN ENGLISH 
| wish to express my appreciation for the superb, eclectic 
coverage in your June 1997 issue (“How ideas travel”). | 
was struck by the variety of very interesting articles on sub- 
jects ranging from best sellers of the eighteenth century 
and the cyberspace virtual library to the interview with 
Viviane Forrester. 
I should like to commend to you a remarkable work by 
Professor Richard Allsopp, the Oxford Dictionary of 
Caribbean English Usage. Perhaps you could review it or 
interview the author in a forthcoming issue. Caribbean Eng: 
hsh has been influenced by several different Afican, Indian, 
Chinese and Portuguese languages and vanous forms of 
“British English”. It 1s a tremendous blend!

lA RADIO MILESTONE 
| read with great interest your February 1997 issue { “Radio, 
a future for sound”). In the “Milestones in radio” feature, 
however, | was disappointed to see no mention of the 
world's first regular radio broadcasts, which began on 27 
August 1920 from Buenos Aires's El Teatro Coliseo. Broad- 
casting from this station, under the name LR2, has con- 
tinued right until today. 
The author may not know of the Buenos Aires event, 
but Unesco cannot be unaware of the birth of this regular 
radio service. In many countries 27 August is celebrated as 
“World Radio Day” in commemoration of this first broadcast 
made from Buenos Ares.

Bl NAMING NAMES 
The Interview with Viviane Forrester in your June 1997 issue 
(“How ideas travel”) was particularly interesting because it 
clearly named those responsible for the present economic 
situation. Most of the time your contributors write very 
well about poverty and destitution, war and peace, but 
unlike Vivane Forrester they never explain the reasons why 
the problems exist. 
| wonder who will take the initiative of bringing together 
groups and individuals to denounce the present situation 
and, setting political divisions aside, to draw up a social blue- 
print that names the common “enemy” and proposes 
sound solutions? More than pious wishes and compas- 
sionate words are needed. Is this what the Courier intends 
to do? | am grateful to see that you have made a first step.

Il ASKING ‘WHY’ NOT ‘HOW’ 
In his discussion of ethics and genetics in his “Science and 
Society (3)" Commentary in the May 1997 issue {“Land- 
scape with Figures”), Unesco's Director-General squarely 
addresses the issue of the responsibility of scientists. 
Instead of questioning the ways we use science (the 
“how”), I believe it is increasingly urgent to ask the question 
“why”. Why, for example, did we choose to produce energy 
using the atom when we can do so using water, wind and 
sun? If we had asked this question fifty or sixty years ago, 
we could have avoided putting atomic energy to other uses. 
In the field of bioethics, the right question to ask 1s not 
“how can we produce a perfect baby?” but “why should we 
produce a perfect baby?” 
Addressing a problem by asking “why” rather than 
“how” 1s a far broader approach to problem-solving in the 
contemporary world.

I A DYNAMIC UNESCO 
ASSOCIATED SCHOOL 
We should like to give you some information about our 
activities in the 1996-1997 school year. 
Shortly after the start of the year, we translated the 
wonderful texts of Unesco posters on Tolerance, Peace 
and Improving Human Relations; then we photocopied, 
coloured and distributed them to the other schools on 
our island. 
In December we held an evening dedicated to Unesco's 
50th anniversary, at the end of which we exhibited and 
sold stationery produced by Unicer (the United Nations 
Children’s Fund). 
In May 1997 In the context of the “Other countnes, 
other cultures” project, we organized an evening devoted to 
the Kalas, a mountain people of Pakistan, provided back- 
ground Information about them and sold postcards to 
raise money to help them complete the new school they are 
building. 
Finally, despite complications ansing from the political 
Situation, we continue to have close ties of frendship with 
the Turkish school in Guldk.
