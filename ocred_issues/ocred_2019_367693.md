### 367829: Éditorial

Editorial 
2014 was a watershed year for humanity: 
for the first time in history, more than half 
of the world’s population now lives in 
cities. By current estimates, this will rise 
to seventy per cent by 2050. These cities 
of tomorrow will, in many ways, mirror 
their forbearers; from the early city-states 
of Mesopotamia, to the Italian cities of 
the Renaissance, to the megacities of 
today - cities have historically advanced 
human development, serving as melting 
pots for people of diverse backgrounds to 
exchange and dialogue. 
Yet the cities of today and tomorrow 
are also facing new, unprecedented 
challenges. Although occupying only 
two per cent of the world’s landmass, 
they consume sixty per cent of global 
energy, release seventy-five per cent of

greenhouse gas emissions and produce 
seventy per cent of global waste. As cities 
expand, they threaten biodiversity, and 
place urban infrastructure and resources 
— from water to transport to electricity — 
under enormous strain, multiplying the 
impact of natural disasters and climate 
change. Unchecked development and 
mass tourism place cultural heritage 
sites and living heritage practices at 
risk. Rising inequality and migration - 
driven in many cases by conflict and 
disaster — make cities the focal points for 
new social cleavages, for exclusion and 
discrimination. 
Given the magnitude of these challenges, 
cities across the globe have concluded 
that new ways of thinking, citizen 
engagement and, crucially, city-to-city 
cooperation, are the only paths forward.

We have seen this at UNESCO, which is 
home to no less than five city networks, 
each of which is working to harness the 
extraordinary capacity for innovation and 
connection that is a hallmark of cities. 
For instance, cities account for seventy 
per cent of the global economy, including 
a large portion of the creative economy, 
which generates annual global revenues 
of $2,250 billion and employs more 
young people than any other sector. 
That is why the 180 cities that form the 
UNESCO Creative Cities Network are 
working to leverage the ability of cities 
to bring creative people together, to 
spark economic growth, to foster a sense 
of community and to preserve urban 
identities. UNESCO's Global Network 
of Learning Cities is working to make 
cities sustainable by ensuring that all 
urban residents can benefit from lifelong 
learning. From learning to ride a bicycle 
to make the urban environment cleaner, 
learning to make local products using 
traditional practices and knowledge or 
organizing community theatre workshops 
in marginalized neighbourhoods, each 
new educational opportunity brings with 
it the potential for social transformation 
and development. 
As one of the world’s foremost 
laboratories of ideas, UNESCO is working 
to bring these networks of cities together, 
encouraging them to exchange and 
collaborate on the policies and practices 
that can respond to the growing needs 
of urban residents. The Pulitzer-winning 
journalist, Herb Caen, once said, “A city is 
not gauged by its length and width, but 
by the broadness of its vision and the 
height of its dreams.” UNESCO believes 
that when cities share these dreams, and 
take inspiration from the vision of others, 
they can overcome the challenges of our 
new urban era. 
This issue of the UNESCO Courier is full 
of stories of creativity, innovation and 
resilience. | hope they inspire you, and 
perhaps push you to engage with these 
issues in your own city or community.

Director-General of UNESCO

In this issue 
Cities have always been centres of power, 
attractiveness and prosperity. But the 
frenetic urbanization of recent decades 
is jeopardizing their historical function as 
melting pots that integrate and absorb 
newcomers. As they become more 
populated, they become dehumanized. 
Violence, inequality, discrimination — 
the larger the cities, the more theseills 
overwhelm them. 
Nevertheless, even as they are 
dehumanized, cities are reinventing 
themselves. From street smarts as a 
survival strategy in Kinshasa (Democratic 
Republic of the Congo) to major 
national projects for the rehabilitation 
of single-industry cities in Russia; from 
the personal initiative of a gallery 
owner who revitalized the small town 
of Erriadh (Tunisia) to the mobilization 
of the masses against the authoritarian 
appropriation of public spaces in Warsaw 
(Poland); and from solidarity movements 
with migrants in London (United 
Kingdom) to synergies that revive the 
heart of Havana (Cuba) — creative forces 
are emerging and organizing themselves 
to give urban life new meanings and new 
perspectives. We may believe these are 
“tiny resistances” - to use the expression 
of the French writer Thomas B. Reverdy — 
but they make all the difference. 
Two other writers share their views with 
our readers in this issue. Our Guest, 
the French-Congolese author Alain 
Mabanckou, talks about “mobile 
Africas” and the courage to write, while 
highlighting contradictory moments in 
colonial history. The Uruguayan-American 
writer Jorge Majfud condemns the racist 
attitude towards migrants in the Ideas 
section, which also provides an analysis of 
migration policies in the United States. 
In the Current Affairs section — on 
the occasion of World Africa Day, 
25 May — we publish an interview with 
Tshilidzi Marwala (South Africa), on 
the emergence of artificial intelligence 
(Al) on the continent. To mark the 
International Day for Biological Diversity, 
22 May, we visit Gran Pajatén, Peru, with 
Roldan Rojas Paredes — the man who 
initiated its inscription on UNESCO's 
World Network of Biosphere Reserves. 
We also go to Sharjah (United Arab 
Emirates), which launches its World Book 
Capital programme in April 2019. 
Finally, with Zoom, we travel to India, 
Mexico, Myanmar and Uganda, to visit 
places without electricity. An illuminating 
trip around the world!

### 367830: Varsovie, l'insoumise

Warsaw, the | NVI NC] D | C City 
Joanna Lasserre 
 
Faced with mounting 
conservatism, progressive 
civil society in Warsaw is 
demonstrating a strong 
capacity for protest in order 
to defend democratic values. 
The “rebel” Polish capital - so 
often occupied, mistreated 
and destroyed - has held 
firm through many episodes 
of its history. It is still being 
reconstructed, in a constant 
quest for fulfilment. 
Warsaw is not what you would call a 
beautiful city. It does not offer itself in all 
its magnificence to the hurried visitor, as 
does Krakow, the former Polish capital. 
A city with a hundred shades of grey, it 
was invaded by the younger generations 
after the fall of the communist regime in 
1989. They squatted in the abandoned 
factories and turned them into places 
of artistic creation. They defended 
the architecture of the communist 
period in the face of pressure from 
new real-estate developers. The Palace 
of Culture and Science, for example, a 
“gift” from Comrade Stalin, completed 
in 1955, still dominates the city centre 
today — whether its many critics like it 
or not. As imposing as it is unloved by 
the people of Warsaw, this immense 
building of more than 800,000 square 
metres was a veritable cultural multiplex 
before its time — housing museums, 
convention halls, workshops, theatres and 
art-house cinemas. 
Over the last thirty years, a myriad of 
new meeting places — galleries, clubs, 
bars — have flourished here and there 
in post-communist Warsaw, which 
continues to attract students, executives 
of international companies, artists and 
adventurers from all over the world.

March through the old town of 
Warsaw in November 2018 to celebrate 
100 years of women’s suffrage. 
 
You have to walk through the city’s 
streets to let yourself be invaded by the 
energy that drives it, and let yourself 
be drawn into its many unexpected 
corners, to meet at random a group that 
marches here, another that parks there 
— when it’s not a human tide protesting, 
brandishing banners and signs. 
Silent marches and noisy demonstrations 
are frequent scenes in Warsaw. 
White flowers, black clothes, candles, 
firecrackers — all these mingle under a 
surge of white and red flags. But while 
some also bear the blue flag of Europe 
with its golden stars, others wave the 
black or the green flags of the nationalist 
patriots, nostalgic for a “Greater Poland 
from sea to sea” While some proclaim: 
“Let us not leave democracy to die in 
silence!’ others demand a“pure Poland’, 
a “white Poland”. 
This is the national paradox, which in 
recent years has turned into a veritable 
rupture between two Polands, which defy 
or ignore each other. And this rupture 
gushes forth in the public square, both 
literally and figuratively. 
Rebel city 
Most often, the confrontation crystallizes 
in front of the presidential palace. Until 
April 2018, this was the arrival point of 
the religious procession that left the old 
town every tenth day of the month to 
commemorate — with a mass, prayers, 
hymns and speeches — the Smolensk 
disaster of 10 April 2010. On that day, 
ninety-six prominent people, including 
President Lech Kaczynski, were killed 
in a plane crash. A monthly ceremony, 
raised to the national level, was therefore 
to be repeated ninety-six times, till April 
2018. It occupied the historic centre of 
Warsaw and attracted crowds of citizens 
who turned up regularly to protest 
against what they considered to be an 
authoritarian and religious appropriation 
of the public space. 
The citizens’ opposition to the nationalist 
trend started mobilizing in 2015, through 
a civic non-governmental organization, 
the Committee for the Defence of 
Democracy (KOD). On 13 December, 
the anniversary of the traumatic day 
when martial law was imposed in Poland 
by General Jaruzelski in 1981, tens of 
thousands of people march in Warsaw 
every year. The street demonstrations on 
that day in 2016 saw the largest turnout 
since the first free elections in 1989.

### 367830: Varsovie, l'insoumise

The citizens of Warsaw, joined by 
protesters from around Poland, took 
this opportunity to challenge state 
manipulation of the constitution, 
institutions, and the rights of citizens, 
particularly women. 
Women are at the forefront of all civil 
society movements, bringing together 
a large part of the society. In 2016, a 
draft bill to ban all abortions sparked 
mass nationwide strikes and protests. 
The proposed legislation would have 
drastically curtailed Poland's already- 
strict abortion laws, which allow for the 
voluntary termination of pregnancy only 
in cases of severe fetal malformation, if 
there was grave danger to the mother’s 
health, or if the pregnancy was a result of 
rape or incest. That time, the protesters 
won, and the government was forced to 
abandon the plan. 
But on 11 November 2017, when women 
sat on the Poniatowski Bridge to block 
the path of nationalists marching during 
Poland's Independence Day, they were 
forcibly removed - and then brought 
to justice on charges of obstructing the 
freedom to protest. 
The same scene is repeated every 
Independence Day. A handful of women, 
brandishing “Women against Fascism” 
banners, are pushed around by scores 
of men dressed in black, uttering sexist 
vulgarities, alternated with xenophobic, 
anti-Semitic and racist slogans. 
The same mob shows up outside theatres. 
After each performance of a controversial 
play that contradicts the sacred codes 
of “Polishness’, the Powszechny Theatre 
prepares to face a new riot organized by 
small groups of the far-right. The theatre 
— along with Krzysztof Warlikowski’s 
New Theatre and some other famous 
theatres in the country — has always been 
a symbol of the struggle for the artistic 
freedom that remains a thorn in the side 
of authoritarian powers. 
Could this be a coincidence? Poland's 
student revolt in 1968 — a milestone in 
the struggle for liberation from Soviet 
oppression — began with the withdrawal 
of a classic, Adam Mickiewicz's poetic 
drama, Dziady (Forefathers’ Eve) from the 
Warsaw National Theatre's repertoire. 
From fall to reconquest, so goes the life 
of this amazing city that draws its ardour 
and energy from its human resources.

Rebel city 
This wave of rebellion and freedom is not 
new in Warsaw. Does it come from its river 
that cannot be tamed? The Vistula, with 
its vast and steep valley that prevents the 
right and left banks from getting closer, 
remains impetuous and wild. Bordered 
by sand and bushes, it gives the city 
its character. 
For a long time, Warsaw retained its 
rustic style. Its emancipation began in 
1915, under the reign of the Germans, 
who recaptured it from Russia during the 
First World War. Although it was severely 
exploited economically by the occupiers, 
the city was driven by an extraordinary 
determination and hope. Municipal 
elections were held, and the university 
and polytechnic opened. Warsaw was 
preparing to take on the role of capital of 
a sovereign state, which it finally attained 
at the end of the war, in 1918. 
During the twenty short years 
following independence, the entire 
city became a construction site under 
Marshal Jézef Pitsudski, a leader who 
was both adulated and controversial. 
  
The result was that in 1939, Warsaw 
looked like other European capitals. 
It had an elegant city centre and many 
areas inhabited by workers, who made 
up half its population. A large Jewish 
neighbourhood, teeming with life, 
spread over at least a third of the area, 
stretching from the centre to the north 
of the city. 
It was then that the bombs of Germany's 
invasion struck Warsaw, until the coup 
de grace in October 1944, Hitler wanted 
to make the city an example of total 
annihilation, following the failed Warsaw 
Uprising led by the underground Polish 
resistance movement from August to 
October 1944. The city’s right bank 
was almost completely destroyed, and 
the surviving population deported. 
Warsaw was nothing more than a vast 
field of ruins, and the possibility of its 
reconstruction seemed doubtful, given 
the magnitude of the task. 
Yet, as early as in January 1945, 
homeless revenants were already flocking 
to the banks of the Vistula, to stir up 
the frozen rubble.

Demonstration outside the Royal Castle 
in Warsaw, July-August 2017, to protest 
against the monthly commemoration 
of the Smolensk plane crash. 
 
They thus began, on their own initiative, 
a reconstruction that would soon turn 
into an extraordinary achievement 
for the entire nation. Fortunately, 
architecture offices and schools had 
clandestinely compiled inventories 
of historic buildings during the Nazi 
occupation. All was not lost. The market 
square, the town houses, the circuit 
of the ramparts, the Royal Castle and 
important religious buildings of the 
“invincible city”, as it was called then, 
would rise from the ashes — driven by a 
unifying national impetus encouraged 
by communist propaganda. This led to 
Warsaw's inscription on the UNESCO 
World Heritage List in 1980. The Archive 
of Warsaw Reconstruction Office 
(BOS Archive), which kept track of this 
memorable period, was added to the 
Memory of the World Register in 2011.

Palimpsest city 
Another fascinating chapter in Warsaw's 
history is its ghetto. Many of us have 
heard about the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising 
in the spring of 1943 and its resistance, 
as determined as it was hopeless. But 
how many know the exact location 
of this huge enclosure, the largest in 
Nazi-occupied Europe? Built in 1940, 
it was erased from the map in 1943. 
Even the residents of Warsaw had only 
a vague idea of it, as the subject was 
taboo during the decades of communist 
rule. The barbed wire had disappeared, 
and when the city was liberated, only 
fragments of its eighteen-kilometre wall, 
several metres high, remained. It had 
been somewhere north of the Palace of 
Culture, it was said. 
A new Warsaw was rising over the buried 
Jewish city, the memory of which would 
have vanished at the same time as its 
400,000 or 500,000 inhabitants, if one 
man had not survived. His name was 
Hersz Wasser. He was the assistant of the 
historian Emanuel Ringelblum, who, with 
some sixty friends, worked hard to build 
the clandestine archives of the Warsaw 
ghetto they inhabited during the Second 
World War. Some 25,000 pages, carefully 
filed in metal boxes, were extracted from 
the rubble between 1946 and 1950. These 
unique documents, collected in total 
secrecy, were inscribed in the Memory of 
the World Register just after the fall of the 
communist regime in 1989. 
Ringelblum and his team built a bridge 
from nothing towards the future. Defying 
all prohibition, they left us testimonies 
on the clandestine organizations, lists 
of deportees, chronicles, literary texts, 
works of art, diaries, private letters.... 
It was here, in the Ringelblum Archives, 
that we discovered the first detailed 
descriptions of the Chetmno and 
Treblinka extermination camps. Thanks to 
these archives, a team of contemporary 
researchers and writers have been able to 
reconstruct in detail — at least on paper — 
this district of the Polish capital that has 
disappeared. 
A palimpsest city that writes its history on 
the pages of the past, without ever really 
erasing it, Warsaw is a vast mosaic that is 
constantly reinventing itself in time and 
space. More than stone and concrete, 
it is made up of flows of human energy 
and the currents that traverse through 
it — constructing and deconstructing its 
identity, made of rebellious memory and 
salutary oblivion.

### 367831: Bienvenue versus hostilité

A Warm welcome 
versus hostility 
Gabriela Neves de Lima 
 
Faced with a policy against migrants, the inhabitants of London's Haringey 
borough have launched a welcome campaign that has been shaking up 
British immigration legislation. Proving that finding common ground is 
always possible, the borough works with local communities, and the central 
government funds some of its projects. The idea of everyone working 
together to create a more welcoming neighbourhood is catching on. 
Since the emergence of what is commonly 
referred to as the “migrant crisis” in the 
2010s, the local authorities in Europe 
have been at the forefront of ensuring the 
integration of migrants and refugees into 
their communities. Some act within the 
framework of political agendas defined by 
governments, others are more proactive. 
The Haringey Welcome campaign in 
north London has chosen to adopt a 
collaborative approach, while remaining 
an activist and independent organization 
that takes a more antagonistic stance 
when necessary. 
Moral obligation 
against social injustice 
Haringey Welcome is based on the 
notion of political solidarity, defined by 
the American philosopher Sally Scholz 
as a positive moral obligation which 
encourages collective action in the 
face of a situation of injustice or social 
vulnerability. Her ideology is the polar 
opposite of a hostile environment policy, 
explains Lucy Nabijou, coordinator 
of the residents’ group that initiated 
the campaign. “It is about solidarity 
and justice, about fighting for values, 
contesting bad law and really trying to 
work together with the local government, 
seeking a real collaboration with local 
authorities to improve services,’ she adds. 
With forty-five per cent of its population 
born outside the United Kingdom and 
five per cent having moved there in the 
last two years, Haringey is one of London's 
most cosmopolitan boroughs. “Haringey 
has a strong and proud history of 
welcoming asylum seekers and refugees 
and people who have chosen to re-settle 
in London. There are generations of 
people from around the world who have 
moved here and made Haringey one of 
the UK's most open and diverse boroughs,” 
10 The UNESCO Courier © April-June 2019 
notes a report from the local council to 
the Cabinet, dated 15 November 2016. 
It was around that time that the founders 
of Haringey Welcome took their first steps, 
demanding that the neighbourhood 
implement the central government's 
voluntary resettlement scheme for Syrian 
refugees. Claire Kober, then council leader 
of Haringey and chair of London councils, 
pledged to relocate ten Syrian families — 
to give them “a place of safety” and the 
support they needed “in order to start 
rebuilding their lives”. 
But, as Nabijou points out, the council 
suffers from a lack of financial resources, 
training and dialogue with residents and 
community groups, which undermines 
its effectiveness. This is why Haringey 
Welcome has adopted a more collaborative 
approach in its negotiations with the local 
council, emphasizing the need to create 
new communications channels and build 
relationships based on trust. 
The programme's purpose is not to 
advocate that elected councillors or 
local council employees violate national 
law per se, Nabijou insists, but rather, to 
increase transparency and accountability 
and to better navigate through available 
instruments to provide adequate services 
for migrants and refugees. 
The Haringey council already seems to 
be moving in this direction. In September 
2018, it launched the Connected 
Communities programme, with funding 
from the central government. It aims to 
improve local support for migrants in the 
areas of employment, housing, learning 
the English language, childcare and 
community empowerment. Although 
she welcomes this initiative, Nabijou has 
expressed her reservations about the 
choice of keeping it in-house, the viability 
of the project if it is tied to the current 
funding stream, and its ability to reach 
more vulnerable migrant groups. 
Another highlight was the support of 
elected officials for a motion introduced 
by Haringey Welcome in November 
2018. This, says Nabijou, provides 
a great opportunity “to put all the 
problems on the table and to rebuild 
local management”. 
Threatened social 
relations 
The need to rebuild local management 
is essential in a context of an upheaval in 
social relations. This is because the so- 
called hostile environment policy, which 
targets undocumented immigrants above 
all, and aims to deter migrants from 
crossing territorial boundaries, actually 
affects the entire population. 
Migration policies involve not only 
the different ministries and local 
representations involved in border 
control and immigration management, 
but also the private sector and ordinary 
citizens. In practice, this means that there 
are also borders within the country. All 
aspects of social life are monitored and 
potentially reported, with increased risks 
of deportation. As a result, migrants and 
asylum seekers are discouraged from 
accessing essential services. 
For instance, private landlords are obliged 
to check whether their future tenants have 
the right to reside in the country, and to 
keep proof of this, at the risk of paying a 
fine or being imprisoned for a maximum 
period of five years. With a more stringent 
redefinition of the “habitual residence” 
category, access to free health care has 
been curtailed, and temporary non- 
European immigrants have been forced 
to pay an annual surcharge for the 
duration of their stay. Between 2016 and 
2018, schools were required to provide 
the state with information on children 
with a migrant background.

However, data collection has been 
stopped as a result of a campaign that is 
currently fighting for the destruction of 
this data. 
Writing about the shift in focus of recent UK 
immigration legislation, British academics 
Nira Yuval-Davis, Georgie Wemyss and 
Kathryn Cassidy have concluded that it 
amounts to “everyday bordering in which 
ordinary citizens are demanded to become 
either border-guards and/or suspected 
illegitimate border crossers”. A relative, 
a friend, or a neighbour could become an 
informer. As Latvian anthropologist Dace 
Dzenovsca suggests, personal conflicts 
could interfere with the defence of 
borders. These practices disrupt social and 
political relations, creating fear, suspicion 
and tensions within communities, 
and threatening local solidarity and 
conviviality. It is also important to note 
that certain social categories (such as 
those based on race, class or gender) are 
disproportionately impacted by these 
policies, indicating the relative fragility 
of their rights.

Minds to Refugees’; 2017. 
  
Joining forces 
In this context, Haringey Welcome 
contributes to improving social relations 
on the ground, by building solidarity 
networks within the borough. The 
group has been working with schools, 
for example, to raise awareness of the 
implications of the hostile environment. 
It has also garnered support from other 
local community groups and migrant 
support organizations — all of whom work 
together to create a more welcoming 
borough. 
By forging these links and working 
directly with elected and government 
officials, Haringey Welcome promotes a 
form of multi-stakeholder collaboration 
involving all interested parties. Some 
of the ways in which this can be done 
includes bidding for funding for 
integration initiatives from the Controlling 
Migration Fund of the Ministry of Housing, 
Communities, and Local Government. 
Establishing a working group of local 
advisors, migrant organizations and legal 
experts to develop a strategy for migrants, 
especially more vulnerable groups, would 
also be beneficial. 
 
Beyond the political aspect, Nabijou 
observes that the Haringey Welcome 
campaign has another side-effect, 
that is equally central to the initiative. 
“Through mobilization, you get to know 
your neighbours, you meet new people, 
you are better informed about what is 
happening, and all this blends together 
to produce an extremely strong sense 
of community that transforms the place 
where you live," she enthuses.

### 367832: Débrouille et créativité à Kinshasa

Street smarts 
We are in the Democratic Republic of 
the Congo. The scene takes place in the 
city centre of Kinshasa, the capital. Three 
young shoe-shine boys sit on rocks at 
the entrance of a school, equipped with 
stools, footrests, brushes and sponges. 
Next to them, a young man has set up 
a stand and watches over a cleverly- 
crafted electric charging system. On a 
small wooden panel, he has mounted 
several electrical outlets which are illicitly 
connected to electrical wires emerging 
from the ground, where they are attached 
to the base of a defective street light. This 
man calls himself the chargeur (charger). 
While shoe-shine boys have long been 
an integral part of the urban landscape, 
battery chargers have emerged at the 
same time as mobile telephones. In the 
1970s and 1980s, the city was full of 
micro-production units — shoe or paint 
factories, carpenters or jewellers, weaving 
or dyeing workshops sprouted like 
mushrooms, mainly in backyards. Since 
the mid-1990s, small businesses and 
services have taken over. 
You have to know how to fend for 
yourself if you live in Kinshasa, among 
some 11 million inhabitants. The 
economic crisis, the failures of the state 
and public services, and the scarcity of 
salaried jobs are forcing city dwellers to 
earn their living through various forms of 
self-employment made up of small tasks 
and expediencies. 
In a context of anomy and extreme 
poverty, la débrouille - the French word 
for resourcefulness, making do, getting 
by or improvising — has become a way 
of life at which city dwellers excel. 
12 | The UNESCO Courier © April-June 2019 
IN Kinshasa 
Sylvie Ayimpam 
How do you survive when you're poor and caught up in an 
interminable series of social and economic crises? You learn how 
to get by! This is the motto of the inhabitants of Kinshasa in the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo. Showing great ingenuity, they 
never miss an opportunity to invent a new job. Romains, chargeurs, 
and other gaddafis swarm the markets and streets of the megacity, 
closing the gaps in the system. 
It is at the heart of all economic survival 
strategies, especially among young 
people, who make up more than half of 
the city’s population. 
Creativity born 
of necessity 
Like the chargeurs, who fill the gaps in the 
home electricity distribution system now 
that mobile phones are hugely successful, 
other inhabitants show remarkable 
ingenuity by inventing diverse sources 
of income, taking advantage of every 
opportunity to make themselves useful. 
Starting with next to nothing, they launch 
new activities to meet different needs. 
A table, a bench, some cooking utensils 
and charcoal are enough to setup a 
malewa, or cheap restaurant where 
you can eat for ten times less than 
anywhere else — even if hygiene is 
sometimes compromised. Are the buses 
overcrowded? No problem! The wewas 
(motorcycle taxis) are there to transport 
you. Are the streets flooded after the 
rain? All right, back carriers will ferry 
pedestrians across. Others, like second- 
hand spare-part dealers, mobile-phone 
repairers, or bottled-water vendors, are 
also at hand to help you out at any time. 
A colloquial terminology is developing 
to keep up with these new activities, 
characterized by intermediation. The 
gap left by the lack of organization of 
public and private infrastructures is 
filled by all kinds of agents, brokers and 
subcontractors who offer their services 
individually or through networks.

Plying their trades in the streets and 
markets, but also in any place of 
commercial transaction, including car 
parks, major intersections, bus stations 
and river ports, are romains (dealers in 
smuggled merchandise), bana kwatas 
(touts dealing in second-hand clothes), 
chayeurs (wholesalers’ agents), gaddafis 
(informal fuel-sellers), chargeurs (touts 
working for taxis and public transport, not 
to be confused with battery chargers!) 
cambistes (street money-changers), and 
mamas manoeuvre (middlemen trading 
food products in river ports). 
Article 15 
In the mid-1980s, the song “Article 15, 
Beta Libanga” by the Congolese musician 
Pépé Kallé (1951-1998), was a big hit 
across the continent, probably because 
so many Africans could identify with 
it. Article 15 is an imaginary article in 
the DRC Constitution that says: “Make 
do to survive!” All the Congolese know 
it and refer to it on a daily basis. “Beta 
libanga” literally means “Break the stone”. 
“Making do is not easy,’ Kallé warns us. 
— 
 
17H. 
  
“Article 15, my dears, make do to survive,’ 
he sang in Lingala. “Look at the river port: 
the dock workers carry heavy loads. Look 
at the bus conductors: they shout from 
morning to night. Look, there are stalls 
all over the city. Look at the taxi and bus 
drivers: they drive from morning to night. 
Look at us, the musicians: we sing to earn 
our living. Look at the students: they 
study to prepare for the future.” 
But the future we dream of, often 
remains distant, and in the meantime, 
we get by in Kinshasa, as in many 
other African cities. Resourcefulness 
has become a way of being, a marker 
of urban identity that spans the entire 
Kinshasa social space. The informal 
economy, which proliferates mainly 
due to chronic shortages, poverty and 
political instability, is far from being free 
of schemes, swindles, risks, conflict and 
violence. Nevertheless, it also includes 
social values, such as conviviality, 
solidarity, respect and loyalty. Ultimately, 
it contributes to a form of social 
self-regulation. 
EY cE 
  
Admittedly, in the midst of an 
incomplete modernity, institutions are 
bankrupt, administrations shaky, civil 
society unstructured and traditions 
worthless. Yet what never ceases to 
amaze in Kinshasa is the resourcefulness 
and creativity of the people struggling to 
get by, reflecting the inventive spirit of 
individuals and the community. 
A Congolese social scientist affiliated 
with the Institut des mondes africains 
(IMAF) in Aix-en-Provence, France, 
Sylvie Ayimpam’s work focuses on 
the issue of the informal economy 
in African cities. She is the author of 
Economie de la débrouille a Kinshasa.

### 367836: Russie: de monovilles à plurivilles

RUSSIA: 
From monotowns to pluritowns 
Ivan Nesterov 
The crisis in Detroit, America’s 
Motor City, was splashed all over 
the international press when the 
city filed the largest municipal 
bankruptcy in American history, 
in July 2013. The stories about 
the fall and then, the renaissance 
of this once-great city, which 
had staked everything on the 
automobile industry, abounded. 
But we don’t hear as much 
about the monogoroda, Russia's 
long-forgotten industrial 
towns, that share a similar fate. 
There are 319 of these single- 
factory towns, where a single 
industry or factory accounts 
for most of the local economy. 
How are they faring? 
Itis 2 June 2009, and the world is in the 
throes of one of its most severe financial 
crises. In north-west Russia, the federal 
highway linking Novaya Ladoga and 
Vologda is blocked. More than 300 
residents of Pikalyovo, a small town 
in Leningrad oblast [a region, with St. 
Petersburg as its capital], have formed a 
roadblock. They are protesting because 
they have not been paid for months. The 
three state factories that supported the 
town changed hands, taken over by three 
private owners: BaselCement, EuroCement 
and PhosAgro. However, these companies, 
who formed a single production line, could 
not agree on a series of issues, including 
raw material prices, production volume 
and development prospects. To such an 
extent that in this small town of 21,000 
inhabitants, 4,000 remained unemployed. 
It was only when Russian Prime Minister 
Vladimir Putin intervened in person that 
the conflict was resolved. On 4 June, he 
arrived in Pikalyovo, and brought the 
owners together — they eventually signed 
agreements to supply raw materials and 
drew up various long-term contracts. 
14 | The UNESCO Courier * April-June 2019 
The money needed to resolve the financial 
issues (including employees’ salaries, 
money owed to raw material suppliers and 
transporters) was allocated by the Russian 
state-owned bank, the VTB Group, and 
production at the plant was resumed. 
It is clear, however, that the personal 
intervention of a head of state cannot 
become a sustainable model for 
resolving crises. Especially since in most 
cases, the problems do not stem from 
disagreements between owners but 
from market exigencies. Indeed, Russia’s 
transition to a market economy in the 
early 1990s has created a series of acute 
problems for monotowns. 
At the top of the list is unemployment — 
jobless rates in these towns are twice as 
high as the national average in Russia. In 
addition, these towns were designed to 
accommodate the industry that supports 
them, rather than with the well-being 
of their residents in mind. Problems of 
pollution, and the lack of infrastructure, 
health and education are recurrent. To 
make matters worse, these towns are 
often situated in far-flung corners of the 
country, with exorbitant airfares making it 
impossible for people to travel. If they do 
finally make it on a plane, it often means 
they're leaving for good! 
Origin of monotowns 
Around 13.2 million inhabitants — almost 
one in ten Russians - live and work in 
one of these 319 factory towns. Whatever 
their differences, they have one thing 
in common — their livelihood is entirely 
dependent on a single company or 
consortium, which employs at least a 
quarter of the population. They have all 
been formed around factories, major 
industrial forestry centres and the 
availability of raw material deposits (gold, 
iron, coal, oil, gas, apatite, etc.). In the case 
of Pikalyovo, the town and its cement 
factory were built in 1935, in the vicinity 
of the station of the same name, where 
deposits of limestone and cement clay 
had been discovered, five years earlier. 
The first Russian factory towns were 
built in the eighteenth century, in the 
wake of reforms by Tsar Peter the Great, 
who encouraged linen manufacturing 
and industrial forges. The second wave 
of rapid development took place in the 
nineteenth century, with the emergence 
of textile mills and the development of 
light industry. But most of these towns 
were established in the 1930s, as part of 
Joseph Stalin's grandiose industrialization 
plans, which focused mainly on defence. 
Today, there are more than 400 large 
enterprises in monotowns — including 
Russia's largest coal producer, the Siberian 
Coal Energy Company (SUEK); the metal 
and mining companies, Severstal and 
Mechel; and the world leader in diamond 
mining, Alrosa. The number also includes 
state-owned enterprises, like Rostec, 
the industrial conglomerate, which 
manufactures and exports high-technology 
industrial products for military and civil 
use, and the Rosatom State Atomic Energy 
Corporation (ROSATOM), the nuclear 
energy company, among others. 
There are factory towns all over Russia, 
but they are mainly concentrated in 
Siberia and the Urals region. There 
are twenty-four of them in Kemerovo 
oblast, for example, fifteen in Sverdlovsk 
oblast, and fourteen in the autonomous 
okrug[district] of Khantis-Mansis. Some of 
them have fewer than 1,000 inhabitants, 
like the mining village of Beringovsky, 
Russia's easternmost town. Others 
have populations in the hundreds of 
thousands, like Togliatti, home to the 
country’s automobile industry, with 
712,000 inhabitants, and Naberezhnye 
Chelny, where Kamaz heavy-duty trucks 
are manufactured, with a population of 
517,000. Most monotowns, however — 
around 216 of them — have no more than 
50,000 inhabitants. 
New strategy 
The problems facing Russia’s monotowns 
is one of the main threats to the social 
and political stability of the country.

After the Pikalyovo crisis, the state 
government drew up a list of these 
towns, which experts classified into 
three categories — towns with the most 
complex socio-economic conditions ( red 
zone, consisting of ninety-four towns); 
towns at risk of deterioration of their 
socio-economic situation (amber zone, 
with 154 towns), and towns with a stable 
socio-economic situation (green zone, 
with seventy-one towns). 
 
In 2014, the government adopted a strategy 
for the development of monotowns, 
based mainly on the diversification of their 
economies, investment and the creation 
of new jobs. It called on Russia's state 
development bank, VEB, which finances 
large-scale projects to develop the country’s 
infrastructure, industry, social activity, and 
technological potential. The bank was 
instructed to set up financial instruments, 
primarily to aid red-zone factory towns 
to emerge from their crises. With this aim, 
the bank created a fund specifically for the 
development of monotowns. 
A copper-smelting workshop at 
the Nornickel factory in Norilsk, Russia. 
Once the strategy was in place, teams 
of representatives from the monotowns 
received training in investment and 
entrepreneurship. This training was 
provided by a top private business 
school, in Skolkovo, Russia's answer to 
Silicon Valley.

The state pitches in 
Today, the Monocities Development 
Fund works with teams of entrepreneurs, 
municipal and regional administrators. 
Most of the factory towns have 
developed and approved development 
programmes that take into account 
their particular territorial, climatic, socio- 
economic and production features 
— these are integrated into regional 
strategic development plans. 
The Fund also provides the regions with 
the money needed for the projects, 
implemented by local and national 
enterprises, in cooperation with the 
municipal authorities. It contributes 
resources and skills, monitors spending, 
and shares best practices. In 2016-2017, 
it concluded twenty-nine co-financing 
agreements with the regions to attract 
investment projects worth 14.3 billion 
roubles (over $217 million), for the 
reconstruction of infrastructure. In the 
long term, it is expected to invest more 
than 106 billion roubles (over $1.6 billion) 
in factory towns. 
A priority programme for the “Integrated 
Development of Single-Industry Towns” 
came into force at the federal level 
in 2016. Aimed at creating small and 
medium-sized enterprises, or individual, 
one-person businesses, linked to new 
activities, the programme is expected 
to generate some 230,000 jobs.

For Pikalyovo, for example, this would 
mean that more than 1,700 jobs of various 
kinds — the production of greenhouse 
vegetables, sportswear, furniture, etc. 
— are expected to be created by 2030. 
The development plan also provides 
for an investment of 20 billion roubles 
($303 million) in the town’s economy. 
Another significant privilege is that 
areas of advanced socio-economic 
development have been created, where 
companies benefit from unprecedented 
tax advantages. The incentives include 
reductions in taxes on corporate income, 
property taxes and mining royalties, and 
also on insurance premiums. By the end 
of 2018, sixty-three such territories had 
been established in factory cities, with a 
total of over 200 companies registered. 
Corporations lend 
a hand 
The state alone cannot solve the 
problems of Russia's monotowns, 
however. Large companies have also lent 
a hand. In 2017, Nornickel, a mining and 
smelting company, laid an internet fibre- 
optic cable worth 2.5 billion roubles (over 
$38 million) in Norilsk, a city situated 
300 kilometres north of the Arctic circle. 
In 2018, CC Kolmar LLC, a coal-mining 
and processing company, undertook to 
develop regional tourism in Neryungri, 
a town in Yakutia, and co-invested in the 
reconstruction of the local airport. 
In addition, large corporations have 
started to promote green industry. 
In 2008, Taneko, the oil and natural gas 
company in Nizhnekamsk, Tatarstan, 
invested in the development of a Single 
andl ey TT. p_——   
Maximum Allowable Pollutant Emission 
Project, an automated air pollution 
monitoring system which has since been 
regarded as something of a standard for 
controlling harmful emissions. In 2016, 
Nornickel shut down the oldest and most 
polluting nickel plant in Norilsk, reducing 
harmful emissions by thirty per cent. 
In 2017, Mechel installed collectors 
that capture ninety-eight per cent of 
the dust and gas in its coal enrichment 
plant in Neryungri. And Kolmar has built 
closed-circuit enrichment plants, which 
recycle waste water for reuse in the 
production process. 
The tangible results of all these measures 
are expected by 2025. Meanwhile, in the 
first half of 2019, the Fund will already 
be announcing the list of the eighteen 
towns with sustainable economies that 
no longer classify as monotowns. The 
leading candidate is Cherepovets, a 
former steel manufacturing centre with 
a population of 318,000. In 2017, a major 
mineral fertilizer production unit was set 
up here by PhosAgro. Twenty thousand 
individual companies have also been 
established here, employing one in four 
of the active labour force. 
Russian journalist Ivan Nesterov has 
worked on promoting the integrated 
development of South Yakutia, a large 
investment project, between 2008 
and 2018. He has also been involved in 
mobilizing investment for socio-economic 
development projects in the Far East.

Havana is finalizing 
preparations for a grand 
celebration of the 500th 
anniversary of its founding, in 
November 2019. Emblematic 
buildings in the historic 
centre of the Cuban capital 
are being restored. An 
exceptional renaissance has 
been underway for the past 
three decades, driven by the 
commitment of its inhabitants, 
the determination of one 
unyielding man, and a strong 
political will. ©

“What the heart demands, the hand 
performs.’ This proverb, engraved in 
Chinese ideograms on the roof of one 
of the most magnificent buildings in 
Havana, expresses the love that its 
inhabitants have for their city. “A land 
of passage for so many years, people 
of the most diverse origins from Africa, 
Europe, China, Yucatan have met here 
in a kaleidoscopic amalgam that has 
produced our unique but varied ethnic, 
ethical and aesthetic identity,” wrote 
the Cuban author, Manuel Pereira, in his 
article, Enchanted seashell: a portrait 
of Old Havana, published in the Courier 
in July 1984. 
That was two years after the inscription of 
the historic centre of the Cuban capital on 
UNESCO's World Heritage List. Old Havana 
comprises of more than 3,000 buildings, 
housing 50,000 people today. 
  
 
A scene from everyday life in Havana, 
against the backdrop of the Capitolio, 2015. 
  
About a decade later, in 1993, the state 
adopted a decree, making the city centre 
a priority preservation area. A Master 
Plan for the restoration of Old Havana 
was quickly drafted, overseen by the 
Office of the City Historian of Havana 
(see our interview, p. 18). 
The effects of climate and urban growth 
have taken their toll on the old quarter, 
which has suffered severe deterioration 
since the beginning of the twentieth 
century. Cuba has rallied together to save 
its city.”It is impossible to rescue 465 years 
of stone overnight, but Old Havana will 
be saved. Its splendid face will be restored 
and be converted, not into a lifeless 
museum but into a museum that is living 
and can be lived in," wrote Pereira, thirty- 
five years ago. Time has proved him right. 
Based on a self-management strategy 
and adopting an approach that 
encompasses heritage, society, education 
and culture, the Cuban plan has 
become a model for the restoration and 
enhancement of historical urban centres, 
particularly in Latin American countries. 
Recognized by international experts, the 
plan has won over twenty-five national 
and global awards and figures on 
UNESCO’s list of best practices in world 
heritage management. 
One feature of the plan is that it involved 
the local population in the rehabilitation 
of their quarter. Over the years, more than 
14,000 jobs, calling for different degrees 
of expertise, have been created by the 
Office of the City Historian for residents of 
the old town and nearby communities. 
An education system has been set up 
specifically to meet the needs of the plan. 
It integrates the University of Havana, 
founded in 1728, and three specialist 
schools, to offer training to students aged 
16 to 21. Twelve subjects are taught there, 
over a two-year period. To date, around 
1,500 young people have been trained in 
vocations related to the restoration and 
rehabilitation of cultural heritage.

### 367837: La Havane: quand tout le monde met la main à la pâte

The Museum Classroom project brings 
primary schools and museums together 
to teach young children about the history 
of Old Havana. This is one of many ways 
to raise public awareness of heritage 
values among people of all ages. The City 
Historian's office, which has established 
these values, also promotes them. 
Thousands of families have benefited 
from cultural tours of the city, watched 
Havana Walks on television or read 
the monthly series, Habana Nuestra 
(Our Havana), in print and online. 
Once subsidized by the state, the 
restoration of the historic centre now 
benefits from a system of self-financing, 
with the development of a local economy. 
Companies and tourism agencies 
were started to create a gastronomic, 
commercial and hotel network in the 
priority protection area, compatible 
with the cultural interests of the quarter. 
Museums, galleries and theatres have also 
been established in the most beautiful 
buildings, attracting a large number of 
national and foreign visitors — tourism 
is one of the most important sources of 
finance for the restoration of Old Havana. 
Since the quality of life of its inhabitants is 
one of the main criteria of the restoration 
plan, a significant part of the resources 
it generates are used to finance social 
institutions. These include the Dona 
Leonor Pérez Cabrera maternity hospital, 
the Santiago Ramon y Cajal geriatric 
centre, which provides specialized care 
to around 15,000 elderly people, and 
the former Belén convent, which houses 
the Office for Humanitarian Affairs. 
This department focuses on the most 
vulnerable members of society, including 
victims of natural disasters, such as the 
frequent hurricanes. Here they have access 
to a pharmacy, a physiotherapy centre, 
an ophthalmology clinic, and also a food 
store, a hairdresser and a barber. Socio- 
cultural activities and meetings for people 
of all ages are organized here, including 
workshops on the environment, traditional 
medicine, and other topics of interest. 
The development of squares, green 
areas, pedestrian streets and recreational 
spaces, and municipal services like street 
lighting, gas supply, waste collection and 
the cleaning of public spaces are all an 
integral part of this massive reconstruction 
plan. The most fundamental aspects - like 
making sure that people living in buildings 
under renovation are not rendered 
homeless — have not been neglected 
either. Through the plan, more than 
11,000 families have so far benefited from 
a decent roof over their heads.

Eusebio Leal: 
Havana, 
MON amour 
Interview by Lucia Iglesias Kuntz, 
UNESCO 
When you speak of Havana, you 
speak of Eusebio Leal Spengler. 
Which other city has its own 
personal historian? On the eve 
of the 500th anniversary of the 
founding of the Cuban capital, 
the City Historian of Havana - 
who has been in charge of the 
restoration of its historic city 
centre for over thirty years - 
takes us on a journey through 
its streets and monuments, 
showing us its strength, its 
beauty ... and its ailments. 
This year, Havana celebrates five centuries 
of its existence. How is the city faring? 
If | were to put myself in the city’s place, 
| think the ailments you have are what 
you feel when you've lived so long. Five 
centuries is little in comparison with 
ancient cities like Athens in Greece, or 
Istanbul in Turkey. But it’s a lot for us 
in our Americas — with the exception 
of the great pre-Hispanic cities like 
Cusco, the Inca city of Peru, the Aztec 
Tenochtitlan in Mexico, or the Mayan 
cities of Central America. Havana was 
part of the new wave that began with 
the Spanish conquest and colonization 
at the beginning of the sixteenth 
century. The Cuban cities were founded 
immediately after the cities of Santo 
Domingo, La Vega, San Pedro de Macoris 
and Santiago de los Caballeros, in the 
Dominican Republic.   
Unusual flooding caused by 
climate change threatens the 
Malecén, Havana's famous 
waterfront promenade.

| believe these cities have reached a 
noble antiquity, and also show the aches 
and pains of all the historical moments 
they have lived through. In our case, it is 
fundamentally the new era that began 
sixty years ago with the victory of the 
Revolution - the resistance of the Cuban 
people, of which Havana has been an 
emblem and a symbol. 
The historic centre, Old Havana, has been 
inscribed on the World Heritage List since 
1982, for its “outstanding universal value’, 
that any visitor can appreciate. But what, 
from your personal point of view, is the 
value of Havana? 
The range of values is very large. There 
is the symbolic value — it is the capital 
of the nation, the country’s head. But at 
the same time, it is very representative 
of all the cultural, intellectual, political, 
historical and social values of the Cuban 
people. It is also a catalogue of the most 
beautiful and dazzling architecture 
that the island has ever produced, 
with features that can also be found in 
Camagliey, Santiago de Cuba, or Trinidad. 
The Moorish architecture, for example, 
which was influenced by the Hispano- 
Islamic tradition, is very characteristic 
of the historical centre. Then, there is 
also the timid but passionate baroque 
architecture of the Havana Cathedral 
— which is more like a state of mind, a 
kind of feeling or atmosphere that the 
Cuban writer, Alejo Carpentier, so vividly 
described in his great novel, El siglo de las 
luces (Explosion in a Cathedral), 1962.

There is also the neoclassical city, with El 
Templete, the monument to the founding 
of Havana. It is rather a small-scale model, 
that has been reproduced with great 
originality in other Cuban cities, like 
Matanzas and Cienfuegos. 
And then there is the eclectic city in 
Centro Habana that is so impressive 
- filled with gargoyles, Atlanteans, 
extraordinary figures, imaginary 
creatures. The Art Nouveau - the Palacio 
Cueto in the Plaza Vieja — and then the 
considerable splendour of the Art Deco 
— as in the Emilio Bacardi building - are 
almost subversively introduced there, 
making the architectural dialogue even 
more intense. 
Finally, there is the Havana of modernity, 
which reaches the height of its splendour 
with the work of the Viennese architect, 
Richard Neutra — the Casa de Schulthess, 
one of the most beautiful houses in the 
residential quarter where Quinta Avenida 
[Fifth Avenue] takes us. 
Havana is a living city, of wisdom and 
of memory. In this lively metropolis, we 
find the acropolis of knowledge that is 
the beautiful university campus - and 
the great monumental cemetery, the 
necropolis, is beautiful too. 
Could you tell us what the November 2019 
celebrations will consist of? 
The city government has developed an 
extensive commemoration project. The 
plan we drew up in the Office of the City 
Historian of Havana, which we designed 
specifically for the historical zone, is 
harmoniously incorporated into that 
project. Our task is to promote the idea 
of preserving the memory of the city, not 
only when it comes to commemorating 
its fifth centenary, but also in everyday 
life. I've dedicated more than three 
decades to this, and | have to confess 
that sometimes it felt as though | was 
preaching that cause in the desert. 
Currently, we have developed a series of 
events, radio and television programmes, 
and the publication of a number of 
different works. We also continue to work 
simultaneously on the restoration of the 
city’s monumental symbols — the main 
example of this will be the completion of 
major work on El Capitolio [the national 
Capitol building], the Castillo de Atarés 
and other iconic buildings in the heart of 
Havana. We will remember and celebrate 
not only the story of the act of the city’s 
founding, but also its history and culture. 
20 | The UNESCO Courier * April-June 2019 
I would like to emphasize that culture 
is the key word in our master plan for 
the rehabilitation and restoration of Old 
Havana. Any development project that 
ignores culture, leads only to decadence. 
On the other hand, the human factor is 
just as important. | would like to ensure 
that these commemorations generate a 
passion among the people. If they don't 
touch people's hearts, all we will have 
done is made a few official speeches, 
moved some stones and printed a 
few articles. 
Would you say that cultural heritage has 
more to do with everyday life, and is not 
just about museums? 
Of course | believe that museums are 
essential for history, memory and culture. 
The Museo de la Ciudad [City Museum] is 
of vital importance for the entire nation, 
and not just for the people of Havana. But 
| have also fought against museumization 
and defended the cause of a living city. 
One of the challenges facing World 
Heritage cities is the difficulty of 
reconciling tourism — sometimes on a 
massive scale — and the preservation of 
heritage values. Has Havana had to face 
these contradictions? 
We must ensure that Havana does 
not disappear under a tide of tourists. 
But at the same time, | believe that 
tourism — a necessary activity and an 
important economic factor — should not 
be demonized. In the case of Cuba, given 
its isolation, it is also an opportunity to 
initiate a direct dialogue with visitors 
from all around the world. That is 
something wonderful. 
While the rehabilitation is completed, 
many buildings in Old Havana still 
remain inhabited. 
In many cases, the buildings that were 
in ruins, and that we have restored, were 
inhabited by very poor families. This is still 
the case for many of them. The answer 
has been to provide safe and dignified 
shelter for thousands of people, offer 
education for young people and create 
safe jobs for adults. We have tried to 
implement what UNESCO defined, at the 
time, as “a unique project’, something 
different. Unique does not mean better. 
We do not claim to have done better than 
other parts of the world. Rather, it was 
done according to our own experience. 
In other words, in spite of the setbacks 
and mistakes we suffered in the search for 
a rehabilitation model, we finally found it 
(seep. 17). 
You have also put a lot of effort into 
restoring the Malecén, Havana's 
emblematic avenue that stretches along 
the coastline. You have defined it as 
“Havana's smile”. 
| must confess that | have almost lost 
the battle against the sea, a battle that 
could only be fought by Neptune with 
his trident. | cannot forget the images of 
the devastating waves crashing against 
the Castillo del Morro, which has stood 
in front of the sea for centuries. These are 
Dantesque visions that are repeated at 
every step of a cyclone. 
The tornado that hit us recently, during 
the night of January 27 and 28 [2019], 
causing the death of several people and 
wounding some 200, reminds us that 
the time has come to understand that 
climate change is a hidden threat to the 
elegant silhouette of the Malecén, which 
will always be that beautiful smile that 
Havana gives to the sea, and that we have 
a duty to protect. 
We have lost the battle against the sea, 
but we must win our fight against climate 
change. Great challenges and new 
adventures await us. 
Don't you ever tire of working for Havana? 
It's true that everything has always led 
me to Havana. It’s really been many 
years of work, hard work. | don't regret 
it. If there were another life than the one 
we know here on earth, my soul would 
wander eternally through Havana. It has 
been the greatest of my loves, the best 
of my passions, and the greatest of my 
challenges. | really do not know why 
| always mysteriously return to it, in light 
and silence, in life and in dreams.

Mehdi Ben Cheikh, interviewed 
by Anissa Barrak 
Long considered marginal, 
street art today represents a 
major trend that democratizes 
access to art and infuses urban 
spaces with a new social and 
economic dynamic. In the 
heart of the island of Djerba, 
Tunisia, some 100 artists have 
illuminated the small town 
of Erriadh — now known as 
Djerbahood - with about 
250 murals. Mehdi Ben Cheikh, 
a French-Tunisian gallery owner 
who initiated this promising 
project, tells us how the idea 
continues to grow. 
How was the Djerbahood project born 
and why did you choose Erriadh as 
a location for it? 
In 2013, I had completed the Tour Paris 
13 project, which received exceptional 
media coverage. This high-rise building 
in the 13th arrondissement of the French 
capital, was condemned to destruction 
and was demolished in April 2014. But 
before the deadline, about 100 artists 
of eighteen nationalities volunteered 
to transform it into a collective work of 
art. Facades, common areas and thirty- 
six apartments were taken over by the 
masters of street art. These works, though 
ephemeral, are now available on the Web, 
to a huge audience around the world. 
This success encouraged me to set up 
another project that | had been working 
on for some time — organizing a street- 
art event in Tunisia, which would make 
people talk about the country in positive 
terms. Erriadh, on the island of Djerba, 
seemed to me the ideal place — with 
its luminosity, its beautiful traditional 
architecture, its urban development 
structured around a central square, its

history, the legendary hospitality of its 
inhabitants. Let's not forget that if Djerba 
is indeed, as we believe, the land of the 
Lotus-Eaters of Homer's Odyssey, Ulysses 
was its most famous visitor! 
Formerly known as Hara Essaghira, 
Erriadh is located near the famous 
Ghriba Synagogue, one of the oldest in 
the world. A Jewish pilgrimage site to 
this day, it was built by the exiles who 
fled Jerusalem after Nebuchadnezzar 
Il destroyed Solomon's temple around 
586 BC. Its population was therefore 
mainly composed of Jews and Muslims, 
who lived there together, as evidenced 
by its five synagogues (two of which are 
still in operation) and its two mosques. 
But following the massive departure of 
the Jewish population from the island in 
the 1960s, the small town fell into a state 
of lethargy - remaining at the margins 
of tourism, the island’s main economic 
activity. Even though it’s only six minutes 
from an international airport!

Did you face any difficulties getting 
the project accepted locally? 
| quickly obtained permission from the 
national authorities to start work in 
the public space. The country was in a 
period of transition after the revolution, 
municipal authorities had been dissolved 
throughout the country and replaced 
by provisional committees, but in 
Erriadh there wasn't even a provisional 
committee. So the project was started 
with private donations. With the support 
of some hotel owners in Djerba, | was also 
able to get a financial contribution from 
the Ministry of Tourism. 
As for the inhabitants, we had to 
negotiate with them at first, of course. 
They didn’t know what we were going 
to do with the spaces they owned. 
We explained the idea, the process, and 
it was mainly the women who persuaded 
their men to let us go ahead with it. 
Once the first works were completed, 
the inhabitants began to ask us to 
decorate their houses. 
Suddenly, Erriadh woke up. It has 
become a destination and a transit 
point for thousands of tourists (the taxi 
drivers were thrilled!), many restaurants 
and several galleries have opened, and 
property prices have risen sharply. The 
lives of the inhabitants have completely 
changed. That's what matters most 
to me.

Mural by Tunisian artist Wissem el Abed. 
You brought in about 100 renowned 
artists. What persuaded them to join 
the project? 
The project makes sense. What interests 
artists is to create, and to share their work 
with as many people as possible. The 
contracts signed with them concerned 
only image rights. Our objective is to 
promote the reputation of artists and 
not to earn money directly through 
these events. And there's something for 
everyone — artists, cities, the public. 
The artists represented thirty-four 
different nationalities and produced 
250 murals! Groups of them took turns 
working every week, for a period of three 
months. They were free in their creative 
approach. Of course, we were all aware 
that we shouldn't shock the inhabitants 
with images of naked bodies, for 
example. It was necessary to respect the 
population, its culture. But beyond that, 
they were free to do as they pleased. Each 
artist interacted with the space according 
to his or her own inspiration. 
  
  
Since this experience, the artist's place 
has gained more respect in Djerba. The 
inhabitants have understood not just the 
economic benefits that this art represents 
for them, but also the essence of the 
artistic approach. They met the artists, 
they forged close ties with them. The 
artist is no longer perceived as the village 
madman, marginal, but as someone 
gifted — who creates a structured 
imaginary universe and who, at the same 
time, can contribute concretely to the 
improvement of daily life. 
Some people tend to think that street 
art can only succeed in a country where 
there's already a cultural and artistic 
dynamic — in other words, in the West. 
Djerbahood has proven the opposite. 
It shows that not everything is done 
elsewhere. That any place in the world 
can become, at some point, the capital of 
street art, even if it's located at the far end 
of anisland.

In what condition are the works that have 
been in Djerbahood since 2014? 
Very few of them remain. The great 
difference in temperature between the 
winter and summer, the humidity, the 
lime smeared on the walls — all this has 
affected the conservation of the works. 
In the new project | am launching in Paris 
in April 2019, we use resistant materials 
like marine varnish, and restoration is 
part of the plan in the city’s specifications. 
It is in this spirit that | would like to 
perpetuate the Djerbahood project, 
which enters its second phase this year. 
My objective is to make Djerba a huge 
street-art lab — like Ibiza, in Spain, is the 
island of musical creation and electro. 
How can street art be defined? 
Street art is an appropriation of urban 
space through an artistic approach, 
whatever its nature. It includes as many 
styles and worlds as there are artists. 
It goes from graffiti to gestural or 
chromatic figuration, from sound and 
light installation to physical performance. 
Artists play with urban infrastructure, 
with architecture, with light and shadows. 
Graffiti can measure seventy centimetres 
or as many metres high! Regardless of the 
medium used, the most important thing 
is to take over the streets. 
This kind of artistic expression has always 
existed — the Lascaux cave that dates 
back to the Palaeolithic period is proof. 
But street art is now booming, particularly 
in Latin America, the United States, 
Europe and the Arab world. Street artists 
el Seed, Shoof and KOOM - to name just 
a few artists of Tunisian origin — have now 
acquired international reputations and 
embody the exceptional dynamism of 
this art form that wants to build bridges 
between people. 
El Seed, for example, has transformed 
the face of Kairouan, a Tunisian World 
Heritage site, and paints his calligraffiti 
all over the world — South Africa, Canada, 
South Korea, Dubai, Egypt, US, France. 
Hosni Hertelli, whose pseudonym 
Shoof means “look” in Arabic, has also 
resurrected traditional calligraphy in his 
own way — through painting on ancient 
Tunisian facades, but also through 
music and light. His show White Spirit 
attracted thousands of spectators in 
Australia and France. Musician and 
calligrapher Mohamed Koumenji 
(KOOM) combines these two arts in 
his plastic and luminous works, while 
drawing inspiration from Sufi tradition 
and incorporating modern technologies. 
An example that showcases his great 
talent is his multidisciplinary creation, 
On the Roads of Arabia, co-organized 
by Paris’ [founded by Cheikh] Galerie 
Itinerrance at the Louvre Abu Dhabi in 
November 2018. 
Bringing art to the people rather than 
confining it to the places reserved 
for it — is that what street art is about? 
Street art was not created with the 
intention of bringing art to the people, 
but in reality, that’s what it does. 
Because it’s practised in public spaces, 
it's offered to people free of charge, at 
street corners. It's the most democratic 
artistic movement there is, but also the 
most appropriate for its time - relayed 
on the Web through photos and videos 
generally taken by the artists themselves, 
its reputation is based on the recognition 
of the greatest numbers, through social 
media. Once the artist is recognized, she 
or he can choose to exhibit in galleries, 
which link street art to art in places 
dedicated specifically to art. 
  
Therefore, it's a whole system parallel 
to contemporary art that’s being 
established. | have mentioned the project 
launched in Paris in April 2019. It’s on 
Boulevard Vincent Auriol, where we are 
creating a real museum of a new type. 
Everything has been thought about - 
the lighting with projectors using solar 
energy, the sound system, the durability 
of the works. Street art does not have 
to chase museums to be shown - it 
plays with the city, it's created under the 
public's eye, it has exchanges with the 
urban population, and it is accessible to 
everyone for free. 
And anyone can become a street artist! 
But in the absence of gallery owners or 
museum curators, isn't there a risk that 
this art will alter cultural heritage sites? 
In Kairouan, for instance, the domes have 
recently been painted. 
We can indeed question the aesthetic 
value of certain works that emerge in 
the public space. But we can also say 
that instead of white domes, some of our 
mausoleums now have colourful domes! 
Even if it's more or less well done, | think 
that in a few years'time, we will end up 
with interesting results — street art is an 
art that is constantly being renewed. 
There is no need to fear art. Sometimes 
we want to pass off certain creations 
as art, when they don’t deserve the 
name, because they serve abominable 
ideologies. But these are extremely 
rare exceptions. Art has never been a 
threat to anyone, quite the contrary. 
| am convinced it’s the best weapon 
against obscurantism.

### 367840: La ville, un cirque sous un chapiteau étoilé

Ine city, 
a circus under a starlit tent 
Thomas B. Reverdy 
 
The French writer Thomas 
B. Reverdy has almost always 
chosen urban spaces as the 
setting for his novels. Obsessed 
by the “unbearable presence of 
absence” in our dehumanized 
cities, he imagines the 
emergence of tiny resistances. 
“These are cities!" The words, famous, 
are from Rimbaud. This is the sentence 
that opens one of the llluminations, in 
which the poet describes not a city, 
but a circus tent, its machines and its 
inhabitants-acrobats, the myriad spaces, 
acts, routes and noises that populate 
it, chaotic, blind to each other, and yet 
regulated like a music score. Around 
1872, three years after the posthumous 
publication of Baudelaire’s Le Spleen 
de Paris [Paris Spleen], the city had thus 
become an image. It could be used as a 
metaphor, and this metaphor did not say 
what a city is, but what it evokes. Not the 
production, the commerce, but already 
the displacements, the anonymity, the 
trades being lost and the poverty that 
is suddenly noticeable in the cracks of 
apparent wealth. Since the island of 
Thomas More, most utopias are urban. 
All dystopias are. The city is an imaginary 
place. A show. A circus. 
Travelling places 
| have almost always placed the setting 
of my plots in the city. | should say | 
have moved it to the city. Cities make it 
possible to be everywhere, both at home 
and abroad, and this displacement is 
fundamental. It is the step sideways, the 
oblique vision, it is the gap in reality, the 
displacement that suddenly creates space 
for the deployment of fiction. When, in 
24 | The UNESCO Courier * April-June 2019 
my second novel, | moved part of my 
plot to Brooklyn, opposite Manhattan, 
| was obeying this need to ward off my 
subject. | distanced it twice: first to New 
York, which | knew well from going 
there frequently, but where | did not live; 
and then to Brooklyn, which is not the 
New York we imagine, from France. This 
decentring was certainly fundamental 
for me, it gradually tipped me towards 
the novel - before that, my first story was 
very autobiographical. 
But this shift had an unexpected 
effect: it imposed a space on me. As | 
intentionally moved away from more 
familiar territories, | suddenly had to 
increase my documentation, verifying 
details, the effects of reality, images. 
| discovered, at the heart of fiction, at 
the heart of its fabrication, a complex 
entanglement of reality and words: 
| needed the displacement that the 
foreign city offered me, but as soon as 
the story was situated, | needed reality 
to feed it. Not brute reality — otherwise 
| would have remained in Paris, at 
home — but mediatized reality, images, 
symbols, fragments, words. Starting from 
memories, but also from testimonies, 
photos, stories, novels and films, maps, 
| had to recompose a space, make it 
“real”, give back this city its circus life. 
Blind to each other 
| have the greatest admiration for writers 
whose imaginations unfold in the great 
natural spaces, like Cormac McCarthy, but 
I had other reasons, for myself, to prefer 
the space of the city to move my novels 
in. This is because | also had the idea that 
modern fiction must account for our 
blind journeys and our anonymity. Today 
in Paris, | live in a building where people 
greet each other by lowering their heads 
when they meet in the elevator. In the 
Metro, most of the time, they scarcely 
dare to look each other in the face.

### 367840: La ville, un cirque sous un chapiteau étoilé

It is rare to be able to make an entire trip 
around the city without coming across at 
least one person who is talking to himself 
in a disturbing way, one or two beggars, a 
visibly sociopathic and perhaps psychotic 
individual, and at some stations, a 
drug addict at the end of the platform, 
smoking crack. Sometimes, someone 
you've seen before. A person we may 
have come across in the neighbourhood 
or on the Metro at the same time. But 
we'll never know what her name is, or 
what she does for a living, or why she 
looks happy that day. This beggar who 
speaks loudly and chooses his words, with 
his slight foreign accent, where does he 
come from and how did he find his way 
here? These young people who appear 
disguised, are they going to a party? To 
a concert? What are they studying? Who 
do they dream of becoming and will they 
make it? These are the modern fictions. 
We are an anonymous people, advancing 
in our miniscule lives, blind to each other. 
Our existences timed by the schedules 
of the suburban trains, still resist a little, 
deep in our hearts, the city-machine, but 
we must admit that a simple encounter 
has become a miracle. We can no 
longer write the lives of Julien Sorel, 
Frédéric Moreau or Bel-Ami' today. 
There were the terrorist attacks, too. 
It may perhaps be because of that. 
September 112. All the names engraved 
since in black stone, to give a name to the 
nameless. Today's heroes are anonymous. 
1. Names of the protagonists of French novels: 
Julien Sorel in The Red and the Black (1830) by Stendhal; 
Frédéric Moreau in Sentimental Education (1869) by 
Gustave Flaubert; Bel-Ami is the nickname of the main 
character of Guy de Maupassant’s novel of the same 
name (1885).

Fragile, like a human 
memory 
| returned to New York in 2008 to 
write LEnvers du monde (Towards the 
World). The action is set in the crater of 
Ground Zero, in 2003. A racist murder is 
committed, at least it is assumed that it 
is racist. We follow the characters who 
revolve around this story as if around 
an empty centre, an incomprehensible 
absence, and it is obviously the shadow 
of the twin towers that looms. The city 
here offers another of its characteristics, 
which could be called its geology: the city 
is made up of strata. It forgets them in its 
use, but the places bear the traces. 
The city makes History part of our daily lives. 
2003 was the time when the United States 
was transitioning from the punitive war in 
Afghanistan to the preventive war in Iraq. 
It was also the year that Daniel Libeskind’s 
magnificent project was accepted. The 
Ground Zero crater, historic and symbolic, 
where the towers of the World Trade Center 
had turned inside out like a glove in the 
ground, this place laden with meaning 
became a strange and transient place — it 
was no longer the esplanade of the Twin 
Towers and it was not yet the Freedom 
Tower. A place of memory as fragile as a 
human memory. It seemed to me it was 
the work of art today, to establish this kind 
of place that is also a moment. The work of 
Libeskind, admirable in its intelligence, also 
says this in its own way by digging, at the 
site of the vanished towers, those endless 
shafts of shadows that imprint, in the space, 
the place of the absent towers. 
26 The UNESCO Courier * April-June 2019 
  
Because that’s what mourning is, like 
memory, like ruin, and the cursed material 
of the writer, or of any artist, this is what it 
is: the unbearable presence of absence. 
| started tracking it. In Japan, post- 
Fukushima? where | lived to write Les 
Evaporés (The Evaporated), in which a 
man who deliberately disappears crosses 
the path of the damned uprooted by 
the disaster. | tracked it down to Detroit, 
Michigan, where an entire metropolis 
was sinking into bankruptcy, two-thirds 
of its inhabitants fleeing, swept away by 
the economic and financial crisis of 2008. 
Detroit, the machine city, the city of Ford 
and General Motors (GM), the Metropolis* 
of the American dream that devoured 
its children. Detroit that was suffocating 
without inhabitants, the first city of this 
size to experience this, like the canary in 
the coal mine, warned those who accused 
banks and the business community of 
being irresponsible. Detroit, whose ruins, 
like those of another distant civilization, 
of factories, supermarkets, schools and 
theatres, invaded by vegetation, resembled 
a sort of tragic Planet of the Apes®. 
3. Reference to the catastrophic nuclear accident in 
Fukushima, Japan, in March 2011. 
4. Metropolis is a sci-fi film by Austrian-born German- 
American director Fritz Lang, made in 1927 and 
inscribed on UNESCO's Memory of the World register. 
A dystopian vision of the twenty-first-century city. 
5. The Planet of the Apes is a science-fiction novel 
(1963) by the French writer Pierre Boulle, which 
inspired American director Tim Burton's film of the 
same name in 2001, and also series of films produced 
by Twentieth Century Fox, the US film studio. The 
American media franchise also covers television 
series, books, comics, and video games. 
The anguished and prophetic dream of 
a planet rid of us. 
| didn’t go to Detroit while | was writing 
the novel. There were countless photos, 
stories by journalists like Charlie LeDuff 
of the Detroit Free Press, and others. 
Getting information, knowing what was 
happening, where to place things, was 
not a problem. On the contrary, Detroit 
was documented to saturation. The 
problem was getting out. 
Resisting the charm 
of the Pied Piper 
One of my ideas was the analogy of 
this automobile crisis with the German 
medieval tale of The Pied Piper of Hamelin 
—avillage in the throes of the plague calls 
in a magic flute player, who takes the rats 
far away from the village and drowns 
them in the river. But when he comes 
back, they refuse to pay him: they don't 
have the money. The ruthless Pied Piper 
then casts a spell on all the children of the 
village and takes them away with him. 
He drowns them in the river. 
At the beginning of the twentieth 
century, the Pied Piper of industrial 
capitalism attracted all the poor workers 
in the rural south of the US, many of them 
blacks, to Detroit, with the promise of a 
bright future. At that time, the Pied Piper 
sold houses and cars on credit.

Panoramic photomontage from the 
Les présences désagrégées (Disaggregated 
attendances) series, Paris 1998-2000, 
by Italian artist Silvana Reggiardo. 
 
But when people did not want to pay the 
price, when they rebelled during the 1967 
Detroit riots, the Pied Piper was offended. 
He left for China with the jobs, and in 
Detroit people fell back into poverty little 
by little. In spite of its cruelty, this tale 
appealed to a child’s imagination. One 
of the stories in the novel, therefore, is 
about a group of runaway children who 
take advantage of the disorganization of 
public transport and schools in the city, to 
live a kind of adventure, in a vacant lot, an 
abandoned school. Something that was 
a little bit like Treasure Island. 
But | had a problem with reality. My 
story was set between two bankruptcies: 
that of Lehman Brothers, 15 September 
2008, and that of General Motors’, 1 June 
2009. These were historical and objective 
milestones. However, the kids couldnt 
survive all that time. | started following 
them on the eve of All Saints’ Day, on 
Devil's Night®: they were setting fire to 
an abandoned house. A few days later, 
they run away. It's early November. 
6. Treasure Island (1883) is an adventure novel by the 
Scottish writer Robert Louis Stevenson. 
7. Lehman Brothers was a multinational investment 
bank that collapsed, in its 158th year, in September 
2008, triggering a global financial crisis. General 
Motors is a US carmaker, which was placed under US 
bankruptcy protection in June 2009.

Christmas. It’s a reasonable maximum. But 
that forces me to twist the whole reality. 
In the novel, GM is no longer GM, it 
becomes “the Company”. The chronology

in two months. And suddenly, everything 
is clear. The logic of fiction imposes 
itself on reality. If my story of dystopia, 
bankruptcy and urban jungle runs until 
Christmas, then | go into the winter. 
It's cold in Detroit in the winter. And 
suddenly, this city of which | had seen a 
thousand images becomes a bit more 
than a backdrop. It comes alive in an 
organic way. | mentally observe the 
snow falling on the lawns, muffling the 
sound of footsteps. | see the wind rushing 
through the empty windows of vacant 
buildings, whistling as it turns around 
the abandoned houses. | can feel the 
cold with its metallic taste creeping into 
humid clothes that nothing can warm up 
again. | see the halos of street lighting go 
out, replaced by the mysterious glitter 
of the snow under the silvery moon. 
And this Detroit of phantasmagoria, of 
fiction, is no more real than the real one 
— in the real Detroit at that time, people 
were dying every day. But it becomes 
communicable, representable. In the 
machine city, we can once again imagine 
human destinies. Tiny resistances. If the 
story runs until Christmas, it's because 
it's a tale, which doesn’t have to be cruel. 
Maybe the kids will make it. 
And the city becomes a circus once 
again, where the destinies of anonymous 
acrobats play out, without a net, sliding 
from trapeze to trapeze, brushing each 
other without seeing each other, catching 
each other in flight, in the hope of a rest, 
of an encounter, like a miracle at the 
height of man, under the starlit tent.

Under the auspices of UNESCO 
Reviving the spirit of \Y OSU 
In February 2018, UNESCO launched 
the “Revive the Spirit of Mosul” initiative 
at the International Conference for 
the Reconstruction of Iraq in Kuwait. It 
brought the international community 
together under its aegis, to participate 
in the reconstruction of this city, which 
has been decimated by war, looting and 
destruction. This reconstruction must be 
part of Mosul’s history — a plural history, 
at the crossroads of the cultures and 
religions of the Middle East. 
Mosul has seen its heritage ransacked, its 
identity bruised, at the hands of ISIL. The 
destruction targeted places of worship 
(mosques and churches), the shrine of 
Nabi Yunus and the Assyrian and Parthian 
statues and frescoes of the Mosul 
Museum. The city’s library, with its several 
thousand ancient texts, was deliberately 
set aflame. Antiquities were trafficked. 
    
28 The UNESCO Courier = April-June 2019 
The ISIL occupation completely 
devastated Iraq's education system, from 
pre-primary to higher education. When 
subjects such as history or the arts were 
replaced with content designed to incite 
hate, the vast majority of families decided 
to take their children out of school. 
Those who remained were subjected 
to systematic indoctrination, mainly by 
teachers who were forced to relay the 
group's extremist ideology. 
Considering these observations, it is 
not just the cultural heritage that needs 
to be restored, but also dignity and 
memory. UNESCO therefore decided to 
mobilize the international community, 
to propose an initiative that would 
combine heritage, culture and education.

T_T 
It is being deployed in collaboration with 
the Government of Iraq, along these 
three lines, and involves multiple actors 
— neighbouring countries, international 
organizations and the European Union 
(EU). The initiative aims to give a new 
perspective, a new impetus, to Mosul. 
In addition to the restoration of 
monuments and the rehabilitation of 
Mosul’s historic urban fabric, a project 
to rebuild houses in the old city (Mosul 
and Basra), and to train cultural heritage 
professionals, will be implemented 
with the support of the EU. This is 
based on a participatory approach that 
focuses on skills development and job 
creation to promote social cohesion and 
community reconciliation.

Along the same lines, the inventory 
of religious sites damaged by ISIL has 
resulted in a publication that will serve 
as a support for interfaith dialogue 
workshops, permitting the recreation 
of links between communities. An 
emergency plan for the safeguarding of 
intangible heritage in danger and the 
creation of “cultural mobile spaces” for 
displaced persons and host communities 
is being prepared. 
At the same time, the Iragi government 
has called on UNESCO to develop a 
national education strategy for the 
period 2020-2030, in order to rebuild 
the foundations of an education system 
that meets the needs of its population. 
Simultaneously, educational projects are 
being implemented with the purpose of 
preventing the resurgence of extremism 
and recreating the conditions for 
living together.

Two projects will aim to ensure that 
the primary schools in the Old City of 
Mosul are safe places where students 
can flourish, learn and interact with 
others with respect, thus contributing 
to tolerance and peaceful coexistence in 
the long term. 
These projects, supported by Japan and 
the Netherlands, are based on a holistic 
approach that involves children, but 
also teachers, communities, parents 
and educational staff in the prevention 
of extremism. The upgrading of higher 
education will also be a key action in 
rebuilding the country and its system of 
production. Beyond a purely economic 
approach, it is a matter of enabling 
institutions such as Mosul’s university 
library to once again become the 
cultural and intellectual epicentres they 
used to be. 
These different projects pursue the same 
goals: to protect, rebuild and educate. 
Because culture and education are 
the only long-term responses against 
the violence of extremism and its 
destructiveness. This approach is aligned 
with the vision of the Iraqi government, 
as it is up to the Iraqi authorities to 
conduct this initiative locally, while 
UNESCO continues its coordinating role.

Culture: the DNA of cities 
cities in networks 
Learning in cities 
The UNESCO Global Network 
of Learning Cities (GNLC) is an 
international policy-oriented network 
that provides inspiration, know-how 
and best practice. Based on the sharing 
of ideas and solutions between cities, 
the network has a two-fold objective 
- to ensure quality education that is 
inclusive and equitable, with lifelong 
learning opportunities for all; and to 
make cities open to all, safe, resilient 
and sustainable. 
An international conference on 
Learning Cities is held every two years, 
providing a platform for policy dialogue 
and the exchange of best practices. 
The UNESCO Learning City Awards 
are presented on this occasion. At the 
fourth International Conference on 
Learning Cities in Medellin, Colombia, 
in 2019, ten cities are being awarded 
for their exemplary commitment. 
They include Aswan (Egypt), Chengdu 
(China), Heraklion (Greece), Ibadan 
(Nigeria), Medellin (Colombia), 
Melitopol (Ukraine), Petaling Jaya 
(Malaysia), Santiago (Mexico), 
Seodaemun-gu (Republic of Korea), 
and Senderborg (Denmark). 
To highlight just a few examples: 
Chengdu has combined learning with 
thematic city walks; Medellin has 
reintegrated over 4,500 school drop-outs 
into the education system by focusing on 
each individual; Petaling Jaya provides 
free bus services on four city routes, 
which also disseminate information 
through onboard screens. 
Crafts and popular arts, digital arts, design, film, gastronomy, literature, music. 
These are the keys that open the doors to UNESCO's Creative Cities. 
Linked through an ever-expanding network since 2004, these cities rely on creativity 
and the cultural industries, considered strategic factors for sustainable development 
- whether economic, social, cultural or environmental. The network currently includes 
180 member cities in seventy-two countries. It serves as a platform for action for the 
implementation of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development 
at the city level. 
Indeed, among the seventeen objectives of the 2030 Programme, the eleventh 
- “ensuring that cities and human settlements are inclusive, safe, resilient and 
sustainable” — affirms the essential role of culture in urban areas. This is why UNESCO 
launched an international initiative in 2015, which resulted in Culture: Urban Future, 
the UNESCO Global Report on Culture for Sustainable Urban Development (2016). 
It provides a global overview of the safeguarding, conservation and management of 
urban heritage, and the promotion of cultural and creative industries. 
According to British author Charles Landry, who has popularized the concept of 
creative cities since the 1980s, culture is the DNA of cities. “It is who we are, where 
we are, where we've come from, and where we might go, U he says.

supported by UNESCO. 
 
30 The UNESCO Courier « April-June 2019 
The conflict in Syria has caused heavy loss 
of life and extensive damage to cities and 
infrastructure, devastating the economic 
and social life of the Syrian people and 
their cultural heritage. Once hailed as 
an example of best practice in urban 
conservation, the Ancient City of Aleppo, 
inscribed on UNESCO's World Heritage 
List in 1986, was added to the List of 
World Heritage in Danger in 2013. Heavily 
affected by the conflict, the city has been 
reduced to ruins in many places. 
Over 500 damaged properties — from the 
Citadel of Aleppo to markets, museums, 
places of worship, and other historical 
buildings — have recently been identified 
in a study* conducted by UNESCO and 
the United Nations Institute for Training 
and Research (UNITAR). 
This is the first comprehensive inventory 
of the material damage and memory 
loss suffered by this ancient city 
between 2013 and 2017. The capital 
of the Amorite kingdom of Yamhad, 
Aleppo experienced a tremendous 
boom at the beginning of 2000 BC. 
It was considered the seat of the storm 
god, Halab, according to the authors of 
the book, Ruba Kasmo, a Syrian architect 
from Aleppo, and Jean-Claude David, 
a French geographer. 
Twenty cultural heritage experts, 
historians, archaeologists, architects and 
satellite imagery analysts participated 
in this project, which began as soon 
as the shelling of the city stopped in 
December 2016.

The soul of the 
City has been 
shattered 
[llustrated with photos of the city and its 
buildings before and after the conflict 
began, and providing QR codes with 
which to access satellite images and 3D 
documentation, the study offers a solid 
technical basis for the planning of the 
restoration and rehabilitation of Aleppo. 
It reveals that more than ten per cent of 
Aleppo’s historic buildings have been 
destroyed and that more than half the 
buildings assessed showed moderate to 
severe damage. 
But itis not just the stones that have been 
destroyed. The soul of the city has been 
shattered. The restoration of memory is as, 
if not more, important, than reconstructing 
buildings. The Great Mosque of Aleppo, for 
example, was a jewel of Seljuk civilization. 
It was unique not only for its minaret and 
exceptional decoration, but also for its 
social role. This place of worship has been 
a fundamental element of Syrian culture, 
with generations of Syrians gathering here 
over the course of nine hundred years. Its 
devastation strikes at the very essence of 
this community. 
The inhabitants of Aleppo are the 
custodians of the history and memory of 
their city. It will be up to them to revive 
its cultural, social and economic life. The 
authors have dedicated this book to them, 
to help them overcome the trauma of war.

cities in networks 
Welcoming cities 
13 November 2015. The French capital is in the grip of a series of suicide attacks, 
the deadliest the country has seen in recent history - stirring up emotions all 
around the world. Meanwhile, far from the commotion in Paris, six cameras 
closely follow the daily lives of a father and his daughter in Bologna, Italy; a 
family in Seville, Spain; a couple in love in Riga, Latvia; a lonely young man 
in Hamburg, Germany; a determined teenager in Toulouse, France; a couple 
getting together in Loures, Portugal. Scattered all over Europe, these people 
have nothing in common except that they are all migrants. A group that will pay 
the high price for increased security and border controls in the aftermath of the 
Paris bombings. 
Their story is told in 73.71, a six-episode TV mini-series (fiction), produced in 
2017 by Elenfant Film, an Italian video and film production company. It aims to 
show the human face of migration, and to prompt us not to forget that every 
minute, twenty people are displaced from their homes in our world today. 
The city of Bologna was the driving force behind this project. The city is leader 
of the European Coalition of Cities Against Racism (ECCAR), launched at the end 
of the fourth European Conference of Cities for Human Rights in 2004. 
The same year, UNESCO created a vast global network of cities united around 
the fight against racism, discrimination, xenophobia and exclusion in urban 
areas. The International Coalition of Inclusive and Sustainable Cities (ICCAR) 
brings together the regional coalitions created in Europe (2004), Africa (2006), 
Latin America and the Caribbean (2006), Asia and the Pacific (2007), Canada 
(2007), Arab States (2008) and North America (2013). 
Mobilizing cities to adopt a culture of solidarity and cooperation takes 
place through a variety of channels, including regular meetings of mayors, 
international conferences, and publications. In May 2016, for example, UNESCO 
and the foundation of its Goodwill Ambassador, Marianna V. Vardinoyannis, 
launched the Welcoming Cities for Refugees: Promoting Inclusion and 
Protecting Rights initiative. Conducted in partnership with ECCAR, the initiative 
resulted in the 2016 publication of the same name. It provides the first thorough 
international mapping and analysis of city and migration issues, with a focus on 
Europe. The publication also reviews perspectives of international networks on 
cities and migration, and identifies a set of common principles, guidelines and 
actions to be carried out in the field of urban governance. 
Towards smart cities 
Water security, sanitation, urban violence, inequality, discrimination, pollution, 
unemployment. In a world where urbanization is burgeoning, these are some 
of the critical challenges that cities will have to face. Home to half the world’s 
population today, cities are expected to shelter two-thirds of it by 2050. 
Born in the early 2000s, the concept of the smart city seeks to provide answers 
to these challenges by combining new technologies with humanist ideals. 
Through innovative urban systems, smart cities promote socio-economic 
development while enhancing the quality of life. 
Huge opportunities are opening up with smart cities. But to be effective, this 
“smartness” must adopt a humanistic approach, and leave no one behind. This is 
the key message of the new publication Smart Cities: Shaping Societies for 2030, 
co-edited by UNESCO and the Netexplo Observatory, and presented at the 12th 
Annual Netexplo Forum, 17 to 19 April 2019, at UNESCO Headquarters in Paris. 
To evaluate the contribution of smart cities to sustainable growth, UNESCO 
and the World Technopolis Association (WTA) jointly organized the 15th WTA 
H-Tech Fair and the 2018 Global Innovation Forum in Binh Duong New City, Viet 
Nam, in October 2018. Under the theme “Towards a better place to live: Smart 
City", sustainable development strategies and policies were discussed, and 
technological solutions to various urban problems were proposed.

### 367843: Yazd: vivre en symbiose avec le désert

  
Under the auspices of UNESCO 
Yazd: 
Living in symbiosis with the desert 
Modern cities and cultural traditions may 
be perceived as contradictory notions. 
Synonymous with modernity, new ways 
of life and multiple opportunities, we 
always imagine that cities look to the 
future. Entrenched in the past, traditions, 
on the other hand, are thought to 
obstruct progress. The preservation 
of heritage is often viewed as costly 
and time-consuming for a relatively 
low return on the investment, and is 
therefore accorded less attention than 
infrastructure development. 
Even so, traditions continue to have a life 
of their own, and cities would be empty 
shells without them. These customs are 
passed on from generation to generation 
and are constantly evolving — allowing 
communities to respond to new 
needs and to adapt to changes in their 
environment. More than we can imagine, 
they are able to provide tailor-made 
solutions to current problems. 
The ganats of Iran 
In the heart of Iran, for example, the 
old town of Yazd has greatly benefited 
from the ingenuity of its inhabitants, 
who over the centuries, have developed 
the art and technologies necessary to 
live in symbiosis with the desert. They 
have harnessed the harsh nature of 
their environment to make it a source of 
artistic creation. This is expressed through 
their architecture, and especially through 
innovative urban planning. 
Yazd's elegant earthen architecture has 
thus been able to withstand the ravages 
of time and extreme climate, leading 
the historic city to be listed on the World 
Heritage List in 2017. In spite of the aridity 
of the climate, agriculture employs a 
significant proportion of the inhabitants 
of the city and the surrounding region. 
This is mainly due to the preservation 
of an infrastructure that dates back 
a thousand years - the ganats. 
The ingenious system of ganats is 
designed to capture groundwater. 
Devised in Iran centuries ago, it has been 
adopted in many parts of the Middle 
East and the Mediterranean Basin.

Gently sloping underground channels, 
or tunnels, collect water from aquifers 
with the help of gravity, transferring it 
downhill for drinking and agricultural 
purposes. A series of vertical well shafts 
are drilled at regular intervals along the 
route, communicating with the surface of 
the ground. This assists the construction 
and maintenance of the ganat, providing 
ventilation and access for workers, 
equipment and debris. The technology of 
these underground aqueducts has stood 
the test of time and is now a model for 
sustainable groundwater use. 
Today, 37,000 ganats are still operational 
in Iran, supplying eleven per cent of the 
country’s water. They have been used 
mainly for irrigation since the installation 
of a water distribution network in 1961. 
  
  
Farmers maintain a sustainable balance 
between the water flow and cultivated 
areas by adjusting — depending on 
their reserves — the water distribution 
between water-intensive farms and low- 
consumption orchards. The core concept 
of the qanats is that it is up to humans to 
adjust to available water resources, not 
the other way around. 
Qanats are not just examples of well- 
preserved ancient infrastructure. The 
search and control of water are so vital 
for life in the desert, that considerable 
efforts have been made by communities 
to maintain and improve this essential 
know-how from generation to generation 
— and to adapt it to current realities.

The social fabric has largely been 
woven around the principles of sharing, 
ownership and distribution of water 
resources. These days, however, an 
elected ganat council has replaced the 
traditional public gatherings of the past, 
to facilitate decision-making processes. 
Perpetuating know-how 
The trade of the mogannis, the well- 
diggers or geo-hydrological experts who 
maintain the ganats, has also evolved. In 
the past, the wide range of skills needed 
— to find underground water, deciding on 
the best location for the wells, mastering 
the techniques of excavation, cleaning 
and repair of wells and tunnels, and the 
wisdom of managing the water — were 
passed down from father to son. 
   
  
Cities and living heritage 
cities in networks 
Every spring, the city of Recife, in the far east of Brazil, dons its carnival clothes. It's time 
for music, dance, optimism and euphoria. At the heart of the festivities is the Frevo. In 
this frenetic carnival dance music, we recognize the regular cadence of military marching 
music, the marked beats of the Brazilian tango, the harmonic patterns of the Caribbean 
quadrille, the lively tempo of polka and the polyrhythm of jazz - a mélange of musical 
genres of diverse origins, but all typically urban. 
You need athletic skills to dance to the sounds of the Frevo! The Passo, the accompanying 
dance, has more than a hundred rigorously structured steps - its high jumps and other 
acrobatics give it an air of extraordinary joy and freedom. 
The Carnival lasts only a week, but its spirit lingers in the city all year round. The residents 
of Recife, across all social classes and generations, gather together in their spare time to 
prepare for the next festival. Everyone contributes their skills, talents and knowledge. 
New pieces of music are composed, new dance feats are invented, new costumes and 
disguises are made - all competing in imagination. 
If the inhabitants of Recife have something in common, it is the Frevo - it nurtures their 
sense of belonging to the same culture, and strengthens community values and social 
cohesion. It is these values that led to the inscription of the Frevo on UNESCO’s List of 
Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2012. 
Intangible cultural heritage is a bridge between traditional and contemporary cultural 
values. It is the living expression of oral traditions, craft skills, artistic, social or ritual 
customs, knowledge and know-how handed down to us by previous generations. 
In urban areas, this living heritage is a creative force that binds and strengthens 
communities. 
To ensure that this ancestral occupation 
flourishes, the International Centre on 
Qanats and Historic Hydraulic Structure 
(ICQHS), affiliated to UNESCO, and 
the Faculty of Qanat in Taft, provide 
education in the field. Located about 
twenty kilometres south of Yazd, the Taft 
college has been offering a two-year 
apprenticeship since 2005. Students are 
trained by traditional masters in theory 
and practice, in the Yazd desert. The 
profession has also received additional 
recognition — master mogannis can now 
be licensed by the Ministry of Justice to 
settle ganat disputes. 
Of course, water management in a 
country with many desert areas such 
as Iran is extremely complex. In recent 
decades, new technologies for the 
exploitation and sharing of water 
resources have been developed to meet 
the needs of a growing population and 
economic imperatives. This modern 
infrastructure sometimes competes with 
traditional systems, leading to water 
shortages in extreme cases. 
Nevertheless, the ganats and the resulting 
know-how remain a pillar of Yazd's urban 
planning and an integral part of its 
future projects. This is why institutional 
management and safeguard mechanisms 
have been adopted to complement the 
customary system. Three government 
agencies oversee ganat management, 
while the ICQHS carries out research and 
capacity-building activities. 
The cultural 
backgrounds of 
inhabitants 
Yazd is living proof that intangible cultural 
heritage can provide or inspire ingenious 
solutions, adapted to local conditions. 
By basing their strategies on local 
practices and making the most of their 
cultural resources, cities are more likely to 
mobilize their populations to participate 
in their development projects. This 
requires, of course, that living heritage is 
valued through appropriate safeguarding 
measures and the active participation of 
the holders of traditional knowledge. 
Cities vibrate and prosper to the rhythm 
of the activities and exchanges of their 
inhabitants. Whether they have been 
settled for a long time or have arrived 
only recently, they all bring their own 
cultural backgrounds with them. Their 
knowledge, beliefs, traditions, customs 
and worldviews shape their identities 
and relationships with others — and, 
consequently, their cities.

### 367844: Sauver les paysages urbains: l'Île de Mozambique

Then, for four centuries (1507 to 1898), 
this fortified town was the capital and 
trading post of Portuguese East Africa, at 
the centre of Portuguese maritime routes 
between Western Europe and the Indian 
subcontinent, and later, Asia. 
The island's incredible architectural 
unity is derived from the consistent 
use - since the sixteenth century — of 
the same building techniques with the 
same materials and decorative principles. 
Recognizing its international historic 
importance, its exceptional urban fabric, 
fortifications and other examples of 
architecture, the Island of Mozambique 
was inscribed on UNESCO's World 
Heritage List in 1991. 
Two different types of dwellings and 
urban systems co-exist here — the city of 
stone and lime, and the city with palm 
leaf roofs. 
The Stone Town, with its houses made of 
limestone and wood, has Swahili roots, 
with Arab and Portuguese influences, 
and dominates the island's northern 
half. It is a living museum, with religious, 
administrative, commercial and military 
buildings testifying to its role as the first 
seat of Portuguese colonial government. 
Occupying two-thirds of the island, it 
is inhabited by a relatively small part of 
the population. 
The city of Macuti, named after the 
original palm leaf roofing (macuti) of 
the houses, hosts many variations of 
the vernacular Swahili architecture, 
and lies to the south. Organized into 
seven bairros or districts, which are the 
densest settlements on the island, it is 
not surprising that Macuti suffers from an 
acute water shortage, a lack of sanitation 
and a serious threat of seasonal flooding. 
The island's outstanding universal 
value has borne the brunt of multi- 
faceted threats, such as uncontrolled 
development and the impacts of a 
globalized culture. A lack of financial 
resources, inadequate infrastructure, 
a low awareness of conservation 
among the local population and a weak 
institutional capacity for conservation 
management have all contributed to 
the degradation and poor upkeep of 
the island's built heritage. For example, 
an evaluation of the condition of the 
buildings in the Stone Town has shown 
that they have deteriorated by fifteen per 
cent between 1983 and 2012. 
Water and megacities 
cities in networks / 
  
More than half the world’s people live in cities and by 2050, it is expected that 
sixty-eight per cent of the world’s population will live in urban areas. In Latin 
America, this threshold has already been reached. Migration is a major force in 
urbanization, with over a third of the world’s 68.5 million displaced people living 
in cities. In 1970, three cities had over ten million inhabitants. Twenty years later, 
there were ten such megacities. By 2014, there were already twenty-eight, and 
according to estimates, there will be forty-one by 2030. 
Launched in 2015, The Megacities Alliance for Water and Climate (MAWaC) is 
a forum for international collaboration and dialogue to help megacities adapt 
to, and mitigate the effects of climate change. With a secretariat provided by 
UNESCO, the forum brings together all stakeholders in the water sector, allowing 
megacities to learn from each other's experience, collaborate with the appropriate 
technical, academic and financial institutions and implement responses to the 
challenges of climate change and urban growth. 
In 2016, UNESCO studied fifteen megacities in collaboration with the French 
non-profit, ARCEAU IdF, releasing a joint publication, Water, Megacities and Global 
Change: Portraits of 15 Emblematic Cities of the World. In particular, it reveals the 
common challenges these cities face - from their gigantic size to their social 
disparities, to access to water and sanitation, and the sustainable management of 
natural resources. 
Indeed, these densely-populated human settlements face new threats every 
day due to population growth, climate change and the deterioration of urban 
infrastructure. This is especially true in Asia's developing countries, where 
more than twenty per cent of the GDP comes from megacities. Managing and 
providing water and safe, affordable and sustainable services in these cities can 
prove challenging. 
This was the main theme of the seminar, Building Urban Resilience, organized by 
UNESCO in February 2018, during the 9th World Urban Forum in Kuala Lumpur, 
Malaysia. The discussions focused on ways to adapt water management to the 
impacts of climate change in megacities, and the need to raise public awareness 
and train people in this area. Various management initiatives and practices were 
also presented, enabling cities to improve basic services, including access to fresh 
water and sanitation. 
Planning and managing cities, making them resilient and equipping them to 
provide water security for residents is key to a city’s success. This is the mission 
of the Urban Water Management Programme (UWMP), which helps UNESCO 
Member States to solve the problems they face in this field - through training 
support, the sharing of scientific knowledge and guidelines, and the exchange of 
information on different approaches, solutions and management tools. 
For more than ten years, UNESCO's International Hydrological Programme (IHP) 
has published the Urban Water Series, which informs the work of practitioners, 
policymakers and educators, working in the field of urban water management 
around the world. 
This has prompted UNESCO-driven 
initiatives on the island to focus on two 
major areas: the condition of life and 
habitation in the bairros of Macuti and the 
general degradation of the built heritage 
of the Stone Town. 
Following the adoption of the UNESCO 
Recommendation on the Historic Urban 
Landscape (HUL) in 2011, it was decided 
to apply the HUL approach to the island. 
As part of the UNESCO World Heritage 
Cities Programme, HUL provides technical 
assistance and helps World Heritage cities 
across the globe to better reconcile urban 
heritage conservation into strategies 
of socio-economic development. 
These new strategies have helped 
strengthen the governance mechanism 
for the sustainable management 
and development of the Island 
of Mozambique.

Text: Katerina Markelova 
This photo essay is being published to mark the 
International Day of Light, celebrated on 16 May. 
“Do | even have a right to be here?” On 
more than one occasion, Rubén Salgado 
Escudero asked himself this question as 
he travelled through rural Myanmar with 
his expensive photographic equipment. 
The Spanish photographer, who visited 
this country in 2014 on behalf of a 
humanitarian organization, was amazed 
by the glaring lack of access to electricity. 
“Most of the villages | went to, didn’t have 
electricity,” he explains. 
Out of more than 53 million people in 
Myanmar, 22 million are deprived of 
this commodity, which until now had 
been so commonplace in his eyes. While 
seventy-nine per cent of urban dwellers 
are supplied with power, this rate drops 
dramatically in rural areas — where only 
forty-three per cent of the population can 
light their homes at nightfall. 
Once his mission was completed, Salgado 
continued on his path as a freelance 
photographer. He decided that he would 
earn the right to be there. He didn’t know 
how yet, but he wanted to draw attention 
to the problem. The idea of Solar Portraits 
came to mind when he met villagers 
equipped with solar panels. “The quality 
of life of these people was so vastly 
different from everyone else's around 
them,” he recalls. 
Energy is indeed “essential for humanity 
to develop and thrive’, as highlighted 
in the 2017 Report of the International 
Energy Agency (IEA). It is essential for the

achievement of many of the Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) set out by the 
United Nations in its 2030 Sustainable 
Development Agenda, which includes 
poverty eradication (SDG1), universal 
access to quality education (SDG4) 
and gender equality (SDGS5). Clean and 
affordable energy for all is, in itself, one 
of these objectives (SDG7). This is the 
first time that the fundamental role of 
energy has been recognized on this scale, 
according to the report. 
Yet, “having access to electricity is 
still a privilege in many countries 
and not a right,” the photographer 
says indignantly. In 2017, there were 
nearly one billion people in the world 
without electricity.

Cristobal Céspedes Lorenzo and his young associate, Francisco Manzanares Cagua, carry freshly-picked coconuts 
across the river to Copala, Mexico, which they will sell to a company which makes coconut butter and oil. 
But how do we attract the attention of 
the public, who are increasingly jaded 
by the negative news that reaches them 
every day? “By finding new creative 
ways to tell stories, to capture people's 
attention,” Salgado responds. 
He takes his photos with only the light 
of LED bulbs powered by solar panels. 
This light, which gives them an air of 
Rembrandt portraits — and undoubtedly 
the positive energy that emanates 
from it — aroused an interest that the 
photographer did not anticipate. 
Published in Time, the American weekly, 
and the German monthly, GEO, the 
Myanmar portraits were enthusiastically 
received by the public. So much so that 
the photographer, with the help of an 
Austrian reader, launched a crowdfunding 
campaign, Let there be light Myanmar. 
The funds collected were used to equip 
three villages with solar panels in 2016, 
benefiting 400 inhabitants. 
Since then, the project has continued 
to expand. The novice photographer 
was noticed by the American magazine 
National Geographic, which sent him to 
Uganda in sub-Saharan Africa in 2015, 
to complete the series. It is estimated 
that by 2030, this region will be home 
to 600 million of the world’s 674 million 
people living without electricity. 
In the same year, Salgado visited India, 
which is currently performing one 
of the greatest feats in the history of 
electrification. Half a billion Indians have 
been connected to the power grid since 
2000, giving the country hope that it 
will reach its goal of universal access to 
electricity by the early 2020s. 
In 2017, the photographer travelled all 
over Mexico. In 2019, he plans to visit the 
Navajo in New Mexico (United States), 
Guatemala, Colombia and the Philippines. 
Nowadays, Salgado organizes workshops 
in the schools of each community he 
encounters in the course of his work. 
Through practical experiments with 
solar bulbs, students are introduced to 
the concept of renewable energy, which 
is, according to the IEA, the cheapest 
solution for three-quarters of the new 
connections needed in the world. “The 
sooner we can make children conscious 
of the importance of this issue, the more 
leaders we will have in future who will 
care, and take us in the right direction,’ 
he explains.

On 21 February 2019, a cargo ship 
left the port of Saint-Nazaire, France. 
On board: sixty-five kits, which 
included portable rechargeable 
LED lamps and solar chargers in the 
form of pouches. These pouches are 
equipped with a flexible, ultra-thin 
and organic photovoltaic film, with 
minimal environmental impact. The 
shipper: ARMOR, a French company 
which developed this innovative 
photovoltaic technology in 2016. 
Its target audience: 212 students from 
Agou Akplolo, a non-electrified village 
north of Lomé, Togo. Only thirty-five 
per cent of the 7.7 million inhabitants 
in this sub-Saharan country have 
access to electricity. The project is the 
result of a partnership that UNESCO 
signed with ARMOR in December 
2018. Its objective is to provide 
light for children, so they can study 
after sunset.

The debate on what we call 
a “migration crisis” has a racial 
component. It is a pattern which 
consistently repeats itself in laws, 
narratives and practices, like it has 
done over centuries, according 
to Uruguayan-American writer 
Jorge Majfud. Taking us on 
an instructive detour through 
history, he points out the total 
absence - in this same heated 
debate - of any mention of half a 
million European immigrants who 
live illegally in the United States 
and another million Americans 
living illegally in Mexico. 
On the occasion of World Refugee Day, 
June 20, we dedicate the Ideas section 
to displaced people around the 
world. According to the latest figures 
published by the United Nations 
Refugee Agency (UNHCR), the number 
of forcibly displaced people worldwide 
reached a record 68.5 million in 2017.   
In my classes, | always try to make clear 
the difference between opinions and 
facts. It is a fundamental rule, a very simple 
intellectual exercise that we owe ourselves 
to undertake in the post-Enlightenment 
era. | started becoming obsessed with 
such obvious matters when | found out, 
in 2005, that some students were arguing 
that something “is true because | believe 
it’, and they weren't joking. Since then, 
I've suspected that such intellectual 
conditioning, such a conflation of physics 
with metaphysics (cleared up by Averroes 
almost a thousand years ago) — which year 
by year becomes increasingly dominant 
(faith as the supreme criterion, regardless 
of all evidence to the contrary) — has its 
origins in the majestic churches of the 
southern United States. 
But critical thinking involves so much 
more than just distinguishing facts from 
opinions. Trying to define what a fact is 
would suffice. The very idea of objectivity 
itself paradoxically originates from a 
single perspective, from one lens. And 
anyone knows that with the lens of one 
photographic or video camera, only one 
part of reality is captured, which quite 
often is subjective or used to distort reality 
in the supposed interest of objectivity.

For some reason, students tend to be 
more interested in opinions than facts. 
Maybe because of the superstitious idea 
that an informed opinion is derived from 
the synthesis of thousands of facts. This is 
a dangerous idea, but we can't run away 
from our responsibility to give our opinion 
when it’s required. All that we can and 
should do is take note that an informed 
opinion continues to be an opinion which 
must be tested or challenged. 
An opinion 
On a certain day, students discussed 
the caravan of 5,000 Central Americans 
(at least 1,000 of whom were children) 
fleeing violence and heading for the 
Mexican border with the US. President 
Donald Trump had ordered the border 
closed and called those looking for 
refuge “invaders”. On 29 October 2018, 
he tweeted: “This is an invasion of our 
Country and our Military is waiting 
for you!”. The military deployment to 
the border alone cost the US about 
$200 million.

Since one of my students insisted on 
knowing my opinion, | started off with 
the most controversial side of the issue. 
| observed that this country, the US, was 
founded upon the fear of invasion, and 
only a select few have always known 
how to exploit this weakness, with tragic 
consequences. Maybe this paranoia came 
about with the English invasion of 1812, but 
if history tells us anything, it’s that the US 
has practically never suffered an invasion 
of its territory — if we exclude the 9/11 
attacks in 2001; the one on Pearl Harbor, 
which at the time was a military base in 
foreign territory; and, prior to that, at the 
very beginning of the twentieth century, 
the brief incursion of a Mexican named 
Pancho Villa mounted upon a horse. But the 
US has indeed specialized in invading other 
countries from the time of its founding - it 
took over the Indian territories, then half 
of Mexico, from Texas, to reinstall slavery, 
to California; it intervened directly in 
Latin American affairs, to repress popular 
protests and support bloody dictatorships — 
all in the name of defence and security. And 
always with tragic consequences.

Therefore, the idea that a few thousand 
poor people on foot are going to invade 
the most powerful country in the world 
is simply a joke in poor taste. And it’s 
likewise in bad taste for some Mexicans 
on the other side to adopt this same 
xenophobic talk that’s been directed 
at them — inflicting on others the same 
abuse they've suffered. 
A critical view 
In the course of the conversation, | 
mentioned in passing that in addition to 
the foundational paranoia, there was a 
racial component to the argument. “You 
don't need to be a racist to defend the 
borders,’ said one student. 
True, | noted. You don’t need to be a racist 
to defend borders or laws. At first glance, 
the statement is irrefutable. However, if 
we take history and the wider current 
context into consideration, an openly 
racist pattern jumps out at us right away. 
At the end of the nineteenth century, 
the French novelist Anatole France 
wrote: “The law, in its majestic equality, 
forbids rich and poor alike to sleep under 
bridges, to beg in the streets, and to 
steal their bread.” You don't need to be 
an elitist to support an economically 
stratified culture. You don't need to be 
sexist to spread the most rampant type 
of sexism. Thoughtlessly engaging in 
 
certain cultural practices and voicing your 
support for some law or another is quite 
often all it takes. 
| drew a geometric figure on the board 
and asked students what they saw there. 
Everyone said they saw a cube or a box. 
The most creative variations didn’t depart 
from the idea of tri-dimensionality, when 
in reality what | drew was nothing more 
than three rhombuses forming a hexagon. 
Some tribes in Australia don't see that same 
image in 3D, but rather in 2D. We see what 
we think and that’s what we call objectivity. 
Double standards 
When President Abraham Lincoln 
emerged victorious from the American 
Civil War (1861-1865), he put an end to 
a hundred-year dictatorship that, up 
to this day, everyone calls “democracy.” 
By the eighteenth century, black slaves 
had come to make up more than fifty 
per cent of the population in states like 
South Carolina - but they weren't even 
citizens of the US, nor did they enjoy even 
minimal human rights. 
Many years before Lincoln, both racists 
and anti-racists proposed a solution to the 
“negro problem” by sending them “back” 
to Haiti or Africa, where many of them 
ended up founding the nation of Liberia 
(one of my students, Adja, is from a family 
which comes from that African country).

The English did the same thing to “rid” 
England of its blacks. But under Lincoln, 
blacks became citizens, and one way to 
reduce them down to a minority was not 
only by making it difficult for them to 
vote (such as by imposing a poll tax) but 
also by opening the nation’s borders to 
immigration. 
The Statue of Liberty, a gift from the 
French people to the American people to 
commemorate the centenary of the 1776 
Declaration of Independence, still cries 
with silent lips: “Give me your tired, your 
poor, your huddled masses yearning to 
breathe free..." In this way, the US opened 
its arms to waves of impoverished 
immigrants. Of course, the overwhelming 
majority were poor whites. Many were 
opposed to the Italians and the Irish 
because they were red-headed Catholics. 
But in any case, they were seen as 
being better than blacks. Blacks weren't 
able to immigrate from Africa, not just 
because they were much farther away 
than Europeans were, but also because 
they were much poorer, and there were 
hardly any shipping routes to connect 
them to New York. The Chinese had more 
opportunities to reach the west coast, 
and perhaps for that reason a law was 
passed in 1882 that prohibited them from 
coming in, just for being Chinese. 
| understand that this was a subtle and 
powerful way to reshape demographics, 
which is to say the political, social and 
racial make-up of the US. The current 
nervousness about a change to that 
make-up is nothing more than the 
continuation of that same old logic. Were 
that not the case, what could be wrong 
with being part of a minority group or 
being different from others? 
Stop the racism, 
by Italian cartoonist Tomas. 
 
You don’t need 
to be racist... 
Clearly, if you're a good person and you're 
in favour of properly enforcing laws, it 
doesn't make you a racist. You don’t need 
to be racist when the law and the culture 
already are. In the US, nobody protests 
Canadian or European immigrants. The 
same is true in Europe and even in the 
Southern Cone of South America [the 
southernmost region of Latin America, 
populated mainly by descendants of 
Europeans]. But everyone is worried about 
the blacks and the hybrid, mixed-race 
people from the south. Because they're 
not white and “good”, but poor and “bad”. 
Currently, almost half a million European 
immigrants are living illegally in the US. 
Nobody talks about them, just like nobody 
talks about how one million US citizens are 
living in Mexico, many illegally. 
With communism discarded as an 
excuse (none of those chronically failing 
states where migrants come from are 
communist), let's once again consider 
the racial and cultural excuses common 
to the century prior to the Cold War. 
Every dark-skinned worker is seen as a 
criminal, not an opportunity for mutual 
development. The immigration laws are 
themselves filled with panic at the sight 
of poor workers. 
It's true that you don't need to be racist 
to support laws and more secure borders. 
You don't need to be racist to spread and 
shore up an old racist and class-based 
paradigm, while we fill our mouths with 
platitudes about compassion and the 
fight for freedom and human dignity.

### 367847: Le revers de la médaille

he other sige 
of the coin 
Katherine Levine Einstein 
 
A recent survey - covering 
over a hundred mayors in the 
United States - illustrates that 
a lot depends on whether these 
officials are willing to demand 
equal rights for their newest 
entrants, and to affect change 
in the face of a more stringent 
federal immigration policy. 
In June 2018, a bipartisan delegation 
of mayors — including the president 
of the United States Conference of 
Mayors, Steve Benjamin — travelled to 
Tornillo, Texas, to protest the family 
separation policy of President Trump's 
administration. America’s mayors have 
also stretched across party lines, in April 
2017, to call for immigration reform 
and to protest the proposed expansion 
of public charge rules in October 
2018, which penalized “lower-income 
immigrant families by denying them 
visas and green cards because they 
have received vital non-cash benefits 
to which they are legally entitled." This 
bipartisan action contrasts sharply with 
the rancorous partisan polarization that 
defines the current national political 
conversations surrounding immigration. 
Yet, in spite of this mayoral public 
activism, there are many obstacles 
to locally-driven immigration reform. 
Indeed, these public actions belie stark 
internal divisions among American 
mayors. In the 2017 and 2018 Menino 
Survey of Mayors, our team at Boston 
University’s Initiative on Cities asked 
over a hundred mayors of cities — with 
populations of over 75,000 — their views 
on immigration, race, and racism, among 
other issues. In contrast with the partisan 
unity adopted by the US Conference of 
Mayors, mayors appear to be sharply 
divided on these issues. Eighty-six per 
cent of Democratic mayors believe 
that immigrants should receive local 
government services, regardless of their 
legal status, in contrast to a mere twenty- 
nine per cent of Republicans. 
48 | The UNESCO Courier « April-June 2019 
What's more, even those mayors 
who do support fighting the Trump 
administration's immigration policies 
are not quite sure about their capacity 
to do so. Only thirty-one per cent of 
mayors believed that they could do 
a lot to counteract or oppose federal 
immigration policy. In comparison, when 
it came to federal policing initiatives, 
seventy-four per cent felt they could do 
a lot to countermand or revoke them. 
These disparities make sense. While 
many American public policies have 
been devolved to the state and local 
levels, immigration firmly remains in 
federal hands. 
State laws may further limit the policy 
autonomy of cities in this arena. Multiple 
states are considering legislation 
prohibiting sanctuary cities,* though 
some, notably, are pursuing policies that 
explicitly permit sanctuary jurisdictions. 
In Texas — a state that has been 
demographically transformed in recent 
decades by immigration — the governor 
signed a state law banning sanctuary 
cities; the law made police officials and 
local leaders subject to misdemeanour 
charges if they failed to honour requests 
from immigration agents to hold 
non-citizen inmates who are subject 
to deportation. 
Moreover, even in those American 
cities where the state governments are 
more permissive, cities face important 
constraints. They are often cash- 
strapped, and limited from raising 
additional resources by onerous tax and 
expenditure limits imposed by their 
state governments. 
That said, there remain many local 
policies at the disposal of mayors that 
could appreciably affect conditions on 
the ground for immigrants — perhaps 
most notably in the realm of policing. 
 
* Sanctuary cities are those that are committed to 
protecting the rights of all its citizens, including 
undocumented immigrants, and providing basic 
services to them. In the US, these cities also ensure that 
undocumented immigrants who are not otherwise 
engaged in criminal activity are prevented from being 
detained or deported by the federal authorities. 
Local governments can opt, in many 
states, not to enforce some aspects of 
national immigration law — becoming 
sanctuary cities. As the US Conference 
of Mayors noted in a statement issued 
on 25 January 2017: "Local police 
departments work hard to build and 
preserve trust with all of the communities 
they serve, including immigrant 
communities. Immigrants residing in our 
cities must be able to trust the police and 
all of city government.” 
Cities can also make government itself 
more welcoming. They can create offices 
of immigrant inclusion; provide city 
services in multiple languages; conduct 
outreach in immigrant communities; hire 
staff from diverse backgrounds. 
Starkly separated 
communities 
Mayors and cities might also promulgate 
policies promoting equal access to 
quality local government services 
across immigrant and non-immigrant 
communities. America’s cities are highly 
segregated, with white people and 
people of colour — those of African 
descent, Asians and Hispanics — starkly 
separated into different neighbourhoods. 
In Boston, for example, sixty per cent of 
Hispanics would need to move from their 
current neighbourhood of residence 
in order to be evenly spread across the 
metropolitan area. 
This racial and ethnic segregation leads 
to concentrated poverty — in which socio- 
economic deprivation is clustered in one 
place. Concentrated poverty is associated 
with a whole host of negative social and 
economic outcomes, including fewer job 
opportunities and higher crime. These 
areas, on average, have lower-quality 
government services. 
This neglect of disadvantaged 
communities has a myriad of causes. 
Residents in these communities are 
less likely to make demands of their 
government. They are less apt to have 
time to contact their government 
or trust that their government 
will take action if asked.

## [Page 49](367693eng.pdf#page=49) 0

### 367847: Le revers de la médaille

Moreover, politicians are, on average, 
more responsive to affluent constituents; 
so, even when asked to take action by 
these communities, they are less likely to 
do so. The effect of historic disinvestment 
in these communities is cumulative, and 
challenging to overcome. 
What's more, many mayors are reluctant 
to acknowledge local discrimination 
and inequities in public services. 
Only nineteen per cent of mayors 
believed that immigrants faced a lot of 
discrimination in their cities. Over eighty 
per cent of mayors of both political 
parties viewed the quality of their mass 
transit, street maintenance, and parks 
as equal for white people and people of 
colour. Acknowledging inequality and 
discrimination are key prerequisites to 
taking concrete policy actions that tackle 
these issues. 
This is not to say that all mayors eschew 
acknowledging and addressing racial 
inequality. Here, again — as with views 
on immigrants receiving public services 
— the partisan divide was substantial. 
Democratic mayors were twenty 
  
percentage points more likely than 
Republicans to perceive discrimination 
against immigrants in their cities. 
Depending upon the policy area, 
Democrats were between twenty and 
fifty percentage points more apt than 
Republicans to believe that access to 
social and public goods like jobs, health 
care, and fair treatment by the courts was 
better for white people than for people 
of colour. While mayors across party 
lines have taken symbolic action against 
Trump's immigration policies, Democratic 
mayors are substantially more likely to 
provide vocal support for undocumented 
immigrants, acknowledge local 
discrimination against immigrants, and 
admit that access to key public, social, 
and economic goods are racially unequal. 
Immigrants thus face an uneven 
patchwork of services to navigate, 
as some (largely Democratic) local 
governments aggressively promulgate 
initiatives to welcome immigrants and 
redress disparities, and others — due to 
limitations or local prejudices against 
newcomers — choose not to.

The mobile Africas or A al [) 
\Viabanckou 
Alain Mabanckou, interviewed by 
Ariane Poissonnier, French journalist 
Alain Mabanckou browses 
through a“tri-continental attic’, 
searching the past to shed light 
on the present. How should 
colonial history be read? What 
meaning should be given to the 
restoration of African cultural 
heritage? And what is the role of 
the novelist in all this? The French- 
Congolese writer discusses these 
issues, in all simplicity. 
With this interview, the Courier 
participates in the celebration of 
World Africa Day, 25 May. 
You divide your time between three 
countries - the Congo, France, and the 
United States. How does this arrangement 
work out for you? 
As an advantage! This tri-continental 
culture has allowed me to encounter 
the variety of the world and to discover 
what | call mobile Africas. First of all, a 
mobile Africa within the continent. When 
[ lived in the Congo, | came across West 
Africans, and that made me aware of 
Africa's diversity. When | came to France, 
| discovered the Western world, but 
also the Africans who had settled there 
through migration, travel, the history of 
slavery and colonization — a mobile Africa 
in Europe. And then, when | am in the 
United States, | perceive my continent 
through a distant magnifying glass that 
allows me to discern the floating shadows 
of yet another mobile Africa, deported by 
slavery and the slave trade. 
| got acquainted with this African- 
American world in New York, through 
Richard Wright, Chester Himes and James 
Baldwin, writers of the Harlem Renaissance 
—a movement they launched in the 
first half of the twentieth century, that 
revolutionized so-called Black thinking. 
So, it's a kind of tri-continental attic that 
| sneak into, to retrieve whatever might 
help to explain tomorrow’s world. The 
world of tomorrow is the sum of different 
cultures. 
Some say that today the neo-liberal system 
is such a hegemony that we no longer even 
have the words to criticizeit... 
Frankly, | can’t identify with that! That 
would mean that all the tools for criticism 
have been corrupted by the neo-liberal 
system — | am not that pessimistic. 
There are always ways to thwart a 
system, and it is sometimes by entering 
into the vocabulary of that system, by 
deconstructing it and demonstrating how 
empty it is, that a new way of thinking 
can emerge. Just because the peanut has 
a shell doesn't mean | won't break it to 
see what's inside, and eat it! 
Take the example of African civilizations. 
They have used Western thought to 
establish African thought. The Negritude 
movement was born in Europe, in 
the minds of the Black and Caribbean 
students who came to study in France. 
One of them, the Senegalese [poet and 
statesman] Léopold Sédar Senghor, 
entered the Académie Francaise.

And who would question the universality 
of Return To My Native Land by 
Martinique’s Aimé Césaire? Who can 
doubt the power of analyses of another 
Martinican, Frantz Fanon, in Black Skin, 
White Masks? These writers have attacked 
the colonial system and its corollaries 
from within, using the tools that the 
system provided them. 
“The Belgians are trying to recount 
their colonial history’; you commented 
recently on Instagram, after visiting the 
AfricaMuseum in Belgium. Why did you 
say that? 
A museum is like an individual, who 
sends out a message by the choice of his 
clothes, which can be honest or biased. 
Some wear a wig. You may fall in love 
with this beautiful hair and be deeply 
disappointed when you discover it's fake! 
Similarly, when you enter this museum, 
you say to yourself that it's very beautiful 
and finally... nothing. | went around in

Admittedly, this [recently renovated] 
museum has given some African 
descendants an opportunity to tell their 
stories — it is good to have thought about 
this. That is not necessarily the case in 
France where, as soon as there is any 
mention of colonial history, everyone 
rears up and takes refuge behind Jules 
Ferry, who apparently brought us 
the alphabet! 
But if you gave this same museum to 
Africans to build — indeed, from the 
front door to the back door, they would 
have shown the White man whipping 
the Black man, putting him in the holds, 
plundering the continent, building a 
railroad where people die. Know that | 
would also have written about them on 
Instagram, that they “are trying to write 
their colonial history”. 
The colonized will present the apocalyptic 
version of colonization, the Westerner, its 
supposedly civilizing version. All this must 
be synthesized. For now, we have only 
subjective interpretations. 
Do you believe it is important for 
countries to start returning cultural 
heritage to African countries, such as 
France is currently undertaking? 
| like Felwine Sarr and Bénédicte Savoy's 
report on the restitution of African 
cultural heritage [submitted to the French 
Elysée on 23 November 2018], but let us 
wait to see what happens in practice. 
Restitution raises the same question — 
how do we reread our colonial history? 
Why are these looted objects never 
mentioned in French and European 
history books? The colonizer made a 
big mistake in thinking that what we 
produced artistically was junk. Today, 
these are the missing elements in the 
explanation of the global imagination. 
Africans simply want us to recognize that 
the world’s imagination also includes 
those elements of African culture 
that have been plundered - and that 
there would not have been a Surrealist 
movement, for example, if these painters 
had not had the exposure to African art. 
Going beyond restitution, there is the 
question of the recognition of Africa as an 
artistic power.

Does African literature occupy its rightful 
place in world literature? 
African literature in French is still young, 
it's not even a hundred years old, and 
needs time to become established. What 
is interesting is that it has been able to 
follow the path of globalization — it takes 
into account the fragmented dimension 
of the world and enters into the great 
dialogue that is taking place here and 
there, about the current social challenges. 
Do you sometimes feel like the voice 
of Africa? 
That would be pretentious. It's true that 
| am always flattered to see that more 
and more Africans, including English 
speakers, read what | write, identify with 
it, and are enthusiastic about it. All | do 
is reciprocate, through stories that speak 
of their world. | would like people not 
to think of me as a spokesperson — that 
would be too Christ-like a destiny — but 
to think instead that we are writing the 
books | write, together. 
You could have become a lawyer. In 1989, 
you won a scholarship and left your 
modest family in Pointe-Noire to study 
law in France. 
My parents wanted me to become a 
judge or a lawyer. The University of 
Nantes offered me a place - | studied 
private law for a year and then came to 
Paris to obtain a postgraduate degree 
in business and social law at the Paris 
Dauphine University. 
But writing took precedence over law. 
It's a jealous activity that doesn't like 
competition. And then, when my parents 
died, | had the feeling that | had no one 
left that | needed to make proud of me.

Was there a day when you said to 
yourself: “| want to write”? 
| started writing poems in high school, and, 
basically, | only wanted to write poetry. | 
wasn't aware then that writing could be 
a main activity. For me, it served to calm 
my anxieties, to control my loneliness. It 
became a confession for me, as an only 
child - a way of refusing the world as it 
was written, in the present, so that | could 
invent my own version of the world. 
Maybe that’s where the writing began, 
even if | can’t put a date on the moment 
when | became aware that this was what 
| had to do. | continued to write, telling 
myself that | would work, and, in parallel, 
from time to time, | would write. By doing 
it on a regular basis, | was building up 
my strength for what would become my 
principal activity — and an obsession.

Before you published your first novel, 
Bleu Blanc Rouge (Blue White Red) in 
1998, you had published four collections 
of poems. How do novels and poetry work 
together? 
Poetry corresponds to the romantic 
soul of teenagers — itis the place of first 
loves, the moment one describes one’s 
disappointments, or falls in love with 
Lamartine, Hugo, Vigny, or some other 
romantic poet. And also, poetry was 
highly regarded in my country, with great 
national authors like Tchicaya U Tam'si. 
We really only discovered the novel in 
1979, with the publication of La vie et 
demie [Life and a Half] by Sony Labou 
Tansi, whom | consider to be the greatest 
writer in Congo. There, we realized that 
we could also recount something that was 
not necessarily about personal pain. In the 
novel, the state of mind no longer belongs 
to the novelist - it belongs to the character. 
Your friend, the Haitian writer Dany 
Laferriére, says that when it comes to 
creation, “talent is important, but the 
most important thing is courage”. Do we 
have to dare, to create? 
Courage is everything that you do not see 
in a literary work. A novel or a collection 
of poems is the finished product. We do 
not see in it all the author's tribulations, 
his anguish, his living conditions, his 
cracks. If you do not have the courage, 
if you do not have the obstinacy, if you 
do not have the obsession, then talent is 
worth nothing! 
Writing a novel means polishing each 
sentence and coming back to it as many 
times as necessary, to really express the 
feeling it is meant to. The courage that 
Dany Laferriére speaks of is synonymous 
with obsession and strength. The writer 
is obsessed with the aesthetic project 
he bears, and he uses all his strength to 
defend it within his imaginary universe. 
When you write, do you expose yourself? 
Yes! There is also the political courage, the 
recklessness to expose one’s self. Writing 
is not a walk in the park, it is rather a 
steep road, with potholes, mud, rainwater, 
stones. Those who don't have the 
courage, wear boots. The writer, he walks 
barefoot and makes it to the end of the 
road, even if he’s covered with wounds. 
He has accomplished the project that was 
within him, the force of the world that he 
wanted to give birth to. He did it! 
A novelist, journalist, poet and academic, 
Alain Mabanckou is among the most 
recognized writers in French contemporary 
literature. Born in 1966 in Pointe-Noire, the 
economic capital of Congo, he currently 
teaches literature and creative writing in the 
Department of French and Francophone 
Studies at the University of California, Los 
Angeles (UCLA). Mabanckou has held the 
  
Artistic Creation chair at the College de France 
in 2015 and 2016, and has received numerous 
international prizes. His work has been 
translated into thirty languages. His twelfth 
novel, Les Cigognes sont immortelles (The Storks 
are Immortal), was published in France in 2018.

Open books, 
open minds 
Ghalia Khoja 
The city of Sharjah in the United 
Arab Emirates (UAE) became the 
World Book Capital for the year, 
starting in April 2019. It invites 
the public to embark on the 
bridge of knowledge to discover 
the diversity of the world’s 
cultures and peoples. 
With this article, the Courier 
participates in the celebration of World 
Book and Copyright Day, 23 April. 
“The book is, in all circumstances, the 
best of companions.’ This quote from Al- 
Mutanabbi, the illustrious tenth-century 
Arab poet, has become an adage that 
lovers of literature, poetry and knowledge 
in general, take pleasure in repeating — 
even today, when social networks and 
audio-visual media have considerably 
overshadowed the role of books. 
The book remains a privileged medium 
for promoting the values of tolerance, 
coexistence and peace, for defending 
freedom of expression and fighting 
extremism and obscurantism — all 
common denominators of the events that 
begin in Sharjah on 23 April 2019, World 
Book and Copyright Day, and continue for 
twelve months, as part of its nomination 
as World Book Capital 2019. 
Sharjah is the first city in the Persian Gulf 
and the third city in the Arab world to 
receive this designation. 
It was in Sharjah that the first school and 
the first library were opened in the UAE. 
And it is in this city that, since 1982, the 
annual Sharjah International Book Fair, 
has exhorted the public with “Read —- 
you're in Sharjah!’ its catchy slogan. Now 
the third-largest book fair in the world, 
it welcomed 2.7 million visitors in 2018, 
and 1,874 exhibitors from seventy-seven 
countries. It offered over 1.6 million titles 
and a programme of 1,800 events. 
The emirate of Sharjah has given books 
a special place in its cultural policy, with 
projects such as “A library in every home’, 
mobile libraries, national, regional and

The emirate also boasts of the Sharjah 
Publishing City (SPC), which it describes 
as the world’s first free zone dedicated 
exclusively to serving the global publishing 
and printing industry. Spread over 19,000 
square metres, the facility offers state-of- 
the-art services and infrastructure for the 
entire chain of book-publishing - from 
writing and designing, to printing and 
distributing books — for a range of budgets. 
For its part, the Emirates Publishers 
Association helps to promote books and 
reading among all sections of society and 
different generations of readers. This has 
earned the non-profit organization the 
recognition of its peers — its president, 
Sheikha Bodour Bint Sultan Al Qasimi, was 
elected vice-president of the International 
Publishers Association in 2018. 
“The book is the means by which every 
society can progress, surpass itself and 
engage in dialogue. It is a bridge between 
all the countries of the world,” Sheikha 
Bodour said, taking up her post as head of 
the Sharjah World Book Capital 2019 office.

In partnership with twenty 
representatives of the public, private

is organizing a series of cultural and 
artistic events throughout the year, not 
only in the Emirates but also in other 
countries in the region. The event aims 
to contribute to the development and 
support of publishing in the UAE and 
throughout the Arab world, by providing 
access to books for everyone, especially 
children and teenagers; introducing 
promising authors; increasing the 
readership of printed and digital books, 
and encouraging their translation. All 
genres of books are represented — poetry, 
fiction, non-fiction, social and scientific 
publications, and even comic books. 
At the end of the event, Sharjah will pass 
on the baton to the city of Kuala Lumpur, 
Malaysia, which has already been 
designated by UNESCO as the World Book 
Capital, 2020.

### 367850: L'intelligence artificielle aux portes de l'Afrique

Artificial 
at Africa’s door 
Tshilidzi Marwala, interviewed by Edwin Naidu, South African journalist 
African leaders must embrace technology and use the Fourth 
Industrial Revolution (4IR) to drive the continent out of poverty 
and into a better future, argues leading South African scientist and 
artificial intelligence (Al) expert Tshilidzi Marwala. 
This interview is published on the occasion of World Africa Day, 
celebrated at UNESCO on 25 May. 
In the late 1980s, the Chinese government 
invested in the economy, and has since 
lifted 800 million people out of poverty. 
Do you see the South African government 
being able to achieve similar results, 
albeit with a smaller population, through 
investment in 4IR*? 
It is thought that China may be the last 
country to manage to make money out of 
cheap labour to lift people out of poverty. 
If robots are used in the manufacturing 
process, it will probably be even cheaper 
than it has traditionally been in the past. 
Therefore, | am afraid 4IR may mark the 
cost of labour as a deterrent to employers, 
with the complete automation of the 
production process. 
Undoubtedly, 4IR will change the world of 
work with artificially intelligent machines 
performing tasks that were traditionally 
performed by humans. As a result, 
the world of work is already shrinking, 
with factories employing fewer people 
than before. There will be a marked 
increase in inequality. 
  
* The Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) — being 
built on the widespread availability of digital 
technologies brought to us by the Third Industrial 
(or digital) Revolution — is driven by emerging 
technologies, based on a combination of digital, 
biological and physical innovations. These latest 
technologies, that are changing the way we live and 
work, include artificial intelligence (Al) and robotics, 
the Internet of Things (oT), augmented reality, 
quantum computing, 3D printing, blockchain, 
additive manufacturing, neurotechnologies, 
geoengineering, and genome editing. 
56 | The UNESCO Courier « April-June 2019 
Those with adequate capital to buy 
industrial robots will produce more with 
fewer resources and will become very 
wealthy, while the rest will be relegated 
to the margins of society. 
South Africa, and the African Continent, 
have no choice but to embrace 4IR and 
use it to find solutions to the plethora of 
problems facing us. 
Are all African governments investing 
in4lR? 
| don't think that is the case, even though 
there are some pockets of excellence to 
be found in Mozambique, Congo, Kenya, 
Rwanda, and South Africa, to some 
extent. Mobilizing on an issue like 4IR in 
a continent with fifty-four countries is 
a lot more complicated than handling 
one country, even if it is as big as China. 
Considering that the countries are at 
different stages of development makes 
the situation even more complex. 
| believe that 4IR is going to be about 
data — whether it is the data of people, 
genetic data, or the data that drives 4IR 
itself. The question we must ask is, are 
African countries obtaining data? The 
answer, | am afraid, is no. The biggest 
data capturers in Africa are United States 
multinationals. When it comes to data 
collection or management, Africa would 
score three, on a scale of one to ten. This 
figure is alarming. 
Ntelligence, 
One of the big problems with 4IR is that 
the winner takes all. In South Africa, we 
had a local search engine, called Anansi, 
which aggressively gathered local data, 
but it was no match for Google - it has 
since folded, in 2011. Few people can 
name the world’s number two search 
engine — the answer is Microsoft's Bing, 
but even they're struggling. There is no 
room for a number two - the fact that 
Google is not available in China is a huge 
advantage for Chinese companies. 
However, the web giants, like most 
corporations, don't spend a lot of time 
dealing with local issues. For instance, 
Google Maps does not pronounce 
the names on our local routes well. 
If we produced our own domestic 
maps with the right pronunciations, 
we would have an edge over Google. 
The key to competition is to address 
challenges locally. 
How far are African countries from 
becoming producers of 4IR technology? 
| think we produce a lot of technology, to 
be honest. | hear a lot about Elon Musk, 
and his Tesla car, but South Africa had the 
Joule [an electric five-seater passenger 
car], which was shelved because it would 
have had to sell a million units to be 
viable. We register a lot of patents, but 
our markets are just not big enough, so 
our products are dying in laboratories. 
The economics dictate that you need to 
sell huge amounts to survive. It’s not just 
creating the technology that matters. 
We need to create new markets and build 
an effective export strategy.

### 367850: L'intelligence artificielle aux portes de l'Afrique

Should corporations be playing a bigger 
role through public-private partnerships 
(PPPs) with governments on 4IR? 
Absolutely, corporations must play a 
big role. What | have observed, and this 
is a controversial view, is that there is a 
culture that does not consider Africa as 
a place to produce. For example, there is 
no plant in Africa making Apple products. 
Companies that have production in 
nations they operate in, are much easier 
to partner with than those merely 
bringing their products manufactured 
elsewhere into the country. 
What are some of the mechanisms that 
we need to put in place for multinationals 
to invest in production on the continent? 
In South Africa, the motor industry is a 
good example, where it is government 
policy to subsidize automobile 
companies who produce here. 
Currently, we do not have similar policies 
for companies participating in 4IR; we 
need to do that as we move forward. 
Creating special economic zones with 4IR 
in mind is a good idea, with governments 
providing companies with tax incentives 
that would promote production, job 
creation and help grow the economy. 
These incentives should not just be for 
foreign companies, but local businesses 
should be able to benefit from them too. 
This means that political leaders need 
to play an essential role in the process of 
introducing new technologies. 
One of the first things Africa needs to do 
is to start having leaders who understand 
technology. In Rwanda, the high-speed 
internet makes it obvious that President 
Paul Kagame understands technology.

In Kenya, the number of 4IR startups and 
the launching of digital currency makes 
it clear that President Uhuru Kenyatta 
understands technology. 
In South Africa, President Cyril 
Ramaphosa is the first leader who 
has placed 4IR at the forefront of his 
strategy, and he is a big advocate for 
science and technology. In his State of 
the Nation address in February 2018, 
he talked about the digital industrial 
revolution, and has committed to the 
launch of a commission of experts on 
4IR to drive strategy. We need a national 
strategy, like India’s National Strategy for 
Al or the Made in China 2025 strategic 
manufacturing plan to transform itself 
into an innovative hi-tech powerhouse. 
Hopefully the commission driven by 
President Ramaphosa will create a 
strategy, mobilizing political, economic 
and social forces to put the economy on 
a good trajectory. 
The African continent now has 1.3 billion 
people and is still growing — it is the 
fastest-growing continent in terms of 
population. You are not going to be able 
to deal with the issues of population 
explosion, food security or urbanization 
without 4IR technology. 
Our leaders must understand technology 
— they must be developmental in their 
outlook. And this necessarily means that 
moving forward, we must start identifying 
new leaders with these qualities. 
One of South Africa's leading experts on 
artificial intelligence, Tshilidzi Marwala 
is Vice-Chancellor of the University of 
Johannesburg. His extensive research on 
Al has been published in journals across 
the world, and he has won many awards 
both nationally and internationally.

### 367851: Le miracle rwandais

The Rwandan 
Alphonse Nkusi 
 
A quarter of a century after 
the terrible genocide of 1994, 
Rwanda is turning a new page 
in its history. Following a long 
period of national unification 
and reconciliation, it is investing 
in economic growth and 
focusing on new technologies, 
with the hope of becoming an 
ICT hub in Africa. 
With this article, the Courier participates 
in the International Day of Reflection 
on the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi 
in Rwanda, on 7 April. 
Twenty-five years ago, the bloodiest 
chapter in the contemporary history 
of Africa was written in Rwanda. Ina 
hundred days, a million people lost their 
lives, leaving behind a million orphans, 
not counting the widows and widowers. 
| was in Uganda when this drama was 
being played out in my country. The 
neighbour to the north had welcomed 
me as a refugee in 1962, when | was 
a young man of 17.1 studied there, at 
Makerere University, started my family 
and lived there until 2008. But since 1994, 
I have divided my time between Uganda 
and Rwanda, to take care of my family’s 
orphans and also to contribute to the 
reconstruction of my homeland. 
Everything had to be redone in this 
wounded country. The first concern 
of the Rwandan Patriotic Front, RPF- 
Inkotanyi, the political party led at the 
time by the current Rwandan President 
Paul Kagame, was to stop the genocide 
and restore peace and security. “We have 
learned lessons that should inform us 
how to build our future,” he recently told a 
gathering of business leaders in Charlotte, 
North Carolina, in the United States. 
To build the future, we began by 
relearning to conjugate the verb “to be”in 
the plural and to tell ourselves that we are 
all Banyarwanda. Forget who is Tutsi, who 
is Hutu, who is Twa. Overcome hatred. 
58 | The UNESCO Courier » Apr l-June 2019 
Tradition to the rescue 
Priority was given to unity and 
reconciliation. To this end, the gacaca, 
the traditional system of justice, was 
revived, allowing the community to try 
the perpetrators and accept their request 
for forgiveness. Through these traditional 
courts, survivors were able to learn more 
about the deaths of their relatives, but 
also about the criminals who confessed 
their actions and admitted their guilt. 
Different sentences were handed down, 
depending on the seriousness of the 
crimes committed. Some were sentenced 
to community service, others to prison 
terms. In ten years, the gacaca courts 
judged 1.9 million cases, before they were 
officially closed in May 2012. 
At the same time, public judicial 
institutions were rehabilitated in 
order to judge the most serious cases. 
Internationally, the International Criminal 
Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), established 
on 8 November 1994, recognized that 
“genocide, crimes against humanity and 
war crimes were perpetrated on a horrific 
scale’, reaching “a rate of killing four times 
greater than at the height of the Nazi 
Holocaust” To date, the ICTR has indicted 
ninety-three individuals, considered 
to be planners and perpetrators of the 
genocide. Eighty of them have been tried, 
out of which twenty-three have served 
their sentences. 
In the aftermath of the genocide, another 
traditional method was used to enable 
citizens to participate in public affairs. 
It consists of a commitment to planned 
activities in a management system that 
provides for contracts called imihigo. In 
the past they were oral and endorsed by 
a ceremony, today they are written and 
signed, but their function remains the 
same: they engage the individual to carry 
out a number of tasks during a year, at 
the end of which their performance is 
evaluated by the community. 
This method has contributed significantly 
to the improvement of public services 
in present-day Rwanda, which has 
opted for consensual democracy and 
power-sharing. 
miracle 
The priorities 
With an average growth rate of more 
than seven per cent per year since 2000, 
Rwanda is now one of the leading African 
countries in economic growth. According 
to official figures, its investments in 
agriculture, energy, infrastructure, mining 
and tourism have lifted more than one 
million people out of poverty. 
This development is accompanied by 
the country’s increased integration 
into regional economic structures, 
but also by its greater participation 
in the international community. With 
6,550 personnel, Rwanda is now the 
fourth-largest contributor to United 
Nations peacekeeping operations. 
But the country wants to invest first and 
foremost in people to achieve all-inclusive 
development. That is why it places 
women at the forefront of public life. 
They paid a high price during the black 
spring in Rwanda: between 100,000 and 
250,000 women were victims of rape and 
sexual assault, these appalling weapons 
of war, recognized by the ICTR as acts 
of genocide. Since then, many of them 
have died of AIDS contracted during 
the attacks. 
In order to ensure women's protection, a 
Law on the Prevention and Punishment 
of Gender-based Violence was adopted 
in 2008. Other laws ensure their full 
participation in political and social life: 
at least thirty per cent of positions are 
reserved for women in all state bodies 
at all levels. This strategy has bridged 
the gap between men and women at 
a faster rate. Today, sixty-two per cent 
of parliamentarians, fifty per cent of 
ministers and forty-four per cent of 
officials in the judiciary are women. 
Education and health are two other 
priority sectors, which have absorbed 
thirty per cent of the annual national 
budget for several years. The rate of 
school attendance in the twelve years 
of compulsory education is ninety per 
cent and health insurance coverage is 
eighty-seven per cent.

### 367851: Le miracle rwandais

Health services have improved 
considerably in remote areas since the 
arrival of Zipline drones, which, according 
to the chief executive officer of the 
American startup, made more than 
4,000 deliveries of blood and medicine 
between October 2016 and April 2018. 
Education, too, is slowly but surely 
changing as a result of new information 
and communication technologies (ICTs), 
particularly since the launch of the 
“One laptop per child” initiative in June 
2008. Over 600,000 laptops have been 
distributed and pupils have adopted to 
share their usage on a daily basis. The 
project, however, has faced challenges, 
notably lack of electricity coverage in 
rural areas for charging the laptops 
and a lack of resources to distribute 
them to over 2.3 million schoolchildren. 
Nevertheless, ICTs are developing at full 
speed: 4,000 kilometres of fibre-optic 
cables have already been rolled out in 
the country, which has a surface area 
just exceeding 26,000 square kilometres. 
This year it is expected that wireless 
internet and fibre-optic will cover 
ninety-five per cent of the country. 
The vast majority of the population 
already has access to mobile phones and 
out of roughly 13 million inhabitants, 
more than 4 million can now shop and 
pay their bills, taxes, and even police 
fines, using mobile applications. The same 
applies to administrative procedures. 
Simply go to the portal Irembo (the word 
means access in Kinyarwanda) to find 
most government services online. 
Looking to the future 
Rwanda is focusing on technology 
development to ensure a better future. 
Banking transactions are facilitated 
through mobile services. Business leaders 
have access to e-commerce through 
the Electronic World Trade Platform 
(eWRP), launched in October 2018 by 
China's e-commerce giant Alibaba. 
Urban transport is facilitated by car 
and motorcycle services controlled via 
mobile applications.

trained thousands of young people 
free of charge, helping to launch 
sixty companies, four of which have 
become leaders in their field of activity 
and two of which have expanded 
internationally. It is one of a number of 
innovation centres that have developed, 
particularly in Kigali, the capital, with a 
view to offering young Rwandans new 
professional opportunities. 
The City of Innovation to be built as 
part of Africa50, the infrastructure

a bright technological future for Rwanda, 
which is now well positioned to become 
a regional ICT platform. Especially since 
in September 2018, artificial intelligence

Moustapha Cissé, head of Google's Al 
research centre in Ghana, and by the 
African Institute of Mathematical Sciences 
(AIMS) in Kigali. 
A quarter of a century after the genocide

### 367852: Gran Pajatén, notre forteresse géographique

Gran Pajaten, 
“our geographical fortress” 
Roldan Rojas Paredes, 
interviewed by William Navarrete 
It was a region devastated by 
intensive rubber production 
in the nineteenth century, and 
occupied by drug cartels and 
guerrillas — who made it a lawless 
zone overrun by coca plants, 
where the trafficking of cocaine 
was routine — in the 1980s. But 
today thousands of people live 
off mixed agroforestry here, 
planting cacao and other crops. In 
this area of the Central Cordillera 
of Peru, UNESCO designated the 
Gran Pajatén Biosphere Reserve 
in 2016. Roldan Rojas Paredes 
was at the heart of the project. 
With this interview, the Courier 
participates in the celebration of 
the International Day for Biological 
Diversity, 22 May. 
How would you describe the Gran Pajatén 
Biosphere Reserve to someone who has 
never heard of it? 
It is an extraordinary place, characterized 
by a great natural and cultural diversity, 
because it brings together two totally 
different habitats — the Andes and 
the Amazon. Spread over some 2.5 
million hectares, the reserve is home to 
5,000 plant species and more than 900 
animal species, about thirty of which 
are endemic. It also encompasses the 
Rio Abiseo National Park, inscribed 
on UNESCO's World Heritage List in 
1990, which has an abundance of 
archaeological remains. Since the mid- 
1980s, thirty-six pre-Columbian sites 
have been discovered here, at altitudes 
ranging from 2,500 to 4,000 metres. 
For those of us who were born here, all 
this constitutes a unique legacy, for which 
we feel responsible and which obliges us 
to think in the long term.

| see this reserve as our geographical 
fortress, offering us ideal conditions for a 
better quality of life and providing great 
opportunities for future generations. 
Personally, | have always been attached 
to working on the land, to our primary 
forests, to their impressive greenery and 
the direct energy you receive from them 
when you live here. My life has always 
been intimately linked to the cultural 
richness, legends, imagination, music and 
gastronomy of this place. This is why | left 
to study in Lima, the capital, with every 
intention of returning to devote myself 
to promoting this exceptional heritage. 
Which is what | have done. 
What does the designation of Gran Pajatén 
as a UNESCO biosphere reserve mean for 
the region's 170,000 inhabitants? 
The local population has suffered greatly 
in the past, plagued by rubber and 
drug cartels, and even guerrillas. But 
in the early 2000s, the revival of cacao 
farming enabled thousands of people to 
escape poverty and exclusion. Over time, 
 
we have developed mixed agroforestry, 
which is particularly well adapted to the 
production of cocoa, because cacao trees 
flourish in the shade of other trees. 
The inscription of our region in UNESCO's 
World Network of Biosphere Reserves 
(WNBR) in 2016 gave us a tremendous 
boost. We saw it as a sign of recognition 
of the efforts we have put into becoming 
the leading organic cocoa-producing 
region in Peru. 
This international recognition has 
opened up new opportunities for the 
Amazonia Viva Foundation (FUNDAVI), 
which works to conserve the Gran Pajatén 
ecosystem. Now, companies that were 
once sceptical and snubbed us are taking 
an interest in us. Poderosa, the precious 
metal mining company, for example, 
is investing in archaeological research 
(it has just published an excellent 
handbook), agricultural research (it has 
launched a study on potatoes) and has 
provided us with teaching materials for 
primary schools.

We are also receiving offers from new 
foreign investors, such as Chanel, the 
French fashion house, which has signed 
a collaboration agreement with our 
Biocorridor Martin Sagrado REDD + project, 
for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. 
Could you tell us more about that project? 
It provides for the conservation and 
development of 300,000 hectares of primary 
forests managed by local communities in 
the Alto Huayabamba, which is adjacent 
to the Abiseo National Park. Launched in 
2010 for a period of eighty years, it is funded 
by PUR Projet, the French social business 
enterprise, and the Jubilacién Segura 
(secure retirement) project. The latter is 
a forty-year project which implements 
agroforestry models designed to create a 
new sustainable rural economy, through 
a reforestation and carbon sequestration 
plan that helps revalue the land, to break 
the cycle of poverty for farmers who do not 
have a retirement pension. 
What are the next steps planned by 
FUNDAVI? 
We are beginning to share experiences 
between the different members within our 
biosphere reserve, such as the creation of 
botanical gardens or beekeeping farms. 
We also intend to forge alliances with 
other biosphere reserves in Peru and 
elsewhere in the world. 
We are not interested in competition. 
We want to combine strategies, to 
present and improve our activities, and 
to become a source of inspiration for all 
— in terms of the excellence of our work 
and teaching. 
We are also keen to involve more 
universities, companies, civil society, the 
State and to strive for more international 
cooperation, to take advantage of this 
fabulous “brand” of biosphere reserve — to 
ensure that the farmer, who toils on his 
plot of land day after day, feels connected 
to the whole world. 
Born in Tarapoto, 136 kilometres 
from Juanjui, the capital of Mariscal 
Caceres province in north-west Peru, 
Roldan Rojas Paredes was the driving 
force behind the creation of the 
Gran Pajatén Biosphere Reserve, He 
is currently Executive Director of the 
Amazonia Viva Foundation (FUNDAVI), 
which works to conserve the reserve’s 
ecosystem, and was a member of the 
first management committee of the Rio   Abiseo National Park in 2001. 
We want 
to become 
a source 
of Inspiration 
for all, 
IN terms of 
the excellence 
of our work 
and teaching

The goal of the World Heritage 
Convention is the conservation of places 
of Outstanding Universal Value. Since 
1978, the World Heritage List has grown 
enormously, with new sites added every 
year, and the implementation of the 
1972 World Heritage Convention has 
greatly evolved. 
This issue focuses on cases illustrating 
how appropriate action leads to 
improvements — and sometimes, 
powerful transformation — both for the 
site and the people living on or near it.
