HE violin and the melodious sounds which 
virtuosi extract from it are familiar to us all. 
But casting off the blinkers of habit, let us take a fresh 
look at this modest wooden case. How extraordinary it 
is that a few plates of thin wood, and the friction of 
horsehair on four strings should be able to produce the 
quivering strains which lead and dominate an orchestra, 
the powerful and moving voice that holds large audiences 
in thrall. The miracle of the violin is indeed a miracle 
of human art and ingenuity, which has never yet been 
fully explained by science. 
When the great Italian violin-makers of the sixteenth 
and seventeenth centuries constructed models of string- 
ed instruments which have never since been rivalled. 
they received no help from acoustics, a science which did 
not then exist. Yet, by a process of trial and error, 
repeated experiments and empirical research, and thanks 
to the kind of intuition which rewards tenaclous effort, 
they managed to achieve remarkable results and to 
create sounding-boxes that correspond in every way to 
the laws of modern acoustics. 
The making of a stringed instrument is more than a 
matter of technique. There are so many subtle rela- 
tionships between its component parts, between the 
choice of the wood and the way in which it is worked, 
between the capacity of the resonant box and the 
thickness of its wooden plates, and between the wood and 
the varnish, that no formula can be a guarantee of 
success. 
The instrument-maker’s personal talent is all-impor- 
tant; his experience and skill cannot be conveyed in writ- 
ten instructions, but must be passed on from man to man 
in the course of a long apprenticeship. As a matter of 
fact, this is unfortunate, because the old instrument- 
maker's art is In great danger of being lost. 
The quality of stringed instruments, of which violins, 
violas and violoncellos are the most important, depends 
primarily upon the wood of which they are made: epicea 
ercelsa for the upper part or belly, maple for the back 
and the “ribs” which form a violin’s sides, ebony for the 
finger-board, and Guiana “bees’ wood” or Pernambuco 
wood for the bow. Epicea, a variety of pine, is found in 
Switzerland; maple is scattered through some valleys 
of Central Europe. The wood must be compact and fine- 
grained, without knots, but with the “ripples” which 
make the varnish shimmer. 
Exposure, soil and climate have as much influence on 
a crop of wood as they have on vines; the wood must be 
cut “di quarto”, that is, not lecngitudinally, but from the 
bark to the heart, like the lith of an orange; only the 
central part of the trunk—not too near the roots, where 
the wood would be too damp, or too near the top, where 
the sun would have dried it out—is considered satis- 
factory; and, lastly, the part exposed to the south is 
held to be the best. All these prescriptions give an idea 
of the care taken by stringed-instrument makers in 
choosing their raw material. 
The work of a master violin-maker is done entirely by 
hand, and by the same craftsman, except for the bow, 
The Indian ravanastron is 
believed to be the oldest of 
instruments played with a 
bow. It may have travelled 
to Arabia to become the 
rebab (1). The rebab was 
perhaps the father of the 
rebec, reconstituted versions 
of which are shown here (2), 
though this mediaeval strin- 
ged instrument may be a 
descendant of earlier Wes- 
tern ones. .Most widely-used 
bowed instrument of the 
Middle Ages was the viol. 
Shown here are three “love 
viols” from Germany and 
Italy (3). The instrument ma- 
kers of the Tyrol and Cremo- 
na, in northern lealy, trans- 
formed the viol into violins 
like this Stradivarius(4) dating 
from 1724. Thisviolin(5)once 
belonged to Johann Strauss.

executed by a skilled bow-maker. Despite the simplicity 
of its outline, a violin is composed of 83 to 85 parts, all 
of which must be fashioned wlth the utmost care. 
The violin-maker, with the help of a mould, cuts out 
the back, which is generally made of two pleces glued 
together so that the graining of the wood corresponds. 
He fines down the arch of the belly so as to give it the 
necessary convexity, forms the curve of the ribs with 
a hot iron, calculates the size of the neck, which he fits 
to the instrument, uses a penknife to cut the sound- 
holes in the belly—S-shaped holes which give the ins- 
trument its resonance and elegance—mounts the pegs 
and bridge. 
Lastly, with a little tool inserted in the sound-holes, 
he fixes that essential part of the instrument which the 
Italians and French call the soul and the Germans the 
voice of the violin. This Is a wooden cylinder, designed

it awaits its finest adornment—the famous “varnish”, so

the instrument's elegant curves and enables the light to

of the varnish is to protect the violln against the ravages 
of time and climate; it Is highly Important because, even

MUSIC ON 
A STRING 
(Cont'd) 
In the early days of the 
Renaissance, there were two 
groups of stringed instruments 
in Europe: vielles, which were 
once used to accompany trou- 
bador songs (and later evolved 
into organistrums, or large 
hurdy-gurdies) and the nobler 
family of the viols, bowed 
instruments whose gradual 
modification no doubt pro- 
duced the violin, the most 
important of modern stringed 
instruments. The legendary 
name of Stradivarius domi. 
nates this branch of instru- 
ment-making, which demands 
great manual skill and a 
perfect ear for tone. Below, 
a well-known French violin 
maker, Emile Frangais, in his 
Paris workshop. Left, violins 
drying after being varnished. 
Varnish protects a violin but 
can also affect its resonance.

### 63629: Music on a string

A lost secret of the Cremona craftsmen 
Instruments their inimitable golden or reddish tortolse- 
shell colour, Is a lost secret. No chemical analysis has yet 
revealed its composition. Some plants in the Tyrolese 
woods are sald to have produced a gum which, collected 
in special bags, supplied the violln-makers of Cremona 
with the maln ingredient of their ofl varnish. 
The last person able to secure these bags of gum 
appears to have been Carlo Bergonzi, disciple of 
Stradivari, who bought the master’s workshop after his 
death. Once the trees ylelding it had been felled, this 
gum could no longer be found, and the varnish has never 
since been the same. However, time, which mellows 
the tone of old instruments, has probably also given their 
wood its Inimitable patina. 
Strings are quite, or almost, as dellcate a matter. 
Those used by the Italian craftsmen were produced in 
the central and southern parts of the peninsula, especially 
in Naples; the gut was derived from the Intestines of 
seven or eight-month-old lambs. This gut was left to 
soak for a long time in alkalinized water before being 
dried and twisted. It was believed that the exposure 
of the pasture-lands, the season at which the lambs 
were slaughtered and the kind of water used influenced 
the quality of the strings and especially thelr resistance. 
In fact, that resistance is extraordinary, considering 
that the four violln strings are subjected to a total 
tension of over 50 pounds. LL 
Thus we see what subtle alchemy of plant and animal 
matter and what intuitive, meticulous craftsmanship 
are needed in order that wood, gut and horsehair may be 
transformed into that great, enchanting voice, with its 
infinite modulations, which by another miracle of human 
genius, can be heard today in every home. 
The first stringed instrument was a gift of nature, a 
tortoise-shell converted into a sounding-box by a few 
strings stretched across it. That is why the lyre retained 
the name of chelys In Greek and testudo In Latin, And 
according to classical tradition, the first stringed-ins- 
trument maker was Orpheus, who replaced the linen 
threads of the lyre with strings made from the intestines 
of animals. 
Stringed Instruments are found among primitive 
peoples: the Negro viol of Nyasaland has a bow made 
of two strips of willow, one straight and the other curved. 
But muslcologists generally agree that the earliest 
ancestor of the violin Is the ravanastron, which has all 
the same features: resonant box, neck, bridge, pegs, 
strings made of gazelles' Intestines and bow. This Ins- 
trument is said to have been invented over five thousand 
years ago by Ravana, king of Ceylon, a ten-headed glant. 
It 1s sUill sometimes seen in Indla, In the hands of certaln 
mendicant Buddhist monks. 
The story goes that the ravanasiron, transported from 
India to Persia and thence to Arabla, became the Arablan 
rebab, which, in Europe, engendered the rebee, a small, 
three-stringed bowed Instrument played by the minlstrels. 
On the other hand, Breton bards before the Moorish 
Invasion used a bowed Instrument called the crwth, 
which was an Improved version of the rebab. Was the 
latter Imported into the East by the Crusaders? Or did 
they bring it back from Palestine? Or else, as ethno- 
musicology would seem to testify, did the various forms 
of bowed stringed Instruments make thelr appearance 
as Independent Inventions in different countries? 
At all events, by the beginning of the Renalssance In 
Europe, there were two groups of stringed instruments: 
vielles, which, atter being used to accompany troubadour 
songs, evolved Into organistrums, or large hurdy-gurdies,

MUSIC ON A STRING (Cont'd) 
Masterpieces from 
a prison cell 
the entertalnment of drinking parties; and the nobler 
family of the viols, bowed instruments which may or may 
not have been derived from the vielle. The gradual 
modification of early viols doubtless produced the violin, 
the most important of modern stringed instruments. ° 
The first violins are generally attributed to Gasparo 
da Salo, who, together with Maggini, founded the famous 
school of Brescia in Lombardy. Yet a few years before 
Salo’s birth in 1533, Francis I of France was already 
travelling with elght violin players in his train. There 
was probably an uncertain period during which various 
modifications of the viol were called violins, although 
the proportions of the violin had not yet been established. 
Such hesitation is evidenced by the fact that the French 
word violon means “large viol”, whilst the Italian violino 
means a small-sized viol. 
The Brescia school later seemed primitive in comparison 
with that of Cremona, founded in the seventeenth 
century by the Amati dynasty, the most famous member 
of which, Nicola, lived to be eighty-eight (1596-1684) 
and was the master of Stradivarius. His small violins, 
with their strong voice and brilliant, transparent varnish, 
were already masterpieces. 
Asie legend surrounds Giuseppe Guarnieri 
(1683-1745), known as “del Gesu”, because, 
in order to distinguish himself from the other violin- 
makers of the family, he adopted a label on which his 
name was followed by the three letters I.H.S. (Iesus 
Hominum Salvator) surmounted by a cross. His violins 
have acquired such a reputation that a “del Gest” has 
become a common expression. It was, for instance, on a 
“del Gesu”, which he donated to his native city of 
Genoa, that Paganini played. 
The story is that, despite his pious nickname, Guarnieri, 
who only began his career as a violin-maker at the age of 
thirty-eight, produced his best instruments while in 
prison, Some of them are called “prison violins” or 
“the servant-girl's violins”, in memory of the goaler’s 
daughter who is supposed to have supplied him with the 
material he required. 
The greatest and best-known of the violin-makers of 
Cremona was Stradivari—Stradivarius in Latin—whose 
name has become synonymous with the finest and most 
valuable violins. He lived to be ninety-three and had 
two wives and fourteen children, only two of whom took 
up the craft. Starting as a pupil of Nicola Amati, he began 
to sign his instruments, using his own label from 1670 
onwards, and had very soon surpassed his master. 
After this first thirty-year period, known as the 
“Amitized” period because of the influence of Amati’s 
models, he developed his own style through passionately 
keen and unremitting labour; and it was to remain 
unrivalled. He designed his model with sober grandeur, 
the height of the vaulting was reduced, the volume of 
air in resonating bodies methodically refined, the thick- 
nesses accurately calculated and the exact intonation of 
the woods ascertained. The Magginis had a veiled, mel- 
ancholy voice, the Amatis a soft, silvery one; but Stra- 
divarius was the first to be able to combine strength 
and sweetness, vigour and tenderness. 
The Cremona master chose his woods with the greatest 
care and tried to use the same piece for the back and 
the ribs. His backs were often in one piece. He rounded 
oft angles lovingly and decorated them with faultless 
profiling. His angles were cut in an elegant manner 
all his own; the paraph of the sound-holes was exquisitely 
fine. His varnishes were incomparable, thoroughly 
resistant, sometimes amber-coloured, sometimes tending 
towards a russet shade called rossino, and always highly 
transparent. 
The whole of Stradivari’s long life (1644-1737) was

For almost three centur-

have been carrying on 
the great traditions they 
inherited from the crafts- 
men of Italy. In the small 
town of Mirecourt, on 
the borders of Lorraine, 
veteran violin makers 
like this one examining 
a finished instrument 
(above) still hand on the 
secrets of their craft to 
new generations. Left, 
a violin back is prepared 
and (below left) finished 
parts are fitted together. 
The work of making and 
assembling well over 80 
parts for each violin is 
done entirely by hand. 
When meticulous skill 
and loving care have 
done their utmost, the 
result is an instrument 
worthy of concert artists 
like the Czech violinist,

MUSIC ON A STRING (Cont'd) 
Stradivarius inspires 
French violin village 
devoted not only to making instruments—violins, viols, 
vloloncellos, double basses, lutes and pocket-violins—but 
also to research and experiment. Those who knew him 
have described hls tall, lean, figure. He always wore a 
white cap—a woollen one in winter and a cotton one in 
summer. While working, he wore a white leather apron 
and, we are told, “since he was always working, hls 
costume hardly varied”. Corelli may have given him 
advice for the perfecting of a violin;but no virtuoso could 
advise him about the violoncello, then considered as an 
instrument of secondary importance, and yet his ‘cellos 
are the best ever made. 
Artists such as Boccherini, Tartini, Kreutzer, Kramer, 
Lafont, Rode, Pugnani and Sarasate made the sound 
of Stradlvarious violins famous. Some of these, the 
“Rode”, the “Messiah”, the *Dolphin” and the “Dawn” 
are considered to be the Cremona craftsman’s master- 
pleces. Henceforth, the power and range of stringed 
Instruments made it possible for them to leave the 
drawing-rooms of the aristocracy and reach an in- 
creasingly wide public In theatres and blg concert halls. 
Although Stradivarius was to give the violin its final 
form and style, the instrument had already been known 
and even popular in France, England and Flanders since 
the middle of the Sixteenth century. Violin-makers 
worked In those countries; in Paris, they fashioned the 
instruments under the supervision of musicians and were 
sometimes classified with braziers. The following century 
witnessed the appearance in France of great violin- 
makers, such as Nicolas Lupot, who made a very careful 
study of the Stradivarius proportions, and Médard, who 
set up his workshop at Nancy. 
] HUSs France inherited from Cremona. Paris 
violin-makers are all grouped in the “Euro- 
pe” quarter, but it is, above all, the small town of Mire- 
court, on the borders of Lorraine, which has long 
specialized in the art of stringed-instrument making. The 
first historical document concerning Mirecourt violin- 
making dates from 1637 and Is a contract binding an ap- 
prentice to his master. For over three centuries, therefore, 
the people of Mirecourt have been teaching or learning 
how to cut, adjust, assemble and varnish stringed-instru- 
ments with the famous “Italian sonority”. 
There Is a historical explanation of this tradition. 
When the Dukes of Lorraine, great patrons of the acts, 
went to stay in their castle at Ravenel—a few walls of 
which are still standing—they brought with them their 
musicians and, In particular, their violin-maker, named 
Tywersus, who had worked in Cremona. Tywersus taught 
the craft to a few inhabitants of the village near the 
castle, and they transmitted their knowledge to their 
descendants. 
In 1732, the violin-makers of Mirecourt received their 
charters as a corporation from Francis II, Duke of Lor- 
raine. Today, workshops of instrument makers survive 
at Mirecourt alongside modern industry; the work is 
done by hand, skilfully and lovingly, and with respect 
for Renaissance traditions. 
There are other centres of the art in Austria, the 
Netherlands and Italy, where high quality vioclin-making 
1s by no means dead, as well as In other European 
countries. But heavy competition comes from mass- 
produced work; the instrument market is quickly satur- 
ated, and apprenticeship is long and difficult at a time 
when young people are faced with openings in less 
exacting and more lucrative trades. 
Will the master violin-maker of today find disciples 
to whom they can bequeath their knowledge? It is to be 
hoped so, for the perfection of these resonating bodies 
is one of music's secret weapons, and instrumental 
nmusic—henceforth accessible everywhere, a joy and 
comfort to all, as well as a common language—has an 
even greater and more vital part to play in modern times 
than in the past.

seals, penguins and graceful seabirds like those above on 
the South American coast, is widespread oil pollution. 
The International Conference on the Prevention of 
Pollution of the Sea, convened, by the Inter- 
Governmental Maritime Consultative Organization 
(IMCO), ended on April 13, 1962, with the signing of 
the Final Act of the Conference by representatives 
of 40 nations. These countries represent over two- 
thirds of the world's shipping tonnage and well 
over half the oil tanker tonnage. A number of other 
countries sent observers to the Conference. 
POLLUTION is due chiefly to tankers washing out stor- 
age tanks before taking on a new load or through ordinary 
cargo ships replacing the fuel they burn by water ballast, 
and later discharging this contaminated water. Below, 
petrol tankers take on oil at Kuwait on the Persian Gulf.

Antonio Quintana, Chile 
N the shores of the seven seas, from the 
Antarctic to Florida and all along the West 
coast of Europe, the pollution of the sea by oil fuel 
has for years been an unmitigated nulsance to all 
those 'who look to the seashore for their pleasure or 
for their livelihood. 
Oil, washed up on the beaches, and left behind by the 
receding tide, is at the least unpleasant. It spoils the 
enjoyment of swimmers and holiday makers, ruining 
their clothes and their shoes. If these conditions prevail 
over any length of coastline, the dispirited holiday maker 
can pack up and go home, or if he is lucky during the 
holiday season find somewhere else to go; but thousands 
of people whose livelihood is provided by the seaside,

POLLUTED SEAS (Cont'd) 
Messages in plastic bottles 
dropped by the thousand in the sea 
In the Antarctic the plight of seals and penguins 
covered with oll has touched the hearts of even the 
tough whaling men. Dr. Harry R. Lillie, a former surgeon 
to an Antarctic whaling fleet, sald in a newspaper 
interview: 
“I have found half-grown seals covered in a sticky tarry 
mess, their eyes bloodshot with irritation; and penguins 
hopelessly clogged, walting for a slow death.” 
Dr. Lillie added that he had spent a lot of time cleaning 
up the birds on board the factory ship: 
“I must say with respect to the whaling crews, they 
were generally little concerned with the .suffering of 
harpooned whales, but I never found any of the men 
around me who ever felt that our butter supply was too 
good to be used to clean up oiled penguins.” 
The fact that pollution has become a major problem is 
due to the enormous growth of oil fuel used throughout 
the world—a fifty-fold increase in the last 40 years, and 
almost all this oil is carried about the world in tankers. 
Sa Gilmour Jenkins, President of the IMCO 
Conference which met in April, told the 
meeting: 
“Last year 500 million tons of oil were carried across 
the seas and oceans of the world. If we assume that only 
a very small proportion, say one part in a thousand, of 
this vast amount found its way into the sea in the form 
of persistent waste, we get the terrifying total of half a 
million tons.” 
This oll, for the most part, is the sludge left behind in 
the tanks of the ships after they have discharged their 
cargo. The tanks are washed out by sprays of hot water 
and pumped into the sea. And there it floats. Man has 
always used the sea as a vast cesspit, for such various 
commodities as sewage, unwanted high explosives and 
atomic waste. But the oily waste is persistent and may 
well stay in the sea for ever. 
A secondary source of thls oil is the practice of oil- 
fuelled merchant ships replacing the fuel which they 
burn during a voyage by water ballast. Later, the water 
ballast, now contaminated by oil, is pumped out, and 
another addition is made to the pollution of the high seas. 
To deal with the whole problem two approaches are 
being tried. One is to limit the areas of the sea in which 
oily waste may be pumped overboard. The other is the 
use of machinery on board ship, known as separators, 
which remove the oil from the waste water or the provi- 
sion at ports of plant to receive the tank washings. These 
are both fairly expensive proceedings. A separator also 
may cost between £500 and £1,000 ($1,400 and $2,800). 
At one large port for oil tankers, the plant to receive tank 
washings has cost some £300,000 ($784,000). At the same 
time, the period spent in getting rid of the washings must 
be cut to an absolute minimum. Every day's delay to a 
big tanker can easily cost as much as $1,000. 
Ae source of oil on the sea, happily much 
rarer, is through accidents, when a ship is lost 
and her oil tanks perforated, or when the oil fuel must be 
jettisoned to free the ship from a position of danger. As 
one example of the damage that may be caused under 
such circumstances, there is the case of a tanker which 
ran aground at the mouth of the river Elbe, and lightened 
herself by pumping overboard 6,000 tons of oil. An 
enormous floating island of oil was thus released, which 
slowly drifted about the North Sea. Oil islands like this 
usually last for some 50 miles before they break up and 
patches float away, but the record is held by an oil island 
which appeared in the Red Sea and covered a distance 
of 500 miles before it began to dissipate. 
As for the oil island from the Elbe, some of it came 
ashore on the island of Sylt, where the authorities spent 
vast sums of money to get rid of it. A little further to 
the north, six miles of beach on the island of Fanoe, off 
Esbjerg, were covered with oil. The Danes tried spraying 
it with sawdust and then attacking it with flame throwers, 
but the oil survived, and the sand that it had contaminat- 
ed had to be bulldozed into open trenches. 
Another example of the difficulty of getting rid of the 
0il was provided by a tanker which was in collision In the 
Solent, off Portsmouth, in England, a couple of years ago. 
Two months later the authorities of that town were still 
trying to clean up the mess. An enormous tonnage of 
oily shingle had to be taken away and four thousand tons 
of clean shingle brought in to take its place. 
Among recent experiments made to get rid of oil which 
has accumulated in this way has been a Danish attempt 
OIL-FOULED BEACHES are a major headache for swimmers, holiday makers and local authorities. 
Freeing them of the slimy, black oil that sometimes comes ashore is a major operation. Below left, clean- 
ing up an oil-polluted beach at Portsmouth, England. At Rampen, Germany (below right) an oil “island” 
that drifted in with the tide had to be ploughed into the sand to a depth of three feet before it was clear.

© RSPCA OIL CAKED SEABIRD Is one of countless thousands that each year pay the penalty of years of 
unchecked oil-dumping at sea. They are tossed up in flocks of thousands (a quarter of a million are 
believed to perish around the coasts of Great Britain each year} feathers too matted by oll to fly. 
to impregnate the oil with a powder which would cause 
it to sink. Some fully effective remedy of this sort may 
eventually be devised, but it will always be expensive; 
the logical way of dealing with most of the oil in the sea 
is to prevent its deliberate discharge and to encourage the 
wider use of facilities ashore. This, in fact, was what the 
IMCO Conference did. 
The world's conscience had already been aroused 
by the oil pollution problem before 1962. An Inter- 
national Convention on Pollution of the Sea by 
Oil was drawn up at a conference held in London 
during 1954 and was later ratified by 17 nations, including 
many of the largest shipowning countries. Scientific 
Investigation was undertaken and, In some cases, was 
followed by legislative action. 
To start with, it was necessary to plot the ocean 
currents which carry the oil. For that purpose, aircraft 
dropped thousands of plastic envelopes into the sea. 
Inside each envelope was a message inviting the finder to 
say where the envelope had been found. And a piece of 
cork which made certain that the envelope floated. Two 
vessels of the International force of weather ships dropped 
an envelope overboard every day of the year 1954 at noon. 
The results of all this research were plotted by the 
British National Institute of Oceanography. 
Ses governments also took legislative action. 
For example, the United Kingdom Introduced 
the Oil in Navigable Waters Act which forbade British 
ships to discharge oil within 50 miles of the coast. But 
national measures could not be successful by themselves ; 
it was clearly necessary to persuade all nations owning 
large merchant fleets to adopt the same kind of measures. 
This was the background to the IMCO Conference of 1962 
where a number of resolutions were unanimously adopted 
which aim at increasing the effectiveness of the earlier 
measures and at strengthening them through a new Con- 
vention. Many delegates emphasized the importance of 
mineral oils to man, but deplored hls casual approach to 
the foullng of seas or shores and the destruction of birds 
and marine life. 
The new Convention has considerably increased the 
areas of the sea In which it is forbidden to discharge oll. 
Formerly flxed as any area less than 50 miles from the 
coast, this zone has now been increased in many parts 
of the world. 
Discharge is now completely forbidden in the North Sea 
and the Baltic; the 50-mile limit has been superseded by a 
limit of 100 miles off the North-Eastern coast of North 
America, the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Persian 
Gulf as well as the west coast of Canada, the Atlantic 
coast of Spaln, the coast of Portugal, the Arabian Sea, 
the Bay of Bengal and Australian waters. 
Three years after the ratification of the agreement by 
the Soviet Union and Rumania, the Black Sea and the 
Sea of Azov will become a zone in which discharge of 
ofl ls completely forbidden. These arrangements are 
probably rather more than a halfway house to an eventual 
ban on the discharge of oil anywhere at sea. 
Clearly the seas of the world will not become suddenly 
cleaner as a result of the April Conference or the new 
Convention. But. useful progress has been made. Much 
will depend on the+oll companies which control a large 
share of the world’s tanker tonnage. And, as William 
Graham, Acting Secretary-General of IMCO, sald, “no 
truly successful result can be achieved without the active 
co-operation of those directly responsible for operations 
on board ship and ashore which may cause oil pollution.”

THE OCEAN 
UNDER 
A MICROSCOPE 
by L. Howell-Rivero 
Te sea Is populated by myriads of microscopic 
organisms known as plankton. The vast major- 
ity of these marine biota are so small that if we were 
to take a glass of sea water and look at it with the naked 
eye, we should only see—after close examination—a serles 
of dots which might make the water appear muddy. 
Viewing a sample under a strong magnifying glass, how- 
ever, we should see that these dots consist of living bodies. 
Their composition is very varied; some of them are 
unicellular plants (phytoplankton), others are animals 
(zooplankton); they also include microscopic animals and 
other marine animals in their larval state. 
  
  
   
STRANGELY-SHAPED DIATOMS are a form of 
phytoplankton from the ocean which have a shell of 
pure silica crystals. How these tiny organisms extract 
the silica from sea-water solutions is still a mystery. 
ONE-EYED CYCLOPS is a minute animal of the 
copepod family found in parts of the Baltic Sea. Cope- 
pods are an important food for the sea's edible fish. 
These organisms are clearly of very great importance, 
since phytoplankton is at the origin of what is known 
as the food chain; it derives its own nourishment from 
the nutrient salts in the sea-water, uses sunlight as a 
source of energy and in turn acts as food for zooplankton 
and other marine animals further up the scale. Thus, 
the productivity of a given zone can be deduced from 
the quantity of nutrient salts and plankton it contains. 
There are many features of this microscopic world 
which claim our attention and cause us to marvel at the 
wisdom of Nature. Among the phytoplankton, for 
instance, there is that group of microscopic algae, known 
as diatoms, which have a shell of pure silica crystals with 
varied and fantastic shapes. How do these tiny organisms 
extract the silica from the different sea-water solutions 
to make their shells? 
In other microbiota, such as the foraminifera type of 
zooplankton the shell is calcareous like that of sea-shells; 
here the question is how can the soluble carbonate of 
lime be made to create such insoluble shells ? 
These are some of the mysteries to which Man must 
find the answer if he is to take up Nature's challenge.

In spite of their mysterious origin, these minute orga- 
nisms provide clues to the history of our planet since, 
as their shells settled in the depths of the sea throughout 
the ages, they became part of the radiolarian, forami- 
niferous and other types of ooze layers. 
If we recall the theories concerning the marine origin 
of petroleum deposits, we shall see why the study of 
foraminifera in the different geological strata of our 
planet Is one of the basic means of determining the 
possible location of “black gold”. 
Let us turn, however, to the great planktonic mass 
formed by other marine animals in thelr larval state: 
a vast and fascinating world lies before us when we 
consider the changes and metamorphoses that some of 
them undergo before they become the creatures we are 
accustomed to see, such as oysters, sea-urchins, lobsters 
and all kinds of fish. 
Certain species of common oyster which, when full- 
grown, are sedentary and are found attached to the roots 
of coastal plants such as the mangrove, move about freely 
when in their larval state until they find a suitable 
place to cling and develop into the commercial form which 
can later be eaten by Man. During this short larval 
period, they live of phytoplankton and move by means 
of a crown of fronds, reminiscent of helicopter blades. 
The larval state typical of certain sea molluscs which 
scientists call “veliger larva” reveal a number of varied 
and interesting structures. One of the most fascinating 
subjects of zoological research is that of the development 
of these structures. 
We have all seen sea-urchins and star-fish on beaches 
or have felt their sharp spikes in our feet. They again, 
Photos @ L. J. Laporte, Paris 
in their larval state, bear no resemblance to the fully- 
grown species. In the case of star-fish, for Instance, a 
small bi-symmetrical organism is transformed on meta- 
morphosis into a creature with radial symmetry. 
Even when {ts animal organisms can move of their own 
free-will this does not prevent plankton from being 
carried away by the great ocean currents, which thus 
distribute the different marine species over wide areas. 
A typlcal example is provided by the marine lobster 
In the Caribbean. The adult species Is found on the 
coral sea-board of the whole area washed by the same 
set of currents, which also ensure its distribution by 
carrying the larvae away. 
Here again, we encounter a great difference between 
adult and larval forms. The larvae of lobsters look 
like transparent spiders with long legs and no feelers. 
At birth, each is about the size of a full-stop on this page. 
As they grow, the features associated with the adult 
lobster gradually begin to appear and the larval charac- 
teristics are lost. When they are hardly more than an 
Inch long, they select the coastal stretch where they will 
turn into the lobsters that will subsequently be eaten. 
There are many varieties of fish which undergo con-- 
siderable transformations from the time they are born 
until they become full-grown. We shall consider the two 
most outstanding examples. 
The first is the eel. This fish, which lives in European 
and American rivers, migrates to the distant Sargasso 15

sits of their calcareous shells in sediment geologists can 
reconstruct the history of the waters in which they lived.

Sea to spawn; its larvae then begin their return journey 
to their respective continents during metamorphosis. 
At first these transparent, planktonic organisms are very 
minute, and when they reach the river mouths they are 
scarcely two inches long; at this point they are sometimes 
caught and sold as canned “fry”. Sclentific research has 
established the relationship between the larvee and the 
adult of this species, but there are many other specles 
which have yet to be Investigated. 
The other example worthy of note Is that of the plalce 
or sole. Everyone must have noticed that their eyes are 
on the same side of thelr bodies. But they were not born 
like that. As tiny creatures in their larval state, they 
are bl-symmetrical and have the shape of a normal fish, 
with one eye on each side of the head. 
By one of Nature's quirks, one of their eyes moves 
over to the other side, with the result that the head bones 
become twisted; it Is in this way that the peculiar features 
of the fully-grown fish are produced. However, does one 
eye In particular move from one side to the other? Here 
again, Nature challenges us to discover the design behind 
her apparent capriciousness. In some species, It is the 
left eye which moves, in others it is the right eye, and 
in yet others, this movement is unpredictable. 
We can therefore see the enormous problem facing the 
scientists who wish to learn about marine life; in order 
to catch these microbiota, they have to make use of such 
special methods and techniques as plankton nets; after 
the plankton has been caught, it has to be studied not 
only for Itself, but also for its possible long-term 
practical value. 
The reader may ask: What can plankton be used for? 
Is there any special justification for the efforts made to 
catch and study it? What benefits does it bring to Man? 
Science is attempting to give a satisfactory answer to 
these questions. 
The relationship between nutrients and phytoplankton 
is a guide to the economic potentialities of an area and 
hence to areas where fish of commercial value may be 
able to exist in abundance. In addition, there are species 
of zooplankton which reveal the presence of fish of 
commercial value. Lastly, plankton itself provides food 
for many different kinds of fish, This makes us wonder 
whether Man himself could not use plankton for food. 
Although it is reasonable to expect the time and effort 
devoted to marine research to be justified by practical 
applications, the research in itself is valuable in so far 
as it reveals that Man is making an effort to learn more 
about the natural phenomena surrounding him, their 
causes and effects, and about the organisms living in a 
given medium. Perhaps one of the most interesting and 
least known of such flelds is that of microscopic sea-life.

The anatomy of underdevelopment (Part 2) 
PATTERNS OF ECONOMIC CHANGE 
All countries are in some respects underdeveloped for all are still in 
the development process. But broad distinctions can nevertheless be 
made between the different levels of development that have been ach- 
ieved. These different characteristics are analyzed in the following arti- 
cle, the second of a series whose publication began in the July-August 
issue of The Unesco Courier. They are taken from a new study produced 
by the United Nations as part of the World Campaign Against Hunger. 
oceans, or the opportunity for all to 
partake of its benefits, is essential to economic 
progress. It Is not, however, an end In itself. Schools, 
hospitals, museums, art galleries, theatres are built not 
for thelr own sake, but to serve specific purposes, and fac- 
tories are no exception. They are indispensable tools in 
the struggle to ralse living standards among the less for- 
tunate of the world’s people. This is a fundamental objec- 
tive of the United Nations and the sole purpose of 
the technical assistance programmes. 
Factories, mines, power stations, transport undertakings 
and so on are symbols of the economic development by 
which this raising of living standards can be achieved. 
Economic development must go hand in hand with 
the production of more food, the improvement of 
health, the spread of education and the promotion 
of social welfare and human rights. It will help 
Economic growth, symbolized by Industrialization, 
to put more money Into the pockets of the people who 
need it. Without that Increase In spending power, the 
people In the “underdeveloped” countries cannot know 
freedom from misery and want. 
The most striking difference between the developed 
and the underdeveloped countries lies, as we have seen, 
In the standard of living attained by the majority of 
thelr people—In other words, in the extent to which 
the national income is distributed through wide strata 
of the population. It is, however, possible to attempt 
some more exact definition of the term underdeveloped. 
An underdeveloped country might be deseribed os one 
in which the natural and human resources are used for 
economic purposes to only a very lmited degree. The

UNDERDEVELOPMENT (Cont'd) 
Innovations that changed history’s course 
machinery necessary to make proper use of them are 
partly, or wholly lacking. Such a definition is no more 
than rough and ready. The word “resource” itself needs 
clarification. We might say that, in the economic sense, 
a resource only becomes a resource when it can be put 
to an appropriate use. Until that time, the richest 
resources are valueless in themselves. 
If we look back over the long history of mankind, we 
see a perlod, perhaps lasting up to half a million years 
or more, during which the food gatherers and hunters of 
the Palaeolithic, or Old Stone Age, wandered countless 
times across what was later to be recognized as rich 
arable land without being able to make the slightest use 
of it. It was probably not more than ten thousand 
years ago that the first Neolithic farmers, by sowing 
and harvesting grain, discovered the possibilities inherent 
in such land. Thanks to this innovation, they took 
to living in settled communities and so changed the 
course of human history. 
We can find plenty of examples nearer our own time, 
In fact, the more complex civilization has become, the 
more intense has been the search for new resources or 
new uses for old resources. Coal was occasionally used 
in the Middle Ages, but its real value as a natural 
resource was discovered only when the factories of the 
industrial revolution created a demand for fuel which 
could not be met by the diminishing woodlands of late 
elghteenth and early nineteenth-century England. 
A T a further stage in the industrial revolution, 
oll began to take the place of coal as a fuel 
and the vast deposits lying under the Middle East, 
Central America, Texas, the Caspian Sea area and 
elsewhere acquired immense economic importance for the 
industrialized civilization of the twentieth century. 
During the last few years, several countries have discov- 
ered that their deposits of uranium have tremendous 
value. Only a generation ago, little attention would 
have been paid to them. Because resources hecome 
resources only when a use Is found for them, it follows 
that new discoveries may at any moment reveal value in 
hitherto neglected materials or new uses for resources 
already being exploited. Even the most highly developed 
countries may therefore possess natural resources which 
still contribute nothing to their economic life. 
As long as this is the case and as long as those coun- 
tries continue the search to improve their techniques 
and to use the sum total of their natural and human 
resources to better purpose, even advanced countries 
are still in the process of development, or are technically 
underdeveloped. Moreover, as the easily accessible 
supply of certain minerals begins to fail under the heavy 
demands of industry, new sources are constantly being 
turned to account by technological research. An exam- 
ple would be the extraction of magnesium from the sea, 
now a considerable industry in the United States. 
It looks as if two great steps forward will be taken 
shortly when automation and atomic energy begin to 
play a leading part in industrial life. Automation, which 
is merely an extension of the use of machines to replace 
workers and of electronic equipment to replace brains, is 
beginning to revolutionize industrial prospects. Perhaps, 
when the economically advanced countries of today look 
back, fifty years hence, from the early atomic-automation 
era, they will regard their present condition as having 
18 been very “underdeveloped” indeed. 
Bearing these facts in mind, we can still list certain 
characteristic features which distinguish the countries 
that have not yet set out upon the road of economic 
progress or have advanced only a little way along fit. 
Generally speaking, most of the people living in such 
countries get their livelihood from agriculture of a pri- 
mitive kind, which yields them only a bare subsistence 
and little or no surplus for exchange purposes. 
Industries tend to be few and thelr level of output 
per worker is very low, as a result of the low level of 
capital per worker. Transportation facilities are gene- 
rally inadequate. Such countries tend to have widespread 
underemployment, illiteracy, poor housing, low nutri- 
tion and health standards and an acute shortage both 
of educated people and of teachers. 
T is broadly true that the economically un- 
derdeveloped countries mostly lie in the hotter 
regions of the earth’s surface. Many of them have 
experienced colonial status, the traces of which have 
often been left on the national economy. In many of 
the less developed countries, an industry extracting one 
specific local raw material or product has long had a 
preponderating place. This may be a mineral or a vege- 
table product such as rubber, coffee or cocoa. Fluctua- 
tions in the price of such commodities on the world 
market tend to make the economic life of the country 
concerned unstable, and this economic Instability is 
another characteristic shared by many of the underde- 
veloped countries. 
It would be difficult to say how many of the world’s 
inhabitants live in the underdeveloped areas, because 
we have seen that there is no precise definition of the 
term underdeveloped. It is obvious, however, that much 
of Asia, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East would 
be covered by any normal use of the term “economically 
underdeveloped area.” These reglons comprise between 
them some 75 per cent of the world’s population. 
As only a small fraction of their inhabitants enjoy a 
standard of living which could be described as high or 
even adequate, and, as some people even in the more 
developed areas are living on the subsistence level, prob- 
ably three-quarters of the world’s men and women are 
at present condemned to a life of grim poverty and often 
of bitter hardship. 
Economic development is the means by which those 
material hardships can be reduced and by which poverty 
can be attacked at its root. 
T stages in the process of economic dev- 
elopment have been distinguished. At first, 
communities are primarily agricultural and mostly self- 
supporting. Next, a network of commercial and exchange 
activities is developed. Then follows the introduction of 
manufacturing industry. 
The beginnings of exchange in an agricultural soclety 
usually concern a surplus of local products, such as salt 
or fish. When markets begin to take shape, commo- 
dities specially produced for sale acquire Increasing 
importance. As money becomes more generally used, 
there is greater specialization both in producing and in 
selling goods.

The slow emergence of industries 
This type of society remains more or less self-contained, 
but it Includes the elements of an exchange of com- 
mercial economy, the promise of bigger things to come. 
It Is typical of much of contemporary Africa and also of 
parts of Latin America and Southeast Asia. 
By organizing a system of trade, such socleties take 
the first step leading from the subsistence agriculture 
stage to that of industry. There is, however, no ela- 
borate transformation of materials, no use of complex 
machines and no employment of specialized wage earners 
in a common place of work. Nevertheless, the emergence 
of better transportation and the increasing sale of goods 
open the way to further specialization. 
A: first individuals, then organized groups, 
devote themselves entirely to secondary occu- 
pations away from the land, such as the transformation, 
preparation or carrying of raw materials. This early 
commercial stage with its simple industries grows out 
of the subsistence agriculture phase. Later, and general- 
ly much later, comes the stage of more complex 
manufacturing industry, with the use of machines on an 
ever-increasing scale, an increasing specialization of 
many ‘workers and the creation of more and more elabo- 
rate administrative and financial techniques to keep pace 
with heavier economic demands. 
Industry frst appears with the processing of primary 
products. Grain is milled, leather is tanned, wool or 
vegetable flbres are spun, ores are smelted. These pro- 
cesses obviously call for the next level of Industrial 
development, when materials are transformed and not 
merely processed. The grain so milled is turned into 
bread, the leather into footwear, the cloth into wearing 
apparel, the smelted ores into ploughshares, horseshoes 
and other metal goods. 
At this stage, goods are still produced for immediate 
use by the person who buys them. The major differ- 
ence between this phase and the next, more complex, 
stage of large-scale industry is that capital equipment 
now begins to be produced not to satisfy immediate 
consumer demand, but to help in the future production 
of such goods over a long period of time and with far 
more elaborate marketing facilities in mind. 
Civilizations do not pass through these phases in 
clearly defined historical periods. Human history is an 
untidy phenomenon, It allows for much disorder and for 
the existence side by side of processes of varying age and 
efficiency. The so-called industrial civilization of our 
time is distinguished by a tremendous emphasis on the 
third, or machine-dominated stage. 
The railroad, the steamship, the internal-combustion 
engine, flight, atomic power, electronics, all of them 
Western discoveries or inventions, have vastly broadened 
the horizon of man’s possibilities. Their advantages are 
now becoming available by degree to countries which 
have never experienced the preliminary stages of indus- 
trial progress. 
As a result, our contemporary world presents the pic- 
ture of an economically advanced minority of peoples 
on the one hand and, on the other, a highly diversified 
group of peoples who make up the majority of mankind 
and who, at varying stages of economic underdevelop- 
ment, are seeking to narrow the broad gap which separ- 
ates them from the economic leaders. It may be 
possible perhaps to distinguish various categories among 
these underdeveloped countries and the distinction will 
help to make clearer both their economic problems and 
their potentialities. 
(a) First there are socleties in which there has as yet 
been practically no autonomous economic growth. Most 
of the people wrest a meagre livellhood from the soil as 
subsistence farmers. A very elementary marketing 
system exists, but the exchange of products is on too small 
a scale to allow any real division of labour into different 
skills and crafts, and thus the incentive to progress is 
lacking. 
Great areas of Africa would be typical of this phase of

UNDERDEVELOPMENT (contd) 
The increasing importance 
of government intervention 
economic development, as would a territory like New 
Gulnea, hardly affected as yet by outslde civilization. In 
such reglons, the people themselves lack all the essential 
means to promote their economic growth. They must 
be helped to modify the pattern of subsistence agriculture. 
A more complex exchange system must be introduced. to - 
promote buying and selling and the manufacture or 
preparation of products. 
In these simply constituted economic socleties (personal 
and tribal relationships, like the indigenous languages, 
are often far more complex than any in the “civilized” 
world) this will always require both technical assistance 
and capital from outside to get the static economy moving. 
(b) The second category is more common in the 
contemporary world. Here, we are dealing with under- 
developed countries where forelgn enterprise, capital and 
management, have introduced themselves Info a rela- 
tively simple economic society and have caused a rapid 
evolution In certain sectors. This situation is to be seen 
in a number of ex-colonial countries such as Indonesia 
and Malaya. 
Here, valuable raw materials like rubber and tin have 
been exploited through foreign technical skill and capi- 
tal. As a result, a few highly developed industries have 
been set up to obtaln and export such raw materials. 
The coming of these industries has Introduced, in part 
at least, a commercial economy into the country 
concerned. This has brought with It an elaborate 
exchange mechanism and has provided commercial em- 
ployment for some of the local population. 
M zis the primlitive agricultural economy 
goes on as before over the country as a whole. 
The scale and complexity of local Industries which may 
arise to process raw materials on the spot will vary ac- 
cording to the nature of the product removed and 
exported with foreign help. If this is a mineral, the local 
processing plant is likely to be more complicated than in 
the case of a vegetable product like sisal, for example, 
which Is grown and processed in Tanganyika. Much more 
complex are the copper refineries in Katanga and Nor- 
thern Rhodesia and the oil refineries of the Middle East. 
(c) A third category of countries differs from the rest 
mainly as a result of internal, rather than external, eco- 
nomic factors. How far will domestic demand encourage 
industrial enterprise? We have seen above how the par- 
tial economic development of an underdeveloped country 
may be stimulated by demand from abroad for a parti- 
cular raw material or product. Where this foreign 
demand Is absent, economic growth will occur only when 
a local demand for goods exists. 
This demand, in turn, will depend upon the way iu 
which Income is distributed among the people and the 
tastes of potential customers. If only small numbers of 
the population can afford fo buy consumer gocds, they 
may prefer imported articles. Local manufacturers will 
then recelve little encouragement to enter the fleld and 
there will be as little impulse to extend the industria- 
lization process. A number of Latin American countries 
are in this situation. 
At this point a 'word must be said about the important 
factor of government intervention. Government inter- 
vention has tended to increase markedly in our time. It is 
  
World Bank 
LACK OF TRUCKS in Iran encourages dangerous 
overloading which, in turn, causes road surfaces 
to break up and turn to powder, Iran’s plan of 
economic development now includes the reconstruc- 
tion and widening of existing highways and the 
construction of some 1,500 miles of new highways. 
particularly noticeable in countries which have recently 
gained their political independence and which find them- 
selves faced with the great task of raising the living 
standards of their people with a minimum of delay. 
This task requires some degree of central direction. 
Essential data about natural resuurces, both natural and 
human, have to be centrally collected and assessed. 
Plans must be centrally drawn up for the development of 
these resources, as part of an overall national programme 
of economic and social development. Priorities must be 
centrally established, official encouragement must be given 
to projects and industries which are likely to promote 
the welfare of the people as a whole, and technical assis- 
tance and foreign loans must be applied for through 
recognized government channels. - 
This government intervention ranges from encoura- 
gement and advice, as seen, for example, In community 
development projects sponsored by the authorities in 
India and elsewhere, to actual direction by the state In 
the U.S.S.R., the countries associated with her and in the 
mainland of China. The methods applied to achieve 
economic development will reflect the prevailing ldelology. 
But it should be borne in mind that the conditions favour- 
ing spontaneous economic growth are present only in a 
small measure in the underdeveloped countries and, 
without some degree of government action, no substantial 
progress could be expected In the foreseeable future.

### 63646: Gerhart Hauptmann, dramatist of the oppressed

GERHART HAUPTMANN 
DRAMATIST OF 
THE OPPRESSED 
by Karl Ruhrberg 
 
Gerhart Hauptmann in the grounds of his home at 
Agnetendorf, in the Riesengebirge mountains of Silesia. 
G ERHART IIAUPTMANN, the German poet and 
playwright, was born a hundred years ago, on 
November 15, 1862, at Salzbrunn, in Silesia. Ile died on 
June 6, 1946, at ten minutes past three in the afternoon, 
In his house at Agnetendort (Riesengebirge). The concl- 
latory attitude shown by the occupying troops to the most 
representative dramatist of the defeated country, imme- 
diately after the war—when suspicion, bitterness and 
hatred were the order of the day—bore consoling witness 
to the Indestructible power of the spirit and to the 
strength of the love that breathes through every page 
and line of Hauptmann's work. 
Hauptmann’s writings found a response throughout the 
world, partly because he vigorously championed the rights 
of oppressed peoples. Travelling in Italy at the age of 
twenty. he had been profoundly shocked to discover the 
wretched condition of the poorer classes, particularly in 
Naples. He never forgot his experience, and it was 
reflected In his plays, where he gave expression to his 
sympathy for the poor and for underdogs in general. 
Alfred Kerr, the dramatic critle, who devoted a lifetime 
to commenting on Hauptmann'’s development and ex- 
plaining his Intentions, declared that the basle sentiment 
In hls writings was longing—longing for a better world, 
where all men would be brothers, all class and racial 
prejudices forgotten. 
That Is the Impression left by his descriptions of misery, 
destitution and fear. This was what made him a great 
writer. All aesthetical considerations and discussions as 
to the strictly literary merits of his cnormous output 
(even the first section of which, omitting fragments, 
variants and preliminary drafts fills 17 volumes) are over- 
shadowed by it. 
N March, 1945, Hauptmann, then 82 years, of 
age, returned from Dresden to his house at 
Agnetendorf. His journey coincided with the Allied alr- 
ralds that reduced the former capital of Saxony to a heap 
of rubble, two months before the end of the Second World 
War. The advocate of compassion and love among men, 
the poet who stood for a secularized Christianity, focused 
on the things of this world, was profoundly afflicted by all 
the suffering he had been forced to witness. ‘“‘Anyone 
who had lost the power to weep would recover it amid the 
ruins of Dresden,” he declared, only a few weeks before 
Germany's final defeat. 
He was deeply distressed by the horrors he had seen, but 
his grief was passive and resigned. He made no attempt 
to stir up resistance to the powers of darkness that had 
brought disaster on the world. “I am nearly 83 years 
old”, he sald, “and I come before God with a prayer 
which has no power in it, alas, but it comes from the 
heart—the prayer that God may show greater love to men

GERHART HAUPTMANN (Cont'd) 
Last German 
than hitherto, that he may transform them and enlighten 
them for their own salvation.” 
This submissive attitude was not due merely to 
Hauptmann’s great age, it was part of his nature. He 
was a Socialist, but not a militant one, he believed that 
nothing could change the course of destiny. He was no 
utopian reformer, he had no taste for moralizing or 
polemics. His plays depicted the grim world of the poor, 
the outcast, the oppressed and rejected; but they also 
showed that there could be beauty even in ugliness, nobi- 
lity even in cramped and petty circumstances and that 
even the most despised members of the community had a 
destiny to fulfil. He made no demands, however; his 
attitude was one of hope and—despite his pessimism-—of 
confidence. 
He did not aspire to be a stormer of barricades, and 
this helps to explain his reserved attitude while Hitler 
was In power, for which he was much criticized. In 
spirit he was strongly opposed to National Socialism and 
to the brutality of the dictators who showed him reluctant 
respect because he was a great national figure; and in 
1937 he wrote a requiem entitled “Finsternisse” (Tene- 
brae), based on Tolstoy’s “Power of Darkness”, for his 
Jewish friend Max Pinkus. But he made no open resis- 
tance: he preached love and brotherhood, but not rebel- 
lion. So his international reputation as a committed 
champion of the proletariat is partly due to a misconcep- 
tion. 
This is already made clear in his first play, “Vor 
Sonnenaufgang’” (Before Sunrise), which was produced in 
Berlin in 1889 and caused a scandal by its unvarnished 
portrayal of a family of alcoholics. The original title of 
this play was “Der Siemann” (The Sower), and as the 
word indlcates, the Sower was the forerunner of a new 
world. His name in the play was Loth, and in some res- 
pects he shows a marked resemblance to Hauptmann 
himself. Loth, an enlightened prophet of Socialism, 
irrupts Into the drab world of profiteers, petty tyrants 
and their victims, in 2 mining district in Upper Silesia, 
and falls in love with Helene, a girl who has kept her 
simplicity, freshness and purity, in an environment of 
corruption, drunkenness and immorality. 
HE talk between Helene and Loth is one of the 
most beautiful love scenes in German dramatic 
literature. But Loth is afraid Helene may have inherited 
undesirable qualities from her father, who has become 
a victim of drink, so he leaves her, and she commits 
suicide. This denouement reveals the fundamental weak- 
ness of the central figure and of the play as whole. But 
it also illustrates the untenable philosophical attitude 
of nineteenth-century Europe and its blind faith In 
sclence—in this case taking the form of a conviction 
that the theory of heredity is infallible. 
Hauptmann was a passive observer, not an accuser, 
much less a rebel. In this he differs from the militant 
socialist writers, such as Maxim Gorki and Bertolt Brecht. 
It is understandable that the first collected edition of his 
works should have appeared not in Germany, but in 
Russia, where it was published in 1902-1905. This also 
shows that Hauptmann’s writing’s were in fundamental 
accord with the spiritual situation of his own day, not 
in Germany alone, but throughout the world. 
Gerhart Hauptmann became a legend during his own 
lifetime (he won the Nobel Prize in 1912), largely owing 
to his forceful personality and his physical resemblance 
to Germany’s greatest poet, Geethe. He revelled in the 
role of the last German Prince of Poets, which rather 
paradoxically devolved upon him as the champion of the 
poor In drama; his personality had a powerful streak of 
the actor in it, to which Thomas Mann paid a somewhat 
equivocal literary tribute by portraying him, with a 
mixture of respect and irony, as Mr. Peeperkorn in his 
novel “Der Zauberberg” (The Magic Mountain). 
‘Prince of Poets’ 
Together with Brecht, of whose “epic drama” his “nar- 
rative” plays, with their informal style, were to some 
extent the forerunners, Hauptmann was the most pro- 
lific and important German playwright of the century. 
His success during his own lifetime far exceeded that of 
any other dramatist, even Schiller. For several decades 
he dominated the German stage, and even theatres in 
other countries still keep his work in their repertory. 
His epic writings have attracted comparatively little 
attention, though they include some ambitious efforts 
such as “Bahnwirter Thiedel” (Thiel the Signalman), 
“Der Ketzer von Soana” (The Criminal of Soana), “Der 
Narr in Christo Emanuel Quint” (Christ's Fool, Emma- 
nuel Quint), “Till Eulenspiegel”, “Der grosse Traum” 
(The Great Dream) and above all “Griechischer Friihling” 
(Grecian Spring). There can be no doubt that Gerhart 
Hauptmann reached the loftiest standard of his gene- 
ration; he touched its most responsive chord, and this 
alone would fully justify his fame. 
S ince the war, little has been heard of him, 
either in Germany or abroad. Only a few of 
his plays are still acted, and those not very often, and 
there is practically no discussion of his work in literary 
circles. There are several reasons for this. Hauptmann’s 
plays are not “literature” in the strict sense of the term. 
As a boy he wanted to be a sculptor, and this ambition 
left its mark on his writing. He simply changed from one 
medium to another, using words instead of stone and 
bronze. He wrote in a local idiom (Silesian and Berlin). 
The characters in his plays are shown “in the round”. 
Their facial expressions, movements and gestures, even 
their silences, are as important as the words they utter. 
They stem from the visual imagination of a man who used 
his eyes, who thought In pictures. Hauptmann was not 
a philosophical writer, and he was the very reverse of 
a rationalist. He wrote in a semi-hypnotic state, sunk 
in meditation. 'To borrow a term from modern psycho- 
analysis, “something” ‘wrote inside him, and much of his 
output was enigmatic, sybilline. 
So in his enormous output the sublime is juxtaposed 
with the commonplace, enduring values with topical 
ephemera, realism with romanticism. Not all his writ- 
ings were carried to the ultimate perfection of form, and 
their literary quality 1s very unequal. Incompleteness, 
unfinished sentences, have their own significance, as in 
the conversation of Thomas Mann’s Mr, Peeperkorn, 
whose words take on meaning from his personality and 
whose regal gestures ralse his stammering utterances to 
the unattainable level of impenetrable cosmic mysteries. 
Gone HAUPTMANN'S plays only come to life 
when they are acted, it rests with the audience 
to put the finishing touch to them. The written lines 
are not enough. This Is one reason why the literary 
commentators have hitherto shunned the gigantic figure 
of this last of Silesian mystics. 
There is another reason for their avoidance of him, 
however, the fact that his work has an unusually wide 
stylistic range. It includes all the movements that arose 
during his long life, and there were a great many of 
them. The plays range from naturalism, with its 
attempt to show the world and its inhabitants as they 
really are, to neo-romanticism, which won its greatest but 
briefest theatrical triumph in “Die Versunkene Glocke” 
(The Sunken Bell); from social dramas such as “Die 
Weber” (The Weavers), which deals with the abortive 
uprising of the Silesian weavers in the 1840’s—doomed 
to end in resigned surrender—to the four Atrides plays, 
with their sombre retelling of an ancient tale of doom, 
which make up a belated testament, influenced by the 
inhumanity of his own day.

© Flammarion, Paris 
GERHART HAUPTMANN. HE WAS BORN ON NOVEMBER 15, 1862 AND DIED ON JUNE 8, 1948, 
Interspersed with these are pieces like “Der Biberpelz” 
(The Beaver Coat), a delightful comedy about a theft in 
Berlin; the moving legend of “Hanneles Himmelfahrt” 
(Hannele Ascends to Heaven), in which an unreal dream- 
world breaks into a poverty-stricken environment; the 
tragedy of “Florian Geyer”, the chivalrous peasant 
leader, which “penetrated to the very heart of German 
discord”; the tragedy of the artist, “Michael Kramer”: 
“Dle Ratten” (The Rats), a poignant tragicomedy whose 
characters are broken-down artists, proletarians and anti- 
social elements, and which is perhaps Hauptmann’s best 
play; “Rose Bernd”, a tragedy of infanticide, based on the 
period of German genius; an original version of the 
Hamlet story called “Hamlet In Wittenberg”, which vied 
with Shakespeare and caused much controversy; and 
many other works. 
Hauptmann’s most poetical play is a falry-tale, “Und 
Pippa Tanzt” (And Pippa Dances), set amid a community 
of glass-blowers and in which the eternal powers—Eros, 
the spirit, and youth—find poetic embodiment in the cha- 
racters of the girl Pippa, the malevolent glasshlower 
Huhn, Wann, the gentle sage who is an earthly Incar- 
nation of God, and the travelling journeyman, Michel 
Hellriegal. 
Thus, in nearly all Hauptmann's plays, the plot centres 
on love. It may be humlliated, scorned and wounded, 
but it cannot be destroyed. Hauptmann knows that 
people do not love one another enough. “Nobody has had 
enough love”, moans Rose Bernd, driven to crime and 
disaster by other people's cowardice and selfishness; and 
August Kell, once her betrothed, speaking “solemnly, 
from the depth” utters the closing words of the tragedy: 
“Poor girl—what she must have suffered!”

AMATEUR ARCHZEOLOGIST (Cont'd) 
From teen-agers 
to septuagenarians 
but one expression of the trend which led in turn to the 
establishment of museums maintained at public expense. 
The rapid growth of museum collections, with their 
assembled wealth of artifacts, made possible the applica- 
tion of methods used in related branches of the natural 
sciences and produced the typologies and chronological 
framework upon which much of British prehistory has 
been built up. The credit for this research rests largely 
with the amateur and the museum archaeologist. 
There were in fact few professionals in other flelds of 
archeology until the close of the century, when the 
State, lagging somewhat behind public opinion, accepted 
a limited responsibility for the preservation of ancient 
monuments and a nucleus of Civil Service archaeologists 
was formed in 1882 with General Pitt-Rivers as the first 
Inspector of Ancient Monuments of the Ministry of 
Works. 
The establishment of the Royal Commissions to survey 
and record historical monuments followed in 1908 and 
provided further openings for the professional. 
Te gulf between the amateur and the profes- 
sional archeologist was already becoming 
apparent as the pace of specialization quickened in the 
1930's. World War II completed the process. The 
leisured classes, who were once the mainstay of the 
archaeological societies, found they had neither the time 
to keep abreast of current thought nor the resources to 
devote to archeology. The societies in turn were faced 
with serious financial problems: navvy labour for 
excavation was often beyond their means and increased 
printing charges made it difficult to maintain the high 
standard of publication which had prevailed before the 
war. 
At the same time there was more urgent need than ever 
before for extensive fieldwork. Agricultural and urban 
development, were threatening field monuments with 
destruction in all parts of the country and the commercial 
exploitation of the river gravels and ironstone was 
devouring the archseology of whole regions at a rate 
which made recording and examination well nigh 
impossible for the small body of professional archsolo- 
gists to tackle single-handed, especially as many of them 
had heavy teaching and other commitments. The State 
has, as a result, assumed a greater responsibility for 
large-scale excavation but much still remains for the 
societies to do. It is here that the amateur can help, 
provided he is prepared to acquire the requisite skill in 
field techniques. 
It is hard to generalize about present-day amateurs. 
Their age may range from 16 to 70 and their background 
is as varied. The retired colonel, the doctors of divinity 
or medicine, town councillors and engineers, biochemists 
and school-teachers, housewives, students and school- 
children can all be found working side by side upon an 
excavation. Some may he members of an archaeological 
society; others may be students attending an adult edu- 
cation course. A few may have no clear idea what led 
them to spend their spare time toiling in a trench apart 
from the general fascination which archaeology now 
appears to hold for many people. 
The present popularity of the subject undoubtedly 
owes much to television. Broadcast series such as The 
Archeeologist, introduced In 1946, have also had an effect 
as the sale of 55,000 copies of a British Broadcasting Cor-

poration pamphlet on Roman Britain proves. Excavations 
provide an even greater attraction. 
The discovery of a Roman temple in London drew a 
patient queue of 30,000 visitors and 60,000 persons found 
their way through the suburbs to watch the foundations 
of Nonsuch Palace being uncovered in the space of less 
than two months recently. Archeology is news to the 
daily press and popular magazines which turn unprompt- 
ed each spring to inquire about forthcoming excavations 
from the Council for British Archeology. 
The Council was formed in 1944 to promote and co-or- 
dinate archaeology in the British Isles. It received State 
recognition five years later in the shape of a small annual 
subsidy. The Council was alive to the dangers of popu- 
larizing archeeology and realized that an outlet should be 
provided for the growing public interest in fieldwork. 
The obvious remedy was to organize training-schools for 
the serious amateur and to put those who simply wanted 
an archezeological holiday in touch with the director of 
an excavation where their help would be welcomed. 
The latter was easy enough to arrange. A brief quest- 
ionnaire to professional archaeologists likely to be 
digging usually produces requests for helpers on between 
70-80 sites during the season. Last year such sites in- 
cluded Bronze Age barrows within sight of Stonehenge, 
Iron Age farmsteads and hillforts, and many Roman sites 
—towns, temples, villas and forts in all parts of the 
country. A small expedition went to Orkney and adjacent 
islands to search for evidence of Scandinavian settlement 
in the form of pagan burial-mounds. Work will continue 
in the medieval towns of Winchester and Southampton, 
on castles, priories, manors and on the site of long 
deserted villages. Town, country or even uninhabited 
island, there is something for all tastes. 
Details of these sites are circulated to prospective 
volunteers in the form of a Calendar of Excavations, 
issued monthly from March until the end of the digging 
season In September for an annual fee of 5s. The volun- 
teer selects whichever site appeals to him and writes to 
the director to ask.i he may help. When the Calendar 
first appeared in 1950 it had a modest circulation of

AMATEUR ARCHZEOLOGIST (Cont'd) 
Women ideal for uncovering skeletons 
67 coples. Within a matter of months it had Increased 
threefold, and subscribers now total over a thousand and 
include students in America and on the Continent. 
The success of the Calendar lles largely in the fact that 
it meets the needs of both excavators and volunteers with 
a minimum of correspondence or formality. The archeo- 
logist can appeal for helpers of all kinds: trained super- 
visors, photographers, surveyors, a soil sclentist or even a 
cook-caterer ,and his chances of finding them are good. 
The volunteer, on the other hand, is told as much as 
possible about the site; its nature, period and location. 
In particular, he is warned of projects which are only 
suitable for those with previous field experience and his 
attention 1s drawn to sites where beginners would be 
given elementary training. Women as well as men are 
welcomed on most sites, particularly where a delicate 
touch is needed in uncovering skeletons. And no distinc- 
tion is made unless primitive living conditions in some 
isolated spot demand if. 
When the site lies near a village, the volunteer is 
usually expected to find his own accommodation. In the 
case of a popular holiday resort, difficulties may arise but 
the organizer of the dig will usually provide a list of likely 
lodgings or may even arrange a camp. 
The degree of organization on these sites varies greatly. 
A primary qualification of any excavation is that it 
should be disciplined. The director must have some assur- 
ance that his helpers will spend at least a week with him 
if not longer, and that they will arrive on time each day. 
Where the temptation of sand and surf is likely to prove 
too strong, some directors, wisely recognizing the frailty 
of their helpers, adjust their hours of work to allow for 
a swim In the middle of the. day. Nor are such amenities 
as the local pub equipped with darts-board overlooked. 
Once on the site, the volunteer will be shown how to dig 
and use a trowel, and the necessity for removing the soil 
layer by layer will be explained to him. He will also be 
told about the purpose and general progress of the work 
so that he may understand developments beyond the 
limits of his own trench. He—or she—will be expected to 
share heavy manual jobs and on the larger excavations 
may even have to take a furn as guide-lecturer in show- 
Ing visitors round the site.. 
M = amateurs return each season to the same 
site acquiring confidence from their familiarity 
with the stratigraphy. It is, however, difficult to gain a 
thorough grounding in all aspects of fieldwork on an 
ordinary excavation. The archaeological problems of the 
site must take precedence over training and all too often 
the director may be working against time. 
Volunteers with long-term aspirations In archaeology 
usually prefer to attend a training-school, returning in 
successive seasons until they have acquired the back- 
ground and technical knowledge needed to work on their 
own. The majority of amateurs can devote their energies 
to only such limited objectives as the rescue-excavation of 
sites threatened with destruction. Even so, they need an 
understanding of the basic principles of excavation and 
their practical application in recording stratification, the 
registration of associated objects and field survey. 
The past decade has seen a notable increase in the pro- 
vision of such training facilities. In Scotland a Field 
School of Archaeology was established in 1947 under the 
auspices of four Scottish universities and the C.B.A. region- 
al group. Its purpose was to build up a cadre of trained 
field workers to tackle emergency excavation when 
needed. Ten years later, of the 171 students who had 
received training, seven had become professional archeaeo- 
logists or museum officials. Eight had conducted excava- 
tlons on thelr own account and 32 had acted as assistants 
on sites in Scotland and elsewhere. 
The students were drawn from a wide range of occupa- 
tions which included the professions, the Forces, the Civil 
Service, journallsm, broadcasting, science and industry. 
Thirty-seven were teachers and it is interesting to note 
that the majority used archzology to a greater or 
lesser degree in their work, 
Similar groups of trained field workers are being built 
up in other regions. The University of Durham has for 
a number of years used the site of Corstopitum (Cor- 
bridge) on Hadrian’s Wall as a training-school for stu- 
dents and amateurs. The University of London is asso- 
clated with Verulamium (St. Albans). In the east Mid- 
lands, the University of Nottingham’s Department of 
Adult Education has held eight successive summer schools 
on the Romano-British town and neighbouring villa site 
of Great Casterton, Rutland. 
E xperience on these sites has shown that 
ideally the training-school should be envisaged 
as an Integral part of a more prolonged theoretical course 
which could best be provided by means of university 
extension or adult education lectures during the winter 
months. Now, thanks to public demand, tutorial courses 
can be followed in many parts of the country. 
Extensive as are the facilities provided on the training- 
schools, it sometimes happens that they do not meet the 
requirements of the active but inexperienced members of 
a local soclety who may wish to work on a site in their 
own locality. If there Is no archeologist of suitable expe- 
rience among their ranks, such a project can best be pur- 
sued by inviting a qualified archaeologist to advise and 
direct their activities. Unless he is a person with both 
means and leisure, his visits are likely to be restricted to 
a minimum, especially if the local society is unable to 
meet his travelling expenses. 
The Carnegie Trust has recently provided a solution to 
this problem by making grants to meet the fees and 
expenses of qualified archeologists willing to direct 
projects undertaken by societies and recommended by the 
CB.A. The Trust will also provide funds for the 
purchase of tools and expensive items of equipment, 
which reverts to the C.B.A. when the society no longer 
needs them. 
Since the project was initiated in 1958, it has been 
possible to train over 200 members of some 28 archzo- 
logical societies. Excavation was entailed in the majority 
of cases, but several societies have embarked on long- 
term field surveys. ‘These included surveys of early 
settlements in Northumberland and Devon, the tracing of 
Roman roads in Flintshire, and the recording of early 
domestic architecture in several regions. 
The provision of so wide a range of training facilities 
for the amateur as distinct from the student who intends 
to make archzeology his profession has been one of the 
most interesting developments of the postwar period. 
Its full effects cannot yet be gauged and much will depend 
upon the ability of the local societies to move with the 
times and provide for more active participation in field- 
-work than has hitherto been customary. Herein lies their 
best chance of survival. There is much work to be done 
both in field survey and by excavation in all parts of the 
country and it is through his local archaeological society 
that the amateur can most usefully contribute to research.

O: December 31, 1959, an old man of 77 died 
peacefully in Kyoto, the ancient capital of 
Japan. With hls death, a famlllar figure disappeared 
from the city’s streets. For some fifty years, passers-by 
had been accustomed to see Jodo Kumami riding around 
in his tricycle wheelchair pulled by two dogs, a con- 
spicuous sight with his long hair and moustache which 
made ‘him look somewhat like a Chinese physician or 
a fortune-teller. 
Jodo Kumami was a story-teller and a friend of chil- 
dren for whom he organized many activities at a time 
when few people thought of providing playgrounds or 
arranging excursions for youngsters in the city. He was 
born in 1882, son of a poor famlly in Osaka, and after his 
parents’ death, was brought up by his brother In Ako, a 
town famous In Japanese feudal history. Burns on his

obliged him to develop other talents. 
His first ambition was to become an artist. Ie went 
to Kyoto to study under a master and, while he earned 
a meagre llving by drawing designs for kimonos, he began 
to make up falry tales to entertain his nelghbours’ 
children. As they told thelr friends about his stories, 
more and more children flocked to him. Finally, his 
small room would not hold them and he had to hire 
a large public meeting hall. 
About this time, he organized the Kyoto Fairy Tale Club 
which held regular meetings for boys and girls and pub- 
lished a monthly magazine In which his stories appeared.

### 63654: Jodo Kumami; king of story-tellers for Kyoto's children

JODO KUMAMI (Cont'd) 
The magic of ‘once upon a time’ 
venting stories for them; he also arranged baseball teams 
and excursions and organized summer camps. 
By now, he was well-known as a story-teller and a 
familiar figure in Kyoto. Children loved him, and called 
him “Sensei” (master). They used to push his wheel- 
chalr for him and in exchange he gave them drawings 
{llustrating scenes from his stories. 
To commemorate the tenth anniversary of the Kyoto 
Fairy Tale Club, Kumami organized Kyoto’s first story 
competition for schoolchildren in the Town Hall In 1920. 
More than ten schools took part in the competition, which 
was sponsored by a leading Japanese newspaper. On an- 
other occasion, the Club launched a fund-ralsing cam- 
palgn for Lieutenant Shirase’s Antarctic expedition, an 
event which opened up vistas of a new world in the 
children’s Imagination. When Britaln’s Prince of Wales 
visited Kyoto in April 1922, the Club gave him a set of 
dolls made by master dollmakers of Kyoto to illustrate 
the famous falry tale of the Tongue-Cut Sparrow. 
‘When It came to money, Jodo Kumami, like many 
artists, was impractical. From time to time, financial dif- 
ficulties forced him to close the Club. One evening, when 
he had been evicted for not paying his rent, an elght- 
year-old girl who had listened to his stories found him In 
the street and brought him home. Her parents, who owned 
  
a hotel, approved thelr daughter's generosity and allowed 
him to stay for a year. 
Kumami wrote many tales, but lack of money prevented 
him from collecting them in book form, and in the course 
of time, the manuscripts were scattered and lost. Usually, 
the storles began with. “Once upon a time.” They 
had simple, dramatic themes, and the chlef characters 
were ants, butterflies, dragonflies, rats, mice, rabbits and 
goldfish. 
Public recognition of Jodo Kumami’s activities for 
children only came a few years ago, and by then hls 
name meant little to the rising generation of Japanese 
youth who prefer radio, television and cinema to story- 
telling. In 1953, the old man who had glven joy to 
hundreds of youngsters, was presented with a motor- 
driven wheelchair by the Mayor of Kyoto. But even this 
brought him no luck. He soon crashed it Into a streetcar, 
and was seriously Injured. He was not at home in the 
world of modern machines any more than he ‘was in 
the world of modern entertainment. When he got well 
after his accldent, he again went back to using his old, 
trustworthy, dog-powered tricycle-chair. 
When he fell ill in 1959, one of his friends asked a 
nearby primary school to send some schoolchildren to 
visit him. The request was granted, and a group of boys 
and girls brought musical Instruments to console the for- 
gotten storyteller with a concert. It was only a half- 
hour visit, but Kumam! was excited to tears, and re- 
marked that he was so happy that now he was ready 
to dle. 
In Kyoto there are still many grown-up people who 
  
cherish a childhood memory of Kumami Sensei. But out- 
side of Kyoto, and among young people and children even 
there, he is almost unknown. One Japanese ‘writer of 
children’s books calls his work old-fashioned. Neverthe- 
less his tales are deeply implanted in the minds of hun- 
dreds of people—doctors, university professors, bankers, 
merchants, housewives—who listened to Jodo Kumaml 
when they were small. 
Because he became an almost legendary figure in the 
lives of people familiar with his stories, he has been 
compared to Hans Christian Andersen. The two had 
much In common: both came from poor families and 
spent a poverty-stricken childhood, and both became 
story-tellers. But there are differences. Andersen had 
opportunities to attend school, while Kumami had none. 
Andersen had the advantage of travelling all over Europe 
—to Rome and to London—but Kumami was a cripple and 
never went beyond the city of Kyoto. Andersen met 
Charles Dickens, and was helped by King Frederick VI 
of Denmark, but Kumami had no such distinguished 
friends. And, unlike Andersen, Kumamli had no opportu- 
nity to publish his fairy tales. Recently, however, efforts 
have been made to bring him recognition. Fairy tales 
never really die; and for young children, the world around 
there is still magic in the words: “Once upon a time...”

WHY NOT COMPROMISE? 
Sir, 
Although I have been a subscriber 
to THE Unesco COURIER since the 
May, 1956 issue, this is my first 
correspondance. Despite my unfor- 
givable incommunicativeness, the fact 
that I have continued my subscription 
since 1956 should indicate my saltis- 
faction; but the fact that I write now 
is to indicate a dissatisfaction and 
offer a placative suggestion. My dissa- 
tisfaction lies with your “new editorial 
policy of publishing a greater variety 
of articles” instead of devoting 
“whole issues” to one theme (April, 
1962); my suggestion is a compromise: 
devote some issues to the one-theme 
approach, and some to the multi- 
theme approach. Some themes, such 
as conservation, ethnology, the sea, 
are in themselves so pregnant with 
diverse matter that UNeEsco could only 
perform an abortive service by editing 
only one or two articles per theme; on 
the other hand, there are a number of 
other subjects that are relatively 
confined in scope so as not to require 
extenuated treatment. Exactly what 
subjects should be thrown in your 
diversity pot to make a rich stew for 
your diversity readers I leave to you; 
but please! do not fall into that either- 
or fallacy. Your Unesco fare is 
broad enough to make a variety of 
editorial approaches, not just the one 
approach of squeezing “variety” in 
every issue.

TRAFFIC LIGHTS THAT ‘THINK’ 
 
Sir, 
1 have viewed with interest your 
“From the Unesco Newsroom’, for 
several years now, and have found 
it one of the high points of each 
issue. I wish to point out however 
that in it (March 1962), I saw to my 
astonishment that there appeared an 
article on the “new” idea of mechanic- 
ally controlled “thinking” traffic 
lights in Leningrad. Living in one of 
the worst cities—as far as traffic 
problems go—in the world, we have 
been forced to try everything, and 
have had in operation for many years, 
a great number of these “Thinking” 
traffic lights. They are now so 
commonplace here, that nearly every 
major street has them sprinkled at 
crowded intersections.

LIFE-SAYING BLOOD 
 
Sir, 
In your interesting magazine-—and 
particularly in the May, 1962 issue 
(Two Faces of World Health)—you 
frequently refer to causes of death in 
the economically-developed countries: 
road accidents (subject of a special 
Letters to the Editor 
issue last year), accidents at work and 
cardiovascular diseases which in 
Europe and North America have 
become “killers of modern times". 
I think you would be in line with the 
aims of UNEsco if you reminded your 
readers of the role nowadays played by 
blood. It is needed for daring heart 
operations, used in the treatment of 
scverely-burned pcople and also in 
the case of “blood poisoning’ which 
sometimes occurs in young babies 
because their parents have opposing 
rhesus factors in their blood. Every- 
one should know to which blood group 
he belongs and many more pcople 
should offer to donate a little of their 
blood once or twice each year. If this 
was done, we should certainly be bet- 
ter protected against the afflictions of 
prosperity.

At the request of many Embassy

in this way of using Lilliputian

I should like to receive from Madame

I would like to add that thanks to the

SEEKING THE CAUSES OF WAR 
 
Sir, 
Has Unrsco ever sponsored a 
study of history, by scholars of all na- 
tions, with the object of discovering 
the causes of war and the conditions 
recessary for peace? Liven if nothing 
new is discovered, the published 
findings of such research should 
cmphasize, for world leaders and 
people alike, the need 10 build peace 
upon a firm foundation, 
Similarly a Untcsco publication of 
the lives of those who have devoted 
themselves to the pursuit of peace, 
could be of value. Provided the lives 
of these people carried the same ele- 
ments of courage and adventure as 
the heroes of war, they could prove 
o great inspiration to all. 
Peter A. Walker

Ed. Note: 
Unesco's studies relating indi- 
rcetly to the causes of war and 
the promotion of peace begin in 1947 
with studies of international tensions, 
many of which have been published. 
These include “Tensions that Cause 
War”, “How Nations See Eadh 
Other”, “Ways of Life” studies, 
covering Australia, Norway, Swit- 
zerland, and South Africa, and studies 
dealing with the question of racial and 
chnic minorities (The Race Question 
in Modern Science), Since 1956 
emphasis has been placed on studies 
of the positive aspects of improving 
international relations rather than 
conducting research into the negative 
aspects of such relations which tend to 
being about war, Study projects have 
included: social aspects of economic 
development (urbanization,  conse- 
quences of technological change), 
Himan Rights (race questions, chang- 
irg situation of women) and, more 
particularly, questions of peaceful co- 
operation and international under-

carried out by Unesco for the U.N, 
Commission on the Status of Women 
regarding opportunities for girls in ele- 
mentary education in 82 countries and 
territories has revealed a spectacular rise 
in the number of girls attending school. 
But schooling for girls is still a serious 
problem in many countries, and the U.N. 
Commision has urged the U.N. Economic 
and Social Council to recommend to all 
U.N. member states to provide equal 
educational rights and facilities for boys 
and girls alike. 
AST YOUR TREE... The cherry trees 
which bring thousands of visitors to 
Washington, the U. S. capital, each spring 
were a gift from the people of Tokyo 
fifty years ago. The parent trees in Tokyo, 
however, disappeared through blight and 
damage after World War II. Now, thanks 
to a gift of 40 grafts from the trees in 
Washington, young cherry trees have again 
bloomed on the Arakawa Embankment in 
Tokyo from which Washington received the 
original gift. 
N EKONG FLOOD STUDIES: Thanks 
to assistance from the U.N. Special 
Fund, a special study for the eventual 
  
construction of a flood control dam on the 
Mekong River Delta will be carried out 
by .Unesco. The study will reveal the 
effect the dam would have on flood control, 
sylviculture, fisheries, navigation and power 
production in Cambodia and Vietnam. 
RANZ HALS IN HAARLEM: The 
100th anniversary of the creation of 
the Franz Hals Museum in the city of 
Haarlem, The Netherlands, has been cele- 
brated by a large-scale exhibition of the 
Dutch master’s works—many loaned by 
museums and galleries in other countries 
—which ends on September 30. 
NTERNATIONAL POSTER CON- 
“M. TEST: An international jury has now 
awarded prizes in the UNESCO Poster Contest 
on international understanding and co- 
operation, for which a total of 124 designs 
were submitted through the intermediary of 
Unesco National Commissions. As no 
design fulfilled all the requirements for the 
award of a first prize, the jury awarded two 
second prizes of $500 each to Mr. Morteza 
Tabrizian of Iran and Mr. Stanlislan 
Zagorski of Poland. The third prize of 
$300 was won by Mr Pau Macia i Pons 
of Spain.

ANGERS OF RADIATION: The 
increasing number of radioactive 
products now being used constitute a 
growing health problem and call for the 
organization of radiation protection 
services, the training of personnel and 
promotion of research. These problems 
were reviewed at a recent conference 
sponsored by the World Health Organiza- 
tion in Diisseldorf, which considered 
aspects ranging from existing laws and 
regulations and control measures to the 
supervision of contamination in man's 
patural surroundings—in air, water, soil 
and food.

Universal Copyright Convention, under 
which 42 countries have now agreed to 
grant foreign works the same protection 
accorded works by their own nationals. 
iM A sea as big as the Sea of Azov (14,500 
square miles in area) has been discovered 
deep underground between the Dnieper and 
Molochnaya Rivers in the Ukraine, 
MW The World Health Organization reports 
that of 1,420 million people exposed to 
malaria before 1955, 317 million (22%) 
now live in areas where malaria has been 
eradicated. Eradication programmes are in 
progress in areas with 710 million in- 
habitants.

HW High peaks between McMurdo Sound 
and Beardmore Glacier in Antarctica have 
been mapped by helicopter. Radio signals 
between a surveyor landed by helicopter 
on mountain peaks and “master units” 20 
miles away enabled distances between the 
two points to be calculated with a margin 
of error of about six inches.

UNESCO ART SLIDES 
A collection of colour transparencies to make known to the public masterpieces of world art which, 
in spite of their importance for the history of art and for the understanding of the genius of the nation 
which created them, are all too often unknown. Most of the slides are based on the Unesco World 
Art Series Albums, with which readers of The Unesco Courier are already familiar. The slides, 
produced for Unesco by Publications Filmées d'Art et d'Histoire in Paris, are of top quality and rea- 
sonably priced. They are presented in a plastic case for ready projection, each series containing thirty 
transparencies, in mounts 5 X 5 cm, and an explanatory booklet with text and titles in French, English 
and Spanish. The very high standard of colour reproduction makes these slides valuable not only 
to teachers and lecturers but also to art lovers everywhere.
