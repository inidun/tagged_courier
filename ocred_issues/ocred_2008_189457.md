RACISM IS A MUTANT 
Xenophobia and racism are intellectual constructs that have taken root 
in the human mind over the centuries. Legal measures are proving 
inadequate, as they only touch the visible tip of the iceberg. An intellectual 
strategy is needed, in order to reach into the historical and cultural depths 
of these plagues, and to eliminate them from the minds of humans. 9

LUC MONTAGNIER: BUILDING UP IMMUNITIES 
For the past ten years, Luc Montagnier, winner of the 2008 Nobel 
Prize for Medicine, has been insisting that efforts to stem the AIDS 
epidemic must involve a combination of prevention and a therapeutic 
vaccine. At first, his call for a vaccine fell on deaf ears. But, today, he 
has high hopes that soon a therapeutic vaccine will enable a body 
infected with HIV to build its own defences. 19

HUMAN DIGNITY IN QUESTION 
Scientific progress can sometimes catch ethicists unawares. 
This was the case with the cloning of Dolly the sheep in 1997 
and, today, with cybrids and nanotechnologies. The philosopher 
and anthropologist Georges Kutukdjian, author of the article 
“UNESCO and Bioethics”, published in our magazine in 1994, 
takes a look at the latest challenges for bioethics. 19

WANGARI MAATHAI: 
HOPES AND DISAPPOINTMENTS 
Proud of Africa’s progress yet sceptical about governments, 
Wangari Maathai from Kenya, 2004 Nobel Peace Prize winner, 
believes that African leaders are largely responsible for the ills that 
plague the continent. Instead of complaining, they should better 
control the exploitation of African resources and populations. 24

Both people and wildlife are struggling to survive as natural 
resources dwindle, and little time remains for the island

LL 
Martti Ahtisaari at UNESCO, 2 October 2008. 
  
Which of your negotiating 
experiences as a peace 
negotiator have been most 
satisfying and which have 
been most challenging 
and frustrating? 
| am not easily frustrated, other- 
wise | wouldn't be in this exercise at

far too long: | became UN Special 
Representative in 1977 and it last- 
ed until 1989 when we were able 
to get our operations started. There 
were moments when | considered 
leaving, but | was very glad that | 
stuck with it because it was satisfy- 
ing in the end. 
Maybe Namibia is one exception, 
maybe because Finland has a spe- 
cial bond with Namibia due to Finn- 
ish missionaries who worked there 
for a hundred years. That was very 
useful as the churches of Namibia 
played an important role in the 
peace process. Also, on a personal

Looking at the bigger picture, 
do you see world peace 
as progressing or regressing? 
The number of conflicts is dimin- 
ishing but we have too many fro- 
zen conflicts, the most important 
of which is the Middle East. It really 
needs to be solved and everybody 
knows on which basis it has to be 
solved. This conflict spoils the inter- 
national atmosphere and as long as 
it is not solved we will not be able to 
solve the conflicts in Afghanistan, 
Irak and Iran. 
Has the United Nations been 
successful in serving 
the interests of peace? 
Yes it has. We have had much time 
to improve preparations for the me- 
diation and negotiation of conflicts 
and many of the peace keeping 
operations also facilitate our work. 
The U.N. is improving its capacity 
through the establishment of new 
units and different funding mecha- 
 Namibian chidren. Nambiawas one 
of Martti Ahtisaan’s toughest and most satisfying 
assignments. 
3 
nisms for conflict resolution. 
Nevertheless, in every speech | 
make, | denounce the attitude that 
people take as if it were normal that 
conflicts become frozen. | think that 
we have to demand that the coun- 
tries that have major influence in 
any given conflict and whose coop- 
eration is vital are prepared to use 
this influence and lean on the coun- 
tries concerned to solve these [fro- 
zen] conflicts. | cannot accept that 
nothing is done to convince these 
countries to use their influence. 
We have to show we are serious 
about human rights. Human rights 
are undermined one way or another 
in every single conflict, and the U.N. 
must be seen to take human rights 
seriously. 
In general, | would say that above 
human rights, we have to advance 
rule of law in the world in general. 
in the absence of rule of law there 
can be no respect for human rights. 
What about UNESCO’s 
mandate to create solidarity 
among peoples in in its fields 
of competence? Has it made 
a difference in terms 
of building peace in the minds 
of men, to use the phrase 
of UNESCO’s constitution? 
| got involved with UNESCO when 
| worked with liberation movements 
especially SWAPO (South-West 
African People's Organisation, Na- 
mibia) and the education resources 
that UNESCO provided were ex- 
tremely useful. 
| don't think that the work of orga- 
nizations like UNESCO can ever 
be finished. | hope that this work is 
maintained. 
| also hope that organisations like 
UNESCO can help countries emer- 
ging from conflicts to look at the 
past. The only country that has done 
so in Europe is Germany. Nobody 
else has and we can see that some 
of the problems that are plaguing 
us in Europe are directly due to the 
fact that we haven't examined our 
past properly.

### 189813: The Challenge of peace

THE CHALLENGE 
OF PEACE 
Ev in June 1967, as 
participants in an international meeting 
of journalists held in Strasbourg, we 
tried to forget the outside world and 
spent an agreeable week discussing 
the recent progress of technology and 
its growing impact on the press. 
in our small way, we tried to make 
a contribution to that increasingly 
popular exercise which has been

and discussions of world affairs and on

termed “Futurology” and which some- 
times skims fairly close to Science 
Fiction. We tried to visualize the 
world of tomorrow and more espe- 
cially what a “Golden Age” of journal- 
ism might be like tomorrow. We saw 
artificial satellites whirling through 
space, transmitting facsimile news- 
papers to every corner of the globe. 
Any family could select. any of the 
world’s newspapers at the touch of a 
button, and some of them were even 
“talking newspapers” which added a 
more personal touch. Stories by 
news reporters on the spot were sent 
directly to automatically operated 
composing machines, while front page 
dispatches were flashed instantan- 
eously via laser beams.

Our tiny international group, made 
up of journalists from France, UK, 
U.S.S.R., US.A, the Arab countries, 
Japan, Yugoslavia, Ireland, Czecho- 
slovakia and other countries, even 
went so far as to work out how long 
it would take for such innovations to 
be introduced, whether in the next 
twenty, fifty or a hundred years. 
By tacit agreement we omitted any 
mention of politics despite the fact that 
a war had broken out in the Middle 
East that very week and no one could 
then predict whether it would be 
possible to circumscribe the conflict 
that had erupted or whether it would 
eventually spread to other countries.

of the communications industry were

more than a tractor and

based on what seemed a natural 
assumption that the world would 
develop peacefully in the foreseeable 
future. 
Clearly no one—except a compara- 
tively small group of professional 
military men—can think of drawing up 
vast plans for the future with the 
perspective of a world war in front of 
him. The architect breaking ground 
for a new skyscraper, the gardener 
landscaping a new park, the artist 
starting on a new painting, all think 
ahead to the future enjoyment and 
benefit of their work to society for 
years and even generations to come. 
To put it another way, the need for 
peace is as natural to man as his need

instinct of man—the instinct to stay 
alive. 
A Swiss scientist, lean-lacques 
Babel, has recently calculated that in 
the course of history man has waged 
14,500 major and minor wars, and the 
French sociologist, Gaston Bouthoul, 
is the author of a study entitled 8,000 
Traités de Paix (8,000 peace treaties). 
Someone has worked out that man's 
“Golden Age"—when peace has 
reigned throughout the world—has 
been of surprisingly short duration, 
hardly more than a total of 220 years!

and reflect on this a moment, and ask 
ourselves how much those 14,500 wars

tion. 
People may differ widely in their 
opinions about Karl Marx's philosophy 
but no one, | believe, could argue with 
the following statement he made about 
war : “From a purely economic point 
of view, it is tantamount to a nation 
throwing a portion of its capital into 
the sea.” 
In the course of the Second World 
War, 60 per cent of the national rev- 
enue of the belligerent countries was 
drained away and lost forever. [n 
addition, this terrible holocaust claimed 
the lives of 50 million persons who 
died in a sea, not of water, but of 
blood.

THE CHALLENGE OF PEACE (Continued) 
The rocky road 
to international agreements 
It would hardly seem necessary 
today to describe once again the 
horrible consequences of a new world 
war, a war fought with nuclear wea- 
pons. The destruction involved 
would go far beyond what any of us 
could possibly imagine. The world's 
press has on various occasions guoted 
a figure which is in no sense an 
exaggeration : the death of 700 to 800 
million people as a result of the first 
nuclear attack. 
0 eany therefore, neither 
common sense nor the spirit of huma- 
nity give mankind any other choice 
today than the establishment of a last- 
ing peace. Yet it is a secret to no one 
that we live in a world of unstable, 
uneasy peace. - Time and again we have 
seen the flames of war erupt in Korea, 
Algeria, Suez, Vietnam and the Middle 
East... As dangerous for peace today 
is the present tendency of the majority 
of nations to stockpile armaments. 
Professor George Schwartzenberger, 
of London University, was certainly 
right when he said that present-day 
relations between nations are permeat- 
ed with mutual distrust and constant 
fear of other nations’ intentions. 
It would therefore appear quite 
logical that nations seek to perfect the 
means for their own defence. But 
there does not seem to be any formula 
for doing away with the “world in arms” 
and the suspicions which derive from 
it, other than the elimination of the 
material basis of this fear and distrust, 
that is, the armaments themselves. 
It is only since the end of the 18th 
Century and in the brief interludes 
between wars in our own time that 
world political thought has been led to 
consider seriously the theory of gene- 
ral disarmament. in the past, disar- 
mament was applied to a country after 
it met defeat; it had to surrender its 
arms, its fortifications were destroyed 
and other measures of a similar nature 
were taken. Bitter experience kas 
taught us that far from preventing new 
wars and conquests this increased the 
danger of war. 
That is why, during the Second 
World War with its untold destruction 
and millions of victims, people every- 
where were made acutely aware of the 
urgency of establishing a tasting peace 
based on the one means of definitely 
guaranteeing it, namely, disarmament. 
The UNESCO Courier 2008 N°10 
ended, Moscow, London, Washington 
and Paris were already seeking ways 
to build the peace of the future. 
In October 1943 a meeting of the 
Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the 
Four Allied Powers was held in 
Moscow. In the declaration they 
jointly signed it was emphasized that 
the problem of disarmament should be 
resolved in the same spirit of unity 
which had been displayed by the 
Great Powers of the Anti-Nazi coali- 
tion. 
The approach to the problem of 
disarmament at that time was perhaps 
somewhat naive : the soldiers would 
return home after victory and would 
abandon their rifles and uniforms 
forever; at the same time production 
of guns, tanks and bombers would be 
stopped. 
The appearance of a new type of 
weapon and its production by one of 
the Powers changed the situation. 
Disarmament became even more vital 
than before, but the solution to the 
problem became even more difficult. 
At the first session of the United 
Nations General Assembly in 1948, 
the U.S.S.R. proposed a “draft inter- 
national convention to prohibit the 
production and employment of wea- 
pons based on the use of atomic 
energy for the purpose of mass 
destruction.” This plan called for the 
destruction within three months of all 
atomic weapons and, what is often 
forgotten nowadays, the setting up of 
an international control body with very 
wide powers. This body would have 
had access to atomic installations in 
all countries and made sure that no 
state infringed the convention. 
H.. this project been 
adopted, the atomic bombs in the pos- 
session of the United States would 
have been destroyed, and neither the 
U.S.S.R. nor Great Britain, nor France 
nor any other nation would have been 
able to produce their own Atomic and 
Hydrogen weapons. The problem of 
disarmament would have resumed its 
“pre-nuclear” aspect and might have 
been easier to resolve. 
At the time, however, it was argued 
that the Soviet Union was seeking to 
destroy weapons it did not possess 
and thus obtain a military and strategic 
advantage. In view of the ideas 
6 
could well be justified. But had it 
been possible in 1946 to foresee the 
situation twenty years later, this 
argument might well have lost its full 
force and appeared politically short- 
sighted. 
Scientific and technical progress is 
governed by its own laws which are 
often independent of politics. Even 
in the days when Leonardo da Vinci 
was designing his flying machines, 
men vaguely foresaw the possibility of 
rockets and supersonic planes. Had 
the great atomic physicists and mathe- 
maticians whose names are now fami- . 
liar to everyone (with a timelag of 10 to 
20 years) never been born, there can 
be no doubt that other scientists would 
soon have discovered atomic energy 
along with its immense potentialities 
for destruction as well as for peace. 
The spread of nuclear energy and 
weapons to other countries was thus, 
obviously, only a question of time. 
Tw question of the control 
of nuclear weapons has certainly been 
the big stumbling block of ali discus- 
sions on disarmament. There was 
once a time when heated debates 
occurred over the question “which 
came first the chicken or the egg?” 
In our present age we have seen 
endless discussions on whether con- 
trol should precede disarmament or 
disarmament precede control. It must 
be obvious, however, that the only 
rational formula must be : “No disar- 
mament without control, and no control 
without disarmament.” In theory every- 
one is in agreement on this, both in 
the United States and the Soviet 
Union ; but in practice..... 
[In practice the means of war and 
destruction continue to be stockpiled 
and perfected. For this reason it is 
more important than ever to do 
everything possible to facilitate a 
detente in international relations, and 
to prepare the ground for eventual 
total disarmament by an effort to limit 
the present arms race. 
The first successful attempts in this 
direction was made in 1963 when the 
Powers signatory to the Moscow 
Treaty agreed to ban nuclear weapon 
tests in the atmosphere, in outer space 
and under water. Agreement came 
following a whole series of discus- 
sions, all of which centered on the 
major issue of control.

The Nuclear Test Ban Treaty signed in Moscow on August 5, 1963 prohibited

the agreement was concluded, the

On December 19, 1966 the General 
Assembly of the United Nations 
unanimously adopted a historic treaty 
on principles governing the activities 
of States in the exploration and use of 
outer space including the Moon and 
other celestial bodies. The treaty 
specifically bans the orbiting in space 
of “any objects carrying nuclear 
weapons or any other kinds of wea- 
pons of mass destruction.” This 
“demilitarization of outer space” treaty 
was simultaneously signed in London, 
Moscow and Washington on January 
27, 1967. | was privileged to be 
present at the signing of this impor- 
tant document in Moscow which took 
The UNESCO Courier 2008 N°10 
place in the same building where the 
Moscow Nuclear Test Ban Treaty was 
signed in 1963. 
We should not forget however that 
as early as 1958 the Antarctic Treaty 
(signed by 12 countries operating in 
the southern continent) guaranteed 
that Antarctica “shall continue forever 
to be used exclusively for peaceful 
purposes and shall not become the 
scene or object of international 
discord.” The treaty prohibits the 
establishment of military bases, military 
manceuvres and the testing of any type 
of weapons, and bans nuclear explo- 
slons or the disposal of atomic waste 
in the Antarctic. The demilitarization 
of Antarctica has assured the constant 
friendly co-operation of scientific bases 
and expeditions at work there, 
| feel that these steps, limited 
though they may appear to some, give 
us cause for optimism and are an 
incentive for further steps in the same 
direction. Thus, the time may well 
be ripe now to convene a world confer- 
ence in which every nation possessing 
nuclear weapons would pledge itself 
not to be the first to make use of such 
weapons. Then too, apart from 
Antarctica there are many parts of the 
world where denuclearized zones 
could be established. Plans have 
already been put forward for the 
denuclearization of Scandinavia, the 
Balkans, Africa, Central Europe as 
well as other areas. 
There are also various proposals 
(including one from the U.S.S.R.) for 
the reduction of all military budgets by 
10 to 15 per cent, or by any other 
agreed amount, although events in 
South-East Asia and the Middle East 
have made it extremely difficult to 
carry such projects out. 
The prohibition of underground 
nuclear explosions, however, now 
appears closer to a solution. Two 
years ago, at the 18-nation Geneva 
disarmament talks, several non-com- 
mitted countries put forward a compro- 
mise plan calling for a ban on high- 
powered underground explosions and 
a moratorium on all other underground 
explosions, pending the conclusion of 
a general agreement on the question. 
This proposal does not correspond 
fully to the Soviet position but it has 
been accepted by the U.S.S.R. as a 
palliative to give the discussion a new 
start.

feelings they inspire, | feel | cannot

ber of states acquire nuclear weapons.

these weapons it is subject itself to

THE CHALLENGE OF PEACE (Continued) 


### 189813: The Challenge of peace

The arms race, 
the gravest issue of our time 
prospect of averting great war by 
mutual deterrence is a reasonably 
good prospect.” 
Unfortunately, military conflicts have 
their own laws, or rather, they do not 
obey the laws of common sense. The 
events of last June in the Middle East 
are proof that recourse to arms 
between states or groups of states is 
neither Impossible nor infrequent. 
Can we really therefore be sure that 
if armed conflicts occurred between 
“small” nations possessing nuclear 
weapons that the deterrent factor 
would hold true and that these nations 
would not make use of every weapon 
in their arsenal ? 
| am more inclined to agree with 
another American journalist, John 
Gunther, when he says that in the 
event that all countries gained posses- 
sion of atomic weapons even the 
smallest country could spark off a 
world conflagration. 
Een a tiny country with a 
per capita revenue from 22 to 25 times 
smalier than that of the United States 
may soon be in a position, | believe, 
to produce atomic weapons. Today 
some 10 to 15 countries possess 
nuclear reactors destined for peaceful 
purposes. But technical advances 
and the dissemination of scientific data 
are such that, with the reduction in the 
cost of producing nuclear arms, soon 
there will be not just 10 to 15 countries 
but 50 or more potentially capable of 
undertaking the manufacture of wea- 
pons of mass destruction. 
For these reasons the conclusion of 
an agreement on the non-proliferation 
of nuclear weapons seems to me 
particularly urgent. Most people are 
familiar with the arguments for and 
against this question. They have 
been voiced repeatedly at the Geneva 
disarmament meetings, in diplomatic 
circles and in the world press. The 
most telling argument against a non- 
proliferation treaty stresses that such 
a treaty would perpetuate the mono- 
poly in atomic weapons of the present 
nuclear nations. This overlooks the 
point that an agreement on the non- 
proliferation of nuclear weapons is not 
an end in itself but only a first indis- 
pensable step towards the total 
banning of these weapons and their 
destruction in arsenals everywhere in 
the world. Furthermore, should such 
a non-proliferation treaty become a 
The UNESCO Courier 2008 N°10 
reality, it is proposed that the non- 
nuclear powers would be completely 
guaranteed against any possible 
nuclear attack by a nuclear power. 
Another argument against non-pro- 
liferation holds that the banning of 
production of nuclear weapons (as 
well as the contro! necessary to 
enforce the ban) would hamper tech- 
nical development in the contracting 
countries by preventing them from 
using atomic energy for peaceful 
purposes. It should not be difficult, 
however, to devise forms of centrol 
that would not prejudice a nation's 
industrial development. Furthermore, 
the pooling of knowledge and research 
in the peaceful use of atomic energy 
would increase as the possibility of its 
being employed in the manufacture of 
arms was eliminated. 
It is easy to understand—though not 
always easy to approve—the reasons 
that prompt nations to keep arms in 
their arsenals. But the sums spent 
are staggering. In 1964 the world 
poured down the drain the astronomi- 
cal sum of 120,000 million dollars for 
armaments. The figure is consider- 
ably higher today. If some imaginary 
inhabitant of another solar system 
was fo visit our planet he would no 
doubt find it hard to understand why 
we Earthlings squander our resources 
and energies so uselessly. 
The examples of Vietnam and the 
Middle East make it abundantly clear 
that in this day and age no problem 
can be resolved by resort to war, 
And even less so by resorting to 
nuclear weapons. The problem of 
armaments today and their destructive 
nature is thus the most poignant issue 
of our time, 
R 1967, the U.S.S.R. will 
spend 14,500 million roubles (13.2 per 
cent of its budget) on defence. (1) 
There are undoubtedly many ways in 
which this money could be usefully 
employed in the Soviet Union. The 
United States spends even huger sums 
on arms, including the war in Vietnam. 
  
(1) Editor's note: The U.S.S.R. does not 
include research and development costs in 
its defence budget. Total actual defence 
expenditure for 1966 has been estimated 
at over 35000 million dollars. (The 
exchange rate of the rouble is one rouble 
= 90 U.S. cents.) 
And it too still has many social prob- 
lems to solve, bottlenecks in educa- 
tion, pubtic health and science, where 
these resources now spent on arms, 
could be usefully employed. . 
On the assumption that arms expen- 
diture remained at the present level 
(which no one really wants), the Soviet 
Union will spend 230,000 million rou- 
bles in the course of the next 20 years. 
If general and complete disarmament 
were to become a reality, and suppos- 
ing even that 20 per cent of the money 
saved by disarmament were diverted 
for the developing countries, the 
U.S.S.R. would still have 230,000 
million roubles left over for useful 
purposes. The money could be spent 
for an infinite variety of purposes, to 
raise the standard of living of the 
Soviet people, to launch large-scale 
development projects in Siberia, irri- 
gate desert lands, etc... 
A jook at a map of world 
development shows us that entire 
continents are in need of resources 
and assistance to carry through their 
full development. To cite only one 
example, the harnessing of the world’s 
water resources could transform vast 
regions of our planet. In Asia, the 
Indus and the Mekong, the Tigris and 
Euphrates ; in Africa, the Nile and its 
tributaries, and the Congo; in Latin 
America, the Parana and the Amazon. 
Mankind is only now becoming 
aware of the great riches and possi- 
bilities at its disposal. Were these to 
be effectively exploited, they could 
eliminate hunger, sickness and many 
other problems due to low living 
standards, such as illiteracy which still 
affects many hundreds of millions of 
the inhabitants of developing countries. 
By the rational use of its energy and 
intelligence, mankind could fulfil its 
destiny at a much more rapid pace, 
and even on a universal scale now 
that man is moving beyond the limits 
of the earth's gravity. 
In ancient times, people used to 
dream about the “Golden Age”. But in 
the times of Plato or Thomas More, 
this was in fact a Utopia, a mere 
dream of happiness. Today, with the 
help of electronic machines we can 
calculate the extent to which progress 
in various spheres of human existence 
would be speeded up should an epoch 
of general peace and complete dis- 
armament be ushered in.

The recent victory of Barack

and could have significant reper- 
cussions. We could hardly fail to be 
overjoyed that Martin Luther King's

the inter-ethnic violence that broke

surgence of hatred in other guises. 
Especially since the 11 September 
2001 attacks, the alarming notion 
of potentially terrorist communities 
has emerged, showing just how 
dangerous it can be to lump togeth- 
er certain acts with factors such as 
race, culture and religion. 
Racism did not fall 
from the sky 
This kind of amalgam obscures an 
analysis or understanding of rac- 
ism. There was a time when rac- 
ist ideas were peddled by parties 
clearly identified as belonging to 
the extreme right. But, gradually, 
under the pretext of defending na- 
tional identity, and combating illegal 
immigration or terrorism, inherently 
racist arguments have crept into 
the electoral campaigns of demo- 
cratic parties. Alliances within cer- 
9 
tain governments are allowing na- 
tionalist and extreme right parties 
to implement their xenophobic and 
racist ideals, by giving them a dem- 
ocratic legitimacy. 
The use of racism for electoral or 
political ends is now being comple- 
mented by an intellectual or sci- 
entific legitimisation of racism and 
xenophobia, as seen in the declara- 
tions of well-known public figures, 
university research and mass mar- 
ket publications. 
To take just one example, there 
was the theory of the clash of civili- 
sations, developed by the American 
academic, Samuel Huntington in 
the mid-1990s, according to which 
the West would be threatened by 
China and Islam. A few years later, 
in his book, Who Are We? he went 
on to ponder the supposed threat 
to American identity posed by Lat- 
in-Americans living in the USA. 
Racist or xenophobic ideas ex- 
pressed by people who have en- 
joyed fame at a certain moment in 
history gradually filter into politics, 
religion, literature, education and 
the media, ending up by taking root 
in people's minds. The distorted im- 
age of Muslims did not begin with 
11 September. It is the result of a 
lengthy intellectual process that 
started with the first encounters 
between Islam and Christianity. The 
distorted image of black people is 
the fruit of an intellectual process 
that legitimised the transatlantic 
slave-trade and justified the sale of 
human beings by proving their infe- 
riority, by demonising them, and re- 
ducing them to mere objects, turn- 
ing to theories and laws for support. 
In other words, racism has deep, 
cultural and historical roots, and did 
not just fall from the sky one day. 
If the clash of civilisations is an 
illusion, multiculturalism is a real- 
ity. Let us take the example of the 
new Europe. National identities le-

The distorted image of dark-skinned people is the fruit

gitimately inherited by nation states 
rub shoulders every day with the 
identities of other ethnic, cultural 
and religious communities. The for- 
mer feel threatened and the latter, 
frustrated. 
A deafening silence 
This frustration does not just come 
from the political, economic and so- 
cial marginalisation of people whom 
we ask to divest themselves of their 
identity, to stuff their memories in an 
old trunk and take on, as in France, 
the costume of the Republic, the 
symbol of their new identity. The 
roots of this frustration plunge deep 
into history. But public debate on the 
deeper causes of the presence of 
these communities on European soil 
is virtually non-existent. Colonialism 
and the slave trade are glossed over 
or suppressed as chapters in his- 
tory. After all, we had to wait until the 
international conference on racism 
in Durban (South Africa) in 2001 for 
the transatlantic slave trade finally 
to be recognised as a crime against 
humanity. Distorting or ignoring cer- 
tain historical realities, preventing 
them from passing into the national 
memory, can only lead to flare-ups, 
like those that erupted in French 
suburbs two years ago. 
We might wonder if, in the process 
of unification, Europe has not over- 
looked a fundamental problem — the 
creation of a new identity, in other 
The UNESCO Courier 2008 N°10 
words, the multiculturalism that de- 
fines it today. Looking at certain 
immigration policies, we might ask 
if Europe is even aware that immi- 
grants are also carriers of humanity, 
and that multiculturalism is mutually 
enriching. Foreigners who come to 
live in Europe have to adapt to the 
social rules of their host country. 
That is not in question. But they must 
also be able to plant a few beautiful 
flowers in Europe's garden. 
Multiculturalism at the 
core of the struggle 
Multiculturalism is at the core of 
contemporary manifestations of 
racism and xenophobia, and it is 
around multiculturalism that the 
struggle against racism must be 
shaped. 
Rapidly spreading outbreaks of 
violence between ethnic and re- 
ligious groups can be witnessed 
around the world, showing that a

purely legislative strategy is not 
enough. It is essential to continue 
to pass laws, and to draft regula- 
tions and other national or inter- 
national texts condemning racism, 
discrimination and xenophobia, but 
this only strikes at the visible tip of 
the iceberg. What render the womb 
fertile, in the words of Brecht, are 
the deeper sources of racism, 
which cannot be influenced by leg- 
islation alone. 
It is essential to have an intellectu- 
al and ethical strategy. Without this, 
we will not be able to shake the rac- 
ist mentality. It means getting to the 
historical and cultural basis of rac- 
ism; uniting against the fecundity of 
racist arguments, against their use 
by politicians and their normalisa- 
tion by the media. It means recog- 
nising the reality of cultural, ethnic 
and religious diversity as the basis 
for dialogue between civilisations, 
on the national as well as the inter- 
national stage - in a word, learning 
to live together. 
In order to oust racist ideology, it 
Is necessary to develop an archae- 
ology of the deep-seated causes 
of racism. Anti-racist ideology must 
follow the same paths which racism 
has used to insinuate itself — politics, 
religion, literature, education and the 
media — to end up by taking root in 
the minds of men and women.

fact that different “races” must live in 
different areas, but far more in the fact 
that the areas assigned to the non- 
White groups are the overcrowded 
and eroded parts of the countryside. 
Inevitably those assigned to living 
there would face starvation unless 
they went as migrants and transients 
to seek work in the White areas. So 
what the theory of Apartheid means 
is this: that black men will work for 
white so long as political power lies 
where it does. 
Such a system as this is the product 
of conquest and of the monopoly of 
political power by a conquering group. 
The conquerors seize upon the fact of 
skin colour in order to imply that the 
inequality which they have created is 
given by Nature, that it is the inevit- 
able consequence of biological differ-

ences, or even that it is the will of 
God. 
Such a political system could have 
been established in many parts of the 
colonial world, but the process of 
decolonization set in train by the vic- 
tory of 1945 and assisted by United 
Nations action succeeded in many 
countries in opening equal opportun- 
ities to all. Hence today we see many 
cases where those who govern a newly 
independent country are the children 
of peasants or of political prisoners. 
But where White supremacy and 
Apartheid prevail, coloured people

THE SHADOW OF RACISM (Continued)

Wiping out discrimination— 
first step to exploding racist theories 
based upon inequality of political rights 
between races. 
But racism and its social consequen- 
ces are evident not only in the former 
colonial territories. They are an ever 
present feature of the life of advanced 
industrial countries. [Increasingly in 
some at least of these countries the 
traditional political issues pale into 
insignificance beside the problem of 
racial inequality and men's attempt 
to fight against it. 
Inevitably in the post 1945 world, 
with the advanced countries of Europe 
and North America undergoing a 
period of unparalleled economic pros- 
perity, immigrants have come to their 
cities from the poorer countries, from 
the rural areas and from the areas 
where the old slave plantations were. 
There 1s much evidence to suggest 
that this migration has not represent- 
ed an uncontrolled and uncontrolla- 
ble flood, for the immigrants have 
exercised thelr own immigration con- 
The UNESCO Courier 2008 N°10 
Nevertheless this is precisely how 
this immigration has been perceived in 
the countries concerned and they have 
reacted by throwing up barriers either 
to immigration itself or to full equality 
of opportunity for the immigrant in 
fields such as housing or employment. 
Such barriers may not have an expli- 
citly racial form. They may affect all 
newcomers. But there can be little 
doubt that coloured people are most 
affected by them and that the discrimi- 
nation involved is widely thought to be 
based upon colour and race. 
Hence what we see is the segre- 
gation of coloured people in squalid 
lodging houses if not by themselves, 
together with the down end outs and 
outcasts of the host society, as well 
as a denial of equal employment op- 
portunities so that the coloured unem- 
ployment rate is often several times 
as high as that for the society as a 
whole. Such trends as these are only 
amplified as increasing technological 
13 
have good jobs are better housed and 
better paid than they have ever been 
before. 
A majority in these circumstances 
can fight for justice and equality 
through the ballot box. For a minor- 
ity the problem is more difficult. 
They may appeal to the courts, and 
this they have sometimes done with 
success. But where law is inade- 
guate in scope or too tardy in redres- 
sing grievances there seems to have 
been no alternative open but riot, law- 
lessness, and civil disobedience. 
In Europe's history the main themes 
of political ¢hange have centred on 
the struggle of classes, and Euro- 
peans, interpreting the politics of the 
colonial world, have tended to see 
there a retelling of their own story. 
The most striking fact of the world 
today is that colonial people and 
coloured people reject these inter- 
pretations. They note that discrimina- 
tion and inequality are not the lot of

workers. 
Less and less are they willing to 
accept advice which tells them that 
their problems are not racial ones or 
that they should throw in their lot with 
the international working class. In- 
stead they set alongside Europe's theo- 
ries of political change, of increasing 
equality and welfare being achieved 
through working class action, their own 
theories of Black Power or the Colo- 
nial Revolution. 
A number of recent writers have 
seen the divisions which are arising 
in the world in these terms. New divi- 
sions are opening up and new allian- 
ces are being formed. On a world 
scale we have the sense of what Marx 
saw within the nation state in the nine- 
teenth century: the division of men 
into "two great warring camps”. But 
the camps are no longer the camps of 
social and economic class. The “war” 
which we face threatens to be a race 
war. 
In this headlong rush to disaster 
those who oppose racism must 
oppose it at its roots. They have, of 
course, to expose its untruth and its 
fallacy, but this of itself is not enough. 
It is necessary to find ways of protect- 
ing people against discrimination and 
it is necessary fo understand the 
social and psychological causes which 
lead to false racial beliefs having the 
wide acceptance which they do. 
These are problems to which social 
scientists as well as the United Nations 
specialized agencies should be addres- 
sing themselves, 
The declaration by biologists meet- 
ing under the auspices of Unesco 
in Moscow in 1964 did much to ensure 
that racist theories were denied any 
kind of scientific support. The con- 
sensus amongst biologists is now per- 
fectly clear and it amounts to this: 
the inequalities which we observe in 
the world today do not arise from the 
different genetic inheritance of men. 
Men are not unequal because they 
were born unequal. And this being 
so, the justice or injustice of existing 
inequalities is not a closed question. 
it is a legitimate subject of political 
debate. 
In the fight against racism the Mos- 
cow declaration of the biologists 
should be used to maximum effect. 
Schools and the mass media can be 
used to ensure that the facts about 
the biology of race are known. Unfor- 
tunately they can also be used to 
The UNESCO Courier 2008 N°10 
lem here is the one which always 
faces those who hope for reform 
through education. Who is to edu- 
cate the educators? Clearly Unesco 
must do whatever it can to see to it 
that those who teach, either through 
the schools or through the media, are 
thoroughly educated. 
Those who wish to secure justice 
and the elimination of racist practice 
cannot wait however until the whole 
population is educated. Nor can they 
await a universal “change of heart " 
It is precisely this notion, namely that 
the ending of racism requires a univer- 
sal change of heart, which is used to 
justify its continuance. So long as 
there are people being deprived of a 
fair opportunity in life, it should be the 
duty of any government which truly 
opposes racism, to use its power to 
make law to prevent and to punish 
all acts of a racist kind. 
N O ONE with any experien- 
ce of legislation against racial discri- 
mination imagines that it can be le- 
gislated out of existence. Most 
usually the racist finds loopholes in 
the law, or he proceeds to discriminate 
on grounds which are not overtly racist 
(e.g. he argues that the deprived group 
is uneducated or has unacceptable cul- 
tural standards). Nonetheless law it- 
self has an educative role and the 
effect of only a few court cases on 
public opinion, especially among those 
who have no strong racist views, can 
be considerable. 
It is precisely where law fails that 
the deprived and underprivileged are 
likely to take the law into their own 
hands. Urban riots and theories like 
that of Black Power are, more than 
anything else, assertions that the law 
has failed in its responsibilities. The 
end to violence and lawlessness can 
lie only in the law doing what violence 
claimed to do, namely to guarantee 
the rights of the individual. 
Finally, however, racism must be 
fought not merely by protecting people 
from the consequences of racist acts, 
but by eliminating those social sit- 
uations which cause racism. For if 
we fail to do this the likelihood is that 
it will only re-emerge in a disguised 
form. The real hope in the fight 
against racism lies precisely in the 
fact that something can be done to 
deal with the problem at its roots. 
14 
behaviour itself has any kind of here- 
ditary roots. It is true that it is asso- 
ciated in its extreme form with patho- 
logical personality characteristics and 
there is scope here for action by psy- 
chiatrists in eliminating it. But the 
fact is that the majority of those who 
are susceptible to racist propaganda 
are not sick or disturbed people in 
this sense. The main problem which 
we have to face is how racism arises 
in this group and how it can be stop- 
ped. 
What sociologists have shown from 
the time of Gunnar Myrdal's great 
study of the American Negro onwards 
is that once discrimination starts, the 
man who is discriminated against is 
in fact in an inferior position and that 
this inferiority is used as proof of 
racist theory. 
The problem then is to nip racism 
in the bud by eliminating discrimina- 
tion itself. Thus discrimination in 
housing leads to the coloured man 
living in inferior conditions. These 
conditions are then used as a reason 
for not allowing him to move into 
better houses. The only answer to 
this problem is to stop the discrimi- 
nation and by ensuring that all men 
have adequate housing remove from 
the public mind the image of the 
coloured man as a natural slum 
dweller. 
If the social roots of racism are un- 
derstood in this way there will be less 
chance of the development of new in- 
stances of political regimes based upon 
theories of racial supremacy. This is 
the task to which most of us must now 
address ourselves, a defensive task 
to prevent racism from winning new 
victories. It is a task of mobilizing 
understanding and goodwill wherever 
we can find it, in unofficial as well as 
in governmental quarters, 
This is the least we can do. Not to 
do it means that the world will drift 
more and more towards the situation 
of two great warring racial camps. But 
if we can do it and, as it were, hold 
the line where it is, it may yet be pos- 
sible to go on to deal with the most 
serious problems of all to find the 
means of dealing with those cases 
where governments themselves are 
racist beyond redemption and where 
international sanctions have to be em- 
ployed to bring them into line with the 
moral standards of the twentieth cen- 
tury.

Luc MONTAGNIER 
Following the announcement of his Nobel Prize in medicine, Luc Montagnier 
gave a press conference at UNESCO on 8 October 2008. 
Twenty years ago in the Courier, 
British scientist John R. Vane 
(Nobel prize in medicine 1982) 
stressed the importance of 
international cooperation in the 
battle against AIDS. Today, one of 
the principal protagonists of this 
cooperation, Luc Montagnier from 
France, lists in his interview with 
Jasmina Sopova the weapons 
we have against the pandemic, 
which has killed more than 
25 million people in the world. 
The World Foundation for AIDS 
Research and Prevention that 
you set up under the aegis of 
UNESCO is already 15 years 
old. What are its aims and what 
results has it produced? 
The Foundation aims to promote 
AIDS research and prevention, 
especially in developing countries, 
which are the most affected by this 
disease. It sets up pilot centres in 
these countries to develop a triple 
strategy, combining prevention, ed- 
ucation and research. 
In 1996 we set up a research cen- 
tre in Cote d'Ivoire with, of course, 
the agreement and aid of the Ivo- 
rian government at the time. We 
The UNESCO Courier 2008 N°10 
have since received the support of 
all the country’s successive govern- 
ments. The Centre is in the capital, 
Abidjan, but there are branches in 
other Ivorian towns. 
We started by setting up a labora- 
tory dedicated to isolating the virus. 
Today the Centre has a new build- 
ing for diagnosis and the treatment 
of outpatients. It also has a lecture 
room for education and preven- 
tion. Here, we train trainers to raise 
awareness in the local population 
on AIDS prevention in the work- 
place. For example, most of what, 
in Africa, are called “the uniformed 
corps” (the military, police, fire fight- 
ers, customs, rangers, etc) have 
sent delegations for training in our 
Centre. 
You recently opened a Centre 
in Cameroon, too. But, accord- 
ing to UNAIDS, it is mostly in 
Southern Africa that the epi- 
demic is reaching disastrous 
proportions. 
Although the figures for West Af- 
rica are less alarming than those for 
Southern Africa, they are still much 
higher than anything we are seeing 
in industrialised countries. The rate 
15 
IMMUNITIES 
of infection in Cote d'Ivoire is cur- 
rently running at about 5.7%. This 
is not negligible. 
We looked into the possibility of 
opening a centre in South Africa 
a few years ago. But at that time 
the authorities there were not con- 
vinced that the virus that we had 
isolated was the cause of AIDS, 
and so they did not offer their sup- 
port. In the Congo, Gabon and 
Tanzania, the Heads of state were 
interested, but we came up against 
the question of funding. 
It should be pointed out that the 
Foundation can only act if States 
support it, by providing land or 
funding. The Centre in Cameroon 
is funded by the government and 
aid from developed countries, such 
as ltaly. | should also say that the 
government of Cameroon is making 
remarkable efforts in terms of youth 
education. | was surprised to visit 
schools where children aged 8 to 
10 knew all about AIDS. 
The Abidjan Centre operates par- 
tially with its own funds. A large 
number of patients use it — those 
who can afford it, pay, of course. 
Those who cannot, do not pay. 
Treatment is often provided free,

Certain practices, such as scarification,

thanks to government policy and 
aid from the Global Fund to Fight 
AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria 
(GFATM). 
Have you run into 
any cultural obstacles? 
Africa has its specific problems. 
It is therefore extremely important 
to take the cultural context into ac- 
count. Certain local practices facili- 
tate transmission of the virus, such 
as ritual scarring of newborns, or 
childbirth without sterile instruments. 
Often, women come into the mater- 
nity clinic in good health and leave 
HIV-positive, because of the re-use 
of non-sterile medical equipment. 
The main reason is a lack of resourc- 
es, but there is also a lack of informa- 
tion. Babies of working mothers are 
sometimes infected by the milk of 
wet-nurses who take care of them. 
At the same time, many people do 
not want to be tested for HIV, for 
fear of stigmatisation. Our role is to 
convince them to be tested so that 
they can then be treated. But when 
they are treated, some abandon the 
therapy for financial reasons as soon 
as they start to feel better. The result 
is that they fall ill again. 
Do you work 
with traditional healers? 
We could definitely envisage work- 
ing with traditional practitioners. But it 
is not easy to regulate their products, 
since their composition is a secret, 
passed down from generation to

generation. And, because they can- 
not be patented, their products are 
of no interest to the pharmaceutical 
industry. 
In our Abidjan Centre we tested a 
product from Japan, based on fer- 
mented papaya extract. The Japanese 
hold the secret of how it is made, but 
here is an example of a well-defined 
product, according to pharmaceuti- 
cal criteria, and which has been sub- 
ject to controlled clinical trials. Each 
batch is identical, which is not always 
the case with plant extracts. 
Trials showed that this product is 
not a replacement for triple therapy, 
of course, but it did enhance its bene- 
ficial effects on the patients’ immune 
system. We have carried out a sec- 
ond clinical trial and are waiting for 
the results. 
We are also testing other immuno- 
stimulants. If the therapeutic vaccine 
that we are currently working on is to 
succeed, the patient's immune sys- 
tem has to be restored. Triple therapy 
alone is not enough. 
You think that AIDS will be 
eradicated through a therapeu- 
tic vaccine. You already spoke 
about this in 2000 in UNESCO 
Sources magazine. What is 
the status of research today? 
The concept can already be traced 
back ten years. In the beginning, the 
idea of a therapeutic vaccine got a 
very poor reception from French and 
international funding bodies. The 
idea was not appealing, because 
there were hopes for a preventive 
vaccine and it was thought a cure 
would be found. 
Much has changed since then. We 
now know that triple therapy is not a 
cure and that lifelong treatment pro- 
vokes toxic effects, leading to other 
linesses that are often fatal. 
Today the therapeutic vaccine proj- 
ect is mature and on a better course, 
because it will receive private funding. 
Do you think that the Nobel 
Prize will help you to find other 
sources of funding? 
| hope so! To give you a short and 
specific answer. 
16 
What are the advantages 
of a therapeutic vaccine? 
Nature provides us with examples 
of people who are HIV carriers, but 
are not ill with AIDS. We are look- 
ing for a therapeutic vaccine that 
will increase the immunity of some- 
one who is infected, enabling his 
or her body to defend itself. Some- 
one infected will therefore be able 
to live with HIV without developing 
the illness. 
It should be remembered that 
treatment for one person costs 
$12,000 a year, and it may go on 
for 20 or 30 years. A vaccine, on 
the other hand, requires just three 
injections: two successive shots 
and a booster later on. It's stan- 
dard. No matter how much it costs, 
it will be 20 - 50 times cheaper than 
triple therapy. 
When will we see a cure 
for AIDS? 
Curing people and getting rid of 
the epidemic are two different things. 
Curing is indeed our immediate 
objective, and this will have a sig- 
nificant effect on the epidemic. 
When people know that they can 
be cured, they will more readily 
come forward for testing, those 
cured will no longer pass on the 
virus, and so on. 
But we cannot expect that we 
will miraculously find a cure over- 
night. We should not count on a 
preventive vaccine in the immedi- 
ate future. Personally, | do not be- 
lieve in a preventive vaccine for 
AIDS. Clinical trials have shown 
that groups who were vaccinated 
were more likely to become in- 
fected than those who were not, 
because they believed they were 
protected by the vaccine, which 
was not the case. 
AIDS could be eradicated by a 
combination of treatments that 
involves cure, information and 
education, especially targeted at 
young people in schools. Even if 
we find a preventive vaccine, we 
must still continue to educate 
people to behave responsibly to 
prevent the spread of HIV.

### 189818: Co-operation: the best way to combat AIDS

  
    
The UNESCO Courier 2008 N°10 
he problem of AIDS requires a 
threefold solution. The first, which 
should certainly reduce the inci- 
dence of the disease, is that of prophylaxis 
by education. However, the results of the 
campaign waged against cigarette smoking 
in the United Kingdom during the last 
twenty years suggest that educational action 
will cake time to bear fruit. 
The other two solutions are prevention 
through vaccination and trearment with 
drugs. Both of these need enormous re- 
search and development resources. Aca- 
demic research is, on the whole, being well 
funded. The scientific competition is enor- 
mous butt is also healthy because it leads to 
rapid publication and dissemination of 
knowledge on which others can build. 
A different kind of competition is in- 
volved in the development of vaccines 
against AIDS by the pharmaceutical indus- 
try. Here profit rather than kudos becomes 
the mouve, 
17 
  
THE COURIER, 1988 
eration — 
AIDS 
“Research into the prevention and treatment of 
AIDS must be pooled and encouraged, rather 
than slowed down and overly partitioned, in 
particular with the co-operation of the phar- 
maceutical industry.” This was one of the con- 
clusions reached by the Nobel Laureate Con- 
ference beld at the Elysée Palace in Paris (see, 
page 34). Above, still from Sharing for Survi- 
val, a short videofilm produced by the United 
Nations University. 
In the last twenty years more and more 
drug companies have opted out of research 
into human vaccines because of the nsks 
involved, mainly the potential high costs of 
damages claimed by patients and others 
against the companies for what are per- 
ceived co be side-effects of the vaccines. 
These risks have come to ourweigh earnings 
from profits. Thus, only a few mulunatonal

of developing and testing vaccines. Of 
course, the case of AIDS is a special one 
because of the frightening prospects and so 
we can expect governments to relax their 
stringent safety regulations to speed a vac- 
cine to the marker. Nevertheless, the indus- 
try will (and indeed must) look for ways 
whereby the bability for perceived side- 
effects is carried by others. This usually 
means the governments which sponsor vac- 
CiNAtion campaigns. 
The third solution is to find and develop 
effective drugs against AIDS and it is here 
that we may have to look for new ways of 
solving old problems. Clearly new effective 
anti-AIDS drugs are urgently needed and 
will be for many years to come, to treat the 
millions of people already infected and all 
those who will become infected, because of 
lack of proper prophylaxis. 
New drugs are a means of making new 
profits, and their development and market- 
ing is a highly competitive and expensive 
business. One company makes a break- 
through based upon research either in house 
or in academia, puts large chemical re- 
sources into optimizing the desired activity 
and protecting the patent and then begins 
the laborious business of development. 
Wich the present legislation for safety, effi- 
cacy and lack of side-effects at least ten 
vears may elapse between the discovery and 
marketing of a drug. In the meantime, as 
soon as the breakthrough is sensed, other 
companies put parallel chemical, pharmac- 
ological and developmental resources into 
finding their own patentable and profitable 
copy, albeit with some improvements such 
as less side-effects, better delivery or better 
patient compliance. 
On the one hand, it is argued that this free 
competition between drug companies is 
healchy and, through the profit motive, 
leads co betcer and better remedies for more 
and more diseases. On the other hand, it is 
said that there are too many drugs on the 
market and that the World Health Orga- 
nization (WHO) list of 200 essential drugs is 
sufficient. These contradictory views will 
continu¢ and there will be a constant con- 
flict of interests between the need of the 
drug companies to preserve profits and the 
need of governments and patients to contain 
their drug bills. 
My purpose 1a raising this issue is simply 
to point out that under the present system 
of free enterprise a new drug therapy for 
AIDS will not be produced because drug 
companies wish to cure the disease, but 
because they wish to make a profit from it! 
My question is whether we can afford, both 
in time and monetary terms, to allow the 
commercial competitive process to run its 
course or whether we can find new solu- 
tions which will speed up the acquisition of 
effective drug therapy. 
Certainly, governments around the world 
have shown that they realize the urgency of 
the problem by giving product licences for

the only existing drug, AZT or Rertrovir, 
with a remarkable and unprecedented ala- 
crity. What can the industry do now? 
I would suggest that this is not the time 
and this is not the disease for following 
conventional pathways. We need to find 
new solutions. One of these could be co- 
operation rather than competition between 
pharmaceutical companies. Already there 
are some areas in which there is loose co- 
operation between the multinational drug 
companies. Surely here is another one where 
an experimental approach could be tried. 
For instance, an Institute for AIDS Re- 
  
A 
“The problem of AIDS calls for a threefold 
solution... prophylaxis by education, ... pre- 
vention through vaccination, and treatment 
with drugs.” Pharmaceutical researchers are 
racing against time to conquer this terrible

search, dedicated to the discovery of anti- 
viral drugs to combat the disease, could be 
funded as 2 co-operative venture by the 
pharmaceutical industry, In such an Inst- 
tute the chemical skills needed to synthesize 
the many thousands of new compounds that 
may be needed before the right one is found 
could be co-ordinated, rather than pitted 
against each other. Kudos and profit would 
be shared equitably between the contrib- 
ucors to the funding of the Insurute. I am 
sure that, given good-will between the com- 
panies, the licensing and patent lawyers 
would find ways of enabling co-operation 
to exist in the anti-AIDS field and this could 
well speed up the process of discovery and 
development. 
There is another area in which the drug 
industry could make an unusually generous 
contribution. At present, a course of Retro- 
vir costs around $200 per week and some 
patients will be taking an anti-AJDS drug 
for the rest of their lives. We are told that 
there are already 5 million people in Africa 
carrying AIDS and this clearly poses a spe- 
cial problem, for neither they nor their 
governments will be able to afford expensive 
treatments. However, a precedent has ai- 
ready been set: one far-sighted company has 
made the inspired policy decision to give the 
drug Ivermectin to Africa vo treat river- 
blindness. By taking only two oral doses a 
year, untold numbers of people will prob-. 
ably be prevented from becoming blind. 
This remarkable and courageous decision 
will not only make a major contribution to 
the struggle against 2 crippling tropical 
disease, but will also pass over 10 the gov- 
ernments concerned the responsibility for 
any incidental environmental damage. 
Perhaps this precedent could be 2 model 
for the pharmaceutical indusiry when it 
finds an effective anti-AIDS vaccine or 
drug. Ler the medicine be donated to those 
in Africa and perhaps elsewhere who would 
never have a chance of buying it! 
My plea, therefore, is for the drug indus- 
try to adopt a “club” approach to the con- 
quest of this terrible disease. Pharmaceutical 
companies already fund academic research 
units in areas of discovery on an individual 
basis. In the case of AIDS, let them club 
together and do it on an industry-wide 
basis. They do not have to eschew che profit 
motive but only to modify it by jointly and 
generously funding chemists and biologists 
in a large Institute dedicated to ending this 
new affliction. a

Stem cells. Scientific advances modify the premises of ethical dilemmas. 
    
  
     
ta time when scientific research is 
InCreasingly international, national 
legislation and biomedical practices 
merchandise. 
“The human body and its parts shall 
not, as such, give rise to financial 
gain, stipulates the 1997 Conven- 
tion on Human Rights and Biomedi- 
cine (Council of Europe). Given the 
principle of the non-commercial- 
isation of the human body, its parts 
(organs and tissues) and products 
(gametes, cells, etc) have long been 
excluded from commercial gain. But 
several countries are reconsidering 
their position. For example, France 
Is envisaging authorising surrogate 
motherhood and relaxing its legisla- 
tion on remuneration for donors of 
organs, tissues or eggs, while strictly 
The UNESCO Courier 2008 N°10 
regulating practices. The Netherlands 
and the United Kingdom allow free 
gestational surrogacy under certain 
conditions. The British Parliament is 
studying the possibility of allowing 
specialised agencies to receive pay- 
ment in return for certain services. Al- 
though Spain has banned surrogate 
motherhood, Spanish couples often 
tun to women in Latin America to 
bear their children. And, today, the 
principle of non-commercialisation of 
the human body is being tested by the 
disparate practices and legislation in 
different parts of the world regarding 
organ and tissue transplants, removal 
of gametes for donation and “womb 
rental”. The current rate for the latter 
is between US$60,000 - $100,000 
dollars, in those States that allow it. 
Meanwhile, the ethical debate on 
the creation of embryos is being re- 
vived with chimeric embryos, or cy- 
19 
brids. The procedure, derived from 
cloning, consists of extracting the 
nucleus of a non-reproductive human 
cell and introducing it into the ovule 
of a rabbit or cow. Following a two- 
year debate, the UK Parliament re- 
cently authorised research on cybrid 
embryos, while the fertilisation of ani- 
mal ovules by human sperm or vice- 
versa is still banned. The law, dated 
13 June 2008, requires their destruc- 
tion at the latest 14 days after their 
creation and bans implantation into a 
human or animal uterus. 
Research on cybrid embryos will un- 
doubtedly advance our understand- 
ing of the behaviour of embryo cells 
during the first 14 days, as well as the 
mechanisms of development of seri- 
ous illnesses during these first stages 
of life. It will also replace the ethically 
debatable removal of human ovules 
by the removal of animal ovules. Nev- 
ertheless, several scientific and ethical 
bodies in the UK hold the opinion that 
these cybrid embryos should be con- 
sidered human embryos if their DNA 
contains human genetic material. 
This latest development has shaken 
two basic understandings tacitly ac- 
cepted by the international commu- 
nity for 30 years: not creating human- 
animal chimeras, and not implanting 
a human embryo in the uterus of an 
animal and vice-versa. 
Nanotechnologies: 
avoiding misuse 
Another scientific area providing food 
for thought for ethicists is nanotech- 
nologies. Miniaturised electronic im- 
plants are increasingly being used 
for medical or other purposes. Along- 
side their potential for diagnosis, they 
are also being used in clinical trials to

study the effects of new drugs on the 
nervous system. Treatments are also 
being perfected to re-establish com- 
munication in damaged areas of the 
nervous system and to destroy can- 
cerous tumours. 
We can expect a considerable 
boom in the use of these implants, 
as progress in the neurosciences 
enables us to understand how to in- 
fluence behaviour, such as improving 
memory, suppressing craving in drug 
and alcohol dependency, etc. 
Applications already extend to the 
treatment of water and the conserva- 
tion and conversion of energy. But, at 
the present time, there is little reliable 
knowledge about the risks of nano- 
particles for the environment or hu- 
man health. 
Furthermore, implants that use infor- 
mation and communications technol- 
ogies (ITC) could be used for individ- 
ual and social control and to gather, 
store, use or transfer personal data.

lated on their use, or at least, existing 
legislation has not tackled the issue 
of the manipulation of individuals by 
interfering with ITC implants, let alone 
the use of the personal data that they 
might provide. 
Lessons for the future 
Bioethics has been built upon respect 
for human dignity and the protection 
of human rights and basic freedoms. 
But a close examination of bioethics 
reveals that it periodically revises its 
paradigms and analyses in the light of 
the constant progress being made in 
life and medical sciences, and the re- 
sulting developments in applications. 
But this approach, far from rendering 
bioethics more vulnerable, anchors it 
in contemporary scientific reality. 
Over the course of the past 20 years, 
ethical thinking has largely dealt with 
subjects that raised high hopes, an- 
ticipating their technical mastery. This 
was the case for xenotransplantation, 
Le. the transplantation of organs from 
genetically modified animals in order 
to render them compatible with hu- 
man recipients. Between 1993 and 
2002, ethical reflections on this sub- 
ject occupied a number of interdisci- 
plinary working groups, universities 
and ethical bodies. One outcome was 
the drafting of a Recommendation on 
xenotransplantation by the Council of 
Europe, in June 20083. Interest in this 
practice, which was supposed to re- 
spond to the lack of human organs 
available for transplant, gradually fad- 
ed as the obstacles multiplied. These 
difficulties were scientific, as well

as cultural and religious, given a reti- 
cence or even repugnance towards 
the use of organs from some animals, 
especially pigs. But this ethical reflec- 
tion may have eased the way towards 
social acceptance of the creation of 
the human-animal hybrids mentioned 
above. 
Scientific advances are changing 
the terms of an ethical dilemma. Re- 
search in embryology, for example, 
and the long-term freezing of sperm 
in liquid nitrogen have enabled in vitro 
fertilization of women with the sperm 
of their deceased husbands. Even 15 
years ago, this possibility led women 
to claim this right in the courts. Judges 
in certain States of the USA are fa- 
vourable to such demands, while, in 
France, they have been rejected. 
Scientific progress could also catch 
ethics specialists by surprise by open- 
ing up unimagined possibilities. The 
most striking recent example was the 
cloning of Dolly the sheep, announced 
on 24 February 1997. This was like a 
bolt of lightning, making headlines 
around the globe, from Sweden to 
Brazil, the Arab Emirates to Indone- 
sia. The breakthrough also unleashed 
all kinds of fantasies and speculation. 
Both the scientific community and 
politicians responded quickly, with 
the result that the international com- 
munity now has a series of safeguards 
regarding this practice: The Universal 
Declaration on the Human Genome 
and Human Rights (UNESCO, 1997 
and UN, 1998), the Council of Eu- 
rope's Additional Protocol to the Con- 
vention, on the Prohibition of Cloning 
Human Beings (1998), and the Unit- 
ed Nations Declaration on Human 
Cloning (2005). 
These scientific shockwaves and 
their technological applications bring 
a host of benefits, shaking our certain- 
ties as well as our uncertainties. But 
we must take care that the concept 
of “human dignity’, the cornerstone 
of the intangibility and inalienability of 
human rights, is not fractured.

### 189820: UNESCO and bioethics

1994   
THE COURIE
R: 
NESCO 
and bioethics 
by Georges B. Kutukdjian 
Scientific research on the human genome, 
= and especially on gene therapy and the 
chagnosis of genetic diseases, has far-reaching 
implications tor the lives of all of us—children, 
men and women alike. It is a field holding our 
immense prospects for man’s self-reansformation 
and it will, in the long run, require societies to 
make certain choices, As a result, it is giving 
r1s¢ to anxieties that may in some cases be jus- 
tified but are more often irrational. 
These anxieties lie behind the effort many 
countries are now making to look into the eth- 
ical framework of such research. Legislation 1s 
starting to be adopted to define limits for med- 
ical practice and some types of research, in order 
to ensure that human dignity will be respected 
Two points must be stressed, however. In the 
first place, the type of legislation differs signif- 
icantly from one country to another and we do 
not have any common vardstick to judge it by. 
Secondly, it does not exist everywhere in the 
world, but only in some of the industrial coun- 
tries. Elsewhere, there are are sull a number of 
grey arcas surrounding research and experi- 
mentation. 
It is for all these reasons that the Director 
General of UNESCO decided to set up an Inter- 
    
A CODE FOR LIVING 
national Bioethics Committee and invited Ms. 
Noélle Lenoir, a member of the Constitutional 
Council of the French Republic, to preside over 
its deliberations. 
The Committee met for the first rime in Sep- 
tember 1993 and commenced its work by jdenti- 
fving three priority themes. These are genetic 
screening and testing, the therapeutic applications 
of genetics research, and population generics. 
Genetic testing 
Should genetic screening be made compulsory 
for so-called “risk™ populations or should it 
simply be made available to them? Should it be 
introduced into premarital examinations or be 
included in prenatal diagnosis? Should it be car- 
ried out before gamete donation or the implan- 
tation of embrvos fertilized in vitro? 
At the outset, a distinction must be made 
between two kinds of genetic tests. Tests in the 
first category are used to identity a particular 
gene which is virtually certain to bring on a 
hereditary disease. Those in the second cate: 
gory show whether or not a person has a pre 
dispositi on to certain diseases and thus reveal sit 
uations involving varving degrees of probability. 
Depending on ‘the environment and sundry 
other factors, about some of which little 1s 
known, the outward symptoms of a disease may 
appear in its carly Stages Or mayv emerge only 
later, and the disease wself may vary in seventy. 
A genetic mutation may become more dominant 
and grow worse from generation to generation, 
On the other hand, the tendency for genetic 
damage to occur may be reversed. In short, the 
same defect ina person's genotype (genetic con- 
stitution) may take different forms in his or her 
phenotype (the physical constitution as it inter- 
acts with the environment). 
This influence of the environment on the 
form a genetic mutation may take brings into 
play the concept of the responsibility of indi- 
viduals towards themselves and their families 
and the responsiblity of citizens towards the 
community. Preventive medicine could there- 
fore be said to go hand-in-hand with predictive 
medicine. 
Should people be told that there is a proba- 
bility that they will eventually develop Hunt- 
ington’s chorea, for example, and transmit it to 
their offspring? Should their close or distant

Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde: the temptation 
[ knew well that I risked death; for any drug that so 
potently controlled and shook the very fortress of iden- 
tity might, by the least scruple of an overdose or at the 
least inopportunity in the moment of exhibition, utterly 
blot out that immaterial tabernacle which I looked to it 
to change. But the temptation of a discovery so singular 
and profound at last overcame the suggestions of alarm, 
... | compounded the elements, watched them boil and 
smoke together in the glass, and when the ebullition had 
subsided, with a strong glow of courage, drank off the 
potion. 
The most racking pangs succeeded: a grinding in the 
bones, deadly nausea, and a horror of the spirit that 
cannot be exceeded at the hour of birth or death. Then 
these agonies began swiftly to subside, and I came to 
myself as if out of a great sickness. There was something 
strange in my sensations, something indescribably new, 
and, from its very novelty, incredibly sweet. I felt 
younger, lighter, happier in body; within I was conscious 
of a heady recklessness, a current of disordered sensual 
images running like a mill race in my fancy, a solution of 
the bonds of obligation, an unknown but not an inno- 
cent freedom of the soul. I knew myself, at the first 
breath of this new life, to be more wicked, tenfold more 
wicked, sold a slave to my original evil: and the thought, 
in that moment, braced and delighted me like wine.

and insurance companies? Can a company’s 
medical service insist on being given the results 
of genetic testing? 
Since genetic testing may extend over several 
generations and involve varying numbers of 
individuals, questions about the storage and 
confidentiality of the data are bound to arise 
sooner or later. How long should genetic data be 
kept and how can its confidentiality be guaran- 
teed? Who should be empowered to divulge or 
withhold information which often involves 
whole families? 
Similarly, if people can choose to know what 
their genetic future will be, can they also choose 
not to know? Should they or should they not be 
compelled to take account of the results of 
genetic testing? 
In this regard, it is important that people 
should be freely able to exercise their discretion. 
Information that is liable to change their whole 
lives and force added od he on them 
should not expose them to any form of dis- 
crimination. Genetic testing should not prompt 
the authorities to adopt repressive policies 
leading to a restriction of individual freedoms. 
Another ethical issue connected with genetic 
testing is bound up with the need to ensure that 
all countries, including the least advanced ones, 
reap benefit from them, so that they too can 
join the fight against hereditary diseases. 
Therapeutic applications 
The first question that has to be raised relates to 
the pre-implantation diagnosis performed on 
artificially fertilized embryos which, in view of 
its greater simplicity and lower cost, is likely to 
replace gene therapy in cases of rare genetic dis- 
eases. This involves a choice that is already 
framed in ethical terms. 
The second question is whether the work 
currently being done is not liable to become nar- 
rowly focused on looking for the genes that 
account for people’s behaviour—their sexuality, 
for example—their talents and abilities, or even 
their “deviances”. This could lead to a kind of 
genetic reductionism whereby people would be 
defined exclusively in terms of their genome, or 
to a situation in which some individuals or groups 
of individuals might be stigmatized by society, 
ostracized or even eliminated. This would be 
tantamount to adopting eugenic policies. 
There are other problems. We know, for 
example, that through agriculture, gene therapy 
could bring about radical changes in public 
health. A diet of genetically modified plants 
could become a regular form of treatment, a 
sort of oral “vaccine” given in repeated doses. 
However, the in vivo reproduction of these 
plant species would be liable to give rise to new 
recombined organisms that could become vec- 
tors for diseases. In such an eventuality, what 
kind of preventive measures and legislation 
should be instituted? 
The same applies, mutatis mutandis, wo the use 
of human genes for the development of transgenic

### 189820: UNESCO and bioethics

  
animals. What limits should be set on the supply 
of human genetic material? Should it be reserved 
solely for therapeutic purposes, say for xeno- 
rafts, and its use for any other purpose, such as 
I improving livestock, be ruled out? 
We have to accept that the issue of transge- 
nesis applied to the human species now has to be 
faced. Reports of germ-line therapy experiments 
on embryonic cells or spermatozoa have recently 
been published in scientific journals. 
As a result of the rapid strides being made by 
genetic engineering, it is now possible to store 
gametes and germ cells in “banks” for possible 
future use, such as for autografts. This practice 
is now regarded as acceptable, under certain 
conditions, for young cancer patients who have 
to undergo X-ray treatment or chemotherapy 
and who wish to preserve their chances of later 
conceiving children by in vitro fertilization 
techniques. With the exception of these medical 
cases, the storage of gametes and germ cells 
poses the problem of the storage of human 
products generally, as well as that of storage 
methods and the criteria governing access to 
such “banks”. 
Lastly, careful thought has to be given to 
the best ways of protecting the intellectual prop- 
erty of researchers whose inventions have indus- 
trial or commercial applications. Should such 
protection be regarded as akin to copyright? 
How is 1t possible to regulate access to genetic 
data banks and their possible industrial or com- 
mercial uses? 
First, steps must be taken to secure the free 
and informed consent of population groups 
participating in major surveys on population 
genetics. The scientific aims and objectives of the 
surveys should be clearly explained to them. 
The results of these surveys should not be 
detrimental to those who participate, nor should 
they lead to discrimination against them. Nor 
 
The UNESCO Courier 2008 N°10 
should they be allowed to lead to the establish- 
ment of a genetic pseudo-classification of the 
population groups involved. 
These results should also be communicated to 
the individuals and population groups concerned. 
Access to genetic data banks where the infor- 
mation is stored, the processing of this informa- 
ion and its use should be rigorously defined. 
The human genome project 
Deciphering the totality of genetic information 
on the human race is an ambitious project which 
calls for international co-operation, The ensuing 
progress will help to prevent and treat genetic 
diseases which are incurable today. Ir will also 
make a significant contribution to understanding 
the structure and the functions of the genetic 
system and individual development, as well as 
the “natural history” of DNA. 
Such fundamental knowledge of human beings 
clearly raises ethical, social and legal problems, and 
consequently it 1s not surprising that Unesco 
attaches very great importance to it. The human 
genome project has a place among UNESCO's 
activities because of UNESCO's ethical mission 
and its competence in the fields of education, sci- 
ence and culture. UNESCO offers an ideal envi- 
ronment for multidisciplinary debates on the dif- 
ferent aspects of study of the human genome. 
UNESCO is thus fully involved in this project. 
By organizing or encouraging meetings, holding 
workshops, helping to finance training pro- 
grammes and awarding short-term scholarships, 
UNESCO is seeking to do three things: to 
encourage international co-operation and co- 
ordination, to stimulate debate on the many 
repercussions of the human genome project, 
and to promote the participation of countries of 
the South and East. The sharing of knowledge 
between North and South, East and West 1s, 
after all, an ethical imperative in itself. m

of the United States, in Nairobi, Kenya, in 2006. 
The industrialized nations have 
allocated more than a trillion 
dollars to avert a global finan- 
cial melt down. Some African 
leaders say that a fraction of 
that amount, less than two per 
cent, would have solved most 
of Africa’s problems? What's 
your reaction to that comment? 
It is easy for the African leader- 
ship to complain about the rest of 
the world for not taking care of the 
problems of Africa. | think that with 
a lot of respect, the African lead- 
ership is largely to be blamed for 
the current ills of the continent. It 
is largely them who have allowed 
their resources to be exploited and 
their people to be exploited. 
The UNESCO Courier 2008 N°10 
It is interesting to see that the gov- 
ernments in industrialized western 
countries are trying to save their 
banks and financial institutions. 
But | am unable to understand the 
fact that many of these banks were 
not regulated. So, this shows that 
if you do not regulate businesses, 
it is possible for greed, for selfish- 
ness to creep in. This is what we 
see in many developing countries 
where banks and businesses from 
outside come and exploit the lo- 
cal resources, without sharing the 
profits equitably and without wor- 
rying about the environment. 
Why didn't we regulate them? 
Why didn't we control them? It is 
up to the African leadership to pro-

over the lack of global attention 
towards environmental issues. 
Do you think awareness 
on environmental issues 
and global warming 
has improved now? 
No doubt, there has been a great 
improvement in the last ten years or 
so. People are realizing that envi- 
ronment is indeed a source of con- 
flict especially in areas like sharing 
of water resources and land. 
Now with the problem of climate 
change, we are realizing that cli- 
mate is very central to our living in 
peace with each other. Yes, there 
has been a great awareness, but 
still there is a lot needs to be done. 
For example, problems relating 
to stopping green house gas 
emissions.

Are you happy with promises 
made by industrialized nations 
in terms of carbon emission 
cuts? 
Yes, | think it is encouraging to 
see that the industrialized coun- 
tries. Who have largely been re- 
sponsible for greenhouse gas 
emissions are now working togeth- 
er and willing to take action and 
encouraging the rest of the world 
to do the same. | am particularly 
happy that they are now talking 
about the need to preserve world’s 
forests. | sincerely hope that they 
will help those governments which 
have large amounts of forests to 
maintain, like the Amazon forests 
in Brazil, the rainforests in Congo 
and the forests in Southeast Asia. 
| hope they will include the preser- 
vation of forests in their main envi- 
ronmental agenda. 
Did winning the Nobel Peace 
Prize encourage you to be even 
more active? 
The Nobel Prize has really brought 
a lot of attention to our work focus- 
ing on promoting environmental 
awareness, human rights and good 
governance in Africa. | have been 
invited by a large number of people 
who want to share the message 
and who also want me to see their 
work. So, | have been travelling 
around the world talking about the 
need to take care of the environ- 
ment and about good governance.

We have not enjoyed peace or 
enjoyed good management of our 
natural resources, and therefore 
have had massive poverty and a 
lot of conflict. So, during my trav- 
els around the globe | have been 
trying to explain the link between 
taking care of the environment and 
peace. 
How do see the role of women 
in politics in Africa? Are they 
finally emerging out in a male- 
dominated territory? 
There has been a great improve- 
ment. There has been a sustained 
campaign by women to raise 
awareness of the need for them to 
be given opportunities beyond the 
traditional roles into various pro- 
fessions. We see as doctors, we 
see them as lawyers and we see 
them as teachers. Of course being 
a politician, being part of a govern- 
ment with the ability to serve the 
people is such an important sym- 
bolic position for women. 
There is no doubt that women like 
Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, the presi- 
dent of Liberia, have done so well 
in Africa. It was nice to see an Af- 
rican woman elected as president 
of a country. It is important to rec- 
ognize that we are now benefiting 
from many years of struggle by 
women in Africa. | think women 
can give more accountable and 
responsible governance and show 
respect for human rights.

{ THR COURIER; 
1999 \ 
WANGARI MUTA MAATHAL: 
KENYA'S GREEN MILITANT 
INTERVIEW BY ETHIRAJAN ANBARASAN, UNESCO COURIER JOURNALIST. 
A noted environmental and pro-democracy 
activist hopes the next millennium will see 
a new African leadership that puts people first. 
WANGARI MUTA MAATHAI 
The UNESCO Courier 2008 N°10 
 
You once said that the quality of the environment cannot be 
improved unless and until the living conditions of ordinary 
people are improved. Could you enlarge on this? 
If you want to save the environment you should protect the people first, 
because human beings are part of biological diversity. And if we can't 
protect our own species, what's the point of protecting tree species? 
It sometimes looks as if poor people are destroying the environment. 
But they are so preoccupied with their survival that they are not con- 
cerned about the long-term damage they are doing to the environment 
simply to meet their most basic needs. 
So it is ironic that the poor people who depend on the environment are 
also partly responsible for its destruction. That's why | insist that the 
living conditions of the poor must be improved if we really want to save 
our environment. 
For example, in certain regions of Kenya, women walk for miles to get 
firewood from the forests, as there are no trees left nearby. When fuel 
is in short supply, women have to walk further and further to find it. Hot 
meals are served less frequently, nutrition suffers, and hunger increas- 
es. If these women had enough resources they would not be depleting 
valuable forest. 
What is at stake in the forests of Kenya and East Africa today? 
Since the beginning of this century, there has been a clear tendency to 
cut down indigenous forests and to replace them with exotic species 
for commercial exploitation. We've now become more aware of what 
this involves and have realized that it was wrong to cut down indig- 
enous forests, thereby destroying our rich biological diversity. But much 
damage has already been done.

“The act of planting 
trees conveys 
a simple message. 
It suggests that 
at the very least you 
can plant a tree and 
improve your 
habitat. It increases 
people’s awareness 
that they can take 
control of their 
environment, 
which is the first 
step toward greater 
participation 
in society’ 
The UNESCO Courier 2008 N°10 
When the Green Belt Movement (see box page 47) started its campaign in 
1977 to plant trees, Kenya had about 2.9 per cent of forest cover. Today the 
forested area has further dwindled to around two per cent. We are losing 
more trees than we are planting. 
The other important issue is that the East African environment is very vulner- 
able. We are very close to the Sahara desert, and experts have been warning 
that the desert could expand southwards like a flood if we keep on felling 
trees indiscriminately, since trees prevent soil erosion caused by rain and 
wind. By clearing remaining patches of forests we are in essence creating 
many micro-Sahara deserts. We can already see evidence of this phenom- 
enon. 
We hold civic education seminars for rural people, especially farmers, as part 
of campaigns to raise public awareness about environmental issues. If you 
were to ask a hundred farmers how many of them remember a spring or a 
stream that has dried up in their lifetime, almost 30 of them would raise their 
hands. 
What has your Green Belt Movement (GBM) achieved 
and in particular to what extent has it prevented 
environmental degradation in Kenya? 
The most notable achievement of the GBM in my view has been in raising 
environmental awareness among ordinary citizens, especially rural people. 
Different groups of people now realize that the environment is a concern for 
everybody and not simply a concern for the government. It is partly because 
of this awareness that we are now able to reach out to decision-makers in the 
government. Ordinary citizens are challenging them to protect the environ- 
ment. 
Secondly, the GBM introduced the idea of environmental conservation 
through trees because trees meet many basic needs of rural communities. 
We started out by planting seven trees in a small park in Nairobi in 1977. At 
that time we had no tree nursery, no staff and no funds, only a conviction that 
ordinary country people had a role to play in solving environmental problems. 
We went on from there and now we have planted over 20 million trees all over 
Kenya. 
The act of planting trees conveys a simple message. It suggests that at the 
very least you can plant a tree and improve your habitat. It increases people's 
awareness that they can take control of their environment, which is the first 
step toward greater participation in society. Since the trees we have planted 
are visible, they are the greatest ambassadors for our movement. 
Despite the Rio earth summit of 1992 and the Kyoto climate summit 
in 1997, there has been no significant progress in environmental 
protection programmes and campaigns at a global level. Why? 
Unfortunately, for many world leaders development still means extensive farm- 
ing of cash crops, expensive hydroelectric dams, hotels, supermarkets, and 
luxury items, which plunder human and natural resources. This is short-sighted 
and does not meet people's basic needs—for adequate food, clean water, 
shelter, local clinics, information and freedom. 
As a result of this craze for so-called development, environmental protection 
has taken a back seat. The problem is that the people who are responsible for 
much of the destruction of the environment are precisely those who should be 
providing leadership in environmental protection campaigns. But they are not 
doing so. 
Also, political power now is wielded by those who have business interests 
and close links with multinational corporations (MNCs). The only aim of these 
MNCs is to make profit at the expense of the environment and people. 
We also know that many world political leaders are persuaded by MNCs not 
to pay attention to declarations made in international environmental confer- 
ences. | strongly believe that as citizens we should refuse to be at the mercy 
of these corporations. Corporations can be extremely merciless, as they have 
no human face.. 
You started your career as an academic. Later you became an envi- 
ronmentalist, and now you are called a pro-democracy activist. How 
would you describe your evolution in the last 25 years? 
Few environmentalists today are worried about the welfare of bees, butterflies 
and trees alone. They know that it is not possible to keep the environment 
pure if you have a government that does not control polluting industries and 
deforestation. 
In Kenya, for example, real estate developers have been allowed to go into the

In a country where women play a mar- 
ginal role in political and social affairs, 
59-year-old Wangari Muta Maathai’s 
achievements stand out as an exception. 
A biologist, she was the first woman 
from East Africa to receive a doctor- 
ate, to become a professor and chair 
a department-all at the University of 
Nairobi. 
Maathai began to be active in the

in 1976 and it was through the Council 
that she launched a tree-planting project 
called “Save the Land Harambee” (a 
Swahili word meaning let’s all pull 
together). The project was renamed the 
Green Belt Movement (GBM) in 1977. 
The GBM initiated programmes to 
promote and protect biodiversity, to 
protect the soil, to create jobs especially 
in rural areas, to give women a positive 
image in the community and to assert 
their leadership qualities. 
The overall aim of the GBM has been 
to create public awareness of the need 
to protect the environment through 
tree planting and sustainable manage- 
ment. Nearly 80 per cent of the 20 
million trees planted by the GBM have 
survived. At present the GBM has over 
3,000 nurseries, giving job opportuni- 
ties to about 80,000 people, most of 
them rural women. 
In 1986 the GBM established a Pan- 
African Green Belt Network and has 
organized workshops and training 
programmes on environmental aware- 
ness for scores of individuals from 
other African countries. This has led to 
the adoption of Green Belt methods in 
Tanzania, Uganda, Malawi, Lesotho, 
Ethiopia, and Zimbabwe. 
Maathai, who is a member of the UN 
Secretary General's Advisory Board on 
Disarmament, has won 14 international 
awards, including the prestigious Right 
Livelihood Award. She won the award, 
presented by a Swedish foundation 
and often referred to as an Alterna- 
tive Nobel Prize, in recognition of her 
“contributions to the well-being of 
humankind”. 
In a country where single-party rule 
prevailed for decades, Maathai has 
been teargassed and severely beaten by 
police during demonstrations to protect 
Kenya's forests. 
“The government thinks that by threat- 
ening me and bashing me they can 
silence me,” says Maathai. “But I have 
an elephant’s skin. And somebody must 
raise their voice.” 
Maathai, a mother of three children, is 
currently involved in a struggle to save 
the 2,500-acre Karura forests, north- 
west of Nairobi, where the government 
wants to build housing complexes.

middle of indigenous forests and build expensive houses. As concerned 
individuals we should oppose that. When you start intervening at that 
level, you find yourself in direct confrontation with policy-makers and you 
start to be called an activist. 
| was teaching at the University of Nairobi in the 1970s, when | felt that 
the academic rights of women professors were not being respected 
because they were women. | became an activist at the university, insisting 
that | wanted my rights as an academic. 
Meanwhile, | found myself confronted by other issues that were directly 
related to my work but were not clear to me at the outset, like human 
rights. This directly led me to another area, governance. As a result | was 
drafted into the pro-democracy campaign. 
| realized in the 1970s that in a young democracy like ours it was very 
easy for leaders to become dictators. As this happened they started using 
national resources as though they were their personal property. | realized 
that the constitution had given them powers to misuse official machinery. 
So | became involved in the pro-democracy movement and pressed for 
constitutional reforms and political space to ensure freedom of thought 
and expression. We cannot live with a political system that kills creativity 
and produces cowardly people. 
With your academic qualifications you could have lived a com- 
fortable life in the U.S. or elsewhere in the West. But you decided 
to come back and settle down in Kenya. In the last 25 years, you 
have been verbally abused, threatened, beaten, put behind bars 
and on many occasions forbidden to leave the country. Have you 
ever regretted returning to Kenya and becoming an activist? 
| did not deliberately decide to become an activist, but | have never regret- 
ted the fact that | decided to stay here and to contribute to the develop- 
ment of this country and my region. | know that | have made a little differ- 
ence. 
Many people come up to me and tell me that my work has inspired them. 
This gives me great satisfaction because in the earlier days, especially 
during the dictatorship, it was difficult to speak. 
Until a few years ago, people used to come up to me in the street and 
whisper “| am with you and | am praying for you.’ They were so scared of 
being identified with me that they did not want to be heard. | know a lot of 
people were afraid of talking to me and being seen with me because they 
might be punished. 
| have been a greater positive force by staying here and going through 
trials and tribulations than if | had gone to other countries. It would have 
been very different to live in the West and say my country should do this 
and that. By being here | encourage many more people. 
Do you think you were subjected to virulent attacks and abuses 
because you questioned men’s decisions? 
Our men think African women should be dependent and submissive, defi- 
nitely not better than their husbands. There is no doubt that at first many 
people opposed me because | am a woman and resented the idea that | 
had strong opinions. 
| know that at times men in positions of influence, including President 
Daniel Arap Moi, ridiculed me. At one time Members of Parliament ac- 
cused me and ridiculed me for being a divorced woman. | have felt that 
deep inside they were hoping that by calling into question my woman- 
hood | would be subdued. Later they realized they were wrong. 
In 1989, for example, we had a big confrontation with the authorities 
when we were fighting to save Uhuru Park in Nairobi. | argued that it 
would be ridiculous to destroy this beautiful park in the centre of the city 
and replace it with a multi-storeyed complex. 
Uhuru Park was the only place in Nairobi where people could spend time 
with their families outdoors. The park was a wonderful place for people to 
go because it was a place where no one bothered them. 
When | launched the campaign opposing the construction of the “Park- 
monster”, as the project later came to be known, | was ridiculed and ac- 
cused of not understanding development. | didn’t study development but | 
do know that you need space in a city. Fortunately other non-governmen- 
tal organizations and thousands of ordinary people joined our protests 
and finally the park was saved. 
The government, which wanted to destroy that park, has since declared it 
a national heritage. That's wonderful. They could have done that without 
fighting and without ridiculing me.

IN MADAGASCAR, A WOMAN PLANTS RICE IN THE ASHES OF A FELLED AREA OF FOREST, 
HOME TO THE LAST SURVIVORS OF A LEMUR SPECIES. 
What made you stand in the presidential elections in 19977? Despite your popularity, why didn’t you win a sizeable 
number of votes? 
| decided to stand for election for several reasons. In 1992, when a multi-party system was legalized in Kenya for 
the first time, | tried very hard with other political groups to unite the opposition, but in vain. When there were many 
opposition candidates running for the presidency, | withdrew from the campaign. 
As expected, the opposition lost those elections and everybody now accepts that the campaign we launched for 
them to unite was right. We wanted to form a government of national unity within the opposition in 1992. This is 
exactly what they are now clamouring for. 
In the 1997 general elections, my idea was to persuade the opposition to unite and field a strong candidate from 
one ethnic community against the ruling Kenya African National Union (KANU).1 But | was called a tribalist by 
some opposition groups for proposing that idea. When all my efforts to unite the opposition failed, | decided to run 
for president. 
But during the campaign | also came to realize that in this country it is very difficult to get elected without money. | 
didn’t have money. | realized that it doesn’t matter how good you are, how honest you are and how pro-democratic 
you are, if you don’t have money to give to the voter you won't get elected. So | lost. 
All this gave me a new experience. Now | can speak as an insider. | also realized that people here are not yet ready 
for democracy and we need a lot of civic education and political consciousness. People here are still controlled by 
ethnicity and vote along ethnic lines. The ethnic question became a very important issue during the last elections. 
Despite having enormous natural resources Africa still lags behind other continents in terms 
of development and growth. Why is this? 
Poor leadership, without any doubt. This generation of African leaders will go down in history as a very irrespon- 
sible one that has brought Africa to its knees. During the past three decades, Africa has suffered from a lack of 
visionary and altruistic leaders committed to the welfare of their people. 
There are historical reasons for this. Just before independence was granted to many African countries, young Afri- 
cans were promoted by colonial rulers to positions until then unoccupied by the local people and were trained to 
take over power from the colonial administration. 
The new black administrators and burgeoning elites enjoyed the same economic and social life-styles and privileg- 
es that the imperial administrators enjoyed. The only difference between the two in terms of the objectives for the 
country was the colour of their skin. 
In the process, the African leaders abandoned their people, and in order to maintain their hold on power they did 
exactly what the colonial system was doing, namely to pit one community against another. This internal conflict 
continued for decades in many African countries, draining their scarce resources. 
So what we need is to improve our leadership. If we don't there is no hope, because history teaches us that if you 
cannot protect what is your own somebody will come and take it. If our people cannot protect themselves they will 
continue to be exploited. Their resources will continue to be exploited. 
It is also true that Western powers, especially the former colonial masters of this region, have continued to exploit 
Africa and have continued to work very closely with these dictators and irresponsible leaders. That is why we are 
now deep in debt, which we cannot repay. 
Africa also needs assistance from international governments to improve its economic standing. For example, most 
foreign aid to Africa comes in the form of curative social welfare programmes such as famine relief, food aid, popu- 
lation control programmes, refugee camps, peace-keeping forces and humanitarian missions. 
At the same time, hardly any resources are available for sustainable human development programmes such as 
functional education and training, development of infrastructure, food production and promotion of entrepreneur- 
ship. There are no funds for the development of cultural and social programmes which would empower people and 
release their creative energy. 
| am hoping that in the new millennium a new leadership will emerge in Africa, and | hope this new leadership will 
show more concern for the people and utilize the continent's resources to help Africans get out of poverty

Separation from the mainland about 
60 million years ago, this territory 
oproximately the size of France 
has developed unique flora and 
auna. The lemur, a small primate, is 
the most typical example of Mada- 
gascar's unparalleled levels of en- 
demism. 
Although there are a greater num- 
ber of species in general in main- 
land Africa, the island holds more 
endemic species and taxa. For 
example, you can find seven of 
the eight existing Baobab trees in 
Madagascar, and only one in all of 
Africa. Of the 101 native terrestrial 
species recorded on the island, 
nearly all are endemic. This is why 
Madagascar is considered one of 
the most significant biodiversity 
“hotspots” and among the top six 
of the world's 18 mega-diversity

Sadly, large numbers of unusual 
animals and plants have been dis-

The Indri, largest lemur in Madagascar, is an endangered species. 
appearing since the arrival of man, 
only 1,500 years ago. Already one- 
fifth of all known lemur species 
have gone extinct. The International 
Union for Conservation of Nature 
and Natural Resources Red List 
(2007), cites 355 species of ani- 
mals and 281 of plants as threat- 
ened with extinction in Madagas- 
car, while much about the country’s 
biodiversity remains unknown. New 
discoveries are still being made, 
such as the two new species of 
Mouse Lemurs identified in the 
northeastern Makira region. 
Multiple threats 
LSpecies are endangered for a va- 
riety of reasons. Habitat loss due 
to deforestation is the overarching 
threat for the majestic Madagascar 
Fish-Eagle, for instance. Economic 
pressures — people vying for food 
and other resources — are behind 
the problem, as in the case of fish 
populations being exhausted by 
30 
over-fishing. From 1980 to 2005 
the quantity of fish caught sky- 
rocketed from 53 to 8,500 tons. 
Several turtle species are critically 
endangered because of the exotic 
pet trade, and Ploughshare Tor- 
toises are now down to about 600 
remaining in the wild, according 
to the British NGO Durrell. Other 
animals are the victims of cultural 
superstitions, like the harmless, 
nocturnal Aye-Aye lemur, routinely 
killed because it is considered to 
be a portent of evil. 
Climate change is an additional 
threat that looms over wildlife pop- 
ulations, according to studies. One 
study (Dunham, Biological Conser- 
vation) on the endangered Milne 
Edwards Sifaka lemur found that 
a 50% population decline within 
three generations was very likely, 
and that the effects of changing 
global cycles, like El Nino South- 
ern Oscillations, may pose a further 
threat. Fecundity of lemurs was over

Developing solutions 
For Madagascar to escape what

the right formula for balancing con- 
servation and growth. The popula- 
tion — estimated at 18 million and 
expected to double by 2025 - is 
turning to its environment for suste-

Rice paddies are taking the place 
of forests, and already this has led to 
the extinction of species, including 
the elephant bird and pygmy hippo- 
potamus. ““If the same speed of cur- 
rent deforestation continues, within 
the next 25 years there [will be] no 
forest left in Madagascar, asserts 
Jonah Ratsimbazafy, a Malagasy pri- 
matologist who works with the Dur- 
rell Wildlife Conservation Trust. Since 
2003, however, when Madagascar's 
President Marc Ravalomanana prom- 
ised to triple the surface of protected 
areas, a decrease in the annual rate 
of forest destruction has already 
been reported (Conservation Inter- 
national), from 0.8% in the 1990s to 
0.1% today. 
  
There are about 130 chameleon species in Madagascar, 
half of them endemic. 
The UNESCO Courier 2008 N°10 31 
Many organizations such as Con- 
servation International, the World 
Wildlife Fund, Durrell and Mitsinjo 
(a local NGO based in Andosibe) 
are hard at work to avert disaster, 
and are also involving local popu- 
lations. Durrell, for instance, has 
signed an agreement whereby in- 
habitants pledge to safeguard the 
forest in exchange for the construc- 
tion of infrastructure and schools. 
While preserving natural resources 
remains a priority, NGOs are coop- 
erating with the locals to include 
their needs for improving quality 
of life. Eco-tourism provides jobs 
and though not without impact on 
the environment, it can, if managed 
properly, offer sustainable econom- 
ic benefits. 
Environmental issues remain a 
subject of discord, a fact taken into 
consideration by the government 
when making decisions regarding 
natural resource usage. Ranamofa- 
na National Park is an example of 
a protected area seen as a triumph 
amongst conservationists, but an 
economic disaster for locals. The 
rainforest is accessible for eco- 
tourism purposes only, which is 
resented by the locals as they are 
forbidden to use the park's natural 
resources. Walking inside the park, 
one is thankful to see elusive crea- 
tures like the critically endangered 
Golden Bamboo Lemur in its natu- 
ral habitat. Once outside the park, 
however, one easily feels sorrow for 
the people living in dire poverty. 
To preserve Madagascar's culture 
and natural beauty, there must be a 
development plan that takes both 
people and wildlife into consider- 
ation. The people and wild places 
of Madagascar are so enchanting, 
losing them forever would be a trag- 
edy. The island's biodiversity crisis, 
moreover, should set off alarms for 
the rest of the world to maintain vig- 
lance over other ecosystems. Our 
collective survival is at stake.

wild and domesticated, and alarm at their 
widespread destruction, that eight years 
ago led the International Union for Con- 
servation of Nature and Natural Resources 
(TUCN) and the World Wildlife Fund 
(WWF) to produce the World Conservation 
Strategy (see the Unesco Courier, May 
1980). This has three primary objectives: 
(1) to maintain viable stocks of all animal 
and plant species (it must be all because we 
still know so little about the value of the 
great majority of species: it is only quite 
recently, for instance, that the value in the 
treatment of cancer of a little-known Mada- 
gascar plant, the periwinkle Catharanthus, 
was discovered): 
(2) to maintain large enough stocks of 
species already known to be of value to 
man, so that they can be cropped. harvested 
or otherwise enjoyed indefinitely: and 
(3) to maintain pure air and water and 
fertile soil, 
Though all three aims of the World Con- 
servation Strategy are plain common sense, 
they are widely disregarded by both govern- 
ments and individuals, thanks to our pre- 
sent social and institutional arrangements. 
How are we to overcome this widespread 
neglect and manage the world’s animals and 
plants, both wild and domesticated, on a 
sustainable basis. i.c. so that they continue 
to be available for our benefit? 
The UNESCO Courier 2008 N°10 
The two main threats to species, which 
have led to the extinction of some and se- 
vere reductions in the numbers of many 
others. are overexploitation and habitat 
destruction, 
Historically. overexploitation, both legal 
and illegal, has been the more important. In 
the last century, overhunting exterminated 
the passenger pigeon in North America and 
nearly exterminated the bison there too. In 
the present century, systematic poaching 
for their horns and ivory has almost exter- 
minated the black rhinoceros and severely 
reduced elephant numbers in Africa, 
Moreover, overhunting of the great 
whales, especially in the southern oceans. 
despite the cfforts of the International 
Whaling Commission (IWC) set up espe- 
cially to prevent this, has reduced almost all 
stocks throughout the world to the level of 
commercial extinction, Since their hunting 
is now forbidden, the whaling industry has 
in effect committed suicide. Marine fish 
stocks throughout the world have also been 
steadily overexploited so that many of them 
are no longer available for human consump- 
tion. The world’s last great reservoir of 
plentiful fish stocks is now in the Antarctic 
and sub-Antarctic. Will current efforts 
through the Antarctic Treaty be too little 
and too late to save these too?

hectares will remain outside national parks 
and other protected areas by the end of the 
century, now only a dozen years away.

factor. Chemical wastes from both industry

The African northern white rhino (Cer- 
atotherium simum cottoni) lives under threat 
of extinction because of hunting for its horn. 
By the early 1980s it was estimated that its 
numbers had been reduced to fewer than 700 
animals. The biggest population of northern 
white rhinos today live in Zaire's 500,000- 
hectare Garamba National Park, which in 
1980 was included on Unesco’s World Herit- 
age List as a natural property of outstanding 
universal value, 
The Arabian oryx (Oryx leucoryx) was once 
common throughout the desert areas of Ara- 
bia, Syria and Mesopotamia. By 1972 it had 
become extinct in the wild through intensive 
hunting. Fortunately, before that happened, 
a few had been captured and used to build 
up breeding herds. In 1980 the oryx was 
successfully reintroduced in Oman,

air, soil and water. The most dramatic effect 
i$ that of acid rain, due to a “chemical soup™ 
still not fully understood, which is des- 
troying both forests and freshwater fish 
stocks throughout the northern hemi- 
sphere. 
To stop overexploitation, we must reg- 
ulate cropping and harvesting. This calls for 
both licensing of individual hunters, some- 
times with specific bag limits, and quotas for 
commercial harvesting. The problem is al- 
ways enforcement, as witness the umversal 
existence and increasing audacity of 
poachers even in national parks, and the 
dismal record of the whaling industry. 
The accurate estimation of stock size is 
another problem. The IWC has its own 
scientific committee to do this for whales, 
and [UCN has set up a Conservation Moni- 
toring Centre (CMC), to create an accurate 
data-base for all species. The Centre is also 
responsible for the Red Data Books, brain- 
child of Sir Peter Scott, which summarize 
key information about endangered species. 
So far the chief weapon against habitat 
destruction has been the creation of nation- 
al parks, nature reserves, wildlife refuges or 
other protected areas. But can enough land 
be set aside in this way in the next ten or 
twelve vears to save the many thousands of 
species that today face certain extinction 
from rainforest loss alone? The number of 
species so threatened may indeed be mil 
lions, if the latest estimates of the world’s 
invertebrate species—an incredible 30 mil- 
hon—are correct.

the responsibility for saving species are 
IUCN and WWF. They share a headquar-

the International Council for Bird Preserva- 
tion (ICBP), headquartered in the United 
Kingdom and currently grant-aided by

IUCN operates through six commissions 
of scientific experts: the Species Survival 
Commission (SSC), the one mainly con- 
cerned with species conservation, works 
through a network of more than 90 special- 
ist groups, to which nearly 2,000 zoologists 
and botanists all over the world voluntanly 
contribute their expertise. Among the most 
active groups are those covering African 
elephants and rhinos, antelopes, cats, pri- 
mates, crocodiles, marine turtles, dragon- 
flies and orchids. The Trade Group is re- 
sponsible for IUCN's input into the impor- 
tant Convention on International Trade in 
Endangered Species (CITES). The SSC 
also has close links with ICBP, which has its 
own series of working groups, such as those 
for parrots, flamingos and bustards. 
Two other relevant IUCN commissions 
are those for Ecology (general habitat prob- 
lems, pollution) and National Parks and 
Protected Areas. Unesco’s Man and the 
Biosphere Programme also plays a vital

Society of London, the Frankfurt Zoologic- 
al Society of the Federal Republic of Ger- 
many and the New York Zoological 
Society. 
Unlike IUCN, WWF and ICBP operate 
largely through national organizations or 
sections, ICBP's network being consider- 
ably the more extensive world-wide, WWF 
is primarily a fund-raising body, and in- 
creasingly tends to raise funds for its own 
programmes and projects. 
So where do we go from here? How can 
this array of national and international 
bodies help to achieve our aim, the con- 
servation and sustainable use (which in- 
cludes non-consumptive uses, such as bird- 
watching and whale-watching) of animal 
and plant species? 
More, and usually a lot more, of what we 
are already doing scems to be the answer, 
First we must set aside and manage properly 
adequate areas of habitat, This includes 
ensuring that big development projects take 
account of the need to conserve genetic 
resources, 
We must also ensure that all wild popula- 
tons that are harvested are not over- 
harvested. This means both cracking down 
on poaching everywhere, not just in pro- 
tected areas, and properly enforcing the 
CITES trade regulations. Finally, and most 
important of all, we must carry with us not 
only the decision-makers, politicians and 
administrators, but also villagers and 
townsfolk all over the world. Without their 
goodwill, and their realization of where 
their own real long-term interests lie, every- 
thing will be lost. Ww 
RICHARD FITTER, British naturalist and au- 
thor, has been a member of the Species Survival 
Commission of the International Union for Con- 
servation of Nature and Natural Resources 
(IUCN) for 24 years and is currently chairman of

The green turtle (Chelonia mydas), found in Pp 
tropical seas, is overexploited for its meat, 
its eggs and its shell, used to make tourist 
souvenirs. Turtle populations have been sev- 
erely reduced and in some regions have dis- 
appeared completely. Right, baby green

billions of dollars annually, has been 
responsible for massive declines in the 
numbers of many species of animals and 
plants, The scale of over-exploitation for 
trade aroused such concern that an interna- 
tional treaty was drawn up in 1973 to protect 
wildlife against such over-exploitation and to 
prevent international trade from threatening 
species with extinction, 
Known as CITES, the Convention on In- 
ternational Trade in Endangered Species of 
Wild Fauna and Flora entered into force on | 
July 1975 and now has 96 member countries. 
Enforcement of CITES is the responsibility of 
these countries, which are required to ban 
commercial trade in an agreed list of cur- 
rently endangered species and regulate and 
monitor trade in others that might become 
endangered. Governments are also required 
to submit reports, including trade records, 
to the CITES Secretariat in Switzerland. 
The wildlife trade involves a wide variety of 
species, both as live specimens and as pro- 
ducts, Millions of live animals and plants are 
shipped around the world each year to supply 
the pet trade and to meet the demand for 
T HE international wildlife trade, worth ornamental plants. Furskins, leather, ivory 
and articles manufactured from these mate- 
rials are all traded in large quantities. 
CITES provides protection for species in 
two main categories, “most endangered spe- 
cies”, and “other species at serious risk". 
Among those listed in the former category are 
all apes, lemurs, the giant panda, many 
South American monkeys, great whales, 
cheetah, leopards, tigers, Asian elephants, 
all rhinoceroses, many birds of prey. 
cranes, pheasants and parrots, all sea turtles, 
some crocodiles and lizards, and giant 
salamanders. 
Included in the second category are species 
which might become endangered if trade in 
them is not controlled and monitored. Inter- 
national trade in these species is permitted 
with proper documentation issued by the gov- 
ernment of the exporting country. The list 
includes all animal species in the following 
groups which are not already in the first 
category: primates, cats, otters, whales, dol- 
phins and porpoises, birds of prey, tortoises, 
and crocodiles, as well as many other species 
such as the African elephant, fur seals and 
birds of paradise.

felt a certain enthusiasm, too, for the 
rightness of her thinking, and the im- 
pression that UNESCO, in its long 
career, has never really departed 
from its primary objective. 
Ruth Benedict's observation seems 
self-evident: culture is a learning pro- 
cess. “The cultural patterns which 
men in all societies invent for them-

selves and transmit down the gen- 
erations have in each community a 
considerable degree of consistency 
within themselves [...] and have to 
be taught anew to each generation, 
she wrote, before adding that rec- 
ognition of “cultural differences” — a 
term that, a few decades later was 
replaced by ‘cultural diversity’ — “can 
promote international co-operation” 
and cannot be blamed for “the chaos 
of the world", as some would have us 
believe, even today. 
And, she concluded, “if we are to 
accept the different ideals and alter- 
native social arrangements of the na- 
tions of the world, those of us who 
are professionally concerned with 
childhood education have a task 
which extends far beyond problems

of curriculum revision. We need the 
clear-sightedness and the tolerance 
which will help us to appreciate the 
different kinds of strengths which dif- 
ferent nations could contribute to the 
world in which we desire to live! 
Sixty years later, have we succeed- 
ed in guaranteeing a quality educa- 
tion for all, which respects cultural 
diversity and serves as a lever for sus- 
tainable development, conceived and 
promoted by the people themselves? 
Education 
as a vector for cultural 
transmission 
lt is widely accepted today that a 
quality education is, above all, one 
that can respond to local learning 
needs. Experts also agree that litera- 
cy is most successful when acquired 
in the mother tongue. 
But in many countries — especially 
the former colonies — formal educa- 
tion systems are still struggling to 
become vectors for cultural transmis- 
sion at the service of social develop- 
ment. Similarly, a number of “devel- 
opment failures” can undoubtedly be 
explained by a failure to take account 
of the cultural dimension of develop- 
ment, alongside its economic, social 
and environmental aspects. 
Even so, the critical and emancipat- 
ing potential inherent in any educa- 
tional process remains unchanged, 
despite what some detractors of 
“culturally adapted” education might 
think. As Ruth Benedict so rightly 
pointed out, the transmission of 
culture from generation to genera- 
tion enables it continually to evolve 
and recreate itself. “No matter how

eration, the personnel of France and 
Holland changes completely. One

tivated in them which fit them to be

When African heads of State met 
in Khartoum in January 2006 for the 
sixth African Union Summit, they 
came to much the same conclusion. 
Convinced that “cultural values and 
heritages should provide the basis 
for education at all levels,’ they recog- 
nised “the importance of African lan- 
guages as media of instruction and 
vehicles of culture; emphasizing the 
“indisputable interface between cul- 
ture and education and the role of 
both culture and education in sustain- 
able socio-economic development’

Finally, they urged their governments 
“to create the fora for regular con- 
sultations and streamlining culture in 
education and education in culture, 
in particular through the rebuilding 
of African educational systems” This 
should be music to Ruth Benedict's 
ears in her final resting place ... 
Culture: both source 
and estuary 
For the first time in 2001, UNESCO 
recognized cultural diversity as the 
“common heritage of humanity”. 
UNESCO's adoption in 2003 of 
the Convention for the Safeguarding 
of the Intangible Cultural Heritage 
would also be dear to her, as it is an- 
other step towards this recognition 
of the unbreakable bond between 
culture and education, and raises 
many hopes. Far from aiming to keep 
moribund cultural heritage alive as a 
museum piece, this Convention en- 
  
The Sosso-Bala cultural space (Guinea), proclaimed 
a masterpiece of humanity by UNESCO. 
The UNESCO Courier 2008 N°10 37 
ables peoples to perpetuate a heri- 
tage conveying values and meaning, 
by permanently recreating it, provid- 
ing them with a sense of identity and 
continuity. 
It is true that many elements of in- 
tangible cultural heritage are endan- 
gered today. All too often they are 
assimilated to unnecessary or ob- 
solete traditions, with no part in the 
development of the nation and, within 
the processes of globalisation, they 
are of no interest to young people, 
whose attention is legitimately turned 
outwards, towards the world. It is 
clear that current educational sys- 
tems must carry some of the respon- 
sibility for this attitude of the younger 
generations. 
The 2003 Convention provides an 
opportunity for educational systems 
not only to open themselves to cul- 
tural diversity on a national level, but 
also to discover and appreciate the 
extraordinary wealth of intangible 
cultural heritage in the world as 
a whole. It insists on “the need to 
build greater awareness, especially 
among the younger generations, of 
the importance of the intangible cul- 
tural heritage and of its safeguard- 
ing,” as a factor for bringing human 
beings closer together, for exchange 
and greater understanding. In other 
words, it can contribute to silencing 
the archaic but tenacious thesis of 
the clash of civilisations. 
By inviting States to raise aware- 
ness of young people regarding the 
values of their cultural heritage, nota- 
bly through education, it is as if this 
Convention came about to put things 
back in their place. It reminds us that 
culture is both the source and the es- 
tuary of all development processes, 
with education its preferred vector of 
transmission. This reminder comes 
at the right time, and, we hope, will 
ensure that the diversity of cultures is 
not relegated to the archives of mem- 
ory, but remains a living reality, full of 
meaning and creativity for the future 
of humanity as a whole.

Unesco has in this statement of policy stated 
its belief that recognition of cultural differences 
among civilized nations can promote internation- 
al co-operation. Usually, in most nations. the 
attitude has been quite different. Usually people 
who hope for world co-operation ar€ the very 
ones who minimize fundamental 
differences among the nations ; 
they emphasize the similarity 
of human virtues and motives, 
uo matter what the differences 
in cultural practice and behav- 
iour. 
Those who oppose interna-

opinion personally distasteful. 
Students of comparative cultures have usually 
been trained by acquainting them with a wide 
range of the diversities of possible social insti- 
tutions which are traditional in various parts 
of the world and then sending them to fairly 
small simple communities very different from 
their own. These are often pre- 
literate tribes. 
Because the social arrange- 
ments and motivations of 
these communities are entirely 
unfamiliar to the student, he 
has to observe and record every 
detail of their lives in order 
to understand them. The “cult- tional co-operation, on the other

| Enquiry Sent To Member

The first step in the improve-; 
ment of textbooks and teaching 
materials as aids te peace is to 
discover what has already been 
done and what is being done to 
achieve this end. Consequently, 
the Secretariat has been assemb- 
ling and studying the materials 
on textbook improvement pro- 
duced in varfous parts of the 
world 
An enquiry has been sent to 
Member States to discover what is 
being done at the present time 
and what is planned for the fu- 
ture. In addition to informational 
material, lists are be'ng prepared 
of individuals and groups inter 
ested in the improvement of 
textbooks and teaching materials. 
These resources will enable Unesco 
to serve as a clearing house in 
th's field. 
Another aspect of Unesco’s pro- 
gramme is the preparation of 
principles and criteria and a 
model plan for the analysis and 
improvement of textbooks and 
teaching materials. The model 
plan, including the princ’ples and 
criteria, is now in draft form and 
will be submitted to Member 
States in the near future. It will 
be accompanied by a recommenda- 
tion that Member States study 
the treatment of agenc'es of 
international co-operation in their 
own textbooks. At a later time 
these reports will be studied at 
Unesco House and a summary

NewZealand 
Offers 
Fellowships 
The New Zealand (overn-. 
ment has set aside a sum of 
£15,000 to finance a fellowship 
scheme to provide study op- 
portunities in New Zealana jor 
an initial group of jive Far 
Eastern studznts. 
The first grants being made 
available include two in China 
and one each to the Philip- 
pines, Malay and Burma. 
In approving the scheme, 
the New Zealand Minister of 
Education declared that the 
needs of these Far Eastern 
countries “for the kinds of 
training and experience avai- 
lable in New Zealand are more 
urgent than those of the war- 
devastated countries of Eu 
rope”. It was pointed out, 
however, that the programme 
will be extended to other 
Eastern countries and event- 
ually to European nations. 
The governmeznts of the 
countries to which the fellow 
ships are being Offered are 
being informed about the jacil- 
ities which New Zealand can 
offer. Final selection of the 
candidates will be made by the 
Fellowships Committee set up 
by the New Zealand National 
Commission for Unesco. 
Fields of study suggested for 
the first five candidates in- 
clude: agriculture, rural life 
and education, Maori educa 
tion, education in the Island 
Territories, social services, 
mining, engineering, teacher 
training and the technical as- 
pects of broadcasting. 
At the conclusion of the fel 
lowship, each student will be 
expected to return to his home 
country to put his training 
and experience to use in re- 
construction work. The grants 
will be generaily of six months’ 
duration and will allow for 
£ 450 including travel ex- 
penses within New Zealand.       
must accept the virtues and 
practices with which they are 
familiar in their own culture 
before it will be possible to 
make a peaceful world. This is 
an attitude which is centuries 
old. It has not made for world 
peace. 
Now Unesco proposes that 
social scientists should take the 
lead in promoting a new and 
different attitude, studying na- 
tional differences even down 
into such fundamental things 
as the way we bring up our 
children. 
Unesco is saying, in effect. 
that it is part of wisdom to 
recognize that human commun- 
- ities are not all alike, and is 
suggesting that we cultivate psychologically heal- 
thy attitudes also among the nations and that by 
greater study and understanding of national diff- 
erences we could promote a more co-operative 
world. 
Ne Nation Can Live To Itself Alone 
This programme of Unesco’s is especially neces- 
sary ir the world today. No nation any longer 
lives by itself alone. In the modern world it is 
absolutely necessary that each nation take some 
attitude about other modes of life than its own. 
. Any study of national differences is a study 
of comparative cultures. This is the special field 
of social anthropology, and it is necessary to 
stress a few of the principal conclusions which 
have been derived from such study 
The way of life among people, the virtues. 
they exhibit and the aggressiveness they show is 
learned in their experience in that social order; 
it is not racial ; it 1s not instinctive. in the sense 
that human beings everywhere are born with a 
set of instincts which account for their aggres- 
sions and their cruelties. 
The cultural patterns which men in all societies 
invent for themselves and transmit down the 
generations have in each community a cons:der- 
able degree of consistency within them- 
selves. These patterns of learned behaviour have 
to be taught anew to each generation. No matter 
how distinctively French France seems over 
several centuries, or how Dutch Holland seems, 
with each new generation the personnel of 
France and Holland changes completely. One 
generation dies and another 1s torn. In the way 
in which parents handle their babies, in the 
way in which older children treat younger 
children, in the way in which teachers reward 
and punish their pupils, emotions are selected 
and cultivated in them which fit them to be 
members of their own community and nation. 
Cultural study of national differences is just 
beginning to be accepted. The members of this

The Jate Ruth Benedict 
Genetic Study 
of National Character 
This Unesco seminar is de- 
voted to the study of childhood 
education, and Dr. Chen's study 
group has as its subject “Child- 
hood Education in Different 
Nations”. In line with Unesco’s 
programme, seminar members 
are interpreting their assign- 
ment, not merely as the child's 
school education, but as his 
home and community exper- 
iences as well, “the ways in 
which the young are trained to 
become responsible participants 
in their national culture”. 
It is hoped that some of the 
delegates to this seminar will 
be stimulated by the discussions here, (0 go back 
to their countries te record observations and mn- 
terviews, and thus contribute to mutual knowledge 
among nations of the world. R 
Genetic study of different cultures is: precisely 
the study of how each generation is conditioned 
* to become responsible participants”. in the way 
of life which 1s traditional in the community 
into which it is born. The technical development 
of such study is possible today because of 
knowledge that has been‘ acauired in several 
sister sciences, all of which are volved in such 
genetic studies: (a) the study of the physical 
maturation of the child; (b) medical studies in 
the field of psychosomatics; (c) psychiatry. 
Training The Young 
As Responsible Participants 
- In National Cultures 
Aided by the development of these related 
sciences, the time is ripe for the study of the 
“ways in which the young are trained to become 
responsible participants in national cultures”. Ii 
is only necessary to collect the observations and 
record the attitudes upon which understanding 
can be based. 
Thus when all European naticns have madi¢ 
systematic records of observations of child life 
and have gathered data from pareats and from 
educators can adequate understanding I 
obtained of the ways in which children in differ 
ent areas of Europe are fitted “to become res 
ponsible participants” in national life. 
If we are to accept the different ideals an 
alternative social arrangements of the nations o 
the world, those of us who are professionall: 
concerned with childhood education have s tas 
which extends far beyond problems of curricu 
lum revision. We need the clear-sightedness ane 
the tolerance which will help us to appreciat 
the different kinds of strengths which differen 
nations could contribute to the world in whicl 
we desire to live.

hese are “extraordinary times”. In just 
matter of weeks, several western 
ountries have pulled together multi- 
illion dollar bailout packages for their 
ling banking systems thus keeping 
e wheels of the global economy in 
motion. Without question, political 
leaders needed to act decisively and 
act now or risk catastrophic financial 
implications. 
The same determination, says the 
2009 Education for All Global Moni- 
toring Report, Overcoming inequal- 
ity: why governance matters, is now 
needed to tackle an equally serious 
and no less urgent development chal- 
lenge — that of ensuring social justice, 
fairness and the right to educational 
opportunity for the world's most vul- 
nerable population groups. 
“When financial systems fail, the 
consequences are highly visible and 
governments act, UNESCO's Direc- 
tor General Koichiro Maatsura has 
commented. Yet “...when education

systems fail the consequences are... 
no less real. Unequal opportunities 
for education fuel poverty, hunger, 
and child mortality and reduce pros- 
pects for economic growth! 
The extent of global inequality in 
educational opportunity should give 
policymakers pause for thought. 
While over a third of children in rich 
countries complete university, a 
much smaller share even completes 
primary education in much of sub-Sa- 
haran Africa (with just 5% reaching 
university level). One in three children 
in developing countries (193 million 
in total) reach primary school age suf- 
fering from malnutrition and impaired 
cognitive growth — a figure that rises 
to over 40% in parts of South Asia. 
National disparities mirror global 
inequalities. In Peru and the Philip- 
pines, children in the poorest 20% 
of the population receive 5 years 
less education than their peers from 
the wealthiest families. But wealth is 
39 
not the only marker for marginaliza- 
tion and disadvantage. Other deeply 
entrenched barriers result from geo- 
graphical accessibility to schooling, 
gender, language and ethnicity. In 
Senegal, for example, children in ur- 
ban areas are twice as likely to be in 
school as those living in rural areas. 
The picture, of course, is not all 
bleak and this year's Global Monitor- 
ing Report highlights some impres- 
sive national and regional perfor- 
mances. Tanzania and Ethiopia have 
both reduced the number of children 
out of school by over 3 million. In a 
region marked by deep gender in- 
equalities, Bangladesh now has as 
many girls as boys reaching second- 
ary school. In Latin America, several 
countries are enrolling and keeping 
more children in schools through in- 
novative cash transfer programmes 
for the poorest households, with pay- 
ments made conditional on school 
attendance and health visits. Most 
remarkably, Mexico's Oportunidades 
programme, one of the countries 
largest education schemes, is now 
being pilot tested in the New York 
City school system. 
Nevertheless, the overall figures 
speak for themselves. An estimated 
75 million children of primary school 
age world wide are currently out of 
school with partial projections sug- 
gesting that at least 29 million chil- 
dren will still be missing out on their 
right to an education in 2015. A fur- 
ther 776 million adults, or 16% of the 
world’s population, lack even basic 
literacy skills. Two-thirds of these are 
women. 
Without concerted and sustained 
action, the international development 
target of universal primary education 
by 2015 will move even further out 
of reach.

Oportunidades is the prinicipal anti-poverty program

That is why the way in which educa- 
tion systems are managed, policies 
developed, and resources allocated 
is in the political spotlight. ‘Good

call, with decentralisation, the de- 
volution of authority to parents and 
schools, and choice and competi- 
tion recurrent themes in policy de- 
bates. 
More of the same 
will simply not do. 
But according to the Global Moni- 
toring Report, governance reforms 
all too often fail to tackle the in- 
equalities that are holding back 
education for all. 
Wide sweeping education reforms 
that give but a passing nod to lo- 
cal context, institutional capacity 
requirements and equity-related is- 
sues are not reaching the levels of 
impact desired. In fact the evidence

practice frequently encouraged by 
the development community, will 
not lead to long term improvements 
in areas such as education resource 
allocation, school management and 
teacher recruitment. 
A perfect example relates to re- 
forms surrounding the decentraliza- 
tion of national education systems 
in developing countries. In the 
1990s, such reforms undoubtedly 
brought education planning closer 
to school communities around the 
world. However at a time when 
many countries were coping with 
a massive expansion in education 
provision, financial decentralisa- 
tion left different regions with even 
less resources to fund learning re- 
sources, school maintenance and 
the teaching profession. And while 
central and local governments sup- 
ported the idea of devolving author- 
ity and decision-making to parents, 
schools and communities, especial- 
ly those lacking voice in the poorest 
communities, they did not back this 
drive with measures to facilitate real 
participation. 
Neither have competition, and its 
corollary - choice, proved to be the 
antidote for the failings of public ed- 
ucation systems as many expected. 
Even in the United States, where 
the private and civil society sectors 
have been contracted into the man- 
agement of public school systems 
under various forms of public-pri- 
vate partnership, the gains to effi- 
ciency and education performance 
from the creation of charter schools, 
40 
for example, have been uneven and 
remain inconclusive. 
In this year's Global Monitoring 
Report, we especially take the aid 
community to task for its ‘collective 
failure’ to deliver on development 
commitments. Many country’s aid 
disbursements to basic education 
have stagnated since 2004. While 
countries such as the Netherlands 
and the United Kingdom still allo- 
cate over 60% of their aid to basic 
education in low-income countries, 
France allocates only 12% of its to- 
tal development assistance in this 
area and Germany just 7%. Multilat- 
eral aid frameworks for supporting 
Education for All, such as the EFA 
Fast Track Initiative, are also failing 
to meet expectations. Inadequate 
donor support means that coun- 
tries with approved plans will face 
an FTI shortfall of US$2.2 billion by 
2010. 
The circumstances into which 
children are born, their gender, the 
wealth of their parents, their lan- 
guage or the colour of their skin 
should no longer define their edu- 
cational opportunities and ending 
inequality’s ‘lottery by birth’ is per- 
haps one the greatest global chal- 
lenges of the 21st century. The 
challenge is one that concerns all 
nations, since in a globalized world 
poverty and suffering do not re- 
main confined within borders, but 
spill over in the form of conflict for 
scarce resources, mass migration 
and environmental degradation. 
The response to the financial crisis 
demonstrates what governments 
can accomplish when faced with 
“extraordinary times". But if they 
carry on failing to tackle deep and 
persistent inequalities in educa- 
tion, targets set by the international 
community will be missed — in some 
cases by spectacular margins. 
Most importantly, millions of chil- 
dren around the world will continue 
to be consigned to lives of poverty 
and diminished opportunity.

EDUCATION IN THE ARAB STATES: 
COULD DO BETTER 
School attendance in the Arab Region has progressed over the past decade 
but nearly six million children still do not have access to education in that region 
which is still marked by strong disparities 
According to the 2009 Education for All Monitoring 
Report published by UNESCO last month, low enrol- 
ment remains a major problem in the region. In 2006, 
5.7 million children were out of school, i.e. 2 million fewer 
than in 1999. Nearly one quarter of them wee in Iraq and 
Yemen. 
Nonetheless, Yemenhasachievedconsiderableprogress 
regarding school enrolment which increased by 20% 
between 1999 and 2006. Similar increases have been 
achieved in Djibouti, Mauritania and Morocco. Over the 
same year, enrollment decreased significantly in Oman, 
where it dropped by 8%, and in the Palestinian Auto- 
nomous Territories with a decline of 22%. 
The progressive decline of school atendance in higher 
grades also poses a problem. In 2008, enrolment in pri- 
mary education was at 84%, but only at 59% in second- 
ary education (i.e. a slow progression of 7% since 1999) 
41 
and a mere 22% at the university level. 
The greatest disparity however concerns gender. Accor- 
ding to the UNESCO Raport, the region has made 
progress towards parity in both primary and secondary 
education. But in 20086, parity had only been reached in 
the United Arab Emirates, Jordan and Qatar. In Egypt, 
on the other hand, girls account 95% of out-of-school 
children. Girls make up a regional average of 61% of out- 
of-school children. 
There are also considerabel disparities in investments. 
In 2006, Tunisia, for example, devoted 7.7% of its GDP 
to education, while the figure for the United Arab Emir- 
ates is of 1.6%. 
The Arab States devote a larger proportion of their 
overall public expenditure to education than other re- 
gions and this has enabled them to raise school atten- 
dance ratios and prolong education.

¥ the third century of the Heglira, around the year 
840, a genial moralist with a taste for writing on every 
imaginable subject included in his Book of Exposition 
and Demonstration the portraits of various teachers in 
Baghdad, Kufa and Basra. He carefully .differentiated 
between the eminent lecturers in law and theology. whose 
discourses enthralled distinguished gatherings and the 
mass of enthusiastic and half-starved schoolteachers who 
grappled with hordes of children. 
In the days of Abu Utman al-Djahiz there was indeed 
no lack of schoolieachers in Islam. Long before the con- 
quests and conversions there were undoubtedly many more 
teachers in the Middle East than there were in Europe, 
teaching in Greek at one place, In Syriac at another, in 
Hebrew, Persian or Arabic. By propagating “the world’s 
most read book”, the new faith had stimulated the spirit 
of study and research. Every mosque had its school 
where the Koranic adage was inculcated: “He unto whom 
wisdom is given, he truly hath received abundant good” 
or that injunction of the Prophet's to “Seek knowledge 
even if it be in China, since the seeking of knowledge 
is obligatory upon every Mosier, man or woman.” 
Until the fifteenth century, elementary education-—the 
teaching of reading, writing and arithmetic which was 
virtually general in the towns—advanced side-by-side 
with the vast expansion of Arab science and culfure. 
The latter, even when they had declined in the Iraqi and 
Syrian towns from which they emerged, continued to 
grow stronger and to proliferate in Central Asia, in Sicily 
and above all in Europe and North Africa.

Khaldoun ended a chapter on the “philosophic sciences” 
with the statement, “We are told that in the country of 
the Franks and in the land of Rome and the neighbouring 
regions of the northern coasts (of the Mediterranean) the 
philosophic sciences are greatly in favour, their princi- 
ples have been revived, there are many groups to teach 
them and there is an increasing number eager to study 
them...” Thus, the European Renaissance was proclaim- 
ed in Tunis at the very moment when Arab culture and 
education were about to enter a long period of stagnation 
and even decline. Economic depression, loss of inde- 
pendence, cities sunk in apathy... 
During four centuries, the cultivated population was 
barely able to do more than maintain the tongue of the 
masters of the Golden Age. Their doctrines and their 
works together with thelr universities became lifeless. 
Elementary education itself became rarer and rarer and 
less and less valued. The small schools survived, gene- 
rally kept going by religious foundations: under the direc- 
tion of ignorant teachers, themselves a vestige of the 
Middle Ages persisting into the nineteenth century, the 
children—the male children—were given an education 
consisting of learning verses from the Koran by heart. 
Nevertheless, the Arab revival had begun in the nine- 
teenth century. Among the Christians of Lebanon and 
the Moslems of Egypt, thinkers, statesmen and poets shook 
the dust from the old books. Reformers introduced the 
disciplines and sometimes the methods of “modern” edu- 
cation into the ancient universities of A) Azhar, of Cairo 
and of Zaitouna in Tunisia. Thenceforward the move- 
ment developed with astonishing speed. Under the 
influence of the new universities in Cairo, Alexandria 
and Beirut, education at all levels has recovered the vigour

and prestige which had been lost for so long. Taking 
the Arab countries as a whole, it might seem the solution 
of fundamental educational problems was already in sight. 
Unfortunately, the Arab world is enormous and progress 
has been made at a very different rate in the various 
countries. Some Arab countries lag a good many years 
behind others. In more than one country, hampering 
tensions arise from the co-existence, and some times rival- 
ry, of the traditional schools which are almost wholly 
religious in nature and the undenominational schools mo- 
delled on the Western pattern. By way of compensa- 
tion, in other countries State education-—which, inci- 
dentally, provides for regular religious instruction—has 
been able to develop unhindered. But in all Arab 
countries alike, from the derricks of Kuwait to the 
pasture lands of the Atlas region, from the banks of the 
Orontes to the banks of the Upper Nile, the longing for 
education merges with the will to play a part in the Arab 
renaissance. 
HERE are grounds for believing that this longing 
will be fulfilled. Indeed, taking all Arab coun- 
tries together, one finds that the annual rate of 
increase in the number of children at school is about 10 
per cent, whereas the annual rate of increase in the 
number of children of school age is only about 3 or 4 per 
cent. Plainly, the race between population increase and 
the schools Is going to be won by the schools if this trend 
persists. 
In those Arab States which are the best-equipped and 
the best situated in the field of education there are still 
thousands of children for whom there is no accommo- 
dation in the schools or whose villages still have no 
school worthy of the name. In yet other countries which 
were only recently able to begin their educational pro- 
gramme, the majority of the children must still be left 
to one side or temporarily forgotten about. 
Sometimes it is necessary to consider emergency mea- 
sures, the mobilization of available resources in order to 
speed up education; sometimes the authorities are above 
all preoccupied with reforming the content and the tools 
of teaching where these are thought inadequate to the 
needs of the young and of the community as a whole. 
Almost invariably they are forced back to the same great 
problem: how to train the masters who are now needed 
and who will be needed even more tomorrow? 
N enquiry recently carried out by Unesco In 
10 Arab countries (1) reveals that the most 
urgent problem today is the “shortage of qua- 
lified teachers.” 
In the Lebanon, for example, authorities describe the 
present situation as “panticulanly disturbing.” In the 
whole country there is only one primary teacher-training 
school and one secondary teacher-training school which 
43 
graduated 97 student-teachers in 1958. But the number 
of posts which must be filled yearly is approximately 
two hundred in respect of primary education and seventy 
In respect of secondary education. In these circumstances, 
it is hardly surprising that a number of classes are 
conducted by teachers whose qualifications are more than 
a little vague. “About half the teachers in the primary 
schools have had a training inferior to a complete secon- 
dary course.” 
The situation is perhaps most serious in Libya where 
in order to press ahead as rapidly as possible, it was 
found necessary to employ a number of primary school 
teachers who themselves had received little more than 
primary education. In Morocco where at least 2.000 new

LEARNING MEANS LIGHT (Cont'd from page 17) 
TEN MILLION CHILDREN IN SEARCH OF TEACHERS 
teachers a year will be needed, the number of student- 
teachers supplied by the teacher-training schools in 1959 
was only 500. In the Sudan, the qualifications required 
of a teacher consist of the diploma granted after the 
first secondary stage plus two years’ professional training; 
but the eight institutions which offer this training are far 
from able to meet current needs since in 1959 they were 
only able to supply the country’s 2,000 schools with 832 
men teachers and 177 women teachers. 
In this regard, one of the great difficulties confronting 
Ministers of Education is to find teachers for provinces 
located far from the capital and, for that matter, for 
villages which are close to the capital but which are 
still only villages. The young teachers, accustomed to 
the comfort of their colleges and the luxury of the big 
cities, find lving conditions in the villages intolerable. 
Attempts have occasionally been made to solve this prob- 
lem by providing the teacher with living quarters in 
accordance with his needs and tastes; but the cost of 
building such quarters, even the least luxurious models, 
is far beyond the financial means of almost all the Arab 
countries. 
Payment of indemnities provides no solution since the 
teacher, however modest his requirements, is often unable 
to find a reasonable house in the area to which he has 
been appointed. The solution generally envisaged in these 
countries today is one which has been repeatedly sug- 
gested in other regions: namely, that the ministers 
concerned should recruit more young student-teachers in 
these less aftractive areas in the hope that, once their 
training has been completed, they will want to return 
there to teach. 
It is, however, in the secondary and vocational schools 
and in the trade training centres that the shortage of 
teachers seems especially critical. In some countries the 
full gravity of the situation is not yet apparent because 
many of these institutions were founded and. are still 
maintained by private groups, religious missions and even 
foreign countries which provide a large proportion of the 
staff and equipment. But with few exceptions, this aid 
does not go far to meet the development which the 
economic progress of these countries requires. 
At the present time, 16 in 2 hundred pupils go to secon- 
dary schools and the proportion in secondary vocational 
schools is 2 per cent. Thus, without noticeably increasing 
these proportions, it is estimated that secondary institu- 
Arab refugee boy is among thousands learning 
trades in UNRWA-UNESCO school workshops. 
  
20 
The UNESCO Courier 2008 N°10 
tions in Irag in 1965 will have 235,000 pupils, necessi- 
tating the training of 850 teachers per year. As things 
stand, however, the total number of those graduating from 
Iraq’s teacher-training colleges barely exceeds 300. 
In Libya, a number of secondary schoolteachers come 
from neighbouring countries. In the Syrian province of 
the United Arab Republic there is small hope of meeting 
the needs of secondary Institutions for several years to 
come, even though private education at this level copes 
with a large proportion of pupils. Egypt, in fact, would 
seem to be the only country at present able to meet the 
growing needs of secondary education.

Even Egypt is short of qualified teachers for certain 
subjects, especially mathematics, science and modern lan- 
guages. Other countries make the same complaint and 
generally with still more cause. It may be possible to 
find first rate students in literature, history or even law, 
philosophy or social sciences who, despite their hopes 
for a different career, nevertheless become satisfactory 
teachers of grammar, literature or the social sciences. 
Their friends who have specialized in science, in English 
or French, are not likely to accept to become teachers. 
Unless they have a positive vocation for teaching, they 
are more likely to take one of the infinitely more attrac- 
tive jobs offered by industry or commerce or the civil 
service, 
In countries, in the process of development which still 
lack top-level men for the most important sectors of the 
national economy, it is useless to count on university 
students turning {0 teaching as a last resort. The teacher- 
training colleges must provide a full training for teachers 
specializing in the different disciplines where neither 
incompetents nor enthusiastic amateurs can be accepted. 
Additionally, the State—and public opinion—must treat 
teaching with the seriousness it deserves. A bad book- 
keeper is dismissed; but too often an incompetent teacher, 
whose shortcomings may have serious conseguences, is 
allowed to retain his position. From another point of 
view it would be wholly unreasonable fo argue that 
teaching is such a noble profession that anyone who 
abandons it for a better paid job is blameworthy. 
“Material advantages” cannot anywhere be neglected 
for long. And in every one of the Arab States, the 
Minister of Education realizes regretfully that teachers 
44

are inadequately paid. The salary scales may be the 
same, by and large, as those for other civil servants with 
comparable gualifications and senicrity; but authorities 
recognize that the teacher’s modest pay is no longer pro- 
portionate to the amount of work and the professional 
qualities which are required of him. His salary is a 
hangover from the days when it was thought fitting 
that the schoolmaster should be as poor as he was 
respectable. 
Some governments openly deplore the fact that the 
salaries paid to young teachers are “slightly lower” than 
those paid to other civil servants. Nobody in these 
States denies that the remuneration received by teachers 
is inadequate; on the conirary, there is & real desire fo 
improve their living conditions ; but so far the burdens 
involved in expanding education have made it impossible 
for most of the States to change things. 
Over recent years, the educational authorities in almost 
all the Arab countries have outlined their aims in docu- 
ments which have been as carefully thought over and 
drawn up as the constitution of a new republic. Despite 
significant variations in regard to one or another aspect 
of the various tasks of education, all agree as to the basic 
objective: to equip the child to play a full part in the 
political and economic life of his country. 
Most of these lands regard themselves as new countries, 
in spite of the antiguity of their traditions. They know 
that they are in the midst of an evolutionary process. 
The citizens of tomorrow are expected to make their 
country stronger, more prosperous, better qualified to play 
a useful role in international life. 
It may be asked whether the education provided in 
primary and secondary schools is linked with ang, indeed, 
actually assists the achievement of this ambition. 
No educator on earth can be completely sure that the

programmes which he recommends or is called on to 
follow are in every way ideally adapted to pupils’ needs, 
especially to their future needs as citizens and followers 
of a career. To take an example from among the coun- 
tries with which we are dealing it is likely that there is 
some doubt in the United Arab Republic as to the desi- 
rability of sharply divided “streams” which result in 
half of all secondary pupils completing two out of three 
years without learning anything at all of mathematics, 
Physics, chemistry or natural sciences. On the other hand, 
their fellow-students in the scientific stream have nothing 
to do with history or geography. The programmes in 
Libya, which have been drawn up on another basis, devote

20 hours a week during the last year (classical option) 
of a five-year secondary course to the teaching of lan- 
guages, and not one hour to mathematics and science. 
A graver defect which Arab educators have pointed out 
in various educational institutions is the abstract. bookish, 
not to say boring, nature of the teaching. The feaching

methods used in these schools, which vary in number and 
size from country to country, rely overmuch on learning 
by heart in order to pass examinations. Such methods, 
inherited perhaps from the old Mosgue teachers who 
concentrated on memorization, no longer suffice: they run 
the risk of developing memory at the cost of logical 
thinking, critical sense, the spirit of research and indi- 
vidual initiatlve. There are signs that the new generation 
of teachers is being trained in the modern teacher- 
training colleges and universities to use very different 
methods. 
Unfortunately, this defect is reflected in the textbooks 
which are still used by young schoolmasters both for 
thelr own studies and in teaching their pupils. The 
books provided—or forced on-—the pupils are all too often 
sketchy and dogmatic, dry or ponderous and badly illus- 
trated: it is rare indeed that they introduce readers to 
the “joy of reading” and the excitement of discovering 
things for themselves. They supply 2 set of bleak abso- 
lutes which must be humbly imbibed in order fo give 
satisfaction and achieve suceess. 
Additionally, in almost all the Arab States, secondary 
education—and even vocational and technical education— 
has long been synonomous with “Western” education, 
wholly taught in English or French. This is still the 
case In a number of countries where the increased use 
of Arabic in education is the order of the day. This 
is not almeg at the abandonment of the European lan- 
guages currently used ncr even at the systematic substi- 
tution of Arabic as the teaching language at every level 
and for every subject; but the curricula cannot much 
longer remain based solely on those which emerged from 
another culture, another history, a whole series of different 
factors, In another country. 
In certain cases, the subject-matter itself should be 
radically modified—geography and history, for example. 
In other cases, the relative importance given to different 
subjects is in need of revision: the ancient and modern 
literature of a given region or nation cannot be left 
in the background. Finaily, there is no doubt that, 
irrespective of the subjects studied and the final aim of 
schooling, the study of Arabic should be made general 
and deeper.

### 189861: In Arab lands learning means light

LEARNING MEANS LIGHT (Cont'd) 
AN ANCIENT LANGUAGE GETS A MODERN DRESS 
Some countries go further and envisage educational 
reforms which are not only concerned with the national 
language in relation to foreign languages. Education is 
sometimes hindered, to a greater or lesser extent depend- 
ing on the region, by the differences beiween classical 
or “literary” Arabic and the popular language spoken 
by pupils and masters. 
Between a language spoken by very different peoples 
scattered over greaf areas and the classical form of that 
language fixed 1,300 years ago in sacred writings, there 
is an inevitable gulf but It does not seem to hamper 
literary studles in any way. Moreover. the durability of 
the classical language has undoubtedly helped prevent 
the growth of great differences between the various dia- 
lects and thus helped ensure the cohesion of the Arab 
world. 
One proof is the use made after some adaptation, of 
this form of the language 
by press and radio. None 
of this applies, however, 
when the language is used 
to teach and study scientific 
subjects, using that term 
in its widest sense, which 
have only emerged during 
the last two centuries and 
which may even date from 
as recently as yesterday. 
Possibly because there are 
still not enough original 
works on physics, biology, 
chemistry. soclology or poli- 
tical economy in Arabic, 
the Arab student is often 
puzzled by the vocabulary 
and style used in these 
sciences. 
A number of groups or 
institutions have therefore 
taken on the daunting task 
of adapting to the needs 
of modern education the 
language which the old 
masters restricted to poetry, 
prayer and law yet which 
nevertheless once excited 
the greatest admiration 
when used in the fields of 
logic. history. astronomy 
and algebra. The Moroccan 
Minister of Education 
recently announced the 
setting-up of an institute 
for the development of 
Arabic which, in co-operation with experts from various 
countries, would work for the modernization and uni- 
fication of the different forms of spoken Arabic so as to 
provide a single working language for both students 
and researchers, for laboratories and schools, for news- 
papers and scientific journals. 
The educational void which must be filled most urgent- 
ly in most Arab countries js to be found in technical 
and, generally speaking, vocational training. The pro- 
portion of secondary pupils to primary pupils throughout 
the whole region is 16 per cent. This is, relatively, a high 
proportion, even if the secondary education sometimes 
seems unduly rapid. Buf the proportion of pupils enrolled 
in institutions for training technicians in industry, agri- 
culture and commerce amounts to only 2 per cent of all 
school enrolments. 
All States which have laid down development plans to 
ensure that their educational system is geared to their 
economy envisage a very substantial increase in technical 
education at both the post-primary and secondary

levels. Morocco, for instance, expects that 44,000 pri- 
mary school pupils will go on to this type of educa- 
tion In October 1964: eight times as many as in 1959. 
Several years ago the Arab States underlined the neces- 
sity of basing the future of their educational systems on 
rational planning to meet their educational. social and 
economic requirements. Some have already taken the 
necessary steps; others still lack qualified stafl. 
The representatives of nine countries who studied these 
problems at the UNEsco Beirut Conference in February 
1960, devoted themselves in particular to educational 
planning and the relationship between such planning and 
over-all economic and social planning. This conference 
recommended the setting-up, with Unesco assistance, of 
a Centre for the Advanced Training of Senior Personnel 
in the preparation, execution and continual adaptation of 
educational plans, within the framework of overall 
planning. 
This is one of many pro- 
jects which will unqgues- 
tionably help the Arab 
States, and especially the 
poorer ones, to overcome 
the obstacles still hamper- 
ing the carrying out of 
basic reforms. Certain ty- 
pes of limited, temporary 
assistance are decisive if 
provided at the right time 
and in carefully selected 
sectors. This would apply 
to the training centre ; it 
also applies to the techni- 
cal assistance missions 
which the United Nations, 
the Speclalized Agencies 
and particularly UNESCO 
continue to send to most 
of these countries; an- 
other example is the Funda- 
mental Education Centre at 
Sirs-el-Layyan in the Egyp- 
tian delta which has been 
in operafion for seven years 
under the joint patronage 
of the United Arab Republic 
and UNESCO. 
= Mention should also be 
Unesco-Paul Almasy made of the work carried 
out by UNRWA in the refu- 
gee camps of Jordan, Leba- 
non, Syria and Gaza: the 
382 UNRWA-UNESCO 
schools which have gradu- 
ally been developed in recent years have more than 
100,000 pupils. Finally, the aid provided by the UN. Spe- 
clal Fund to secondary technical education and higher 
technical education will have far-reaching effects. 
Whether for planning and statistics, schoo! building or 
teacher training, trade training cenfres or engineering 
institutions, most of these States need assistance if they 
are to overcome the barriers. It would be wrong to 
exaggerate the seriousness of all these difficulties 
(temporary shortage of staff and financial problems) but 
they do prevent advances at the very moment when the 
impulse towards progress is at its height. 
Freed of these initial concerns, the Arab States them- 
selves will do the rest—and the rest, as they well know, 
is gigantic. They will have to rid themselves of the 
thousand and one difficulties which long years of isola- 
tion, poverty and sometimes dependence have placed on 
the road leading to the economic, cultural and intellec- 
tual revival which they are determined to achieve,

Cover of the UNESCO Courier, July-August, 1986. 
A time when everything 
had to be invented 
"Once the war was over, the world opened 
to new ideas. A wave of sagacity shunned 
national borders, extolling the virtues of 
international cooperation and human val- 
ues inspired by the Charter of the United 
Nations and affiliated organisations; said 
René Caloz, Deputy Editor of the Courier 
from 1961 to 1977 and Editor-in-Chief 
from 1977 to 1978. Before joining UNES- 
CO, he had been Paris correspondent for 
the Swiss press since 1946. 
“People of my generation, returning from 
years of disaster, gained new hope and 
reconnected with the future. As a journal- 
ist and war correspondent in Italy, having 
seen the final stages of the bloody con- 
flicts in Europe, | did not hesitate to file

UNESCO's first Paris address), seeking 
out news and interviews with enthusias- 
tic figures, like Jaime Torres Bodet, Jean 
Piaget, Frank Malina and of course, my 
American colleague, Sandy Koffler. 
With only basic resources, Sandy Koffler 
gave his utmost to shape the new pe- 
riodical, and give it impetus and qual- 
ity. ‘UNESCO Courier’ was the name he 
gave to this missive that adhered to the 
essential principles of the Declaration of 
Human Rights. Can there be a more in- 
spiring ensign for a journalist’? 
lt is about 1948. Like many of my col- 
leagues, | admire the Courier, its adoles- 
cence, its restrained success, its promis- 
ing future. And so a firm desire took root 
inside of me, to serve as a journalist like 
Koffler, to breathe a new air, far from the 
accumulation of professional routines that

“Of all the journals published 
by the United Nations 
and its specialised institutions, 
the UNESCO Courier has always 
occupied first place for the number

and old, due to the high quality 
of its articles and illustrations, 
its objectivity and its international 
spirit”, wrote the America journalist, 
Sandy Koffler in 1988. He was the 
Courier’s founder and first 
Editor-in-Chief, from 1948 
to 1950 and 1951 to 1977.

can be found at Link, July 2007). 
Mid-life crisis 
It is 1988. The Courier's existence is 
threatened. Sandy Koffler reacts vigor- 
ously. Here are extracts from his defence: 
“Before imagining radical changes to the 
content and presentation of the UNESCO 
Courier, it should be remembered that the 
periodical has been published monthly for 
40 years (January1948) and, in its cur- 
rent format and appearance, for 36 years 
(1952). [...] The very large number of edi- 
tions published outside of headquarters 
(82) at the initiative of Member states, 
national commissions and private or com- 
mercial enterprises in these countries, is 
evidence of the cultural and educational 
impact that the UNESCO Courier has 
had and continues to have throughout the

world. [...] It is with sadness that 
| learned that the French edition 
of the UNESCO Courier (which 
has the highest circulation of 
all the magazine's editions) has 
lost over half of its subscribers 
since 1981(55%) and that the 
editions published at headquar- 
ters in Spanish and English have 
also seen their figures drop, 
albeit to a lesser extent. Quite 
frankly, | would have been sur- 
prised if that were not the case. 
The UNESCO Courier is a non- 
specialised magazine aimed at a 
wide readership who see it as a 
reflection of UNESCO. If the or- 
ganisation goes through a crisis, 
if its reputation is tarnished by 
certain events (justified or not)) 
the repercussions will be felt 
in the attitude of readers to the 
magazine and, as a result, in the 
rate of subscriptions. [...]" 
The same year, the Martinique- 
born writer, Edouard Glissant 
published a voluminous Cumula- 
tive Index to the magazine, which 
he had directed since 1982 and 
defined in these terms: 
“With its ear tuned to the world, the 
UNESCO Courier forges a lively and re- 
markably well-informed link between the 
sensitivities of different peoples, the con- 
cerns of modern society and a passion for 
knowledge. 
The magazine is careful to defend the 
ideal of justice, which is the honour of hu- 
manity, in all domains of culture, education 
and science. It is also one of the rare pe- 
riodicals to reveal and promote, from one 
horizon to the other, both the wealth of 
individual civilizations and the generalised 
aspiration to share knowledge’

When a wave of freedom washed 
over the world 
Two Egyptians, Bahgat Elnadi and Adel 
Rifaat, (alias Mahmoud Hussein), took 
over the direction of the Courier in Octo- 
ber 1988. They left a decade later. This 
was a turbulent period, which shook the 
old two-power world, and was reflected in 
the contents of the magazine. 
“When we joined the Courier, the Cold 
War was giving way to ‘glasnost) the fall

Bahgat Elnadi and 
of four-handed works, notably Versant sud de la liberté 
(La Découverte, 1989) and 
(Grasset, vol. |, 2005 and vol. ll, 2007). 
  
Under the pseudonym of Mahmoud Hussein, 
del Rifaat published a number 
I-Sira 
of the Berlin wall, the break-up of the So- 
viet Union. A wave of freedom was wash- 
ing over the world, making it possible to 
speak much more freely in the pages of 
the Courier. [...] 
The rationale for the Courier was chang- 
ing. Until then, the magazine had been a 
rare ‘window open on the world) a terri- 
bly partitioned world, where Europe knew 
little about the people and cultures of 
Asia, Africa or Latin America, where the 
capitalist and socialist worlds turned their 
backs on one another. The Courier had 
opened the first cracks in the partitions. It 
was greeted with particular amazement in 
Eastern Europe, where it had often been 
the only non-ideological paper to circulate 
freely. The only breath of fresh arr. 
With the end of the Cold War, the opening 
of frontiers between East and West, and 
between North and South, the fashion for 
TV documentaries and specialised maga- 
zines such as National Geographic and 
Geéo, rendered our ‘monthly window open 
on the world’ obsolete; it was time to do 
something different. 
We redesigned the magazine, attempt- 
48 
ing to present a wide sample 
of cultural sensitivities and 
personal points of view ev- 
ery month, on a theme having 
universal interest. Unrivalled in 
this domain, UNESCO could 
do something original and 
powerful. 
Our predecessors had obvi- 
ously also followed the idea 
of themes with universal in- 
terest — resulting in some 
superb issues — but it had 
been intermittent. We felt that 
something more systematic 
was needed and, above all, 
that there should be no more 
issues devoted to a particular 
civilisation, country or national 
glory [...]" 
The universal language 
of photography 
Up until December 2001, 
the UNESCO Courier was a 
monthly, illustrated magazine, 
printed on paper and published 
in some thirty languages. An 
American, Ariane Bailey, was 
the magazine's picture editor from 1977. 
She recalls a time when photography oc- 
cupied 60% of the magazine's pages, 
making a large contribution to its identity. 
A black hand grips a fence. The hand and 
the fence are sharp, but the rest — the 
hand, the face, the person's identity — are 
blurred. This was the cover of the Novem- 
ber 1977 issue of the UNESCO Courier 
on apartheid. This photo by René Burri, 
which we found at the Magnum picture 
agency, after a day of frantic searching, 
stood out from the rest. There was abso- 
lutely no doubt, this was the only image, 
out of hundreds of slides in a dozen agen- 
cies that could symbolise the chaos, the 
struggle, and self-questioning of an entire 
people. 
The cover always had to capture the 
reader's attention and plunge him or her 
into the heart of the matter: dilated pu- 
pils, flaming, in a round face against a 
red background, the Manga-like work of 
a b-year-old Chinese artist on the cover 
of “Children in Danger” (October 1991) 
is a much more powerful portrayal than 
any adult image could have been, of the

terror and powerlessness felt by a child. 
This issue, which brought together psy- 
chologists, educationalists, sociologists 
and other eminent “ists” would have no 
meaning without the involvement of its 
very subject-matter. 
“Window open on the World", this 
was the sub-title of the Courier, 
which wanted to get the reader 
look at the unknown, to perceive 
the other. In this context, the ico- 
nography, this form of writing with 
images, had a coherence and life 
of its own. It could give a rhythm

How can it be protected? How can we use the knowledge we obtain from these remains? 
How can it be shared with a wide audience? 
The next issue of the Courier will provide some answers to these questions, 
marking the entry into force on 2 January of UNESCO’s Convention 
on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage.
