From Africa's ancient past 
This striking, nearly life-size terracotta head was fashioned by an African 
sculptor some 2,500 years ago. It was discovered in a tin mine in 
northern Nigeria and is now in the Jos Museum (Nigeria). Excavations 
have revealed hundreds of heads, animal figures and fragments of statues—the 
art of a vanished civilization, today known as the Nok Culture from the 
name of a village 150 kilometres (100 miles) from Jos.

### IGNORE

In the course of the past sixten years no fewer than thirty-five independent 
states have emerged in Africa (see colour map, centre fold). The 
transformation of the political and economic map of Africa has been 
accompanied by unprecedented changes in education, science and culture 
and a new awareness of its people to the growing role that this vast 
continent is destined to play in the comity of nations. This issue of the 
Unesco Courier is devoted to only a few of the crucial questions 
pre-occupying the leaders and thinkers of Inter-tropical Africa today. 
All the articles have been written by prominent writers and authorities 
from Africa itself: Gabriel d'Arboussier (Senegal), K. Onwuka Dike (Nige- 
ria), Ezekiel Mphahlele (South Africa), Pathé Diagne (Senegal), N. C. Ctieno 
(Kenya) and Ekpo Eyo (Nigeria). Each author has attempted to examine 
his subject in the perspective of the newly-independent states of Africa 
as a whole, and in the light of the new ferment of ideas and attitudes 
and the renaissance which characterize the genius of African thought 
and culture today. 


### 2297: Birth of a new Africa

BIRTH OF A NEW AFRICA 
by Gabriel d'Arboussier 
Eo years ago the Unesco 
Courier published a special issue on 
Africa's past (Oct. 1959) which drew 
aside the curtain of ignorance that 
history had apparently draped around 
this continent, calling it Terrae In- 
cognitae—just before it emerged onto 
the international stage in the 1960s. 
The number was a timely incursion 
into the past for Africa was becoming 
“fashionable” and everyone was talk- 
ing about it though not always with 
the best of knowledge. 
One thing that strikes me today in 
comparing the 1959 issue with the 
  
GABRIEL D’ARBOUSSIER 
of Senegal 1s an Under- 
Secretary of the United 
Nations and Executive Di- 
rector of the U.N. Institute 
for Training and Research. 
Jurist, statesman and diplo- 
mat, he was Senegal's 
Minister of Justice (1960- 
1962) and helped to draw 
up his country's Constitu- 
tion. In 1960 he headed 
Senegal's delegation to the 
United Nations and while 
ambassador to France (1963- 
1964) was Senegal's perma- 
nent delegate to Unesco. 
He is a member of the Exe- 
cutive Council of the Insti- 
tute of Studies for Econo- 
mic and Social Develop- 
ment at the University of 
Paris. He is the author of 
many studies, including 
L'Afrique vers I'unité (To- 
wards African Unity). 
  
  
present one is the difference in 
authors. Those who wrote on Africa's 
past were Europeans. In this number 
every article is by an African. 
One's first reaction on looking at the 
immense platform that constitutes the 
African continent is surprise at its 
extreme diversity, but In my opinion 
this is only a first impression. Con- 
strasting with it is the other factor, the 
transformations which have swept 
300 million inhabitants forward in a 
movement which, though it may take 
different forms in different places, is 
nevertheless a general one. 
In his treatise on peace and war 
among the nations (1), Raymond Aron 
says: “..every social science problem 
should be examined from three points 
of view: 
WM the arrangement of the data 
available, 
® the selection of the problems 
bearing on the social factor studied, 
M distinguishing between constant 
and accidental factors. 
It is from this threefold point of view 
that | should like to try to present the 
African continent, which a French 
geographer, Jacques Weulersse, has 
described as “a giant question mark 
on the flank of the Old World.” 
The oneness of our world means that 
nowadays we can no longer examine 
the problems arising in one part without 
first taking the facts of the international 
scene into account. And there are 
four international facts that concern 
Africa very closely. 
First in importance is the world 
situation, which is such that two great 
powers, the “Big Two", seem to have 
an almost decisive influence on world 
events. 
The second is the European situation, 
and this undoubtedly is the one that 
concerns the whole of Africa more 
particularly. 
The third, which perhaps does not 
yet seem to have a very definite effect 
on the destiny of Africa, is China, with 
its 700 million people, who in a few 
years will be 1,000 million; the African 
continent has only 300 million, in an 
area of 30 million square kilometres. 
The fourth international fact is the 
appearance of the “Third World", a 
fundamental factor in world evolution 
today. 
To these primary factors several 
others must be added, which are not 
simply matters of fact, for they may 
perhaps be said to introduce a new 
political concept into the relationships

between peoples. One is the vast 
wave of decolonization that has 
swept over Africa in the past few 
years. Broadly speaking, the end of 
the colonial system began after the 
Second World War. Only a few years 
ago Africa was almost entirely under 
colonial rule, and now it has become a 
continent of independent states in 
search of their own future. This fact 
entirely changes the concepts of 
relationships between peoples. 
Those relationships may be establish- 
ed either on the basis of the rivalries 
we knew in former times, or on that of 
   
PYRAMIDS AT KANO. At harvest time sacks of ground nuts are stacked in mountainous 
piles all over Tropical Africa. Pyramids of ground nuts in this co-operative 
depot at Kano, Nigeria, symbolize not only prosperity but also Africa's dependence 
on foreign trends and foreign trade. Because the major part of Africas’s work 
has been devoted to producing export crops, to the detriment of its own food 
production, it now depends for almost 80 per cent of its subsistence on imports. 
essential co-operation between all the 
existing states. The policy of hege- 
mony formerly applied to the African 
continent is now being transformed 
into a policy of co-operation, a new 
factor of the greatest importance. 
In my opinion, these are the essential 
facts on the international scene that we 
must keep constantly in mind when we 
are considering this immense continent. 
But within this general context there 
are other more specifically African 
factors. First, there is the great size 
of Africa which, no doubt because it 
is a clearly defined unit, appears 
smaller on the map than the vast 
spaces we see on maps showing 
Europe and its prolongation towards 
Asia. 
Then there are the 300 million peo- 
ple, lost, one might almost say, in 
Africa’s 30 million square kilometres. 
In company with South America, Africa 
is no doubt one of the continents with 
the lowest population density. Not 
only has it a low density but also 
a striking inequality of distribution. In 
the desert regions there are 0.4 inha- 
bitants per square kilometre, whereas

### 2297: Birth of a new Africa

A NEW AFRICA (Continued) 
The need for greater inter-African co-operation 
in certain areas of Nigeria for instance 
there are 40, 50, 60 and even 70 inha- 
bitants per square kilometre, which is 
outstanding for Africa. 
In addition to this geographical 
inequality, an economic and social 
inequality has now arisen. The now 
familiar exodus from the countryside to 
the towns has led to the growth of 
sprawling cities in countries with a very 
low population density. Recently es- 
tablished states often have capitals of 
inordinate size in relation to the coun- 
try. | think this is general in Africa, 
whereas in Europe it is rather excep- 
tional. 
Qur African capitals have often been 
compared—relatively speaking, of 
course—to the capital of Austria, which 
also has the rather special character- 
istic of being like an enormous head 
on a rather small body. The combina- 
tion of these geographical and demo- 
graphic facts leads one to wonder 
whether there is one Africa or several 
Africas. 
Arcs geographical zo- 
nes do in fact differ very greatly. 
There is a vast difference between the 
Mediterranean coast and the Guinean 
coast (Guinean in the sense of the 
Gulf of Guinea and not the country of 
Guinea), and between the savanna 
countries, even in a group like West 
Africa that has nevertheless come to 
be considered as a single entity. 
There are great differences, too, 
between northern Niger and south- 
ern Nigeria, between the Djerma and 
the Somono of the Niger and the 
Ibo of Nigeria, between the Malinke, 
the Fan and the Ashanti. Differences 
too between the Fula herdsmen and 
the Sarakolle, the Battutsi of the 
Congo and the forest men of the 
Gabon. 
So we see the outlines of very diffe- 
rent Africas, different in their geogra- 
phy, their peoples and their civiliza- 
tions. Differences of civilization exist 
between the men of the Sahara and 
the men of the Sahel, bordering the 
desert, between those of the savanna 
and those of the forest. Yet we should 
not let these differences, real though 
they are, prevent us from perceiving the 
great unity, or rather several major 
unifying factors, that exist in this vast 
continent. 
First let us come back to the eco- 
nomic and social factors and look at 
the important unity Africa possesses 
because it is a developing continent. 
Obviously this is not a quality that 
should be stressed as an argument, 
but we are looking for points of unity, 
factors of unification in this huge and 
diverse continent with its extraordi- 
narily varied countryside and its great 
variety of peoples. 
There is a second factor. Africa is 
a developing continent that was under 
colonial rule for a very long time and 
its communities have only quite 
recently acceded to a modern way of 
life and statehood. Apart from Ethio- 
pia, one of the oldest states in the 
world, and a few embryonic kingdoms 
that were able to subsist in the nor- 
thern part of Africa, almost all the 
present sovereign powers are new 
ones, and almost all the states are 
“apprentice states”. That is a factor 
permitting some generalization in talk- 
ing of the African continent. 
There is one last point which seems 
to me extremely important. Africa, 
which except on the outer fringes 
had little contact with the outside 
world, had developed internal civiliza- 
tions based on a community way of 
life that is the most outstanding feature 
of the social structure of these coun- 
tries as a whole. So we find that civi- 
lizations which appear very far remov- 
ed from one another because of diffe- 
rences in their geography, climate or 
historical past, are very near to each 
other as regards the community way 
of life adopted by their peoples. 
Indeed, when we speak to a farmer 
from Senegal, or from Ubang-Shari, or 
Chad or the Congo (Kinshasa) and see 
how he lives, how the various age 
groups in his country are organized, 
how the land is divided or the income 
from collective production distributed 
among the different members of the 
group, we find everywhere the same 
community basis, which, incidentally, 
is reflected in the cultural life that is 
itself one of the great unifying factors 
in this continent. 
The cultural aspect is perhaps one 
of the most important that we should 
consider. Alongside the considerable 
variety of agrarian civilizations and 
social structures, there has emerged 
a concept of life and of the future 
of man and his relationship to cosmic 
forces, that is one of the essential 
characteristics of the cultural outlook 
of the African, in spite of the strik- 
ing differences in colour of skin bet- 
ween the Berber, the Moor, the Fula or 
the Sara and the Malinke. 
They all hold to the same con- 
cepts as their ancestors. This provides 
an extremely important background, 
expressed in religions terms by the 
animism that is to be found every- 
where, at any rate below the line of 
the Sahara. Where neither the Islamic 
nor the Christian religion has yet 
penetrated, we find a set of religious 
beliefs that are all related to, all 
branches of, this animist conception. 
Broadly, these are the few basic fac- 
tors that give us a more exact view of 
the African continent; a continent in 
which the immense variety of ways of 
life and the extraordinarily different 
concepts of social organization that 
characterize it do not preclude the 
existence of a few fundamental factors 
binding all together in a common 
destiny. 
W.. this view of Africa in 
our minds, how are we to make a 
selection from among the problems— 
the task which now faces both the 
leaders and the peoples themselves 
in African countries? | think we must 
classify the problems as political, eco- 
nomic, social and cultural. This is in 
line with the dominant ideas now com- 
ing to the fore in these young states. 
The first great objective for each of 
them is to build up national cohesion. 
Most of these states have been 
formed on territories that were not 
national territories and had not consti- 
tuted nations. That is perhaps the 
greatest difference between Africa and 
Europe. In Europe the State some- 
times emerged from the cohesion that 
a group of peoples had already been 
able to achieve among themselves and 
had then wished to express, first in 
their relations with the outside world, 
by constituting themselves as states; 
in Africa the situation is exactly the 
reverse, 
Africa has states that have been 
constituted without any national basis 
and states that are trying to achieve 
national cohesion at the very time 
when, throughout the world, national 
sovereignty is confronted with the 
movement towards the constitution of 
large economic groupings, made 
necessary by the new international 
division of labour, the expansion of 
markets, and all the new functions that 
economics obliges the State to per- 
form. 
The second consideration is that 
these states, wishing to achieve nation- 
hood, are faced with the fact of the 
absolute necessity of inter-African 
co-operation, for they have very 
quickly realized that modern economic 
laws and the requirements of economic

## [Page 7](https://demo.humlab.umu.se/courier/078226engo.pdf#page=7) 0

### 2297: Birth of a new Africa

development make it impossible for 
them to attain their objectives within 
the narrow framework of their own 
states, and that they must therefore 
agree among themselves and set their 
course towards inter-African co-opera- 
tion. 
The third consideration is that nowa- 
days everyone, the world over, is 
talking of economic development. This 
idea seems to be new but is perhaps 
in fact not so very new. Economic 
growth has often been confused with 
economic development. | think that 
when, for some etymological reason, 
people try to classify countries into 
developed and developing, they should 
recognize that all countries, whatever 
their level of development, are 
constantly developing; each is always 
trying to do better. 
The largest states, the largest eco- 
nomic groups are formed nowadays 
precisely because of this desire to 
achieve a still greater degree of

economic development. But Africa 
entered modern life at the very time 
when this problem and this notion of 
economic development were elevated 
to the rank of theories. The notion 
of economic development was imme- 
diately taken over by all these states 
and made the leitmotif of all their 
claims. 
After the claim for independence 
has come the claim for economic 
development; having claimed the right 
to speak on equal terms with others, 
states are now claiming the right to 
live like others, to have the same 
means of social, economic and cultural 
development, and economic develop- 
ment is obviously one of the most 
important problems affecting these 
countries today. 
Economic development brings all 
these states face to face with the 
necessity of international co-operation. 
For today it is absolutely essential for 
them to have understandings with each

(Ivory Coast). Five years ago Africa 
had only six television transmitters. Today 
a score of countries operate national 
television stations. 
other, to regroup themselves, to have 
inter-African co-operation. They have 
understood that they cannot develop 
if they do not have relations with 
the outside world. 
After an initial tendency to turn 
inwards, after showing a certain desire 
to break away from all its past foreign 
relations, Africa is now perhaps being 
swept forward by a new movement. 
But there is a danger of abandoning 
the concern that is expressed in the 
old proverb: “God helps those who 
help themselves”. It may well be true 
that Africa's development depends on 
international relations, but it will de- 
pend above all upon the work of her 
citizens and on the “will to economize” 
as Arthur Lewis has termed one of the 
essentials of economic development. 
Work is the basis of development in 
any country. The world's highly de- 
veloped countries reached their pre- 
sent state only after years and cen- 
turies of suffering, patience and hard 
work. 
At the political level the problem 
facing the African states today is 
that of independence and the need 
for international co-operation. They 
first need to understand that the best 
way of assuring their independence 
is not to isolate themselves. Inde- 
pendence is not only the independence 
of a few leaders, a few families or 
a few social classes, but of the whole 
population. Today this independence 
is exercised in an atmosphere of world 
interdependence. 
As regards internal organization— 
and here we have another common 
factor—It is noteworthy that African 
countries have been entirely free from 
the conflicts that occurred in Europe 
in former times between the written 
and the unwritten law, between the 
written constitution and the absence 
of any constitution. Today there 
seems to be a general movement 
leading all the African states first 
towards the achievement of a written 
constitution designed to establish 
authority. 
Why this concern with a written 
constitution and why such a reaction 
against custom? In Europe the law, 
by its form, seemed to be the force 
that operated most strongly against

the imperative social evolution that 
was taking place, whereas custom, 
seemed more fully to meet the need 
for evolution. The disadvantage, it 
may be said, is that the desire to 
evolve is so great that the constitution 
is changed rather too often. This is, 
admittedly, a fairly serious danger 
lurking on our path, but | think we 
should not exaggerate its importance. 
Another problem is foreign policy. 
Immediately after attaining indepen- 
dence, African countries were tempted 
by neutrality and neutralism to the 
point where a series of different terms 
was invented, ranging from negative 
neutralism to positive neutralism. This 
was simply an expression of the desire 
to avoid being tied to one bloc or 
another. 
Today that attitude is being some- 
what reversed. Neutralism is gradually 
losing ground. Africa is realizing that 
her fate is bound up with that of every

point out that Africa is in the process 
of making an- inventory of her own 
economic resources. She is trying 
to find out whether, by her own means, 
she can bring her traditional economy 
up to the point of “take-off”, so as to 
embark on a modern economic system 
or whether she needs fairly substantial 
assistance from abroad to reach this 
stage. 
Africa realizes that both these things 
are necessary. Intensive work must 
be done by the Africans themselves, 
and above all some thinking is called 
for on the subject of Africa's economy, 
so as to free her economic develop- 
ment from complete dependence upon 
foreign trends and foreign trade, as 
has been the case so far. 
De of the characteristics 
of Africa is that the visible and calcu- 
lable part of its national income is 
largely made up of receipts from 
exports abroad. A consequence of 
this state of affairs, which is extremely 
dangerous for Africa, is that the major 
part of Africa's work has been devoted 
to the production of goods destined 
for sale abroad. The share of food 
production necessary for subsistence 
has been sacrificed, with the para- 
doxical result that a continent that 
could be almost self-supporting, today 
depends for almost 80 per cent of its 
subsistence on imports from abroad. 
We need only recall that Senegal, 
which could produce rice and millet 
for its subsistence (and formerly did 
so) now imports huge amounts of 
rice from Burma, Siam, Cambodia and 
South Viet-Nam each month, and at 
the same time is compelled to sell 
its groundnut oil abroad because its 
population consumes only a very small 
part of what is produced! A reversal 
of that trend would help to constitute 
internal economies and internal mar- 
kets that would provide backing for 
Africa's foreign trade. 
In my opinion, this building up of 
internal markets is the best means 
of attracting capital investments. Of 
course, political declarations and legal 
guarantees for capital investments can 
be given, but the best safeguard for

Numerous scientific institutions are 
helping to prepare the General History 
of Africa, particularly the network 
of institutes of African studies set up 
with Unesco’s assistance in ten African 
countries. Their contribution to the 
historical studies will include the 
recording and analysis of the oral 
tradition. This work has a high priority 
since the keepers of these traditions 
are probably the last generation which 
can provide the data needed by historians.

THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY 
l.. month the Unesco Courier reported on the Scientific 
and Cultural History of Mankind now in course of publication in various 
languages under Unesco’s auspices. Another international publishing 
project of unprecedented scope and importance will be the General 
History of Africa. Unesco’s General Conference approved the idea in 
1964 and the preliminary stage was completed last year with the appoint- 
ment of Professor K. Onwuka Dike, former Vice-Chancellor of the 
University of Ibadan, Nigeria, to be Scientific Director of the project. 
The preparation and publication of the History of Africa is scheduled 
to take ten years (1965- 1975), for which Unesco will contribute $ 500,000. 
Work will be undertaken in collaboration with the International Congress 
of Africanists (an organization created in 1962 with Unesco help) and 
many other international and national scientific and historical institutes 
of African studies. 
The General History of Africa will comprise several volumes and will 
represent the most comprehensive work on Africa’s past ever attempted. 
An abridged edition designed for a wider readership is also planned. 
This unique venture will mobilize the combined research of historians, 
archaeologists, linguists, ethnologists and other scholars from Africa and 
other continents. 
The History of Africa will be not only an account of events and political 
institutions, but- also of countless other aspects of Africa’s past: the 
spread of techniques, the migrations of populations, the influence of 
caravan routes and trade, and the various other cultural, commercial and 
social interrelations between North Africa and Tropical Africa. 
The emergence of independent African states has awakened every- 
where in the world (including Africa itself) a need to know and under- 
stand the peoples of Africa and their contributions to universal culture. 
The General History of Africa, it-is hoped, will help to fill an important 
gap in.our knowledge of this’ great continent and thereby foster better 
international understanding between the peoples of all countries. Here, 
Professor Dike reviews recent developments: in the study of African 
history.

OF AFRICA’S HISTORY 
by K. Onwuka Dike 
T is something of an irony 
that, although written sources on the 
history of many parts of the African 
continent antedated the Christian era, 
African History as an academic disci- 
pline, is largely a post World War {i 
development. 
This statement is sarticularly true of 
Africa South of the Sahara. Written 
sources abound on Mediterranean 
Africa from the days of the Carthagi- 
nians, the Romans and the Byzantines, 
on Ethiopia since the introduction there 
of Christianity in the fourth century 
AD. on Africa north of the tropical 
forest since the eleventh century, on 
the coast of West Africa since the 
fifteenth century and on the larger part 
  
of the continent since the beginning of 
the nineteenth century, through the 
accounts and journals of geographers, 
explorers, missionaries and colonial 
administrators. 
This is not to say that scholars paid 
no attention at all to Africa before the 
Second World War. Academic inte- 
rest in Egyptian and North African civi- 
lization is of long standing, but North 
African history was looked at mainly 
as part of Asian history and its impor- 
tant links with Africa South of the 
Sahara were hardly ever studied and 
assessed. 
Indeed, individuals and organizations 
had scholarly insight into the languages 
and ethnography of the southern por- 
tion of the continent. But none of 
these organizations was primarily con- 
cerned with African history, which 
until recently, remained beyond the 
intellectual horizons of the universities. 
Nor were the considerable writings of 
administrators and social anthropolo- 
gists between the Wars generally 
prompted by the necessity for the 
administration to understand the Afri- 
can way of life and to investigate the 
root-causes of African discontent and 
riots, geared to African history. 
Although in the last century Russian 
explorers like Eduard Ivanovich Eykh- 
~ val'd and A. V. Yeliseyew contributed 
to our geographical knowledge of 
Africa north of the Sahara, it was not

AFRICA'S HISTORY (Continued) 
Vast untapped source material 
until after 1952 that African Studies, 
generally, began to receive serious 
attention in the Soviet Union. As late 
as 1956 none of the one thousand 
eight hundred and seventy-seven his- 
torical associations and agencies in 
the United States and Canada was 
remotely concerned with the study of 
any part or aspect of Africa. 
In Britain a few years ago, the autho- 
rities of the University of London were 
very sceptical when a degree course 
in African History was first mooted and 
waited until 1963 before establishing a 
Chair of African History. Perhaps in 
the academic world today, Professor 
Trevor Roper of Oxford University is 
not alone in his view that African His- 
tory is no more than “the unrewarding 
gyrations of barbarous tribes in 
picturesque but irrelevant corners of 
the globe.” 
Te great majority of the 
three hundred million inhabitants of 
this continent are descendants of those 
who have lived on it for several thous- 
and years. The story of these peoples 
and the vast land they inhabit repres- 
ents a very considerable part of the 
history of human society. The actions 
of Africans have not only shaped the 
pattern of human history on this con- 
tinent, but have also played their part 
in the development of the civilizations 
of the New World, Europe and Asia. 
The real scientific study of history in 
the modern sense of that term may be 
said to have started in Africa with the 
work of the famous Tunisian historian 
of the fourteenth century, Ibn Khaldun. 
He emphasized the great importance of 
sociology to history, describing the 
past largely by observing the interac- 
tion of state and society and by ana- 
lyzing the development of the various 
elements of society. 
Unfortunately, his work has, until 
recently, had too little influence on the 
study of history, for the medieval world 
was little concerned with history, pre- 
ferring theology, law and rhetoric. It 
is true that since the eighteenth cen- 
tury Europe has paid a great deal of 
"attention to the study of history. But 
because of the abundance of written 
documentary evidence, her scholars 
adopted, not the sociological method of 
Ibn Khaldun, but the legal and the bio- 
graphical, concerning themselves main- 
ly with the decrees, wars and politics 
of kings. 
When, in the nineteenth century, this 
approach began to be broadened to 
take account once again of social and 
economic factors, documentary evi- 
dence had become so overwhelmingly 
important for the European scholar 
that he tended to equate written docu- 
ments with history. He began to take 
the absence of documents to mean the 
absence of history, the absence of any 
events worthy of historical study. 
Under the colonial regimes, this view 
of history flourished in Africa. It bols- 
tered up the colonial ruler's propa- 
ganda that the African had no history 
worthy of record and that the history 
of the European rulers constituted the 
sum total of African history. 
Needless to say that this view of 
history greatly hindered the develop- 
ment of African historiography, for 
undoubtedly, there is a dearth of docu- 
mentary material on African history. 
And as long as African historians were 
brought up in the traditions which 
regarded documentary evidence as the 
sole material for historical analysis, 
they were working in a difficult cir- 
cumscribed position. Either they pro- 
duced only what may be called chro- 
nicles or they got carried away by 
flights of fancy and wrote polemics in 
place of history. 
Fortunately, the writing of African 
history has made some progress in the 
last few years. The identification of 
history with the abundance of records 
has been proved false. There is now 
no need to belabour that Africa has a 
history worthy of study at all levels 
of intellectual discipline. 
More than that, it is now generally 
accepted that the history of Africa must 
be the history of the African peoples 
themselves—that their actions, not the 
actions of the invaders, must be the 
focus of African history. Each new 
work, each new edition of older works, 
shows increasing consciousness of this 
point of view. 
Foe now that we have 
become more conscious of the proper 
subject matter of African history, we 
are still faced with the problem of the 
material at our'disposal. The written 
material gathered so far on African 
history is not only scanty, it also 
consists largely of evidence by outsi- 
ders either in the European languages 
or Arabic. The bulk of it exists in 
the metropolitan archives of colonial 
powers, and the material tells us much 
more about the actions and intentions 
of the invaders than of the action and 
intentions of the Africans themselves. 
Because this external evidence is 
still the principal source, the proper 
writing of African history continues to 
be inhibited. In spite of the increas- 
ETHIOPIA’S

ing desire of many historians to des- 
cribe properly the role of Africans, the 
actions of the invaders still remain 
disproportionately large in African his- 
tory. Outmoded and untenable myths 
continue to dominate the interpretations 
of the African past. | need to give 
only two examples of these myths. 
First, there is the Hamitic hypothe- 
sis, the disreputable theory that Ne- 
groes have made no contribution to 
human progress, that “the civilizations 
of Africa are the civilizations of the 
Hamites.” This theory, based largely 
on the scanty Arabic sources and a 
dubious interpretation of some legends 
of origin in Africa, continues to be can- 
vassed in spite of the criticism of scho- 
lars like Greenberg, in spite of the 
clear evidence of Negro contributions 
to civilization, including some of the 
best known plastic arts in the history 
of the world. 
Secondly, there is the attempt at a 
pseudo-economic interpretation of Afri- 
can history, which sees all social and 
political movements in Africa from the 
sixteenth to the nineteenth century as 
motivated solely by the slave trade. It 
is, if you like, another Hamitic theory, 
that nothing went on inside Africa in 
those centuries that was not connected 
with European trade along the coast.

ANCIENT CIVILIZATION 
There is evidence that a 
protohistorical Ethiopian civ- 
ilization existed several 
thousand years before the 
Christian Era, though it left 
no monuments. About 2,000 
years ago travellers from 
Egypt who penetrated to the 
Abyssinian highlands found 
a flourishing civilization and 
large cities. One of Ethio- 
pia’s best preserved monu- 
ments is the giant obelisk 
at Aksum. Standing 24 me- 
tres (nearly 80 ft.) high, it 
dominates the tombs of the 
kings of Ethiopia's Axumite 
Kingdom founded over 2,000 
years ago. Ethiopia's an- 
cient legends are still told 
graphically in brightly col- 
oured paintings. Among the 
~ best known is the story of 
Solomon and the Queen of 
Sheba and the birth of Me- 
nelik, first Emperor of Ethio- 
pia, whom Ethiopians believe 
was the son of Solomon 
and the Queen. Painting, 
left, depicts the court of 
Emperor Menelik.

To get behind those myths, to tackle 
seriously the writing of African history 
despite the scantiness and the nature 
of the written sources, is the problem of 
African historiography today. 
My first suggestion is that we must 
accumulate at different centres in 
Africa the bulk of the existing docu- 
mentary evidence on African history. 
In the past, the study of African history 
has been held up by the quite remark- 
able dispersal all over the world of 
the relevant source material. This 
material includes important African 
works taken out of the continent by 
colonial rulers and other visitors. 
The centralization of this material, 
in Africa, will relieve scholars of the 
enormous trouble and expense involv- 
ed in so many unnecessary journeys 
from one end of the world to the other, 
in quest of material for the study of 
our own land. Fortunately, we now 
live in the age of the microfilm and 
the zerox process, and what | am sug- 
gesting is therefore practicable. 
But of course the accumulation of 
source material does not merely mean 
the recovery of documents at present 
preserved overseas. It means also, 
and most important, the recovery and 
organization of material at present lying 
disregarded and disorganized in Africa. 
This is a task of almost frightening 
immensity. On the side of written 
documentary material alone we are 
only just beginning to appreciate the 
size of the problem. 
! 
0. now is it being realiz- 
ed, for example, that colonial governm- 
ent, missionary and commercial records 
in European languages are not the only 
written sources for the history of the 
continent outside the North African 
coastlands. We have hardly yet be- 
gun to take into account the fact that 
many of the peoples of Subsaharan 
Africa have for several centuries been 
using Arabic as an official and literary 
language for many different types of 
written intercourse. 
We have really only just learned 
also that the Swahili and Hausa lan- 
guages (to name only two) have been 
written down extensively in the Arabic 
script, and may therefore, for all we 
know at present, have produced a fur- 
ther unsuspected source of written 
material. 
Again how many of us also realize 
how far private African citizens such 
as the Efik Chief, Antera Duke, were 
using European languages for writing 
in their private intercourse as far back

as the eighteenth century? The private 
papers of African families are a poten- 
tial source of historical material which 
to date has hardly been investigated 
at all. 
But private papers tend to be kept 
by their owners under even worse con- 
ditions than one finds in government 
offices, and their long-term preserva- 
tion will undoubtedly depend on their 
deposit in proper archive repositories. 
Private owners of documents must 
therefore be persuaded to allow gov- 
ernmental or learned institutions to 
preserve their papers for them. 
There is, again, | am sure, an overall 
lack of attention to the question of Ara- 
bic archives, both public and private. 
We are recovering material dating from 
the seventeenth century onwards in 
Northern Nigeria; but it is noteworthy 
that we are also recovering important 
private material in areas not usually 
associated with Arabic documentation 
such as southern Yorubaland. 
At the same time we are conscious 
that we are only just beginning to 
exploit this field which holds out great 
promise for the future. | strongly sus- 
pect that all over West Africa it will 
be found that Arabic material exists in 
private hands on a scale hitherto quite 
unknown. Collection of written mate- 
rial in such languages as Kanuri,

AFRICA’S HISTORY (Continued) 
70 centres now exploring Africa's past 
Hausa, Nupe, Fulani and so on, which 
have long used the Arabic script, has 
also to be attended to. 
Yet the accumulation of written mate- 
rial is only a small part of the task 
which faces us, and it is perhaps the 
easiest to encompass if sufficient 
effort is made. There are many diffe- 
rent types of unwritten sources which 
we have to study before we can hope 
to come near to an understanding of 
the African past. More and more 
attention is being paid to the value of 
oral traditions and social anthropolo- 
gical studies of African countries. But 
the importance of this material to the 
historian is vitiated by a lack of proper 
analysis. 
There is need for a more systematic 
approach to the question of oral tra- 
dition. The anthropologists who pio- 
neered this field of research are not 
themselves agreed on the proper inter- 
pretation of oral history. What is more 
they have worked too much in isolation 
from the written records and from the 
historians who have the information 
and the analytical training to make 
substantial contributions in this field. 
The same, of course, is true of the 
historians. Both in our training and in 
our research we have not always made 
enough use of the work of the social 
anthropologists. 
Resear into the African 
past has made tremendous strides in 
the last twenty years and in the learn- 
ed circles African History has come 
into its own. For Africans historical 
research into their past was neces- 
sarily a concomitant of the political 
emancipation of a substantial portion 
of the continent. 
African scholars are bringing to bear 
upon their investigation the vital back- 
ground knowledge of their culture, their 
language and their institutions, they 
are in a position that enables them to 
fathom the documents beyond depths 
attained by non-African eyes, selecting 
those portions relevant to Africa and 
its peoples rather than concentrating 
on materials bearing only on European 
activities in Africa. 
European and American scholars 
have lost no time in the quarrying 
and processing of the mines of infor- 
mation unveiled by archives in many 
parts of the world. By 1964 there 
had been founded sixty Centres and 
Institutes of African Studies in fourteen 
European countries and the United 
States. In the Soviet Union African 
Studies had been zbly inspired by 
Professor D. A. Olderogge, an out- 
standing philologist whose works 
include The Peoples of Africa (1954), 
The Hausa Language (1954) and Wes- 
tern Sudan in the 15th - 19 th Centuries 
(1960). 
In December 1959 an African Insti- 
tute was organized within the Depart- 
ment of Historical Science in the Soviet 
Academy of Sciences. Between 1959 
and 1961 alone, no less than four 
hundred and thirty-three Soviet publi- 
cations on Africa appeared. Thanks to 
the late Professor Potekhin, first Direc- 
tor of the Africa Institute, interest in 
African Studies increased in the Soviet 
Union. 
In the United States, where African 
History was not catered for in the 
American Historical Review until 1963, 
the African Studies Association was 
formed in 1957. At first dominated by 
linguists, ethnologists and social an- 
thropologists, it has begun to inspire 
historical scholarship. In 1964 there 
were no less than twenty-five Centres 
of African Studies in the U.S.A. Amer- 
ican Africanists have achieved much, 
particularly in Linguistics and Political 
Science. 
In Britain the School of Oriental 
and African Studies, University of 
London, blazed the trail. This institu- 
tion has accomplished a great deal in 
Linguistics and the history of Bantu 
Africa, under the leadership of Pro- 
fessor Ronald Oliver. A specialist 
approach was lately adopted in the 
University of Birmingham where the 
Centre of West African Studies con- 
centrates on West Africa, under the 
direction of Professor John Fage. 
In Africa, naturally, African and non- 
African historians in the universities 
are giving pride of place to African 
History more than anywhere else out- 
side the continent. Learned journals 
devoted to local historical studies have 
multiplied and publications stepped up. 
There are now at least sixty-six 
centres, al) of which have the aim of 
studying some aspect of African 
society, history, law and culture. 
Scholars engaged in the task of redis- 
covering the African past know that 
African History has passed the stage 
of experiment, indeed in some regions 
of Africa the field is ripe unto harvest; 
the information unearthed is already 
enormous and the possibilities for 
further investigations are almost infi- 
nite. 
It must be admitted, however, that 
there are still important gaps in our 
knowledge of African peoples and that 
in some regions, particularly in East 
and Central Africa a lot of work re- 
mains to be done before a definitive 
history of these areas can be com- 
prehensively written. What is needed 
is not only the writing up of the 
history of those areas where research 
has progressed, but also the launching 
of planned research in regions where 
our knowledge is scanty. The two 
must go hand in hand. The future 
Unesco General History of Africa 
intends to lay emphasis on both 
aspects. 
B is gratifying to note that 
some of the problems raised have 
been surveyed by the International 
African Institute, which summoned a 
Conference of Africanists at Ibadan 
University in April 1964 to discuss 
some of these problems, and by the 
First International Congress of Africa- 
nists which met in Accra, Ghana, in 
1962. The tasks before us are great, 
but not insurmountable; their solution 
will entail considerable financial outlay, 
time and the close co-operation of 
scholars of all disciplines. 
If organized along the right lines the 
planned Unesco General History of 
Africa will serve to bring together 
scholars of all the disciplines relevant 
to the study of the African past. To 
achieve this objective it is imperative 
that a body of scholars should be set 
up, designed to channel the energies 
of the historians of Africa in tackling 
urgent problems of African historio- 
graphy and in correcting erroneous 
assumptions about that past. 
Take for instance, the general ten- 
dency of historians to isolate Africa 
north of the Sahara in a manner quite 
unhistorical. Indeed, rather than being 
a barrier the Sahara has from time 
immemorial been a bridge linking the 
north to the south. Although Medi- 
terranean Africa has had contact with 
Mediterranean Europe and the Middle 
East for a very long time there has 
been cultural cross-fertilization, as 
well as economic and political con- 
nexions between Africa north and 
south of the Sahara. Both areas share 
some common problems, their distinc- 
tiveness in many respects notwith- 
standing. Any scheme for the writing 
of African history should be within 
the framework of the entire continent. 
This is not to say that a regional 
approach to African history is unde- 
sirable or should be abandoned. In 
fact the most practical and most fruit- 
ful way of achieving maximum results 
is to consider the problems of African 
historiography in their regional con- 
text. But whilst these units are to be 
treated fully in their own right, they

should be conceived as units within 
the organic whole of the African con- 
tinent. | suggest the division of Africa 
into the following regions: North Africa 
including the Nile Valley, Ethiopia, The 
Sudanic Belt, West Africa, Central and 
East Africa and South Africa. African- 
ists within these regions would be 
able to compare notes on matters of 
common interest. 
Perhaps the most important meth- 
odological problem posed by African 
historiography is the inevitability of a 
multi-disciplinary approach, particularly 
for the pre-colonial period in which 
written documents do not exist for 
the greater part of the continent. The 
historian of Africa cannot afford to 
work in isolation; he needs the aid of 
several other disciplines related to 
his subject. He should take seriously 
oral tradition and work hand in hand 
with linguists, archaelogists, social and 
physical anthropologists, orologists, 
and artists. And yet although the 
historian of Africa is fully aware of 
The graceful hull of this fishing boat from Morondava, on the western coast 
of Madagascar, is an outstanding example of marine design. The craft is fitted 
with outriggers, traditionally used as stabilizers by many boat builders 
of Oceania. Though considered geographically as part of Africa, Madagascar 
has close ethnological, linguistic and cultural affinities with Oceania. 
the vital value of other disciplines he 
still tends to ignore them. Until re- 
cently, it must be admitted that Afri- 
canists have tended to work along 
independent lines. 
Up to now, then, no historical work 
on a massive scale has been attempt- 
ed on a multi-disciplinary basis. One of 
course is aware of efforts in the 
Soviet Union to adopt this strategy, 
and of the Benin and Yoruba Research 
schemes in Nigeria. A carefully plan- 
ned programme of the continental his- 
tory of Africa on interdisciplinary lines 
is the need of the hour. 
Much credit is due to the well- 
seasoned and understanding Africa- 
nists of the United States, Europe and 
the Soviet Union. But is has to be 
emphasized that the problems posed 
by African history are largely African, 
and therefore demand an African so- 
lution. The themes and emphasis of 
the researches of African historians 
show clearly that it is mainly from 
within Africa that the mainspring for 
the study of Africa can come. 
This is as it should be. Africans 
have a special responsibility which out- 
siders cannot discharge. They are 
psychologically and emotionally more 
drawn than foreigners towards their 
continent and heritage. In the under- 
standing of documents on African cul- 
ture and institutions, in historical appre- 
ciation and use of oral tradition, in 
analysis of human drama in African 
society, African scholars have an 
advantage over others and are more 
likely to get at the root of the problem 
than non-Africans. 
It is not implied that non-Africans 
have no major part to play in the 
rediscovery of Africa's past. Their re- 
sourcefulness and skill are required 
in the disciplines of Archaelogy, Lin- 
guistics and Art, in which they are pre- 
eminently qualified, for the elucidation, 
illumination apd enrichment of our 
knowledge of African society and 
human drama in Africa over’ the last 
three thousand years.

EKPO EYO is director of the Fed- 
eral Service of Antiquities, Nigeria. 
He was formerly director of the 
Department of Archaeology, los 
Museum, Nigeria. Dr. Eyo's text 
was originally presented at the 
Dakar Symposium organized under 
Unesco auspices in connexion with 
the first World Festival of Negro 
Arts (April 1966). It is to be 
published by “Présence Africaine”, 
aris 
W.. should we preserve 
our African works of art and craft? 
Why should we not spend whatever 
money we have on improving our liv- 
ing standards rather than on the pres- 
ervation of works of art and craft 
which after all do not bring us any 
material benefit? 
The answer is that the need for the 
preservation and study of works of 
art and craft cannot be over-empha- 
sized in countries where written hist- 
orical records are rare and recent. It 
is precisely because these things had 
not been done that the African has 
often been regarded as a man without 
a past, and as one still living in pri- 
mitive savagery. 
In Western countries, protective 
measures ' have long been taken for 
the preservation of works of art. In 
many countries national bodies have 
been created for this purpose and 
public museums opened whose func- 
tions include the collection and pres- 
ervation of the cultural heritage. The 
British Museum, for instance, was 
opened to the public as early as 1795. 
In Africa certain unavoidable cir- 
cumstances militate against the natural 
preservation of works of art and craft. 
About 80 per cent of African works of 
art and craft are wood which does 
not survive thé ravages of fire, fungus, 
termites, weather and worms. The 
oldest wood carvings are probably the 
ancestor (Ekpu) figures from Oron in 
Eastern Nigeria and yet they are said 
to be only 150 to 200 years old. 
William Fagg, the British ethnologist, 
attributes the continuity of African 
art to the high rate at which termites 
eat up carvings as soon as they are 
on a new school for Lagos. Top, made, so creating the need to pro- 
‘modern lines and traditional designs duce new ones. But perhaps that is 
a Sees on another of his schools. .- not the only reason, for continuity 
originates in families of carvers who

know anything about have already 
perished in this way. 
The most ancient and best preserv- 
ed of African works of art are those 
that were made in metal, but even here 
cases are known where old brass

by Ekpo Eyo 
works have been melted down and 
recast. 
In some -cases where the owners 
of these works have tried to take 
care of them and save them from 
destruction, they have been ignorant 
of the scientific means of doing so. 
The people of Tada for instance have 
badly damaged their famous bronzes 
by frequently scrubbing them with 
sand, 
But this is not the greatest danger 
to the preservation of works of art and 
craft. Such danger comes from the 
disintegration of the old social struc- 
ture which was based on indigenous 
religion and a subsistence economy. 
Africans are extremely religious 
people whose lives are marked .at 
every point with rituals’ and ceremo- 
nies. Whether they live in highly 
- organized kingdoms or in simple com- 
munities, individuals, families, lineages, 
villages and kingdoms have their own 
gods whom they consult in time of 
crisis. These gods which are inter- 
mediaries between them and the High 
God are usually sculptured in wood. 
In this way, millions of pieces of 
sculpture were produced.. 
But new converts often demonstrate 
their faith in the new religions by 
destroying those objects which were 
associated with their old faith. 
In 1951, in the Western Region of 
Nigeria, a spiritualist movement known 
as Atinga crossed over from Dahomey 
and persuaded the chiefs and elders 
of the neighbouring Yoruba villages in 
the Egbado Division of Abeokuta Pro- 
vince to allow them to “clean up” 
their villages. 
The Atinga priests claimed that they 
had the power to detect witchcraft 
and those who practise bad medicine. 
In this exercise, thousands of carvings, 
calabashes, metal objects and carved 
ivory, which were associated with 
various indigenous Yoruba religions 
were brought out and set on fire. 
Only part of them was saved, thanks 
to the British District Officer who 
happened to be there and sent word 
to the Department of Antiquities which 
was able to rescue certain important 
pieces. Today the Atinga collection 
forms the largest single collection of 
works of art in the Nigerian museums. 
If Africans have done little to pre- 
serve their works of art and handicraft, 
the awareness in Europe and America 
of the beauty of African art has drain- 
ed the African Continent of most of 
what is left over from the ravages of 
white ants and other factors. From 
the time of the Punitive Expedition 
to Benin in 1897 and the visit of Leo 
Frobenius, Europeans and Americans 
have not ceased to collect any African 
works of art that have come their way. 
It is of course not desirable that 
a nation should keep to herself all her 
works of art, Some of them should 
also be seen in other countries, not 
only for the enjoyment of the ‘people 
in those countries but also” to -make 
possible the’ understanding’ of the cul- 
ture which inspired such works and: 
to. confer prestige “on their country 
of origin. But such transfers ought 
to be carried out legally, which is not 
always the case. 
I. first thing that we must 
do, and some African states are already 
doing it, is to collect and preserve in 
museums, works of art and craft which 
are exposed to the dangers | have 
just outlined. And a museum is not 
only a place in which these objects 
will be safe, but also where they will 
be studied. 
The preservation of works of arts 
and craft from countries undergoing 
rapid development has been discussed 
at three international conferences 
during recent years. At Neuchatel 
in Switzerland in 1961, a meeting of 
museum experts from many parts of 
the world was held with Unesco’s 
assistance to discuss the problems 
of museums and the conservation of 
museum objects from these coun- 
tries. 
The experts noted “the accession 
to independence of many countries 
has brought about increased aware- 
ness of the importance of the national 
heritage and the need for preserving 
it and turning it to account... At the 
same time the developing countries 


### 4581: The Protection of Africa's artistic heritage

THE PROTECTION OF AFRICA’S 
ARTISTIC HERITAGE 
have seen the rapid disappearance of 
their cultural property to the benefit of 
foreign museums and even more to 
that of the antique market... More 
often than not these countries do not 
as yet possess legislation adapted to 
the circumstances, or the scientific 
personnel required for cataloguing, 
collecting and preserving the cultural 
property they want to prevent from 
being exported.” 
The experts also noted that the 
large scale construction works in the 
developing countries resulting from 
rapid economic and industrial expan- 
sion, entail the destruction of cultural 
and particularly archaelogical sites of 
national importance and the suppres- 
sion of traditional cultures over wide 
areas, such as at _the Kariba, Volta 
and Niger Dam areas. 
They. therefore recommended. that 
each country should establish a na-- 
tional service which should draw up 
a list of objects of special value that 
warranted preservation, and should try 
to improve the legal standing of such 
objects which would ensure their phy- 
sical conservation and prohibit their 
export, although the prohibition of 
export should not preclude the lawful 
circulation of these objects. 
In August, 1964, Nigeria played host 
to a seminar on “The Role of Museums 
in Contemporary Africa”, which was 
jointly sponsored by Unesco and 
Nigeria. The late Dr. Paul Coremans, 
the noted Belgian authority, in his 
paper on the physical and chem- 
ical conservation of museum objects 
in the tropics pointed out that various 
types of climate in Africa have a rapid 
and damaging effect, and that the 
ancient objects kept in Africa, which 
are mainly organic, are very sensitive 
to climatic factors. He therefore sug- 
gested that each country should create 
a national service for the preserva- 
tion of its cultural heritage, including 
monuments, sites and museum 
objects. 
He also suggested that within this 
national organization, a technical sec- 
tion should be set up, comprising 
primarily a “cultural laboratory” and 
one or more conservation workshops 
attached to this laboratory.

AFRICA’S ARTISTIC HERITAGE (Continued) 
The emergence of new forms of art 
Finally, the Unesco General Con- 
ference which met in Paris in 1964, 
noting that “cultural property consti- 
tutes a basic element of civilization and 
national culture”, stressed the fact 
that every state should protect cultural 
property within its territory against 
illicit export, import and transfer of 
ownership. 
It recommended the adoption of 
appropriate measures to improve 
international co-operation in tackling 
this problem. Member states were 
advised to take steps to see that 
no import of cultural property is 
authorized until such property has 
been cleared from any restrictions in 
the exporting state. Museums were 
asked not to purchase works obtained 
through illicit export or transfer of 
ownership. 
Among the measures recommended 
by the Unesco Conference were: 
® That each state should set up a 
national service for the protection of 
cultural property. 
® That each state should set up a 
fund or provide other means for the 
repurchase of important works of art. 
Member states were called on to 
collaborate in facilitating the return of 
cultural objects which had been 
illicitly exported. 
Here are some of the steps we in 
Nigeria have taken in the preservation 
of our works of arts and crafts. 
In Nigeria, a law exists to check, and 
if need be to prevent, the export of 
antiquities. One of the definitions of 
an “antiquity” is “any work of art or 
craftwork, including any statue, model- 
led clay figure, figure cast or wrought 
in metal, carving, housepost, door, 
ancestral figure, religious mask, staff, 
drum, bowl, ornament, utensil, wea- 
pon, armour, regalia, manuscripts or 
document, if such work of art craft- 
work is of indigenous origin and: 
® was made or fashioned before 
the year 1918; and 
@® is of historical, artistic of scien- 
tific interest, and is or has been used 
at any time in the performance and 
for the purposes of any traditional 
African ceremony.” 
This definition which may soon be 
modified, is embodied in the Antiqui- 
ties Act of 1953. 
Those who intend to export an anti- 
quity must apply in the first place to 
the Director of Antiquities. If the object 
is found to be an antiquity but not 
very important, the Director of Anti- 
quities is authorized to issue a permit 
for its export. All antiquities are 
photographed and listed so as to 
provide an accurate record of what 
works have left the country. 
For more important antiquities, the 
Antiquities Commission or its sub- 
committee must see and determine by 
agreement whether or not to allow 
export. A would-be exporter is 
required to submit his objects at least 
three months before the date on which 
the antiquities should leave the coun- 
try. In the case of an object for which 
a permit is withheld, the Department 
of Antiquities then offers to purchase 
it at a reasonable valuation. If this 
offer is refused the owner may be 
asked to declare what his intentions 
are concerning its subsequent custody. 
The Department is also engaged in 
a campaign of acquisition of antiquities 
by purchases, loans and excavations. 
In addition, an intelligence system has 
been built up to deal with attempts 
organised overseas to export antiqui- 
ties through local agents. 
Aoven most African 
sculptured objects are religious in 
content, a good percentage of them 
are household, farming and fishing 
equipment based on a subsistence eco- 
nomy. With the introduction of West- 
ern science and technology, the 
economy has become diversified and 
Western products have become the 
new status symbols. 
So a new art has emerged; art which 
is different from the old one both in 
concept and quality. The constant 
demand by the insatiable European 
appetite for exotic art has not produc- 
ed more traditional artists; rather it has 
produced a lot of plagiarists who are 
cashing in on it by unauthorized 
copying of the old forms. The result 
is what Frank Mc Ewen has christened 
“airport art” and what Elsy Leuzinger 
refers to as “works without cultural 
roots or artistic content.” 
There are signs however that we 
may yet rise to the occasion. At Jos 
three years ago, a pilot project was 
jointly established by Unesco and 
Nigeria for the training of African 
museum technicians. Students from 
ten countries attend courses in English 
and French, which include documen- 
tation, photography, chemical conser- 
vation and mechanical repairs of 
museum objects. 
Already three groups of technicians 
have been trained. Technicians, on 
returning to their respective countries, 
not only carry out preservation of 
works of art and crafts, but also sti- 
mulate the interest necessary for their 
appreciation. 
Equally as important as the preser- 
vation of old works of art is the fact 
that African art can be preserved by 
encouraging and patronising contem- 
porary artists. There is a tendency 
among art connoisseurs to regard 
earlier works of art as better than 
contemporary ones, but the latter are 
often equally good. 
There are two categories of contem- 
porary artlsts in Africa today. First, 
there are those who work in the tra- 
ditional style though not necessarily 
from the same religious inspiration. 
This category includes, among others, 
the wood carvers of Nupeland and 
Yorubaland, the cement sculptors of 
the Yorubas and lbibios and the Oyo 
calabash carvers. 
The second category comprises 
those young artists who have had 
training at schools and coileges of 
fine art, therefore making use of 
European techniques and tools but 
deriving their inspiration from their 
traditional surroundings. They pro- 
duce what might be called popular 
art. 
It is not therefore surprising nowa- 
days to find both the sophisticated and 
the ordinary Africans decorating their 
homes with works of art and crafts. 
There is no doubt that with this kind 
of appreciation and patronage the 
future holds out some good promise 
for African works of art and craft, 
The future lies in the awareness 
that our culture and tradition are as 
rich as any other in the world. Since 
the present generation of adult Afri- 
cans appear to have already grown 
away from their tradition and culture 
our only hope rests in the education of 
our children in the African ways of life. 
Ministries of Education should intro- 
duce African studies into the school 
curricula and the universities should 
intensify search for more knowledge 
of the African past. More museums 
should be established where only a 
few or none now exist and craftsmen 
still at work should be encouraged and 
protected. This alone can save the 
African past from obscurity and pre- 
serve our ancient works of arts and 
handicrafts for posterity. 
This strikingly modern African bronze figure, 
a work by the Nigerian sculptor Ben 
Enwonwu, adorns the fagade of the 
museum of Lagos, federal capital 
Nigeria.

### IGNORE

by Ezekiel Mphahlele 
| June 1962 a conference 
of African writers of English expres- 
sion was held at Makerere University 
College in Kampala, Uganda. The 
conference had been called by Mbari 
Writers’ and Artists’ Club of Ibadan, 
sponsored by the Congress for Cultu- 
ral Freedom in Paris. This was the 
first get-together of its kind ever to 
be held anywhere in the world. 
Top on the list of questions posed 
and examined about the African 
authors’ practical problems was the 
not-so-practical one: what constitutes 
African writing? There was an atmo- 
sphere of general surprise, just as if 
the phrase we had used, tossed about, 
identified certain things by, had sud- 
denly got out of hand and turned 
against us with a vengeance. 
Had the phrase “African writing” 
been misused or abused, after all? 
Some participants tried to dismiss the 
question as academic; others felt 
annoyed; others again tried to laugh 
it off or explain it away. But even after 
the more serious attempts to define 
African writing, it stayed on like a 
stubborn white spot on black linen. 
It was generally agreed, rather 
implicitly than explicitly, that we were 
defining such writing in its simplest, 
because emotional, terms: as writing 
produced by black Africans. On reflec- 
tion, certain questions leap up with 
irritating insistence: what about writ- 
ing produced by white Africans? What 
distinguishes so-called African writing 
from non-African? What, for example, 
distinguishes a work by Joyce Cary 
Left, “flying fish”, two 
modern metallic sculptures by M. Calka 
which stand close to

EZEKIEL MPHAHLELE, taught 
English and Afrikaans in a 
Johannesburg high school until 
1957 when he emigrated to 
Nigeria. There he taught Eng- 
lish language and [iterature 
in the Department of Extra- 
Mural Studies at the University 
of Ibadan. He now lectures in 
English Literature at University 
College, Nairobi (Kenya). His 
short stories include two volu- 
mes “Man Must Live" (Cape 
Town 1947) and “The Living 
and the Dead” (Black Orpheus, 
Ibadan, 1960). His autobiogra- 
phy, “Down Second Avenue” 
(Faber and Faber, London, 
0 1959) has been translated into 
eight languages.     
(not African-born) from that by Dan 
Jacobson (African-born) or a work by 
Nadine Gordimer (white South African) 
from one by Thomas Mafolo (South 
African Negro)? Is it theme or style 
or both, or tone or point of view that 
one goes by? 
Joyce Cary was a greater writer than 
any of these whites using the African 
scene, and it is quite clear that he 
identifies himself with neither the 
whites nor the blacks in his novels. 
He writes with a masterly detachment. 
There is a degree of identification in 
which a white writer in Africa like 
Mr. Paton or Miss Gordimer stands in 
relation to the characters and setting 
of his or her stories which indicates 
whether either of them is African. 
In both cases, one can distinctly 
tell that they are on the white side 
of the colour line. For their identifica- 
tion is stronger with the white char- 
acters than with the black. 
This identification is a much closer 
and more intimate relationship than 
the mere espousal of a cause which 
one's characters uphold in the 
context of a story; in other words, 
it is not just sympathy. It is 
a matter of belongingness in relation 
to the group represented by one 
section of characters one is portraying 
and the habitat of that group. What 
holds good for the white writer is true 
in the case of the black one in his 
segregated world. 
This is the distinction between a non- 
African white writer and a white African 
writer on the one hand, and between 
a white and a black African writer on 
the other. 
When we talk of African English writ- 
ing then, | suggest we cannot help 
but discuss literature coming from both 
black and white in the continent. And 
by “black” 1 am including African 
Arabs. But if | insist on the cultural 
context in which we use the phrase, | 
should then take in writing by black 
Africans south of the Sahara, leaving 
out both whites and Arabs. 
It is in this context that Mbari 
summoned the writers to Makerere. 
For the artistic problems facing the 
South African Negro—just to take a 
country that has a plural society—are 
not the same as those confronting the 
white South African: there is little inter- 
course between them, although the 
paint from the one has rubbed off on 
to the other. 
But there are certain sets of values 
common to so many African ethnic 
groups that some South African 
Negroes, say, would not find it difficult 
to enter into the feeling and mood of 
Chinua Achebe's story in Things Fall 
Apart. 1 say some with hesitation 
because | cannot say for sure that the 
most urbanized African in South Africa 
would easily appreciate the story. 
But even if, because of the diversity 
of our colonial experience in Africa, 
and because of our ethnic differences, 
we often find that we do not speak 
on the same wave-length, this very 
colonial experience, the common feel- 
ing among African Negroes that we 
are saying things for ourselves about 
ourselves which used to be the mono- 
poly of the white missionary, the 
anthropologist, the white explorer, and 
even the white administrator—these 
things are sufficient to make all African 
ivcgroes respond to the sound of a 
bell that calls “African writers” to an 
assembly. 
And the phrase “African writing” still 
has a strongly emotional content. A 
white writer might respond intellectual- 
ly, not emotionally, as the blacks do to 
the bell: he is most likely to argue 
himself into such a meeting by saying 
that he is African. Again, there are 
two distinct streams of literary culture

### 6274: Trends in present-day African literature

26 
AFRICAN LITERATURE (Continued) 
‘Committed’ and ‘Uncommitted’ writers 
and consciousness in Africa represent- 
ing black and white respectively. 
Qur contact with whites has given 
birth to a neo-African culture. We can 
really only speak of neo-African culture 
to define the content arising from the 
contact between Western and African 
cultures, rather than the quality or 
intensity of expression; or, as someone 
suggests, the degree of passion in it. 
It expresses itself in many voices and 
modes, as can be seen in South African 
writing and music as distinct from those 
of West and East Africa. Vernacular 
writing in Africa is unequivocally Afri- 
can in the present context. 
African literary forms in English and 
French should in fact be studied in 
the relevant language department. 
John Pepper Clark's, Efua Sutherland's 
and Gabriel Okara's poetry, Wole 
Soyinka's plays, Richard Rive's and 
Alex la Guma's fiction and so on 
should be part of the normal English 
course. So should Birago and David 
Diop’s, Senghor's, and Tamsi's poetry, 
Camara Laye's, Mongo Beti's and Fer- 
dinand Oyono's fiction be studied side 
by side with Flaubert, Baudelaire, Rim- 
baud and so on in the department of 
French. Here African writing is meant 
to be treated simply as literature in 
Africa, and each work will be judged 
on its literary merits. —_— 
It is common for the sociologist to 
disregard literary merit when he is 
doing research into creative writing. 
As a scientist, he rightly argues that it 
is not his business to give an opinion 
on the literary qualities of a book, any 
more than is Wordsworth's interest in 
dissecting flowers reflected in his 
poem, Daffodils. 
in his scholarly book Culture and 
Society, 1780-1950, Raymond Williams 
does not enlist the tools of literary cri- 
ticism for its own sake and then go on 
to establish incidentally the place in 
the tradition of English culture of 
Blake, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Arnold, 
T. S. Eliot and so on, on the basis of 
their creative work. And yet he is, as 
he puts it, “committed to the study of 
actual language: that is to say, to the 
words and sequences of words” used 
by the writers and thinkers to express 
themselves on culture. Mr. Williams's 
samples are either prose statements 
or talkative verse. 
It is significant that there is much 
more creative writing than scholarly 
prose by Negroes in Africa. Perhaps 
it is because a poem or short story or 
a novel are so close to individual expe- 
rience, and therefore more natural 
modes of expression than argumenta- 
tive prose; and, further, because intel- 
lectual systems and the arguments 
involved are not native to Africa. Dis- 
cussion for its own sake or to formulate 
systems of thought in Africa are a 
derivative occupation. 
It is because one learns so much 
about the African from his poetry and 
fiction, e.g: traditional culture and cul- 
ture conflicts and their reconciliation 
or consolidation, that a few over- 
enthusiastic Africanists often sneak 
into the realm of literary judgments 
through the back-door. An African 
novehst or poet is often raised shoul- 
der high for what is taken for literary 
excellence, when all a sociologist 
wants to say of a particular work is 
that it is illuminating or revealing in 
social comment. 
Especially is this the case where a 
non-African views an African work; 
what begins as a natural and perhaps 
even reasonable humility in the contem- 
plator ends up in self-abasement and 
woolly thinking. Often it is a self-aba- 
sement that is symbolized with such 
devastating irony by Camara Laye in 
his brilliant novel Le Regard du Roi 
(translated into English under the title 
The Radiance of the King) when he 
portrays Clarence, the white man, 
trembling before the African king, 
afraid to approach, out of a misplaced 
European sense of sin and shame. 
But there is much in African writing 
to inform the sociologist who has a 
feet for language: especially so be- 
cause there are no literary modes set 
by a local tradition. The modes are 
still as foreign as can be expected 
of a tradition that has originated in the 
metropolitan centres of the former colo- 
nial authority, or is originated by a for- 
eign educator. There is, for example, a 
clear distinction between South African 
Negro and West African writing on the 
one hand, and between the literature 
of the English-speaking and French- 
speaking communities on the other: 
the diction, rhythms, and themes found 
in one region are not common in 
another. 
N a short story, The Bench 
(1), Richard Rive, a Cape Town colour- 
ed writer, tells us about a young man, 
Karlie, who wants to defy the law by 
sitting on a bench marked "Europeans 
Only”. He has been listening to a 
political speech and is fired with the 
zeal to challenge the system that 
segregates people according to colour. 
He will sit on the forbidden bench as 
an act of challenge and therefore one 
of becoming a man. 
Abioseh Nicol, the Sierra Leonean 
short-story writer. tells in his As the 
Night, the Day (2), of a student who 
breaks a thermometer in a laboratory. 
Another student is made to bear the 
blame and is punished. In his bed- 
room in the night the student writes in 
shame and resolves to confess the 
deed to the teacher. For him, also,

Rutherford (Faith Press, London). 
(2) African Treasury, ed. Langston Hughes 
(Gollancz, London). 
this will be an act of becoming a man. 
Here are the relevant extracts, the 
first from Rive's story followed by 
Nicol’s: 
Here was his chance, the bench. 
The railway bench with the legend 
‘Europeans Only" neatly painted on 
it in white. For one moment it sym- 
bolised all the misery of the plural 
South African society. Here was a 
challenge to his rights as a man . . . 
That bench, now, had concentrated 
in it all the evils of a system he 
could not understand. It was an 
obstacle between himself and huma- 
nity. If he sat on it he was a man. 
If he was afraid he denied himself 
membership as a human in a human 
society. Here was his chance . . . 
He seemed perfectly calm when he 
sat down on the bench, but inside 
his heart was thumping wildly. Two 
conflicting ideas throbbed through 
him. The one said, ‘I have no right 
to sit on this bench’; the other said, 
‘Why have | no right to sit on this 
bench? The cone voice spoke of the 
past, of the servile position he had 
oocupied on the farms, of his father 
and his father's father who were 
born black, lived like blacks and

Suddenly, in his little room, under 
his thin cotton sheet, he began to 
cry. ‘Because he felt the sharp lanc- 
ing pain already cutting into him. 
Because of Basu and Simpson and 
the thermometer. For all the things 
he wanted to do and which would 
never happen. For all the good men

Christ, Mohammed, and George 
Washington who never told a lie.

nese man, for Gandhi and for

never be as straight and strong

they should be. He saw, for the

like, becoming a man. He touched 
the edge of an inconsolable eternal

It is a fact of social history that the 
South African character's field of refe- 
rence in the story has a concrete 
physical meaning, and evokes a sense 
of immediacy: “That of his father, 
his father's father who were born black, 
lived like blacks and died like oxen.” 
The West African character's field of 
reference is not so immediate, and is 
conceived in abstract terms. 
In the South African case, there is 
the ever-present condition of oppres- 
sion which releases acute mental and 
physical agony. The writer feels com- 
mitted. Through his impressionistic 
style, in his anger, impatience, through 
the sensuous imagery that he evokes,

From “Ibrahim El Salahi” © Mbari Publications, 
Ibadan, 1962 
In Africa, an ancient world of the arts, 
painters and sculptors in every country 
are creating new forms of expression 
in the visual arts. In many cases 
these artists succeed in combining 
traditional African styles with the latest 
research and techniques in art. This 
drawing is by lbrahim Salahi, a young 
Sudanese artist who, after studying 
at London's Slade School of Ar, 
settled in Khartoum. Characteristic 
of his work is his use of two 
traditional art forms: Arab calligraphy 
and the decorative pattern designs 
on Sudanese baskets and calabashes. 
and the rhythm that reveals a sense 
of urgency, he is trying to come to 
terms with himself and his environ- 
ment, to reject the status quo even 
while he has often to relent in order to 
allow the load to sit easier on his 
shoulder. And this attempt to recon- 
cile disparate emotions helps him, 
paradoxically enough, to retain his 
sanity, to survive. 
On the West African side, things are 
much easier, more leisurely, there is 
more sky, no claustrophobia, and the 
writer can conceive his fictional char- 
acters within the broader context in 
which less immediate and less urgent 
thoughts operate. The rhythm, tempo 
and texture of the prose and the 
  
writer's mood do not display any sense 
of urgency, nor sensuous intensity. 
This is no value judgment but a state- 
ment of fact. For Abioseh Nicol is one 
of the best prose writers in Africa, 
certainly the best in West Africa, using 
English. 
In West Africa alone, English and 
French writing move along different 
tracks, particularly in the realm of 
poetry. The Nigerian poet talks about 
things as they affect him personally 
and immediately. He is not protesting 
or trying to vindicate his blackness. 
The French-speaking poet, however, 
particularly of the negritude school {I 
do not know any who is not of it or 
influenced by it) uses broad symbols 
in which immediacy of individual 
experience is not the important thing. 
These are symbols of Africa, of 
blackness, of what is regarded by the 
poet as African traits which are ex- 
pected to be a unifying force—not 
only for the people of the continent 
but for the Negro world in general. 
Let us look at Leopold Sedar 
Senghor's, Prayer to Masks (1): 
Masks! Oh Masks! 
Black mask, red mask, you black and 
white masks, 
Rectangular masks through whom the 
spirit breathes, 
I greet you in silence! 
And you too, my pantherheaded 
ancestor, 
You guard this place, that is closed 
to any feminine laughter, to any 
mortal smile. 
You purify the air of eternity, here 
where | breathe the air of my father. 
Masks of maskless faces, free from 
dimples and wrinkles, 
You have composed this image, this 
my face that bends over the altar of 
white paper. 
In the name of your image, listen to me! 
Now while the Africa of despotism is 
dying,—it is the agony of a pitiable 
princess 
Just like Europe to whom she is 
connected through the navel, 
Now turn your immobile eyes towards 
your children who 
Have been called 
And who sacrifice their lives like the 
man his last garment 
So that hereafter we may cry ‘hero’ at 
the rebirth of the world being the 
leaven that the white flour needs. 
For who would else teach rhythm to 
the world that has died of machines 
and cannon? 
For who else should ejaculate the cry 
of joy, that arouses the dead and the 
wise in a new dawn? 
Say, who else would return the memory 
of life to men with a torn hope? 
They call us cotton heads, and coffee 
men, and oily men, 
They call us men of death. 
But we are the men of the dance whose 
feet only gain power when they beat 
the hard soil. 
  
(1) Translated into English for Black 
Orpheus, Mbari Publications. 
There is nobility of tone and feeling 
in Senghor's poem. The masks are a 
jumping-off ground for him to point to 
the defects of Europe and its civiliza- 
tion and to the revered features cf 
African culture. The poet's feeling is 
diffused over a wide area. The repre- 
sentative images in the poem are those 
that turn around “You purify the air of 
eternity”. And we know when we read 
it that we shall never really grasp the 
prose meaning of the sentence: it leaps 
from our grip into the metaphysical 
world. : 
The individual is not important here, 
but the object of adoration as a broad 
symbol of what is often called "the 
African essence”. 
Efua Sutherland is the most out- 
standing poet in Ghana and almost the 
only highly individualistic writer in her 
country. The rest of the poets in 
Ghana express nationalist sentiments 
and revive old hurts like slavery, and 
so on. In a poem, Redeemed, Mrs. 
Sutherland shows a sense of urgency 
and individuality typical of the Nigerian 
poets. A man wants to bring to her 
knees a beautiful woman, and crusn 
her as a poisonous snake destroys 
good things. He smells the Eve 
(woman's natural weakness) in her. 
But he is afraid and he recoils, over- 
whelmed by her beauty. The prota- 
gonist says: 
Love I the pillar of your neck 
Governing like a marvel 
The balance of the load of your head, 
Yet | must break it. 
Love I the shine of your skin, 
Yet | must dull it. 
With leprous venom from my spleen. 
He stops short in his designs: 
She paused in a pace, and turned on me 
A soul that speared my reptile frame 
Until I writhed in a helpless coil 
And the poison in me did boil 
And clot in the glare 
From the splendour of her redeemed 
[soul. 
l is a matter of interest 
that even after political independence, 
when colonialism has departed, some 
poets still hammer on the theme of 
African-ness and want to vindicate 
their dignity as Negroes. Are we never 
going to know what the peasant feels 
and thinks as he teeters on the edge 
of a revolution which demands a 
change in his whole mode of living 
because his subsistence economy is 
unproductive? Isn't there something 
to tell about that young man—pathetic 
and comi-tragic—who interprets the 
words of politicians letter for letter 
and thinks that he is called upon to 
strike an attitude of chauvinism, 
entangling himself in all its vocabu- 
lary in the process, never realizing that 
he is out of step with the aspirations 
of his government? How long are our 
poets going to continue bleating like 
a goat in the crisis of giving birth?

AFRICAN LITERATURE (Continued) 
that African literature should be treated 
as part of world literature, and not as 
something specially African; that there 
is in reality only good and bad and 
mediocre writing, whether African, 
Chinese, Mexican and so on; that there 
is a real danger in looking at African 
writing merely as the sociologist’'s gold 
mine. The danger lies in the fact that 
the number of “bleatniks” will increase 
when more of us turn out sociological 
verse and fiction, simply as fodder for 
the Africanist. It is a transitory phase, 
for sure, but it js depressing all the 
same. 
But | have also said that even the 
best of our writing in Africa reflects a 
strong sense of social realism. If, as 
is happening already, African literature 
is used in African Studies because it 
affords the student a glimpse of an 
African's personality in a given social 
climate—a glimpse he cannot find 
elsewhere due to the paucity of schol- 
astic writings by Africans—then the 
sociologist has to go through the mo- 
tions of literary examination such as | 
have intimated earlier on. Rhythm, 
imagery, diction are just as relevant to 
his study as mere theme. 
l an ideal situation only 
vernacular writing belongs in a depart- 
ment of African Studies. In South 
African universities, even the ones 
regarded as entirely or predominantly 
“white”, the three main Bantu lan- 
guages and a fourth minority one have 
been subjects for research and teach- 
ing for at least thirty years, but have 
been media for creative and journalistic 
writing since the middle of the nine- 
teenth century. 
It is hoped that the department of 
African Studies in each university that 
has one will try to stimulate verna- 
cular-literature in this way, among 
others. Above all, it is considered that 
vernacular writers should also take 
part in workshops for those writing in 
English or French. There are after 
all individual techniques in creative 
writing applicable to all languages. 
And if vernacular writers are brought 
into the workshops, they will realize 
that theirs is not an activity apart from 
the mainstream. 
Furthermore, it is important that wri- 
ters in our indigenous languages out- 
grow the school-book mentality by 
which they evidently regard a piece of 
writing as important only if it can be 
understood by school children. Why 
should we not produce a novel in 
Hausa or Swahili or Twi or Ibo or 
Yoruba which has adult ideas and can 
stand critical analysis side by side 
with the fiction of Western and Eas- 
tern languages? 
There are South Africans like A. C. 
Jordan, whose Xhosa novel is a classic, 
Thomas Mofolo, whose Sotho novel, 
Chaka, is also a classic and has been 
translated into English and German: 
Makalo Khaketla and B. Vilakazi have 
done well in their languages. Even 
so, several other vernacular writers in 
South Africa are being published by a 
pro-government white press, which 
seeks to supply literature for school 
use: quite a lucrative racket. The first 
task of an institute of African Studies 
is to correct this senseless if under- 
standable trend. 
Before we were invaded by a money 
economy, by industries which claimed 
enormous migrant labour, the Africans 
activities were guided by a moral or 
immoral purpose, depending on whe- 
ther one deviated from the wishes of 
the group or not. Culture was not 
separate from anything, comprising 
processes which we could speak of 
as a "human court of appeal”. Culture 
was life; each phase marked by initia- 
tion ceremonies was an organic part of 
man's education and moral growth. 
But now mass media like TV, the press, 
advertising, radio, political speechi- 
fying and pampbhleteering, world lite- 
rature—all these are battering at our 
sense of values. Folk cultures are 
giving way to urban cultures. And we 
find ourselves asking ourselves: where 
is the "human court of appeal” to help 
us avoid the awful blunders Europe has 
gone and is going through. 
Some of us feel that we need to 
evoke the essence of human relations 
which is part of our African-ness. And 
some of us build up myths about traits 
in the African as a race. And we seem 
to be asserting features of a culture we 
are not living any more, asserting them 
even while we are in Western metro- 
politan centres taking part in their 
culture. We even refuse to see our 
literature as part of Western tradition, 
and like to believe that we are writing 
in a style that is peculiarly Negro. 
We seem to be losing sight of 
culture as an interpretation of a whole 
way of life, of a common experience. 
We seem to forget that our neo- 
African culture, by its very nature, is 
going to absorb much more of Euro- 
pean techniques—a process that 
should not worry us, really: our writ- 
ing can only be valid if it interprets 
contemporary society in a mode of 
expression that hits on the intellectual, 
emotional and physical planes of 
meaning. What more can you ask of 
a writer, of an artist, of a musician? 
In conclusion, it seems necessary to 
warn against the danger of thinking 
that because we are Africans, we 
should write about the same things and 
adopt the same styles or points of view. 
Culture interests itself in stimulating 
and promoting creative and intellectual 
impulses. It interests itself in indivi 
dual and communal activity. For this 
reason we should allow culture to 
flourish out of the local needs of a 
community. 
Culture should be something to be 
lived rather than merely talked about.

VERNACULAR LANGUAGES 
IN A CHANGING SOCIETY 
| ancunce in African cul- 
ture, occupies a special place all its 
own. Nowhere else, perhaps, has the 
relationship between the vernacular 
and knowledge been accorded so 
important a place or been maintained 
for so long a time. 
Local tradition in Africa has long 
accepted the vernacular as the sole 
means of communication, as the vehicle 
for the transmission of knowledge and 
the medium of thought. In fact, know- 
ledge itself, has always been closely 
identified with the vernacular. 
The African priest or any custodian 
of the wisdom and experience of the 
community who introduces the young 
to his store of knowledge, almost 
always initiates them at the same time 
into the practice of an unknown lan- 
guage. The blacksmith, the saddler 
or the fisherman, and the various trade 
corporations and guilds, in effect, op- 
erate no differently. Their techniques 
cannot be passed on to younger gen- 
erations without the use of special 
formulas. Thus it has not infrequently 
happened that when an African sage 
jealously guarded his knowledge to 
himself or was estranged from society 
for one reason or another, his store 
of knowledge invariably died with him 
or else remained an impenetrable 
secret to those who lived after him. 
The spread of knowledge suffered 
greatly in Africa from this notion which 
equated science with a special lan- 
guage and education with the transfer 
of secret intelligence. 
For centuries the spread of the 
Islamic and Christian religions and cul- 
ture amongst broad sectors of Africa's 
population was blocked by this esoteric 
approach to knowledge. And in the 
past hundred years the introduction of 
modern techniques and ideas as well 
as scientific thinking have similarly 
been seriously hampered. In both 
cases language has played a para- 
mount role in the attempt to change 
or remould society. 
Knowledge can only be understood, 
accepted and propagated if the vehicle 
of transmission is a known language. 
This has been repeatedly pointed out 
by African scholars in the past. Early 
in the 19th century, for example, a 
renowned scholar, Thierno Samba 
Mombeza, from Fouta Djallon (a moun- 
tain region in northern Guinea) stress-

VERNACULAR LANGUAGES (Continued) 
Any language is beautiful... 
ed this point in the introduction to 
his translation into Pular of the Vein 
of Gold, one of the great masterpieces 
of Islamic literature. In reply to those 
who had scorned his undertaking the 
translation of such a great work into 
“a language without nobility”, he 
wrote: 
Whether Arabic or Pular 
Or any other dialect, 
All is noble 
That facilitates human knowledge. 
The Senegalese poet, Moussa Ka, 
who produced one of the major works 
of his time in the Wolof language, 
expressed the same idea as follows: 
Arabic or Wolof, 
Any language is beautiful 
That expresses 
The virtues and Science of Man. 
These references to Arabic should 
not surprise us, for the prestige, 
science and cultural contributions of 
Islam were such that in many parts 
of Africa it was held to be the repos- 
itory of all essential knowledge. Many 
an African generation was spared 
long, weary hours of reciting and 
chanting Koranic texts in Arabic, which 
they did not understand, when schol- 
ars and religious leaders bravely 
undertook to introduce education in 
the vernacular. The translation of the 
Bible into many African languages in 
the last century was inspired by the 
same understanding. 
This is a very important point. It 
reflects the evolution in attitude 
towards modern ideas which took 
place in Africa after it came to be re- 
cognized that the crux of the problem 
was to introduce modern knowledge 
to the greatest number of people. 
It also serves to explain why the 
vernacular languages were gradually 
adopted as indispensable tools for 
teaching in primary schools thus 
avoiding the emotional problems raised 
by removing the child from his lin- 
guistic setting. That is why, too, the 
use of the vernacular in literacy cam- 
paigns and community development 
schemes has been found to offer the 
best chances of success. 
Experiments have long been under 
way in the use of the vernacular for 
technical education and science teach- 
ing, and these have recently gained 
new momentum. 
The road to economic development 
may well lie along these lines: The 
experts have pointed this out; and 
Unesco has stressed it at recent 
meetings on the subject in Ibadan 
(1964), Accra (1965), Yaoundé (1966) 
and Bamako (1965). A meeting of 
African Ministers of Education at |ba- 
dan in February of this year re-affirmed 
the idea, as did the Government of 
Tanzania which has made Swahili its 
national and administrative language. 
The obstacles to such a programme 
are nevertheless tremendous. The 
non-specialist often points to them, 
particularly to the multiplicity of Afri- 
can languages, the need to adapt them 
to the modern world, and their so- 
called lack of “literary” and “scienti- 
fic" vocabulary. 
The multiplicity of Africa's languages 
would seem to be the major obstacle 
to their use for cultural and educa- 
tional programmes. But in point of 
fact, the actual number can only be 
determined after a thorough study 
which clearly distinguishes between a 
language and its local or dialectal 
variants. Any figure based on present 
knowledge is more than likely to be in 
the nature of a guess. 
W. have become so used 
to talking about Africa's countless lan- 
guages that we have lost sight of the 
fact that Africa is, after all, a whole 
continent. A more than cursory exami- 
nation of the languages of this conti- 
nent reveals first, that the number has 
been vastly exaggerated, and second, 
that the situation is hardly different 
elsewhere. Europe posseses dozens of 
languages and dialects; and "Standard 
African” is as much of a misnomer as 
“Universal European” would be. 
French and ltalian exist as separate 
languages, so why not Swahili, Hausa 
and Yoruba? 
Despite the existence of local 
variations, the number of linguistic 
zones in Africa is really quite small. 
Within each zone there is a linguistic 
unity which is not only historical but 
also a living fact. 
Let us take the case of the zone 
comprising the so-called Bantu lan- 
guages. Here we find not various 
distinct and separate languages but 
different dialects of the same language. 
The common features are so extensive 
that one can pass quite easily from 
one dialect to the other. 
To take one example. In the Congo 
practically everyone is multi-lingual. 
In addition to their local dialects, the 
Lari, the Vili, the Bateke, the Bangala 
and the Kikongo all speak Lingala, 
Monokotuba or some other language. 
From the number of dialects the Vili 
of Pointe-Noire understand one might 
assume that they have a special apti- 
tude for foreign languages. A Vili, for 
example, can easily understand or get 
along in Lari, Teke, Swahili and Chilu- 
ba. This is simply explained by the 
fact that they are all dialectal varia- 
tions of one and the same language. 
The slight differences in these dialects 
is evident from the following renditions 
for the word TO EAT: KULIA in Vili; 
KUDIA in Kikongo; KUDIA in Lari; 
KOLIA in Lingala; KULIA in Swahili. 
As can be seen, the differences are 
merely a matter of one consonant or 
vowel, and serve to illustrate the idea 
that the whole Bantu linguistic zone 
could today be unified around one of 
these dialects. As will be shown in 
a moment, this unification would affect 
some 100 million persons. 
What is true of the Bantu linguistic 
zone also applies to other parts of 
Africa. In the Sudanese belt of coun- 
tries stretching across Africa just 
below the Sahara, the same pheno- 
menon can be observed with regard 
to Hausa, the Mandingo language 
group (Bambara, Dioula, Malinke), the 
Akan Baoule languages of Ghana and 
the Ivory Coast, and the Fulani (or 
Pular) languages. 
All over the world a process of 
linguistic unification is now under way. 
In Africa the same thing is happening. 
Differences in speech are being worn 
down, and are giving way to a limited 
number of major languages of commu- 
nication. This is occurring as a result 
of various factors. Urbanization, the 
cultural renascence and the develop- 
ment of great trading centres have 
enabled a few languages to unify whole 
areas. 
This has completely transformed the 
linguistic map of tropical Africa so that 
many of the splinter dialects of the 
past are now being absorbed by about 
a dozen dynamic, hard-core languages 
today sweeping across the continent. 
Some of these languages are now 
spoken by over 50 million people, but 
most are used by groups of 1 million 
to 12 million persons. For example, 
there is the Bantu group, spoken by 
100 million people; Swahili, spoken by 
over 50 million persons in most of East 
Africa (Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Zam- 
bia) and the Kinshasa Congo; the Lin- 
gala - Kikongo - Monokotuba language 
family, spoken by about 30 million 
persons over most of Central Africa 
(Central African Republic, Congo- 
Brazzaville. Cameroon as well as 
Kinshasa Congo). 
The establishment of a common 
language for those who speak Swahili, 
Lingala-Kikongo-Monokotuba, or even 
Shango and certain Bantu dialects of 
South Africa and the Cameroon, is

a task that could well be accomplished 
within the reasonable future. 
The languages of West Africa are 
more varied. Here, Hausa, spoken by 
some 40 million people in Nigeria, 
Niger and Chad, could become a 
unifying element for a vast area of 
Africa. 
Yoruba (Nigeria), Malinke-Dioula 
(Eastern Senegal, Mali, Upper Volta, 
Ivory Coast, Niger), Fulani (Senegal, 
Mali, Guinea, Upper Volta, Niger, 
Nigeria), and Arabic are all linguistic 
groups spoken by from 10 to 15 mil- 
lion people. 
Tamashek (Mauritania, Mali, Niger), 
Ibo (Nigeria), Akan-Baoule-Bulu-Fang 
(Ghana, Ivory Coast), Fon-Ewe-Mina 
(Togo, Dahomey, Ghana), More (Upper 
Volta), Wolof (Senegal), Sarakhule 
(Mali, Mauritania, Senegal), Kanuri 
(Nigeria, Niger, Chad), and Djerma- 
Songhoi (Mali, Niger) also form lin- 
guistic areas in process of unification 
and are spoken by 1 to 5 million 
people. 
Thus we see that a veritable pyra- 
mid of languages exists in West Africa, 
with several languages spoken in the 
same country—in Nigeria, for instance, 
Hausa, Ibo, Yoruba and Kanuri are 
all spoken.

But it is clear that language unifica- 
tion, not dispersal, is the dominant 
factor in Africa today. 
Efforts to try to adapt African 
languages to modern change have 
been in progress for many many years. 
These were given new impetus with 
the establishment of institutions of 
European origin. 
In 1820, a French schoolteacher set 
up West Africa's first secular, bilingual 
school at St. Louis, Senegal, where 
both Wolof and French were taught. 
This pioneer attempt was followed by 
the missionaries who first used African 
languages to spread the Gospel and

Einstein in Wolof, Shakespeare in Swahili 
then gradually introduced them for the 
teaching of a few new techniques in 
agriculture and the crafts. 
The bilingual school in the Congo 
was the outcome of this development. 
In the countries under British rule, a 
similar approach, based on the prin- 
ciple of “native administration”, helped 
the spread of African languages. The 
status and influence of these languages 
can be observed today in the Congo 
(Kinshasa), Uganda and Tanzania. 
These countries, with a literacy rate 
of 45 per cent, have been able to 
establish an excellent political, social 
and technical infra-structure by using 
African languages for their newspa- 
pers, school books and other pub- 
lications. 
The interesting features, here, are 
the new possibilities thus opened. 
The development of a script in Swahili 
hastened the stabilization of the lan- 
guage and its literary growth which 
had begun long before colonization, 
as attested by the Kilwa dating from 
the 17th century as well as an abun- 
dance of other great works of great 
antiquity. 
This. is- equally true of other: African 
languages, particularly those of. West 
Africa, where Fulani.and Wolof litera- 
ture, Hausa works (those by Dan Fodio 
are an outstanding example} and the 
writings of the Kanuri and Dendi chro- 
niclers bear comparison with Swahili. 
Other languages like Lingala or Chi- 
luba are entering the writing stage, 
thanks chiefly to contemporary efforts. 
The adaptation of African languages 
to modern change is not yet very far 
advanced. In this sense most of them 
have not yet become languages of 
advanced scientific knowledge or 
vehicles of modern literature, reflect- 
ing either in original creative works or 
translations from non-African lan- 
guages, the intellectual ferment of con- 
temporary thought. 
Although many attempts have been 
made along these lines, they are 
mainly isolated cases. Nevertheless, a 
number of notable examples by out- 
standing African thinkers can be cited. 
The Senegalese writer, C. Anta Diop, 
has played a pioneer role here. The 
second part of his Nations Négres 
contains a series of chapters which 
illustrate how Wolof can be adapted 
to modern scientific writing. Anta 
Diop chose literary as well as scientific 
themes and produced translations in 
his native tongue of extraordinary 
precision and clarity. His rendering 
into Wolof of Einstein's Theory of Rel- 
ativity as interpreted and explained by 
the French scientist Langevin, is su- 
perb. He also offers us translations 
of poems and excerpts of plays from 
French literature that retain all the 
exquisite beauty of the original. The 
terminology of modern mathematics 
and physics which he uses opens the 
way for elaboration of a modern scien- 
tific culture in the Wolof language. 
Wolof, it is true, is a language with 
a long literary tradition. C. Anta Diop 
makes this abundantly clear in his book 
with a judicious choice of texts. Nev- 
ertheless what he has done for Wolof 
can be done for any language, African 
or not. Even more recently, the Presi- 
dent of Tanzania, Julius Nyerere, dem- 
onstrated the vitality of African lan- 
guages by his series of literary works, 
including a translation of Shakes- 
peare's Julius Caesar. 
Fon all languages there is 
a problem of adaptation, but not of 
adaptability. Linguists know that no 
language lacks the ability to mould 
itself to a new environment. Every 
language has its own built-in system 
that meets. the needs of its -people. 
The integration of new knowledge is a 
matter of vocabulary;-it does not affect 
the system,- whichis’ the structure: of 
the language on which the ‘vocabulary: 
rests. 
Moreover, the need for adaptation 
is not a problem exclusive to the lan- 
guages of Africa. It is a world-wide 
problem. 
Japan established its economic and 
scientific force by assimilating modern 
skills and knowledge into its own 
language, and by introducing new tech- 
niques into its culture to which it gave 
Japanese words or transliterated the 
original foreign ones. 
No language escapes this process. 
Why is there a “Franglais® or a 
“lapenglish” if not because English has 
become the leading language of the 
world as a result of the contribution of 
American science and technology? 
The best answer to the question 
regarding the adaptability of African 
languages to modern change is to 
remind ourselves how easily modern 
techniques are being assimilated into 
African languages. It is a truism that 
people do not accept all foreign words 
indiscriminately. Train, ship, television, 
mathematics, drugs—in a word all the 
elements of the new environment are 
spontaneously translated, especially 
by the women who often find graphic, 
picturesque equivalents for them. 
In Wolof, for example, the word for 
train is saxar, for mathematics wann, 
for drugs garab, all terms drawn from 
the language itself. For words like 
- and this is" encouraging. 
television, radar or atom, common- 
sense operates In Africa as it has in 
Japan, Germany or India, and the same 
words are incorporated into the lan- 
guage with minor modifications or 
none at all. 
Today the great problem in Africa 
is that of translation. School books 
from the primary to the university level 
must be translated to make them 
available to students. This will faci- 
litate the broad diffusion of science 
and technology in Africa. It is easier, 
cheaper and will reach greater num- 
bers. 
A nation's linguistic policy is not 
decided by the individual. The indivi- 
dual can make known his suggestions, 
his desires and his needs; but the final 
word rests with the State. Specialists 
agree that the use of the vernacular 
for literacy campaigns and schooling 
is certainly the best way to show one’s 
regard for the culture and traditions of 
a people, and the most effective for 
making the language the vehicle of 
modern change; but the politician does 
not always see things the same way 
as the specialist. ] 
However, an. increasing number of 
countries .are exhibiting -a’ refreshing 
degree of understanding in this matter,” 
In addition 
to those countries of Africa that have 
traditionally practiced bilingualism bas- 
ed on the use of both an African [an- 
guage and a European one—such as 
Nigeria, Ghana, the Congo Kinshasa, 
Tanzania and Uganda, others like the 
Niger, Guinea and Mali have shown 
new interest in the question. 
Unesco’s programme in Africa which 
gives priority to the question of African 
languages, shows that Unesco is 
keenly aware of this problem and its 
effect on the continent's educational 
and development policy. 
Many details have as yet to be 
worked out in agreement with Unesco’s 
African member countries; but the 
proposals elaborated at the Unesco- 
sponsored Congress of Bamako in 
1965 for the unification of certain Afri- 
can scripts is a step in the right direc- 
tion. 
But the big problem remains that of 
establishing an Institute of African 
Languages, for the training of linguists 
and the preparation of school text- 
books in African languages. 
Broader and more substantial inter- 
national aid would of course be extrem- 
ely valuable for pursuing this problem 
in greater depth, and should offer 
greater opportunities for Africa's scho- 
lars, Africa's statesmen and all of 
Africa's people.

### 7518: Today's schools prepare tomorrow's African scientists

Today's schools prepare 
tomorrow's African scientists 
by N. C. Otieno   
    
  
NICHOLAS C. OTIENO of Kenya is 
a senior lecturer at University College, 
Nairobi, where he teaches mycology and 
phytopathology. He is a member of the 
College Academic Board and of the Senate 
of the University of East Africa. Dr. 
Otieno was first president of the East 
African Academy and is vice-president of 
the International Congress of Africanists. 
He is the author of many scientific studies 
on botanical questions. 
Aa figure in the drama 
of African development is the African 
scientist and the type of education 
he needs. It is not only the quality of 
the scientist—his ability to think critic- 
ally and constructively; his intellectual 
qualities and trained capacities; his 
ability to seek and discover the truth 
—that counts. Equally important are 
the number of scientists that Africa 
can produce within the shortest pos- 
sible time. 
Until now, the number of scientists 
(including doctors, agriculturalists, 
engineers, science teachers and vete- 
rinarians) coming from African univer- 
sities has remained relatively low. 
More students seem to prefer an 
Arts degree, which can lead to a lucra- 
tive government job, to a degree in 
the sciences; many eschew agricul- 
ture which requires working in areas 
with fewer amenities than in the large 
cities; others fail to receive adequate 
scientific and mathematical training in 
their secondary schools; many are not 
attracted by secondary school science 
teaching as a career, thus perpetuat- 
ing a vicious circle which results in 
a shortage of good graduate science 
teachers. 
This appears to be an Africa-wide 
problem. In both Ghana and Nigeria, 
for example, education authorities are 
disturbed by the fact that the number 
of science students has lagged behind 
the numbers admitted to non-science 
courses. In East Africa the need for

of Tanzania, now nearing completion close to Dar es Salaam. Unesco and the United 
Nations Development Programme are contributing to its operation and expansion. 
College is part of the University of East Africa. 
unique in Africa, being composed of three university colleges sited in three countries: 
Founded in 1963, this university is 
at Makerere (Uganda), Nairobi (Kenya) and Dar es Salaam (Tanzania). All three colleges 
have full faculties of arts, social sciences and general science. 
examinations are unified and all degrees are awarded by the University of East Africa. 
AFRICAN SCIENTISTS (Continued) 
37 burgeoning universities 
graduates in the sciences has been 
estimated at just over 50 per cent of 
all students graduating between 1967 
and 1970. Yet for 1966-67, science 
student enrolment in East Africa is 
below 30 per cent of total university 
enrolment. 
In 1962, African states meeting at 
the Unesco Conference on the Deve- 
lopment of Higher Education in Africa, 
at Tananarive (Madagascar) proposed 
that 60 per cent of the estimated stu- 
dent population of 274,000 in Africa's 
universities by 1980 should be stu- 
dents of science and technology. 
The 32 university institutions which 
existed at the time of the Tananarive 
Conference were considered ade- 
quate to supply Africa with the gra- 
duates it would need up to 1980. 
Since 1962, however, five new 
universities have been opened which, 
if provided with sufficient funds, could 
enro! more students and completely 
alter the picture of total graduates 
that would be provided by African 
universities by 1980. 
The five are: University of Lesotho 
and Botswana, University of Asmara 
(Ethiopia), University of Zambia Lusaka 
(Zambia), University “of Malawi (Ma- 
lawi), University of Njala (Sierra 
Leone). 
Another proposal which came from 
Tananarive was that African universi- 
ties should co-operate in teaching at

expensive professional Faculties such 
as Medicine which had already been 
provided for in 11 universities by 
1962. 
To meet East Africa's urgent need 
for more doctors than those which 
Makerere College (Uganda) could pro- 
duce, the intake at Makerere was 
increased from 60 to 90 students 
annually from 1966, and it was also 
decided to open a new medical school 
in Nairobi (Kenya) in 1967 with an 
annual intake of 30. Another medical 
school has been started in Dar es 
Salaam (Tanzania), which is affiliated 
to the University College there, so 
that students are awarded a medical 
diploma of the University of East 
Africa.

### 7518: Today's schools prepare tomorrow's African scientists

The Veterinary Faculty in Nairobi, 
which also has students from Burundi 
and Nigeria, has increased its annual 
intake from 30 to 60. It is proposed 
to open a school of forestry at Make- 
rere within three years, and a school 
of agriculture in Nairobi. The Engi- 
neering Faculty in Nairobi has also 
expanded from an intake of about 
60 students per year to over 100. The 
expansions are made not for the sake 
of prestige, but because East African 
countries desperately need high-level 
manpower for their development. 
The rapid educational expansion in 
East Africa helps to illustrate what is 
going on in other parts of the conti- 
nent. Ghana and Nigeria, certainly, 
must be expanding at much faster 
rates than those that apply to East 
Africa. 
The colonial legacy, whereby Afri- 
can universities had curricula adapted 
to those of the universities of their 
colonial masters, tended to produce 
scientists who were alien to their own 
backgrounds. With the coming of 
independence, English-speaking West 
African universities cut their ties with 
the University of London, and intro- 
duced the West African School Exa- 
mination system which has been 
working out syllabuses for secondary 
schools as well as examinations suited 
to their environment, 
This has increased the number of 
students going from schools to the 
universities and created a flexibility 
which enables university scientific 
curricula to be devised that take cogni- 
sance of the local scene. A similar 
situation has arisen in East Africa 
since independence, following which 
the University of East Africa severed 
its relationship with the University of 
London in 1963, 
The University of East Africa is re- 
designing scientific courses and curri- 
cula to produce graduates with quali- 
fications relevant to East Africa's 
requirements. Education options have 
been introduced into the B.Sc. curri- 
culum so as to produce secondary 
science teachers which countries so 
desperately need. Ministries of Educ- 
ation are also giving more bursaries 
for students following an Education 
Course in the University. In Kenya, 
609% of the bursaries go to students 
taking teaching as a subject within 
their B.Sc. course, 
B has been realized that 
an Africanization of the curricula will 
require research ant the production of 
local textbooks and teaching aids. 
Moves are also being made to esta- 
blish the University of East Africa 
Press to publish works produced by 
this research. 
Although it is accepted that basic 
scientific methods are universal, their 
application in the new publications 
takes account of the resources and 
needs of East Africa. The University 
College, Nairobi is producing a “Flora 
of Highland Kenya" and a “Textbook 
Phytopathology" —among of Tropical 
other books. 
  
It is realized too that Africans alone 
can effectively adapt the curriculum 
to their own needs and aspirations; 
and it is the policy of the University 
and the governments to Africanize 
academic staff as rapidly as possible. 
The Special Lectureship scheme, finan- 
ced by the Rockefeller Foundation, is 
one major move to make this a reality. 
East African governments have fur- 
ther accepted the idea of providing 
postgraduate fellowships to promising 
students to enable them to carry out 
research that would enable them to 
join the teaching staff of the Univer- 
sity. In all these moves, great stress 
is laid on science. 
The training of laboratory techni- 
cians for laboratory departments of 
the Colleges also was started in 1965 
(financed by the Ford Foundation). 
This is designed to put an end to the 
serious shortage of auxiliary staff, 
which places an extra load on the 
university teacher of science and 
tends to divert his energies from the 
essential tasks of teaching and 
research. 
All these expansions have led to an 
expenditure of vast sums for the 
construction of laboratories and 
accommodation for staff and students. 
The University of East Africa, for ins- 
tance, spent nearly £3,500,000 for capi- 
tal construction between 1964 and 
1967. This is expected to rise to 
£6.8 million within three years. A 
substantial proportion of this came 
from external sources. 
Large sums have also been spent 
on laboratory equipment for teaching

MODERN HEALTH SERVICES FOR AFRICA q - 
To reach the modest goal of one doctor 
for every 10,000 people Africa will need 
to train 13,000 doctors in the next ten 
years. Nine countries (Congo-Kinshasa, 
Ghana, Ivory Coast, Madagascar, Nigeria, 
Rwanda, Senegal, Tanzania and Uganda) 
already possess a school of medicine. 
Three other countries (Kenya, Zambia, 
Cameroon) are setting up medical schools.

AFRICAN SCIENTISTS (Continued from page 35) 
and research. All three Colleges, 
however, are faced with the prospect 
of overcrowded laboratories and stu- 
dent accommodation before 1970 if 
more funds are not forthcoming. 
It is evident that if current trends 
in East Africa are symptomatic of what 
is happening elsewhere in Africa, then 
the future of science education and 
the production of the scientists, on 
which Africa so much depends for 
economic development, is assured. 
The new universities, Zambia, Malawi, 
and Njala for example, which are 
setting off on their own without affi- 
liation have a golden opportunity to 
produce curricula uniquely suited to 
their own environments. Universities 
like Dakar which maintain close teach- 
ing links with French universities are 
somewhat difficult to categorize with 
respect to Africanization of staff and 
curricula. 
In addition to universities, there are 
several research institutes which 
employ large numbers of teachers 
from overseas, but these institutes 
look forward ultimately to filling their 
faculties with African university gra- 
duates. 
The East African Agriculture and 
Forestry Research Organization is 
engaged in studies on water control 
and water use for crops, and its plant 
breeding section is trying to increase 
the resistance of crops to pests and 
disease. 
The East African Veterinary Re- 
search Organization does research on 
major animal diseases such as rinder- 
pest for which it has developed effec- 
tive vaccines. It also works on bovine 
pleuropneumonia, tickborne diseases, 
animal physiology and genetics. The 
Pesticides Research Unit concentrates 
on eradication of the mosquito and the 
tse-tse fly as well as control of agri- 
cultural pests and diseases. 
The Trypanosomiasis Research Unit 
is carrying out research to determine 
how sleeping sickness is transmitted 
from wild animals into man and domes- 
tic animals. There is also a Medical 
Research Unit and an Industrial Re- 
search Unit, both of which are engag- 
ed on research of great importance 
to East Africa. Many other kinds of 
research await the scientists whom 
we hope to produce from East African 
universities. 
The whole question of communica- 
tion needs engineers to conduct 
research into highway construction 
under tropical conditions. The Cape 
to Cairo Road, which is being 
constructed step by step, the road from 
East Africa to the Congo, and several 
intercontinental highways can be 
constructed through areas either of 
lateritic rock or the black cotton soil, 
whose properties and behaviour need 
to be thoroughly investigated by our 
scientists if we are to construct major 
roads to encourage trans-African 
trade. Similarly, engineers are needed 
for the construction of our rail system. 
The great dam on the River Volta in 
Ghana is destined to produce vast 
amounts of electricity which in turn 
will generate new industries for which 
great numbers of scientists and tech- 
nologists will be needed in Ghana. At 
present, there is a preponderance of 
technicians from overseas who have 
temporary posts. Ghana will have to 
produce scientists quickly if this 
remarkable construction, and the new 
harbour at Tema, are to change the 
lives of Ghanaians for the better, 
At Kumasi University, the School of 
Pharmacy has conducted outstanding 
research on medicinal plants and has 
produced some unique drugs. 
Other research, through of a diffe- 
rent nature, has been carried out in the 
Biology Department at Haile Selasie 
University, Ethiopia, where scientists 
have discovered natural herbs capable 
of controlling water vectors of some of 
the worst tropical diseases. 
In Ibadan (Nigeria), the Institute of 
African Studies collects information 
appertaining to all branches of know- 
ledge in Africa including scientific 
works, 
Then there are the Academies of 
Sciences in Ghana and East Africa 
which hold symposia and encourage 
members to conduct research on many 
national problems. The East African 
Academy might well become the Na- 
tional Research Council of East Africa, 
advising governments and enabling 
them to formulate co-ordinated re- 
search policies for the progress of 
East Africa. 
There is also the International 
Congress of Africanists in which Afri- 
can scientists with their overseas 
counterparts meet every four years 
to read papers on research appertain- 
ing to Africa that has been conducted 
in any other part of the world. The 
last meeting in Accra was concerned 
with the deficiencies of textbooks in 
African schools and universities. It 
also focussed on the problem of the 
Sahara Desert moving southwards 
towards the Equator. 
All these and many more tasks the 
African scientist must undertake if 
he is to contribute to the eco- 
nomic and social development of his 
continent. It may be hoped that the 
educational programmes and curricula 
in schools and colleges will produce 
scientists equal to this challenge. 
BIRTH OF A NEW AFRICA (Continued from page 8) 
invested capital is the assurance of 
lasting profitability. It is precisely 
because a market offers sure outlets 
for a product that the capital invested 
in that product brings in returns and 
goes on doing so—which is obviously 
the best security of all. 
Great changes in social structures 
are now taking place in Africa. The 
traditional ways are changing under 
the impact of modern economy, new 
ideas and information techniques and 
in consequence of the desire to imitate 
other countries. 
So far as social structures are 
concerned, the two most important 
problems are the rivalry between town 
and country and, in a different sphere, 
a certain conflict between generations. 
This conflict is liable to arise where 
the bulk of the population is still vastly 
out of proportion with the elite and 
when the elite itself stands somewhat 
apart, not fully realizing that its 
destiny is bound up with the general 
development of the generation coming 
after it, and so is in danger of becom- 
ing isolated. 
There is also a clash of culture be- 
cause the generation now bearing the 
greatest responsibilities is not the one 
that has been through the universities. 
On a level with that generation, new 
people are coming forward who have 
been brought up in contact with mod- 
ern ideas, science and culture, and 
who do not always see the problems 
in the same way as their prede- 
cessors. Both sides bear a responsi- 
bility: the older generation should 
avoid a break with the younger people, 
and the younger ones must quickly 
learn where their responsibilities lie, 
and they must be given responsibility 
—practice, as the old saying goes, 
makes perfect. 
In the training of staff, | think Africa 
faces a very great problem, perhaps 
the greatest of all its problems. There 
can be no political, economic or 
cultural development, in the modern 
sense of the term without the training 
of specialists and technicians. 
All countries know this. Sometimes 
we move a little too fast and states 
start to compete with one another, 
each wishing to have its university, 
or its higher education centre, even 
though not always possessing the 
necessary means or the social and 
cultural infrastructure, This may be a 
fault but | think it is a good fault, mere- 
ly indicating how very anxious all Afri- 
can countries are to train competent 
staff as quickly as possible.

letters to the Editor 
APARTHEID IN SOUTH AFRICA 
 
Sir, 
The outstanding interest of your 
number on Apartheid in South Africa 
(March 1967) was enhanced by your 
choice of articles and authors which 
enabled us to view this social evil 
from the inside. The testimony of your 
contributors showed how the system- 
atic policy of racial segregation exerts 
its influence on thought and express- 
ion, on work and ‘religion and how 
it affects culture in general. Apartheid 
is the complete negation of the respect 
for human rights, including the univer- 
sal right to education. 
Michel Vial 
Grenoble, France 
Sir, 
Thankyou for choosing Apartheid as 
the theme of your March 1967 issue. 
It is a major problem of our time 
and one of the most tragic. In my 
view the Unesco Courier is duty bound 
to tell its readers about the distress- 
ing situations in certain countries, 
whether the cause is underdevelopment 
or oppression. 
G. Perra 
Lyon, France 
Sir, 
After reading your number on 
Apartheid | am filled with indignation 
at the ideas you express and your 
biased allegations. 
Naturally, all the plundering and 
massacres of white people in Africa 
count for nothing. But a riot which 
causes some Negro casualties is treat- 
ed as a matter of major importance, 
though care is taken not to describe 
exactly what occurred. 
Obviously it would be better for 
South Africa to follow the same road 
as the Congo... 
To deprive Negroes of a university 
education is a crime. But you do 
not say how the percentage of illite- 
rates in South Africa and Rhodesia 
compares with that of many European 
countries. 
In all African countries the exodus 
of the whites marks a regression in 
living standards and civilization and 
a return to tribalism, savagery and 
corruption. 
They wanted their freedom. Now 
they have it and they must accept 
the consequences. Those reduced 
to begging for their means of exist- 
ence should not accuse the very 
people who have raised them up from 
nothing. Let them show some respect 
for those who have been good 
enough to help them when this has 
meant neglecting the welfare of their 
own countrymen. 
In view of your attitude | am can- 
celling my subscription. 
Jl. Gruault 
Paris, France 
Sir, 
The subject for March 1967— 
Apartheid—would appear to be treat- 
ed in a controversial manner by 
a publication which is issued by an 
organization sustained by govern- 
mental or international funds. Such 
organizations should be apolitical and 
avoid stirring partisan or racial 
prejudice. 
Sufficient to say of the situation in 
South Africa that there would not be 
so large a number of black or white 
immigrants into that country if con- 
ditions were bad. Apartheid—sepa- 
rate development—enables the less 
well-equipped or endowed to find 
opportunity and training within spheres 
to which they are fitted instead of 
competing in spheres where they are 
at a disadvantage through no fault 
of their own. 
South Africa, one of the most 
prosperous and stable countries in the 
world today, gives this opportunity 
denied to the citizens of many other 
countries in Central Africa. 
The content of your March 1967 
number appears to be a criticism and 
a provocation which could create 
discord and bad feeling. Such 
attempts are to be deplored, parti- 
cularly in a publication sponsored by 
a supranational body. May | suggest 
that the Courier be confined to sub- 
jects of cultural and social progress? 
Elizabeth de Bourbel 
London, U.K. 
Sir, 
Bravo for your clear, firm and 
completely objective summing up of 
a situation about which the average 
person is generally ill informed. 
Raymond Vander Elst 
Brussels, Belgium 
READER-CARTOONIST’'S 
THANKS 
  
Sir, 
As a cartoonist and a Unesco Cou- 
rier reader of long standing, | enclose 
two sketches to express my thanks 
for the pleasure that your magazine 
has always given me.

SURVEY OF EUROPE’S 
STAINED-GLASS 
 
  
Sir, 
| read with great pleasure and 
appreciation the attractive pages 
devoted to the Corpus Vitrearum Medii 
Aevi (April 1967). Thankyou for the 
place you have given to this enter- 
prise. It is to be regretted, however, 
that no mention was made of the 
International Council for Philosophy 
and Humanistic Studies which gave 
its full administrative and scientific 
support to the undertaking and served 
as its connecting link with Unesco. 
Apart from this, your pages pay an 
outstanding tribute to what has been 
achieved by this survey of Europe's 
medieval stained-glass windows. 
Jean d’'Ormesson 
Assistant Secretary-General 
International Council for 
Philosophy and Humanistic Studies,

COLONIAL WILLIAMSBURG 
  
Sir, 
The issue of the Unesco Courier 
on the promotion of cultural tourism 
throughout the world (December 1966) 
should offer considérable stimulation 
to the programme for the International 
Tourist Year in 1967, and we appre- 
ciate your reference to Colonial 
Williamsburg as an example of the 
economic impact of historical preser- 
vation on a community. 
| would like to clarify, however, the 
financial background of Colonial 
Williamsburg as an educational, non- 
profit, organization. Through the gene- 
rosity of Mr. John D. Rockefeller, ir., 
Colonial Williamsburg has a unique 
opportunity to provide its visitors a 
significant travel and educational 
experience considérably beyond what 
they pay in return. One result is an 
annual operating deficit which makes 
an implication of “handsome profits” 
here rather far removed from our 
concepts and actual experience. A 
frozen endowment fund, the gift of 
Mr. Rockefeller, Jr., provides an annual 
investment income of over $2,000,000 
with which we meet our deficit. 
Carlisle H. Humelaine 
Williamsburg, Virginia, U.S.A. 
THE RAILWAYS AND TOURISM 
Sir, 
Your article on International Tourism 
{December 1966) has several pertin- 
ent references to the services rendered 
to tourism by different forms of trans- 
port. | am thus very surprised that the 
major role of the railways in develop- 
ing tourism appears to have been 
completely overlooked.
