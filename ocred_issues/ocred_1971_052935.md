Captain from Capestrano 
Standing over two metres (six and a half ft.) high, this effigy of a Samnite leader was unearth- 
ed at Capestrano, an Abruzzi township on the eastern slopes of the Apennines in ltaly 
(photo shows bust). The Samnites, one of the ancient Italic peoples, came from the East 
and after settling in the mountains at the centre of the peninsula, harassed Rome and Latium 
until the 3rd century B.C. Carved in stone and dating from the 6th century B.C., the statue 
retains traces of red colouring. It was recovered in 1934 from a burial ground containing 
33 tombs. The figure’'s broad-brimmed headgear, axe, sword and dagger are the attributes 
of a chieftain. the highly stylized face suggests, and may well be, a mask. The inscription 
in Oscan characters on the pillars flanking the statue are as yet undeciphered, and may 
record the name of this “Captain from Capestrano.”

HEMISTRY, like all science 
and technology, has an ambivalent 
status in society today. On the one 
hand, it is acknowledged that it has 
enabled man to survive and flourish 
on our overcrowded planet. Men and 
women in advanced industrial nations 
are using chemistry to defend and 
extend the material benefits that derive 
from increasing human predominance 
over the rest of nature. At the same 
time, the people of less developed 
countries are striving after the pro- 
ducts of modern chemistry that can 
make their lives more healthy, com- 
fortable and productive. 
And yet, there are many who decry 
chemistry as the cause of undesirable 
qualities of modern life. In an explo- 
sion of irrational compulsion to con-

### 188341: The Magic of modern chemistry

THE MAGIC 
OF MODERN 
CHEMISTRY 
  
demn those very intellectual, scienti- 
fic and technological endeavours that 
have enabled modern man to rise from 
savagery, chemistry has been blamed 
for all manner of treachery against the 
quality of life. 
But denial of the humane value of 
scientific knowledge and obstacles to 
its wise use for the benefit of mankind 
are by no means unique to our times. 
History is replete with records of 
opposition to scientific inquiry and the 
introduction of new technologies that 
challenged old beliefs, threatened esta- 
blished institutions and changed pat- 
terns of life. 
Antoine Lavoisier, Nicolas Leblanc 
and Joseph Priestley—who along with 
Henry Cavendish were the founders 
of modern chemistry—are classic 
examples of scientists who were 
opposed and suppressed by irrational 
prejudice. 
Fortunately, nowadays these men 
are granted their due credit for having 
opened the doors to a whole new field 
of science which has since led to the 
development of one of the key indus- 
tries of our technological world— 
making products used in practically 
every aspect of life. 
Still, as we enter the post-industrial, 
or technetronic, era, we hear politi- 
cians deploring, much as did those 
leaders of the French Revolution who 
Towards a new 
quality of life 
sent Lavoisier to the guillotine, that 
“today we stand helpless before the 
onslaught of science.” 
Similarly, there are those intellectual 
Luddites who would destroy the very 
edifice of human progress by forcing 
scientists to answer the question of 
what impact their achievements will 
have upon the quality of life. 
While it would seem to be self-evi- 
dent that the Swiss inventor of LSD 
could no more predict the abuse 
others would make of his breakthrough 
in the development of psycho-active 
drugs than Henry Ford could have 
foreseen, or been held accountable for 
the death and maiming of countless 
ten of thousands of people in automo- 
bile accidents, the nature and the moti- 
ves of the scientist, hardly so well un- 
derstood as those of the inventor, are 
called in question. The scientist, ra- 
ther than the malefactor, is held res- 
ponsible. 
Here, indeed, may be the root of the 
problem, Because the layman does 
not understand the mysteries of com- 
plex science and has seemingly less 
contro! over its products than he has 
over the motor car, fear and suspicion 
of science have replaced the curiosity 
and active interest in scientific advan- 
cement that was the hallmark of the 
two centuries of phenomenal progress 
between 1750 and 1950. 
But because of the vital role played

### 188341: The Magic of modern chemistry

MODERN CHEMISTRY (Continued) 
by science in modern society, its rejec- 
tion in some quarters as a means for 
improving the quality of life could 
have especially serious social! conse- 
quences. Clearly, if the 7,000 million 
people who will inhabit the globe in 
* the year 2000 A.D. are to be adequa- 
tely fed, clothed, housed, educated, 
informed, transported and purposefully 
employed—in short, if they are to be 
masters of their environment rather 
than its slaves—it will be only through 
the instrumentality of applied science 
and that form of human activity we 
know as industry. 
This increasing power to change the 
physical world around us, to fulfil hu- 
man needs and aspirations, is due in 
large part to the science of chemistry 
and the industry which translates its 
findings into new and better products. 
We can divide the needs of human 
beings in society into four grades of 
urgency to each of which chemistry 
makes a critical and frequently central 
contribution. 
First of all, there are the primary 
biological needs of food, shelter, 
health and recreation. Then there are 
the means for providing these require- 
ments: productive industry, communi- 
cations and transportation. Social and 
economic structures are then neces- 
sary to maintain balance and provide 
the necessary ambient conditions for 
human fulfilment. Finally, man takes 
cognizance of himself and at the same 
time expresses himself through what 
may be called his culture: in manners, 
art and intellectual endeavour. 
Quite obviously, it is in meeting the 
first two sets of human needs, those 
basic physiological needs which sustain 
life and society, that chemistry plays 
the greatest part. But, along with 
other sciences, chemistry is also an 
agent of social and economic change; 
and both as an operative science and 
by the image it presents, chemistry is 
A - fn 205, 
be 
ie —

an essential factor in the manners and 
cultural activity of men. 
At the beginning of the 1970s, the 
average citizen of an industrially ad- 
vanced country was using from 300 to 
500 chemical products in his everyday 
life: about 60 in his clothing, some 200 
in his home, office and automobile; 
another 50 in medicines to safeguard 
his health, and still another 50 or 
more at every stage of producing and 
preparing the food he consumes. 
There is hardly an activity of modern 
man that does not, in some way, use 
some of the nearly one million chem- 
icals that exist today. 
HE list continues to grow 
every year. In the U.S. alone, more 
than 500 totally new chemicals are 
introduced commercially each year, 
while in the city of Basel alone, 3,500 
scientists spend almost $150 million 
annually in research and development 
of medicines, dyestuffs, plastics, agri- 
cultural chemicals, cosmetics and a 
wide variety of other products all des- 
tined to meet human needs in 1985 
and in 2000 A.D. 
If half of today's chemical production 
consists of products which were not 
in existence ten years ago, by 1985 a 
whole new generation of chemical 
products will have been developed and 
before the turn of the century still 
another generation will have made its 
appearance, 
While in the 1960s in most advanced 
countries the chemical industry was 
fourth in rank after petroleum, primary 
metals and transportation equipment, by 
1985 it will have surpassed primary me- 
tals, and very possibly it will be the 
leading industry along with elettronics 
in the year 2000. Here are just a few 
of the reasons why. 
If we are to produce enough food 
  
in. 1985 to feed the world, the United 
Nations Food and Agriculture Orga- 
nization estimates that in developing 
countries alone consumption of ferti- 
lizers and crop protection chemicals 
must be at about 12 times the 1962 
rate; and by the year 2000 consumption 
will have increased another eight to 
ten times over the 1985 level. 
Parallel to the demands for an in- 
creased supply of foodstuffs for the 
world’s population there will be a rise 
in clothing needs which, as prosperity 
increases, is expected to be dispro- 
portionate to the increased consump- 
tion of food products. However, since 
for climatic and regional reasons the 
production of wool and cotton has 
already reached its maximum level, 
clothing needs must be met almost 
entirely from increases in production 
of cellulose and fully synthetic fibres. 
Annual world production of cellulose 
fibres, now running at a level of 
3.5 million metric tons, will grow to 
more than seven million metric tons by 
the turn of the millenium. Even more 
remarkable, the production of synthetic 
fibres is expected to grow from a cur- 
rent three million metric tons to an 
estimated 25 million metric tons by the 
year 2000. 
During the same period, the value of 
plastics output for consumer, cons- 
truction and industrial applications will 
far outstrip that of steel production, 
as the introduction of a wide variety 
of composite materials combine, for 
instance, the great strength of pure 
crystals of metals with the elasticity 
or other qualities of organic chemicals. 
This incipient “materials revolution” 
will make possible an enormous num- 
ber of new products, new satisfactions 
and new markets; it will advance man 
one more step along the road of inde- 
pendence from nature and control over 
his environment to the adequate satis- 
faction of primary human needs.

MODERN CHEMISTRY (Continued) 
  
F you polled the earth's 
population, there would be no question 
about the most critical problem in the 
world today; clearly, it is how do we 
get enough of the right food to eat. 
While it is easy to overdramatize the 
tragic character of the world's present 
food situation, it is also possible to 
assess the needs of the present popu- 
lation and any future world population. 
This ability to comprehend, measure 
and predict with some degree of 
probable accuracy the food needs of 
humanity, as was recently undertaken 
in the FAO Provisional Indicative 
World Plan, makes it possible within 
the scope of available technology to 
construct a system of production and 
distribution in which those needs 
would find satisfaction. 
To be sure, taken at face value, food 
statistics can be brutal. Food supply 
is at present adequate only in 30 in- 
dustrialized nations in the temperate 
Northern area, where 900 million 
people live. But in 70 other less 
developed countries, the diets of 
1,900 million people are nutritionally 
inadequate, chronic malnutrition is 
widespread, and thousands still die 
from hunger every year. Moreover, 
before these countries can possibly 
make much progress economically or 
socially, they must have better diets 
to sustain the necessary effort. 
Until the latter years of the 1960s, 
population in all developing countries 
was growing faster than the increase 
in food production. If this were to 
continue, alarmists claimed, we would 
be confronted with world famine by 
1975. Then came the “green revolu- 
tion”, with a veritable takeoff in wheat 
production in "Mexico and Pakistan, 
followed by sharp increases in rice 
production in south-east Asia. 
Suddenly, what scientists instinctive- 
ly. if not empirically, knew all along 
began gaining some degree of popular 
credence: we can, after all, feed the 
present and foreseeable population 
of the earth, New technology has

brought new hope to developing 
countries that there will be enough for 
all to eat in this generation. 
Once improved varieties of cereals 
had been developed, much of what 
had to be done was the task of chem- 
icals plus’ the proper increments of 
water applied at the right time and 
places. 
In 1840 the pioneering German 
agrichemist Justus von Liebig formul- 
ated his basic theory on plant nutrition: 
any plant requires a certain amount 
of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium 
in a soluble form in order to secure 
its growth, and these three essential 
elements can neither be replaced by 
others nor are they interchangeable. 
While the scientific work of Liebig 
had an immediate effect on the pro- 
motion of the phosphate and potas-

* Miracle proteins for wheat and corn 
sium industries, the amount of soluble 
nitrogen compounds from natural 
deposits turned out to be insufficient 
and all efforts to convert the nitrogen 
content of air into suitable compounds 
had failed. 
Then came the dramatic appeal in 
1898 of Sir William Crookes, in his 
now-famous lecture at Bristol, to 
chemists all over the world to develop 
a method for the fixation of the nitro- 
gen content of air. He made it clear 
that the spectre of general famine 
would not be banished as long as 
there remained an inadequate supply 
of nitrogenous mineral fertilizers and 
that this supply could not come from 
the technologies and production 
facilities then available.

under high pressure of the nitrogen 
contained in air to form ammonia, the 
amount of nitrogen production in the 
world became the decisive factor for 
the increased volume of food pro- 
duction, helped by mineral fertilizers. 
Over the last hundred years, by 
the gradual application of new soil 
treatment technology, Germany has 
increased yield per hectare of both 
wheat and potatoes over four times. 
But the potential improvement from 
fertilizers is far from being fully 
developed even in the most advanced 
countries. Complete fertilizers which 
contain in one application all the ele- 
ments for plant growth in the correct 
combination are being developed. 
Despite the advances in fertilizer 
technology over the past century, 
there still persists among some 
seemingly knowledgeable people the 
extraordinarily erroneous notion that 
any further additions to the world’s 
area of cultivated land must be 
very limited. Even in the very cau- 
tious view of the late Sir Dudley 
Stamp, mid-twentieth century man was 
working only about one-third of the 
world’s potential agricultural land. 
With intensive use of fertilizers and 
other available improved techniques 
of cultivation, as practised in the 
Netherlands and Japan, the potential 
agricultural area of the world could 
provide food at maximum consumption 
standards for 35,000 million people, 
or over ten times the world's 
present population—without allowing 
for further improvements in technol- 
ogy or further increases in food from 
the sea. 
Fertilizer use is on the threshold of 
making an important breakthrough in 
forestry and fisheries, conserving and 
developing these resources to the 
better long-run service of humanity in 
Microbes that devour garbage and 
convert it into protein-rich animal fodder 
could help relieve the world’s growing 
refuse disposal problem. Right, 
Dr. W. Dexter Bellamy, a biochemist 
at one of New York’s large research 
and development centres, has identified 
bacteria that can digest cellulose 
and related chemical compounds 
which together account for most of 
the solid wastes produced by large cities. 
Fertilizers are the key to making poor 
soils produce economic crop yields, 
and slow-acting fertilizers, now coming 
on the market, avoid over-dosing and 
require only one application during the 
entire growth cycle. New farming 
techniques combined with modern 
chemical fertilizers offer hope to 
developing countries of providing enough 
to eat for all within this generation.

an evolving balance of man and 
nature. 
In Bulgaria, systematic application 
of fertilizers in the controlled atmo- 
sphere of large 50-hectare glassed- 
in greenhouse farms, has enabled 
that country to emerge as one of 
Western Europe's primary year-around 
suppliers of vegetables. 
In the early 1960s, Carl N. Hodges, 
a graduate student from the University 
of Arizona, developed a special 
research facility at Puerto Penasco, 
Mexico. He did so by combining fresh 
water, produced from the sea by a new 
technology in solar desalination, and 
carbon dioxide, from diesel engines, 
with proper inputs of soil nutrients. 
In this facility, housed in controlled- 
environment greenhouses of air-inflat- 
ed polyethylene film, 160 varieties of 
18 vegetables and fruits have been 
grown. 
Results achieved by this synergistic 
combination of products of modern 
chemistry, which produced higher 
yields of at least one variety of each 
fruit and vegetable tested than nor- 
mally obtain in field crops, had imme- 
diate revolutionary implications for 
desert areas of the world with access 
to ocean or brackish ground water. 
The first large-scale “portable” farm 
using the results of a new University 
of Arizona Environmental Research 
Laboratory under Hodges’ super- 
vision was, understandably enough, 
developed for the Arabian Gulf 
Sheikhdom of Abu Dhabi about 
500 miles south of Kuwait. Production 
cost of vegetables grown, allowing for 
a 10-year amortization cost of the 
installation, is running about 20 cents 
(US) a pound, compared with an aver- 
age $1.50 or more a pound at retail 
for produce shipped from Kuwait. 
Already, half of the world's popula- 
tion is fed by the extra yield that is 
produced by the use of commercial 
fertilizers, now being consumed at the 
rate of 27 million metric tons annually. 
To be able to feed properly the popula- 
tion expected by the year 2000, fully 
utilizing new agrichemistry technology 
as it develops, it will be necessary to 
increase world production to 90- 
95 million metric tons a year. 
With the use of natural gas and 
mineral oil fractions as the raw 
material source for the needed 
hydrogen, the necessary fertilizer 
factories could, in principle, be erected 
directly in the various markets through- 
out the world. With the present 
level of technology this will require 
capital expenditures of $33,000 million 
at 1970 prices to meet the needs up 
to the end of the century. 
But this is only the beginning of 
chemistry's contribution to the poten- 
tially abundant food supplies of the 
future. As man strives to produce 
more food for 60 million new mouths 
each year, he creates field conditions 
that encourage the zooming multiplica- 
tion of more than 10,000 species of 
insects who compete for a food supply 
not yet adequate to assure a minimum 
diet for all. 
It has been said, perhaps with some 
exaggeration, that we humans can 
feed only on what is left over for us 
by pests. Somewhat more precisely, 
expert estimates made in the 1960s 
by six different authorities put total 
food losses from pests at between 
$30,000 and $60,000 million, with a 
leaning toward the higher figure. 
Some calculations have put the 
losses due to bugs and weeds even 
higher: a minimum of $70,000 million 
is currently Jost, with insects account- 
ing for losses of approximately 12 per 
cent, plant diseases for 12 per cent,

LOCUST LEFTOVERS. It has been said that humans feed on what 
is left over by the pests, and a single locust with its powerful 
jaws devours its own weight in food each day. A swarm of 
locusts will eat between 30,000 and 100,000 tons of vegetation in 
twenty-four hours. Despite the current controversy about DDT 
and other chemical pesticides, it is still an open question as to 
whether they are as harmful as many people think. A top 
official of the Food and Agriculture Organization stated recently 
that ** millions would starve without chemical defences against 
insects **, and the World Health Organization has defended the 
use of DDT as indispensable at the present time to combat 
malaria-bearing mosquitoes.

DDT from A to Z 
and weeds for 10 per cent of potential 
production. And these losses are 
suffered even with the widespread 
use of pesticidal tools now available. 
Dr. Herrel DeGraffe, Cornell Uni- 
versity nutritionist, estimates that if 
we were to eliminate chemicals in 
food production about one-third of the 
world’s people would not eat at all. 
“Millions would starve without chemi- 
cal defences against insects,” a top 
ranking FAO official said recently. 
Even in the United States, where 
food surpluses have bugged econo- 
mists and policy-makers for over a 
quarter of a century, without chemical 
pesticides, food supply would have to 
be rationed; housewives would have 
to queue to buy inferior foods, and 
they would pay 25 per cent more for 
them. 
Although fighting against tremendous 
odds, man has been resourceful 
enough to eliminate weeds that 
compete with food plants for nourish- 
ment from the soil and to fight 
off persistent hordes of insects. 
Throughout the ages he has sought 
new weapons to increase his advan- 
tage over insects in the competition 
for food. 
Gradually, with the advent of an in- 
dustry specialized in the production of 
pesticides, magic spells, waving fans 
and flails wielded by weary slaves, 
the only weapons early man could 
command in his war with bugs, were 
replaced by over 200 efficient and 
safe chemical compounds which have 
now seemingly tipped the scales of 
battle in favour of homo sapiens. 
As a result, in Japan, where pesti- 
cides usage per hectare of crop is 
more than five times that of Europe 
and North America, yields per hectare 
are almost twice those of Europe and 
more than double those of the U.S. 
Loss from insect damage to rice is 
estimated to average only 1.5 per cent 
as a result of a continuing vigorous 
pest control campaign, where damage 
inflicted by the stem borer caused 
losses of 50-60 per cent in South 
Japan in five years out of ten up to 
thirty years ago. 
IMILAR advances in dis- 
ease control in Japanese rice crops 
have resulted from the general use of 
fungicides, particularly for seed treat- 
ment. These chemical defences, along 
with improved seeds, have transformed 
Japan from a chronic major food deficit 
area to a country of food surpluses in 
the short span of 25 years, at a time 
when the exodus from rural areas to 
the cities reduced agricultural man-

power from 47 per cent to 19 per cent 
of the labour force. 
While rice production was a mode- 
rate 3.63 tons per hectare before 
World War ll, it rose to 5.02 tons per 
hectare in the mid-1970s, compared 
with ¢- meagre 1.4 tons per hectare 
output in India and 1.3 tons per hectare 
in the Philippines—or about the level 
of output already attained in Japan 
by the 16th century. 
Despite these low yields, statistics 
indicate that the use of pesticides to 
eliminate storage losses alone could 
go far toward rendering India self- 
sufficient in cereal grains at current 
rates of consumption. Losses of main 
cereals during storage exceeded 5 mil- 
lion tons in India during 1962-64, or 
reughly a million tons higher than the 
country’s entire food-grain imports 
in 1962. 
Despite the urgent need for more 
effective protection of pre- and post- 
harvest losses from pests, diseases 
and weeds, and the demonstrable 
profitability of efficient crop protection 
operations, farmers in most countries 
often still regard such damage as 
something to be endured but not 
cured, in the same manner as floods, 
droughts, hurricanes and other natural 
hazards. 
T the same time, some 
gifted polemicists, with an emotional, 
romantic and mystical bent, have 
effectively managed to persuade many 
people, including some public officials, 
that pesticides—especially DDT—are 
dangerous and should be banned. 
Contrary to many reports, no-one 
has yet been harmed in any way by 
residues of crop protection products. 
All these substances, if taken in 
sufficient dosages, can be lethal. 
But only a few pesticidal chemicals 
ever reach man's body, and then only 
in minute traces—except by accident, 
suicide or murder. 
Yet panic caused by current wides- 
pread denunciation of DDT and other 
pesticides has resulted in premature 
measures to restrict its use, with 
resultant reversals of results obtained 
by expensive campaigns to conquer 
malaria and eradicate other pests. 
On the whole, despite increasing 
efforts to develop suitable biological 
methods of control, FAO and WHO 
warn that there are as yet few alter- 
natives to destroying pests by chemi- 
cal means. FAO plant protection 
experts say specifically that “in the 
developed world the great DDT 
controversy is largely an irrelevancy. 
it (DDT) is going out because so many 
insect pests are developing resistance 
to it and because better and more 
refined control methods are becoming 
available. 
“In the developing world the situa- 
tion is more difficult. There is no 
other pesticide available that is still 
effective against so many insects, that 
is non-toxic to man and that is so 
cheap. The developing world simply 
cannot abandon DDT at present 
although it will in the future begin to 
benefit from the new methods of pest 
control being developed in the more 
technologically advanced countries.” 
Any major change in the established 
agro-ecosystem tends to disturb the 
complex crop-pest equilibrium, causing 
minor or relatively stable incidences 
of pest and diseases to erupt suddenly 
as major outbreaks. Many of the 
measures taken during the coming 
years to improve agricultural product- 
ivity in developing countries will in- 
evitably alter the environment, often 
creating more favourable conditions 
for pests. Crop protection, in all its 
aspects, therefore, will assume rapidly 
increasing importance in developing 
countries during the next two decades. 
Fortunately, there are signs of 
rapidly changing attitudes toward pest 
control amongst farmers. Imports of 
pesticides in 1965 by India and Taiwan 
were three times the 1961-63 average, 
while imports of the Republic of Korea, 
Pakistan and Thailand doubled in the 
same period. Even more dramatic 
increases have been reported since 
1966 from South Asia, where the gross 
area covered by plant protection 
measures had increased five times in 
India in the four years 1965-1969 and 
pesticides imports by Ceylon jumped 
175 per cent in 1967 alone. For all 
developing countries, FAO estimates 
pesticide requirements in 1985 at 
$2,000 million per year, compared with 
consumption of only $180 million 
in 1962, 
New technology will alter this 
estimate over time, however. Insecti- 
cides derived from phosphoric acid 
esters, already available commercially 
under various brand names, will gain 
in importance during the next few 
decades, whereas use of chlorinated 
hydrocarbons such as DDT will be 
progressively receding. 
At the same time, the increasing 
use of selective herbicides, one of 
the most striking post-war phenomena 
in crop protection, is to be expected 
in developing countries in coming 
years. The net efficiency of these 
herbicides is considerable, achieving 
yield increases of up to 30 per cent 
by their timely use in temperate zones, 
and even over 50 per cent in some 
tropical countries. 
Equally important, the introduction 
of the so-called “systemic” chemicals 
—a new generation of non-persistent 
pesticides which enter the vascular 
system of the plant, spread their 
protection throughout, and then meta- 
bolize into harmless degradation pro- 
ducts—is expected to save Britain, for 
instance, some £40-50 million worth of 
cereal grains per year by eliminating 
powdery mildew—a ° disease that 
regularly causes losses of up to 15 per 
cent of grain yields in the UK. 
While chemistry is to play the 
major role in increasing agricultural 
output during the next three decades, 
a tremendous increase in protein 
value of world cereal supplies can be 
achieved within a few years by the 
use of synthetic amino acid additives. 
Methods have been developed for 
enriching wheat with lysine, corn and 
sorghum with lysine and tryptophan, 
and legume-based foods with methio- 
nine—either before milling or by 
introduction into flours and meals. 
Increases of more than 50 per cent 
in wheat protein value can be achiev- 
ed by the addition of no more than 
0.4 per cent lysine, while appropriate 
additions of lysine and tryptophan to 
corn approximately doubles the utiliz- 
able protein. Major food-producing 
countries have found soybean meal 
fortified with methionine most econo- 
mical as a major protein source for 
poultry and swine rations. Similarly, 
developing countries in which legumes 
are used on a large scale for animal 
feeding, as well as for human con- 
sumption, can boost protein avail- 
ability sharply at relatively low costs 
by incremental applications of these 
amino acid additives. 
All essential amino acids are now 
produced in chemically pure form, 
although for some production costs 
are still extremely high. As costs 
decrease with their increasing use in 
fortification of natural foods and 
synthetic processes are developed 
further, it should be feasible before 
the end of the century to combine 
these into palatable synthetic foods 
fully satisfying the protein require- 
ments of man, 
UT chemistry has develop- 
ed still other means of providing 
animals, fowl and fish with industrially 
produced proteins to supplement their 
normal diet, increasing the quality and 
yield of food from these sources. 
Yeast products derived from mineral 
oil, while as yet unsuitable for human 
nutrition, can be used as components 
in the manufacture of concentrated 
animal and poultry feeds. 
Experimental efforts by more than 
a score of multinational petroleum 
companies to use petroleums as a 
feedstock for yeast production have 
established the technical feasibility. 
One of the companies, British Petro- 
leum, brought a plant on stream in 
1970 which is expected to produce 
16,000 tons of protein a year. The 
Soviet Union, chronically short of 
feedstuffs, is also producing single- 
cell protein (SCP) of feed quality on 
a limited scale, while Japan is moving 
rapidly toward large-scale commercial 
production—expecting to produce 
more than 300,000 tons yearly by the 
end of 1971, 
Should this technology become as 
firmly established as those investing 
huge sums in its development believe

MODERN CHEMISTRY (Continued) 
it will, it is bound to have far-reaching 
impiications for conventional animal- 
husbandry and for agriculture as well. 
While presently conceived as a feed 
supplement, it may come to compete 
with grain feeds in animal diet and 
even to alter human eating habits as 
well. 
How ironic that would be: photo- 
synthesis, occurring eons ago, produc- 
ed plant life that was eventually 
converted into petroleum; now petro- 
leum chemistry has made it possible 
for that solar energy to compete with 
products of photosynthesis occurring 
on our farms in the production of food 
for man today. 
But this irony deserves more than 
passing observation. While it may be 
hard to believe in an age marked by 
hysteria about the prospects of world- 
wide famine, just as the process of 
industrialization will transform the 
economies of all developing countries, 
food surpluses—rather than food 
shortages—are likely to be the major 
problem of the future. 
In both Western Europe and North 
America food surpluses, even in this 
age of relative global food deficiency, 
challenge the distribution capabilities 
of business and governments alike. 
How much more complex the problem 
will be if magnified on a global scale. 
Here, too, modern chemistry has a 
critical role to play. Sterilization, 
refrigeration and cryogenization, co- 
louring, flavouring and packaging all 
depend upon the availability of new 
and improved chemical products. 
Applied chemistry also promises new 
materials for construction and power 
sources that promise to facilitate the 
task of storage and transport of food 
under conditions and at costs which 
will assure its availability to consumers 
in all countries. 
If, then, the industrial revolution can 
be said to be little more than a massive 
breakthrough in agriculture, chemistry 
takes primacy of place as a force for 
change. And if the benefits of this 
revolution are to be made available to 
those countries still relatively un- 
touched by this progress, in the 
remaining years of this century, 
organic chemistry, biochemistry and 
microbiology—the scientific triumvirate 
which powers the modern chemical 
industry—are destined to play a major 
role. 
Only the radical progress in these 
fields can explain the dramatic turn- 
around in prospects for world agri- 
culture in the last five years. 
In a host of countries throughout 
the world the agricultural revolution 
suddenly shifted to the takeoff stage. 
This was a dual revolution; a revolu- 
tion of new techniques at critical 
stages of the food-raising and pre- 
serving process, and a revolution in 
the sense that known techniques long 
held back by a variety of political and 
social barriers are now being made 
available to the less developed parts 
of the world.

of modern discoveries in chemistry 
have already gone a long way 
towards making “spare parts 
surgery” on a large scale a 
practical possibility. 
  
The ever-expanding 
armamentarium 
  
A revolution, in which chem- 
istry plays a role equally as important 
as in agriculture, is underway in 
modern medicine and public health. 
‘Synthetic detergents have vastly im- 
proved sanitation, and debilitating. 
and lethal diseases have been elimi- 
nated by the eradication of carri- 
er insects through widespread and 
systematic application of insecticides. 
A vast array of preventive and thera- 
peutic medicines have conspired with 
improved diets and better shelter to 
reduce infant mortality and increase 
average life expectancy to 67 years for 
men and 74 years for women. By 1985, 
the figures are expected to reach 80 for 
both males and females of the species. 
Much of this success derives from 
modern medicine and its ever-expand- 
ing armamentarium of drugs, provided 
very largely by the organic chemists, 
biochemists, nuclear chemists and 
microbiologists working in the re- 
search-based pharmaceutical industry. 
Attempts to use drugs to alleviate 
disease are as old as the history of 
man. The Chinese, for instance, deve- 
oped an elaborate pharmacology using 
a wide variety of remedies found in 
nature. 
But the concept of systematic labo- 
ratory investigation of drug action did 
not arise until the 1850s when the 
striking development of the German 
chemical industry prompted Oswald 
Schniederberg to study the damage 
brought about in living organisms by 
chemically active substances. Only 
after 1930 did the pharmaceutical in- 
dustry reach the takeoff stage, when 
a powerful array of new therapeutic 
agents was developed in a surpris- 
ingly short time. 
Already we tend to take for granted 
the improved quality of life that has 
evolved from the fact that man can 
expect longer life, to spend less of 
his life in illness or in pain, and to 
have a steady flow of important new 
drugs at prices that are within his 
reach. During the twenty year period, 
1944-64, in the U.S. alone, some 
3,250,000 people survived who would 
have died if the 1944 death rate had 
prevailed throughout the two decades.

But the discovery and development 
of the sulfonamides, antibiotics, and 
other anti-infective drugs have drama- 
tically reduced death rates from a 
number of infectious diseases through- 
out the world. 
Thanks largely to drugs, remarkable 
changes have taken place in the treat- 
ment of tuberculosis: with the use of 
streptomycin, a 49 per cent decline 
in death from this long-time major 
killer was attained, and within a year 
after the introduction of isoniasid, the 
death rate had declined by 86 per cent. 
These are but a few examples of the 
rapid improvement in life through 
chemistry in the last three to four 
decades. 
Many pharmaceutical products have 
marked effects on the quality of life 
without effecting longevity, however. 
Non-addictive pain killers, are one 
example. Reliable oral contraceptive 
therapy, which makes intelligent family 
planning possible, is another. Tran- 
quillizers and other drugs that influence 
the central nervous system have made 
an important contribution to the control 
of mental diseases and the restoration 
of mental patients to normal life. 
Prospects for further advancements 
in biochemical pharmaceuticals and 
their contribution to our health, vigour 
and longevity during the next thirty 
years are exciting, and in psychoactive 
drugs and genetics both attractive and 
a little frightening. 
As people live longer, medicine for 
the aging will claim more attention. 
There will be a decrease in the debili- 
tating effects of senility, heart disease 
and arthritis. The development of new 
synthetic organ and tissue substitutes 
will serve to prolong life where only 
parts of the body are threatened; and 
techniques of organ transplantation 
with the development of improved 
immuno-suppressive drugs will be 
further perfected. 
And, not least, scientists may deter- 
mine in what sense death is an inevi- 
table biological necessity, or how far 
it is the result of a series of patholo- 
gical accidents, each one of which can 
be separately eluded or corrected by 
changes in dietary habits or the appli-

MODERN CHEMISTRY (Continued) 
The most exciting innovation since antibiotics 
cation of 
agents. 
New understanding of the molecular 
basis for disease, through increasing 
sophistication of biological research, 
will strongly influence the design of 
new synthetic drugs, providing for effi- 
cient action against disease with 
less danger of harmful side-effects. 
Likewise, * new knowledge about 
mechanisms by which hormones regu- 
late life processes, and the in- 
fluences of aging and disease on such 
activity, make it possible to design 
drugs which can exercise effective 
control of metabolism during disease 
and aging. If successful, the process 
of aging may be retarded and s2ni- 
lity reduced, resulting in a longer spar 
of useful life. 
proper chemotherapeutic 
N the past few years, 
several pharmaceutical products have 
been made available which effectively 
lower the blood pressure, and along 
with diuretics, are helpful in sustaining 
the health and prolonging the lives of 
patients suffering from hypertension. 
More effective heart disease drugs to 
reduce fatty deposits that clog blood 
vessels are being prepared for us. 
And permanently installed artificial 
pacemakers using synthetic piezoelec- 
tric crystals to generate sufficient 
electric current from the movement of 
the diaphragm will offset damage to 
the cardiac nerve centre, prolonging 
Ife with greater ease for those inflic- 
ted with heart trouble. 
If, as recent findings of Dr. Howard 
M. Temin and Satoshi Mizutani seem 
to confirm, some forms of cancer are 
caused by viruses, preventive and 
therapeutic vaccines can be expected 
to replace surgery as the principal 
form of treatment for this dreaded 
threat to human life. Cancer appears 
to be not one, but a variety of dis 
eases, so that several approa- 
ches will probably be required to 
control it. Well-defined programmes 
of nucleic acid research, with focus 
on new prospects of medicinal chemis- 
try, offer hope of new anti-tumour 
drugs and agents active against leu- 
kemia. 
Powerful new weapons against vi- 
ruses of a wide variety will be in use 
before 1985. Here, some sensational 
developments are predictable. Anti- 
viral drugs and products of nucleic 
acid research to cure influenza and 
the common cold can be anticipated. 
Some new anti-viral drugs will not be 
specific to one particular virus, but 
will affect a spectrum of viruses, pro- 
bably including useful bacteriophages 
that attack bacteria. 
Careful structural molecular analysis 
has also led to experimentation with 
cage-shaped vaccine molecules that 
interfere with viral attachment to or 
penetration of human cells on the 
perfectly sound theory that prevention 
of cell penetration will render the virus 
harmless. Other drugs will interfere 
with the assembly of viral components, 
or simply mislead viruses by the in- 
duction of faulty coding. Vaccines 
against mumps and German measles 
have been developed and another 
recent discovery — 55-fluorodeoxyuri- 
dine—is effective in treating herpes of 
the eye. 
These are small, but meaningful, 
triumphs. With the understanding of the 
nature of viruses and their reproduc- 
tion growing rapidly, however, the 
current rather unimpressive cupboard 
of antiviral drugs will be expanded 
steadily in the next two decades to 
lighten the human burden of disease. 
A new breakthrough in the long 
struggle against schistosomiasis has 
produced a promising new drug, niri- 
dazole, which stops egg laying by 
schistosoma worms, destroys the eggs 
inside the human body, and kills the 
parent worms, curing the patient and 
helping to obstruct perpetuation of the 
parasite—all in one concerted action. 
Described by Prof. A.W. Woodruff 
of the London School of Hygiene 
and Tropical Medicine as “the most 
exciting therapeutic innovation in this, 
and perhaps any, field since the intro- 
duction of antibiotics”, niridazole is 
expected to bring relief to between 
200 and 300 million people in Asia, 
Africa and Latin America who are 
infected by the disease. 
Serendipitiously, niridazole also has 
proved to be an effective weapon 
against guinea worm, amoeba and cer- 
tain types of leishmania— three debili- 
tating parasites which continue to be 
major health problems in tropical 
areas. By 1985, nucleic acid research 
is also expected to produce new active 
agents against parasitic and other 
tropical diseases. 
Recent research has also focused 
attention on various aspects of immu- 
nity, other than those involved in the 
use of prophylactic vaccines. New 
drugs designed to cure or relieve 
arthritis and multiple sclerosis, which 
appear to be manifestations of auto- 
immune phenomena, are on the 
horizon. 
The early generation of immuno- 
suppressive drugs has already made 
possible such success as has be n 
obtained in organ transplantation. Tne 
search for better agents, again through 
nucleic acid chemistry, will continue, 
particularly for pharmaceuticals which, 
when use has been discontinued, per- 
mit full recovery of the immune mech- 
anisms. 
Attempts are also underway to iso- 
late new hormones, improve oral con- 
traceptives as well as produce more 
potent non-addictive analgesic drugs, 
sedatives that do not cause drug tol- 
erance, better anti-inflammatory and 
anti-ulcer drugs, and compounds that 
prevent or control osteoporosis (a 
disease of the bones). 
In addition to what may be thought 
of as classic medicine, there is an 
ever-increasing number of drugs being 
developed to influence the mind and 
nervous system. Numerous drugs to 
control memory and learning are al- 
ready available. Ribonucleic acid, a 
genetic messenger, is said to actually 
stimulate the brain's memory cells. 
Among the beneficial therapeutic uses 
of the drug is the treatment of senility; 
but it has much broader implications. 
Certain hydrazine derivatives have 
made chemotherapy of mental de- 
pression possible, and led to the 
introduction of anti-depressants for use 
in treating mental disorders. 
Still another psycho-pharmaceutical 
substance selectively relieves anxiety 
and tension along with their organic 
manifestations, without impairing phy- 
sical and mental alertness. Drugs for 
the treatment of tension and compul- 
sive neuroses, euhypnics which induce 
sleep by shielding the sleep mecha- 
nism from disturbing stimuli of emo- 
tional, sensory or autonomic origin 
have also been, developed. 
UT the frightening aspect 
of all this is the use to which chemicai 
brain-control agents may be put. Some 
scientists believe it may become pos- 
sible to control the individual and 
entire societies, and to do all this 
unobtrusively without the active co- 
operation of the victims. 
Chemicals could be placed in water 
supplies, food or the air we breathe, 
to work on a mass basis. Or a pres- 
cribed psychological environment in 
the very early periods of an indivi- 
dual's life might be used to produce 
inferior brains and people on the one 
hand, and superior brains and people 
on the other — thus creating the 
master group and the subservient 
group envisaged in Huxley's “Brave 
New World.” 
All this is, of course, speculative— 
but possible within limits of present 
scientific knowledge. Self-abuse of 
psycho-pharmaceutical drugs is alrea- 
dy with us, indicating a certain mis- 
placed emphasis in the analysis of 
social problems these new discoveries 
pose. The challenge is not the social 
responsibility of the scientist who 
contrives a new brain-control com- 
pound; whether the new discovery is 
used to good or bad ends depends 
on individuals and the social controls 
they are prepared to sustain.

nized agriculture and the practice of 
medicine in the last generation, its 
impact upon the quality of life has 
been hardly less far-reaching through 
the development of plastics. Plastics, 
the only new twentieth century techno- 
logy to emerge as a basic industry, 
has enabled man to fashion materials 
to meet his specific needs rather than 
adapt his needs to the availability of 
nature's substances as they occur. 
Other basic materials—glass, iron, 
steel and the non-ferrous metals, 
ceramics, concrete, timber and natural 
fibres—all existed before the begin- 
ning of the Greek era. Paper was 
invented by the Chinese much later, 
about the time of Christ. Until the 
development of plastics——looked upon 
until only a very few years ago as 
“substitutes” rather than as a major

new technology—modern man had 
added only rubber and aluminium to 
his available materials. 
Yet plastics, structured from matter 
rather than specific substances and 
capable of being fashioned according 
to the intended end-use, are only the 
beginning of a new materials techno- 
logy. New composite materials with 
specific microstructures of atoms and 
molecules designed with the desired 
physical, chemical and electrical 
characteristics will be the products 
of physical chemistry and quantum 
mechanics with which we will fashion 
the clothing we wear, the homes we live 
in, the buildings in which we work, 
the cities of the future. 
Fully synthetic fibres, rapidly 
replacing natural fibres, have produc- 
ed a veritable comfort revolution in 
the past ten years. Durable press 
fabrics have made the most spec- 
tacular changes in fibre use patterns, 
in textile processing and economics 
and in the lives of consumers, of 
any single innovation that has ever 
appeared on the textile scene. 
As a result, while the consumption 
of cotton remained stable throughout 
the 1960s, polyester production for 
apparel and home-furnishing fabrics 
increased by a factor of 20 and is 
expected to triple in the present 
decade. Improvements consumers 
can expect in the fabrics they use 
during this period include better stain 
removal, higher soil resistance, 
greater resistance to burning, and 
lower static buildup. 
Stretch, or spandex, fibres that 
have brought such radical changes to 
women's fashions, will also find much 
wider future use in all types of men’s 
and women's garments. The improv- 
ed comfort, fit and draping qualities 
obtained are possible when only a 
small amount of spandex is incorporat- 
ed into a fabric. 
Only slightly less visible than the 
influence of new fibres on fashions is 
the renaissance of the wig and 
hairpieces for women and, to a daily 
increasing extent, for men, provoked 
by the advent of modacrylic fibres. 
While these innovations may be 
more social than utilitarian, their main 
object is to enable people to enjoy, 
or at least not be ashamed of, their 
appearance—a most welcomed contri- 
bution to the quality of life. 
But new synthetic fibres have also 
brought new comfort , styling and ease 
of maintenance to the home. New 
fabrics for floor coverings, draperies 
and upholstery have lustre and 
beauty, long life and ease of cleaning 
and maintenance. Use of carpeting 
in the home, hotels and business 
places has increased almost four-fold 
in the past ten years, and lower 
prices, greater durability and low cost 
of maintenance is expected to further 
expand its uses—even for outdoors. 
Similarly, wall coverings in fabrics, 
which have functional advantages of 
insulation and sound proofing as well 
as exciting new decorating and styling 
possibilities, will make their modest 
contribution to the improvement of 
man’s environment at home and at 
work. 
Still more exotic fibres are avail- 
able today for a wide variety of in- 
dustrial and construction uses, Highly 
flexible fibrous materials produced in 
metallic, ceramic and carbon composi- 
tions are used as separators and 
matrices for high temperature fuel cells 
and other multiple layer insulation, 
reflectors and insulation for inductive- 
ly heated and resistance heated 
furnaces, reinforcements for materials 
used in nozzles and heat shields, high 
temperature filter media for bases and 
metals, porous diffusers for infrared 
burners, and catalyst supports.

Brobdingnagian “eggs” or “lemons” (right) are really giant balloons for stratospheric research made out 
of synthetic rubber, being inspected at a factory in Kazan on the Volga river in the U.S.S.R. The new world 
of synthetic materials created by modern chemistry includes a broad selection of heat-resistant polymers. 
These range from materials that protect metal from temperatures as high as 4,000 degrees F. for short 
periods, to nylon fibres for protection against heat and flame. Unlike asbestos, this new cloth can be made 
into garments that protect firemen (below) and those doing jobs with serious fire hazards, while allowing 
them to work as easily as if they were wearing ordinary clothes.

ONE DROP OF GLUE 
DOES THE TRICK 
When does a single drop of “glue” have the sticking power to support a half-ton 
weight? The answer: when it's a new-type plastic adhesive. The ability of 
high-strength adhesives to weld two materials into a virtually permanent union 
is demonstrated in photos on this page. With the development of plastic adhe- 
sives that are stronger, lighter and easier to use than conventional fasteners, 
screws and bolts, rivet and nails may one day become obsolete. Houses, cars 
and planes may eventually be completely glued together as furniture is today.

Above and below, a single drop of glue is used 
to join two steel cylinders together to become 
part of a heavy-duty hoist. The liquid solidifies 
on contact, the tiny amount of moisture and 
oxygen present on almost any surface being 
sufficient to trigger off the process. Within 
minutes the chemical weld created by the drop 
is strong enough to support the weight of a 
1,200-pound safe (right).

MODERN CHEMISTRY (Continued from page 16) 
Carbon and graphite fibres, produc- 
ed by the decomposition of rayon or 
acrylonitrile polymers under carefully- 
controlled conditions, are the highest 
strength-to-weight and modulus-to- 
weight engineering materials man has 
yet been able to devise. Because of 
high production costs, these yarns 
are used only in special applications 
such as nose cones of aircraft, space- 
craft and sensitive radar housings in 
remote arctic locations. 
What synthetic fibres have become 
for clothing and home furnishing, solid 
plastics developed from the same 
resins are rapidly becoming for 
home construction, furniture, household 
appliances, motor cars and industry. 
Environmental conditions which can 
maintain ideal climate, pure air, and 
freedom from noise, making available 
to the average home dweller the 
seclusion and comfort once limited to 
a privileged few, are now within 
reach, thanks to plastics technology. 
Special lighting, enhanced by the 
use of electroluminescent plastic 
panels, together with radiant heating 
built into neoprene ceilings, will soon 
bring these comforts to millions of 
families. Wall and ceiling panels 
made of plastic foam sandwiched 
between thin metals, ceramic, pressed 
wood, or plastic sheets, will have 
light-weight, high-insulation properties 
and the strength of metals—a boon 
for new labour-saving, prefabricated 
construction techniques. Surface 
coatings of foil, film, sheet, or spray 
will be tough, durable and colourful. 
A new “systems concept” of con- 
struction, providing architects and 
builders with engineered plastics spe- 
cially designed to perform specific 
functions, in combination with other 
products and materials used in a 
finished structure, has opened up 
broad new horizons for housing and 
building construction. 
The results are huge savings in 
time and money, along with improved 
insulation, structural integrity and 
creature comforts. Use of black 
anodized aluminium backed with ure-

thane foam insulant enabled Chicago 
architects to design the Windy City's 
futuristic 100-storey John Hancock 
Center for construction at costs of a 
conventional 45-storey building: $95 
million. 
Synthetic products used in this and 
other high-rise buildings include 
corrosion-resistant bearings, adhesives 
said to be 30 times stronger than 
ordinary cement-lime mortar and 
10-30 per cent cheaper, gypsum 
wallboard, butyl rubber glazing tape 
and neoprene rubber strips around 
windows, vinyl-asbestos floor tiles, 
plastic laminate panels in elevators 
and offices, synthetic fibre carpets, 
protective and decorative surface 
coatings and bronze-tinted glass 
windows, 
Still other shapes of the future, 
made possible by products of modern 
chemistry, were heralded by the 
dazzling and bizarre collage of 
structures assembled in the Senri 
Hills outside Osaka for Japan's Expo 
70. Although designed primarily to

amaze and delight the eye, the build- 
ings at Expo also incorporated many 
sound structural innovations that 
could influence building trends for 
years to come. 
Certainly, the extensive use of 
elastomeric building materials for air- 
supported structures indicates the 
progress that synthetic rubber may 
expect to make in the construction 
field during the next decade or two. 
More than twenty buildings utilized 
newly developed neoprene joining 
techniques which reduce critical 
construction times and assure resilient 
and weatherproof structures. 
These materials are already finding 
wide application in less exotic struc- 
tures the world over. A new 
industrialized building system, remark- 
able for its simplicity, flexibility and 
speed has been developed in France 
by a group of architects and in- 
dustrialists using a patented innova- 
tion—a moulded fixation point for alu- 
minium mullions—used in the facades 
of their multi-storied apartment houses. 
 
A vast roof of unique design, 
covering a new gymnasium at Prin- 
ceton University in the U.S.A. has a 
weatherpoof coating of neoprene and 
Hypalon synthetic rubbers, giving it 
added weather resistance, flexibility 
and durability. A French fruit-grower 
near Avignon has been able to store 
fruit for three months longer than 
usual and at a much lower cost than in 
conventional structures, by using in- 
flated refrigerated warehouses, made 
from synthetic rubber coated fabric 
that very much resembles structures 
of the Osaka Fair. 
New materials for new devices will 
also play many hidden réles in home 
and office buildings. Packaged power 
units, whose future availability de- 
pends in large measure on present- 
day materials research by the chem- 
icals industry, will reduce noise and 
air pollution. Direct energy con- 
verters and efficient storage batteries, 
taking their charges during off-peak- 
load periods, should improve economy 
and reduce electric power costs. 
“Schematism”, says the dictionary, “is 
the arranging of parts or particles in a 
pattern according to a scheme.” The 
“Ski-mat-ists” in our photos are gliding 
in hot summer sunlight on artificial ski 
slopes made of synthetic sheeting to 
which a carefully worked out pattern, 
below, has given the consistency and 
qualities of snow. All year round skiing 
within the reach of all is now a reality 
for youth in Yomiuriland, Japan, left, 
and denizens of Dieppe, France, far left.

Packaged power is already in wide 
use for flashlights, hearing aids, por- 
table radios, electric shavers and the 
like. By 1985, small batteries in the 
pockets of light weight apparel made 
of new synthetic fabrics will provide 
well-regulated body-environmental tem- 
peratures without the need for heavy 
overcoats. Larger batteries will fur- 
nish motive power for automobiles 
and an increasing percentage of 
other land vehicular transportation. 
With the possibilities of greater 
leisure both from work and house- 
hold chores, plastics and other new 
materials will play an increasing role 
in facsimile information services, video 
and sound tape recordings, art works 
and published materials. 
A whole new generation of televi- 
sion receivers is likely to be the first 
futuristic electronic device, made 
possible by the development of ferro- 
electric crystals and electrolumines- 
cent layers made of copper-activated 
zinc sulfoselenide phosphor particles 
encapsulated in a resin. Similarly,

standard telephones operating on 
sound waves may soon be rendered 
obsolete by a system in which laser- 
generated light—modulated by ferro- 
electric crystals such as lithium 
tantalate—will carry many times the 
volume of information that can be 
transmitted by present telephone 
circuits. 
It is not known exactly when man 
identified pollution. as a problem. Not 
only was it beneath the dignity of 
ancient writers to discuss the matter ; 
it wasn't an issue. Pollution was a 
part of life. 
History does, however, record that 
the early Romans complained that a 
black soot in the air smudged their 
togas. And in merry old England 
there was once a law prohibiting the 
burning of a certain low grade of coal. 
Violation was punishable by death, 
and King Edward | (1272-1307 AD.) 
is known to have enforced the penalty. 
But pollution in those times was of 
a different order than the pollution we 
have today. Life was simple, and 
society was far from affluent. Very 
little in the way of effluent wastes was 
created and almost nothing was 
thrown out. There were no nations 
with 85 million automobiles to account 
for some 40 per cent of 200 million 
tons of emissions dumped into the air 
annually as residue of human activity 
—as in the United States today. 
Thanks to modern technology, we 
have been able to achieve a standard 
of living undreamed of even a century 
ago. But in the process we have 
also created many pollution problems. 
The problems are new, different, 
bigger and they are demanding and 
getting a growing amount of our atten- 
tion, time and money. 
Just as chemistry has provided 
modern man with tools to conquer 
hunger and disease, to provide im- 
proved clothing and shelter, it is the 
principle means at our disposal for 
the conservation of our environment. 
After seven years of research, the 
chemical industry has perfected an 
exhaust manifold reactor, a noncata- 
lytic unit that thermally reduces the 
gaseous emissions of conventional 
auto engines; it will control the two 
principle problem pollutants generated 
by auto engines: hydrocarbons and 
carbon monoxide. Fibres and plastics 
are used in a number of other filtering 
and reclamation processes, while 
chemicals and intermediates are used 
in purifying and catalytic systems. 
While the apparatus that will filter, 
trap or dissolve all pollution materials 
discharged by oi! refineries, chemical 
plants, steel mills, paper plants and

built yet, progress has been made 
with the recent development of cellular 
ceramic materials resembling honey- 
combs that are effective in fume 
abatement. ‘When covered with a 
precious metal or metal oxide, these 
honeycomb structures cause oxidation 
as the fumes pass through. 
Nylon and tetrafluorocarbon fibres 
are also being effectively used in. 
many dust collection systems, particu- 
larly where heat resistance is requir- 
ed. Filter bags in a variety of fabrics 
and types are doing service in more 
than a dozen industries, including iron 
and steel, chemical, cement, gypsum, 
quarrying, carbon black, zinc, soap, 
smelting, asphalt and the reclamation 
of metals. 
Somewhat more success has been 
obtained with water purification 
systems. Direct oxygenation systems 
have substantially improved the effec- 
tiveness and lowered the cost of the 
secondary activated sludge waste- 
water treatment process used by most 
municipal and large industrial systems. 
Nylon and polyester fibre per- 
meators that can make brackish water 
fit to drink may also be used to 
remové certain pollutants from sugar, 
paper, pharmaceutical, chemical and 
dairy industries. 
In other preventive applications, 
synthetic rubber lining is being used 
for storage of brine, hydrocarbon oils, 
fuels and chemicals to prevent 
seepage which might contaminate 
streams, the soil and subsurface 
waters. 
in what amounts to the most con- 
certed scientific effort in history, one 
far more extensive than that of the 
space programmes of the 1960s, hun- 
dreds of governmental and industrial 
research laboratories are engaged in 
the search for new products and new 
technologies to meet the mounting 
demand for pollution control and 
maintenance of ‘a continuing balance 
in the global ecosystem. 
Just as astronomy was the basic 
science around which a vast constel- 
lation of physical and social sciences 
were combined with the humanities in 
a systems approach io the conquest 
of space, chemistry must be the focus 
of a similar global systems approach 
to environmental control and improve- 
ment. 
As an executive in a leading inter- 
national chemical company pointed out 
recently in Zurich, “the restoration 
of the environment is essentially 
a chemical problem which has to be 
solved in the chemical laboratory and 
by the massive application of chemical 
products to neutralize the insalubrious 
waste of our industrial society.” 
Within the next ten years the first 
results of this intensive research 
effort will begin to have a noticeable 
impact. By the year 2000, chances 
are that the combined efforts of 
science, industry, academia and gov- 
ernments will have gone far toward 
meeting the ecological imperative. NW

BRIDGE MADE OF PAPER. “On paper it's possible”, said the 
structural engineers when asked to design a new type of bridge; 
and this is exactly how this 12,000 Ib truck is crossing the 
gorge—on a 32 ft bridge made of specially processed paper. 
The bridge was constructed by American paper manufacturers 
merely to demonstrate the strength and versatility of paper, not 
as a commercial enterprise. Engineers calculated that the 
bridge could carry a weight of up to 30 tons, yet it was light 
enough to be put in place by a helicopter. Newly discovered 
glues helped to make this feat possible.

by Ghenrikh Teterin 
and Claire Terlon 
OME of the basic sub- 
stances in nature, which we call 
elements, have been known since 
early antiquity. But it is only during 
the past century that man has learned 
that there are about a hundred ele- 
ments, and begun to understand how 
these are similar or different. 
The work of Copernicus and Galileo 
had earlier brought order out of chaos 
in astronomy, Newton did much the 
same for mechanics, then Darwin and 
Pavlov for biology, while much later 
Bohr and Einstein were to make 
significant contributions to the physics 
of the atom. In chemistry, one of the 
great moments came in 1869 when the 
Russian researcher Dmitri Ivanovich 
  
GHENRIKH TETERIN of the U.S.S.R., is head 
of the Scientific Laboratory at Odessa State 
University, in the Ukraine, where he has 
worked in the fields of physical and electro- 
chemistry. He has also carried out research 
at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, in the 
US.A., under the U.S.S.R.-U.S.A. scientific 
exchange programme. Dr. Teterin is at 
present working with Unesco’s Division of 
Science Teaching. He has written widely on 
physical chenustry and is the author of many 
popular science articles. 
CLAIRE TERLON, of France, is a specialist 
in physics as well as psychology. As a 
member of the Institut Pédagogique National 
in Paris, she is responsible for the preparation 
of special television refresher courses for 
chemistry and physics teachers in French 
lycées. She is a regular contributor to the 
French science magazine “La Recherche- 
Atomes”. 
Mendeleyev formulated the periodic 
law of the chemical elements. 
The formulation of the periodic law 
marked the passing of the study of 
chemistry from almost medieval trial- 
and-error methods to a modern 
science capable of predicting elements 
not yet seen, heard, touched or 
smelled by man. The coherent 
arrangement of the elements by 
Mendeleyev crowned the efforts of 
men of science in many countries to 
discover a meaningful system in the 
properties of these basic substances. 
Mendeleyev’s idea was to be 
virtually a quantum jump from the 
simple table laid out in the eighteenth 
century by the French chemist Antoine 
Lavoisier who had included, besides 
physical elements, what he called 
“imponderable fluids,” such as light 
and the energy derived from heat. 
Although a far cry from Mendel- 
eyev's rigorously logical approach, 
Lavoisier's effort succeeded in con- 
ditioning other scientists to reject the 
theory of phlogiston. This was the 
ancient chemical concept, dating from 
early Greek civilization, that fire in its 
various forms was a physical or 
material component of nature. 
Lavoisier's analysis was improved 
upon in 1803 by the British chemist 
John Dalton and his atomic theory 
which attributed a distinctive atomic 
“weight” to each of the 23 elements 
admitted by Lavoisier. Characteristics

charged) and neutrons (electrically neutral particles). Though physicists 
nowadays view atomic structures as more complex arrangements 
(resembling balls of energetic and uncertain “fluff”) the image of the 
atom as a minute solar system is still a useful one for the non-specialist.

CHART ON THE WALL (Continued) 
 
‘Chance favours only 
the prepared mind’ 
— Pasteur 
 
such as this and the “equivalent 
weight” concept of another English 
scientist, William Wollaston, were to 
pave the way for chemists later to 
perceive a cohesive order among all 
the elements found in nature. But 
until Mendeleyev's time, even the 
notions of what constituted an element 
were vague and subject to individual 
interpretation. 
By 1850, an additional thirty elements 
had been recognized, bringing the 
total known to somewhat more than 
sixty. Tables of chemical order were 
offered by scientific thinkers such as 
lohann Débereiner, Leopold Gmelin, 
E. Lennsen, Max von Pettenkofer, Jean- 
Baptiste Dumas, Willard Gibbs and 
John Gladstone—to name but a few. 
In 1817 Débereiner's “triads,” or 
groups of three, had been an attempt 
to correlate trios of elements accord- 
ing to neighbouring atomic weights. 
By 1852, Gmelin had adapted the 
triads to four-and five-element series 
(tetrads and pentads), ranged accord- 
ing to their atomic weights, in increas- 
ing order. 
Among the researchers whom 
Dimitri Mendeleyev was later to single 
out as most influential on his work 
were the French scientists Dumas and 
Lennsen. Dumas’ contribution had 
been a method to calculate the atomic 
weight of elements within a given 
group, whereas Lennsen's was a first 
attempt to interpolate the atomic 
weights of elements yet to be discov- 
ered. 
During the 1860s, novel forms of 
classifying the elements were propos- 
ed. One of these was Alexandre 
Beguyer de Chancourtois’ “telluric 
screw,” a spiral arrangement wound 
round an imaginary cylinder. It strikes 
today’s reader as curiously parallel to 
the “double helix” in modern genetic 
chemistry. 
In another view held at that time by 
John Newlands of England, every 
eighth element in the ascending order 
of atomic weights repeated certain 
characteristics. This was called the 
theory of octaves, after the layout of 
the diatonic scale in western musical 
forms. 
Probably the most provocative of 
the new ideas was that advanced by 
a German scientist, Lothar Meyer. In 
1864 Meyer published a table listing 
forty-four of the sixty-two known 
elements, arranged according to their 
“valency” instead of atomic weight.

No ‘longer of significance today, 
valence refers to the combining power 
of one atom of an element: in water, 
or H,O, the valence of oxygen is two 
because one of its atoms can join 
with two others (in this case, two 
atoms of hydrogen). And the valence 
of hydrogen was the point of departure 
in Meyer's first table. A later table 
proposed by Meyer was to be based 
on atomic weights. 
These endeavours and those of 
three scientists, William Odling, Gus- 
tavus Hinrichs and H. Baumhauer, were 
all steps in the right direction, even 
though a few men of learning con- 
sidered them as little better than men- 
tal games. Some chemists viewed the 
correlation of properties of the ele- 
ments grouped in triads, octaves or 
along a telluric spiral as nothing more 
than happenstance and therefore little 
better than superficial analogy. Even 
as Newlands was presenting a paper 
before Britain's prestigious Chemical 
Society he was asked, ironically, if it 
would not be possible to obtain the 
same results by arranging the ele- 
ments in their alphabetical order! 
What, then, was Mendeleyev's 
theory all about? Briefly, he proposed 
arranging the elements in lines and 
columns (also called “periods” and 
“groups”) inside a rectangle, with 
their atomic weights rising in number 
from left to right along the same line, 
one line following the other down the 
page. 
The columns were determined by 
elements possessing analogous pro- 
perties—the same kind of combining 
oxide, for example. The fewest atoms 
of an element (R) combining with the 
fewest of oxygen (O) would appear in 
the first column, augmenting in combin- 
ing proportions toward the seventh 
column. 
   
INCE only some sixty ele- 
ments were then known, eight columns 
sufficed then and still do today. In 
fact, the lay-out of an entire system 
still in use was prescribed by Men- 
deleyev when only slightly more than 
half its components were known. 
Mendeleyev knew from the outset 
that he had developed a scientific 
device to lay out the chemical elements 
in a convenient system. More than 
that, he realized he had discovered an 
objective, natural law. Yet just as 
Newton had been popularly said to 
understand universal gravitation when 
struck on the head by a falling apple 
(or Watt realized that a boiling kettle 
could be transformed into the steam 
engine), there were still those who 
thought that Mendeleyev had come 
upon the periodic law... as the result 
of a dream. 
Man tends to overlook that while 
scientific truth may suddenly strike 
one man’s mind as a flash of lightning, 
that same scientist may have spent 
‘years of arduous research on his sub- 
ject. Indeed, it was Pasteur who later 
commented that “chance favours only 
the prepared mind.” If we take a look 
at Mendeleyev's activities before 
1869, it becomes fairly clear that the 
emergence of the periodic table was 
no mere accident. 
Although Mendeleyev's table was 
considered by some scientists as 
simply another in an endless series 
of dubious hypotheses, one of its 
great merits was its boldness. The 
progress made in chemistry during the 
past century has proved Mendeleyev's 
theory to be correct on two additional 
counts. He said that new elements 
would be discovered to help fill the 
holes in the system he had devised, 
and that the atomic weights of some 
elements which did not fit into his 
table had been calculated erroneously. 
In the latter case (concerning the 
atomic weights of the elements cerium, 
indium, titanium, uranium, yttrium and 
others), Mendeleyev was soon to be 
proved right as new research helped 
rectify weights which were incorrect. 
‘Where an element did not seem to fit 
(such as uranium with an atomic 
Unesco bibliography 
weight of 116), he speculated on the 
true value. He arbitrarily doubled, for 
instance, the weight of uranium to 232; 
today we know the actual weight of 
that element to be 238.04. 
In the other and more important 
case—the gaps in the periodic table— 
Mendeleyev was to see three new ele- 
ments identified and described within 
sixteen years of his epoch-making 
declaration before the assembly of 
Russian chemists. Among the ele- 
ments he had foreseen are those at 
first called eka-aluminium, eka-boron 
and eka-silicon (“eka” means “one” 
in Sanskrit); they were later renamed 
to honour the countries where their 
discoveries had occurred. 
Eka-aluminium, Identified scientific- 
ally in 1875 by the Frenchman Paul- 
Emile Lecoq de Boisbaudran, became 
known as gallium (atomic weight 69.72). 
Gallium thus filled the “hole” in the 
table between aluminium and indium. 
Eka-boron, which Mendeleyev had 
predicted would have.an atomic weight 
midway between those of calcium and 
titanium (40 and 48), emerged in 1879 
as scandium, honouring its Swedish 
discoverer Lars Frederick Nilson, The

SCIENCE'S HUNT 
FOR THE MISSING 
LINKS OF NATURE 
by Vitali Goldanski 
  
VITALI GOLDANSKI is corresponding member 
of the U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences and 
head of the Nuclear and Radiation Chemistry 
Laboratory of the Academy's Institute of 
Chemical Physics. A collaborator of Nicolal 
Semyonov, the 1956 Nobel prizewinner for 
physics, he Is editor-in-chief of the journal 
"High Energy Chemistry”, published in Mos- 
cow. Dr. Goldanskl, 48 years of age, has 
written widely In the fields of physics and 
chemistry and his studies and articles have 
been published in many countries. 
HE discovery of the Peri- 
odic Law, one of the fundamental 
laws of nature, by Dmitri Ivanovich 
Mendeleyev, has changed chemistry 
from a vast, chaotic conglomeration of 
facts into a strictly systematic and 
orderly science. 
Today it would be unthinkable to 
try to teach or understand chemistry 
without the Periodic Law. The peri- 
odic change of chemical properties 
of elements and their classification in 
groups and periods has become the 
scientific basis of all analytical chem- 
istry and is widely used in chemical 
technology. Mendeleyev's lew is the 
basis of modern structural chemistry. 
One example of the profound effect 
of the laws discovered by Mendeleyev 
on physical chemistry is the use of the 
Periodic System to select the most 
effective catalysts for chemical pro- 
cesses. For along time, organic chem- 
istry, based on the classic works of 
Alexander Butlerov in Russia and 
August Kekule in Germany, remained 
the least affected by Mendeleyev's 
discovery. However, the fundamental 
role of the Periodic Law became fully 
apparent in the formation and devel- 
opment of the chemistry of organo- 
metallic compounds, a new discipline 
on the boundaries of organic and inor- 
ganic chemistry. 
The importance of Mendeleyev's 
discovery, however, is not restrict- 
ed to chemistry; it has extended far 
beyond it to many allied sciences and 
primarily to physics. It can be claimed 
with full justification that, when inter- 
preted and applied to physics, Men- 
deleyev's system became a succinct, 
clear cut, physico-chemical encyclo- 
paedia, the quintessence of contem- 
porary notions of the structure of 
matter. 
The link between modern 20th cen- 
tury physics and chemistry, along the 
road mapped out by the Periodic Law, 
is moge than simply the blurring of the 
division between the two disciplines; 
each reinforces and enhances the 
other. Their inter-relationship provides 
a specially striking feedback effect. 
On the one hand, Medeleyev's 
discovery and the way in which he 
moved towards it contributed to the 
discovery of the complexity of the 
atom, to the emergence and advance- 
ment of nuclear physics, the systema- 
tic classification of the properties of 
nuclei and elementary particles and to 
other important achievements of 
physics. 
On the other hand, the discovery 
and study of radioactivity, the success- 
es of atomic—and later nuclear— 
physics led to an understanding of the 
meaning of an element's number in 
the System, to an understanding of 
the causes of the periodicity of the 
chemical properties of elements, to the 
filling in of the blank spaces in the 
Periodic Table and its extension far 
beyond uranium. 
By proving the periodic alternation 
of the properties of elements depend- 
ing on their atomic weights, Mendel- 
eyev's law revealed the inter-relation- 
ship of all the atoms on our planet. 
It enabled scientists to tackle the ques- 
tion of atomic structure and eventually 
to approach the discovery of the ato- 
mic nucleus. 
Mendeleyev himself thought that 
atoms would inevitably be proved to 
be complex structures. “One can 
readily assume, though as yet there

Curium (96), Einsteinium (99), Fermium (100)... 
is no means of proving it," he wrote, 
“that the atoms of simple bodies are 
themselves complex entities formed 
by the compounding of certain smal- 
ler parts; that what we call indivisible, 
the atom, is merely indivisible by 
conventional chemical means, just as 
particles are indivisible in normal con- 
ditions by physical means... The peri- 
odic dependency between properties 
and weight | have suggested evident- 
ly confirms such a presentiment.” 
Scientists worked for many years to 
discover the nature of the particles of 
which atoms are constructed. By the 
turn of the century it became appar- 
ent that the atoms of all elements 
contain electrons—negatively charged 
particles whose mass is about 
1/1840th that of the lightest atom, 
hydrogen. 
For a long time nothing was known 
about the carriers of positive atomic 
electricity, and the first atomic model, 
suggested by the English physicist, 
Sir Joseph Thompson, assumed that 
the whole volume of the atom was 
uniformly filled with a positive charge. 
in 1911, another British physicist, 
Lord Rutherford proved that the whole 
positive charge of the atom, and 
almost all of its mass, was concentra- 
ted in the nucleus, the diameter of 
which was approximately 10,000 times 
smaller than that of the whole atom. 
This discovery, and the subsequent 
investigations of the X-Ray spectra 
by Rutherford’s young collaborator, 
Henry Moseley, led to the discovery 
of the physical meaning of an ele- 
ment’'s atomic number as denoting the 
magnitude of the positive charge of 
the nucleus of its atom. Thus, the 
carrier of the unit charge is the proton, 
nucleus of the lightest element, 
hydrogen. The number of protons in 
the nuclei of the atom of any other 
element equals the number of the 
square occupied by that element in 
the Mendeleyev system. 
With the discovery of the nucleus, 
prominence was given to the planetary 
model of the atom according to which 
the nucleus is at the centre, like the 
sun in a planetary system, with the 
electrons revolving around it like 
planets; in a neutral atom the number 
of electrons is equal to the number of 
protons in the nucleus. 
Niels Bohr, the Danish physicist, 
developed this concept of atomic 
structure and linked it with the 
quantum theory which had introduced 
.into physics, at the turn of the century, 
the concept that a body does not 
radiate energy continuously but rather 
intermittently. After analyzing the 
structure of the Mendeleyev System, 
Bohr concluded, in particular, that the 
Sixth Period of the System must 
comprise 32 elements and that element 
No 72, then unknown, must be an 
analogue of zirconium. 
Sure enough, a search for this 
element, carred out at Bohr's sugges- 
tion in zirconium ores, led to the dis- 
covery of hafnium (the missing element 
72). Application of Bohr's theory to 
the Periodic System also led to the 
discovery of the 75th element, rhenium, 
Again and again the Periodic Law 
enabled scientists to - describe the 
properties of undiscovered elements 
and to suggest ways of searching for 
them. 
Perhaps the most important con- 
sequence of combining the Periodic 
System with the quantum theory was 
Wolfgang Pauli's “exclusion principle,” 
advanced in 1925. After analyzing the 
Periodic Law in terms of quantum 
mechanics, Pauli concluded that an 
atom cannot contain two or more 
electrons in the same energy states. 
Subsequently, the principle became 
the basis for a host of hypotheses and 
theories including those of atomic and 
nuclear structure, metals and semi- 
conductors, super-conductivity, super- 
fluidity and weak nuclear interactions, 
and for predicting the existence of 
anti-particles. 
HE Mendeleyev System 
played a decisive part in the isolation 
and identification of the transuranium 
elements (those having an atomic num- 
ber greater than that of uranium). The 
greatest contribution towards the pro- 
duction and study of these elements 
was made by the team of American 
scientists from the Lawrence Radiation 
Laboratory at Berkeley, California, 
headed by Glenn Seaborg. In par- 
ticular they were the first to produce 
element 94, plutonium, whose pro- 
perties are better known today than 
those of many “older” elements. 
The achievement of the California 
team has resulted in the perpetuation 
in the Periodic Table of the great names 
of Marie and Pierre Curie (element 96, 
curium), Albert Einstein (element 99, 
einsteinium), Enrico Fermi (element 
100, fermium). The Berkeley scien- 
tists gave the first element of the 
second hundred the name of Dmitri 
Mendeleyev (element 101, mendelev- 
ium), “in recognition of the pioneering 
rble of the great Russian chemist, who 
was the first to use the periodic 
system of the elements to predict the 
chemical properties of undiscovered 
elements, a principle which has been 
the key to the discovery of many new 
elements.” 
In recent years, the laboratory 
directed by U.S.S.R. Academician 
Georgi Flerov at the loint Nuclear 
Research Institute in Dubna has 
become a major centre of work on 
transuranium elements. In particular, 
the Institute has produced many 
isotopes of the later actinides (actini- 
des are the group of elements with 
atomic numbers from 89 to 103), and 
has pioneered the synthesis of trans- 
actinide elements. The first element 
in the transactinide series, No. 104, 
was named kurchatovium in honour of 
Academician Igor Kurchatov, founder 
of the Soviet school of nuclear science. 
For a long time the question of the 
chemical properties of elements lying 
farther away from uranium in the 
Periodic Table seemed to be a purely 
academic one since their isotopes 
decay very rapidly. Lately, however, 
more promising prospects of synthes- 
izing very heavy elements have emerg- 
ed. There is reason to hope that 
atomic nuclei containing about 114 or 
about 126 protons and approximately 
184 neutrons will be found to possess 
greater stability. 
The task of producing these ele- 
ments artificially or searching for them 
in nature has become very relevant. 
Scientists at the Dubna Institute and 
elsewhere are at present hunting for 
element No. 114 which, according to 
the Periodic Law, should be eka-lead. 
As for element 126, this should logic- 
ally belong to the 8th period of the 
System. 
In our view, based on the work of 
the Soviet scientist V. M. Klechkovski, 
this period should theoretically contain 
50 elements (though they may not all 
necessarily be synthesized), including 
a group of 18 hitherto unknown chem- 
ical twins, the octadecanides (elements 
121 to 138). Their closest chemical 
analogue among known elements 
should logically be actinium. 
Whereas the heavy elements men- 
tioned above are almost 300 times 
heavier than hydrogen, examples of 
“new atoms” that are many times 
lighter than hydrogen are already 
known. In various “new atoms” the 
component particles of conventional 
atoms—protons and electrons—are 
replaced by other similarly charged 
elementary particles; today the number

Following the discovery in 1932 
by Dr. Carl Anderson of a posi- 
tively charged electron, known 
as a positron, scientists have 
speculated that, in conformity 
with the essential symmetry of 
nuclear physics, every particle 
has its equivalent anti-particle. 
For reasons as yet not under- 
stood, when a positron meets 
an electron both particles are 
annihilated and energy is re- 
leased. If anti-matter, compos- 
ed of anti-particles, exists, phy- 
sicists presume that were such 
anti-matter to encounter a piece 
of ordinary matter a catastro- 
phic mutual annihilation would 
result. It is interesting to note 
that in 1957 the Nobel prize 
for research in this field of 
physics went to Tsung Dao Lee 
and Chen Ning Yang from Chi- 
na where the Yin Yang theory 
of complementarity has existed 
for thousands of years. Right, 
an example of the symmetrical 
paintings of the Dutch artist 
M.C. Escher seems curiously 
to symbolize the physicists’ 
hypotheses.

of known elementary particles runs 
into dozens. Various combinations of 
them can, in principle, yield hundreds 
of different new atoms. 
This, of course, does not mean that 
the Periodic System is in need of 
enlargement or modification, since the 
substitution of some other negative 
particles for the electron does not 
change the charge of the nucleus, 
which determines an element's place 
in the Periodic Table, and the sub- 
stitution of other positive particles for 
the proton yields atoms which in the 
chemical sense can be regarded as 
isotopes of hydrogen. 
short description of the 
chemistry of new atoms could begin 
with such newcomers to the first square 
in the Periodic Table as positronium 
and muonium. Positronium, which was 
discovered in 1951 by Martin Deutsch 
of the United States, marked the 
beginning of the history of new atoms. 
The difference between positronium 
and an ordinary hydrogen atom is that 
the proton is replaced by a positron, 
the anti-particle of an electron. Muon- 
fum is an atom of hydrogen in which 
the place of the proton is taken by a 
positively charged mu-meson particle. 
Practically all the classes of chem- 
ical reactions of positronium have 
been studied in the last few years at 
the U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences’ 
Institute of Chemical Physics. 
A comparison of the various reac- 
tions of atoms of positronium and 
hydrogen suggests that, although they 
have certain common chemical pro- 
perties, their behaviour differs due to 
their great disparity in mass or atomic 
weight, in line with Mendeleyev’s initial 
approach to the periodicity of chem- 
ical properties. It is this link with the 
Periodic System that gives special 
interest to investigations of the phy- 
sical chemistry of the positron and 
positronium, 
Mendeleyev's systematic ordering 
of known data and use of them to 
establish the existence of new, as yet 
unknown, entities and to predict their 
properties, recently found new expres- 
sion in the system of elementary par- 
ticles proposed by the American 
physicist, 1969 Nobel prizewinner 
Murray Gell-Mann. This system was 
brilliantly confirmed by the discovery 
of new particles whose properties 
agreed completely with his predictions. 
The examples given amply demon- 
strate the fundamental role played by 
the Periodic Law even in entirely new 
spheres of science, which appeared 
decades after it was discovered. 
There can be no doubt that many new 
and striking pages of science of the 
future will be firmly linked with 
the great creation of Dmitri Men- 
deleyev. |

definitive atomic weight of this element, 
44.956, was not established until 1955. 
The third element, the so-called eka- 
silicon, became germanium on iis 
discovery in 1886. Possessing an 
atomic weight of 72.59 and properties 
very close to those predicted by 
Mendeleyev, germanium was identified 
by Clemens Alexander Winkler, pro- 
fessor of chemistry at the Freiburg 
School of Mines, in Germany. 
Besides being an excellent theorist, 
Mendeleyev proved to be a practical 
man. Before his death in 1907, he 
was to make chemical investigations 
of the oil fields at Baku in his native 
Russia and in Pennsylvania, U.S.A, as 
well as of the Caucasian springs of 
naphtha, a paraffin-like hydrocarbon 
mixture. (Hydrocarbons are chemical 
compounds consisting of carbon and 
hydrogen only.) 
Long after his death, two more chem- 
ical elements whose existence was 
foretold by Mendeleyev were to be 
clearly identified. In 1925 the German 
husband-wife team of Walter and Ida 
Noddack isolated rhenium, which 
Mendeleyev had called bi-manganese. 
A hard, grey metal often used in 
thermocouples, rhenium has an atomic 
weight of 186.20. Then, seventy years 
after Mendeleyev's discovery, Prof. 
Marguerite Perey, the distinguished 
French woman scientist, identified 
eka-cesium (renamed francium), at the 
Institut du Radium in Paris. Francium’s 
atomic number is 87. 
N the heels of the discov- 
ery of the periodic law of the elements 
came one of the scientifically sensa- 
tional findings of the late 19th century, 
that of the “inert” gas argon. This was 
the work of both Sir William Ramsay 
and Lord Rayleigh. The former had 
suggested to Rayleigh in 1894, after 
careful experimentation, that “... there 
is room for gaseous elements at the 
end of the first column of the periodic 
table.” The two chemists announced 
the new gas later at a meeting in 
Oxford. We now know that argon and 
similar gases are not inert, but can 
combine with other elements. 
Mendeleyev had not foreseen the 
inert gases simply because of their 
predominant “quality” of inactivity. 
Two years later (1896) Ramsay in 
England, and the Swedish chemist Per 
Theodor Cleve, working independently, 
discovered helium. The behaviour of 
helium (from the Greek word for “sun™) 
had been observed spectroscopically 
for several years as one of the com- 
ponents of the solar atmosphere. 
Based on Mendeleyev's reasoning, 
Ramsay was convinced that other 
similar gases existed. In 1898 he and 
Morrls Travers identified three ad- 
ditional “inert” gases—neon, xenon 
and krypton. This family of elements 
came to form the "O" column of the 
periodic table. 
l that same year, 1898, 
Pierre Curie and his Polish wife Maria 
Sklodowska identified the phenomenon 
of radioactivity, which shattered one 
of the foundations of Mendeleyev's law 
—the invariability of the atom. Yet 
Mendeleyev could see no anomaly be- 
tween his law and the existence of 
radioactive elements when he visited 
the Curies’ Parisian laboratory in 1902. 
Ten years later and after Mendel- 
eyev's death, however, when the 
number of radioactive elements had 
risen to 37, scientists had some doubts 
about the adaptability of the periodic 
system. They wondered if Mende- 
leyev's arrangement could be con- 
sidered valid if, as it appeared, there 
were no room on his table for the 
newly discovered elements. 
It was in 1913, on the eve of the 
world's eruption into general war, that 
another modification clearly became 
necessary in the relationship between 
an element's structure and its position 
on the periodic table. Henry Moseley, 
a 25-years-old British physicist, had 
analyzed the X-ray spectra of fifty-one 
elements. He observed that there 
was a relation between an element's 
atomic number and the frequency of 
the X-rays it emits if bombarded by 
cathode rays. (An element's atomic 
number refers to how many electrons 
rotate about the nucleus of one of its 
atoms.) 
As a result of the work of this 
brilliant young man (killed while on 
active service at the Dardanelles in 
1915), seven more unfilled spaces on 
the periodic table were to gain new 
occupants. Besides the rhenium and 
francium already cited, these new ele- 
ments were technetium, promethium, 
hafnium, astatine and protactinium. 
The uncovering of these new elements, 
found in effect by a technique which 
Mendeleyev could not have known, 
in no way disrupted the original dis- 
position of the elements on his table. 
Shortly after Moseley's discovery, 
another Englishman, Frederick Soddy, 
introduced the notion of isotopes (from 
the Greek for “same places™). The 
isotopes of an element possess all the 
same chemical properties. Their 
physical properties are identical in 
every respect except that of the weight 
or “mass” of the atom. Most of the 
mass is situated in the atom’s nucleus, 
consisting of the proton carrying a 
positive electrical charge and the 
electrically neutral neutron. (The 
negatively charged “cloud” of plan- 
etary electrons consists of particles 
each having a mass of about 1/1,836 
the mass of the proton.) 
ODDY demonstrated, as 
did the Polish chemist Kasimir Fajans 
in that same year, 1913, that as an ele- 
ment disintegrates through radioactiv- 
ity, the new position it occupies on the 
periodic chart depends on the kind of 
radiation it gives off. Alpha-disinteg- 
ration (decay through the loss of 
alpha-particles) moves an element 
two spaces to the left on the table, 
whereas beta-disintegration of elec- 
tron emission moves the element one 
space to the right. 
It is true that there were some ano- 
malies in the method of aligning the 
elements as at first suggested by 
Mendeleyev. In a few cases he had 
listed slightly heavier elements before 
somewhat lighter ones. Tellurium 
(127.8) was placed before iodine 
(126.9), cobalt (58.9) ahead of nickel 
(58.7), and thorium (232.0) came before 
protactinium (231.0). 
After the standard of atomic numbers 
had been adopted, it was observed 
that if the elements were classified 
according to their nuclear electrical 
charges, their positions on the periodic 
table were just as Mendeleyev had 
predicted. lt is in this form that chem- 
istry students today are familiar with 
“that chart on the laboratory wall.” W

THE EAGLE IN MYTHOLOGY 
  
May | make two observations con- 
cerning the interesting article by Patro- 
cinio de Souza, “The. Eagle—Spacecraft 
of the pre-scientific Age”, concerning 
the symbolism of this bird in mytho- 
logy and legends, published in your 
June 1970 issue. 
In 1799, a hoard of 23 gold vases, 
dating from the 9th to the 11th century, 
was found at Sinnicolau Mare in 
western Romania. The origin of these 
vases, now in the History of Art Mu- 
seum, Vienna, has long been the subject 
of discussion; were they Bulgarian, 
Hungarian or Patzinak (the Mongolian 
people that settled to the north of the 
Black Sea during the 9th century)? 
The vases bear decorative elements 
in the style of the Persian art of the 
Sassanian era together with traces of 
Byzantine influence. On one of them 
(above left) a naked woman perhaps the 
goddess Venus, or the ancient Sassa- 
nian goddess of fertility Anahit, wearing 
a necklace, is being borne heavenwards 
in an eagle's claws; in her hands the 
woman holds two stylized flowers. On 
another vase (right) are two represen- 
tations of a man (probably Ganymede, 
cup-bearer of the god Zeus) being 
carried away by an eagle with spread 
wings; he too wears a necklace and in 
his right hand is a vessel of some 
kind which he is holding out towards 
the eagle's beak; in his left hand he 
has a stylized plant. 
Romanian folklore includes myths of 
the eagle carrying heroes and other 
personages up into the sky. One tale 
tells of a young princess carried off 
by an eagle to his eyrie at the top 
of a tree so high that it reaches the 
sky. In another Wallachian tale, an 
eagle carries away a young girl born 
from the thigh of an old man who had 
eaten an apple given him by Sfinta 
Viner: (otherwise known as "Saint Fri- 
day”, a character who appears in many 
Romanian legends—"Vineri” or “Fri- 
day” derives from the Latin “Veneris 
Dies”, “the Day of Venus”). In other 
legends, the hero, who has ventured 
into the “other world of dragons”, is 
saved by the eagle who brings him 
back to earth.

PHILIPPINE NATIONAL HERO 
 
Sir, 
My wife and | have read the “Unesco 
Courier” for some years with great 
interest, but as far as | am aware you 
have never published an article on 
José Rizal, the national hero of the 
Philippines, a man of great talent, wide 
interests and considerable personal 
courage. 
Letters to the Editor  
Doctor of Medicine and Philosophy, 
he was a gifted linguist with a know- 
ledge of some 22 languages. His best 
known works are “Noli Me Tangere” 
and “El Filibusterismo”. These describe 
life in the Philippines under Spanish 
rule. His writing eventually led to his 
execution on December 30, 1896. This 
day is now remembered as the Philippi- 
ne National Day. He was also a sculp- 
tor and poet and is remembered for the 
very moving poem “My Last Farewell” 
written in his last few hours. 
An article on this man—known as 
the Great Malay, the Pride of the Malay 
Race—could not fail to be of interest.

LOVE FOR CHILDREN 
Sir, 
You produce a very good magazine, 
but it lacks one very important subject 
—love for children. 
| hope you will not be surprised to 
know that humanity, or at least an 
absolute majority of it, needs to learn 
how truly to love children. 
Probably you would reason that love 
for children is a self-evident ‘pheno- 
menon or human feeling. To my mind 
this is not so. To love yourself in 
your children or to see your own inte- 
rests in them, to marvel at them, does 
not imply a true love for children. 
| think that if people everywhere 
learned to love the world's little ones, 
it would lead us much closer to a real 
and lasting Peace.

AUDIO-VISUAL AGGRESSION? 
Sir, 
That we are entering more and more 
the “culture of the image” is not in 
itself alarming, as long as the material 
transmitted by the modern media of 
mass communication remains truly cul- 
tural. What is disturbing is to witness 
a growing presentation of “images 
without ideas"—images that give birth 
to sub-standard culture or, worse still, 
to forms of anti-culture. 
Experimental productions of the 
“LSD cinema”, as screened by normal 
cinema and TV channels, may well be 
helpful to psychiatric and psychology 
students and researchers in studying 
the reactions of the public. But no 
reasoned and sensible educator would 
regard their public performance as jus- 
tified or acceptable, particularly when 
we know that children will make up at 
least one third of the audience. 
Psychedelic stimulants are no novelty. 
Their use for “scientific” experiments 
was attacked as long ago as 1939. 
Within a few years the public was 
horrified by revelations made at the 
Nuremberg Trial. These showed how 
audio-visual shocks coupled with other 
techniques for exerting pressure were 
used to destroy awareness of reality 
and the will to resist, and to inflict 
mental anguish. Such methods of creat- 
ing psychic tension were called “tor- 
ture”. Today they go by other names 
to which modern modes and fashions 
have given a more aseptic tinge. But 
when all is said and done the trau- 
matic effect is not so different. Perhaps 
the only difference is that in wartime 
they were practiced in the silence of 
prisons by the hands of torturers, 
whereas in time of peace, they are 
accepted by the public in daily doses 
prepared by the manipulators of audio- 
visual techniques.

NEGLECTED NOMADS 
Sir, 
| am conducting a project on the 
education of gypsy and travelling chil- 
dren for the Schools Council in Lon- 
don. Included in the study are children 
of nomad, itinerant and other migrant 
groups. The main purpose is to dis- 
tribute knowledge and experience about 
the nature of such children and about 
methods of teaching and curriculum 
successful with them. 
As it seems very much an interna- 
tional problem, | am appealing through 
the “Unesco Courier” to teachers and 
educational administrators also involv- 
ed with these children to get in touch 
with me so that an international dialo- 
gue may be started. Such a dialogue 
can only be mutually beneficial and may 
help to raise the educational level of 
this most neglected group of children.

WORLD VIEW OF HISTORY 
Sir, 
Contrary to the viewpoint of Mr. A. 
Bénésis (Letters, March 1971), | feel 
that history teaching in the majority of 
schools in the different states tends to 
inculcate in children and citizens a 
distorted sense of nationalism. 
| feel it is up to Unesco to make 
approaches to these states with a view 
to replacing such lessons by teaching 
based on a worldwide appreciation of 
history.

WE ARE ALL GUILTY 
Sir, 
The United Nations has designated 
1971 as International Year for Action 
to Combat Racism and Racial Discriml- 
nation, and in your February 1971 issue, 
His Holiness Pope Paul VI speaks of 
the growth of racial and religious 
discrimination and the menace it repre- 
sents to world peace. 
However, we should not only look at 
those few countries where discrimination 
is widespread and evident. Everybody 
can find traces of discrimination in his 
own milieu and everyone is guilty of 
some form of racial, group, religious 
or social discrimination. 
We should not generalize the possible 
faults of a few members of a racial or 
social group, race or religion and pro- 
ject them to the whole group. We 
should not forget that man is made by 
his environment and our aim should be 
to do everything possible to improve 
that environment.
