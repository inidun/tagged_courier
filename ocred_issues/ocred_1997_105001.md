To our readers 
Since our regular “Encounters” feature first appeared, 
on the inside front cover of the July 1989 issue, your tal- 
ented and imaginative contributions have abundantly 
illustrated the range of the creative cross-fertiliza- 
tion that the feature is intended to encourage. 
The invitation we issued then is still open to all our 
readers: “Send us a photo (of a painting, a sculpture, 
or a piece of architecture) which you regard as a good 
example of cultural cross-fertilization. Alternatively, 
send us pictures of two works from different cultural 
backgrounds in which you see a striking connection 
or resemblance. Please send a short caption with your 
photos. Each month we will publish one of your 
contributions.” 
In anticipation of many more rewarding encounters.

### 104976: Peace education is only meaningful if it leads to action

Johan Galtung 
Professor Johan Galtung, of Norway, is one of 
the founders of modern peace studies. He 
established the International Peace 
Research Institute, Oslo (PRIO), in January 
1959 and the Journal of Peace Researchin 
1964. He has published over 70 books, the 
most recent of whichis Peace by Peaceful 
Means: Peace and Conflict, Development and 
Civilization (Sage Publications/PRIO, 1996). 
Here Johan Galtung talks to the Courier 
about the guiding principles of his career as 
a peace theorist and a peace field-worker. 
Interview by Natascha Batic 
WM What is the educational purpose of peace 
studies? 
Johan Galtung: A major focus of peace education 
is to enable and empower people to handle eon- 
{licts more creatively and less violently. This is 
what I mean by peace education, and a lot of 
knowledge and skills, theory and practice are 
required for it. Peace studies is an applied social 
science, just as medicine is applied anatomy, 
physiology and pathology. It is only meaningful 
if it leads to action. The goal is not more books, 
hut more peace. 
WM How are peace studies structured? 
J.G.: To understand peace and violence we need 
to consider basic human needs—[for survival, 
well-being, freedom and identity. Development 
aims to promote those needs: violence insults 
them: peace preserves them. 
As I see it there are three types of violence 
and hence three types of peace: direct, struc- 
tural and cultural. Direet violenee insults human 
needs with the deliberate intention to hart and 
harm; structural violence does so more indirectly. 
Cultural violence is symbolic and refers to those 
aspects of our eultures that are nsed to legit- 
imize diveet or structural violence. 
These three notions can be taught dialecti- 
cally, with their negations—direct peace, strue- 
tural peace, eultural peace. It makes no sense to 
focus on only one of them. Conflict is part of a 
double, yin/yang totality: both Creator and 
Destroyer. Deep inside a conllict there are one or

more contradictions or incompatibilities. When 
handled creatively they can be the driving force 
of human soeial and moral development, Gandhi 
is a rich source of ercative and non-violent inspi- 
ration for the theory and practice of both sides 
of conflict. 
BM When did peace studies become a university 
discipline? 
J.G.: Sometime around the late 1960s and the 
early 1970s. Today the subject exists in some 
form in at least 500 universities and eolleges 
around the world, but mainly as a theoretical, lit- 
eraturc-oriented subject. 
Two leading centres for peace studies ave the 
European University Centre for Peace Studies 
(EPU) and particularly the courses in eivilian 
peace-keeping at the Austrian Study Centre for 
Peace and Conflict Resolution in Schlaining 
south of Vienna (which won the Unesco prize 
for peace education in 1993), and the Institute 
for Conflict Analyses and Resolution at George 
Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia (U.S.A). 
Theory and practice go hand in hand in each of 
these institutions. But many other places are 
coming up. We necd at least 1,000 of them with 
at least 10,000 graduates a year. 
BM What teaching methods are used? 
J.G.: They are not so different from those used in 
medicine. Theoretical work has to be combined 
with case studies and practice, but students 
should only go into the field when they are ready. 
Many do this too early, as amateurs or dilettantes, 
sometimes causing harm. Most never get closer to 
reality than some university library. (There is 
room for those, too.) 
But it cannot be said too strongly that peace 
studies ust be action-oriented and empowering 
for ordinary people in civil societies, 1 
MB What do you think of the idea that conflicts 
should not necessarily be avoided or suppressed, but 
that violence and destructiveness call for positive 
intervention? 
J.G.: This is a truism. In a sense it’s a bit like say- 
ing “weather should not necessarily be avoided 
or suppressed, but destructive, violent weather 
calls for some protection”. It makes me think of 
politicians and diplomats who talk about “con- 
flict” when they actually mean “violence”, and 
“peace” when they mean “cease-fire”. Suchisloppy 
talk makes people fail to see a conflict before it 
crupts into direct violence—and then they only sce 
its negative, destructive aspect. There is also a 
cominon failure to sce that the situation after a 
cease-fire is usually worse than before the vio- 
lence because of the invisible damage of violence, 
for instance to structure and culture. 
BM Is there a difference between ‘positive 
intervention’ and peacekeeping, peacemaking or 
peacebuilding? 
J.G.: There eertainly is! I would prefer people 
to be empowered for self-intervention rather 
than some managerial top-down intervention by 
others. Positiveintervention should be creative, 
non-violent and empathic. People should know 
how to do it. 
BM What do you feel about peace enforcement? 
J.G.: This is a very last resort, like a surgeon car- 
rying out an amputation. The term stands for 
violence, and in my experience violence breeds vio- 
lence, regardless of how many Security Council

THE UNESCO Coumier MN JANUARY 1997 
resolutions and “advanced dentocracies” stand 
behind it. 
BM One definition of conflict resolution is to use 
conflicts non-destructively and creatively ‘to 
promote needed social change’. Is social change an 
inherent part of human experience? 
J.G.: To me daoism gives the answer to this ques- 
tion. Contradietion is inherent in all life, and 
hence conilict is ubiquitous. ITuman needs and 
wishes are enormously complex. Society is sin 
pler, structured in response to formulas deep in 
the culture, and incapable of catering to all these 
needs and wishes. Some of them will be repressed 
and henee contradictions will germinate. Sooner 
or later they will surface in attitudes and behav- 
tour and lead to social conflict. Social change will 
be demanded to solve some problems, at the 
expense of creating others. And so on. That 
process is called history. 
BM When is social change necessary? 
J.G.: When the basic needs of human life and life 
in general have beeninsulted or there is a threat 
thereof, and when this is a structural/cultural 
process, i.e. not just the result of the whims of 
some ruler or ruling group. Democracies handle 
this better than non-democracies. That is why we 
need human rights, the whole repertory of the 
International Bill of [Tuman Rights, to intervene 
at the bottom of societies and protect minori- 
ties. The problem is that so far we rave only 
heard from the West; we also need the contri- 
butions of other civilizations. 
BW What is your own theory of social change? 
J.G.: IT could never be the slave of only one theory; 
Itry to he eclectic. Peace studies take you along 
all kinds of highways and byways. Ars longa, 
vita brevis. My theories are relatively complex, 
and in any concrete sitnation I would use as many 
of them—and others—ecleetically, as I would 
[ind necessary. 
In the late 1950s and early 1960s [ worked on 
rank-concordant, feudal and discordant systems 
inorder to locate sources of social change and on 
ways itt which concordant world structures eom- 
bine into highly rigid, imperialist structures. 
Since then I have been working on various 
forms of violence, visible and invisible, and their 
peace counterparts; and on the theory and prac- 
tice of reconciliation after violence. And also on 
deep cultures in various civilizations or social 
eosmologies as I call them, in an attempt to trace 
their impact on macro-history, particularly for 
peace and conflict and development, including 
the destruction of the social fabric, values and 
norms which is so rampant today. I have also 
been concerned with pathological cosmologies 
aud possible therapies; with the colleetive sub- 
conseious of various nations, and witli hard-soft 
and transcendent-immanent aspects of religions 
and other cultural manifestations. 
In philosophy I have heen eoncerned with apo- 
dictic thinking in the Occident and its role in 
utopianism and fundamentalism; especially as 
this is expressed in the leading ideology of the 
West today, cconomism based on egoeentric cost- 
benefit analysis. In political science L have worked 
on the origin of the state system from feudal tines 
and its pathologies. In economics Lhave been par- 
ticularly concerned with externalities and how 
they can be internalized in an equitable manner, 
both within and between countries in new trade 
theories. As a futurist L have been concerned with 
better, less violent social and world systems. All of 
these are or can be read as theories of peace and 
social change. 
As a peace and conflict worker Thave also been 
concerned with the fascinating steps involved in 
putting theory into practice; including my own 
efforts in twenty-five conflicts. So far. 
BM Can social change arise from a natural, 
spontaneous movement rather than force? 
J.G.: Sometimes it is natural, spontancons; some- 
times it is very deliberate. Sometimes it is non- 
violent, sometimes violent. I believe in deliberate 
change to veduee dukkha (suffering) and bring 
about sukha (happiness, enlightenment) as a 
Buddhist would say. It does not come by itsell. 
Working for this is itself sukhe. 
HM Is humankind doomed to live in a perpetual 
state of crisis? 
J.6.: No. Problems yes, erises no. There is no rea- 
son to be apocalyptic. Some problems, even 
crises, are solved; others arise, hopefully at a 
higher level, although [am far from sure of that. 
o ? oO 
HM How should we learn to discard the old and live 
with the new peacefully?

## [Page 7](105001engo.pdf#page=7) 0

### 104976: Peace education is only meaningful if it leads to action

J.G.: I don’t think we should. The point is not 
old/new but dukkhalsukha. Monksin amonastery 
often know more about this than people sur- 
rounded by possessions. And yet I do not think 
their truth is universal. Tam a strong believer in 
pluralism, not only in ideas but in social forma- 
tions, as long as they are nonviolent. The basic 
problem is not to do things that cannot be undone. 
Our action should be reversible. We may be wrong. 
If we do something irreversible thatis also wrong, 
we create violence for those who eome after us. 
Reversibility is for me a much better guide than 
universalizability. Non-violence follows from this 
principle since we eannot recreate life. 
BM When traditionally determined role 
relationships are disrupted, what is the role of 
culture as a means of understanding and 
communication? 
J.G.: That kind of disvuption happens all the 
time, and the result is what Durkheim called 
anomie, an absence of compelling values and 
norms. People then seek old or new sources of 
meaning, and many find them in what others call 
sects and try to discredit as “fundamentalism”. 
We shall get much, mueh more of this as we go 
on destroying not only cultures but old social 
fabrics in the name of globalization, ereating a 
soeicty of empty monads, what I call “atomic”. 
BM What role should international organizations 
play in this situation? 
J.G.: I see more possibilities for non-governmen- 
tal organizations (NGOs) than for inter-govern- 
mental organizations, given the pathologies of 
the state-system, particularly the narcissistic 
and paranoid behaviour of certain “big powers”. 
I think it was an act of genius on the part of the 
United Nations to give NGOs a voice during major 
UN conferences. This is our world civil society, 
our world public space. The NGOs will have to 
come to grips with the devastating impact of 
what passes for free markets, including labour 
flexibility on a global seale. The system is now 
creating mass unemployment and misery on a 
hitherto inconceivable seale, trying to destroy 
all alternatives. On the other hand, as I pointed 
out above, the alternatives will themselves bring 
in their wake new problems that will also have to 
be taken seriously. Such is life.

Johan Galtung conducts 
a seminar. 
Hl What can be done to make education for justice 
and peace efficient at grassroots level? 
J.G.: I think most of this education is invisible. 
The major teachers are still the mothers, the 
kindergarten workers, the millions teaching in 
elementary and other schools, the religious peo- 
ple in their churches, mosques and temples, peo- 
ple running organizations in a participatory man- 
ner, and many others. But often their messages 
are harsh, exclusive, filled with hatred. 
BW Whatis the impact of a worldwide form of 
communication to which there is no equal access? 
J.G.: There never has been a form of communication 
with perfeetly equal access. The range, speed and 
volume were always unequally distributed. But, if 
other social goods like edueation and money are 
reasonably distributed, then communication will 
follow, like the red telephones that dot the Japan- 
ese land- and city-scapes and are accessible to 
almost everyone. I am more worried about one-way 
communication like TV, and the enormous amount 
of disinformation traveling on those famous high- 
ways, all the virtual realities we are encouraged 
to confuse with the reality where real people meet 
their real duh kha and sukhia. That is the world we 
live in and peace studies tvy to come to grips with 
one bundle of problems: violence. Communication 
is one of the tools. Education, formal and infor- 
mal, is another. I see that as a source of light in our 
dark century. [|

poverty gap by Bahgat Elnadi and Adel Rifaat 
For most of us the words finance, credit, savings and investment call to mind 
the world of big business and banking activities on a very large scale. 
The idea that these major financial circuits could somehow be miniatur- 
ized might seem to flyin the face of reason. For some time, however, this 
is what has been happening. 
Finance and poverty no longer inhabit two different worlds. On every 
continent tens of millions of families who once lived on the margins of soci- 
ety now have access to facilities for credit, savings and investment on a 
very small scale. The term microfinance has been coined to describe their 
transactions. So important has microfinance become that a world summit 
is being devoted to it this coming February in Washington, D.C. 
What has happened to bring about this departure from traditional 
banking practice? What are the real conditions that underlie this change? 
What can be expected from it, especially as a weapon in the war on 
poverty? This issue of the Unesco Courier attempts to answer these and other 
important questions about microfinance. 
No one imagines that microfinance is a panacea for poverty. But it can 
indubitably bring hope to men and especially to women, many of themillit- 
erate, whose economic activities have hitherto been so precarious and spo- 
radic that they have never been statistically recorded. The hope is that they 
can break out of the vicious circle of destitution and escape from the 
humiliations of lifelong rejection by society. 
But what is really new is not that these people are beginning to feel 
the stirrings of hope, but that certain banks are starting to take them 
seriously and are responding by reviewing their goals and methods and 
adjusting to the demands of small-scale economic activity. 
Perhaps this is because poverty in many countries has reached such pro- 
portions that itis threatening to throttle economic activity, destroy social 
cohesion and sabotage development. When the gap between poverty and 
prosperity becomes so flagrantly wide, when the numbers of the unem- 
ployed, of society's outsiders and rejects become so high, there comes a 
moment when the only question worth asking is what can be done to 
bring them back into the community. oy

\G 
REACHED 
ver the past two decades, local 
institutions in different parts of 
the world have developed innov- 
ative mechanisms to provide credit 
and savings facilities for those who were tra- 
ditionally excluded from the formal financial 
sector. These “microfinance institutions” 
(MFIs) have devised original financial services 


### 104977: Reaching the unreached

delivery systems for the very poor and have 
succeeded in reaching segments of the popu- 
lation previously unreached by such facilities. 
They have demonstrated that, contrary to 
conventional wisdom, the poor are good credit 
risks and have high savings propensity. 
MFIs arc now operating in rural and urban 
arcas of Asia, Latin America and Africa within 
a wide range of social, cultural and economic 
environments. They use different methodolo- 
gies, have a number of institutional arrange- 
ments and exist in a variety of policy settings, 
but share a common concern: the alleviation of 
poverty. 
The methodology most frequently used 
 
by the leading MFIs is that of “group lending” 
to units ranging in size from small three-to- 
ten member “solidarity groups” to village 
banks composed of approximately thirty to 
fifty members. Group members collectively 
guarantee loan repayment, and access to sub- 
sequent loans is dependent on successful 
repayment by all of them. Risks and admin- 
istrative costs per borrower are thus reduced 
and the group guarantee serves as a substitute 
for collateral requirements. 
Growing demand 
MFIs provide very small short-term loans, 
usually for twelve months. The prospect of 
subsequent larger loans is a strong motivation 
for repayment. Although most MFIs chargea 
relatively high rate of interest, the repayment 
rate 1s notable and demand is increasing, sug- 
gesting that it is not the cost but the timely 
and continual availability of microfinance 
which is important for poor clients. 
The initial focus was on micro-credit facil-

ities, and 1t tended to be forgotten that pro- 
vision for saving can be as important as credit 
if not more so, for poor rural houscholds. In 
more recent programmes, however, increased 
attention is being paid to mobilizing volun- 
tary savings in order to make loans more 
widely available. 
MFIs are based on the principle that provi- 
sion of financial services for the poor must be sit- 
uated in localities close to the clients, and func- 
tion as a set of small local units linked by a 
central body. Several of them have made a specific 
policy decision to target poor women, first 
because access to resources and services is even 
more difficult for them than it is for men, and 
second because of their stronger repayment per- 
formance and willingness to form groups. 
Although successful MFIs in different parts 
of the world have removed conventional mis- 
conceptions about the “bankability” of the 
poor, it must not be forgotten that their ser- 
vices do not reach the majority of the world’s 
poor. Having overcome the initial obstacles to

obtaining funds and authorization to set up 
their programmes, the MFIs thus face the chal- 
lenge of expanding their operations. With this 
in view they are trying to reach a stage where, 
independent of external funds or subsidies, all 
their costs are met from interest charges, and 
loan capital requirements are met by borrow- 
ing from local commercial sources. 
So far, only a handful of commercial banks 
have shown interest in taking on the microfi- 
nance client group. This is because the legal 
and regulatory framework within which the 
formal financial institutions operate is not 
favourable to microfinance practices. Policies 
which maintain interest rates artificially low, 
especially for credit to the poor, do not allow 
the banks to cover their costs and so they have 
remained outside this field. A fresh approach 
to this question would encourage the formal 
banks to extend their reach to sections of the 
population they have hitherto ignored. 
Social and cultural 
support programmes 
Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) 
have played a vital role in channelling credit 
and other services to the poor, and growing 
numbers of them are moving towards trans- 
forming themselves into full-fledged institu- 
tions specializing in finance. NGOs working 
at the grassroots level can help commercial 
banks to reach the poorest clients in remote 
arcas and, where required, monitor, supervise 
and collect loans. 
But in order to alleviate poverty for more 
than a billion people today, progress in the 
field of microfinance will have to be comple- 
mented with supporting programmes and ser- 
vices, notably taking into account the social 
and cultural dimensions of development. The 
responsibility for devising mechanisms to 
ensure that these additional services also reach 
a maximum number of poor households 
resides not with the MFIs but with other 
development partners. 
UNESCO is exceptionally well placed to take 
up this challenge. It can contribute to the cam- 
paign to explore ways and ineans of increasing 
access to microfinance for the poor on a com- 
mercially viable basis and to develop new tech- 
niques for providing appropriate services to 
this difficult-to-reach population. With this 
in view, UNESCO has entered into a co-operation 
agreement with the Grameen Bank (sce page 
23). It envisages similar forms of collaboration 
designed to support the clients of other suc- 
cessful MFIs with complementary programmes 
in the fields of education, science and technol- 
ogy, and culture and communication. |

A NEW WEAPON IN THE WAR ON POVERTY

tall began with a simple question. What 
operational definition can governments 
or co-operation agencies use for poverty, 
independently of the sufferings of the 
needy? In other words, what should anti- 
poverty programmes try to do and how 
should their success be measured? 
After some hesitation, economists came up 
with a practical definition that incorporated 
scales of poverty and measured progress in alle-

viating it. A person who has a much lower 
income than that of the rest of the population 
and who is deprived of any real access to basic 
services (health, lodging and education) is 
regarded as living in poverty. In a given popu- 
lation, the poor are those whose incomes are 
lowest and who therefore consume least. They 
are those who have the worst quality of life, 
since they are excluded from the public services 
which the state provides for its citizens. Poverty 
alleviation, in this context, means focusing on 
a precise target—those sections of the popula- 
tion with a much lower income than the rest— 
via these two parameters. A poverty alleviation 
programme achieves its goal if it produces a 
sustainable increase in the income of the poor- 
est segments of the population. 
Self-help projects 
Of course formulating an operational defini- 
tion does not mean that we have the financial 
muscle to get rid of poverty. Developing coun- 
try governments and co-operation agencies 
do not possess sufficient resources to grant 
subsidies that would sustainably increase the 
income of each person defined as poor. Any 
large-scale increase in the income of needy peo- 
ple must come from elsewhere. 
Very early on, some developing countries— 
mainly in Asia—realized that this “elsewhere” 
could be the poor themselves, on condition 
that they were associated with poverty allevi- 
ation policies. After all, they reasoned, many 
needy people have sufficient initiative and 
energy to devise small projects or activities 
that, once underway, could increase their 
income. By providing successive increases in 
income, such projects could gradually lift these 
people out of poverty without direct and mas- 
sive state intervention. 
Before this could happen, obstacles to the 
creation of small projects had to be identified, 
and the poor who so wished had to be pro-

vided with the wherewithal to get round them. 
One of the chief obstacles was credit, which 
banks do not usually channel to small-scale 
projects, especially those undertaken by the 
poor, who arc by definition not very credit- 
worthy. By granting credit sclectively to the 
enterprising poor, governments and co-oper- 
ation agencies hoped to initiate a sequence of

alleviating poverty. Here was the first link 
between credit and poverty. 
From credit to savings 
But generating additional income by granting 
credit to the working poor only alleviates 
poverty among a small part of the population. 
What about the rest, the overwhelming major- 
ity? Credit is of no use to this majority, but sav- 
ings certainly are 
To understand this, it is necessary to analyse 
what actually happens in the poorest and most 
isolated parts of developing countries. In these 
regions all monetary transactions are made in 
cash. Since there are no banks, people have to 
kcep all their possessions with them. A trans- 
action can only be completed if each party to 
it has a wad of notes, with the concomitant 
risk of loss and theft. At best, someone who 
wants to “invest” his savings can do so by 
purchasing ananimal. In these circumstances it 
is difficult for the very poor to accumulate 
sufficient resources to escape from poverty. 
The absence of institutions that make 1t pos- 
sible to transform cash into a deposit and then 
into savings is a hidden but genuine rcason 
why poverty is so intractable and persistent.

### 104980: A New weapon in the war on poverty

The poor cannot save effectively and trans- 
actions between them involve countless diffi- 
culties because thereare no on-the-spot financial 
intermediaries to provide the basic financial ser- 
vices that would permit the emergence of eco- 
nomic activities to lift their region from poverty. 
In addition to credit, then, microfinance— 
the process which encourages the development 
of financial intermediation at the local level— 
is one of the most powerful weapons in the

struggle against poverty and cconomic isola- 
tion. Banks, specialized non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs) or a combination of 
the two are the architects of this development. 
The next steps 
In the traditional method of doing business or 
saving, a poor person needs common sense 
but does not need to know how to read or 
write. On the other hand, in a relationship 
with a financial intermediary—and in the 
world that the financial intermediary gradually 
creates around itself—pcople must become lit- 
erate; they must participate culturally in the 
world of reading and writing. Traditional busi- 
nessmen carrying their money in their pock- 
cts transact business which is their own affair 
and no one else’s. When they open a bank 
account, however, they must understand that 
the money they deposit is also going to serve 
others—the people to whom the bank issues 
credit. They must understand that this money 
1s both theirs and other people’s. They must 
recognize and accept a fact of life of which 
they were ignorant. 
This explains why the arrival of microfi- 
nance is profoundly disturbing for some soci-

### 104980: A New weapon in the war on poverty

cties. The mechanisms of traditional relation- 
ships with self, others and the community 
are shaken. The very structure of language can 
become an obstacle, as in some southern 
African languages where the same verb desig- 
nates the act of borrowing and lending. Co- 
operation agencies must therefore be cautious 
and avoid prejudice. A credit scheme in which 
40 per cent of borrowers do not repay their 
loans is not necessarily a bad scheme in itself. 
If four borrowers out of ten have not kept 
their end of the bargain, it is because repay- 
ment of a loan within a given time frame is 
behaviour that is not innate but is acquired 
culturally in societies where borrowing is 
widely practised. A good scheme must take 
these factors into account in its initial analy- 
sis of the local population’s needs. 
The challenge 
Microfinance’s main challenge will soon cease 
to be financial and become cultural, educa- 
tional and social. Bilateral and multilateral co- 
operation agencies working with the World 
Fictermens huts on the 
banks of the Mekong River. 
Bank and the leading microfinance networks 
have met to examine all the financial questions 
that microfinance can raise. In two or three 
years’ time, the different methods of imple- 
menting microfinance systems will all have 
been tested. 
The next step will be to build on the far- 
reaching revolution begun by the Asian pio- 
neers, Grameen and Bank Rakyat Indonesia 
(BRI), continued by others such as BancoSol 
in Latin America and taken further by African 
initiatives such as the Kenya Rural Enterprise 
Programme (K-Rep). 
Microfinance opens doors by creating sol- 
idarity groups, by insisting on the necd for 
personal repayment disciplines and by think- 
ing of individual activities in social terms. If it 
1s to develop, action must be taken to pro- 
mote literacy, education, craft learning and 
health care among the populations itis aimed 
at and via the social structures it has set up. 
Only this cultural, educational and social 
development will keep microfinance in sight of 
its original purpose and ensure that it remains 
a weapon in the war on poverty. n

iny economic units operating at the 
margin of the “modern” sector or 
outside it are the major source of 
employment in urban areas through- 
out the developing world. In some cities, more 
than half of the economically active popula- 
tion arc employed in these “microenter- 
prises”as carpenters, shoemakers, street ven- 
dors, trash recyclers, and in innumerable other 
businesses of varying sizes and sophistication. 
Microenterprises operate outside the laws 
and regulations that govern formal business 
activity. They are not licensed as businesses, 
generally do not fulfil the legal labour require- 
ments (social security, benefits, taxation), and 
BY MARIA OTERO

operate informally, often employing non- 
paid family members. Other characteristics 
include a lack of division of labour or special- 
ization in the workplace, lack of accounting 
procedures, serious limitations in accessing 
capital, the prevalence of businesses located in 
the owner’s home, and more important, the 
lack of access to information, technology, 
training and bank credit. 
Although some microenterprises belong 
to relatively well-to-do individuals, the vast 
majority of their owners come from the poor- 
est sectors of the population and have seldom 
completed secondary education. Most 
microentrepreneurs live in the slums of large 
cities and therefore lack access to public services 
and to adequate housing. 
The technology for lending to microen- 
terprises has improved greatly in the last few 
years through the work of such institutions 
as Bank Rakyat Indonesia (sce page 24), the 
Grameen Bank (see page 20) and ACCION 
International (see page 28). The lending

schemes run by these institutions share the 
following core characteristics that make them 
highly effective: 
« Familiarity with the market. Microenter- 
prise institutions know that the poor arc will- 
ing to pay for access and convenience. Their 
major nced is for small short-term loans to 
cover working capital needs and liquidity con- 
straints. 
Microentreprencurs nced these loans 
quickly with little paperwork or other time- 
consuming requirements. Microenterprise 
institutions locate branches near the client, 
provide simple application procedures and 
disburse funds quickly. The institutions charge 
interest rates that are higher than commercial 
banks, but much lower than the moneylenders 
who are the major source of credit for the 
poor. 
« Techniques to cut administrative costs. 
Successful microenterprise institutions use 
the simplest procedures to distribute very 
small loans. Loan applications often fit onto 
one page, and approval processes are decen- 
tralized. Most institutions use group lending 
techniques in which borrowers guarantee each 
others’ loans and also assume part of the loan 
processing burden. These groups are often 
comprised of three to five individual microen- 
treprencurs and are modeled on the informal 
savings and loans groups that exist through- 
out the world. The group—known as a soli- 
darity group or peer group—receives a loan 
via one transaction, divides it among its mem- 
bers and assumes responsibility for managing 
the loan. 
@ Techniques to motivate repayment. 
Microenterprise institutions also use small 
groups as mechanisms to assure repayment by 
everyone in the group. The promise of repeat 
loans in increasing amounts is available to 
those—whether in individual or group lend- 
ing schemes—who pay back on time. This 
assurance of continued access to credit is a 
powerful incentive that has cnabled effective 
microenterprise institutions to maintain very 
low loan loss rates, often below 2 per cent. 
The application of these lending principles 
enables microenterprise institutions to accom- 
plish two key goals: to expand their outreach 
so they can reach tens or hundreds of thou- 
sands of borrowers; and to cover their costs 
through the income carned, thereby becoming 
self-sufficient in the long term. The most 
advanced institutions have demonstrated that 
they can cover their operational and financial 
costs and therefore are able to make the tran- 
sition from donor money to borrowed funds 
from commercial lending institutions. HM 
FINANCE 
FOR THE NEEDY 
The Grameen Bank (Bangladesh) is probably the best-known micro- 
finance institution in the world. It started as an action research pro- 
gramme in 1976 and was transformed into an independent bank by 
government ordinance in 1983. Operating throughout rural 
Bangladesh, the Grameen Bank mainly serves very poor women. (See 
page 20) 
The Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI) is a state-owned commer- 
cial bank. BRI's Unit Desa (banking) System is an extensive network 
of unit-banks operating throughout Indonesia as an independent 
profit centre. The voluntary savings scheme which it designed mobi- 
lizes considerable amounts of savings, and loans are fully financed 
by these deposits. The Unit Desa is a significant source of profit for 
BRI. (See page 24). 
The Kenya Rural Enterprise Programme (K-Rep) was established 
in 1984, and in 1987 became a non-governmental organization 
(NGO) working in both rural and urban areas. Initially K-Rep promoted 
Kenyan NGOs’ credit programmes by providing grants, training and 
technical assistance and later developed its own direct lending pro- 
gramme. (See page 30). 
The Foundation for International Community Assistance 
(FINCA) is a U.S.-based nonprofit organization that specializes in 
rural credit. FINCA developed the village banking methodology and 
administers programmes using this methodology in different parts 
of the world. (See page 32). 
Banco Solidario, S.A. (BancoSol) started operations in 1992 
as the first private commercial bank devoted solely to microenterprises. 
It operates in major cities throughout Bolivia. BancoSol grew out of 
PRODEM, an NGO affiliated with ACCION International, a U.S.-based 
non-profit organization. (See page 28).

### 104983: Where credit is due

WHERE CREDIT IS DUE... 
BY ROBERT PECK CHRISTEN 
M embers of a

(Indonesia). 
THE UNESCO Couritrm JANUARY 1997 
ave you ever tried to sell half a goat 
without killing it because you only 
needed ten dollars? The question 
may seem absurd butitsumsup a 
dilemma that faces many poor people in the 
developing world. Saving and lending are part 
of their everyday lives, as they are for the rich. 
However, economists would say, they have 
fewer options than the rich for managing their 
liquidity through financial instruments and 
they save in inferior stores of value—such as 
goats and construction materials. 
For the privilege of having more money up 
front (loans), you pay. This is because the lender 
cannot be totally certain that you will be able 
to fully repay the amount advanced against 
your future cash flow and probably has other 
opportunities in which to invest the money 
advanced to you. The borrower’s greatest con- 
cern is not what interest rate I am going to 
charge him or how profitable the venture will 
be that he undertakes with my resources, but 
rather, when and how much will he have to 
repay. Avery profitable business opportunity 
or a great personal need may have motivated 
 
him to borrow a certain amount in the first 
place. Maybe the quality of my credit service 
made him choose me over my competitor. But 
ultimately, his decision to enter into a credit 
agreement with me has much more to do with 
whether I can offer him repayment terms that 
coincide with his projected cash flow so he can 
meet his payments safely. 
Going the whole hog 
To use a common example from microlending. 
Many village banking programmes lend tiny 
amounts of money to very poor women so 
that they can initiate an economic activity such 
as fattening a hog. Most of these lending 
methodologies require repayment on a weekly 
or monthly instalment basis since this tech- 
nique scems to reduce the levels of default 
among borrowers. In fact, repayment levels 
among women who fatten hogs they buy on 
credit 1s very high. 
But where do they get the money to repay 
the loan? Clearly it can’t come from the hog. 
It must come from some other income source. 
In fact, we often see careful microentrepre- 
neurs setting the amount of their instalment 
loan payment to the value of sources of income 
they receive onasteady basis such as rent from 
property they own or salaries someone in the 
household receives, irrespective of the cash 
flow they expect to receive from the invest- 
ment activity carried out with the loan. 
When does a microloan generate economic 
“development”, if it essentially fulfils a cash 
flow management function? 
Itcan dosoinanumber of ways. When the 
up-front nature of a credit relationship allows 
microentrepreneurs and small farmers to take 
advantage of a specific economic opportunity, 
they can increase their incomes. When, through 
access to credit, borrowers reduce their costs by 
purchasing in larger volumes, take advantage of 
sales of discounted merchandise, and replace an

informal moneylender, they can generate an 
immediate increase in income. Microentrepre- 
neurs may also use a loan to increase their sales 
by financing their clients to allow them to 
pay in instalments for the goods they have 
purchased. Credit may allow borrowers to 
increase their productive or commercial capac- 
ity through the purchase of major asscts more 
rapidly than would be possible through the 
simple reinvesting of the proceeds of their 
businesses. Credit may allow them to under- 
take activities which they would otherwise 
not have the resources to finance.

small farmers and fishermen, and others who 
carn their living independently could benefit 
from the efficient provision of microcredit ser- 
vices on the part of specialized financial insti- 
tutions. They cannot take advantage of cco- 
nomic opportunities that they sce out there, 
because they do not have access to rapid and 
appropriate sources of finance at reasonable rates 
of interest. This fact has led many to enthusi- 
astically endorse the idea that “credit creates 
cconomic opportunity, hence development”. 
A dangerous illusion 
This simplistic belief lies at the heart of the 
failure of many microcredit schemes to achieve 
high repayment rates. The sponsors and 
administrators of these failed programmes 
forget that it is economic opportunity that 
creates greater income potential and, eventually, 
prosperity. Only when credit allows individ- 
uals to take advantage of cconomic opportu- 
nity can it contribute to prosperity. 
No amount of credit to small farmers who 
produce traditional staple crops has allowed 
them to leave poverty behind, as long as farm 
gate prices remain depressed to favour urban 
consumers, rural marketing and physical infra- 
structure remain undeveloped, and rural tech- 
nology remains inappropriately simple. Rather, 
rural credit programmes to traditional farmers

» land once their indebtedness reached unaccept- 
ablelevels. 
Successful microenterprise credit initiatives 
over the past twenty-five years have focused 
their loans on target groups who, through 
credit, could gain access to real economic 
opportunity. Concretely, most concentrated 
their lending in non-farm enterprises that had 
been in existence for at least one year prior to 
the loan, and that demonstrated a clear repay- 
ment capacity. 
These programmes have funded individu- 
als and the cash flow of their ongoing business 
activities. By considerably shortening average 
Joan terms, they opened the opportunity to 
re-lend to the same clients greater amounts if 
their business had prospered with the original 
loan. If, on the other hand, as frequently hap- 
pens, the projected increase in sales failed to 
materialize, the loan repayment was not nec- 
essarily jeopardized since it was based on the 
cash flow stream of the original level of busi- 
ness activity. 
Encouraging results 
An intuitive grasp of the essentially fungible 
nature of loan funds led the organizers of these 
programmes to the conclusion that it was 
fruitless to spend great effort tracking the end 
usc of funds, once disbursed. Instead, they 
saw the merit of developing a long-term rela- 
tionship with clients and found that by get- 
ting to know them over a series of financial 
transactions the credit risk would be consid- 
erably reduced. They developed community or 
peer group based lending technologies that 
generated information about potential par- 
ticipants’ willingness to repay and generated 
incentives to do so. 
These approaches produced results. Better 
programmes were routinely able to produce and 
sustain repayment levels above 98 per cent. Since 
the loans went to low-income individuals who, 
through credit, gained access to real economic 
opportunity, it was possible to charge suffi- 
ciently high rates of interest to fully cover oper- 
ating costs. When programmes recover 98 per 
cent of their loans and more than cover their 
operating costs, they can grow exponentially 
and serve ever greater markets. Furthermore, the

shown that a well functioning financial system 
will make a big contribution to overall local 
prosperity as confidence in financial systems

n 1972, the year after Bangladesh became 
independent, I began to teach economics 
at one of the country’s universities. Two 
years later the country was hit by a dev- 
astating famine. On the campus I was teaching 
complicated theories of development while 
outside people were dying in hundreds. Con- 
ventional economics suddenly seemed hollow. 
The classroom was a world apart from the real- 
ity of poverty and struggle outside. I left it 
and stepped out into the villages of Bangladesh. 
I started talking to people for whom life 
was an endless struggle for survival and learned 
things that I had never encountered in text- 
books. I met a woman who worked hard mak- 
ing bamboo stools. At the end of cach day she 
had made only two pennies, hardly enough 
to buy two decent meals. I could not under- 
stand how anyone could work so hard for so 
long and receive so little. I found out that to

buy her raw material she had to borrow from 
atrader, who took most of the money and left 
the woman with very little. I realized that if 
the money she needed were available at normal 
interest rates the woman would earn enough to 
reinvest and make higher profits. She could earn 
a decent living and escape from poverty. 
I spoke to forty-two other people in the 
village who were trapped in poverty because 
they were dependent on loans from traders 
and money-lenders. Their total credit require- 
ment was only thirty dollars. I lent them the 
money out of my own pocket. I thought that 
if normal banking institutions would do like- 
wise, these people could leave poverty behind. 
However, conventional banking institutions 
do not make loans to the poor, especially to 
rural women. 
The bankers I met laughed at me. They did 
not think it was their business to hand out

small amounts of money to the poor. They 
did not think it was possible to hand out 
money without collateral. Since poor people 
by definition had no collateral, the banks 
refused to deal with them. I went from one 
bank to another. They all said the same. I 
offered to act as guarantor for the loans. This 
was acceptable to them for a few more loans, 
amounting to a few hundred dollars. 
All the poor people who contracted these 
loans repaid the money. I went back to the 
banks, showing this as proof that poor peo- 
ple repay their debts and that there was no 
need to insist on collateral. The bankers said, 
it may work in this one village but it wouldnt 
work in many. I tried the same scheme in many 
villages. All the poor people who borrowed 
paid back. I went back to the banks. They said 
it may work in a few villages but it won’t 
work 1n an entire district. So I extended the 
scheme to an entire district. It worked. The 
banks remained unpersuaded. 
I said to myself, why am I running after the 
bankers? Why don’t I solve the problem by 
setting up my own bank? And so I asked the 
Central Bank and the Government for per- 
mission to set up a special bank for poor peo- 
ple. It took a long time but the Government 
finally gave permission in 1983. Grameen Bank 
was born as an independent bank, a bank for 
the poor! 
Banks that lend only 
to the rich 
The conventional banking system has been 
deliberately designed to be anti-poor, gender 
biased, and anti-illiterate. 
The idea of “collateral”, which bankers 
regard as sacred, is to push the poor away from 
banks. But any good banker who looked at

» our banking system in Bangladesh would be 
horrified. Millions of dollars arc lent to very 
rich people who never bother to pay back. The 
repayment rate of our industrial banks, which 
lend money to rich people in the name of 
industrialization, has been less than 10 per 
cent over the past fifteen years. “Why call your- 
self a bank?” Task them. “Why not take your 
signboard down and put up anew one saying 
something like ‘Charity Organization for the 
Rich’?” 
Banks do not like women. They do not 
want to lend money to women. There are 
“Ladies’ Branches” all over Dhaka city designed 
to serve women only—i.e., designed to get their 
money. Lending to them is a very different 
story. Ina Bangladeshi bank, if a woman wants 
ta borrow money, she is asked whether she has 
discussed it with her husband. If she says “Yes” 
she is asked, “Is he supportive of your pro- 
posal?” If the answer is still “Yes”, she isasked 
to bring him along to talk the matter over. No 
male borrower is asked whether he has dis- 
cussed the idea with his wife, or whether she is 
supportive of it, or whether he would like to 
bring her along to discuss the proposal. I would 
think that less than 1 per cent of borrowers in 
Bangladesh are women. There must be some- 
thing wrong with the system. 
Banks demand that clients write everything 
down. In Bangladesh, where 75 per cent of the 
people cannot read and write, this is a ridicu- 
lous situation. Even when people bring money 
to deposit in the bank, they have to write 
down every detail on paper. I asked why banks 
cannot simply take moncy and issue a receipt 
saying “received such and such an amount of 
moncy from such and such a person?” Why 
must the depositor have to do all this writing? 
When first challenged this notion, bankers 
asked me how records could be kept without 
reading and writing. My reply was that banks 
could issue receipts for amounts received or 
disbursed, and that all the necessary account- 
ing could be done by the bank. Why punish 
the illiterate person? 
The Grameen system 
Grameen Bank now operates in over half the 
villages of Bangladesh. It has over two million 
members, 94 per cent of whom are women. Over 
$1.7 billion have been disbursed so far, and more 
than 300,000 houses have been built with 
Grameen housing loans. Depositors, saving only 
onc or two taka per week, have managed to save 
over $120 million. This has been achieved because 
Grameen Bank is pro-poor, pro-women and 
supportive of the illiterate. 
Grameen Bank rejected collateral-based 
banking as a structural impediment to the par- 
ticipation of the poor, and introduced instead 
group-based lending and peer monitoring to 
ensure both the selection of needy clients and 
HE unesco (Ourter m jaNUAR 1997 
the maintenance of high repayments. Groups 
of fiveare formed with members from homo- 
gencous backgrounds who know and trust 
cach other. Six to eight groups are integrated in 
one centre. Each village will generally have one 
or two centres. Instead of making people come 
to the bank, Grameen goes to the people. All 
financial transactions take place at weekly cen- 
tre meetings. This lowers transaction costs as . 
well as making the banking institution sub- 
ordinate to people’s needs. 
Ninety four per cent of Grameen mem- 
bers are women. This emphasis on women is 
based on the fact that women are the most 
oppressed within the ranks of the poor and, 
more importantly, because giving credit to 
poor women translates into greater welfare 
within the household. Unlike men, women 
in rural Bangladesh spend almost all their earn- 
ings on the family and plan for the family’s 
future. There is also a social dimension to the 
emphasis on women group members. Women 
who had earlier rarely ventured out of their 
houses now come to group meetings; women 
who had previously never handled cash now 
keep accounts and engage in financial transac- 
tions; women who had never been visible in 
public now become assertive and confident. 
Most Grameen members have no formal 
schooling. At Grameen they arc taught to sign 
their names, to count and keep accounts. Bank- 
ing procedures are simple and transparent. 
Members discuss among themselves and learn 
to keep track of their money without having 
to use difficult forms. Simple receipts arc 
issucd so that record keeping is simplified.

UNESCO AND THE GRAMEEN BANK 
In September 1995, Unesco signed a memorandum of understanding with the Grameen Bank in which 
the two organizations pledged to combat poverty by joining forces in their specific areas of com- 
petence. UnEsco’s participation in the co-operation scheme has so far involved: 
designing a basic education programme for Grameen borrowers and their families directly 
related to their economic activities; 
«providing the Bank with technical assistance in setting up a company which now brings 
cellular telephones to needy rural women in Bangladesh; 
«supplying expert advice on the exploitation of solar power and other renewable energy 
sources; 
“#" organizing training programmes and workshops for Member States interested in adopting 
the Grameen Bank model. Aworkshop for Central Asian countries was held at Bishkek (Kyrgyzstan) 
in March 1996 and has been followed up by a study visit of the Grameen banking mechanism in 
Bangladesh.

and end inequality and gender discrimina- 
tion, microcredit in Bangladesh, as practised by 
the Grameen Bank, has provided one simple 
strategy that works. 
Poverty alleviation 
initiatives 
We at Grameen, however, arc not content to 
stop here. We dare to dream of microcredit 
paving the way for poverty alleviation once 
and for all. The Grameen family is thus work- 
ing on expanding agricultural productivity 
through environment-friendly integrated agri- 
cultural methods. Weare promoting the devel- 
opment of fisheries. We are expanding local 
markets by linking weavers from the heart- 
land of Bangladesh to retail outlets in the 
United States and Europe through the export 
of “Grameen check” clothing. 
We strongly believe that the most advanced 
technology should be appropriated by the poor. 
We are thus working on harnessing solar and 
wind energy, and on providing teleccommuni- 
cation facilities to every village in Bangladesh. 
This will not be organized by wealthy corpo- 
rations. Access to credit will ensure that poor 
rural men and women are both the owners and 
users of such products and services. ||

### 104986: Microfinance in Indonesia

MICROFINANCE IN INDONESIA 
BY MARGUERITE S. ROBINSON 
A branch of the Bank Rakyat 
Indonesia. 
     
  
He unesco (COURICR B jANUARY 1997 
ithin the last two decades, the 
Bank Rakyat 
(BRI), a large state-owned 
Indonesia 
commercial bank, has shown 
via its “unit desa” or local banking system 
that the demand for microfinance can be met 
sustainably on a large scale. 
BRI has traditionally been specially 
assigned by the government to provide bank- 
ing services to the rural areas of Indonesia with 
particular emphasis on agricultural credit. In 
the carly 1970s it developed its unit desa sys- 
tem in order to provide subsidized govern- 
ment credit to rice farmers. More than 3,600 
local bank units were established, function- 
ing primarily as channelling agents for subsi- 
dized rural lending programmes. 
The long-term results were similar to those 
found in many other developing countries. 
First, the low-interest, and therefore desir- 
able, loans tended to reach local elites who had 
the influence to obtain them. Secondly, lower- 
income people typically did without credit 
or borrowed on the informal commercial mar- 
  
Sal

ket for much higher interest rates. Thirdly, 
both arrears and losses were high. 
Savings accounts began to be offered in the 
unit banks in the mid-1970s. However, annual 
interest rates were set by the government at 
12 per cent for loans and 15 per cent for most 
deposits; given this negative spread the bank 
could not cover the operating and other costs 
required to attract voluntary savings. By 1983 
the unit banking system had reached a point 
at which it would have to be either closed 
down or converted into a fundamentally dif- 
ferent system. 
Wrong assumptions 
During the 1970s, the unit banking system 
had mobilized deposits of only about $17 
million nation-wide. This was widely attrib- 
uted within the government and the formal 
financial sector to the lack of local demand for 
financial services, absence of “bank-minded- 
ness” and mistrust of banks that were assumed 
to characterize Indonesia’s rural population. 
These assumptions were wrong. 
In June 1983 the first of a series of major 
financial reforms was announced. Government 
banks were now permitted to set their own 
interest rates on most loans and deposits. 
Among its other purposes, this deregulation 
served to provide an enabling environment 
for the transformation of BRI’s local banking 
system. Following the reforms, the govern- 
ment decided that the subsidized unit banks 
would be converted into a sustainable system 
of commercial banking at the local level, and 
that a programme of general rural credit at 
commercial interest rates would be imple- 
mented through the unit banking system. 
After an initial period, the loan programme 
would be financed by locally mobilized sav- 
ings. Commercial microfinance in the unit

A MASSIVE GAP BETWEEN 
SUPPLY AND DEMAND 
Despite widespread demand, it is estimated that institu- 
tional finance is unavailable to over 80 per cent of all house- 
holds in developing countries. This, of course, includes 
the vast majority of the poor people in the developing werld. 
The massive gap between supply and demand occurs for two 
primary reasons. Those who hold the power do not see the 
ubiquitous microfinance demand; those who see the demand 
do not hold the power. 
In the former case, local demand for microfinance is 
either invisible to its potential institutional suppliers, or the 
latter believe that it would be unprofitable for them to meet 
banks began in 1984 in the rural areas. In 1989 
the unit banking system was extended to 
urban areas as well. 
In January 1984 BRI began its new pro- 
gramme of general rural credit, called 
KUPEDES!, offered throughout its unit 
banking network, and by 1986 a new set of 
savings instruments had been introduced pro- 
viding, for the first time at local level, the much- 
in-demand combination of security, conve- 
nience, confidentiality, liquidity, and returns. 
These instruments, along with the KUPEDES 
credit programme, were offered in BRI’s unit 
banks throughout the country. The spread 
between loan and deposit interest rates was set 
to cover all costs and to return a profit. 
Since 1984, BRI’s unit banking system has 
performed spectacularly. As of the end of 1995, 
it held deposits of about $2.7 billion in about 
14.5 million deposit accounts, and there was 
about $1.4 billion in KUPEDES credit out- 
standing to about 2.3 million borrowers. The 
KUPEDES long-term loss ratio was 2.3 per 
cent. In 1995 return on assets for the unit 
banking system was 6.5 per cent. Unit bank 
deposits, a highly stable source of funds, 
finance all KUPEDES loans. 
A 1996 report by the World Bank states 
clearly the reasons for the success of BRI’ 
unit banks: 
“The programme succeeded because the 
banks loaned at market rates, used income to 
finance their operations, kept operating costs 
low and devised appropriate savings instru- 
ments to attract depositors. By mobilizing 
rural savings, [the unit banking system] was » 
this demand. Misunderstandings about local financial mar- 
kets are widespread on the part of many governments, finan- 
cial institutions and donor agencies. It is generally 
assumed—wrongly—both thatthe cost of delivering finan- 
cial services at the local level is too high for non-subsi- 
dized institutions, and that the informal market satisfies 
demand. 
Since there is little incentive to meet an unrecognized 
demand, or one that is considered unprofitable, the level of 
institutional commercial microfinance globally has remained 
very low. M.R.

not only provided with a stable source of 
funds, it also kept financial savings in rural 
arcas, thus helping development growth in 
the countryside. Other reasons for success 
included: the simplicity of loan designs, which 
enabled the banks to keep costs down, effec- 
tive management at the unit level, backed by 
close supervision and monitoring by the cen- 
tre; and appropriate staff training and perfor- 
mance incentives. ”2 
There are three main reasons why BRI’s 
experience is important. 
First, it has shown that the high cost of 
small loans can be substantially reduced and 
that financial institutions can profitably pro- 
vide microcredit to large numbers of bor- 
rowers, delivered locally with low client trans- 
action costs, at much lower interest rates than 
those normally paid by lower-income bor- 
rowers for informal commercial credit. 
Informal commercial lenders in many 
developing countries typically charge lower- 
income borrowers a “flat” monthly interest 
CREDIT IS NOT 
A PANACEA 
Poverty alleviation requires a toolbox. Credit is a powerful 
tool, but it cannot be the only one. It is used effectively 
when it is made widely available to the working poor. 
Among the poor, the hungry, the destitute, theaged and the 
ill, those who live in regions severely deprived of resources, 
and those escaping from natural or man-made catastro- 
phes have prior needs: food, medicine, shelter, employment.

per cent on the original loan balance. Money- 
lenders may offer lower rates to better-off and 
more influential borrowers, but in general the 
higher rates are charged to the poorer bor- 
rowers who have the fewest alternatives. In 
contrast BRI’s local banking system offers a 
flat monthly interest rate thatis at or below 1.5 
per cent on the original balance of the loan. 
No additional fees are charged to borrowers 
who pay on time. 
A self-sufficient institution providing 
microfinance must, of course, charge higher 
interest on loans than those charged in the 
same country by large urban banks provid- 
ing commercial and corporate loans. This is 
necessary because it is much more expensive 
to deliver financial services locally to many 
customers in thousands of locations than itis 
to deliver these services to relatively few clients 
with much larger loans and deposit accounts 
in large urban branches. However, sustainable 
microfinance institutions provide loans at far 
lower interest rates than lower-income bor- 
rowers can normally receive otherwise. 
Secondly, BRI has made credit widely avail- 
able. Various institutions in developing coun- 
tries supply credit at the local level in the form 
of subsidized loans, but since subsidies are 
capital constrained by government or donor 
budgets, this form of credit can meet only a 
small fraction of demand. Being cheap and 
desirable, it tends to reach local elites, not the

poor. From the borrower’s point of view, the 
key words in microcredit arc access and cost. 
Subsidized loan programmes do not provide 
wide access, and while moneylenders provide 
access it is generally at a cost that precludes 
microenterprise growth. 
The third lesson to be learned from BRI’ 
experience 1s that voluntary savings promote 
institutional viability. Institutions that pro- 
vide microcredit on a commercial basis have 
an incentive to make arrangements that are 
appropriate for small saver demand. These 
institutions can mect a high demand for sav- 
ings services. They set a spread between loan 
and deposit interest rates that is adequate to 
cover all costs, including the non-subsidized 
cost of funds, and to enable institutional prof- 
itability and growth in equity. Such institu- 
tions can become fully self-sufficient. There is 
much evidence to show that they can mobilize 
massive local savings, in amounts that are small 
on average, but large and stable in aggregate. 
The necessary-—although not sufficient— 
conditions are an enabling macro-cconomic 
environment, a reasonable level of political 
stability, an appropriate legal and regulatory 
framework, an adequate degree of monetiza- 
tion and infrastructure development, and suit- 
able demographic conditions. Given these con- 
ditions, institutional microfinance can achieve 
both profitability and wide coverage. 
The new institutional commercial micro- 
finance challenges the widespread assumption

that on-going subsidies are required for micro- 
finance in developing countries. The institu- 
tions that on-lend donor funds at subsidized 
interest rates, that combine social and financial 
services and that do not mobilize voluntary 
savings effectively have not (and cannot) 
become self-sufficient. Some are highly effec- 
tive at providing credit to large numbers of 
poor people and in recovering loans. How- 
ever, institutions of this type have been depen- 
dent on large amounts of continuing donor or 
government injections of low-cost funds. The 
demand for institutional microfinance is too 
large for this approach ona global scale. MW

Pedennan, or general rural credit. Editor

‘THE BANK IS A SERVANT, 
NOTA KING’ 
The relationship between microfinance and social and eco- 
nomic development is best understood—and best 
expressed—by the clients of commercial microfinance insti- 
tutions. The comments below were made to the author by 
microfinance clients of two banks. 
Savings services are the subject of many comments by 
clients. As this comment by a BRI client living in rural 
Java, shows: : 
“Before, we did not have so many employment oppor- 
tunities. We kept our savings in animals or gold, and we kept 
cash in the house. Now, except for a small amount, we do 
not like to keep money and gold in the house. Because we 
are working, there is not always someone at home, There is 
a security problem, and we cannot sleep peacefully at night 
if we keep money and gold in the house. We can keep sav- 
ings in up to eight goats. After that there is too much 
work to care for the goats, and the shepherds are all in 
school. But we have more savings than eight goats. We 
could buy a cow, which is less work than eight goats. But 
we cannot cut off the ear of the cow when we have to pay 
the school fees. We prefer to put our savings in banks,” 
One long-term client of Indonesia’s oldest microfi- 
nance bank, the Bank Dagang Bali, said: 
“I grew up poor and without education. I learned, 
though, that I could improve myself, and that the bank 
would help me. The president of Bank Dagang Bali is a 
great man. Why do I say that? Not because he is a bank 
president; there are many bank presidents. Because he knew 
that poor people fear banks, and he taught us not to be 
afraid. BDB taught us something important that we never 
knew before. BDB taught us that the bankis nota king. It 
is a servant.” M.R IR

Solidarity groups 
Banco Solidario, S.A., or Bancosol, grew out 
of a non-profit joint venture created in 1986 
by prominent members of the Bolivian busi- 
ness community and ACCION International. 
The latter brought with them leadership and 
seed capital, while the former provided tech- 
nology and methodology. PRODEM, as the 
programme was named, provided credit and 
training to broaden employment opportuni- 
ties for the very poor self-employed, encour- 
age investment in microbusinesses, and increase 
the income gencrated by this sector. PRODEM 
used the group lending technique of “solidar- 
ity groups” and began making small working 
capital loans. 
In its first five years of operation, PRO- 
DEM financed loans to over 13,300 microen- 
trepreneurs, 77 per cent of whom were 
women, disbursing over $27 million in loans 
averaging $273. The default rate remained close 
to zero during this time. In five years, PRO- 
DEM was unable to recover only about $2,000 
of the $27 million it lent. 
Many factors contributed to PRODEM’s 
success. The most important were the orga- 
nization’s commitment to total quality, 
including 100 per cent repayment; investment 
in training employees; and a powerful man- 
agement information system. By the end of 
1991, PRODEM had a portfolio of $4 million

and realized that despite its success, it was only 
reaching a small percentage of the market that 
needed its services. 
The enormous demand, coupled with 
PRODEM’s desire to provide savings services 
to its borrowers and to access capital markets 
for funds, moved PRODEM’s leadership 
towards the transformation of this non-profit 
institution into a fully chartered private com- 
mercial bank specializing in microfinance— 
the first in the world. 
The transition required two years” work

law before it would charter a bank; designing 
the bank’s financial structure, as well as its 
projection for profitability; training staff; 
and meeting the requirements of the Bolivian 
Superintendency of Banks. 
BancoSol opened its doors in 1992. PRO- 
DEM transferred to BancoSol its $4 million 
portfolio in exchange for shares, making PRO- 
DEM the largest shareholder of this newly 
formed bank. Other sharcholders included 
ACCION, Calmeadow from Canada, which 
had been very instrumental in the formation 
of the bank, Fundes from Switzerland and 
ICC, the Inter-American Development Bank’s 
private arm. 
Small is profitable 
After four years of operation, BancoSol is 
currently serving nearly 70,000 clients through 
twenty-nine offices. This clientele constitutes 
about 40 per cent of all the banking clients in 
the Bolivian banking system. It is interesting 
that while BancoSol’s loan loss remains very 
low and in 1994 it registered the highest return 
on asscts in the Bolivian banking system, its 
clients—very low income people of indige- 
nous background, mostly women requiring 
very small loans—are not considered bank- 
able clients by other banks. Currently, Ban- 
coSol lends approximately $80 million a year, 
in short-term loans averaging below $600. Ban- 
coSol’s outstanding portfolio is some $35 mil- 
lion, about one fourth of which is funded 
through savings deposits. Its plans are to con- 
tinue expanding its coverage in Bolivia, to 
increase its mobilization of savings, and to 
maintain itself as a profitable bank that ser- 
vices a population that has never had access to 
financial services. 
BancoSol’s success is helping reshape 
Bolivia’s financial systein. In 1994 the Super- 
intendency of Banks created a new type of 
regulated financial institution to enable other 
financially strong non-profit organizations 
to become regulated and thereby expand the 
availability of financial services to this sector. 
Institutions in other countries are also learn- 
ing from the experience of BancoSol and adapt- 
ing it to their own settings. K-Rep in Kenya, 
Accion Comunitaria del Peru, and Genesis in 
Guatemala, for example, are following Ban- 
coSol’s lead and in the next two years plan to 
become regulated financial institutions spe- 
cialized in microfinance. ||

largest microfinance institutions 
(MFIs) in Africa. Since it was 
founded in 1984, it has made available over 
50,000 loans worth $17 million and is now 
financially sustainable. It is currently trans- 
forming itself into a regulated financial insti- 
tution, just as MFIs in other African countries 
are doing in order to tap their financial markets 
for funds, and thus minimize or eliminate 
dependency on donors, 
A new strategy 
At first microfinance in Africa was usually 
handled by institutions that ran social wel- 
fare projects, and little attention was paid to 
promoting financial sustainability. The pro- 
jects did not reach large numbers of people 
and were criticized for not being cost effec- 
tive. There was no clear strategy. 
  
Next, many African MFIs looked to the 
experience of other continents, notably Asia 
and Latin America. There was a major change 
of method, whereby training and technical 
assistance were hived off from the delivery of 
financial services. This “financial systems 
approach” 1s now widely followed by MFIs in 
Africa, including K-Rep. 
In its early years K-Rep supported credit 
programmes that were tacked on to social wel- 
fare programmes, providing them with grants, 
training and technical assistance. Over time it 
became clear that welfare and relief institu- 
tions found it difficult to adapt to the finan- 
cial systems approach and that the mix of 
credit delivery and training of entrepreneurs 
was having a limited impact. 
K-Rep therefore adopted a new strategy 
in 1989, notably by changing the form of its 
financial support from grants to loans. Finally 
it started its own direct lending scheme,

Abundant choice 
When it decided to establish a bank, K-Rep 
considered the question of whether or not to 
continue with its other development activi- 
tics, and whether these goals could be achieved 
by a bank. Its response was to go on with 
these activities because it believes that micro- 
finances nota panacea to development prob- 
lems. Microenterprise development, for cxam- 
ple, has limitations in terms of reaching the 
poorest of the poor. To remain relevant to the 
constituency of the poorest, itis necessary to 
develop new instruments and products. A 
microfinance bank can provide many of these 
services, such as loans for domestic, health and 
education purposes, but it cannot provide 
other services such as affordable housing mort-

gages and health insurance. K-Rep thus does 
not intend to become a conventional bank 
but to use the banking framework to fill an 
important gap that commercial banks have 
been unable or unwilling to fill. 
The choices made by K-Rep take their place 
within the wide diversity of approaches and 
systems being developed by MFIs in Africa 
today. Apart from solidarity groups and credit 
unions, many rotating savings and credit asso-

For as long as anyone can remember, the

Six years ago, most of the women worked 
for a man—let’s call him Don Alejandro— 
who purchased the pottery the women made, 
and resold them to a wholesaler who trucked 
them to retail markets in Tegucigalpa. The 
women of Siguatepeque were poor, and dis- 
organized. Most of them sold the picces as 
fast as they made them, for a fraction of what 
Don Alejandro and the retailers earned on 
them. They had no choice: they needed the 
money to buy their daily food.

### 104989: Village banking: a report from 5 countries

In 1990, when I was looking for a suitable 
place for the first village bank to be organized 
by the Foundation for International Com- 
munity Assistance (FINCA) in Honduras, a 
friend of mine suggested I go to Siguatepeque. 
The organizational meeting took place with 
about thirty women, in Don Alejandro’s 
house. Our host was quite chagrined when, 
halfway through the meeting, I explained that 
the bank was for women only. Still, Don Ale- 
jandro was a good sport, and supported the 
idea that FINCA would make $50 loans to 
the assembled women to invest however they 
felt best, and that, four months later, they 
would repay the loan with interest of 3 per 
cent per month. Another condition of the 
loan, I explained, was that they would save at 
least 20 per cent of it, or $10. 
I kept waiting for some of the women to 
drift away, or to be scared off by the interest 
or the savings requirement, but they all 
remained, nodding solemnly, as if they under- 
stood and were in complete agreement. I didn’t 
tell them it was only the second time I had 
organized a village bank. But as I was to learn 
from this and subsequent organizing meect- 
ings, they all go this way. It was as if the 
women already knew how the system worked. 
It was that simple. 
In those days, FINCA had few resources, 
and I was unable to return to Siguatepeque to 
conduct the follow-up meetings with the 
women. Fortunately, the village banking man- 
ual I had left behind with the women fell into 
the hands of an enterprising Peace Corps vol- 
unteer, and one month after I had left I received 
a letter from the women of Siguatepeque which 
read: “Dear Mr. Scofield: Carolina, the volun- 
teer, has helped us organize our village bank, 
which we have named “Pinos del Porvenir” 
(“Pines of the Future”). We have had our four 
mectings, and we all understand how the bank 
works. Please send us a check for $1,500.” 
It was almost four months before I could 
return to Siguatepeque. I watched as the Pres- 
ident, Graciela, ran the meeting. The first thing 
I noticed was the palpable change in attitude. 
In sharp contrast to my first meeting with 
the women, today they were all smiles. Check- 
ing the books, I saw that all the loans were 
current, and that the group had savings of 
almost $1,000, after only three months. 
I asked the women what they had done with 
the loans. “I spent it on food for my family,” 
woman after woman said. I was appalled. “But 
how can you be paying off the loans?” Graciela 
explained to me that the FINCA loans had 
enabled them to purchase a month’s supply of 
food, which had taken the pressure off them to 
sell their ceramics as fast as they produced them. 
Instead, they produced a month’s stock, with- 
holding it from Don Alejandro and the other 
middlemen until the price was more favourable. 
The village bank loans had given them power in 
the marketplace. 
  
A other satisfied customer! 
A lender receives a loan at a 
village bank in Uganda. 
 
Today, “Pinos del Porvenir” is independent 
of FINCA, and has several thousands of dol- 
lars in savings, which capitalize the bank’s loans 
to its members. The women no longer sell to 
middlemen, but have their own retail store. 
FINCA Honduras, meanwhile, has grown 
from a shoestring operation to a financially 
self-sufficient lending institution servicing 
13,000 low-income borrowers in several regions 
of the country. The experience of the women of 
Siguatepeque has been repeated many times. 
Some of the village banks in Siguatepeque, in 
fact, went on to “graduate” and become clients 
of the local commercial bank. 
FINCA has derived a number of lessons 
from the Siguatepeque experience. Most impor- 
tant, perhaps, is the fact that a mere $50 loan can 
catalyze a process of individual and commu- 
nity development, which appears to be self- 
sustaining. Second, is the idea that the bor- 
rowers, in possession of far more information 
regarding local conditions than we outside 
“experts”, are better prepared to determine how 
to invest that loan. Finally, thereis the evidence 
that village banking can create a three-tiered self- 
sufficiency: at the borrower, community, and 
even national levels. If this kind of result can be 
replicated on a massive, worldwide scale, then 
rescuing many of the over one billion people 
living in poverty today may not be as daunting 
a challenge as we imagined. 
PERU 
The village bank “Union y Progreso” (“Union 
and Progress”) is located in a crime-ridden 
shanty town on the southern border of Lima 
(Peru). Like many other “pueblos jovenes” 
(“young towns”) surrounding the Peruvian 
capital, this one was established by squatters 
fleeing the violence of the “Shining Path” Guer- 
rillas, and the impossibility of scratching out

» aliving from agriculture on the rapidly eroding, 
parched soils of the Andean highlands. From 
the outside, the village bank President’s house 
bears little resemblance to a bank. The walls are 
a conglomeration of scavenged lumber, card- 
board, and corrugated metal, and the roof is a 
patchwork of the same, weighted by stones to 
prevent the strong winds from blowing them 
away. As a deterrent to houscbreakers, the top 
of the wall is crested with an intimidating glaze 
of broken glass, barbed wire and nails. 
Inside, the eighteen members of “Union 
and Progress” are holding their meeting. The 
Treasurer and President are giving the financial 
report, with the aid of two large sheets of 
paper, upon which the bank’s “vital signs” 
have been recorded with a pink magic marker. 
After two years, the eighteen members of 
“Union and Progress” have saved a total 
$12,322, or almost $700 apiece. An examination 
of the bank’s records reveals that, through 
active relending of their savings, the members 
have gencrated an additional $55,278 in loans 
over the past four months. This dwarfs the 
mere $7,200 which FINCA Peru has lent to 
the group. The interest income from these 
“internal account” loans is $1,100. 
Other income has been generated from fines 
on borrowers whose payments were made late. 
A late payment on either an internal account 
loan or external account carries a fine of 10 soles 
(about $4.50). This goes into a pot shared by 
only those who had perfect payment records. 
The women of “Union and Progress” came up 
with this carrot-stick system themselves. It 
strikes me as ingenious. An institutional 
approach would be to focus exclusively on the 
punitive side, the fines. I intend to see that this

idea gets disseminated to the other 3,000 village 
banks in the FINCA network. Most of the 
good ideas incorporated into village banking 
methodology have arisen in this way, from the 
borrowers themselves. The concept of the 
“internal account” —the relending of the bor- 
rowers’ savings, among themselves and to the 
community at large—came from a village bank 
in the border town of Sasabe, Mexico. 
Now it 1s the turn of the borrowers, to 
ask questions or to make comments. I listen to 
the testimony of Maria Ponte, aged sixty-five, 
who is leaving the bank, returning to the 
mountain town of Puno to live with her son. 
She thanks FINCA Peru for bringing the vil- 
lage bank to their community, and the mem- 
bers for trusting and supporting her. “I used 
to be thin as a stick. Now, thanks to FINCA, 
I have meat on my bones (she holds up her 
biceps and squeezes her flesh). I can afford to 
take vitamins. I have $683 in savings. [used to

save and borrow.”

With an average savings rate of $281.57 per

ratio in the FINCA network. In all, FINCA’s 
68,000 borrowers have saved $3.6 million over 
the past ten years, up 80 per cent from just 
two years ago. This money has not been fun- 
neled off to commercial banks in the capital, 
or sent offshore to Miami or Switzerland. It 
remains in the poorest communities of the 
world, working to create jobs and income on 
the bottom floor of the economy. Clearly, 
microenterprise has great potential for what 
my economics professor used to call “capital 
formation: the engine of development.” 
EL SALVADOR 
In 1991, Maribel Escobar Avalos’ situation 
seemed desperate. Having witnessed the destruc- 
tion of her firsthome in an earthquake in 1985, 
and her second in a guerrilla offensive in 1989, 
she had few possessions other than the clothes 
on her back. At the same time, she was sup- 
porting a family of nine, including an unem- 
ployed male companion, her seventy-three- 
year-old father, an invalid brother, two 
daughters, a son, a son-in-law, and a niece. But 
Maribel had learned from her mother in the 
markets of El Salvador how to sell. In a bold 
gamble, she sold what little she had left to make 
the down payment on a corner house lot in 
the western El Salvador town of El Sunsa. 
The first year in El Sunsa was one of sacri- 
fice and struggle. Totally decapitalized, the Esco- 
bar family spent the year in a makeshift shack 
of cardboard, with palm fronds for a roof. 
Their food budget was so small that often their 
only nutrition came from a concoction Mari- 
bel calls sopa de monte (“weed soup”). 
It was in these conditions that Maribel dis- 

## [Page 35](105001engo.pdf#page=35) 0

### 104989: Village banking: a report from 5 countries

covered the FINCA Micro-Enterprise Sup- 
port Center. The MSC made Maribel the first 
loan of her life, $50, which she invested in the 
purchase and sale of used clothing. Over the 
next two years, through her skill in selling, 
and access to ever-larger loans, Maribel began 
to diversify. First she established a small gro- 
cery store. Then a restaurant. Finally, she began 
to supply fruitand vegetables to other traders 
in El Sunsa. Eventually, these activities pro- 
vided employment for the entire family. Along 
the way, Maribel accumulated $805 in cash sav- 
ings in her village bank. Today, on the corner 
lot which used to host a ramshackle choza of 
cardboard and palm fronds, a comfortable 
four bedroom brick house stands. The store 
front room houses the store and restaurant, 
with an electrified “Orange Crush” sign fea- 
turing the name “Restaurante y Pupuseria El 
Canalito.” 
As she sends her children off to high school 
(she herself never progressed beyond third 
grade), Maribel explains her formula for suc- 
cess. “My whole life, I've worked hard, getting 
up at 5 a.m. and going to bed at 9 p.m. But 
the difference is, now we are saving. The more 
we save, the more we can borrow. The more we 
borrow, the more we can sell. The more we 
can sell, the greater our income.” 
UGANDA 
Prior to 1992, the women of Kimantu village 
in southeastern Uganda, near the sources of the 
Nile, had never managed their own money or 
run a business, let alone received credit. What 
little money did pass through their hands had 
to be begged from their husbands, even to 
buy food for their children. When I first 
described how the village bank would work, 
one of the women in the village asked me how 
much money FINCA would lend them. 
“Fifty thousand shillings,” I replied, which 
was the equivalent of $50. This was a tense 
moment for me: I had been assured by the 
Executive Director of another non-govern- 
mental organization working in Uganda that 
the women would turn up their noses at such 
a paltry sum. 
The woman gasped and nearly fainted. She 
assured me that 50,000 shillings was too much; 
she could never take responsibility for paying 
back such a princely sum. In the end, at the 
urging of her neighbours, she agreed to accept 
half that amount, splitting the loan with 
another woman in the bank. 
When I returned to Kimantu, four months 
later, I found the women, and the village, 
transformed. They had repaid their loans, 100 
per cent. They had saved in excess of the 
required 20 per cent. “The thing I like best 
about the village bank,” one woman told me, 
“is that L have learned to start a business and to 
manage money.” The woman who had been 
too timid to borrow 50,000 shillings now 
told me she intended to borrow 100,000. 
Toe treasurer of a village 
bank in Kyrgyzstan in central 
Asia records repayments. 
 
The men in the village, who had initially 
viewed the village bank with suspicion, now 
welcomed it. As the Kimantu village chief told 
me: “When the women first started to hold 
their meetings, we men were concerned. We 
thought they were talking about divorcing 
us. But then, when we saw them carning 
moncy, and they no longer came to us for 
money to buy salt, and pay school fees, we 
saw that the village bank was a good thing. 
But Mr. Scofield, [ have one question.” “And 
whatis that?” I asked. The chief grinned. “Can 
you create a village bank for us men?” 
In many communities of Uganda, Aids 
has left its brutal imprint, sweeping away hus- 
bands, wives, and sometimes entire families. In 
most cases, however, the children survive, to be 
raised by the village as a whole. Many Ugandan 
village bankers are supporting not only their 
own children, but those orphaned by deceased 
relatives and neighbours. It is an intensely sad, 
but at the same time inspiring experience to 
mect these selfless, struggling mothers. 
“Women who are in village banks are seen as the 
most responsible members of the commu- 
nity,” was the way one observer put it. “It is 
natural that people look to them, when they

KYRGYZSTAN 
Can microenterprise succeed in a country 
where, until recently, private enterprise was 
officially discouraged, considered immoral, 
and, in some cases, even outlawed? In 1994, 
FINCA established the first village banks in 
the newly independent state of Kyrgyzstan, 
Central Asia, in the capital city of Bishkek. 
With the snow-capped Himalayas as a back- 
drop, Bishkek is a city just coming to life, 
cconomically, after years of surviving on sub- 
sidies from mother Russia. Today, an esti- 
mated 15 per cent of the population is unem- 
ployed, and more expected as state-run 
enterprises are privatized or closed altogether. 
Increasingly, the population is moving to sclf- 
employment as an alternative to the meagre 
wages of the public sector. 
Today, the village bank Bercke (“Bless- 
ing”) is receiving its first loan. Village banks arc 
smaller in Kyrgyzstan than in other countries 
in the FINCA network, reflecting an added 
cautiousness on the part of the members 
towards their neighbours, the vast majority of 
whom have never operated a business. FINCA 
has learned to respect the members’ apprecia- 
tion of local conditions as being far superior 
to its own, and scldom intervenes in decisions 
regarding the sclection of the bank’s mem- 
bers, or in the loan approval process. In this 
case, most of the fiftcen borrowers will be 
investing their loans in consumer goods, to be 
sold in the local market. A great feast for the 
visitors was laid out on a gorgeous, hand- 
woven rug in the village bank president’s liv- 
ing room. Other rugs, of equally dazzling pat- 
terns, adorned the walls. These rugs, which 
sell domestically for less than $10, can com- 
mand over $100 in export markets. Though 
it was only mid morning, glasses of brandy 
were offered and accepted. 
The mecting began, presided over by a 
democratically elected President, Treasurer and 
Secretary. The President followed the standard 
village bank agenda: financial report, approval 
and disbursement of loans, and collection of 
obligatory and voluntary savings. Besides the 
small size of the village banks, the methodol- 
ogy has suffered little modification in its adap- 
tation to the Kyrgyz context. Contrary to 
initial warnings that no one would be inter- 
ested in small loans in Kyrgyzstan, FINCA has 
found the demand to be strong. To date, 
FINCA Kyrgyzstan has reached 2,300 bor- 
rowers, and, in a country of five million, the 
word is just beginning to spread. |

age-earning is the most wide- 
spread form of employment in 
the industrialized countries. 
However, in a context of eco- 
nomic crisis and high unemployment, the pro- 
portion of self-employed workers has risen 
steadily since the early 1980s. Microcredit is one 
tool of development for this sector. 
The Association for the Right to Eco- 
nomic Initiative (ADIE) was set up in France 
in 1990, and was supported from its incep- 
tion by a number of private foundations, the 
French state and the European Union. To date

ADIE has funded more than 2,500 micro- 
enterprises started by the unemployed and 
people receiving the minimum social wage 
(RMI). It has branches in fourteen French 
regions and works in tandem with authorized 
savings and loan banks such as Crédit Mutuel 
and Crédit Municipal. 
Nearly 40 per cent of ADIE’s customers

is an allowance paid by the French state to people over 
25 who have no other source of income.

state three times less than supporting them 
for a year while they are out of work. In France 
microcredit is used as a tool to help people on 
the fringe of society to help themselves. 
The dismantling of Albania’s co-operatives 
and state farms that began in 1992 has put 
farmers in charge of individual holdings aver- 
aging 1.4 hectares but with no farm imple- 
ments or input. 
As part of the Rural Poverty Alleviation 
Project financed by the World Bank and Aide 
International, village credit funds have been 
set up to inject resources into rural areas and 
rebuild village community life destroyed 
under communist rule. 
Managed by farmer-clected committees, 
these village funds grant loans and collect 
repayment instalments with support from 
the Albanian Rural Development Fund. To 
date they have granted 8,000 loans, the average 
amount of which has gradually risen from 
$200 to $400 with a 99.5 per cent repayment 
rate. 
This network so far covers only some 5 
per cent of Albanian villages but is expanding 
rapidly. A law was passed in April 1996 allow- 
ing credit funds to collect savings as well. The 
success of microcredit in rural areas has led the 
government to extend the programme to the 
towns, where loans average $2,000 and are 
granted on an individual basis. 
As well as providing finance, microcredit

A project in Tuzla 
The Republic of Bosnia and Hercegovina is 
facing the combined difficulties arising from 
a transition economy and a war-torn econ- 
omy. Unemployment among people of work- 
ing age is running at 64 per cent, and nearly 80 
per cent of the population lives on humani- 
tarian aid. 
To case the passage from humanitarian aid 
to economic activity the World Bank has 
launched a pilot project in Tuzla to support 
local initiatives. With support from the non- 
governmental organizations that endeavoured 
to help the civilian population during the war, 
the project is focused on displaced persons, 
demobilized soldiers, small farmers and the 
unemployed. 
Loans range from $300 to $600 depending 
on the projects and the borrowers’ capacities. 
In refugee centres the loans give single women 
with children a chance to rent plots of land 
to plant potatoes, buy a cow or goat, knit or 
embroider. In the villages, they usually fund 
crafts and businesses that supplement income 
from farming, which is inadequate. In cities, 
where the markets larger, they enable people 
to start or relaunch microenterprises by job 
creation. Microcredit is helping a country

### 104992: What is poverty?

What is poverty? 
Poverty is usually thought of as a lack of income— | 
because it is income that is largely assumed to 
determine a person’s material standard of well- 
being. Thus, if $1 a day is taken as the poverty line, 
33% of the developing world’s population, or 1.3 
billion people, are poor. Nearly half of them— 
more than 550 million—live in South Asia, 215 
million in sub-Saharan Africa and 150 million 
in Latin America. 
But “income poverty” is only part of the pic- 
ture. Just as human development encompasses 
aspects of life much broader than income, so 
poverty should be seen as having many dimen- 
sions. 
A new, multidimensional measure of human 
deprivation, the capability poverty measure 
(CPM), was introduced in the United Nations 
Development Programme’s Human Develop- 
ment Report 1996. Intended to complement 
income measures of poverty, it focuses on human 
capabilities, as UNDP’s human development 
index! docs. But rather than examining the aver- 
age state of people’s capabilities, it reflects the per- 
centage of people who lack basic, or minimally 
The CPM considers the lack of three basic 
capabilities. The first is the capability to be well 
nourished and healthy—represented by the pro- 
portion of children under five who are inder- 
weight. The second is the capability for healthy 
reproduction—proxied by the proportion of 
births unattended by trained health personnel. 
The third is the capability to be educated and 
knowledgeable—represented by female illiter- 
acy. The index is noteworthy for its emphasis on 
the deprivation of women, which is severe in 
some countries. [tis now well known that depri- 
vation of women adversely affects the human 
development of families and society. 
According to national income poverty lines, 
21% of the people in developing countries live 
below the poverty line. The corresponding figure 
for capability poverty is 37%. In other words, 900 
million people in developing countries are income 
poor, but 1.6 billion people are capability poor. l 
I Since 1990 the I{uman Development Report has 
presented the human development index to capture as 
many aspects of human development as possible in one 
simple composite index and to produce a ranking of 
essential, human capabilities. human development achievements.

of the few hundred million people who 
run micro and small enterprises have

to Assist the Poorest [CGAP)) 
« If 10% of all low income entrepre- 
ncurs are to gain access to institutional 
finance by the year 2005, financial sys- 
tems will need to be transformed. Finan- 
cial intermediaries’ total portfolios in 
microloans, now about $2.5 billion, 
would need to be about $12.5 billion by 
2005. These rapid increases in lending 
levels are reasonable and reflect growth 
rates that are lower than actual growth 
rates in the last five years. The main chal- 
lenges will be in expanding the capacity 
and resources of those retail intermedi- 
aries committed to providing financial 
services to low income catreprencurs.

Fashion for development 
While hand-loom weavers from Bangladesh demon- 
strated their skills, some fifty designs made from their fab- 
rics were modelled at a show held at UNEscO’s Paris 
HQ carly last year. The event, which formed part of co- 
operation between UNESCO and the Grameen Bank, 
showed how cultural wealth can be linked to social and 
cconomic development. 
“UNESCO is not planning to get into the fashion busi- 
ness,” said UNESCO’s Director General, Federico Mayor. 
“We only want to suggest how the crafts of the weavers of 
Bangladesh could find an outlet in international markets.” 
Many weavers in rural Bangladesh, where high-qual- 
ity textile production was once the mainstay of the econ- 
omy, have been forced to abandon their looms because 
of lack of working capital and raw materials, and com- 
petition from machine-made products. Grameen Bank 
is helping them to produce and promote their fabrics, 
thereby contributing to preservation of the cultural her- 
itage as well as preventing these skilled craftspeople from 
falling into poverty. 
The potential of microfinance to help the world’s 
poor can only be fulfilled if their products find outlets. In 
its strategy for the weavers’ survival Grameen is linking 
traditional handlooms with a product policy responsive 
to fashion trends and aimed at winning new markets 
both locally and internationally. 
The fashion show, at which one of the creations was 
designed by a Paris fashion house, demonstrated the 
linkages that can be established between local crafts and 
the international market. |

tion help to shape it? These questions raise two scts of 
issues. One has to do with the contribution that edarca- 
tion must make to society; the other relates to the expan- 
sion and reform of the education system itself so that it can 
meet the hopes and expectations that society has vested 
in it. 
While the challenges to education arc universal, the 
responses to them must come from the heart of the cul- 
tures of each region. Education must reflect all that is best 
and most distinctive within ourselves and our societies. 
Only thus will it help to unite people everywhere around 
shared values in defence of their common interests, 
Everywhere and from every standpoint, education is 
crucial to peace. For peace, as we all know, is more than 
the absence of conflict. Peaceis a culture based upon tol- 
erance and respect for others; it is a spirit of active soli- 
darity among individuals, built npon expectations of jus- 
tice and tranquillity. Sustaining and promoting these 
values must be one of the foremost duties of ednecation.

peace and the folly of war,

Iegend mongooses use to feed on the

root is still administered as an anti- 
dote to snakebite. Its use gradually 
spread to the neighbouring provinces 
and then to the whole country. In 
Bihar provinee, for example, it has 
been nsed to treat insanity, epilepsy

disciplinary science is mainly prac- 
tisedin developing countries and with 
indigenous populations because in 
that context the link between pro- 
duction and consumption is far more 
direct than itis in the industrialized 
world. An Amazonian Indian will go 
out and pick the leaf he needs to 
treat a burn, whereas in developed 
countries not many people know that 
the pretty foxglove (Digitalis pur- 
purea) erowing in the garden is the 
basis of the medicine they take for 
their heart condition, 
Some of the reasons for today’s 
growing interest in ethnobotany are 
psychological (a revival of interest 
in natnre and “natural” products, a 
sense of urgency that has arisen 
because the knowledge and tradi- 
tions of indigenous peoples are dying 
out), while others are more prag- 
matic (people in the poorest coun- 
tries often cannot get Irold of—and 
above all cannot afford—modern 
drugs). 
The World Health Organization 
(WIIO) is trying to restore respect 
for traditional medicine, and many 
other international organizations and 
non-governmental organizations have 
followed suit, In 1992 the World

As part of the programme, on-the-

Learning from shamans 
An ethnobotanist working in the field 
must have received a rigorons seien- 
tific training, He or she also needs 
to be physically tough, adaptable 
and a good listener. In his hook Tales 
of a Shaman’s Apprentice, Ameri- 
can cthnobotanist Mark J, Plotkin, 
who spent more than ten years in 
Amazonia, describes how he learned 
the local langnage, followed the 
shamans, collected samples, made 
a herbarium and noted the uses that 
were made of plants. lle analysed 
medicines, the vegetal poison onthe 
tips of arrows and the hallucinogenic 
substances used during initiation 
ceremonies, 
He recorded the words of an old 
Amazonian shaman who said: “It is 
true the youngsters do not want to 
learn. One day the medicines that 
the missionaries send from the city 
will no longer arrive. The people here 
will come to me to relieve their pains, 
to couquer the evil spirits that kill 
their children. Bnt } will be cone, 
and Iwill have taken my plants with 
me.” Unlike doctors, 
shamans, medicine men and 
fetishists treat the mind and the 
body. They also help to maintain the 
group’s enltural identity. 
Shamans cannot practise their 
skills without preparation. They 
must be initiated, often using hal- 
hicinogenic substances like 
ayahuasca (Banisteriopsis caapi),

surprising that missionaries try to 
eradicate these practices and beliefs 
and discourage shamans from tak-

understand why Mark Plotkin has

and a plethora of medicinal plants all 
appear at early stages of human pre-

that plants are victims of deforesta- 
tion, soil erosion, pollution, herbi- 
cides, urban expansion and even over- 
harvesting. The United Nations 
Food and Agriculture Organization 
defines biodiversity as “the diversity 
of life on earth: it includes all life 
forms and the ecosystems of which 
they are a part”. Its reduction 
results in the loss of irreplaceable 
genetic materials that are the essen- 
tial components of the plant and ani- 
mal life that agriculture and other 
human activities depend on. 
The poor countries and their tra- 
ditional pharmacopeia face another 
threat, however. Pharmaceutical 
and other laboratories that use the 
observations of cthnobotanists are 
taking partin a “plant rush” to take 
samples from nature, then large 
quantities of primary plant matter in 
order to produee drugs and cosmet-

A patent problem 
This is a tree that grows especially 
well in the cool, volcanic soil of 
Africa’s mountainous regions. [tis a 
wild-growing cousin of the peach, 
apricot and almond trees and is 
found in Kenya, Uganda and Zaire, 
and also in Madagascar and the 
Comoros Islands. It is especially 
abundant in the southwest and 
northwest regions of Cameroon, Its 
barkis known in mnch of Africa as a 
treatment for malaria, stomach ache 
and fever. In 1966, a French laho- 
ratory discovered that itis an active 
agent in the treatment of prostate 
swelling, and applied for a patent, 
followed by three other European 
laboratories. In a single place 424 
tonnes of bark were gathered from 
7,717 Prunus trees between Decem- 
ber 198% and December 1985. 
Unfortunately, instead of simply tak- 
ing bands of bark, harvesters often 
strip the trce bare so that it dies, 
thus depriving traditional medicine 
of onc of its resources. 
In this way the increased life 
expectancy of western Europeans 
has an impact on the Cameroonian 
forest, since one European male out 
of two over the age of 80 has a nine 
out of ten chance of suffering from 
this prostate affliction. 
It is increasingly imperative to 
adopt an ethical approach to 
exploitation of the resources of 
developing countries, and this is one 
of the goals of the People and Plants 
Programme. An ethical code is 
urgently needed. Greedy for new 
products, the pharmaceutical com- 
panies “buy” or “borrow” plant 
species and file patents on them. The 
neem (Azirdirachta indica), a tree 
used for as long as anyone can 
remember as a pesticide in India, 
has been patented by an American 
company. Stranger still, a vine grow- 
ing in the Amazonian jungle, known 
to shamans for its hallucinogenic 
qualities and used in initiation cer- 
entonies, has been patented by an 
American and marketed via the 
Internet. 
But who can stop a villager from 
“selling” a plant from his garden or 
a traveller from quietly pocketing 
it? Who can prevent a laboratory 
from borrowing a specimen from a 
botanical garden? If and when an 
ethical code is promulgated, ways 
of implementing it will still have to 
be found. || 
EXPLORING THE EARTH 
WITH EARTHWATCH 
  
Russian geochemist Igor Taganov once led a 3-man Earthwatch expedition in Siberia that 
became more than just a scientific outing. Ile tells how their food supply was destroyed by a hun- 
gry bear when they still had 300 kilometres to cover on their return journey to home hase. Two 
days later their dogs discovered a huge picce of meat, the flesh of a young mammoth that had 
Leen perfectly preserved in a block of ice. During the next two weeks they cooked and ate alot 
of the meat, and later sent some samples of it to Moscow for laboratory tests. Carbon-14 analy- 
sis revealed that the steaks they'd been cating were 30,000 years old! 
This unusual episode happened on a serious scientific expedition organized by Earthwatch, 
anon-profit membership organization that was founded in the U.S.A. in 1972 and is one of the 
world’s largest private sponsors of scientific field research projects. Earthwatch offers amateurs 
the opportunity to take partin projects and expeditions all over the workl and thus contribute 
to scientific progress. It brings a touch of adventure to observation of the planet in such fields 
as agriculture, archaeology, the arts, botany, cultural anthropology, ecology, geology, palaeon- 
tology, voleanology and zoology. 
Every year Earthicatch publishes a roundup of its teams’ accomplishments. In 1996 for 
example, four new species of snakes, two species of lizards and a frog unknown to science were 
discovered on the islands off 1long Kong; the Wardaman aborigines of Australia were helped to 
record and preserve more than 14,000 paintings and petroglyphs made by their Ancestors; and 
Costa Rican sea turtles were tagged with satellite transmitters making it possible to keep tabs 
on their migrations and protect them. 
To date Earthwatch has mobilized 1,882 projects in 111 countries. More than 40,000 of its 
EarthCorps volunteers have contributed over $30 million and 5,230,000 hours to the search for 
solutions to important problems. It already has 70,000 members from all walks of life, and 
anyone can join, |

WHERE HAVE ALL 
THE FLOWERS GONE? 
Fewer and fewer of the poppies, cornllowers and other wild 
plants that once dotted the grain fields of Western Europe 
are to be seen these days. They are being destroyed by selee- 
tive herbicides, and some of them are even threatened with 
extinction. Generally hardier than cultivated plants, they com- 
pete with cereal crops for water, fertilizer, air and light. Some 
of them have extraordinary root systems. The roots of a single 
wild oat plant can measure almost 6,000 metres when put end 
to end, In many ways these wild plants are very useful. The pres- 
ence of small concentrations of certain substances given off 
by cornllower roots (Centaurea cyanus) helps flax to grow, 
and poppies can have the same effect on wheat. | 
THE CAR FREE CITIES NETWORK 
In Amsterdam in 1994 the European Union created a “Car Free 
Cities Club”, which has today become a 60-member Car Free 
Cities Network, The aim is not for eities to outlaw private cars 
hut rather to propose alternative solutions and develop elfi- 
cient urban transport systems. In Copenhagen (Denmark), for 
example, there are 125 coin-operated “eycle points” where 
people can hire bikes. Since 1970 the closing of many Copen- 
hagen streets to motor traffic and a reduction in the number of 
parking places (1 to 3% per year} have brought down the num- 
ber of kilometres covered by private cars by 10%. Tt has to be 
said that Copenhagen is an exceptional case in Lurope, HM

A NATURAL FERTILIZER 
FOR RICE 
Rice feeds nearly half of the people who 
live on planet earth. At the present pop- 
ulation growth rate, 300 million more 
tonnes of the cereal will have to he pro- 
duced to meet demand in the year 2020. 
This means using more fertilizer and pes- 
ticides, which arein the long ron harmful 
to the environment and soil productivity. 
For the past few years, the French Sei- 
entific Research Institute for Develop- 
ment through Co-operation (ORSTOM) 
and the International Rice Researeh Insti- 
tute (IRR) of the Philippines have heen 
studying the possibility of using micro- 
scopic algae known as cyanobacteria as a 
biological fertilizer in riceliclds. Cyanobac- 
teria ave naturally present in the soil of 
rice paddies and are able to fix from the air 
3 to 30 kg of nitrogen per hectare. When 
the algae decompose, the freed nitrogen 
is reabsorbed by the rice. Cyanobacteria 
thus act as natural fertilizer. Their other 
advantages are that they enrieh the soil 
with organic matter and prevent the pro- 
liferation of mosquito larvae, vectors of 
numerous diseases such as malaria. Hl 
BRIGHT IDEA 
A Greek household spends roughly 10% 
of its budget on electricity. In an attempt 
to help their compatriots save energy, sto- 
dents from Alimos igh School suggest 
that consumers should simply change 
light hnlbs. They write as follows in Bleu 
Blanc Vert, the magazine produced by 
the Young Reporters Programme of the 
Paris-based Foundation for Environmen- 
tal Education in Europe (FEEE): “If we 
exchange 1 100-watt incandescent lamp 
for one lluorescent lamp of equal Tight 
power (20W), we reduce emissions of Cl 0, 
by 650 kg for the whole “life” of the buh

THE PROMISE OF 
AGROFORESTRY 
Some 15.4 million hectares of the world’s 
2 billion hectares of tropical forests dis- 
appear annually, including 10 million to 
slash-and-lnmirn farming. Inorder to resist 
this trend, the Consultative Group on 
International Agricultural Research 
(CGIAR), an international consortium 
sponsored by the World Bank, FAO, the 
United Nations Development Programme 
and the UN Envirenment Programme, is 
supporting research into sustainable farm- 
ing practices. Agroforestry, one such 
method, consists of integrating trees into 
farmingin order to rednce the pressure on 
forests by providing farmers with timber 
ad fuelwood, as well as fruit, oils, resins, 
medicines and fodder. This would eon- 
tribute to the earnings of tural honseholds 
and inevease food security. [| 
CASTOR OIL TREATMENT FOR 
THE OZONE LAYER 
Poly-Urethane Industria e Comercio Ltda, 
a Brazilian company based in Belo Hori- 
zonte, has perfected a new technology 
that uses castor oil as the expanding agent 
in the manufacture of insulating foam, 
This original idea should lead to a notable 
reduetion in the use of Chloroflnorocar- 
hons (CFCs), gases that destroy the earth’s 
protective ozone shield, and also encour- 
age castor-oilproduetionin Brazil, where 
the plant from which itis made grows wild 
evenin the big cities. [|

### 104999: Colonia del Sacramento remembers its turbulent past

remembers its turbulent past 
by Edouard Bailby 
Colonial monuments with an eventful history grace the old 
quarter of the Uruguayan port of Colonia 
a peninsula at Uruguay’s southern- 
most tip, on the edge of the pam- 
pas, that Colonia del Sacramento 
was founded in 1680. This small 
town was spawned by rivalries 
between two colonial powers, Spain 
and Portugal, and its turbulent past 
is reflected in its unusual blend of 
two architectural styles. It was on 
those grounds that the site was put 
on UNESCO's World heritage List in 
December 1995. 
Present-day Colonia del Sacra- 
mento, which is visited by tens of 
thousands of tourists every year, is a 
_ sleepy town untouched by the hurly- 
burly of modern life. From its upper 
district, it is possible at night to see 
the twinkling lights of Buenos Aires, 
the town from which, in 1680, the 
fest Spanish expedition set out to 
take Colonia del Sacramento, then a 
Portuguese stronghold. 
A coveted prize 
For almost a century the Por- 
tuguese and Spanish fought for con- 
trol of the Rio de la Plata, which 
was of strategic importance. 1t was 
through that estuary, after a voy- 
age of several thousand kilometres 
along the Parand and Uruguay 
Rivers, that precious stones and 
hides from Bolivia, as well as pre- 
cious metals from Peru, passed on 
their way to Europe. It was through 
that same channel, but in the other 
direction, that the Spanish and Por- 
tuguese transported—and often 
smuggled—goods to the heart of 
the continent. 
It is generally agreed that the 
first Spanish navigator to have 
entered the Rio de la Plata was Juan 
Diaz de Solis in 1516. Later on, 
Spanish, English, French and Dutch 
privateers and pirates ventured into 
the estuary and unloaded cattle on 
to unknown land, hoping they would 
quickly proliferate and become a 
source of trade. But there were soon 
clashes with the Portuguese, who 
were seeking to extend their terri- 
tory to the south of Brazil. In 1680, 
the Prince Regent of Portugal, Don 
Pedro, ordered Colonia del Sacra- 
mento to be founded. 
But the Spanish were in no mood 
to accept that, and the same year 
the newly-founded town fell into 
their hands, despite the heroism of 
Joana Galvio: after the death of 
her husband, who had been given 
the task of defending the fortress, 
she took over command of his 
troops. Colonia del Sacramento

later changed hands several times as

Pedro de Vasconcelos. During that 
time (1722-1749), the town was 
graced with many fine examples of 
civilian and military architecture 
(the surviving examples of which 
can be admired today). It also 
reached its cultural and commer- 
cial zenith, and boasted twice as 
many inhabitants as Montevideo, 
which was founded by the Spanish 
in about 1726. 
‘Don’t let's tamper with the past’ 
Inthe carly 1960s a small group of 
Uruguayan history enthusiasts man- 
aged to persuade the government 
and the town council to come up 
with the financial and material 
resources needed to preserve Colo- 
nia’s old quarter. Some hiousc-own- 
ers agreed to sell their homes and 
restoration work started. 
In Janwary 1991, a team of 
archaeologists identified the pre- 
cise location of governor Vasconce- 
los’s palace. The discovery and sub- 
sequent work on the site resulted in 
Urnguay’s first laboratory of his- 
torical archaeology being set np in 
Montevideo. Nelsys Fusco Zambe-

plans for reconstruction. “Lets 
keep the old stones just as they 
are,” she says, “and don’t let’s tamn- 
per with the past, except to show it 
to good advantage.” 
The historic quarter, which is 
sandwiched between the remains of 
the ramparts and the modern city, 
covers the area of the former Por- 
tuguese town of Nova Colonia do 
Santissimo Sacramento. It contains 
almost 16 hectares of buildings in a 
great diversity of styles. Its layout 
is unusual. Unlike many other Span- 
ish and Portuguese colonial towns, 
which were built on a grid pattern, 
this stronghold was given a jigsaw- 
puzzle design, partly because of the 
site’s topography, and partly to act 
as a windbreak—the Rio de la Plata 
is subject to fieree gales. 
Plaza Mayor, which was adorned 
with fiveroyal pals and two eedars 
at the beginning of this century, 
gives on to the Rio dela Plata. With 
its public gardens and ovingly pre- 
served eighteenth-century man- 
sions, it has retained some of its 
erstwhile bucolic charm. No, 180, 
a modest building with thick stone 
walls, houses the Portuguese 
Mosenm. Its azulejos (enamelled 
tiles), furniture made of jacaranda 
(a precious South American wood), 
clothes and kitelien utensils stand 
as a reminder that Colonia del 
Saeramento long had conneetions 
with the Portuguese crown. A 
stone’s throw away, a small street 
called Calle de los Suspiros (Street 
of Sighs) runs gently down to the 
estuary. It has a central gutter that 
drains rainwater off its uneven coh- 
bles, and is lined with early eigh- 
teenthi-century peasant houses. Less 
centrally located ts the Spanish 
Museum, the home of exhibits and 
documents relating to the Spanish 
presence in the town, 
Probably the most interesting of 
Colonia’s seven museums is the 
Municipal Museum, once the resi- 
dence of the Irislt Admiral Willian 
Brown, who played a heroie role in 
Uruguay’s independence. 1t offers »

ereatest damage was caused in 1823 
when the sacristy, which was being 
used as an explosives depot, blew 
up. Despite restoration work, the 
building has since lost its original 
architectural unity. The nave does 
however contain some admirable 
works of art, including a sixteenth- 
century altar-piece, a seventeenth- 
century painting of the IToly Family

inal church that have survived are 
its pillars, which date from 1695.

### 105000: Isabelle Leymarie talks to David Sanchez

LISTENING 
ISABELLE LEYMARIE TALKS TO 
DAVID SANCHEZ 
Puerto Rico has a strong musical tradition dating back to the 
early colonial period. At the beginning of this century, the 
island had such a talented pool of instrumentalists that Afro- 
American band leader and jazz pioneer James Reese Europe 
recruited musicians for his wind section among them, in San 
Juan, the capital. 
Until the late 1960s Puerto Rican music was relatively 
unknown outside the island, but since then a new generation of 
musicians has emerged. The young saxophonist David Sanchez, 
one of the most expressive of present-day jazz composers and 
performers, is a star in this constellation which also includes 
drummer Giovanni Hidalgo and bass-player John Benitez, with 
whom he has often played. 
M Isabelle Leymarie: Black influence is 
very strong in popular Puerto Rican 
music—both traditional music and dance 
music like salsa. This comes out very 
clearly in your playing and your 
compositions. Bomba Blues on your last 
record, Sketches of Dreams, blended the 
blues with bomba, an Ashanti- and Bantu- 
inspired genre created in Puerto Rico. 
David Sanchez: In Puerto Rico, 90 per 
cent of the musie has black roots. P'm 
thinking of bomba, of course, but also 
the more hybrid plena, which is played 
with tambourines and appeared after 
the First World War, and danza, which 
is orchestrated for European instru- 
ments. Danza comes from old courtly 
dances like the minuet, and when it 
arrived in the Caribbean in the eigh- 
teenth century, it picked up African 
syncopation, These black roots are per-

vasive. Although we have our own 
indigenous rhythms, which are our 
hallmark, we’ve also left our mark on 
Cuban musie. Unfortunately, black 
music in Puerto Rico is often over- 
shadowed by black American music 
and is still far less widely played than 
it deserves. 
MW I L.: Were you brought up in a musical 
family? 
D.S.: 1 grew up in Guaynabo, near San 
Juan, in an atmosphere steeped in musie. 
Athome 1 heard local performers such 
as the drummer Rafael Cotijo, the singer 
Ismael Rivera and El Gran Combo, a 
famous band, all forerunners of Puerto 
Rican salsa. My father used to listen to 
the Mexican singer Tofia la Negra and 
Cuban musicians such as the Orquesta 
Aragon and the singer Vicentico Valdés. 
My sister, who was studying literature, 
introduced me to Brazilian and llaitian 
records and nueva trova, politically com- 
mitted Latin American songs of the late 
1960s. I'started playing on my brothers 
drum set and the eonga. 1 had a partic- 
ular liking for Cuban drummers such 
as Mongo Santamaria, Patato Valdés, 
Los Papines and El Niiio, and jazzier 
groups such as Irakere. 1 especially 
remember Misa Negra, a composition 
by their piano player, Chuclio Valdés. 
WM I L.: How did you move from “Latino” 
music to jazz? 
D.S.: Againit was my sister who taught 
me to appreciate jazz with records like 
Miles Davis's Basic Miles and Billie 
loliday’s Lady in Satin. When I was 
twelve 1 moved onto the tenor saxo- 
phone. 1 studied classical technique 
 
and then went on to the Escuela Libre 
de Musica in San Juan, where some of 
our best musicians have studied. Then 
I analysed the styles of the great jazz 
saxophonists: Ben Webster, John 
Coltrane, Dexter Gordon and Sonny 
Rollins, whom I particularly admire. 
HW I. L.: Although you're known as a jazz 
musician, you've never lost your affection 
for Latin rhythms. 
D.S.: Yes, Ilike playing what is known 
today as “Latin jazz”. It’s a hybrid style 
that came from the United States in the 
late 1940s with musicians like Dizzy 
Gillespie, Charlie Parker, Mario Bauza 
and Chano ’ozo, who realized that jazz 
and Afro-Latino music flowed from the 
same sources and that they could get 
along very nicely. Some crities occa- 
sionally ask the question whether jazz 
will last. I’m convinced that the future 
of jazz is in Latin jazz. At a time when 
jazz often returns to a certain kind of 
classicism, Latin jazz has created new 
forms of expression. Its popularity 
keeps growing, and we Latin Ameri- 
can jazzmen are in top form. 
HW I L.: There seem to be two musical 
trends in Latin America and the Caribbean 
right now: a return to roots and fusion 
between different musical genres. 
D.S.: The whole of Latin America, and 
Puerto Rico in particular, is multicul- 
tural, and has been from the start of its 
history. This is where we get our inspi- 
ration. This is what shapes our per- 
sonality. If more people understood 
the enrichment that comes from cohab- 
itation with other ethnic groups, there 
wouldn’t be so many conflicts!

BM I L.:The Cuban flautist Alberto 
Socarrds used to describe how, when he 
moved to Harlemin 1929, American 
musicians couldn't believe that someone 
with a Spanish accent could play their 
music as well as they did. Is it still hard for 
a Puerto Rican instrumentalist to be fully 
accepted in the American jazz world? 
D. S.: Sometimes there are tensions, but 
the joy of making music usually wins 
out over racial, language or cultnral 
differences. As in any art form, what 
counts first and foremost is an open 
heart. 
M I. L.: How do you compose your music?
