Mentally handicapped children have special needs but first and fore- 
most they are children and they share all the needs and emotions of 
childhood. In the past it was often felt that these children were in- 
capable of learning or of any form of independence, but it is now 
known that all children can learn if taught in the right way. The de- 
velopment of communieation skills plays an important role in help- 
ing disabled children to become as independent as possible and find 
a place as young adults in the community. Above, a mentally handi- 
capped child engrossed in learning to use the telephone.

Editorial Ii 
The International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking, 
organized by the United Nations and held in Vienna in June 1987, 
marked a new chapter in attempts by the world community to combat 
the problem of drugs. In recognition of the importance of the 
Conference, the articles which open this number of the Unesco Courier 
are devoted to different aspects of the drug question including the key 
role of the prevention of drug abuse through education, one of the 
activities which Unesco has been carrying out in this field for over 
fifteen years. 
Action on behalf of the disabled is another important field in which 
Unesco is co-operating in efforts to achieve goals set by the United 
Nations, in this case through the encouragement of educational 
activities to help the integration of disabled young people into schools 
and society at large. To draw attention to the importance of such action 
in fostering the personality development of disabled children and 
enabling them eventually to participate insocicty to the fullest extent, 
we publish a case study from Portugal which incorporates the testimony 
of two visually handicapped children who talk frankly about their lives. 
Alsoin thisissue, the nature of the writer’s responsibility in the 
preservation of peace is analysed in an article by the secretary of P.E.N, 
the international association of writers, who examines the process 
whereby words can be used to create false pictures of what he calls the 
“hereditary enemy”, and suggests ways in which writers can destroy 
these dangerous myths. 
New light is shed on the history of urbanization by an article which 
recreates the historical and cultural context which saw the birth of 
al-Kiafah, the prototype of the Islamic city, and proposes a new 
approach to the place of cities in Arab Islamic civilization. Also in this 
issue we look at some of the latest developments in the field of artificial 
intelligence research and especially the astonishing horizons being 
opened up by the development of the fifth generation computer. 
Finally, 1987 marks the bicentenary of the birth of a major figure in 
cultural history, Vuk Stefanovié¢ Karadzié. As a tribute to Karadzié, the 
father of Serbo-Croat literature who preserved treasures of the folk 
tradition, reformed the alphabet, and won a European reputation 
during his lifetime, we publish a profile of him and a short selection of 
extracts from his works.

In response to growing international concern about the problem of drugs, 
the General Assembly of the United Nations convened an International 
Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking (ICDAIT) to meet in 
Vienna (Austria) from 17 to 26 June 1987, on the initiative of the 
Secretary-General of the UN, Mr. Javier Pérez de Cuéllar. 
The goal of the Conference was to generate national, regional and interna- 
tional action to combat the drug problem in all its forms and define future 
activities on issues such as preventive education, illicit demand reduction, 
law enforcement, eradication of illicit sources of raw materials, and 
rehabilitation of drug abusers with emphasis on their integration into 
society. Some 2,500 delegates from governments all over the world attended 
the Conference, together with over 300 representatives of non-governmen- 
tal organizations, in order to confront all the aspects of the drug problem in 
the world context. 
The priority goal of Unesco’s activities relating to drugs is prevention 
through education and public information. The importance of efforts in the 
field of preventive education, encouraged by Unesco, is evoked in the 
following article by Mme. Nicole Friderich, who was for many years 
responsible for Unesco’s programme of education concerning problems 
associated with the use of drugs. The two other articles on the drug problem 
published in this issue present divergent, if not conflicting, analyses of this 
highly controversial subject. While Mr. Giuseppe di Gennaro, Executive 
Director of the United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control (UNFDAC), 
condemns the activities of the traffickers and producers of illegal drugs, 
whom he sees as the propagators of the “drug culture”, French sociologist 
Jean Baudrillard takes the view that systematic repression is an incomplete 
and even dangerous response to the social problems associated with drugs, 
especially in the industrialized countries. Preventive education as advo- 
cated by Unesco may constitute at least a partial response to the concerns 
expressed by these contributors.

### 74911: Learning to live

    
  
  
  
      
Learning tol 
by all concerned with the problem of 
drugs. The men and women 
involved in law enforcement do not let 
themselves be disheartened by the fact that 
only between 10 and 15 per cent of the illicit 
drug traffic is intercepted as a result of their 
work. They continue their efforts, seek new 
methods, draw benefit from modern tech- 
niques, and realize the importance of active 
co-operation with those who are engaged in 
scientific research into the different drugs, 
treat drug users, or attempt through educa- 
tion to limit the harm caused by drugs and 
prevent drug abuse. 
The scientists who study the chemical 
composition of legal and illegal drugs and 
their physical and psychological effects 
(about which in many cases we still know 
very little), therapists, doctors and 
psychologists, are continuing their work 
and in some cases making essential 
Poicorcinea: is a quality shared 
by Nicole Friderich 
discoveries, such as that of endorphins a 
decade ago. 
Neither these specialists nor social work- 
ers allow themselves to be discouraged by 
the fact that their devotion only achieves a 
“cure” in 30 per cent of treated cases of 
dependence on so-called hard drugs or on 
alcohol, which may be put in this category. 
They reflect on experiments that have been 
carried out, learn from their failures as well 
as their successes, compare their results, 
improve their methods, and unflaggingly 
help those who are trying to free themselves 
from the grip of drugs. Organizations such 
as Alcoholics Anonymous, whose members 
have succeeded in overcoming their depen- 
dence on certain substances, support and 
encourage those who have been unable to 
do so, and consider that their work should 
be a continuing effort. The families and 
friends of drug users often search unremit- 
tingly for a solution, sometimes ready to

strengthen their intellectual, emotional and 
moral resources, to learn to learn and to 
learn to be. 
Professional educators have been trained 
to do this; they understand the theory and 
practice of teaching, psychology and techni- 
cal skills. Family members have usually not 
had such an initiation. In their day-in, day- 
out task of bringing up young children, pos- 
sibly not their own, to live a life which in 
many cases they hope will be better than 
theirs, they rely on their personal experi- 
ence, their love, their moral or religious 
principles. 
Efforts, notably those carried out by 
Unesco, to encourage all those involved in 
education in the broadest sense to take part 
in what has been called preventive educa- 
tion, arc already bearing fruit. Those con- 
cerned with education have become aware 
of the role they can play and have spared 
neither their efforts nor their good will. 
Most of them have volunteered their help 
but have often asked “What can we do?” 
One of the first tasks has been to show 
them the preventive effects of what they 
were already doing: character training, the 
development of a critical approach, deci- 
sion-making capacities, respect for princi- 
ples, and understanding of psychological 
mechanisms; and, of course, the transmis- 
sion of knowledge of the nature and the 
effects of certain substances which are 
already studied as part of some school 
programmes or which have a domestic use. 
It has also been necessary, and this is an 
essential task, to demystify the idea of drugs 
as magical and evil substances which have 
incomprehensible effects and are totally 
alien to their experience. Many parents and 
educators have come to understand the 
problems more fully after thinking honestly 
and frankly about the use of legal drugs 
which they take or see others take. Why do 
people smoke, drink, take tranquillizers, 
stimulants and medicines which give them a 
sense of well-being? Are they seeking 
energy, relaxation, pleasure, an escape 
from stress? The phenomenon of depen- 
dence is not unfamiliar to those who have 
watched someone try to stop smoking or 
drinking, or have witnessed the anguish of a 
person deprived of his or her usual sleeping 
pill or tranquillizer. 
Educators have thus become more fully 
aware of what they already knew and have 
defined what they want to find out. They 
are not by any means seeking an 
encyclopaedic knowledge of the world’s 
countless drugs (new drugs to cure illness 
appear every day and each one is potentially 
beneficial or dangerous). But they do wish 
to be fully informed about the substances 
used in their own countries and environ- 
ments, products which certain groups or 
younger generations know more about than 
they do from their own experience, 
however biased or incomplete such “knowl- 
edge” may be. 
Parents and teachers have also made it 
clear that they want to know how to act in 
time, before it’s “too late”. They have 
asked to be informed about the signs and 
symptoms of drug taking and quickly 
realized that the most important thing they 
can do is to be attentive to the difficulties 
which seem to be faced by young or older 
people in their family or school. They have 
also asked for help in forming relationships 
with those in distress and in making contact 
with those who are at risk of turning to 
drugs (or to other expedients). 
Techniques for opening up channels of 
communication have been put forward to 
educators and they have developed others 
for themselves. Some have discovered the 
importance of active education methods, 
pupil participation and learning by doing. 
This has had a beneficial effect on their 
teaching as a whole. The efforts made by 
educators to confront an immediate prob- 
lem have committed them to action and in 
some cases encouraged them to adopt less 
theoretical approaches. 
But their work has not always been 
crowned with success. Their methods, some 
imported from other cultures or borrowed 
from other contexts, have not always been 
effective. In some cases quick and easily 
quantifiable results were expected. “Eval- 
uations” have been made without taking 
into account the objectives which had been 
set and which could have been achieved 
with the means available. The authorities, 
in some cases, and, very often, those who 
agreed to finance preventive education 
experiments, have insisted on rapid and 
spectacular results—forgetting that the 
education of a human being takes years and 
that people are free agents—and, have 
attempted to apply to prevention strict cost- 
benefit criteria. 
Far from being discouraged, parents and 
educators have continued their work. They 
have formed groups, shared their discov- 
eries, experiences, disappointments and 
successes. They have exchanged their 
ideas—and the role of an organization like 
Unesco has been of inestimable value in this 
respect. This role is still developing. In all 
the world regions, in situations where the 
pattern of drug use varies widely, a growing 
number of initiatives in favour of preventive 
education are being taken. Experience and 
innovation are complementary. No one 
ever claims that a definitive solution has 
been found. Problems are being patiently 
solved as and when they arise. 
Educators, families and youth leaders 
will continue their work. They will not 
abandon their efforts to prevent drug abuse 
since in the final analysis their motivation is 
love for those in their care and whom they 
wish to help through education to “learn to 
live”. =

Unesco 
Unesco subscribes to the definition of a drug 
formulated by the World Health Organiza- 
tion (WHO) as “any substance that when 
taken into the living organism may modify 
one or more of its functions.” This definition 
does not designate those who are dependent 
on drugs as either “abnormal” or “crimi- 
nal”, and has the advantage of being equally 
applicable to “legal” substances (tobacco, 
medicines, alcoholic beverages) and to those 
such as heroin or LSD which are proscribed 
by law. 
Unesco turned its attention to the prob- 
lems of drug abuse in 1970, in response to an 
appeal from the General Assembly of the 
United Nations. It was decided that the most 
valuable contribution Unesco could make 
would be in the areas of education, the social 
and human sciences and communication. 
The financing, directed primarily towards 
operational projects, was entrusted to the 
United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Con- 
trol (UNFDAC). 
Unesco’s programmes relating to drugs 
were drawn up in the early 1970s for the 
industrialized countries. Fifteen years later, 
at the request of the developing countries, 
which had begun to be affected by the grow- 
ing market in legal and illegal drugs, these 
programmes were expanded and strength- 
ened in order to intensify the “struggle 
against trafficking and the illicit use of 
drugs”, and to promote “education for the 
prevention of drug abuse”. 
The principles governing Unesco action 
on drugs were defined in 1972: 
® concern was to be directed towards both 
illicit drugs and those which are socially 
acceptable (such as tobacco and commonly 
used medicines); 
® drug problems were not to be looked on as 
problems specific to youth, if only because it 
is mainly adults who tend to abuse “legal” 
drugs and tend to be the producers of both 
“legal” and “illegal” drugs; 
® a distinction would be made between 
action within educational systems and public 
information im a wider context,

Unesco was soon active in a number of 
world regions. In several Asian countries, its 
education and prevention programmes have 
been integrated into those of other United 
Nations agencies. Certain projects aimed at 
finding alternative activities to the cultiva- 
tion of the opium poppy fall into this cate- 
gory. In Latin America and the Caribbean, 
where certain countries produce cocaine and 
cannabis, action is aimed primarily at pre- 
vention. In Africa, where until the mid- 
1970s the problems of drug abuse were 
almost non-existent, large sectors of the pop- 
ulation were exposed to the fluctuating drug 
market. Under Unesco auspices, representa- 
tives of six African countries met at Lomé 
(Togo) in 1976, in order to devise systems of 
preventive education. Soon afterwards, 
working groups were set up in twelve coun- 
tries, and courses in methodology were 
organized in Gabon in 1981 and in Kenya in 
1983. 
Among current projects: 
® two pilot programmes are being launched 
in Senegal and Ghana: the first stage began 
with the distribution of a questionnaire to 
assess the extent of drug abuse in both for- 
mal and out-of-school education; 
® the publication (in English and French) 
on the occasion of the United Nations Inter- 
national Conference on Drug Abuse and 
Illicit Trafficking (Vienna, June 1987), of a 
book entitled Educating Against Drug 
Abuse (see inside back cover); 
@ the production of an audiovisual montage 
on Young People and Drugs for those con- 
cerned with teaching young people in danger 
of becoming dependent on drugs; 
® the analysis of audiovisual messages and 
assessment of their impact on drug preven- 
tion campaigns; 
® continuing co-operation with non-gov- 
ernmental organizations, particularly with 
some sixty international youth organiza- 
tions.

RUGS in general no longer form 
D part of the shared values and sym- 
bolic rituals of modern industrial 
societies, which are dedicated to deferred 
gratification and ulterior purposes which 
call for a calculated sacrifice of time and 
energy. The use of drugs, on the other 
hand, always implies an immediate mental 
process and the attainment of a kind of 
utopia. All schools of thought (including 
religious thought) which have favoured the 
immediate attainment of utopia have been 
declared heretical and condemned as such 
through the ages. 
Traces of this long-standing condemna- 
tion linger on in our own vision of modern 
drugs and of the occult power they derive 
from their ancient symbolic virtues. They 
simultaneously fascinate, repel and terrify, 
and their ambivalence is virtually definitive, 
posing a problem that Western reason finds 
insoluble; they “dope” bodies and brains 
and have the same effect on our judgment 
of what they are. 
Drugs were long held—and are still held 
in current analytical thinking—to be “ano- 
mic”, in Durkheim’s sense of the term, ! like 
a certain type of suicide which is itself char- 
acteristic of the social structures of indus- 
trialized countries. Such phenomena are 
residual, marginal, beyond the pale of the 
law, outside the overall pattern of organiza- 
tion and the value-system of the group. 
Peripheral though they are, they do not call 
in question the principle of law and values 
as such, and it is not unknown for laws and 
values to absorb and integrate them. 
Today, the status of drugs seems to me to 
be totally different, along with other speci- 
fically contemporary phenomena which I 
shall call, not anomic, but anomalous. By 
this I do not mean something marginal, the 
expression of an imbalance or the organic 
deficiency of a system, but the result of an 
excess of organization, of an excessive con- 
1. The term anomie, as coined by the French social 
scientist Emile Durkheim (1858-1917), denotes the con- 
dition of a society or a social group which results when its 
members are deprived of norms or standards of be- 
haviour and of ideals which give meaning to their aspir- 
ations. Editor

### 74912: A Perverse logic'

‘A perverse logic’ 
by Jean Baudrillard 
cern with balance, regulation and rationa- 
lization in a given system. Such a phe- 
nomenon, seemingly extraneous, conflicts 
with the workings of the system, for no 
apparent reason, but in fact it is a conse- 
quence of the very logic of the system, of the 
excessive logic and rationality of a system— 
in this case society in the industrialized 
countries—which, having reached a certain 
level of saturation, secretes antibodies 
which express its internal diseases, its 
strange malfunctions, its unforeseeable and 
incurable breakdowns—in a word, its 
anomalies. 
In such systems this is not the result of 
society’s inability to integrate its marginal 
phenomena; on the contrary, it stems from 
an overcapacity for integration and standar- 
dization. When this happens, societies 
which seem all-powerful are destabilized 
from within, with serious consequences, for 
the more efforts the system makes to orga- 
nize itself in order to get rid of its anoma- 
lies, the further it will take its logic of 
over-organization, and the more it will 
nourish the outgrowth of those anomalies.

human relations without drugs”

A 
A naively rationalist (educational and 
therapeutic) conception of these systems 
must be discarded (and this applies not only 
to social systems but also to cybernetic and 
computerized systems). In the past, the ex- 
istence of anomic peripheries prompted the 
system to become even more rationalized, 
but today itis the over-rationalization of the 
system which causes and strengthens ano- 
malous developments. 
This “perverse” logic must be taken into 
account and a distinction must be made 
between drug-taking connected with econo- 
mic and social underdevelopment (as it still 
is in developing countries or, in the case of 
alcohol, in underprivileged classes) and 
drug-taking linked to the saturation of the 
consumer society. The latter type began to 
emerge in the 1960s in the industrialized 
countries, as both the apogee of consump- 
tion and a parody of it, as an anomaly which 
challenged a world that had to be escaped 
from because it was foo full, not because it 
lacked something. Perhaps there is a lesson 
here for developing societies, which are still 
ambivalent in terms of their organization. 
In these countries, then, we are dealing 
with drug use of what might be called a 
“second order” which should not be con- 
fused with the other type, for neither its 
limits, nor its characteristics nor, obviously, 
its prevention, will be the same. In particu- 
lar, we must consider the problem of drugs 
in connection with all the “second order” 
phenomena which are contemporary with it 
and which follow the same “anomalous” 
logic. We must look at the various types of 
“second order” violence, which do not stem 
from straightforward delinquency or

more controlled and more coercive, there- 
by perpetuating the vicious circle. 
We must take account of such types of 
“second order” pathological phenomena as 
AIDS and cancer, which are not traditional 
diseases due to the organic deficiency of 
bodies exposed to an attack from outside, 
but a consequence of the destabilization of 
over-protected bodies (over-protected by 
all our hygienic, chemical, medical, social 
and psychological prostheses), which there- 
by lose their immunity and become a prey to 
any virus. Just as there is apparently no 
“political” solution to the problem of ter- 
rorism, for the time being there seems to be 
no biomedical solution to the problem of 
AIDS and cancer—and for the same 
reason. These are, in fact, anomalous 
occurrences, turning with savage, reactive 
violence against the political or biological 
over-control of the body, whether it be the 
social or the individual organism. 
Such phenomena spring from a “darker 
side” of human experience. Drug use and 
abuse form part of this syndrome. The exist- 
ence of this darker side and the behaviour 
resulting from it may be deplored but its 
symbolic necessity cannot be denied. As the 
French writer Georges Bataille has shown, 
ary ar heh " 
. he 
the darker side (“La part maudite”) plays a 
fundamental role in most societies, in ways 
which may be more or less explicit. 
One thing is certain: a society that 
attempts to purge itself entirely of this dar- 
ker side runs a very great risk. Such a desire 
nevertheless forms part of the rationalist 
paranoia of the social systems of industrial- 
ized countries. The negative aspects of this 
darker side are, admittedly, important and 
should not be ignored, but they should be 
set against the far more serious loss that 
might result from its destruction. Such an 
act would generate cancers and viruses that 
would be far more malignant and would not 
even have the charm of malediction to re- 
commend them. 
This is the crux of the ambiguity and the 
paradox of drugs: in some countries drug- 
taking is a symptom of the collective loss of 
immune defences or of the individual loss of 
symbolic defences—a situation in which 
some societies become vulnerable to terror- 
ism, drug addiction and violence (but also 
to depression or to fascism). And it is ob- 
vious that the only solution would be to 
restore those immunities and those symbo- 
lic defences. But in the West we also know 
that we live in a system which is tending, in 
the very name of science and progress, to 
destroy all natural immunities and to re- 
place them with substitute systems of artifi- 
cial immunity. 
Why should we expect such a system to 
change direction? And now we see the use 
of drugs from another, exactly opposite, 
angle: while it is part of the immune de- 
ficiency syndrome, it is itself a defence. 
Better defences may exist, but it is possible

to speculate (for we must respond to such 
an insoluble state of affairs with paradoxical 
hypotheses) that the use and abuse of drugs 
may be a vital and symbolic reaction, 
however despairing and suicidal it may 
seem, against something still worse. 
Without by any means yielding to the 
temptations of the over-optimistic ideology 
in the West during the 1960s and 1970s 
concerning the “expansion of conscious- 
ness”, there are grounds for thinking, much 
more prosaically, that this is not only an 
impulse to flee from the objective process of 
brutalization that life in some societies may 
be, but a collective movement of avoid- 
ance, a shared reflex of flight from the 
universal standardization, rationalization 
and regimentation which undoubtedly con- 
stitute, in the long term, a much more se- 
rious danger to society and to the human 
race. We know that individuals use neurosis 
as an effective protection against madness; 
similarly, it is possible to use, not absolute 
good, but relative evil, as a defence against 
absolute evil. The Church has coped with its 
heresies in the same way, by treating them 
as necessary (from its point of view) aberra- 
tions, as harmful offshoots (but offshoots 
nevertheless). A Church which no longer 
generates heresies or which has stamped 
them all out begins to wither, just as a body 
which no longer produces any kind of 
offshoots, including those which work for 
its destruction, is a dead body. 
That said, drug-taking in the industrial- 
ized countries is no longer in its intensive 
phase, the phase sustained by euphoric or 
glorifying rhetoric, whether subversive or 
suicidal. It is in its extensive phase: while it 
is spreading and gaining ground, it is in the 
process becoming less virulent for society. 
Itis no longer a more or less subversive type 
of anomy, but an anomaly which is becom- 
ing institutionalized. 
How should we react to this process of 
familiarization? Should we fight it even 
more strenuously? A hard new anti-drug 
philosophy (now that there is no longer any 
philosophy of drugs) may seem problema- 
tic. In this state of precarious balance, or 
imbalance, of the immune system of society 
and of the individual, where drugs play an 
ambiguous role, such an approach intro- 
duces a rigid moralizing element, a rigid 
dichotomy between law and anomy which is 
no longer appropriate for the delicate man- 
agement of anomalies (this rigidity is, 
moreover, itself highly ambiguous, since it 
is often a disguise for political strategies in 
which drug-taking, like any other form of 
delinquency, is used as an easy alibi). 
It is imperative to realize that the prob- 
lem of drug-taking must be approached 
with sensitivity, and (because it is an ambi- 
guous problem) with strategies that are 
themselves ambiguous. The best form of 
prevention is to introduce a symbolical ele- 
ment into the social strategy, a difficult 
undertaking which involves flying in the 
face of today’s excessive rationalization and 
Giving young people help and support is 
an essential part of a preventive approach

social organization. Lack of a ready-made 
solution does not spell failure, and we must 
at all costs avoid clear-cut, unilateral 
strategies of denunciation, whereby one 
kind of society takes complacent refuge in 
its own hypocrisy. Drug-use is a question to 
which there are no glib answers. Nor should 
too hasty a distinction be drawn between 
drug use and abuse: no one could trace 
clearly the unstable boundaries between 
them. 
All drugs, hard or soft, including tobac- 
co, alcohol and all modern variants, are a 
means of exorcism: they exorcise reality, 
the social order and callous indifference. 
But it should not be forgotten that, through 
drugs, society itself exorcises certain forgot- 
oa 'SINMY HANDS 
ten powers, certain drives, certain inner 
contradictions. Exorcism is production for 
the sake of rejection. Society produces this 
effect, and society condemns it. Failing the 
ability to stop producing it (which is consi- 
dered desirable), society should at least 
cease to condemn it. [|

HE increase in drug dependence 
] among young people is creating 
exacting new problems for educa- 
tors, who need to grasp the true nature and 
scope of the phenomenon in order to carry 
out their duties. 
The non-medical use of drugs has always 
existed, but in forms which have little in 
common with drug dependence among 
young people as we know it today. 
Historical and anthropological research 
has shown that in the past drug-taking was 
almost always confined to adults. Adoles- . 
cents were never involved. Drugs were 
taken sporadically for mystical, religious or 
ritual purposes, and only by certain groups 
and in certain circumstances. The impor- 
tant thing about the practice and purpose of 
these forms of drug taking was the absence 
of dependence. 
Later, when morphine, heroin and 
cocaine began to be used, there were cases 
of addiction among adults, but until the 
mid-1960s the numbers involved were so 
small that the phenomenon never reached a 
socially significant scale and on the whole 
attracted little attention. 
It was not until the late 1960s that drug 
abuse began to make inroads among young 
people and children and eventually became 
a world problem, as uncontrollable waves 
of epidemic proportions swept from con- 
tinent to continent. 
It is therefore both mistaken and dan- 
gerous to assume that the present situation 
is simply the continuation of the past. It is 
mistaken because only today have drugs 
become a culture which everyone must 
face. It is dangerous because it makes peo- 
ple less vigilant and encourages passivity 
and acceptance. We expect that the damage 
will be limited and that the community will 
continue to take things in its stride as it has 
done over the centuries. 
by Giuseppe di Gennaro 
Educators must take stock of the dangers 
that drugs represent for children and ado- 
lescents today, foresee possible future 
developments, understand the causes of the 
situation and the forces underlying it, and 
introduce ‘appropriate remedial measures 
into the educational process. This is an 
arduous task, as can be seen from the per- 
sistence and increasing gravity of drug 
dependence in spite of the determination of 
many educators and the hard work they 
have done in the last twenty years. 
The subject has been exhaustively dis- 
cussed. Whole libraries of books have been 
devoted to it, written by specialists in every 
branch of knowledge; research has been 
carried out by highly qualified authorities 
and organizations; innumerable con- 
ferences and meetings have been held, both 
local and international; but the guidelines 
for reliable and effective educational 
defence measures have still not been clearly 
and unequivocally defined. 
It is thus vital to continue our efforts to 
understand the situation and deal with it 
more effectively. The purpose of this article 
is to stimulate critical reflection about cer- 
tain widely held beliefs. There is a risk that 
such beliefs may be considered to be abso- 
lutely true, although they are not, and be 
taken, wrongly, as a basis for educational 
theory and practice, now and in the future. 
These beliefs all stem from the assump- 
tion that drug dependence among young 
people is due to factors caused by the 
changes and tensions of modern society. In 
accordance with this assumption various sit- 
uations have been singled out and blamed 
for the spread of drugs. An exhaustive list of 
these situations would be extremely long 
and is unnecessary for our purpose. We 
shall merely point out certain widely 
accepted allegations.

It has been suggested that the spread of 
drug dependence is due to the loosening 
of traditional family, ties. However, some 
doubt was cast on this theory when drug 
dependence was observed among young 
people in a context of stable family struc- 
tures. Above, Family Group (1945-1949) by

countries, where the family has been 
affected by the demands made by the level 
of organization and by the tenstons of indus- 
trialized society. 
The family and especially the parents 
were blamed for this tragedy. Today, many 
people question their culpability, having 
seen situations in which the epidemic of 
drug-taking on the part of young people has 
appeared in a context characterized by 
social and economic immobility and the sta- 
bility of family structures. 
Lastly, the idea that there is a causal link 
between unemployment and drugs has 
recently been disproved by the spread of 
drug dependence among workers. 
Logically enough, whenever one of these 
theories was put forward, those concerned 
with the prevention and treatment of drug 
dependence took action against the sup- 
posed causes of the phenomenon. In con- 
sequence, for more than twenty years we 
have seen a feverish succession of prescrip- 
tions and measures intended to tackle a 
wide variety of different “causes”. Every- 
one agrees that education is an essential 
tool in combating drug dependence, above 
all as a means of prevention. However, it 
has lost its bearings and is now at the centre 
of a heated argument that is fed by alternat- 
ing aetiological “credos”. 
The inability of the family and the school 
to perform their respective educational 
functions has been castigated by the suppor- 
ters of these different theories, who main- 
tain that certain factors are the cause—or at 
least contribute to the cause—that corre- 
sponds to their particular theories. The fol- 
lowing remarks are intended to help these 
two great forces which are under accusa- 
tion—the family and the school—to 
rediscover their bearings and to perform 
their difficult task successfully, each in its 
own sphere of responsibilities and each 
applying its own methods. 
Although family upbringing and school 
education have much in common as regards 
their dynamic and their aims, there are 
important differences between them. 
By family upbringing we mean the natu- 
ral process by which parents and other 
members of the family nucleus transmit to 
their children a number of messages, by 
word, action and behaviour. Such messages 
give, more or less directly, an indication of 
what “should be”—in other words, guid- 
ance for living and an idea of the behaviour 
that is expected of young people. 
School education, on the other hand, is 
an institutional process designed to inte- 
grate the process of family upbringing. In 
school education trained professionals 
transmit messages which are meant to 
inform their pupils and influence their 
behaviour by means of the values and ideals 
that they assimilate. 
The process of family upbringing is 
largely unconscious, and in the mechanism 
whereby messages are transmitted and 
received the emotional or affective element 
is usually more potent than the intellectual 
or cognitive element. School education, on 
the other hand, is a conscious process, 
although the emotional or affective element 
may play an important part in it. 
The two educational processes, for all

their differences, have one thing in com- 
mon: they interact with a series of influ- 
ences originating in the circumstances of the 
young person’s life. It is clear that the effect 
of identical educational processes will vary 
as a result of different external influences. It 
is generally realized that the influence of 
friends, or the “peer group”, is extremely 
powerful in this respect, especially at cer- 
tain stages of adolescence. 
If the influence of the peer group conveys 
the values of an alien or hostile culture, it 
will encourage and strengthen attitudes of 
confrontation and opposition to the 
authority of parents and teachers, together 
with rejection of the culture to which the 
family and the school owe allegiance. 
Instead of being a part of the growing-up 
process, when adolescents assert their own 
personalities and attempt to throw off the 
bonds of parental authority, this stage may 
on the contrary become an opportunity for 
messages from alien and hostile cultural 
sources to enter their minds. The young 
person’s personality becomes a battle-field, 
in which the more powerful influences can 
be expected to prevail. 
How does the peer group transmit the 
messages of the drug culture while the 
school and the vast majority of families 
belong to a different culture? To answer this 
question, we need to know where the drug 
culture comes from and what sustains it. 
The idea that young people themselves 
create the drug culture because of weak- 
nesses in family upbringing and school edu- 
cation is thoughtless and superficial. Relia- 
ble research findings now indicate that the 
drug culture is the outcome of shrewd 
manipulation by the many persons who 
work for the barons of the drug traffic. 
Preventive education against the abuse of 
legal or illegal drugs is at the heart of 
Unesco’s action against drug depen- 
dence. Below, schoolchildren in Singa- 
pore examine the diseased lung of a dead

These powerful figures possess very consid- 
erable financial resources and highly effi- 
cient and far-reaching organizations. Just as 
the great fashion centres and the producers 
of other consumer goods create and impose 
a culture that aspires to the acquisition of 
such products, so those who control the vast 
drug market create and impose a culture 
that leads inevitably to drug abuse and the 
spread of drug dependence. In this market, 
young people are not active agents; they are 
conditioned customers. 
If this is true, it is false and unjust to 
blame the family or the school, and it is 
pointless to look for causal factors among 
social phenomena or tensions. Drug depen- 
dence springs from the drug culture, which, 
in its turn, is created by drug traffickers and 
their battalions of propagandists. 
The family and the school should realize 
this; they should stop feeling guilty and 
 
should understand that, in the present state 
of affairs, if they wish to protect young peo- 
ple they must do more than generate and 
transmit traditional positive influences. 
Drug abuse will not be beaten unless the 
drug culture is beaten too, and this means 
waging a determined struggle against illicit 
drug production and trafficking and against 
the powerful criminal syndicates that grow 
rich in this way. 
Of course the family and the school have 
arole to play, but their efforts will be inade- 
quate if not fruitless unless government 
institutions and the resources of the com- 
munity are mobilized to defeat those 
responsible for the scourge of drug 
dependence. u 
Drug taking is no recent phenomenon, and 
drug abuse has been resisted throughout 
history. In an episode from the Sirat 
Baybars, a folk account of the life of 
Baybars |, a 13th-century Mamiuk Sultan

ruption, crime, prostitution and hashish

### 74915: The New world of artificial intelligence

i —_— 
The new world 
“of artificial intelligence 
- 
simist could say that a computer, for all 
its capacity for rapid calculation, was a 
“high-speed idiot” because it could not “rea- 
T: days may soon be past when a pes- 
“son”. We are now moving into the age of 
“intelligent machines” and of “artificial intel- 
ligence"—a discipline that has an important 
place in informatics. 
Artificial intelligence is a branch of informa- 
tics which studies the theoretical bases, meth- 
odologies and techniques which make it pos- 
sible to design hardware and software 
systems capable of performing tasks which to 
the non-expert would seem to belong 
exclusively to human intelligence. The aim of 
artificial intelligence research is to produce 
systems which behave intelligently and inter- 
act with the world outside them just as human 
beings do. 
In practice, the results of research into artifi- 
cial intelligence are now becoming part of our 
everyday lives. Artificial intelligence systems 
are acting as advisers and experts in such 
fields as lexicological analysis, medical diag- 
nosis and genetic engineering. There are 
robots which have the power of perception 
and visual recognition and the ability to 
behave rationally in unfamiliar circumstances, 
terminals which converse in natural lan- 
guages, either in speech or writing (though 
there are limits to their abilities in this sphere), 
systems that solve problems and demon- 
strate theorems. 
Every two years, specialists meet to 
exchange information at the International 
Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence 
(ICAI), which is usually held in a leading 
world centre for study in this field. The first 
conference was held in Washington, D.C., in 
1969, and since then conferences have taken 
place in London, Stanford, Thilisi, Cambridge, 
Tokyo, Vancouver, Karlsruhe and Los 
Angeles. This year the Conference is being 
held in Milan, in recognition of work done in 
italy in this field of advanced research. It will 
take place from 23 to 28 August, in the Centro 
Congressi Mirafori. 
The philosophy of IJCAI is based on the 
belief that contemporary thought has suc- 
ceeded in unifying the concept of culture; the 
old idea that scientific culture and humanistic 
culture are two different things has been dis- 
carded. The culture of our day should there- 
fore be characterized by the synthesis of 
these two forms of mental activity. 
Artificial intelligence is thus claimed to be 
the supreme example of an interdisciplinary 
subject, as was made clear at a symposium to 
prepare for the IJCAl Conference in Milan, 
held at the St. Vincent Cultural Centre (Italy) 
on 21 February last. The work of the sym- 
posium, entitled in an allusion to Beckett's 
_—_———— 
play, “Waiting for Robots: the immediate 
future of artificial intelligence”, could perhaps 
be summarized by saying that two fundamen- 
tal questions are being asked in this field: how 
far and how soon will robotics be able to take 
the place of man; and will man ultimately be 
rivalled, if not completely outstripped, by 
machines. 
Mr. Basilio Catania, the director of the Turin 
Telecommunications Research Centre and 
Laboratories, a leading Italian research 
institution in the field of artificial intelligence, 
pointed out that man possesses muscle 
power, faculties of perception, and intel- 
ligence. Over the centuries, man has con- 
stantly aimed to extend these capacities. His 
first success in enhancing his muscle power, 
the invention of the wheel, was followed by 
many others and culminated inthe harnessing 
of the atom. He enhanced his faculties of per- 
ception by inventing increasingly efficient 
tools, leading to the development of the elec- 
tron microscope, the radio telescope, and 
television. 
In the sphere of human intelligence, one of 
the most significant steps forward was the 
invention of the pocket calculator, the pro- 
totype of the complex modern machines 
which make it possible to increase man's 
mental capacity and will do so to a still greater 
degree in the future. Artificial intelligence sim-

Some key words in artificial intelligence 
The expression artificial intelligence was formulated for the first time in 1956 by John McCarthy of 
Stanford University (United States). 
This new discipline proposes to overcome the current limits of informatics in certain areas, improving 
and extending the performance of computers. Its purpose is not to “simulate” human intelligence but to 
“emulate” it, since there is no basis for excluding the possibility that some manifestations of human 
intelligence, problem-solving, for example, can also be provided by adopting methodological approa- 
ches that are not necessarily anthropomorphic. 
Within artificial intelligence, an Expert System is a system capable of automatically solving problems 
of a certain type, proposed by the users of the system. An Expert System is the result of the collaboration | 
of two designers, the “knowledge engineer” who develops the algorithms (the sequences of instructions 
for solving a particular problem) necessary to construct the solution and the structures suitable for 
receiving the base information, and the “problem expert” who furnishes the body of facts and deductive 
rules, called the knowledge base of the Expert System. 
Industrial exploitation of Expert Systems will increase with the use of fifth generation machines (see 
article page 16) which are currently the subiect of intensive research. The Expert System is directly 
embedded in the electronic architecture of these machines, which are created with the most advanced 
technologies of microelectronics, such as Very Large Scale Integration circuits, which present a million 
transistors on a single silicon chip.

ply enables man to “extend” his own intel- 
ligence, as it were, by providing a “prosthesis” 
to help him perform various functions. 
We must, however, beware of thinking of 
the future of these “prostheses of intel- 
ligence” as a collection of anthropomorphic 
robots: a car may be regarded as a prosthesis 
of legs, but it is not the same thing. 
One of the most advanced fields of artificial 
intelligence research has led to the con- 
struction of what are known as “connection 
machines”, in which a large number of tiny 
calculators, instead of working sequentially, 
work on various pieces of information at the 
same time—which is what happens in the 
human brain—and combine the results. This 
was the field selected for the EEC project on 
“Basic research in adaptive intelligence and 
neurocomputing”. 
The great scientific discoveries of the twen- 
tieth century, such as the splitting of the atom 
and, more recently, genetic engineering, have 
conferred on man enormous powers which 
can be used for good or ill. Artificial intel- 
ligence, too, may be used for good or ill. The 
availability of vast amounts of information 
which can be analysed in a fraction of a sec- 
ond can be a source of financial and political 
power and can thus be open to all kinds of 
abuse. But artificial intelligence can also bring 
many advantages. It may help to provide more 
rewarding occupations for millions of people, 
increase productivity and take some of the 
drudgery cut of work. 
Advances in the field of artificial intelligence 
will soon produce “fall-out” which may have 
surprising and awe-inspiring consequences 
such as giving sight to the blind. A project now 
under way at Rockville, Maryland, is currently 
examining the possibility of using about a hun- 
dred thousand micro-electrodes, associated 
with nerve cells in the embryonic phase of the 
visual cortex, to connect with the visual struc- 
tures of the brain and give sight—even if cnly 
rudimentary sight—thanks to a microscopic 
telecamera implanted in a pair of spectacles, 
completely by-passing the eyeballs and the 
optic nerve.

The searcn4ora thinki 
As part of an unparalleled long-term re- 
search and development effort, computer 
scientists in a number of countries are 
today trying to bridge the gap between the 
limited computer intelligence that exists 
now and something approaching human 
capacities. One of many obstacles in this 
search for a machine as intelligent as man 
lies in the limitations of conventional com- 
puters which perform their operations one 
step at a time. The search for a solution to 
this problem has led to the development of 
“parallel processing” systems which 
operate on thousands of data elements at 
once. in the computer shown above tens of 
thousands of processors co-operate on 
the processing of a single task.

ITH few exceptions, all present com- 
WwW puters are von Neumann compu- 
ters, so called after John von Neu- 
mann, one of the scientists whose work was 
seminal in creating and developing these 
machines. The von Neumann computer is 
characterized by data and programs that are 
stored together (stored program) and pro- 
grams that are executed sequentially 
(sequential control). In the von Neumann 
computer, everything to be done must be 
defined in advance in the form of procedure. 
The program describes procedures in a lan- 
guage the computer can understand. In the 
program, the procedure is called an algorithm. 
This system presents no problems for numeri- 
cal computation and routine clerical process- 
ing, since procedures can be pre-defined for 
this kind of work.

However, most activity requiring human 
intelligence is characterized by the need to 
accommodate strategies flexibly to the 
demands and complexity of a particular situa- 
tion. Using the example of language, which is 
the basis of intelligent activity, the meaning of 
a word may vary with the situation in which itis 
used. The meaning of a word also changes in 
relation to surrounding words. The meaning of 
a sentence also depends on the object of the 
sentence and circumstances of use. 
Consequently, when one tries to write a 
program to analyse the meaning of awoerdin a 
sentence, all cases in which the word can be 
used must be considered. However, the num- 
ber of cases will be colossal, and even if all 
cases could ever be listed the program would 
never be completed in a reasonable time. In 
other words, such a program would have very

little practical value because of the excessive 
processing time. 
tis clear that computers must perform intel- 
ligently and flexibly in the applications 
required by the society of the 1990s. The 
problem is how to develop a computer with 
this capability. A first approximation to solving 
this problem can be found in artificial intel- 
ligence research. But because of the limita- 
tions described, the results of artificial intel- 
ligence research cannot be put into practical 
use with existing computers. 
Stated simply, the goal of artificial inte!- 
ligence research is that computers should 
perform in an identical or similar manner to 
human intelligence. 
This research takes two approaches: one 
models the mechanism of human intelligence; 
the other attempts to achieve human intel- 
ligence in the computer by processes that are 
not necessarily the same as actual human 
intelligence, the emphasis being on the result. 
Major themes of current research in artificial 
intelligence are: 
1) Proof of theorems. Conclusions are made 
based upon axioms and inference rules. The 
computer can be an aid in proving theorems, 
but this field has not developed to the point 
where computers can automatically prove 
theorems that human beings cannot. 
2) Games. Studies aim at methods of choos- 
ing the best move in all game situations and 
strategies for winning the game. This field has 
developed a number of methods of finding the 
best of all possible moves and thus has 
helped to solve problems. 
3) Robots. Research and development in this 
  
area is mainly aimed at controlling manipula- 
tors to perform skilful work, developing sen- 
sors, and developing high-level languages to 
describe work environments and commands. 
4) Vision understanding. The aim here is to 
make it possible for computers to recognize 
faces, scenes, photographs, etc. A variety of 
image analysis methods have been 
developed. As a result, computers can now 
recognize complicated scenes on condition 
that knowledge on the subject be input pre- 
viously. However, a general method of coping 
with a wide range of objects has not yet been 
developed. 
5) Natural-language understanding and 
voice recognition. How to make computers 
understand sentences and speech in natural 
language, e.g., in Japanese, English or 
French, is the focus of this field of study. There 
are already some experimental systems that 
can understand English or Japanese when 
objects are limited. However, as the number 
of objects increases, the number of words and 
sentences required increases even more, 
necessitating common sense and inference 
rules. Thus, much further study is required. 
6) Knowledge engineering. Research in this 
area aims at storing experts’ knowledge and 
automatically finding the answer to a given 
problem. The system used for this purpose is 
called an expert system (see box page 14). 
Efforts have been made to apply this to medi- 
cal treatment, machine design/maintenance/ 
repair, and education. 
What are known as “fifth generation” sys- 
tems are being designed to overcome the 
shortcomings of the present-day computer. 
1. Computer “generations” have been defined by 
the components used: 
In particular, research is concentrated on 
knowledge information processing. 
Computers of the past and present genera- 
tions have simple hardware architecture and 
implement complex functions through soft- 
ware. In 1982, the Japanese Ministry for Inter- 
national Trade and Industry initiated a project 
to develop computers capable of forming the 
basis of an advanced information society in 
the 1990s. Inthis project, it was decided touse 
technologies that are essentially different 
from those of the past. 
"In other words, the ultimate form of fifth 
generation computer should be oriented to 
knowledge information processing and 
achieved on the basis of revolutionary theo- 
ries and technologies. The fifth generation 
computer is a knowledge information pro- 
cessing system that, overcoming the tech- 
nical limitations of conventional computers, 
implements the intelligent conversation and 
knowledge base inference functions required 
in the 1990s. its applications are expected to 
be more extensive than those of conventional 
computers. 
The four basic functions the fifth generation 
computer must achieve are: 
1) Problem solving and inference func- 
tions. Logical deductive inference and induc- 
tive inference to solve a given problem, includ- 
ing guesses based on incomplete knowledge. 
2) Knowledge base management func- 
tions. Acquisition, storage, and utilization of 
various kinds of knowledge required in the 
inference process. 
3) Intelligent interface functions. External 
interfaces that use natural language (sen-

ligence, computers are being asked to 
solve an array of real-life problems rang- 
ing from the diagnosis of iliness and the 
prescription of treatment, to exploration 
for minerals. “Expert systems” are pro- 
grams which help the computer to mimic 
the behaviour of human experts when 
tackling these problems. The questions

dialogue between a tomato-grower and

Advanced computer technology has made it possible to endow 
robots with “sight”, a sense of touch, and in some cases the 
ability to respond to voice commands and make basic decisions 
about the situations they encounter. Photo above shows “Maga- 
li”, an apple-picking robot developed in France. Artificial vision is 
an essential component in Magali, whose arm is guided to the 
fruit by a television camera associated with a microcomputer. In 
robot vision systems a computer analyses an image, converted 
into digital form, fed into it from a television camera and directs 
  
the robot to perform a specific task when it “detects” certain 
features that have been programmed into its memory. Below, a 
computer-controlled hand developed at the Massachusetts Insti- 
tute of Technology (MIT). The hand is capable of picking up an 
egg without breaking it. Each finger can make 40 movements a 
second. Covered with a plastic skin equipped with sensors, the 
hand can “recognize” different materials such as metal, plastic 
and wood, and instantaneously measure the temperature of ob- 
jects that it touches.

tence, voice), graphics, and images, and can 
converse naturally. 
4) Intelligent programming functions. 
Functions to automatically convert a given 
problem to efficient computer programs. 
To achieve these functions, various tech- 
nologies of hardware architecture, software 
engineering, and artificial intelligence are 
being studied and developed. 
The first task for achieving knowledge infor- 
mation processing and fifth generation com- 
puters is the selection of the programming 
‘language best suited to describe intelligent 
activity by the computer. To select the lan- 
guage, it is necessary to understand the fun- 
damental mechanism of the intelligent activity 
to be described. It should be noted that the 
present computer is a machine developed to 
model the fundamental mechanism of numeri- 
cal computation: that is, the four rules of 
arithmetic. 
In fifth generation computer systems, logic, 
in particular predicate logic, was selected as 
the principle of intelligent activity. Logicis gen- 
erally regarded as the universal rule of 
thought. Of numerous types of logic, predicate 
logic is most closely related to our daily lan- 
guage. This means that anyone can handle 
predicate logic, although it may seem difficult 
at first because of its rigour. 
Of course, predicate logic alone cannot 
account for all intelligent activities; it is cer- 
tainly, however, the most powerful logic for 
description. 
The basic mechanism of logic is inference. 
Inference is arigorous procedure for acquiring 
unknown information using known informa- 
tion and knowledge. Inference plays a central 
role in our understanding of meaning, whether 
or not we are conscious of its use. The basis of 
intelligent activity is to possess knowledge 
and make inferences. 
Inference is made according to inference

rules. The most fundamental inference rule is 
the syllogism. A syllogism is a form of reason- 
ing as follows: Ais B; Bis C; therefore, Ais C. 
One method of having the computer make 
inferences automatically is to incorporate this 
inference rule in the hardware, and this is the 
approach of the project on fifth generation 
computer systems. 
The method of describing a program log- 
ically and executing it by inference is called 
logic programming. Predicate logic programs 
allow parallel processing, which resembles 
the process of obtaining unknown quantities 
in a system of simultaneous linear equations 
concurrently. One objective of the fifth gener- 
ation computer systems project is to achieve 
parallel processing directly by hardware. In 
other words, the project aims at developing 
computers that can perform symbol-crunch- 
ing computation at high speed. For this rea- 
son, the final form of the fifth generation com- 
puter will be a parallel inference machine 
consisting of a number of element processors. 
The research and development of fifth gen- 
eration computer systems involves many 
unknown factors and great risks. For this rea- 
son, the research and development period 
spans ten years and is divided into three 
stages—three years for the initial stage, four 
years for the intermediate, and three years for 
the final stage. 
Fifth generation computer systems could 
be applied to any area that requires problem 
solving and inference functions. 
To take the example of medical treatment, 
countless applications can be listed: auto- 
matic nursing systems monitoring serious 
cases through the night and giving treatment 
support when the patient's condition changes 
suddenly; systems to help analyse X-ray films 
or tomograms and diagnose the area for treat- 
ment; systems to help determine the name of 
the illness or prescribe medicine based on 
 
various check data; systems to devise duty 
schedules for nurses and systems to decide 
menus. When studies in natural-language 
understanding advance further and machine 
translation at higher levels becomes possible, 
or when people place international calls to 
speakers of another language, both parties 
may be able to speak in their own tongue. In 
education, more effective educational sys- 
tems can be expected, in which one will be 
able to judge the optimum way-of giving 
instructions to each individual. Present com- 
puter aided instruction (CAl) systems cannot 
do this. 
Needless to say, these applications will 
occur not only through the achievements of 
research on fifth generation computer sys- 
tems but also through research in artificial 
intelligence that makes clear the models and 
mechanisms of intelligent functions. Thus, 
continued research is very important. 
The goal of the fifth generation computer 
systems project is to create a knowledge infor- 
mation processing system that can help peo- 
ple solve problems in their exploration of the 
unknown, and significantly extend the scope 
of their intellectual activity. This will have 
an immeasurable impact on industry and 
society. LS

### 74918: The City-builders of Islam

The city-builders of Islam 
¢ OR a Muslim ... the term ‘Mother 
KF Nature’ defies translation. The 
Muslim is no ecologist. ... Islam 
took root in regions where nature is, gener- 
ally speaking, hostile to man. ... Its ideal is 
the artificial world—the city, the irrigation 
system, the garden, which is introduced into 
the home and represented in the design of a 
carpet. The poetry of Islamic urban culture 
speaks not of virgin landscapes but of the 
flowers of the garden. ...”! 
These words of the Islamist Josef van Ess 
are a reminder of the value that the city 
holds—as we would expect of a great civi- 
lization—for Islam, and above all for 
Arabs. In the Islamic context, the con- 
notations of terms such as “city”, 
“urbanity”, “urbanism”, even “civility”, 
are so similar as to make these words vir- 
tually interchangeable. The city is the art of 
living together. Islam, then, it might a priori 
be concluded, is a founding, constructing 
and urbanizing, rather than a conquering 
civilization. Whereas relations between 
other cities, as, for example, in ancient 
Greece, were marked by rivalry, among 
Islamic cities there existed a sense of mem- 
bership of an urban society with a shared 
culture and way of life. 
To understand this phenomenon we need 
to examine the genesis of the Islamic city, 
provided that we can find an example that is 
sufficiently ancient and representative. 
What better prototype could there be than 
Al-Kufah (Iraq), the first city of Islam, 
whose birth was recently related in a book 
by the Tunisian historian Hichem Djait?* 
But first, a little historical background. 
Kifah was founded in AH 17/AD 638, dur- 
ing the early years of the rise of Islam, five 
years after the collapse of the kingdom of 
the Lakhmids during the reign of Khosrow 
II. Symbol and centre of the new Arab 
sway, Kofah was constructed near al-Hira, 
the Lakhmid capital which for three cen- 
turies had dominated the region and whose 
power and functions Kiifah was eventually 
to take over. The Islamic empire was 
founded, and a decisive step forward in 
human progress, the abandonment of 
nomadism in favour of sedentary life, was 
initiated. 
Kifah drew its strength from the relative 
financial autonomy of the new province. In 
by Mohammed Allal Sinaceur 
selecting its site, Caliph ‘Umar I is said to 
have decreed that no bahr (river) should 
separate it from Medina. The first Islamic - 
city outside Arabia had to be in direct spa- 
tial contact with the homeland. This prere- 
quisite was later applied to other towns. 
Only conditions that suited their camels, 
said Caliph ‘Umar, were right for Arabs— 
zones open to the steppe and in uninter- 
rupted contact with pastoral life. 
Such, indeed, was the position of Kiifah, 
remote yet in contact, on the border of 
steppe and cultivated land, and thus a focal 
point of interchange and complementarity. 
The first city of Islam, Kiifah symbolized its 
spirit: a civilization of borders and links, of - 
transition and mediation; for, in terms of 
human geography, the role of Islam has 
been to provide the “bridges”, the 
“railheads”, the “termini” which link the 
towns of the desert to the huge cities of the 
North. 
Some historians relate that, at the found- 
ing of the city, a site was marked out by 
shooting arrows from a central point at 
which were located the masdjid (mosque) 
and the palace. Town-planning was born

when the construction of permanent, mud-

that houses should be limited to three 
rooms and should not be too high, that 
roads should be clearly defined and that 
land should be allotted to the tribes in con- 
formity with the regulations, it is clear that 
town-planning (fakhtit) and civilization 
(tamsir) went hand in hand, at the same 
pace and on the same wave of progress, with 
the aim of establishing a defined and 
ordered space to which the Umayyads were 
later to add the seal of truly monumental 
constructions tuned to the harmonies of 
other disciplines. 
What was the source of this organiza- 
tional plan, of the juxtaposition of mosque 
and palace? What were the origins of the 
sizg {market-place) which surrounded this 
monumental complex and was built in such 
a way as to respect both the plan and the 
exigencies of the terrain? What precedent

was there for the immense public area 
which, in ‘Umar’s day, could hold 4,000 
horses? Every trace, every scrap of infor- 
mation must be examined if the impetus 
that gave rise to the founding of this and 
other Islamic cities is to be understood. We 
must scrutinize everything that scholarly 
erudition and comparative research can 
reveal about that matrix of urban con- 
struction which is Kafah. 
Kufah marked the advent of Islam the 
mediator, the inheritor, the innovator. The 
city itself was heir to a rich legacy, drawing 
much from Babylon, the Mesopotamian, 
oriental model, and from the cultural 
heritage preserved in the twin city of 
Seleucia on the Tigris/Ctesiphon, the Par- 
thian capital. As in these cities, the central 
palace-mosque complex was a distinctive 
feature, a veritable urban unit; however, in 
Kuafah this central unit never became an 
isolated citadel as in Babylon, or later, in 
Baghdad (Iraq), the circular city of the 
‘Abbasids. If in later cities the palace was

moved to the outskirts, the mosque and the 
market remained where they were, surviv- 
ing all transformations, specific and unvary- 
ing in location and status, the symbol of 
centrality, the heart of the city. 
Another heritage, another choice! Could 
the Greek or Hellenistic city have influ- 
enced Kiifah? The Greeks and the Romans 
built their standard pattern cities in their 
colonies, just as the Arabs built theirs on 
the borders of Arabia. It is difficult to detect 
any evidence of influence from this quarter. 
Greeks, Romans and Arabs each assimil- 
ated and enriched foreign traditions, as 
does any “torch-bearing” civilization. 
The first Kafah was destroyed by fire, 
perhaps because its builders had not suffi- 
ciently respected local environmental con- 
ditions. Those who rebuilt the city learned 
from their first urban venture in the condi- 
tions of a new land, drawing inspiration 
from their patrimony of ideas, but building 
on the basis of their experience of their 
surroundings. Legatees like the Persians,

synthesizers like the Romans, the Arabs 
were also innovators both in that, for them, 
the act of founding a city was the outcome of 
a reasoned project, and that in erecting a 
structure they drew on the traditions of the 
Arab city and on their own Arabian culture. 
The Arabs had, indeed, experienced city 
life long before they founded cities. In 
founding Kafah they had behind them a 
wealth of experience gained, it would seem, 
in the north of the Arabian Peninsula. Long 
before the coming of Islam, perhaps before 
the development of written Arabic, 
cuneiform inscriptions bear witness to the 
existence of a whole Arab culture. This 
ancient identity reached its zenith during 
the first three centuries of Islam under the 
enlightened impulsion of a universal faith 
which led to the creation of cities, of a State, 
of an Empire. Thus Arabism, in a non-tribal 
sense, became co-extensive with Islam, 
vehicle of universality. 
The identification of Arabs with nomad- 
ism, so marked in the writings of the great 
  
  
A 
 
Arab historian Ibn Khaldan, is a com- 
paratively late phenomenon. Were the 
-Arabs formerly a sedentary people who 
became nomads by accident? The answer is 
a definite yes. For the Arabs, then, the city 
is perhaps an environment regained which 
became more and more clearly defined as 
the Islamic era approached. With the 
advent of Islam the Arabs found their his- 
toric destiny as builders and citizens. “On 
the whole,” wrote the French Islamist 
William Margais, “the spread of Islam ... 
found its expression ... in an extension of 
urban life.” However, the Arabs’ cultural 
background and bedouin roots, strength- 
ened by proximity to the desert-refuge, 
gave them a spirit of resistance, a marginal 
quality which left them open to the appeal 
of nomadism, of a way of life more in tune 
with nature than with culture. They

remained the greatest romantics of history 
with a throbbing, irrepressible nostalgia 
for, and innate identification with, the spirit 
of nomadism. 
Thus it was through Islam, revealed as it 
was in an urban setting, that the Arabs were 
able to fulfil their destiny as citizens. This 
they accomplished all the more easily, defi- 
nitively, thanks to the examples of at-Ta’if 
(in what is now Saudi Arabia), Yathrib 
(pre-Islamic Medina) and Mecca. These 
men, who had become nomads, knew that 
the city too could defend itself, have its 
share of culture, and be the symbol of unity. 
The city, arising from some inner well- 
spring of Arabism, was the fruit of the ter- 
ritorializing activities {paradoxical in these 
nomads-by-accident who had become 
nomads by temperament) of the tribes for 
whom the city at times became the site and 
primary source of innovation and the focus 
of the urge to come together and to unite. 
Kifah, then, drew on skills from many 
sources, including those of the Yemen 
which had already been tested out in the 
Hejaz region in the heart of the Arabian 
Peninsula, as witness the jabbanat (tribal 
burial grounds) and the dir (houses) of the 
nobles. Mecca provided a model of the 
notion of the centre and of its pre-emi- 
nence. Even the marking out of the centre 
of- Kafah by means of arrows was a 
memento of the ritual involving arrows 
practised in Mecca. More than this, the 
notion of founding the city, of urban plan- 
ning, drew its inspiration and took as its 
model the actions of Ibn Kilab Qussayy (a 
Sth-century prince of Mecca), ancestor, 
builder, town-planner and architect. 
At-Ta'if, too, provided another urban 
model with its fortifications and city walls. 
Finally, Medina offered the first example of . 
atwin central complex withits juxtaposition 
of the house of power and the house of God, 
although, in the time of the Prophet, 
authority was exercised from the mosque 
itself. 
It was only when the lessons of all these 
models had been fully assimilated that the 
new Islamic city arose on the fringes of the 
desert. More than a polis (city), it was a - 
politeia (a whole social and political order). 
It was a focal point at which life gathered 
and then radiated outwards, flowing along 
its streets and avenues. It encompassed the 
areas earmarked for each tribe where they 
could build their dwellings. Above all, it 
was organized to meet economic needs, 
withsites allocated to economic activity, the 
siigs which were a direct reminder of 
Medina where the Messenger of God had 
himself organized them, separating com- 
merce from prayer, market from mosque, 
thus putting an end to the traditional, age- 
old, oriental muddle. It was by this action 
that the sig, until then a sort of fair, became 
a distinctive feature of urban life. 
All this is a far cry from the sententious 
pronouncements of Orientalists anxious to 
demonstrate, by their assessments of the 
Islamic city, that the city in the full sense of 
the term is really an exclusively European 
phenomenon. How can’ Kifah, with its 
planned space, its urban sub-units, its politi- 
cal and religious centre, its well laid out 
avenues and streets, be considered a hap-

hazard construction? One should talk 
rather in terms of an overall master-plan. 
The rationale is so profound, especially in 
the harmony achieved between human and 
institutional needs, that the original outline 
long remained, despite the later separation 
of vocational and functional institutions, so 
evident in the palace-city: “A universe of 
courtyards, houses, public baths and 
strange doorways, decorated in an extraor- 
dinarily rich style [such as] appeared in the 
tale of “The City of Copper’ from The Thou- 
sand and One Nights.” |

### 74919: Fighting words: the myth of the 'hereditary enemy'

Fighting words 
The myth of the ‘hereditary enemy’ 
sion”,! Elias Canetti (Nobel Prize 
for Literature, 1981) quotes an 
anonymous author who wrote, a week 
before the outbreak of the Second World 
War: “... everything is over. If I were 
really a writer, I would have to be able to 
prevent the war!” 
Canetti’s immediate response is not 
unlike my own reaction and that of many 
others to the Slovene P.E.N. Centre’s 
proposal to create a “writers for peace” 
committee: “an example of the blustering 
that has discredited the word writer and 
filled us with mistrust as soon as a mem- 
ber of the guild beats his breast and comes 
out with his colossal intentions.” 
But Canetti then has second thoughts 
and causes me to follow suit. In the sad- 
ness of the poet’s statement, in its admis- 
sion of failure, there is the affirmation of 
a responsibility the sincerity of which can- 
not be doubted. Canetti admits that a 
situation in which war becomes inevitable 
can be created through “words, deliber- 
ate and used over and over again, mis- 
used words”, and then goes on to ask: “If 
words can do so much—why cannot 
words hinder it [war]?” And he adds— 
and here too I think he is speaking 
directly to us writers—*“It is not at all 
surprising that a man who deals with 
words more than other people do will also 
expect more of words and their effect.” 
Of course wars have always originated 
in conflicts of interest. However, even 
this statement of the obvious should be 
analysed, since the term interest is as fath- 
omless as life itself. Was it really in the 
best interests of the Greeks to send their 
heroes en masse to sack Troy and retrieve 
Helen, even if the beauty of the princess 
should be seen as an image for strategic 
positions and trade monopolies? Can 
there be any doubt that he who argues 
most eloquently and persuasively will 
always win his case? 
I his essay “The Writer's Profes- 
1. “The Writer's Profession”. in The Conscience of 
Words by Elias Canctti. translated from German by 
Joachim Ncugroschel, André Deutsch. London, 1986.

The logo of International P.E.N. (Poets and 
Playwrights, Essayists and Editors, and 
Novelists), a world association of writers 
founded in London in 1921, which today 
has over 10,000 members from all conti- 
nents and around 90 centres worldwide. 
More recent events demonstrate that 
“interests” are not necessarily related to 
obvious factors. I have never been able to 
get anyone to explain where the interests 
of William II’s Germany lay in the First 
World War, of which it was to a large 
extent the cause and architect, although I 
have been assured that competition 
between German and Serbian pork had 
something to do with it. 
Who would ever agree to lay down his 
life for a pig or to sell more pork? Sub- 
stitute gold, oil, roads or rivers for this 
perhaps unjustly despised animal, and 
the question remains just as scandalous. 
To mask interests, to present them in 
such a way that they appear vital and that 
people will agree to risk their lives to 
defend them, a vast operation of verbal 
camouflage is needed to transform reality 
into emotion, passion, enthusiasm. Such 
a task calls for the gifts of the poet and 
writer. 
Wars have always been preceded by 
vast battalions of words. As writers, we 
have a nebulous influence over the vested 
interests that lie at the root of conflicts, 
but over the battalions of words which 
precede, mask and transfigure these

interests,” reads the caption to this car- 
toon published during the First World War 
in a 1915 issue of the Italian newspaper 
Avanti. 
by Jean Blot 
interests, our control is direct, our 
responsibility is great. It is all the greater 
since in the past our talents have often 
been used in the interests of belligerence. 
War precedes peace in the sense that the 
fear that underlies it and of which itis the 
projection and the theatre precedes cour- 
age. In the infancy of the species and of 
the individual, the stranger immediately 
inspires dread. The poet and writer is a 
child of depths and origins. He is most at 
home on very ancient ground. Myth suits 
us better than enlightenment. 
If vested interests must wear a mask in 
order to arm and deceive those who serve 
them, their first ally will be the atavistic 
fear of the other, of the stranger. Those 
who serve such interests will mobilize this 
archaic fear and direct it along lines which 
suit them. Since experience alone shows 
that the world is habitable, the unknown 
is felt as a threat. 
We thought men were white. But 
here’s someone who is yellow or black. 
We thought men were small and thin. But 
here’s someone who's tall and fat. We 
thought men had turned-up noses. Here’s 
someone with an aquiline nose. This 
hooked nose, this belly, this stature, this 
swarthy skin are bound to mean trouble 
for me, since, in my inexperience, they

frighten me! From my fear I project the 
evil they have in store for me. 
And what’s more, these nightmarish 
creatures, whom later, slightly reassured, 
I shall regard as caricatures of humanity, 
speak no human language. Can these 
grunts really be a language? And if they 
do attempt to speak in human language, 
by which I mean the language that I speak 
and understand, they violate, deform and 
destroy it. In the violence they inflict on 
my language I see the hatred which moti- 
vates them and which they will soon be 
venting on me. Thus in Balzac there are 
whole pages of mimicry of Jewish or Ger- 
man accents; they are not crimes but per- 
haps they should be considered as 
offences of war and racism. The person is 
hated through his accent, and through 
him the human group to which he 
belongs. 
Body, language, accent. Every custom 
or habit is impregnated with values con- 
sciously or unconsciously held. These val- 
ues express and sustain the identity of the 
group and the individual who belongs to 
it. Who am I but a man who does not eat 
pork? If another man eats pork in my 
presence, is he trying to show me his iden- 
tity or to attack mine? It boils down to the 
same thing. For the wine drinker, the 
beer drinker is suspect. Eating habits are 
rooted in the depths of the psyche. 
The English reputation for coldness 
owes much to the fact that English people 
only shake hands on exceptional occa- 
sions; the French reputation for sensual 
or sexual excess to the fact that the 
French kiss in the street. All these factors 
and many more will be taken up by vested 
interests when they need to mobilize one 
group against another, to describe an 
enemy who is both frightful and des- 
picable since everything about him 
—what he drinks, eats, his clothing, his 
behaviour—proves that he does not 
belong to humanity. 
So far I have only spoken of inex- 
perience. We should not forget the 
manipulation of experience. For cen- 
turies, in a relatively stabilized world, 
peoples have lived side by side, but pro- 
foundly isolated by mutual incomprehen- 
sion of their respective languages, 
customs and values. Each conflict, in 
spite of the disappointment bred by its 
outcome, almost as great among the vic- 
tors as among the vanquished, in spite of 
the immediately evident absurdity of its 
result, prepares and heralds the next. 
Experience confirms my obscure intui- 
tion that the stranger is dangerous. I 
thought I had unmasked an assassin. And 
that’s exactly what he is. My share in the 
crime is all the more quickly forgotten, if 
~it is not concealed, since the people 
around me, starting with writers and 
poets, are talking only of heroism. They 
will translate vague intuitions into words, 
images and verses, and populate the 
unconscious with the features of the 
hereditary enemy. If I have doubts, I shall 
find certainty in their work. 
If we writers have done much to create 
the hereditary enemy and exclude him 
from humanity, to prove that he kills and 
to justify killing him, we can do as much 
to destroy the myth. Itis up to us, and we 
alone possess this power, to make the 
stranger a familiar figure, to eradicate the 
fear which he naturally provokes. 
The process of identification dear to 
“the novelist is of great importance here. It 
1s for us to reveal the hereditary or poten- 
tial enemy from the inside, as if we were 
what he is. Isit really possible, on reading 
Tolstoy, to believe for a second that a 
Russian only removes the dagger from 
between his teeth when he wants to 
knock back a glass of vodka? That a Ger-

“Can there be any doubt that he who 
argues most eloquently and persuasively 
will always win his case?” Above, public 
meeting in Paris, 1954. 
“If we writers have done much to create the

destroy the myth.” Left, Fight with Sticks, a

cisco Goya (1746-1828). 
man is nothing but beer, sausage and bay- 
onets when we read Werther or Elective 
Affinities? The literatures of countries 
other than our own can play an immense 
role; it is our duty to make them better 
known. The conflicts which divide us 
doubtless remain. But they have become 
human conflicts to which human solu- 
tions must be found. 
The role played by our own literatures 
is even more important. Norman Mailer’s 
novel The Naked and the Dead enabled 
me to imagine for the first time what it 
was like to be a young Japanese during 
the war in the Pacific. The Lover, by the 
Israeli writer Abraham B. Yehoshua, 
gave me an idea of the feelings a young 
Arab could have about the Israeli 
bourgeoisie. 
But so far I have only discussed the 
simplest issue, the type of conflict which 
we rightly think of as belonging to the 
past. Modern wars, whether local or the 
total war which we dare not even imag- 
ine, have or will have different founda- 
    
tions: racial wars, class wars, ideological 
wars, Today it is easy to reconcile the 
French and the Germans, the British and 
the Americans. We only talk so openly 
because the divisions between them are a 
thing of the past. But who will dare 
explain the Capitalist to the Bolshevik, 
the proletarian to the bourgeois, and vice 
versa? Who will dare proclaim, in the 
conflict that divides them, their opposing 
and equal humanity? The one excludes 
the other from humanity. It is behind this 
verbal mirage that the reality of war 
announces itself. An impossible task, 
perhaps. But if we refuse to shoulder it, 
we can no longer talk of writers for peace. 
Let us begin with the basic issues. Paci- 
fists and non-pacifists both wish for 
peace. It is only the ways and means of 
maintaining peace that divide them. 
Some consider that peace can only be 
assured by a balance of weaponry. Others 
are in favour of a calculated risk and 
believe that partial disarmament in a sit- 
uation of overarmament may bring about

a general movement of which peace, and 
all peoples, will be the beneficiaries. The 
choice of means divides them, but the 
goal is the same. This must be proclaimed 
time and time again. 
It would be a mistake to forget that the 
unanimous clamour for peace is a recent 
phenomenon. Elias Canetti has pointed 
out that humanity must fear the experi- 
ences that it has not yet had, the setbacks 
it has not yet faced. He suggests that it is 
easier today to exterminate an entire 
population than it is to burn a single per- 
son on a fire in a public place. This is why 
the apocalyptic experience of Hiroshima 
and Nagasaki should not be forgotten. 
There is another instinct, the instinct of 
the survival of the species. It has 
awakened, it reveals itself in a way which 
is often confused and odious. We must

listen to it, express its mystery, capture 
this spring of hope where it rises in the 
depths of night, and use it to irrigate our 
works and our inspiration. Other inclina- 
tions which come naturally to writers are 
favourable to our project. War is only 
possible in the abstract. It is for writers to 
depict the horrors of war as concretely as 
possible and to see that they are not con- 
cealed. Another natural inclination 
comes to our aid. Men and women of 
sensibility, we take more pleasure than 
most in diversity. This delight in the 
diversity and wealth of the human species 
should be captured and communicated in 
a spate of joy which will soon wash fear 
away. [|

### 74921: Society and the disabled

Society and the disabled 
since 1981, the International Year of Dis- 
abled Persons, the integration of dis- 
abled young people into the ordinary educa- 
tion system has become widely accepted and 
is now a prominent goal of educational plan- 
ning in many countries. 
This undeniable change in attitudes and 
behaviour towards disabled people is playing 
an essential role in their integration into work- 
ing life and into the societies to which they 
belong. This integration is based on the fun- 
damental principles of equality of access to 
education and the full participation of all per- 
sons, including the disabled, in social life and 
in national development. It is one of the objec- 
tives of the World Programme of Action con- 
cerning Disabled Persons which was adopted 
by the General Assembly of the United Na- 
tions in 1982, Unesco is co-operating with 
other specialized agencies of the United Na- 
tions system in implementing the Programme, 
which was included in Unesco’'s Second 
Medium-Term Plan (1984-1989). The integra- 
tion of disabled young people into ordinary 
schooling is already being carried out in many 
Unesco Member States on a long-term basis, 
to the benefit of both the disabled themselves 
and of the education systems in these coun- 
tries, which thereby become more flexible. 
Integration contributes to the acceptance of 
“differences”, promotes mutual tolerance and 
respect and encourages the democratization 
of education. 
The concept of “handicap” has been great- 
ly modified in the last two decades. It is now 
distinguished from that of “impairment” or 
“disability” and is defined as a disadvantage 
for a given individual, resulting from an impair- 
ment or a disability, that limits or prevents the 
fulfiiment of a role that is normal, depending 
on age, sex, social and cultural factors, for 
that individual. Handicap is therefore a func- 
tion of the relationship between disabled per- 
sons and their environment. It occurs when 
they encounter cultural, physical or social bar- 
riers which prevent their access to the various 
systems of society that are available to others. 
Thus, handicap is the loss or limitation of 
opportunities to take part in the life of the 
community on an equal level with others. 
This new concept of what it means to be 
handicapped highlights the relative nature of 
differences between the performances or sta- 
tus of disabled people and those of others, 
I: the last twenty years and especially and draws attention to the fact that these gaps 
may be reduced, if not removed, by appropri- 
ate action on the disabled person’s physical, 
psychological, educational and social en- 
vironment, and by measures to make him or 
her as self-reliant as possible. 
From an educational point of view, the in- 
tegration of disabled people requires specific 
measures, and above all that account should 
be taken of the special situation of each hand- 
icapped child or adolescent. The nature and 
importance of the disability should be eva- 
luated, along with the possibilities of educa- 
tion and of developing” individual aptitudes, 
following the strategy best adapted to each 
case. The breaking down of barriers within

institutions, the setting up of multi-disciplinary 
educational teams and the use of varied 
teaching methods are required. 
Integration into ordinary education takes 
different forms in different countries, some- 
times even within the same country, depend- 
ing on requirements and on the facilities 
available. Nevertheless all these forms are a 
response to the same overriding concern: to 
encourage the development of each child's 
personality and to ensure his or her eventual 
integration into adult society. In the article 
overleaf, a specialist describes the integration 
process in Portuguese schools today and pre- 
sents in their own words the testimony of two 
visually handicapped children. 
The integration of disabled children into the ordinary education system is a goal being 
pursued in many countries. Alia Zureikat, a young Jordanian girl afflicted with cerebral 
palsy, attends an ordinary school in Amman. According to her teachers, Alia, here seen 
holding her younger brother in her arms, is a highly motivated and enthusiastic pupil 
whose level in some subjects is higher than the class average.

### 74922: Breaking down the barriers for visually handicapped children

Breaking down the barriers 
for visually handicapped children 
30 
  
visually handicapped children and young 
people in schools forming part of the ordi- 
nary education system is today the policy of the 
Special Teaching Division of the Portuguese 
Ministry of Education and Culture, which is 
responsible for the education of the disabled. 
Since the beginning of the 1970s, the Division 
has followed the lead taken by other countries, 
notably the United States. 
As a result, blind and amblyopic! children who 
were formerly educated in private institutions or 
boarding schools (where State intervention was 
minimal), cut off from society and separated from 
their families, now have an opportunity to attend 
ordinary schools. 
The first step in this direction was the creation 
of salas de apoio, or support classes, in primary 
and secondary schools in the main cities of Por- 
tugal. In these cities were the boarding establish- 
ments where the blind and amblyopic pupils 
completed four years’ primary education before 
entering the secondary schools where support 
classes had been created. They continued to live 
either in the boarding schools or at home. The 
support classes were staffed by specialized 
teachers who provided pupils and subject teach- 
ers with teaching materials and advice on 
changes in the curricula necessary to cater for 
the type and degree of disability suffered by each 
pupil. 
TT social and educational integration of

change in the eye structures. Editor. 
  
However, this system soon proved to be inad- 
equate. The support classes were few, and the 
numbers of visually handicapped pupils in them 
constantly increased until they came to form 
“colonies” within the schools. The visually hand- 
icapped young people stuck together and sel- 
dom mixed with the other pupils during recrea- 
tion periods or in their free time. There was no 
real social integration. 
Moreover, in order to attend these secondary 
schools, pupils from other cities and from rural 
areas had to be separated from their families and 
friends. When these pupils returned home after 
completing their studies, they were treated as 
outsiders. They felt uprooted; they had no 
friends; they had lost touch with their community 
and had great difficulty in fitting back into it. Many 
of them, especially those from rural areas, 
refused to return. They could not face the pros- 
pect of going back to the humble homes where 
they had been born and living among those 
whose culture and habits were now quite dif- 
ferent from their own. 
One pupil from a village once said something 
which shocked me and impelled me to do all | 
could to change the system. “You bring us here,” 
he said, “to turn us into birds with clipped 
wings.” 
It was urgent to solve the problems stemming 
from the young peoples’ isolation from their fam- 
ilies and from society. This could only be done by 
creating the conditions for “full-scale integra- 
tion”, so that visually handicapped pupils could 
go on living with their families in their home

environment and attend local schools like other 
children and teenagers, use the same public 
transport facilities, play the same games, and 
experience the same pleasures and the same 
problems—in short, be a part of the community. 
After the necessary legislation had been pre- 
pared, it soon became clear that legislation in 
itself was not enough. A much more difficult 
problem had arisen. It would be necessary to 
change the attitudes of teachers who, through 
feelings of uncertainty or mistrust, through preju- 
dice or because they were unwilling to put them- 
selves out, refused to accept visually handicap- 
ped pupils or, when they did, left them on the 
sidelines. 
This was the mid-1970s, and the struggle was 
a hard one. Today, with few exceptions to the 
general rule, the integration of the visually hand- 
icapped in Portugal can be said to have become 
a reality. 
Today pupils are integrated into ordinary 
schools as early as possible, and are provided 
with support from specialized teachers. Each 
pupil can be given back-up teaching two or three 
times a week, depending on the gravity of the 
handicap and the level of instruction. The teach- 
ers periodically advise the parents about their, 
children's education and other activities that may 
contribute to their balanced development. They 
also alert parents about the need for regular 
medical attention. 
We cannot claim that everything is perfect: 
indeed, we are only too aware of our limitations, 
including a shortage of specialized teachers, the

lack of facilities to produce teaching materials, 
and lack of funds to purchase better equipment. 
However, we believe that it was necessary to 
choose the lesser evil, and the sheer pleasure of 
seeing our children and young people grow up 
within their families, be accepted by their fellow 
pupils, display the same abilities and the same 
limitations, and become fully-fledged members 
of the community, strengthens our conviction 
that we are on the right track. 
Boarding schools and special! schools have 
not disappeared. They will continue to exist, 
especially for the more severe cases of multiple 
disablement calling for more constant attention 
and the use of a wider range of techniques. 
These establishments are working with the sup- 
port teachers in the integrated education system 
on developing training methods and organizing 
vacation courses. 
The following remarks illustrate how the 
approaches described above have affected the 
lives of two visually handicapped Portuguese 
children who are integrated into schools in the 
ordinary education system. 
Catia Susana was born with severe malforma- 
tions in both eyes involving the degeneration of 
the iris and the cornea. At the present time, she 
can just about perceive the light. She lives with 
her parents and elder brother in Santarem, a 
town some 90 kilometres from Lisbon. At three 
years of age, she attended nursery school just 
like any other child and at six went on to the 
primary school in the area where she lives. She 
is now in her third year and was nine years old in 
June. Itis clear that she is fully integrated into the 
school from the way she talks about it and her 
friends: 
“The teacher is good and amusing and 
teaches well. She is kind, but since I'm a chatter- 
box she is always telling me to be quiet. She has 
separated me from the others, but she has put 
me next to a boy called Rodrigo, and we are

always talking to each other. | read to him what | 
have written and we talk about all sorts of things. 
“I learned typing in my second year, so as to 
be able to write without seeing. | already know 
how to type, but | can also write in Braille. 
“I go to school with my mother, but | some- 
times go on my own, with my stick. | know the 
area well and when | go down the street, | guide 
myself by the curve of the houses. In the after- 
noon, when | come out of school, | go home with 
my girlfriends and we play with dolls, or else | 
read my stories to them until my mother comes. 
At other times, 1 go to a local shop where there is 
a little dog | like very much, and | also go to visit 
my old nurse. | don’t go out at rush-hours, but if { 
am a bit late, | ask somebody to help me cross 
the street.” 
Catia’s parents have learnt to accept her dis- 
ability and lavish affection on her, without show- 
ing either overprotectiveness cr rejection. 
Catia's intellectual development is superior to 
the norm for her age, perhaps because she has 
always received encouragement. Her mother 
says, "When she was very young, | tried to teach 
her by reading her all the stories | could lay my 
hands on and by giving her detailed descriptions 
of illustrations in the books." This may explain 
Catia's enthusiasm for reading and writing. 
She says: “My favourite subject is Portuguese 
language and then grammar. ... | write whenever 
| can, both at school and at home, in prose or in 
verse, depending on my mood." Her mother 
says: “Reading is her world,” to which Catia 
adds: “Books make my mouth water because 
there are so many marvellous stories to read.” 
Catia spends her free time with her parents 
and with other friends of her age, goes to the 
beach or on walks, or stays at home reading, 
writing or playing with her dolls. She also goes 
swimming and has already had music lessons. 
She began by being very enthusiastic because 
she was very fond of music, but she ended up by 
losing interest in the lessons because “the 
teacher was too demanding”. Catia is a very 
determined child: she is a perfectionist and 
hence she loses interest in anything that she 
cannot succeed at right from the start. What 
more could be expected of a nine-year-old 
child? 
| asked her to think of a message for children 
all over the world. She pondered for a moment 
and then wrote the following words: “THE SUN. 
When the sun shines brightly, it makes the blond 
hair of some children shine too, like the coins 
they need to live. The sun is a playful figure who 
gives life to all children and all hearts and brings 
them together, whether they are red, white, black 
or yellow. In every country, if the sun shines, then 
hearts, hands and arms join together to turn the 
world’s children into flowers that will form great 
clusters of love and friendship.” 
Renato Jorge is totally blind. His premature 
birth and very low birth weight account for the 
many health problems he had in his early years. 
He lives near Lisbon with his parents and grand- 
parents. He is now twelve years old and is in his 
sixth year at the Vasco da Gama de Melecas 
college. He is a happy, high-spirited child who 
expresses himself easily and precisely. 
“Before | came to the college, | was at three 
other schools. The first of these was rightly called 
the ‘Inicio’ (the ‘Beginning’). I only stayed there a 
month because | still felt very ill and it was hard 
for me to be away from my parents. | had prob- 
lems fitting in. Then ! spent a year with my grand- 
mother, but my parents dropped in to see me 
whenever they could. When | was four, | went to 
the A-da-Beja school for two years. From then 
onwards | remember things better. 
“When | was six, | went to the Antonio Feli- 
ciano de Castilho Institute in Lisbon, whichwas a 
school for children and young people with eye- 
sight problems. The teachers and my school- 
friends were very good to me and really helped

me to ‘grow’ because | was very frail and back- 
ward. At the Institute, | had two women teachers 
who were not only kind to me but were very good 
atteaching, and aroused my interestin lessons. | 
spent a lot of time playing with my friends and 
those who could still see and those who were 
blind used to play tricks on one another. 
“My mother took me to schoo! every morning 
and collected me every afternoon. There were 
fewer people at the Institute than at the college 
where | am now. It was a tamily affair, whereas 
my present school is very large. That is the only 
difference between them, since both of them are 
equally good. I feel happy in the college where | 
am now. | like everything about it. The curriculum 
is well organized and | like the way the teachers 
treat me. 
“I responded at once to the very first lessons 
because the teachers, who had never had a blind 
person in their classes before, taught me just like 
the pupils who had their sight. | have never felt 
that they make the slightest distinction between 
me and the others. When they write on the black- 
board, they dictate out loud what they are writing 
and so1 have no problem in taking notes. | enjoy 
all subjects, although | have more difficulties with 
visual education. However, the teacher makes 
adjustments when there are things in the curricu- 
lum that | cannot cope with. My favourite subjects 
are history and natural science. | have always 
been fond of history because | like to understand 
why we have reached our present situation, 
good or bad. 
“My schoolfriends are very nice. Whenever 
somebody has a birthday, he invites the others. 
A great idea! In my free time, | do judo, take 
music lessons and go on bicycle rides. | have 
also done some horse-riding. | had to drop it 
because | did not have enough time, but plan to 
take it up again. At weekends or during the long 
vacation, | go out with my parents and friends. | 
have many friends: of my own age with whom | 
can play, but | also very much like talking to older 
people because | am always trying to improve 
my Portuguese and acquire more knowledge. 
They can teach me the things they have learnt 
from their own experience. 
“At home, | help my mother to dust the house 
and my father to mend the fence or the cart if 
necessary.” 
Renato made this long statement almost with- 
out a break, displaying admirable self-assurance 
and equanimity. Whenever he referred to his 
parents or to other members of his family, he did 
so with great affection and with a smile on his 
lips. My final question was whether he too would 
like to send a message to other young people. 
He replied without hesitation as follows: 
“I should like to say to the readers of this article 
that if they are disabled, or if they have children 
who are disabled, they should take life as it 
comes, as | do. If they do that, they may succeed 
in overcoming their problems more easily. That 
is my family’s motto and we have had plenty of 
problems to contend with.” 
That is the message of courage and hope 
which visually handicapped Portuguese young 
people wish to address to the world, By their 
example, these young people teach us to face 
lite with optimism and to fight for our ideals. =

### 74923: Vuk Stefanovic Karadzic: profile of a great scholar

Profile of a great scholar 
The bicentenary of the birth of the Serbian writer and 
ver 
scholar Vuk Stefanovi¢ Karadzié, who made an out- 
standing contribution to the culture of Yugoslavia, is 
being celebrated as an occasion of international sig- 
nificance on 6 November 1987. To honour the memory 
of this great figure, we publish below an account of his 
‘life and achievements together with short extracts 
from his works. 
great reformer of the Serbian lan- 
guage and spelling system, founder 
of Serbian Romanticism, linguist, eth- 
nographer and historian, KaradZi¢ played a 
pioneering role in the cultural history of 
Yugoslavia. 
Born into a farming family at Tr3i¢ (Ser- 
bia) in 1787, he attended local schools but 
was largely self-taught. In 1813 he took 
refuge in Vienna and lived there, except for 
a few short absences, until his death in 
1864. 
In Vienna he met a Slovene scholar, 
Jernej Kopitar, who encouraged him and 
introduced him to such leading European 
writers and thinkers as Johann Wolfgang 
von Goethe, Jacob Grimm, Leopold von 
Ranke and Friedrich Engels. Karadzi¢’s 
first collection of epic poems, published in 
1814, brought him to the attention of an 
Fe of Serbo-Croat literature, educated readership. In addition to his 
many other activities, he devoted his life to 
the collection and publication of works 
from the Serbian oral literary tradition, 
notably in “Serbian Folk Tales” (1821), 
“Serbian Folk Sayings” (1836) and, above 
all, the multi-volume “Serbian Epic Poems” 
(1814-1866). 
His efforts to record and preserve the 
treasures of oral literature formed part of 
his struggle to gain acceptance for the spo- 
ken language as the language of literary 
expression, and to create an alphabet which 
would be adapted to Serbian phonetics and 
would obey his dictum: “Write as you 
speak, read as it is written.” KaradZié sim- 
plified the spelling system so that each 
sound corresponded to a single letter, 
finally devising an alphabet of thirty letters 
that is one of the most scientific and logical 
in the world today.

### 74923: Vuk Stefanovic Karadzic: profile of a great scholar

His linguistic works include the first Ser- 
_ bian grammar—which was reviewed by 
Goethe—and a “Serbian Lexicon” (1818), a 
Serbo-Germanic-Latin dictionary which 
did full justice to the rich vocabulary of 
popular speech. The second edition (1852, 
reprinted in 1934) remains a classic 
reference work. 
The translation of the New Testament 
into the popular idiom that Karadzi¢ com- 
pleted in 1847 laid the foundations of the 
Serbo-Croat language, which was to 
become the common tongue of the Serbs 
and the Croats. 
Karadzi¢ was a revolutionary figure who 
sought to bring about the political and spir- 
itual awakening of his people through 
books. As well as his efforts to create a 
national language and a new spelling sys- 
tem, he produced a body of historical and 
ethnographic works, which, especially in his 
“The Serbian Revolution” (1829) and 
“Montenegro and the Montenegrins” 
(1837), are dominated by his realistic vision 
of social relationships and by his sense of 
perspective. 
During his lifetime Karadzi¢ achieved a 
European reputation. In 1823 he was the 
guest of Jacob Grimm in Kassel and of 
Goethe in Weimar; the same year he 
received an honorary doctorate from the 
University of Jena. In 1824 he became a 
member of the Turin Society for Antiquities 
and, in 1825, of the Géttingen Learned 
Society. In 1842 he was awarded a gold 
medal for his scholarship and literary 
achievements by the Russian Academy of 
Sciences. He became a corresponding 
member of the Viennese Academy in 1848, 
the Berlin Academy in 1850 and the St. 
Petersburg Academy in 1851. He was 
also a corresponding member of the Paris- 
based African League for Combat Against 
Slavery. 
Karadzi¢ owes his greatness not only to 
the originality of his ideas and the tenacity 
with which he expressed them, but also to 
the links he made between the traditions of 
his people and international culture: as a 
thinker he made a major contribution to the 
spiritual unity of mankind. |

(Preface to the “Serbian Grammar”, 1814) 
As long as the spoken word of the people is 
pure and unaltered, literary language 
should not be distinct from the language of 
the people. Why should it be different? 
Don’t we see people in our time discarding 
the literary language of the past in order to 
write in the language of the people as it is 
today? ... Please God that we should be 
able to write books in the way that the peo- 
ple speak ...

will be appreciated by all our writers and 
authors who love the language of the people

sion of the people, for whom they wish hap- 
piness and progress. On the other hand, I 
have not tried to please those who, while 
speaking the Serbian language, heap abuse 
on it and claim that it is worthless and no 
more than a tainted language, the speech of 
swineherds and horse-traders. 
The greatest outcry will be raised against 
the spelling system. But here too I hope that 
all our writers will be on my side, all those 
who are familiar with language and writing. 
And they will see that this is the most appro- 
priate way to write the Serbian language. 
(Preface to the “Serbian Lexicon”, 1818) 
A man with nothing else to do could easily 
devote his whole life to bringing together all 
our folksongs, our stories, our tales, our 
riddles, our customs and our words. And 
when he came to think he had finished the 
task, he would see that he was only just 
starting. ... These works of folk art must be 
collected before they are altered or even 
stifled by new, more “enlightened” 
fashions. 
Songs, riddles, folktales, these are a highly 
accomplished form of popular literature, to 
which there is nothing to add. They should

simply be collected and their purity should 
be scrupulously respected. And when tran- 
scribing these tales, it is certainly advisable 
to think of the construction of the words 
(not, I repeat, according to one’s own taste, 
but following the genius of the Serbian lan- 
guage) so as to avoid any form of excess, 
and to'succeed in such a way that cultivated 
souls can read them and uneducated folk 
can listen to them ... 
(Preface to “Serbian Folk Tales”, 1821) 
Our folksongs can all be divided into epic 
poems, sung to the accompaniment of the 
guzla, and women’s songs, sung by women 
and girls but also by men, most often youths 
singing in unison. More than the women’s 
songs, the epic poems are intended for a 
public, hence the utmost importance of 
their text. 
(Preface to “Serbian Epic Poems”, 1824) 
Our Serbian folksongs do not come from 
parchment manuscripts, they were col- 
lected from the warm lips of the people; 
they are not old because they have never yet 
been recorded in writing, but they will cer- 
tainly live to a ripe old age ... 
Jacob Grimm 
(Review of the third volume of “Serbian Epic 
Poems”, 1823) 
Mother and daughter 
Aie, aie, aie, mother, a monk is wakening 
me, 
He is wakening me, kissing my eyelids! 
Must I kiss him, oh my mother? 
Kiss, my daughter, do not be damned! 
When your mother was the same age, 
Before dawn, she had embraced nine, 
And your father, he was the tenth, 
And she had woven three lengths of carpet! 
(Traditional poem collected by Karadzic and 
published in “The Red Duke” [erotic folk 
poems], Prosveta publishers, Belgrade, 1979)

### 74924: A World congress on copyright teaching

34 
A world congress on copyright teaching 
by Yves Gaubiac 
  
NESCO is holding a World Con- 
| | gress on Copyright Teaching and 
. Information in Paris in September 
1987 in order to mark the thirty-fifth anni- 
versary of the Universal Copyright Con- 
vention, which was signed on 6 September 
1952 and the secretariat of which is 
provided by Unesco. 
The theme of the Congress, which is 
directly related to Unesco’s mandate in the 
field of education, has been chosen because 
many infringements of copyright are due to 
lack of information and knowledge. 
The provision of information and educa- 
tion about copyright is an indispensable 
part of any effort to ensure that copyright is 
respected. The idea of literary and artistic 
property is not universally shared. There is 
no basic reflex relating to justice and equity 
for creators. Education and training are 
ne¢eded in order to create this reflex. Once 
incirculation, created works are often seen 
as common property which can be freely 
used. Works should certainly be circulated 
as widely as possible, in order to satisfy 
people's legitimate desire to enjoy the crea- 
tions of the mind. But the use of a work 
without its author’s consent and in the 
absence of any remuneration is harmful to 
creative activity since it deprives authors 
and their rights holders of the financial 
resources necessary to create and invest in 
the production of new works. 
Copyright is recognized in the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights of 10 Decem- 
ber 1948, which states that “Everyone has 
the right to the protection of the moral and 
material interests resulting from any scien- 
tific, literary or artistic production of which 
he is the author”. 
Copyright is now an accepted right. It 
should be more widely known if it is to be 
more widely respected. |
