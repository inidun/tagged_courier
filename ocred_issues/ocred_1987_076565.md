Roller-skating around the Mediterranean 
"Five young roller-skaters with an impressive sporting achieve- 
ment to their credit being welcomed by the Director-General of 
‘Unesco, on their arrival at the Organization’s Paris Head- 
quarters on 9 September 1987. They had set off from Monaco on 
13 July and roller-skated for 5,000 km in the summer heat, along 
often difficult routes through Italy, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, 
Spain and France. They skated some 90 km each day, except for 
one daily stage when they covered 216 km and set a world 
record. This exercise in friendly co-operation between young 
‘people was organized under the auspices of Unesco’s Inter- 
national Fund for the Development of Physical Education and 
Sport (FIDEPS), as the first in a series of international sporting 
and cultural events designed to further the objectives of the

Underwater archaeology, a new scientific

by Nicholas Flemming and Mark Redknap 
Almost forty-five years ago, the French explorer Jacques-Y ves Cousteau 
and the engineer Emile Gagnan invented the aqualung (Scuba), a 
self-contained underwater breathing device, and opened up anew erain 
the exploration of the ocean floor. Before the aqualung, divers were 
weighed down by heavy, cumbersome equipment which severely limited 
their underwater stamina and work capacity. With the aqualung vast 
areas of the sea floor became accessible to human curiosity—to marine 
biologists, to photographers, and to archaeologists. 
Since that time underwater archaeology has made great strides. A 
number of spectacular discoveries, excavations and rescue operations (a 
selection of which are described in this issue) have captured the 
imagination of a wide public. Meanwhile, away from the limelight, great 
progress has been made in the development of underwater archaeology 
as a discipline on a par with land archaeology. This is a science which

knowledge of the past in many ways. Ancient wrecks are “time-capsules” 
which, when scientifically studied, can provide a microcosmic picture of 
life in the civilizations which produced them. On a larger scale, the 
collection, collation and interpretation of a growing mass of data 
accumulated from individual wrecks and underwater sites which are often 
not spectacular in themselves are throwing new light on ancient 
technologies and patterns of trade, changing sea levels, ancient 
settlements and migrations, helping us, in short, to understand human 
use of the sea and lakes over several millennia. 
This issue presents a selection of reports on the activities of underwater 
archaeologists working in different world regions, in different marine 
environments, on different types of site, using different methods, on 
projects of different scales. The reports cover not only investigations of 
marine shipwrecks, but of submerged inland sites, as well as harbours, 
cities and even a vast landmass, now located underwater as a result of 
various kinds of natural occurrences. Finally, two articles reflect 
Unesco’s concern about the protection of archaeological sites and the 
need for action to combat the looting of underwater sites and the growing 
illegal trafficin archaeological treasures.

### 76550: Plunging into the past: underwater archaeology, a new scientific discipline with a wide popular following

Underwater 
archaeology, 
a new scientific 
discipline with a wide 
popular following   
Plunging into 
gy can be traced back to the time, 
about a century ago, when a handful 
of intrepid archaeologists began to use hel- 
met diving methods or employ sponge di- 
vers to look at submerged ruins and wrecks. 
These methods were used on perhaps a 
dozen sites in all until the end of the Second 
World War, when the aqualung, a self- 
contained underwater breathing device in- 
vented by the French explorer Jacques- 
Yves Cousteau and the engineer Emile 
Gagnan, made it possible for scientists and 
explorers to work cheaply and easily in 
waters up to 50 metres deep. 
Hundreds of books and magazine articles 
have now been written about underwater 
archaeology. In particular, in the last thirty 
T HE origins of underwater archaeolo- years a number of underwater excavations 
have received massive publicity (see page 
12). These finds, surveys and excavations 
have been vitally important, and have 
furthered the art and discipline of underwa- 
ter surveying, stratigraphy, and the inter- 
pretation of ancient seafaring. Such major 
wreck excavations which have produced 
well-preserved artefacts form the high 
points of underwater archaeology. 
However, to present another review of 
the high points of the last thirty years might 
suggest that underwater archaeology has 
become intellectually and spiritually dead, 
living off the grandeur of its achievements. 
The truth is that underwater archaeology 
has been spreading like wildfire. There are 
now many thousands of underwater sites

age from 45,000 years to a few decades, 
from Stone Age quarry sites in Tasmania to 
American War of Independence gunboats; 
from the floor of the Mediterranean to 
Alpine lakes and sinkholes in Mexico and 
Florida. Hundreds of professional 
archaeologists spend at least part of their 
time supervising underwater sites, whilst 
thousands of amateur diving archaeologists 
assist the professionals in many dozens of 
countries. 
Many developing countries now support 
scientific work on underwater archaeologic- 
al sites ranging from the seventeenth-cen-

(Kenya), and trade centres dating from the 
ninth to the twelfth century off Malaysia, to

pre-European craft off Korea and 
Thailand, and early ports and wrecks off the 
southeast coast of Sri Lanka (see page 37). 
This increasing awareness of the cultural 
importance of archaeological sites in the 
maritime zone by governments and institu- 
tions is extremely encouraging. 
The vast number of sites which are now 
known provide professional archaeologists 
with vital new opportunities. Whilst the 
sites are not all of equal value, and some are 
mundane, the accumulation of data means 
that experts can search for correlations, 
evolution and trends through time, spatial 
patterns and differences, links and causes. 
Instead of treating artefacts only as objects 
of beauty or technical achievement, the 
archaeologist can start to interpret them as 
parts of culture, trade, economics, politics, 
and patterns of living. Obviously the 
archaeologists working on the earlier ex- 
cavations used comparisons with land sites 
to make such tentative deductions, but the 
sheer accumulation of information now 
means that much more sophisticated analy- 
sis can be attempted on the basis of com- 
parison between underwater sites. 
These vast assemblages of similar under- 
water sites of similar ages mean that we can 
start to understand how peoples and cul- 
tures related to the sea or lakes in each 
millennium and century. That is a grand 
objective. As the number and variety of 
sites has increased, the age barrier has been 
pushed further back in time. 
In the 1950s the earliest known shipwreck 
was the Gelidonya Bronze Age ship at 1200 
BC (some others were earlier than about 
200 BC), and the earliest known harbours 
about 600 BC. The age of ship finds has only 
been pushed a little way back, with the 
discovery in 1982 of the fourteenth-century 
BC ship near Kas off the coast of southern 
Turkey (see page 12), but the number of 
known ships older than 2,200 years has 
increased significantly, filling the gaps. 
The age of known harbours and coastal 
occupation sites has been extended drama- 
tically, first with Bronze Age harbours 
(1500 BC) found in the late 1960s and early 
1970s in Greece and Israel; then with 
Neolithic and Mesolithic settlements 
(5,000-10,000 years old) found in the Baltic, 
and off the coasts of Greece, Turkey, Israel 
and the United States; and most recently 
Palaeolithic artefacts, found in the North 
Sea, and off the coast of France, Italy and 
Greece, ranging in age from 10,000 to 
45,000 years. We are now in a position to 
consider studying the whole sweep of the 
evolution of human culture in its relation to 
the sea over the last 40,000 years. 
During the last Ice Age, from approx- 
imately 120,000 to 5,000 years ago, the sea 
level was lowered as much as 150 metres, as 
so much water was locked up in the form of 
ice in the great ice caps on the continents. 
As a result, most of the continental shelves 
of the world were dry, and Palaeolithic 
tribes could walk from Siberia to Alaska, 
from continental Europe to Britain, from 
the Soviet Union to Japan, and most of the 
way from Asia to Australia. Today under- 
water archaeology is contributing to 
our knowledge about these prehistoric 
migrations. Ph

### 76550: Plunging into the past: underwater archaeology, a new scientific discipline with a wide popular following

High standards of stratigraphic recording 
are now considered routine underwater. In 
the 1950s, Professor George Bass 
pioneered the techniques which enabled di- 
vers to maintain the same standards of re- 
cording as would be expected on land, pro- 
ducing accurate descriptions of deposits and 
using grids to produce precise site plans. 
Over the decades, improvements in electro- 
nic positioning, sonar imaging, and the use 
of underwater survey equipment and tape- 
recorders for fast on-site data collection, 
have improved the procedures, and made 
work faster. But the objective is always the 
same: to record the three-dimensional 
structure of a deposit, whether a wreck or 
an occupation site, so that the sequence of 
accumulation of artefacts and natural debris 
can be understood. This time-sequenced 
accumulation can then be unscrambled in 
reverse, so as to get as close as possible to 
the conditions and mode of use of the arte- 
facts at the moment before deposition. 
The stories presented on the following 
pages are a small selection of the many 
hundreds of underwater archaeological re- 
search projects at present underway in 
many countries. They range from large ex- 
cavations centred on major museums to the 
excavations of modest wrecks by amateurs. 
They are typical of projects in the 1980s. 
Above all, they show a healthy level of 
energy, dedication to detail, and stimulat- 
ing response to new ideas. 
Where does underwater archaeology go 
from here? Firstly, we should perhaps be 
cautious and cast doubt on the theory that 
underwater archaeology has reached 
maturity. Conflicts between amateurs and 
professionals, between souvenir hunters 
and archaeologists, between treasure-sal- 
vors and those concerned with presenting 
and preserving the past for the benefit of 
- present and future generations still create 
continuous problems. Nor have legislation 
and attitudes really evolved to contain the 
conflict. A great deal of educational effort, 
in the broadest sense, is needed to bring 
order. 
The World Confederation of Underwa- 
ter Activities (CMAS) is currently carrying 
out a survey of the underwater cultural 
heritage in an attempt to meet the need for 
an overall assessment of the present state of 
underwater archaeology and for greater ex- 
change of this information (see box). Ques- 
tionnaires on both marine cultural re- 
sources and inland underwater sites have 
been sent out by CMAS to 151 countries. 
Information on national inventories de- 
scribing the numbers of underwater and 
marine artefacts in various countries, have 
been received from Europe, Africa, Asia 
and the entire Mediterranean littoral. The 
survey aims to produce a consultative docu- 
ment including specific recommendations 
for increased support for research. 
There is a growing awareness that the 
underwater archaeological heritage belongs 
to the population at large, to the nation, to 
the community and that nobody has the 
right to destroy it or exploit it for private 
gain. If a wreck or city is too expensive to 
excavate and preserve in the dry, then it 
should be left and protected underwater. In 
parallel with principles applied on land in 
many countries, if social priorities demand 
the construction of a harbour, motorway, 
barrage, or oil well, then preventive 
archaeology should be carried out first. 
Another important trend in underwater 
archaeology today relates to co-operation 
between amateurs and professionals. It has 
been suggested that tens of millions of peo- 
ple have an interest in archaeology, that 
there are two million or so sports divers, a 
few hundred professional archaeologists, 
and a few tens of professional treasure hun- 
ters. Many professional underwater 
archaeologists stress that their work would 
be impossible without amateur assistance. 
Since there are now sports diving federa- 
tions in over sixty-five countries, and most 
Photography is an essential tool for the 
underwater archaeologist who, like the ex- 
cavator of any archaeological site, must 
record the locations of finds and make an 
accurate survey of the site. Stereophotog- 
rammetry is today widely used to produce 
accurate site-plans from stereoscopic 
photos taken at different points along a 
frame. Right, a diving archaeologist sets 
up a camera mounted on a boom ready for 
stereophotogrammetry. Since it is gener- 
ally impossible to encompass the whole 
area being excavated in a single photo, 
archaeologists fit a number of photos 
together like a jigsaw puzzle to give a 
general impression of the site. Below, 
photomosaic of the wreck of the 17th-cen- 
tury Swedish vessel Kronan in the Baltic 
(see article page 26). The main problems in 
photography under water are that light, 
colour and contrast are lost with increas- 
ing depth. 
of them show serious interest in underwater 
archaeology, it is not surprising that the 
number of new sites reported to the author- 
ities should be increasing rapidly. In the 
Mediterranean, for example, most known 
ancient wrecks are from areas where there 
are the most sports divers, in the south of 
France. Similarly, most Neolithic sites have 
been discovered off the coasts of Denmark, 
Israel and Florida, where sports divers and 
professionals have combined to search for 
them. Since sports diving is rather expen- 
sive as a hobby, it tends to spread progres- 
sively to more and more of the developing 
countries as they increase their level of 
technology and raise the economic standard 
of living. We can therefore expect a steady 
increase of new data from the coasts of Asia 
and Africa in the coming years. |

An international 
survey of 
the underwater 
heritage 
he Scientific Committee of the 
World Confederation of 
Underwater Activities 
(CMAS) is currently carrying out an 
international survey of the underwa- 
ter cultural heritage. The survey, 
which is being prepared with Unesco 
support, will review marine cultural 
resources and inland underwater 
sites, mechanisms for their protec: 
tion, shipwreck data bases and under- 
water cultural heritage inventories, 
ways of disseminating results, and the 
priorities for underwater archaeolo- 
gical research. The survey is designed 
to record submerged archaeological 
remains without giving away their 
locations. 
CMAS, which has also produced an 
International Code of Practice for Sci- 
entific Diving, is an international non- 
governmental organization which 
groups national bodies concerned 
with the training and safety of non- 
military and non-commercial divers 
involved in the fields of sport, photo- 
graphy, science, conservation, medi- 
cine, and the technology of diving 
equipment. Its Scientific Committee, 
established in 1970, includes repre- 
sentatives from bodies concerned with 
professional diving and has Commis- 
sions on biology and conservation, 
technology, geology and archaeology. 
Already a number of sites of im- 
portance for marine archaeology have 
been included on Unesco’s World 
Heritage List of properties of out- 
standing universal value. These sites 
are covered by the system of protec- 
tion and international co-operation 
organized by the World Heritage 
Convention adopted by the General 
Conference of Unesco in 1972 (see the 
Unesco Courier, October 1987). They 
include the Great Barrier Reef (Aus- 
tralia), where a number of shipwrecks 
of historical interest are known, in- 
cluding that of HMS Pandora (see col- 
our pages) which ran aground there in 
1791. Also on the List are the island of 
Gorée (Senegal), the great classical 
cities of Carthage (Tunisia) and Leptis 
Magna (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya), 
and the ruins of Kilwa Kisiwani and 
Songo Mnara (United Republic of 
Tanzania), whence merchants once 
controlled a large proportion of trade 
in the Indian Ocean.

### 76551: The Mediterranean, an underwater museum

The Mediterranean, 
an underwater museum 
by Anthony J. Parker 
history, especially the far-reaching 
‘Roman Empire, grew up around the 
Mediterranean Sea. They were thus in- 
volved with seafaring, fishing and seaborne 
commerce from the earliest times. Even in 
the seventh millennium BC, finds of obsi- 
dian and fish-bones in prehistoric settle- 
ments in Greece show that the sea was not 
an insuperable barrier. 
In the classical period, cities such as 
Athens or Rome could not have survived 
without a regular supply of food and raw 
materials from overseas, brought by hun- 
dreds of sailing ships. An observer, gazing 
out over the Mediterranean from a cliff or a 
mountain top on a summer day some time in 
the last two centuries before Christ or the 
first two centuries of the Christian era, 
would have seen the blue sea dotted with 
sails. 
The Mediterranean, though effectively 
tideless, and enjoying good visibility and 
calm weather for much of the summer, can 
still hold dangers for sailing ships. There are 
many low, sandy coasts which lack naviga- 
tion marks and natural havens; there are 
also rocky, mountainous coasts where ships 
can be held up by contrary winds, or over- 
whelmed by squalls. Mediterranean cur- 
rents, too, though they are scarcely noticed 
by modern, powered ships, are strong 
enough, if combined with other hazards, to 
place a small sailing ship in danger. 
The magnetic compass was unknown to 
the classical world: ships navigated the 
Mediterranean by looking out for land- 
marks such as mountains, or by watching 
the stars at night. A sudden storm could 
therefore endanger the ship, not just if it 
were to be overwhelmed or made to leak, 
but by blotting out the sky or the horizon so 
that the ship sailed unawares into danger. 
Small wonder, then, that there were 
many shipwrecks in classical Antiquity. The 
actual total number of ships lost is un- 
known—it must run into scores or hundreds 
of thousands—but the dangers of sailing 
(especially outside the best months of the 
year) were well known, and are mentioned 
by many writers, both Greek and Latin. 
Today, almost 1,000 shipwrecks of the clas- 
sical and medieval periods have been disco- 
vered in the Mediterranean and the Black 
TT: formative cultures of European Sea; nearly all of these have been found by 
aqualung divers in the last forty years. 
This body of information, which is con- 
tinuing to grow at the rate of between fifty 
and a hundred new sites every year, offers 
great opportunities to archaeologists and 
historians to find out more about the com- 
merce and economy of the ancient world. 
There are, of course, plenty of difficulties. 
The shipwrecked cargoes which survive for 
divers to discover do not, for the most part, 
include perishable goods such as corn, tim- 
ber or cloth, which were certainly among 
the most important items of trade; not all 
wrecks are well preserved; some areas have 
not been thoroughly searched; all too many 
sites have been inadequately excavated, re- 
corded, studied or published; and many 
divers are concerned only with collecting 
souvenirs or even making a profit out of 
selling their finds. 
The special qualities of classical ship- 
wreck sites are double—the overall view 
and the detailed insight. Since almost no 
statistics referring to seaborne trade survive 
from Antiquity, the hundreds of lost ships, 
even though they are individually very 
varied, can supply a kind of statistic. No 
master ever chose deliberately to wreck his 
ship, destroy his cargo and risk his crew’s 
lives: shipwrecks are essentially a hapha- 
zard selection from the voyages which were 
made, though we do not (and cannot) tell 
whether the selection is really a meaningful 
sample. 
The areas where shipwrecks have been 
found is one such statistic. The map on page 
9 shows how they have been reported from 
most parts of the Mediterranean, but that 
the distribution is decidedly uneven. Many 
coastal areas, and most of the deep sea, 
have no wrecks at all; conversely, some 
areas, such as the south of France, which 
has one-fifth of all recorded sites, bulk dis- 
proportionately large because diving is 
popular in this area, there is a State under- 
water archaeology service, and most of the 
known sites have been published. 
Another statistic which can be derived 
from the shipwreck reports is the periods at 
which voyages were most frequent. The 
great majority of known Mediterranean 
shipwrecks date from the Hellenistic and 
early Roman Empire periods. Knowledge

of prehistory, and even of the colonizing 
and archaic centuries of Greek and Phoeni- 
cian navigation, remains surprisingly un- 
documented. On the other hand, the statis- 
tics clearly show the revival of Mediterra- 
nean commerce in the sixth century AD. In 
the medieval period (after the Arab con- 
quest of the seventh century AD) there 
were many changes in seaborne commerce, 
and so it is not surprising that wrecks of 
these centuries have rarely been reported. 
In order to collect general statistics of this 
kind, one has to take into account all man- 
ner of wrecks, both well-preserved, where 
the ship’s cargo and a good part of her hull 
lie on the sea-bed much as they came to rest 
on the day she sank, and mere scatters of 
broken pottery, often ground into tiny 
pieces by the waves and mingled with the 
remains of other cargoes lost at the same 
hazardous spot. Nor are all the published 
reports of wrecks of equal value: in fact, 
over a quarter of all recorded sites have 
been published only in very summary 
terms, such as “A Roman wreck two 
kilometres out to sea...”. Figures and dia- 
grams can reduce this very varied material 
to order for the historian, but there can be 
no doubt that it is well-preserved and fully- 
excavated wrecks that with their grouping 
of cargo, nautical equipment, personal pos-

sessions and hull timbers offer real gains to 
archaeology. 
The people and objects on board a ship 
make up a very special group in any society, 
but we rarely have similar opportunities on 
land to catch a glimpse of people and arte- 
facts frozen in the midst of their daily life. 
This “time capsule” aspect of ancient ship- 
wrecks never fails to enthral divers, as 
weed, encrustation and sand are delicately 
stripped from the underlying deposits. Just 
one example could be cited—the Byzantine 
wreck of Yassi Ada, excavated by George 
Bass and Fred Van Doorninck, where the 
captain, Georgios, had meals cooked in a 
tiny stone-floored galley in the stern while 
his quite small ship sailed on with her cargo 
of anise-flavoured wine, slopping about in a 
job lot of second-hand jars. One could 
name many more details, and many other

wrecks, which together make up a vivid and 
ever-growing tapestry of life in the ancient 
world. 
Gathering the threads of this tapestry, 
however, involves more than merely diving 
and collecting artefacts. Wreck-sites can 
only be understood if they are meticulously 
excavated, fully recorded on site, if the 
finds are carefully catalogued and con- 
served, and—most important of all—if 
enough time, effort and money are spent on 
making a thorough study of every aspect of 
the site. The Yassi Ada wreck is one of a 
mere handful of excavated wrecks which 
have been anything like properly studied 
and published. 
In the Mediterranean, as elsewhere, 
wrecks are threatened with destruction 
from commercial development and casual 
looting. Portable artefacts such as amphor-

as are hard to protect by legislation and 
policing, and often the only way to save a 
site from destruction is to excavate it as 
soon as possible. 
There are some wrecks, however, which 
are easier to protect, at least from casual 
depredation, and they are also often spec- 
tacular sites on which to dive. These are the 
remains of marble and building stone car- 
goes. At Rome the demand for fine stone 
with which to construct or finish off build- 
ings had to be met by importing marble and 
granite from Greece, Turkey, Egypt and 
other distant parts of the Empire. Natural- 
ly, some stone-carrying ships failed to reach 
their destination, and their cargoes lie lost 
and abandoned along the sea-routes of the 
Mediterranean. To swim under water 
among the great blocks of stone is an aes- 
thetic and an evocative experience. 
Let us hope that these sites can be left as 
they are, with some protected status and 
with a guardian boatman in charge, to serve 
as exciting and instructive underwater 
monuments which tourists (with aqualungs, 
snorkels or even glass-bottomed buckets) 
can view, just as (in another dimension) 
they might visit the Colosseum or the Parth- 
enon on land. [| 
ANTHONY J. PARKER, of the UK, is lecturer in 
Roman archaeology at Bristol University. He is 
the author of a forthcoming comprehensive re- 
view of pre-16th-century wrecks in the 
Mediterranean. 
Drawing at left is an example of site-map- 
ping as practiced by underwater 
archaeologists. It shows the wreck of a 
small Roman merchant ship which ran 
aground on the beach of Randello, on the 
south coast of Sicily, around AD 300, while 
carrying a cargo of sardines preserved in 
brine and stored in amphoras. Almost 
1,700 years later, In 1982, the wreck was 
excavated by a team of archaeologists 
from British universities, with the help of 
the man who found it, Dott. Giovanni 
D'Andrea, and the assistance of the Sici- 
lian authorities. Analysis of fish-bones in 
the amphoras revealed that the sardines 
had “been processed in a permanent, pro- 
fessional fish-factory”, writes Dr. Anthony 
Parker. “The clay and shape of the 
amphoras point to the Sado estuary of 
Portugal as the place where this was done; 
in the ruined Roman town of Troia, at the 
mouth of the estuary, batteries of fish- 
salting tanks can still be seen. The salt- 
pans of the Sado are traditionally re- 
nowned for the fine flavour of their salt, 
and a century ago the fishermen of the 
area were recorded as using boats and 
nets for catching sardines in a way which 
is extraordinarily like not only what we 
know of Roman fishing in general but also 
what can be inferred from the Randello 
sardine bones.”

### 76552: The Madrague de Giens wreck; a Roman freighter yields its secrets

A Roman 
freighter 
yields its secrets 
The Madrague 
‘de Giens 
wreck 
  
by André Tchernia 
diver-archaeologists of the 
Archaeological Institute run jointly 
in Aix-en-Provence (France) by the Uni- 
versity of Provence and the National Centre 
for Scientific Research (CNRS), pitched 
camp each summer in a pine wood over- 
looking the sea on the southern shore of the 
Giens peninsula, some thirty kilometres 
east of Toulon. 
A Roman wreck had been discovered 
near the little fishing port of La Madrague 
de Giens in 1967, and since it was lying at a 
reasonable depth—18 to 20 metres—and 
had not, like so many others, been pillaged 
by looters, it was chosen as the site of the 
first truly scientific underwater excavation 
carried out in France on a considerable 
scale. Three years of work were planned: 
little did we know, at the time, that the 
wreck would prove to be one of the two or 
three largest ancient ships whose remains 
have ever been found under the sea. 
The method adopted is easier to describe 
than it was to implement, given the nature 
of our equipment and changing conditions 
at sea. It meant extricating the objects care- 
fully and completely using an air pump, 
without moving any one of them before its 
position had been recorded; attaching 
clearly visible numbers to all the amphoras 
and other important objects; carrying out a 
stereoscopic photographic coverage of the 
area explored; raising to the surface the 
objects thus identified, and continuing to 
probe, level by level, as far as the hull. 
Lastly, we carefully examined the hull itself 
and dismantled parts of it in order to deter- 
mine how it had been constructed. 
Fa eleven years, from 1972 to 1982, 
The ship was wrecked some time around 
70-60 BC. It was carrying a cargo of wine 
from Italy—to be precise, from the region 
of Terracina: we know the location of the 
workshop where most of the amphoras in 
the cargo were manufactured. It measured 
nearly 40 metres in length, and could carry 
7,000 or 8,000 amphoras, which gave it a 
tonnage of 350 to 400 tons: a respectable 
capacity for any traditional sea-going vessel 
as late as the nineteenth century.

Part of the cargo of amphoras carried by 
the Roman merchantman wrecked off the 
south coast of France near La Madrague 
de Giens. 
But we did not find so many thousands of 
amphoras on the sea-bed. Firstly because, 
on its last voyage, the ship was not fully 
loaded with wine. An extra cargo, consist- 
ing of crates of black glazed pottery, had 
been packed on top. Secondly, and above 
all, because we were able to establish that 
divers—probably professionals—had come 
to salvage the sunken cargo shortly after the 
wreck, and had raised to the surface at least 
half of the amphoras. There were two con- 
sistent pointers to this. The wreck is strewn 
with large stones; a geological study has 
shown that they very probably came from 
the peninsula itself, or from the opposite 
coast adjoining the town of Hyeres. These 
are the stones used by skin divers in order to 
plummet more quickly to the sea-bed, as 
sponge divers have done for centuries 
throughout the Mediterranean. 
Furthermore, scrutiny of photographs 
and plans produced during the excavation 
reveals beyond a shadow of doubt that, 
despite the displacement of the cargo dur- 
ing and after the wreck, while three layers 
of amphoras are still in place on the port 
side, there is only one layer to starboard. In 
some places there are even holes in the 
cargo, and one or two isolated amphoras 
have remained embedded in the volcanic 
sand which, to aft, was used both as ballast 
and to hold the amphoras in place, whereas 
those next to them were hoisted on board 
the boat used as a base by our predecessors 
in Roman times. 
Studying the hull called for the most spec- 
tacular measures. In order to examine the 
keel and take samples from it, it was neces- 
sary to dig a tunnel under the hull and to use 
underwater chain-saws. The fragments re- 
moved were taken apart and studied trenail 
TT... ye 
by trenail on land, then reassembled exactly 
as before and returned to their place in the 
wreck. 
The most important finding was the con- 
firmation that the strongly curved hull pro- 
file and the depth of the keel would certain- 
ly have prevented the ship from drifting 
very much and would have enabled it to sail 
to windward. The elaborate form of the hull 
would have compensated for the large, non- 
specialized sails of ancient ships and given it 
speed. Forward, an inverted stem and a 
bobstay piece added the finishing touches to 
the ship’s nautical qualities. 
Patrice Pomey drew up a detailed plan of 
the hull and superimposed it on a much 
later picture of a ship represented on a 
Tunisian mosaic. The proportions are ex- 
actly the same: the upward sweep fore and 
aft begins at exactly the same point, and the 
bilge pump and the masts are in the same 
positions. From this we must draw three 
important conclusions: that this mosaic, 
and probably many others, represent 
ancient ships with much more realism and 
accuracy than might be supposed; that the 
missing parts and the sails of the Giens 
wreck must have been similar to those on 
the mosaic; and that this type of ship was 
built to a virtually identical pattern for more 
than three centuries. 
Five years after the end of the excavation, 
an exhaustive study of the results is still far 
from complete. Further observations will 
be made. It is a pity that no other way of 
preserving this great sailing ship of Antiqui- 
ty could be found than covering it with sand 
again and leaving it buried where we had 
found it. |

ITALY 
The Riace warriors 
In August 1972, a Roman skin-diver disco- 
vered two large bronze statues representing 
human figures near Riace on the Calabrian 
coast of southern Italy. He immediately 
informed the archaeological authority for 
the area, and the statues, about 2 metres 
high and weighing over 150 kilos, were reco- 
vered from the sea-bed and brought back to 
land. Authentic examples of classical Athe- 
nian art, it is thought that they may have 
belonged to a group of 11 statues intended 
to decorate the temple at Delphi. Some 
specialists believe that they are the work of 
the great Greek sculptor Phidias who, with 
his pupils, carved the frontispiece and 
friezes of the Parthenon in Athens. After 
some 2,000 years of immersion, the restora- 
tion of these masterpieces of Sth-century- 
BC Greek art proved along and painstaking 
job. The statues were X-rayed to provide a 
picture of their internal structure and the 
thickness of their different parts in order to 
choose appropriate restoration materials. 
Research revealed that metals other than 
bronze were used for certain parts of the 
statues. The teeth and eyelashes of one of 
the figures are in silver, lips are of copper, 
ivory was used for whites of the eyes and 
vitreous paste and amber for the iris. The 
statues are now preserved at the Magna 
Graecia Museum in Reggio di Calabria, 
where they were shown to the public for the 
first time 7 years after being discovered.

TURKEY 
‘Metal biscuits with ears’ 
This was how a young sponge diver des- 
cribed the objects he had spotted lying on 
the sea-bed, in the autumn of 1982, less than 
100 m from his home village of Kas. For the 
experts from the Bodrum Museum of 
Underwater Archaeology, this image re- 
called the copper ingots recovered in 1960 
from a shipwreck at nearby Cape Gelidony- 
a. The US archaeologist George Bass and 
his team from the Institute of Nautical 
Archaeology of Texas A & M University, 
who had studied the Gelidonya wreck, im- 
.mediately launched plans to excavate the 
site, which has pushed back knowledge of 
the shipbuilding techniques of Antiquity as 
far as the Bronze Age. The copper ingots 
found in the Kas wreck resemble an ingot 
depicted in an Egyptian tomb at Thebes 
dating from 1350 BC (copper was combined 
with tin to make the bronze from which the 
era takes its name). The discovery of a 
miniature seal, no larger than a button, with 
markings similar to those used by ancient 
Greek merchants, suggested the origin of 
the vessel. Among the finds in the wreck are 
many precious objects in gold, pottery, 
amphoras from Canaan, Mycenae and Cyp- 
rus, as well as cobalt-blue glass ingots, the 
earliest glass ever found, probably intended 
for making jewellery or goblets. The wreck 
is still giving up its rich cargo, and the 
remains of the hull will perhaps supply vital 
information on the type of ships in use at the 
time of the Trojan Wars.

FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF 
GERMANY 
Conserving the Bremen Cog 
When the harbour at Bremen on the Weser 
estuary in the Fed. Rep. of Germany was 
dredged in 1962, engineers uncovered a 
14th-century merchant vessel or “Cog” pre- 
served in the mud (top). The wreck was 
rescued with a view to research and conser- 
vation. The raising of the Cog, the Wasa and 
the 5 Viking ships from Roskilde Fjord 
confronted museum conservators for the 
first time with the problem of preserving 
huge objects made of waterlogged, soft, old 
wood. Scientists discovered that such tim- 
bers could be protected against the distor- 
tions caused by shrinkage which would in- 
evitably occur as they dried by impregna- 
tion with a water-soluble wax, polyethylene 
glycol (abbreviated PEG). After the Cog 
had been reconstructed from some 2,000 
pieces of timber (a task which took 7 years), 
a conservation tank was built around it so 
that it could be immersed in a PEG solution 
(above). Today visitors to the German 
Maritime Museum at Bremerhaven can see 
the resubmerged vessel through windows in 
the tank, where it will be immersed for 
many years. Controlled drying will then 
take place and the tank will function as a 
huge controlled climate chamber.

JAMAICA 
Port Royal—a submarine 
Pompeii 
Shortly before noon on 7 June 1692, the 
bustling life of Port Royal (Jamaica) ended 
in a violent earthquake and tidal wave. 
Within minutes, nine-tenths of the great 
Caribbean trading centre lay beneath the 
waters of what is now Kingston Harbour. 
Since then many divers have explored its 
ruins, but not always with the controls and 
documentation demanded by modern 
archaeology. In 1978 a plan of collaboration 
between the Government of Jamaica and 
the Institute of Nautical Archaeology of 
Texas A & M University was established, 
and a thorough research programme was 
initiated. There are hundreds of submerged 
buildings to be excavated, offering a wealth 
of architectural data and artefacts, and 
work will continue for years to come. A vast 
quantity of brass, pewter, silver, iron, glass, 
pottery and wood objects have already been 
brought to the surface to be restored and 
studied. The X-ray of one find, an encrusted 
watch, has revealed the time at which the 
earthquake struck.     
UNITED KINGDOM 
Tudor life at sea 
On a calm summer day in 1545, as a French 
invasion fleet lay at anchor off Portsmouth, 
King Henry VIII's flagship, Mary Rose, 
sailed into her final battle. Probably as a 
result of poor handling and overloading, she 
heeled over and sank, so close to the shore 
that the king, watching her go down, is said 
to have heard the cries of the drowning. 
sailors. On 11 October 1982, 437 years later, 
the surviving starboard hull structure of the 
700-ton vessel was raised to the surface (see 
drawings) and towed into Portsmouth har- 
bour as the climax of a great rescue opera- 
tion which had begun in the late 1960s when 
maritime archaeologists located the wreck. 
A survey and exploration programme was 
carried out by volunteer divers, scientists 
and archaeologists until 1979, and then the 
contents of the ship were removed and its 
structure fully recorded. Divers brought up 
17,000 artefacts representing almost every 
aspect of Tudor life at sea. The internal 
structural timbers of the hull were disman- 
tled and taken ashore. After being raised in 
a protective steel cradle, the Mary Rose was 
taken to a special dry dock in Portsmouth 
dockyard. Today visitors can view the hull, 
like a giant cutaway model towering to the 
height of a 4-storey building, and watch the 
work underway to replace many of the tim- 
bers removed during the years of underwa- 
ter excavation (top right). When this work is 
complete long-term conservation can begin, 
The hall in which the ship is preserved is 
kept at 95 % humidity. The hull is sprayed 
with chilled water to prevent degradation 
and uncontrolled drying.

MEXICO 
The sacred well of Chichén-Itza 
Underwater archaeology began in Mexico 
with the exploration of the cenote (sacred 
well) of Chichén-Itz4 (left), a freshwater 
well with a diameter of 68 m and a depth of 
22 m to the surface of the water, itself 14 m 
deep. The Mayan civilization, a highly de- 
veloped pre-Hispanic culture of Meso- 
America, worshipped water deities, and vo- 
tive offerings were thrown into the well in 
their honour. The first, unsuccessful, 
attempt to explore it was made in 1881 to 
1882 by the French antiquarian Désiré 
Charnay. In 1904, Edward H. Thompson, 
the first United States consul to Yucatan, 
organized two seasons of diving work to 
dredge the well, recovering archaeological 
treasures (jade figures, stone sculptures, 
gold and copper discs, remains of human 
skeletons), which went to the Peabody 
Museum in Harvard University, USA. 
Other salvage attempts were carried out at 
later dates. The most recent explorations 
took place in 1967 to 1968, under the direc- 
tion of Dr. Pifia Chan, of the National Insti- 
tute of Anthropology and History, Mexico. 
The team employed various methods, such 
as lowering the water level almost 4 m and 
chemically clarifying the water. The divers 
used the most advanced techniques, and all 
the artefacts recovered, which will be pre- 
served in museums in various parts of the 
country, will be studied and classified by 
specialists from the Institute.

DENMARK 
Viking dragon ships 
Five Viking sailing ships scuttled over 900 
years ago at the entrance to Roskilde Fjord, 
near the village of Skuldelev in Denmark, 
were discovered in the late 1950s during 
underwater excavations organized by the 
Danish National Museum. In 1962, a coffer- 
dam was built round the site which was 
pumped free of water so that the wrecks 
could be excavated as if on land. After 
lengthy conservation treatment the ships 
were painstakingly reconstructed. The re- 
mains were those of 2 warships of different 
size, 2 merchant ships, and a smaller vessel, 
perhaps a ferry or a fishing boat. The larger 
warship seems to have been at least 30 m 
long with provision for 26 pairs of oars. Such 
a longship, designed for speed and man- 
oeuvrability, could have carried up to 60 
warriors as well as its crew, and would have 
been a pillar of Danish maritime power a 
thousand years ago. One of the merchant- 
men is almost certainly a knarr, a type of 
broad-beamed ocean-going craft which was 
described in the Icelandic Sagas and formed 
the backbone of Viking trade. The Roskilde 
find provided archaeologists with a unique 
opportunity in northern waters to study 
ships built at the same time but for different 
purposes.

Lake-floor archaeology 
The archaeological wealth of lakes and 
other inland underwater sites is much less 
well known than that of sites located in or 
near the sea. In Switzerland and its neigh- 
bouring countries important discoveries 
have been made from lake settlements built 
on piles and dating mainly from the 
Neolithic period and the Bronze Age (from 
the end of the Sth century to the beginning 
of the 1st century BC). In the last 20 years 
excavations in Lake Ziirich, one of the most 
important centres of these lacustrine set- 
tlements, have brought to light Stone Age 
and Bronze Age axe helves, ladles, flint 
knives, looms, archery bows, wooden 
boxes, scraps of netting and textiles, balls of 
yarn and other finds providing valuable in- 
formation about prehistoric technology. 
Four years ago the ground plan of a late 
Bronze Age house was discovered at a spot 
where volunteer divers had previously 
found a collection of small Bronze Age 
vessels. Today this cultural heritage is in 
great danger due to construction work on 
the shoreline, dredging to accommodate 
shipping, and increased wave erosion in the 
shore area as protective reeds are removed.

The Kyrenia wreck 
Discovered by a sponge-diver, a 4th-cen- 
tury-BC amphora carrier lying in about 30 
m of water near the harbour town of Kyre- 
nia, Cyprus, began to be surveyed and exca- 
vated in 1968 by a team led by Michael L. 
Katzev of the University of Pennsylvania. 
Thus began a programme of conservation 
and research which has continued for 
almost two decades and culminated in the 
building of Kyrenia II, a full-scale, sailable 
replica of the ancient Greek merchantman 
(see page 23). The Kyrenia Ship, writes 
Katzev, “represents the best preserved hull 
of the Classical Greek period ever found. 
About 60 per cent of her total area and more 
than 75 per cent of her representative tim- 
bers survived to be recorded in meticulous 
detail. Five years went into raising the hull 
piece by piece, preserving it in polyethylene 
glycol, then mounting it for exhibition in a 
handsome sandstone gallery of the Crusad- 
er Castle at Kyrenia”. Its cargo included 
some 400 amphoras, as well as crockery, 
millstones, iron ingots, and the remains of 
nearly 10,000 almonds.

SWEDEN 
Raising the Wasa 
In 1961, the Swedish warship Wasa was 
raised from the bottom of Stockholm har- 
bour, where she had sunk at the start of her 
maiden voyage in 1628. This huge vessel, 
displacing about 1,300 tons and measuring 
70 m from stem to stern, was apparently 
unstable and capsized in 35 m of water. She 
was remarkably well-preserved: she had not 
suffered damage from long service at sea, 
she had not run aground, and, lying at the 
. bottom for three centuries, she had not 
been damaged by ice or currents nor attack- 
Richly decorated stern of the Wasa. In the 
middle, the Swedish national coat-of-arms.

The wreck, rediscovered in 1956 by an 
amateur marine archaeologist and histor- 
ian, Anders Franzen, is an outstanding 
testimony to 17th-century naval 
architecture and life in Sweden. An unpre- 
cedented rescue operation was mounted 
which lasted from 1957 to 1961. The sal- 
vaged ship was housed in a spegial hall 
where the correct temperature and humid- 
ity could be maintained, and sprinklers 
were installed to prevent premature drying 
out of the wood. Treatment of the water- 
logged timbers was carried out by a system 
of pipes and nozzles by which every part of 
the ship was sprayed for more than 10 years 
with a solution of polyethylene glycol 
(PEG). By the late 1970s, more than 6 
million people had already visited the 
museum to see this major addition to 
Sweden’s cultural heritage.

### 76554: Technology and the marine archaeologist

Technology and the marine 
archaeologist 
é AVY Jones meets the com- 
D puter.” “High Tech Treasure 
Hunt.” These headlines from 
articles on recent finds of important ship- 
wrecks are signs of the growing role of 
sophisticated equipment in the location and 
excavation of historic underwater sites. The 
privateer De Braak, lost in 1798 with a 
fortune in treasure reported aboard, was 
found just off the shore of Lewes, De- 
laware, USA, by side-scan sonar. The site 
of what is probably the pirate vessel 
Whidah, sunk on the outer shore of Cape 
Cod in 1717, was located by magnetometer. 
In both cases, precision navigation played a 
vital role. 
The applications of technology go far 
beyond the search phase of any project. 
Sites must be excavated carefully, with pre- 
cise mapping and recording of the locations 
of all objects found. Underwater work 
raises difficulties unlike those encountered 
on land. Besides the obvious problem of 
breathing, there are limitations in com- 
munications, visibility, and movement, to 
name a few. One of the early tasks of mod- 
ern marine archaeology was to develop 
tools whose performance would match or 
exceed those being used at land sites. That 
goal generally has been achieved. 
Just because a search or site mapping 
operation uses all the latest electronic giz- 
mos and computer-controlled whatsits does 
not mean that it is going about the project in 
the right way. Proper technology should not 
be confused with proper technique. Tech- 
nology is just the hardware, electronic or 
otherwise, that is used for the job. Tech-

k. a a 
nique is the way in which that equipment is 
used. 
The question of technique should come 
into play as soon as a project is conceived. 
One factor in the initial planning of a job is 
the selection of the appropriate technology. 
And, even if the proper equipment is selec- 
ted, all efforts may fail if it is not used 
properly. For example, running a sonar 
search with inadequate navigational control 
is poor technique and could lead to failure. 
The right way to go about a projectisto a) 
succeed, and b) spend as little money and 
time as possible in doing so. Both too much 
and too little technology can be a problem. 
Without proper technique, success be- 
comes a matter of luck. Proper selection of 
tools and methods is playing an increasingly 
important role in finding shipwrecks and 
other sites and in carrying out the excava- 
tion and providing documentation. 
The role of research as the first phase in 
any search project cannot be overempha- 
sized. The inexpensive hours spent in librar- 
ies and archives can save many expensive 
and difficult hours searching on the water. 
A survivor's report that “the wreck is lo- 
cated in two fathoms of water, two leagues 
south of the river mouth” may sound like a 
good lead until the researcher learns that a 
“league” has meant different things in diffe- 
rent times and places, and the river mouth, 
by Charles Mazel 
not to mention the position of the beach 
itself, may have moved a great distance in 
the time since the original disaster. A se- 
rious student of the art will learn much 
about the history of how one measures 
time, distance, and position. 
- The most commonly used instruments for 
searching in the oceans are the side-scan 
sonar, the sub-bottom profiler, and the 
magnetometer. These generally can be 
called high tech. Other methods, just as 
good, fall under the categories low tech, no 
The manned deep-water submersible 
Alvin, of the Woods Hole Oceanographic 
Institution (USA), with its mother ship, 
Atlantis Il. In 1986 Alvin explored the 
wreck of the Titanic 4,000 metres beneath 
the North Atlantic. Much advanced tech- 
nology is available for marine archaeology 
but its use on a routine basis is often 
limited because of prohibitive costs.

tech, and plumb luck. The great majority of 
finds have resulted from methods as simple 
as talking to local sponge divers, or spend- 
ing long hours in a small boat with a hand- 
operated coring device. 
Side-scan sonars and sub-bottom profil- 
ers are acoustic devices that use sound 
waves to produce a hard-copy, graphic re- 
cord of the sea floor and underlying 
sediments. Both instruments are portable 
and utilize battery power. They can be 
operated from small boats, thus making it 
possible to mount search operations in diffi- 
cult or remote locations. 
In the side-scan sonar, a torpedo-shaped 
“towfish” transmits pulses of high-frequen- 
cy sound (50 to 500 kilohertz) out to both 
sides. The pulses are transmitted in a nar- 
row beam in the horizontal plane, giving 
good resolution, and a broad beam in the 
vertical plane, providing wide coverage. 
Sound is returned to the sonar from the 
texture of the sea floor and by reflections 
from targets. The returns from successive 
pulses are printed side by side on the paper 
record, producing a very detailed view of 
the sea floor, similar to an aerial photo- 
graph. A side-scan can produce an image of 
the sea floor more than 300 metres out on 
‘mmm 1,,th sides of the tow path.

graphicimage of the surface of the sea floor. 
Areas of rock, sand, mud, or other material 
can be distinguished. If an archaeological 
site leaves some visible trace on the sea 
floor, it can be found by side-scan sonar. If a 
wreck is relatively intact, the sonar image 
may be clear enough to allow identification 
from the sonar record alone. In some cases, 
indirect indications, such as a difference in 
material type, may be enough to point to a 
site location even if no portion of the wreck 
itself is exposed. A side-scan sonar unit 
cannot detect sites that are completely 
buried beneath the sea floor. Extremely 
rocky or irregular bottoms can make it hard 
to interpret sonar returns. 
The sub-bottom profiler utilizes low-fre- 
quency sound (3.5 to 12 kilohertz) to pene- 
trate bottom sediments. A pulse of sound is 
directed vertically down into the bottom. 
Ateachinterface between different types of 
sediment layers some of the sound energy 
continues on and some is reflected. As the 
device is towed along, a cross-sectional view 
of the sea floor is generated, showing the 
different layers and the underlying bed- 
rock. If there are buried hull remains, they 
can show up as a localized reflection below 
the bottom. 
A sub-bottom profiler can be used to 
locate sites that are completely buried. 
  
   
  
Drawing shows 4 methods of geophysical 
surveying under water. (1) The proton 
magnetometer detects variations in the 
earth’s magnetic field, which is distorted 
by objects of a ferrous nature such as 
cannon, iron shot or steel hulls. (2) Side- 
scan sonar detects variations of projec 
tions above the sea-bed. A “fish” towed 
behind the boat transmits a fan-shaped 
beam of acoustic energy perpendicular to 
its path, and rock outcrops, sandwaves, 
wrecks and other projections are recorded 
on a continuous graph (see front cover). 
(3) The sub-bottom profiler is an acoustic 
transmitter which sends out into the sea- 
bed sound pulses which bounce back 
from underlying strata or buried objects. 
All 3 devices, when used simultaneously, 
can detect objects lying on or below the 
sea-bed and distinguish ferrous and non- 
ferrous anomalies, thus helping 
archaeologists to distinguish early timber 
structures from later metal wrecks. (4) 
Another system is the Remotely Operated 
Vehicle (ROV). Equipped with low-light 
videos and cameras, such highly man- 
oeuvrable unmanned submersibles are 
connected to a mother vessel by a cable 
through which they receive electricity and 
commands from their human pilot and 
transmit pictures and data.

### 76554: Technology and the marine archaeologist

A mosaic of X-ray photos of a concretion 
helps to guide a technician in the process 
of chipping off the overlay from iron arte- 
facts recovered from a 16th-century ship- 
wreck off the coast of Texas, USA. 
Since it looks directly down, it covers only a 
narrow path underneath the search vessel. 
This makes it an inefficient tool for general 
searching. The sub-bottom profiler can be 
used effectively to help define the site limits 
and geology once the primary location is 
found by other means. 
In some cases, a magnetometer should be 
used either instead of or along with a side- 
scan sonar or sub-bottom profiler. The 
magnetometer is a passive device that mea- 
sures the strength of the local magnetic 
field. It has been the primary search tool for 
treasure hunters and others looking for 
Spanish vessels in the New World, where 
most wrecks are broken up and buried in 
sand or coral. 
‘The spinning Earth behaves much like a 
bar magnet, with a north and south magne- 
tic pole. At any point on the Earth there will 
be some natural magnetic field strength, 
influenced by the local geology. Concentra- 
tions of ferrous material—such as iron 
anchors, cannon, or ships’ fittings—will al- 
ter that field, producing what is termed a 
magnetic anomaly (or variation). It does 
not matter whether the iron material is 
buried or exposed. The shape and size of 
the anomaly give clues to the mass of iron 
producing it and the depth of burial. 
The unit of measurement of magnetic 
field strength is the gamma. The Earth’s 
natural magnetic field ranges from 30,000 
to 60,000 gammas, depending on the loca- 
tion. Modern magnetometers can detect 
anomalies in the local field of less than 1 
gamma. Although there are several types of 
magnetometer available (cesium, rubi- 
dium, flux-gate), the one most commonly 
used for marine search applications is the 
proton precession magnetometer. These 
units are relatively small, simple and 
robust, and are well suited to field oper- 
ations. 
A magnetometer consists of a sensor, a 
chart recorder, an interconnecting cable, 
and a power supply. The units are portable 
and are easily adapted to virtually any 
search vessel. The sensor is generally towed 
behind the search vessel, although for some 
shallow-water operations magnetometer 
sensors have been mounted on a boom on 
the bow of a small boat or even suspended 
from a helicopter. A boat that is not made 
out of steel is preferred, but any vessel can 
be used if there is enough cable to get the 
magnetometer out of the.influence of the 
vessel’s own magnetic field. 
The strength of an object’s magnetic field 
decreases with the cube of the distance from 
the object. This means that the magneto- 
meter sensor must be towed relatively close 
to the object in order to detect it, depending 
of course on the amount of metal involved. 
As arough guide, a large steel wreck can be 
detected at a range of 120 to 180 metres, a 
site with scattered iron anchors and cannon 
at 80 to 100 metres, an isolated iron cannon 
at 30 metres, and an individual small iron 
object at 3to 5 metres. Skilled operators are 
able to use magnetometer readings to put a 
marker buoy directly on top of the source of 
an anomaly. 
Magnetometers are useful for finding any 
site that has iron structures, artefacts, or 
associated minerals. Since it does not mat- 
ter whether or how deeply the material is 
covered, magnetometers are particularly 
appropriate for locating vessels that are 
buried or located in areas that are unfavour- 
able for sonar searching. 
Magnetometers are not able to detect 
non-ferrous materials, so it is necessary as

part of the research process to determine 
whether and how much of such material 
may be on a site. Bronze cannon, for exam- 
ple, cannot be detected. 
With all these search tools, it is vital to 
have precision navigation. That is the only 
way one can know that the entire search 
area has been covered with a reasonable 
degree of accuracy. It is also needed to 
return to any contacts found with the search 
instruments. : 
The future is already here in terms of 
available technology. Computers, sub- 
mersible vehicles, satellite mapping systems 
and the like, are in widespread use. It is 
their application to marine archaeology that 
is somewhat lagging. In large measure, this 
can be attributed to the prohibitive cost of 
using these systems on a routine basis. 
The major change in search technology is 
likely to be an increasing success rate for 
site location. The basic technology is in a 
relatively advanced state of development. 
Continued advances will be made in select- 
ing the best equipment for a job and car- 
rying out the search properly. As the equip- 
ment and techniques are refined, they will 
play an important role in site identification, 
as opposed to simply site location. 
Aerial and satellite imaging, whether by 
photography or multi-spectral imaging, will 
be more widely used. Satellite images have 
already disclosed previously unknown reef 
structures and sandbars that might contain 
shipwreck sites. Shipwrecks can sometimes 
be seen in high-altitude photographs. 
Photography using optimized film/filter 
combinations could maximize water 
penetration and bottom contrast. 
Pulsed lasers are being used ex- 
perimentally. to make hydrographic 
measurements from aircraft. As the tech- 
nology advances, it will become possible to 
survey large areas of the bottom at pre- 
viously unheard-of rates. Anomalies will be 
found that are caused by shipwreck sites. 
The possibility of finding shipwrecks in 
deep water has been recognized since the 
1960s. Under the right conditions, wood 
and other organic materials suffer little de- 
terioration at great depths. 
The future will see continued progress in 
the ability to locate such sites. More impor- 
tantly, technology will provide the means to 
investigate such sites more efficiently. Un- 
manned, remotely operated vehicles have

already performed television and photo- 
graphic inspections of several sites. One- 
atmosphere diving “suits” now commonly 
used in the offshore oil industry provide the 
archaeologist with direct access to sites at 
ever-increasing depths, with no danger of 
decompression sickness. 
Improvements also continue to be made 
in the ability to document sites rapidly and 
accurately. New film and camera technolo- 
gies make it easier to obtain high-quality 
photographs for documentation. 
A new mapping system is currently 
undergoing field trials. It promises to great- 
ly reduce. the time needed to make, 
measurements. The system uses acoustic 
signals to replace measuring tapes. The 
diver holds a wand-like device wherever he 
wants a measurement. When he pulls a 
trigger, acoustic pulses travel out to receiv- 
ers at carefully surveyed locations. The 
travel time of the pulses is converted into a 
distance measurement by a computer on the 
surface, which then calculates the location 
of the point in space. To achieve the neces- 
sary accuracy of less than a centimetre, the 
system must continually measure and adjust 
for the speed of sound in the water. The 
equipment is compact and portable. The 
system is so fast and accurate that the diver 
can sign his name on the computer screen 
simply by holding down the trigger and 
“writing” with the wand. 
As computers become smaller, cheaper, 
and more powerful, they are increasingly 
being used in the field of underwater 
archaeology. This is not to say that 
archaeologists have not been using com- 
puters. University mainframe computers 
have been used for a number of years for 
archaeological database management— 
storing, sorting, analysing and displaying 
information on artefacts and sites. The data 
are brought in from the field on standard 
reporting forms. Recently, however, more 
and more archaeologists have been taking 
either terminals or small computers into the 
field so that data can be sent back to the 
mainframe computer over telephone lines 
on a daily basis. 
With the advent of portable, battery- 
powered microcomputers, field uses are 
starting to go far beyond simple cataloguing 
tasks. Underwater measurements can be 
entered into the computer on site to be 
converted into useful co-ordinates for im- 
mediate plotting or display on a graphics 
screen. This provides both on-the-spot 
error checking and a tool for site planning. 
The role of computers as an integral part of 
archaeological fieldwork is one that should 
show rapid development in the next few 
years. [|

A sunken ship is a “time capsule” of life at 
sea, frozen at a moment in the past. 
These 3 photos show a silver pocket watch 
recovered by Australian archaeologists 
from the remains of HMS Pandora, which * 
foundered on Australia’s Great Barrier 
Reef on 29 August 1791 with the loss of 35 
men. Pandora had been sent to Tahiti in 
1790 by the British Admiralty to capture 
the mutineers who had seized HMS Bounty 
the previous year and “bring them to con- 
dign punishment”, She went down on her 
return voyage to England with 14 
mutineers manacled inside a deckhouse 
cell. 
The watch, thought to have belonged to 
the ship's surgeon because it had a 
second hand useful for taking a patient’s 
pulse, was brought up in a wet container. 
An X-ray showed that most of its works 
were still intact. It had stopped at 12 min- 
utes and 20 seconds past 11. Pandora 
sank at 6:30 A.M. and so the watch may 
have been stopped by the shock of impact 
when the ship hit the reef the night before 
or by rising waters when she began to fill. 
Remarkably preserved, the watch was 
conserved and restored by Jon Carpenter, 
conservator of the Pandora expedition, 
and rebuilt nearly to working condition 
(below right) by an antiquarian watch- 
maker, Hugh Whitwell.

Photos on this double page spread show 
some of the processes and techniques of 
underwater archaeology today, from sur- 
veying and excavation to conservation. 
1. Laying down the line. Before excava- 
tions can take place, an accurate survey of 
the site is made to record archaeological 
material and the environmental situation. 
Site planning before and during excava- 
tion is usually done with the aid of a site 
grid made using poles or line (see also 
photo page 28). 
2. Making measurements. Detailed site 
plans often involve measuring the posi- 
tion of objects by taking the distance at 
. right angles to the main grid line. The diver 
at right is carefully noting the distances. 
3. By swimming along lines strung be- 
tween two fixed points, divers can inspect 
the sea-bed for archaeological material. 
Intensive surveying and plotting with re- 
covery of selected items for dating evi- 
dence can identify new sites worthy of 
further investigation. 
4. Underwater vacuum cleaners called air- 
lifts are commonly used to remove sedi- 
ment from the site. They come in all sizes. 
The equivalent of the wheelbarrow on 
land, they should only be used to remove 
sediment and not the evidence embedded 
in it. 
5. The rim of a pot gradually appears as 
divers carefully remove the topmost layer 
of sediment with a vacuum hose. The di- 
ver's hand is the most sensitive working 
tool of all. 
6. Drawing underwater is done with an 
ordinary pencil on a sheet of underwater 
drawing film. Meticulous records need to 
be made of archaeological sites under wa- 
ter just as on land, since all archaeology is 
destructive. Once the excavation is com- 
plete the only record is that produced on 
paper and film. 
7. Stereophotogrammetry (making plans 
by computer from stereophotographs) 
may be used to produce a 3-dimensional 
record of parts of a site or even of com- 
plete hulls, ] 
8. Underwater archaeologists are not sole- 
ly concerned with shipwrecks. They also 
explore sites once occupied by prehistoric 
man in inland waters or submerged on the 
continental shelf. Here, divers record data 
and prepare to recover a mastodon tusk 
from a North Florida river. 
9. Archaeologists and divers working at 
great depths face the danger of decom- 
pression sickness, commonly known as 
“the bends”, which can Kill or paralyse. 
Photo shows a submersible decompress- 
ion chamber (SDC) used at Yassi Ada (Tur- 
key) inthe late 1960s by George Bass and a 
team from the University of Pennsylvania. 
By allowing four divers at a time to de- 
compress, the SDC permitted longer daily 
dives. 
10. A diver uses a pneumatic saw to cut off 
a piece of the hull of a wreck off Gabon for 
study ashore. 
11. Air-filled bags are used for raising 
heavy objects to the surface. 
12, Deep water sites are now becoming 
accessible thanks to technological de- 
velopments in the field of off-shore en- 
gineering. Here, a diver clad in a revolu- 
tionary “wearable” submarine. Such 
equipment circumvents decompression 
problems. 
13. The Bremen Cog. Reassembly of this 
medieval ship from about 2,000 pieces of 
waterlogged timber took 7 years. 
14. Inside the hull of the Sohar, a full-size 
replica of a medieval Arab ship (see photo 
story page 23). The workmen are using 
mops dipped in vegetable oil to preserve 
the coir (rope made of hand-twisted coco- 
nut fibres) used to lash the ship's timbers 
together.

### 76555: Fair copies: modern replicas of ancient vessels

Modern replicas 
  
of ancient vessels 
The sea trials of full-scale replicas of a num- 
ber of ancient ships have successfully de- 
monstrated the seaworthiness of early craft 
as well as contributed to our knowledge of 
naval construction techniques and the art of 
navigation. (1) In 1987, for the first time in 
over 2,000 years, a trireme of the Greek 
navy cut through the waters of the 
Mediterranean. The trireme, a reputedly 
invincible, fast and manoeuvrable warship 
with three tiers of oarsmen on each side, was 
fundamental to the naval strength of Ancient 
Greece. The modern replica, named Qlym- 
pia, was built in a Greek naval shipyard to a 
design by a team of British researchers. As 
no remains of a trireme have ever been 
- found, the designers relied on descriptions 
by classical writers, surviving illustrations 
of the ships, and experience gained from 
other ancient shipwrecks. The warship, 37 
m long and over 5 m broad, displaces 1.5 m 
of water for 45 tons weight and is armed with 
a bronze ram at the bow. She soon showed 
her paces, reaching a speed of 7 knots in her 
first sea trials, propelled by a crew of almost 
200 rowers. Use of the trireme will lead to a 
better understanding of the tactics employed 
by the Ancient Greek fleet. The Sohar (see 
colour page left) is a replica of an 8th-cen- 
tury Arab trading ship or boom. In this 
vessel, with a crew including 8 Omani sea- 
men, navigator Tim Severin made a 7- 
month voyage of almost 10,000 km, from 
Muscat to Canton, following the route of 
Sindbad, the legendary Arab sailor and hero 
of The Thousand and One Nights. (2) Tim 
Severin uses an early Arab navigation in- 
strument, the kamal. A wooden rectangle 
pierced by a knotted string, the kamal is a 
kind of sextant for calculating latitude from 
the position of a selected star above the 
horizon. (3) The Kyrenia II, an authentic

### 76556: Law and the underwater heritage

Law and the underwater heritage 
24 
by Lyndel V. Prott 
and Patrick J. O’Keefe 
N international consensus is de- 
A veloping that States should take 
special steps to ensure the protec- 
tion of their underwater heritage. Apart 
from international agreements by which 
States have undertaken actively to ensure 
the protection of the cultural heritage 
generally, such as the European Conven- 
tion on the Protection of the Archaeological 
Heritage; Unesco Convention for the Pro- 
tection of Cultural Property in the Event of 
Armed Conflict; Unesco Convention on the 
Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the 
Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Own- 
ership of Cultural Property; Unesco Con- 
vention Concerning the Protection of the 
World Cultural and Natural Heritage; OAS 
(Organization of American States) Con- 
vention on the Protection of the Archaeolo- 
gical, Historical and Artistic Heritage of the 
American Nations, there is also a Unesco 
Recommendation which deals specifically 
with the underwater cultural heritage. This 
is the Recommendation on International 
Principles Applicable to Archaeological 
Excavations (1956). It applies to “any re- 
search aimed at the discovery of objects of 
archaeological character” whether on land 
“or on the bed or in the subsoil of inland or 
terntonal waters of a Member State™. 
The Recommendation includes some de- 
tailed provisions on the control of excava- 
tions, the admission of foreigners for 
archaeological work, the keeping of a cen- 
tral register of important sites, the forma- 
tion of collections, disposal of finds, rights 
and duties of the excavator, documentation 
of excavations and the suppression of clan- 
destine excavations. The Recommenda- 
tion, according to the Constitution and 
Rules of Procedure of Unesco, obliges 
Member States of Unesco to implement it 
and to report the methods taken to give 
effect to it. European and other States 
bordering the Mediterranean should also be 
aware of a major initiative of the Council of 
Europe to strengthen legal protection of the 
underwater cultural heritage in the Euro- 
pean and Mediterranean areas. 
In studying all these materials, States 
may not only feel a responsibility or an 
obligation to legislate promptly on this 
issue, but will also find guidance as to the 
type of provisions that should be included. 
There are two legislation schemes which 
have been very widely used to provide 
permanent legal protection: these are, first, 
the extension of general antiquities legisla- 
tion to underwater finds and, second, the 
drafting of special legislation solely to cover 
submarine antiquities (meaning those 
under the sea) or other antiquities under 
water where these are significant. Certain 
schemes have been based on the extension 
of other types of legislation toicover the 
underwater cultural heritage: most of these 
appear to have some disadvantage. 
The major advantage in having specific 
legislation on the underwater cultural herit- 
age is the practical one of easy accessibility. 
For the most part, those who do damage to 
shipwrecks are divers, fishermen or em- 
ployees of oil or cable-laying companies 
involved in underwater operations. Many 
of these have little legal knowledge. 
Divers, both amateur and professional, 
and particularly those interested in ship- 
wrecks, are often said to be of independent 
character, resourceful and sceptical of au- 
thority. They come from a variety of back- 
grounds, from the highly educated to the 
lowly. Nevertheless, they have a common 
tendency to regard what they find under 
water as their own, a product of their skill 
and effort and something that only they can 
work on, by whatever means they consider 
fit. Itisimportant 10 seek their co-operation 
and not to arouse their resentment. 
On the other hand, fishermen in most 
cases do damage by dragging their ncts 
along the sea bottom, scattering surface 
remains and obliterating sites, as well as 
raising objectsin theirnets. In recent years, 
the surveying and trenching of the sea floor 
for pipelines or cables has led to the unin- 
tentional discovery of many wrecks. It is 
important that such finds be reported and 
identified, and requirements to that effect 
should be written intd'évery national permit 
system. 
Philippines law provides that any 
accidental discoveries made “in the course 
of agricultural and engineering works, 
minéral and marine explorations” shall be 
reported and further work immediately sus- 
pended. Norway and Thailand have also 
expressly created a duty to report for such 
operators. In all cases, the best protection 
of the underwater cultural heritage lies in 
education and in persuasion of the diver, 
fisherman, oil worker or cable layer of the 
cultural value of what is found @ffioticed. 
This will be done most easily if reference 
can besnade to,a single piece of legislation 
which is easily accessible physically and 
associated by name: one in which rights and 
duties are set out concisely, without ambi- 
guity or the need to refer to other legal 
Provisions, 
The extension of general antiquities leg- 
or 
Lb 
islation to the underwater cultural heritage 
is an alternative which has been adopted by 
some States which already have compre- 
hensive legislation on land antiquities (e.g. 
Greece and Turkey). There is no legal 
reason why the cover provided by general 
antiquities legislation should not be as 
strong: the advantages of specific legislation 
are, as we have mentioned, practical ones. 
There are a number of other States that 
have not made the extension specifically 
"but whose system of classification and pro- 
tection would be suitable to cover impor- 
tant finds. Such an extension of existing 
legislation would net, however, ensure 
accessibility and publicity. Nor is this pat- 
tern of action helpful where general anti- 
quities legislation is not so well developed. 
Although many States have comprehen- 
sive legislation to protect the underwater 
cultural heritage, and even those that do not 
have other legislative weapons in hand to 
protect them from the spoliator, the cultu- 
ral authorities should not become com- 
placent. Many will recognize that there are 
much stronger prowisions that could be— 
and should be—included in their national 
legislation. This is an urgent task for all 
national cultural authorities in countries 
where the underwater cultural heritage is 
under threat. Thege are two other impor- 
tant tasks which would increase legal pro- 
tection: one, the signing of international 
agreements on this subject; the other, the 
requiring of all those working on the sea- 
bed for any purpose 10 observe and report 
finds of interest. The best level of protec- 
tion will be achieved by a judicious blend of 
strong legal provisions and an effort to 
make people everywhere aware of the incal- 
culable value of the cultural inheritance of

### 76557: The Amphora war: looting of ancient shipwrecks is widespread, how can it be stopped?

Looting of ancient shipwrecks is widespread. 
How can it be stopped? 
The amphora war 
ORE than 2,000 years ago, Greek 
M and Roman galleys sailed the 
Mediterranean Sea loaded with 
goods for trade or soldiers for conquest. 
Today, off the coasts of Italy, Spain, and 
France, hundreds of these ancient ship- 
‘wrecks, sunk for centuries, are being pi- 
rated by clandestine salvagers and deep-sea 
divers. In the past twenty years in France 
alone almost 400 shipwrecks from the 
Greek and Roman eras have been found. 
All but three had been pillaged before being 
discovered by the authorities. 
The statues, art works, precious metals 
and amphoras found on these ships supply 
an international market of private buyers. 
The publicity surrounding the volume of 
this trade, soaring prices, the aggressive 
promotion by auction houses. and con- 
tinued record-breaking sums have done 
much to promote this illegal traffic, And it 
has led to violence. Rival gangs are known 
to have burned each other’s boats, and over 
twenty divers, some very experienced, have 
been found dead due to dangerous clandes- 
tine working conditions in deep water or 
outright ‘murder. In the South of France 
they call it the Amphora War. 
For hundreds of years, men tried to in- 
vent ways of getting to sunken ships with 
little or no success. With the invention of 
the scuba tank, a practical solution was 
found. 
It was one of the inventors of the scuba 
tank, Jacques Cousteau, who excavated the 
first ancient ship from the sea floor. In 1954, 
diving down 60 metres off the Grand Con- 
gloué island in the Mediterranean near the 
city of Marseilles he found an ancient Ro- 
‘man shipwreck sunk in the second century 
BC. Two thousand ampheras were disco- 
vered on the ship. Cousteau’s divers simply 
raised them to the surface and drew no 
plans of the site, but this first expedition led 
to the birth of underwater. archaeology. 
On land, wholesale plundering of ancient 
artefacts had been going on since the eight- 
eenth century. Today, treasure hunters 
spend more time searching under the sea_ 
than on land. 
In France, the police responsible for en- 
forcement of the laws protecting under- 
water archaeological sites are under the 
authority of the Customs Service. With a 
fleet of 20 boats, 12 helicopters and 3 aero- 
planes, the Customs agents regularly patrol 
the areas of known underwater archaeolo- 
gical sites. Aircraft spottings are reported 
to patrol boats that are equipped with radar 
and armed with sub-machine guns. But. as 
Commandant Riviere, head of Customs 
from the Mediterranean coastline from Ita- 
ly to the Spamish border and the island of 
Corsica, has pointed out, “. . . The fight to 
prevent the pirating of underwater wrecks 
is only a small part of our activity because 
our main job is aimed against drugs and 
_terrorists. 
“Guarding underwater archaeological 
wrecks is very difficult because there are a 
lot of wreck sites and 1tis impossible to put a 
“Customs officer on every site, and if you are 
not there to catch someone red handed 
bringing up an artefact, then most probably 
the pirate cannot be prosecuted.” 
The major problems facing the preserva- 
tion of ancient shipwreck sites are the ex- 
pense of an excavation, the tediouS weeks at 
sea, around-the-clock security to protect 
the site from pirates, and the health dangers 
of decompression from repeated deep-wa- 
ter diving. Since diving can be done only 
seven months a year off the coast of France, 
unfinished excavations must be burred in 
hundreds of tons of sand to protectithem 
from pirates during the winter months, and 
then painstakingly uncovered the following 
year before new work can begin. a

new video programme entitled Amphora War. A 
Unesco-Cross Communications Europe co-pro- 
duction, the 26-minute video reviews the ques- 
tion of piracy of amphoras and other artefacts off 
the coast of southern France and the measures 
being taken by Unesco for the protection of the 
underwater heritage. For further information

nan (“The Royal Crown”) was lost 
in battle off the coast of south-east 
Sweden on 1 June 1676. Her keel had been 
laid in 1665 and she had been launched in 
1668, entering service four years later in 
T- Swedish man of war HMS Kro- 
1672. The first three-decked ship built in. 
Sweden, she displaced 2,140 tons. Her 
length was 55 metres, and she carried 126 
cannons. At the time of the disaster her 
crew consisted of approximately 850 men. 
In the mid-seventeenth century, Sweden 
was a great power with the general strategic 
ambition of controlling the Baltic Sea and 
the shores around it, thus creating a closed 
inner sea—a “Mare Claustrum”. In 1675 
the Swedish provinces on continental 
Europe were attacked by Brandenburg. In 
the same year, war broke out between 
Denmark and Sweden, and in the spring of 
1676 the Swedish navy set sail for the south- 
ern Baltic in order to find and destroy the 
Danish fleet which was ravaging the Swed- 
ish islands. 
The first battle between the enemy fleets 
was fought between the islands of 
   
  
Bornholm and Riigen during the night of 25 
May. In spite of the Swedish superiority in 
numbers, the Danes escaped, and were a 
few days later joined by a Dutch squadron. 
The Dutch became a Danish ally to prevent 
Sweden gaining total control of the 
Baltic. 
The Swedes had acted in confusion dur- 
ing the battle, and consequently the king 
ordered the fleet to seek battle closer to the 
Swedish mainland, hoping that a possible 
disaster could be avoided if the ships could 
seek refuge in Swedish ports. 
On the morning of 1 June 1676, the Swed- 
ish fleet, over sixty ships strong, was sailing 
northwards in a southwesterly gale along 
the coast of Oland. Off the village of Hul- 
terstad, the Svdrdet (“The Royal Sword”), 
the flagship of the second squadron, fired a 
gunshot either as a signal to call the fleet 
closer together, or as a request to turn 
against the enemy who were closing up from 
behind. 
Without responding to the Svérdet’s shot, 
the Kronan turned with the wind without 
taking in sail. Suddenly, the ship heeled

over and began to capsize. The crew tried 
desperately to pull the guns in through the 
gunports, but in vain. The ship capsized, 
- and shortly afterwards was shaken by an 
explosion in which the starboard side was 
blown to pieces. Within a few minutes, the 
Kronan had sunk with the loss of 800 lives. 
Only forty men survived the disaster. 
The wreck of the Kronan caused total 
confusion in the Swedish fleet. Only a few 
ships remained to continue the battle, 
among them the Svdrdet, which fought 
heroically for several hours before being set 
on fire by a fireship. The result of the battle 
was disastrous for the Swedes: the loss of 
the two largest ships in the Swedish navy 
and 1,500 seamen. 
In the 1950s, Anders Franzen began a 
programme to find twelve Swedish men-of- 
war sunk in the Baltic in the sixteenth and 
seventeenth centuries. Franzen had real- 
ized that because of climatic and other natu- 
ral conditions, the Baltic is a treasure-house 
for the underwater archaeologist. 
First ofall, the Baltic is within the con- 
tinental shelf area and only parts of it are 
Pieces of richly carved woodwork are

ing excavations of the Kronan. Left, a cher- 
ub from the admiral’'s quarters photo- 
graphed as it lay among the wreckage.

deeper than 100 metres. Both the coastal 
waters and large areas of the sea bottom are 
accessible for ordinary diving—up to a 
depth of 50 metres. Secondly, wood-des- 
troying organisms such as shipworm 
(Teredo navalis) are less prevalent than in 
warmer, saltier waters such as the 
Mediterranean. In fact the whole of the 
Baltic is free of damage by shipworm. 
In 1956, Franzen discovered the Wasa in 
the waters of Stockholm harbour where she 
had sunk at the start of her maiden voyage 
in 1628. After an unprecedented rescue 
operation the Wasa was raised from the 
sea-bed and towed away to a museum site in 
1961 (see page 14). 
In 1980, after making a systematic survey 
including the use of side-scan sonar, proton- 
magnetometer and low-light television, 
Franzen and his team discovered the Kro- 
nan just over 6 nautical miles off the east 
coast of Oland, at a depth of 26 metres. 
The first sight which met the divers was 
that of a broken wreck, not a Wasa. But the 
sediments of the site would later prove to 
contain thousands of artefacts originally be- 
longing to the crew, representing a seven- 
teenth century .in miniature encapsulated 
and deep frozen at noon on 1 June 1676. 
In 1981, archaeological investigation of 
the Kronan began, supervised by the Kal- 
mar County Museum. The investigated cen- 
tral area of the wrecksite is divided into 
twenty squares of 10 metres a side. The 
squares comprise a system of co-ordinates, 
each corner being marked with a white 
cross and identified with a letter-number 
combination. These codes are needed to

describe the location of a recovered object 
and are also helpful in photographic and 
search-work. 
A further refinement in excavation is the 
use of a portable plastic grid, divided into 
squares. The grid as a whole is fitted into 
the general system of co-ordinates before 
excavation is begun, and then makes the 
work of describing the location of recovered 
artefacts easier. This method is used in 
combination with triangular measuring and 
has proved to be efficient at this stage of the 
excavation. 
The actual excavation work is done with 
an airlift, a sort of underwater vacuum 
cleaner. It uses compressed air to draw up 
the sediment, thus revealing objects and 
parts of the ship, by preventing everything 
from being obscured in a cloud of mud. The 
divers pick up the objects recovered in this 
way, while the sediment, sand and gravel 
drawn up with the compressed air are sieved 
on deck, so that smaller objects are also 
recovered. 
Important aids in the underwater docu- 
mentation process are waterproof sketching 
equipment, underwater cameras and— 
perhaps most important—an underwater 
video camera. Documenting the excava- 
tions with low-light video is a very conve- 
nient method of obtaining maximum input 
of immediate visual information at a re- 
latively low cost. Communication between 
Emm divers and the surface is carried out by diver

Excavating and documenting the port side 
of the Kronan, which lies flat on the sea- 
bed. The plastic grid divided into squares 
enables the location of objects to be pre- 
cisely recorded. Upright forms in back- 
ground are broken deck-beams. 
The divers use only dry-suits, meaning - 
they wear insulating overalls under their 
diving suits and remain dry. This prevents 
the diver from being exposed to the cold 
waters of the Baltic, which seldom exceeds 
8°C at this depth. This is a most important 
safety measure. 
Diving time at a depth of 26 metres with 
compressed air is relatively limited. Each 
diver does two descents a day, with an 
effective diving time of from 50 to 70 
minutes, depending on whether decom- 
pression in water is being used. 
When the excavations began in 1981, the 
first method used was to dig test-pits in 
strategic areas of the wreck-site, in order to 
determine the area of the find and the ship’s 
constructional elements. The archaeolog- 
ists immediately realized that a tremendous 
number of artefacts were preserved in the 
sediment and, thanks to the wood-preserv- 
ing conditions of the Baltic, noticed the 
remarkable richness of the exposed parts of 
the ship. Kronan clearly offered a unique 
opportunity to study life on board a big 
seventeenth-century battleship. 
In 1984, after three seasons of excava- 
tions, a new method succeeded the test-pit

method. Continuous, systematic excava- 
tion starting from identified constructions 
on the port side began. The choice of 
method was based on the knowledge 
obtained from the previous tests, which led 
to a theory concerning the deterioration 
process and the present state of the wreck. 
At the time of the disaster, Kronan was 
heading north in a strong south-western 
gale. The ship turned with full sails, heeled 
over on her port side, capsized and turned 
around in the wind. This is proved by the 
ship’s position on the sea-bed. The great 
explosion in the powder-storage room must 
have blown the entire starboard side away, 
since this was the direction of the shock- 
wave. The vessel probably broke athwart- 
ships at this stage, forward of the main 
mast, which explains the absence of the 
bow. Thus, approximately two-thirds of the 
length of the port side, from the stern for- 
‘ward, is preserved. 
After the explosion, Kronan sank rapid- 
ly. When she reached the sea floor, she 
immediately rested on her port side. This is 
indicated by in situ findings of internal port 
side sculptures, originally decorating the 
walls of the admiral’s quarters, astern on 
the upper gun-deck. The sculptures were 
originally nailed to the wall with iron nails, 
which rusted away soon after the ship- 
wreck. The sculptures still remain in their 
original positions. 
One consequence of this must be that the 
external sculptures of the port side stern 
castle are also likely to be still in their 
original positions, embedded in the anaero- 
bic, ‘glacial clay. We hope that future ex- 
cavations will prove this. 
Since she was the first three-decked ship 
ever built in Sweden, Kronan is likely to 
show unique constructional details. Some 
interesting features have already been

observed. However, the outstanding asset 
of Kronan is the tremendous richness of the 
artefacts found on her. As of 1986, approx- 
imately 15 per cent of the area of the wreck- 
site had been excavated. More than 12,000 
artefacts have been salvaged. They range 
from everyday utensils, personal belong- 
ings, weaponry, navigational instruments, 
sculpture, and musical instruments to a 
medicine chest and the largest find of gold 
coins ever made in Sweden. 
Perhaps the most interesting finds are the 
sculptures which are in remarkably good 
condition. One can still see in detail how the 
artist has shaped the piece of wood with his 
tools. The relatively gentle conservation 
process of freeze-drying ensures that the 
original features of the wooden sculptures 
remain. The reconstruction of the sculptu- 
ral features of the Kronan is one of the 
greatest achievements of the investigation. 
Since the excavation began, a Kronan 
exhibition has been open to the public at the 
Kalmar County Museum. More than 
200,000 people have seen the exhibition so 
far. 
Apart from the main archaeological pur- 
pose of the Kronan investigations, the site 
has also become a melting pot for interna- 
tional underwater archaeology. Each year 
marine archaeologists from different coun- 
tries and institutions are invited to take part 
in the work and exchange experiences. The 
Baltic in general, and Kronan in particular, 
offer a unique opportunity for underwater 
archaeological work under extremely good 
conditions. [|

The Convention on the Law of the Sea 
and marine archaeology 
Adopted on 30 April 1982 by the United 
Nations Conference on the Law of the 
Sea (by 130 votes to 4, with 17 absten- 
tions) the Convention on the Law of the 
Sea lays down rules for all parts and 
virtually all uses of the oceans. Articles 
149 and 303, the texts of which are 
given below, relate specifically to 
archaeology. 
Article 149 
Archaeological and historical objects 
All objects of an archaeological and 
historical nature found in the Area” 
shall be preserved or disposed of for 
the benefit of mankind as a whole, 
particular regard being paid to the 
preferential rights of the State or 
country of origin, or the State of 
cultural origin, or the State of histor- 
ical and archaeological origin. 
Article 303 
Archaeological and 
historical objects found at sea 
1. States have the duty to protect ob- 
jects of an archaeological and historic- 
al nature found at sea and shall co- 
operate for this purpose. 
2. In order to control traffic in such 
objects, the coastal State may, in ap- 
plying article 33", presume that their 
removal from the sea-bed in the zone 
referred to in that article without its 
approval would result in an infringe- 
ment within its territory or territorial 
sea of the laws and. regulations re- 
ferred to in that article. 
3. Nothing in this article affects the 
rights of identifiable owners, the law 
of salvage or other rules of admiralty, 
or laws and practices with respect to 
cultural exchanges. 
4. This article is without prejudice to 
other international agreements and 
rules of international law regarding 
the protection of objects of an 
archaeological and historical nature. 
* Article 1 
Use of terms and scope 
1. For the purposes of this «.avention: 
(1) “Area” means the sea-bed and ocean floor 
and subsoil thereof, beyond the limits of 
national jurisdiction; 
** Article 33 
Contiguous zone 
1. In a zone contiguous to its territorial sea 
described as the contiguous zone, the coastal 
State may exercise the control necessary to: 
(a) prevent infringement of its customs, 
fiscal, immigration or sanitary laws and reg- 
ulations within its territory or territorial sea; 
(b) punish infringement of the above laws. 
and regulations committed within its terri- 
tory or territorial sea.

### 76559: Herod's great harbour

Ancient Caesarea, now submerged beneath the Mediterranean, 
was an amazing feat of engineering 
wanna Herod’s great harbour 
é OW King Herod observed a 
N place near the sea, which was 
very proper for containing a 
city, and was before called Strato’s Tower. 
. and what was the greatest and most 
laborious work of all, he adorned it with a 
haven that was always free from the waves 
of the sea. ... The king, by the expenses he 
was at, and the liberal disposal of them, 
overcame nature and built the haven larger 
than at Piracus and it had towards the city a 
double station for the ships. It was of excel- 
lent workmanship: and this was more re- 
markable for its being built in a place that of 
itself was not suitable to such noble struc- 
tures, but was brought to perfection by 
materials from other places, and at very 
great expense. This city is situated in 
Phoenicia, in the passage to Egypt, between 
Jaffo and Dor, which are lesser maritime 
cities and not fit for havens, on account of 
the impetuous south-west winds that beat 
upon them, which rolling the sands that 
come from the sea gainst the shores do not 
admit of ships lying in their station; but the 
merchants are generally forced there toride 
at their anchors in the sea itself. So Herod 
endeavoured to rectify this inconvenience, 
and laid out a compass towards the land as 
might be sufficient for a haven, wherein the 
great ships might lie down in safety; and this 
he effected by letting down vast stones into 
twenty fathoms of water, most of them 
being fifty feet in length, and nine in height 
and ten in breadth, and some still larger. 
But when the haven was filled up to that 
length, he enlarged that wall which was thus 
already extant above the sea, till it was two 
hundred feet wide; one hundred of which 
had buildings before it, in order to break the 
force of the waves; but the rest of the space 
was under a stone wall that ran around it. 
The name of Pilatus (Pontius Pilate), the » 
Roman procurator who tried Jesus Christ, £ 
is carved on this stone found at Caesarea. 
It may once have been affixed to a temple.

On this wall were very large towers. ... 
There was also a great number of arches 
where mariners dwelt. There was also be- 
fore them, a quay (or landing place), which 
ran round the entire haven, and was a most 
agreeable walk to such as had a mind to that 
exercise; but the entrance or mouth of the 
port was made on the north quarter, on 
which side was the stillest of the winds of all 
this place. ... At the mouth of the haven 
were on each side three great Colossi sup- 
ported by pillars, where those Colossi that 
are on your left hand as you sail into the port 
are supported by a solid tower; but those on 
the right hand are supported by two upright 
stones joined together, which stones were 
larger than that tower which was on the 
other side of the entrance.” 
These words were written almost 2,000 
years ago by the Jewish historian Josephus 
Flavius and constitute what may be the most 
detailed description of an ancient harbour. 
In 1975 this hidden wonder of ancient hyd- 
raulic technology began to be studied by the 
Centre for Maritime Studies of the Uni- 
versity of Haifa, and since 1980 the project 
has been carried out by the Caesarea 
Ancient Harbour Excavations Project, with 
the participation of the universities of Col- 
orado, Maryland and Victoria (British Col- 
umbia). Every summer, over one hundred 
diving volunteers from all over the world,

archaeologists, diving technicians, marine 
engineers and architects take part in what 
may be the largest underwater excavation 
of its kind. 
Though the work is far from being com- 
pleted, it has already yielded scores of data 
that not only verify Josephus’ testimony but 
add surprising facts about the standards of 
harbour technology of that time. Not only 
was this the first protected basin to be artifi- 
cially encompassed by free-standing 
breakwaters not based on any headland, 
‘natural bay or off-shore reefs, but those 
structures were so designed that their inter- 
nal side was properly protected from the 
"splash of breaking storm waves to 
accommodate mooring facilities for their 
entire length. 
The main breakwaters were built in a 
unique combination of carefully laid huge 
ashlar blocks fastened with iron clamps 
(held by molten lead that was poured into 
grooves at the edges of the ashlar blocks 
when they were already in place under the 
water) and artificial hydraulic conglomer- 
ate that slowly solidified within double 
walled wooden caissons that were lowered 
to their proper position by the careful addi- 
tion of a specially blended mixture of hyd-

raulic concrete made of lime, red soil, and 
volcanic pumice, in between the double 
wooden walls. 
In order to save building material in the 
construction of the submerged part of the 
breakwater (the total volume of the under- 
water base must have been around 200,000 
cubic metres) the caissoned blocks and the 
ashlar walls were installed only at the exter- 
nal, internal, midsection and cross-sections 
of the breakwaters, with hollowed compart- 
ments of 20 x 30 metres left for the sea to fill 
with wave-carried sand. In this way, after a 
few years, the filled sections could be paved 
and built on. 
Other sophisticated measures were taken 
in order to prevent what seems to be the 
constant problem of all modern protected 
basins along this coastline, silting up and 
the deposition of sand. This natural process 
was prevented by the creation of a constant 
current through the harbour entrance. This 
current was initiated by a series of channels 
through the stem of the main breakwater. 
These channels would have an opening just 
above the highest tide, so there would be 
only an inflow of silt-free water generated 
by each incoming wave-front. The flow in 
the channels could be controlled by sluice-

The archaeological proof that this system 
was properly working was deduced from the 
thin layer of fine silt with Herodian pottery 
sherds all over the harbour bottom which 
represents a sandfree basin during the time 
when the harbour was intact and func- 
tioning. The same kind of layer, with an 
abundance of clay vessels and other small 
finds dating from the Roman period, was 
found just outside the harbour entrance. It 
was over 1.5 metres thick and had been 
swept there by the outflowing current. 
Technologically, the Caesarea project is 
the culmination of twenty-five years of 
marine archaeological exploration and re- 
search. It encompasses land and underwa- 
ter excavations and includes sampling of 
bio-species, minerals and sediments for 
laboratory analysis. The results will contri- 
bute to knowledge of ancient environ- 
mental changes, land-sea relations, 
ancient marine engineering and harbour 
technologies. [|

Beringia 
During the last 2 million years, vast accu- 
mulations of ice covered extensive parts of 
the Earth and melted again about 20 times, 
each Ice Age lasting around 100,000 years. 
Each time that the ice sheets reached their 
maximum extent, the additional volume of 
water extracted from the ocean was about 40 
million cubic kilometres, This resulted in a 
drop in sea level of about 100 metres. 
Archaeologists have been aware for several 
decades that the lower sea levels during the 
Ice Ages created a larger living space for 
Stone Age tribes of the Palaeolithic (over 
10,000 years ago), and that migrations be- 
tween continents and islands were promoted 
by the creation of “land bridges” or narrow 
straits. Marine archaeologists are now 
studying submerged prehistoric sites on the 
continental shelf and have established 
beyond doubt that human occupation did 
take place below the present sea level, Study 
of “land bridges” may shed new light on one 
of the most important (and still poorly 
understood) processes of human history, the 
colonization of the Earth’s continents by 
early man after his evolution in East Africa 
1.5 million years ago. In the following art- 
icle, a Soviet specialist, Nikolai N. Dikov, 
describes one of these land bridges, the 
ancient landmass known as Beringia which 
in prehistoric times stretched from Siberia 
to Alaska. 


### 76560: Beringia: a prehistoric 'intercontinental highway' between Asia and America

A prehistoric 
‘intercontinental highway’ 
between Asia 
and America 
NLIKE the mysterious Atlantis, Be- 
\ | ringia actually existed. Like Atlan- 
tis, it was submerged by the sea. 
This happened gradually about 10,000 years 
ago, as the huge glaciers of the last great Ice 
Age melted. The level of the Pacific Ocean 
rose as much as 200 metres at that time, and 
the vast depression between Chukotka and 
Alaska was inundated. Since then, the wa- 
ters of the Bering and Chukotkan seas and 
of the Bering Strait, which joins them, have 
intermingled here. 
The honour of making the definitive dis- 
covery (in the 1960s) of this huge land-mass 
which is now under water belongs to the 
U.S. geologist David M. Hopkins, although 
the actual term “Beringia” was first used by 
a Soviet palaeozoologist, Petr P. Sushkin, 
by Nikolai N. Dikov

between the continents at times of low sea 
level during the Ice Ages, and the general 
directions of human migrations over mil- 
lions of years. 
in 1925, and as long as 200 years ago a 
Russian academician, Stepan P. Krashenin- 
nikov, had a general idea that there was 
some such land route between Asia and 
America. 
Subsequent scientific investigations con- 
firmed the existence of Beringia and en- 
abled us to chart the course of its rivers and 
lakes and to get an idea of what its climate 
and its fauna and flora must have been like. 
It was a flat plain, woody in the south, and 
with tundra and steppes in the north, where 
herds of mammoths and bison, wild horses 
and reindeer grazed. 
Curiously enough, Beringia appeared 
above water more than once during the Ice 
Ages, when much of the world’s water be- 
came concentrated in sheets of ice and as a 
result extensive shallows along the coasts 
(shelfs) became dry land. Glacial and in- 
terglacial periods alternated, and when the 
temperature rose, the ice melted and a strait 
appeared between Asia and America, 
where there had previously been dry land. 
At the beginning and end of the Ice Ages, 
each of which lasted several thousand 
years, there was a fairly wide bridge of land 
between the west and east parts of the sheet 
of ice. In these periods, too, there was a 
direct route by which animals and people 
could migrate from Asia to the interior of 
America, which was covered with glaciers. 
The main interest that Beringia holds for 
archaeologists lies in the question of the 
original settlement of America from Asia. 
In the :ilt that has accumulated at the 
bottom of tire sea, archaeologists expect to 
find tracks of Stone Age men who passed 
through on their way from Asia to America. 
 
Underwater operations are to begin very 
soon, but for the time being intensive 
archaeological prospecting and excavation 
work is being done on the approaches to the 
submerged land of Beringia, in Chukotka, 
Kamchatka, and Alaska. These investiga- 
tions are giving us'some idea of the stages in 
the migration of populations through Be- 
ringia and of the nature of their culture. 
They are also helping us to work out our 
strategy for the underwater archaeological 
searches that are to be undertaken, which 
will take account of the topographic and 
stratigraphic characteristics of the ancient 
sites that have been discovered in the im- 
mediate approaches to Beringia. 
Systematic searching was begun by the 
author of this article in 1961, after he had 
worked out a programme for archaeological 
investigations in the north-east with a view 
to solving the problem of the peopling of 
America. The excavations carried out so far 
have revealed a large number of 
Palaeolithic sites in Kamchatka and Chu- 
kotka, which are now the basic source of 
information for our study of the peopling of 
America through Beringia. 
Every year brings fresh evidence that this 
region, which was subsequently cut off from 
the centres of ancient civilization, was at 
that time not a backward, outlying part of 
the world but one of its great highways 
which, with Beringia, formed a wide bridge 
between what are now Asia and North 
America. 
Data obtained by Soviet and U.S. 
archaeologists enable us to distinguish, with 
different degrees of precision, four stagesin 
the peopling of Beringia. 
The first stage is as yet in many respects 
hypothetical, but logically necessary. It 
appears to correspond either to the penulti- 
mate Ice Age, known as the Ziryansk Ice 
Age (70,000-50,000 years ago) or to the 
beginning of the last Ice Age, known as the 
Sartansk Ice Age (28,000-20,000 years 
ago). This is the stage to which we may 
attribute both extremely ancient relicts that 
have been found in America, including 
.toughly chipped pebbles, and what appear 
to be prototypes of these ancient relicts 
"which have been found at sites in the Soviet 
Far East in Chukotka and elsewhere. 
The second stage, which is also largely 
hypothetical, corresponds to the period be- 
tween 14,000 and 20,000 years ago when 
Sartansk glaciation was most extensive and 
Beringia itself reached its maximum size. 
At this stage, its tundra-steppes, which 
were populated with megafauna, were a 
single natural zone, cut off from its sur-- 
roundings by glaciers to the west and east 
and by the relatively warm Pacific Ocean to 
the south. 
In this closed-in region it was probably 
some time before there was any differentia- 
tion between the two cultural zones—the 
continental zone, where huge mammals 
were hunted in the tundra-steppes, and the 
north Pacific zone, near the coast, where 
hunters, of whom little is known as yet, 
exploited the sea’s resources in a sporadic 
fashion. Technologically, this was still 
a united zone with a relatively uniform 
culture. 
The third stage, which is quite clearly 
defined, corresponds to the dispersal to the 
western approaches of Beringia, in Kam-

chatka, of the early Ushki culture, which is 
dated around 13,000-14,000 years ago and 
possibly earlier, judging by palaco-magne- 
tic dating. From this period on we can make 
fairly definite assertions about the cultural 
connections between Asia and America by 
way of Beringia—and also, perhaps, about 
population migration, when we think of the 
astonishing resemblance of Ushki stemmed 
bifacial stone points for missiles to those 
found in sites in the State of Washington, in 
the north-west of the USA. 
This was the last period when cultural 
connections and perhaps population migra- 
tions were possible entirely over dry land, 
because up to the beginning of the thir- 
teenth millennium Beringia was not divided 
by a strait. The north-west coast of North 
America could also be used to get from 
Beringia to America, which was covered 
with glaciers, for at that time the ‘glaciers 
had somewhat diminished in volume and 
were no longer a hindrance to population 
migration along the Pacific coast, particu- 
larly for populations which engaged in hunt- 
ing, fishing and gathering, as in the early 
Ushki culture. 
The fourth and much more clearly de- 
fined stage corresponds to the very end of 
the Sartansk Ice Age (12,000-10,000 years 
ago). It is connected with the further ero- 
sion and ecological reconstruction of Be- 
ringia—the broadening of the strait be- 
tween Chukotka and Alaska, the gradual 
swamping of the tundra-steppes and the 
reduction of the diversity of species and the 
number of megafauna. The main flow of 
migration to Beringia did not pass by the 
Emm north route in the direction of Yakutia 
34 (although this cannot be entirely excluded)

but by a south Pacific route in the direction 
of the northern part of what is now the 
Soviet Far East. 
Here there came into being a new culture 
which was based on fishing and bison-hunt- 
ing and could readily adapt to the new 
ecological conditions. This was the Late 
Ushki culture, which has been extensively 
studied in Kamchatka. It is characterized by 
large settlements, at the largest of which 
some thirty dwellings have already been 
excavated. These dwellings are quite diffe- 
rent from the large double tents of the early 
Ushki culture. 
There are also marked differences in 
stone implements. As well as the bifacial 
leaf-shaped non-stemmed points of mis- 
siles, forms of ornament much favoured by 
the Aleutians and the Eskimos have been 
found. A domestic dog burial has already 
been found, that of a dog like a husky. It is 
one of the most ancient burials in the 
Palaeolithic. Wedge-shaped cores are com- 
monly found. They are yet another indica- 
tion that there is a certain affinity between 
the Ushki culture and the Denali culture in 
Alaska, where the latter played its part in 
the formation of the proto-Eskimo Aleuts. 
When the proto-Eskimo Aleuts reached 
the southern part of Beringia, they de- 
veloped sea hunting more and more inten- 
sively. A factor that facilitated this was the 
considerable diminution in the size of Be- 
ringia (starting about 12,000 years ago). A 
strait gradually appeared, and boats had to 
be used to reach the eastern side. 
The Palaeolithic sites in Chukotka may 
be seen as intermediary stopping places on 
the way from Kamchatka to Beringia and 
beyond it to America. The same wedge-

shaped cores and bifacial weapon points 
have been found in them as in the Late 
Ushki culture in Kamchatka and the Denali 
culture in Alaska. This shows that popula- 
tion movement direct from Chukotka to 
Alaska took place 12,000-10,000 years ago, 
when Beringia began to get considerably 
smaller, until finally there was a strait where 
it had once been. 
Underwater archaeologists working in 
the submerged land of Beringia can expect 
to make fascinating discoveries. They can 
use the latest diving equipment available on’ 
vessels such as the Academician Nes- 
meyanov, which is registered at the Far East 
Department of the USSR Academy of Sci- 
ences. This vessel is equipped with the latest 
apparatus including a system for the adap- 
tive training of divers and remote control by 
television communication. It can carry out 
underwater operations at a depth of up to 
300 metres. 
As to the method of carrying out under- 
water investigations, what we have said 
about the pattern of the distribution of 
ancient sites in the parts of Beringia that 
were not submerged suggests that it would 
be advisable to begin—possibly by drill- 
ing—near the mouths of the river beds that 
have been found on the shelf. The success of 
these investigations is bound to be of great 
international scientific importance. [|

In August 1987, during an extensive under- 
water archaeological operation off the 
“Coast of Death”, Galicia, a team of 20 
archaeologists discovered the wreck of a 
ship which had taken part in a naval expedi- 
tion sent by King Philip II of Spain against 
England. Many of the ships, which set sail 
from Seville and Lisbon, were wrecked in 
October 1586 during a violent storm off 
Cape Finisterre. The archaeologists made 
600 individual dives and spent a total of 800 
hours under water at a maximum depth of 
25 metres. The excavation and recovery of 
some of the remains, which were located 
with the aid of magnetometers and un- 
covered by airlifts, was no easy task since 
the artefacts had fused together and were 
covered with concretion. The wooden 
wreckage had distintegrated, but it proved 
possible to recover a large anchor, some 
stone projectiles, a large quantity of small 
arms ammunition, and numerous coins 
(left), as well as pottery and personal acces- 
sories. Work in this veritable “ships’ 
graveyard” is to continue for several years.

although his method of excavation differs

The survey of a shipwreck discovered

Medemblik illustrates how underwater

such conditions. Maximum visibility on the

site was about 0.5 metres. An accurate 
drawing of the remains protruding from the 
bottom was prepared in the following way. 
Pins were set out in a rectangle, the longitu- 
dinal side of which was parallel to the main 
axis of the ship. The pins were spaced exact- 
ly 3 metres apart. They were connected by 
strings, thus forming a grid. This grid was 
simply an aid for orientation, no measure- 
ments being taken from the lines. Trilatera- 
tion measurements were taken from each 
set of two pins (see drawing bottom right). 
The measurements and all other data were 
recorded by speaking into a tape recorder. 
A pencil was only used to note certain speci- 
fic details. In this way trilateration was car- 
ried out in confined areas, approximately 
square in shape and the resulting drawings 
were fitted into a general plan which pro- 
vided an “overview” of this barely visible 
site. 
Next, three trial trenches were dug per- 
pendicular to the main axis in order to 
establish the midships, forward and aft sec- 
tions of the hull, and to provide a relatively 
clear picture of the construction of the ship. 
With little work done on site a maximum of 
information was retrieved. 
The find is of great interest from the point 
of view of shipbuilding techniques and tra- 
ditions. It combines features of the mediev- 
al cog with distinct differences in construc- 
tion. The underwater survey and trial ex- 
cavation have shown that the ship dates

from between the Middle Ages and modern 
times—a transitional period for the building 
of big ships. 
There are no plans for extended excava- 
tion of the site. Its importance has been 
assessed and it can and will be kept as it is, 
an object for scientific research in the dis- 
tant future. Why, it might be asked, wait so 
long if the site is so interesting? There are 
good reasons for this, 
Firstly, much of the scientific research on 
sites in the reclaimed land of the Zuiderzee 
and on ships such as the Bremen Cog has 
not yet been published. Only when it is shall 
we get a clear picture of what is known and 
of the gaps in our knowledge. Only then will 
it be possible to formulate up-to-date 
hypotheses which can be tested on sites that 
have been preserved and protected. 
Another reason is that there are many 
more sites than can be tackled scientifically 
at present. Whenever protection is feasible 
we should thus limit our curiosity to a good 
survey.

The Lazzaretto wreck, 
Sardinia 
The Underwater Archaeology Research 
Centre of Sassari and Alghero (CRASA) in 
Sardinia is an association of scuba divers 
which works in close collaboration with the 
Sardinian archaeological authorities and 
employs the scientific expertise of a profes- 
sional underwater archaeologist during ex- 
cavations. 
Its most important operation has been the 
complete excavation of the remains of a 
small Roman round ship which sank in the 
fourth century AD at Lazzaretto cove near 
Alghero. The wreck lay about 40 metres 
offshore at a depth of only 2.5 metres. Ex- 
cavations were carried out for 2 seasons in 
June 1985 and June 1986. 
Although the archaeological work has 
only just finished, we may already begin to 
draw some conclusions. The ship was 
loaded with preserved fish (in brine or 
dried) and garum (fish sauce) stowed in 
amphoras produced in northern Africa or 
southern Spain. One important find was a 
number of coins in a leather or cloth bag 
completely transformed by concretions. 
This small bag must have been affixed to its 
possessor’s waist. One of the coins became 
detached from the rest and left a perfect 
impression on the concretion, enabling us to 
conclude that it is a follis, struck during the 
reign of the Emperor Licinius and issued in 
AD 315-316. The shipwreck was caused by a 
southwesterly gale, but we cannot exclude 
an act of piracy.

Amateurs are welcome 
Ever since its birth in the early 1960s, 
Norwegian marine archaeology has de- 
pended heavily on the participation of 
amateur divers, and the museums co-oper- 
ate closely with the Norwegian Diving 
Association. Local diving clubs have 
formed marine archaeology groups whose 
members specialize in such fields as under- 
water photography, drawing, and sur- 
veying. The museums contact the groups 
when they need assistance. Projects are 
usually carried out during the summer holi- 
days and the divers are unpaid, although 
they receive compensation for the use of 
their personal diving equipment as well as 
travel and lodging expenses. 
One important wreck that has been sur- 
veyed and worked on by amateur divers is a 
medieval hulk dating from about AD 1450, 
which has been found in southern Norway. 
Its cargo seems to have consisted of flag-

stones, sarcophagus lids, and round copper 
ingots. Fossils in the limestone flag-stones 
indicate that they came from a quarry out- 
side the town of Tallin in Estonia. The 
wreck was excavated by sports divers under 
the supervision of the Norway Maritime 
.Museum during 1986 and 1987.

Sacred wells 
and Spanish galleons 
Although objects were being recovered 
from the sacred well of Chichén Itz4 as early 
as the end of the 19th century (see page 12), 
it is only relatively recently that systematic 
exploration began of Mexico's important 
underwater heritage of pre-Hispanic votive 
offerings and other objects in inland waters 
and its maritime colonial heritage of Span- 
ish vessels and their cargoes. In 1980 a 
Department of Underwater Archaeology 
was created as part of the National Institute 
of Anthropology and History (INAH), the 
federal institution with responsibility for the

protection, investigation and conservation 
of the country’s archaeological heritage. 
One important project undertaken by the 
Department began when a group of U.S. 
sports divers who were exploring the Cayo 
Nuevo reef in the Bay of Campeche disco- 
vered several iron cannon and an anchor, as 
well as a bronze cannon with 16th-century 
inscriptions and emblems which particularly 
attracted their attention. In 1979 the INAH 
began work on the site with the Institute of 
Nautical Archaeology at Texas A & M Uni- 
versity, and since then other objects have 
been retrieved from this 16th-century ship- 
wreck and the remains of an 18th-century 
wreck have been located. The 16th-century 
bronze cannon is today preserved in a 
museum in the city of Campeche. 
Half Moon Spring in San Luis Potosi 
State, a spring into which offerings were 
thrown in pre-Hispanic times (above all be- 
tween AD 600 and 900) is the site of another 
project sponsored by the Department. Un- 
fortunately, the spring’s popularity with di- 
vers has encouraged looting, and thousands 
of objects have been removed without any 
control or record. 
In 1984 the Department launched a pro- 
ject on “Aids to pre-Hispanic navigation on 
the cast coast of the Yucatdn peninsula”. 
The aim is to locate and analyse offshore 
structures such as lighthouses which might 
have aided navigation in pre-Hispanic 
times. 
Finally, the Department has embarked 
on the preparation of an atlas of all Mexico's 
submerged sites of archaeological interest, 
both inland and at sea.

SRI LANKA 
Coins and cannon 
Owing to its geographical position in the 
Indian Ocean, centrally situated in the sea 
lanes linking the Near East and the East 
Indies, Sri Lanka has been an important 
landfall for seafarers ever since ancient 
times, when it was known as Taprobane to 
the Greeks and Romans, Serendib to the 
sea-farers of old Arabia, and the “land with- 
out sorrow” to the Chinese. The great 
Chinese traveller Cheng Ho made several 
visits to the island in the early years of the 
fifteenth century as part of his explorations 
of the “Western Oceans”. 
There is no doubt that there are wrecks in 
Sri Lankan coastal waters dating from the 
period of European expansion into South 
Asia. An expedition to the Great Basses 
_ reef in the early 1960s, the first real attempt 
at the archaeological exploration of a wreck 
off southern Sri Lanka, produced finds in- 
cluding some 350 pounds of silver coin, a 
bronze cannon and flintlock pistols. Post-   
expedition analysis established that the 
coins came from Surat, the cannon may 
have been British, and the ship may have 
been built in Southeast Asia. More recent- 
ly, important studies have taken place on 
the traditional Madel Paruwa or sewn 
boats, drawing attention to the need for 
research on the ethnographic material relat- 
ing to the Sri Lankan maritime heritage. 
In late 1986 an exploration of two re- 
ported wreck sites was organized as partof a 
feasibility study on the marine archaeolo- 
gical potential of Sri Lanka. The first took 
place in Galle harbour, 115 km south of 
Colombo. Galle, dominated by the massive 
ramparts of the Portuguese and Dutch fort 
in which the city is contained, is bounded on 
the east by Mount Rummaswela, which has 
a perennial fresh water spring. Folklore re- 
lates that this fresh water source was used by 
vessels in Antiquity. A scatter of artefacts 
including local and imported pottery was 
found. The second site, approximately 2 km 
west of Colombo, was identified by local 
divers some years ago, at a depth of 20 
metres, and was assumed to be the location 
of two jettisoned cannon. The 1986 survey 
identified two more cannon and it has been 
suggested that they are probably of a seven-

tury. It comes from a shipwreck off Shinan 
(Republic of Korea) that has been exca- 
vated and studied since 1976 by 
archaeologists from the Cultural Prop- 
erties Preservation Bureau, Seoul. Ex- 
amination of artefacts found on the wreck, 
notably almost 9,000 pieces of celadon 
and around 4,500 porcelain objects, 
should throw light on the history of 
Chinese porcelains and of international 
sea trade in the Middle Ages. Right, 
Chinese coins (Chi-dai T'ung-bao) found 
at the Shinan site. They were minted in the 
early 14th century and were legal tender in 
Japan and other countries in the region, as 
well as in China. The finds confirm that this 
ancient Far Eastern shipwreck is perhaps 
the richest ever found, both in terms of the 
value of the cargo as well as for the in- 
formation it provides on traditional naval 
construction techniques in this region.

### 76562: Apollonia, a model port of Antiquity

Apollonia, 
a model port of Antiquity 
ECENT discoveries made in the 
R submerged ancient harbour of 
Apollonia (see colour page 22) by 
the French Archaeological Mission to the 
Libyan Arab Jamahiriya were featured in 
an exhibition held at Unesco’s Paris head- 
quarters from 3 to 15 June 1987. The exhibi- 
tion, produced by Unesco’s Division of 
Cultural Heritage, also highlighted the re- 
sults of major projects for the study, safe- 
guard and presentation of the Libyan Cultu- 
ral Heritage carried out as a result of co- 
operation between Unesco, the Depart- 
ment of Antiquities of the Libyan Arab 
Jamahiriya, and the Archaeology Depart- 
ment of the University of Manchester 
(UK). 
Located on the northeast Libyan coast, 
Apollonia has been described as “a text- 
book example of an ancient harbour.” It 
was the port, and originally a dependency, 
of the great inland city of Cyrene, which was 
founded around 631 BC. In the first century 
BC, it became a city in its own right. Today 
the ancient harbour installations are sub- 
merged because of subsidence that has 
occurred all along this part of the Libyan 
coastline. 
The harbour was formed of two linked 
sandstone islets joined to the shore by natu- 
ral breakwaters. Today these islets are 300 
metres offshore. An extraordinary range of 
buildings and other structures has been dis- 
covered, including the best preserved set of 
slipways in the Mediterranean, a well-pre- 
served piscina or fish tank, and the remains 
of warehouses including grain-storage silos 
cut into the rock. 
The French Mission, directed by Profes- 
sor André Laronde and working in co-op- 
eration with the Archaeological Service of 
the city of Arles, has carried out a systema- 
tic survey of submerged structures and 
wrecks and other material recently located 
in the eastern dock. The wreck of a mer- 
chant ship, originally about 25 metres long, 
has been discovered. Apart from its 
wooden structure, the wreck has also 
yielded ship’s tackle and the remains of a 
cargo have been found nearby. 
Another wreck contained terra-cotta 
bowls with ornamentation in relief, known 
as “Megarian” ware, which come from the 
coast of Asia Minor, together with Rhodian 
amphoras for transporting wine. The 
stamps on the handles make it possible to 
date this material and consequently the 
whole cargo to about 180 BC. Underwater 
exploration has also produced an abund- 
ance of undecorated ceramic ware, most of 
it locally made, which gives an idea of the 
accessories of everyday living. A bronze 
candelabrum head from the beginning of 
the Roman period bears witness to trade 
with southern Italy in the first century BC, 
while a gold coin (solidus) from Constanti- 
nople shows that trading relations were still 
being maintained at the time the Arabs 
arrived in Libya. [|

Forty years of cultural action 
The Unesco Courier, which was first pro- 
duced in 3 languages, is now published in 34 
languages worldwide, in addition to Braille 
editions in 4 languages. In the early days, its 
circulation was a few thousand; today hun- 
dreds of thousands of copies are printed and 
the magazine is read by over 3 million people 
of all ages and on all continents. In its forty 
years of existence the Unesco Courier has won 
for itself a unique position on the internation- 
al cultural and publishing scene. In the words 
of its Editor-in-Chief, Edouard Glissant, “the 
editions of the Courier produced in 34 lan- 
guages not only represent an outstanding 
publishing achievement, they constitute 
above all an irreplaceable instrument for mu- 
tual enrichment and international under- 
standing, without being either bland or par- 
tisan”. 
To mark these “40 years of cultural action”, 
the Courier’s Paris staff organized an exhibi- 
tion about the magazine which was held at the 
Georges Pompidou Centre, Paris, from 9 
September to 5 October 1987. A series of 
display panels retraced in words and pictures 
the history and achievements of a magazine 
- which, in the words of Unesco’s Constitution, 
has always sought to “construct the defences 
of peace in the minds of men” by developing 
understanding between peoples and cul- 
tures. 
The exhibition, which will later tour France 
* and other European countries, was accompa- 
nied by a series of films about Unesco’s work, 
one of which has as its theme the cover 
designs of the Courier. On 10 September four 
writers associated with Unesco and with the 
magazine took part in a poetry reading at the 
Pompidou Centre: the Arab poet Adonis, 
deputy permanent representative of the Arab 
League to Unesco; the Martinican poet 
Edouard Glissant; the French poet Alain Lé- 
véque, senior editor of the French edition of 
the Courier; and Henri Lopes, Congolese 
novelist and Unesco’s Assistant Director- 
General for Culture and Communication. 
A fortieth anniversary issue of the Unesco 
Courier will be published in 1988.
