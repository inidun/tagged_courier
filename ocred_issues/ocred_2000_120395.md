with Marie-France Delieuvin, programme 
director at the National Centre for Modern 
Dance in Angers, France, and their joint 
endeavour has produced astonishing results. 
In 1997, four years after sowing the 
seeds of the new art form in Bogota and 
Cali, they launched Project El Puente 
(“The Bridge”),which reached Cartagena 
a few months later. The city where Restrepo 
was born 42 years ago is a historic tourist 
centre featured on UNEscO’s World Heri- 
tage List, but it cannot hide a darker side: 
two-thirds of its 700,000 inhabitants live 
below the poverty line. 
Restrepo and Delieuvin’s bridge is two- 
way. It has led a pair of dedicated perfor- 
mers to the outskirts of one of Cartagena’s 
most wretched slums, while also linking the 
project to professionals in Europe and 
Latin America through festivals and 
exchanges. 
In 1997 and 1998, Restrepo began a 
programme of “awareness training” that

PEOPLE AND PLACES 
Cartagena. He eventually ended up with a 
smaller group of 90 young dancers striving 
to hone their skills in a discipline that tou- 
ched the very roots of their cultural and 
personal identity. After a few months, 
through a kind of natural selection that left 
only those determined to take part in a 
creative project, 22 of the children quali- 
fied for membership in the Experimental 
Troupe of the Academy of the Body. They 
were crossing the bridge, travelling from 
one side of the river to the other. 
From outcasts 
to performers 
Driven on by their poverty sticken 
backgrounds, the chosen boys and girls— 
now more mature, with deeper voices and 
changed bodies—are often tempted to 
shirk off school to rehearse their new 
dance projects everyday in the beautiful 
colonial-era cloisters of the 16th-century 
San Francisco convent, leant especially to 
the troupe by a religious foundation. Its 
wide, empty courtyard is flanked by the 
Centennial Park and the city’s modern 
convention centre, while the old neigh- 
bourhood of Getsemanit lies just behind. 
Without the free classes at the Academy, 
these children—most of whom come from 
the city’s Nelson Mandela neighbourhood, 
home to families forcibly displaced by 
Colombia’s civil war—would continue 
living like outcasts, scraping through life. 
But in the three short years the Academy 
has been around,they have become teena- 
gers and grown from average pupils in out- 
lying schools to performers of an art form, 
modern dance, which once seemed remote 
and inaccessible. The children have also 
come to understand that they could lead 
creative lives, ever since Restrepo, with 
unshakeable faith and endurance, arrived 
in their midst and began mounting shows 
with them that have started to attract public 
acclaim. 
Disadvantaged teenagers build their daily routine around the dance school.

PEOPLE AND PLACES 
Besides training its members, the El 
Puente troupe has also attained high 
professional standards, while some for- 
mer members have become dance tea- 
chers in their own right. The natural, 
almost inborn Caribbean sense of rhythm 
has produced dancers imbued with a pos- 
sibly more abstract and certainly more 
symbolic way of expression, yet one which 
ultimately springs from the great tradi- 
tions of modern dance. 
Tours 
and troubles 
With meagres resources and a make- 
shift organization patched up by the 
unflagging enthusiasm of teachers and stu- 
dents alike, the Academy of the Body has 
staged two arts festivals in Cartagena, in 
1998 and 1999, and presented three of its 
own shows. The troupe has also attended 
festivals in Colombia and Europe. 
After their performances abroad, in- 
cluding one that took them to Paris in 
April 2000 and gave them a chance to 
marvel at wealth they could not dream of, 
the children returned to the poverty of 
their tiny homes to grapple once more 
with life in the slums. But this time they 
came back with the confidence of 
having started to do something special in 
their lives. 
It hasn’t all been a bed of roses. Despite 
the support of public bodies and private 
firms, money problems still loom over the 
Academy. But the iron will of Restrepo 
and Delieuvin is rooted in a dream, one 
that often overrides the reality that sha- 
ped it. The dream lives on because tea- 
chers and students in Cartagena seem to 
understand that the rewards of persistence 
are mightier than the pull of despair. HN

### 120397: Venice: duels over troubled waters

OVER TROUBLED WATERS 
How can the ecological balance of Venice be reconciled with the demands of industry? Is the highly 
controversial construction of mobile floodgates the solution? The decision will be made by 2001 
The traveller to Venice should arrive 
at the end of a summer’s afternoon 
to see the sun turn into a huge red 
disk and swell until it casts the lagoon’s 
furthest islands in a fiery glow before sin- 
king into the sea. Then, when the last tou- 
rist has left Saint Mark’s Square, Venice 
once again becomes magical. In streets 
D italian journalist, editor in chief of the magazine 
Airone 
that are empty at last, the inhabitants of 
the world’s most beautiful city open their 
doors, letting the few lingering visitors 
catch a glimpse of a time-worn, history- 
laden monumental staircase, or a hidden, 
tree-shaded garden where Giacomo Casa- 
nova may have awaited one of his mis- 
tresses two and a half centuries ago. It is 
the moment when the souvenir shop signs 
go dark and the Venetians’windows light 
up. 
Each day, they are fewer and older. In 
1951, about 175,000 people lived on one 
of the 118 islands connected by 160 canals 
which form the historic centre of Venice. 
In 1998, a mere 68,000 remained, and 
that figure will likely drop to 40,000 by 
2005. If students are not counted—they 
are lodged by landlords who do not 
declare them to avoid paying taxes— 
residents under the age of 19 make up a 
tiny percentage of the population. The »

The Venetians are leaving, and they 
are taking their institutions with them: 
the Assicurazioni Generali insurance com- 
pany, the daily newspaper II Gazzettino, the 
local Rai station (the State radio and tele- 
vision network) and the banks. Tourists, 
who arrive en masse, fill the void: 10 mil- 
lion debarked in 1994 and 15 million are 
expected in 2005. The city of theatres, 
churches, convents, monasteries, palaces 
and bordellos is turning into a huge eating 
place. From 1976 to 1991, the number of 
pizzerias, restaurants and hotels increased 
by 144 per cent. 
Confronting the sea 
with picks and shovels 
Will Venice grow old and die like its 
inhabitants? That is anybody’s guess: the 
truth is hard to come by in this labyrin- 
thine city. Venice is the city of “perhaps,” 
as unstable as the lagoon’s ecological 
balance. It is impossible to imagine the 
city without its lagoon, an uncertain 
space, neither land nor sea, whose very 
name expresses absence: lacuna is Latin 
for “lack.” This precarious and provi- 
sional place emerged little by little as the 
rivers, torrents and streams that flow 
across the plains on their way to the 
Adriatic deposited millions of cubic 
metres of silt. 
The lagoon is not part of the sea; it is 
separated from the Adriatic by 50 kilo- 
metres of sandbars that end with the 
mouths of the Lido, Malamocco and 
Chioggia ports. Every six hours, the tides 
run through the bars, flowing in as salt 
water and receding as briny water. Like a 
gigantic lung made up of thousands of 
bronchial tubes, the lagoon breathes. It is 
not only formed by islands high enough to 
stand up to the sea’s equinox tides. Barene, 
the sandbars that emerge at low tide, are 
complex ecosystems, home to plants and 
animals which have adapted to this 
environment oscillating between air and 
water. I2lme are the mud-flats visible at low 
tide while ghebi are channels that are 
green with mire and seaweed through 
which the water leaves the lagoon at low 
tide. 
The lagoon was bound to disappear 
until, one day, a group of bold men 
decided to make something solid out of an 
unstable mass. Then, from one generation 
the next, the Venetians battled the ele- 
ments like funambulists walking a tight- 
rope. Prepared with shovels and picks to 
confront the sea’s efforts to upset the

delicate equilibrium, they had only one 
thing in mind: to preserve the existence 
and richness of Venice, the city of stone 
and marble that they built on spongy 
marshland, as if it were on terra firma. 
Venice was a utopia: the world’s most 
fragile city, but powerful enough to rule a 
far-flung empire. 
Those stubborn people started by 
drying out the land, digging canals and 
deviating rivers. For example, as part of a 
huge project begun in 1501 and com- 
pleted two centuries later, they changed

the course of the lagoon’s three main 
waterways: the Sile, the Piere and the 
Brenta. Then, and with increasing 
frequency, they launched major public 
and private building projects to further 
the civil and military development of 
the “most serene republic.” These pro- 
jects enabled merchant vessels and 
warships boasting the biggest drafts of 
their time to enter the harbour or the 
Arsenal. 
“Although with each project the tech- 
nology became more aggressive than the 
simple shovels and picks of the early days, 
these interventions have always given the 
lagoon enough time to develop a new 
balance,” says Stefano Boato, professor of 
city planning at the University of Venice. 
The same was true during the operations 
carried out in the second half of the 19th 
century, when Venice was definitively inte- 
grated into the Kingdom of Italy (1866) 
after changing hands several times bet- 
ween France and Austria. 
It was not until much later, between 
1952 and 1969, that the city was dealt its 
harshest blow. A straight, 15-metre deep 
canal was dug so that oil tankers could 
berth at the industrial port of Marghera. 
At the same time, highly polluting che- 
mical and petrochemical plants were built 
across the lagoon, pumping more and 
more water out of the aquifers and pou- 
ring more and more poison into the water. 
“At that time, the delicate balance that 
had always existed, and that Venetians 
had always managed to maintain over19 
centuries of interacting with nature, was 
broken. The situation is becoming alar- 
ming,” says Boato. 
Aquatic highways for 
tankers and tourists 
The lagoon, a unique ecosystem 
formed of fresh water, brine and salt 
water, is inexorably turning into an arm of 
the sea in its central portion and a swamp 
around the edges. During the time of the 
republic, it was forbidden to dig canals 
more than four metres deep. Today, there 
are veritable aquatic highways over 
20 metres deep. Oil tankers, freighters 
and powerful speedboats that can carry 
hundreds of tourists create waves that 
destroy the sandbars and mud-flats, and 
cancel out the natural movements that 
once slowed down the advancement of 
the tides. 
All these disruptions increase the 
erosion that is ruining the depths of the 
lagoon and eating away at the founda-

tions of buildings. The Venezia Nuova 
Consortium, a group of public and private 
companies which the Italian Public Works 
Ministry and Venice’s Water Department 
have put in charge of carrying out pre- 
servation work in the lagoon, says that 
1.2 million cubic metres of soil are washed 
away each year, while the province of 
Venice puts the figure at four million. 
The mussel fishermen who “work” the 
floor of the lagoon using a fishing method 
that 1s outlawed but tolerated also contri- 
bute to the erosion. 
To make matters worse, fishing zones 
surrounded by dikes limit the tides’ area 
of expansion. Twenty years (1950-1970) 
of pumping subterranean water lowered 
the city’s ground level by 10 centimetres. 
Lastly, the Adriatic is rising, worsening the 
floods to which the city and the surroun- 
ding area fall victim. 
As a result, in 1990 Venice was 23 
centimetres lower than in 1908. Further- 
more, between 1965 and 1995, the Vene- 
tians “forgot” to clean the city’s canals, a 
practice that their ancestors considered 
indispensable for reasons both physical (to 
improve the circulation of tidewater) and 
hygienic (to wash out accumulated waste). 
The neglect has proven costly. On the 
one hand, Venice is beleaguered by over 50 
days a year of acqua alta (“high water”), 
which floods many of the streets and 
squares. On the other, with increasing 
frequency the tides are so low that vessels 
can no longer sail on the canals. 
Hard work for 
meagre results 
On November 4, 1966, a gigantic 
acqua alta entirely submerged Venice and 
the lagoon’s islands for 24 hours, cau- 
sing tremendous damage to the city’s eco- 
nomy and art works, and sending a wave 
of panic around the world. If the water 
had risen a little higher, the world’s most 
beautiful city might have been lost. And 
the flooding could reoccur at any time! 
The shock triggered countless initiatives: 
Italian and international commissions 
were set up, studies conducted, laws 
passed and projects proposed. Major 
international bodies went on the alert, 
UNESCO chief among them. The organi- 
zation moved its office for science and 
technology in Europe to Venice and 
undertook the grandiose “Project Venice,” 
an initiative that has given rise to a pro- 
fusion of studies and meetings to pore 
over all the problems of the city and its 
lagoon: geology and morphology, the 
water’s dynamics, chemical and biolo- 
gical processes, contamination, demo- 
  
graphics, traffic and cleaning up the 
canals. 
No other city in the world has been 
studied in such detail. None has been so 
painstakingly dissected to determine the 
reasons for its rise and fall. And, it must 
be added, never has so much hard work 
produced such meagre results. 
All things considered, and at the risk

of oversimplifying, this complicated busi- 
ness can be summed up in two sentences. 
They are written in bureaucratic jargon in 
law 798, the most important piece of 
legislation concerning Venice passed since 
the 1966 flood. The first sentence says 
that the work to save Venice must “restore

of degradation and eliminate its causes.” 
In other words, everything must be 
done to clean up the canals and to restore 
their depth to acceptable levels (other 
laws specify 12 metres), to re-open the 
fishing lagoons, and to recreate the sand- 
bars and mud-flats. But a harmless-soun- 
ding sentence in the same law specifies 
that all these operations must be carried 
out while “preserving the area’s produc- 
tive and economic interests.” 
  
PLANET 
In other words, the bottoms of the 
canals must be raised but oil tankers must 
not be prevented from travelling through 
them, the size of the lagoon’s harbours 
must be reduced but the current level of 
traffic must be maintained, the tidal swells 
must be contained but vessels must be 
allowed to continue carrying swarms of 
tourists to the islands of Torcello and 
Murano. The law’s authors seem to be 
the direct heirs to the playwright Carlo 
Goldoni and his Harlequin who served 
two masters. 
The system of mobile dikes and flood- 
gates planned as a solution has been a 
bone of contention for nearly 20 years, 
setting off many debates and discussions 
between engineers and politicians. It is 
called MOSE, the Italian name for Moses 
and an acronym that stands for Modulo 
Sperimentale Elettromeccanico, a prototype 
floodgate that was tested in the Treporti 
canal between 1988 and 1992. After years 
of studies and numerous variations,Pro- 
ject Moses was adopted by the Venezia 
Nuova Consortium. The plan is to equip 
the entrances of the Lido, Chioggia and 
Malamocco ports with a system of mobile 
floodgates: chests that are 20 metres wide, 
20 to 30 metres high and four to five 
metres deep. 
In normal conditions and as long as 
the tide’s amplitude does not exceed one 
metre, the water-filled chests will lie on the 
floor of the canal. When the tide is dubbed 
“exceptional” (an average of seven a year 
and 20 in 1996), a hydraulic system will 
fill the chests with air to raise them. Since 
the chests are connected to the canal’s 
floor with stakes driven into the mud, 
The city’s delicate equilibrium was upset by the digging of a canal deep enough to allow oil tankers to berth 
at the industrial port of Marghera.

At exceptionally high tide, a hydraulic system fills

that cut the lagoon off from the sea. 
they work by rising like a gate that closes, 
becoming dikes that cut the lagoon off 
from the sea. Under the plan, 18 flood- 
gates will be set up at the entrance to 
the port of Chioggia, 20 at Malamocco 
and two sets of 20 and 21 separated by 
an intermediate harbour basin at the 
entrance to the Lido. 
Furor over floodgates 
According to estimates, this enormous 
task will require eight years, 6,000 workers 
and 3,700 billion lire (approximately 
$1.8 billion). The city of Venice puts the 
project’s total cost at 5,334 billion lire 
(in 1992 prices), or some $2.6 billion— 
not including maintenance. 
“These mobile dikes must be built,” 
affirms Philippe Bourdeau, a professor 
at Brussels’ Free University and chairman 
of the international committee of experts 
named by the Italian government to eva- 
luate the project. “The mobile flood- 
gates,” he says,“are, along with raising the 
ground level and the other planned mea- 
sures, the best way to save Venice for the 
next 100 years.” 
“These mobile dikes must be abso-

lutely avoided,” replies Stefano Boato, 
along with the Green Party, the Italia 
Nostra environmental group, Green- 
peace, the World Wildlife Fund for 
Nature (WWF) and other environmental 
organizations, which say that the pro- 
ject would have a disastrous effect on 
the fragile ecosystem. But the munici- 
pality of Venice, together with the Envi- 
ronment and Cultural Heritage minis- 
tries, are leading the camp of those 
invoking the precautionary principle. 
They argue that the lagoon’s geomor- 
phological, hydraulic and biological 
balance must be restored—for example, 
by cleaning up the canals, which began 
in 1998 (see box), and raising the ground 
level—before any decisions about the 
mobile dikes are made. 
In addition to this controversy, other 
questions have arisen. For example, the 
city’s autonomy is at stake. The Depart- 
ment of Water, which depends on the 
Public Works Ministry in Rome, and the 
companies that make up the Consortium, 
which include major public and private 
corporations (such as Fiat),have few or no 
ties with Venice, whose population has 
been accustomed to solving its problems 
alone for 2,000 years. 
Fear of 
oil spills 
And then there is the economic aspect: 
$2.6 billion, a sum that rises with each 
passing day, is a tremendous amount of 
money. If all of it is allocated to a single 
project, what will be left for other initia- 
tives and for the small Venetian companies 
that could carry them out? When all is 
said and done, the big corporations in 
Milan, Turin and Rome would reap the 
benefits and Venice would have to settle 
for the crumbs. 
The debate has been raging for a long 
time. In November 1998, the project’s 
environmental impact commission, 
appointed by the Environment Ministry 
and chaired by Maria Rosa Vittadini, an 
architecture professor at the University of 
Venice, issued a negative assessment and 
requested the Consortium to review the 
entire project. One month later, a minis- 
terial commission published a similar 
review, which was annulled in June 2000 
by the regional administrative tribunal of 
the Veneto. The latest news is that,during 
a meeting of experts held in Rome in July 
2000, Prime Minister Giuliano Amato 
said the final decision would lie with his 
office and that it would be made at a 
cabinet meeting by the end of the year. 
But what if Venice’s real problems is 
not the exceptional tide, such as the one 
that struck the city in 1966? And what if 
the next disaster comes not from the 
lagoon but from the sea? Each year, 
25 million tons of freight is shipped on the 
lagoon, half of which is oil and petro- 
leum products. A single oil tanker accident 
would be enough to cause incalculable 
damage to the ecosystem, cover the canals 
with a thick coat of petroleum and leave 
greasy, viscous streaks on the founda- 
tions of palaces and churches forever. On 
November 29, 1995, five tons of light fuel 
spilled into the lagoon, forming a huge 
slick that drifted for four days. Was that a 
warning? 
In the city of masks, the fiery glow of 
the beautiful red sunsets over the city’s 
palaces and churches, which enchant tou- 
rists the year round, may not be solely 
the gift of nature. That extra shade of red 
may well come from air pollution arising 
from Marghera’s petrochemical facilities.

ny city can be compared with a big machine 
that needs to be overhauled and repaired on 
a regular basis. 
This analogy is especially apt for Venice, with 
its fifty-something kilometres of canals that accu- 
mulate nearly half a million cubic metres of waste 
and mud each year, its 454 bridges and its 
100 kilometres of banks lined by the cellars of 
palaces, churches, monasteries and convents, 
pictures of which are reproduced in art books 
around the world. 
Although the city’s regular maintenance 
would seem an obvious necessity, it took years of 
discussions to come about. The result is called 
Insula, a mixed company (52 per cent of the 
shares are owned by the municipality and 
48percent by four private companies) set up in 
July 1997 to manage the urban machine of Venice. 
In slightly less than three years, Insula, basing its 
work on a huge mass of studies conducted by 
Unesco in Venice, has dredged over 22 kilometres 
of canals, extracted 123,000 cubic metres of mud 
and restored 79 bridges. Soon it will start laying 
fibre optic cables, because to survive, Venice 
must also be on the cutting edge of science and

### 120398: China's migrant children fall through the cracks

CHINA'S MIGRANT CHILDREN 
FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS

Despite China's educational achievement, migrant children in the country’s big cities are 
struggling to find a place in school. For many, the unlicensed route is at best, the only option

Every semester, Li Shumei and Yi 
Benyao turn away hundreds of appli- 
cants seeking to study at their school, 
located in a former paint factory in western 
Beijing. It’s not because they’re choosey: 
they know all too well that these children 
may not have another chance of stepping 
into a classroom. But there is simply not 
enough space to satisfy demand. 
This unlicensed school caters to over 
1,300 children from 28 Chinese provinces. 
“Many of the kids have to ride four different 
buses to get here in the mornings, it takes 
them up to two hours,” says Li.“And they 
Db Shanghai-based Canadian journalist 
work hard knowing how difficult it is for 
their parents to afford it.” What makes these 
children different from other city-dwellers 
is simply that they belong to China’s “floa- 
ting population,” a label used to describe 
people who are not permanently registered 
in their current place of residence. Most are 
the children of peasants who have left the 
poverty-stricken countryside in search of 
work in big cities. 
Employed in menial jobs with no secu- 
rity or healthcare, migrants are responsible 
for the lion’s share of the tough physical 
labour that has transformed urban skylines 
in the past decade or so. While the govern- 
ment puts the “floating population” at 
100 million, Western analysts estimate the 
figure closer to 150 million, making the 
phenomenon one of the largest rural-to- 
urban migrations in history. 
This migration began in 1979, when 
the commune system was dismantled. Agri- 
cultural productivity boomed, fewer hands 
were needed to work the land, so families 
headed to cities such as Beijing and Shan- 
ghai. In the mid-1980s, as rural incomes 
steadily fell, the trickle became a flood, 
prompting municipal authorities to tighten 
migration rules. Migrants would now be 
required to get temporary residence permits 
and letters of employment before coming to 
the city. In practice, tens of millions never »

WORLD OF LEARNING 
obtain such permits. As such, they are not 
registered in the place where they are living, 
contrary to permanent migrants whose 
move is officially sanctioned. Their tempo- 
rary status exposes them to widespread dis- 
crimination. When it comes to education, 
their only option, until recently, has been to 
enroll their children in an unlicensed school. 
Li Shumei left Henan Province in 1993 
to work in a clothing market in Beijing. At 
the time, she says, there were no schools for 
migrant children in the capital. Nor were 
they allowed to enroll in city schools. A 
former teacher, she started educating a few 
children in her home before starting up a 
school with her husband. “For our pupils in 
the lower grades, the level of Chinese and 
mathematics is about the same as in regular 
schools,” said Li. Teachers have to make 
do with a lack of books and other materials, 
but Li explains that one of the greatest 
challenges is to help pupils overcome a 
sense of inferiority wrought by their second- 
class status. And because the school is unli- 
censed, they face difficulties re-entering 
the educational mainstream to continue in 
higher grades, though many, once they 
reach the age of 12, return to their home 
provinces to continue their schooling while 
living with relatives. 
Some of school’s teachers are recent 
graduates from the students’ home pro- 
vinces, others are retired instructors from 
Beijing. Their wages are less than half those 
paid in the mainstream, with no benefits. All 
expenses incurred in running the school, 
including salaries, are derived from paltry 
tuition fees—about $100 a year. Li was for- 
tunate enough to receive a generous dona- 
tion from a retired couple in Los Angeles 
who read about the school in an overseas 
Chinese newspaper. The funds were put 
towards relocating the school when police 
ordered its removal from an earlier site. 
According to the Ford Foundation,there 
are between 200 and 300 unlicensed schools

the government leaves us 
alone. When they visit the 
school, they usually either try 
to close us down or fine us for 
various things.” 
operating in the capital which struggle to 
provide schooling for an estimated 
100,000 migrant children, many of whom 
receive no education at all. Dorothy Solinger, 
a political science professor at the University 
of California at Irvine and author of Contes- 
1 4 The Unesco Courier - September 2000 
rng Citizenship in Urban China, estimated 
that only 40 per cent of migrant children 
between five and twelve attended school in 
Beijing, compared with 100 per cent of native 
children. This situation is mirrored in other 
booming cities like Shenzhen and Shanghai. 
Chen Yi Fu, principal of the Hu Wan Ele- 
mentary school in north-eastern Shanghai, 
estimates that “in some migrant communities, 
only 20 to 30 per cent of children go to 
school.” Official statistics differ. According to 
a 1996 study conducted by the Department 
of Basic Education, the average enrollment 
ratio of migrant children stood at 96.2 per 
cent. The study attributed non attendance to 
overcrowding, high fees and an unfavourable 
home environment. 
Media exposure and pressure from 
several delegates from the National People’s 
One of the greatest challenges 
is to help pupils overcome 
a sense of inferiority wrought 
by their second-class status. 
Congress led to a change in the law in May 
1998. The central government decreed that 
unlicensed schools could exist and that it is 
unlawful for large municipalities to deny 
entrance to migrant children between six 
and 14 who had lived for more than six 
months in the area. City governments often 
responded by jacking tuition fees to impos- 
sibly high levels for migrants—up to $440 
annually, when the average yearly income 
of a migrant worker in Beijing is an esti- 
mated $600. And to date, only a handful of 
cities, such as Wuhan and Guiyang, have 
granted legal status to migrant schools 
according to the People’s Economic Journal. 
For Chen Yi Fu,a native of Anhui Pro- 
vince, “the Shanghai government doesn’t 
feel they are responsible for educating our 
children, even though the latter belong to 
families from rural areas who do all the 
hard jobs.” Yi Fu’s school caters to chil- 
dren from 13 provinces, who pay close to 
$100 per year for tuition. “They are the 
lucky ones,” he said, bemoaning the $7,000 
rent he has to pay each year to the army, 
which owns the land. 
Besides the 1998 law however, there 
are signs that the situation is slowly chan- 
ging. Recognizing that China’s economic 
miracle has clearly not benefitted all regions, 
the central government has embarked on a 
massive scheme to invest in the country’s 
hinterland. Moreover, “there are indica- 
tions that in some respects, things are get- 
ting slightly better for rural migrants in big 
cities,” said Solinger. “The municipal 
governments in some cities are now more 
permissive about letting parents set up 
schools of their own. More migrants can 
afford to pay the extra fee required for their 
children to attend city schools, not to men- 
tion that some migrant parents can now 
afford to purchase the card which enables 
their children to attend city schools on city 
terms.” 
Over the years however, people from the 
provinces have become accustomed to fen- 
ding for themselves to provide education. 
“We actually prefer it when the government 
leaves us alone,” says Chen Yi Fu. “When 
they visit the school, they usually either try 
to close us down or fine us for various 
things.” 
But with the likelihood that China will 
soon join the World Trade Organization and 
compete in world agricultural markets, a 
large portion of the country’s 800 million 
farmers might find it even more difficult to 
survive in the countryside. If current trends 
continue, there is little doubt that migrant 
education, and more broadly, migrant rights, 
will become an increasingly pressing issue on 
the government’s books. [| 
 
EDUCATIONAL LEAPS

Wound in 1949, a mere 20 per cent of 
the country’s primary school-age children were 
enrolled in school while 80 per cent of the popu- 
lation was illiterate. Education has been an 
unwavering priority of this country of 1.2 billion 
people. After efforts at universalizing primary 
education, the government passed a law in 1986 
extending compulsory education to nine years. 
The country has recorded some remarkable 
achievements over the past fifty years. In 1998, 
the net enrollment ratio of primary school-age 
children reached 98.9 per cent, while adult illi- 
teracy stands at 16.37 per cent, according to a 
report’ prepared for the World Education Forum 
in Dakar (Senegal, April 2000). The report 
stresses that efforts are now being focused on 
improving access to education in poor regions 
and those with minority populations, facilitating 
fundraising for educational purposes and rai- 
sing the overall quality of teachers. [|

ow that globalization has reached the furthest cor- 
ners of the planet, the world is said to have been 
globalized —either for better, as some argue (pp 
19-20), or for worse according to the critics (pp 20-21). Faced 
with the universal and uniform spread of this revolutionary 
process, these critics have created a kind of international 
opposition movement made up of previously fragmented 
groups, drawn together by the inseparable nature of local 
and global issues. Seattle was their spotlight. 
This dossier offers a guided tour through this constellation 
of movements opposed to the current style of globalization 
and spearheaded by NGOs (pp 24 to 32). Though their back- 
grounds, demands and actions are radically different, these 
U.S. environmental activists, Philippine ethnic minorities, indi- 
genous groups in Ecuador, peasants in Burkina Faso, Indian 
fisherfolk or janitors in Silicon Valley have joined to attack the 
same targets and support the same aspiration: a new notion 
of citizenship that balances the might of business with a 
much stronger political realm. Sharing experience and capi- 
talizing on knowledge have thus become key elements in 
their strategy (p 33). 
But what shape should the future “democratic world 
governance "take? Current plans are still vague (pp 34-35), 
while the legitimacy of these NGOs appears to rest solely 
upon the relevance of the issues they raise and their ability to 
develop ideas that can be turned into action (pp 35-36). W

any view globalization as a technology- 
M driven global order that has led to an inten- 
sification of interconnectedness among 
nations. This, however, is merely one facet of glo- 
balization, and does not presuppose the ideolo- 
gical homogenization or the rapid retrenchment of 
the welfare state that is currently underway. 
The dispute over globalization is not about the 
intensification of global interconnectedness. Rather, 
it is over the vision of the global system that globa- 
lization projects. This vision entails a global economic 
system with identifiable rules of behaviour in trade, 
finance, taxation, investment policy, intellectual 
property rights, and currency convertibility, all of 
which are crafted along neo-liberal principles with 
minimal governmental regulation. As the political 
economist Ellen Wood per-

even the most basic protection from the new phase 
of global capitalism and structural adjustment

Opponents of globalization are addressing 
genuine problems. But it is uncertain whether they 
will succeed in reversing globalization or even in 
mitigating its adverse impacts. To begin with, many 
of them are badly organized. Most of them have also 
rallied around specific issues instead of articulating 
a comprehensive counter vision.At this point, the 
counter vision they project appears to be a global 
system which is not shaped by the narrow interests 
of capital but which accommodates the interests of 
diverse social groups. This

sents a new phase of capi- 
talism which is “more uni- 
versal, more unchallenged, 
more pure and more una- 
dulterated than ever 
before.” 
For many critics, glo- 
balization is essentially an 
anti-democratic process that excludes the interests 
of a wide range of groups. But the process is not 
shaped by market forces alone. It is only made pos- 
sible by the acquiescence if not active support of 
governments, especially those in advanced countries. 
Governments in developing countries, meanw- 
hile,are often said to be unable to stand up to glo- 
balization without incurring severe costs. The 
government of South Africa, for example, could 
be punished by capital flight if it insists on imple- 
menting its agenda of social reform. The masses of 
South Africa,however,are likely to sustain heavier 
costs if the government abandons its reforming 
mandate. Faced with such a dilemma, governments 
have generally selected the side of capital for a 
simple reason: as the economist Paul Krugman has 
noted, the collapse of communism has taken the 
heart out of opposition to capitalism. 
The list of problems caused by globalization is

globalization. Some argue 
for weakening or even abo- 
lishing institutions such as 
the World Bank, the Inter- 
national Monetary Fund, 
and the World Trade Organization, which they view 
as agents of globalization. But to the extent that these 
organizations are effective agents of globalization, 
it is unclear why business interests and govern- 
ments would allow this to happen. The relevance of 
these bodies is only likely to decline if Third World 
countries, especially middle-income ones, begin to 
reduce their dependence on them under pressure 
from their populations. 
Yet the main problem faced by these critics is 
that many of them do not see the relevance of the 
state. A successful struggle for genuine popular 
democracy can liberate the state from the grip of 
corporate and financial interests, turning it into a cri- 
tical agent for the promotion of broad social inter- 
ests. Many NGOs rely instead on civil society, 
though this cannot substitute the state in policy- 
making. The struggle against globalization is essen- 
tially a struggle for democracy:the state cannot be 
bypassed, but must be won. [|

ments to do so as well. The recent surge of 
activism testifies not to a change in purpose, but a 
growing realization that certain shared problems are 
partly caused by the common root of globalization. Tar- 
gets like the agencies of international trade and finance 
are hardly new, though their current prominence 
reflects an era of much greater NGO co-ordination in 
the face of rapid economic change and unresponsive 
national governments. 
The real question, however, is whether a growing 
global civil society, even in concert with willing govern- 
ments, could begin to match the magnitude of the 
global challenge. No one alive today can answer this 
question, but an overview of what is happening may 
provide some clues.

20,000 INGOs with branches in at least three countries, 
plus 5,000 or more northern NGOs working interna- 
tionally that are based in only one developed country. 
Although INGOs have quadrupled in number 
since 1970, their contribution to relief and development 
pales beside the demands posed by increasing numbers 
of complex human emergencies. In 1995 only about 
$10 billion of $60 billion in overseas development 
assistance flowed through NGOs. 
Yet these organizations have become prominent 
global players. They lobby official international orga- 
nizations with increasing frequency and success, and 
have become important actors in agenda-setting mee- 
tings. From the Montreal Protocol regulating ozone 
emissions in 1987 to the 1994 Cairo Population Confe- 
rence and the 1995 BeijingWomen’s Conference, they 
have accompanied their partner organizations in kee- 
ping such issues as human rights, women and envi- 
ronmental deterioration on the front burner. 
The most dramatic chapter in the NGO story has 
been their proliferation in the global “South.” Beginning 
about thirty years ago, increasing numbers of well-edu- 
cated young people took advantage of foreign financial 
assistance to create NGOs. Although a few organizers 
created local “counterparts” to INGOs, most others used 
funds from several donors to 
define their own programmes. The non-governmental 
on broader democratic processes such as public deli- 
beration, voter registration and election monitoring, and 
even to the election of some grassroots leaders to local 
office. Many NGOs also advocate major political 
changes, though protests are not always at the street- 
level. A Brazilian NGO, for instance, provides citizens 
with a toll-free “green phone” to report environmental 
crises. Nor is there a clear distinction between advocacy 
and collaboration. One network in India, the Inte- 
grated Child Development Service, campaigns for 
political change through both NGOs and “chapters” 
in federal and state governments. 
Stronger civil societies are also emerging in Cen- 
tral and Eastern Europe, and the former Soviet Union. 
Only a minority of the estimated 75,000 “Eastern” 
NGOs were previously tied to Communist regimes, 
with the rest created or resurrected by an inflow of 
foreign assistance after 1989. Because these NGOs 
emerged with the collapse of governmental social ser- 
vices, they are more likely to be service providers than 
tied to members at the local level. Indeed, some forms 
of local organization such as co-operatives acquired a 
bad name under Communism. 
Among the more innovative NGOs in this region 
are those organized in response to the emerging envi- 
ronmental crises of the 1980s. Originating as quasi- 
opposition movements,they 
have continued to challenge 
Several of these organizations challenge to mindless globalization governments. Microcredit, 
provided protection from poli 
tical repression. 
Almost everywhere, this 
process depended on part- 
nerships between two types of NGOs: grassroots orga- 
nizations (GROs) and grassroots support organizations 
(GRSOs). Grassroots organizations have local mem- 
bers and help develop their own communities. Although 
some, such as women’s groups, are new, others evolved 
from traditional community organizations such as 
rotating credit societies that have existed for thou- 
sands of years. There are now probably several hundred 
thousand GROs in Asia,Africa and Latin America. 
Faced with the deterioration of their environment 
and the increasing impoverishment of the 1980s, GROs 
and local individuals began organizing networks and 
movements among themselves. A network of lane com- 
mittees in Oranji, Pakistan, for example, has provided 
clean water and sewage for 100,000 people. An esti- 
mated 50,000 largely professional GRSOs, meanw- 
hile, help channel international support to these lower 
levels. In Bolivia, for example, a set of GRSOs focuses 
on propagating solar greenhouse technologies. 
Other organizations work on corruption or human 
rights. An anti-corruption centre in Maharashtra, sup- 
ported by a GRO network, succeeded in getting forty 
local revenue officers dismissed and has received 
requests for help from other localities intent on pursuing 
complaints through the courts. This type of political 
activism sometimes reaches the global level, as the 
Philippine indigenous leader Victoria Tauli-Corpuz 
explains (p. 24-25). 
The retreat of authoritarian rule, meanwhile, has 
led to the creation of new types of NGOs concentrating

world, has also gained at least 
a toehold in the transitional 
countries. 
The non-profit sector has also grown in the deve- 
loped countries. In the United States, for example, 70 
per cent of non-profit organizations are less than thirty 
years old. Even more recent are the protest and other 
social change movements fuelled by the growth of the 
Internet, such as those described by student activist 
Andrea del Moral (p. 22-23). 
If nothing else, this overview highlights the diffi- 
culties in mapping a complex, vast and dynamic global 
civil society still in its infancy. On a global level,some 
business networks focus on sustainable development, 
and national NGOs as diverse as the Grameen Bank 
in Bangladesh and Working Capital in New Hampshire 
(U.S.) promote businesses. Thus, the non-govern- 
mental challenge to mindless globalization is not oppo- 
sition to profits, but rather support for broader owner- 
ship and competition. Most importantly, true civil 
society is more than a collection of NGOs, but rather 
a measure of how citizens associate, talk and act toge- 
ther in public life. 
Much has been made of the Internet and how it 
may contribute to a stronger civil society. Yet though the 
Internet has helped create global coalitions on hundreds 
of issues, billions of people still have no access to a tele- 
phone, much less to a computer. Even if people gain 
access, they may be more likely to see an advert for a 
soft drink than learn how to purify water. Ultimately, 
the contribution of the Internet to the governance of 
globalization will depend on the human ties that are 
established off-line. [|

for two radically opposed groups. There 
are the “anti-globalists” who fear globalization and 
stress only its downside, seeking therefore powerful

to which I belong) who celebrate globalization ins- 
tead, emphasize its upside, while seeking only to 
ensure that its few rough edges be handled through 
appropriate policies that serve to make globalization 
yet more attractive. 
Many anti-globalists consider the central pro- 
blem of globalization to be its amorality, or even its 
immorality. But these critics have too blanket an 
approach to globalization. The word covers a variety 
of phenomena that characterize an integrating world 
economy: trade, short-term capital flows, direct 
foreign investment, immigration, cultural conver- 
gence et al. The sins of one of the above cannot be 
visited upon the virtues of another. Some are benign

even when largely unregulated whereas others can 
be fatal if left wholly to the marketplace. 
In particular, the freeing of trade is largely 
benign: if I exchange some of my toothpaste for 
some of your toothbrushes, we will both be better 
off than if we did not trade at all.It would require 
a wild imagination,and a deranged mind,to think 
that such freeing of trade leads to debilitating eco- 
nomic crises. But only ideologues would deny that 
the hasty freeing of short-term capital flows,under 
pressure from what I have called in Foreign Affairs 
(May 1998) the US-Treasury Complex, was what 
helped to precipitate the huge Asian financial crisis. 
Equally, it is illogical to believe, as non-economists 
who fear globalization do, that freeing of trade is bad 
because the freeing of short-term capital flows led 
to a debilitating financial and economic crisis and 
could do so again. In fact, while there are some 
obvious similarities between free trade and free 
capital flows—e.g. that segmentation of markets 
creates efficiency losses—the economic and political 
dissimilarities are even more compelling and 
policymakers cannot ignore them. 
Anti-globalist critics are in fact often reacting 
viscerally to a much larger issue: the victory of capi- 
talism over its arch rival,communism. For campus 
idealists who have always looked for alternatives to 
what they conventionally consider to be the greed and 
lack of social conscience that characterize capita- 
lism, the situation is psychologically intolerable. 
Some have turned to street theatre, nihilism and the 
anti-intellectualism that has been manifest in the 
last few years. The more sophisticated have suc- 
cumbed to a stereotypical representation of corpo- 
rations as the “evil” forces of capitalism that have cap- 
tured the state, democratic institutions, and even 
international bodies such as the World Trade Orga- 
nization. 
What these critics often forget is that certain eco- 
nomic freedoms are basic to prosperity and social 
well-being under any conditions, and are thus of the 
highest moral value.Property rights and markets, for 
instance,provide incentives to produce and allocate 
resources efficiently, and can in turn strengthen 
democracy by allowing a means of sustenance out- 
side pervasive government structures. The quality 
and breadth of democracy can then be enlarged as 
excluded groups, such as women and the poor, are

Critics nevertheless go on to maintain that the 
global spread of free markets and free trade is res- 
ponsible for continuing poverty in poor countries, 
and for alleged growth in inequality between and 
within countries. Labour unions in the rich countries 
also fear that their workers are being hurt by trade 
in cheap labour-using goods from poor countries. 
But I do not think these concerns are well- 
founded. In India which has almost a quarter of the 
world’s poor, there is good evidence that autarchic 
and anti-market policies produced abysmally low 
growth rates at 3.5 per cent annually over a quarter 
of a century, with a correspondingly negligible impact 
on poverty. Since growth rates picked up since the 
1980s,poverty has declined. Higher growth rates in 
turn depend on several factors; but openness to 
trade and direct investment and a skilful use of mar- 
kets are definitely an important contributory factor. 
As for inequality among nations, it is precisely 
those countries that embraced integration into the 
world economy, i.e. the Far Eastern Four and then the 
ASEAN countries, which raced ahead with dramatic 
growth rates whereas several countries of Africa, 
Latin America and Asia that looked inwards failed to

deliver growth and also made little dent on poverty. 
The evidence on trade and investment impove- 
rishing our workers is also flawed. My own research 
suggests that the downward pressure on workers’ 
wages due to technical change has been dampened, 
not magnified, by trade with the poor countries. 
Research also shows that big corporations use abroad 
technologies similar to those at home, instead of 
exploiting lower standards or forcing them yet lower 
through their financial clout. 
One result of these mistaken arguments against 
globalization has been an insistent clamour for certain 
environmental and labour standards to be linked to 
rules on international trade. But by seeking to create 
new “obstacles” to free trade, you undermine the 
freeing of trade, while mixing up trade with a moral 
agenda undermines that very moral agenda. It gives 
other countries the definite impression that you 
are using ethical rhetoric to mask protectionist 
self-interest. 
The notion that global free trade and invest- 
ment are responsible for poverty, inequality, lowering 
of standards and harming social progress is little short 
of astonishing. Yet it is given currency by national 
politicians and international bureaucrats who think 
that going along is a way of getting along. In denying 
the virtues of globalization, they actually harm the 
very causes they profess to embrace. [|

Reaganite revolutions were in full swing, the doc- 
trine of neo-liberalism appears to have staked 
itself out across the countries of the world without 
meeting much serious opposition. But negative reactions 
to the spread of free market philosophy have ensued as 
the damage it has caused — in terms of inequalities, 
impoverishment, social exclusion and environmental 
destruction—come to light. 
Supporters of the free market advocate deregulation 
to the extent that all human activity would be run by the 
private sector, while public authorities would be left to 
manage the tools of coercion and law within a given ter- 
ritory:namely, the army, the judicial system, and (if only 
in part) the police and prisons. On the other side, sup- 
porters of a more humane economy, who have grown 
hugely in number over recent years, back a rather dif- 
ferent formula for the good society: “yes to the market 
Gr the early 1980s, when the Thatcherite and economy, not to the market society.” In other words, they 
insist on the need to resurrect and re-establish regula- 
tion in new and varied forms so that it can cover today’s 
global dimensions of economic activity. 
The differences between these two broad schools of 
thought is at least three centuries old, beginning when 
the old divine order— in which political authority was 
enmeshed —collapsed. At the start of the 17th century, 
Galileo confounded the Scriptures by proving that the 
Earth rotated around the Sun. Shortly after, philoso- 
phers such as Thomas Hobbes and John Locke argued 
that the social order was not grounded in Providence, 
but in the decisions of individuals. The medieval dogma 
holding that all power came from God, who assigned 
each person his or her “natural” place in society, was 
shattered. From then on, societies faced a new challenge: 
defining the “social contract” that linked people with 
each other and with the state.

Two radically opposed forms of contract were put 
forward. The first “political” form placed its trust in the 
good will of individuals, who could freely decide the 
shape of the new social order. The second “economic” 
option suspected that this trust in fallible, fickle human 
nature was open to abuse. A new social order, these latter 
theorists maintained, needed rock-solid foundations— 
namely economic “laws,” which are “natural” and thus 
unchanging. 
The first such law is that everyone acts primarily out 
of his or her own personal interest, the main thrust of 
which is a desire for riches. This impulse is shared 
universally in all societies, the theory goes, and will even- 
tually be the best method for organizing all of them. As 
a result, the market theory took its first step towards a 
utopian vision in which everything is subjected to its 
rules. 
It is false to claim, as many neo-liberals do, that 
today’s enhanced market ideology is essentially modern, 
and that the revival of tougher “political” regulatory 
mechanisms to check the supremacy of private interests 
over the public good would be a step backwards. 
The other face of globalization 
Scottish economist Adam Smith outlined the funda- 
mentals of the free market two centuries ago; regulation 
came much later. 
In the 19th century, a number of very tightly 
controlled national and international markets gave 
way to a much more open market. The pendulum 
swung again, however, and as a result of the market’s 
failure to deliver a workable, peaceful society, markets 
were refined so that they today include “rules, institu- 
tions and networks that control and monitor the crea- 
tion of supply and demand and the relationship bet- 
ween them,” according to French economist Jean 
Gadrey. But these interventions are now being chal- 
lenged by a new wave of deregulation. Defining a 
market economy, says Gadrey, has hence become an 
“extremely contentious and political” issue—as well as 
a very urgent one. 
A second flawed argument used by neo-liberals is 
that the market economy is the only source of wealth, 
and in particular, wealth for all (the notorious “trickle- 
down”theory). The past 20 years,however,have testi- 
fied to widening inequality, with the three richest people 
now wielding a fortune greater than the combined 
GDP of the world’s 48 poorest nations. 
The third error committed by today’s free-marke- 
teers is their denial of the fact that the real economy in 
fact rests on three foundations, as the Hungarian 
émigré political scientist Karl Polanyi argued. In a 
market economy, the terms of trade are fixed by prices 
that various participants in the markets decide upon on 
the basis of their interests. But hidden in these calcu- 
lations are all sorts of non-market variables and contri- 
butions,starting with government aid and subsidies to 
firms. 
In the non-market economy, the distribution of 
goods and services is largely handled by the public 
sector, which operates according to the rules set down 
by democratically elected authorities. This is the “wel- 
fare state.” But beyond this, in the third, non-monetary 
economy, the priority rests on reciprocity, with ser- 
vices distributed by groups or people according to the 
social links that bind them together, whether in fami- 
lies,associations or mutual support groups. 
Firms benefit from training and teaching conducted 
in the home, and thus draw on a fund of “social capital.” 
Likewise, in the expanding service sector, businesses take 
advantage of intangible investments like education, 
which depends largely on the public sector, as well as 
on orders and investments from public authorities. 
They also depend heavily on the political decisions 
made by governments. 
These examples go to prove that neither the oft- 
mentioned distinction between a market and non- 
market economy nor the claim that the former is the 
only source of wealth survive critical examination.Ins- 
tead, we should adopt a more realistic and less ideolo- 
gically driven model: that of a plural economy. By put- 
ting these various beliefs up for discussion, we can 
escape the tyranny of a market conceived as an abstract 
and impersonal norm imposed on everyone. Tomor- 
row’s humane economy can only be built through the 
interaction of regulated markets, states and democratic 
civil societies. |

After dodging police in the streets, a young activist in the U.S. takes the battle 
against corporate forces onto firmer ground

ving.” It is a familiar refrain at the American 
dinner table to which scores of children have 
replied: “Send them my broccoli!” But to Andrea del 
Moral,now 22, the question sparked confusion. Why 
were children starving? “I still don’t understand it,” she 
admits, “it’s not about not enough food in the world.” 
That she continues to pursue the question sets her 
apart from her peers. A native of wealthy Seattle, 
Washington, she has turned her back on lucrative job 
opportunities to consider the co-existence of prosperity 
and starvation. 
But the solution remains elusive. Looking back on 
ayear of hard-core activism that has included the World 
Trade Organization (WTO) protests in Seattle and 
Washington, D.C., teach-ins and cross-country road- 
trips, del Moral says frustration and hard lessons from 
the world of global politics have forced her to re-evaluate 
how she can help bring down the corporate forces that 
she believes are undermining food security.

With close-cropped curls and baggy carpenter’s 
pants, she describes her look as “a little bit punk,” but 
she is no arrogant rebel. Del Moral is thoughtful, arti- 
culate, with an easy, sometimes self-deprecating laugh. 
That a young woman who has never known hunger 
should make it her vocation comes as a surprise even to 
her own parents. But del Moral credits them for plan- 
ting the seeds. Her father is a botany professor and her 
mother works for the U.S.government’s Environmental 
Protection Agency. “I grew up with that ethic [of envi- 
ronmentalists],” she says, adding that “my family always 
encouraged me to make my own decisions.” 
But to the dismay of her parents, del Moral aban- 
doned her studies at a Montreal university to pursue 
activism full-time. Surviving on money earned tutoring 
and taking on odd acting roles, she began her subver- 
sive education with a band of like-minded twenty- 
somethings in Montreal. While mounting street plays 
illustrating the nightmarish creations of genetic engi- 
neering gone wrong, the troupe began plastering mock- 
labels on genetically modified foods and holding 
demonstrations outside the city’s supermarkets. 
Like thousands of other activists around the world, 
it was on the World Wide Web that del Moral first heard 
the buzz about the WT0’s November 1999 meeting in 
Seattle. “At first I didn’t know what the WTO was,” she 
admits. By tapping into dozens of “list-serves” and 
email discussion groups, del Moral soon began fluently 
using terms like “corporate seed supply” and “biopiracy.” 
Practice before preaching 
She also deepened her knowledge of the Bretton- 
Woods institutions and their sister, the WT0. She now 
realizes that “these institutions were not formed by 
people saying ‘let’s control the world’. They were created 
with good intentions that went wrong.” For del Moral, 
“The big organizations are power structures that are in 
complete contradiction with direct democracy, which has 
the most potential for freedom.” While she understands 
the need for international bodies to regulate and har- 
monize the laws of different countries, del Moral fears 
that these organizations are more concerned with pro- 
fits than with people, and advocates dismantling them. 
In the months prior to the Seattle protest, del Moral 
travelled across the country, attending demonstrations, 
workshops on civil disobedience and classes in Social Eco-

logy, the philosophy of living by nature’s example in 
which organic farming is central. She soon discovered her 
knack for addressing crowds. But after speaking to more 
and more people, she began to realize the limitations of 
her theories. She recalls meeting with a farmer in western 
Canada, who agreed that big corporations like Nabisco 
were manipulating the price of his harvest for their pro- 
fits, but didn’t see how organic farming would solve his 
financial problems. “For him it was about profits not pro- 
duction. We thought about how we could help, but we are 
just city kids,” says del Moral, “I have no place telling these 
kinds of people I have the solutions.” 
Disappointed by that encounter, del Moral decided 
to learn to practice what she was preaching in the 
context of the global economy. She figured the best place 
to get the big picture was in Seattle. 
Del Moral arrived in her hometown on the eve of 
Thanksgiving—ironically the American harvest holiday 
associated with over-eating. No one anticipated the 
extent of the violence that erupted in Seattle from 
November 30 to December 3. Television images beamed 
around the world showed a devastated city in a state of 
emergency; riot police in bulletproof armour beating 
back protestors,armed National Guardsmen roaming 
the streets and graffiti-ed storefronts. 
As WTO delegates arrived,security was bolstered. 
Stepping into the streets she had roamed as a child, del 
Moral felt the ground shift. Her first encounter with riot 
police in a parking garage marked a moment of 
truth: she and her friends, armed only with big 
ideas, were about to engage in a battle with far 
more powerful forces. “At that moment” says del 
Moral, “I realized a sort of war was being waged upon 
us and this (the police) was its visible manifestation... 
I wish I could carry that realization around with me 
every day.” 
While she steered clear of the front lines to avoid 
arrest, sleepless nights and days spent dodging the 
police left her battle-weary. Once again, del Moral 
wondered if she was making the best use of her energy. 
“We will never take down industrial agriculture,” she 
recalls asking herself, “so why are we doing this?” 
Committed to change but still searching for her 
place in the anti-globalization movement, del Moral 
has retreated from the front lines, devoting herself to 
organic farming. On a six-acre farm in the quiet hills of 
Vermont, she earns $50 a week tilling the land, and expe- 
rimenting with seed saving and ancient farming tech- 
niques which she believes still hold the key to solving 
world hunger. [|

D Victoria Tauli-Corpuz

Chico River Dam project. Now, their survival is increasingly linked to changing the rules of 
international trade, as a leading advocate explains

We raised the social and political awareness of our 
people, and mobilized them against the dictator- 
ship of Ferdinand Marcos. We understood that we 
were oppressed and discriminated against as indi- 
genous people, and that therefore we should struggle 
for self-determination and regional autonomy. In 
the 1980s, the government was finally forced to 
cancel the Chico River Dam Project because of our 
sustained opposition. This project would have dis- 
placed around 300,000 Igorots. 
At the time we could already see the value of 
international networking to gather support for our 
struggles against military rule in many of our com- 
munities. We discovered the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights, and used it to strengthen our cause. 
Indigenous peoples also became active in lob- 
bying the United Nations to address human rights

linguistic tribes—the Ibaloy, Kankana-ey, Ifugao, Kalinga, 
Apayao/Isneg and the Bontoc—living in the rugged 
Cordillera region in the northern Philippines. All six tribes 
share common traits, including religious beliefs based on 
nature. The total population of Igorots in the region stands 
at 1.2 million according to the 1995 census.

» violations of indigenous peoples. Since the crea- 
tion in 1982 of a UN Working Group on Indigenous 
Populations, indigenous peoples have regularly taken 
part in drafting minimum standards for the protec- 
tion of their rights. I am, however, a strong believer 
in the primacy of local and national struggles over 
international action. Without strong resistance on 
the ground, international campaigns will fail. The 
fall of the Marcos dictatorship came about 
primarily because of the protests of the poor majo- 
rity, which had built up for more than 20 years 
within the country. Only once the regime became 
widely unpopular did the elite Filipinos and the 
  
international community start to withdraw some 
support from it. 
But I have also seen how decisions or agree- 
ments reached by international institutions like the 
World Bank and the International Monetary Fund 
(IMF) can erode gains achieved locally. From the 
late 1970s to the 1980s, I helped to set up commu- 
nity-based health programmes, only to see the struc- 
tural adjustment policies and programmes of the 
World Bank and IMF lead to budget cuts in health, 
while liberalization of our investment and trade laws 
set back much of our progress. 
The struggle for ancestral land rights, for ins- 
tance, was undermined by the Mining Act of 1995, 
which allows foreign mining corporations to have 
100 per cent foreign equity and a 75-year lease on a 
maximum of 81,000 hectares of mineral lands. The 
Indigenous Peoples’ Rights Act (IPRA), a new law 
passed in 1998, rectified some of the damage but falls 
short of what we want. The mining corporations 
have nevertheless filed a suit in the Supreme Court 
questioning its constitutionality. 
We were told that to develop, we have to shift 
from producing for our domestic use to producing 
for the world market. But those who shifted to cash 
crop production are now going bankrupt because of 
the dumping of highly-subsidized, imported agri- 
cultural products from foreign countries. Cheap 
ready-to-fry sliced potatoes,corn, oranges and pears, 
frozen-dressed chicken and other foods are being 
dumped in the country, destroying the livelihoods of 
tens of thousands of farmers. The commitments of 
the Philippine government, particularly relating to 
agriculture as part of the Uruguay Round of the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, has allowed 
this to happen. 
This situation is not unique to the Philippines. 
Our Quechua sisters from Peru share a similar story. 
Their potatoes are now left to rot in the fields because 
they cannot compete with cheap, dumped processed 
potato slices from North America.Imported maize or 
corn has also destroyed the traditional corn produc- 
tion of indigenous peoples in Mexico. Food insecu- 
rity and the loss of livelihoods are worsening each day. 
Of course, we argue that our governments should 
be blamed because they signed these agreements,and 
also because they push an unsustainable economic 
model that is debt-driven, export-oriented and 
import-dependent. 
In our own voice 
But we are not blind to the powers of the World 
Trade Organization, the IMF and World Bank, and 
bodies like the Organization for Economic Coope- 
ration and Development (OECD) or the Group of 
Eight. Those economies that do not fall in line 
become pariahs. The globalization of the production 
and consumption systems of the few elite countries, 
corporations and individuals is a threat to the conti- 
nued existence of diverse and sustainable indige- 
nous livelihoods. 
This is the main reason why Tebtebba was set up 
in 1996. After doing work on the local and national 
levels, I felt that there was a gap. Global decisions 
directly impact on our daily lives and can erode 
gains achieved through years of hard work. Yet we 
have no chance to influence these decisions. Our 
absence in the global arena allows others to speak for 
us, and in many instances we are misrepresented. 
Tebtebba is a Kankana-ey-Igorot term for discourse 
and I thought this was an appropriate name for an 
Indigenous Peoples’International Centre for Policy 
Research and Education. 
Indigenous peoples are pushing hard for the UN 
to adopt the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples, and are campaigning to slow down or halt 
unfettered globalization. Tebtebba took the lead in 
researching and writing on globalization and indi- 
genous peoples. In Seattle, we adopted the “Seattle 
Declaration of Indigenous Peoples.” Among other 
things, this called for the removal from the Wo of 
the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property 
Rights—a legal device allowing corporations to 
appropriate our diverse biological and genetic 
resources, along with our traditional knowledge, 
and to patent life itself. 
We still have a long way to go. We need all kinds 
of partnerships, even with governments, to bring 
about a world which allows us to exist as distinct 
peoples and where social, economic and environ- 
mental justice reigns. [|

Ecuador: beyond 
the dollar coup 
D Marcos Almeida 
Globalization is fine, say Ecuador's indigenous leaders, as long as it allows us to preserve our 
traditional culture and begin talks with the North on a level playing field 
and thinkers in Ecuador’s indigenous people’s 
movement.Invariably dressed in the distinctively 
dark poncho and sombrero from his village of Sara- 
guro, in the country’s western highlands, he manages 
the Internet edition of a newsletter published by the 
Institute for the Knowledge of Indigenous Culture. 
Macas heads this Quito-based body, having served 
stints as president of the Confederation of Ecuador’s 
Indigenous Nationalities (CONAIE) and as a national 
deputy for the Pachakutik movement. 
The CoONAIE and its political wing Pachakutik, 
which today has six deputies in the 123-seat unicameral 
Ecuadorian parliament, was one of the main groups 
involved in a popular uprising in January 2000 that 
shocked the world by seizing control of the government 
and parliament in Quito. Allied with a group of young 
military officers rebelling against corruption, the indi- 
genous groups forced the then President Jamil Mahuad 
to resign and flee the country, though the insurgents 
failed to secure one of their main objectives:stopping 
a bid to dollarize the economy, which wiped out the 
national currency, the sucre, with the stroke of a pen. 
ON uis Macas is one of the most prominent leaders 
  
Niches of local power 
For Luis Macas, a restored sense of identity is not 
only important for indigenous people, who make up a 
third of the country’s 12 million people, but for Ecua- 
dorian society as a whole. Once indigenous people 
complete their period of “self-definition” through 
struggles for land and preservation of their ancestral cul- 
ture, Macas argues, “ethnic differences can be super- 
seded” and political plans drafted for the whole society. 
Macas places great hope in the niches of local 
power won by Ecuador’s indigenous movement in 
May 2000, when they romped to victory in 27 town 
halls and five provincial districts out of 22—a totally 
unparalleled event in recent Latin American history. 
According to Macas, success at the ballot box needs 
to be converted into better training for local indigenous 
leaders and greater democratic participation by com- 
munities: “there are two bases, the technical and the poli- 
tical, and we have to strengthen both,” he declares.

cama.Mayor of the Guamote district in the province of 
Chimborazo, which houses over 133 indigenous com- 
munities,Curicama combines a long career as leader of 
his people’s campaigns with an extraordinary manage- 
rial dynamism. “You’ll never find me inside my office,” 
he explains, “I’m always on the road.” Re-elected twice 
since 1992, this Quechua from the country’s central 
highlands who started work as a builder at the age of 17, 
has revolutionized his district, promoting public parti- 
cipation in local assemblies, and combining the minga— 
the Quechua people’s traditional community work—with 
assistance from leading foreign organizations. The results 
are there for all to see: roads, 
drinking water, irrigation 
channels, reforestation and 
replenishment of the local fish 
stock in places where previous 
governments sowed only poverty and patronage. A few 
months ago he created the Indigenous Chamber of 
Commerce, which local people hope will advertise and 
sell their products within the country and abroad. 
Mariano Curicama, who has travelled to 14 countries, 
is not afraid of globalization: “If we don’t jump on this 
car, we'll be left by the side of the road,” he declares. 
Miguel Lluco, a former national deputy and 
national co-ordinator of the Pachakutik movement,is 
also convinced that his people’s horizons will have to 
widen: “Ecuador can’t be an exception in this process 
of globalization,” he says. The bloodless uprising in 
January, he acknowledges, was “the inevitable reflec-

usséini Ouédraogo, forty-something, looks like 
a lumberjack. He has the moral strength of one, 
too. Ouédraogo coordinates the programmes of 
the National Federation of Farmers’ Organizations 
(FENOP), a group that was set up in 1996 and boasts 
197 unions, 500 grassroots associations and some 
400,000 members in every corner of Burkina Faso. 
Ouédraogo, an agronomist who descends from Prin- 
cess Yennenga—the ancestor of the Mossé, Burkina 
Faso’s main ethnic group—is fighting for the farmers in 
his country, where nearly 80 per cent of the population 
lives off the land. Almost non-existent farm mechaniza- 
tion,illiteracy and low yields mean they are barely able 
to eke out an existence. And yet, the country owes them 
everything. Cotton, Burkina Faso’s primary source of 
foreign currency, accounted for two-thirds of export 
earnings in 1998, or over 1.2 billion French francs

rency exchanges, and which threatens to disrupt the 
development of our own political agenda. 
“That’s why it’s so vital to build up links with people 
who are campaigning and proposing alternatives across 
the world. If we had stayed put in Ecuador with the 
local land conflicts of the 1960s, when every village 
fought with its own landlord as if it were engaged in a pri- 
vate battle, we would never have made all this progress 
in indigenous people’s organization. People in the First 
World can provide us with a lot, while we can promote 
our values and community vision.” 
Until the age of 13, when on one moonlit night he 
left the rustic house where he lived with his illiterate 
peasant family and headed to 
the sugar cane plantations 
on the coast, Miguel Lluco 
knew nothing outside his 
small corner of the Andes. 
On the basis of his experience as a labourer, shoeshine 
boy, ice-cream salesman, carpenter, union leader, 
politician, deputy, and indefatigable defender of the 
“Integral human being,” as he likes to put it, Lluco 
weighs up the risks and opportunities of a globalized 
world: “I see it in the same way as the course of my life, 
from my village of Sacaguan, to discovering the neigh- 
bouring town of Guamote and its school, then on to 
the situation of Ecuador and Latin America as a 
whole, until I started to wonder “What do they think 
in the First World?, ‘How do we build a form of com- 
munication and perhaps co-operation?’” 
The future of the first Latin American country to 
abandon its own currency hinges on the answers that 
Ecuador and the North give to these questions. H 
($171.4 million). Breeding accounted for 15 per cent of 
exports ($38.5 million) the same year. 
“For us, farmers are full-fledged citizens,” says Oué- 
draogo. “They are entitled to respect. We are working to 
improve their status and to defend their interests. We're 
always there wherever and whenever one of our mem- 
bers needs us.” The FENOP fought its first battle against 
an “internal enemy.” In 1997, the organization clashed 
with the Textile Fibre Company (SOFITEX), which rules 
the cotton industry and has a monopoly on input and 
sales. Cotton was in crisis. A black veil covered the 
“white gold.” Cotton fields were overrun by caterpillars, 
and the pesticides supplied by a SOFITEX subsidiary 
were ineffective. Some farmers left the country, others 
committed suicide. Growers who went into debt up to 
their necks at the start of each agricultural season felt as 
if they had a knife to their throats.

### 120407: Banana blues

A 
f Viens. 
The country’s “white gold” has plunged many farmers into debt. 
Appealing to popular opinion, Ouédraogo and his 
organization asked a private newspaper, Le Pays, to see 
for itself. SOFITEX counter-attacked by staging a pro- 
paganda tour of a cotton-growing region for other news- 
papers. That is when the FENOP received unexpected 
support from L'Indépendant, directed by the famous 
investigative journalist Norbert Zongo, who was assas- 
sinated on December 13, 1998. Protests swelled and the 
government had to calm things down: it wiped out all the 
debts that farmers had contracted to purchase the pes- 
ticides. This was the first time in any farmer’s living 
memory that the State backed down in the face of 
angry protests. 
The FENOP is proud of that victory, but it had to keep 
on fighting, this time on the broader front of farm 
industry liberalization. In the 1980s, structural adjustment 
policies had dealt severe blows to farm aid such as sub- 
sidized fertilizers and training. Moreover,lower import 
duties helped to increase competition between national 
and foreign products on the domestic market. Intergo- 
vernmental accords signed in January 2000 in the fra- 
mework of West Africa’s regional integration policy only 
furthered the trend towards lower customs barriers. 
And, as usual, nobody asked small farmers what they 
thought. 
In this context, the FENOP started two battles, 
one against bananas from Coéte d’Ivoire, the other 
against rice from Asia, both symbols of trade liberaliza- 
tion. But the struggle against bananas from Cote d'Ivoire 
seems futile. Even though they do not taste as good as 
Burkina Faso’s smaller fruit, they look better and cost 
less. Grown on large, modern plantations, they also 
benefit from better agricultural conditions and a more 
clement climate. 
The battle against Asian rice, which is gradually 
replacing local grains, seems off to a better start but 
depends on untangling a web of corruption.“We have 
conducted an investigation,” says Ouédraogo, “to show 
that a ton of that rice costs 25 per cent less on the 
market at Quagadougou than it would if the importers 
paid all the duties.” He adds that Burkina Faso’s rice “is 
of better quality because it comes from recent harvests, 
while the imported rice is sometimes seven to 10 years 
old. And there is not a shadow of a doubt that chemical 
preservatives had to be added to keep it from spoiling. 
But many consumers are unaware of all that.” 
Winning market shares 
without selling out 
According to its leaders, the FENOP is fighting so that 
producers are no longer left out of the global economy 
and can win positions on future markets. The group goes 
out into the field to inform and train farmers, while pro- 
ducing films for national television about promising 
crops, such as oil seeds, shea and sesame. For example, 
few farmers know that sesame brought in some $4.2 mil- 
lion two years ago. That tidy sum was harvested because 
of the quality of Burkina Faso’s crop, grown without fer- 
tilizers (because farmers cannot afford them) at a time 
when organic products are becoming increasingly 
popular in Europe and Asia. 
So opening up borders sometimes has positive 
effects. But Burkina Faso’s farmers must be careful not 
to sell their souls to the devil. “That is also what we 
defend. A kind of citizenship agriculture,” says Oué- 
draogo. “Like José Bové in France. In September 1999, 
we even adopted a motion of support for the imprisoned 
French farmer.” Faced with a government that is seeking 
to divide and denigrate the farmers’ movement, the 
FENOP knows it needs allies. At the beginning of July 
2000, the group helped to set up a regional organization 
of West African farmers’ movements and maintains 
contacts with Via Campesina, a worldwide movement 
to support farmers’ cultures and struggles. The Sahel and 
McDonald’s may not be at war yet, but farmers’orga- 
nizations are gearing up for the fray. |

health and welfare of humanity must not be 
sacrificed to the greed of the few,” declared 
Father Thomas Kocherry last year on being awarded 
the Sophie’s Prize, created by Norwegian novelist 
Jostein Gaardner, for his environmental work. Famed 
for his powerful oratory, this Catholic priest helped to 
create the World Forum of Fish Harvesters and Fish 
Workers in 1997, of which he is now a co-ordinator. 
1H T he life of the planet and the dependent 
The last ten years have been marked by a series of 
protests by fisherpeople across India, in which you 
have been deeply involved. Why are fishing 
communities so angry? 
In 1991 India introduced its new economic 
policy, which marked the beginning of a new deep 
sea fishing policy. Huge foreign vessels, working 
under the guise of joint ventures and fees paid to the 
government, were given licenses and started coming 
nto Indian waters. There are some 25,000 such ves- 
sels around the world. They have depleted all the 
oceans apart from the Indian Ocean, and are a 
threat to over 100 million people in developing 
countries who depend on fisheries for their liveli- 
hood. So this new policy was clearly going to affect 
Indian fisherpeople, and probably displace them. 
Ten million fisherpeople went on four all-India 
strikes. The government appointed the Murari com- 
mittee, which made 21 recommendations aimed at 
changing the entire deep sea fishing policy. These

were accepted by the Cabinet,and since 1996,the 
government has stopped giving new licenses. For 
probably the first time, a fishing community changed 
the policy of globalization through protest. 
Your movement has also expressed particular 
concern over shrimp production for export. 
First of all, you have to ask why aquacultures 
[shrimp farms] exist. It’s because a particular variety 
like shrimp, cuttle fish or salmon is already depleted, 
and is no longer available in the marine sector. But 
the very fact that it is a monoculture means trouble, 
because it depends on a high use of pesticides and 
artificial manure. This pollutes the entire area. Then 
the paddy-fields,which are meant for the people’s 
basic needs, are converted. Then the mangroves 
are destroyed, though they are the breeding ground 
for many species. By bringing in saline water, you 
pollute the drinking water meant for local people. 
The entire development [around 200,000 hectares 
of coastal land have been converted into shrimp 
farms] is displacing coastal people and fishing com- 
munities. And all this intensive aquaculture of 
shrimps is controlled by big companies,big inves- 
tors and big rich people—and funded by the World 
Bank.It is a philosophy of rape and run: you make 
the money fast,then you run away. 
In 1996, the Supreme Court ordered all the aqua- 
culture farms in the country to be abolished. But instead 
of abolishing them, the government and political parties 
sided with the World Bank and multinational companies, 
and ordered a review of the judgement. They then intro- 
duced a new Aquaculture Authority bill, which is pen- 
ding approval by the Upper House of Parliament. Fisher- 
people are very angry about this. 
How has the experience of Indian fishermen 
differed from that of other fishing communities 
around the world? 
Whether in India, the U.S. or Europe, small 
boats and small communities have no chance of sur- 
vival. Everywhere the pattern is the same:only the 
big will survive,and the rest will be wiped out. 
But globalization’s victims can change the situa- 
tion. From Senegal to Brazil, from Canada to South 
Africa, fisherpeople are struggling against destruc- 
tive fishing and the stronghold of multinationals. 
Local communities should be the custodians of 
this natural capital. [|

### 120409: Justice for janitors in Silicon Valley

Justice for Janitors 
in Silicon Valley 
  
D Victoria Elliott 
The other face of globalization 
By exposing the flagrant gap between rich and poor, janitors in America’s high-tech heartland 
have captured nationwide attention in their fight for decent working conditions 
Some will always 
be above others. 
Destroy the inequality 
today, 
and it will appear again 
tomorrow. 
Ralph Waldo Emerson, 
U.S. poet and essayist 
(1803-1882) 
  
D Editor at the San Francisco 
Chronicle 
travels about 15 miles (24 km) through the 
rush hour traffic each morning from Oakland, 
California, to his first job in San Ramon, where he 
shows up to work in a restaurant at 9 a.m. After five 
hours of work, he stops home again for a couple of 
hours, then crosses the San Mateo Bridge over the San 
Francisco bay and heads for the offices of Advanced 
Micro Devices, 26 miles (40 km) away in Sunny- 
vale.Here, he works as a janitor for his second shift of 
the day, from 6 p.m. to 2.30 a.m. The office workers 
are gone; only a few late night stragglers see him 
push his cart around, loaded with cleaning fluid and 
mops. By the time he gets home again, it’s 3:15 a.m. 
It’s surprising he had any energy left over to 
march, but this spring Mendoza was one of the 5,500 
janitors in Service Employees International Union, 
Local 1877, who came out with the Justice for Jani- 
tors movement to rally in Sunnyvale for decent wor- 
king conditions and better wages. They wore red T= 
shirts to make the point that invisible as they are, 
working out of the public view, they were determined 
to be seen.

In this they succeeded. Low-paid workers in a 
high-tech economy, they managed to capture atten- 
tion nationwide as cast-offs of the unprecedented 
growth in Silicon Valley. Working relentlessly to try to 
make ends meet, they have been left behind by an 
industry that has grown faster and produced more 
wealth than any other in the history of the world. 
At the World Trade Organization protests in Seattle 
in December, there was little talk of this volatile nexus 
of the world economy. And yet, according to one of the 
Seattle protesters, Raj Jayadev—a young Bay Area acti- 
vist who grew up in San Jose as the son of Indian 
immigrants—Silicon Valley brings together the key 
issues raised by globalization. 
“The labour struggle, the environmental degra- 
dation, the inequities, the falling standards of living, 
the importance of immigration — it’s all played out 
on the shop floors of Santa Clara County,” he says. 
Jayadev describes how he worked on the assembly line 
at Hewlett Packard, lifting boxes with an electrical 
engineer from the Punjab, an Eritrean with a degree 
in finance and a plant owner from Kerala, India, all of 
whom were acutely conscious of their drop in status.

While some circuit board assembly lines have 
since been exported abroad, to Taiwan,Korea,India 
and East Germany, janitors need not worry that their 
employers will pull out and move elsewhere. The 
gleaming office buildings in Cupertino and on the 
man-made lake at Redwood Shores are not going 
away. 
But the janitors have also been caught in the cha- 
racteristic bind of the new economy. Conditions of 
employment in California have grown increasingly 
tenuous as the new economy goes from strength to 
strength. According to Working Partnerships, a labour 
think-tank based in San Jose, 45 per cent of Califor- 
nians now have no more than two years’ tenure in their 
current jobs, and temporary employment agencies bet- 
ween 1993 and 1998 expanded by 182,900 people — 
more than the net job growth in the software and elec- 
tronic industries combined. The trend toward 
outsourcing, as businesses pare down extraneous 
employees to concentrate on their core business,has 
been felt throughout the workforce. 
Fourteen years earlier, workers like Mendoza 
would have been in-house employees earning as 
much as $14 an hour at such firms as Hewlett Pac- 
kard. But in the economic slump of the early 1990s, 
the high-tech firms reaped a bonus, spinning off jani- 
torial work, along with such services as landscaping 
and security, to competing independent contractors 
and substantially bringing down the cost of janitors’ 
labour, to around $8 an hour.

On strike: in Los Angeles, a member of the janitor’s union marches for better pay. 
The Silicon Valley giants in turn argued that they 
» had no responsibility for the workers that the sub- 
contractors brought in to sweep their marble halls. 
| Janitors’leaders,however, have not hesitated to exploit 
their position as a symbol of the vast disparities of 
wealth in the area. “It was a larger question that 
brought so much attention: What are we going to do 
with our poor in today’s booming economy?” says 
Mike Garcia, the president of the local janitors union. 
“These people were working two to three jobs and 
trying to raise a family. Meanwhile,they’re cleaning 
the edifices of the filthy rich, the overnight billio- 
naires and millionaires. How could they explain that 
their janitors are living two to three families in a 
garage?”

union’s recent struggles have centred on immigration 
issues and health insurance. “We devised a strategy 
where we were able to talk not so much about wages 
as about the conditions the workers live in,” says 
Csekey. “The backdrop was going to the clients and 
saying: “These people work within your walls. You've 
got some level of responsibility here.” 
And finally, faced with a chorus of protest from 
other unions, Catholic bishops and local politicians, 
executives at the biotech firm Genentech and the 
telecommunications company Pacific Bell were 
shamed into admitting responsibility for workers they 
had refused to acknowledge. 
"The contract the janitors settled in June, without 
going on strike, was the most generous in the history 
of the union. It provides for an eight per cent annual 
increase in their hourly pay over the next three years, 
from $7.64 or $8.04, depending on which county they 
work in, to $9.64 or $10.04. But that is hardly going 
to help them move out of the converted garages they 
live in, where a small two-bedroom house can fetch 
$750,000. 
After prevailing both in the Bay Area and in Los 
Angeles, the union is now concentrating on the jani- 
tors of Sacramento. The expiration of the contracts it 
has just negotiated has been synchronized, so that in 
three years, 14,000 janitors across California will be 
acting in concert. 
The dispossessed 
Much of the workforce of Silicon Valley is as yet 
unorganized, from the crews at Internet start-ups 
who work 14-hour days and camp out in their offices 
to the lower echelons. In the almost entirely non- 
unionized “clean rooms” that assemble circuits, Asian 
workers are often wary of joining a union, sometimes 
because their immigration status is uncertain. 
But among the ranks of the janitors,many of whom 
are also undocumented, the Mexican tradition of orga- 
nizing is strong. “They understand the concept of 
unionization,” says Garcia. “They’re not confused at all 
that our powers lie in our ability to come together.” 
Garcia is anxious to make common cause with the 
increasingly dispossessed middle classes. The strike, 
he feels, has helped to turn around the climate of xeno- 
phobia that swept through California over proposed 
anti-immigrant legislation. “People look at immi- 
grants in a much more positive vein today,’ he says, 
“as hard-working people trying to advance them- 
selves.” 
Marianne Steeg, staff director of the South Bay 
Labor Council, argues that the janitors’strike helped 
to draw attention to questions of the area’s social 
contract, putting the need for affordable housing, 
transportation and health care firmly at the top of the 
political agenda. 
“School teachers, firemen, health workers — so 
many of our workers who can no longer afford to live 
here —no longer identify with the upper-middle class, 
but with the working poor,” she says, adding that the 
strike put a dent in the shining armour of the high-tech 
firms. “They can no longer claim that the prosperity 
of Silicon Valley means prosperity for all.” |

ging from a paradox that can be formulated in 
many different ways but which boils down to a 
simple truth: humanity will have to make some 
pretty fundamental changes if it wants to survive. We 
clearly cannot rely on the main political and eco- 
nomic players—imprisoned in their agendas, ham- 
pered by short-sightedness and practical 
constraints—to take up the challenge.Instead,it’s 
up to the ordinary citizens to organize on a global 
scale, and change from being powerless to taking a 
stand, joining the debate and drafting a different way 
forward. 
The Charles Léopold Mayer! Foundation for 
Human Progress was set up in 1982 in Geneva 
with the aim of linking activism in the world to 
study of the future. At the time, our societies, though 
richer and wiser than ever before, seemed singularly 
unable to satisfy the hopes 
and most basic needs of 
their members. We had 
to weave a closer relation- 
ship between thought and 
action, between advances 
in knowledge and possibilities for human progress. 
The foundation started out by supporting 
endeavours that brought these elements together— 
a novelty at the time—but these initiatives still 
remained isolated “projects.” For example, one 
project in Brazil involved assistance in building a net- 
work across 10 regions to gather information on tra- 
ditional branches of knowledge and contrast the fin- 
dings with modern science. In Tanzania, a project 
aimed to improve agricultural training by making it 
more attuned to small farmers’ needs. 
While involved in these projects, we made two 
discoveries. Firstly, we found that solutions to pro- 
blems must be made on the basis of each particular 
social context, though the problems themselves are 
broadly the same. A common denominator of issues 
cropped up in all the projects, no matter where 
they were taking place. But these shared characte 
ristics were often hidden by the sheer complexity of 
local circumstances, rigid mindsets, institutional 
factors and different schools of knowledge. 
This common denominator became the very 
basis of our programmes, and explains the impor- 
tance we have attached to establishing networks. 
t all starts with a sense of powerlessness, sprin- 
1. Charles Léopold Mayer (1881-1971) was a philosopher, 
chemist,philanthropist and long-term investor. The 
foundation’s budget is exclusively financed by revenue from 
his wealth,to the tune of approximately $8 million a year. 
It's up to the ordinary citizens 
to organize on a global scale, 
and change from being 
powerless to taking a stand. 
Equipping some of our partners with Internet, a 
potentially formidable tool for democratic progress, 
has thus become one of the foundation’s priorities. 
Our second discovery was that the most useful 
knowledge for future action comes from practice, 
namely from one’s own experience and that of others 
— experience that must be identified and recorded so 
others can learn from it. Hence the need to store 
information and circulate it by creating a tool for 
communication that can become a type of “collec- 
tive intelligence.” Since 1986, the foundation has gra- 
dually built up an international database for sharing 
experience,establishing first of all norms for orga- 
nizing and distributing the information. Today, this 
corpus of shared experience covers a wide area, 
from the geopolitics of drugs and social exclusion in 
Asia to the management of difficult neighbourhoods 
in northern France and innovative educational 
methods in Brazil. Some 
8,000 contributions from 
citizens and local, regional 
and national institutions, 
research centres and NGOs 
are gathered in the data- 
base, while the Association of Chinese Mayors has 
expressed interest in adopting it for future use. 
By enabling some of our network’s members to 
become more knowledgeable than recognized 
experts in the field, these tools are among the key 
elements that will help take “civil society” into its 
third historical phase.A first period of protest was 
followed by participation in major world forums,to 
which we brought a critical voice. Now we are gea- 
ring up for a new era of initiative by connecting the 
alternative strategies and visions that people around 
the world are searching for, weighing up and inven- 
ting. All these alternatives are based on the simple 
premise: think locally, act globally. 
This new unity, built over time and striving to rea- 
lize a common goal through respect for the particu- 
larities of every place, is the essence of the Alliance for 
a Responsible and United World. Set up in 1993, it has 
partners in 115 countries, and made its most recent 
project a bid to “encourage the definition and prac- 
tical application of a form of ‘world governance’that 
meets the challenges of the 21st century.” [|

Governance: 
time for a radical remake 
  
D Ivan Briscoe 
Despite their vastly different agendas, NGOs stand united in their plea for stemming 
the power of transnational corporations through more plural global structures 
"Why, then the 
world’s mine oyster, 
Which I with sword 
will open.” 
The Merry Wives of 
Windsor, William 
Shakespeare, 
English dramatist and poet 
(1564-1616) 
ted down trade representatives and finance officials 
over the past year in Seattle, Washington and Bang- 
kok bore few of the hallmarks of traditional opposition. There 
was no formal hierarchy to speak of, no single nationality, no 
clear shared cause. In the eyes of one pro-business group, the 
new genre of activism mimicked a political “swarm.” 
Yet though the diversity of the groups—from northern 
steel unions to disappearing tribes—seemed to many critics 
like rank incoherence, the movement’s leaders stress that this 
very variety stands at the heart of their political project. In 
place of the uniform spread of commercial values,derided by 
leading U.S. campaigner Lori Wallach as a “one size fits all 
philosophy,” they plead for new distribution of power that is 
porous enough to allow room for other interests. 
“There’s been an invasion in inappropriate spaces by 
unaccountable, unalterable trade rules,” declares Wallach, 
whose public profile has soared since helping to co-ordinate 
the Seattle protests as director of 
the Public Citizen’s Global Trade 
Watch. “A version of the rules has 
been imposed that has much more 
to do with corporate input than 
the input from public interest . . . Thats the democracy 
deficit in the global economy.” 
In the eyes of campaigners, the rapid, government- 
approved spread of the free market has stripped political 
debate of any interest in the virtues that found a good society 
or legitimate global order. But the questions remain: how can 
the corporate bottom line be eclipsed with the least economic 
damage? What reforms are needed, and where? 
According to Walden Bello, executive director of the 
Bangkok-based Focus on the Global South, globalization 
must be rescued from its current “monolithic, uniform and 
universalistic character” that has seen transnational corpo- 
rations account for a majority of the world’s exports and global 
inequality more than double since 1960. 
A chief culprit, he argues, is “the free market biases of the 
framework pushed by the trinity of the World Trade Orga- 
nization (WTO), the World Bank and the International Mone- 
tary Fund (IMF), which are fundamentally antithetical to the 
A s protest movements go, the mass gatherings that shou-

cut them down to size—make them just ordinary 
actors among a plural set of actors in the global eco- 
nomy.” 
But the problem, as many activists agree, is that 
there are scanty fora for these demands to be heard and 
acted upon. National governments are seen as weak in 
the face of global finance, or in the case of developing 
nations,hamstrung by the obligations of IMF -sponsored 
debt reduction programmes and foreign aid. Business 
itself has no wish to see its wings clipped, while inter- 
national bodies—from the United Nations to the 
WT0 ’s infamous “green room” trade talks, allegedly 
dominated by rich nations—appear saddled with unde- 
mocratic structures and practices. The only way out, 
campaigners argue, is a radical remake of governance. 
In the short-term, the priorities are clear. ForWal- 
lach, the punch-drunk WT0 must be swiftly levelled: “it’s 
shrink or sink for the WT0,” she says. “Many of our cur- 
rent environmental, labour 
and human rights agree- 
ments are illegal trade bar- 
riers under WTO rules.” 
Besides a shrunken trade 
organization, activists also call for the world’s two 
main lending bodies to be stripped of the power to pres- 
cribe standard austerity packages. In Bello’s opinion, 
the IMF and World Bank need to be balanced by an 
array of other bodies including regional trading blocs 
like ASEAN, strong labour and environmental agencies, 
and an official body to represent developing coun- 
tries. This would give “more space to take independent 
paths to development,” he argues. 
Over the longer term, the proposals become hazier. 
Essentially defensive in nature, few NGOs involved in 
the campaign against globalization have drawn up 
detailed blueprints for a new world power structure. The 
ideas that have been suggested tend to stress the need 
to reinforce global bodies so they can patrol the new 
breed of footloose corporations, while bringing the 
roots of power down to the local level,viewed as the 
most accountable level of democracy. Some groups, like 
the Penang-based Third World Network,advocates a

whole arsenal of global governance: a more demo- 
cratic United Nations to include civil society repre- 
sentatives, a code of ethics for worldwide businesses, 
and new global agencies for competition, investment 
and crime. 
Of all levels of governance, the nation-state seems the 
least favoured by NGOs. Either as a result of the flawed 
development and environmental destruction forged by 
countries such as Brazil and India since World War II, or 
as a result of current political failures, few groups favour 
giving greater powers to national executives. Even Wal- 
lach is quick to stress that universal trade rules of a 
basic anti-tariff nature are essential. 
In contrast, several activists in developing countries 
tout Europe, where the union’s powers appear to co- 
exist reasonably well with local and national decision- 
making, as an attractive model. But the “sovereignty 
mindset,” warns Jan Aart Scholte, reader in Interna- 
tional Studies at Britain’s University of Warwick, 
remains strong: “people tend not yet to have the poli- 
tical imagination to think of governance beyond the 
state as a place where their interests can be served.” In 
the case of proposed global environmental and labour 
protection rules, for instance, developing countries 
have already cried foul. 
For some NGOs, however, neither global reform nor 
local powers are the key to greater equity and sustainable 
development. Instead, the mission is to educate, 
enlighten and convert, so that the driving force of cor- 
porate growth —the tastes of each global consumer— 
are restrained. “If the world lived like the Americans or 
Europeans,” says Ngai Weng Chan, chairman of the 
Malaysian Nature Society, “we would be doomed.” ll 
The role of NGOs should be to foster the emergence of a worldwide civil society, the first step 
towards making globalization a more democratic affair

### 120412: NGOs: searching for solid ground

» NGOs, our attention is directed at civil society 
itself. 
At the global level, our basic task is to foster the 
emergence of a worldwide civil society as a pre- 
condition to calling for a new style of globalization: 
“world governance.” Our mission is to encou- 
rage the re-founding of globalization along more 
democratic lines by taking part in public debate 
and promulgating the concept of world citizenship. 
The political stances we take and our lobbying 
activities, therefore, do not come out of the blue, 
but are efforts to transmit the main currents and 
aspirations of public opinion and make this opi- 
nion stronger and clearer. 
The tripartite 
mirage 
All NGO actions 
are based on a ob- 
vious priority, namely 
that of supporting 
social protests and 
public pressure during 
major negotiations 
taking place within 
the main circles of 
power. That is why 
the agreements we 
conclude and the 
alliances we forge are 
above all else aimed 
at organizations and 
movements arising 
from civil society. 
That is also why we 
build forums, co- 
alitions and networks 
that straddle national 
borders. On the basis 
of our approach, we 
can think globally, set 
up links between the 
particular and the 
i “Planeta rspectives.” universal, swap expe- clary perspectives 
 
  
panies and civil society—that some people are 
campaigning for? In my opinion, all of that is just 
a mirage; even worse, we risk losing sight of our 
most useful and most legitimate purpose if we 
embrace that vision. 
Small players, 
big issues 
NGOs are not out to conquer power or win 
elections, be they world,national or local bodies. 
We are not set up like political parties, even 
though our activities are public and seem highly 
politicized. We cannot even present ourselves as 
representatives of civil society because civil 
society has not entrusted us with any such 
mandate. 
So what do we want? To reach out, mobilize, 
educate, get across 
messages, suggest, 
innovate,persuade and 
politically strengthen 
various groups in civil 
society and, more spe- 
cifically, those excluded 
from the decision- 
making process. We 
want to give a voice to 
ideas, values,questions 
and proposals that 
involve social justice, a 
more equitable distri- 
bution of wealth, res- 
pect for the environ- 
ment, the struggle 
against poverty and 
social exclusion. 
Who are we? Small 
players, compared to 
the other pillars of civil 
society, such as trade 
unions and profes- 
a sional organizations,or 
bodies in the state or 
the market. But we are 
riences and keep ourselves regularly informed. 
"Today, global power is monopolized by major 
multilateral organizations, and is fundamentally 
anti-democratic in its structure and workings. In 
their current form, these organizations’ claims to 
embody democracy and universal citizenship ring 
hollow. In fact, their only possible claim to legiti- 
macy is through the vote. But not all the national 
governments represented in international orga- 
nizations have been elected by popular suffrage, 
and very few of them represent all the different 
social forces that go into making up their nations. 
Does this mean that NGOs, which are sup- 
posed to embody civil society, should claim to 
represent these peoples? Does it mean that our 
goal should be to win a place at the heart of a 
future new world democratic order? Does it mean 
that we are fully entitled to a seat in some new tri- 
partite structure—made up of government, com- 
36 The Unesco Courier - September 2000 
also—and this is something new—“big” players, 
because our mission and our field of action are not 
limited to a given society, national economy or 
single government. Our task is to form a bridge 
between the local and the global: in other words, 
to deal with what is universal, with what is 
common to all humanity. Human rights, social 
crises and environmental protection are global 
issues. We deal with them in specific situations, but 
our perspective is always planetary. 
So where does our legitimacy lie? In the qua- 
lity of the values,principles and ideals we defend. 
In the relevance and the importance of the issues 
we raise. In the inventiveness of the proposals we 
put forward. Our only source of legitimacy is our 
ability to develop ideas aimed at action—ideas that 
are up to the standards of public duty to which we 
aspire. [|

SPORT MEDICINE: 
TO HEAL OR TO WIN? 
 
D Philippe Liotard 
  
ETHICS 
On the eve of the Sydney Olympic Games, sport medicine is faced with ethical dilemmas that 
stretch well beyond the domain of top-level competition 
Advances in life sciences and biotech- 
nology are stirring up a broad debate 
about ethics. Expert committees are 
being called upon to bring ethical codes in 
line with genetic research developments, 
assisted reproduction, prenatal screening 
and the prospects for human cloning. 
Standards for clinical reseach on 
humans,spelt out in the 1947 Nuremburg 
Rules, are now being challenged by medical 
advances and research unimaginable in

international ethics committees, along with 
medical and research groups. This is the 
most public part of the debate, the issues 
that make headlines. 
But medical ethics involve far more than 
these issues, which are all essential to ima- 
gining the kind of “humanity” that we are

### 120413: Sport medicine: to heal or to win?

ETHICS 
especially true in the case of drug-taking 
» (or doping) in sport, which can be seen as 
the logical outcome of a performance- 
based type of medical practice. Oddly 
enough, discussion about doping is gene- 
rally reduced to a few clichés: it is branded 
as unethical in light of an imaginary spor- 
ting ideal. Calls are made for better drug- 
testing and stiffer punishment for “cheats” 
and their accomplices. But this skates over 
the real issue—the pressures of competi- 
tion in sport—and hides it even further 
from the public, doctors and authorities. 
Doping in high-pressure sports can 
hardly be equated with reckless or rash 
behaviour. On the contrary, it requires the 
conscious involvement of the competitor 
who personally controls the state of his 
or her own body and training. The athlete 
is led to take drugs daily to reduce fatigue 
and to increase muscle power, or to recover 
quickly from an injury or excessive trai- 
ning, for example. The scandal over the 
Tour de France bicycle race in 1998 
showed how riders knowingly and perso- 
nally take banned substances in order to 
endure tough training and back-to-back 
races throughout a whole season. 
So the real ethical debate rests solely on 
medical practice. It means we should reflect 
on how doctors respond to requests from 
athletes at all levels, for doping is also on 
the rise among amateurs and children. 
The scandal over the Tour de 
France bicycle race in 1998 
showed how riders knowingly 
and personally take banned 
substances in order to endure 
tough training and back-to- 
back races throughout a whole 
season. 
 
At the 43rd American Health 
Congress, held in Washington in Sep- 
tember 1996, Thomas H. Murray, of the 
Center for Biomedical Ethics at Case Wes- 
tern Reserve University (Cleveland,Ohio), 
recounted how a mother asked for growth 
hormones for her son to improve his spor- 
ting performance. There are two factors 
behind this request. First, advances in 
medical biotechnology have made it pos- 
sible to produce artificial hormones. 
Second, the drive to win draws the doctor 
into altering the body to make it perform 
better. 
All medical codes of ethics condemn 
doctors acceding to such requests. The 
World Medical Association calls on every 
38 The Unesco Courier - September 2000 
doctor to “oppose and 
refuse to administer or 
condone” methods that 
aim at “an unnatural 
increase or maintenance 
of performance during 
competition” or which 
“artificially change fea- 
tures appropriate to age 
and sex” (1981 Declara- 
tion on Principles of 
Health Care for Sport 
Medicine, amended in 
1999).

Hormone boosts 
But many doctors 
must still deal with the 
consequences of sporting 
activity. Physiologically, 
sport depletes a person’s 
natural reserves,especially 
hormones. Intensive train- 
ing for example, uses up 
the male hormone testos- 
terone faster than the 
body replaces it. A doctor 
can put an athlete on sup- 
plements to make up for 
that loss, just as iron or 
vitamins are prescribed 
for people lacking them. 
So a deficiency in the 
body is made up for 
without any regard for 
what might have caused 
it in the first place—such 
as malnutrition, overwork 
or disease. 
We do not yet have a 
separate branch of medi- 
cine dealing with perfor- 
mance. So far, it is just a 
few doctors straying from 
the original purposes of 
medicine. In the richest 
countries and among the 
elites in poor nations,

such medicine is in 
demand as a medical prop to cope with 
the new emphasis placed on performance 
in all spheres of life. This is also very 
similar in principle to anti-ageing treat- 
ments, where health care is being adjusted 
to the fact that people are living longer. 
Hormone replacement therapy in elderly 
people is aimed at “improving the quality 
of life to match the extra number of years 
gained,” according to Dr. Bruno Deli- 
gnicres, head of the endocrinology service 
at the Necker Hospital in Paris. Here too, 
hormonal adjustment is being prescribed 
because of progress in life sciences and 
patients’ requests for drugs to alleviate the 
effects of ageing. The doctor is responding 
to a person’s natural desire to improve 
their physical condition. Just like cos- 
metic surgery and treatments for impo- 
tence, which have been boosted by the 
invention of the drug Viagra, medicine is 
turning towards satisfying desires, spurred 
by images of well-being and youth. The 
pressure to get, maintain or preserve an 
“efficient” body and a “slim” figure is 
steadily increasing. The same goes for 
reducing pain during childbirth, old age 
and of course in everyday life, which

## [Page 39](120395eng.pdf#page=39) 0

### 120413: Sport medicine: to heal or to win?

includes sporting activity. 
So one might think there is nothing 
wrong with prescribing drugs which 
improve the quality of an athlete’s life, 
marked by intense physical activity. Figh- 
ting against stress, recovering from long- 
term fatigue, using anti-inflammatory 
drugs to reduce pain caused by intense 
exertion become normal given social 
expectations of chemically-assisted well- 
being. 
But testosterone and related products, 
such as nandrolone, are classified as ana- 
bolic steroids and are the substances most 
frequently detected during drug testing. 
When taken in big doses, together with 
sufficient food and training, testosterone 
increases body mass, strength and muscle 
power as well as aggressivity and resis- 
tance to fatigue and pain. Corticoid drugs 
also reduce pain and help a person to tire 
less easily. So these substances are very 
suitable for easing the physical effects and 
psychological pressures of competitive 
sport. 
The crucial issue lies in deciding where 
medical efforts to restore equilibrium end 
and efforts to improve performance begin. 
An artificial dividing line has been drawn. 
A scale has been devised to measure the 
quantity of “supplements.” Medical tests 
can now detect if a person has taken 
“unreasonable” amounts of substances 
that are no longer banned, but tolerated up 
to a certain point. 
The good health riddle 
Medical ethics do not require a doctor 
to ask whether someone is “cheating” 
under the rules of sport. A doctor does not 
have to take a stand on demands made in 
fields other than his own. The problem is 
how to define the state of health that the 
doctor aims for, not the level of doping. 
The World Medical Association’s Geneva 
Declaration (adopted in 1948 and 
amended in 1983) is clear: “The health of 
my patient will be my first considera- 
tion,” a doctor is supposed to pledge. So 
it naturally condemns “procedures to 
mask pain or other protective symptoms 
if used to enable the athlete to take part 
in an event when lesions or signs are pre- 
sent which make his participation inad- 
visable.” 
Doctors (in sport or otherwise) who 
engage in these practices are not perfor- 
ming their duty towards patients (which 
involves prescribing a halt to painful acti- 
vity) but are complying with the demands 
of sport. From an ethical standpoint, a 
desired performance must not be taken 
into account in the course of diagnosis or 
treatment. Medical ethics condemn any 
action dictated by interests or pressures not 
related to the goal of good health. 
This is where the debate gets really 
tricky, because in modern parlance and 
in the language of doping in sport, good 
health is understood to mean the absence 
of illness or lasting after-effects. However, 
since 1940, the World Health Organization 
has defined good health as a combined 
state of physical, emotional and social 
well-being. The Centre for Health Pro- 
motion at the University of Toronto, points 
out that good health is not an end in itself 
but a means to a balanced life. 
This makes good health a quest for 
well-being based on individual aspirations

in a particular social and cultural context. 
Put this way, it becomes something extre- 
mely subjective and changeable according 
to the time and place as well as the sex, age 
and social class of the person involved. 
Each individual decides on the basis of 
his or her own life and cultural environ- 
ment a relationship to well-being, pain 
and illness. 
Sport presents doctors with a paradox. 
Most of them believe physical activity 
ETHICS 
makes for a balanced life. But they are 
also well aware that competition upsets 
this balance, and that chemical-based treat- 
ments can be prescribed to supplement 
deficiencies. If they respond to such 
demands, they are only reinforcing the 
alienating emphasis put on performance at 
all costs, of which sport is just the most 
striking example. 
Science 
at the altar 
of performance? 
But doctors can still, without any 
qualms of conscience, refuse to play the 
game and deplore the effects of a hectic 
life-style imposed by the obligation to 
perform. Acting in the interest of patients’ 
welfare involves teaching them how to 
pursue a balanced life. A doctor’s duty is 
to tell patients why they are ill. If this 
can be done without problem where obe- 
sity and the dangers of smoking or drin- 
king are concerned, the same goes where 
the dangerous effects of sport are 
involved. 
Sport medicine is a forerunner of the 
medicine of the future—a medicine at 
the behest of institutions in the business 
of boosting efficiency. It runs the risk of 
ushering in a common norm dictating 
people’s appearance (through cosmetic 
surgery), character (through prenatal dia- 
gnosis) and social behaviour, namely 
through the demand for performance in 
all fields, be it professional, sexual or spor- 
ting. [|

### 120414: Kosovo: burned books and blasted shrines

KOSOVO: BURNED BOOKS 
AND BLASTED SHRINES 
    
Kosovo's cultural heritage was deliberately targetted during the 1998-1999 conflict says 
Harvard University’s Andras Riedimayer’, co-author of the first survey assessing the damage 
You spent three weeks in Kosovo in October 
1999 documenting damage to cultural 
heritage. What were your main findings? 
Kosovo’s 600-year-old Islamic heritage 
suffered large-scale devastation during the 
“ethnic cleansing” operations. More than one 
third of the region’s 600 mosques were des- 
troyed or seriously damaged. A standard tech- 
nique was to pack the base of the minaret with 
explosives so that the stone spire would col- 
lapse onto the building and smash the dome. 
We found racist anti-Albanian and anti-Isla- 
mic grafitti inside, Korans with pages ripped 
out and smeared with feces, and crosses car- 
ved into the mosques’ mihrabs [prayer niche]. 
Valuable collections of Islamic manuscripts 
were burned. The 500-year-old mosque and 
historic centre of Vucitrn was set afire and 
completely bulldozed by Serb paramilitaries. 
Of Kosovo’s four well-preserved Ottoman- 
era urban centres, only one, Prizren,escaped 
such devastation. 
The other great loss are the kullas —stone 
mansions typical of Albanian residential archi- 
tecture. They tended to belong to the more 
prominent Albanian families and had been in 
the same hands for 150-200 years. As such 
they were filled with artifacts and documents 
and were regarded as symbols of Albanian 
culture in Kosovo. Barely ten per cent of the 
region’s 500 kullas survived the war. All this 
demonstrates that the damage was clearly not 
collateral. It was very intentional. 
There have been allegations that the Serbian 
heritage also suffered damage. 
As soon as the conflict broke out, Belgra- 
de’s Information Ministry and several conser- 
vation institutes claimed that NATO was deli- 
berately targetting Serbian patrimonial sites. 
We visited each one of the sites for which 
damage was claimed and found these allega- 
tions to be unsubstantiated. At the end of the 
war, KFOR! troops were stationed to guard 
the most famous monasteries and churches. 
D Andras Riedimayer, Aga Khan Program Bibliographer 
at Harvard's Fine Art Library, conducted the Kosovo 
Cultural Heritage Survey in October 1999 with colleague 
Andrew Herscher, an architect and architectural historian.

The ruins of the kulla of Jashar Pasha, burned in May 1999 by Serbs. 
However,many village churches became easy 
targets for revenge by returning Kosovar vil- 
lagers. A majority of the attacked buildings 
were built in the 20th century, and quite a 
large number during the 1990s. These were 
seen as political monuments and were espe- 
cially targetted. Since the end of the war,as 
far as we can tell, about 40 churches have been 
badly damaged and 40 vandalized to some 
extent. While most were modern, about a 
dozen were genuinely ancient structures. 
Where do reconstruction efforts stand? 
"The buildings being restored are those that 
can be fixed quickly, which means concrete 
frame modern buildings. Unfortunately, the 
UN agencies in charge in Kosovo don’t have 
much of a budget for reconstruction projects 
and the fate of cultural heritage has not ranked 
very high among the international commu- 
nity’s concerns. Our Kosovo Cultural Heri- 
tage Project recently obtained funding for the 
reconstruction of three damaged historical 
monuments in Kosovo?. Another initiative 
enabled the Institute for the Protection of 
Monuments of Kosovo to clear the rubble, 
stabilize and cover with plastic sheeting close 
to 100 of the most endangered historic 
buildings. In the case of the mosques, Saudi- 
based Islamic aid agencies are bringing their 
own sectarian agenda to reconstruction, as it 
happened in Bosnia. They notably frown on 
all decorations and consider some practices 
common elsewhere in the Muslim world to 
be verging on the idolatrous. 
Are the Albanians intent on rebuilding their 
heritage at this point? 
There is a tremendous desire to rebuild 
their own heritage. People are immensely 
devoted to it and that’s why it was targetted. 
But there is a lack of funding, and above all, 
a lack of expertise. Through our project, we 
hope to establish methodologies adapted to 
the local context and foster links between local 
and foreign professionals. [|

War’s end, Western Europeans were 
shaken by television images of a downpour 
of explosives falling upon the sleepy little 
Danube town of Vukovar, and plumes of 
smoke snaking their way over Dubrovnik, “the 
jewel of the Adriatic” and a World Heritage 
site. From 1991 to 1999, countries of the 
former Yugoslavia were subjected to war. While 
moderate commentators referred to a cam- 
paign of “ethnic cleansing,” those targeted by 
the violence spoke of “genocide.” It is precisely 
on this count and for crimes against humanity

Other terms emerged during these wars: 
“urbicide” to describe the bombing of cities 
such as Mostar and Sarajevo in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina, and “cultural cleansing” or “cul- 
tural genocide” to indicate the fate of mosques, 
churches,museums,archives,libraries,schools, 
and so on. Inevitably, these terms were part of 
a propaganda war, but all too often, they 
reflected the new landscapes of Croatia,Bosnia 
and Herzegovina, and more recently, of Kosovo. 
The deliberate destruction in wartime of 
cultural heritage is no historical novelty. Some- 
times destruction has been an affair of pillaging 
for profit, at others it has been part of the 
widely recognized right to annihilate the 
enemy. During World War I, churches and old 
town centres were reduced to rubble out of 
military necessity. During World War II, large 
German urban centres disappeared as part 
of strategic “area bombing” by Common- 
wealth airforces. 
But there are other reasons. The physical 
genocide of Europe’s Jews by the Nazis was 
accompanied by a cultural genocide—the des- 
truction of synagogues, cemeteries and other 
landmarks and treasures. 
In the case of the former Yugoslavia, the 
heritage sites destroyed for purely military rea- 
sons were few and far between. History

reminds us that sacral buildings have been 
destroyed time and time again in the Balkans. 
The longstanding belief that the Ottoman 
armies, in the 15th century, were gentle with 
Christian heritage might well be a myth.Later, 
in the 19th century, the conquering Hapsburg 
armies and Catholic administrators in Croatia 
turned a handful of mosques into churches and 
destroyed the rest. More recently, during World 
War II, massive destruction of Serbian 
Orthodox churches was carried out in Croatia 
and parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina by the fas- 
cist Ustasha forces. Ruins in Eastern Slavonia 
and Krajina, prominently Serb areas of Croatia, 
stand as tangible reminders of this period. 
But the more recent events are of a sin- 
gularly different nature. We are not referring to 
foreign powers invading a territory and swee- 
ping aside everything in their wake. We are in 
the presence of old societies which were to 
some extent integrated, but in the process of 
breaking up. The Serbian inhabitants of Croa- 
tian Krajina were not newcomers to the region 
in 1991. Croats, Muslims and Serbs have 
lived together in Bosnia and Herzegovina 
since the 16th century. And more recently, in 
the 20th century, mixed marriages in cities and 
towns played a significant role in weaving the 
social fabric. In the countryside, where people 
often settled by ethnic belonging, the situation 
was different. Accordingly, during the war, 
when Muslims, Croats, Serbs or Kosovar 
Albanians were chased out of their villages 
while their mosques and churches were mined 
THE MOSTAR BRIDGE: 
REBIRTH OF AN EMBLEM 
t took no more than 30 minutes for Stari Most 
(“The Old Bridge"), the emblematic symbol of 
Mostar’s multicultural past, to be destroyed by 
bombardment from a Croatian army tank on 
November 9, 1993. Completed in 1566 after nine 
years of work, the bridge, designed by the Ottoman 
architect Mimar Hayruddin, once rose high above 
the emerald waters of the Neretva, connecting its 
east and west banks. 
The 29-metre-long stone arch bridge, a World 
Heritage site, gave the town its name and stimulated 
its blossoming from a tiny medieval settlement to a 
thriving trading centre that attracted merchants and 
travellers from across the region. This is where local 
couples romanced and young men dove into the 
river below in a famed annual contest. At the out- 
break of the war, inhabitants cushioned the bridge 
with car tyres in an attempt to protect the struc- 
ture. It was first damaged in 1992 by Yugoslav Army 
shelling. 
   
As soon as the bridge was destroyed, local 
architects and heritage experts who had fled the aty 
started building a network to plan the reconstruc- 
tion. In 1997, Hungarian military divers from the 
NATO-led peackeeeping force in Bosnia salvaged 
the bridge's stone blocks from the river bed and 
hoisted them from the water with technical assis- 
tance from the Hungarian bridge building com- 
pany Hidépito Rt. In 1998, Unesco, the World Bank 
and the City of Mostar launched a project to rebuild 
the bridge. Due to extensive damage, less of the sal- 
vaged stonework will be reused than expected and 
stones will likely be extracted from a nearby quarry 
used by Stari Most’s builders. 
And Mostarians are already preparing to see 
their city’s emblem resurrected. More precisely, 
the party begins on September 15, 2004 at 5 p.m. 
a date chosen in the midst of the war by Mostarian 
architects whose life work is now dedicated to 
rebuilding their town. [|

or burned, it was the “other”—“the forei- 
gner”’—who was being removed from the 
region. The public dream of the nationalists 
(and sometimes the unavowed secret dream of 
the villagers) was thus fulfilled: to be finally at 
peace, alone among our own people. The 
mythical pure rural world was created. 
In the cities and towns of Bosnia and Her- 
zegovina, destruction had a different signifi- 
cance. It was common to hear in Sarajevo 
and Mostar that synagogues, Christian 
churches and mosques are only 100 metres 
from each other. This may not in fact be true, 
but in people’s minds, it was. The cities enjoyed 
great religious foundations and were home 
to the finest Ottoman sacral heritage. A sense 
of integration had developed through a 
common attachment to places and shared 
spaces. The coexistence of religious traditions 
provided people with a common sense of 
ownership of sacral heritage.Serbs,Muslims 
and Croats also took equal pride in their 
secular buildings, such as the Sarajevo National 
and University Library. 
“Ethnicized” heritage 
All this was profoundly changed by war. 
Although we perceive destruction as barbaric, 
itis seen as an act of creation in the eyes of its 
perpetrators. In the countryside of Croatia 
and Bosnia and Herzegovina, it was the crea- 
tion—or the liberation—of a mythical rural 
society, with the symbols of the unwanted 
other—his minarets or church steeples—eli- 
minated from the horizon. But in the cities of 
Bosnia and Herzegovina, a common civic 
identity was destroyed, and along with it, the 
“other” inside the people. Secular and sacral 
heritage became ethnicized: before the war, 
nobody in Mostar would have said that the Old 
Bridge was a “Muslim” monument. Its des- 
truction by Croat tanks turned it into one. In 
Bosnia and Herzegovina, the impoverishment 
of the post-war cities is appalling, not simply 
because they are largely emptied of another 
ethnic group or of great sacral buildings. The 
surviving buildings, even intact, are simply 
ghosts from another age: the “other” has been 
eliminated at all levels, inside people and out- 
side on the streets. 
In this context, the restoration and rebuil- 
ding of cultural heritage can take on political 
and downright divisive dimensions: it is no 
longer a question of rebuilding what was held 
in common, but only “what was ours.” The 
technical problems of reconstruction are infi- 
nitely less important than the “de-ethniciza- 
tion” of heritage, and it is difficult to imagine 
how the Balkan societies will be able to over- 
come this problem. The only hope of restoring 
a once commonly held landscape lies in a 
commitment to do so by the ethnic or national 
group that carried out the crimes. [|

TO CYBORG BABIES 
  
D Sherry Turkle 
A “cybershrink” traces relations between children and their electronic pets and computer toys 
over three generations 
Children have always used their toys 
and playthings to create models for 
understanding their world. Fifty years 
ago, the genius of Swiss psychologist Jean 
Piaget showed it is the business of childhood 
to take objects and use how they “work”to 
construct theories of space,time,number, 
causality, life and mind. At that time, a 
child’s world was full of things that could be 
understood in simple, mechanical ways. A 
bicycle could be understood in terms of its 
pedals and gears, a windup car in terms of 
its clockwork springs. Children were able 
to take electronic devices such as basic 
radios and (with some difficulty) bring them 
into this “mechanical” system of unders- 
tanding. 
Revisiting Merlin 
But in the early 1980s, a first generation 
of computer toys changed the traditional 
story. When children removed the back of 
their computer toys to “see” how they 
worked, they found a chip, a battery, and 
some wires. Sensing that trying to unders- 
tand these objects “physically” would lead 
to a dead end,children tried to use a “psy- 
chological” kind of understanding. They 
asked themselves if the games were 
conscious, if they had feelings and even if 
they knew how to “cheat.” Earlier objects 
encouraged children to think in terms of a 
distinction between the world of psychology 
and the world of machines, but the com- 
puter did not. Its “opacity” encouraged 
children to see computational objects as 
psychological machines. 
Among the first generation of compu- 
tational objects was Merlin, which chal- 
lenged children to games of tic-tac-toe. For

children who had only played games with 
human opponents, reaction to this object 
was intense. For example, while Merlin fol- 
lowed an optimal strategy for winning tic- 
tac-toe most of the time, it was programmed 
to make a slip every once in a while. So

these strategies a second time, they usually 
would not work. The machine gave the

playing with his friends on the beach, wat- 
ched his friend Craig perform the “win- 
ning trick,” but when he tried it, Merlin 
did not slip up and the game ended in a 
draw. 
Robert, confused and frustrated,threw 
Merlin into the sand and said,“Cheater. I 
hope your brains break.” He was overheard 
by Craig and Greg, aged six and eight, who 
salvaged the by-now very sandy toy and 
took it upon themselves to set Robert 
straight. “Merlin doesn’t know if it cheats,” 
says Craig. “It doesn’t know if you break it, 
Robert. It’s not alive.” Greg adds, “It’s 
smart enough to make the right kinds of 
noises. But it doesn’t really know if it loses. 
And when it cheats it don’t even know it’s 
cheating.” Jenny, six, interrupts with disdain: 
“Greg, to cheat you have to know you are 
cheating. Knowing is part of cheating.” 
In the early 1980s such scenes were not 
unusual. Confronted with objects that 
spoke,strategized and “won,” children were 
led to argue the moral and metaphysical 
status of machines on the basis 
of their psychologies: did the 
machines know what they were 
doing? Despite Jenny’s objec- 
tions that “knowing is part of 
cheating,” children did come to 
see computational objects as exhi- 
biting a kind of knowing. By doing 
so, they recast the Piagetian framework 
in which a definition of life centred around 
“moving of one’s own accord.” 
Observing children in the world of the 
“traditional ”—that is non-computional— 
objects, Piaget found that at first they consi- 
dered everything that moved to be alive. 
Then only things that moved without an 
outside push or pull. Gradually, children 
refined the notion to mean “life motions,” 
namely only those things that breathed and 
grew were taken to be alive. 
  
    
    
    
    
   
Motion gives way 
to emotion 
Children broke with this orderly cate- 
gorization by making distinctions about 
“machines that think.” Their discussions 
about the computer’s aliveness came to 
centre on what the children perceived as the 
computer’s psychological rather than phy- 
sical properties. To put it simply, motion 
gave way to emotion and physics gave way 
to psychology as criteria for aliveness. 
In the 1980s, the computational objects 
that evoked “artificial life” (the “Sim”series, 
for example, assigns the task of creating a 
functioning ecosystem or city) strained that 
order to the breaking point. Children still 
tried to impose strategies and categories, but 
they did so in the manner of theoretical 
44 The Unesco Courier - September 2000 
bricoleurs, or tinkerers, making do with 
whatever materials were at hand and with 
any theory that fit a prevailing circum- 
stance. When children confronted these 
new objects and tried to construct a theory 
about what is alive, we were able to see 
them cycling through theories of “alive- 
ness.” 
“Sort of alive” 
robots 
An eleven-year-old named Holly wat- 
ched a group of robots with “onboard” 
computational intelligence navigate a maze. 
As the robots used different strategies to 
reach their goal, Holly commented on their 
“personalities”’and “cuteness.” She finally 
came to speculate on the robots’ “alive- 
ness” and blurted out an unexpected for- 
mulation: “It’s like Pinocchio [the story of 
a puppet brought to life]. First Pinocchio 
was just a puppet. He was not alive at all. 
Then he was an alive puppet. Then he was 
an alive boy. A real boy. But he was alive 
even before he was a real boy. So I think the 
robots are like that. They are alive like 
Pinocchio but not like real boys.” She 
cleared her throat and summed up:“They 
are sort of alive.” 
Robbie, a ten-year-old who has been 
given a modem for her birthday, put the 
emphasis on mobility when she consi- 
dered whether the creatures 
she has evolved while 
creating a vir- 
tual ecosystem 
through the 
game SimULife 
were alive.“I 
think they are 
a little alive in 
the game, but 
you cannot 
save your game [when you turn it off], so that 
all the creatures you have evolved go away. But 
if they could figure out how to get rid of that 
part of the programme so that you would 
have to save the game and if your modem 
were on, then they [the creatures] could get 
out of your computer and go to America 
Online [an Internet Service Provider]. 
The resurfacing of motion (Piaget’s 
classical criterion for how a child decides 
whether a “traditional” object is alive) is 
now bound up with notions of a presumed 
psychology: children are most likely to 
assume that the creatures in Sim games 
have a desire to “get out” of the system 
and evolve in a wider computational world. 
Through the 1990s, children still spoke 
easily about factors which encouraged them 
to see the “stuff” of computers as the same 
“stuff” of which life is made. I observed a 
group of seven-year-olds playing with a set 
of plastic transformer toys that can take 
the shape of armoured tanks, robots, or 
people. The transformers can also be put 
into intermediate states so that a “robot” 
arm can protrude from a human form or a 
human leg from a mechanical tank. Two 
of the children are playing with the toys, 
mixing human and machine parts. A third 
child insists that this is not right. The toys, 
he says, should not be placed in hybrid 
states. “You should play them as all tank or 
all people.” An eight-year-old girl comforts 
the now upset third child. “It’s okay to play 
them when they are in-between.It’s all the 
same stuff,” she said, “just yucky computer 
‘cy-dough-plasm.’” 
This comment reflects a cyborg 
consciousness among today’s children: a 
tendency to see computer systems as “sort 
of” alive, to fluidly cycle through various 
explanatory concepts, and to willingly trans- 
gress boundaries. 
Feelings for 
Furby 
Most recently, the transgressions have 
involved relationships with “virtual pets” 
and digital dolls (the first and most popular 
of these were Tamagotchis and Furbies) 
which raise new questions about the boun- 
daries of what children consider as life. 
What these objects have that earlier com- 
putational objects did not is that they ask the 
child for nurturance. They ask the child to 
assess the object’s “state of mind”in order 
to develop a successful relationship with 
the object. For example, in order to grow 
and be healthy, Tamagotchis (imaginary 
creatures “housed” in small screened 
devices) need to be fed, cleaned and 
amused. Going a step further, the furry 
electronic pets called Furbies simulate lear- 
ning and loving. They are cuddly, they speak 
and play games with the child. Furbies add 
the dimensions of human-like conversa- 
tion and tender companionship to the mix 
of what children can anticipate from com- 
putational objects. In my research on chil- 
dren and Furbies, I have found that when 
children play with these new objects they 
want to know their “state,” not to get some- 
thing “right,” but to make the Furbies 
happy. Children want to understand Furby 
language, not to “win” in a game over the 
Furbies, but to have a feeling of mutual 
recognition. They do not ask how the objects 
“work,” they take the affectively charged 
toys “at interface value.” 
In my previous research on children 
and computer toys,children described the 
life-like status of machines in terms of their 
cognitive capacities (the toys could “know”

CONNEXIONS 
things, “solve” puzzles). In my more recent 
studies, children describe the new toys, 
Furbies, as “sort of alive,” which reflects 
their emotional attachments to the toys and 
their fantasies that the Furby might be emo- 
tionally attached to them. When asked whe- 
ther the Furbies are alive, children tend 
not to speak about what the toy can do and 
focus instead on their feelings for the “pet” 
and how it might feel about them. 
Emotional vulnerability 
“Well, the Furby is alive for a Furby,” 
says Ron, six. “And you know, something 
this smart should have arms. It might want 
to pick up something or hug me.” Kathe- 
rine, age five,asks: “Is it alive? Well, I love it. 
It’s more alive than a’ Tamagotchi because 
it sleeps with me. It likes to sleep with me.” 
Jen, age nine, focuses not on what the object 
offers her, but what she can do for it. “I 
really like to take care of it.So, I guess itis 
alive, but it doesn’t need to really eat, so it 
is as alive as you can be if you don’t eat. A 
Furby is like an owl. But it is more alive than 
an owl because it knows more and you can 
talk to it. But it needs batteries so it is not 
an animal. It’s not like an animal kind of 
alive.” 
Today’s children are learning to distin- 
guish between an “animal kind of alive” 
and a “Furby kind of alive.” The category of 
“sort of alive” becomes increasingly used. 
Perceived intelligence or “knowing” is ano- 
ther key distinction. 
Over the past five decades, research in 
artificial intelligence has not even come 
close to creating a machine as intelligent as 
a person. But it has succeeded in contri- 
buting to a certain deflation of our lan- 
guage in terms of how we use the word 
intelligence. It is now commonplace to talk 
about intelligent machines when we really 
are talking about machines that play chess 
or assess mortgage applications. These feats 
are wondrous, but intelligence used to mean 
a great deal more than that. We now face the 
prospect of a similar deflation of language 
in talking about affect and emotion. Chil- 
dren talk about an “animal kind of alive” 
and a “Furby kind of alive.” Will they also 
talk about a “people kind of love” and a 
“computer kind of love? 
These questions bring us to a different 
world from the old “Al [artificial intelligence] 
debates” of the 1960s to 1980s in which 
researchers argued about whether machines 
could be “really” intelligent. The old debate 
was essentialist. The new objects sidestep 
such arguments about what is inherent in 
them and play instead on what they evoke in 
us: when we are asked to care for an object, 
when this cared-for object thrives and offers 
us its attention and concern, we experience 
it as intelligent, but more important, we feel 
a connection to it. The old AI debates were 
about the technical abilities of machines. The 
new ones will be about the emotional vulne- 
rabilities of people. [|

INTERVIEW 
TIM BERNERS-LEE: 
THE WEB'S BRAINCHILD 
A staunch idealist, the British inventor of the World Wide Web is worth more than his weight 
in gold. Tim Berners-Lee has shunned opportunities in the private sector to captain an 
international consortium grouping the Web's who's who. His foremost goal: to keep on 
improving the Web for the common good. 
How do you account for the Web's formidable 
growth in the last 10 years? 
The Web initially spread because of exis- 
ting Internet infrastructure set up during the 
1970s. By the time I had the idea for the 
Web at the end of the 80s, computers in 
many universities and institutes in the 
United States and in Europe were already 
connected to each other by cables exchan- 
ging information. So you have to give credit 
to those pioneers who put together such a 
46 The Unesco Courier - September 2000 
network before the Web’s arrival. 
The Web spread fast because it was 
decentralized and no one was controlling its 
growth. The fact that anybody can start a 
server or run a browser,without having to 
register with any central authority, is what 
allowed it to grow rapidly. There were enthu- 
siasts all over the world who realized what 
the world could be with the Web and 
directed their efforts at developing it. 
Also the Web’s openness is a powerful 
  
attraction. Everyone can not only read 
what’s on the Web but can also contribute 
to it. Everybody is in a sense equal. This 
sense of boundless opportunity also led to 
its remarkable growth. 
Does the Web stand to benefit those traditionally 
on the margins of technological innovation? 
It is obvious that the present imbalance 
in society is unhealthy for the whole world. 
But do not look to innovations alone for sol-

ving global issues. It is for people to make 
decisions on how to manage themselves 
and it requires a lot of effort on all sides to 
solve various problems. We’ve had many 
tools in the past and Internet can be another 
tool in addressing those challenges. 
The basic idea of the Web is that it is an 
information space through which people 
can communicate, but communicate in a 
special way, by sharing their knowledge in 
a pool. The Web is more of a social creation 
than a technical one. It has not changed any- 
thing fundamentally in the way human 
beings think, read and communicate with 
each other. It has given people greater 
choice than ever before by simply provi- 
ding information. Advantages of the Web 
range from enhanced collaboration bet- 
ween people in different countries to reading 
a newspaper sitting in a remote village. 
Though the Web has given us many 
choices, we still don’t know how to use 
those choices to our advantage. I hope the 
fact that each individual has more choice 
now will give us greater power to reformu- 
late our society. 
In your book Weaving the Web, you talk 
about the danger of the Web being controlled 
by a select group of companies or commercial 
deeds blocking its growth. What would the 
consequences be? 
The danger is when large companies 
that sell computers and software effectively 
start to control what information you receive 
on the Internet. Companies which offer free 
computers or Web browsers could prevent a 
user from utilizing or accessing programmes 
of their commercial competitors. Even 
Internet Service Providers (ISPs) can have 
commercial deals with certain Web sites, 
making them easier to access than other 
sites. This is already starting to happen. 
On the one hand, people feel it’s reaso- 
nable for a company to influence your 
Internet access if they provide you with 
free computers and software programmes. 
But on the other, it’s really important that 
the right of the individual to access unbiased 
information be upheld. The point is that one 
should not masquerade the other. 
I’m not sure to what extent people rea- 
lize or can measure whether their attempts 
to access different websites are being 
affected by commercial concerns. It’s also 
very difficult to find a balance between the 
right of a company to offer a service which 
is subsidized and the right of somebody to 
have unbiased access. We have yet to find a 
good social arrangement 
Another danger is that if a company 
establishes a monopoly, it will start making 
arbitrary changes to universally accepted 
Web standards. This would force competi- 
tors to concentrate their efforts on mat- 
ching these rather than coming out with 
new, bright ideas to improve the product. 
This would affect the Web’s overall deve- 
lopment. 
The Web has allowed a much greater flow of 
information which some countries are seeking 
to regulate and control. How do you react to 
this? 
_ 
INTERVIEW 
I know that some countries are contem- 
plating or attempting to control informa- 
tion available to individuals on the Internet. 
My feeling is that it is very difficult to 
achieve because the Internet allows infor- 
mation to flow in many different ways. You 
are only a small hole in this vast system. In 
a way, controlling or regulating information 
is bad for the relationship between a 
government and the people and, in the 
long term,for the stability of the country. 
There have also been calls for wides- 
pread censorship on the net. But in most of 
the Western world, censorship is a deroga- 
tory term for one body trying to control 
what information another body has access 
to. However, there is a growing recogni- 
tion that parents have the right and the 
duty to protect their children from viewing 
undesirable sites. This led ourWeb Consor- 
tium to develop systems like the Platform 
for Internet Content Selection (PICS) that 
enables adults to control children’s access 
to different websites. 
The large number of filtering software 
tools on the market are more effective than 
government censorship. A nation’s laws can 
restrict content only in that country but 
filters can block content no matter where it 
comes from on the Web. Fundamentally, it 
is for the people to determine the type of 
social mechanisms and regulations that will 
benefit society. 
There have been rising concerns over surfers’ 
privacy. How is this being tackled?

n a field churning out dot.com millionaires 
I. other week, Tim Berners-Lee stands in a 
league apart. The London-born and raised 
Berners-Lee could easily have become one of the 
world’s wealthiest men by commercializing his 
invention. Instead, he chose to focus his efforts 
on improving and universalizing the Web. 
A physics graduate from Oxford University, 
Berners-Lee started working for the Geneva- 
based CERN (European Particle Physics 
Laboratory) in 1980 where he wrote a 
programme called Enquire that could store and 
recall information based on random associations. 
That set the tone for the future development 
of the World Wide Web, which he invented in 
late 1990. 
Berners-Lee wrote the HTML (HyperText 
Markup Language) establishing links with other 
documents in a computer and designed an 
addressing scheme that gave each web page a 
 
  
unique location, or URL (Universal Resource 
Locator). Then he developed a set of rules called 
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) for 
transferring information across the Net. In 1991, 
he made the programmes freely available for 
Internet users across the globe. For the next two 
years, he continued working on improving the 
design of the Web with feedback from Internet 
users. 
After leaving CERN in 1994, Berners-Lee 
headed for the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology's (MIT) Laboratory for Computer 
Sciences in Boston, where he is director of the 
World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). The 
organization, which is comprised by more than 
300 members from the global industry including 
giants like Microsoft and IBM, sets technical 
standards for the Web. 
Hailed by Time magazine as one of the 100 
greatest minds of the 20th century, the 45-year- 
old Berners-Lee remains a paragon of modesty 
despite the astonishing growth and success of his 
invention. Sitting in his office at the W3C, he 
asserts that the Web is just in its infancy. “The 
ultimate goal is to support and improve our web- 
like existence in the world,” he says, explaining 
that the Web offers an unprecedented means to 
achieve greater freedom and social growth. “We 
are a still a long way from realizing its full 
potential.” [|

Surfing the Web in a Dakar slum i s a rare luxury on the African continent, where only 3.5 inhabitants out of 1,000 have access to the Internet, compared with 14.1 
in Asia, 88 in Europe, 160.3 in the Americas and 224.5 in Oceania, according to the International Telecommunications Union. 
person to dictate what can and cannot be 
done with his or her own personal infor- 
mation. For consumers using the Internet, 
the greatest privacy concern is that after 
they’ve ordered a number of products, com- 
panies will have accumulated enough per- 
sonal information to harm or take advantage 
of them.With consequences ranging from 
junk mail to the denial of health insurance, 
the problem is serious. 
Users should be aware of how various 
websites use their personal information.In 
a way, privacy concerns are a leading impe- 
diment to the further growth of Web-based 
commerce, but I think sites should highlight 
the need for consumer privacy. With these 
concerns in mind, our Consortium has 
developed a new tool called P3P (Platform 
for Privacy Preferences Project). It would 
automatically communicate to users a web- 
site’s stated privacy policy and compare it 
with the user’s own pre-set policy prefe- 
rences. If aWeb site’s privacy policy does not 
suit the user’s interests,they can stop then 
and there. 
A responsible website should have a pri- 
vacy policy at the bottom of the home page. 
Failing that, I believe there ought to be a 
legally enforced default policy that offers 
individuals the highest protection. The issue 
of privacy has been addressed to a certain 
48 The Unesco Courier - September 2000 
extent in Europe where companies have to 
keep secure the information they hold on 
customers, and are barred from combining 
databases in ways that are legal in the 
United States. Many people in the U.S.are 
starting to realize the need for more regu- 
lation of privacy and the need for greater 
protection of the individual and society. 
There has been a spurt of Internet-related 
patents in recent years. What effect are these 
having on the Web's development? 
The awarding of Internet-related patents 
poses a danger to the Web’s universality 
and can kill good ideas. There was a widely 
held assumption in the Web’s first five years 
that a common good was to be gained from 
putting together a far-reaching infrastruc- 
ture. Now a huge amount of business is 
being done on the Web. The ability to 
control any part of it through patent claims 
will be very lucrative. In some cases busi- 
nesses may be able to gain money simply by 
threatening to take legal action. This has a 
dampening effect on people working toge- 
ther to create a universal Web. 
For example, people in the WWW pro- 
fession meet often to discuss technological 
improvements and innovations, from 
improved graphic or video conferencing 
systems to ways of wiring the developing 
world. These projects have the potential to 
benefit many people but are sometimes sud- 
denly abandoned because of fears or 
rumours of legal action from a company 
having patent claims to that technology. 
Currently, in the U.S. (unlike in many other 
countries), it is possible to patent part of 
the way a programme does something. 
Some of the recent Internet-related 
patent awards have been derided by the 
Web community. They are effectively res- 
tricting the use of technologies that could 
expand the use and universality of the 
Internet. I hope that very soon patents will 
only be considered valid if they represent a 
real novelty or a really bright idea. I have yet 
to see a patent like this in the field. 
There is no way to judge the authenticity or 
reliability of information on the Web, making 
users highly vulnerable. Is this likely to 
change? 
We are not using all the technology avai- 
lable to verify the authenticity of a website 
or a person you come across. More 
advanced tools will soon be introduced. 
With the help of new browsers and by using 
digital signatures, you will soon be able to 
actually ensure that the document or the 
website you are referring to was in fact 
generated by its claimed author. With regard

to electronic messages, new and secure 
communication protocols allow us to make 
sure that nobody can sneak in and alter a 
message along its way. 
Now the question is how do you know 
whether a particular document or person 
you come across while surfing on the net is 
reliable. You just can’t do that. There is no 
infrastructure set up at the moment by 
which you can actually check the reliability 
of a person or of a site you are visiting. Why 
should you believe in somebody about 
whom you have never heard of? I think 
people will have to learn whom they can 
trust on the Web. 
Take a book for example. You read it 
because it was referred to you by reliable 
sources. In the same way somebody you 
know may point to a web site. Trust is always 
transferred from one individual to another. 
We have to set up a “Web of trust.” 
Some people initially thought of the 
Web as an anonymous space separated from 
reality in which there was no individual 
responsibility. This is not the case.Anyone 
who sends a fraudulent message is sitting 
somewhere and is naturally subjected to 
local laws. If someone makes forged tran- 
sactions, the fact that they did it electroni- 
cally doesn’t in anyway absolve them of 
their responsibility under the law. 
Thanks to the Web, the world has become a 
global village. But we have recently witnessed 
a rising incidence of hackers paralyzing public 
utility systems with viruses. Can systems 
become more resilient? 
While the Internet is a decentralized 
system, I think the principle danger it faces 
now is the lack of diversity in the tools we

No, it wasn’t a love message... Only greater product diversity will build up resistance to virus attacks, says Lee.

use to access it. If you analyze the recent 
virus attacks, you’ll find it’s computers run- 
ning the same software produced by the 
same company that are usually coming 
under attack by hackers. While it’s advan- 
tageous to have many people running the 
same software, there is a need for alterna- 
tive types of products in order to build up 
resistance to virus attacks. 
There have been proposals that Internet users 
in developed countries be taxed in order to 
wire the rest of the world? 
I do think that the developed world 
owes a great debt to the developing one 
and Internet access adds one line to that 
debt. However, it is not obvious whether 
taxing all Internet users in general is a smart 
idea. It has to be done on a selective basis. 
I feel that those who can afford large 
amounts of Internet access—those for ins- 
tance who are in position to get videos-on- 
demand or use the Web extensively for com- 
mercial purposes—can be taxed. 
One could also argue that introducing a 
tax might discourage some countries from 
investing in the Internet, which is developing 
so rapidly right now. The only place where 
you could give serious thought to a tax is the 
U.S., and perhaps Finland. Other deve- 
loped countries, which are trying to catch up 
with the U.S., may be a bit reluctant to »

INTERVIEW 
introduce taxation. 
It is still difficult to get an Internet connection 
in the South because of the lack of telephone 
lines. Are there solutions to this? 
Telecommunications departments in 
many developing countries are still bureau- 
cratic and would never agree to sharing 
anything with anybody or to allow any com- 
petition that would improve access. One 
option is to rethink the technology altoge- 
ther. We should start off by expanding the 
use of wireless technologies for basic com- 
munications in rural areas. Once networks 
have been built up, walkie-talkies could 
eventually be merged with the Internet 
without any input from telecommunica- 
tion ministries. The system would be a 
decentralized one in which there would be 
no need to apply for an Internet address or 
a domain name. Research is already going 
on in this field and I strongly feel that com- 
mercial production of this technology 
should start soon to expand Internet access 
in Southern countries. 
However, it may be difficult for this 
technology to be deployed in some countries 
because it would threaten the existing 
monopoly of telecommunication compa- 
nies or government control over commu- 
nications. The United Nations could play a 
role in spreading the idea among its member 
States as this technology offers very exciting 
possibilities. 
I also think subsidies should be put 
towards translating information on the 
Internet into different languages. It is 
important that the Web support local 
cultures and not just broadcast American 
culture. Even in European countries, it 
was difficult for the Web to get started 
because you didn’t have a huge monocul- 
ture or monolingual audience waiting eve- 
rywhere. Getting over this barrier in coun- 
tries with smaller linguistic audiences will 
be very difficult. 
Could you elaborate on the “Semantic Web” 
you are working on at the moment? 
My dream for the Web has two parts. In 
the first, I see the Web becoming a much 
more powerful means for collaboration 
among people. In the second, collabora- 
tions extend to computers. Machines 
become capable of analyzing all the data on 
the Web — the contents, links and transac- 
tions between people and computers. 
The Semantic Web would be able to 
take information from different databases on 
the Web, from catalogues and weather sites 
to stock price information, and to allow 
this data to be processed by computers. At 
the moment, this cannot be done because 
the data available on the Web is not in a form 
that can be understood or converted by 
computers for direct analysis. This is 
because the Web pages are designed only for 
human readership. 
The Semantic Web would also answer 
many people’s prayers for a logical search 
engine that gives you solid results. Right 
now, search engines come up with thou- 
sands of Web pages in response to a request. 
It is impossible to search what’s in all those 
pages. With the Semantic Web, the search 
engine would go out and say “Well,here is 
an object which I can mathematically prove 
to you matches the criteria requested.” In 
 
THE NET 
AND THE WEB 
s Berners-Lee puts it, the Web could 
A. exist without the Net. First developed 
for military purposes by the U.S. Department 
of Defence in the 1960s, the Internet is 
a network of networks. It refers to millions 
of computers around the world connected 
to each other by telephone wire, cable and 
satellite. The Web, a part of the Internet, 
is a worldwide collection of text and 
multimedia files linked to each other via a 
system of hypertext documents. The Hypertext 
Transfer Protocol (HTTP) was created by 
Berners-Lee in 1990 at CERN, the European 
Particle Physics Laboratory, as a means of 
sharing scientific data internationally, instantly 
and inexpensively. With hypertext, a word or 
phrase can contain a link to another text. 
To achieve this, Berners-Lee developed a 
programming language called HTML, 
which allows users to easily link to other 
pages or network services on the Web. [ 
 
    
short, search engines will become more 
meaningful and effective. Once the two- 
part dream is achieved, the Web will be a 
place where the whim of a human being and 
the reasoning of a machine will co-exist in 
an ideal, powerful mixture. [|
