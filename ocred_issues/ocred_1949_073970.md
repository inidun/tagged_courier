UNESCO COURIER May 1949 
 
 
Geography 
For World 
Understanding 
THE teaching of geography 
as a means of develop- 
ing international understand- 
ing will be one of the main 
subjects for discussion at the 
12th International Conference 
on Public Education, organiz- 
ed jointly by Unesce and the 
- International Bureau of Edu- 
cation (I.B.E.), opening in Ge- 
neva, Switzerland, on July 4. 
From these discussions it is 
hoped to show how geography 
teaching can play its part in 
education for world under- 
standing by helping to break 
down the spirit of isolationism 
and to remove false ideas 
about other peoples and cul- 
tures. 
As part of its educational 
programme for 1949 and 1950, 
Unesco is preparing a pam- 
phlet of suggestions on how 
geography teaching can be 
used to develop this one- 
worid outlook in children, and 
in 1950 a Unesco Seminar will 
be devoted to geography 
teaching. 
Unesco and the LB.E. felt 
that the Geneva Conference 
would provide an excellent 
opportunity for a preliminary 
exchange of views on this 
subject. After the Conference, 
the Unesco pamphlet will be 
completed in the light of the 
comments made, and distri- 
buted to the participants in 
the 1950 Seminar, 
Another subject for discus- 
sion at the Conference is how 
primary school children are 
being taught natural science. 
This will be based on the 
results of an inquiry covering 
47 countries, recently carried 
out by the LB.E. 
Information from a similar 
LB.E. inquiry into the teaching 
of reading will also be studied, 
so as to bring into perspective 
its present status as a school 
activity. 
The Conference will recom- 
mend ways of improving pre- 
sent-day reading lesson tech- 
nique for children and for 
illiterate adults. 
Reports on national educa- . 
tional developments during 
1948 will be made to the Con- 
ference and will later be 
published in the 1949 Inter- 
national Yearbook of Educa- 
tion.   
     
        
     
  
    
    
    
       
    
    
       
 
Torres Bodet Reaff 
Action of 
ITTLE more than forty- 
[| eight hours after his talk 
with President Truman in 
Washington, which terminated 
his successful visit to the United 
States last month, Dr. Tor- 
res Bodet. Director-General of 
Unesco, stepped off a trans- 
Atlantic ‘plane in London for a 
three-day stay in Great Britain. 
Between the late afternoon of 
Friday, April 8, and Tuesday, 
April 12 when he boarded an- 
other ’plane to take him back to 
Paris, Dr. Torres Bodet conferred 
with the Prime Minister, Mr. 
Attlee, and with educational lead- 
ers in Oxford and Cambridge, 
and addressed the first 1949 meet- 
ing of the United Kingdom Na- 
tional Commission. 
On April 11, addressing 300 de- 
legates to the meeting of the 
National Commission, Dr. Torres 
Bodet recalled the days of the 
founding of Unesco in 1643. 
Unesco, he said, “has nui yet 
become the powerful organiza- 
tion of whose world-wide influ- 
ence some of us dreamed... How- 
ever, the essential thing is that 
the structure of Unesco does 
exist.” 
He paid tribute to the Unesco's 
first Director-General, Dr. Julian 
Huxley and declared that the 
Organization “is equally grateful 
both for the counsels and for 
. the criticisms” it has received 
from Great Britain in what 
he termed Unesco’s “apprentice 
years”, 
Intense Intellectual 
Ambition 
JT would be a bad sign if 
we expected nothing but 
praise”, he continued, “when we 
ourselves are far from being 
satisfied with our work. We have 
undertaken a tremendous pro- 
gramme. And our resources for 
carrying it out are so slender, 
If there is a fault to be found 
with Unesco, it is, after all, a 
very creditable fault: that of an 
intense intellectual ambition.” 
Dr. Torres Bodet went on to 
say that it had first been neces- 
sary to map out the domain 
which, sooner or later, should be 
" Unesco's field of action. Hence 
the vastness of the programme 
drawn up at the Mexico City 
Conference and confirmed, in its 
main lines, by the Beirut Confer- 
ence. 
“Our task now”, he said, “is 
not to retreat from the ambi- 
tious scale of the originai pro- 
gramme but modestly to single 
out from the wide field of pro- 
jects the omnes which seem to us 
to be of the greatest importance

TASK such as that entrusted 
to Unesco did not yield its 
fruits in a short time. Not a few 
centuries were needed to allow 
even the idea of intellectual co- 
operation to prevail, in the minds 
of the elite, over the lust of spiri- 
tual domination. Where nations 
had needed centuries, how could 
one expect an inter-government- 
al institution to achieve, in the 
space of months, decisive and 
numerous successes. 
“Therefore”, Dr. Torres Bodet 
went on, “in the work of deter- 
mining which part of our pro- 
gramme was to be carried out 
within a particular time, we 
were guided by one overriding 
consideration: our prudence was 
not to imply any renunciation, 
res Bodet, “people ask me, why 
is Unesco not in touch with this 
or that group of intellectual lead- 
ers, thinkers, artists and poets? 
Does its governmental status 
blind it to the importance of the 
private associations? You have 
told us yourself that the object- 
ive of Unesco is the good of man, 
Why, then, is there such a gulf 
between the average man and 
your Organization? 
“I am bound to admit that 
questions like that disturb me 
profoundly. I feel that there is 
still an enormous gap between 
the activities of Unesco and the 
needs, hopes and fears of that 
average man, that man in the 
street, of whose destiny we who 
work in Unesco must always be 
thinking. On the other hand, I 
ask in my turn: is it not for the 
 
300 delegates to the U.K. National Commission heard Dr. Torres Bodet 
in London last month state: “Help us to make sure Unesco does not 
become stiff in the joints...” Above, members of UK. delegation. 
and we were to give no one— 
least of all ourselves—the impres- 
ion that questions deferred were 
questions abandoned. By this I 
mean that our criterion in mak- 
ing a choice will not be ease of 
execution. And between a spec- 
tacular project with no future 
and a simple, unimposing project 
likely to have useful results, we 
shall not hesitate. We shall 
choose the second. 
“Following this line of action, 
my first care as Director-General 
of Unesco was to submit to the 
Executive Board a list of prior- 
ities, which the Board approved. 
Three Considerations 
¢JT would indeed be a mistake 
to abandon the vastness of 
our programme; but it would 
have been an even greater mis- 
take not to realize that the best 
programmes are those that can 
be carried out. The peoples 
"expect from our Organization 
more than a string of promises, 
however fine. In deciding on the 
priorities... we took into account... 
three considerations: first, which 
projects are likely to be of the 
greatest and most far-reaching 
benefit to the great masses? Sec- 
ond, which project can best help 
the ‘leaders’ in their task of 
serving the masses? And, finally, 
which projects have already 
reached such a stage in Unesco’'s 
work that to interrupt them 
would be tantamount to a costly 
failure and would be thought an 
incomprehensible lack of admin- 
istrative continuity?” 
‘Wherever I go”, said Dr. Tor- 
- National Commissions in each 
country to help us fill that im- 
mense gap? 
Reserves and the Vanguard 
JF ACH time that I address 
an institution like yours”, 
said Dr. Torres Bodet, “I put to 
its members the same request: 
Help us to make sure that 
Unesco does not become stiff in 
the joints before it has grown up. 
In the battle we have to wage 
against ignorance and incompre- 
hension, you must be our reser- 
ves and vet, in a sense, you must 
be our vanguard, too.. 
“You have done much for 
Unesco. And Unesco expects 
much of you, particularly if we 
consider the obstacles that stand 
in our way. : 
“They are of all kinds. First, 
political obstacles. Unesco wants. 
of course, to be above politics. 
irms Streamlined 
there, with their conflicting 
interests and passions; and 
through them Unesco is often 
reduced to playing the part of a 
silent witness. Then, material 
obstacles. Whilst culture requires 
increasing numbers of ex- 
changes and efficient communi- 
cations, economic problems are 
erecting barriers between States, 
allowing books to get no further 
than the frontiers, stopping 
travel] for research workers and 
holding up the transport of 
research equipment, and fixing 
quotas for ideas as well as for 
goods. Lastly, moral obstacles. 
These are the most serious, for 
they now arouse neither aston- 
ishment nor indignation. The 
people have suffered too long 
from spoken and written lies. 
How can one now ask them to be 
suddenly enthusiastic over ideas 
according to which they must 
redouble their efforts to bring 
about, at some distant date. a 
state of reasonable and just secu- 
rity? 
“If these new demands are fo 
be made upon them”, said 
Dr. Torres Bodet, “Unesco must 
prove that it is not an abstrac- 
tion, a platform for speeches, an 
international trade mark for 
mass-produced projects. 
“But is Unesco alone to pro- 
vide that proof?” he asked. 
Unesco knew that, by itself, it 
could neither produce mor con- 
sume anything. Everything that 
it gave it had first to receive. 
Its activity would be absurd if 
it were ever unfortunate enough 
to be cut off from its living 
springs, that is, from the various 
spiritual resources of its Member 
States contributing to the pro- 
motion of friendship between 
nations and sympathy between 
cultures. “You, gentlemen”, he 
went on, “are yourselves part of 
Unesco. Without you and without 
the Universities, writers, profes~ 
sors and scientists of the forty- 
six countries now taking part in 
its work, there would be no rea- 
son for Unesco, and Unesco 
would not exist.” 
  But politics are indisputably

### 73976: Summer camp for war orphans to open in France

May 1949 - UNESCO COURIER 
VER 2,000 teachers and professors 
from schocis and universities in 
England and Wales gave a great 
welcome to Dr. Jaime Torres Bodet, 
Director-General of Unesco, when he 
addressed the annual conference of the 
National Union of Teachers at Margate 
on April 18th. 
Delegates from seven other countries, 
including the United States, the Soviet 
Union and Poland, joined in the applause 
when Dr. Torres Bodet was introduced as 
“The first world citizen: from the teacher's 
point of view”. 
Speaking in English, Dr. Torres Bodet 
said that his presence at the Conference 
represented a unique synthesis of Unesco’s 
history and its aims:. its history, because 
Unesco was born in Britain, at a Con- 
ference in London in the au‘umn of 1945; 
its aims, because they as teachers held 
the key to Unesco’s fundamental objective 
—that through education the peoples 
should come to understand each other and 
be enabled to build for themselves a 
better and a peaceful world. 
Our Hope for Future Peace 
“IF there is anv profession which, by its 
very nature, carries an obligation to 
implant Unesco’s ideals in the minds of 
the young, it is the teaching profession”, 
he stated. 
“In education”, he continued, ‘lies our 
hope for future peace and progress.” This 
was recognized by the General Assembly 
of the United Nations in Article 26 of the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
adopted last December. The Article 
declares: ‘Everyone has the right to edu- 
cation’—without distinction of any kind. 
“In some countr.es such a statement 
appears self evident. But it is a Right 
that is far from being realized. In fact, 
today, more than half of mankind is 
illiterate. There are many countries where 
the proportion of :lliterates is over 60 % 
and in Africa and Asia the figure is 
often as high as 90 %. 
“Article 26 continues: 
be free, at least in so far as elementary 
and fundamental education are concerned. 
Elementary education shall be compul- 
A ‘Backward’ World 
[414 R you, in this country, these condi- 
tions will appear as self-evident as 
the Right to Education itself. They have

of your own profession and of your own 
Un.on. You could not admit that the

benefits of education should not be en- 
joyed by all the children of Britain. 
“As citizens of the world we cannot— 
you cannot—admit that half of its child- 
ren should continue to have no books, no 
schools, no teachers—mo education, be- 
cause they happen to have been born in 
so-called ‘backward’ countries. 
“So long as these conditions exist we 
are all citizens of a backward world. 
“But it will not be enough to achieve 
elementary education for all, momentous 
as that would be. As you well know, 
society has not discharged its duties 
towards the children when it has taught 
them reading, writing and arithmetic. 
These children who must build the future 
—a better and more peaceful world than 
our own—can only do, so if they are - 
enabled to develop their gifts and abilities 
to the full 
-“The Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights puts it this way: ‘Everyone has 
the right freely to particinate in the cul- 
tural life of the community, to enjoy the 
arts and to share in scientific advance- 
ment and its benefits”. 
  
History and Nationalism | 
CONE of us dare acquiesce in the - 
injustice—indeed, the danger— of 
reserving culture for the few, while dis- 
tributing sparingly to the majority the 
rudiments of a purely utilitarian training, 
“But our objective goes even beyond 
that. We must give all children the op- 
portunity of becoming truly educated men 
and women. We must also help them to 
become good citizens, not only of their 
own country but of the world. To that 
end, it is essential that they should be 
taught history in a way that will help 
them to guard against prejudice and 
narrow concevtions of nationalism. Too 
often the schools to-day fail to offer the 
child the opportunity to learn the history 
of ‘peoples other than their own. Too 
many children leave school totally ignor- 
ant of the ways in which civilization has 
been fashioned, and is still being fashion- 
ed, by the achievements of many peoples 
and many cultures. 
“How can the child who is brought up

: on the storles of his own national heroes 
only and their achievements, fail to fail 
prey, as an adult, to such mischievous 
ideas as the ‘hereditary foe’, the ‘foreign. 
. er’, the ‘inferior race’? 
- “It is clear that even with the pest of 
schools and the best of teachers, education 
for citizenship must be reinforced by the - 
example of the family, the city and the 
country. Ethics could not be taught by 
slogans or aphorisms: they must be 
butiressed by the lessons of life. 
“The Future Cannot Be Evaded’ 
¢JT may be said”, he continued, “that 
we have not chosen the best time for 
the tasks we have set ourselves. We live 
in a world of moral and political tensions, 
threatened by a dangerous recrudescence 
of aggressive or defensive nationalisms. 
Yet no man chooses his fate; as a great 
South American educator put it, the fu- 
ture cannof be evaded.” 
Dr. Torres Bodet said that the tensions 
of our times aggravated the task and 
increased our responsibility. He did not 
suggest that teachers alone could carry 
on their shoulders the entire moral burden 
of the times, although some people wouid 
like them to do so, thinking no doubt that 
they would then be relieved of any fur- 
ther responsibility themselves. 
“Unesco”, he added, “is in somewhat the 
same position.” 
While there were those who argued that 
the political issues of our times were such 
as to render Unesco an amiable but futile 
adjunct to the United Nations, there were 
also those who felt that in bringing the 
Organization into being they discharged 
_ their full responsibility. 
~ Since the Organization was created 
three years ago, 46 countries had joined 
and had given it for this year a budget of 
less than two million pounds. These were 
the funds of which Unesco itself disposed 
in the war against ignorance. If these 
were its sole resources, if the staff at 
Unesco House were the only soldiers in 
its army, then indeed the battle would be 
hopeless.” 


### 73973: Four zones of Germany to profit from UNESCO-created book centre

KF our Zones of Germany To Profit 
From Unesco-Created Book Centre 
Book Exchange Centre in Germany, 
which will enable libraries in the 
four occupation zones to inter- 
change publications with countries all . 
over the world, was officially established 
on May 1, on the initiative of Unesco. 
Arrangements for the creation of a sim- 
ilar centre in Japan were also complet- 
ed last month in Tokyo. 
Located in Bad Godesberg, in the West- 
ern zone, the newly-created German Book 
Exchange Centre (Tauschstelle), will be 
financed by the Notgemeinschaft der 
deutschen Wissenschaft (Emergency Coun- 
cil for the Promotion of German Science) 
and a possible grant-in-aid from the 
Rockefeller Foundation. 
Plans to create the German Centre 
were drawn up at a meeting convened by 
Unesco at Bad Godesberg on April 12, 
which was attended by librarians from 
almost every university library in Western 
Germany. In addition, a representative 
from a Book Exchange Centre in fhe 
Russian sector of Berlin also attended 
the meeting and agreed to assure close 
co-operation between the new Tausch- 
stelle and the Berlin Exchange Centre. 
Thus, between them, the two Centres 
will cover the four zones of Germany. 
The Bad Godesberg Centre will work 
directly with Unesco in arranging the ex- 
change of publications between Germany 
and Unesco Member States, In particular, 
it will supply information on German 
institutions seeking publication exchanges 
in any given subject and will dispose of 
complete lists of German publications for 
exchange. 
Unesco will shortly distribute the first 
lists of such German institutions to the 
appropriate agencies in other countries. 
In many instances, the newly-establish- 
ed Tauschstelle can already furnish rel- 
evant information on exchanges. En- 
quiries concerning such exchanges with 
Germany should be addressed to:

| Japan, the National Diet Library in 
Tokye has been designated to act as 
co-ordination centre for publications ex- 
change, and has already supplied Unesco 
with lists of learned societies, scientific 
institutions, universities, public libraries, 
agricultural experimental stations and of 
Unesco clubs in Japan, all of which desire 
to enter into international exchange 
agreements, 
These lists which comprise nearly 800 
institutions, will be circulated by Unesco 
in all parts of the world, and will be 
followed by lists of Japanese publications 
available for exchange. 
Those interested in establishing ex- 
change arrangements with Japan, or wish- 
ing to obtain bibliographical information 
frem that country, are advised to com- 
maunicate with the National Diet Library 
(attention of Mr. T. Kanamori, Chief 
Librarian), Akasaka, Tokyo. 
The two new Centres have been creat- 
ed as an important part of Unesco’'s edu- 
cational, scientific and cultural pro- 
gramme for Germany and Japan and 
bring to 5 the number of National Ex- 
change Centres created in direct response 
to Unesco efforts. The other 3 are locat- 
ed in Canada, the United Kingdom and 
the Unifed States.

R. TORRES BODET continued: “But

### 73974: New literacy drives launched in America

New Literacy Drives 
Launched in Americas 
A printed page is still the 
deepest possible mystery to more 
than half the people of the world. 
Today literacy campaigns are 
cutting down this figure. 
Within the past twenty-five years, 
no less than two hundred and 
fifty million adults have been 
taught to read and write, but it is 
estimated that there are still one 
~ thousand two hundred million 
illiterates in the world today. Most 
of them live in Asia, Africa and 
Latin America, where recent 
efforts of national governments 
and international organizations 
have begun to show encouraging 
results. 
Extensive campaigns against 
illiteracy are being waged in 
Brazil, Haiti, Mexico and other 
Latin American countries. In 
India, the Bombay City Adult 
Educafion Committee alone has 
taught one hundred and forty 
thousand adults to read and write 
in nine years. Rumania has 
planned to wipe out illiteracy by 
1951 and Italy has hired an extra 
ten thousand teachers for the same 
purpose. The struggle against 
illiteracy is world-wide. 
In order to make the best possible 
teaching methods available to all 
countries, Unesco and the Pan-Amer- 
ican-Union are sponsoring a six- 
week seminar for Latin-American 
educaiors in Brazil scheduled to 
open on July 27. A similar session 
for the Far East is to take place 
at Delhi, India later this year. 
THE Brazilian Government has 
allocated the sum of $50,000 
for the Seminar which about 120 
delegates from at least 25 coun- 
tries are expected to attend. The 
city of Niteroi, Capital of the State 
of Rio de Janeiro, has been selected 
as the site of the meeting and all 
delegates and Unesco Secretariat 
members will be the guests of the 
Brazilian Government, 
The Seminar will examine the 
causes of illiteracy in the Americas, 
the objectives and preparation of 
literacy campaigns, methods and 
materials best suited for teaching 
illiterates, and how to follow up 
the results of such campaigns and 
integrate them with Adult Educa-       tion and other programmes.

### 73975: Paris educators' conference stresses world point of view

Paris Educators’ Conference 
Stresses World Point of View 
modern type of school, dedicated 
to the teaching of world under- 
standing, has been growing in in- 
fluence in widely separated parts of the 
world during recent years. These “inter- 
national schools”, such as the Interna- 
tional School of Geneva, with students 
and teachers from many lands, have been 
educating boys and girls for citizenship 
not only of their own country but of the 
world community. 
Last month, the principals of 14 of 
these schools in eight countries met at 
Unesco House to talk over their exper- 
jences and work out plans for closer co- 
operation in the future. The conference 
was the first of its kind ever to be con- 
vend. 
Amcng the subjects discussed were ways 
of training teachers for work in interna- 
tional schools, practical means of stu- 
dent and teacher exchange, and a plan 
submitted by one of the delegates, 
for the creation of a group of schools 
situated in different countries, but united 
as one world-wide institution. 
Teachers’ Training Course 
HE greatest difficulty facing “pioneer” 
schools which stress international 
education in their curricula, the con- 
ference agreed, was to recruit teachers 
with a real international spirit. To meet 
this lack of trained teachers, the con- 
ference decided to organize a 6 to 8 
weeks’ course, in the summer of 1950, 
which will provide teachers and pro- 
spective teachers with an introduction to 
international schools and seek to develop 
the international outlook in the teachers. 
The schools represented at the con- 
ference also agreed to provide a “follow- 
up” veriod of practical experience for as 
many as possible of those who attend 
the study course. These teachers will be 
attached to existing schools as observers 
and may also be called on to assist in 
the work, i . Co Led r re 4 Poe »ieels Tel at NE 4 C3 SE LE TPL EE D-NE N Lo Lv

International Diploma “© : 
THE school directors agreed to experi- 
ment with the award of an inter- 
national diploma to their pupils in 1950, 
the minimum requirement for which 
would be a satisfactory knowledge of a 
second language and the completion of 
a thesis on a subject of international 
interest. This would serve as one means 
of encouraging an international outlook. 
After discussing the possibilities of 
instituting an international diploma 
which would be valid for college or univ- 
ersity entrance in any country, the con- 
ference felt that the practical difficulties 
involved in such an award were too great 
for it to be envisaged at the present time. 
Schools Around the Globe 
A CCORDING to a plan, submitted by" 
one of the delegates, the new 
world educational institution would be 
based on the ideas and the interna- 
tional outlook of the Werkplaats Inter- 
national Children’s Community at Bilt- 
hoven, Holland, Mr. Kees Boeke, prin- 
cipal of the Bilthoven school, explain- 
ed the two salient features of the school: 
teaching was along modern lines follow- 
ing, as far as possible, the interest and 
needs of the children themselves, and 
decisions were taken only with the un- 
animous approval of teachers and pupils. 
He pointed out that the entire “chain” 
of proposed new schools would work 
along the same lines so that students 
could easily move from one country to 
‘the other without any loss of time in 
their studies. 
Learning Ways of Other Peoples 
THUS an American boy, for example, 
could study for a time in Holland or 
in England in an English speaking school. 
During that time he would study French 
to prepare himself for a year or 
two in a French speaking school in 
Belgium, France or Switzerland. There 
he would continue his studies in the 
various subjects and in the meantime, 
perhaps, concentrate on Spanish to en-. 
able him to finish his secondary school 
training in South America. 
All the time he would be in touch with 
boys and girls of different nationalities, 
would make friends with them and 
deepen his understanding and apprecia- 
tion of the ways and customs of differ- 
ent peoples of the world, 
The conference recommended that the 
methods suggested by Mr. Boeke be 
studied at a future meeting to be held 
at the Bilthoven school itself. 
From the reports submitted by each 
of the school directors and educators, 
much valuable information was exchang- 
ed and the participants unanimously re- 
quested Unesco to call a similar meeting 
every year. 
  
Summer Camp 
For War Orphans 
To Open __ 
| =2" In France 
AY International Camp of War Or- 
phans will be organized this summer 
by the International Federation of Child- 
ren’s Communities. The Federation, set 
up with the aid of Unesco, has chosen 
the Moulin-Vieux “Republic”, a children's 
community near Grenoble, in France, as 
the camp site. 
With the aid of Unesco, governmental 
organizations and private individuals, the 
Federation is planning in August to group 
about 50 war orphans, aged 12 to 15, 
from children’s communities in 17 coun- 
tries. 
Situated in a beautiful Alpine valley, 
the camp will give the children valuable 
experience in international living, as well 
as benefitling their physical health and 
education. 
The programme will include physical 
culture, excursions in the region, and 
study of the folklore of various nations. 
The camp project, which was thought 
out by the children of Moulin-Vieux, will 
cost about 2,500,000 French francs and 
the Federation is therefore appealing 
for help to make it a success. 
Cash contributions may be sent wo

Orléans, one of France's oldest cities, joined hands 
with Wichita, Kansas, modern aircraft and farming 
centre, in a programme of international friendship which 
the Kansas State Commission for Unesco is encouraging 
between Kansas communities and those of other countries. 
The project was formally launched on May 7-8, when 
Orléans and Wichita simultaneously celebrated the 520th 
anniversary of the liberation of Orléans by Joan of Arc. 
In Wichita, the Deputy Mayor of Orléans took part in a 
festival which included a reunion of veterans of the United 
States 137th Infantry Regiment, the liberators of Orléans 
in World War II. This regiment was composed largely of 
men from Kansas. Across the ocean in Orléans, the Mayor 
of Wichita participated in the traditional Joan of Arc 
N HE town affiliation idea attracted international 
both towns worked out a joint pro- 
with transcribed messages from Orleans. 
Wichita schobls, camera clubs and civie 
organizations collected school supplies, 
art objects, pictorial materials, manual 
training and sports equipment to be 
sent to Orleans. Arrangements were also 
made to send a group of Wichita citizens 
to Orleans in July and August as “com- 
munity ambassadors”. 
Educational Aid 
OME 15 other communities in 
Kansas, formerly the centre of 
America’s “isolationist belt’, are 
forming friendships with European cities 
or towns through the Kansas State 
Commission, which now has over 40 Coun- 
ty Councils for Unesco affiliated with 
it. Shipments of donated educational 
and cultural materials to schools, uni- 
versities and other institutions in Euro- 
pean towns will be a feature of this 
long-range programme for international 
understanding. 
The Kansas programme has been for- 
mulated with the aid of Operation Demo- 
cracy, a non-profit American agency 
which since 1947 has helped to “pair off” 
over 250 American and European com- 
munities. At this agency's offices at 
369 Lexington Avenue, New York, there 
is a waiting list of 40 more American 
towns anxious to affiliate witn commu- 
nities abroad. 
Most of the “adoption” towns are 
located in five European countries— 
France, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, 
Germany and Italy. Unexplored fields 
now being considered py Operation 
Democracy are Korea, India and Yugo- 
slavia. 
Origin of Plan 
HE exact origin of the town affi- 
| liation idea is rather difficult io 
trace in the welter of grass-roots 
experiments in internationalism which 
overtook America during and after World 
War II. It is known, for example, that 
Hudson, Ohio, “adopted” Souburg, Hol- 
land, as early as 1943. Some of the 
overseas relief agencies also used the 
town-to-town formula as part of their 
fund-raising campaigns in the United 
States. 
The movement gained its greatest 
impetus, however, as a result of the 
wide publicity given to the “Dunkirk 
(New York)-to-Dunkerque (France)” pro- 
gramme on Thanksgiving Dav, 1946. ln 
autumn, 1947, the town of Locust Valley, 
Long Island, affiliated with the French 
town of St. Mére-Eglise. With no little 
optimism, Locust Valley proceeded to 
incorporate its committee under the 
name of Operation Democracy. The name 
was as spontaneous as all the rest—a 
peaceful mission on the part of ordinary 
people, by and for the people everywhere. 
This initial project was immediately 
successful and drew many requests for 
advice from other American communi- 
ties. With voluntary aid. Operation De- 
mocracy, in January 1948, established 
headquarters in New York, defined a 
nation-wide programme and set in mo- 
tion the machinery to make it work. The 
programme was based on these princi- 
ples: 
People To People 
1. Overseas aid at this stage must carry 
a personal message from people to peo- 
ple. It must be the forerunner of a two 
way exchange of friendships and ideas. 
2. The community is a logical medium 
for such an exchange. It can be mobi- 
lized for action quickly and completely. 
It encompasses all phases of social, 
occupational and cultural existence, and 
its basic structure is the same everywhere. 
3. Community action along internation- 
al lines is in itself an important step 
toward the reorientation of the bation’s 
thinking. It dramatizes and brings home 
to the people of “our town” the down- 
to-earth meaning of what the headlines 
-and diplomats are saying. 
ly neglected in the past. 


### 73977: Grass roots' internationalism achieves positive results: Wichita-Orleans

‘Grass Roots Internationalism 
Achieves Positive Results 
Operation Democracy undertook the 
following concrete objectives: 
1. To encourage and develop interest 
in town affiliation programmes through- 
out the United States, and to explain 
these programmes to communities over- 
seas. 
2. To provide an information service 
for American towns, including details on 
Communities overseas, advice on Jocal 
organization at home, the shipping of 
gifts, liaison with voluntary and official 
agencies and programme publicity. 
3. To co-ordinate the efforts of affi- 
liated communities with a loosely knit, 
but basically integrated whole, with 
common aims and unity of purpose. 
4. To keep abreast of changing condi- 
tions abroad, diminishing or changing 
needs, new cultural exchange opportuni- 
ties, etc., and advise American Commu- 
nities on these matters. 
Operation Democracy saw cieany that 
charity as dramatized by posters deplct- 
ing a starving child, or a ruined city, was ° 
no longer enough. Such woras and 
phrases as “friendship”, ‘“people-to-peo- 
ple understanding”, ‘grass-roots diplo- 
macy ’—these were the new by-words 
throughout America. The agency there- 
fore stressed that aid per se should he 
regarded as one phase of inter-commii- 
nity relationship, a token of friendship, 
an act between neighbours, that always 
it should be preceded, and followed, by 
friendly personal contact between donor 
and recipient. Finally, that aid was to 
be only a beginning in a long-range pro- 
gramme of ever-widening contact between 
two communities. tir 
~ Work With Unesco” 
LOSE co-operation between Opera- 
{ tion Democracy and various bran- 
ches of the United Nations was 
inevitable, and this is best illustrated oy 
the present working arrangement with 
Unesco. Unesco State Councils in the 
three states (Kansas, California and 
Iowa), where Unesco is actively experi- 
menting with popular participation in :ts 
programme, have recommended the Ope- 
ration Democracy programme to its local 
county commissions, and many local 
groups have led their communities into 
town-affiliation programmes. Here, in 
line with Unesco’s international objec- 
tives, the emphasis is almost entirely on 
cultural exchange and the sending abroad 
of educational material and aids. 
As the need for emergency reief In 
Europe diminishes, Operation Democracy 
will urge—as it is now doing—greater 
effort in the field of educational reha- 
bilitation and purely cultural exchange 
along Unesco lines. It will also attempt 
to focus the attention of American com- 
munities on areas which have been large- 
Above all, 
however, Operation Democracy will con- 
tinue to expand its field of co-operation 
with ALL GROUPS, and ALL AGEN- 
CIES, and ALL PEOPLE working towards 
international understanding. It is and 
intends to remain a service organization 
rather than a “movement”. If at some 
future date a “movement” based on the 
town affiliation idea should arise, or if 
some already existing group such as the 
U.S. National Commission for Unesco 
should decide to adopt the technique on 
a large-scale basis, Oneration Democracy 
will be happy to make available all the 
technical services at its command.

“I know that there is a good deal of goodwill and 
a desire to help, but what I want is a mental apprecia-

sense that certain problems dominate the world.” 
Behind the political aspect, Nehru continued, lay all 
kinds of mass upsurges and there Unesco could do a 
tremendous job. : 
“I am glad that Unesco is spreading out more and 
more, spreading out not only to the countries of Asia 
and Africa, but spreading out in the

prepared for presentation to the Fifth General Con- 
ference of Unesco, to be held in May 1950. 
Inaugurating the Indian National Commission 
Pandit Jawharlai Nehru, Prime Minister of India, told 
the meeting—which was attended by over 300 persons 
from different parts of Asia—to look at world problems 
against the massive background of rapidly changing 
Asia. He stressed the new and vital importance of 
Asia in the world today, and the need for moral and 
spiritual values, and. an understanding of the basic 
problems which have caused “the vast upsurge in 
men’s minds all over Asia.” 
“We are today passing through a very vital and 
important stage in world history,” Pandit Nehru 
declared, “when another shift takes place in the centre 
of gravity. What happens in Asia is likely to have a 
powerful effect not only on Asia buf also on Europe 
and the rest of the world.” 
In the past, he said, the great problems of Asia 
were rather neglected and enough attention had not 
been paid to them either in the political or economic 
sphere. 
India today, stressed the non-political 
character of Unesco, reminding his 
audience that if they had a quarrel with ceriain 
political leaders this did pot mean that they 
were quarrelling with the literary figures of those 
countries. Ha cited Goethe and Kant, Tolstoy and 
Dostoevsky as examples. “Mankind must learn,” he 
said, “if it wishes to survive—and the only wav it can 
survive is by surrendering part of its sovereignty and 
serving a comumon world society.” . 
If humanity desired to develop a world society, he 
added, it must develop and educate people in world 
citizenship and make them understand that their 
national loyalties must be subordinated to the patriot- 
ism of the whole human race. 
Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, Minister of Education, 
in his inaugural address, expressed the hope that the 
Indian Commission svould serve as the focus of the 
nation’s educational, scientific and cultural activity, 
that it would help to enrich national life in those 
fields and also make for better co-operation and 
understanding with other countries.

Of ‘ Education for Life’ 
HUMAYUN 
KABIR, 
Joint Educational 
Adviser to the Gov- 
ernment of India 
and author of “Man 
and Rivers”, 
  
the most stupendous problem 
that faces India on the attain- 
ment of her independence. Her decision 
to become a secular democratic state adds 
to the urgency of providing for the 
adequate education of her teeming mil- 
lions. 
The importance as well as the difficulty 
"of the task may be measured hy the fact 
that almost 85 ¢¢ of the Indian people are 
illiterate, and yet the {future safety, 
welfare and progress of the State depend 
on ithe decisions which they may take. 
In its task of liquidating illiteracy, the 
National Government faces, on the one 
hand, the problem of the education of 
children of school-going age. This would 
train the citizens of the future. 
Of even greater immediate urgency is 
the education of the adult illiterates. For 
them, mere literacy is not enough as they 
must exercise the rights of citizenship 
even while they are undergoing instrue- 
tion in the letters. 
Fer children of school-going age, the 
Government have adopted a programme 
of basic education. The aim is to provide 
frez comnulsory education for all children 
between the ages of 6 and 14. The magni- 
tude of the problem can be realized when 
we remember that such children number 
about 45 millions. There are the prob- 
lems of school build.ngs and of providing 
funds for the expenses of education. 
Besides, the lack of trained teachers 
makes it impossible to bring all these forty- 
iD EMOVAL of illiteracy is perhaps 
five millions under immediate compulsory 
education. 
Three 5-Year Plans 
HE Government have, therefore, fram- 
ed three 5-year plans for achieving 
this end. The first §-year plan aims 
at bringing about 50 ¢% of the children 
between the ages of 6-11 under compulsion. 
At this stige, only the more populous 
villages will be taken in hand and com- 
pulsion will be extended by age groups 
from year to year. Thus, in the first year, 
all children of six plus in villages with 
a population of 1,500 or more will be 
brought under compulsory education. The 
‘next year compulsion will be extended to 
children of seven plus and so on. The 
second 5-year plan will extend compulsion 
in the same manner in the scaitered and 
less populous villages. The third 5-year 
plan will extend compulsion to all children 
between the ages of 11-14. 
For adult illiterates the government 
programme aims at providing instruction 
of a somewhat different type. Experience 
has shown that adults are not attracted 
by a merely literary training. Instruction 
for the adults is, therefore, conceived as 
Social Education. Such education will, in 
‘addition to the introduction of literacy, 
‘aim at the production of an educated 
mind among the adult illiterates. 
As befits citizens of a democratic State, 
the instruction will seek to inculcate in 
them a lively sense of the rights and 
duties of citizenship. There will also be 
instruction in the laws of personal and 
public health. The adult responds most 
quickly to an economic incentive. His 
economic interest will be roused by offer- 
.ing him information that may enable him 
to increase his earning capacity. Social 
Education also aims at training and 
refining his emotions through art, litera- 
ture, music, dancing and other recreative 
activities. Most important of all, it will 
‘emphasize the principle of human brother- 
hood and seek to impress on the adult 
the necessity of toleratian as essential to 
democracy and peace 
  
HE programme of social education 
will, in the first instance, be con- 
fined to people between the ages of 
15 and 45. Special emphasis will be placed 
on the education of women and grown-up 
girls. Educated mothers are the surest 
guarantee to ithe education: of the next 
generation. The target is the achievement 
of 50 per cent literacy in this age-group 
within the next five years. 
In order to prevent a relapse into 
illiteracy, the interest of adult literates 
will be maintained through clubs, discus- 
sion-groups, summer schools and similar 
agencies. The aim will be to make the 
village schcol not only a place of instruc- 
tion for children but the centre of com- 
munity life. On certain days in the week 
the school would be reserved exclusively 
for girls and women. 
Emphasis on Activity ~ 
HE essential feature of both basic 
wT educat:on for children and social 
education for adults is the emphasis 
on activity. 
It was Gandhiji who first tried to apply 
on a large scale this principle of teaching 
through activity. He went further and 
held that the activity must be social in 
significance, This is the essence of craft. 
He said that craft must be used in the 
education even of the child. Education 
based on a craft would not only help to 
develop his faculties but give him a 
consciousness of performing a social fune- 
tion from the very beginning of his life. 
In addition, learning through a craft 
would help in making education accessible 
to all. Our present economic backwardness 
cannot be denied. We ¢annot afford an 
expensive system of education, however 
desirable it may otherwise be. Basic edu- 
cation would help to solve the problem of 
finance, as it is at least partly self- 
supporting, The very small child may not 
produce objecis that are useful, but the - 
product of the older children would have 
some social use. Even if they have no 
marke! outside, they can be used by the 
~ school itself. - 
“A Danger To Be Avoided wie 
a. [Sn is, no doubt, a danger that - 
such a system may turn the school 
into a factory for exploiting child 
labour. This, however, would be an abuse - 
of basic education and there is no system 
in, the worid which cannot be abused. 
Whether for the child or the adult, the 
activity is a means to education. Educa- 
tion is, therefore, the end and the craft 
the means, but as Gandhiji would say, 
the means and thz ends are distinct but 
not separate. Provided it is remembered 
that it is a school training citizens of the 
future and not a factory turning out 
goods for current consumption, there is 
nothing wrong in insisting that the pro- 
ducts even of children must be good. In- 
sistence on quality is, in fact, a part of 
education itself. If a thing is to be done 
at all, i« ought to be done well. Th 
ne 
  
tures of to-day is an undertaking, 
in scope and form, comparable to 
discussing the literatures of all Europe. 
One can give an impression only, a 
silhouette at best Shrimati Sophia Wadia, 
the founder-editor of the Indian P.E.N,, 
has written: “A renaissance has been 
taking place in modern India under the 
impact of the literatures of the West.” 
It is that aspect which I wish briefly to 
touch upon. 
There are at least ten important 
languages in India, all active and vital. 
Among these must be included English, 
which is the language of the intelligentsia 
and a unifying force par excellence. Its 
importance can be gauged by the fact 
that there are a thousand English periodi- 
cals in Bengal alone and as many others 
in South India. It is significant that the 
Hindi and Urdu works of the great novel- 
ist Premchand, for instance, are. very 
rarely known to readers in other parts 
of India except through their English 
translations, 
Rabindranath Tagore is known 
throughout India largely through his 
English renderings of his own works; in 
fact, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for 
his translation—interpretation would be 
more apt—of his own Bengali poems, 
Gitanjali, Igbal, the great poet of the 
Panjab, is only known to readers outside 
his province due to Herbert Nicholson’s 
translation of his monumental poem: The 
Secrets of Self.

P oetry kl cL ae Pi 
what has come to he styled ‘Indo- 
| Anglian Literature, several writers 
have made a remarkable, if not al- 
ways great, contribution to literature. 
R.C. Dutt produced in brilliant hexameters 
The Ramayana and the Mahabharata, 
and introduced for almost the first time 
India’s great epics to the English-speak- 
ing world. Toru Dutt, whom Edmund 
Gosse called “the fragile exotic blossom 
of song”, produced superb poetry before 
she died at twenty. And in the realm of 
poetry one cannot omit to mention Saro- 
jini Naidu’s Sceptred Flute, which has 
won world-wide acclaim, the mystic and 
lyrical poetry of the sage Sri Aurobindo, 
and Rabindranath Tagore's Gitanjali. 
High praise must also be given to Bharati 
Sarabhais’ The Well of the People and to 
the poetry of B. Rajan and Harindranath 
Chattopahyaya. 
The Novel 
N the novel special attention must be 
given to Mulk Raj Anand, (whose 
Coolie, written directly in English, 
has been translated into thirteen lan-

Rivers, RX. Narayan’s The English 
Teacher, Bhabhani Bhattacharya’s So

in the short story by RK. Narayan, in art

The Dance of Shiva; in autobiography 
by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and in mis- 
cellaneous and philosophical writing by 
K.S. Srinivasa Iyengar, Swami Viveja-

Radhakrishnan. 
By and large, the literature produced 
in English is tinctured by Western techni- 
que and is therefore a superb synthesis 
and so in many ways muoh more inter- 
national. (1)

essayist, thinker, artist, musician, dra- 
matist and critic, excelling in every genre. 
His astonishing genius—because so all- 
embracing—has not as yet been fully 
evaluated. Both Igbal and Tagore realized 
that culture could not survive without 
being re-oriented and re-valuated; that it 
was essential to have it replenished and 
invigorated by external influences; that, 
in fact, it was necessary to be a universal- 
ist. Tagore was the genius wo, while re- 
maining completely Indian, was a true 
world citizen. 
Social conflict is the motif of the 
modern Indian literatures and their every 
aspect is discussed, treated and empha- 
sized. A considerable amount of attention 
is being paid to the translation of works 
  
Secular sculpture is often found in Indian 
temples. Above. “Young Woman Writing a Love 
Letter” (8-11th Century) is from temple at Orissa. 
  
HEN 1 saw Rabindranath Ta- 
\Y gore for the last time he was 
a venerable figure bowed down 
with age and honours. He had 
just returned from a tour of Persia 
where he had been a guest of the Em- 
peror. That long flight had caused him 
some trouble and he found it very dif- 
ficult to breath in a crowded atmos- 
phere. Yet hie hac come to pay his res- 
pects to anot,er great compatriot of his, 
a scientist—the late Sit P.C. Roy. Tagore 
made a short speech which had all the 
magic of his personality. One could 
“feel” the presence of greatness. In his 
beautifully made robe and with his silken- 
white hair he looked as if he had just 
stepped out of India’s glorious past. He 
was at once a hope for the future. 
I look back on that day with a sense 
of pride because for once in my life I 
was not disappointed in the presence of 
greatness. 
" The Failing Light 
ABINDRANATH Tagore was born 
on the 6th of May in 1861—a criti- 
cal time in the political and literary 
fistory of modern India, 
“I was born when the modern age in 
Bengal had just begun.” he wrote. “The 
light of the past age was then failing 
but had not quite gone out. I was able 
to get some idea of it from behind, 
partly by suggestion and partly from 
personal experience. ‘There were many 
things in it which showed signs of senile 
decay, the weakness and laxness of which 
might make ce feei ashamed, if judged 
by modern standards. Yet certain other -. 
things were discernible in those days, . 
which like the rays of the setting sun 
amidst the shades of evening cannot be 
debited to the side of darkness...” 
Tagore's eariy life savas spent in the 
wonderful spiiit of Upanishadic learning, 
and also in ‘he hotbe¢ of the most ad- 
vanced radical thought then prevalent 
in Bengal. He thus passed early through 
the fever of iervid nationalism at a time 
when many educated Indians were prid- 
ing themselves on the exclusive use of 
the English leaguage. 
While still a young boy, Tagore went 
to Europe to study literature. This was 
perhaps a tuming peint in his develop- 
ment, Henceforth he began to give ex- 
pression, pernips unconsciously, to the 
masterly assi:nilation of the two cultures 
which his analytical as well as highly 
creative brain was capable of doing.

Kafka, Rolland and Gide are always in 
vogue. Short stories, especially French, 
American, Russian and English, are spe- 
cially in demand, as are also travel diaries 
and sketches and modern poetry and lite- 
rary criticism. The thirst in short is al- 
most insatiable. 
The Modern Theatre 
1@— His has been the state of arrairs 
1 during the last few years. Plays 
have been written and produced 
but these are mostly adaptations, transla- 
tions or social farces, sometimes satires 
or simply social or political propaganda. 
So much attention has been given to the 
facile form of the radio feature that the 
creative capacity of most playwrights 
seems to have been atrophied and 
crushed. In the garden of poetry it is 
different; peasant poetry has been written 
and lyrics have been sung and fine com- 
positions made by Bachhan and Josh 
and Hafeez. In the realm of poetry, at 
any rate, the inspiration has not been 
stilled and some exquisite poetry has 
appeared. The general tendency is to 
appeal to the masses. 
The New India is emancipating itself 
slowly from the shackles of foreign 
“isms”. Literature is to be measured by 
tion of the past 
  
the extent to which it enriches civiliza- 
tion. Civilization may have its national 
features or geograpnical profiles but it 
must transcend all geographical boun- 
daries. Literature is an expression of 
what elevates man; its aim the culture 
of the mind and its main effect to 
ennoble it. 
There must and will be a “rehabilita- 
and, to use the words 
of Ananda Coomaraswamy, “a process of 
creative introspection preparatory to re- 
newed activity... In India, as in Europe, 
the vestiges of ancient civilization must 
be renounced: we are called from the 
past and must make our home in the 
future. But to understand, to endorse 
with passionate conviction, and to love 
what we have left 
behind is the only 
possible foundation 
for intellectual and 
spiritual power. If 
the time has hard- 
ly yet come for 
the creation of new 
values... let us re- 
member that time 
and suffering are 
essential to all cre- 
ation,”

Sarat Chandra and Tarashankar from Bengal;

itself, which is contemporaneous with 
that of ancient Sumer and Babylon. The

Dominated Literary Scene 
AGORE'S influence on the writers 
of Bengal as well as on the rest 
of India, has been overwhelming. 
He dominated i1-e literary scene of his 
native Bengal for such a long time that, 
with the notable exception of the novelist 
Sarat Chatterjee, no new school of litera- 
ture grew up in Bengal for nearly sixty 
years. 
A veritable Tagore cult developed in 
Bengal where young writers and artists 
even copied the po~t’s handwriting and 
spcke in the larguage of Rabindranath’s 
poems. 
When, at the age of sixty, Tagore took 
to painting, it created a sensation not 
only in India but in the salons of Paris 
where his tableaux were on view. His 
manyfold gemus is too intricate for 
detailed descrintinn in this short article. 
He absorbed Isz'emic and European cul-

philosophical essays and translations of 
his original works in Bengali. 
Rabindranatn is perhaps the only 
Asiatic poet wiinse genius was recog-

life-time. Honours were heaped on him 
by learned so:ie.ies and humble institu-

irrigate her fields of thought and intel-

barren and unproductive. Already there 
is the unmistakable sign of her returning 
fertility. The brilliant crop of scientists 
she has produced during the last fifty

India will contribute to the general body 
of science as effectively as any other 
nation. 
In experimental and mathematical

### 73984: System of 'untouchables' abolished

System of Untouchables” 
© Aholished 
R countless generations, the system 
of “untouchables” has hung like a 
curse. over India. Mahatma Gandhi, whe 
had revolted against this concept and 
practice while still a little boy, dedicated 
himself, along with many of his coun- 
trymen, to the battle against “untoucha~ 
bility”. 
“It may be a mere dream”, he wrote, 
“as unreal as the silver in the sea-shell, 
It is not so to me.” : 
On another occasion he declared, 
“Swaraj (self-government or indepen- 
ce) is a meaningless term, if we desire 
to keep a fifth of India under perpetual 
subjection, and deliberately deny to them 
the fruits of national culture”. 
Last January, a little over a year after 
Swaraj, the Government of India passed 
a constitutional law abolishing the sys- 
tem of ‘“untouchability”. This revolution- 
ary development coincided with the 
adoption of the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights which India is thus doing 
her best to implement. 
The new law grants full citizens’ rights 
to every Indian, irrespective of sex or 
social status. This means that, for the 
first time, millions of former “untoucha- 
bles” will have the right to vote when 
the general elections are held in India 
next year. 
In other ways too, the former 
“untouchables” are being given new op- 
portunitics. Places of worship, from 
which they were barred, have now been 
opened to them. In Bombay, the Govern- 
ment has already opened schools to them 
on the recommendation of a committee 
which included Dr. Ambedkar, once an 
“untouchable” himself and now India’s 
Minister of Justice. Under the Govern- 
ment’s ten-year plan, all Indians are to 
be fitted to play a full part in the life 
of their country,

### 73985: The Artistic revival in India: music, the dance, painting

### 73978: India in the world today

THE ARTISTIC REVIVAL IN INDIA 
MUSIC, THE DANCE, PAINTING 
N India we speak of the 
| | sixty-four arts, but so deep 
has been our degeneration 
within these three or four cen- 
turies that only music has remain- 
ed the most traditionally alive and 
technically developing expression 
of the aesthetic creative force in 
India. The Moghuls were great 
lovers of music and, as such, the 
musical tradition, especially in 
North India today, is very vigor- 
ous and capable of absorbing 
more new tendencies. 
Like all things traditional, how- 
ever, the new can only be absorb- 
ed in terms of the principles al- 
ready established and even when 
it takes a new form the change 
is ultimately imperceptible. The 
great musician Abdul Karim 
Khan was no inferior to the 
masters of the Indian musical 
tradition, but yet it carried a new 
element of the modern without 
hurting the established principles. 
He and his disciples are without 
doubt to-day the most impressive 
examples of the Indian tradition 
capable of adapting itself to mod- 
ern conditions. The famous school 
of music in Lucknow is an 
example of this new spirit. 
But in the South, where the 
tradition continues in a more vir- 
ile form, the public still has a 
taste for the forms which have 
not changed perhaps for several 
hundred centuries, and music still 
  
Dance ruies dating back over 
2,000 years are still faithfully 
observed in India to-day. 
Using a “language” of ges- 
ture, posture and movement, 
the dancers can portray epi- 
sodes from Indian epics, ex- 
pressing such varying emotions 
(rasas) as love, pathos, wrath 
or fear, 
Their techniques include 
movements of the feet and 
ankles, and body bends, each 
of which signifies something 
visible. The neck, head, eyes 
and eyebrows are all brought 
into play, the three fundamen- 
tal eye gestures alone express- 
ing 36 feelings. 
Hand and fingers signs (mu- 
dras) are used to extend the 
“story telling” code. For one 
hand there are 38 “mudras” 
and for both hands, 37, some 
of which bave over 40 mean- 
ings.

plays an important part in the 
lives of the people. You could 
walk almost anywhere in the 
streets of South India and hear 
some of the finest of classical 
music and also see representations 
of certain traditional patterns of 
Indian dancing, 
Traditional Dance Forms 
N fact, Indian traditional 
dancing is still a very vital 
part of South Indian social 
life. Whether it be in temple or 
courtyard, or home, the hand 
symbols and eye movements and 
foot work of the famous Bharatha 
Natya Sastra are still {o be seen 
practised, and in Malabar the 
Kathakali traditions of dancing 
are so popular that almost every 
week troupes move from village 
to village, dancing the story of 
one of the great epic characters, 
Saint, Hero or Mother. And in 
the North, particularly in the 
various States ruled by Mahara- 
jahs, the northern school of danc- 
ing called Kathak still flourishes 
with its most complicated foot- 
work. In the East of India, the 
Manipari school of dancing has a 
recovered grace which is lost else- 
where. 
There is no doubt that Indian 
dancing is one of the forms of 
Indian traditional art that will 
effect a very great change in the 
dance techniques of Europe, once 
it gets known. The success of a 
dancer like Ram 
Gopal outside 
India shows the 
immense possi- 
bilities of this 
traditional art

painters trained in European 
techniques discovering the Indian 
mode of sensibility, such as in 
Amrita Sherghil, produced some

confessed nevertheless that India 
to-day has no great painter, 
whereas she has poets, musicians 
and dancers who are inferior to 
no one in the preceding centuries. 
Assimilation of the Past 
iHE Indian problem in the 
arts—as in her social and 
intellectual problems— re- 
mains the same: the revolt 
against the past has only made 
for the inevitability of the assi- 
milation of the past. In fact, fra- 
dition based as it is on unchang- 
ing principles, has a capacity for 
adaptation which surprises one. - 
The Indian artist has no fear to 
be modern, because, for him, to 
be modern is only to manifest the 
contemporary mode of a classical: 
expression. Realism or change 
cannot make him afraid for they 
are only methods of renewal at 
"the level of expression and not at 
the basis itself. Indian artistic 
tradition thus proves to the world 
that the metaphysical is the only 
recurrent discovery of every re- 
vival. Hence, there is hope for 
Indian art. 


### 73986: Contemporary Indian films for international understanding

  
Contemporary Indian Films 
For International Understanding 
  By 
Kwaja Ahmad Abbas 
who is the sponsor of the In- 
dian Peoples Theatre Move- 
ment has an intimate know- 
ledge of modern trends in the 
ndian film industry and there- 
fore writes on them with 
authority.     
OMPARATIVELY speaking, 
India has had practically 
no opportunity of export- 
ing her culture through the 
medium of the cinema. The 
few Indian films that have 
ever crossed the seas have 
been seen by very limited 
‘audiences, and it is still doubtful 
whether they will ever be able to 
compete successfully with Amer- 
ican and European products in 
the foreign market, 
But there is no reason wny an 
attempt should not be made to 
secure ab least a specialized and 
select audience abroad for the 
right type of Indian films. Some 
of our Ambassadors have already 
taken steos to secure good Indian 
films for ‘exhibition in their Em- 
bassies. Film societies, cultural 
organizations and edacational ins- 
t:tutions in all countries would 
surely welcome opportunities of 
seeing, from time to time, a re- 
presentative selection of Indian 
films, 
But it is important that foreign 
audiences should learn to look at 
Indian films as a mirror of Indian 
life, and should not expect that 
universality of interest which the 
standardized product from Hol- 
lywood is able to provide. The 
foreigner is sometimes apt to 
complain that Indian films are 
inordinately long, though none 
of them so far has beaten the 
record of Gone With The Wind. 
It is true, however, that the 
tempo of story development in an 
average Indian film is slower 
than in its Hollywood counter- 
part. So, to a foreigner, it seems 
longer. 
This criticism applies not only 
to film making but to a whole

way of life. The Indian films are 
slow because the tempo of Indian 
life is slow. The Indian films 
will acquire the nervous ten- 
sion and mounting tempo Ot 
a Hollywood thriller when the 
impact of industrialism has 
created the same psychological 
atmosphere in India as in 
England and America. 
The preponderance of songs in 
an Indian film has been its most 
exasperating feature for foreign- 
ers and even for westernized In- 
dians. The commercial (and, 
therefore, primary) reason is that 
the cinema in India has develop- 
ed mto an omnibus entertainment 
for millions of uprooted peasants 
and small town folk who have 
lost. their rich traditions of folk 
song and folk dance and found 
nothing to substitute it in the 
cities and the big towns. 
Again, through religious musical 
expressions like kirtan, bhajan 
and gqawwali, the song is woven 
into the fabric of Indian life more 
closely and intimately than in 
any other country. 
What kind of Indian films 
should be shown abroad? There 
can be as many answers as the 
different varieties of films pro- 
duced by us. Some would favour 
mythological and puranic films 
as they represent the “spiritual” 
heritage of India; others would . 
favour the historical films about 
our emperors and empresses to 
show to the world “the Glory 
that was Ind”. No doubt their 
colourful pageantry would appeal +a 
to the Western audiences as they 
approximate more closely to the 
average Waesterner's notions of 
the “exotic” East. 
The modern-minded  ultira- 
realists would ban the export of 
all such films and insist that 
only films on contemporary 
themes should be sent abroad. 
But again there would be diver- 
gence of views as to whether it 
is advisable to send out some of 
our films which expose our social 
evils, as that might create an un- 
favourable impression about In- 
dia. 
If the task was left to me, I 
would select the following ten 
films for internation-exhibition.. 
  
The Indian actress Jayasree in 
the title role of Shakuntala, the 
Indian film version of the 
Sanskrit classic by Kalidasa. 
I wouldn't say they are the Ten 
Best Indian Films, though ob- 
viously some of them would come 
in that category; but, taken to- 
gether, they provide a more or less 
complete crsss-section of India— 
and the Indian cinema. Here, 
then, is my list: 
1. SEETA (East India Films). 
This, in my epinion, is the most 
dignified, the most beautiful and the 
most meaningful mythological film so 
far produced in India, It has none of 
the tinselly gaudiness which charac-~ 
terizes some of the more elaborate and 
expensive films on the same theme. 
2. VIDYAPATI (New Theatres). Ko- 
garded by many as Devaki Bose's 
greatest and last masterpiece, this 
film should be included because it 
handles a typically Indian emotienal. 
mystic theme in an artistic manner, 
and aise represents a distinct era in 
Indian histery and a (somewhat ideal- 
ized) picture of eld feudal society. 
3. PUKAR (Minerva). Though tech- 
nically better films have been produced 
on Moghal themes, this remains the 
mest impressive and significant of 
them all. Through this stery of 
Jehangir's sense of justice, the world 
will get a glimpse of all that was best 
in the Moghal era. 
4, TUKARAM (Prabhat). Dozens of 
devotional pictures about every cenceiv- 
able saint in India have been made 
but in utter simplicity, fidelity of 
detail and humanistic appreach, Tuka- 
ram remains unbeaten. One need not 
believe in miracies or even in religion 
to believe in a human being like Tuka- 
ram; the proletarian saint who 
preached a good life by his food 
actions, 
53. DEVDAS (New Theatres). Here is 
the classic story of emotional frustra. 
tion, written by the inimitable Sarat 
Chatterjee, and filmed with a youthful 
artistic flair by Barua, 
6. PRESIDENT (New Theatres). A 
modern melodrama in Hollywood style, 
the ‘father and founder” of the boy- 
meets-girl films in India, and Director- 
Scenarist Nitin Bose’s abiding contri- 
butien to Indian filmcraft. 
7. JNEXPECTED (Prabhat). Directed 
by Shantaram in the days when he 
believed in utter realism, and the first 
daring and progressive picture on the 
theme of forced marriages. 
8. BARI DIDI (New Theatres). The 
most beautifully poignant story of a 
widow's frustrated cmotions, handled 
with rare artistry and dignified 
restraint. ’ 
9. DHARTI KE LAL or CHILDREN 
OF THE EARTH (People’s Theatre). 
The first non-commercial, realistic 
feature-documentary on the grim 
tragedy of the Bengal Famine. 
16. DOCTOR KOTNIS (Rajkamal), 
Shantaram’s filmic tribute to the young 
Indian doctor who died a martyr’s 
death in China, while serving human- 
ity, along with the Congress Medical 
Mission. The right note en which te 
conclude this series of films represent.

Population Problems Of India 
and Pakistan 
by Dr. Sripati Chandrasekhar 
    PART. II 
In our April issue, Dr. 8S. 
Chandrasekhar, head of the 
Department of Economics, Anna- 
malai University. Chidambaram, 
India, discussed some of the main 
causes underlying the population 
problems of Pakistan and India. 
these problems. The two articles, 
in expanded form, will shortly be 
published as part of the Unesco 
sponsored “Food and People” 
pamphlet series. 
Last month, Dr. Chandrasekhar 
concluded by stating that the 
population problem has to be 
considered in relation to the means 
of sustenance, main’y food supply.        
by primitive methods of farming, 
dependence on the vagaries of the 
monsoon, sub-division and fragmen- 
. tation of land, consequent on the Hindu 
«and Moslem laws in inheritance (which 
«enjoin the succession to immovable pro- 
- perty by all male heirs, usually in equal 
i proportion) leading to uneconomic hold- 
ings and to excessive dependence by the 
majority of the people on land for 
Jivelihood. 
t- The primitive technique of Indian 
farming is responsible not only for the 
~ low yield per capita, even when compared 
t¢ countries like Japan and China, but 
also for the gradual deterioration of land 
with soil erosion and deforestation. 
This does not mean, however, that 
there is no scope for improving Indian 
farms and their yields. According to 1939 
official statistics, one third of the culti- 
‘vable land in both India and Pakistan 
‘lies idle—not fallow. 
Thus of a cultivable area of 432 million 
acres, only 53 per cent is sown with crops, 
“11.8 per cent is fallow, and no less than 
358 per cent of land is cultivable but 
“left waste. 
India has, therefore, not exhausted the 
fsupply of her cultivable land, and what 
is cultivated appears to be eroded and 
exhausted because of the primitive tech- 
‘nique of farming. With modern methods 
¥01 agricultural science, of erosion preven- 
tion and soil reclamation, the cultivated 
-Jand can be made to double its present 
syield and bring much of the so-called 
_mncultivable waste under profitable culti- 
iy ation. Such an improvement is welcome 
“3but it will touch only a fringe of the 
problem. 
«it While increased yield and more acreage 
- of cultivation are possible with the aid

population problem, unless and until a 
substantial number of people now depen- 
dent on land are transferred to some 
other productive employment like indus- 
tries, 
Industrializaiion 
NDUSTRIALIZATION is often offer- 
ed as a stock remedy for Indian popu- 
lation problems. The industrialization 
that has taken place in India during the 
last thirty years, however, has not helped 
to ease population pressure because it 
has been piecemeal and unplanned, and 
the percentage of population gainfully 
employed in modern industry has been 
less than one per cent of the total popu- 
Jation. 
Only planned large-scale and rapid in- 
dustrialization and the development of 
cottage industries—there need be no con- 
flict between these two-—can keep pace 
with the growing population and siphon 
We pubiish below a second 
article in which the author ! 
examines possible answers to 
 
a 
~ 
‘off the surplus population from the over- 
crowded land to factories. 
India’s industrialization is important 
in the solution of her population prob- 
lems for two reasons. It will increase 
the productivity of labour and create an 
abundance of badly needed commodities 
and services and transform the present 
economy of scarcity into an economy of 
abundance. Secondly, and this is probably 
more important for India, industrialization 
will encourage the development of new 
urban patterns of living which lead to 
the control of the high birth rate. 
Migration 
HAT about migration as a solu- 
\ tion to the Indian population 
problem? As far as external or ~ 
international emigration is concerned, 
there seems to be no opening, because 
the world has not reached the stage for 
the adoption of an international migra- 
tion policy based on the just needs and 
available resources of various countries 
and peoples. And once we grant, as we 
must, that every country must have the 
right to determine the composition of 
her population, India cannot object to 
the unwillingness of certain countries, 
however thinly-populated they may appear 
to be, to receive large numbers of Indian 
immigrants. 
Nor does India want to crea.e unhappy 
minority problems as in the Union of 
South Africa. The total number of In- 
dians settled overseas as permanent 
immigrants to-day number about four 
and a half million, but the annual in- 
crease of India's population is about five 
millions. Even were emigration outlets 
available, it is unreasonable to expect a 
major portion of this increasing popula- 
tion to leave their homeland. For India, 
such relief may not even be a permanent 
solution. 
As for the possibility of internal migra- 
tion as a method of relieving the popu- 
lation pressure, there is not much scope 
either, because there are no empty spaces 
within the geographical confines of India 
and Pakistan, 
™ ERTAIN patterns of inter-provincial 
migration established in India dur- 
ing the last thirty years show that 
inter-provincial migration has been 
constantly going on. We have no reliable 
figures, but these population movements 
are more of a seasonal migration and do 
not have any permanent effects. And 
then. when one group of people have 
moved out of a certain province, another 
group of people seem to be moving in. 
So the net result of such inter-and- 
intra-provincial movements does not seem 
te constitute any relief to the pressure 
on the land. 
If migratory movements between differ- 
ent regions are to be explained as a 
response to the “pull” of prosperity from 
less crowded areas, rather than the 
“push” of poverty from overcrowded areas,

there are no regions in India where the 
standard of living of the masses is 
markedly higher than in the rest of 
India. Thus, whatever the internal mi- 
gration that has taken place in the last 
thirty years in India, this has been in 
response to rigorous famines or the con- 
struction of new irrigation projects and 
canals, rendering the cultivation of more 
land possible. 
In these circumstances, internal migra- 
tion offers no substantial relief from 
population pressure And the partition 
of the country, which has already forced 
- upon both India and Pakistan communal 
migrations, renders the prospects of inter- 
provincial migration dim, 
rae 
Birth Control 
HE last and the most important 
1} solution is that of Birth Control. 
It is too late in the day for India 
to discuss the pros and cons of Birth 
Control. The arguments for and agamst 
contraceptives have been advanced and 
the scientific verdict has been in favour 
of it. Birth Control appears to be an 
important solution. It certainly has a 
vital role to play in India's population 
policy, along with the modernization of 
agriculture and the industrialization of 
tne Indian economy. 
Apart from the general rural conser- 
vatism of the masses that offers resis 
tance to every reform, there is no orga- 
nized resistance either by the government 
or the church as in some countries. Nor 
are the Indian religions opposed to 
planned parenthood It will not be a 
hard task, therefore, to enlighten the 
public mind in India as to the benefits 
of Birth Control. 
Human Conservation 
ESPITE the unprecedented scientifie 
advances in the world during the 
last thirty or forty years, there is 
ar enormous human loss in India from 
conception to old age. With all the avail- 
able resources of scientific knowledge, 
skill and facilities for protecting people’s 
health, and curing or alleviating the many 
ills and disabilities to which people are 
exposed, India continues to waste thou- 
~ sands of human lives. 
Despite our belief in the intrinsic value 
of human life as a central value of our 
culture, we have offered resistance to 
certain reforms that encourage healthy 
and purposeful living. Human erosion and 
loss, therefore, persist long after they 
have become unnecessary because of 
certain traditional ideas and beliefs that 
still linger from the past. 
While belief in “fate” as a controlling 
factor is slowly tending to disappear, it 
has not disappeared completely. These fata- 
listic beliefs persist in every society, but 
much more so in India, long after they 
have been rendered obsolete by scientific 
knowledge which is powerless to displace 
them. 
The way out in this matter is to give 
up clinging to archaic ideas and practices 
that are no longer walid according to 
present knowledge, nor compatible with 
democratic affirmation of human values.

### 73983: Scientific strides of modern India: towards industrialization

  
SCIENTIFIC STRIDES 
~ (Continued for page 7) Ch 
The late P.C. Ray, the doyen of Indian 
science, was almost singly responsible 
for building the present Indian schools 
of chemistry, now led by such brilliant 
chemists as S.S. Bhatnagar, J.C. Ghosh, 
N.R. Dhar, JN. Mukherji, K. Venkatu- 
raman, P.C. Guha and others. In the 
capable hands of Bhatnagar, Ghosh, 
Dhar and Mukherji, physical chemistry 
in particular has made remarkable pro- 
gress in recent times. NEE Te 
Expanding Research 
HIS sweeping reference to the name 
and work of a few prominent 
scientists selected at random by no 
means represents either the volume or 
the intensity of the research now being 
carried on in India in various branches 
of science. Nor is it intended to attempt 
such an account here. What is impor- 
tant to note is that efforts to cultivate 
the modern sciences, which are hardly 
fifty years old in India, have already 
begun to bear fruit. 
Thus, judged by the comparatively recent 
availability of research facilities and the 
extreme poverty of scientific laboratories, 
India’s scientific achievements which 
include one Nobel Laureate and eleven 
Fellows of the Royal Society. the highest 
scientific distinction in the British Com- 
monwealth of Nations. are itself a 
glowing tribute to her inventive and 
creative genius. 
. 
Technology 
And Industrialization 
NDIA has, however, been less suc- 
cessful in 
technology. The development of these 
is closely related to the economic condi- 
tion of a couniry. The primarily agricul- 
tural economy of India, with little or no 
applied research and’ 
- development of industries, has so far 
militated against the development of 
applied sciences. From the experience 
of other countries and also from India’s 
own experience, it is clear that her fu- 
ture economic progress will be impossi- 
ble of achievement without substantial 
industrialization. 
At the same time, it is also true that 
the success of industrialization will largely 
depend on the country's scientific and 
technological ability. ) 
Both the scientists and the statesmen 
are now keenlv alive to this fact. Prime 
Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, who himself 
received early training in science, has 
given a fitting recognition to the su-.. 
preme importance of science in nation- 
al welfare by creating a full-fledged 
Government Department of Science, 
directly under his own responsibility. 
One of the principal organs of this 
Department, the Council of Scientific 
and Industrial Research, has planned a 
chain of national laboratories. A num- 
ber of these Laboratories have already 
been established under the directorship 
of able and internationally known scient- 
ists, both Indian and foreign. 
Closer Ties With Other Nations 
NDIA is passing through a momen- 
tous period of her history. Her 
scientific ability is the greatest asset in 
all the steps she is now taking for future 
development. Need for intensive collabo- 
ration with other nations in the fields 
of pure and applied sciences is greater 
than ever. For this reason, she specially 
welcomed the establishment of Unesco 
and of its Field Science Co-operation 
Offices, one of which is now functioning 
in India and has already proved of great 
service, Such scientific collaboration will 
not only benefit India but all the nations 
of the world. . =...

«World Radio Caravan’ 
Proposed for Unesco 
~ plan to use mobile radio 
equipment for recording 
programmes of Unesco 
interest in different parts of the 
globe, was recommendsd by a 
committee of radio experts meet- 
ing at Unesco House, Paris early 
this month. 
The committee suggested that 
radio producars from different 
national organizations should be 
invited to collaborate in produc- 
ing these programmes. 
Tt considered that the first of 
these tcurs, if approved, could 
cover several European coun- 
tries and begin next Spring. If 
this plan croved a success, 
Unesco might examine the 
possibility of developing similar 
projects in other parts of the 
worid. 
Dr. Torres Bodet told the 
radio specialists that everything 
would be done to obtain approval 
from Unesco's General Confer- 
ence to make these tours 
possible. 
The committee, which includ- 
ed leading radio personalities 
from France, Switzerland, Bel- 
gium, Great Britain, Brazil, the 
United States and Ind.a, met to 
review the work accomplished 
by Unesco's Radio Unit during 
the past few months. I: con-

importance to Unesco, because it 
is a material essential to the spread of 
education and scientific and cultural knowl- 
edge, and to the development of mass com- 
munications. That product is paper and, 
especially, newsprint. 
Unesco, ever since its establishment, has 
given particular attention to the problem of 
the world’s needs in respect of paper and 
newsprint. The zurvey of the technical 
~~. needs of the press, radio and cinema, 
which has been systematically conducted 
by our Organization since 1947 and which 
by the end of this year will have covered 
44 countries, has made it possible to show 
what these needs are. 
The experts who have met each 
year to examine the results of the 
survey have siressed the dangers 
of an insufficient supply of news- 
print from the three standpoints 
of the independence of the press, 
social progress and international

D. Schneider, C. a Prato Named 
To Key Unesco Posts | 
TWe key positions in Unesco, which have remained vacant during 
the past year, were filled last month with the appointment of 
Mr. Douglas H. Schneider to head the Department of Mass Com- 
mun;cations, and Dr. Carlo a Prato of Italy to the Bureau of Public 
Information. These are the first high-ranking appointments to be 
announced by Dr. Jaimes Torres Bodet since he assumed directorship 
of Unesco late in 1948. 
OUGLAS 
Schneider, 
formerly chief 
of the Public 
Affairs Over- 
seas Program- 
me of the 
U.S. Depart- 
ment of State, 
took up his 
new duties on May 1 and is 
expected to arrive in Paris about 
May 15. He is widely known 
in press, radio and film circles in 
Paris and other parts of Europe. 
Educated in the United States, 
England and France, Mr. Schneid- 
er taught English, French and 
Latin in a boys’ school near Paris 
and organized summer sessions in 
France in which U.S. university 
students met French students. 
In 1940, Mr. Schneider return- 
ed to the United States as editor 
of European Programmes with the 
World Wide Broadcasting Founda- 
tion and later news editor and 
programme manager of the Foun- 
dation’s international radio sta- 
tion WRUL, in Boston. 
When the United States enter- 
ed the war, Mr. Schneider joined 
his country’s Office of War In-

developed in this matter between 
my Secretariat ant that of the

It is my earnest wish that this 
co-operation betwezn Specialized

endeavour by governments to find 
a solution for the problem before 
us which shall take account at

human society, of physical neces-

In this as in everything else it 
is the requirements of society and 
the spiritual aspirations I have 
mentioned which inform Unesco’s 
viewpoint. Unesco’s point of view 
is that of the public and those 
who serve the public: of the few 
seeking to express themselves, of 
the masses crying for education, 
of sundered peoples seeking to 
know and understand each other. 
In a word, Unesco approaches the 
question—that of paper like all 
others—from the angle of the 
needs of intellectual and social 
progress. For Unesco, that is a 
duty embodied in its Constitution 
and repeatedly confirmed by suc- 
ceeding General Conferences.

WIEAT | 
We publish on this page extracts 
from a few of the replies received 
by Unesco in response to its en- 
quiry into the current ideological 
controversies centering around the 
key-word “democracy”. 
These represent only a very small 
selection of the 30 questions and 
over 80 replies—{(many more than 
20 pages in length) which philo- 
sophers, historians and social scient- 
ists from all parts of the world sent 
to Unesco. 
The results of the Unesco enquiry, 
along with a selection of the replies 
" received will probably be published 
in book form. 
QUESTION : “To what extent will vou 
agree that the word ‘democracy’ is 
ambiguous ?” 
Answer given by Professor Richard 
McKeon, University of Chicago : 
The word “democracy” is ambiguous 
not jn the sense that many different 
formulae have been proposed to define 
its meaning, but in the sense that many 
different interpretations have zen 
proposed and elaborated for a formula on 
which there has been remarkable con- 
tinuity of agreement. Very few discussions 
of demeccracy, adverse or favourable, 
would be distorted in interpreting “demo- 
cracy” as the “rule of the people in their 
own interest’. The ambiguities in the in- 
tferpretation of this formula arise from 
two interrelated sources : (1) the deter- 
mination of the means by which the 
people may “rule in their own interest” 
and (2), the determination of who the 
“people” are, The discussion of the first 
source of ambiguity turns on defining 
terms like “law”, “order”, “freedom”, and 
“equality”, while the discussion of the 
second source turns on the relations 
between pairs of contraty terms such as 
“the many and the few” and “the poor 
and the rich”. ERS

QUESTION : “The opinion has become 
very widespread that there is no such 
thing as ‘democracy’ in general, but 
only a long series of ‘democracies’, 
differing with diffcrent historical, social 
and psychological conditions : there is 
Athenian democracy, Mediaeval demo- 
cracy, Bourgeois democracy, Proletarian 
" democracy, Soviet democracy, but neo 
‘general democracy’. To what extent 
would you subscribe to this opinion ?". 
Answer given by Professor Charles 
Beltelheim, University of Paris : 
. Bourgeois democracy is a democracy for 
the bourgeoisie and a dictatorship for the 
proletariat. When bourgeois democracy 
is in its most democratic guise, this 
dictatorship takes the form, essentially, 
of an ideclogical dictatorship; it imposes 
on the proletariat (by means of the 
school, the church, the press, radio, film, 
ete.) views and ideals designed to 
maintain the supremacy of the bour- 
geoisie. But the weapons of material, 
violent dictatorship — the police, army, 
law courts and prisons — are always 
* ready to hand, and are resorted to 
whenever the proletariat, as for instance 
on the occasion of a strike, strays from 
the path which the bourgeoisie wants it 
fo follow. They are also resorted to when 
the ideological dictatorship is weakening 
and the proletariat subscribes to an 
ideology other than that of the bour- 
geoisie; the latter then attempts to 
sutbstitute open dictatorship for the 
former masked dictatorship, and bour- 
geois democracy disappears. 
Proletarian democracy, in its turn. is 
a democracy for the proletaciat and a 
dictatorship for the bourgeoisie.

Conf usion In Use 
of Term Studied 
HE peoples of the world, lavmen no less than experts, have never been 
1 | more conscious of the conflicting and contradictory ideas which 
surround them than in recent vears. Ideological conflicts are present 
everviwhere, between within nations, between minds, 
within minds, 
Few words have played a greater role in these disagreements than the 
wora ‘‘democracy”. The problem is one of vast implications. It is not just 
a question of terminology. It has its background in contrasts of historidal 
aevelopment, of social conditions, of political patterns, It is deeply entangled 
in the immense cluster of problems raised by the impact of technology and 
industrial civilization on the lives of peoples ererywhere. It is not only 
problem of philosophy—it is a problem of war or peace. 
Although many have tried to analyze the causes and responsibilities for 
disagreements, the problemn has not vet been attacked on the international 
leve! within the general framework of organized efforts towards international 
understanding. 
nations, 
i N order to bring a little more clarity into preseni-day discussions. Unesco 
undertook a rast enquiry on the concept of “democracy”. A questionnaire 
was sent to 300 philosophers, historians, jurists, economists and to all 
Unesco National Commissions. 
Then, armed icith the replies (small parts of which are reproduced on 
this page), a commillee of experts from six countries met in Paris early this 
month “to consider the causes of ambiguity and confusion in the present 
use of the term ‘democracy’ and their role in political disputes today.” 
In a concluding declaration, signed by all six members, the committee 
found that there are not fixed and extreme poles of divergence and that 
Ea . . . 
‘there are abundant indications of fundamental agreements.” 
Understanding 1s possible, the statement said, if “alleged facts are 
treated as facts and conirasted with facts” and if “ideals and theories are 
treated as aspirations and contrasted with other expressions of purpose and 
intention.” 
The declaration admitted that “clarification of the present-day ideological 
conflict... is not in itself sufficient to insure peace,” adding however, that 
it would “serve to separate the real issues from the preblems which arise 
from confusions of statement.” 
ea EC LARITY of statement,” therefore, “will make understanding possible” 
and by isolating the problems “it will simplify the total situation 
ond permit the concentration of attention on practical issues and possible 
actions.” 
The declaration noted that “for the first time in the history of the world 
ne doctrines are advanced as anti-democratic” and added that “eren the most 
skarply contrasted forms of democracy share a cemmon tradition of 
humanism.” . 
The six experis admitied that “these basic agreements in statement are 
overlain with a great complexity of disagreements” but pointed out that 
“power rivalries tend to sharpen the ideological conflict into two opposed 
positions and to conceal the great variety of theories and parties.” 
In addition, the declaration continues, “the fact that the ideological 
conflict is not between two fixed and extreme views... affords grounds for 
the expectation that the conflict of ideologies may be clarified... The 
clarification of the issues will attenuate the effect on the general public of 
rropaganda tending to incite to violence.” 
HE statement concludes with the following words: “Ultimately the 
resolution of ideological conflicts depends on the free interchange of 
mjormation, of cultural materials, and of persons. The peoples of the world 
cannot understand each other in all the diversities of their cultural, social

EAE LR 
give a slightly different interpretation to 
each part of the definition or to stress 
one particular part. I have myself inter- 
preted rhe phrase “government of the 
people” as proving that the people are 
the source of power in a democracy, for 
I do not see in what way the obedience of 
the peoples to the government is peculiac 
to democracy any more than to any other 
political system. It is difficult to say 
whether this definition represents three 
essential principles of the democratic 
system of government. because it is too 
vague to be the basis of an exact criterion. 
It is in fact possible to interpre: and 
adapt this definition in such a way that 
it is apnlicable to systems whose demo- 
cratic nature is oven to doubt. 
QUESTION : “Should ‘demeocracy’ be 
used to cover a narrow concept, a polit-

cover a broad concept, a socio-political 
concept designating conditions and 
methods as well as results of decision- 
making?” 
© Answer given by Professor C.I. Lewis,

To say that anything should be done 
implies some criterion of correctness. But 
the understood meanings of words ate 
themselves the criteria of their eorrect

QUESTION : “Is ‘political demecracy’ 
the best means to achieve the goal of 
‘social democracy’? Is ‘social democracy’ 
the best means io achieve the goal of 
‘political democracy’? Is ‘political 
democracy’ a means to any single goal 
at al? Are the two concepts at all 
related as means to ends?” 
Answer given by Professor 
Wright, University of Chicago : 
Quincy 
I th.nk political democracy and social 
democracy are reciprocally related as 
means and ends, that is, either may be 
treated as means and the other as end 
according to the general philosophy of 
values an individual may have. As a 
practical matter. I think that under most 
c:rcumstances, it is more expedient to 
begin with political democracy with the 
anticipation that progress in political 
democracy will develop social democracy 
as has been illustrated in the case of 
England. Political democracy, however, 
implies reasonable security and literacy, 
and perhaps, reasonable prosperity. It is 
clear that the geographic position and 
resources provided these conditions in 
England and the United States more 
than in any other country. It is therefore

not surprising that political democracy

A 
QUESTION : “To what extent do you 
consider the strict distinction between 
the concept ‘method of decision-making’ 
and the concept ‘contents of decision 
made’ a justified and fruitful one? 
What arguments would you think val- 
id for supporting the tendency to reserve 
the word ‘democracy’ for the method of 
decision-making, thus rejecting it as a 
broader term comprehending the condi- 
tions, the methods and the contenis of 
the decis.on-making? 
The attacks upon this line of arguing 
have not lagged behind in violence. 
Answer given by Humayun Kabir, New 
Delhi : 
Whar is interesting to note in this 
connexion is that the protagonists of 
“democracy” and “socialism” are, in spite 
‘of their violent disagreement about the 
relative values of liberty and equality. at 
one in their dissociation of means from 
ends. The “democrat” emphasizes liberty, 
and insists that whatever be the result, 
the method of taking decisions is what 
matters. So long as the appearance of & 
free political decision is there, it is im- 
material to him whether the consequences 
bring social justice or not. In other words, 
he is concerned only with the means and 
not with the end. Equally, the “socialist™ 
who insists that equality must be establish- 
ed in every sphere of life, whatever be 
the method adopted for achieving it, is 
prepared to flaunt his adherence to the 
view that the end justifies the means. 
Thus the two agree in the divorce of 
means from ends even though to one jit is 
the means that alone matters, and to the 
other, the end. 
To sum up. even if ends are not means, 
means and ends are so related that each 
modifies the character of the other, The 
condemnation of an end must, therefore, 
necessarily lead to the condemnation of 
the means to it. Contrarily, if the means 
are indefensible, this would immediately 
rouse doubts about the justification of 
the end itself. ) 
A 
QUESTION “Does ‘democracy’ presup- 
pose general agreement on fundamental, 
indisputable principles within the groups 
it is applied in: if so, what are these?”, 
Answer by Dr, A.C. Ewing, Cambridge 
University = 
I do not think democracy presupposes 
general agreement on anv fundamental 
principles except this one:—that the 
differences between the rival parties are 
not sufficiently great to warrant their 
settlement by force.” 
QUESTION: “Is there any incompatibility 
between the ultimate political aim 
described by Lenin and the aims pre- 
claimed by other idealists to be of 
ultimate or intrinsic value?”, 
Answer given by Professor Stanislas 
Ossowski, Warsaw University : 
When we follow the discussion between 
the ideological adversaries in the iweo 
camps on questions of principle, we are 
struck by the fact that there is no lack 
of a common language. The case is 
otherwise in their discussions with the 
partisans of racialism —with those who 
acknowledge the swastika. Both, in stat- 
ing the reasons for their programmes, 
invoke the same values, though the 
emphasis is not placed on them in the 
same way. The coademnation of the 
western democracies, which is delivered 
by the advocate of the socialization of 
the means of production. is not a econ- 
demnation of the cult of freedom. The 
battle with economic liberalism, the battle 
with bourgeois liberalism. can be engaged 
under the banner of a liberalism dif- 
ferently conceived. The argument in such 
discussions is, in general, designed to 
show that the other camp has betrayed 
or debased the ideals to which both 
adversaries have subscribed. In saving 
this I do not mean to under-estimate the 
essential differences between the two 
camps, the differences between their 
scales of values and their ways of react- 
ing to various present-day facts in social 
and political life, We shall, indeed, 
examine how it is possible to arrive at 
such sharp ideological contrasts, when 
the main postulates in each case have 
been the same. In this way we shall also 
throw some light on the divergency of 
meaning attached {0 the word “de- 
mocracy”.

### 73988: More newsprint production urged

More Newsprint Production Urged   
CutTurAlL NEEDS STRESSED 
(Continued from page 10) 
T is a fact that, since the end 
of the war, there has been an 
appreciable improvement in 
the world production of newsprint. 
This is ma.nly due to the increase 
of North American production, 
which has risen by 25 9% in four 
years. To take an instance, Ca- 
nada is today producing over a 
million tons more than in 1945 
(which, including Newfoundland, 
makes a total of 4,535,000 tons, 
or 60 % of world production). 
That is a remarkable effort, to 
which tribute may properly be 
paid. 
World production today exceeds 
7 1/2 million tons; the average for 
the period 1935-1939 was slightly 
lower. 
‘This brings us to the first ques- 
tion, whether this output is suf- 
ficient; and Unesco's reply is an 
emphatic negative. 
In Unesco’s eyes there is a 
serious shortage which threatens 
to grow progressively worse in the 
coming years and decades unless 
we now take energetic steps to 
speed up the expansion of pro 
duction. 
MARKET DEMAND VERSUS REAL NEEDS 
T ihis point I should like to 
A revert to the notion I have 
just mentioned of the in- 
tellectual needs of the peoples of 
the world. 
I know that the newsprint de- 
mand for 1949 has been calculated 
at about 8,200,000 tons; in view 
of the estimated production, the 
margin left will be small, Even if 
governments abolished the restric- 
tions on the import of pulp, coal 
or paper called for by the present 
exchange position, and we sudden- 
ly reverted to a universal system 
of free trade, demand would pro- 
bably not greatly exceed 9 1/2 
million fons. That is a target by 
ho means unattainable if it is 
borne in mind that there is today 
an unused productive capacity 
amounting to nearly 1,400,000 tons. 
But what do the figures mean? 
Merely that those are the amounts 
of newsprint which governments 
or the press think could be bought 
and consumed commercially. They 
do not mean that those are the 
amounts which peoples should 
consume to be properly informed, 
yet that is the real standard. 
To assess correctly—that is, in 
terms of humanity how far pro- 
duction is adequate, its relation to 
demand is not enough. Demand is 
a market phenomenon which very 
imperfectly reflects the real de- 
sires of the community and still 
more imperfectly its objective 
needs. Today more than ever 
‘before, there are too many factors 
keeping demand to a minimum 
below the real requirements of 
social and international progress; 
financial restrictions, politics, lack 
of resources, and technical igno- 
rance. \ : 
The Ever Widening Gap 
T is untrue to say that the real 
I] needs cannot be calculated. 
On the contrary, they stare 
us all in the face, and are set 
down in black and white in demo- 
graphic and school statistics. Now 
it is indisputable that between the 
needs implied by those statistics, 
on the one hand, and, on the 
other, production—and, even mcre, 
quantities commercially available 
—there is a vawning gap, which 
must grow wider in the near fu- 
ture. 
NPP SPINA PSP 
INDIAN NEWSPRINT 
In India, the production of 
paper for newspapers and 
books is vital for the fight 
against illiteracy. Plans re- 
cently announced in New 
Delhi provide for the manu- 
facture of 250,000 tons of 
paper in 19852, including the 
first production of newsprint 
in India. 
r  a a] 
Even in industrialized countries 
with a low percentage of illiter- 
ates, the press does not every- 
where enjoy adeguate supplies. As 
an instance, in the older countries 
of Western Europe, the combina- 
tion of exchange difficulties, the 
general needs of reconstruction 
and military expenditure has 
made vestrictions necessary, re- 
ducing consumption to a glaringly 
inadequate level, although the 
productive capacity of those coun- 
tries is more than adeguate to 
their needs. This is true of the 
United Kingdom, of France, of 
Holland and Italy, where annual 
consumoption in kilogrammes per 
head has sunk respectively be- 
tween 1935-1939 and 1948, from 
26.2 to 8, from 8.8 tb 6.4, from 12.2 
to 6.3 and from 1.7 to 1.3. 
Even the United States and Ca- 
nada, whose joint consumption 
exceeds 5 million tons, or 2/3rds of 
the total world production, anti- 
cipate requiring about a million 
tons more in, the coming years.

our eyes if we mish to evolve a 
pian of production up to the real 
needs of humanity. It is a situa- 
tion which must be, not accept 
ed, but condemned as abnormal 
and corrected as unhealthy, Other- 
wise we should be striving to halt 
the rising tide of history. 
But I have emphasized the extent 
of the needs to be met too strong- 
ly to omit an indication of a few 
steps liable to do something to- 
wards increasing present produc- 
tion. 
Some of these steps concern 
paper«naking proper, others the 
production and utilization of 
wood. 
With regard to paper-making, 
it is important to secure the full 
utilization of existing mechapical 
capacity: I have already pointed 
out that a fraction of this, of 
some 1,400,000 tons capacity, is 
still unused, of which about a 
third is in Great Britain, We 
must also mention Japan, whose 
production has fallen from 400.000 
tons to 100,000 tons, and Ger- 
many, which has not yet reached 
half of its pre-war production. I 
do not overlook the complex and 
often indirect causes of this, I 
merely say it is important that 
an effort be made to find a re- 
medy. 
More Paper Mills Wanted 
T is quite clear, however, that, 
| even if present manufactur- 
ing capacity were fully uti- 
lized and the most up-to-date 
methods applied to it, it could 
not fill the needs of tomorrow in 
particular. In the circumstances, 
it appears necessary to consider 
the large-scale bhuild-

are 2 1/2 times above

FRANCE SWEDEN U.K. U.S.A, 
on an enormous scale is taking 
shape and gathering speed, which 
demands and is already beginning, 
a large-scale expansion of teach- 
ing. 
In the fourteen years between 
1934 and 1948, Uruguay, Ecuador 
and Cuba doubled, and Venezuela 
trebled, their consumption of 
paper; but it has not been the 
same in China, to which we owe 
the invention of paper but whose 
own consumption per head per 
year does not exceed 0.1 kilogram- 
me, despite a 10 % increase in 
the last ten years in the numbers 
able to read; nor in India and Pa- 
kistan, which are about level with 
China; nor in Siam, which con- 
sumes less than before the war 
though the number of people who 
can read and write has risen by 
17 % in seven years; nor of Tur- 
key, whose consumption is down 
by 20 % despite the continued 
spread of education. 
Thus, although production is 
up to the pre-war level and the 
time is near when it will be equal 
to the commercial demand, there 
could clearly be no course more 
dangerous nor more unjust than 
to accept this spurious equili- 
brium. 
Abnormal, 
Unhealthy Situation 
ORE than half the world’s 
M population is still illiterate. 
Yet everywhere there is in- 
sufficient paper, and that unfair- 
ly divided, for those who can read. 
Those are the basic facts which 
we must have constantly before 
N.Z. NETH.

terest are under con- 
sideration or in hand 
in various countries. 
Such efforts must be 
encouraged and, if 
need be, assisted, for 
instance, by arrang- 
ing to supply these 
countries with engi- 
neers and technicians. 
Similarly, if only to 
economize in the use 
of forest reserves, it 
is desirable to stim- 
ulate research into 
the possibility of replacing wood 
pulp, in part at least, by 
other materials such. as straw, 
rice straw, sugar cane fibre, 
rushes, bamboo and certain tropi- 
cal growths, Unhappily, it must 
be admitted that the experiments 
so far carried out in this con- 
nexion are far from conclusive as 
regards newsprint, which must 
conform to specialized standards 
to be capable of being handled by 
high-speed rotary presses, The re- 
sults so far obtained, like those 
of the various methods of salvage 
by remilling or de-inking of old 
paper, cannot do more than pal- 
liate the shortage. However, as I 
said before, the needs are so great 
and so urgent that no supplement- 
ary source should be overlooked. 
  
Priority for Five Trees 
URNING to wood production, 
it is not for a layman like 
myself to offer the least 
suggestion to such experts as you. 
Nevertheless, where the use of 
wood by the paper-making indus- 
try is concerned, no one can fail 
to be struck by two outstanding 
facts. 
The first is what I have no 
hesitation in describing as the 
very small percentage represented 
by paper-making in the total fig- 
ures of timber used. During the 
last few years that percentage has 
been reduced still further, parti- 
cularly in Europe, by the urgent 
needs for fuel, building material 
and textiles consequent on the 
ravages of war. Even in Canada, 
  
    
Important out-of-print period- 
icals may soon be available in 
microfilm or photo-offset re- 
productions, according to a 
plan recently devised by Unes- 
co as a result of numegous re- 
quests made by war-damaged 
and newly established libraries 
and research institutions for 
help in obtaining copies of 
sich journals. 
As the first step in this plan 
Unesco has selected a small

Out-of-Print Periodicals 
number of ouf-of-print period- 
icals to be reproduced and has 
contacted the original publish- 
ers. When final arrangements 
have been completed, lisls of 
the periodicals indicating re- 
production costs and other 
data will be circulated to pos- 
sible subscribers. Microfilm or 
photo-offset copies will be 
made, according to request, by 
contracting with commercial 
establishments.     
I am assured that paper-making 
has never accounted for more 
than 17 % of the total lumber 
felled. Co 
The other fact regarding the 
utilization of wood by the paper- 
  
World newsprint consumption, 
making industry is the extremely 
small number of species suitable 
for manufacture into newsprint. 
Despite the experiments carried 
out in a number of countries on 
certain tropical timbers, the usa- 
ble species remain the fir, balsam, 
poplar and spruce; recently the 
Mediterranean pine has been 
added {o the number; it has given 
excellent results in the Southern 
United States and has the added 
advantage of quick growth. 
These facts seem to me to in-. 
dicate the lines which interna- 
tional co-operation should follow. 
I am of course well aware that 
wood has to serve many pure 
poses vital to man, Nevertheless, T° 
should like to ask this Conference 
to consider the possibility of includ- 
ing among the recommendations 
to be addressed to Governments, 
a proposal to raise the percentage 
of timber production set aside for 
paper-making. At the very least, 
I think it is necessary to give 
priority in manufacture to the 
use of the species enumerated 
above, 
UNEQUAL NEWSPRINT DISTRIBUTION | 
point which I think it my 
duty to put forward, con- 
cerning not the production but 
the distribution of newsprint, 
| ASTLY, there is a fourth 
In the case of the principal pro- 
ducers distribution is still gov- 
erned by the commercial commit- 
ments in force before the war. 
Consequently, little account is 
taken of the new needs arising 
from the tremendous political 
and social upheavals in the world 
during the last ten years. Before 
the war distribution was already 
almost exclusively to industri 
alized countries, and this ten- 
dency has been aggravaled in the 
post-war years by the unequal 
purchasing power of currencies, 
and, in particular, by what has 
been called the “dollar famine”. 
This has resulted in certain coun- 
tries’ exporting a proportion of 
their output to countries with a 
harder currency although their 
own domestic market is inadequa- 
tely provided for. CL 
These two factors together have 
resulted in extreme inequality of 
consumption. Enormous areas of 
the world are practically without 
supplies, and in the very areas 
where there is the greatest need 
to intensify the battle against 
ignorance, resources are most 
lacking. In this connexion Unesco 
has produced statistics showing 
annual consumption per head in 
kilogrammes. These figures do not 
call for much comment and I 
shall quote a few examples only. 
While the United States’ con- 
sumption per head in 1948 was 
32.4 kilogrammes, that of China, 
India, Pakistan and Syria did not 
exceed 0.1. The equivalent figure 
for Canada is 21.3; for Australia 
and Sweden 18.2; for New Zea- 
land 12; for the Argentine 9.7, 
for Switzerland 9.2; and for Den- 
mark 9; while it is 1.7 for Greece, 
1.6 for Poland and Brazil, 1.3 for 
Italy and Portugal, 1 for Colom- 
  
bia and Peru, 0.9 for the Philip 
pines and 0.4 for Ceylon.

With Goodwill Destroy 
Inequality 
T is not for Unesco to suggest 
here remedies for this situa~ 
tion. But it is Unesco’s duty 
to appeal on each occasion to the 
goodwill of all in order to correct 
as far as possible such inequality 
in the distribution of a product 
so essential for the intellectual 
and social progress of humanity, 
It may be that the general plan - 
of this preparatory Conference 
which is concerned with all the 
problems relating to the various 
uses of timber, may forbid the 
necessary exhaustive study of the 
questions I have raised. Should 
this be so, it is my hope that a 
special conference should be call. 
ed at a later date to be devoted 
solely to the question of paper 
and newsprint. 
I should like, however, already. 
in wishing you all success in your 
work, to thank you again for giv 
ing me the opporfunity to join 
my efforts to yours. I know that 
my appeal will not have been in 
vain. Between those who supervise 
the growth of trees and those 
who are devoted to the education 
of children, there is a natural and 
undeniable sympathy.
