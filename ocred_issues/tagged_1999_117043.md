FOREVER TWENTY

Cuba’s young men and women in a hurry face up to a frustrating situation 
where time seems to stand still 
Spend an evening in Havana or some 
i other Cuban town such as Matanzas 
or Pinar del Rio and you get the fee- 
ling time is at a standstill. The past slips 
away, and the future is a long time 
coming, so you are left stuck in the pre- 
sent. To be 20 years old in Cuba is to be 
20 years old for ever. It is either a won- 
derful gift or a refined form of torment. 
The choice is yours.

the immensity of time. Young people have 
many hopes, but they are quickly 
betrayed. After three or four dreams have 
come to nothing, those that are left seem 
vain. Impatience makes you see every- 
thing that happens in the same way. You 
haven’t yet learned the adult art of 
concealing boredom. 
Asking young Cubans about the futu- 
re, or—to put it more bluntly—about 
their destiny, is like asking them for a false 
address. They’ll say they've never heard of 
it, that it doesn’t exist. The shrewdest of 
them will say that the future is elsewhere, 
not here. 
When you're 20, you want to be 
somewhere else, far away. Perhaps most 
20-year-olds feel like that, all over the 
world. They certainly do in Cuba. The 
capital and provincial towns and villages 
are full—crowded and empty at the same 
time—of things that signify nothing. 
You're at the ideal age to enter a new 
world, but you find the world around you 
has already been taken over by others who 
got there before you.

in a country at the end of its history.

grounds that there have already been 
enough changes in the country’s history. 
When you are young, you tend to look 
for things that have not been fouled up by 
earlier generations, things that they did 
not know about and so are untainted by 
their approval. 
Fed up with provincial life, people can 
set their sights on moving to Havana, 
while people tired of Havana will want to 
leave the country. Afterwards, often when 
it’s impossible to return, they will want to 
be back in Havana, or in some provincial 
town or village. The reason for such wan- 
derings is partly biological, partly politi- 
cal. Or rather totally biological and total- 
ly political, if we accept that in cities 
human biology has become political. 
A thirst for adventure 
The Cuban government has often mana- 
ged to turn this desire to escape to its own 
advantage. Taking part in other countries’ 
wars, compulsory military service, schoo- 
ling organized in the fields,and the mobi- 
lization of teenagers all exploit this need 
to leave home and slake a thirst for adven- 
ture. These are children’s crusades, 
exceptional intervals in the prevailing 
stagnation.

live in the unending present, the best ploy 
1s to saturate each moment with activity,

that joie de vivre or a horror of the void— 
take your pick. Young people in Cuba are 
full of both.

them of mixed blood. One fifth of the population live

Since the 1959 revolution, Cuba hasbeen a com-

being president is chairman of the Council of State 
and the Council of Ministers, first secretary of the 
Cuban Communist Party (the only permitted party) 
and commander-in-chief of the armed forces.

Several hundred Cuban doctors are presently 
working outside the country. The tradition of sen- 
ding doctors abroad started soon after the revolu- 
tion began and peaked between 1975 and 1989. 
In the early 1990s, the collapse of the commu- 
nist bloc plunged Cuba into a serious economic 
crisis. According to the Cuban government, the 
island’s gross national product (GNP) fell by 35% 
between 1989 and 1993, and then rose by 2.5% in 
1995, 7.8% in 1996 and 2.5% in 1997. According to 
United Nations statistics, Cuba's per capita GNP was 
$1,983 in 1995. Castro has cautiously opened up the 
country to foreign capital, allowed the free circu- 
lation ofthe U.S. dollar, and encouraged the deve- 
lopment of tourism. These changes have led to 
the reappearance of social problems such as pros- 
titution and petty crime which had been eradi- 
cated or had become insignificant. 
In the political sphere, the one-party system 
continues to exist, the independent media cannot 
develop, and international human rights organi- 
zations deplore the way dissidents are treated. 
An estimated one million Cubans are thought to live 
in exile. nu

After work in a rural school (escuela del campo) near 
  
Pinar del Rio in western Cuba. Secondary school pupils over the age of 12 attend such schools for two months 
bound to produce young people with an 
outsized acquisitive instinct. To be 20 in 
Cuba is to be obsessed with money. A 
country where wages are paid in the 
national currency but where you can only 
live if you have foreign currency, incites 
people to flee, to go to the place where 
that currency comes from. 
One might object that education will 
eventually change the situation of Cuban 
youngsters. But teachers’ lessons do not deal 
with the real world. This is inevitable. Like all 
education, Cuban education teaches people 
to aspire, to want certain things, to achieve 
goals. But these are verbs that cannot be 
conjugated when time stands still, when 
there is a void. If the youngsters happen to 
get good training, it will simply equip them 
to live far away, abroad. 
The equation boils down to shortages 
on the one hand, and money and beauty 
on the other. This is a discovery made at 
20 which stays with you until the day you 
sink into oblivion and death. 
In Cuba, at 20, you discover another 
reality: the inability to run your own life, or 
to try to balance the two sides of the equa- 
tion. But long before you reach 20, you dis- 
cover that what’s lacking is freedom. nu

CUBA'SNEW WAVE 
OF WRITERS AND POETS 
e poet and short story writer Antonio José 
Toor was born in 1964 in Matanzas, about 
100km east of Havana, and in 1980 moved to the 
Cuban capital where he studied hydraulics. After 
qualifying he worked as a hydraulic engineer for 
five years. 
He has won Cuba's National Critics’ Prize 
twice—in 1991 for Poesia 1982-1989 (“Poetry 
1982-1989”, published by Letras Cubanas, 
Havana) and in 1995 for his book Un seguidor de 
Montaigne mira La Habana (“A disciple of 
Montaigne looks at Havana”, published by Vigia, 
Matanzas). In 1995, he was awarded a writer's 
scholarship by the Alejo Carpentier Foundation 
in Havana. His first book, Trece poemas 
(“Thirteen Poems”) was published in 1988 by the 
Cuban ministry of culture and won him the 
young poet's prize in the same year. 
In 1997, he published Asiento en las ruinas(“A 
Seat inthe Ruins”, Letras Cubanas publishers) and 
a short story, Corazon de Skitalietz (“Heart of 
Skitalietz”). His latest book, Las comidas profundas 
(“Profound sustenance”), was published in 
Spanish in 1997 by the French publisher Deleatur, 
in Angers. This elegant and scholarly work, which 
ishard to categorize (itisneither a short story, nor 
an essay nor a novel) deals with the history of food 
and the relationship between human beings and 
what they eat. 
The International Writers’ Parliament in Stras- 
bourg recently awarded Ponte a one-year scholar- 
ship to live in Porto, Portugal, and write a novel. 
While in Portugal he will continue to contribute to 
the Cuban magazines La Gaceta de Cuba, Union 
(the magazine of the Cuban Writers’ and Artists’ 
Union, UNEAC), Casas de las Americas and Letras 
Cubanas. 
At 34, Ponte is one of the new wave of young 
Cuban poets and writers, including Leonardo 
Padura, Abilio Estevez, Ronaldo Menendez Pla- 
sencia, Daniel Diaz Mantilla, Ismael Gonzalez, Ales- 
sandra Molina and many others. [|

### 117045: A Crucial encounter

A CRUCIAL ENCOUNTER 
  
Federico Mayor 
  
Genetic tests 
and treatments 
must not be 
allowed 
to create new 
forms of 
discrimination— 
between those 
who, for whatever 
reason, can or 
want to take 
advantage of them, 
and those who 
cannot, mostly for 
lack of money 
If a scientific discovery can form the basis of a technology, then it is highly pro- 
bable that the technology will eventually be applied. Today this lesson of his- 
tory is causing anxiety among politicians,scientists and public opinion concer- 
ned about the current far-reaching developments in biotechnologies. 
It is now possible to penetrate to the very essence of living things as a result of 
spectacular scientific advances that are gradually revealing the innermost mecha- 
nisms of life. The technologies based on this field of knowledge offer humanity for 
the first time astonishing powers to revolutionize the process of creating and deve- 
loping human beings and, ultimately, the human species. Technically speaking, 
these breakthroughs could lead to the revival,in even more effective guises,of euge- 
nic practices we hoped had been buried forever. Fortunately, this nightmare sce- 
nario seems highly unlikely. 
But history also shows that new technologies are rarely applied without a fra- 
mework of rules and procedures designed to ensure that they are beneficially used. 
Human progress has always been driven by the winds of freedom, including free- 
dom of enquiry and initiative, but human beings have always tried to head in the 
right direction and to respect certain limits. The biologists have done their work: 
they have sown the seeds of vast possibilities. Now it is up to society to make sure 
that only the benefits are harvested. The biotechnology revolution beckons huma- 
nity to a crucial encounter between science and ethics. 
Where human reproduction is concerned, as with technology in general, we 
must be guided by respect for three basic and interdependent principles—dignity, 
freedom and solidarity. 
For human dignity to be respected, each person must be regarded as unique. 
This position has far-reaching consequences for human procreation. First of all, it 
rules out cloning as a means of reproduction because this technique, which is 
almost upon us, involves genetically “duplicating” an existing person. More gene- 
rally, predetermining the basic characteristics of a future person, notably trying to 
enhance their future physical or mental capacities, violates the very essence of 
human individuality. This kind of engineering would end up by depriving indivi- 
duals of that which is theirs alone—the mysterious processes whereby their unique 
genetic heritage emerges and interacts in its own unique way with their environ- 
ment. 
Advances in prenatal scanning and testing techniques may confront parents 
with grave new decisions. The danger is that various kinds of pressures or even 
regulations will develop which only allow “genetically correct” people to be born. 
This would be totally unacceptable. No authority—be it political, social or econo- 
mic—should be able to enact such a “genetic order”, still less impose it. 
So increasing emphasis must be laid on solidarity. Genetic tests and treatments 
must not be allowed to create new forms of discrimination—between those who, 
for whatever reason, can or want to take advantage of them,and those who cannot, 
mostly for lack of money. 
The risk of uncontrolled, unmonitored genetic engineering increasingly looms 
over us. But we are starting to see the emergence of a new “responsible” form of 
genetic engineering in which the power of science is subjected to the power of 
ethics—an ethics that benefits everyone, not just a few, and looks towards future 
generations, not just short-term interests. u

### 117046: Millennium bugs with a deadly bite

MILLENNIUM BUGS 
WITH A DEADLY BITE 
  
+ Robert Matthews 
Through an arrogant or ignorant disregard for ecological complexities, ceaseless human 
encroachment on nature can unleash a terrible new threat of killer diseases carried by 
microbes that have long lain undisturbed 
At first, the men seemed to be suffering 
I from nothing more than a case of 
influenza: a bad headache, aching joints, 
a fever. But it quickly became clear that 
dozens of Durba’s gold miners in the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo were in 
the grip of something far worse.Somehow, 
late last year, they had come into contact 
with a terrifying infectious agent that was 
attacking all their internal organs, causing 
them to bleed uncontrollably. 
Over the following months, over 60 
miners died from the mystery disease, their 
limp bodies covered with blotches and 
oozing blood even after death. Local doctors 
had never seen anything like it. At first,not 
even seasoned experts from the World 
Health Organization (WHO) could say for 
sure what was causing such appalling 
deaths. 
But many harboured the same suspi- 
cion: that the miners had become infected 
by a so-called emerging virus: a tiny packet 
of genes that had lain undisturbed in its 
natural lair for years, perhaps millennia— 
until humankind blundered into it. 
The suspicion was that the mystery 
disease was caused by a so-called filovirus, 
a thread-like virus whose devastating effect 
on the human body had first been disco- 
vered 30 years ago. 
In 1967, dozens of people working in 
laboratories in Germany and Yugoslavia fell 
ill with eerily similar symptoms. Seven died, 
and many of the survivors suffered long- 
term effects ranging from impotence to 
insanity. The source of the infection was 
traced to a batch of vervet monkeys 
imported from Uganda, many of which had 
died during transportation. 
The monkeys were found to be car- 
rying a filovirus, which was duly named 
after one of the German towns where the 
first cases emerged: Marburg. To this day, no

cure has been found. If the victim’s immune 
system cannot fight it, it’s over—a fate that 
awaits over 50 per cent of those who become 
infected. 
Deadly pathogens— 
do not disturb 
In May, WHO confirmed everyone’s 
fears: tests on blood samples taken from the 
miners showed that they had indeed been 
infected with Marburg virus. Soon reports 
began to emerge of an outbreak of the same 
disease among soldiers in Zimbabwe. Thou- 
sands of troops had been crossing into DRC 
to support President Laurent Désiré Kabila 
as he tried to put down a rebel uprising. 
Fortunately, blood tests on three soldiers 
suspected of carrying Marburg turned out 
to be negative, and by early summer the out- 
break in Durba was over. The virus had 
vanished again, back into its jungle haunts— 
but precisely where, no one knows. Somew- 
here out there, a creature—a species of bat, 
perhaps, or a rodent—is unwittingly acting 
as a refuge for Marburg. 
What is clear is that the more incur- 
sions into virgin territory humankind 
makes, the greater the risk of another 
encounter with Marburg—or perhaps some- 
thing worse. After decades of insouciant 
use and abuse of the world’s natural 
resources, from the primordial forests of 
equatorial Africa to the oceans, the threat of 
disturbing new and deadly pathogens now 
has to be taken seriously. 
The warning signs have long been clear. 
As long ago as 1485,reports emerged of a 
disease known as the Sweating Sickness, 
in which victims progressed from sudden 
sweating to prostration and death in just 24 
hours. It struck four more times before 
vanishing again in 1551. But the country 
affected was not some isolated jungle com- 
munity in the tropics. The Sweating Sick- 
ness wreaked its havoc in England, ultima- 
tely claiming the lives of around 20,000 
people—over 0.5 per cent of the total 
population. 
Recent research has linked the emer- 
gence of Sweating Sickness to a strikingly 
Deforestation in Madagascar. The emergence of several lethal viruses has been linked to the destruction of 
woodland.

arpurg virus was 
modern phenomenon: deforestation.The 
timing and spread of the outbreak ties in 
with the mass destruction of woodland in 
Shropshire, on the western borders of 
England. The suspicion is that forest wor- 
kers somehow allowed the virus respon- 
sible for the disease to spread beyond the 
creature that had acted as its host for count- 
less generations, bringing it into contact 
with populations big enough to sustain an 
epidemic. 
This is a scenario that has been played 
out again and again in our own times. In 
Argentina after the Second World War, vast 
areas of the Pampas were cleared with her- 
bicide to make way for new crops. In the 
process, the natural balance between a spe- 
cies of field mouse and its predators was dis- 
turbed, and the numbers of the former 
soared—as did those of itinerant farm-wor- 
kers. By the early 1950s, people began to fall 
prey to fevers, vomiting and headache. 
Some went on to suffer massive haemor- 
rhaging, and died hideous deaths.T he cause 
was eventually traced to a previously unk- 
nown virus,Junin,carried by the field mice. 
The same story was repeated in Bolivia, 
where farmers keen to grow maize hacked 
down stretches of jungle near the M achupo 
River. Sure enough, the reports of strange, 
horrible deaths amon g farm-workers started 
to roll in, and their cause was traced to 
another haemorrhagic virus, duly named 
Machupo, again carried by field mice. 
And earlyin 1999, evidence emerged to 
link campaigns of deforestation to the rise 
of the most notorious emergent disease of 
them all: Aids. In February, an interna- 
tional team of researchers published a paper

Finding its way into cities via infected meat

selves, HIV-1 went on to be sexually 
transmitted throughout the world, accor- 
ding to this latest research. To date, over 12 
million people have died from Aids, 80 per 
cent of them in sub-Saharan Africa. 
The dangers of an arrogant disregard for 
the complexities of ecosystems may take 
other forms than the destruction of virgin 
territory. It was, for example, attempts at 
reforestation in north-eastern America 
during the 19th century that led to the 
recent emergence of Lyme Disease, a poten- 
tially fatal bacterial infection affecting the 
joints, heart and brain, passed to humans via 
ticks carried by deer. 
The deer came into contact with 
humans following moves to rectify the 
impact of deforestation caused by inten- 
sive farming. Local governments launched 
preservation and reforestation programmes, 
and created a landscape attractive to both 
humans, deer—and Ixodes scapularis, a deer- 
borne tick which carries

burgdorferi, the bacterium responsible for 
Lyme Disease. 
With few natural predators in the newly- 
formed ecosystem, the deer flourished,and 
increasingly came into contact with humans, 
who were also flocking to the area, 
entranced by its apparently “natural” 
beauty. By the mid-1970s the first cases of 
the tick-borne disease were being noted 
among the inhabitants of Old Lyme, 
Connecticut. 
The same story has since been played 
out in Europe, Asia and Australasia, and 
tens of thousands of cases of Lyme Disease 
are reported worldwide each year. 
The return of TB, diphtheria, 
cholera and malaria 
The return of a number of old killer 
diseases once thought vanquished also 
serves to warn of the dangers of hubris and 
complacency. Tuberculosis, all but elimi- 
nated in the West following the advent of 
decent housing and powerful drugs, has 
been on the rise again since the mid-1980s 
with over three million killed each year 
worldwide.M any experts blame sloppy use 
of antibiotics by Western doctors, which 
has allowed mutant TB bacteria to survive 
and create resistant strains. In developing 
countries, the Aids epidemic—which has left 
tens of millions with no disease-fighting 
immune system—caused the number of 
TB cases to triple by the early 1990s. 
Outbreaks of diphtheria, another bac- 
terial disease of the lungs that especially 
targets young children, were virtually unk- 
nown in the last days of the former Soviet 
Union. Around 40,000 cases were reported 
in 1998, primarily among the poor and 
homeless who flocked to major cities follo- 
wing the collapse of the union, whose 
health-care systems had collapsed with it. 
In the early 1990s,cholera returned to 
haunt the Americas after a century of 
absence. Experts suspect this deadly bac- 
terial gut disease was imported from Asia in 
water flushed from the ballast tanks of 
ships. At the turn of the century, virtually 
no cases were known in the Americas; 
today, around 60,000 cases are being repor- 
ted each year. Globalization of commerce 
has, it seems, given us all too ready access to 
rather more than just exotic produce from 
faraway lands. 
Yet of all the resurgent diseases, it is 
malaria that provides the most poignant 
example of where ecological effects have 
shattered the dream of complete eradica- 
tion. The original optimism stemmed from 
the introduction of DDT into developing 
nations, to kill off the mosquitoes that carry 
the parasite responsible for malaria. 
1 2 The Unesco Courier - September 1999 
 
A cholera epidemic struck Peru in 1991. Above, family members at the graveside of a victim in Chimbote, 
north of Lima. 
Within ten years of its introduction after 
the Second World War,DDT had saved an 
estimated 5 million lives. In many countries, 
the impact was truly astonishing. In 1948 
Sri Lanka had 2.8 million cases of malaria; 
by 1963, following the introduction of 
DDT, the number had fallen to just 17. 
‘If coastal protection systems 
are not strengthened, 
a 50-centimetre rise in sea- 
level by 2100 would place 
80 million people in danger 
of being flooded more than 
once a year, compared to 
46 million people under 
present conditions. 
The displacement of so many 
people to already densely- 
populated delta areas and on 
populous island states would 
be bound to result in 
outbreaks of diseases like 
diphtheria and diarrhoea’ 
But by the late 1950s, evidence had 
emerged suggesting that DD Ts persistence 
in the soil and ability to creep up the food 
chain was having a deadly effect on some 
forms of wildlife. 
Although some experts are beginning to 
dispute the evidence—and especially its 
relevance to the Third World—DDT now 
faces a worldwide ban. T he mosquitoes 
have, however, gone from strength to 
strength. In Sri Lanka, the number of 
malaria cases rose from 17 back to 2.5 mil- 
lion within just five years of abandoning 
DDT. Worldwide, a staggering 400 million 
cases are being reported each year, along 
with almost two million deaths—90 per 
cent of which take place in Africa. 
In March 1999, Dr Gro Harlem 
Brundtland, the Director-General of WHO, 
singled out malaria as an example of a 
pandemic killer likely to benefit from ano- 
ther environmental threat: global warming, 
caused by man-made pollution trapping 
more of the sun’s heat in the atmosphere. 
Dr Brundtland pointed out that malaria 
is now being reported in locations at higher 
altitudes than in previous years, such as 
the mountain plateaus of Kenya. While 
admitting that there are likely to be various 
explanations for the change, Dr Brundt- 
land believes that one possibility is global 
warming. 
Rising sea-levels, caused largely by the 
thermal expansion of water driven by global 
warming, pose another threat, according to 
Dr Brundtland.“If coastal protection sys- 
tems are not strengthened, a 50-centimetre 
rise in sea-level by 2100 would place 80 
million people in danger of being flooded 
more than once a year, compared to 46 mil- 
lion people under present climate and sea- 
level conditions,” she says. “The displace- 
ment of so many people to already 
densely-populated delta areas and on popu- 
lous island states would be bound to result 
in outbreaks of diseases like diphtheria and 
diarrhoea, just to mention the most obvious 
ones. The rising water table along the coast 
could also encourage the release of patho-

gens into septic systems and waterways.” 
But while the effects of global warming 
on sea levels have yet to make themselves 
clear, fears are already growing that the sea 
may pose a more immediate—and insi- 
dious—threat to health. 
It stems from humankind’s insouciant 
use of the world’s oceans as gigantic sewers. 
A 1993 World Bank report estimated that 
around 30 per cent of humans have no 
other waste disposal system than streams, 
rivers—and the sea. 
For years a case of “out of sight, out of 
mind”, the dumping of so much waste in 
coastal waters is now starting to have an 
impact on health. Viruses from human 
diseases like polio and hepatitis have started 
to be found in shellfish, while toxic algal 
blooms—vast colonies of simple, pathogen- 
packed organisms that thrive on waste- 
derived nutrient—are becoming increa- 
singly frequent along coastlines. 
It is now becoming clear that the sea 
is acting like a gigantic cold-store for 
potentially deadly microbes like rotavirus, 
responsible for severe diarrhoea, and polio- 
virus—and sometimes they emerge to cause

WERE THE TEN PLAGUES OF EGYPT 
TRIGGERED BY AN ECOLOGICAL DISASTER? 
hile concern mounts over the risk of new 
diseases emerging from the seas and rivers, 
one leading expert believes that they may hold the 
key to an ancient catastrophe: the Ten Plagues that 
struck Egypt almost 3,300 years ago. 
According to the Book of Exodus in the Old 
Testament, Egypt was punished by God with a 
series of terrible plagues after refusing to release 
Moses and his followers from slavery. Sceptics 
have long rejected this ancient story as a myth, 
but according to Dr John Marr, former chief epi- 
demiologist for New York City, the story may well 
be based on fact. His research suggests that the 
biblical plagues may have been the result of an 
ecological disaster triggered by algal blooms, 
whose disease-spreading effect is now causing 
growing concern among scientists. 
The first of the Ten Plagues, in which the Nile 
reportedly turned blood-red and undrinkable, is 
strikingly reminiscent of the toxic “red tides” still 
caused by algae known as dinoflagellates in 
some parts of the world today. 
The resulting ecological imbalance caused by 
the death of fish could, says Dr Marr, have led to 
the second and fourth Plagues, of toads and their 
prey, flies. He also argues that a specific type of fly 
could explain the third and fifth plagues, of lice 
and livestock sickness: the midge-like creature   
Culicoides creates a louse-like irritation and trans- 
mits deadly viruses that kill animals in hours. 
Dr Marr says that another insect—the stable 
fly, which causes the bacterial disease glanders— 
is a good candidate for the sixth plague, of boils 
on man and beast. 
While the seventh and eighth plagues—hail 
storms and locusts—heed little explanation, the 
ninth plague, in which darkness fell for three days, 
may have been due to an outbreak of Rift Valley 
Fever, known to cause temporary blindness. 
But Dr Marr's most ingenious explanation 
concerns the final and most dramatic of all the 
Plagues: the Death of the First Born. He suggests it 
is a direct result of the Egyptians’ attempts to deal 
with the previous disasters. Hastily gathering what 
little crops had survived the hail and locusts, they 
may have stored the damp grain in silos. Under 
such conditions, the grain would go mouldy, and 
become coated with deadly mycotoxins. By bibli- 
cal tradition, the eldest child would have received 
double rations of contaminated grain—eading to 
widespread deaths among the first-born. 
If Dr Marr is correct—and other experts say 
the chain of events is plausible—the legend of the 
Plagues of Egypt may be a timely warning of how 
an ecological disaster can trigger devastating 
diseases that threaten civilization. [|   
coast. 
From deforestation to overpopulation, 
mass migrations to global transport, atmos- 
pheric to oceanic pollution: the reasons for 
which new and resurgent diseases can and 
do rise up to threaten humanity are legion. 
But lessons are being learned. Some are 
very basic and relatively simple to imple- 
ment, such as the one-time-only use of 
hypodermic needles. Others are equally 
obvious but far harder to achieve, such as 
making safe sex advice effective among 
those at risk from sexually-transmitted 
diseases like Aids. 
Early detection 
and rapid control measures 
As with any threat eternal vigilance for 
new disease outbreaks is now being seen as 
crucial. In its report on the outbreak of 
plague in India in August 1994, the All- 
India Institute of Medical Sciences warned 
that such re-emerging infectious diseases are 
a growing threat world-wide. “Early detec- 
tion and rapid implementation of effective 
control measures are essential,” the report’s 
authors said, and duly called for the setting 
up of national surveillance centres to act as 
early-warning systems. 
But the key message now emerging 
from many of the recent outbreaks is a 
blunt one: we must become far more 
thoughtful in our dealings with the envi- 
ronment and its delicate ecosystems. Long 
dismissed by some as just a pious desidera- 
tum, the cost of ignoring this simple mes- 
sage could be nothing less than the needless 
death of millions. [|

SCHOOLING IN TIMES 
OF STRIFE 
  
+ Mark Richmond 
From ‘school-in-a-box’ packages to counselling for children traumatized by fear and 
bereavement, education is playing a pivotal role in emergency relief operations 
When people are robbed of their 
homes, land and possessions by violent 
conflict, time and time again they ask 
for education. Over the past decade, from 
Somalia, Sudan and Rwanda to Bosnia and 
Kosovo, the United Nations has been 
confronted in all-too-close succession by 
what are commonly referred to as complex 
political emergencies. These crises invol- 
ving violent internal conflicts based on 
nationalist, local, ethnic and religious fac- 
tors, lead to huge internal and external 
population displacements,the looting and 
destruction of infrastructure,the targeting 
of civilian populations and the collapse of 
essential basic services. Their spread, par- 
ticularly in Africa, owes much to the break- 
down of the post-colonial settlements of the 
1950s and 1960s held in place somewhat 
artificially by superpower rivalries during 
the Cold War and associated ideological and 
geopolitical alignments. 
Warlords and bandits 
At the root of many such emergencies 
are escalating economic problems that have 
stimulated fierce inter-group struggles over 
access to and control over resources. In 
some cases, such as Somalia, violent internal 
conflicts have led to the collapse of the 
state,leaving ordinary citizens at the mercy 
of warlords and bandits. 
Assuring survival is of course the first 
task of any humanitarian operation.T his 
means providing basic services such as food, 
water,security, health care and shelter. But 
along with this,there is a steadily growing 
recognition of the need to introduce edu- 
cation in the early stages of humanitarian 
assistance, whether it be for refugees, inter- 
nally displaced persons or war-affected 
populations. This notion, of relatively recent 
origin, draws upon several justifications. 
One is the right to education itself, a right

displacement. T his right is enshrined in the

These developments have helped to gene- 
rate an international policy context condu- 
cive to the recognition not only of everyo- 
ne’s right to education but also of the 
obligation of all social actors—agencies, 
donors and NGOs—to translate that right 
into practice. 
At a practical level, educators and psy- 
chologists emphasize the importance for 
children’s development of minimizing the 
period during which learning is disrupted.

and help them to maintain a connection to 
their own socio-cultural environment. Whe- 
ther formal or non-formal, schooling can 
re-establish a sense of normalcy in an 
abnormal situation, and offer alienated youth 
an alternative to militias, crime, delinquency 
or drugs. In emergency situations, schools 
can be one of the most valuable channels for 
communicating messages about the envi- 
ronment, nutrition, mine awareness, cho- 
lera and Aids prevention. They are also places 
where themes such as human rights,peace 
and reconciliation can be broached. Such 
values constitute the underpinning of any 
subsequent programme of national recons- 
truction.Moreover, schools can often serve 
as centres for relief and rehabilitation pro- 
grammes for the community at large. Edu- 
cation can offer opportunities for paid 
employment and provide adults with a 
chance to play a role in their new, albeit 
temporary, surroundings. Last but not least, 
education symbolizes a commitment to the 
future, something more valuable than ever in 
the aftermath of violent conflict. 
While each crisis calls for a specific type 
of rapid educational response, the trage- 
dies of the past decade have given interna- 
tional agencies sufficient experience to draw 
up guidelines for conducting operations. 
Because it is impossible to get a schooling 
system into gear overnight, a phased 
approach enabling education to be intro- 
duced in the early stages of humanitarian 
assistance has become standard practice in 
emergency situations. 
After the collection of relevant educa- 
tional data (number of children, availability 
of teachers, etc.), a first phase brings chil- 
dren together for recreation activities— 
games,songs,listening to stories,and per- 
haps some simple lessons. During a second 
phase,non-formal schooling is established 
Education symbolizes 
a commitment to the future, 
something more valuable 
than ever in the aftermath 
of violent conflict 
on a systematic basis, often using a Tea- 
cher Emergency Package (TEP), which 
was first conceived by UNEsco for use in 
Somalia and has now been translated into 
several languages and culturally adapted 
to suit different populations. 
Although the concept is evolving, this 
“school-in-a-box” or “mobile classroom” is 
designed for approximately 80 refugee chil- 
dren of primary school age and aims to 
teach functional literacy and numeracy, 
rather than a formal graded curriculum 
with exams. A box typically includes slates, 
chalk, exercise books and pencils for stu- 
dents and a teacher’s bag containing cloth 
charts (alphabet, number and multiplica- 
tion),a guide outlining teaching methods, 
an attendance book and scrabble sets of 
small wooden blocks so that teachers can 
create language and number games. Desi- 
gned for a six-month learning span, T EPs 
act as a bridge between no schooling at all 
and a return to some form of regular schoo- 
ling. 
After this interim period, the third phase 
of near-normal schooling generally begins, 
based on curricula and textbooks (when 
available) from the country of origin. Another 
important aspect of emergency education 
programmes is the training of teachers to 
recognize symptoms of trauma in children 
who all too often arrive in their new makeshift 
schools after witnessing appalling levels of 
horror and violence. Psycho-social support 
programmes include counselling to help 
children come to terms with loss, bereave- 
ment, displacement and fear. 
This entire strategy is geared towards 
education for repatriation. The concept, 
first clearly articulated during the expe- 
rience of providing schooling to Mozam- 
bican refugees in Malawi in the 1980s,has 
gained growing acceptance in the 1990s,

generally too poor to absorb a large foreign

influx, need to be reassured that refugees 
will not settle there on a permanent basis. 
Hence the importance of using the mother 
tongue as the language of instruction, of tea- 
ching the curriculum of the country of 
origin (provided it has not been a source of 
oppression to the displaced population), 
and relying largely or wholly upon refugee 
teachers to staff the schools. 
The notion that education is geared 
towards repatriation adds a long-term 
dimension to the concept of emergency. It 
implies that planners think along a relief-to- 
development continuum that fits in with 
the development policy being designed for 
a country or sub-region. Unfortunately, 
this is not a linear process: countries such as 
Angola and Sudan have slipped in and out 
of war over recent decades, hampering 
efforts at national reconstruction. 
Community initiatives 
Broadly speaking, emergencies can be 
conceived as opportunities for educational 
transformation. This is why the planning of 
emergency education, especially when the 
task of rebuilding educational systems begins, 
must integrate an approach that combines 
top-down technical planning, which tends to 
characterize most postwar systems, with 
bottom-up community-oriented develop- 
ment initiatives. In emergency situations, 
parents,elders and professionals often play 
an important role in the setting-up and run- 
ning of schools, often developing a sense of 
ownership towards them. 
They should continue to have a voice in 
the planning of education after resettling in 
their country of origin. But traditional ave- 
nues through which financial support is 
channelled for reconstruction tend to 
exclude civil society. Donors go through 
the central state—often a highly weakened 
state with poor administrative and mana- 
gement capacity—to deliver funds, a 
method that tends to undermine more par- 
ticipatory approaches to educational plan- 
ning. The international community also 
needs to take stock of recent interventions 
and assess them in more thorough and cri- 
tical ways. The turnover of crises in the 
past decade has been such that sufficient 
time has not been devoted to actually lear- 
ning from the past. Rather than jump onto 
the next emergency, key practitioners 
involved in large-scale operations should 
be given the opportunity to take stock so 
that institutional knowledge can be accu- 
mulated and lessons learnt can inform 
future practices. Such reflection could also 
serve to put education higher up on the 
agenda when defining budgets and priori- 
ties for complex emergencies. nu

EMERGENCY EDUCATION: THE LESSONS 
AND CHALLENGES OF KOSOVO 
Te Kosovo crisis will be a major source of expe- 
rience and reflection regarding emergency edu- 
cation. The refugee situation in Albania and Mace- 
donia witnessed the application of many lessonsand 
practices derived from other emergencies: for 
example, the inclusion of education within the early 
stages of refugee assistance operations, the attempt 
to provide demarcated spaces within camps for 
recreational and educational activities, the priority 
focus on primary schooling, the provision of educa- 
tional kits, the attention given to psycho-social needs, 
the explicit adoption of a phased approach, and the 
use of refugee teachersin the camps (see article). 
Although international agencies and NGOs 
clicked into action when the crisis broke out, the 
provision of education was not without problems. 
In Macedonia, there was rapid turnover in the 
camps, with people often being transferred to other 
countries, making it very difficult to plan or to have 
a stable school population. Also, many Kosovar 
refugees were living with familiesin predominantly 
ethnic Albanian communities. This naturally placed 
a heavy burden on local school systems and 
required both the governmental authorities and 
external agencies to divide their attention between 
camp-based and community-based programmes. 
The burden of accommodating the influx of 
refugees, particularly as it placed heavy pressures 
on each country’s educational infrastructure, faci- 
lities and resources, led both Albania and Mace- 
donia to request substantial amounts of interna- 
tional assistance for their own educational systems. 
The limited and rapidly depleted capacity of the 
ministries of education contrasted sharply with the 
comparatively well-resourced situation of many 
external agencies and NGOs, a situation found in 
many humanitarian operations. Little attention is 
given to the collateral damage caused to resource- 
starved educational systems in host countries.   
With the war over and the refugees returning 
home comes the task of rebuilding the whole edu- 
cational system in Kosovo, the next logical phase of 
the emergency operation. According to a prelimi 
nary UNICEF survey of 394 schools, 43 per cent of 
them were completely destroyed or severely 
damaged. But the task is an acutely sensitive one. 
Prior to the attack on the ethnic Albanian popula- 
tion in March 1999, the official educational system 
had been run by Serbs while a parallel system for 
ethnic Albanian children had operated clandestinely 
for 10 years. Kosovar Albanians boycotted the 
formal system because they could no longer accept 
the ethno-ideological bias they detected within the 
curriculum. 
Technically, the United Nations Interim Admi- 
nistration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) has control 
over these matters and it is determined to pursue 
an even-handed approach which respectsthe inter- 
ests of both Serbsand ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. 
But establishing and maintaining a unified system 
will be far from easy. The UN peacekeeping force 
(KFOR) will be put to the test in protecting Serb chil- 
dren in integrated schools. As of August 1999, the 
question of who will pay teachers had not been 
resolved. Schools need to be repaired and equipped 
with furniture and toilets, children have to be pro- 
vided with textbooks and other basic materials and 
psychosocial services have to be made available. 
The certification of children’s learning in the parallel 
system hasto be agreed upon. In the longer run, the 
greatest challenge will be to restore quality to the 
system: for example, formal teacher training and 
regular professional development for Kosovar Alba- 
nian teachers was virtually impossible in the 1990s. 
The situation that exists today is a golden oppor- 
tunity for Kosovar education to broaden its vision 
and modernize itsteaching and learning practices.

new age unfolds as scientists put the 
A touches on a map of the human 
genome: our some 100,000 genes. 
Among the wealth of potential benefits, 
future parents will not only be able to screen 
foetuses for “defects”, but also may one day 
be able to correct a predisposition for diseases 
like breast cancer or even “enhance” certain 
behavioural or physical traits deemed 
desirable. 
Why shouldn’t parents make the most of 
technology to create the “child of their 
dreams’, beaming with health and potential? 
Dangerous fantasy lurks in this sunny hope, 
warn voices from bioethical and scientific 
communities, feminists and disabled rights 
groups. Will genetics spawn new forms of 
eugenics? An emotionally charged word laden 
with historical connotations, eugenics defies 
easy definition. Yet the word’s very force 
demands reflection on the dark side of 
attempts to genetically “improve” the human 
species. 
The articles in this section illustrate the 
ways in which societal pressures can exert 
a coercive force on reproductive decision- 
making. In the United States, for example, 
we see commercial interests driving parents’ 
conceptions of their children. Population 
pressures in China fire debate over a 
controversial law to limit the birth of 
handicapped people, while cultural 
discrimination against girls drives parents in 
India to extremes to produce sons. 
The apprehensions surrounding human 
cloning are clearly seen in Dolly’s birthplace, 
the United Kingdom. Meanwhile the shadow 
of the past leads Germany to tread softly in 
the field of biotechnology. Finally, we take a 
broad look at the ethical issues raised by 
current disparities in international access to 
the fruits of genetic research.

to decode our biological “ego”. Through the 
Human Genome Project, thousands of resear- 
chers from about 50 countries are putting the final 
touches to a map identifying all of our roughly 
100,000 genes. T his information will open the way 
to developing a large number of innovative treat- 
ments and techniques to cure and prevent disea- 
se. 
At the beginning of this “genetic age”, we can 
expect an extensive battery of DN A tests which 
prospective parents will use to gain an extraordi- 
nary picture of their embryo’s genetic make-up. 
These tests may be used in utero to reassure parents 
as to the health of their child-to-be. On the other 
hand, signs of disease or handicap might also lead 
to the decision to abort. T his same battery of DN A 
tests will also be used for preimplantation diagnosis, 
in which prospective parents sift through and then 
select in vitro (“test tube”) a fertilized egg (or eggs) 
before implantation in a woman’s womb. Both of 
these screening approaches are part of “genetic 
counselling”, a term used to describe a very sen- 
n about three years, we should have the keys 
      ! 
sitive process in which people basically decide what 
kinds of individuals are born. We already see this 
selection process at work with health policies in 
some countries encouraging women to take pre- 
natal tests for Down’s Syndrome. 
In the next phase of genetic research, geneti- 
cists will develop a range of treatments for genetic 
disorders, including gene therapy, now just in their 
very early stages. T his research is raising wild hopes, 
from the ability to cure certain cancers to comba- 
ting the 4,000 to 5,000 genetic illnesses identified 
so far. Some geneticists are already dreaming of 
germ-line therapy in which genetic changes are 
passed along to future generations. Indeed scien- 
tists like American Lee Silver foresee the rise of a 
new discipline: “reprogenetics” which will com- 
bine cloning and genetic engineering techniques 
to one day “enhance” in vitro embryos (pp. 27- 
28). Enhancement could take a variety of forms: 
from improving resistance to disease to modifying 
behavioural or physical traits with a view to pro- 
ducing the “child of parents’ dreams”.

For now, these scenarios are not only techni- 
cally impossible but legally prohibited: reproduc- 
tive cloning of humans (pp. 32-33) and germ-line 
therapy are forbidden. But they are warning signs 
for those who fear that medicine will be used as a 
way of selecting and controlling “good” and “bad” 
genes. “We are on the verge of anew eugenic age,” 
warn the serried ranks of philosophers,priests, 
human rights campaigners and anti-abortion 
groups. T heir cry has sparked a major bioethical 
debate on two fronts. The first revolves around the 
very definition of eugenics (see glossary), an emo- 
tionally charged word closely associated with the 
horrors of Nazism (pp. 22-23). Secondly, will 
advances in genetics give rise to new forms of euge- 
nics? 
Asian countries (pp. 30-31) and Arab Gulf states 
already have laws denying the disabled the right to 
be born. According to Noélle Lenoir, former pre- 
sident of UNESCO’s International Bioethics Com- 
mittee (IBC), “in societies already plagued by dis- 
crimination, genetics could become another 
mstrument of exclusion.” Can any society claim 
that it is untainted by this social ill? Certainly not 
those which deem girls inferior (p. 29). 
What is normality? 
The debate over eugenics reminds us that there 
is no such thing as a “perfect”’baby. The human 
gene pool cannot be “cleaned” up because, as 
scientists point out, new genetic anomalies deve- 
lop with each generation. Besides, genetic engi- 
neering is an inherently risky endeavour because 
it is impossible to predict which genes our des- 
cendants may need in the future. 
A host of fundamental ethical questions also 
arise. Tests to detect late onset diseases raise the 
problem of defining a life worth living. A genetic 
disease like “Huntington’s chorea usually deve- 
lops between the ages of 38 and 45,” says French 
geneticist and bioethicist Axel Kahn. “Yet think of 
all the great artists and musicians who died befo- 
re reaching 40. We see here the difficulty in saying 
that a life isn’t worth living if it ends or suddenly 
deteriorates at a certain age.” 
Another thorny question lies in defining “nor- 
mality”. Imagine the discrimination directed 
towards handicapped people in a society accusto- 
med to the idea of eliminating genetic “defects”? 
Many bioethicists such as IBC president Ryuichi 
Ida also see grave dangers potentially arising from 
the “genetic enhancement” of embryos. To begin 
with, new inequalities would develop between those 
who could afford such “treatment” and those lac- 
king access to it (pp. 27-28). 
We must also ask whether parents have the right 
to “design” the child of their dreams?“ A child is 
a separate and complete individual who cannot be 
reduced to the expectations of his or her parents,” 
says Kahn. “Being a parent is supposed to be about 
loving a child as he or she is. Parenting is not about 
requiring a child to be as you would like him or her 
to be. In this respect, children are in danger.” 
Bioethics: the lure of the perfect child 
Yet brandishing the spectre of eugenics is sim- 
plistic and dangerous, insist many scientists, bio- 
technology executives,bioethicists, and feminists. 
Furthermore,anti-abortion groups might mani- 
pulate the debate to curtail women's hard-won 
rights to control their own fertility (pp. 22-23). 
There may also be a positive side to “laissez 
faire” or “utopian”eugenics—terms which are 
sparking a flurry of discussion in affluent Western 
countries. Many bioethicists and scientists main- 
tain that these new forms of eugenics simply des- 
cribe the choices individuals—not the state or the 
community—will be able to make about the kind 
of children they want to bring into the world .But 
how will commercial pressures and interests drive 
these decisions? “With sufficient advertising, the 
biotechnology market will make parents feel guil- 
ty if they don't consume” all the genetic tests and 
services available,says Lori Andrews, an Ameri- 
can legal expert in the field (pp. 28-29).

and the will to broaden

As geneticists point out, science and medicine 
have always advanced by violating social taboos. 
Scientists should not be penalized for the ways in 
which society uses their discoveries. The ethical 
path lies in giving people time to reflect on the 
consequences of scientific progress. 
“Individuals everywhere are faced with more 
and more ethical dilemmas,” says Lenoir. “In some 
ways, it’s easier when you live in an authoritarian 
or religious society. The rules are laid out before 
you (pp. 24-26). But in culturally diverse and secu- 
lar societies, where people have access to information 
and can stand up for their rights it’s much harder to set 
guidelines. T his is what gave birth to bioethics.” u

cience of “improving” the gene pool—has 
been equated with the horrors of Nazism. 
While German geneticists such as Benno Miiller 
Hill have sought to confront the scientific commu- 
nity’s complicity with the Nazis, systematic scrutiny 
of eugenic policies in other countries has long been 
neglected. 
Historians have recently filled the gap to offer a 
clear, if depressing, picture of cultural and poli- 
tical support for eugenics in North America and in 
many European countries from the start of the 
20th century to the 1970s. Industrial barons and 
political elites had predictably little sympathy for the 
socially disadvantaged who were the targets of 
eugenic policies. Surprisingly, eugenics also attracted 
considerable interest among welfare reformers, 
Marxist and socialist intellectuals as well as feminists 
convinced that science should help the state in fos- 
tering a genetically “fit”population. Some favoured 
negative eugenics, seeking to limit the production 
of the “unfit” ;others opted for positive eugenics to 
encourage the “fit”to have more children. 
Once the horrors of Nazism were widely known, 
many countries were careful to avoid using the 
word eugenics even though they continued to prac- 
tice it. These “population policies” mostly took the 
form of the compulsory sterilization of “feeble 
minded” women. Racism led to African American 
women being grossly over-represented among the 
60,000 people forcibly sterilized in several American 
states from 1907 to 1960. In Scandinavia,political 
leaders and geneticists adopted state policies for 
compulsory sterilization out of concern that the 
emerging welfare state would encourage the “unfit” 
to reproduce and so reduce the quality of the 
national stock. In Sweden alone, 63,000 people, 90 
per cent of them women, were sterilized between 
1934 and 1975.Norway, a much smaller country, 
sterilized 48,000 in the same period. By contrast, 
British and Dutch geneticists and policy-makers 
adopted voluntary sterilization together with the 
mass institutionalization and segregation of the 
“feeble-minded”. 
The silence surrounding these painful chapters in 
history is not surprising. It takes a dour courage to 
unearth the horrors of any nation’s past. In Sweden, 
for example, the press first sparked public outrage over 
F: almost half a century eugenics—literally the 
S 
    
   
eugenics in the 1970s. Yet it wasn’t until 1996 that the 
government agreed to compensate the women who 
suffered. Today’s renewed interest in the past stems 
from founders of the Human Genome Project 
(HGP). From the project’s conception in 1985, lea- 
ding scientists like James Watson, co-discoverer of the 
structure of DN A, saw the need publicly to confront 
this sinister past to prevent the shadow of the old state- 
controlled eugenics from impeding the progress of the 
HGP. As a result, they set aside part of the three-bil- 
lion-dollar research budget to study not just the past 
but the social, legal and ethical implications of cur- 
rent research. Many scientists are acutely aware that 
new forms of eugenics risk arising with new deve- 
lopments in the field of genetics. 
Fears of growing stigmas 
Today geneticists are generally very careful to 
avoid any links to state-controlled eugenics by adop- 
ting a new approach with a Janus-like posture. 
Facing the patient—the would-be parent—they 
provide informed choice about DN A testing. Facing 
the state, they promise that fewer disabled chil- 
dren will be born. However, as more foetuses are 
screened for a growing range of conditions, many 
voices within the disability movements argue that 
“testing” amounts to searching for the “abnormal”. 
This “search” steadily reduces our notions of what 
it is to be “normal”, and this, activists say, will 
intensify the stigmatization of all disabled people. 
Some activists have come close to an absolutist 
opposition to all DNA testing to prevent women 
from aborting so-called “abnormal” foetuses. T his 
position has predictably raised serious concern in the

global movement of women struggling to control 
their own fertility. Indeed, the disability movement 
can look like an ally of pro-life groups. Yet it is pos- 
sible, as disabled feminist groups have shown, to 
share the disability movement’s concerns and still 
defend women’s reproductive rights. 
The “genetically approved” 
To begin with, it is crucial to recognize that 
despite the proliferation of DNA tests—each 
patented and profit-yielding—genetics has so far 
failed to fulfill its vaunted promises of gene therapy. 
Doctors are screening for conditions and disorders 
which they cannot treat. So abortion is often pre- 
sented as treatment. Meanwhile a good mother-to- 
be is expected to accept every test she can either 
afford or the state provides. For many bioethicists, 
feminists and disabled rights activists,this prolife- 
ration of DNA tests opens the way to “consumer 
eugenics” which in the guise of offering greater 
reproductive choices in practice applies pressure to 
select the “genetically approved”. 
To assure truly free reproductive decision- 
making, it is crucial to ask: who benefits from the 
tests—individuals or companies selling them? For 
most women—not all—a DN A test which can accu- 
rately indicate a terrible genetic disorder in the 
foetus enhances, even if sadly, her ethical choices. 
But what about the possible proliferation of DNA 
tests for relatively minor genetic disorders, like 
  
Timeline 
Bioethics: the lure of the perfect child 
deafness or restricted stature? 
Another major ethical issue lurks in the proli- 
feration of DNA testing: by focusing on genetic 
weaknesses, we may neglect environmental factors, 
like poverty. American sociologist Troy Duster 
points out that the most effective way—in both 
medical and economic terms—to promote the birth 
of healthy newborns lies in helping poor women eat 
properly during pregnancy. In the state of Cali- 
fornia, more infants suffer from the serious and 
often fatal health problems caused by low birth 
weight than by genetic disease. For Duster, the 
state decision to invest in DNA testing instead of 
anti-poverty programmes opens the “backdoor to 
eugenics” with painful implications in view of the 
fact that African Americans are massively over- 
represented among the poor. 
How can we better manage this powerful bio- 
technology? We can begin by stimulating an 
informed debate about the possibilities and limits 
of DNA testing. The public needs a solid informa- 
tion base to take an active part in developing sen- 
sitive and effective regulatory systems. Screaming 
headlines announcing “designer babies” in which 
fantasy parents choose the height, intelligence, 
looks and behaviour of their future offspring will do 
little to help us resolve thorny ethical questions 
arising.Instead, we might begin by learning from the 
two countries where the public trusts its government 
most when it comes to biotechnology, Denmark and 
the Netherlands. It is not by chance that they have 
done the most to manage these technologies demo- 
cratically. nu

Catholics, Protestants, Buddhists, Muslims and Jews bring an array of responses 
to the bioethical questions posed by genetic technologies.

2 4 The Unesco Courier - September 1999 
nce upon a time Christian theologians 
0 argued about the sex of angels. Nowadays 
they argue about the soul of the human 
embryo in a debate that concerns creatures of 
flesh and blood and spills way beyond Chris- 
tianity. 
“Although religious practice may be decli- 
ning,” says French geneticist and Member of Par- 
liament Jean-Francois Mattei, “the metaphysical 
 
issue is still at the core of the questions raised 
about genetic engineering, either by tradition, 
culture or duty” 
Should a person have recourse to prenatal 
screening and consider having an abortion if a 
serious genetic defect is discovered? Should 
research on embryos, gene therapy and cloning 
be allowed? 
All the “religions of the Book” (Christianity, 
Judaism and Islam) believe that the answers to 
these questions largely depend on the status of 
the embryo. The frontier between “good” and 
“bad” genetic engineering depends on whether 
or not the embryo is considered to be “animate”. 
An “opposition front” 
“Ifthe embryo has a soul,then it is endowed 
with a human as well as a biological life and any 
attack on its integrity is seen as a crime,” says 
French geneticist René Frydman. “If it is inani- 
mate, the prohibition remains—God-given life 
should be respected—but the offence is less 
serious.” 
The Catholic Church is in many respects a 
special case. For a start, it has a single “magis- 
terium” or teaching authority, whereas other reli- 
gions have a more familiar approach, such as dis- 
cussions with a rabbi (Jews), priest (Orthodox 
Christians) or master (Buddhists). Other reli- 
gions also have various branches (reformed and 
orthodox Jews,many broad streams of Buddhism) 
or schools of jurisprudence (M alikite,H anafite, 
Shafi’ite and Hanbalite among Sunni Muslims, 
for example). Most important of all, while all the 
major religions generally believe human life and 
dignity should be respected, the Church of Rome 
is the only religion that considers the embryo “as 
a human being from the moment of conception”, 
and it sticks firmly to this doctrine. 
Pope John Paul II has repeated it several times, 
notably in the encyclicals Veritatis S plendor (1993) 
and Evangelium Vitae (1995). These have resul- 
ted in a number of prohibitions: “no” to prena- 
tal screening if it it is done with the thought of a 
possible abortion and “no” to most research and 
therapy on embryos. T he Vatican is also against 
both reproductive and therapeutic cloning on the 
grounds that it violates the “unified totality” of

Man has been 
truly termed a 
“microcosm”, 
or little world in 
himself, and 
the structure of 
his body should be 
studied not only by 
those who wish to 
become doctors, 
but by those who wish 
to attain to 
a more intimate 
knowledge of God.

the human person and the sacred link between 
sexuality and procreation. 
The positions of Orthodox Christians are very 
close to those of the Vatican. But the “opposition 
front”to genetic technologies is limited to these 
two groups. For Islam and Judaism, the impor- 
tant principles are the moment when the embryo 
acquires a life of its own and respect for descen- 
dance. The Koran says in Surat 23: “And cer- 
tainly We created man of an extract of clay, Then 
We made him a small seed in a firm resting-place, 
Then we made the seed a clot, then we made the 
clot a lump of flesh, then We made (in) the lump 
of flesh bones, then We clothed the bones with 
flesh, then We caused it to grow into another crea- 
tion.” 
But some Muslims believe it is 40 days befo- 
re the soul (ruh) enters the embryo, while others 
believe it is 120. At the same time, while prena- 
tal screening is accepted,there is argument over 
abortion. H’mida Ennaifer, of the Higher Insti- 
tute of Theology in Tunis,says “Islamic jurists all 
condemn abortion after the foetus has received 
the breath of life. Some Malekites condemn it 
even when the child is less than 40 days old while 
other schools of thought allow it during the first 
four months of pregnancy.” 
Islam also allows gene therapy on the human 
body, but in general it proscribes the modifica-

tion of germ-cells and bans anything which denies 
the notion of divine creation, starting with clo- 
ning. However, a minority of jurists regard clo- 
ning as sometimes preferable to “genetic adulte- 
ry” because it respects the line of descent by 
avoiding a situation where a sterile couple uses 
sperm or eggs from a donor in artificial insemi- 
nation. 
Jews cite the Bible and the Talmud. When the 
Talmud reports that during the miraculous cros- 
sing of the Red Sea by the Israelites (Exodus, 
chapter 15), even the unborn children in their 
mothers’ wombs praised God,it comments that 
“if they could praise the glory of God, it means 
they have a soul and a conscience.” T his comes 
about after the 40th day, the Talmud says. Until 
then,the embryo is “only water”.So to obey the 
halakha (Jewish Law), it is preferable to carry out 
prenatal screening before the 40th day. After that, 
abortion is not allowed unless the mother’s life is 
in danger. In practice, it all depends on what the 
rabbis say. Some hold that if the mother has a ner- 
vous breakdown when she learns she is carrying 
a child with an incurable condition, abortion is 
permissible, even after the 40-day limit. Other 
rabbis are a lot stricter. 
Jews allow experiments with embryos, espe- 
cially if they have no chance of surviving.Judaism 
also does not rule out cloning, says French theo- » 
  
orthodox Jews, marriages are made between 
families as much as between individuals, on the 
basis of mutual interests. “ Intelligence and scho- 
larship are highly valued, naturally, but back- 
ground, social position, wealth and health are also 
important,” says Israeli rabbi Yigal Bezalel Sha- 
fran. 
Families known to be genetic carriers of fatal 
diseases are stigmatized,because in this strictly 
observant community abortion is generally for- 
bidden unless the mother’slife is endangered. Yet 
Ashkenazi Jew s (of Eastern European origin) have 
the highest risk of Tay-Sachs, a genetic disease 
causing dementia and death in childhood. The risk 
of carrying the disease can run as high as four per 
cent for the Ashkenazi (one in 25) compared to 
0.2 per cent for non-Jews and Sephardic Jews (of 
Mediterranean origin). 
In 1983 a rabbi and a doctor in New York crea- 
ted Dor Yeshorim, a non-profit organization which 
provides Ashkenazi with pre-marital genetic tests 
to avoid the betrothal of two carriers of a fatal or 
severely debilitating genetic disorder. About 
70,000 people in New York, Israel and the United 
gramme started in Israel in 1986,and since then 
not a single Tay-Sachs child has been born in the 
ultra-orthodox Ashkenazi community. It works 
because both the spiritual leaders and the com- 
munity agree with its principles, practices and 
results. 
Yet some medical geneticists oppose the pro- 
gramme on the grounds that it snubs Western 
medicine's standard of privacy and the individual's 
“right to know” because the test results are retur- 
ned to the “ more objective and less emotionally 
involved” Dor Yeshorim rabbi, and not to the indi- 
viduals tested. The prospective couple isinformed 
only if both members are carriers, in which case 
they usually seek other partners. If just one of the 
pair is a carrier, no one is told and the marriage 
plans proceed. 
There may be a lesson here for other cultures 
and even for Western science. As genetic scree- 
ning tests are increasingly available, mostly for 
diseases with no cure, people may have to bear 
what Rabbi Shafran calls“ an emotional burden of 
know ledge that can only cause distress” . This bur- 
den might be eased if the right to knowledge is 
 
vested in their social group, in other words, if indi- 
viduals choose the “right not to know”. [|

### 117051: Religion, genetics and the embryo

» logian and jurist Raphaél Brai. “If cloning is done 
for therapeutic reasons, the matter has to be dis- 
cussed with other people. Several religious notions 
clash at this point. For example, the oneness of 
the human person and the duty to heal oneself.” 
But cloning for reproductive reasons is not allo- 
wed, with few exceptions. 
Protestant Christians are generally even more 
open to advances in genetics. They stress free will 
and regard each case on its merits,leaving a deci- 
sion to the couple involved.“Some allow prena- 
tal screening followed by an abortion if the woman 
so decides,” says Carlos de Sola, head of the bioe- 
thics unit of the Council of Europe, which has 
arranged discussions between religious autho- 
rities. “Some people even endorse choosing the 
sex of a future child through sperm selection, 
so as to create a family containing both boys and 
girls.” Protestants approve of research using 
embryos as long as it is strictly supervised. T hey 
do not rule out cloning either, though they reject 
cloning for profit or for eugenic reasons. 
Buddhists are even less dogmatic because they 
believe all truth is relative. A French expert in 
Buddhism, Raphaél Liogier, notes that “the only 
ethical limit is suffering, for Buddha is primarily a 
healer.” The Dalai Lama, leader of Tibet’s Buddhists, 
says what mainly has to be taken into account are 
“the good effects and bad effects of genetic engi- 
neering.” He agrees that it can be used to “improve 
the human body—the brain,for example.” 
“The body is only a vehicle for karma [the ethi- 
cal consequences of a person’s actions that deter- 
mine their destiny in their next incarnation],” says 
Liogier. “If the body has been genetically altered or 
cloned, it’s really not very important. Abortion howe- 
ver is frowned on because it damages karma.” 
But again, everything is relative and the main 
concern is to avoid pain. The Dalai Lama says “abor- 
tion is allowed when a pregnant woman might die 
if she gave birth or bear a severely handicapped child.” 
T he range of answers religions give to bioethi- 
cal questions is very varied and constantly changing, 
except for the rigid doctrine of the Vatican and the 
inflexibility of fundamentalists in all religions. Faced 
with problems which go to the origin and meaning 
of life itself, says Frydman, “religious opinions are 
probably a big help because they recall humanity’s 
root values without trying to impose them and are a 
forum for discussion,not a body of dogma.” [|

This is not an exercise in Hollywood screen- 
writing. These scenarios emerge from our current 
base of scientific and technological knowledge. 
Since the 1980s, genetic engineering has been suc- 
cessfully practised with mice, cows, sheep and pigs. It 
hasn’t yet been applied to human beings simply because

the most basic technique for adding genes to embryos 
has a success rate of only 50 per cent at best. And for 
the even more complicated task of altering genes to 
cure disease, the odds are about a million to one. 
But with cloning, the entire equation changes. 
You can now take a cell from a fertilized egg of just a 
few days and then clone it to make millions of copies 
which could then be engineered by, for example, 
injecting foreign DNA through a microscopic 
needle. T hanks to the “Wilmut technique” (see page 
21), the scientist can then take a properly enginee- 
red cell’s nucleus and insert it into a fresh egg which 
is placed in the mother’s womb. 
This is just one of many approaches now being 
Bioethics: the lure of the perfect child 
developed in laboratories. By using one or a combi- 
nation of them, genetic engineering of human embryos 
will be safe and efficient by the middle of the 21st cen- 
tury. We will face the ultimate frontier in medicine and 
philosophy—the power to change the nature of the 
human species. 
Genetic engineering will begin in a thoroughly 
acceptable manner, by treating severe childhood 
diseases like cystic fibrosis. Services will then steadily 
expand in two distinct phases. In the first, parents will 
give their children genes that others naturally have. For 
example, they will incorporate within their embryos the 
genes which make some people naturally resistant to 
certain forms of cancer or HIV infection (about one 
per cent of the American male population has a gene 
making them immune to HIV infection). At the same 
time, they may reverse predisposition to conditions like 
obesity or alcoholism and diseases like diabetes. 
Geneticists will then focus on the mind and senses. 
To begin with, doctors will replace or alter genes linked 
to mental diseases and antisocial behaviour like 
extreme aggression. As technology improves and 
spreads, parents will have the choice of enhancing 
artistic potential, for example, by heightening visual 
or auditory acuity. With better understanding of the 
human brain, we will enhance cognitive abilities by, 
for example, strengthening the gene responsible for 
converting short term memory into long term 
memory. T his is now being done in mice. 
All of these services involve altering or adding genes 
which already exist in the human genome. However, 
in the second phase of genetic engineering, we will 
actually introduce new genes into the genome. 
Humans might develop night vision by gene-transfers 
from bats or entirely new traits like the ability to deci- 
pher radio waves. Obviously, this kind of engineering 
will take a great deal of time to develop because of the 
complexity and risks involved. We cannot introduce a 
gene into the human genome without being certain 
that it won’t cause any harm. 
One way or another, we will see an exponential rise 
in the number and variety of possible genetic exten- 
sions—like the additions to computer operating sys- 
tems that occurred during the 1980s and 1990s. 
Extensions that were once unimaginable will become 
indispensable . . . to those parents who can afford 
them. [|

Americans have a heart-felt fetish for doingeverything

Welcome to the world of laissez faire eugenics,

### 117054: The Dangers of laissez faire

» then it’s hard to criticize the goal of trying to biolo- 
gically make your child better.” 
Not so for the philosopher who first coined the 
term laissez faire eugenics, Philip Kitcher of C olum- 
bia University. “We're putting the rat race into the 
womb,” he says. “I used to be more optimistic,” thin- 
king that education and support for the disabled would 
lead to a genetic utopia free of discrimination.“But 
now I see the root of the problem goes deep into capi- 
talist society with the pressure to compete,” says Kit- 
cher. “Parents with the resources will feel pressured 
to make sure that their children have ‘the right gene- 
tic stuff.” 
Picking and choosing 
‘desirable’ traits 
As geneticists develop new DNA tests and tech- 
niques to screen and perhaps one day enhance 
embryos, “parents will be torn between the desire to 
do the best they can for their child and their percep- 
tion of the prejudices and inequalities surrounding 
them,” says Kitcher. Imagine a couple sorting through 
a batch of in-vitro fertilized eggs. Perhaps scientists 
will find that there are certain genes which correlate 
with same sex preference. “Then we can expect some 
parents to say, ‘we’re not prejudiced but it’s awfully 
hard for a lesbian daughter to make it in our society. 
...” Genetic testing, says Kitcher, will be used to weed 
out “undesirables” the way amniocentesis is now used 
in China and India for sex-selection. T his laissez faire 
eugenics will creep up on society as people increa- 
singly look to genetics to relieve—not resolve—pro- 
blems caused by social situations. Skin colour could 
be considered a social handicap, in which case an Afro- 
American couple might seek to produce a white baby. 
While doctors might refuse the request, it begs the 
question as to whether or not the government has a 
role in regulating the selection and, perhaps, one day, 
the enhancement of embryos. 
Legal regulation “isnot likely to happen and I'm 
not sure that it should,” says Caplan. In the United 
States, “personal choice is believed to be the best ans- 
wer to questions of conception and reproduction,” he 
says, explaining that this commitment to privacy has 
kept abortion legal. If government began regulating 
the conditions in which children are born,anti-abor- 
tion groups might find a way of curtailing women’s 
rights to control their fertility. Besides,says Caplan, 
how can government begin limiting what parents bio- 
logically offer their children when they have virtual- 
ly free rein in environmental matters such as reli- 
gion and education? Caplan also points out that 
genetically enhancing an embryo will not be the same 
as “programming” a child. A strict religious upbrin- 
ging may mould a child far more than enhanced ath- 
letic ability, for example. Besides, is there anything 
wrong with giving a child improved memory? 
The problem, says Kitcher, lies in the cumulative 
effects of individuals’ decisions. A more homogeneous 
society will emerge as parents select some traits over 
others. This won't lead to a Hollywoodesque scena- 
rio of a nation dominated by chubby blond cherubs 
with blue eyes. Instead, Kitcher warns that the focus

on picking and choosing “desirable” traits may reduce 
respect for diversity, reinforce racism and widen the gap 
between those who can and those who cannot afford the 
latest genetic services. 
Ethically this would be wrong, says Caplan, but “there 
is no escaping it.” Restricting individual liberty for the 
common good is not the “American way”.“ We rely on 
the wisdom of individual choice to get to the greater bene- 
fit—not some notion of an agreed upon collective bene- 
fit,” says Caplan. 
Yet there may be some legislative room for manoeuvre, 
says Lori Andrews, director of the Institute of Science, 
Law and Technology in Chicago. Constitutional protec- 
tions prevent the government from interfering in a cou- 
ple’s decision to have or not have a baby, says Andrews. 
This does not guarantee absolute freedom in deciding 
what kind of child to have or under what conditions. 
A major stumbling block to regulation lies in the raging 
conflict between anti-abortion groups and the scientific 
community over embryo research. Extreme positions on 
both sides have led to a “legislative vacuum”, says Andrews, 
leaving the private sector to pursue the research beyond 
the scrutiny of federal review boards. As it stands now, the 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is supposed to 
decide which genetic tests and treatments are available to 
consumers. T he problem, says Andrews, is that FD A deci- 
sions are based on safety and efficacy—ethical conside- 
rations and public debate are not part of the equation. 
Marketing campaigns 
The legislative vacuum leaves a lot of responsibility 
on the doorstep of the medical community. Enormous 
profits stand to be made in the emerging field of repro- 
ductive genetic services. M arketing campaigns will focus 
on the “perfect baby” to convince parents that their chil- 
dren-to-be require “the best money can offer” in prena- 
tal diagnoses and enhancement. With these commercial 
pressures, parents will need medical and ethical guidan- 
ce to evaluate the products. 
Yet “the medical profession has gotten little beyond 
identifying the problems,” says Dr. Botkin of the Uni- 
versity of Utah. Doctors are trying to adopt a “non-direc- 
tive” approach when revealing the results of prenatal tests. 
But as Botkin points out, reproductive decision-making 
begins with the choice of tests taken. Professional stan- 
dards traditionally reflect the minimum a doctor should 
do in particular circumstances. As genetics develops,doc- 
tors will need to consider the maximum.Yet they alone 
cannot set the limits which, Botkin says, require a broad 
social dialogue. 
The need for public debate is perhaps the one point 
on which everyone agrees. While bioethicists like Caplan 
focus on “good parenting”, Kitcher goes a step further. 
“When we begin talking about how to groom human 
beings from the womb on, something has gone awfully 
wrong in our society,” he says. “Part of the solution lies in 
legislation but part lies in modifying the culture of the 
affluent society. We are living in a time of the self-profes- 
sed triumph of capitalism. As a philosopher, I am incli- 
ned to ask: is this competition good for us and our chil- 
dren?’ u

ness in India: ultrasound. Using sound waves to 
produce images of foetuses,this diagnostic tool 
1s acommon part of prenatal care. But in India, adver- 
tisements for ultrasound carry a hidden message: doc- 
tors will use the tool to reveal the sex of the unborn,ope- 
ning the way to abort “negative” results, meaning in 
effect females. 
Clinics have resorted to this disguised advertising 
since a law enacted in 1996 banned the use of prenatal tes- 
ting for sex selection. Doctors are only allowed to test foe- 
tuses for genetic and congenital abnormalities or disease. 
In principle, they can be prosecuted for giving the faintest 
hint as to the sex of a foetus. 
Yet the law looks better on paper than in practice, 
admits S.C. Srivastava, Policy Director of the central 
government Health Ministry. Registration of clinics 
has been slow and there has not been a single prose- 
cution despite official acknowledgment of widespread 
abuse. One reason is that abortion up to the 20th week 
of pregnancy is legal,even though sex selection is not. 
It is hard to prove an abortion is done for sex selection.

Female foeticide 
Sex determination has been rampant in India since the 
1970s when doctors began misusing amniocentesis (ana- 
lysis of uterine fluid). A 1985 survey in Bombay, for 
example, revealed that 90 per cent of amniocentesis 
centres were involved in sex determination, with nearly 96 
per cent of female foetuses aborted. Today, ultrasound is 
the preferred method, with some 1,500 clinics operating 
in Punjab alone, a northern state of over 20 million people 
where India’s first sex determination clinic was set up. The 
only thing the law seems to have done 1s to raise doctors’ 
fees from about $10 to $30 a session to compensate for the 
risk of criminal prosecution. The situation will even get 
worse with a new wave of ultrasound units, says Dr. Sha-

tests 1s effective in sex determination in the 16th to 18th 
weeks of a pregnancy. Today, abdominal ultrasound ima- 
ging can tell the sex of a foetus with 90 per cent accuracy 
at 14 weeks. More advanced trans-vaginal ultrasound— 
widely-used in Delhi and spreading elsewhere—has even 
greater accuracy at 12 weeks. Thus female feeticide is 
now possible in the first trimester when abortion is less

complicated and there is less suspicion of sex selection, says 
Dr. Jain. 
   
The heart of the problem is traditional atti- 
tudes towards females, insists Dr. Mira Shiva of the 
Voluntary Health Association of India in New 
Delhi.Daughters are seen as an expense particularly 
because of the dowries families pay to marry them 
off. Under such circumstances, the law banning sex 
selection is a “non-starter,” says Dr. Shiva. 
Given this value system, how would people 
respond to new genetic technologies to pre-select 
the sex of embryos? An American fertility institute 
recently caused a stir with a new technique, Micro- 
Sort, which separates sperm bearing X-chromo- 
somes (producing females) from those with Y-chro- 
mosomes (producing males).Doctors report a 93 
per cent success rate for producing girls and 73 per 
cent for boys. The current $5,000 cost of such a pro- 
cedure is expected to fall and doctors believe it is 
only a matter of time before the new sex pre-deter- 
mination technique hits India. 
“I can easily provide the service within months,” 
says Dr. Anoop Kumar Gupta of Delhi IVF and 
Fertility Clinic. “If I do, I will have hundreds of 
clients queuing outside.” Some doctors in India, 
like Dr. T.C. Kumar of Hope Infertility Clinic in 
Bangalore, believe the pre-determination technique 
would stem female feeticide. “The ethical choice lies 
between the prevention, and the perpetuation of feeti- 
cide,infanticide and homicide of females,” says Dr. 
Kumar. “Social change is a long, drawn-out pro- 
cess. Can we afford to wait until these changes 
occur?’ 
But according to Dr. Shiva, sex pre-selection 
would only feed the “pathological condition of 
our society which discriminates and denigrates 
women.” [|

### 117056: Is China's law eugenic? A concern for collective good

Is China’s law eugenic? 
China’s approach to family planning has been attacked in the West as authoritarian 
and an infringement on individual rights. Below, Chinese Academician Qiu Renzong rejects 
claims that his country’s Law on Maternal and Infant Health is eugenic. Overleaf, a German 
Sinologist challenges Qiu Renzong’s position.

box opposite page) has attracted considerable 
criticism in the Western media and scientific 
circles. Some of the criticism is valid but some is 
based on misunderstandings caused by linguistic or 
cultural barriers. Much of the confusion revolves 
around the word yousheng, which repeatedly occurs 
in the legal text. A tricky word with dual meanings, 
itis commonly used to mean “healthy births” in asso- 
ciation with child-rearing. However, yousheng can 
also be used to describe eugenic programmes such 
as that practised by the Nazis. Unfortunately, Engli- 
sh translations of the law tend to reflect this latter 
meaning. 
Is the Maternal and Infant Health Law eugenic? 
I would argue that for a policy to be eugenic it must 
first reject individual consent and second, be based 
on racism. Neither of these conditions applies to 
China’s law. While doctors may advise two indivi- 
duals at risk of passing on hereditary disease to refrain 
from marrying or to undergo sterilization, the ulti- 
mate decision is left to these adults. When prenatal 
testing reveals genetic disease, a doctor will offer 
advice—not a directive—concerning abortion. 
C-: Law on Maternal and Infant Health (see 
The way to a higher domain 
It is also crucial to recognize that the law is not 
motivated by racism but by a desire to reduce birth 
defects. Indeed, there is no racist tradition in China. 
The Chinese have been the victims of Western impe- 
rialism and Japanese militarism. They may have 
made grave mistakes, but they have never claimed 
superiority over another people,and their military 
actions have never been motivated by racism. Nor 
is racism part of China’s internal policies. The Han, 
China’s dominant ethnic group, do not claim super- 
iority over China’s minorities. 
Westerners are often shocked by Chinese atti- 
tudes to defective foetuses because they do not 
understand the cultural and economic factors invol- 
ved. The great Confucianist Xun Z1(300-237 BC) 
said: “Birth 1s the beginning of a human being, and 
death is the end of a human being. A human being 
who has a good beginning and a good end fulfills the 
Tao [the Way to a higher spiritual domain].” Two 
major factors shaping genetic policy in China emer- 
ge from this Confucian view. First,abortion is moral- 
ly and socially acceptable because life begins with 
birth. A foetus is not considered a human being. 
Second, congenital disease and deformity are consi- 
dered a sign of sin committed by the parents or ances- 
tors in their previous life. Given that a defective new- 
born child is traditionally called a “monster foetus”, 
it is not surprising to find little in the way of familial 
or social support. One of the parents of a deformed 
baby will usually have to stop working, and the costs 
of caring for such a child can amount to a third of an 
average worker’s salary. 
Poverty 
Changing these negative attitudes will take a 
great deal of time. T here are now more than 50 mil- 
lion handicapped people, mostly living in poverty, 
and it is unreasonable to expect any major impro- 
vements in the treatment of handicapped children 
and their mothers in the near future. In this context, 
many feel that these children and their mothers 
would be better off if the handicapped had never 
been born. In fact, the Chinese Association of the 
Handicapped formally urged the government in 
1989 to speed up legislation to prevent the birth 
of deformed babies, given their suffering and the 
burden they represent for society. 
The concern for the collective good has at times 
led geneticists and others in China to infringe upon 
individual autonomy. They have confused what is 
technologically possible (genetic testing) with what 
is ethically permissible. However, I feel that the law 
1s a positive step towards guaranteeing everyone 
access to genetic counselling and to prohibiting sex- 
selection. Chinese geneticists and bioethicists have 
criticized some articles of the law. T heir suggestions 
include more explicit recognition of the principle 
of informed consent. Last year, the authorities 
consulted leading Chinese bioethicists and gene- 
ticists and will make the needed changes at an 
appropriate time.Meanwhile,I would ask Western 
colleagues to directly consult officials, geneticists 
and citizens instead of trying to sanction China, 
which may do more harm than good. u

### 117057: Is China's law eugenic? The legislation imposes decisions

2. ‘The legislation imposes decisions’ 
  
+ Rank Dikotter 
th Law often argue that the word yousheng 1s 
mistranslated as “eugenics”, instead of “heal- 
thy birth”. Besides the simple observation that a 
term has no given meaning outside the context in 
which itis used, it might be noted that in European 
languages the word “eugenics” also etymologically 
refers to “healthy birth” (Greek root meaning “good 
in birth™). 
The term yousheng appeared in China during 
the 1920s when many publications on eugenics were 
translated or written in Chinese. T he internatio- 
nal eugenics movement, spanning from Sweden 
to Japan, was embraced by many intellectuals in 
China. Some openly praised Nazi racial policies, 
while others adopted a softer approach aimed at 
preventing “unfit” individuals from reproducing. 
While eugenics became taboo after the communist 
take-over in 1949—as it did elsewhere in the world 
given its association with Nazism—it reappeared as 
an intrinsic component of the one-child policy of 
1978. 
Today, large numbers of popular and scientific 
publications still hail the British scientist Francis 
Galton (1822-1911; Charles Darwin’s cousin, the 
founder of eugenics) as the father of yousheng which 
they clearly define as the science by which the state 
can improve the physical and mental features of 
its population by selective breeding. 
The law’s supporters strongly emphasize its reco- 
Si of China’s Maternal and Infant Heal- 
  
  gnition of “individual consent”: but what real effect 
can “individual consent” have in a one-party state 
such as China, where political dissent is so often

POINTS OF LAW 
The following are key excerpts from the official translation of China’s Maternal and Infant Health 
Care Law, which came into effect in 1995. 
Article 8: The pre-marital physical check-up shall include the examination of the following 
diseases: (i) genetic diseases of a serious nature; (ii) target infectious diseases;and (iii) rele- 
vant mental disease. 
Article 10: Physicians shall, after performing the pre-marital physical check-up, explain 
and give medical advice to both the male and the female who have been diagnosed with cer- 
tain genetic disease of a serious nature which is considered to be inappropriate for child-bea- 
ring from a medical point of view;the two may be married only if both sides agree to take 
long-term contraceptive measures or to take ligation operation for sterility. 
Article 16: If a physician detects or suspects that a married couple in their child-bearing age 
suffer from genetic disease of a serious nature, the physician shall give medical advice to the 
couple, and the couple in their child-bearing age shall take measures in accordance with the 
physician’s medical advice. 
Article 18: The physician shall explain to the married couple and give them medical advice for 
a termination of pregnancy if one of the following cases is detected in the prenatal diagnosis: 
(i) the foetus is suffering from genetic disease of a serious nature; (ii) the foetus is with defect 
of a serious nature; and (iii) continued pregnancy may threaten the life and safety of the pre- 
gnant woman or seriously impair her health. [| 
never mention individual wishes: in Gansu provin- 
ce, for instance, “idiots” ,“cretins” and “imbeciles” 
(not defined in medical terms) are not allowed to 
marry unless they have been sterilized. 
It is crucial to understand that racism is not a 
necessary component of eugenics. Thousands of 
individuals judged to be mentally impaired were 
forcibly sterilized in Scandinavian countries until 
the 1960s without being defined as “racially” diffe- 
rent. To defend China’s law by arguing that the Han 
do not think of themselves as superior to “minori- 
ties” is seriously misleading. Why not ask ethnic 
Tibetans what they think about this? 
An inalienable right 
Eugenic laws in China fall largely on two groups: 
peasants (about 70 per cent of the population) and 
ethnic minorities, (55 groups comprising about eight 
per cent of the population). In specialist and popu- 
lar publications, Chinese geneticists claim to find 
higher rates of mental and physical handicap among 
the peasantry than the urban population. They also 
claim that there are higher rates among at least some 
ethnic minorities in comparison to the majority Han. 
T hese geneticists maintain that the economic back- 
wardness of these groups is reinforced by inbree- 
ding. I would argue that this is no more than a scien- 
tized version of Han prejudice against minority 
endogamic practices. 
“Confucian values” are also evoked to justify the 
1995 law. China is not frozen in time. To invoke Xun 
Ziin the 1990s is as useful as referring to the Spar- 
tans to explain Nazi policies. Reproductive freedom 
is not the prerogative of a few privileged cultures, but 
an inalienable part of individual rights. Coercive 
methods of controlling population growth cannot be 
defended on cultural grounds. The sterilization pro- 
grammes used in India during the “emergency per- 
10d” in the 1970s, for example, were overwhelmin- 
gly rejected once general elections were held. Besides, 
research shows that in China and elsewhere indivi- 
duals have very different views on the treatment of 
handicapped people. In surveys by Chinese resear- 
chers in the late 1980s, up to 25 per cent of those 
questioned considered life to be sacred in all cir- 
cumstances. Serious birth defects are one of the most 
painful challenges any family can face, and all pos- 
sible ethical considerations and medical options 
should be carefully considered and openly debated. 
The present eugenic legislation does not reflect this 
consensus-making process; it imposes decisions. 
Even in democratic countries, marginalized 
people may be treated in a discriminatory way, as 
social prejudice and economic interest affect the 
nature of genetic information made available to 
families, employers, insurance companies or wel- 
fare states. In a one-party state like China, euge- 
nic laws have been used to suppress rather than assist 
vulnerable people. u

### 117058: Human cloning is Dolly's debatable offspring

Human cloning is Dolly’s 
debatable offspring 
  
+ David Dickson 
The dawning possibilities of human cloning raise unprecedented ethical and political 
dilemmas. Nowhere is the debate more intensive than in Britain, where the cloned sheep Dolly 
was created using a revolutionary technique.

international science journal 
Nature, and author of The New 
Politics of Science (University of 
Chicago Press, 1988)

the government refused to endorse a proposal from 
the respected regulatory body established by the act— 
the Human Fertilization and Embryology Authori- 
ty—to allow amendments to the legislation which 
would formally allow research into therapeutic clo- 
ning. The government said it needed more time to 
study the ethical implications of such amendments. 
For Britain, the political dilemma is particularly 
acute. On the one hand, the cloning techniques deve- 
loped byWilmut and his colleagues have been hailed 
as a major scientific breakthrough whose broad poten- 
tial medical applications promise to provide a major 
boost to the British economy, for example through 
licensing to companies across the world. 
But with trust in government scientists already 
deeply scarred by the experience of bovine spongi- 
form encephalopathy (BSE, informally known as 
Mad Cow Disease), and further dented by concern 
over the potential health and environmental dangers 
of genetically modified crops, the government appea- 
red reluctant to take further risks to its credibility by 
giving rapid approval to another “revolutionary” and 
> = PH / controversial technology. 
mut and his colleagues at the Roslin Institute out- 
side Edinburgh announced that they had suc- 
cessfully cloned a sheep, Dolly, the news set off a 
global wave of concern about the possibilities of 
human cloning. In contrast, the reaction of govern- 
ment officials in Britain was one of satisfaction—bor- 
dering perhaps on complacency—that adequate pre- 
parations had already been made to address the full 
implications of cloning research. 
As political leaders across the world spoke stern- 
ly of the need for an immediate global moratorium 
on such research, Britain was able to point out that 
human cloning—the creation of humans copied from 
other humans—was already banned under the 
Human Fertilization and Embryology Act, passed in 
1990. 
The 1990 Act does, however, allow research on 
human embryos up to 14 days old and in principle 
appeared to open the way for “therapeutic cloning” — 
the use of cloning techniques to develop a potential 
range of medical treatments such as organ and tissue 
replacement and repair. 
But the mood changed in June this year, when 
n February 1997, when British scientist Ian Wil- Copies of pop stars 
There are few who would endorse the use of clo- 
ning technology to produce replica human beings to 
order. It is therapeutic cloning, with its enormous 
potential medical applications to humans, that is at 
the centre of most current controversy. 
One possible application of therapeutic cloning 
could be the treatment of women whose mitochon- 
drial DN A—the genetic material that provides ener- 
gy to the cell—is damaged, and therefore risks pas- 
sing this defect on to their children. Another is the 
ability to grow and graft skin in this way, which would 
replace the need for the current practice of using skin 
taken from another part of a patient’s body. The same 
technique could be used to replace damaged bone 
or liver cells. 
The problem, of course, is that the word cloning 
remains highly emotive,creating, as it does, visions 
of rich pop stars or autocratic dictators ordering up 
multiple copies of themselves. Critics argue that clo- 
ning represents the ultimate “instrumentalization” 
of a human being: treating one individual primarily 
asthe means to gratify another, not as an end in him- 
self or herself. They also argue that any attempt to

distinguish between “reproductive cloning” and “the- 
rapeutic cloning” is largely semantic, and that giving 
the green light to the second will inevitably lead to 
the first. 
But the distinction is seen as critical for those keen 
to realize the full medical potential of the cloning 
techniques. Among them isWilmut himself, who has 
spent much of the past two and a half years talking 
about both the threats and the promises that his work 
has opened up, and now works as chief scientific offi- 
cer for Geron Bio-Med, a company set up earlier this 
year jointly by the Roslin Institute and a U.S.bio- 
technology company, Geron, to exploit the potential 
of his work. 
ForWilmut, like many others, the ethical threats 
of human cloning involve sensitive issues of human 
identity and social relationships,particularly within 
the family. “We can all imagine the type of issues that 
would arise if a cloned child were born into our own 
family,” he says. “Just think, for example, of the dif- 
ficulties for a child who fails to meet the expectations 
of its parents, which is quite likely given that perso- 
nality is only partly the result of our genetic inheri- 
tance.” But he also insists that the promises of clo- 
‘We can all imagine the type of issues that would 
arise if a cloned child were born into our own family. 
Just think, for example, of the difficulties for a child 
who fails to meet the expectations of its parents, 
which is quite likely given that personality is only 
partly the result of our genetic inheritance.’ 
Because of heredity, our 
lives are actually as full 
of cabbalistic signs and 
spells as 
if sorcery really did 
exist.

ning techniques, if responsibly used, remain 
enormous. “There is a large potential here for provi- 
ding more effective treatment for a range of diseases, 
such as Parkinson’s Disease, that are associated with 
damaged cells that do not have the ability to repro- 
duce themselves.” He acknowledges that the ethi- 
cal dilemmas are difficult,adding:*“ We are keen to 
take part in any discussion that addresses them.” 
But attempts to win acceptance for therapeutic 
cloning research in the political arena have proved 
fraught with obstacles, primarily stemming from the 
political strength of anti-abortion groups, who remain 
deeply opposed to all forms of cloning. 
This, for example, has already been the fate of 
attempts by the Clinton administration to introduce 
legislation in the United States that would simulta- 
neously outlaw reproductive cloning while allowing 
embryo cloning for therapeutic purposes. 
Sensitivities in the U.S. are high. Earlier this year, 
the National Institutes of Health announced that, 
despite being subject to a congressional ban on the 
use of federal funds for research on embryos, it had 
decided to sponsor work on stem cells obtained from 
embryos provided by the private sector, e.g., left over 
from fertility treatments. (Stem cells are undifferen- 
tiated cells from which specialized cells such as blood 
cells develop.) But congress is now moving to close 
this loophole. 
The perspective of U.S. critics is close to that 
Bioethics: the lure of the perfect child 
which has dominated legislative debates in mainland 
Europe—in particular in France and German y—with 
its heavy emphasis on potential threats to human 
“dignity”. Indeed it is this approach, combined with 
the view that human life begins at conception, that 
has led most European countries to ban not only 
attempts at human cloning, but all forms of embryo 
research. 
‘A moral black hole’ 
In contrast, the official British (and American) 
approach has, up to now, been more pragmatic, seeing 
the potential dangers of human cloning primarily 
in terms of the possible medical risks, such as uncer- 
tainty over long-term complications. But the UK 
government’s new announcement appears to reflect 
an increased willingness to accept that other more 
explicitly “ethical” factors need to be taken into 
account. 
This acknowledgment was immediately welco- 
med by religious lobby groups such as Christian 
Action Research and Education, whose director, 
Charles Colchester, was quoted in the London Times 
as urging the government to ensure that anew review 
body set up by the government to investigate human 
cloning techniques should consider what he descri- 
bed as the “gaping moral black hole” in such scien- 
tific research. 
But this suggestion was widely criticized by resear- 
chers in the field.Robert Winston, for example, pro- 
fessor of fertility studies at the Royal Postgraduate 
Medical School in London, warned that many of Bri- 
tain’s “best scientists” may be tempted to leave the 
country to carry on their work if the government does 
not back down. “By confusing the cloning argument, 
the government is in danger of impeding one of the 
most significant medical advances of the decade,” he 
said. 
There was also criticism from those keen to see 
cloning techniques developed as a commercial acti- 
vity. “British science is currently at the forefront 
of this emerging field,” says John Sime, the chief 
executive of the Bioindustry Association, the pro- 
fessional organization for the UK biotechnology 
industry. “But it is a competitive one in which much 
1s at stake,both for patients and the economy.” 
Some remain optimistic that research will recei- 
ve the green light. “If the promises that have been 
made for these new techniques, in terms of the 
potential for treating degenerative diseases, are even 
half true, it would be immoral not to go ahead with 
the research,” says Juliet Tizzard of the Progress 
Educational Trust, a group that lobbies in favour of 
research on reproductive technologies. 
But this conclusion is far from assured, and the 
debate is far from over. The prospect of being able 
to produce identical copies of adult humans conti- 
nues to hold enough fascination for some—and to 
be sufficiently distasteful for others—to ensure that, 
whatever the potential medical benefits from 
the less dramatic aspects of cloning research, 
its supporters face a difficult task in getting 
permission to proceed. L

### 117059: Germany: the dark shadow of the past

Germany: the dark 
  
  
+ Hartmut Wewetzer 
Memories of the Nazis’ eugenics ideology provide a sombre 
backcloth to German debate on applications of human 
genome research 
bioethics. When the birth a cloned sheep 
called Dolly was announced in 1997, it set off 
wild speculation in the media.T he idea of cloning 
humans was immediately dubbed immoral and set 
off a barrage of condemnation from many politi- 
cians, scientists, church officials and environmen- 
talists. It had already been formally banned by a 
1990 German law protecting embryos. 
Why is there such near-unanimous agreement 
about this and why are people so touchy when it 
comes to discussing biology, medicine and ethics? 
Why is Germany so far behind in what bioethicist 
Ludger Honnefelder calls its “ability to think and 
judge” in these matters? 
We have to remember the horrors perpetrated by 
the Nazis in the name of eugenics. These pseudo- 
scientific theories developed in the 1930s, and from 
1939 on they were used to justify, among other 
things, the extermination of Jews, handicapped 
people (100,000 of whom were subjected to “eutha- 
nasia”in the space of five years) and gypsies. 
In the name of science and “the master race”, doc- 
tors and geneticists performed horrific experiments 
on human guinea pigs. “T he whole subject was taboo 
among German scientists until the early 1980s,” says 
Benno Miiller-Hill, a geneticist at Cologne University 
who published a book in 1984 called “Mortal Science”. 
“We can’t walk past this ocean of blood and 
continue on our way as if nothing had happened,” 
he says. Especially as modern genetics may spawn 
new kinds of “scientific racism”. It could lead, he 
speculates, to a link being made between genes 
governing certain character traits, such as aggression, 
and membership of an ethnic group, which would 
encourage discrimination. 
Germany’s National-Socialist past also weighs 
on the Council of Europe’s Convention on Human 
Rights and Biomedicine, which Germany refuses to 
sign.M any politicians, religious believers,environ- 
mentalists and associations of handicapped people 
say it isn’t tough enough. They agree with the 
Catholic Social Democrat Robert Antretter, who 
fears “a resurgence of disregard for human life as it 
was applied during the Nazi era.” 
G ermans tread very delicately in the field of

shadow of the past 
   
They oppose parts of the convention which 
allow research to be done, in certain circumstances, 
on human subjects who cannot give reasoned 
consent (mainly children and the handicapped). 
They also deplore the fact that it does not ban 
experiments on embryos,as in Germany. Opposi- 
tion to the convention is growing in the German par- 
liament. 
‘We enjoy 
disaster scenarios’ 
Only prenatal examinations seem to escape the 
general criticism. The churches do not strongly 
oppose this practice. Wolf-Michael Catenhusen, a 
Social Democrat and Secretary of State for research 
in the present government,says it is important that 
the people involved should be able to decide whe- 
ther or not to bring a handicapped child into the 
world. “We musn’t forget,” he says,“that in more 
than 90 per cent of cases such examinations prove 
parents’fears to be groundless.” 
The “historic” suspicion of genetics does not seem 
to have lessened since the coalition government of 
Social Democrats and Greens took office in 1998. The 
Greens are critical of modern medicine and science. 
“Progress in biomedicine calls into question our 
concept of what it means to be human,” says Monika 
Knoche, the Greens’ health expert. 
German scientists and industrialists stress that the 
country must not get left behind by its foreign com- 
petitors in the field of the new technologies. “We enjoy 
disaster scenarios,” former President Roman Herzog 
once said. “Nearly all discoveries raise many questions 
about the risks and dangers involved, but few about 
the opportunities they provide.” u 
The life of science is 
that superficial life. 
It pursues success with 
skill and thoroughness, 
and takes no account 
of the higher nature of 
man.

availability of a range of prenatal tests designed to 
spot genetic anomalies in embryos 
will boost the development of genetic counselling 
services. 
But who will benefit from all this? Right from the 
start of the Human Genome Project in 1990, James 
D. Watson, one of the discoverers of DN A’s double 
helix structure, has campaigned for this great pro- 
ject to stay in the public domain. “The world’s 
nations,” he has said, “must realize that the human 
genome belongs to everybody on the planet and not 
to individual countries.”

Most discoveries and new treatments have come 
out of laboratories in the rich countries, but people 
from countries of the South have also contributed 
their brain power and hard work. It was an Indo- 
nesian, Joe-Hin Tjio, who proved, in 1956 in 
Sweden, that human beings have 46 chromosomes. 
In 1968,in the United States, Indian Nobel Prize- 
winner Har Gobind Khorana became the first 
person to synthesize a human gene. 
Lack of resources 
and political will 
Analysis of the DN A of some indigenous peoples 
has yielded valuable genetic data for scientists who 
have subsequently declared discoveries made on the 
basis of it to be their own intellectual property. 
One such population study, for example, identi- 
fied the genes of a man of the Hagahai tribe (Papua 
New Guinea) which provide immunity to the leu- 
kemia virus HTLV. 
But owing to lack of resources and political 
will, many poor countries have trouble putting 
together a serious policy on science which would 
reduce their total dependence on rich countries »

» and enable them to work out research priorities. 
Some of these countries however have human exper- 
tise and facilities which allow them to contribute to 
work on DNA sequencing. 
India, for example, has six laboratories where 
this can be done, all of them linked to the Hydera- 
bad Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology. 
Some Indian specialists would have preferred to 
sequence the DNA of pathological organisms 
(microbes, mosquitoes, contaminants,etc.) which 
are common in India, rather than that of human 
beings chosen at random. In this way, it would have 
been easier, they say, to develop applications that 
would be immediately useful to people in India. 
This is an ongoing debate because nobody can gua- 
rantee that analysis of the human genome will lead 
to medical treatment for people in the countries of 
the South, where there are fewer profits to be made 
than in the North. 
Light-years away 
from medecine’s new horizons 
The other big question is that of access to the new 
forms of treatment. Even in rich countries, where 
public spending on health is being cut, these thera- 
pies will be very expensive—at least to begin with— 
and are likely to trace a new frontier between the well- 
off and the rest of the population (see page 26). So 
it is not very likely that treatment of this kind will really 
reach the people of the third world. T he countries of 
the South are also light-years away from the new 
horizons of medicine because they lack basic health 
facilities and trained health workers. 
Should some countries, or even whole regions like 
Africa south of the Sahara, not be part of today’s 
debate about bioethics just because they might be 
excluded from the benefits of tomorrow’s medicine? 
T he answer is no. First, because their inhabitants are 
sometimes directly involved. The elimination, for 
example, of some “harmful” genes through germ-line 
therapy—if it were ever applied on a world-wide 
scale—could be very harmful to them. In accor- 
dance with the phenomenon known as pleotropy, a 
single gene can control several characteristics. T hus 
the recessive gene of cystic fibrosis may play a part in 
fighting cholera. 
Sickle-cell anaemia (an abnormal form of the 
red pigment of the blood, haemoglobin) affords 
some protection against the deadly form of the 
malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. If the 
gene that triggers this condition is eliminated, do 
we risk seeing even more cases of malaria? This is 
a very gloomy prospect in a world where malaria 
is already killing two million people a year and 
when none of the big pharmaceutical companies 
have invested money to look for a vaccine. More 
generally, the whole planet is concerned by the 
risk of reducing the genetic reserves available to 
future generations by altering or eliminating cer- 
tain genes. Is it not presumptuous and dangerous 
to anticipate their needs when nobody yet knows 
what kind of environment they will be living in? 
No one on the planet should be excluded from 
3 6 The Unesco Courier - September 1999 
          
discussions about matters affecting human exis- 
tence, which are of course of universal concern. 
Bioethics is about the absolute, intrinsic worth of 
every individual—the very essence of human life. 
The lines it draws between what is possible and what 
is acceptable should be worked out with the invol- 
vement of all the world’s cultures,even if they are 
minority or dominated cultures. 
What’s more, bioethics again poses the urgent 
question of solidarity among human beings in the 
face of illness. When genetic medicine no longer just 
serves the rich but also enhances their lifestyle, 
prolongs their lives or enables them to produce 
children with specific characteristics, can we deny 
the people of poor countries the benefits of know- 
ledge which would free them from the scourge of 
debilitating parasitical diseases, of Aids and of here- 
ditary afflictions? How long could such “medical 
apartheid” fail to affect the consciences of those 
living in the countries of the North? nu 
  
  
  
  
  
  
A TREATY ON THE GENOME? 
£ n the framework of international co-operation, Sates should seek to encourage measures 
enabling: . . . the capacity of developing countries to carry out research on human bio- 
logy and genetics, taking into consideration their specific problems, to be developed and streng- 
thened . . . ; developing countries to benefit from the achievements of scientific and tech- 
nological research so that their use in favour of economic and social progress can be to the 
benefit of all.” Article 19 of the Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights 
gives a new focusto “the rights of solidarity” . The declaration,which is not legally binding, 
was adopted by the international community in 1997 after long negotiations within UNESCO's 
International Bioethics Committee (IBC). 
The declaration also enshrines two major principles, explain Noélle Lenoir, who chaired 
the IBC during the negotiations. First, rejection of biological determinism: human beings are 
not animals programmed by their genes Second,a refusal to accept that genetics can pro- 
vide justification for socially discriminatory or racist practices “ Human dignity” isthe key expres- 
sion in the text, which condemns reproductive cloning. This declaration adopted under UNes- 
co's auspices is today the only text of universal scope which specifically concerns bioethical 
issues. “But,” Lenoir adds, “| feel that in the present context of globalization we should be 
moving towards a treaty,” that signatory stateswould be bound to respect. Warning:turbulence 
ahead. [|

### 117061: Is copyright on the wrong track?

|S COPYRIGHT ON THE 
WRONG TRACK? 
+ Mireille Buydens 
Efforts to strengthen intellectual property rights are posing a challenge 
to their original purpose—striking a balance between the protection 
of individual property and the public interest 
New Delhi, in a get-tough demonstration organized by software companies, an elephant tramples on pirated CDs. 
What is the purpose of intellectual pro- 
perty rights? Originally they were based 
on the principle that creators should be 
granted exclusive rights to exploit their 
works, in order to ensure they were properly 
remunerated and, in addition, to encourage 
creative activity. But in the interest of the 
community and of future artists and inven- 
tors, those exclusive rights were limited in 
time:when the term of protection ran out, 
the works fell into the public domain, a 
copyright-free space that encourages crea- 
tion and competition. They could then be 
used as raw material and a kind of “sugges- 
tion box” by fresh generations of creators. 
A balance between the protection of indi- 
vidual property and the general interest was 
guaranteed. 
Today that balance has been destroyed. 
T he founding principles of intellectual pro- 
perty seem to be threatened by an ill-consi- 
dered increase in the number of privately 
held exclusive rights at the expense of the 
public domain. 
Counterfeit software 
and designer clothes 
The main factor hastening these deve- 
lopments is a change in the economy, which 
focuses increasingly on products with “intel- 
lectual added value”, such as new software, 
the selection and presentation of informa- 
tion, specialized computer services, cul- 
tural and entertainment products,biotech 
products, and other applications of cut- 
ting-edge technologies. Control of ideas, 
forms, images and brands is a crucial 
element in this so-called “immaterial eco- 
nomy’. 
While it is difficult to steal a consign- 
ment of steel girders or a cargo of bananas, 
it is child’s play to copy software or manu- 
facture counterfeit designer clothes. It is 
easy for intellectual added value to be illicitly »

appropriated: it cannot be “put under lock 
and key”. Those who want to exploit it for 
their own profit simply need to be able to 
reproduce it. Pirates in this field can market 
copied products at a lower price than the 
originals,since they do not have to pay the 
cost of creating or advertising the product. 
By doing this, they distort competition. 
International negotiations 
To protect their industries against piracy 
and counterfeiting (see box), the member 
countries of GATT (General Agreement 
on Tariffs and Trade, which governed inter- 
national trade from 1947 to 1994) set out 
to strengthen intellectual property rights 
within the GAT T framework. GATT ’s main 
concern was to protect companies from 
unauthorized copying and unfair competi- 
tion, thus ensuring they would get a return 
on their investment. 
When GATT concluded its first agree- 
ments, intellectual property was not very 
high on the agenda. In the immediate 
postwar years,products put on the market 
still consisted of atoms of matter, not bytes. 
It was not until the Uruguay Round of talks 
started in 1986 that the issue came to be dis- 
cussed at the international level. T hat round 
of talks resulted in the signing, on April 15 
1994, of the Agreement on Trade-Related 
Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights 
(TRIPS). Like the multilateral agreements 
on trade in goods, the text was included in 
an appendix to the Marrakesh framework 
agreement that set up GAT T’s successor, 
the World Trade Organization (WTO). 
TRIPS,which has a global application 
(most countries in the world have now sub- 
scribed to it), confirmed the economic 
importance of intellectual property rights. 
It requires member states to protect all 
forms of creation:literary and artistic works 
in the broadest sense (including maps and 
press photos), computer programs, data 
bases, sound recordings, radio and television 
broadcasts, drawings and models, inven- 
tions of products and processes in every 
technological field, the lay-out designs of 
integrated circuits,and so on. 
The agreement was a milestone in the 
history of intellectual property. First, its 
scope of application is unprecedentedly 
wide:anything created in the fields of tech- 
nology, software, news or culture can and 
must be protected by an intellectual pro- 
perty right, in such a way that it exclusively 
benefits rights holders, who alone decide 
how it should be reproduced and distri- 
 
Pirates can market 
copied products 
at far lower prices 
than the originals, 
since they don’t have 
to pay the cost 
of creating or advertising 
the product. 
By doing this, 
they distort competition 
buted. Secondly, for the first time TRIPS 
requires contracting states to organize pro- 
cedures and sanctions that enable rights 
holders to ensure that their rights are res- 
pected. Those states are for example obliged 
to allow persons or companies whose rights 
THE COUNTERFEITING INDUSTRY 
A ccording to Peter Lowe of the Counterfeiting Intelligence Bureau (CIB), a London-based organiza 
tion that reportsto the International Chamber of Commerce, counterfeiting isa “multi-billion-dollar 
industry”. The CIB puts its global turnover at $250 billion. “It is estimated that it accounts for 5-8 per cent 
of world trade,” says Lowe. The most commonly counterfeited products are software programs, CDs, CD- 
Roms, videocassettes, watches and designer clothes. 
In the United States, the copyright industries alone (essentially the cinema, television, publishing, record 
companies, and manufacturers of software and video games) lost $12.4 billion asa result of piracy in 1998, 
according to the International Intellectual Property Alliance (IPA). This group of commercial bodies that 
are campaigning for stronger protection of intellectual property includes 1,350 American companies. Accor- 
ding to its president, Eric Smith, “copyright industries are growing very fast worldwide”. In the United States, 
they account for about 3.65 per cent of GNP. In 1996, they became the country’s main export, ahead of 
automobiles, agri-foodstuffs and aerospace. 
3 8 The Unesco Courier - September 1999 
have been infringed upon to go to court 
and obtain damages. Such duties are chiefly 
incumbent upon the developing countries. 
Most of these countries do not possess the 
human or financial resources that would 
enable them to develop their own produc- 
tion, and they have tended to become the 
preferred locations of the copying industries. 
In this general mo ve towards compre- 
hensive protection of products with intel- 
lectual added value, the European Union 
has not lagged behind. In the course of the 
past 10 years, it has been very active in 
introducing new legislation. According to 
the directive of May 14, 1991, computer 
programs are protected by copyright at 
European Union level. Similarly, the defi- 
nition of copyright content has been tigh- 
tened,particularly as regards the copyright 
of works put on the Internet. In this connec- 
tion, a proposed directive on “the harmo- 
nization of certain aspects of copyright and 
neighbouring rights in the information 
society” was examined by the European 
Parliament on February 10, 1999, with a 
view to its adoption. T he directive contains 
provisions for authors or their rights holders 
to control the distribution of their works on 
the Net or to forbid it. Any copy of their 
sound or visual works available online will 
entitle them to financial compensation, 
even if the copy is made solely for strictly 
private use. 
A new right to protect investment 
The protection of data bases by copy- 
right has also been confirmed. For the first 
time in the European Union, it was even 
extended to their contents by a directive of 
March 11 1996. Until then, it had been 
accepted that a compilation of data pos- 
sessing the characteristics of an original 
creation could be protected by copyright. 
But this protection covered only the selec- 
tion and arrangement of the data, in other 
words the structure or container of the 
base,not its content. The raw data, on the 
other hand, were not covered by copyright 
and could therefore be used by anyone.On 
this occasion, the European legislator 
stressed that data collection could, irres- 
pective of the creation of the data base’s 
architecture, represent a substantial invest- 
ment. He concluded that the content of 
the data base should also be protected. 
Clearly departing from the traditional rules 
governing intellectual property, which in 
theory concern creative contributions alone 
(products with intellectual added value), 
he established a new right designed to pro- 
tect financial investment. T hose who make 
a “substantial” investment are provided, 
de facto, with an exclusive right to the bene-

fits of their investment, even if there has 
been no intellectual creation. 
Financial interests again have now 
prompted the European legislator to 
consider the adoption of a directive on the 
protection of biotechnological in ventions. 
The move was motivated by two factors: 
first, “the protection of biotechnological 
inventions will certainly be of key impor- 
tance for the Community’s industrial deve- 
lopment”; secondly, “research and deve- 
lopment, notably in the field of genetic 
engineering, require a considerable degree 
of high-risk investment which cannot be 
profitable unless there is adequate legal 
protection”. 
Financial terminology—talk of profita- 
bility and an attractive “return on invest- 
ment’—is invading the sphere of intellectual 
property. The notion of intellectual pro- 
perty used to be a way of protecting intel- 
lectual added value;it has now become an 
instrument for turning invested capital to 
good account. Is this a necessity or is it 
regrettable? The question is worth deba- 
ting. 
It is true that in the field of biotechno- 
logy, for example, creation requires consi- 
derable investment. T his is something that 
industrial companies cannot accept unless 
they are sure of being able to make it at least 
partially profitable. On the other hand, one 
may reasonably wonder whether there is 
any point in creating a new monopoly on 
information contained in data bases, even if 
a great deal of time and money has gone 
into creating them. The idea here is not to 
reward an intellectual creation, however 
slight, but merely to repay an investment in 
time and money. T his trend could well jeo- 
pardize the sharing of knowledge. The 
notion of intellectual property here seems to 
have departed from its basic purpose, which 
was to ensure a balance between private 
and public interests. 
This change of direction is one of the 
first perverse effects of the exponential 
increase in the amount of space occupied by 
intellectual property. More fundamentally, 
it has been engineered by a society that 
Research 
and development, 
notably in genetic 
engineering, require a 
considerable 
amount of high-risk 
investment which 
cannot 
be profitable 
unless there is adequate 
legal protection 
tends to make legal and material protection 
the keystone of its ethos: all property and 
anything else of value needs to be protected 
against risk. Accident prevention,security, 
insurance and protection have become man- 
tras in developed Western societies. It has 
reached the point where those societies 
sometimes seem to have forgotten that risk 
is an inherent aspect of life and freedom. 
The second perverse effect of the boom 
in intellectual property—the broadening 
of its scope as well as of its duration—is 
equally worrying. In 1993, for example, 
the duration of copyright in the European 
ETHICS 
Union was increased from 50 to 70 years 
after the author’s death. 
On many occasions over the last ten 
years, legislators and courts have also 
agreed to an unlimited extension of the 
scope of copyright protection. Originally 
designed to protect works of art, copyright 
has been extended to cover every sphere of 
human creation, from the design of car 
bodywork or ties, meteorological photo- 
graphs and the instruction manuals of 
electrical household appliances to data 
bases and recipes. Since everything 
belongs to someone, an authorization from 
the owner is required for everything. In 
practice it has become extremely difficult 
to create a multimedia work, to shoot a 
film, to compose a piece of music, or to 
publish an illustrated book without in 
some way having to use elements that are 
protected by copyright, and therefore 
having to request a detailed authorization 
from copyright holders and to pay them 
financial compensation. 
In the short term, this increase in the 
number of exclusive rights will be a threat 
to economic activity itself. Competition, 
after all, boils down to offering the same 
product as someone else. Now if that 
product and all its variants, versions and 
components are protected by intellectual 
copyright, copying—in other words, 
making a competing offer—becomes an 
extremely hazardous exercise. If limited 
exclusive rights, which used to form part of 
the original spirit of intellectual property, 
protect companies against illicit copying, 
disproportionate exclusive rights quite 
simply wipe out competition altogether. 
As for the extension of the duration of 
copyright, it means that the community’s 
right to make free use of a work after it has 
fallen into the public domain will be a 
theoretical possibility rather than a fact. 
The present duration of copyright protec- 
tion often exceeds the period during which 
the created work 1s in fact usable. After 70 
years or more, an old computer program is 
of no use to anyone. 
Similarly, the European directive on 
data bases theoretically restricts their pro- 
tection period to 15 years. But it stipulates 
that if a data base is modified, notably by a 
large number of additions, deletions or 
changes which show there has been sub- 
stantial further investment, the duration 
can be extended by 15 years. Thus, a regu- 
larly updated data base can be protected 
for ever and will therefore never fall out of 
copyright. That contravenes the most fun- 
damental principles that underlay the 
notion of intellectual property rights. H

### 117062: Carthage's long-awaited rescue

CARTHAGE S 
LONG-AWAITED RESCUE 
  
+ Sophie Bessis 
Despite 30 years of protection, the site of the great city of Antiquity is still being eroded by urban 
pressures. A major conservation project now in the works should pave the way for new excavations 
Imagine an urban area whose popula- 
tion has increased from 300,000 to 
nearly two million in 40 years. It 
sprawls out in every direction and its 
growth seems unstoppable. This is the 
case of Tunis, which has even started 
filling in some of the salt lakes on its per- 
iphery and building modern neighbou- 
rhoods on the reclaimed land. 
As you go north of the capital,past the 
big port of La Goulette and the old sub- 
urb of Kram, you suddenly come upon a 
vast expanse of meadowland, green in 
winter and yellow in summer, that is dot- 
ted with the remains of walls, heaps of 
stones and the stumps of still-gleaming 
marble columns. These are the outskirts 
of Carthage, in Antiquity the prosperous 
capital of the Roman province of Africa. 
Towards the sea, the landscape is 
again dominated by buildings, forming an 
immense garden city interspersed with 
the splendid ruins of the ancient city. Its 
suburbs stretch further north as far as 
ancient Megara, overlooked from a height 
by the village of Sidi Bou Said, whose 
white domes have for centuries stood out 
between the sea and the sky. 
Unexcavated 
remains 
Carthage, a city both mythical and 
real, was founded in the 9th century B.C. 
by the legendary Queen Dido (also 
known as Elissa), who hailed from 
Phoenicia. It became the Mediterranean’s 
most formidable maritime trading power 
until the rise of the Roman Empire, 
which destroyed it in 146 B.C. Its for- 
tunes then revived under the Romans. 
Only ruins are left of the Phoenician city, 
but the remains of Roman and Byzantine 
Carthage are more abundant and give a 
good idea of what one of the biggest 
cities of ancient times was like. But a 
large part of the old city is still buried

and, if steps are not taken, may stay hid- 
den forever. 
To get an idea of the threats that hang 
over ancient Carthage, you have to climb 
atop the hill of Byrsa, which was the site 
of a Phoenician fortress and then the 
Roman forum. Today the hill is occupied 
by the St Louis basilica, which was built 
in early colonial times, and the former 
archbishop’s palace, now a museum. 
From here, you can see over the entire 
plain of Tunis. Nearly all the narrow 
coastal strip between the lake and the sea 
is built up. Teeming slums fill the sou- 
thern end of the strip. Further north,bet- 
ween Carthage and the seaside resort of 
Marsa, are chic residential suburbs where 
every rich or politically powerful Tunisian 
dreams of living. 
Carthage, which was supplanted by 
Tunis more than a thousand years ago, 
seems to have become once more a sym- 
bolic place of power since Habib 
Bourguiba, independent Tunisia’s first 
president, established the presidential 
palace there. The urban pressure seems 
inexorable, whether from the poorer 
areas or from the zone of luxurious villas 
which look on to them. Tunis has no 
more room to expand and is greedily 
eyeing a 500-hectare area which has been

set aside as a future archaeological park. 
The site of Carthage has been protected 
for the past 30 years, and new building 
has been virtually halted. Urbanization 
began at the end of the last century, with 
the construction of the railway from Tunis 
to La Goulette and Marsa. Under the 
French protectorate, villas and housing 
estates began encroaching on the area. 
After independence in 1956, this creeping 
expansion accelerated dramatically. The 
city grew in size because of population 
growth and an exodus from rural areas. A 
new government-fostered middle class 
sharpened appetites for land and proper- 
ty speculation. Concrete spread like a lava 
flow. 
A rescue 
operation 
In the early 1970s, awareness began to 
spread, both in Tunisia and abroad, that 
the remains of Carthage were in danger of 
disappearing forever. On May 19, 1972, 
UNESco Director-General René Maheu 
launched an international campaign to 
save the site, which was put on UNESCO’s 
World Heritage List in 1979. Rescue ope- 
rations soon began. As a dozen teams of 
archaeologists from several countries got 
to work, the Tunisian government took

steps which led in 1985 to the declaration 
of a 600-hectare zone of Carthage and 
Sidi Bou Said as a protected area where 
new construction was mostly banned. 
Heritage campaigners breathed a sigh 
of relief. But if the worst has been avoided 
over the past 15 years, threats still loom. 
The fight to save Carthage has been 
conducted at various levels. It aims to halt 
the spread of poor housing as well as to 
curb the appetite of the wealthy who are 
determined to put up buildings and of 
businessmen who want to promote hou- 
sing development in a zone where land 
values are the highest in the country. 
There is little sympathy for the morato- 
rium on such development. Why, people 
ask, should a building project, which is 
either necessary or profitable, be banned 
just to preserve past history which only 
interests an educated minority of 
Tunisians? 
Over the years, six orders have cut 
back the area of the future archaeological 
park planned in 1985. Two zones were 
reclassified as part of the urban area and 
were quickly built on, while luxury villas 
have sprouted around the famous 
Phoenician ports. Some land has been 
given to the Polytechnic Institute to 
expand its campus. Squatting by poor 
people in the Ellil district on the edge of 
Carthage has also been allowed. 
These encroachments on the protec- 
ted zone are worrying but not alarming, 
according to one expert, and so far the 
core of the site has been preserved. But 
the pressures are so strong today that tou- 
gher laws are now needed as well as the 
creation of the long-awaited Carthage- 
Sidi Bou Said archaeological park, whose 
physical existence would finally put an 
end to such pressures. 
Things are moving along slowly. Since 
1991, a cabinet committee chaired by 
After independence 
in 1956, urban expansion 
accelerated dramatically. 
The population increased, 
and a new middle class 
sharpened its appetite 
for land and property.

President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali has 
overseen the Carthage project, for which 
the president has always expressed strong 
support. Officials are working on a pre- 
servation and development plan for the 
park which is expected to be much more 
detailed and restrictive than the 1985 pre- 
servation order. It will authorize public 
expropriation of any part of the site, 
enabling the government to buy the land, 
most of it still privately-owned. It will ban 
division of plots of land and the building 
of housing estates and, with the 1994 
Heritage Code, will complete the coun- 
try’s set of preservation laws. 
UNEsco dispatched a team of experts 
to Tunis in March 1999 to take a look at 
the plan. They reported that it was “use- 
ful and coherent”, though it “risked set- 
ting off conflicts, mainly with landowners 
.. . but also for other reasons, including 
financial ones.” The state, they said, 
“should make a substantial investment to 
gain control of the land by buying it.” 
So all the obstacles have not yet been 
overcome, but if the determination of the 
politicians holds, the preservation plan 
should come into effect before the year 
2000. To mark the occasion and also 
launch a new series of excavations, the 
Tunisian authorities want to stage an 
international conference on Carthage in 
January 2000. 
By making the establishment of the 
park irreversible, Tunisia will be the only 
Mediterranean country to have protected 
600 hectares of land in the centre of its 
biggest urban area. Tunis will be the only 
Mediterranean city with a park of such 
size and with such a rich history. For the 
past 30 years, friends and admirers 
of Carthage have been fighting to make 
this great dream come true. So far the 
battle has not been lost—but it has yet to 
be won. nu

and Egyptian capitals has triggered epic battles and led

Greater Cairo’s tentacular growth reaches out to the pyramids. 
The efforts to safeguard Carthage and the 
nearby village of Sidi Bou Said (see page 
40) are particularly noteworthy because 
ancient remains in two other Arab capitals have 
not always enjoyed the same good fortune. 
In Cairo, the pyramids have had a narrow 
escape. “I don’t think anything can harm them 
now,” says Zahi Hawwas, the energetic head 
ofthe Giza archaeological zone. In 1995, howe- 
ver, this UNEsco World Heritage site, which 
contains the last of the Seven Wonders of the 
World that can still be seen, was nearly cut in 
two by the greater Cairo ring road being built 
to decongest the city of 15 million or so inha- 
bitants. After a campaign led by UNESCO and 
helped by the media, Egyptian President Hosni 
Mubarak came down on the side of heritage. 
Asa result, the eight-lane ring road has not 
been paved for the four kilometres that were 
supposed to cross the Giza Plateau, but the 
rubble is still there and the route has been 
handy for truck drivers who use it as a short 
cut. “I ordered this traffic to stop at the begin- 
ning of June,” says an annoyed Hawwas,who 
wants the government to build a detour that 
avoids the site. 
“We asked for the road foundations to be 
destroyed but that wasn’t done, so I fear the 
plan to use the route isn’t completely dead,” 
says Said Zulficar, a former UNESCO official 
who fought against the ring road and is now 
secretary-general of the French NGO Patri-

moine sans Frontieres (Heritage Without Bor- 
ders). 
He deplores the fact that another part of 
Cairo, the protected site of Fustat, the first city 
founded by the Muslim conquerors in the 7th 
century, is being harmed by “rampant urban 
expansion”. T he authorities, he says,“have 
built social housing and an amusement park 
right in the middle of the town when it hasn’t 
even been excavated by archaeologists. 
“In Egypt, there are laws and officials but 
there are also people more powerful than the 
laws, along with a lot of speculators,” says Zul- 
ficar, hinting at the weakness of the state’s 
Higher Council for Antiquities in the face of 
big construction firms headed by people in the 
inner circles of power. 
This is something the inhabitants of Bei- 
rut know all about. After the recent civil war, 
Lebanese archaeologists had an unexpected 
chance to explore and display the precious 
bowels of the city centre which had been expo- 
sed by bombing. But the area “was cleared by 
bulldozers and dynamite as part of a huge 
urban renewal project,” says Lebanese archi- 
tect and town planner Jade Tabet. The main 
shareholder of Solidere, the company doing 
the clearance work, was wealthy former prime 
minister (1993-1998) Rafik Hariri, who is now 
in disgrace. 
This meant that a blueprint making the 
city into a kind of Manhattan on the M editer- 
ranean was forced on the centre of the Leba- 
nese capital “even before archaeologists could

Development and rebuilding in central Beirut 
have given short shrift to archaeological remains. 
start digging,” says Leila Badre, the respected 
curator of the Museum of the American Uni- 
versity of Beirut. “From that point on, the die 
was cast—badly—and we realized that the 
importance of the archaeological remains was 
going to be played down.” 
Excavations sponsored by UNESCO bet- 
ween 1993 and 1995 uncovered some very 
valuable remains, notably the ancient “tell” or 
mound which was evidence of the city’s Phoe- 
nician origins. In 1996, the government even 
ordered three sites to be preserved, but the 
order was never carried out. “If we don’t take 
action quickly, the remains will be damaged,” 
warns Badre. 
Who can do this? Solidere or the Directo- 
rate General of Antiquities? Solidere is going 
through a bad patch, and in April 1999 the 
head of the Directorate General and half of his 
aides were thrown in prison for embezzlement. 
“It’sa mess,” saysTabet.“We should have 
based the plan for the new centre of the city 
on sites that could have become centres of 
attraction. But just try persuading someone 
who only thinks in cash-flow terms that 
archaeology can create added value! All the 
developers see are square metres of space to 
be built on as fast as possible. So some remains 
have been dumped in the sea, others are crum- 
bling into dust and Solidere’s ‘dazzling’pro- 
ject is 
in the doldrums. It’s dreadful to see the 
3,000-year history of a city sold down 
the river.” u

### 117064: The Darker side of the Net

THE DARKER SIDE 
OF THE NET 
  
+ Cynthia Guttman 
    CONNEXIONS 
To combat child pornography on the Net, there is a strong consensus that governments, 
law enforcement, industry and users each have a role to play 
The most cunning criminals have always 
sought to outsmart police, and cybers- 
pace is no exception. The virtual,bor- 
derless universe frequented by some 130 mil- 
lion netizens provides the detective writer 
with every ingredient for a labyrinthine thril- 
ler: an anonymous interface,characters miles 
apart adopting nicknames and fake addresses, 
sometimes disguising their identities to enti- 
ce a victim into a real-life meeting, or sen- 
ding encrypted materials that are just about 
impossible for outsiders to decode. 
It could be a thriller, except when the 
material being traded is child pornography 
and the people enticed are under-age. 
Images range from innocent photographs 
of young children with neutral or smiling 
expressions to extreme cases: in 1996, mem- 
bers of the Orchid Club chat room (see glos- 
sary) used a digital camera connected to a 
computer to photograph a 10-year-old child 
posing in a sexually explicit manner. The 
pictures were transmitted to other online 
ring members who made requests for the 
girl to pose in other positions. The ring was 
an international one, and its members were 
arrested in several countries. 
Innocence in danger 
As the online population grows, coun- 
tries and organizations are stepping up 
efforts to curtail child pornography on the 
Internet.By the medium’s very nature,the 
venture is international. In April 1999 UNES- 
co launched its Innocence in Danger move- 
ment that aims to sensitize public opinion 
to child pornography on the Internet and 
mobilize resources to make the Net safer for 
children. In May, a victory was scored when 
Japan, one of the largest producers of child 
porn material, passed a law banning its pro- 
duction and distribution. In September, top 
European and American judicial and poli- 
ce officials, along with industry representa- 
tives and NGOs, are meeting in Austria to 
discuss strategies for reinforcing co-opera- 
tion in the field.

In Chicago, DeNashatae Horton shows her mother and sister some of the tools developed on its web site

by the Ameritech company to help parents and children surf the Internet safely. 
Just how pervasive is child pornography 
on the Net? In researching her forthcoming 
book, A Parents’ Guide to Protecting Children 
in Cyberspace, Parry Aftab, an American 
cyberspace lawyer and former director of 
Cyberangels, the largest U.S.online safety 
and education programme,compiled a list 
of 30,000 sites relating to child abuse or pae- 
dophilia, out of an estimated total of 4.3 
million sites. Looking more closely at news- 
groups (see glossary), Rachel O’Connell, a 
psychologist from the University of Cork 
(Ireland) who is co-ordinating a European 
research project (COPINE) on the issue, 
found that child pornography amounted to 
0.07 per cent of around 40,000 newsgroups 
worldwide. According to Ruth Dixon, 
manager of a British hotline run by the 
Internet Watch Foundation, the worst mate- 
rial is concentrated in some 20 newsgroups. 
Trading child pornography, however, is just 
one face of the coin, the other is the danger 
of children entering online chat groups with 
the intention of making friends or sharing 
interests, and ending up face-to-face with 
a person who turns out to be much older 
than claimed and seeking a sexual encoun- 
ter. 
One of the greatest concerns is that the 
Internet has made child pornography more 
visible and accessible, giving paedophiles 
the sense of being connected to a commu- 
nity of like-minded individuals. According 
to O'Connell, “one of the most significant 
factors influencing the growth of child por- 
nography on the Internet is the ease of dis- 
semination and collection. Anonymity and 
convenience have revealed an extraordi- 
nary level of sexual interest in children. Pre- 
sumably, this interest was either dormant 
or latent on this scale in the past.” As Mar- 
tine Brousse, head of the French NG O Voix 
de I’Enfant, puts it, “the person who might 
not have gone through the process of buying »

CONNEXIONS 
a particular magazine to nurture his fan- 
tasies can now just go on the Net, it’s not 
difficult.” In newsgroups devoted to child 
porn,users typically recount claimed expe- 
riences and fantasies to each other and 
exchange pictures, sometimes by the hun- 
dreds. O’Connell has found that they tend 
to be a fairly cohesive and well-structured 
community, and provide advice to each 
other on how to avoid detection. Money 
rarely comes into the equation. 
Legal loopholes 
There is nothing illegal about exchan- 
ging fantasies. What is illegal in most coun- 
tries—but not in all—is the production and 
distribution of child pornography. This can 
make it difficult for authorities to take action 
at the source, where materials are being 
uploaded. Nor is the possession of child por- 
nography a criminal offence everywhere. The 
definition of a child’s legal age varies from 
one country to another, and so does the defi- 
nition of indecency. And while the majority 
of users are based in developed countries, 
NGOs such as Casa Alianza and ECPAT 
(End Child Prostitution, Child Pornography 
and Trafficking of Children for Sexual Pur- 
poses), express concern that child sex tou- 
rism is being promoted via Internet,putting 
children at further risk of not only being abu- 
sed but having their photographs taken and 
transmitted online from countries where rules 
relating to child pornography are lax or non- 
existent. Faced with these loopholes, police, 
NGOs, judicial authorities and law enforce- 
ment are pressing for national legislations to 
be better harmonized. 
Since the mid-1990s,police forces in a 
number of countries have set up units spe- 
cialized in tracking down online child por- 
nography. In Britain, Scotland Yard’s pae- 
dophilia unit started to take the Net 
seriously when investigations led to the sei- 
zure of computer hard drives containing 
child pornography images. The U.S. Fede- 
ral Bureau of Investigation (FBI) launched 
an undercover operation dubbed Innocent 
Images in 1994 to target people trading in 
child porn or expressing an interest in tra- 
velling inter-state with the intention of 
having sex with minors. “We pretty much 
have this down to a fine tuned science,” 
explains veteran FBI agent Peter Gulotta. 
“Typically, most of our work involves going 
into chat rooms that we have reason to belie- 
ve are involved in child pornography. We 
pose as adults willing to trade in child porn 
or as a young boy or a young girl.In a very 
short period of time, a predator will enga- 
ge usin a conversation about our sexual acti- 
vity. Some will very quickly express a willin- 
gness to actually travel to meet us.” This

technique has led, since 19935, to 357 arrests, 
with a 99 per cent conviction rate. 
Not all countries have the resources, 
skills and legal right to intervene in this way. 
An international convention on cyberspa- 
ce crime is currently in the works, with a 
particular focus on procedural problems 
such as collecting evidence in a crossborder

contact to whom intelligence on paedophiles 
can be passed on. There are complaints of 
reports being sent from one country to ano- 
ther and not being acted upon for months. 
What is far from clear is the relationship 
between viewing child pornography and 
sexually abusing a child, even though an 
image is already the reflection of an abuse. 
“Child pornography is a far more serious 
issue that merely talking about photographs, 
it is the actual visual depiction of the sexual 
assault of a child,” stresses Reynolds. “The 
circulation of these photographs revictimizes 
the child.” According to French psychiatrist 
Bernard Cordier, the Internet can reinfor- 
ce apaedophile’s tendencies and increase the 
risks of committing an offence should a par- 
ticular set of circumstances allow it. What 
concerns Gulotta is that most people arres- 
ted have no prior records, but investigations, 
which include examining materials on com- 
puter software and disks, have on some occa- 
sions revealed previous sexual encounters 
with children. When pictures are seized, the 
first priority of law enforcement is to deter- 
mine how recent they are in order to reach 
children who might be at risk now. In 
conjunction with police forces in several 
countries, the COPINE project has construc- 
ted a database of seized child pornographic 
videos and pictures traded via the Internet. 
These images lend themselves to crime scene 
analysis,providing clues as to the picture’s 
origins and facilitating co-operation,since 
the same pictures may be reported to poli- 
ce in different countries. 
Partly in response to demand from the 
police and the public, industry has started 
to come forward. “Pressure on them has 
been extremely strong,” says Saint M aur. 
“From the very beginning, everyone,inclu- 
ding the police, put the blame on them. But 
Just as you can’t blame the postal service for 
shipping porn videos, it’s rather difficult to 
really point the finger at Internet Service 
Providers (ISPs, see glossary). Nonetheless, 
this pressure has led ISPs to co-operate with 
police. For them, it’s out of the question that 
they should do the policing.” The bottom 
line is that without the technical expertise 
of industry and its willingess to pass on 
information to the police,the fight against 
illegal content will be ineffective. Police raids 
on ISPs in Germany have led to an uneasy 
relationship between industry and law 
enforcement bodies. “Law enforcement in 
and of itself is not a solution, it has to be 
part of a broader framework that includes 
the taking of responsibility by the industry 
itself,” says Jens Waltermann of the Ber- 
telsmann Foundation, which designs and 
supports projects in a wide number of fields.

illegal content, namely hotlines as a feed- 
back mechanism for users, voluntary codes 
of conduct among ISPs and software for 
rating and filtering purposes. 
Rising public awareness 
For now, hotlines are the main mecha- 
nism through which potentially illegal 
content is reported. Such hotlines exist in 
less than ten countries and are funded by 
government, industry, NGOs or a combi- 
nation. Links with law enforcement are not 
always strong enough. T he question of a pri- 
vately funded line informing police about 
activities regarding a third party can, in some 
countries, be viewed as a breach of privacy. 
Saint Maur and French cyberspace lawyer 
Daniel Kahn both stress that governments 
should be the ones setting up hotlines, with 
direct transmission of the information to a 
central, specialized police unit. T he Briti- 
sh-based NGO ChildNet International is 
heading an initiative that aims to harmoni- 
ze and improve co-operation among hot- 
lines while encouraging new ones. The 
European Parliament is expected to adopt 
a policy by the end of the year that would 
encourage member states to set up specia- 
lized round-the-clock units to liaise with 
ISPs and law enforcement when alleged ille- 
gal material is reported.

increasing points to rising public awareness 
of the issue. While industry is working on a 
number of rating and filtering initiatives, these 
are not deemed sophisticated enough to deal 
with child pornography. Aftab recently tes- 
ted all the filtering materials on the market 
and found that none blocked out the list of 
illegal child pornography sites that she had 
compiled. Cyberangels now licences this list 
out to filtering software companies, but so 
far only one, Net Nanny, has acquired it. But 
filtering, even if it works, might protect chil- 
dren online but certainly not those whose 
images are being traded. 
NGOs,industry and police stress the role 
ofeducation, both for parents and children, 
in raising awareness and reporting illegal 
material. Aftab believes that children under 
13 should not be taking part in unmonito- 
red chat rooms, which software can block 
out. Awareness programmes also emphasi- 
ze that schools should not be building web 
sites featuring pictures of children and divul- 
ging personal information about them. As 
head of the U.S.N ational Action Commitee 
for the Innocence in Danger initiative, Aftab 
has every intention of multiplying awareness 
initiatives, and already has giants like Micro- 
soft and AOL on her side. Only a public 
groundswell can prompt governments to allo- 
cate more resources towards what is funda- 
mentally a child protection issue. “Right now, 
it’s possible to have a finger on the pulse,” 
says O'Connell, cautioning against sensa- 
tionalizing the problem. “If the threat 
becomes too large, these individuals will go 
further underground, to layers of the Inter- 
net where you won’t be able to find them. It’s 
only a matter of time before that actually hap- 
pens.” u

TALKING TO... 
SUNILA ABEYSEKERA: 
PEACE CAMPAIGNER 
ON A WAR-TORN ISLAND 
Defying threats to her life, a UN award-winning Sri Lankan human rights activist has brought 
abuses in Sri Lanka to the attention of the international community (see box opposite page) 
According to a recent United Nations study, 
Sri Lanka is the country with the second highest 
number of disappeared people in the world.1 
And yet there seems to be hardly any debate 
within the country about human rights viola- 
tions. Why is this? 
One of the biggest tragedies of Sri Lanka 
today is the existence of a culture of fear 
in both the majority Sinhala and the mino- 
rity Tamil societies. Ethnic conflict (see time- 
line) and the war against Tamil militants 
have heavily militarized the society. In the 
last three decades,people in the north and 
east of the island have lived under the Sri 
Lankan army, the Indian Peacekeeping 
Force (IPKF) and different Tamil militant 
groups. Both inside and outside the conflict 
zones, civilians are used to living under dif- 
ficult conditions, with official and unoffi- 
cial curfews, house-to-house search opera- 
tions,arrests,torture and detention as part 
of their everyday experience. Some civilians 
who openly spoke out against the violence 
and terror have been killed publicly by the 
army or by the militants. So there has been 
no way civilians could talk about human 
rights violations. 
In the south, the situation is not much 
different. Thousands of Sinhala youths died 
when the government tried to suppress an 
insurgency launched to oppose the Indo- 
Lanka peace accord of 1987. In the years 
between 1987 and 1990, piles of bodies bur- 
ning along the roadside became a common 
sight. Both the army and the insurgents were 
responsible for those massacres and disap- 
pearances. 
In the context of such experiences, 
1.The United Nations Working Group on 
Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances says that 
over 12,000 Sri Lankans have gone missing since 
1980 after being detained by security forces. Only 
Iraq, with 16,384 missing persons, had more 
cases of disappearances. The Sri Lankan 
government estimates the number of disappeared 
persons at around 17,000,while Sri Lankan 
human rights groups say more than 42,000 
people have disappeared in the last two decades.

civilians in Sri Lanka fear that if you raise 
your voice against injustice, the punishment 
will be nothing less than death. Not intimi- 
dation, assault or imprisonment, but a very 
brutal death.Even today, people are being 
abducted, detained and tortured by the 
security forces and by para-military and 
militant groups. The culture of fear has given 
rise to a culture of silence. People are still 
afraid to talk about what happened between 
1987 and 1990, or about what is going on 
today. Under existing conditions we cannot 
expect civilians to come forward to talk 
about the human rights abuses of the past 
and present. The challenge facing civil socie- 
ty in Sri Lanka now is how to break this 
culture of silence. 
Although there has been extensive loss of 
life in the conflict in Sri Lanka, the international 
community has not taken a particularly 
strong line on thisissue. What do you feel 
about this? 
According to our estimates more than 
100,000 people have been killed in Sri 
Lanka in the last two decades. It is a pity 
that our successive governments as well as 
the Tamil militant groups have not made 
sincere efforts to find a peaceful solution. If 
the international community had shown a 
little more interest and put pressure on the 
Sri Lankan government and the Tamil 
rebels, I think there could have been a nego- 
tiated settlement by this time. 
Although SriLanka is in a state of war, 
the country continues to receive Western 
development aid. This money is supposed to 
be used for relief, reconstruction and reha- 
bilitation. But how is it possible to underta- 
ke development work in the midst of a war? 
Probably, Western countries consider the Sri 
Lankan situation as a manageable conflict. 
If the situation becomes unmanageable, 
as in Kosovo or Rwanda, then I think there 
may be some kind of initiative. 
In my view, there is also an element of 
racism and neo-colonialism involved in the 
West's lack of interest in the Sri Lankan

UN Human Rights award from Secretary-General Kofi Annan.

situation. If one white person had been 
abducted or killed in Sri Lanka, then the 
Western countries would have reacted dif 
ferently. These are brown people killing 
brown people in a faraway country. Why 
should the West bother? 
A few years ago, the Si Lankan 
government formed commissions of inquiry 
to look into the disappearance of civilians 
and human rights violations. What have these 
led to? 
In the 1990s, human rights groups in 
Sri Lanka and abroad launched a huge 
public campaign demanding an inquiry into 
the reported disappearance of over 42,000 
people. As a result, the government formed 
a Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCI) 
in 1992 to investigate the complaints. Since 
then there have been several other com- 
missions on disappearances. 
Thousands of families of the disappea- 
red testified before the PCIs, which in turn 
submitted reports to the president. But the 
commissions lacked powers to initiate legal 
action against those found guilty. None of 
the reports has been made public so far. All 
the reports are lying with the presidential 
secretariat. Only the president has the autho- 
rity to submit them to parliament. 
In 1998, because of considerable pres- 
sure from the United Nations Human 
Rights Commission, civil society, the media 
and the international community, the 
government said it had initiated action 
against about 100 policemen who were 
implicated by the disappearances commis- 
sion for the Central Province of Sri Lanka. 
T his resulted from a list of over 1,000 com- 
plaints. Only one of the accused was a senior 
officer. The rest were junior officials. 
Human rights groups have been calling 
for the commission to investigate further 
and expose those higher officials and poli- 
ticians who actually gave orders for these 
abductions and killings. In the context of 
the on-going war, one has to understand the 
dependence of the political structures on 
the security machinery. From the state’s 
point of view (not from mine), you can per- 
haps even justify formal impunity, but there 
cannot be a total denial of the reality of what 
hashappened in SriLanka. If found guilty, 
politicians should be barred from holding 
public office and from contesting elections. 
This demand is not unprecedented.T here 
are many examples, including Argentina, 
Chile,Guatemala, and El Salvador, of coun- 
tries where various commissions named 
political bosses for human rights abuses. 
Human rights groups were also success- 
fulin forcing the Sri Lankan government 
to allow a visit by Amnesty International and

A VICTORIOUS STRUGGLE 
AGAINST INTIMIDATION 
ntimidation is nothing new to 46-year-old Sunila Abeysekera, the Executive Director of INFORM, a lea 
ding Sri Lankan human rights organization set up in 1989. In 1988, when she was several months pre- 
gnant, death threats forced her to flee the country and seek refuge for a brief period in the Netherfands. 
Her “crime” was to persistently demand accountability for human rights abuses and action against per- 
petrators of human rights abuse, regardless of their rank or position. She wason the hit list of the Janata Vimuki 
Peramuna (JP), a militant leftist movement, in the mid-1970s, soon after her expulsion from the group. Her 
bold criticism of the movement's activities and a call for democracy and justice within the group had 
aroused the wrath of some senior members. But she weathered the storm and continued to work on her own 
for civil rights. “When everyone is criticizing you, then you are doing the right thing,” Abeysekera says. 
She was among the few members of the majority Sinhala community who established direct contact 
with Tamil women in the north and east of Sri Lanka after the outbreak of ethnic conflict in 1983. Working 
closely with her father, Charles Abeysekera, she highlighted human rights violations perpetrated by 
security forces under the guise of the Prevention of Terrorism Act and emergency rule in the country’s Tamil- 
dominated north and east. 
The Si Lankan human rights situation attracted international attention after human rights NGOs in Sri 
Lanka, including INFORM, began to participate in the annual sessions of the UN Human Rights Commission 
in Geneva from 1992 onwards. Abeysekera’s consistent presence at international human rights fora and 
the international focus she has brought to the human rights situation in Sri Lanka have helped to bring 
about some improvements. At the parliamentary elections in 1994 Sri Lankan political parties were 
forced to pledge that they would give top priority to improving the human rights situation if elected to office. 
“Though the promise has yet to be fulfilled, at least they recognized that there is a problem,” she says. 
Abeysekera, a mother of two, now lives in Colombo, working with INFORM and many other human 
rights and women’s rights groups seeking peaceful and democratic change in Sri Lanka. 
UN HUMAN RIGHTS AWARDS 
O: December 10, 1998, Sunila Abeysekera was honoured by the United Nations for her outstanding 
contribution to the struggle for human rights. With Angelina Acheg Atyam of Uganda, Jimmy Carter 
of the United States, Jose Gregori of Brazil, and Anna Sabatova of the Czech Republic, she received a UN 
Human Rights Prize at one of a series of events held at UN Headquarters in New York to mark the 50th 
anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 
Honorary in nature, the Human Rights izes were instituted by the General Assembly in 1966 and awarded 
for thefirst time in 1968 on the occasion of the commemoration of the 20th anniversary of the Universal Decla- 
ration of Human Rights. Since then, the prizes have been awarded in 1973, 1978, 1988 and 1993. Previous 
awardees include Nelson Mandela, Eleanor Roosevelt, U Thant and Dr Martin Luther King, J. u 
then by the United Nations working group 
on disappearances in 1991. That was the first 
time that the government recognized that 
there had been disappearances. [t was a major 
breakthrough for the human rights move- 
ment in the country. 
Sri Lanka has been witnessing violence for the 
last three decades. What impact has this had on 
women and how have they responded? 
Women and children are the first vic- 
tims of any kind of conflict. In Sri Lanka 
thousands of families have been displaced 
The war has left scars in northern and eastern Sri Lanka.

TIMELINE 
+ 1948 
Sri Lanka gains independence from Britain. 
+ 1978 
An amendment to the constitution changes 
the parliamentary form of government to a 
French-style presidential system. The 
popularly elected president is head of state,

The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), 
an armed guerrilla movement fighting for a 
separate homeland for Tamils, ambushes an 
army convoy killing 13 soldiers and triggering

more than 2,500 people are killed. In the 
ensuing ethnic crisis half a million Tamils leave 
the country to seek refuge in India and 
elsewhere.

India and Sri Lanka sign an accord to bring an 
end to the conflict. An Indian Peacekeeping 
Force (IPKF) is sent to the island to end the 
hostilities and supervise surrender of arms by 
the Tamil militants.

the release of all prisoners of war and the opening of peace talks. 
» from the north and east due to the violen- 
ce. Men either join the army or the militant 
groups. The third option for them is to leave 
the country. It has been up to the women to 
keep families together and to take care of 
the children. There are about a million dis- 
placed people within Sri Lanka and most 
of them are women and children. 
Many of these displaced women live in 
pitiful conditions in government-run camps. 
Because there is a shortage of food, clothing, 
medicine etc., they are forced to take up 
small-time jobs elsewhere. But they are not 
safe in their workplaces. T he women are sub- 
jected to a lot of sexual harassment. As a result 
of the heavy militarization of the society, the 
incidence of violence in the north and south, 
particularly sexual violence against women, 
has increased alarmingly. 
Communities are deeply divided by the 
conflict, and men respond by imposing more 
restrictions on women. T his applies to Sin- 
hala, Tamil and Muslim women. On the one 
hand, the conflict pushes women to become 
wage earners and to assume responsibility 
for the survival of their families. On the other 
hand, they are expected to conform to tra- 
ditional values and safeguard the “image” 
and “identity” of the community. 
Also, both the army and the militants 
recruit women for their forces. Some of 
them are even used as suicide bombers. T his 
also has an impact on attitudes towards 
women in a society as traditional as ours. In 
a South Asian society, the fact that women 
receive military training and handle arms 
challenges existing attitudes towards women 
and images of them. This has both a nega- 
tive and a positive impact. 
At the same time, we also find women’s 
groups playing an active role in fighting for 
peace and human rights. In 1986, the arrest 
of around 600 Tamil boys led to the creation 
of the “Mothers Front”, which organized pro- 
tests in the streets of the northern town of Jaff- 
na.T hey broke the barriers of a silence of many 
years, and paved the way for a renewed acti- 
vism for human rights. Since then, women of 
all communities have come together in orga- 
nizations seeking justice for disappearances 
and working for peace and reconciliation in a 
very critical way. 
Conservative groups argue that by claiming 
equal rights for women, feminist groups are 
destroying ancient culture and tradition. Do 
you agree? 
In South Asia we have this burden of an 
ancient past. All our political and nationalist 
movements have focused on the fact that we 
are people with a great heritage and a great 
civilization. There is no doubt that we have 
inherited from the past certain noble values 
which need to be protected. But how can you 
use religion and culture to justify discrimina- 
tion against people on the basis of gender, reli- 
gion and caste? 
The conservatives’ hold over society rests 
on their ability to wield control over women. 
More than ever before in history women 
have become the markers of the culture and 
traditions of a community. T he easiest way 
to measure this is by looking at how a com- 
munity imposes a dress code on women. We 
find stricter dress codes for women now than 
in the past. I think we are living in a socie-

ty that’s becoming increasingly fundamen- 
talist and puritanical. 
Conservatives quote religion as an excu- 
se to retain their control over women. I 
strongly believe that religious practices in 
South Asia have nothing to do with the phi- 
losophical framework offered by different 
religions, including Islam, Hinduism and 
Buddhism.They have to do with male reli- 
gious leaders who interpret religious texts 
to suit their convenience. 
The increased participation of women 
in the economic and political life of society 
is a challenge to existing cultural and tradi- 
tional barriers. For example, the concept of 
the family is slowly being eroded as a result 
of economic and social changes that are 
beyond the control of any individual. 
Women are becoming independent, and 
men’srole and the male hold over the fami- 
ly and society are being challenged by the 
processes of globalization. Hence there is 
criticism of women’s claims for equal rights 
and equal treatment. 
What role have peace movements and human 
rights groups played in Sri Lanka? 
Human rights and peace movements 
have been trying to create a small space 
within a heavily militarized society. They 
work closely with the media, academics and 
cultural workers to spread the ideas of peace 
and civil rights. We hope that as an influen- 
tial community within society they will have 
the courage to speak out. 
In 1998 we saw the emergence of two 
alliances of non-governmental organizations 
working for peace and a negotiated solution 
to the ethnic conflict. One is the National 
Alliance for Peace (N AP), consisting of repre- 
sentatives from Tamil, Muslim and Sinhala 
communities, and the other is the Interreli- 
gious Alliance, which includes Catholic and 
Anglican bishops and Buddhist monks. Toge- 
ther they visited several areas of the north 
and the central provinces in 1998 and also 
held talks with the Tamil militants. 
A bigrally was organized in Colombo in 
February this year by the two groups. For the 
first time we had Hindu, Christian and Bud- 
dhist clergy on the same platform and all of 
them spoke of the need for peace. This isa 
very positive development. There is a gro- 
wing realization that you have to negotiate 
with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam 
(see timeline, opposite page) in order to move 
towards any kind of democratic and peace- 
ful settlement of the ethnic conflict in Sri 
Lanka. This kind of intervention is small but 
critical at a moment when ordinary citizens 
are afraid to talk. 
It can’t be easy to be a human rights activist in a 
heavily militarized society. . . 
You are right. When I started working on 
human rights two decades ago it was not easy. 
One is regarded as a trouble-maker, some- 
times as a traitor. Questioning the role of the 
government and of the different political 
actors in destroying democratic structures 
and creating a militaristic environment led 
to attacks from all sides. 
In general, human rights activists in Sri 
Lanka are working under extreme pressu- 
re. Human rights abuses are committed by 
many actors,and we must be critical of all

of them. Training people to document 
human rights abuses, bringing cases befo- 
re the law, providing support for victims, all 
this is a part of our work. Monitoring and 
intervening in human rights abuses in the 
north and east is especially difficult. We do 
not easily acquire permission to visit areas 
under the control of the militants. If there 
are reports of human rights abuses in those 
areas, we go at the risk of our lives. We are 
barred from having direct contacts with the 
Tamil militants because of the Prevention 
of Terrorism Act (PTA), which makes our 
work even more difficult. 
Over the years, we have built up a good 
network of groups all over the country—peace 
committees, religious groups,community 
organizations and women’s groups—who 
send us information and provide support. 
Some individuals living in the troubled 
areas pass on information to us. If necessa- 
ry, they travel to neighbouring areas on fact- 
finding missions, sometimes risking their 
lives. 
Apart from attracting international attention 
to disappearances, what are your achievements 
in human rights work? 
I consider my consistent involvement in 
various campaigns over the last 20 years and 
acceptance by different networks of grass- 
roots organizations and movements,both 
Sinhala and Tamil, as itself a major achie- 
vement. The UN award, feel,is a symbo- 
lic vindication of the work I have done all 
these years. 
Our group, INFORM, co-ordinates with 
many other groups and organizations in 
launching human rights campaigns. In 
1997, we were part of a campaign calling 
for action against soldiers who raped and 
killed aTamil schoolgirl, Krishanti Kuma- 
raswamy, while she was in custody. Her 
mother, brother and a neighbour who went 
looking for her were also murdered. The 
persistent demands finally forced the 
government to initiate legal proceedings 
against the suspects. Six of the accused were 
sentenced to death in 1998. T hat was a land- 
mark verdict and was the first time there 
had been some kind of prosecution against 
army personnel. I think the credit should 
go to all the human rights groups. 
What are the chances of reconciliation after 
20 years of ethnic conflict? 
That’s a difficult question. As a human 
rights activist I can say that it is possible for 
all communities in Sri Lanka to live together 
with dignity and respect. To achieve that,lea- 
ders of all communities should come forward 
to make a new beginning through the pro- 
cesses of forgiveness and reconciliation. 
There should be an acceptance that all 
sides have committed horrendous crimes. 
Then we have to move beyond that. If 
people are going to dwell on the past,then 
there can be no solution. We have come out 
of a particularly bad and horrifying period 
in our history. T he older generation from all 
the communities still remember how they 
lived together happily in the past. It is the 
younger generation which has witnessed 
war,separation and suffering. If the situa- 
tion is allowed to drift, then there is no chan- 
ce for peace in Sri Lanka. 
We all know that even if the war comes 
to an end tomorrow, peace will not return 
unless the people from all communities are 
willing to accept the past, forgive each other 
and go back to living together. For this we 
need a new democratic political structure 
and legal safeguards for the rights of all com- 
munities. [
