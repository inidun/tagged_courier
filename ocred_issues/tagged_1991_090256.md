Masked Phantoms 
1990, clay sculpture 
(30.5 x 12x 9 cm) 
by Clara DelL.amater 
“I've come back from a 
long stay in Dogon 
country. The stone of the 
cliffs, the clouds in the 
sky: everything there is 
flesh and bone.” Clara De 
Lamater is a French- 
American sculptor living 
in Paris. Her trip to Mali 
marked an important 
stage in the development 
of her work, already 
admired for its richness. 
Rhythmic, visionary and 
sensual, her Dogon- 
inspired sculptures 
forcefully express her 
desire to capture what 
one critic, referring to 
her work, described as 
“humankind’s primary 
dance’.

General policy 
 
Bm Meeting in Florence, the General Conference 
defines a “basic programme” of 120 activities 
grouped under 10 major tasks. 
m The first UNESCO expert is sent into the field 
as part of the UN technical assistance programme 
on a scientific mission to Iran. 
M The first conference of representatives of inter- 
national non-governmental organizations 
(NGOs) co-operating with UNESCO is held in 
Florence. Ever since its early days UNESCO has 
sought to collaborate with the NGOs, which 
constitute a precious link with specialists in 
UNESCO's fields of competence and help the 
Organization to accomplish its programme. In 
1990, UNESCO was officially associated with 
585 NGOs. In 1988-1989, from UNESCO’s own 
resources, contracts amounting to almost $2.6 
million were concluded with NGOs. During the 
same biennium subventions allocated by 
UNESCO to NGOs approached $4 million. 
M The first regional conference of UNESCO 
National Commissions is held at Havana. The 
National Commissions are bodies established by 
Member States, in accordance with UNESCO's 
constitution, in order to associate their major 
institutions in education, science, culture and 
communication with UNESCO’s work. 
UNESCO is the only specialized agency of the 
UN which has this system. 
mW UNESCO’s Co-Action Programme is created 
to aid development projects in Member States. 
Between 1950 and 1990 $14,546,291 collected 
by national Co-Action partners, NGOs, schools, 
etc. have been allocated to several hundred 
projects. 
 
Education 
“MA joint UNRWA-UNESCO education 
programme on behalf of Palestine refugee chil- 
dren in the Middle East is launched (UNRWA: 
the United Nations Relief and Works Agency 
for Palestine Refugees in the Near East). In 
1950-1951 there were 42,122 pupils in schools in 
refugee camps; today the figure is 370,600. 5,200 
vocational and teacher training centres are 
involved in the programme.

on Society appears. 
Impact, today published in English, French, 
Chinese, Russian, Arabic and Portuguese, 
presents to a wide audience the achievements of 
modern science and describes their impact on 
society, notably in the developing world. 
Social sciences 
M The first studies on social tensions, stereotypes 
and their connection with international under- 
standing are undertaken, and UNESCO produces 
its first publications in this field (by Otto Kline- 
berg, Margaret Mead, J. Stoetzel and others). 
Culture 
by P. de Berredo Carneiro. 6 volumes are pub- 
lished between 1963 and 1976 with the collabo- 
ration of a thousand specialists from over 60 
countries. A new, updated edition is currently 
being prepared to take account of political - 
changes and the latest historical research. The 48 
quarterly issues of the Journal of World History, 
published as part of the project between 1953 and 
1972, are still a valued information source. 
Communication 
Bm The “Florence Agreement” for the abolition 
of customs duties on certain educational, scien-

relating to lifelong education. 
m UNESCO sets up in Mexico a Regional 
Centre for Fundamental Education in Latin 
America (CREFAL). 
The first regional centre of its kind, it is mainly 
concerned with drawing up strategies and metho- 
dologies in the fields of fundamental education, 
community development and literacy work, and 
with the implementation of pilot experiments 
and the production of teaching materials. It later 
plays an important role in the major project for 
education in Latin America and the Caribbean 
launched by the General Conference at the

Conference decides that members of the Executive 
Board, while they should necessarily be compe- 
tent in UNESCO’s fields of activities, will hen- 
ceforth represent governments of the States of 
which they are nationals. It adopts as the emblem 
of UNESCO a temple in the image of the 
Parthenon, in which Phidias saw “proportions 
rather than dimensions” —a symbol of the balance 
between nations that inspires UNESCO’s activi- 
ties and of its cultural mission. 
BM The USSR becomes UNESCO's 70th Member 
State, followed by the Ukrainian SSR and the 
Byelorussian SSR.

INTERVIEW 
JACQUES-YVES 
COUSTEAU 
The French oceanographer Jacques- 
Yves Cousteau is internationally 
renowned as a marine explorer and 
| defender of the oceans. A pioneer of 
undersea investigation, he has sailed 
all over the world on oceanographic 
expeditions and has also written and 
produced films about the oceans 
which have attracted immense 
audiences. He is now preoccupied 
with the protection of the environ- 
ment in an age of rapid economic 
expansion and population growth.

Interview by 
Bahgat Elnadi and Adel Rifaat 
  
® How did you come to be interested in 
nature and particularly in nature in aquatic 
surroundings? 
— I have always been curious about things. 
When 1 was a child I used to go out bird- 
watching at night. I ran into a certain amount 
of opposition from my parents, who weren't 
very keen on curiosity if it exposed me to 
risks. 
I first really started to learn about water 
when I was ten years old. I was in a holiday 
camp near a lake in the United States. We had 
to collect garbage from under the children’s 
diving platform, and to do that I learned how 
to dive and swim under water. I had no 
goggles or any other special equipment and 
OT 
  
bringing the garbage to the surface was quite 
a job. I spent two or three weeks diving into 
that lake and eventually I learned how to hold 
my breath under water. 
Later, when I was fourteen, I improved 
my underwater swimming techniques. There 
was a swimming pool at my school in Alsace, 
and I used all kinds of contraptions made from 
tubes and pumps in order to breathe under 
water. | wasn’t trying to observe the natural 
world. I was imitating the James Fenimore 
Cooper heroes who hid under water and 
breathed through hollow reeds when trying 
to escape from their pursuers, 
I slowly became convinced that I wanted 
to be a sailor. I passed my baccalaureate and

### 90242: Interview with Jacques-Yves Cousteau

then, when I was twenty, I won a place at the 
French naval academy. Two years later, 
during a round-the-world voyage on a training 
ship, the Jeanne d’Arc, I witnessed a scene that 
had a decisive impact on my life. At Cam 
Ranh Bay in Indochina, at the hottest time of 
day, between noon and two o'clock, I saw 
people diving from their boats and then sur- 
facing with fish in their hands. They told me 
that while the fish were having their siesta 
they were very easy to catch! I thought that 
this was so extraordinary that I decided to 
improve my underwater swimming tech- 
niques further, 
For the time being, however, I had no 
opportunity to do so. I was given command 
of the French naval base at Shanghai, 
providing supplies for ships which docked at 
the French concession. It was only later, when 
I returned to France and thought about the 
people of Cam Ranh Bay, that I came back 
to the idea of developing underwater swim- 
ming techniques. In the meantime I had 
become friendly with Frédéric Dumas and 
Philippe Taillez. We became the Three 
Musketeers of underwater adventure. 
I became obsessed with the problem of 
breathing underwater. My friends and I tested 
all the breathing apparatus that existed at that 
time and found that none of it was satis- 
factory. 
Then came the war and the occupation. 
That was when I met Emile Gagnan, an 
engineer with the Air Liquide company who 
had developed a motor vehicle powered by 
carbon dioxide produced from burning wood. 
The combustible gas reached the engine via 
a special feeder valve. This system 1s used in 
the underwater breathing device with which 
my name is associated, millions of which have 
been sold. In my device, which is entirely self- 
contained, the gas passing through the feeder 
valve is compressed air. Using this system, 
Dumas, Taillez and I were able to extend the 
possibilities of underwater swimming and start 
to make films. 
The resources 
of our planet 
are finite. . 
there 1s a limit 
that should not be 
exceeded, 
  a habitability 
threshold that must 
not be crossed. 
    
When the war was over, I told officials at 
the Navy Ministry about this entirely new 
system we had developed and suggested that 
a study centre be opened at Toulon. As a 
result, a centre for underwater study and 
research was created In the Arsenal at Toulon. 
W You didn’t stay there very long. 
— No. In 1949 I decided that it was time to 
apply what we had learned. To do this we 
needed a ship. Where was the money to come 
from? I opened my address book. Under the 
letter A, I saw the name Auniac. He was a 
charming fellow. [ had met him and his wife at 
winter sports. He was the agent of Guinness 
which, among its other activities, controlled 
the shipyard at Antibes. After a meeting, 
Guinness opened credit facilities for 25 million 
francs and put the manager of the Antibes 
shipyard at my disposal. 
W Jt sounds like a fairy tale. 
— Absolutely! With the manager of the 
Antibes shipyard we went to Malta where we 
found a converted minesweeper that was being 
used as a ferry between Malta and Gozo, the 
little island that is supposed to be the legen- 
dary Ogygia of the Odyssey. In fact that’s why 
the minesweeper’s owner had named his ferry 
the Calypso. We bought the ship for seven mil- 
lion francs. The Calypso was in perfect condi- 
tion, but we had to use the rest of my credit 
to refit her and equip her with 
oceanographical research instruments. 
Then we began our cruises. The credit 
from Guinness was used up and I had no more 
money. I joined the CNRS.* Since the war, 
France had had no oceanographic vessels, and 
so for a few years we served as a transport and 
liaison vessel for French oceanographers. 
W Then came the great success of your film 
The Silent World. . .

remarkable films, one of which won the 
Grand Prix at the Paris documentary film fes- 
tival in 1951. We were making colour films 
as far back as 1953. Things were very difficult 
in those early days. Water tends to absorb 
colours and we had many lighting problems. 
We did a lot of work on the development of 
camera techniques, filters, optical and lighting 
systems, and so on. Gradually we were able 
to start using video up to professional stan- 
dards, initially in black and white. 
Around that time I constructed the first 
French underwater television cameras. Later, 
at Marseilles, I created the Centre d’Etudes 
Marines Avancées. It was at Marseilles that we 
built the first submarine for exploration, spe- 
cially designed to carry out scientific obser- 
vation at a depth of 350 metres. Then, for the 
French State, we made an observation subma- 
rine capable of going to a depth of 3,000 
metres and, for the Americans, a third sub- 
marine capable of operating at 600 metres. [ 
also built two one-man pocket submarines 
which are still in working order today. Finally 
we began to build a bigger submarine from 
which divers could emerge. When the hull was 
finished work had to stop because we had no 
more money. That’s how things stand today, 
twenty years later. 
In 1954 we carried out a mission for the 
Darcy Exploration Company, We had a very 
good contract which enabled us to install the 
radar and measuring equipment we lacked. We 
wo EE 
  
were the people who discovered oil in the 
Gulf! It was us who made the emirate of Abu 
Dhabi rich! 
The Silent World brought in enough 
money to finance our work until 1972, virtu- 
ally without any other source of income. 
Since then we have made many films. In 
1962 we also carried out experiments in which 
men lived and worked underwater at consider- 
able depths. The first of these, known as Con- 
shelf I, was carried out at Marseilles. Then 
came Conshelf II, in the Red Sea, and finally 
in 1965, Conshelf III oft Cap Ferrat. 
Wm How were these experiments carried out? 
— We used a spherical vessel within which the 
atmosphere, consisting of a mixture of oxygen 
and helium, was maintained at the sur- 
rounding water pressure. Six people lived in 
the sphere for three weeks, and when they 
emerged it took another week to gradually 
decompress them. 
With this experiment we became the first 
people to do what is known as saturation 
diving. Since then, the offshore oil industry 
has gone in for this in a big way. 
We made innovations in a wide variety of 
fields. We developed cameras which we have 
used as far down as 8,000 metres. 
We have taken thousands of photos and 
made extraordinary films in a number of 
Atlantic trenches. We were also the first to 
dive in the Antarctic with a submarine and 
to carry out systematic exploration there in 
diving gear. We recently made the first diving 
equipment using plastic bottles filled to a pres- 
sure of 300 bars. 
A Ei " 
Conshelf Il, an underwater colony 
in the Red Sea in which a group of 
oceanonauts iived for a month 
in 1963. 
Wm How did you become interested in environ- 
mental problems? 
— It was an interest that developed slowly. 
Right at the start we coined a slogan: “Know, 
Love, Protect”. That is exactly what happened 
to me! I began by exploring. When I saw all 
this beauty under the sea, I fell in love with 
it. And finally, when I realized to what extent 
the oceans were threatened, I decided to cam- 
paign as vigorously as I could against every- 
thing that threatened what I loved. My story 
forms a cycle. I hope my children can follow 
the same path. 
Wm What are the main dangers that threaten 
the Earth today? 
— After travelling the world as [ have for years 
on end, and seeing it from helicopters, as 2 
diver, from on board ship . . . I would sum 
up my feelings by saying that the resources 
of our planet are finite, that there is a limit 
that should not be exceeded, a habitability 
threshold that must not be crossed. 
We should ask ourselves how many 
animals and people our planet can continue 
to support before the quality of life deter:- 
orates, before all Earth’s beauties fade. Fifteen 
years ago, when I was in the United States, 
I tried to construct a mathematical model to 
find out how many people our planet could 
support with the income, purchasing power, 
and amenities enjoyed by the average 
American at that time, The data at my disposal 
were not very precise and right from the start 
I knew that the approximation would be of 
the order of 40 to 50 per cent. At that time 
Iwas friendly with the director of the Oceano- 
graphic Laboratory of the University of 
Southern California, whose researchers served 
my colleagues and myself as advisers. With the 
parameters [ had at my disposal, I came up 
with the figure of 700 million. Seven hundred 
million people enjoying a standard of living 
comparable to that of the average American! 
Fifteen years ago our planet was unable to pro- 
vide an agreeable life for more than 700 mil- 
lion people! World population was then four 
billion!

### 90242: Interview with Jacques-Yves Cousteau

I was alarmed by the results of my 
research and told the laboratory director about 
it. Do you know what he said? That my 
results were highly optimistic. He had con- 
structed the same mode] as I had and had come 
up with a figure far lower than mine! Since 
then I have been obsessed by the problem of 
the habitability of the planet. 
World population currently stands at 5.7 
billion, a figure that is rising at dizzying speed. 
Every six months, a population equal to that 
of France is added to the current figure. And 
every ten years a population equal to that of 
China is added to that of our human ant-hill. 
Everyone 1s convinced that population 
growth cannot go on in this anarchic, can- 
cerous way. But when the question arises as 
to what should be done, nobody wants to 
know. People make out that nothing can be 
done, that it’s all too complicated, that things 
are even more difficult because of ingrained 
habits, religions and whatever. In fact, religion 
has nothing to do with it. Italy is the world’s 
most Catholic country and yet it has the 
world’s lowest birth-rate. Spain, which is also 
Catholic, is in a similar position, Its birth-rate 
is dropping vertiginously. In Indonesia, the 
world’s biggest Islamic country, a birth con- 
trol campaign in the last ten years has reduced 
the birth-rate by almost 50 per cent. 
So religion shouldn't be held responsible. 
Fear of the future may be, however. In the 
so-called developing countries there is no 
insurance for old age. Retirement pensions, if 
they exist, do not even provide for basic needs. 
Even when they are young people panic when 
they think about their old age, especially since 
they grow old quickly because of poor sani- 
tary and other conditions. To care for them 
in their old age they need a male child they 
can rely on. And since they have to take 
account of their chances of having daughters 
as well as sons, of mortality rates, and of the 
possibility that some of their children are not 
going to be interested in looking after them 
when they get old, they need to have six off- 
spring before they can be sure of having a 
dependable male child. Six children to be sure 
of having three boys. Three boys to be sure 
of having two who survive. And two living 
boys to be sure of having one who will look 
after his parents. 
In addition to the insecurity factor there 
is the factor of female illiteracy, which is also 
a result of poverty. In the developing coun- 
tries education has made great strides but there 
are still not enough schools. Selection is thus 
made on the basis of sex. Boys take priority 
over girls when it comes to enrollment in 
school. 
Why? My answer may make you raise 
your eyebrows, but the fact is that little girls 
do not go to school because there is no safe 
drinking water. When there is no drinking 
water in the vicinity the girls have to go and 
fetch it from the spring. I have seen adoles- 
cent girls fetch drinking water from twenty 
and sometimes thirty kilometres away, which 
takes a whole day. By the time they are four- 
teen or fifteen years old, these girls whose lives 
are geared to meeting the urgent need for 
water have never been to school, have never 
learned anything. How can they use con- 
traception or even know that contraception 
exists? 
Some people even try to explain exces- 
sively high birth-rates by the fact that for 
hundreds of millions of people love is the only 
source of happiness. Contraception neither 
prevents nor reduces happiness. The con- 
traceptive pill is distributed freely in many 
poor countries and yet the women do not take 
it. Why? Because they have had no education 
and are subjected to the will of the men who 
either do not care about the consequences or 
want children to look after them in their old 
age. 
Qverpopulation is our planet’s number 
one problem. Of the 5.7 billion people on 
Earth, less than 2 billion live in decent

conditions. This figure will soon double. 
Perhaps we shall manage to feed the expected 
10 or 12 billion. But that’s just about all we 
shall be able to do. 
m Some people believe that the sea can be a 
rich source of food. . . . 
— That is a ridiculous idea. The sea’s resources 
are diminishing. There is far too much over- 
fishing already. And even if we manage to 
keep on harvesting the same quantity of pro- 
tein from the sea, this quantity is bound to 
diminish as a proportion of consumer needs. 
I remember that at the beginning of my career 
10 per cent of the protein consumed came 
from the sea. Today the proportion is of the 
order of 4 to 5 per cent. Tomorrow, when the 
population has doubled, it will fall to 2 per 
cent. Here too, productivity has a ceiling 
which cannot be exceeded. We are already in 
the overfishing zone. 
m And yet we can increase productivity on 
land. Why can’t we do the same with the sea? 
— The rates of return are not at all the same. 
In the Antarctic, for example, it takes ten 
tons of microscopic algae to form a ton of 
krill—=krill are tiny shrimps . . . and it takes 
one ton of krill to produce 20 kg of whale. 
This is a transformation factor of 40 to 1. To 
produce a cow on land, the transformation 
factor is ten to one. 
BW What about desertification? Isn't it true 
that whereas the desert has been invading 
agricultural land it may now be retreating. 
— The information on which this view is based 
is too recent and needs to be confirmed. All 
the same, I am willing to accept that the Sahara 
was created by human beings and that it may 
consequently be unmade by them. If the 
Sahara were to become cultivable, its output 
would be far higher than that of the sea, 
Wm What about pollution? 
— Global warming and the increasing rarity 
of water are far more serious and urgent 
threats than the chemical pollution we hear 
so much about. There is less and less water

because water is squandered, and this too goes 
hand in hand with overpopulation. Water is 
being wasted at a terrific rate. In the West, 
farmers water their crops in such a way that 
90 per cent of the water evaporates. We draw 
on groundwater and then let it evaporate! This 
year, in spite of abundant rainfall, France will 
be facing drought problems. Why? Because in 
the last three years we have wasted much of 
the water we have drawn. 
The damage caused to the planet is a func- 
tion of demography but also of levels of 
development. One American tires the planet 
far more than twenty Bangladeshis. Damage 
is also linked to consumption. Qur society is 
geared to increasingly useless consumption. 
It’s a vicious circle which I compare to a 
cancer. 
W Some snakes, mosquitoes and other animal 
species pose threats or dangers for 
humankind. Can they be eliminated like the 
viruses that cause certain diseases? 
— Getting rid of viruses is an admirable idea, 
but it raises enormous problems. In the first 
1,400 years of the Christian era, population 
numbers were virtually stationary. Through 
epidemics, nature compensated for excess 
births by excess deaths. 
I talked about this problem with the 
director of the Egyptian Academy of Sciences. 
He told me that scientists were appalled to 
think that by the year 2080 the population of 
Egypt might reach 250 million. 
What should we do to eliminate suffering 
and disease? It’s a wonderful idea but perhaps 
not altogether a beneficial one in the long run. 
If we try to implement it we may jeopardize 
the future of our species. 
It’s terrible to have to say this. World 
population must be stabilized and to do that 
we must eliminate 350,000 people per day. 
This is so horrible to contemplate that we 
shouldn’t even say it. But the general situa- 
tion in which we are involved is lamentable. 
W And yet solutions must exist. . . . 
— It’s a question of cost. We need $400 billion 
a year for fifteen years. To provide people with 
safe drinking water. To provide schooling 
for girls and low pensions for the elderly. 
With $4 billion over fifteen years we can not 
only reduce demographic pressure but halt 
population growth, 
W [5 there anything we can do to control 
industrial pollution? 
— Not much. Carbon dioxide is the big 
problem. We are going to suffocate because 
of carbon dioxide. As you know, it stimulates 
breathing, and we shall all end up panting to 
death if amounts of carbon dioxide continue 
to increase. This increase is the result of a mis- 
guided energy policy. What's more, we have 
preferred to invest enormous sums in nuclear 
energy produced by fission rather than by 
fusion, which is clean. But nuclear energy 
produced by fusion makes it possible to have 
the bomb! 
There are other, more “picturesque” 
forms of pollution. Planet Earth is now sur- 
rounded by a girdle of fragments of broken 
satellites which move at the speed of a bullet 
and will eventually prevent any attempt to 
reach outer space. 
To manage nature a certain amount of 
wisdom is needed. Perhaps one day, taking 
long-term factors into account, we shall suc- 
ceed in managing nature as we now do when 
we create a pretty garden. But let's get back 
to the mosquitoes. For the last ten years I have 
owned a house in the country. When I first 
went there, there were swallows, robins and

mosquitoes. Today the mosquitoes have gone, 
but so have the swallows, the grasshoppers and 
the butterflies. The crops have been sprayed 
with pesticides from the air, and so the insects 
have been almost totally wiped out. If we 
carry on like this, children will never see a 
swallow, a dragontly or a butterfly. Well done! 
W Perhaps you could find a more hopeful note 
on which to end this conversation? 
— Real interest in environmental problems 
began in 1988 when the American magazine 
Time featured planet Earth on its cover, and 
titled it “Planet of the Year” instead of its 
usual “man of the year”. 
In July 1989, the leaders of the seven great 
industrial nations devoted a third of the time 
at their annual summit and twenty-three pages 
of the report to environmental problems. 
Later a meeting was held at The Hague and 
there were others too. At long last people were 
realizing that the danger was global and that 
everyone was threatened. 
This realization on the part of world 
leaders has been encouraged by powerful pres- 
sure from public opinion all over the world. 
The combination of these two forces, at the 
top and at the grassroots, should lead to the 
beginning of a solution. I hope that this is a 
sufficiently hopeful note on which to conclude!

### 90243: A Partnership with nature

14 
A partnership with nature by Michel Batisse 
F. centuries ago, the discovery of the New World proved that the Earth is round. And 
therefore finite, Paradoxically, the immense extent of the lands thus revealed enabled human 
beings to persist until our own times in the mistaken belief that the wealth of nature was 
inexhaustible and that they could continue with impunity to increase their numbers and multiply 
their needs indefinitely. 
The truth is that the Earth's resources are still considerable, but the race is on between 
these needs—vital or superfluous—and the means of satisfying them. In spite of scientific 
breakthroughs and the wonders of technology we are far from sure of winning this race. The 
rampant population growth that is still going on, especially in the poor countries, and the 
frenetic consumption of material goods and energy, especially in the rich countries, combine in 
a model of economic development which weighs too heavily on all the components of our 
environment and is not “sustainable”. 
This issue of the Courier, by seeking to provide some Insights into the manifestations of 
this environmental crisis, shows that the latter is equally a crisis of development. Environment 
and development: the two faces of a single dilemma in the pursuit of human destiny, the 
subject of the United Nations Conference which will be held at Rio de Janeiro in June 1992. 
This is a subject UNESCO knows well and one with which it has been concerned since its 
inception. It was under UNESCO's auspices that the International Union for the Conservation of 
Nature was founded in 1948. Around the same time UNESCO launched a scientific programme 
for the study and use of arid regions. In 1961 the Intergovernmental Oceanographic 
Commission was established in UNESCO in order to promote worldwide co-operation in the 
study of the seas, their resources, their protection and their influence on the life of the planet. 
At the same time study was organized on the Earth's crust, its wealth and the natural hazards 
associated with it. In 1964 the International Hydrological Decade was launched to further 
knowledge and management of the water resources of all countries. Finally, in 1968, UNESCO 
organized a conference on the rational use and conservation of the resources of the biosphere, 
from which sprang the interdisciplinary programme on Man and the Biosphere (MAB) which is 
today at the centre of UNESCO activities related to the environment, 
In 1972 the United Nations Conference at Stockholm created a new wave of interest in 
environmental questions, both in public opinion and in governments, encouraging UNESCO to 
persevere with its international scientific programmes. It also invited UNESCO to promote and 
strengthen environmental education in schools and universities. At the same time, the adoption 
of the Convention on the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage affirmed the dual 
nature of our common heritage and the indispensability of international co-operation in 
conserving the great symbols of this heritage. 
UNESCO has thus long been a place of convergence for all those approaches which 
attempt, through education, science and culture, to reconcile development and environment, 
and to restore the original partnership between man and nature. 
However, the efforts made so far, both at the national and the international level, have 
proved less than adequate. The enterprise will need time to bear fruit. It calls for a thorough 
revision of ways of thinking and economic mechanisms which are deeply entrenched in the 
industrialized countries and mare or less accepted as models in the others, as well as a radical 
change in habits and attitudes which will be felt by many as a sacrifice. It prescribes that short- 
term preoccupations should no longer obstruct long-term imperatives, and involves taking as 
precautionary measures unpopular decisions which are not based on absolute certainties. It calls 
for the reshaping of over-compartmentalized institutions and far-reaching changes in investment 
priorities. It means the rich countries agreeing to increase their aid to the poor countries for 
taking the environment into account (what is known as “‘additionality”), and the latter agreeing 
in exchange to change the direction of certain development projects to protect the environment 
(the principle of “conditionality”). It requires the adoption of a new form of economic 
accountancy which takes into account hitherto ignored values such as pure air, clean water, wild 
animals and landscapes. It requires that each of us should realize what is at stake, examine our 
behaviour and set an example. Without delay. w Dust-storm in Ethiopia.

### 90244: The Citizen and the environment

The citizen and the environment 
by Claude Villeneuve 
What the individual can do to help maintain 
the planet’s life-support systems 
T. scientific community today produces a 
flow of reports, hypotheses and observations 
which show that our constant assaults on the 
environment are jeopardizing the world’s poten- 
tial for development. It is even said that the sur- 
vival of the human race 1s threatened. Faced with 
these planetary problems, it is hard for the ordi- 
nary citizen not to feel in the presence of the Four 
Horsemen of the Apocalypse. 
We are starting to feel the effects of the by- 
products of the very same technologies that have 
enabled us to increase our lifespan and improve 
our quality of life. Both the causes and the victims 
of environmental degradation, we are learning 
with amazement that we live in an increasingly 
complex and fragile world. 
The transformations we have imposed on the 
biosphere are so far-reaching that immediate 
action must be taken to prevent their catastrophic 
effects from posing insoluble problems for the 
next generation. What can ordinary people do in 
the course of their daily lives to help solve these 
problems instead of making matters worse? 
WHAT IS SUSTAINABLE 
DEVELOPMENT? 
Many environmental problems are becoming 
increasingly global in scale, transcending frontiers 
and national jurisdictions and eluding the respon- 
sibility of individuals and nations. 
Today’s technologies are far more advanced 
than those of a few decades ago, but we are get- 
ting dangerously close to the limits of technolog- 
ical efficiency. Greater and greater efforts are 
required to make relatively insignificant progress, 
both in the production of goods and in the fight 
against pollution. 
Furthermore, world population is rapidly 
increasing, and under the influence of the mass 
media consumer expectations are getting much 
higher. Although the resources of the biosphere 
still have considerable potential for development, 
the limits of its productivity will be reached in 
the foreseeable future. 
Sustainable development is based on respon- 
sible management of resources so that the 
interests of future generations are protected while 
current needs are met. This is a stimulating 
challenge both for individuals and communities 
and it must be accepted immediately, for the 
longer the necessary decisions are put off, the 
harder they become. 
BUILT-IN OBSOLESCENCE 
The spectacular increase in industrial production 
that followed the Second World War improved 
living conditions around the world but also 
whetted appetites for material goods of all kinds. 
Industry provided a mass market with manufac- 
tured products at affordable prices. More and 
more goods were turned out at lower and lower 
prices, creating jobs and enabling people to buy 
more. Supply encouraged demand. 
This situation could not last for ever. To sus- 
tain demand, products had obsolescence built into 
them. Advertising and marketing techniques that 
associated such goods with an image of happiness 
proved exceptionally successful. Unfortunately,

### 90244: The Citizen and the environment

however, accumulation of possessions does not 
guarantee contentment, nor is it an end in itself. 
On the other hand, the production of goods 
that are not intended to last is a waste of energy 
and natural resources, and creates volumes of 
waste that are harmful to the environment. Every 
American citizen, for example, throws away a ton 
of domestic garbage each year. In highly deve- 
loped consumer societies, this refuse, which con- 
sists mainly of useless packaging, constitutes one 
of today’s most critical environmental problems. 
It is perhaps in the handling of domestic 
waste that the individual can be most effective 
in the struggle against environmental degradation. 
By choosing products that are either less pack- 
aged or less polluting, he or she can influence the 
attitudes of industry. 
Cars are among the most important of the 
ephemeral products of the consumer society, and 
many environmental problems are linked to their 
excessive production and use. In North America, 
for example, it is estimated that they account for 
nearly 40 per cent of total energy consumption. 
Using the car less is one of the first suggestions 
to make to the citizen to reduce pressure on the 
environment. 
World population is currently growing at the 
rate of 170 persons a minute, the equivalent of 
the population of Canada every three months. 
Environmentalists are alarmed by the increase, 
and with good reason. 
First of all there is an ethical obligation to 
feed, clothe and house all these new citizens of 
the world. At present we do this rather badly, 
because of inequalities in the distribution of 
natural resources. Second, everyone in the plane- 
tary village wants to enjoy the benefits of the con- 
sumer societies of the industrialized world. 
Unfortunately, in the present state of ecological 
knowledge, high North American and European 
levels of consumption of natural resources do not 
seem accessible to everyone in the world. 
Many writers, including the French 
agronomist René Dumont, point out that for all 
the planet to consume energy at North American 
rates, we should have to increase oil production 
threefold, natural gas production sevenfold, and 
coal output tenfold, as well as multiplying the

This prospect, which would cause us to revise 
estimates of how long reserves of fossil fuels will 
last, is terrifying from an environmental point of 
view. The pollution caused by the production and 
use of the necessary energy resources would 
increase amounts of acid rain, greenhouse gases 
and nuclear wastes to intolerable levels. 
Yet every human being ought to have the 
right to live in comfort and security. Sustainable 
development therefore involves reducing birth- 
rates, where these are high, both in rich and poor 
countries. 
Controlling the birth-rate is first and fore- 
most a matter for individuals, but it must also 
be supported by society as a whole, and the com- 
munity should invest in the education and wel- 
fare of children who have already been born 
before encouraging parents to bring others into 
the world.

OF ENVIRONMENTAL 
LITERACY 
Finally, an unprecedented effort must be made 
at local, regional and global levels to teach people 
about the environment so that all the citizens of 
the world can assume the responsibilities incum- 
bent on them in maintaining the planet’s life- 
support systems. 
The fact is that we are all educated 
ignoramuses. Instead of the well-formed mind 
praised by the essayist Michel de Montaigne, most 
educational systems, under the constraints of 
competition, turn out wellstuffed brains. Our 
knowledge is increasingly specialized and frag- 
mented among individuals who may be compe- 
tent in one field but are virtually ignorant in 
others. Most of today’s decision-makers are 
produced by educational systems that leave little 
space for extra-curricular discovery. Citizens too 
know little of the processes that provide them 
with the means to survive. 
Yet informed action on environmental 
matters demands at least some basic knowledge 
of the way in which ecosystems work and an 
awareness of man’s place in the biosphere. 
Environmental education is one of the keys to 
sustainable development. A pathway to environ- 
mental literacy, it is also the vector of the new 
ethic needed to redefine the relationship between 
humankind and the biosphere. 
Environmental education must therefore be 
made generally available in schools and other 
educational institutions, so that citizens and offi- 
cials can introduce an ecological dimension into 
decision-making. 
It must start with the fact that there are limits 
to the capacity of the biosphere, and that human 
actions can alter it both at the local and the global 
levels in ways that are harmful to our health and 
safety. Teachers must also point out that the 
development of every human being depends on 
the state of his or her environment, and that no 
generation can arrogate to itself the right to des- 
troy elements necessary for the survival of the 
next. 
The challenge of sustainable development 
may well be the most important we have ever 
had to face. We now have extraordinary scien- 
tific instruments for predicting the evolution of 
the environment. Will we be wise enough to 
avoid catastrophe while continuing to improve 
the quality of life for humankind as a whole? Or 
will we be led to crisis by economic models that 
encourage us to believe that the infinite exists in 
a finite world? 
These are questions science cannot answer. 
It is up to each of us to take up the cause. W

### 90245: Rwanda: land of a thousand hills

Rwanda: fand of a thousand hills 
by Char les Jeanner ot How a small country in the heart of Africa is safeguarding 
the natural capital on which its survival depends 
S. UATED in the heart of Africa, Rwanda is a 
relatively small country (26,338 square 
kilometres), yet with nearly eight million inhabi- 
tants it has the highest population density of any 
nation in Africa south of the Sahara. 
The relief of the land is uneven. A chain of 
volcanoes in the north gives way in the east and 
south to wooded savannah and plateaux dotted 
with innumerable hills. The west is dominated 
by the Zaire-Nile watershed, a group of rugged 
mountain ranges dissected by deep valleys. It is 
hardly surprising that Rwanda is known as the 
land of a thousand hills. 
Demographic pressure, the smallness of the 
country and the growing scarcity of land com- 
bine with a shortage of natural resources and a 
land-locked position to make Rwanda a test-case 
for all the knottiest problems of sustainable 
development. The principal objectives of this 
largely agricultural country have always been to 
achieve self-sufficiency in food while also creating 
jobs and wealth by encouraging the production 
of goods to increase national purchasing power. 
THE ENVIRONMENT: 
A NATIONAL 
PREOCCUPATION 
Even though Rwanda lives under the constant 
threat of food shortages, more than 10 per cent 
of its territory 1s given over to nature reserves 
of great importance. These include the Virunga 
National Park in the north of the country, the 
home of the last mountain gorillas, and in the 
south the Nyungwe Forest, which besides 
providing a habitat for certain rare species of 
monkey 1s also the largest stretch of high primary 
forest left in Africa—and now one of the last. 
Protecting these reserves is vital for Rwanda’s 
ecological and hydrological balance, as well as for 
the biological diversity of its ecosystems. But a 
policy of conservation can also be justified 
economically in terms of the potential it creates 
for an intelligently-run tourist industry that will 
not harm the nation’s extraordinary flora and 
fauna. |

### 90245: Rwanda: land of a thousand hills

20 
As a result of the soaring population, the 
borders of the reserves are being steadily 
infiltrated by poachers and people seeking food. 
Measures envisaged to protect the ecological 
heritage include plans to create natural barriers 
of vegetation as well as to increase research, 
improve surveillance and launch publicity cam- 
paigns to make people aware of the need to 
preserve areas vital to the nation’s ecological 
survival. 
Big efforts are being made to improve and 
restore the ecological heritage. A reforestation 
campaign launched over twenty-five years ago 
won widespread popular support and has been 
an undeniable success. Since 1973 a National Tree 
Day, marked by plantings across the country, has 
also reflected the need for a reforestation strategy. 
The planting of new forests has provided Rwanda 
with an important renewable resource, supplying 
the materials for a timber industry that, although 
still small and decentralized, has great potential 
for the future. 
Other year-long campaigns have also been 
launched in support of agriculture. There has 
been a Soil Conservation Year, an Organic 
Manure Year, a Year of the Struggle against 
Erosion—all of them aimed at boosting efforts to 
achieve self-sufficiency in food. 
THE THREAT 
TO AGRICULTURE 
The agricultural sector, which employs 93 per 
cent of the working population, consists 
primarily of highly productive smallholdings, 
three-quarters of which are less than one and a 
half hectares. Rwanda has neither large estates nor 
the rural proletariat that goes with them, and 
most agricultural products, even the so-called 
industrially produced commodities such as coffee, 
tea and pyrethrum, are grown on these small 
family properties. One side-effect of this is that 
income in the rural areas is relatively evenly dis- 
tributed. 
Until quite recently, Rwanda produced 
agricultural surpluses, thanks to a policy that 
guaranteed minimum prices for foodstuffs, the 
introduction of new plant varieties and species, 
accelerated crop rotation, and a highly effective 
saving and loans system. 
Other factors also played a part. The climate 
of Rwanda usually permits two and sometimes 
even three harvests a year. The country is socially 
and linguistically homogeneous, and has no 
geopolitical commitments to distract it from the 
problems of its own survival. There are no 
natural resources to attract speculation. The 
farming population firmly resists any threats to 
its livelihood, while not being averse to innova- 
tion. Politically, the nation is enviably stable. 
Unfortunately, however, in the last few years 
things have taken a turn for the worse. Acceler- 
ating population growth is partly responsible, but 
a growing number of external factors have also 
been to blame. 
Unusual weather conditions, including 
drought and torrential rain, have exposed the fra- 
gility of Rwanda’s overburdened agricultural 
system, which now seemingly exploits every 
square metre of available land. Disaster is never 
far away. Overintensive farming and the lack of 
new land are the principal constraints that, under 
the pressure of an expanding population, have 
pushed Rwandese agriculture towards breaking- 
point. Several parts of the country suffered food 
shortages in 1989. 
One of Rwanda’s advantages has actually 
become a handicap. The widespread dispersal of 
the population, which helped save the country 
from rampant urbanization and the proliferation 
of shanty-towns, is now synonymous with waste. 
Sub-divided into ever tinier plots as a result of 
the prevailing system of inheritance, the small- 
holdings have become too small to produce 
reasonably large surpluses. Systematic over- 
cropping has reduced soil fertility, which had 
previously remained high thanks to a carefully 
supervised system of fallowing. Worse still, suc- 
cessive falls in the price of coffee—the nation’s 
principal export crop, providing the foreign cur- 
rency needed to pay for imports—have reduced

NEW ECOLOGICAL 
IMPERATIVES 
Without an effective demographic policy that 
would combine family planning with a 
programme to optimize land use, the existing 
system may eventually break down. In any case, 
will it be possible to increase agricultural produc- 
tion substantially and permanently without 
harming the environment? 
Various factors could help. New chemical fer- 
tilizers and other products must be introduced 
to replace essential minerals the soil has lost. 
Liming will be a priority, since Rwanda possesses 
important lime deposits. The import of inorganic 
fertilizers is a recent innovation, and remarkable 
efforts are being made to optimize their use, 
notably by applying them in conjunction with 
organic manure. 


### 90245: Rwanda: land of a thousand hills

Rwanda’s only unused land consists of 
marshes which play a fundamental role in 
regulating the country’s hydrological system. 
Developing this marshland will pose complex 
technological, social, economic and institutional 
problems, but it offers the prospect of substan- 
tially increasing food supplies without harming 
the environment. 
The fact that half Rwanda’s agricultural land 
slopes at an angle of 25 degrees or more raises a 
particularly serious problem. The most widely 
used techniques of soil conservation, such as 
planting hedges or digging ditches to counter ero- 
sion, do not work on terrain where the angle of 
declivity exceeds 21 degrees. Consequently much 
hope and enthusiasm have been invested in a new 
system of “radical” terracing whereby the slopes 
are transformed into horizontal platforms which

slope slightly against the hillside and thus inter- 
cept drainage water and encourage it to soak into 
the soil. This reduces and in some cases even 
eliminates land-loss and provides crops with max- 
imal nutrition. 
Besides rehabilitating land that was previ- 
ously either badly eroded, under-exploited or 
even regarded as unusable, the terraces also main- 
tain soil fertility. Consequently, agricultural 
output rises almost immediately. A property at 
Kisaro that formerly produced one ton of 
potatoes yielded a bumper crop of 25 tons after 
terracing. Plots where wheat would not grow 
now yield two tons per hectare. These cases may 
be exceptional, but there is general agreement that 
terracing on average doubles the harvest without 
diminishing the precious natural capital of the 
soil. 
ENVIRONMENTALLY 
SOUND 
INDUSTRIALIZATION 
Bringing industry to Rwanda constitutes a real 
challenge, in view of the fragility of the environ- 
ment, which could be disastrously affected by cer- 
tain kinds of pollution. Even so, industrialization 
is a priority, not just to add value to the nation’s 
resources by turning them into finished products 
but also to absorb the surplus labour of the rural 
areas and to create additional purchasing power 
to buy the foodstuffs and other commodities 
produced there. Even so, it has taken consider- 
able inventiveness to identify genuinely 
promising opportunities. 
Because importing raw materials for manufac- 
ture is prohibitively expensive for this land- 
locked country, priority has been given to small 
and medium-sized enterprises that are considered 
ecologically safe, such as timber and agro- 
business. 
Other industries are also concerned with the 
need to safeguard the environment. The Ruliba 
brickworks at Kigali uses dried papyrus reed and 
coffee-bean casings as fuel. Rwanda will soon be 
producing corrugated sheets of tarred papyrus to 
serve as roofing. Not only will these last longer 
than imported tiles, they also consume a locally 
grown raw material that is indefinitely renewable, 
and will thus save a considerable amount of for- 
eign currency. Rwanda’s national brewery uses 
methane gas from Lake Kivu as its energy source. 
Other industries, notably cement manufacture, 
are expected to follow suit. 
Can Rwanda be described as a success-story 
of sustainable development? It is still too early 
to say. But the country is moving in the right

direction by seeking the tools of development in 
its own environment and ensuring that its natural 
22 capital remains entirely in its own hands. NW 
Energy for a sustainable worl 
by José Goldemberg 
The search for new energy sources to replace 
exhaustible and environmentally harmful fossil fuels 
T. concept of sustainability is a highly com- 
plex one, particularly where energy matters are 
concerned. We can only hope to approach any- 
thing like absolute sustainability by the use of 
renewable energy resources such as hydro- 
electricity; but even hydro-electricity involves 
problems such as the silting up of dams or the 
secondary environmental damage dams can cause, 
which makes it less than a hundred per cent sus- 
tainable. 
On the other hand, some fossil fuels, such as 
coal, are quite abundant and even at their present 
rate of consumption will last for several centu- 
ries, when other sources of energy might become 
available. 
The Report of the World Commission on 
Environment and Development (1987) defined 
sustainable development as development that 
“meets the needs of the present without com- 
promising the ability of future generations to 
meet their own needs”. And this, perhaps, con- 
tains the hint that we need to introduce the 
notion of “depletion rates” into any discussion 
of sustainability. This opens the way to the estab- 
lishment of compromises between what is 
desirable in principle and what is practical in 
terms of the realities of everyday life. Such com- 
promises are unavoidable when a choice has to 
be made between preserving resources and the 
needs of survival and development. 
If energy use were to be considered in con- 
formity with the strict definition of sustainable 
development, this would mean that man should 
rely exclusively on renewable sources of energy. 
This was the case before the industrial revolution, 
when fuelwood, used in a renewable fashion, was 
basically the only source of energy. 
With population growth and increased 
demand for energy, however, exhaustible fossil 
fuels came into use and became the predominant 
energy source. In the industrialized countries 
today, fuelwood represents less than one per cent 
of total energy consumption, the remaining 
demand being met basically by fossil fuels—coal, 
oil and gas.

### 90246: Energy for a sustainable world

This is clearly an unsustainable form of 
development, since the depletion of existing 
reserves of fossil fuels is proceeding at a fast pace 
and will certainly “compromise the ability of 
future generations to meet their own [energy] 
needs.” 
Depletion, and eventual exhaustion, of stocks 
of fossil fuels are not the only problems. Their 
use entails other problems which affect the sus- 
tainability of the system in which we live—the 
emission of carbon dioxide and other gases is the 
major cause of atmospheric pollution and global 
warming and thus poses a threat to the way of 
life of future generations. 
In the less developed countries, fuelwood still 
represents an appreciable fraction of total energy 
consumption. If this resource were properly. 
managed, by the systematic planting of trees to 
replace those cut down, it could become an inex- 
haustible energy source. This is far from being 
the case and we are witnessing intensive deforesta- 
tion which is consuming more than ten million 
hectares of forest—mainly tropical forest—every 
year. The problem is most acute in Africa, but 
is also very significant in south-east Asta and Latin 
America. 
On a worldwide scale, only hydro-electricity 
can today be considered a sustainable energy 
resource—it cannot be depleted and it does not 
produce greenhouse gases. However, only ten per 
cent of the total energy used in the world comes 
from this source and, although the potential of 
existing untapped sites is considerable, they are 
unevenly distributed around the world. 
Three approaches can be adopted to attain 
energy sustainability: 
» extend the life of existing fossil fuels as much 
as possible by wise use; 
e increase the use of other, little-used renewable 
energy sources such as wind power, solar thermal 
power, solar thermo-electric power, photovol- 
taics and biomass; 
e increase the use of nuclear power. 
Before the two oil crises of the 1970s, growth 
in energy consumption, based on the use of fossil 
fuels, seemed to be part of the way of life of deve- 
loped countries and an example to be copied and 
a goal to be attained by all. The projection of 
future energy consumption reflected those expec- 
tations and predicted a sustained growth of at least 
three per cent a year, which meant that total 
energy consumed would quadruple in less than 
fifty years. 
The two oil crises led to a re-examination of 
the situation and to moves to reduce what was 
seen as a dangerous over-reliance on oil. Two 
major energy studies were conducted during the 
1970s—one by the Energy Research Group,

electric power station on 
Brazil's Tocantins river.

for Applied Systems Analysis, Vienna. Both 
studies had one long-term objective in 
common—to shift from oil to more abundant 
energy resources such as natural gas, coal and 
nuclear energy while maintaining a significant 
growth In energy consumption. 
Their approach was to estimate future energy 
demand on the basis of assumptions about future 
demographic and economic trends, to make 
historical correlations between such trends and 
energy demand, and to match this demand to 
a new mix of energy supplies. However, the 
scenarios they produced had the defect of 
projecting a perpetuation of the energy consump- 


### 90246: Energy for a sustainable world

tion imbalance between the developed and the 
developing world and thus of implying contain- 
ment of the legitimate development expectations 
of the less developed countries. 
In 1988, in his book Energy for a Sustainable 
World, the author of this article explored the pos- 
sibilities of modern, energy-efficient technologies 
for meeting the energy needs of the world popu- 
lation in the year 2020. This study concluded that 
widespread use of new technologies could enable 
people in the developing world to attain a level 
of amenities comparable to that of the countries 
of Western Europe in the middle of the 1970s and 
the industrialized countries to reduce their per 
capita energy consumption by almost half. Taken 
all together he foresaw total energy consumption 
in the year 2020 remaining approximately the 
same as in 1980, but with a much higher level 
of comfort for the great majority of the world 
population. 
Unfortunately, this projection did not really 
correspond to a sustainable situation because 
fossil fuels still represented the great majority of 
the energy needed and carbon dioxide emissions 
would continue to poison the atmosphere signifi- 
cantly. It did, however, demonstrate that it was 
possible to stabilize energy consumption at 
existing levels while extending considerably the 
life of fossil fuel resources. 
A more recent study by R.H. Williams, of 
the Center for Energy and Environmental 
Studies, Princeton University, published in 1989, 
is more optimistic about the possibility of greater 
use of renewable fuels which evolving technolo- 
gles seem to be making both feasible and econom- 
ically viable. 
More efficient methods of using fuelwood 
and of converting other biomass fuels (basically 
vegetation and crop residues) into electricity 
through gasification and the use of modern gas 
turbine generators, are rapidly being introduced. 
The conversion of sugar-cane into ethanol as an 
energy source for electricity generation is gaining 
ground and there are important new develop- 
ments in wind, solar thermo-power and pho- 
tovoltaics. 
Re-examination of all these possibilities in the 
Williams study led to the conclusion that by the 
year 2025 renewable energy sources could 
account for more than half the energy used in 
developing countries. 
THE NUCLEAR 
OPTION 
Finally, we have to consider the possible contri- 
bution of nuclear energy to the establishment of 
a sustainable world energy system. Nuclear 
energy does not emit carbon dioxide and with 
the development of breeder reactors sufficient 
nuclear fuel for the operation of thousands of 
nuclear power plants is guaranteed for centuries 
to come. Here theoretically is an ideal sustainable 
energy source. 
The problem with nuclear energy lies else- 
where. Even with the use of the most advanced 
technology, accidents do happen, as the Cher- 
nobyl disaster so tragically demonstrated. In addi- 
tion, there seems to be no solution to the problem 
of disposing of radio-active waste in a manner 
compatible with maintaining a “clean” environ- 
ment. These problems, coupled with the danger 
of nuclear proliferation for military purposes, 
_make the nuclear solution unacceptable to public 
opinion in many countries. L

### 90248: Hungary: the pitfalls of growth

Since 1990 Hungary has been trying to redress an economy 
long tilted in favour of pollution-prone heavy industry 
A. the end of World War II, Hungary found 
itself politically and economically attached to the 
Communist bloc. From the beginning of the 
1950s, a system of central planning and manage- 
ment was gradually developed. Companies came 
into State ownership, co-operative farms were 
formed and most of the service sector was 
brought under the control of the State or of co- 
operatives. 
Quantitative growth at all costs became the 
watchword of industrial production. The 
development of heavy industry was given pri- 
ority, energy-intensive technologies spread and 
raw materials were used with scant regard for 
economy. Nevertheless, the quantitative growth 
that occurred between 1950 and 1975 made it pos- 
sible to raise the standard of living and well-being 
of the population as compared to the levels of 
the pre-war period. 
After the first oil crisis, however, the limita- 
tions of the centrally planned system, its inability 
to adapt and its lack of competitiveness, soon 
became apparent. Failure to modernize the infras- 
tructure and to introduce computer technology 
meant that Hungary, like the other countries of 
Eastern Europe, began increasingly to lag behind 
Western Europe. The position was made even 
worse by increasing external debts and the 
slowing down of economic development. 
This falling behind in the economic field was 
matched by a delay on the part of political leaders 
in East European countries, including Hungary, 
in recognizing the importance of environmental 
protection. Although Hungarian scientists par- 
ticipated in UNESCQ’s Man and the Biosphere 
programme from its inception, government agen- 
cies took six to seven years to react to the 
environmental challenges raised. 
During the 1980s, Hungary faced growing 
economic difficulties. During the decade 1977 to 
1987 the country’s external debt grew from $43 
million to $18,957 million. Various economic 
reforms were carried out and central control of 
planning and management was gradually reduced, 
but this was not sufficient to lead to a smoothly 
functioning, market-oriented economy. So when 25

Sciences in Budapest and a 
member of the Executive 
Board of the International 
Council of Scientific Unions 
(ICSU). He is also a member of 
the editorial advisory board of 
the World Resources Institute 
in Washington D.C. From 1984 
to 1287 he was a member of 
the United Nations World 
Commission on Environment 
and Development (the 
Brundtland Commission). 
 
the importance of environmental protection was 
finally recognized, Hungary was already in a 
period of economic decline and it was not pos- 
sible to make the big investment needed to 
replace polluting technologies or the energy- 
intensive and raw-material-intensive structure of 
industry. 
The period 1989-1990 saw the beginning of 
radical, but peaceful, political change. In spring 
1990, free elections were held and with a new 
Parliament and a new government Hungary has 
set out on the road to parliamentary democracy, 
with a multi-party system, a market-oriented 
economy and independence from military blocs. 
However, the new government inherited the 
old environmental problems and it takes a long 
time to change old production structures. 
Nevertheless, data on the state of the environ- 
ment have been made public and municipalities 
and voluntary environmental groups are being 
encouraged to play a larger part in pollution con- 
trol by means of public debates and hearings. 
Preparations for the 1992 United Nations 
Conference on Environment and Development - 
have begun. A National Commission has been 
set up, and an action programme for the solution 
of local and national environmental problems has 
been drawn up with the aim of arousing public 
awareness. A panel of high-ranking experts has 
been formed with the task of working out, on 
the basis of the recommendations of the Rio Con- 
ference, a Hungarian strategy for the attainment 
of sustainable development. 
What, then, is the present position in key 
policy sectors and what changes can be expected? 
ENERGY POLICY 
Energy policy is a key issue in the Hungarian 
debate on environmental protection. For decades, 
energy has been wasted on a vast scale in Eastern 
Europe, including Hungary. Owing to the use of 
out-of-date technologies, energy consumption per 
unit of product (e.g. per ton of steel or per ton 
of wheat) is on average 40 to 50 per cent higher 
than in the Western European countries and the 
proportion of energy-intensive sectors within 
industry is high. Energy consumption per capita, 
for example, in Austria and Hungary is practi- 
cally the same, but, in relation to Gross National 
Product, Hungary consumes five times as much 
energy as Austria. 
Energy policy for the future has two main 
objectives: to increase the efficient use of energy 
and to reduce dependence on external sources of 
energy. At present there is intense public debate 
as to whether or not a second nuclear power plant 
should be built, and if not, on what primary fuel 
additional electrical energy will be based. This is 
a matter of great public concern because, 
although technological reconstruction of some 
existing power plants has led to some improve- 
ment with regard to the emission of pollutants, 
44 per cent of the population live in areas where, 
at certain times of the year, the quality of the air 
does not meet minimum health standards. 
INDUSTRY 
Transition to sustainable industrial development 
and to market mechanisms entails considerable 
economic and social change. One example of this 
is that the previously established principle that 
“the polluter pays” seems to be being replaced 
by the new principle that “the polluter pays and 
the consumer pays”. Another is that because of 
rising prices of raw materials and energy, coupled 
with decreasing government support, heavy 
industry is in crisis, with the unfortunate social 
consequence that unemployment has increased to 
an unprecedented degree. Paradoxically this is also 
an environmentally favourable phenomenon, since 
it means a decline in a sector of industrial activity 
which pollutes the environment the most. 
Privatization of Hungarian companies has 
begun, mainly with the help of foreign capital. 
This will have a positive effect on the moderni- 
zation of technological processes and thus will 
benefit the environment. Some environmen- 
talists, however, are worried about this, since they 
fear that polluting processes that are no longer 
permitted in the European Community countries 
will be transferred to Hungary. It is the gener- 
ally accepted opinion in Hungary that industrial 
"development must be judged on the basis of Euro- 
pean norms. 
AGRICULTURE 
Hungary’s climate and soil are suitable for inten- 
sive agricultural production. In the 1980s, two- 
thirds of the country’s agricultural produce was 
sold on the internal market, ensuring an ample

### IGNORE

food supply (exceptional in Eastern Europe), 
while one third was exported. However, inten- 
sive soil cultivation and the use of large amounts 
of artificial fertilizers and pesticides, as well as 
concentrated animal husbandry, have led to some - 
degradation of the environment. Damage caused 
by wind and water erosion affects some 40 per 
cent of the land, a significant part of the ground- 
water contains an excess of nitrates, acidification 
of the soil can be observed on one third of the 
arable land and, as a result of irrigation, saliniza- 
tion has developed in many areas. 
Privatization of the land has begun and there 
will be considerable decentralization in both land 
use and animal husbandry in the coming years. 
On the whole this is expected to have favourable 
environmental effects, but problems may arise in 
ensuring the proper use of agro-chemicals. 
When Hungary joins the European Commu- 
nity (this 1s thought likely to occur in the second 
half of the 1990s), Hungarian agricultural exports 
will probably decrease. This will make it possible 
to shape the model of a low-energy-input 
agriculture. 


### 90248: Hungary: the pitfalls of growth

TRANSPORT 
Transport is one of the biggest sources of pollution 
in Hungary. Some 45 to 50 per cent of the carbon 
monoxide, 40 to 45 per cent of the nitrogen 
oxides and 90 per cent of the lead emitted into 
the air come from transport. Road transport has 
the greatest share in this emission with more than 
85 per cent, the railways being responsible for 12 
to 13 per cent and air transport for one to two 
per cent. The development of the means of mass 
transport is being given priority in the plans of 
both national and municipal authorities. 
NATURE CONSERVATION 
Some 626 hectares of Hungary’s total territory 
of 93,000 square kilometres are protected. 
Altogether there are four national parks, 44 pro- 
tected regions and 137 nature conservation areas. 
All the 2,500 caves, 415 plant species and 619 
animal species are protected. In addition there are 
877 locally protected areas. 
The national parks have been established 
partly in forest areas and partly in lands which 
are very valuable for nature conservation but not 
easily usable for agriculture. Some problems have 
arisen because the national parks are not all fully 
owned by the State authorities responsible for 
conservation. With the privatization of land, this 
problem 1s growing more acute. The general 
trend, however, is for protected nature conser- 
vation areas to remain under State ownership and 
for their exploitation (for logging, grazing, 
fishing, etc.) to be fully controlled by the nature 
conservation service. 
As can be seen from this short review, Hun- 
gary has inherited an onerous legacy from earlier 
regimes. Under new circumstances the intention 
is to adopt new methods to achieve sustainable 
development. Environment and development 
will figure jointly in the government's 
programme and an environmentally aware public 
will be there to encourage action and to ensure 
that the proper decisions are made. u

Boone a more environmentally stable future 
clearly requires some vision of that future. If not 
fossil fuels to power society, then what? If forests 
are no longer to be cleared to grow food, then 
how is a larger population to be fed? If a . 
throwaway culture leads inevitably to pollution 
and resource depletion, how can we satisfy our 
material needs? In sum, if the present path is so 
obviously unsound, what picture of the future 
can we use to guide our actions towards a global 
community that can endure? 
A sustainable society is one that satisfies its 
needs without jeopardizing the prospects of 
future generations. Unfortunately there are no 
existing models of sustainability. For the past 
several decades, most developing nations have 
aspired to the automobile-centred, fossil fuel- 
driven economies of the industrial West. But 
from the localized problems of intractable air pol- 
lution to the global threat of climate change, it 
is now clear that these societies are far from 
  
 
pL 
al 
  
durable; indeed they are rapidly bringing about 
their own demise. 
If the world is to achieve sustainability, this 
will have to be done within the next forty years. 
If we have not succeeded by then, environmental 
deterioration and economic decline are likely to 
be feeding on each other, pulling us into a down- 
ward spiral of social disintegration. Cur vision 
of the future therefore looks to the year 2030. 
One assumption we make about the future 
concerns population size. Current United 
Nations projections have the world headed for 
nearly nine billion people by the year 2030. This 
figure implies a doubling or tripling of the popu- 
lations of Ethiopia, India, Nigeria and scores of 
other countries where human numbers are 
already over-taxing natural support systems. We, 
however, assume a population of at most eight 
billion that will either be essentially stable or 
slowly declining towards a number the Earth can 
support comfortably and indefinitely. Either soci- 
eties will move quickly to encourage smaller fami- 
lies and bring birth-rates down, or rising death- - 
rates from hunger and malnutrition will check 
population growth. 
The humane path to sustainability by the

year 2030 therefore requires a dramatic drop in 
birth-rates. More countries will do as China and, 
most recently, Thailand have done—cut their 
population growth rates by half in a matter of 
years. As of 1990, thirteen European countries 
have stable or declining populations; by 2030, 
most countries are likely to be in that category. 
THE DAWN 
OF THE SOLAR AGE 
The world of 2030 will not be powered by coal, 
oil and natural gas. It is now well accepted that 
continuing heavy reliance on fossil fuels will cause 
catastrophic changes in climate. Avoiding this and 
eventually stabilizing the climate depend on cut- 
ting global carbon emissions to two billion tons, 
about one third of the current amount. Given 
projected population growth, the world in 2030 
will therefore have per capita carbon emissions 
that are one-eighth of the level of those in Western 
Europe today. 
The choice then becomes whether to make 
solar or nuclear power the centrepiece of energy 
systems. We believe societies will reject nuclear 
power because of its long list of economic, social 
and environmental liabilities. 
The late twentieth century is the dawn of the 
  
    
  
+ 
solar age. When it comes to solar technologies, 
today’s political leaders, still captivated by coal 
and nuclear power, are like those who in the 
eighteenth century were sceptical about the 
future of the steam engine. The glimmerings of 
the new age are already giving the lie to such 
sceptics. Some nations—Norway and Brazil, for 
example—already obtain over half their energy 
from renewable energy resources. And these 
resources are available in immense quantity. The 
United States Department of Energy estimates 
that the annual influx of currently accessible 
renewable resources in the United States is 250 
times the country’s annual use of energy. 
Solar power is by nature diverse; the mix of 
energy sources will reflect the climate and natural 
resources of each particular region. Northern 
Europe, for example, is likely to rely heavily on 
wind and hydropower. The economies of 
northern Africa and the Middle East may instead 
use direct sunlight. Japan and the Philippines will 
tap their abundant geothermal energy. And 
Southeast Asian economies will be powered 
largely by wood and agricultural wastes, along 
with sunshine. 
Due to the abundance of sunlight, direct con- 
version of solar energy will be the corner-stone

is sunshine available in great quantity, it is also 
more widely distributed than any other renew- 
able resource. By 2030, solar panels will heat most 
residential water around the world, following the 
model of Japan and Israel, which already use them 
extensively. A typical urban landscape will have 
thousands of collectors sprouting from roof-tops,

As they become economical, the completion 
of the solar revolution will be possible. All 
Third World villages could be electrified with 
this renewable source, with battery storage

Wind power is an indirect form of solar 
energy, generated by the Sun’s differential heating 
of the Earth’s atmosphere. The cost of wind 
energy fell by about 70 per cent during the 1980s, 
making it at Jeast 40 per cent cheaper than power 
from new nuclear plants in the United States and 
almost competitive with energy from new coal- 
fired power plants. 
Engineers are confident that they will soon 
have improved wind turbines that are economical 
not just in California’s blustery mountain passes, 
where some wind farmers are already generating 
$30,000 worth of electricity per hectare annually, 
but also in vast stretches of the US northern 
plains, on the North Sea coast of the United 
Kingdom and in central Europe. Among the 
other regions where major wind farm projects are 
now on the drawing boards are Germany and the 
State of Gujarat, in India. 
For hydropower, which now supplies 19 per 
cent of the world’s electricity, prospects for 
future growth are most promising in the Third 
World, where the undeveloped potential is still 
large. Small-scale projects are likely to be more 
appealing than the massive projects favoured by 
governments and international lending agencies 
in recent decades.

ENERGY FROM PLANTS 
Plants provide another means of capturing solar 
energy. Through photosynthesis they convert 
sunlight into biomass that can be burned. Until 
the industrial revolution, wood supplied most of 
the world’s energy. Today it still provides 12 per 
cent of the total, chiefly in the form of firewood 
and charcoal in developing countries. 
One promising approach to augmenting 
biomass energy capacity is to grow energy crops 
on marginal lands not currently used for food. 
Land that is too steeply sloping or not sufficiently 
fertile or well watered for crops might support 
trees that could be harvested periodically. The 
wood could then be burned directly in a wood- 
fired power plant or converted to ethanol. The 
Solar Energy Research Institute has already deve- 
loped a process that brings the cost of wood- 
derived ethanol down to $1.35 per gallon. 
Virtually all Pacific rim countries, as well as 
those along East Africa’s Great Rift and the 
Mediterranean Sea, are well endowed with 
geothermal energy. Iceland, Indonesia and Japan 
are among the nations with the greatest poten- 
tial. Geothermal energy can provide not only 
electricity that can be transmitted over long dis- 
tances, but also direct heat for industries sited near 
the Earth’s major heat reservoirs. 
Getting global carbon emissions down to two 
billion tons a year requires vast improvements 
in energy efficiency. Fortunately, many of the 
Ab 
(54 
technologies to accomplish such reductions are 
already at hand and cost-effective. No technical 
breakthroughs are needed, for example, to double 
automobile fuel economy, triple the efficiency of 
lighting systems, or cut typical heating loads by 
75 per cent. Technologies developed in the 
decades ahead will undoubtedly allow even 
greater gains. 
By the year 2030, a much more diverse set 
of transportation options will exist. The typical 
European or Japanese city today is probably 
fairly indicative of this future. Highly developed 
rail and bus systems move people efficiently 
between home and work. In Tokyo, only 15 per 
cent of commuters drive cars to the office. 
Automobiles will undoubtedly still be in use 
four decades from now, but they will be fewer 
in number and their role will be smaller. Within 
cities, only clean hydrogen-powered vehicles are 
likely to be permitted and most of these will be 
highly efficient “city cars”. The energy to run 
them may well come from solar power plants. 
Families might rent efficient larger vehicles for 
vacations. 
The bicycle will also play a major role, as it 
already does in much of Asia and in some 
industrial-country towns and cities. There are 
already twice as many bicycles as cars worldwide. 
In the bicycle-centred transport system of the 
year 2030, the ratio could easily be as high as ten 
to one.

What flrture for Amazonia? 
Mw people in the industrialized countries 
would like Amazonia to be preserved exactly as it 
is, and transform it into a vast nature reserve. 
Some of these advocates of the non- 
development of Amazonia attach the highest pri- 
ority to safeguarding planet Earth and at the same 
time contrive to regard human beings as parasites. 
Others point out that the Amazonian forest plays 
a major role in counteracting the greenhouse 
effect, and wish to see it act as a gigantic filter 
so that 500 million cars can continue to consume 
fossil fuels. 
THE CURRENT 
CONTEXT 
The non-development of Amazonia is totally 
unacceptable both to the people who live in the 
region and to Brazilians in general. The gratui- 
tous advice handed out to the people on the spot 
may well be seen as a kind of ecological 
colonialism as long as the industrialized countries

of the North refuse to change their ways of life 
and patterns of consumption. 
Let these countries prove their sincerity by 
proposing to the United Nations Conference on 
Environment and Development a specific 
programme for the reduction of energy consump- 
tion in industrial societies. 
Let them also provide the countries of the 
South with access to the scientific and technical 
knowledge that is needed to develop the immense 
biological heritage of the Amazonian forest 
within a framework of sound ecological prin- 
ciples. For this long-term task, Brazil and the 
other countries of Amazonia need the capacity 
to carry out their own in situ research. 
For tropical countries biotechnology opens 
up considerable possibilities based on progress in 
the production of biomass and the range of 
products that can be derived from it. Eventually 
we may see the emergence of a new “plant-based 
industrial civilization”, a particularly interesting 
prospect for tropical countries. Mr. Monkombu

### 90250: What future for Amazonia?

S. Swaminathan, a former President of the Inter- 
national Union for Conservation of Nature and 
Natural Resources, believes that a new form of 
civilization based on the sustainable use of renew- 
able resources is not only possible but essential. 
The vision of this Indian scientist coincides with 
the intuitions of the Brazilian sociologist Gilberto 
Freyre, who in the 1960s founded a seminar on 
tropicology at Recife. 
However, at present biotechnology seems to 
be so effectively shielded by a wall of patents that 
people in many developing countries are won- 
dering whether it will not become an instrument 
for the recolonization of the South by the North. 
The industrialized countries would provide 
another token of their disinterestedness if they 
were to relax their position on patents and 
intellectual property rights, and establish more 
open forms of access to science and technology. 
In 1989 Mr. Rajiv Gandhi, then Prime 
Minister of India, suggested that a 0.1 per cent 
tax be levied on world revenue and its yield of 
$18 billion used to establish a world fund to 
finance research into environment-friendly tech- 
nologies, their purchase and their free distribu- 
tion to all interested countries. However, nothing 
came of this proposal, which relaunched the 
debate on the financing of environmental protec- 
tion and development. 
Another possible course of action would be to 
create a network linking Asian and African 
researchers to Brazilians and other Latin 
Americans who are seeking to harness the renew- 
able resources of humid tropical forest ecosystems 
to development, a process that should harmonize 
three objectives of what is known as 
ecodevelopment: 
* the promotion of greater social justice in the 
name of the ethical principle of synchronic 
solidarity, with development being regarded as 
a aivilization based on the equitable sharing of 
possessions; 
o self-development in harmony with nature 
rather than through domination of nature, in the 
name of the ethical principle of diachronic 
solidarity with future generations; 
* the pursuit of these two goals through a search 
for a kind of economic efficiency that is not res- 
tricted to a concept of business profitability 
which often takes no account of ecological and 
social costs. 
In addition to such measures, however, inter- 
national co-operation must primarily be directed 
at improving the general economic environment 
of Latin American countries. In other words solu- 
tions must be found to the problems of debt, 
terms of trade, and the reduction of protectionist 
barriers in the industrialized countries.

The internal challenges posed by the develop- 
ment of Brazilian Amazonia are as vast as the size 
of this immense area which has captured the 
imagination of so many and inspired so many 
exaggerations. 
DREAMS 
AND REALITIES 
There is a golden legend which portrays 
Amazonia as a region of fabulous wealth, a 
mirage which has lured generations of adven- 
turers. A variant of this legend, inspired by the 
philosophy of the Enlightenment and the expia- 
tory inclinations of our ethnologists, paints a pic- 
ture of noble savages living happily in perfect 
harmony with nature. 
There is also a black legend which describes 
Amazonia as a green, impenetrable hell, protected 
by tropical diseases which afflict all intruders. 
These contradictory pictures are reflected in 


### 90250: What future for Amazonia?

opposing conceptions of the region’s future. 
Some see Amazonia as the world’s last great eco- 
nomic frontier, a place of incalculable mineral, 
hydraulic and plant wealth. Others believe that 
the abundance of its vegetation is an illusion and 
that its soils are poor and subject to erosion as 
soon as the forest is felled. Haphazard exploita- 
tion of Amazonia’s mineral wealth and the 
growing number of big dams, combined with 
chaotic colonization leading to massive deforesta- 
tion, will rapidly turn Amazonia into a desert. 
What are the facts? 
A precondition for successful development is 
the abandonment of the dominant model of 
34 predatory exploitation of the region’s natural 
resources, a model which takes no account of 
social and environmental costs. The random pur- 
suit of growth is just as unacceptable as non- 
development. 
For twenty years or more, several factors 
combined to accelerate deforestation. These 
factors were: 
» geopolitical imperatives leading to the settling 
of Amazonia along purpose-built roads; 
e the idea that Amazonia could absorb rural 
refugees displaced by the modernization of 
agriculture in southern Brazil and by the persis- 
tence of anachronistic land-ownership structures 
in the northeast; 
® the decision to favour large-scale animal hus- 
bandry, which is quite unsuited to the natural 
conditions of Amazonia and leads to frenetic 
speculation in land, as well as hopes that the 
region’s mineral wealth could be used to alleviate 
the burden of debt; 
e the establishment in the duty-free zone at 
Manaus of a great industrial centre. 
As a result of these policies, now revised, 
Amazonia has lost between 300,000 and 400,000 
square kilometres of forest. 
There has also been rapid urbanization. Ten 
million of Amazonia’s 17 million population 
today live in cities (Manaus and Belém each have 
over 1 million inhabitants). There are many 
shanty-towns which are so exposed to the risk 
of epidemics that the living conditions of the 
people who live in them and in the cities 
undoubtedly constitute Amazonia’s most acute 
environmental problem today. 
Outside the urban centres the population

lives in widely scattered settlements along the 
banks of streams and rivers and practises a sub- 
sistence and gathering economy. The creation of 
“extractive reserves” has brought a measure of 
relief to the caboclos and seringueiros (peasant 
farmers who tap rubber), whose existence is 
threatened by land speculators. These people live 
in extremely precarious conditions which could 
be improved by more rational exploitation of the 
forest’s natural products, but this can only be 
envisaged as part of a long-term solution for the 
whole region. The seringuerros want their share of 
economic, social and cultural progress, which 
implies a dynamic vision of the transformation 
of the extractive reserves into poles of 
ecodevelopment. 
The indigenous populations, long the victims 
of adventurers and colonists, enjoy considerable 
rights under the Brazilian Constitution, and the 
Government has promised to earmark 80 million 
hectares of land for 250,000 of them throughout 
Brazil between now and 1993. 
A NEW STRATEGY 
The aim of Brazil's current environmental policy 
is to promote a strategy of ecodevelopment rather 
than a strategy of development at all costs. This 
is a laudable goal, but it will not be easy to 
achieve, either in Brazil or in the other Amazo- 


### 90250: What future for Amazonia?

nian countries. 
It must be accepted that ecodevelopment in 
Amazonia depends on policy changes outside the 
region. Land reform and reform in agricultural 
policy must be carried out in the rest of Brazil in 
order to reduce the flow of migrants to Amazonia. 
Likewise, forest resources must be protected by 
an ambitious reforestation programme elsewhere 
than Amazonia—the FLORAM Plan prepared by 
the Institute of Advanced Studies of the Univer- 
sity of Sdo Paulo proposes that 20 million hec- 
tares of forest be planted outside Amazonia in 
thirty years, at a cost of $20 billion. 
Within Amazonia, the first step is to divide 
this far from homogeneous region into some 
twenty sub-regions, each with its own strategy. 
The global problems of Amazonia call for solu- 
tions adapted to local ecological and cultura] con- 
ditions. Social diversity is a counterpart to bio- 
logical diversity. 
The main thrust of these efforts must be 
directed towards the rehabilitation of already 
deforested land and, as far as possible, to 
increasing the density of the population in these 
areas, so as to halt the advancing frontier of 
colonization and prevent further deforestation. 
Efforts must be made to create an archipelago of 
connected ‘‘development reserves” so as to 
guarantee the protection of virgin forest and the 
habitat of the indigenous population. Such an 
approach presents many difficulties, but it still 
seems more realistic than creating a proliferation 
of natural reserves. 
Agroforestry which makes judicious use of 
local plant species (especially the enormous poten- 
tial of fruit trees), aquaculture, high-yield agricul- 
ture and horticulture in the varzeas (highly fertile 
floodland), and small-scale animal husbandry are 
promising techniques. Knowledge of the environ- 
ment acquired in the course of the centuries by 
local populations may provide a useful starting 
point, whence the importance of ethno-ecological 
studies. 
Technical skills based on the know-how of 
local populations and inputs from modern science 
can meet the needs of small modern family farms. 
The use of local energy sources exploited on a 
limited scale would also make possible the gradual 
development of small packaging and transforma- 
tion industries. : 
An efficient network of production and mar- 
keting co-operatives would provide an institu- 
tional framework for these ecodevelopment 
strategies. In the medium term, such co-operatives 
would make it possible to provide decent living. 
conditions for a much larger population, while 
respecting the vulnerable ecosystems of 
Amazonia. They would also slow down the 
exodus to the shanty-towns and the proliferation 
of uncontrolled gold mining. 
The objective must be to make Amazonia 
habitable, by abandoning the colonial vision of 
an area producing resources which are then 
drained away to the outside world. There remain 
the far more difficult problems of reducing the 
social and ecological costs of mining and 
hydropower, improving the living conditions of 
the urban masses, and controlling tropical dis- 
eases, starting with malaria. 
Contrary to a widespread prejudice, enough 
is already known about Amazonia for us to 
advance along the road of ecodevelopment, 
without neglecting the research which is anyway 
necessary. Successful projects and promising local 
initiatives can be found in the interstices of the 
predatory development model. These solutions, 
which for the time being lie outside the dominant 
paradigm, may be seen as the precursors of a new 
paradigm of development. ||

### 90251: No room in the Ark

No room in the Ark by Bernd von Droste 
‘The destruction of natural ecosystems and the extinction of plant and animal species 
is becoming one of the crucial factors limiting economic growth’ 
¢ 
HE scale of the human economy has grown 
so large that there 1s no longer sufficient room 
for all species in the Ark.” These recent words 
from a World Bank official are a striking warning 
that the world 1s becoming so full of human 
beings and their socio-economic systems that 
other, often priceless, irreplaceable species and 
their natural systems are being displaced and des- 
troyed at a rate never before experienced. The 
human population of the world is now projected 
to double within thirty-nine years, from five bil- 
lion to ten billion, but the issue is not just 
numbers, but how those numbers relate to avail- 
able resources. The destruction of natural 
ecosystems and the resulting extinction of plant 
and animal species is becoming one of the cru- 
cial factors limiting economic growth. Indeed, the 
diversity of life on Earth is being rapidly 
diminished as uniform production systems 
replace cultural and natural diversity. 
The diversity of species, however, is essen- 
tial to the normal functioning of ecosystems and 
therefore to the biosphere as a whole. Apart from 
the moral, cultural, aesthetic and purely scientific 
reasons for conserving wild species, the genetic 
material they supply already makes a huge con- 
tribution to the world economy in the form of 
improved crop species, new drugs and medicines 
and raw materials for industry. It also promises 
to become even more important in the future as 
our understanding of genetic processes is steadily 
increasing. 
Economic logic tells us that we ought to max- 
imize the productivity of the scarcest factors and 
try to increase their supply. Economic policy 
should be directed towards the conservation of 
. remaining natural stocks, increasing their sus- 
tainable use and, where still possible, restoring 
lost natural assets. In other words, we need to 
undertake a huge programme of investment in 
biological diversity. 
Three kinds of investment are needed: first, 
36 scientific investment for enlarging our knowledge 
base; second, investment in the sound manage- 
ment and restoration of our often degraded 
natural heritage; and third, investment in inter- 
national instruments for world conservation of 
biodiversity. 
INVESTMENT IN 
THE KNOWLEDGE BASE 
Lack of knowledge is a major obstacle to the con- 
servation of biological diversity. What better illus- 
tration of our lack of knowledge than the widely 
different estimates of the present number of living 
species—they range from three million to one 
hundred million—to be found in scientific litera- 
ture? Even less is known about the interaction 
of species, the precise role of species diversity, or 
how to achieve sustainable development in sen- 
sitive, species-rich areas. 
It is often assumed that the establishment of 
a system of protected areas will fulfil conserva- 
tion needs. The fact is, however, that we do not 
have species inventories for most protected areas

and even less so outside them. We therefore do 
not even know what we are aiming to conserve 
or which areas to concentrate on. Under- 
investment over past decades in taxonomic 
training and research, as well as in surveys of bio- 
logical diversity, means that we simply cannot 
complete a world inventory of biota within the 
foreseeable future. At the very best, it is estimated 
that only some 10 to 15 per cent of all species 
have been identified so far. 
A start has been made. The International 
Union of Biological Sciences (IUBS) and the 
Scientific Committee on Problems of the 
Environment (SCOPE), in conjunction with 
UNESCQO’s Man and the Biosphere (MAB) 
Programme, are preparing a large research 
programme on biological diversity. A series of 
meetings is being arranged to lay down a basis 
for international comparative research relating to 
the three main levels of biodiversity—at the 
molecular and cellular level, at the organism and 
population level and at the ecosystem and land- 
scape level. MAB has also launched a co-operative 
research and training programme with the Smith- 
sonian Institution to help train taxonomists and 
to undertake biological surveys in the tropics. 
It is in the tropics, and in particular the 
world’s remaining tropical forests, that the big- 
gest effort to achieve sustainable development is 
needed. Already 55 per cent of the world’s trop- 
ical forests, the planet’s richest species habitat, 
have been destroyed, yet hardly any studies have 
been carried out on the relationship between 
forest destruction and species loss. 
Given their crucial role in the conservation 
of biological diversity, it is essential to establish 
a scientific basis for the sustainable development 
of tropical forests. With this in mind, MAB has 
joined in international efforts to develop sus- 
tainable tropical forest management regimes. To 
achieve this, MAB is applying the “critical mass 
strategy’. 
The “critical mass strategy” offers a way of 
convincing developers that the sum of sustainable 
activities can exceed the profits obtainable from 
the sum of non-sustainable activities. It is a 
strategy which requires making full use of the 
range of products and resources that tropical 
forests can provide. Major components of this 
strategy include: 
* new logging and extraction techniques, such as 
the use of newly-designed airships for timber 
hauling; 
® expansion in the use of non-timber products, 
including the introduction of food species such 
as gaur cattle, mouse deer and chestnuts; 
e the development of nature tourism. 
INVESTMENT 
IN THE NATURAL 
HERITAGE 
The problem of protecting the natural heritage, 
and thus of maintaining biodiversity, is particu- 
larly difficult in developing countries. How can

in situ conservation of genetic resources be 
achieved in the interest of mankind as a whole 
and of future generations when the rural poor 
have few means of satisfying their basic needs 
other than to exploit the last intact wild lands? 
In 1987, the report of the World Commis- 
sion on Environment and Development, often 
referred to as the Brundtland Commission, urged = 
the establishment of more non-conventional pro- 
tected areas, along the lines of the international 
network of Biosphere Reserves established by 
MAB over the past fifteen years and consisting 
of 300 protected areas in seventy-five countries. 
Biosphere Reserves consist of a central “core” 
area set aside for strict genetic resource conser- 
vation and monitoring, and an outer “buffer” 
zone in which only restricted exploitation is —-

permitted. In most developing countries, interna- 
tional assistance in achieving sustainable develop- 
ment in a buffer zone or other mechanisms for 
transfer of material benefits have to be mobilized 
as a compensation for non-use of core areas. This 
often involves considerable investment of human 
and other resources to enhance productivity and 
to improve local services such as health care and 
education. 
Environmental awareness and education 
programmes are essential if the Biosphere Reserve 
concept is to obtain the full participation and sup- 
port of the local population. 
INVESTING 
IN INSTITUTIONAL 
INNOVATION 
There is an urgent need for institutional innova- 
tion, that is, for the adoption of effective inter- 
national legal instruments for the protection of 
the global commons—those features of the planet 
that are of universal interest, such as the 
atmosphere, the oceans and the diversity of spe- 
cies. These innovative instruments should lead to 
responsible world governance and greater 
solidarity and equity. Among innovative concepts 
and instruments to emerge during recent years 
are the World Heritage Convention, debt-for-

nature swaps and the Global Environment 
Facility. 
In 1972, faced with the increasing threat to 
humanity’s cultural and natural heritage, UNESCO 
led the way to the establishment of the World 
Heritage Convention. The Convention is innova- 
tive in several respects. First, it links what were 
traditionally regarded as two quite different fields 
—the protection of both the cultural and the 
natural heritage. Second, it achieved a conceptual 
breakthrough by recognizing that there are cul- 
tural and natural properties of such outstanding 
or unique value that they are truly part of the 
heritage not only of individual nations but of all 
mankind. Third, it has established a World 
Heritage Fund made up of contributions by States 
Parties to the Convention to be used for the pro- 
tection of the world heritage. Today, having been 
adopted by 115 States, the World Heritage Con- 
vention is the world’s most universal international 
legal instrument for conservation, with 337 
properties inscribed on the World Heritage List. 
Debt-for-nature exchanges (or swaps) are 
another way of investing in conservation and sus- 
tainable development. The roots of the 
mechanism lie in Third World debts that can be 
bought at a discount on the international debt 
market. The first swap was made by Conserva- 
tion International to help develop the Beni 
Biosphere Reserve in Bolivia. 
By mid-1991, some $16 million had been 
invested by industrialized nations and conserva- 
tion groups in purchases of Third World debts 
with 2a face value of almost $100 million. These 
have subsequently been exchanged for sustainable 
development funds and bonds to the value of

### 90252: The First Earth Summit

Established by the World Bank, the United 
Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and 
the United Nations Development Programme 
(UNDP), with funding of $1.5 billion, the Global 
Environment Facility is the latest innovative con- 
servation initiative. Its funds are to be used for 
the reduction of greenhouse gas emission, con- 
servation of biological diversity, protection of 
international water resources and protection of 
the ozone layer. 
MEETING FUTURE NEEDS 
The international conventions and funding 
mechanisms mentioned above constitute an 
important advance in the financing of biological 
diversity conservation; but far more funds and 
innovative instruments are needed. The capital 
for conservation investment could be mobilized 
through new forms of international solidarity, 
such as the replacement of military expenditure 
by investment in environmental safeguards. 
Global taxes on the production and consumption 
of environment-damaging goods could also be 
introduced. 
A major breakthrough would be the estab- 
lishment of a global fund under a convention for 
the protection of the atmosphere, based on taxes 
on carbon release or the emission of greenhouse 
gases. With the help of such a fund more sus- 
tainable patterns of energy use could be achieved 
and the costs of environmental protection and 
repair, including the protection of biological 
diversity, could be more equitably shared. ® 
The first Earth Summit 
r Sy years after the first World Conference on the Environment, held 
in Stockholm in 1972, the international community is faced with a serious 
dilemma. On the one hand it is more necessary than ever to increase eco- 
nomic activity in order to meet basic needs and ensure the well-being of a 
rapidly growing human family. On the other, human activities are making an 
unprecedented impact on the natural environment and on the global systems 
which sustain life on Earth, as is demonstrated by air and water pollution, the 
massive degradation of land resources, the destruction of landscapes, cli- 
mate changes induced by the wasteful use of energy, the rapid disappear- 
ance of animal and plant species, and the depletion of the ozone layer. 
In face of problems of such magnitude, inaction is out of the question. 
The General Assembly of the United Nations has thus decided to convene 
a new United Nations Conference, this time on Environment and Development 
(UNCED), which will be held in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) from 1 to 12 June 1992. 
Many Heads of State and Government are expected to attend this first “Earth 
Summit”. 
BM WHAT IS AT STAKE 
The problem facing the Rio Conference is how to maintain the quality of the 
environment and to achieve environmentally sound, sustainable development 
in all countries. The following questions will be among those addressed: 
* protection of the atmosphere (climate change, depletion of the ozone layer, 
transboundary air pollution); 
* protection of land resources (combating deforestation, soil loss, desertifi- 
cation and drought); 
* conservation of biological diversity; 
* protection of freshwater resources; 
* protection of oceans, seas and coastal areas, and the rational use and 
development of their living resources; 
* environmentally sound management of biotechnology and hazardous wastes 
(including toxic chemicals); 
* prevention of illegal traffic in toxic products and wastes; 
* improvement in the quality of life and human health; 
* improvement in living and working conditions of the poor by eradicating 
poverty and stopping environmental degradation. 
The developing countries stress the vital importance of the problems 
associated with poverty, inappropriate patterns of growth and development, 
the external debt crisis and the deterioration of terms of trade. 
HM POSSIBLE RESULTS 
The results of the Conference may include: 
1. The adoption of an “Earth Charter’ or declaration of basic principles 
for the conduct of nations and peoples in relation to the environment and 39

development, to ensure that the Earth is a hospitable home for human and 
other forms of life; 
2. Agreements on specific legal measures, notably conventions for the 
protection of the atmosphere and biological diversity, both currently being 
negotiated; 
3. An agenda for action, “Agenda 21", establishing an agreed work pro- 
gramme of the international community for the period from 1992 into the 
21st century, setting priorities, targets, cost estimates and modalities, and 
assigning responsibilities. 
UNESCO'S ROLE 
At the crossroads of education, science, culture and communication, 
UNESCO offers a unique institutional framework for dealing with envi- 
ronmental and natural resource management problems that are so com- 
plex that only integrated and interdisciplinary approaches are appro- 
priate for tackling them. 
Most of the principal environmental issues identified for UNCED 
are central to three of UNESCO's major and longstanding international 
scientific programmes: 
* The Man and the Biosphere (MAB) programme for the protection and 
management of land resources and ecosystems, and the conserva- 
tion of biological diversity. In this field MAB is a particularly valuable 
tool because of its international network of biosphere reserves; 
* The International Hydrological Programme (IHP) for the study of fresh- 
water resources and their rational use; 
* Programmes of the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission 
(I0C) and related activities in the marine sciences, for the protection Above, luxuriant tropical vegetation in Sri Lanka.

of the relationship between the oceans and climate. 
UNESCO is also directly concerned with environmental problems 
through another of its main areas of competence, education. It has 
played an active role in encouraging the incorporation of environmental 
education into national education policies and curricula. The UNESCO- 
UNEP International Environmental Education Programme (IEEP), 
launched in 1975, is preparing new materials for teachers and schools 
In the form of teaching modules and other materials relating to envi- 
ronmental education and is participating in the training of teachers 
in this field. 
UNESCO's Social and Human Sciences Sector is also contributing ; : 
to environmental programmes through study of the interrelationships NN 
between population, environment, natural resources and development, 
and of the decision-making process related to environment and deve- - PA 
lopment. St 
Finally, UNESCO is closely involved with the protection of the cul- EN 
tural as well as the natural heritage, notably within the framework of 7 EN, 
the World Heritage Convention. It is also concerned with analysis of 
the cultural dimension of development, without which environment and 
development would be difficult to reconcile. -

ence took place in a climate of optimism and 
determination to act. 
Action was indeed taken: international 
organizations such as the United Nations 
Environment Programme (UNEP) were created; 
Ministries of the Environment came into being; 
and ecologically-minded political movements 
emerged. The results, judged in terms of the 
volume of publications that have appeared, the 
knowledge that has been acquired, and the 
number of reforestation and drainage projects 
that have been carried out in the newly- 
established protected zones, have undeniably 
been important. And yet, paradoxically, our 
environment has continued to deteriorate. Local 
successes have been recorded here and there, but 
the current situation is much more critical than 
It was twenty years ago. 
In the industrialized countries, water is con- 
taminated by chemicals, soils are degraded by 
excessive use of pesticides and fertilizers, coast- 
lines are disfigured by ill-planned urbanization, 
forests are destroyed and lakes made sterile by

RET, W salinization of soils, floods, the extinction of

animal and plant species, particularly in tropical 
regions. Shanty-towns proliferate, with their 
attendant poverty, disease and delinquency. 
All these problems, both in the North and 
in the South, are linked by a common thread. 
They arise from inappropriate development 
choices. Of course, the problems are far more 
flagrant in the South, because demographic pres- 
sure there is far higher than in the North. But 
the true origin of these problems is planetary in 
nature, and is connected with the interdepen- 
dence of economies, the competitive interactions 
of international markets, monetary disorder, and 
the thorny issue of foreign debt. 
Some thirty years from now, the human race, 
whose numbers will by then have reached ten or 
twelve billion, will be affected by the emergence of 
environmental problems which will also be of a 
global nature: probable disturbance of the climate

the depletion of the ozone layer in the upper 
atmosphere, and the irreversible impoverishment 
of biological diversity. 
We are thus faced with extremely complex 
issues, in some cases uncertain and unpredictable, 
all highly dependent on one another, and 
changing rapidly on a planetary scale. And yet 
our institutions of education, research, adminis- 
tration and management have not been designed 
to face problems of this type. Even with a con- 
siderable increase in funds, it is unlikely that we 
shall be able to solve them immediately. The key 
to a solution is not conjunctural but structural. 
To tackle the crucial problems of the environ- 
ment effectively calls for an interdisciplinary 
approach which few institutions can provide at 
the present time. Research bodies and universi- 
ties are in thrall to evaluation systems strictly 
compartmentalized according to discipline, and 
there 1s a widening gap between university 
_ training and research on the one hand and the 
real needs of society on the other. Very little cur- 
rent research in this field has an effective appli 
cation, either because in most cases it does not 
address the true problems, or because it is not 
integrated into the decision-making and manage- 
ment processes, or because it is not adapted to 
the compartmentalization of administrative 
structures. 
No discipline, not even ecology, can claim 
alone to apprehend all the planetary economic 
and social ramifications of environmental 
problems, no research body or administrative 
service can consider itself to be self-sufficient in 
this field. No country, not even the most 
powerful, can claim to resolve problems whose 
causes and effects lie in other countries, nor pre- 
vent their repercussions on its territory. Yet most 
disciplines ignore one another or are rivals in the 
search for research funding. The professions with- 
draw into their traditional corporatism, ministries 
are divided into sectors virtually impermeable to 
interaction, and countries only agree on insuffi-

immediate or partial problems than to succeed 
in establishing institutions really capable of 
managing and overcoming what has to be called 
the environmental crisis. 
MUST THERE BE 
AN ECOLOGICAL CATASTROPHE 
BEFORE WE ACT? 
Technical solutions exist for most of the 
problems, even if they meet psychological and 
structural resistance and clash with powerful and 
contradictory economic interests. Perhaps we 
shall take the necessary measures in time, as 
public opinion and economic and political circles 
gradually become aware of what is at stake. It is 
more likely, however, that we shall wait until a 
far greater shock occurs than any we have yet 
known. It would be most regrettable if our col- 
lective instinct for survival could only be aroused 
in the face of a major ecological catastrophe. 
Let us hope that this will not happen. It is 
particularly important that partial lack of results 
or precise data should not provide an excuse for 
inaction, both by decision-makers and by each 
and every one of us. Delay would be terribly 
costly and some forms of environmental damage 
may be irreversible. It takes only a few hours to 
cut down a forest, a few months to cause erosion 
and desertification, a few years to change world 
climate. But a species that disappears never reap- 
pears, tens or hundreds of years are required for 
a forest to regenerate, a thousand years to restore 
eroded soll. 
Let us hope that the environmental crisis, 
with all its gravity and complexity, may ulti- 
mately act as a catalyst for better communication 
in our laboratories, for greater flexibility in our 
administrative structures, and above all for greater 
equity between countries rich and poor, and 
towards the future generations to which we owe 
responsibility for the Earth which has been 
entrusted to us. 
A change in behaviour by each individual, 
each institution and each State is the only basis 
from which an acceptable future can emerge from 
the constraints of the environmental crisis. Let 
us hope that this change can take place without 
being provoked by a major ecological catastrophe 
from which no-one would be secure. u

according to legend, the founder 
of Carthage, originally a 
Phoenician settlement. The 
festival, the “Journées

include round-table discussions, 
seminars; conferences of artists 
and archaeologists, music 
recitals, dance and poetry 
performances and other events 
designed to evoke the

the establishment at Carthage 
of an international arts centre 
and a museum of daily life.

### 90254: The Stones of Aachen

The Palatine Chapel 
The region of Aachen, in the central part of 
the Frankish kingdom, was rich in game and 
possessed hot springs whose beneficial proper- 
ties were already known to the Romans. It was 
in fact on the ruins of the ancient Roman 
baths that Charlemagne built his palace, a 
building whose function was political, eco- 
nomic and religous as well as residential. Not 
much survives to recall its political role, origt- 
nally embodied in the Throne Room, except 
the foundations of the tower known as the 
Granusturm, whose stones were used to build 
the city’s Gothic town hall. The residential 
quarters and storehouses have disappeared 
without trace. But the church that 
Charlemagne dedicated to the Virgin and 
chose as his final resting-place has stood the 
test of the centuries. 
The building was probably completed 
around the year 800. Two years previously, 
the theologian Alcuin had announced in a 
letter to the Emperor that the columns of the 
chapel were being built. Originally, the Pala- 
tine Chapel consisted of three elements: the 
central building, with a rectangular choir to 
the east and an entrance porch to the west. 
The peripheral chapels and the Gothic choir 
with its stained-glass windows are later 
additions. 
Built on an east-west axis, the church fol- 
lowed the plan of early Christian basilicas, an 
atrium surrounded by colonnades. Traces of 
it can still be seen in the parvis. 
The way into the building is through a 
combined porch and belltower, flanked by 
 
two towers with staircases in them. The effect 
is one of fortress-like bulk. The two brass 
doors of the main portal were cast in Aachen 
in Charlemagne’s time. Four other doors and 
eight grilles from the same workshop are deco- 
rated with motifs recalling Roman Antiquity. 
There are two artefacts from Roman times in 
the narthex: a brass she-wolf and a bronze pine 
cone that may once have decorated a fountain 
in the atrium. 
The chapel itself is clearly modelled on the 
architecture of Ravenna and of Byzantine 
basilicas. It consists of a two-storey-high 
octagonal rotunda encircled by a sixteen-sided 
ambulatory. Heavy polygonal pillars support

the eight arcades of the upper storey, which 
are flanked by bronze grilles from the Carolin- 
gian period. Within the arcades are the famous 
marble columns brought by Charlemagne 
from Rome and Ravenna to stress the con- 
tinuity of his project with the architecture of 
the Roman empire, 
This imposing edifice is topped by a dome 
of a type which had never previously been 
constructed north of the Alps. To support the 
weight of so large a structure, Charlemagne’ 
architect divided the calotte of the vault into 
eight sections, allowing him to distribute the 
weight equitably across eight pillars. A ring 
of metal dating from Carolingian times helps 
to support the base of the dome. The roof is 
decorated with a mosaic representing the 
twenty-four elders of the Apocalypse. The 
height of the building (32 metres) exactly cor- 
responds to the diameter of the church's outside 
  
     
wall, so the building would fit perfectly into 
a cube, thereby respecting the proportions 
attributed in the Bible to the Tower of Babel 
and the Heavenly Jerusalem. 
The high altar, the oldest in Germany, is 
situated in the western part of the aisle, on the 
site of an earlier altar. Its marble had already 
been used previously. On it were crowned 
twenty-five of the thirty German emperors, 
from Otto the Great in 936 to Ferdinand I in 
1531. 
The altar is decorated with seventeen 
golden basreliefs dating from the early 
eleventh century, which were probably com- 
missioned by Otto III and completed in the 
reign of his successor, Henry II. Christ the 
Redeemer is shown in the centre, flanked by 
the Virgin Mary and the Archangel Michael, 
both intercessors for the human race. Four 
medallions representing the symbols of the 
  
Evangelists surmount scenes from Christ's 
passion. 
The gilded archbishop’s throne presented 
to the cathedral by emperor Henry 1I also 
dates from the same period. At first installed 
in the octagonal chapel, it was moved to the 
southern wall at the time of the construction 
of the Gothic choir in the fifteenth century. 
It 1s splendidly decorated with sixth-century 
Coptic ivory plaques carved to represent 
mythological scenes, and with bas-reliefs of the 
four Evangelists. 
The cathedral contains the remains of two 
German emperors: Charlemagne himself, who 
died in 814, and Otto III, who died in 1002. 
The exact location of Charlemagne’s original 
tomb is no longer known. Otto III discovered 
it in the year 1000 and removed some relics. 
In 1165, Frederick I moved the emperor’s 
bones to a temporary cenotaph, and since 1215

they have lain in a shrine restored to its full 
splendour by the patient efforts of the 
cathedral’s conservators. 
The Palatine Chapel soon became a place 
of pilgrimage, but unlike the ancient basilicas 
it had not been built with that purpose in 
mind. That was why the cathedral chapter 
decided in 1355 to construct the Gothic choir, 
which was completed in 1414, exactly 600 
years after Charlemagne’s death. 
The Carolingan edifice is surrounded by 
a crown of Gothic chapels, on two levels like 
the central octagon. A staircase dating from 
Carolingian times provides access to the upper 
storey. There stands the marble throne of the 
German emperors. Impressively sober and 
massive, it is made of four slabs of marble from 
the eastern Mediterranean, set on four blocks 
of stone; six steps lead up to it. A tenth- 
century chronicler informs us that the throne 
was set between two marble columns so that 
the sovereign “could see everything and be 
seen by everyone”. 
No building north of the Alps so power- 
fully evokes the new Rome that Charlemagne 
dreamed of founding. The choice of architec- 
tural models from the fifth and sixth centu- 
ries was Intended to indicate to contem- 
poraries that he considered himself as the heir 
of the Western Empire. Columns brought 
from over the Alps, brass doors and grilles 
bearing Roman motifs: these and other details 
were meant to give visible expression to the 
enduring link between the ancient world and 
the medieval West. The Palatine Chapel was 
originally conceived as an image of the 
heavenly Jerusalem as described by St. John

the Divine in the Book of Revelations. And 
it is true that the magnificence of its gold and 
precious stones and the mysterious harmony 
of its architecture do bring to mind the splen- 
dours of the heavenly city. 
A masterpiece in peril 
The people of Aachen have always done their 
best to maintain their cathedral, but histor- 
ical events have often come close to destroying 
it, notably during the Second World War. 
Once hostilities were over, the demanding task 
began of making good the considerable 
damage done to the building. The roof had 
to be repaired, stained-glass windows to be 
replaced, the entry to the choir to be restored. 
The chapel in the tower had been completely 
destroyed and needed to be rebuilt. 
One problem that still remains is the 
cleaning of the Carolingian masonry. Prelimi- 
nary work is now virtually completed, and 
  
  
tests are currently being carried out to estab- 
lish the best method of treatment. Other 
future projects include the restoration of the 
Hungarian chapel and the chapels of St. Anne 
and St. Matthew, as well as repair work on 
the roof, particularly over the octagonal 
chapel. 
It would be impossible to restore and con- 
serve the cathedral and its treasures without 
outside help. Although the cathedral benefits 
from generous public funding, private initia- 
tives have also played a part. The earliest dates 
back to 1847, when citizens of Aachen formed 
the first assoctation dedicated to preserving the 
site, the Karlsverein. Part of this tradition is 
the “Aachen Cathedral, masterpiece in peril” 
campaign, which was launched in 1988 and has 
received an encouraging response from the 
business community and from private 
individuals. 
RIL, 550 ARGOS 
  
Good works do not exclude good 
humour, to judge from the many unusual 
ideas the campaign has sparked. A circus put 
on a special performance, a brass band gave 
a charity concert, a modelling club contributed 
a competition prize, and newly-weds have 
asked for contributions to be made to the 
cathedral instead of wedding presents. Banks 
and savings banks have provided sponsorship; 
a colouring book has been produced to reveal 
the cathedral to children; Jocal newspapers 
keep their readers informed on the state of the 
restoration work; the 400-odd participants of 
a world conference of iron-smiths offered 
hand-crafted work for sale at auction. 
The results of these and other activities are 
swelling the funds already available from offi- 
cial sources, proving that the cathedral can also 
count for its survival on the people of the city.

place at an exceptional moment in world history. In the last two

the victors of the Second World War. Are UNESCO's activities going 
to change as a result? 
— Of course they are adapting to these changes. Paradoxically, 
UNESCO is thus returning to its original mission. The United 
Nations Organization was created to maintain world peace. The 
Charter of the United Nations defined several major principles: 
respect for justice, the rule of law, human rights and fun-

dent countries where the basic principles of the United Nations 
Charter could hardly be applied. The bipolar division of the 
world had provoked the cold war and ideological opposition 
between East and West. UNESCO’s initiatives were confronted 
and very often paralyzed by this situation. The UN itself could 
only play a limited role in the prevention and solution of con- 
flicts. The situation today is totally new. Most of the former 
colonies have become independent and their voices are starting 
to be heard on the world stage. In the last two years the 
totalitarian regimes of eastern and central Europe and the 
Balkans have fallen. The USSR itself has begun a long journey 
towards democracy and respect for human rights. South Africa 
Is attempting to put an end to apartheid. 
The conditions now exist in which ideological confronta- 
tions and fear of the Other can disappear. The principles of 
the United Nations Charter can be taken into account by 
humanity without the arriére-pensées and manipulations we 
have known for forty-five years. 
Hl Does this mean that from now on everything is for the best in 
the best of all possible worlds? 
— Certainly not. But I wanted to make these observations 
which allow us to be more optimistic today than ever before 
in the past. The problems to be solved today and tomorrow 
are enormous but we can try to solve them by talking the same 
language and with a greater chance of success. 
There are two things I would like to add. Firstly, although 
these principles are accepted by everyone, they are not respected 
by everyone. In its capacity as the intellectual component of 
the United Nations system, UNESCO has a duty to identify 
the obstacles which prevent their application and to help to 
overcome them. Secondly, the principles themselves must be 
further refined. We live in an inegalitarian world. Below a cer- 
tain level of poverty and deprivation, freedom loses its sub- 
stance, civic equality becomes an abstraction. If they are to be 
given tangible form, these universal values must be accompa- 
nied by real acts of solidarity, by an ethic of sharing. If some 
people enjoy prosperity, knowledge and culture in a rich world 
while others are deprived of these benefits of civilization, the

world cannot be at peace. The duty of fraternity is an ethical 
imperative, for humanity is one and indivisible in its diversity. 
BW We are still far from this state of solidarity. 
— That 1s why we are going through an uncertain transitional 
period in which the best and the worst exist side by side, in 
which the highest expectations are accompanied by terrible 
risks. It would be more accurate to talk in terms of several tran- 
sitions, taking place in different time-scales and at different 
rhythms, yet linked to one another, inextricably intertwined. 
In some cases national sovereignty and independence are leading 
to extremes of nationalism based on exclusivity and rejection. 
Alas, from the blossoming of cultural identities in a framework 
of freedom it is possible to take a pathological course which 
leads to the exclusion of others. When there is a rapid recrudes- 
cence of nationalism which has been repressed for dozens of 
years, only democracy can peacefully reconcile the active coex- 
istence of all cultures and languages. 
The transition between totalitarianism and democracy is 
not easy. It implies the passage from a war economy to a peace 
economy, and above all from a war culture to a peace culture. 
Our models of economic development have led to the sacrifice 
of the environment and the human condition to the require- 
ments of productivity. Man and nature share an indivisible 
destiny. 
All these changes vary according to places and situations, 
but today everything is changing rapidly as developments in 
communications and the media shrink the planet. Humanity 
has some interests and hopes that are held in common and 
others that differ and are even contradictory. UNESCO must 
in its thinking and in its action take account of this “living 
matter’. 
Mm Could you explain what you mean by different time-scales, 
rhythms, interests and hopes? 
— Look at a world map. Africa, Asia, Western Europe, North 
America, Latin America, Eastern Europe, the Arab world. The 
configuration of problems and priorities differs widely from 
one cultural region to another. 
In Africa demands for democratization are making them- 
selves felt. Regional and international co-operation is necessary 
to make possible an economic take-off based on the realities, 
the genius, and the creativity of the African peoples. 
In Eastern Europe the fall of totalitarianism is opening the 
way to freedom and national self-determination but also to dis- 
trust and prejudices which are rooted in a more or less distant 
past and which must be overcome because they threaten peace 
and risk fomenting clashes between peoples. 
In Latin America a common trend has become apparent 
among the peoples of Latin culture since the fall of the dictator- 
ships. These peoples are tackling the problems posed by the 
modernization of thelr societies, while at the same time bearing 
a very heavy burden of external debt. 
In Asia, modernization is already under way, but it is 
accompanied by demographic pressure that is giving rise to new 
contradictions in a world whose time-honoured cultures must 
integrate the latest technological and scientific advances. 
In Western Europe and North America, where the 
privileges of wealth, knowledge and power are concentrated, 
questions are asked about the meaning and use of these advan- 
tages. Even there inequality is increasing and leading to turmoil 
as Western societies search for values adapted to new condi- 
tions of life, work and leisure. In a world that is both increas- 
ingly united and increasingly inegalitarian, the need for 
solidarity and sharing is very strong, 
MW What can UNESCO do in face of all these transitions? 
— It alone can help to encourage in the international commu- 
nity a meeting of minds based on the universal values defined 
in the United Nations Charter—especially since it has had forty- 
five years of unique experience. 
There is an alchemy of intellectual co-operation, of the 
gradual coming together of ideas, just as there is an alchemy 
of incomprehension, discrimination and discord. The former 
can only prevail if there is a relentless determination to defend 
everything that brings people together and unites them. Clearly 
this does not mean suppressing originality in the interests of 
a generalized uniformity. Respect for differences is of vital 
importance, for unity can only be achieved in a debate which 
takes account of the individuality of each person, the specific 
features of each culture, the flowering of each people. 
Culture, the cultural dimension of peace and of sustainable 
development with a human face, will be at the top of the polit- 
ical agenda, at the national and global levels. It has too often 
been treated as ornamental in bilateral accords, as the cherry 
on the cake, added for the sake of decoration without anyone 
really believing in it. 
BW Are there rules of emulation in creativity just as there are rules 
for economic competition and rules for road traffic? 
— Yes. UNESCO has a duty to serve two complementary pur- 
poses: individuality and universalism. I must repeat that the 
defence of one’s own identity should not lead to the rejection 
of other people’s. We know, however, that this can happen and 
we must fight against this perversion. It is thus of crucial impor- 
tance to respect the universal values and rules without which 
communication and exchange would be impossible. 49

HB How can UNESCO help this process? 


### 90255: Interview with Federico Mayor, Director-General of UNESCO, on the occasion of the twenty-sixth session of UNESCO's General Conference

— By increasing awareness of what is involved in making 
choices, by extending the range of intellectual discussion, 
UNESCO's programmes aim to put the experience of the inter- 
national community at the disposal of those States that wish 
to profit from it when they take decisions on matters which 
fall within the Organization’s fields of competence. Some of 
the main priority areas are: the generalization of basic education; 
The Peace Fountain, a copper sculpture created by Charles Eugene Gagnon 
for the Peace Plaza at Rochester, Minnesota (U.5.A.) 
  
higher education; protection of the environment and manage- 
ment of natural resources; improving the flow of information; 
encouraging freedom of creativity; taking into account the cul- 
tural aspects of all forms of development. 
We must give support to decision-makers as they face 
different choices and encourage them to act; we must offer struc- 
tures and means of co-operation; we must provide international 
legal instruments. We can, for example, help to further the 
advance of knowledge through our oceanographic programmes 
and through the programme on Man and the Biosphere. We 
can bring together intellectuals and creative people from all 
regions to discuss the major problems of our time, as we did 
recently in Prague, where the theme of the meeting was Culture 
and Democracy. The positive developments of the past few 
years are helping to bring about an entirely new openness in 
the East, the West, the South. 
HB Do fields such as science and culture lend themselves to govern- 
ment action? 
— That question was asked when UNESCO was created. As 
far as science is concerned, there can be no doubt. Without inter- 
national co-operation, it is not possible to study the oceans, 
the atmosphere, space, watercourses, deserts, ecology and so 
on. The fallout from Chernobyl did not respect frontiers. 
The situation with regard to culture is more complex. 
‘Intellectuals and creative artists need to be independent from 
political pressure. They have said “No” to dictators, colonizers, 
arms dealers, polluters. With the end of the bipolar world and 
the resurgence of democracy, this distrust is tending to diminish, 
and will continue to do so, even if the duty of intellectuals to 
criticize 1s in a sense sacred as a protection against the excesses 
and distortions of our society. UNESCO has valuable 
experience of projects that bring together governments, 
decision-makers and individuals, intellectuals and creators. 
HM Is there a particular image or priority which you would like to 
mention in conclusion? 
— The culture of peace seems to me to be of primordial i mpor- 
tance today. We need to work on this concept. We are intoxi- 
cated by our culture of war, often without even realizing that 
we are. Rejection of other people is accompanied by recourse 
to violence. We know the cost of war, but we don’t know the 
cost of peace: an active, speedy and respectful justice; an environ- 
ment protected by the conscious attitudes of everyone; suffi- 
cient food and a decent system of health care; but above all 
an unfettered spiritual framework in which everyone can find 
fulfilment. On the philosophical level as well as in more mun- 
dane ways, we must explore the values and customs that 
encourage the culture of peace. 
It is in this spirit that the United Nations system must 
evolve without delay. Substantial differences separate the United 
Nations Organization of 1945 from that of 1995, when it will 
be celebrating its 50th anniversary. 
The new world we are entering needs ideas and values. 
A debate at both local and global levels should help the tran- 
sition from the bipolar world of the Second World War to the 
new world born of decolonization and the fall of the Berlin 
Wall. |
