UNESCO RESPONDS TO UNITED NATIONS 
REQUEST FOR KOREAN ACTION 
Resolutions adopted by 
the Executive Board 
on August 28 1950 
THE EXECUTIVE BOARD 
PROFOUNDLY MOVED by the armed attack of which 
the Republic of Korea has been the victim, and which led 
the Security Council of the United Nations to adopt certain 
measures with a view to re-establishing peace and security, 
- CONSIDERING that one of the essential aims of Unesco 
is, as stated in Article I of its Constitution, “to contribute 
to peace and security by promoting collaboration among 
the nations through education, science and culture in 
order to further universal respect for justice, for the rule 
of law and for the human rights and fundamental 
freedoms for the peoples of the world...”, 
CONSIDERING that the General Conference at its Fifth 
Session, reaffirmed that “all the activities of Unesco must 
be directed towards the peace and prosperity of mankind” 
‘and that these “activities to be fully effective, imply a 
truly and sincerely universal outlook excluding all thought 
of aggression, and founded on recognition of the principles 
of justice and freedom on which the Constitution of the 
Organization is based”, 
CONSIDERING that, in the resolutions adopted by the 
Security Council and the Economic and Social Council on 
31 July 1950 and 14 August 1950, respectively, the Spe- 
cialized Agencies were requested, in accordance with the 
terms of their agreements with the United Nations to 
give whatever help the Unified Command of the United 
Nations in Korea might request, in order to assist and 
bring aid to the civilian population in Korea, 
CONSIDERING that the Economic and Social Council, 
in its resolution of 14 August 1950, also stressed the neces- 
sity for aid in securing the understanding and the support 
of the peoples of the world for the action of the United 
Nations in Korea, and requested the Secretary-General 
to seek, in the name of the Council, whatever form of 
co-operation was best adapted to this purpose, 
TAKING NOTE of the communications of the Secretary- 
General of the United Nations concerning the help which 
Unesco could give, in accordance with the above-men- 
tioned resolution, 
ASSURES the population of Korea of its deep and 
earnest sympathy, 
~ RENDERS respectful homage to the soldiers of the 
United Nations who are fighting on the Korean front in 
the name of international solidarity, 
RECALLS that international peace- and security must 
be based on the respect of the principles of law and the 
decisions of the competent organs of the United Nations, 
if force is not to triumph over law, and if justice is to be 
maintained, 
EXPRESSES its confidence in the programme and 
methods of Unesco in serving the aims of peace of the 
United Nations, through the perfecting of international 
co-operation, through the amelioration of the living 
conditions of man and through the development of inter- 
national understanding by means of education, science 
and culture. 
CONSIDERS, that in order that Unesco may aid the 
United Nations in eliminating the dangers of war more 
effectively, it is particularly urgent, at this moment when 
human solidarity is under trial and when human rights 
are in peril, that still wider’ and more active support 
should be given to the execution of its mission, by Govern- 
ments and National Commissions of Member States. 
DECIDES that within the framework of its competence, 
UNESCO will give all possible aid and assistance to the 
action undertaken by the United Nations in Korea and 
towards this end... (Continued on Page 3.)

UNDER THE FLAG 0 
In August, 1945, World War II came to an end with the military victory 
of the United Nations — and the way was clear for Korea to take its place 
in the society of free nations, after 40 years of Japanese occupation. 
Nearly five years after their liberation, the people of Korea still look to 
the United Nations for the protection of their national independence. 
In the photo above are shown some of the people of Taegu, provisional 
capital of the Republic of Korea, on July 30. 1950, as they gathered 
outside a meeting of the United Nations Commission on Korea, and 
heard each member of the 7-nation commission reaffirm his country’s 
determination to support the fight of the United Nations to preserve 
Korean independence.

was the last of those universal minds which have been 
able to compass all domains of human activity and know- 
ledge... he stood on the brink of an era of rapidly expanding know- 
ledge which has made forever impossible the universality of 
interest and sympathy which distinguished him”. 
At the beginning of the nineteenth century, the genius of one 
man could embrace extremities, for besides writing his great drama 
Faust, Goethe made scientific studies of colours, assembled one 
of the most complete mineral collections of his day (there is even 
a mineral, Goethite, named after him), and conducted extensive

the development of an idea which 
a scientist may pick up in discus- Rocont 
experiments in chemistry and biology. : 
Today, the world of science has 
expanded into a universe, and the 
work in each sphere is so wide 
that all scientists must be spe- 
cialists. No one man, in fact, has 
time to read all the publications 
which appear in his own particular 
field, let alone follow the full 
advance of scientific accomplish- 
ment. 
Recently, for instance, aerodyna- 
mics experts had been working 
with wind-tunnels in studies of 
turbulence, experiments of great 
value to astronomers in observa- 
tions they had made on the passing 
of one dust cloud through another. 
The astronomers, however, could 
not understand the terms used by 
the wind-tunnel experts. A sym- 
posium was held between two mem- 
ber organizations of the Interna- 
tional Council of Scientific Unions 
(ICSU) to work out agreements in 
terminology, making possible the 
application of the results of the 
laboratory studies to theories based 
on astronomical observation.

Unesco was extremely fortunate 
in finding the ICSU already in 
existence, with fifteen years’ expe- 
rience in its difficult work of admi- 
nistration and correlating the 
results of scientific research. The 
two international organizations 
entered into a formal agreement 
of co-operation in 1946, and since 
have rendered valuable services to 
one another.

important contributions to ICSU 
have been in the form of travel 
grants to academic scientists, and 
calling conferences and symposia 
on specific problems. 
One of the most important 
aspects of scientific conferences is 
the element of actual contact among 
the participants. Such contact

is the foundation of 
sion with other specialists in his 
own field, a nascent idea which 
might never have appeared clear 
to him in simply reading the 
reports of those same men. 
Most modern scientific advances 
are made on the borderlines between 
the formally-divided sciences. The 
ICSU, with member unions repre- 
senting nine special branches of 
scientific work in forty nations, 
has established international Joint 
Commissions to study such “bor- 
derline sciences”. 
Rheology, the study of viscous 
substances, from the movement of 
earth’s crust to the flow of the 
blood and the rise of sap in plants, 
calls for research in physics, geo- 
logy, chemistry, mechanics and 
biology. Problems in terminology 
so that the specialists concerned 
could understand one another, were 
dealt with in a special ICSU report. 
Like many specialized sciences, 
rheology may sound far removed 
from our everyday life, but the 
plastics for which we have so many 
uses are a product of this “border- 
line science” which has contribut- 
ed much to help a world short of

Union of Geodosy and Geophysics. 
This second Union also maintains 
the International Seismological

decades of research, which makes 
possible the prediction of the paths 
of earthquakes and the sending out

Unesco’'s Response to 
United Nations Appeal 
NESCO is responding resolutely to the United Nations 
1 | appeal for support following the act of aggression 
in Korea. Thies action was decided on at a meeting 
of the Organization's Executive Board at the end of 
August. It is significant that the 18 members of the Board, 
who act as individuals and not as representatives of 
governments, were unanimous in “deploring the violation 
of international law” and in adopting a programme of 
immediate and long-range action. This 
vides credits totalling $175,000 for three major activities: — 
1) relief assistance to the civilian population in Korea; 
2) plans to bring the Korean teaching system back to normal 
once hostilities end; 
3) an expanded education programme to promote understanding 
of the United Nations responsibilities in the present world 
crisis. 
. Unesco has already formulated plans to send a mission 
of enquiry to Korea if and when requested by the U.N., to 
investigate the civilian needs. of the population and to 
determine how Unesco can best aid relief and recon- 
struction. 
But to achieve this unified action it is vital that inform- 
ation and educational materials concerning the United 
Nations action for collective security reach the peoples of 
the world. The programme, approved by the Executive 
Board, is designed to bring the message of the United 
Nations to schools and universities in dynamic form. 
“Unesco will concentrate its efforts to make known the prin- 
ciple of collective security and to show by concrete exam- 
ples taken from world events and particularly the Korean 
question, the world importance of the work of the United 
Nations. 
The decisions of the Executive Board have been made in 
conformity with the Constitution of Unesco. Among its 
. main tasks the Basic Programme of the organization sets 
forth the following: 
“to bring about better understanding among the peoples of the 
world and to convince them of the necessity of cooperating 
loyally with one another in the framework of the United 
Nations.” 
The Director-General of Unesco made Unesco’s position 
clear recently when he stated: “In condemning aggression 
wherever it appears, Unesco is not impelled by any party 
spirit but adopts an attitude consonant with the notion of 
peace within the law which its constitution proclaims. Far 
from being an instrument of ideological war, our Institution 
is first and foremost an organ of education for the peace 
- under the law. : 
“The activities we can undertake as a result of the events 
in Korea fit into the framework of our normal programme. 
They consist in sharing, to the full measure of our abilities, 
in the reconstruction of Korea, just as we are already con- 
tributing to that of many war-devastated countries, and 
helping to show, by our teaching about the United Nations, 
the value of collective security in the face of any 
aggression.”

EXECUTIVE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY 
VOTES 6-POINT PROGRAMME 
HE Executive Board of 
| Unesco at its meeting 
on August 28th unani- 
mously decided to give 
all possible aid and assistance 
to the action undertaken by the 
United Nations in Korea. The 
decision was contained in a 
resolution adopted by the 
Board, which instructed Di- 
rector-General Jaime Torres 
Bodet : Ee 
“To relieve the needs of the 
civilian population in Korea 
within the fields of education, 
science and culture, by means 
of emergency relief, and, at 
the appropriate time by a re-- 
construction project” ; and 
“To develop, within the re- 
sources at his disposal, includ- 
ing the periodical publications 
of the Organization, the erecu- 
tion of the programme resolu- 
tions concerning teaching about 
the United Nations and its 
Specialized Agencies, putting 
particular emphasis on the 
necessity for collective security, 
based on respect for law, with 
the aid of concrete examples 
and to this end to utilize 
appropriate documentation pro- 
vided by the Secretary General 
of the United Nations.” 
The resolution moreover 
appealed to the Governments 
and National Commissions of 
UNESCO's Member States to 
participate to the extent of the 
means at their disposal in this 
action. It requested non-gov- 
ernmental organizations, which 
participate in the task of Unes- 
co, men and women whose 
activities are devoted to educa- - 
tion, science, culture and in- 
formation, and all those who 
wish to live in peace with their 
fellow men, to contribute to the 
work of Unesco, in that spirit of 
liberty which characterizes all 
of its actions with a view to 
reinforcing in the minds of men 
the intellectual and moral de- 
fenses of peace through law 
which the United Nations are 
responsible for developing and 
safe-guarding. 
To Maintain Justice 
HE Board also authorized 
the Director-General by 
unanimous vote to carry 
out six specific measures pro- 
viding for emergency relief 
and reconstruction in Xorea 
and for an educational cam- 
paign in schools and univer- 
sities and other institutions on 
the United Nations. These 
measures are set forth in the 
text of the Executive Board 
Resolution on this page. 
The resolution of the Board 
assured the population of 
Korea of “its deep and earnest 
sympathy” and rendered “res 
pectful homage lo lhe soldiers 
of the United Nations who are 
Jighting on the Korean front in 
the mame of international soli- 
darity”. It recalled that “In- 
ternational peace and security 
must be based on the respect of 
the principles of law and the 
decisions of the competent or- 
gans of the United Nations, if 
force is not to triumph over 
law, and if justice is lo be 
maintained”.

DIRECTOR-GENERAL OUTLINES 
BACKGROUND FOR ACTION    
of its meeting on August 26th, M. Jaime Torres Bodet, 
A DDRESSING Unesco’s Executive Board at the opening 
Director General, stressed the important responsibilities 
which fell on Unesco, as a Specialized Agency of the 
United Nations, in the present situation in Korea. 
in part: 
He said, 
“May I, first of all, say how glad I am that the Executive 
Board has advanced the date of its summer session in order 
to consider how Unesco can best assist the United Nations 
in the Korean question. The grave events which led the 
Security Council, on 256 June, to adopt measures for the provi- 
sion of military assistance to South Korea in obedience to 
the principle of collective security and in defence of in- 
ternational law, confront Unesco with problems which demand 
the immediate attention of its executive body. In the present 
situation, Unesco, as a Specialized Agency of the United Na- 
tions, has important responsibilities; it will bring to their dis- 
charge a clear appreciation of its resources and a firm 
consciousness of its duties. Your meeting is, in itself, an 
eloquent proof of that intention... 
“.. The problem raised by the armed attack of which the 
Republic of Korea, one of our Member States, is the victim 
does not concern Unesco alone: the whole system of the 
United Nations and Specialized Agencies has taken cognizance 
of it...”

concerns of responsible educators in all countries. 
only now beginning to discover suitable methods of making young people aware 
Many teachers, however, are 
that nations are inter-dependent. There is also a vast amount of work to be done in 
“judging” textbooks: the revision of those “guilty” of bias or excessive nationalism, 
and the preparation of new ones that stress the constructive work of mankind, teach 
children about the international organizations of today, and the services they can render 
to world peace and prosperity. 
How to improve both teaching methods and textbooks to help this education for 
international understanding were the subjects of two Unesco Seminars held recently. 
The articles on this page describe the work done by the educators who met in Brussels, 
at the Seminar on “The Improvement of Textbooks, Particularly History Books”, and 
those at Montreal where the Seminar subject was, “The Teaching of Geography as a Means 
of Developing International Understanding”. 
Textbooks 
* 
with a constructive accent 
NE of the most immediately 
O important results of the Unesco 
Seminar on “The Improvement 
of Textbooks, Particularly History 
Books”, held recently in Brussels, 
was a plan to put the history books 
of nine countries “on trial”. 
The 45 specialists from 24 coun- 
tries including, for the first time at a 
Unesco Seminar, representatives of 
Germany and Japan, laid down the 
main lines of bi-lateral systems of 
exchange and criticism of history 
textbooks between groups of experts, 
similar to those already being carried 
out by the German Teachers Union 
with associations of historians in 
Britain and France. 
These new plans will enable the 
examination and mutual criticism of 
history books to take place between 
Belgium and Holland, France and the 
United States and between Germany 
‘and the following countries : Bel- 
gium, the United States, Norway, 
Holland, Sweden and Switzerland. 
As a pattern for these exchange 
systems, the members of the Seminar 
used the successful work already 
accomplished by the Norden Asso- 
ciations, which were founded after 
the first World War by Denmark, 
“Finland, Iceland, Norway and 
Sweden to promote mutual under- 
standing between the peoples of the 
Nordic countries. 
The system these countries deve- 
loped to ensure that their school 
history books were both factual and 
fair was based on the three cardinal 
‘principles of textbook improvement 
—that it should be international, 
mutual and positive. In other words, 
that each country should examine the 
books of another, and that not only 
should offending passages be remov- 
ed but each country should make 
a complete and constructive study 
of its neighbour’s history with a 
view to improving the coverage in 
its textbooks. 
FROM EAST AND WEST 
T HE plans drawn up at the Brussels 
Seminar for mutual exchange 
and criticism of history books 
should give a new impetus and 
guidance to the movements for 
textbook improvement in all the 
countries represented there. 
In addition to most of the Euro- 
pean Unesco Member States, educa- 
tors came from Canada, Mexico and 
the United States in the New World ; 
Egypt, Iraq, Israel, Syria and Turkey 
in the Near East ; and from Thailand 
and Japan in the Far East. The 
Seminar’s work was directed by 
Professor Alfred Weiler, Director of 
the Lycée Expérimental Henri IV, at 
Montgeron, France. 
Technical problems of the impro- 
vement of textbooks in all subjects 
were dealt with by Group 1, directed 
by Professor P. A. Lauwerys of the 
University of London Institute of 
Education. Its members studied 
reports on such varied textbooks as 
historical atlases, literary antholo- 
gies, song-books and geography and 
history texts, all of which showed 
an undue degree of nationalist bias. 
The group therefore recommended 
that all types of textbooks should 
be studied with the same critical 
care usually reserved for history 
books. 
NO TEXTBOOK SLAVES 
RrRouP 11, directed by Professor 
Haakon Vigander, of Oslo, 
author of the Unesco booklet 
on Nordic textbook improvement, 
concentrated on textbook problems 
in the classroom. Among the con- 
clusions they reached on this subject 
was that the key to reform lay in 
training teachers to evaluate text- 
books and to develop initiative in 
the use of varied materials. At all 
costs, they said, teachers must not 
be the slave of the textbook. 
Problems both of writing scienti- 
fically sound history textbooks and 
their psychological effects on 
children were dealt with by 
Group III, conducted by M. Georges 
Panchaud, Director of the Lycée Mu- 
nicipal de Jeunes Filles, at Lau- 
sanne. : 
To achieve objectivity in history 
textbooks, the Group recommended 
that texts should be submitted, 
before printing, to historians of other 
countries, as was done under the 
“Nordic” system. Unesco was asked 
to help provide authors with reliable 
source material. 
The last group, directed by Pro- 
fessor F.W. Wood of Wellington 
University, New Zealand, studied 
such problems as the relationship of 
national to world history. 
Unesco’s programme of textbook 
improvement was outlined to the 
Seminar by Mr. Richard M. Perdew 
and Mr, Marcel Vanhamme, directors 
of this programme in the Department 
of Education. The final report of the 
Seminar’s work will be used as a 
basis for two projected publications 
and will also provide Unesco with 
some useful suggestions for future 
activities in the textbook field.

An exhibition of teaching aids and equipment was held at MacDonald College. near Montreal. 
Canada. in connection with the Unesco Seminar on “The Teaching of Geography as an Aid 
to International Understanding.” Here. M. Jean Guiton, Deputy Head of Unesco’s Education 
Department, explains to a member of the Seminar the details of a planisphere constructed by 
the young pupils of a Paris technical training school. The planisphere was designed to 
illustrate the interdependence of all countries and its execution provided «a series of lessons 
on people of other lands for the youngsters who built it. 
“ONE WORLD?” 
Geography for 
\ TOC man today can escape being 
N a geographer. His whole 
life, even to his most every- 
day activities—the despatch of 
the products of his work, the get- 
ting in of supplies, keeping up-to- 
date with the latest news—is 
bound up so closely with what is 
- going on in countries that were 
merely names to his forbears, that 
he cannot help but acquire a great 
deal of knowledge concerning all 
parts of the world. 
In former times, men may have 
had a fair knowledge of their dis- 
trict, their country and the neigh- 
bouring states (particularly those 
with which they had, all too often, 
to go to war) but they knew little 
about the rest of the world. Today, 
when almost unknown places may 
overnight become of world-wide 
importance, the scope of geogra- 
phical knowledge has been greatl 
extended and the stock of suc 
knowledge needed by the average 
person has become much larger. 
It is wrong, however, to tax the 
memories of children with masses 
of miscellaneous and ill-assorted 
names and facts. What they 
should know are those geographi- 
cal facts which give a true picture 
of life in other countries, for one 
of the essential purposes of geogra- 
phy and its teaching is to correct 
wrong ideas about other lands and 
peoples. In creating good relations 
among nations, this is an urgent 
necessity. 
Ways in which geography !each- 
ing can best encourage world-mind- 
edness and international under- 
standing were studied by nearly 
50 teachers and specialists who met 
recently at a Unesco Seminar, held 
at MacDonald College, near Mont- 
real, Canada.

blems of the improvement of textbooks. 
all the World 
tries, pooled their knowledge and 
experience in discussions on the 
improvement of teaching methods 
and materials. 
Making a comparative study of 
geography teaching in the schools 
of different countries, the Seminar 
members came across many pro- 
blems arising out of faulty empha- 
sis in teaching or lack of suitable 
equipment. 
Many geography instructors have 
to rely on their own initiative to 
give their pupils a true picture of 
the world, for wall maps and atla- 
ses are lacking in many schools. 
Even when maps do exist, the co- 
lours and perspectives used often 
give them a disproportionate value, 
some countries receiving too much 
prominence and others not enough. 
Links 
MONG the recommendations ma- 
de by the Seminar and aimed 
at overcoming such difficulties 
was for a textbook on geography 
teaching to be widely cireulated SO 
as to keep teachers, in countries 
lacking such information, in touch 
with activities in other parts of 
the world. Another was that an 
“international” atlas, printed in 
colours, but without place names, 
be produced and sold at cost price 
to editors who would then complete 
it for the schools in their countries. 
Each member of the Seminar 
worked with two groups, one 
studying geography teaching in - 
relation to the mental development 
of children in different age groups 
and the other examining the main 
aspects of geography teaching—- 
the training of leachers, teaching 
aids, programmes and methods, 
geography and international under- 
standing etc. 
Members of the Seminar are now 
back in their home countries put- 
ting into practice the individual 
plan of action that each one pre- 
pared before leaving MacDonald 
College. These activities include 
interviews with representatives of 
educational authorities, parents’ 
associations, and programme pre- 
paration commitlees, and the for- 
mation of special groups to conti- 
nue the work begun at the seminar, 
including the publicizing of the 
work and needs through newspa- 
pers and the radio. 
From the Seminar reports and 
documents, a British expert, Mr Ne- 
ville Scarfe, is to produce an 
overall work on Geography and 
International Understanding, which 
will complete the handbook prepar- 
ed as a working document for the 
Seminar by a group of French geo- 
graphers.

How many of Korea's schools will be standing when the fighting is over ? Considerable 
efforts had been made to improve and increase educational facilities since 1845. but much 
of this has almost certainly been wiped out in the first three months of the war. 


### 81570: Five years, and three months, in Korean education

FIVE YEARS — AND THREE 
MONTHS - IN KOREAN 
EDUCATION 
by Robert LOMBARD 
of Japanese rule. Japanese was the only language taught in primary schools 
and in Universities. Administrative personnel, principals, head teachers 
and inspectors were nearly all Japanese. 
In both South and North Korea, radical changes have been made since 1945 
to increase and improve education and restore its national character. 
1 N 1945, education in Korea was almost entirely the product of forty years 
In South Korea, the proportion of national funds spent on education has risen 
from 3.6 per cent to about 10 per cent; the primary school enrolment has 
increased from 1,500,000 to 2,500,000; the number of Koreans attending middle 
schools has risen from 62,000 to 225,000. The Imperial Japanese University 
has been re-organized and combined with a number of other Colleges into the 
new National University of Seoul, with an attendance, since 1945, of 8,000 
students. It possesses a library of half a million oriental books and about 
150,000 western volumes. Korea University, a private Foundation, which has 
an enrolment of about 1,000, received University status in 1946. 
There are also a number of Christian and Buddhist Colleges and Seminaries 
in Seoul; higher education has always been concentrated in the Seoul region, 
where, about 85 per cent of the country’s educational facilities exist. 
Similar progress is reported to have been made in North Korea where uni- 
versal elementary education was introduced in 1947 and where, at the end of 
1948, there were 720 secondary schools and 11 higher educational institutions 
including a University established at Pyongyang. An extensive campaign 
against illiteracy was begun in North Korea in 1946. 
In five years, throughout the whole country, important progress had been 
made. Instruction is now given everywhere in Korean, and illiteracy has been 
reduced from 50 per cent to 20 per cent. 
There are, however, very serious deficiencies, particularly a shortage of 
teachers (the majority of whom in 1945 were Japanese) and a lack of text- 
books in Korean. There is a shortage of school buildings and most of the 
existing ones are poorly equipped. Technical and vocational training is 
practically non-existent. 
Considerable progress had been made to improve education in Korea during 
the past five years—but most of it has almost certainly been destroyed by the 
material losses, social chaos and economic dislocations caused by three short 
months of the present conflict.

### 81571: How UNESCO can help the Korean people

  
HOW UNESCO CAN HELP 
THE KOREAN PEOPLE 
O support United Nations 
action in Korea, Unesco’s Exe- 
cutive Board has approved the 
opening of a credit fund of $175,000 
of which $50,000 is to finance a 
programme of education directed 
towards a better understanding of 
the ideals of the United Nations 
and the principle of collective secu- 
rity. The remaining $125,000 is to 
be used for emergency aid and the 
restoration of educational facilities 
in Korea. 
Unesco can help the Koreans in 
the following ways: 
A SPECIAL MISSION 
Unesco must first investigate the 
nature and extent of the educa- 
tional needs of the Koreans. If the 
United Nations consider it ne- 
cessary, a special mission of experts 
will be sent to Korea. These ex- 
perts, working with the Unified 
Command and with the Specializ- 
ed Agencies ‘of the United Nations 
will find out the most urgent needs. 
Longer-term plans, concerning the 
future educational needs of Korea, 
when peace has been restored, will 
also be considered. 
URGENT EDUCATIONAL NEEDS 
Because of the widespread de- 
struction in Korea, it is likely that 
schools will be in need of even the 
most elementary equipment. Unes- 
co’s emergency aid must include 
help in the reconstruction of 
schools or at least in the provision 
of temporary educational facilities 
in areas where the need is greatest. 
To equip schools, supplies of all 
kinds: blackboards, exercise books, 
pencils will be needed. Supplies 
required for the higher grades of 
education are likely to include labo- 
ratory and technical equipment and 
books and periodicals for the Uni- 
versity of Seoul and the colleges at 
Seoul, Taegu and Pusan. 
MATERIAL AID 
"Unesco is already considering 
how it can bring material help to 
the people of Korea. Such help 
could include clothing for school 
children and students and grants 
to refugee students and teachers. 
The provision of food, particu- 
larly milk, to Korean schoolchildren 
is likely to fall within the sphere of 
operations of the United Nations 
International Children Emergency 
Fund. 
PEDAGOGIC CENTRE. 
If requested by the Republic of 
Korea, Unesco could set up a tem- 
porary pedagogic centre. there. 
It is understood that the Spe- 
cialized Agencies of the United Na- 
tions will work together as a team, 
each being responsible for urgent 
measures in its own particular field. 
The Secretary-General has appoint- 
ed a Director of Civilian Relief for 
Korea, Brigadier Parminter, form- 
erly of UNR.R.A, who has al- 
ready taken up his duties at Lake 
Success. A Chief of Mission in the 
field has also been appointed and 
the nucleus of a United Nations 
relief organization is being created 
in South Korea. 
 
The tragic plight of hundreds of thousands of refugees who have fled to the South 
of Korea calls for the immediate provision of relief services and supplies. Before the 
end of August incomplete reports gave the refugee population of South Korea as over 
1.500.000, most of them living under pitiable conditions.

As part of its relief work since 1946, Unesco has given 
special assistance to the children’s communities in which 
war handicapped children are helped and re-educated. 
At one of these communities, The Children’s Republic, 
at Moulin-Vieux, France, the boys, shown above in their 
printing shop. prepare and publish their own newspaper. 
United Nations action in Korea, has already five 
years’ experience of co-operation in the rehabi- 
litation of education in devastated countries. 
During this time, it has stimulated and co-ordi- 
nated the reconstruction work of international 
organizations, and in cases of particular urgency 
has distributed immediate relief. 
To raise funds for reconstruction, Unesco has 
organized campaigns which have brought in large 
sums of money. In 1948 and 1949 it published 
the “Book of Needs’, the first volume of which 
deals with Europe and the second with Asia. 
They give a full and authoritative account of the 
losses suffered by the educational systems of each 
country as the result of the war, and showed 
more fortunate peoples how their generosity could 
best be applied. 
There were many other special publications, 
calling attention to the specific needs of schools, 
laboratories, universities, libraries and museums 
which had suffered wartime destruction. 
Two types of relief have been provided for emer- 
gency relief drawn from the regular budget of 
Unesco and funds raised through the Organiz- 
ation’s appeals or campaigns or from direct gifts 
to (Umesco. The following sums have been distri- 
uted:

MERGENCY relief was provided for children 
E in Greece and in the Middle East. In 
Greece, grants were allocated to ten primary 
schools, while in the Middle East thirty-nine 
temporary schools were opened for children in 
- refugee camps immediately after the war in Pa- 
lestine. Thirty-three thousand children are given 
a primary education in these schools by six 
hundred and thirty-eight teachers, themselves 
refugees. 
Unesco has strongly supported the International 
Voluntary Work Camps whose work helps mate- 
rial reconstruction and develops international 
understanding. 
Special help has been given to the International 
Federation of Children’s Communities whose 
work and aims Unesco publicizes. Unesco has 
also sponsored this Federation's activities, such 
as the International Children's Camp organized 
at Moulin-Vieux in the Isére Valley, France, in 
1949. 
Since the establishment of the Reconstruction 
Department, now replaced by the Relief Assistance 
Service, 17 pamphlets, designed to solicit help for 
the cultural reconstruction of devastated coun- 
tries, have been published. Unesco has produced 
a film on the problem of neglected children, and 
has made twenty-two radio recordings dealing 
with the work of cultural reconstruction. Tra- 
velling exhibitions have been prepared and 
despatched to the United States of America, Ca- 
nada, the Netherlands and Germany in support 
of reconstruction campaigns. An exhibition deal- 
ing with the International Voluntary Work Camps 
was held in Belgium and several panels illustrat- 
ing the work of the Service have been exhibited 
in the Salon de I’Enfance in Paris.

Korea, Mr. Torres Bodet pointed 
“out that “the activities we can under- 
take consist in sharing, to the full mea- 
sure of our abilities, in the reconstruc- 
tion of Korea, just as we are already 
contributing to that of many war-devas- 
tated countries.” 
Mr. Torres Bodet also defined Unes- 
co's attitude toward aggression. “In 
condemning aggression wherever it 
appears”, he said, “Unesco adopts an 
attitude consonant with the notion of 
peace within the law which its Consti- 
tution proclaims... Far from being an 
instrument of ideological war, our 
Institution is first and foremost an 
organ of educalion for peace under the 
w”., : } Co 
Human Rights In Peril 
N order that Unesco may aid the 
I United Nations in eliminating the 
dangers of war more effectively, 
the Board stressed the view that “it is 
particularly urgent at this moment 
“when human solidarity is under trial 
and when human rights are in peril, 
that still wider and more active support 
should be given to the execution of its 
mission, by Governments and National 
Commissions of Member States”. 
Ten members of the Board spoke in 
connection with their support of the 
help which Unesco proposes to provide 
to the Korean civilian population in 
answer to the United Nations’ appeal. 
M. Hassan el Diwani, speaking on 
behalf of Shafik Ghorbal bey, Under 
Secretary of State of the Egyptian Mi- 
nistry of Public Instruction, said that he 
vigorously condemned aggression and 
‘that “the vigour and the prompltitude 
with which the United Nations have 
dealt with the conflict in Korea con- 
trasts with their attitude vis-a-vis other 
cases of aggression and of violation of 
sovereignty of others members of the 
Organization”. : 
Luther H. Evans, Library of Congress 
of the United States, stressed the duties 
of Unesco in relation to the United Na- 
tions. “The duty of Unesco is plain”, 
he said. “It must fulfil its obligation 
to the United Nations by explaining to 
the peoples of the world, with the help 
of teachers, scholars, writers and other 
leaders in the communication of knowl- 
edge and ideas, thal the issue in Korea 
is clearly drawn between the defense of 
peace and permitting brute aggression 
to succeed... Unesco can have no 
greater task than to uphold the United 
Nations as the defender of peace, and 
must do its full part in rebuilding the 
shattered life of the Korean nation.” 
A Great Revival Of Confidence 
ARDAR MALIK, Ambassador of India 
S in Paris, said the decision of the 
Board was the answer of Un:-sce 
to the appeal of the United Nations, and 
that the contribution of Unesco would 
be of inestimable value for the Korean 
civilian population. “All this is very 
valuable”, he declared. “But, looking 
at it from a wider angle, the work that 
lies ahead of us in the field of education. 
is even more important. We can eli- 
minate war only if the whole world is 
convinced that aggression cannot be 
tolerated, that the great principles of 
human rights, of the rule of law, of 
social and economic justice, and of 
collective security, are vital principles 
that each and every one of us must be 
prepared to accept and help to enforce.” 
M. Roger Seydoux, Director of 
Cultural Exchanges at the French 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, contrasted 
the speed with which the United Nations 
took its stand and sent forces to Korea 
with the hesitancies about plans for 
sanctions at the time of the League of 
Nations. “The first soldier of the 
United Nations who disembarked in 
Korea”, he said, “started a great revival 
‘woman to a philosopher. 
Torres 
of confidence in the United Nations 
throughout the world, and increased the 
feeling that any breach of international 
law might expect to be punished”. 
“In response. to requests from the - 
United Nations and the Economic and 
Social Council for help from the Spe- 
cialized Agencies”, said M. Seydoux, 
“we are giving our help in complete 
fidelity to our mission, by using the 
only means at our disposal, and in strict 
conformity with the terms of our Cons- 
titution — to promote peace, by educa- 
tion, science and culture”. 
The Duty Of Philosophers 
ROFESSOR Paulo Carneiro, perma- 
nent delegate of Brazil to Unesco, 
recalled a remark made by a 
“The duty 
of philosophers”, she said, “is to stand 
up against swords without carrying 
swords”. This, according to- Professor 
Carneiro, is the mission of Unesco, 
“Morality”, he added, “must not be 
subordinated to politics, and there can 
be no morality where the spirit which 
inspires Unesco is absent. We asso- 
ciate ourselves with the crusade for 
peace in order that we may build a 
peace based upon justice and the res- 
pect for law”. : : 
The importance and meaning of the 
Board's decision were also stressed by 
a nuwinber of other members, including 
Senora Geronima Pecson, member of the 
Senate of the Philippines ; Professor 
Alex Photiades of Greece ; Dr. Rafael 
Jimenez of Colombia ; Monsignor Jean 
Maroun of Lebanon; and M. Xudsi 
Tecer of Turkey. 
In a statement to the Board, Benjamin 
Cohen, Assistant Secretary-General of 
the United Nations in charge of in- 
formation, conveyed to the members the 
thanks of Mr. Trygve Lie, Secretary- 
General, for the speed with which they 
had responded favourably to the re- 
quest of the United Nations. “While 
men are dying in Korea”, he said, “the 
United Nations Organization does not 
confine itself to the task of repelling 
aggression. It is also working to res- 
tore the normalcy of the lives of the 
peoples who are suffering from the 
effects of the aggression in order to 
help them bridge this terrible period 
until peace has been restored. 
 
Mr. Benjamin Cohen, Assistant Secre- 
tary-General of the United Nations in 
charge of Public Information, thanked,

cretary-General, the Unesco Executive 
Board for its response to the call for

      T0 HELP TEACHING 
TED NATIONS PRINC] 
NESCo is undertaking an intensive campaign to improve the teach- 
ing of the principles of the United Nations in schools, adult 
classes and universities of Member States throughout the world. 
Particular emphasis is being put on the necessity for collective 
security, based on respect for law. 
The campaign, while continuing Unesco’s normal activities as an 
organ of education about United Nations principles of peace through 
collective security, is intended to encourage more effective and dynamic 
methods of teaching these principles. 
To assist members of teaching staffs, adult educators, university 
professors and others concerned with teaching, Unesco is asking dis- 
tinguished writers in a number of countries to prepare in close collabor- 
ation with the United Nations, written and audio-visual teaching mate- 
rials. These include pamphlets, books, maps, charts and bulletins 
adapted to the various levels of instruction, ranging from those designed 
to present the case for collective security in an elementary school manner 
to scholarly studies on the concept of international law written by leading 
experts. 
Teaching Aids For All Levels 
HREE types of written material are being prepared in the French, 
English and Spanish languages for distribution to Unesco’s Na- 
tional Commissions. These will include a pamphlet designed for 
- use in high schools and adult classes; a simplified version of this pam- 
phlet supplemented by advice about practical class room methods for the 
teaching of collective security and other UN principles; third, a book 
for a public on a more advanced educational level. 
The visual teaching materials include wall charts and coloured maps 
which can be reproduced in black and white to permit wide class-room 
distribution. It is expected that National Commissions in’ countries 
where instruction is given in languages other than French, Spanish and 
English will.arrange for translations and adaptations. 
Unesco is arranging for an initial printing of 10,000 copies each of 
the two kinds of pamphlets, and of 12,000 for maps and wall charts. 
But the programme is based on the assumption that National Commis- 
sions will arrange for reprinting and distribution of many times these 
totals. ° : 
In carrying out the educational campaign Unesco will not only be 
putting into effect the unanimous decision of its Executive Board that 
the Organization should, within its resources and province of activity, 
develop teaching about the UN. It is also using the present international 
situation as the point of departure for increased activity in an area 
assigned to it by its Constitution — help for teaching that tends to 
lead toward the abolition of war, the replacement of violence by reason, 
and the substitution of solidarity for international rivalry. 
Unesco is also carrying out the instructions of its Executive Board 
that it put at the disposal of the Secretary General of the United Nations 
two specialists in the field of education with orders to co-operate with 
the UN Secretariat in order to assemble relevant documentation in 
connection with the United Nations action.

Chapman.

NE day, in September 1940, 
O two French boys, Marsal 
and Ravidat, were walk- 
    
ing along a wooded ridge 
above the Vézére River, near the 
village of Montignac in Southwest 
France. Their dog Robot chased 
a rabbit into a deep hole and in 
attempting to rescue the dog, the 
children worked their way down 
into a cave which subsequently 
proved to contain the finest collec- 
tion of pre-historic paintings yet 
found. 
Although similar paintings had 
been found in other caves and rock 
shelters in this region, those at 
Lascaux were unique in their excel- 
lent state of preservation, many 
being as vividly etched and coloured 
as when they were painted at 
various times between 12,000 and 
30,000 years ago. 
 
The largest mural in the Lascaux cave, where about 500 paintings 
of animals were found. Close to many of the paintings are curious 
eye-like signs, probably meant to represent the magical eye of the 
hunter, and placed there to ensure success in the hunt.

In a deep and almost inaccessible shaft, the archaeologists explo- 
ring the cave found what was probably the record of some prehis- 
toric drama. It showed a man with a bird’s head, apparently dead 
— the only human figure among the Lascaux paintings. Close by 
were a totem-like bird and « bison pierced through with a spear. 
Page 9 — UNESCO COURIER 
Like all other female animals on the walls of the cave, this Chinese- 
like horse is pregnant, expressing a wish by the men who made the 
paintings that their food supply be assured. The darts behind the 
animal are magic symbols of the wish for hunting success. 
  
The original opening to the Lascaux cave through which the two boys 
shown in this photograph. Ravidat and Marsal, found their way to 
the siorehouse of prehistoric art. With the boys are (left) M. Léon 
Laval, a member of the « Société Prehistorique Frangaise » and the 
Abbé Breuil, an eminent French archaeologist. 
It was only after the Liberation 
of France that other countries 
learned of this important disco- 
very. Among the journalists who 
visited the cave was an American, 
William Chapman, who, having 
already seen several art films based 
on direct photography of the 
paintings of great masters, concei- 
ved the idea of bringing the pre- 
historic paintings of Lascaux to 
the screen. 
It was not until 1948 that he 
was able to carry out his project. 
He had never before made a film 
and he had to overcome many 
technical difficulties. All his heavy 
equipment, for example, had to be 
hauled up the hillside by oxen. 
  
Dr. Robert C. Angell, head of the 
«pensions and International Un-~ 
derstanding” project of Unesco’s 
Social Sciences Programme, since 
September 1949, left Paris last 
month to return to his former po- 
sition as Chairman of the Sociology 
Department of the University of 
Michigan. Since the sudden death 
of Dr. Arthur Ramos, last October, 
Dr. Angell had served as acting 
head of Unesco’s Social Sciences 
Department. Dr. Angell returned to 
the United States on September 1st 
to attend the annual meeting of 
the American Sociological Society 
of which he was recently elected 
president. He is taking up his 
presidential duties at the end of the 
meeting. 
 
+ College for Pre-School Teachers, in 
Mrs. Alva Myrdal, Principal Di- 
rector of the Department of Social 
Affairs, of the United Nations since 
February 1949, has now taken 
charge of Unesco’s Department of 
Social Sciences. 
Mrs. Myrdal, an outstanding so- 
ciologist, has had a distinguished 
career as an educationist and leader 
in social affairs. From 1936 to 
1948, she directed the Training 
Stockholm, which she founded. 
From 1944 to 1948, Mrs. Myrdal 
served ‘with many international 
organizations including the Inter- 
national Union for the Scientific 
Study of Populations, the Inter- 
national Federation of University 
Women, the World Federation of 
UN Associations, and the World 
Council for Early Childhood Educa- 
ion.     
cian. 
Chapman used colour film from 
the United States, and took his 
shots with a camera loaned from 
London, with the aid of lighting 
provided by a French . electri- 
He was encouraged in his 
work by Robert Flaherty, the well- 
known producer of documentary 
films and a grant from the “Viking 
Fund” enabled him to finish his 
work. Co 
The result, “Lascaux : Cradle of 
Man’s Art”, which has just been 
shown for the first time in Europe 
at the Antibes Film Festival, is a 
remarkable colour film of the paint- 
ings that cover the limestone 
walls. : : 
There are paintings of deer, 
bison, wild horses, bulls, a totem- 
like bird and many others. Some 
“animals are shown pursued by dots 
and arrows, magic symbols for 
hunting success, it is thought. All 
the female animals are pregnant, 
signifying a wish that the food 
supply continue. There is one 
remarkable picture of a horse, his 
body shaded to indicate a third 
dimension, his head turned and 
fore-shortened, his ears shown in 
a natural way. This may be 
the first discovered painting 
that attempts modern perspective. 
Then, there are paintings on top of 
paintings, done thousands of years 
apart. 
Only One Human Figure 
Ox= large section of the cave is 
covered with huge black bulls, 
some of them twenty feet long and 
‘worked in among them are other 
animals like galloping ponies. No- 
where in the history of cave paint- 
ing have animals as large as these 
ever been found. There is only 
one human figure in the cave; it 
is shown with bison and a totem- 
like bird. There are also multitu- 
dinous symbols and dots which may 
be the beginnings of writing and 
mathematics. 
Everything has been success- 
fully captured on film and the 
commentary, spoken by Mr. Chap- 
man himself, is intelligently help- 
ful to an appreciation of the 
drawings. 
Temple Of The Hunters 
CHOLARS think that the cave 
found by the boys in 1940 and 
since called Lascauzx, was a temple 
devoted to securing, through magic, 
an abundance of food in those re- 
mote times when man was solely a 
hunter, before he had learned to 
sow crops and before he had domes- 
ticated animals. In addition to 
showing the cave paintings, the 
film also shows some of the sites in 
the region, where many important 
discoveries about pre-historic man 
have been made. Lascaux opens a 
door into the past and it empha- 
sizes the rapidly growing belief 
that the teaching of history must 
soon begin with pre-history. 
The study of pre-history is only 
about a hundred years old. And 
it was not until the paintings in 
the Spanish caves at Altimira were 
found in 1879 that anyone thought 
of ancient man as an artist. 
Through this and subsequent 
discoveries, culminating in the 
amazing find at Lascaux, scientists 
are gradually taking a new view 
of mankind’s early history. 
Chapman’s 16 mm sound and 
colour film which runs for 17 mi- 
nutes was made especially for uni- 
versities, colleges, schools, museums 
and community groups. 
Lascaux has been called : “The 
capital of a lost continent in the 
mind of prehistoric man”. Cer- 
‘tainly for those interested in art, 
archaeology, anthropology, humani- 
ties and kindred subjects, this film 
offers insight, inspiration and 
opportunity for countless hours of 
study.

up by Jeunesse et Reconstruction 
and Service Civil International 
under the auspices of the French 
National Commission for Unesco 
which provided the funds. These 
young people gave up their month’s 
vacation to help the people of 
Saugnac, a village whose popula- 
tion had dwindled from 1,800 to 
650 as the result of repeated forest 
fires in the region. : 
Using scythes and spades, they 
dug mile after mile of fire breaks 
to check future forest fires. They 
tilled the soil and made it ready 
for crops. They cleared land 
which was charred brush as a 
result of past fires. They lived 
in tents and primitive shacks 
where they did their own cooking 
and washing. 
At the end of the day, they 
gathered around wooden tables to 
talk and to deepen friendships 
begun while they worked side by 
side in the fields. It was an 
enlivening and stimulating expe- 
rience for these young folk who 
came from all walks of life — 
students, workers, sailors, teachers, 
dancers and journalists — and 
whose homes lay as far apart as 
Yugoslavia and Chile, Finland and 
New Zealand. 
In their leisure time they read 
books from the Unesco Library set 
up in the camp, or exchanged per- 
sonal experiences. All the while, 
they were gaining an insight into 
the life of their new friends from 
other lands and an affection for 
the “Landais’” whose soil they were 
helping to bring back to fertility. 
They left many friends behind 
them in the village of Saugnac et 
Muret. The work done by these 
international work camps gave the 
villagers fresh heart and confidence 
for the future. :

HIS summer one of the most 
beautiful buildings in 
Luxembourg, the castle of 
Sanem, a} Esch-sur-Alzette, 
became for one month, a 
Europe in miniature. Forty children 
— all war victims — aged between 
14 and 17, arrived there and se{ up 
an international, self-governing camp. 
Among them were Dutch, Germans, 
Italians, Swiss, Belgians, French and 
English. 
They came from some of the child- 
ren's communities which have sprung - 
up all over Europe in the past few 
years, In these communities live 
boys and girls whose parents have 
been killed or deported children who 
have become delinquents for lack of 
proper home life, and who have been 
taken off the sireets and out of 
unhealthy slums to be given the 
chance of becoming self-respecting 
and respected members of a commu- 
nity. : 
On the invitation of the Luxem- 
bourg Teachers” Federation, the camp 
was organized under the auspices of 
Unesco and the FICE (Federation 
Internationale de Communautés d’En- 
fants). The castle of Sanem was 
loaned to the FICE by the Commune 
of Esch-sur-Alzette and contributions 
from Luxembourg school-children 
provided the up-kecp of their guests 
from other countries. 
As a token of thanks to their hosts, 
the children attending the camp, re- 
paired. and decorated a room in the 
castle, which is now being turned 
into a permanent community for the 
children of Luxembourg. 


### 74441: Europe's orphans learn to live again and to laugh

FUROPE'S ORPHANS LEARN TO LIVE 
AGAIN = AND TO LAUGH 
Excursions were arranged so that 
the children could learn about their 
host country. Living and working 
together, they wrote and produced 
plays in five languages and composed, 
songs and verses. 
One result of this mingling of dif- 
ferent nationalities was an appeal 
drafted by them and addressed to all 
children’s communities. It called 
on the Communities to unite in efforts 
0: 
“prevent new wars from setting the 
youth of the world against each 
other” ; and, 
“improve the spirit of responsibility 
and constructive work in all commu- 
nities and collaboration between 
em”. ” 
The Sanem camp also provided an 
opportunity for educationists lo 
observe the psychological and physi- 
cal development of the children, most 
of whom have suffered mentally and 
physically from their experiences 
during and since the war. 
Before they left the Sanem camp 
last month, the children decided to 
organize and finance a similar camp 
next year and formed an internatio- 
nal secretariat, in which they invited 
FICE to join. In the meantime, they 
intend to publish their own periodi- 
cal review. A member of the Re- 
naissance Community in Rome will 
assemble and edit the material and 
send it to Odenwaldschule in Germa- 
ny for printing. From there it will 
go out to children’s communities — 
each contribution being printed in its 
original language.

UNESCO-CARE 
PROGRAMME IS 
HELPING WAR- 
LIBRARIES 
URING the past year, nearly 
$ 900,000 worth of new books 
have reached the shelves of 
war-damaged and depleted libra- 
ries in twenty-three countries 
under the programme operated by 
CARE (Cooperative for American 
Remittances to Europe and Asia) 
at the instigation and with the 
co-operation of Unesco. 
These books, providing the 
latest available information for 
technical studies om such subjects 
as applied science, medicine, 
forestry, pedagogy and many 
others, were the gift of profession- 
al groups, colleges, research 
councils, women’s organizations 
and private individuals in the 
United States. 
Purchases were made by CARE 
on the basis of lists supplied by 
Unesco, reflecting the greatest 
needs of libraries in all parts of 
the world. Help was also given by 
publishers who offered discounts 
to cover the cost of packing and 
export, and from customs authori- 
ties who waived duties on the 
cases of books. 
In addition, arrangements were 
made for 60,000 volumes of mew 
and used books and periodicals not 
on the established lists to be dis- 
tributed through Member Agencies.

### 81579: Ecuador's newspapers lead a nation-wide fight against illiteracy

dl  
ECUADOR’S NEWSPAPERS LEAD A NATION-WIDE FIGH 
AGAINST ILLITERACY 
N 1934, a newspaper in Guayaquil, Ecuador, “El 
I Telegrafo”, began to devote space in its columns 
to weekly lessons suitable for teaching illite- 
rates to read. From this small beginning has 
grown a nation-wide campaign, started and backed 
by the National Press Union (Union Nacional de 
Periodistas) of Ecuador. 
In this unique experiment — the only anti-illi- 
teracy campaign brganized and directed by a group 
of newspapers — the National Press Union has 
used the organs of press and radio to give the 
campaign wide publicity throughout the country. 
“Co-operation Cominittees” have been set up in 
towns and villages, compo- 
sed of representatives of 
cultural associations, admi- 
  
for the anti-illiteracy campaign 
organized by the National Press 
Union in Ecuador, teachers are re- 
cruited from all sections of the po- nistrative bodies, municipal 
councils, workers’ organiza- 
tions and members of the 
clergy. These have mobi- 
lized teachers and private 
individuals to help in the 
campaign and have encou- 
raged illiterates to join the 
classes. 
To support the scheme, 
the Government of Ecuador 
has issued two series of 
stamps, each having a total 
value of 500,000 sucres 
(about $30,000). 
The campaign organized 
by the National Press 
Union which began in 1942, 
and another on a smaller 
scale instituted by the Liga 
de Ensenanza de Analfabe- 
tes de Guayaquil the fol- 
lowing year were originally 
private enterprises. 
Diploma 
Of Citizenship 
N 1945, however, the 
Government passed a 
law which aimed at making 
every citizen of Ecuador 
able to read and write. Just 
how immense a task this 
represents is indicated by 
statistics published in 1944, 
according to which 52 9% of 
Ecuador’s population of 
3,400,000 was illiterate at 
that time. 
The problem of illiteracy 
is also complicated by the 
fact that 27 % of the popu- 
lation is Indian, most of 
whom are illiterate and who 
speak Quechua. A large 
number have no knowledge 
of Spanish. 
For the Indians who have 
a fair knowledge of Spanish, 
the National Press Union 
prepared ‘“cartillas”, or 
elementary illustrated read- 
ers, in this language. For 
those knowing very little 
Spanish, there is a “ecar- 
tilla” with explanations in 
Quechua, but the pupil is 
taught to read and write in 
Spanish. 
Teachers are recruited 
from among all sections of 
the literate population, but 
as it is impossible to pay 
them any salary a system 
of bonuses is used, the 
teacher in each campaign 
area, claiming the most 
new-literates gaining a 
prize of 1,000 sucres ($ 60)  
At the village of Chibuleo in the Province of Tungurahua, a 
volunteer from one of the regional offices of the Ecuadorian 
National Press Union explains to an Indian instructor how to 
use the ‘“cartilla”, an elementary illustrated reader. 
and any teacher 
with eight literate 
“pupils to his credit 
qualifying for a 
100 sucre bonus. 
A “Diploma of 
Patriotism” is also’ 
awarded to tea- 
chers, and a “Citi- 
zen’s Diploma” to 
every successful 
candidate in the 
examinations. This 
“Citizen’s  Diplo- 
ma” is not merely 
a certificate of 
merit : it carries 
with it the right of 
the holder to fill a 
public post, to vote 
and to be elected 
as a representative 
of the people. 
As the campaign 
organisers declared 
in a slogan publi- 
cized all over the 
country : “One less 
illiterate means 
one more citizen.” 
A “ Cartilla ” 
For Everyone 
VER a thous- 
and school- 
centres have been 
set up in the 
different provinces 
since 1944. These 
centres organise 
the classes which 
are held in schools, 
barns, factories 
and in the open 
air, sometimes 
with as few as 5 
or 6 pupils. Class

the Indian village of Pingulmi. Pi-

times are arranged to meet 
local conditions and work. 
Factory workers, for exam- 
ple, attend in the evenings 
and waiters during the af- 
ternoons. Each pupil is 
given a pencil and a “car- 
tilla” 
National Press Union. 
Instruction is given on 
two levels : pupils are first 
taught reading, writing 
and a little arithmetic, and 
then after gaining their 
“Citizen’s Diploma”, they 
distributed by the 
can join the second course 
where they study texts on 
history, geography, civics, 
ethics, hygiene and feeding. 
Unfortunately this second 
stage of the campaign has 
been less successful than 
the first. Many of the 
pupils were not interested 
in continuing the classes, 
and there is also a lack of 
teachers to give instruction 
in the more specialised 
subjects. : 
Despite the efforts al- 
ready made, an enormous 
task still awaits -the or- 
ganization and individuals 
carrying out the campaign. 
One of the new and pro- 
mising developments in the 
work is the launching this 
year by the Ecuador Go- 
vernment of a mobile ser- 
vice SARE (Service Ambu- 
lante Rural Equatoriano). 
This will carry the cam- 
paign into those parts of 
the country which are more 
or less cut off from normal 
means of communication. 


### 74444: It happened in October

  
  
9t happened 
in Octoben... 
“It was just a year ago to-day... It was ten 
years ago... This is our Golden Jubilee... This is 
the centenary... Just about a thousand years 
The birthdays of a child, events in the lives 
of individual men and women, commemoration 
of the births and deaths of men and women 
who have lit torches along the road of history, 
red-letter days marking the advance of mankind 
—these are dates traditionally noted in the arbi- 
trary system of reckoning which we call the 
calendar. 
Not forgetting the unknown and unsung per- 
sons and evenls, perhaps of equal greatness 
making no claim at completeness, here are some 
note-worthy dates in October, tenth month of 
the Gregorian calendar. 
“THE GREAT ENCYCLOPAEDIA ” 
Two hundred years ago a Paris bookseller 
issued a prospectus announcing the early public- 
ation of an extraordinary work-—a record of all 
human knowledge. Subscribers were not disap- 
pointed. In a few years, in the face of censure 
and legal disputes, “La Grande Encyclopédie” 
was brought out as 22 folio volumes with eleven 
volumes of plates. The main contributors were 
d’Alembert, d’Holbach and Voltaire. But the 
moving spirit was Diderot who threw himself 
heart and soul into the work. He had become 
the servant of “Reason”, and his encyclopaedia 
remains the boldest monument raised by the 
eighteenth century to the glory of scientific 
thought. 
THE FIRST AEROPLANE 
On 24th October 1890, 
after 50 years’ research, Clé- 
ment Ader thought that his 
aeroplane, christened “Eole”, 
was ready for trials. It was 
a faithful reproduction of a 
large Indian bat, had a 
steam engine and retractable 
wings and was 21 feet in 
length and 45 feet in 
. ! . breadth. It took off and 
glided for about 55 yards at a sp#ed of 17 yards 
a second. For eight years, he made regular tests 
and further improvements, but each attempted 
flight was a dismal failure. Clément Ader lost 
  
- poraries said of him: “he is 
 
heart, but he watched without envy the work 
of his more successful rivals, Santos-Dumont 
and the Wright brothers. . 
GEOFFREY CHAUCER 
On 25th October 1400, 
Geoffrey Chaucer died under 
the shadow of Westminster 
Cathedral where he was 
buried in the chapel known 
to-day as “The Poets’ Cor- 
ner”. Eustache Deschamps, 
one of his French contem- 
  
the great translator whose 
poetry illuminated the reign 
of Aeneas”. But Chaucer was far more than 
a translator : his “Canterbury Tales” belong 
not only to his people but to the literary 
treasure-house of mankind. Dryden said of 
the Tales: “they reflect the varied manners and 
moods of the whole English people”. In writ- 
ing them, he made a selection unheard of in 
his day; his characters were men instead of 
mere symbols. . 
THE SECOND OLYMPIAD 
The second Olympic games, inaugurated a 
few years previously by Baron Pierre de Cou- 
bertin, ended in Paris on 28th October 1900. It 
had not been easy to overcome public indiffer- 
ence and national jealousies. Greece had been 
determined to make Athens, the home of the 
first games, the permanent centre of these sport- 
ing contests. But Coubertin was adamant: “If 
they are to be ultimately successful”, he declar- 
ed, “the Olympic Games must be strictly demo- 
cratic and international.” But, he had to 
persevere for years before sportsmen all over 
the world had accepted the ideal he summed up 
in the famous statement: “What matters in life 
is not victory, but the struggle; the essential is 
not winning but fighting a good fight. In 
spreading these principles we will teach mankind 
to be more courageous, stronger, more scrupulous 
and more generous.”

### 81580: The Cultural heritage of Korea, "land of the morning calm"

  
The Cultural 
“Land of the Morning Calm” 
ND who are these Koreans ? Anonymous John Smith wants to 
know—and finds himself repeating like a chant the question of 
Walt Whitman : “Yellow man, yellow man, where have you been ?” 
Where were the Koreans before the cannons, before the tanks, before the 
bombers ? For, just three months ago, Korea became the centre of the 
world; it rose up suddenly, covered 
with blood. Rose up from ‘what 
historical past? 
  
        
 
KOREA'S FLAG 
NE of the world's most beau- 
tiful flags, that of the Repu- 
lic of Korea has in its centre 
a circle of brilliant red and blue 
on a white background. Both the 
circle and the black bar designs 
in the corners are rich in symbo- 
lism. 
The circle represents the Abso- 
lute, or the essential unity of all 
being. The Yang and the Yin 
divisions within the circle repre- 
sent eternal duality; good and 
evil, male and female, night and 
day, life and death, being and not 
being, etc. The presence of dui- 
lity within the Absolute indicates 
the paradox of life and the im- 
possibility of ever comprehending 
it completely. 
The bar designs in the four cor- 
ners have many meanings, They 
represent the Father, the Mother, 
the Sons, and the Daughters. The 
bar combinations also represent 
the four points of the compass, 
and the four seas which bound 
the universe. The fact that the 
bars are of only two kinds (long 
and short) yet may be arranged 
into many combinations — of 
which the four are but samples 
— indicates the diversity which 
can arise out of basic simplicity. 
Actually, the symbolism of the 
flag has an endless meaning. It 
is sometimeg used as an exer- 
cise in reasoning, or in develop- 
ment of the poetic imagination, as 
students interpret the design in 
manifold ways. For instance, 
the Yang and the Yin, within lhe 
circle, may be likened to the sun 
and the moon, to heaven and 
earth, to old age and youth, to 
beauty and ugliness, to truth and 
deception, to success and failure, 
to happiness and misery, ete. 
From the bar arrangements, 
varied moral lessons may be 
drawn. Thus the weaker (lwo 
short) bars should be protected 
by the stronger (two long ones); 
but in the opposite corner, the 
more precious (long bar) should 
be protected by the less worlhy 
(short bars). Like should cling to 
like, as in the three long bars 
together; but also, tolerance 
should sanction the grouping of 
ufilike, as in the other two bar 
designs. 
The significant fact about the 
Korean flag is not to draw [rom 
it any one specific meaning, but 
rather to recognize that it is a 
symbolic and philosophical repre- 
sentation, encouraging the mind 
to observe and interpret all the 
varied meanings of the universe. 
It #s this function of the Korean 
flag that makes it unique among 
all the banners of the world:     
Not so very long ago this past was 
little more than a phantom to most 
people around the world. A fine co- 
lony, whose inhabitants were ordered 
to forget their past, their national 
soul, even their language which it was 
forbidden, under penalty of the whip, 
to use in schools, even in playtime. 
At the end of the 14th Century, 
there was the kingdom of Tyo-Ssyen, 
Land of the Morning Calm, with its 
capital at Seoul. The land was gov- 
erned by a vassal of the Chinese Ming 
Dynasty. The rare travellers who 
tried to tell the rest of the world about 
the treasures of this kingdom attri- 
buted a Mongolian origin to this 
homogeneous people. They remarked

THE TRADITIONAL DRESS OF THE 
COUNTRY, worn by the elderly Koreans

ed from the Ming dynasty of China. 
For the men it consists of loose white 
robes and baggy trousers. Women 
wear short, close-fitting jackets and 
vividly coloured flowing skirts. 
on the individuality of the language 
and the simplicity of its alphabet of 
25 letters. They recounted a formi- 
dable list of discoveries and inven- 
tions: 
Long known as the “Hermit King- 
dom”, Korea is said to have evolved, 
quite alone, many things which other 
nations produced only by united effort: 
the spinning wheel, the art of pottery, 
movable metal type, paper money, the 
barometer, even the armour-plated 
ships used by Yi Soon-sin to defeat 
Japanese invaders in 1592. 
The Travellers’ Tales 
NCIENT travellers told how educa- 
tion flourished. They actually 
meant Chinese education, for the 
Koreans, it seems, did not consider 
themselves learned unless they could, 
with the light strokes of a brush, show 
themselves conversant with the langu- 
age of Confucius and work their way 
up in the administrative hierarchy, 
relying only on the Chinese classics. 
They judged their own fine alphabet 
too simple, and good enough only for 
children. 
What high ramparts enclosed this 
people! Only the most poetically in- 
clined historians were interested in 
them. Records provide a description 
of thatched cottages where the Ko- 
rean peasant lived, the marriage cere- 
monies and a few ritual dances and 
traditions of native cooking. Most 
travellers gave only a superficial pict- 
ure of their own adventures in Korea. 
THE SOUTH GATE OF SEOUL. The first king of the Yi dynasty conscripted 
200.000 workmen to construct a great wall around Seoul, his new capital. Ii 
was seven miles long, up to 20 feet wide, from 10 to 20 feet high. and contained 
four great gates and four smaller ones. Today, the remains are well inside 
the city, which has grown to over a million in inhabitants. 
Only a few of them recounted Korean 
proverbs. } 
Yet Korea has a rich collection of 
folklore, fables and fairy-tales: Cinde- 
rella is called Kongiji; little Red Riding 
Hood will be eaten up by the tiger. 
Both the tiger and the tortoise figure 
as prominently in Korea as in China; 
the genii or jinns are as powerful as . 
those in Norway. 
Well, in what niche at last can be 
pigeon-holed this “culture” of the old 
ancient lords, of peasants always in 
white, always in mourning, of berib- 
boned dancers and of the silent silk- 
worm breeders crouched on the mud 
floor unwinding the silk that they will 
never wear? . 
Old Beliefs Die Hard 
ELIGION may give an answer. 
There are learned men who give 
this explanation: about two 
thousand years ago, Buddhism was 
introduced into the kingdom of Silla, 
accompanied by a flow of Chinese 
ideas. Buddhism spread its influence 
through the princely courts in mar- 
vellous works of architecture, piety and 
philosophy; .the temples, still rising 
noble and serene above the fir trees 
are favourite subjects of the modern 
photographer. 
Then, Confucianism replaced Bud- 
dhism: and the official doctrines of 
family and national loyalties were built 
on the ruins of monasteries where the 
monks eked out a miserable existence, 
though still receiving the humble de- 
votion of the womenfolk. The ancestor 
cult was confined to the educated 
class: the masses undoubtedly never 
abandoned their old beliefs, their 
sacrifices to Heaven, their rites in 
honour of the Sun, the Moon and the 
Stars. Holy places are still revered, 
mountains shelter genii, and under the 
sacred trees the passer-by still places 
pebbles... 
learned men compiled an encyclo- 
paedia in 112 volumes, but it is doubt- 
ful whether they even wrote about 
these daily practices of the common 
people. In any case, the average Ko- 
rean would not have access to these 
works, for, like the Official Public 
Records, they were not written in his 
language. 
Yet, for more than a thousand years, 
many aspects of Korean art have been 
truly great. Experts have spoken of 
the pottery of the country as the finest 
in the world. It is known that Japa- 
nese sculpture developed in the 6th 
Century from Korean art and that, 
generally speaking, Korea was an 
indispensable channel through which 
civilization was introduced into Japan; 
for many centuries the Japanese called 
Korea the Treasure Land of the West. 
What System of Values? 
ODAY, the sparse accounts of 
historians and adventurers are 
being supplemented by the stories 
of war correspondents with their 
despatches which describe the extent 
  
In the 15th Century, Korean . 
of the ruins, the weight of arms, the 
thousands of fleeing refugees. The 
sufferings of these refugees, some with 
hope in their hearts others dulled with 
misery, can easily be imagined. 
But what system of values have they 
now? Beyond hunger and fear, what

fantasies fill their dreams? What do 
they think about in their waking mo- 
ments? For already they are begin- 
ning to think of the future and their 
thoughts will not be created out of 
nothing; the past is still with them 
and whatever the future holds will be 
influenced and coloured by that almost 
forgotten heritage from their ancestors 
—in short, by their culture. 
It is the duty of every thinking 
person to try to understand this people 
that war has so brutally thrust into 
world prominence, to study the records 
of their philosophy and an art of the 
highest kind which is still existent 
today. He will gain far more than 
just an historical background. He will 
discover the character and manner of 
life of present day Koreans living 
under the symbolic flag, in which the 
yang and the yin, fire and water, sun 
and night, life and death are myster- 
iously intertwined.
