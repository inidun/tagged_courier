Francois Jacob 
® In one of your books, The Logic of Life (1970), you 
show that the history of science and the history of mankind 
coincide, and that the results of biological research influence 
our changing image of the world, How do things stand 
today when mastery of the mechanisms of life, and espe- 
cially of the keys of human heredity, is causing both bope 
and anxiety? 
— In that book I was trying to understand the evolution 
of our ideas about life, about the way in which living beings 
are produced. Our understanding of the processes of life has 
grown constantly. Until the sixteenth century each birth 
was seen as a creation. Each new being was shaped by divine 
intervention. At the origin of each life was an act by the 
Creator. It was not until the late seventeenth and the early 
eighteenth century that the idea of reproduction replaced 
that of creation. 
Until the eighteenth century, the study of living beings 
was limited to their external appearance. Investigation went 
no further than the visible structure. Natural history classi- 
fied and compared forms in this way and defined genera or 
species. Around the end of that century, there came a rad- 
ical change in the way of analysing living beings, as the use

of the term “biology” suggests. It was discovered that there 
was an “organization” within the bodies of man and animals. 
Then, in the middle of the nineteenth century, it was realized 
that the body consists of elementary units called cells. At 
the end of the century investigation went even deeper and 
chromosomes were discovered. Then, at the beginning of 
this century, came the discovery of the genes, which, in the 
nucleus of the cell, govern characteristics. Finally, in the 
middle of this century, molecular biology penetrated even 
more deeply into the secrets of life when it discovered the 
chemical and molecular structure of the gene: DNA or 
deoxyribonucleic acid. 
Molecular biology seeks to explain the astonishing 
properties of living creatures in terms of the structure and 
the interactions of the molecules which comprise the var- 
ious cells of the organism. In particular, this new biology 
has tried successfully to solve the age-old mystery of heredity. 
m What is the status of the notion of teleology, which has 
haunted all modern thinking on reproduction? You wrote 
in The Logic of Life that “For a long time, the biologist 
treated teleology as he would a woman be could not do 
without, but did not care to be seen with in public. The 
concept of programme has made an honest woman of 
teleology”. 
— The problem is couched in these terms: as a general rule 
nature does not follow a plan. But in the case of living beings, 
there clearly are phenomena which take place according to 
We are programmed, 
but programmed 
to learn.

a plan in order to attain a goal. Reproduction is one example. 
Its result is known in advance. We know that only a duck 
can result from the coupling of two ducks. For along period 
people wanted to explain this finality in terms of a “life 
force” which was not governed by the laws of physics and 
chemistry. Molecular biology has shown that the chromo- 
somes of the fertilized egg, half received from the father and 
half from the mother, contain in coded form all the instruc- 
tions required for the making of 2 new organism. They con- 
tain what has been called a genetic programme. This is how 
we can explain the apparent finality which manifests itself 
in the development of an embryo. 
~ 
An individual is thus the result of a programme inscribed 
in the genes received from its two parents. However, tt is 
different from them. Why? Evolution has found a clever 
way of ensuring that all organisms of the same species are 
different from each other. Each time the blend is different, 
with half of the programme coming from the mother and 
half from the father. Thus the genetic equipment of each 
being contains the indelible traces of its individuality, of its 
differences from all its past, present and future congeners, 
except for identical twins. 
These differences permit evolution to encourage some 
rather than others. Each programme is not entirely rigid. 
It defines structures which are potentialities, probabilities, 
tendencies. Genes only determine the constitution of the 
individual. 
We are all different, and the way in which living beings 
reproduce is arranged so that we shall be so. This is why 
the day came when man needed to formulate the concept 
of equality. If we were al identical, like a population of bac- 
teria, the idea of equality would be quite unnecessary. 
m Does the genetic programme also have a bearing on 
psychological characteristics? What is current thinking on 
the old controversy about nature and culture, innate and 
acquired characteristics? 
— I think it is absurd to postulate a complete antithesis 
between the innate and the acquired. Modern biologists see 
hereditary structures and learning as mingled and continu- 
ally interacting. If you blindfold a cat at birth and prevent 
it from seeing, when the blindfold is removed two weeks 
later the cat has become blind. But if you put the blindfold 
on when the cat is two or three months old, the cat can 
sce normally when you remove it. 
hit 
Stages in the development of a mouse. 
From left to right: 
the fertilized egg divides; 
the two cells divide into four; 
the fully-formed embryo. 
The whole system probably functions in this way. 
Learning stabilizes certain circuits and the others degenerate. 
It chooses from among pre-existing possibilities. The making 
of an individual, physically, intellectually, morally and men- 
tally, corresponds to a permanent interaction between the 
innate and the acquired. 
m Would it be correct to say that in every child who is 
deprived of opportunities for fulfilment, we kill a Mozart? 
— Let’s not exaggerate. Each individual harbours possibili- 
ties of excelling in a certain field. It may be music, or high 
jumping, or carpentry. We just have to find out which one. 
That’s the most difficult thing. I think that education does

### 87731: Interview: François Jacob

not try hard enough to exploit the potential of each child. 
But that doesn’t mean that in each child the genius of a 
Mozart is only waiting for an opportunity to express itself... 
Wm You have also written that “Each being contains in 
its chromosomes all its own future, the stages of its develop- 
ment”. So what margin of freedom do we have? 
—A considerable margin. We exploit to a greater or lesser 
degree the possibilities inscribed in our chromosomes. And 
each culture orientates these possibilities in its own way. 
You learn to speak Bantu or Eskimo, depending on whether 
you are born among the Bantu or the Eskimos. That is one 
system of selection. The genetic programme fixes in the 
individual a framework into which the culture introduces 
a certain hierarchy of values, certain forms of incentive or 
motivation. We are programmed, but programmed to learn... 
m To imagine? 
— Yes. We are rather special animals who never stop learning 
and searching. Horses gallop, birds fly, fleas jump. In our 
case, we function with our imagination. In this context I 
should fike to discuss a widely-held idea about the supposed 
difference between scientific and artistic activities. It is often 
said that the imagination, the creative capacity attributed 
to the artist, whether he is making a picture, a symphony 
or a novel, 1s absent from scientific work. The scientist is 
supposed to lift the veil which hides a pre-established truth. 
It’s not as simple as that. In scientific work as in the work 
of the artist, the element of imagination is, at least at the 
outset, very similar. If you look at the process from the 
beginning, the elucidation of the structure of the atom or 
of DNA is as much a creation as a discovery. 
 
W There is room for astonishment, for the unexpected. 
— The whole system is so arranged that we don’t know what 
will happen tomorrow. And yet we can only live in rela- 
tion to the future. This accounts for the astonishing interest 
in astrology! We spend our time looking ahead, trying to 
make sense of things. Man finds it hard to accept that 
the world is what 1t is and not otherwise. Why do bodies 
fall, not rise? Why do we age? Why are there leaves on the 
trees? That's the way 1t 1s! We want everything to have a 
meaning, 
Take the case of evolution: we find it hard to accept 
that it 1s purely a matter of tinkering. However different 
they may appear, organisms all consist of the same elements, 
which are simply redistributed and rearranged differently 
in different organisms. What distinguishes a lion from a but- 
terfly, a fly from a hen or a worm from a whale, is simply 
the different organization, the different arrangement of the 
same materials, the same cells, the same molecules. It’s 
amazing but that’s the way 1t is. 
What's more, there are lots of cases where this process

has been unsuccessful in nature, in the human body. Do you 
know how many spontaneous miscarriages take place in 
nature? Fifty per cent. The mechanism that governs the 
entire system of life has a 50 per cent failure rate. And yet 
the system works. Amazing isn’t 1t? 
mW Shall we not want to influence this molecular tinkering 
ourselves, if it is technically possible? There is a frightening 
possibility of genetic manipulation... 
— The great success of molecular biology has been to under- 
stand the functioning of the genetic mechanisms of heredity. 
After finding out how genes function and reproduce them. 
selves, we have acquired the capacity to affect the genes 
themselves through genetic engineering, It is, for example, 
possible to isolate a gene, splice it to others, and even 
insert 1t into another organism. Genetic engineering 1s 
simply the imitation of nature’s tinkering in laboratory 
conditions. 
This power, it is true, is causing anxiety. Modern biology 
appears so formidable because it is concerned with what is at 
the very heart, not only of every living system, but of every 
social system, at the heart of the intellectual and emotional 
structuring of every living being: reproduction and heredity, 
fields which long remained sacrosanct. 
Here we must make a distinction of crucial importance. 
On the one hand between the input of new knowledge— 
research which is by definition unpredictable, and whose 
unpredictability and alarming aspects must be accepted— 
and on the other its potential applications. The day man 
was able to use iron, he could make a knife and use it just 
as easily to peel an apple as to murder one of his fellows. 
The application of scientific knowledge must be under- 
taken by decision of society as a whole. A society must be 
able to decide whether to encourage or to prevent a given 
application of a scientific discovery, 
But society should not restrict, still less prevent, the quest 
for knowledge in the life sciences. This quest must be car- 
ried out in total freedom, since it makes a great contribu- 
tion to our knowledge of ourselves and to the struggle to 
improve the human condition. At the same time, the appli- 
cations of this knowledge must kept under constant surveil- 
lance. We must be vigilant. 
Genetic engineering has become the indispensable tool 
for all research on living beings. It is necessary for studying 
Diagrams showing how a virus reproduces.

material from the virus; reproduction of the virus 
within the cell; appearance of the complete virus

The French biologist Frangois Jacob who (with André Lwoff and Jacques Monod) was awarded the Nobel Prize 
for Physiology or Medicine in 1965, is one of the great figures of contemporary science. He originally intended 
to become a surgeon, and was a medical student when he joined the Free French Forces in 1940. After the war 
he finished his medical studies but, unable to practise surgery because of wounds contracted during the Normandy 
landings in 1944, he turned to biology. In 1950 he joined the Pasteur Institute (Paris) as a research assistant and 
ten years later became head of the department of cellular genetics. He has also been president of the Institute’s 
board of governors. In 1964 he was appointed professor of cellular genetics at the College de France. His work 
has been principally concerned with the genetic mechanisms of bacteria and bacterial viruses, the transmission 
of genetic information and regulatory activities in bacteria. His publications translated into English include The 
Logic of Life and The Possible and the Actual (new edition, Penguin, London, 1989) and his autobiography, The 
State Within (Unwin Hyman, London, 1988).

the development of the embryo, hereditary diseases, the 
brain, and even evolution. It provides medicine with 
weapons of matchless power of diagnosis, prevention and 
treatment. 
Genetic engineering, for example, makes it possible to 
understand the mechanisms at the origin of cancers. Human 
body cells form a society and obey precise regulations. In 
the case of cancer, some cells start to multiply anarchically 
because they have become deaf to the signals governing their 
multiplication. But it is only in the last few years, as a result 
of genetic engineering, that we have learned how to locate, 
in different types of cancer, the mutant genes which allow 
the cell not to heed these signals. For the first time, we thus 
have the possibility of access to the very mechanism of the 
illness. Only genetic engineering will enable us to analyse 
the AIDS virus and thus to stop it. 
m What can genetic engineering do in the case of hereds- 
tary diseases? 
— We must make a distinction between the cells in a person’s 
body, or somatic cells, on the one hand, and the reproductive 
cells on the other. It is possible to treat a sick person’s 
somatic cells through genetic engineering. In the case of a 
hereditary blood disease, for example, it is possible to modify 
the genetic constitution of sick cells by replacing a damaged 
gene with a healthy gene, then reinjecting into the patient 
his own cells thus treated. This treatment follows the same 
principle as that of artificial limbs, grafts, or organ trans- 
plants. Only the somatic cells of the patient are targeted; 
the reproductive cells are not touched. There is no reason 
why this kind of treatment should not be used when we 
know how to do it properly. 
But I believe that for a long time to come we should 
totally forbid any kind of experiment on the injection of 
genes into all the cells, including the reproductive cells of 
a person—who would then transmit them to his or her off- 
spring. To touch the reproductive cells is to touch the human 
genome, the genetic heritage of humanity. Biologists and 
doctors are unanimous that this should be absolutely 
forbidden. 
m What exactly is the genome? 
— It is the set of genes that constitutes the genetic material 
of a given individual or species. These genes are carried by 
chromosomes whose principal constituent is DNA, a very 
long molecule formed by the sequence of four chemical 
radicals. In man, the forty-six chromosomes contain some 
3,000 million of these radicals and correspond roughly to 
the 100,000 genes which are necessary for a human being 
to take shape and live. 
It was long thought that the more complex an organism 
ts, the more DNA it would contain. But it has been found 
that the salamander and the lily have about ten times more 
DNA than a person. Even leaving anthropomorphism aside, 
a human being seems more complicated to make than a 
lily or a salamander. It would seem that the genome of 
rather complex organisms contains only a small fraction 
of DNA, from 5 to 10 per cent, corresponding to real 
genes. We don’t really know what the rest is for. It 
contains many repeated sequences which are probably 
useless. Some believe it is a kind of waste, a residue of 
various genetic mishaps... 
The human genome is being studied more and more sys- 
tematically. Efforts are being made to map it with preci- 
sion. One day we shall be able to fully decipher the 
hereditary information contained in human chromosomes. 
This will be an extraordinary tool, not only for medicine. 
We shall have to take great care if we are to make good use 
of it. In the name of freedom. =

¢ MAGINATION 1s more important than 
knowledge,” said Albert Einstein, and his 
remark seems more relevant than ever 
today. The world is changing so rapidly that 
our complacency and established ways of think- 
ing are continually being challenged. The more 
the technocrat’s certainties and the planner’s 
pride are confounded by hard facts, the more 
the individual capacity for inventiveness is at 
a premium. “All is flux,” said Heraclitus over 
2,000 years ago. Have we forgotten that change 
is inherent in the human condition? We are 
living at a time when the pace of historical 
change is such that there is an unparalleled need 
for new thinking, 
And what do we see? At the very moment 
when we ought to be guided and impelled by 
the creative spirit, people are asserting that 
utopia is dead. What justification is there, in 
fact, for rejecting the idea of utopia as a beacon 
of inspiration and a guide to action? Many 
researchers today see a propensity to look 
beyond existing reality as the hallmark of the 
utopian impulse, of the intense desire for 
change that re-emerges whenever pragmatism 
sinks into arid, sterile routine. Most of them 
believe that any great human adventure, 
* whether in science, religion or politics, is an 
offshoot of some form of utopian thought. 
Perhaps utopia can sketch a profile of the 
future. 
  


### 87732: Attempting the impossible

ATTEMPTING THE IMPOSSIBLE 
BY FEDERICO MAYOR 
But what kind of utopia? And on what terms? 
Utopia is by definition transcendent, a child 
of excess which nevertheless remains within the 
bounds of reason. Such “reasonable immodet- 
ation” can make an impact on the real world 
by raising its aspirations, without for a moment 
losing sight of respect for mankind. Did not 
this kind of ambition and utopianism inspire 
Martin Luther King, Mahatma Gandhi, and 
Nelson Mandela? Such “open” utopias are quite 
different from those which confine the com- 
munity within a logic that denies individual 
expression and tends to crush it. 
This sense of vision in utopianism should be 
regarded as a liberating, dynamic force for 
immediate, universal action, an encouragement 
to bold thinking, In the words of Bernard 
Lown, president of International Physicians for 
the Prevention of Nuclear War, which was 
awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1985, “Only 
those who can see the invisible can do the 
impossible”. To increase in this way the 
power of the imagination and strengthen the 
human desire to go ever further, is to equip 
mankind to face reality and respond to the 
unexpected. 
Can utopia be a guarantee of freedom? No 
final answer has yet been given to this 
question. But it is a question that is worth 
asking,

the Old World could perhaps be brought to fru- 
ition in the New. In fact there were several 
attempts to put his ideas into practice in sixteenth- 
century Latin America, from the communes of 
farmers and craftsmen established at Michoacin 
in Mexico by Bishop Vasco de Quiroga to the 
ideal world of Verapaz—literally, “True Peace” — 
that Bartolomé de las Casas sought to create at 
Chiapas. 
In the succeeding centuries, the missions and 
Indian settlements—the so-called “Reductions” — 
set up by the Jesuits over a vast area of Brazil, 
Argentina and Paraguay drew the inspiration for 
their theocratic regimes from both Campanella 
and Plato. In the nineteenth century, various 
_attempts to set up utopian socialist communities 
were made in England, France, the United States 
and Latin America. 
Criticizing the present 
to change the future 
Every project for an ideal society is an attempt 
to invent the future. That is what distinguishes 
utopianism from ideology. As Karl Mannheim, 
the author of Ideology and Utopia (1929), put it, 
utopias bear a message of hope in the sense that 
they signify that change is possible. Whilst 
ideology is a vehicle for the world view of people 
in power, utopias are by their very nature sub- 
versive; they oppose existing authority and 
challenge the view of reality that it imposes. 
Some authors consider poor living condi-

tions, and the protests they inspire, to be the uto- 
plans’ greatest ally. For EM. Cioran, author of 
Utopia and History (1960) and an acerbic critic 
of modern values and of Western civilization, 
“The wild thoughts of the indigent set things 
moving....; a crowd of hotheads want another 
world, and they want it now. These are the 
people that inspire utopias, and it is for them that 
they are written.” Utopian thinking turns to its 
own purposes the ancient myth of the Land of 
Plenty, and assimilates all the Lands of Cockayne 
in which the hungry peasants of the Middle Ages 
dreamed of filling their bellies without effort. 
Utopianism has in fact often provided an 
inspiration for social progress. Many recent 
improvements in living conditions were long con- 
sidered utopian fantasies. Whether with regard 
to working hours, sexual equality, welfare poli- 
cies, leisure, alternative energy sources, environ- 
mental protection or town planning, More, 
Campanella, Bacon and others can now be seen 
as prophets whose dreams have in some cases 
become reality. 
By no means -all of the realized visions, 
however, have been constructive. In the course 
of the present century some have come to fruition 
in ways that have inspired anxiety and even terror. 
Numerous works have described the 
increasing mechanization of modern life, the 
growth of bureaucracy, the depersonalization of 
the individual and the increasingly intrusive 
powers of the state, and have denounced their 
alienating effects and the assaults on liberty they 
represent. Such books normally exaggerate their

### 87733: Do we need utopia?

The Russian thinker Nicholas Berdyaev 
(1874-1948) presented the idea in a different way. 
For him, the twentieth century has proved 
utopias to be more attainable than anyone had 
imagined. He saw the totalitarian results in the 
many would-be ideal societies around him. That 
insight led him to a bitter question: How can we 
be spared utopia? 
The fascination of the impossible 
The odd thing is that those views of the future 
that have historically had the greatest influence 
and that people have most often tried to turn into 
reality have not, as one might have expected, been 
the most realistic, and hence realisable, ones. Take 
the case of the author of A New World of Love, 
Charles Fourier, whose radically original ideas 
have had great significance for two divergent 
groups of people, for totally different reasons. 
On the one hand, disciples who took his message 
at face value set up communes faithful to his ideas 
in Argentina, the United States, Brazil and 
Mexico. On the other, the surrealists who were 
fascinated by the visionary and subversive aspects 
of Fourierism—precisely because they considered 
them to be unrealisable. 
Whether or not it is confronted by the test 
of reality or has the fascination of the impossible, 
the vision of utopia seems to be one of the motors 
of human history. Ultimately it is the measure 
of the hope that drives humankind forward. 
Although Cioran is generally hostile to social 
idealism, even he recognizes that utopias are 
part of the quest for human happiness. However, 
he attacks the very concept of happiness, which 
he holds responsible for many of the great 
tragedies of history. Products of history, most 
utopias in his view degenerate into tyranny and 
servitude. 
Other writers would be less willing to dismiss 
the quest for a perfect society as merely a cata- 
logue of forlorn hopes. For the Italian essayist 
Ignazio Silone, 2 world without a utopian dimen- 
ston would be claustrophobic and suffocating, 
and would end in a stagnation worse than mad. 
ness. The American theologian Paul Tillich was 
even more emphatic: “Without utopias to open 15

### 87733: Do we need utopia?

up possibilities, the present is sterile and stag- 
nant.... Without utopias, a culture... rapidly falls 
back into the past. The present is only fully alive 
in the tensions between the past and the future.” 
On the other hand, a modern social theorist, 
Ernst Bloch, draws attention to the risks of “auto- 
matic optimism” and a “blind and limited faith 
in the future”. He prefers realistic pessimism to 
false optimism. In his view, social utopias need 
not lead to alienation. They can be realistic and 
liberating, just so long as they represent a clearly- 
held position free of all adventurism. 
Ideal and 
nightmare worlds 
The alternative societies that utopian literature 
has sketched out are much more varied than 
might be suggested by the everyday use of the 
word, which is now loosely taken to describe 
anything from anarchy to tyranny or liberty to 
dictatorship, and can be applied to either ideal 
or nightmare worlds. Basically, though, they can 
be divided into two categories. On the one hand 
are those that stress order, with Campanella as 
their original inspiration; on the other are those 
inspired by liberty, which trace their descent to 
the work of Thomas More. 
The first kind depicts ideal states; their 
imagined worlds are institutional and collective, 
not to say totalitarian. The second—drawing on 
popular and revolutionary traditions—describes 
the best imaginable ways of being. Fear of seeing 
the totalitarian utopias turn into reality can easily 
blind us to the liberating potential of the other 
variety. 
“Do what you will” was the motto of the 
Abbey of Thelema, the paradise of pleasure 
Rabelais depicted in Gargantua and Pantagruel. 
It could serve as a rallying-cry for all the liber- 
tarian utopias, from the Renaissance through the 
socialist model societies of the nineteenth century 
to the alternative communities of the present day, 
giving them their “light of dream and passion”, 
in the phrase of William Morris, author of News 
from Nowhere (1890). This sense of wonder shines 
like a flame in every work in which the aspira- 
tion towards liberty struggles to overcome all the 
rational obstacles that confront it. 
For libertarian utopians, the task is to restore 
humanity to the fullness of its nature. In 
Morelly’s Basiliade of 1753, everything that stands 
in the way of individual liberty is abolished: 
property, politics, marriage, privilege and law all 
go, and humanity is finally free to live in har- 
mony with nature. A similar quest for total liber- 
ation reappears today in the work of the 
American fantasy writer Ursula Le Guin, partic- 
ularly in her novel The Dispossessed (1974). The 
utopia it depicts arouses both hope and terror, 
neatly encapsulating the current uncertainty the 
concept provokes. 
Maybe it is time to overcome our ambiva- 
lence, and to look beyond the real-life experience 
of social engineering that has thrown the whole 
idea of ideal worlds into disrepute. In so doing, 
it might be possible to recapture the liberating 
vitality and dynamism of the original utopian 
16 dream. 


### 87734: The Fiasco of paradise

  
THE FIASCO OF PARADISE 
BY GILLES LAPOUGE 
Sone people think that when God drove Adam 
and Eve out of the Garden of Eden He was 
warning utopians that the ideal society is not 
something for this world but for the next. 
Certainly the fiasco of Paradise, had human 
beings only learnt a lesson from it, could have 
saved us from many disappointments. We should 
never have had to put up with those radiant

societies that lapse inevitably into despotism, 
mania, torture and genocide, or with those com- 
munities which promise to deliver the world 
from evil and actually do the opposite. 
The Bible’s advice unfortunately fell on deaf 
ears. For as long as people have been capable of 
thought, utopians have peered into their crystal 
balls, scribbled down grandiose schemes, and 
sketched out never-never lands. 
They told themselves that the Garden of 
Eden was pleasant, and full of good intentions, 
but a bit sloppy, very muddled, and perhaps (of 
all things) even anarchic. So they produced more 
modern, more cruel, and better-organized models 
of Paradise. Utopians are suspicious of every- 
body. They are disciplinarians who like their 
cities to be correctly laid out, prefer calculation 
to love, evict tramps and dreamers, execute 
deviants, and do away with the family, individual 
destiny and Old Father Time. 
So they produce assembly-line people, aseptic 
and uniform. They put their charming societies 
into straitjackets and clap freedom in irons. They 
do away with controversy and destroy the 
pathogens of evil. Too bad if people die, or live 
in slavery. Utopian skies, which should be blue, 
are actually black. 
Hippodamus and Plato: 
the demon of geometry 
Five centuries before Christ, Hippodamus of 
Miletus lived in Ionia, a blessed land on the 
Aegean coast of Asia Minor which brought the 
Greek genius to its apogee. There, between sea 
and sky, an elegant civilization blossomed, 
carefree and gay. Unfortunately from the other 
side of the Taurus Mountains the armies of 
Darius, King of Persia, cast covetous eyes on the 
smiling coast. The Ionians led a revolt, and set

fire to Sardis. Darius flew into a rage and 
unleashed his troops on Ionia; and in 494 BC the 
town of Miletus, between Halicarnassus and 
Ephesus, was stormed and sacked. 
Hippodamus the architect was very pleased. 
Here was a chance in a million to build a city 
from scratch, rather as Oscar Niemeyer in the 
twentieth century would build Brasilia on a site 
untrammelled with any historical associations. 
“Hippodamus,” says Aristotle in his Politics, 
“invented the geometric grid plan for towns. He 
designed a city of 10,000 inhabitants sub-divided 
into three categories, craftsmen, farmers and 
militiamen.” 
Let us remember the grid plan, a design that 
marks Hippodamus out as the earliest known 
utopian. The Milesian architect wished to con- 
fine- nature within straight lines and virtually 
abolish it, forging a mould that would produce 
a clean, tidy, egalitarian, public-spirited, rational 
society. 
Plato went further than Hippodamus. In the 
Laws he describes a blissfully happy society, and 
in the Republic he explains how it works. 
The city centre is dominated by an acropolis, 
from which twelve spokes radiate so as to divide 
the city into twelve sections. The streets are 
straight, the squares circular, and all the houses 
alike. This is a far cry from Athens, the real 
Athens, which is a network of delightful, dirty, 
winding streets. The city in the Laws, like Hip- 
podamus’s, is geometrical: it is a beehive, the cells 
of which are occupied by people. There are few 
amusements—music and dancing—and all inno- 
vations are prohibited. Poets—dirty, unpredic- 
table dreamers—are banished. People eat in 
canteens. Statistics are impeccably kept: in the 
18 city of the Laws there are no individuals, only

American artist John Martin.

City of God by Saint 
Augustine (354-430). 
  
 
citizens. Idlers, dreamers, tramps and bachelors 
are outlawed. 
This mathematical city works like a com- 
puter, without mistakes or breakdowns. The idea 
1s to cram the soul into the pattern of the city 
and the city into the pattern of the cosmos (“the 
well-organized”). Plato wants to protect society 
from the disastrous whims of “‘sublunar nature” 
and the bloody horrors of history. 
Plato’s society was divided into three layers: 
at the top were the philosophers, who kept the 
state together and took the decisions. (Being 
immune from unexpected circumstances and the 
caprices of history, the ideal city should have no 
need of a strong government. In the more 
extreme utopias that came later, government 
withers away: the city alters itself, unfailingly 
reproducing the same movements. The cosmos 
needs no rudder; it spins of its own accord, and 
never goes off the rails.) 
Plato, however, kept a government. The 
philosophers who constituted it were assisted by 
guardians or watchdogs, who needed to be both 
“irascible and also philosophical”. They in turn 
were in charge of the third category, viz. the

workers and peasants. The guardians were fierce 
because the workers were uneducated people 
with “covetous souls” who only did stupid 
things. These mindless people even allowed them- 
selves the luxury of having instincts and feelings, 
loving their neighbours’ wives, adoring their chil- 
dren and grieving when their mothers died—in 
short, of harbouring a multitude of germs which 
Plato, the skilled physician, set out to kill. Plato 
was an obsessional disinfecter: he wanted an open 
society of passionless citizens devoid of memory 
and imagination—a dreary collection of “people 
without attributes”. 
The abolition of the family 
The philosophers who govern the city in Plato’s 
Laws are indefatigable. They are on the lookout 
for trouble night and day. They strike at the first 
hint that any feeling, desire or softness is creeping 
into the crystal city. Everything “organic” is to 
be organized out of existence. 
Hence the family is one of their favourite 
targets. For utopians the family spells disaster, 
trauma and calamity, for it contains within itself 
the seeds of everything primitive, dark, instinc- 
tive and “organic”. The state could of course

negotiate with the family, or put it in a strait- 
jacket. Many despotic states did this later on but 
they all came to grief on the rock of the family. 
More shrewdly, Plato opted for a radical solution: 
realizing that the family would always be an 
obstacle to a dictatorial state, he abolished it. 
Children are taken from the bosoms of their 
families and returned to the state. No more 
mothers, fathers, sisters or cousins—and good rid- 
dance! The family expands to the size of the city, 
and is thus dissolved. 
Destroying the family in this way is both log- 
ical and insane. Logical, because a mathematical 
society cannot tolerate the untidiness of the 
family, its warmth and intimacy, its demands, and 
its murky depths. Insane because the family is 
intractable. It resists and will always resist attacks 
on it from the state. 
It may seem odd that mammals are not good 
at setting up rational societies. Even beavers are 
anarchists, rogues and eccentrics by comparison 
with ants or bees. Mammals are politically inept 
because the family—a husband’s link with his 
wife, a mother’s with her children—stands up to 
all acts of violence by the state. 
This is where social insects excel. In beehives 
and anthills the young are taken over by the state, 19

so there can be no bond of affection or sentiment 
between parents and their offspring. Heedless of 
the passage of time, immobile and submissive, 
contemptuous of individual liberties, blindly 
obeying pre-programmed instructions, an anthill 
fulfils the irrational dream of absolute reason. The 
mistake made by Plato and all the utopians who 
followed in his footsteps was to suppose that man 
is a political animal. He is not, but ants are. Plato 
was a philosopher for bees and termites. 
The diktat of the clock 
Plato’s designs were never implemented. The 
philosopher’s advice was rejected by Dionysius 
the Elder, the tyrant of Syracuse—himself no sen- 
timentalist. Nevertheless the philosophical exer- 
cise initiated by Plato was to beget many 
offspring, including Thomas More, Etienne Cabet 
and Robert Owen. 
Even in Antiquity other thinkers constructed 
ideal cities. The Stoic Iambulus has left us a 
description of seven “happy isles”, but they are 
not attractive. Anyone stranded on one of these 
islands would have wanted only to get away. The 
islanders were divided into groups of 400. Procre- 
ation and education were state-controlled, with 
the aim of making all the children physically 
equal. The citizens were all alike and could not 
be told apart. Intellectual and mental equality was 
engineered by means of monotonous working 
shifts continually repeated. 
Historians of utopia tend to neglect the 
Middle Ages, which is not right, for that obscure 
period produced two very important utopian fea- 
tures, convents and clocks. 
Convents, abbeys and monasteries were oases 
of peace and quiet in a stormy world, harmonious 
settled communities that would have delighted 
Plato. There were no families, nor even 
individuals. Monks and nuns did not even use 
their own names. The rule of St. Benedict was 
so strict and all-embracing that abbots and 
mothers superior had nothing to supervise but 
stillness and the meticulous, contented repetition 
of the same rituals. This was a glowing success— 
one of the few successes of utopia. But it becomes 
less impressive when one realizes that the splen- 
dours of monastic architecture belong to eternity 
rather than history. 
Clocks came into being, by chance, in a con- 
vent, that is in a utopian environment. The 
mechanism of this magnificent invention— 
unchanging, inhuman and implacable, incapable 
of error, free from whims or inconsistencies, and 
immune from the constraints of history, is 
reminiscent of a perfect society. It is because they 
are timeless that clocks can show the time. 
Plato’s utopia was based on a model, the 
cosmos, and drew its inspiration secretly from 
another model, the anthill. Post-Renaissance uto- 
pians in their dozens used another model to feed 
20 their rational hallucinations: the watch. Rn

### 87735: A Platonic parable

A PLATONIC PARABLE 
BY ALAIN FRONTIER 
A. the beginning of Plato’s Republic, 
Thrasymachus, one of Socrates’ questioners, flies 
into a towering rage. Socrates, he says, is making 
fools of them all as usual. He is pretending to be 
a simpleton, saying nothing clear, letting others 
do the talking for him, taking pleasure in seeing 
them get mixed up in their own contradictions. 
The irony of Socrates, and through him the 
irony of Plato whose mouthpiece he is, is not 
gratuitous. He wants to destabilize certainties 
before pursuing the only inquiry that matters: 
what is justice? Thrasymachus’s answer is clear. 
It is the established sovereign power that decides 
what is justice. Thrasymachus decides to stick to 
the reality of things. What interests Socrates is 
not the real but the true. And to explore the true 
he proposes the path of utopia. 
Let us observe, says Socrates, through the 
word, the logos—he insists on this verbal 
dimension—a city that is in the process of being 
constituted. Why a city? Because a city is bigger

than an individual and thus easier to observe. By 
seeing how men will live in it, we shall perhaps 
have occasion to see justice and injustice consti 
tute themselves there at the same time. 
This city does not exist, it is a fiction. But 
it is not entirely a lie since it is subjected to the 
moral requirement that is love of truth. By 
pushing it to its conclusion is there not a chance 
of coming close to a reply? 
Let’s act as if it were a myth, says Socrates, 
even though we know that it isn’t one. There’s 
no pretence in this fiction. Nor any nostalgia: the 
verbs are not in the past tense. With its future 
indicative, utopia offers itself as a pure project, 
we don’t even need to dream about its execution. 
It is not the exposition of an ideological 
programme! Utopia does not present already 
acquired ideas of which one can be sure. “I don’t 
know,” Socrates says. “I don’t know yet. We 
must continue. We must go where the logos takes 
us as the wind blows a boat.” Utopia is like a 
slow voyage which takes its time. 
And yet what difficulties, what risks! 
announces Socrates to those of his listeners who 
wish to accompany him on this fictitious adven- 
ture. Utopia will meet with incredulity, it will be 
taken for the ramblings of a dreamer. Even worse. 
What I fear, says Socrates, is not so much making 
people laugh as travestying the truth. I would 
move forward more boldly if I were sure of 
knowing. But I doubt and I seek. Perhaps it is 
necessary, he adds, to bring a certain proportion 
to our utopia, to impose certain limits on it. 
VTRITOVE 
No, replies Glaucon, another participant in the 
discussion, we must go on, even if it takes the 
whole of life. 
Utopia. Has anyone ever noticed the strange 
way In which Thomas More during the Renais- 
sance created his neologism from the Greek? At 
first sight the word seems simple. Derived from 
the Greek word topos meaning “place” and the 
negative ox, “utopia” designates that which is 
found in “no place”. But logically More should 
have used the privative form # which should be 
used in this situation (as in apolitical, etc.). Why 
did he not do so? Why did he not want to use 
the word “atopia”? 
I think there are two reasons. First of all, the 
word atopia already existed in Greek to designate 
something extraordinary, new, strange, extrava- 
gant or absurd. This is not a definition of the 
utopia described by More (and after him Rabelais 
and others). Then, by beginning the word with 
a negative adverb (“not”), More deliberately 
emphasized that the place he describes does not 
exist anywhere, has never existed and will never 
exist. That it should not exist. Woe betide anyone 
who tried to apply to the real world what is only 
a figment of thought, a method of understanding 
and approaching the truth. 
If Plato’s city existed, it would be the worst 
of all cities. Is this a reason for burning his 
Republic? Banish the philosopher from our city? 
The world’s problems come not from utopias but 
from those who were foolish enough to confuse 
them with programmes of political action. ®

AKHET-ATON, CITY OF THE SUN 
BY AYYAM WASSEF 
Wee Plato sought to visualize the ideal state, 
the illusory hope of creating a republic founded 
on reason led him prudently to propose banishing 
poets. Utopia, it would seem, cannot tolerate in 
its ideal world the subversive force of the 
imagination—which is, ironically, the very ele- 
ment that gives it birth. Things change, however, 
when the utopian dreamer has the power to put 
his visions into effect through the fact that he is 
king—a real king, who as it happened in this case 
was also a poet. 
Akhet-aton (literally, “city of the horizon”) 
was a real-life utopia that lasted only as long as 
the heretical views of its creator, the Pharaoh 
Akhenaton. What is left of its twelve-year exis- 
tence can be found in Middle Egypt, on the banks 
of the Nile at Tell el-Amarna. There are some 
palaces, a workers’ residential quarter, a sculptors’ 
workshop, several temples. These vestiges bear 
witness less to the town’s existence than to the 
fact of its demolition. They are stone fragments 
of an interrupted poem, fixed forever in its 
moment of inception. 
Until 1842 even the name of the city was for- 
gotten, let alone its history. People had at best 
an inkling that somewhere midway between 
Egypt's ancient capital of Memphis and Thebes, 
the town that supplanted it, a city of gold- 
encrusted temples lay hidden, concealed both by 
the sands of the desert and by the still more cor- 
rosive dust of neglect. 
It was not until 1912 that German Egyptol- 
ogists discovered the painted bust of Nefertiti, 
now in the Berlin Museum, that was to become 
one of the most precious of Egyptian artworks 
and was by its luminous beauty to cast light on 
the strangest and least-known episode of the 
country’s Pharaonic history. It immediately 
raised the question of who its subject might have 
been, for her name had been carefully removed 
from most of the records. It took fifty years’ 
research to establish that the splendid, high- 
crowned queen had been the wife of Akhenaton, 
whose name had also been proscribed, featuring 
in none of the official lists of Egypt’s rulers. In 
effect, the historians of ancient Egypt had deliber- 
ately expunged thirty years of their own history. 
The extent of the conspiracy suggests just 
how significant the Amarna episode was for 
ancient Egyptians. The radical programme that 
Akhenaton introduced, inspired as much by 
poetry as by politics, was so profoundly 
unsettling that even now it appears an aberration 
fitting uneasily into any straightforward chrono- 
logical account of Egyptian history, belonging 
instead, it would seem, in some hidden corner of 
the memory, on the threshold of a dream. 
 
At this distance, Akhenaton’s own person- 
ality is difficult to reconstruct. Some people see 
him as a tragic prefiguration of Christ, a precursor 
of monotheism, Moses before the letter. For 
others he is the heretical Pharaoh, the great stain 
on the history of his nation—and by extension 
on its geography, which through his creative 
endeavours he permanently marked with a small, 
enduring, sun-coloured spot. 
For in an arid and burning place where the 
sun might have come up on the very first day of 
creation, Akhenaton decided to build a city that 
was to be the centre and focal point of his own 
new religion. In defiance of the powerful priest- 
hood, he banned the cult of Amon, king of the 
gods, and established in its place the worship of 
Aton, the sun. The break came abruptly at the 
beginning of his reign, around the year 1362 BC. 
The king changed his royal title from Amenophis 
IV—the name meant “Amon 1s satisfied” —to 
Akhenaton, “he whom Aton loves”, and left the 
royal city of Thebes to start work on the new 
capital. A hundred thousand technicians, engineers 
and workers were employed to build his 
metropolis, which was planned to hold an even 
larger number of inhabitants. Akhet-aton was to 
be a city of the sun, of art and love and joy. It 
was almost certainly the first urban centre to have 
been designed from scratch. 
Ingenious means were found to bring the 
finest and most suitable materials to the site. To 
lighten the architecture, and so increase the con- 
trast with the massive stone monuments of earlier 
reigns, wooden beams were used to support walls 
of mud-brick. A royal avenue bordered by the 
most expensive houses ran through the middle 
of the city. The houses of less privileged citizens 
occupied the adjoining district, and beyond lived 23

### 87736: Akhet-aton, city of the sun

all the tribe of hopefuls who came to Akhet-aton 
in search of a new life. The great temple in the 
city’s centre was formed of several courtyards 
leading to a sanctuary; the whole building was 
oriented to the rising sun and laid open to its 
sacred rays, for it had no roof. Thus the Pharaoh 
and his fellow-worshippers could commune 
directly with their god, bathed in a light made the 
more dazzling by the yellow colour omnipresent 
throughout the town. 
The most impressive building of all, however, 
was the Northern Palace, built a short way out- 
side the town for Nefertiti. It was a world in 
miniature. Set amid pools and gardens, a vast, 
square lake bordered by colonnades was sur- 
rounded by enclosures containing rare birds and 
beasts, a happy intrusion of nature into the daily 
human round. 
We now have a fairly clear idea of the daily 
life of Akhet-aton: of its many banquets, its fes- 
tivals in honour of the sun-god. But we still know 
little of its political activity. The world of affairs 
apparently took second place to the Pharaoh’s 
aesthetic preoccupations. 
Nevertheless, the fact that its god could be 
seen suggests that there must have been some- 
thing of a revolution in people’s perception of 
secular power. For in a city whose god is open 
to view, people live close to, and within the 
compass of, the divine. This new relationship 
between god and man lies at the heart of 
Akhenaton’s revolution, and its significance can 
be summed up in a metaphor of looking. Aton 
the all-seeing is, as it were, the eye of the sun; 
24 and the sun itself is the eye of god, both seeing

and seen. The old hidden god, Amon, saw every- 
thing without being observed, never revealing 
himself except through a glass darkly in the form 
of multifarious carved and graven images that 
served as scattered symbols of the divine presence 
among men. Maybe Akhenaton’s heresy lay in 
wanting to break through such substitutions, to 
do away with this distance of symbols and instead 
to bask permanently in the godhead’s shining 
light. 
That is why his creation was utopian in the 
true sense of the word. From a poetic point of 
view, utopia implies the promise of finally 
achieving a true and exact apprehension of reality. 
The Amarnan aesthetic lends itself to a kind of 
exacerbated realism. Imitating the solar disc itself, 
which radiates outwards in countless individual 
rays, the artist’s regard moves forth towards the 
object of its attention, the objective other that 
is also watching it. King Akhenaton is represented 
as he was, formless; a king whose reality lay in 
the regard of other people. 
One glimpses here the germs of the incipient 
democratic sense that some people have discerned 
in Akhenaton’s programme. Universally visible, 
dispensing light and life to all with equal bounty, 
the sun is the very emblem of a just monarch, 
indeed of utopia itself. But a king—even one who 
was also a poet—would find it hard to maintain 
such an exalted level in the day-to-day governance 
of any human community. Akhenaton’s courage 
lay in not having presupposed failure, and 
thereby having for a short time blurred the 
boundary between what is desirable and what is 
possible. ||

### 87737: A Golden age

Boos: texts speak of an ideal golden age in 
the distant past, when prevailing standards of 
moral propriety precluded the need for kings and 
government or even private property, boundary 
marks or fences. Then deceit and theft brought 
a gradual degradation and led to the need for all 
these institutions. A king, the Great Chosen One, 
was democratically elected. This, in a nutshell, 
1s an explanation of how contemporary society 
and its institutions came into existence. 
Buddhist writings contain no utopian remedy 
for a return to the lost golden age, but they do give 
plenty of advice about how to improve society, 
especially in the form of ethical principles. An 
ideal king must possess ten qualities: generosity, 
moral conduct, sacrifice, honesty, gentleness, 
asceticism, the capacity to refrain from anger, 
non-violence, forbearance and non-oppression. 
A community should guarantee its stability 
by assembling for consultation in harmony, trans- 
acting its business in harmony, and dispersing in 
harmony. It should not introduce revolutionary 
laws or break away from established conventions. 
Elders should be honoured and obeyed. Women 
should be respected and safeguarded. Spiritual 
obligations should be performed and free access 
and facilities to saints and holy persons should 
be allowed. 
An individual gained merit not only by per- 
forming religious observances but by rendering 
services to fellow-beings, such as providing them 
with roads and water, shady trees and rest-houses, 
medicine and food. The old and the very young 
were also to be protected. 
Buddha did not confine himself to the 
promulgation of an ideal social order. He actu- 
ally experimented with one. The community of 
Buddhist monks, the sangha, was an institution 
whose members observed monastic vows which 
enabled the Buddha's utopian social values and 
norms to be applied. Rules governing property 
ownership emphasized the egalitarian structure 
of the sangha. Every gift—and originally gifts 
were the only form of revenue as the members 
of the sangha did not engage in economic 
pursuits—was received collectively and held in 
A GOLDEN AGE 
BY ANANDA W.P. GURUGE 
perpetuity in the name of the sangha. No one had 
any private possessions. When a monk died or 
left the sangha, his personal effects reverted to col- 
lective ownership and were redistributed to 
others according to need. 
Fortnightly meetings were held at which the 
members of the sangha confessed and atoned for 
any transgressions and collectively committed 
themselves to observe the rules of conduct—227 
in the southern Buddhist tradition, 250 in the 
Chinese tradition. 
Because of its elaborate procedures and the 
extremely demanding regulation of behaviour, 
the sangha was a social model which only the 
most highly motivated could adopt. Thus, 
although it continues to exist and thrive after 
more than twenty-five centuries (with some relax- 
ation in its original rules), the sangha was never 
a model that could be applied to society at large. 
Nevertheless, many of its elements were emulated 
by later Hindu institutions such as the monastic 
communities founded by Sankara, and the Arya 
Samaj movement founded by Dayananda Saras- 
vatl in 1875. 
But above all, a practical application of Budd- 
hist ethical principles can be seen in the extraor- 
dinary experiment carried out in the third 
century BC by the Emperor Asoka, who deve- 
loped a humane socio-political system for the 
governance of his empire, the largest ever to exist 
in the Indian sub-continent. 
Nearly 200 inscriptions have been discovered, 
which reveal Asoka’s twofold strategy—on the 
one hand of seeking to convince people through 
admonition and on the other of issuing decrees 
and orders. Preferring the first course to the 
second, he used education to propagate his prin- 
ciples, appointed a cadre of officers who under- 
took regular tours of inspection, and inscribed. 
edicts and instructions on rocks and stone pillars. 
Asoka’s socio-political system operated suc- 
cessfully for at least two decades. But his empire 
declined and was dismembered almost immedi- 
ately after his demise. Was this because its foun- 
dations were utopian? This is a question which 
historians have yet to answer. |

T. dream of a paradise on Earth is a persis- 
tent feature of the history of humanity. It has 
inspired countless utopian experiments in com- 
munity living in different parts of the world. 
These attempts to create an ideal society have 
aroused widespread scepticism and still do. Is 
there not a contradiction inherent in trying to 
bring to life the notion of a place which is by 
definition located “nowhere”? 
The function of utopia has been to incite 
people to escape from history, to reject conven- 
tions and break away from the established order 
of things. Subversive by nature, the idea of utopia 
stretches the collective imagination beyond its 
limits. This subversiveness distinguishes utopian 
communities from those modelled on the 
dominant ideology of the society around them. 
Perhaps more than any other country in the 
world, the United States has been the setting for 
a wide variety of experiments in community

living. Both recent immigrants and long-time

per  of communal movements that has been a marked 
feature of American history. The religious 
impulse led to the quest for a heavenly Jerusalem. 
Such groups as the Shakers (who have since dis- 
appeared), the Rappites and the Amish turned 
their backs on the exploitation of the masses by 
industry and rejected the worship of technology 
and its amenities. The quest for a perfect life here 
and now and the hope of establishing a Kingdom 
of God on Earth characterized the thinking of 
these groups in which myth and utopia were 
mingled. 
The pathway 
to a new harmony 
The second, parallel trend is not centred on the 
supernatural, although its adherents have some- 
times used a religious vocabulary. These experi- 
ments 1n community living have been 
rationalistic, and specifically designed to bring 
about a political and economic regeneration. 
A first crop of associations appeared during 
the period of westwards expansion and lasted 
until around 1860. Most of them had European 
leaders who, like the prophets of old, hoped to 
create a new people. The Welsh philanthropist, 
socialist and former factory-owner Robert Owen 
designed his New Harmony community in 
Indiana as a prototype for future humanity and a 
model for general application. Equally optimistic 
intentions were expressed by the German tailor 
Wilhelm Weitling and by the French and 
American disciples of Charles Fourier and 
Etienne Cabet. 
A second flowering began almost a century 
later, in the late 1950s. For the most part these 
new associations claimed more modest aspirations 
than their predecessors. They sought to escape 
the constraints of city life, technocracy and the 
state, and to combat psychological, economic and 
political insecurity. These communities came in 
so many shapes, sizes and styles and were often 
so short-lived as to defy attempts at classification, 27

. but they included urban collectives, co-operatives, 
and communes. 
Many of these projects were based on a redis- 
covery of subjectivity, of the individual’ relation- 
ship with society, and of ecology. They were a 
breeding ground for activism against the Viet 
Nam war, the consumer society, environmental 
pollution, and the marginalization of women and 
homosexuals. 
Between these two major explosions of 
vitality there was an intermediary phase in which 
socialist co-operatives and communities were 
created by immigrants and anarchists fleeing 
persecution in other countries. In these zones of 
freedom a radical tradition was upheld, and all 
forms of authoritarianism were rejected. 
Modern Times 
One of the most remarkable experiments of the 
anarchist and libertarian movement was “Modern 
Times”, 2a community founded by Josiah Warren, 
the father of American anarchist individualism.

created in 1850, when Josiah Warren and his 
Fourierist disciple Stephen Paul Andrews bought 
a piece of land on Long Island, east of New York 
City on the site of what is now the town of Brent- 
wood. Warren wanted to create a community 
close enough to a big city for it to survive eco- 
nomically until it reached the ideal population 
of 1,000 persons which would enable it to be self- 
sufficient. 
The sandy soil, covered with tough, dense 
brushwood, was difficult to clear and required 
expensive fertilizer to cultivate. Sparks from the 
locomotive of the Long Island Railroad had 
caused more than one forest fire, and hardly any 
trees were left to provide protection from the 
wind. Only wild animals lived on this desolate 
tract of land. 
Two years later, a community of neat little 
cottages had been built. The site was divided into 
forty-nine blocks by seven streets running from 
north to south and seven avenues running from 
east to west. The streets and avenues were wide 
enough to give all the dwellings good access to 
air and light. Land was sold at a fixed price to 
anyone who wished to buy. No one was allowed 
to purchase more than three plots. 
Overlooking the private dwellings was a 
square two-storey building which housed a forge, 
a carpentry shop and a general store as well as 
apartments. The hard-working and strictly 
vegetarian inhabitants of Modern Times cleared 
the brush to create vegetable gardens, and planted 
pines to protect the town from the wind. In spite 
of disappointments and setbacks, they were soon 
producing enough fruit and vegetables to 
exchange among themselves and feed the commu- 
nity. Apple and cherry trees were planted along 
the main thoroughfares so that travellers passing

through could eat the fruit rather than having to 
beg for food. 
Newcomers to the community had to be able 
to provide for themselves and to follow a trade 
producing marketable goods, and so tailors, cob- 
blers, smiths, carpenters and other craftsmen were 
invited to join. The community had its own 
currency—notes which engaged the bearer to pay 
others in hours of work. Bonuses were added for 
the harder types of work. These “Time Notes” 
were accepted in nearby villages, were unaffected 
by the 1857 currency devaluation and were even 
used to pay taxes. Due to all these factors, many 
people who joined the community with modest 
resources were soon able to purchase their own 
homes. 
The right to be different 
Individualism was the rule, but the group was 
interested in communal solutions to cost-cutting 
and labour-saving as long as they respected 
individual tastes and interests. Members of the 
community enjoyed complete freedom of 
opinion. Each woman was free to choose the 
father of her children, and a ribbon on a girl’s 
finger indicated that she was “taken”. Thus mar- 
riage was rarely legalized. This doctrine, which 
was based on Fourier’s theory of the affinities of 
love, was responsible for the undeservedly scan- 
‘dalous reputation of Modern Times. 
This original experiment encouraged 
  
creativity and innovation among the commu- 
nity’s members. Two of them introduced stenog- 
raphy into the United States. One family 
developed safety belts to secure children in chairs 
and carriages. Clark Orvis, who later perfected 
the bicycle, invented an early form of self-service 
restaurant. 
The community’s fame spread as far as 
Russia, and the London-based leaders of the Inter- 
national Workers Association, including Karl 
Marx, took an interest in its activities. Cabet, 
Owen, Weitling, Auguste Comte and other well- 
known social reformers studied Warren’s theories, 
as did the leaders of the American labour 
movement. 
The story goes that during the Civil War the 
people of Modern Times sailed away to South 
America in a little ship with white wings, but this 
romantic story is only symbolically true. The 
increasing population in the area around Modern 
Times hastened the end of the experiment. Josiah 
Warren went to live in Boston. For him the time 
for experimentation was over. From then on he 
devoted himself to expounding his theories. 
The Modern Times experiment is striking for 
its complete absence of dogmatism. The right to 
be different made it possible for people to live as 
they pleased and find fulfilment in their own 
inventiveness and intellectual and spiritual pur- 
suits. It was an “open” utopia which through its 
image of serenity and love of life gave new impetus 
to the quest for freedom. |

PARADISE IN 4338? 
Utzon writers have often presented their 
message in the form of semi-political, semi-fantastic 
stories, and today the frontier between “pure” 
utopian writing and science fiction is very hard to 
define. Although Russian utopian literature has 
produced no world-famous books such as More’s 
Utopia and Campanella’s City of the Sun, it never- 
theless provides instances of remarkable insight. 
In the mid-eighteenth century, Russian fic- 
tion consisted almost entirely of utopian writings, 
which showed traces of the influence of the 
French Enlightenment. Whether the setting was 
an imaginary island or a real place like ancient 
BY VSEVOLOD REVICH 
Rome, utopianism was a form ideally suited to 
philosophical moralizing. 
When describing his novel Numa, or 
Flourishing Rome, Mikhail Matveevich Kheraskov 
wrote as follows: “This story is not absolutely 
true historically. It is embellished with many fap- 
tasies which make it more beautiful without 
depreciating Numa’s deeds.” Numa’s wise rule 
prompts the author to give a piece of sagacious 
if somewhat cautious advice to sovereigns which 
still seems relevant today. The true glory of a 
sovereign, he says, “is not always won with 
weapons...for the triumphant cries of the victors

are often accompanied by the lamentations of 
widows and orphans”. Kheraskov sadly notes 
that his story will have hardly any impact, but 
“if there is no happy society on Earth let it at 
least exist in books and afford us the consolation 
that we too can be happy one day”. 
A pretext 
for political confrontation 
Many novels of this kind were written in late 
eighteenth-century Russia. The best-known was 
Alexander Radischev’s Journey from St. Petersburg 
to Moscow, a denunciation of serfdom which con- 
tains a utopian account of how prosperous free 
farmers could be. At the other end of the polit- 
ical spectrum, Prince Mikhail Scherbatov’s A 
Journey to the Ofirian Land vigorously opposed 
Peter the Great's reforms, described cities as a 
source of moral degradation and their buildings

as “heaps of stones”, and advocated a return to 
the patriarchal way of life. 
The 1825 Decembrist uprising against Tsarist 
autocracy left a mark on nineteenth-century Rus- 
sian history and on philosophical dreams of 
Russia’s destiny. The Decembrist Wilhelm 
Kiichelbecker wrote The Land of the Headless, a 
satirical sketch in which the narrator lands on the 
Moon where he finds a social system which 
embodies the worst aspects of Russian life. 
Kiichelbecker had discovered that utopias may 
have undesirable features, a new slant which gave 
rise to a flood of “anti-utopias” a century later. 
The major Russian utopian work of the first 
half of the nineteenth century was an unfinished 
story by Vladimir Odoyevsky, The Year 4338. In 
4338, according to Odoyevsky’s calculations, the 
Earth should cross the path of a massive comet 
and possibly even collide with it. The plot centres 
on human efforts to avoid this disaster. In 
Odoyevsky’s utopia, the Moon is uninhabited 
and serves as a source of supplies for the Earth, 
which is threatened by overpopulation. Electric 
vehicles are driven along underground tunnels. 
Siberia is heated by energy from volcanoes. Per- 
sonal aircraft are used. Clothes are made of glass 
fibre. St. Petersburg has merged with Moscow, 
forming an immense megalopolis. 
Odoyevsky makes the same mistake as many 
other writers about utopia. He talks about the 
general improvement of conditions, but devotes 
no attention whatever to the spiritual life of the 
people who live in these flourishing societies. 
Nikolai Chernyshevsky tried to avoid this error 
in “The Fourth Dream of Vera Pavlovna”, a uto- 
pian chapter of his novel What is to be Done? In 
this socialist Song of Solomon, Chernyshevsky 
depicts the future as a Kingdom of Love—not 
puritan, abstract love, but earthly love which 
brings people the joy of life. Unlike Odoyevsky, 
with his preference for the city, Chernyshevsky 
believed that a healthy and happy life is only pos- 
sible in a natural environment. 
In contrast to these writers, Feodor 
Dostoyevsky in his A Dream of a Funny Man has 
no good word to say for socialism—or for what he 
calls socialism. Alas, it appears that Dostoyevsky 
was right on many points. 
Perfect worlds, 
soulless worlds 
Around the 1890s, Russian utopian thought 
started to become more diversified and original. 
One notable example of a new cosmic trend is 
Nikolai Fyodorov’s Philosophy of the Common 
Cause (1906, 1913), a remarkable book in which 
Fyodorov imagines the resurrection of all the 
people who ever lived on Earth. 31

__________________] 
VSEVOLOD REVICH, 
of the Soviet Union, is a 
literary critic and essayist. A 
student of utopia and fantasia 
in fiction, he has written over 
200 works including essays 
entitled ‘Neither Truth nor 
Invention”, “Tragedy and 
Fairytale’ and ‘Realism in 
Fantasy”. 
 
Reactionary writers afraid of the changes that 
were impending in Russia laced their views with 
sober warnings which unfortunately were not 
heeded. The radical young were unable to find 
a rational message in treatises permeated with 
great-power chauvinism. 
The characters in Nikolai Shelonsky’s novel 
The World of the Future (1892) find themselves in 
the thirtieth century faced with a map on which 
Germany and Italy no longer exist. England and 
America have survived but in an “uncivilized 
state” —they are capitalist countries characterized 
by the pursuit of profit, extremes of wealth and 
poverty, and militarism. On the other hand, the 
alliance between Russia and France—based on the 
Orthodox faith—has enabled these countries to 
attain an extraordinarily high level of spiritual 
and social development. The book also contains 
many inklings of future developments— 
television, synthetic fabrics, the Channel Tunnel, 
and even anti-matter. 
At the other political extreme, the most 
notable socialist fantasy of these years was Red 
Star by Alexander Bogdanov, an associate of 
Lenin until ideological differences drove them 
apart. The Red Star is Mars, which is inhabited 
by humanoids who are practically indistinguish- 
able from human beings. The communist prin- 
ciple reigns supreme: from each according to his 
abilities, to each according to his needs. The Mar- 
tians’ basic need is to work, and they often change 
jobs to enjoy the pleasures of diversity. Economic 
stability is maintained by information-computing 
machines. Just imagine, computers in 1908! 
Here again spiritual life leaves much to be 
desired. The Martians are polite and considerate, 
but incapable of emotion. The logic of expe- 
diency takes the place of inner motivation. In this 
atmosphere Sterney, a mathematician, works out 
a project to annihilate humankind and colonize 
the Earth. Whether intentionally or not, Bog- 
danov makes the prophetic statement that mons- 
trous, inhuman projects can be generated by a 
rationally organized society if it does not rest on 
firm moral principles. 
The end of an illusion 
Andrei Platonov, artistic genius and prophet, re- 
alized much earlier and more clearly than his con- 
temporaries that attempts to build a new society 
on servility or by decree were immoral and 
doomed to failure. Such enterprises can lead only 
to a common grave in which the builders of the 
society either lie down of their own free will (The 
Foundation Pit), or are dispatched there by other 
means (Chevengur). And if Mikhail Bulgakov 
went wrong in his grotesque play Adam and Eve, 
it was only in his supposition that a few people 
would survive the use of weapons of mass des- 
truction. 
The hero of Sigiezmund Krzhizhanovsky’s 
story Recollections of the Future, written in the 
late 1920s, invents a time machine and travels 
several years into the future, but what he sees is 
so horrible that he hurries back and tells nobody 
about it. 
In the same alarmist vein is Yevgeny 
Zamyatin’s famous futurist novel We (1924), 
one of the key books of the twentieth century. 
To the indignation of the Soviet press, it was first 
published abroad. The critic Alexander Voronsky 
denounced it as a hostile caricature of com- 
munism. He could not have known of the sinister

developments that would transform Zamyatin’s 
fiction into reality only ten or fifteen years later, 
that Zamyatin would manage to emigrate, and 
that he, Voronsky, would end his days in a prison 
camp set up by Stalin’s secret police, which bore 
an astonishing resemblance to the Guardians 
described in the novel. 
Such a pessimistic view of man reduced to a 
number is a grotesque exaggeration—or is it? The 
twentieth century, so rich in invention, has 
brought several similar surprises. Signs of 
Zamyatin’s world can be seen wherever indepen- 
dent thought is suppressed, the individual is en- 
slaved, and people are trained like animals to 
respond to a ringing bell. Have we not seen entire 
nations seized by a paroxysm of admiration for 
their “Benefactor”, as Zamyatin calls him? 
A wild hope 
  
  
‘The utopian writers of the 1920s were the chil- 
dren of their age. Their novels invariably begin 
with the triumph of world revolution. Thus, in 
one of the first Soviet utopian novels, The Coming 
World by Yakov Okunev (1923), two men wake 
up 200 years into the future. What do they see? 
“There are hardly any open spaces left on the 
globe. As far as the eye can see there are streets, 
gardens, squares, more streets...a boundless world 
  
city.” Okunev, like Odoyevsky, seems to view 
nature as an enemy that should be conquered and 33

tamed. Today hardly anyone would be delighted 
to see such a concrete jungle. 
A similar picture emerges in V. Nikolsky’s 
A Thousand Years After (1926), which describes 
the world of the thirtieth century as brighter, 
cleaner and richer than ours, but containing 
hardly anything that had not been imagined sixty 
years before, except that in Nikolsky’s world 
everything is bigger, stronger, and faster. The 
author extrapolates from the world he knows: 
machines are as big as railway carriages or weigh 
100 tons, a mine is 2,000 kilometres deep, and 
an artificial satellite orbits the Earth. 
In the early 1930s, when Stalin was fashioning 
ideology with his callous hands, forecasts of the 
future ceased to appear. From then on, those who 
wrote about the future had to base their work 
not on the study of real life or on their own fan- 
tasies but on prevailing ideological dogma, which 
meant armed confrontation between socialism 
and imperialism, with the former winning a quick 
and easy victory. 
A painful awakening 
The appearance of Ivan Efremov’s novel 
Andromeda in 1957 is closely associated with the 
reawakening of social consciousness that took 
place after Stalin’s death in 1953. Today it is 
difficult to share Efremov’s unflagging optimism 
about the future of humanity, but his novel is 
the most complete picture of communist society 
in the history of utopian thought. In fact Efremov 
depicts a depoliticized society which has rid itself 
of all kinds of oppression. 
Perhaps the most attractive feature of the 
society he describes is that it provides all its 
members with an opportunity to fulfil them- 
selves, rather than providing guarantees of wel- 
fare or longevity. 
Efremov depicts the world with more 
warmth than his predecessors, and it is really pos- 
sible to conceive of living in it, which is more 
than can be said for the sterile barracks described 
by some of his predecessors. This is not to imply 
that everything is perfect—today’s reader is sure 
to note Efremov’s indifference to ecological 
problems. The threat to the environment escaped 
the attention of most science fiction writers. 
The utopia imagined by Efremov will prob- 
ably be the last to evoke a society of absolute har- 
mony and tranquillity. Efremov’s euphoria soon 
evaporated. His next novel about a distant future, 
The Hour of Taurus, written only ten years later, 
is filled with dark foreboding. 
The highroad of history seems to have taken 
an unexpected turning. But where is it leading? 
The next generation of utopian writers will have 
34 plenty to think about. uN 
 


### 87740: Blueprints for an ideal community

BLUEPRINTS FOR AN 
Honea studies of plans for ideal cities 
tend to be preoccupied with geometry and sym- 
metry: they are all square, circular, polygonal or 
hexagonal. Aristophanes, in his play The Birds, 
makes fun of the concept of geometric cities, of 
Plato and his disciples and of all rigid planners 
of other people’s futures. 
The recurrence of geometric plans in utopias 
down the ages is partly explained, of course, by 
the nature of the walled and fortified towns of 
classical and medieval times, and partly by the 
fact that all these schemes are what economists 
would call “models” or what sociologists would 
call “ideal types”. If they were ever realized, they 
would be modified to accommodate existing 
physical features, artefacts and social institutions.

### 87740: Blueprints for an ideal community

  
IDEAL COMMUNITY sv coun warp 
There was little recognition of this among 
utopians before the humanist writers of the 
Renaissance. 
The fifteenth-century Italian architect Leon 
Battista Alberti, for example, did not attempt to 
design an ideal city (although his projects include 
an ideal Fortress for a Tyrant, in which the palace 
is protected equally against the external and the 
internal enemy). He insists that 1t is enough to 
discover the principles that can be adapted to any 
site and the needs of the citizens. 
During the Renaissance Europeans began to 
travel the world as a prelude to conquest and 
exploitation. The tales they brought back 
influenced a series of utopian books. Thus the hero 
of Thomas More’s Utopia, Raphael Hythlodaye,   
  
Left, Work, by the English artist 
Ford Madox Brown (1821-1893). 
Above, 19th-century depiction of a phalanx,

who was inspired by Renaissance images 
of utopia. 
is cast as a Portuguese sailor from the crew which 
sailed with the explorer Amerigo Vespucci. 
More’s book, written in Latin, takes the form 
of a discussion in the garden of a house in Ant- 
werp, between himself, Raphael Hythlodaye and 
a Flemish friend, Peter Gilles. Hythlodaye 
. remarks that life is fairer in the island of Utopia, 
where property is owned by the community, 
than in the England of their day. 
To prove his point, he describes the common- 
wealth of Utopia. Particular attention is given to 
the architecture and planning of utopian cities: 
“Their buildings are good, and are so uniform, 
that a whole side of a street looks like one house. 
The streets are twenty feet broad; there lie 
gardens behind all their houses...every house has 
both a door to the street and a back door to the 
garden.... There being no property among them, 
every man may freely enter into any house what- 
soever. At least every ten years they shift their 
houses by lots.” 
In More’s ideal city everybody understands 
farming. Children learn it at school and in visits 
to the country. Everyone turns out to help at har- 
vest time. If the population of any city grows, 
they do not build over the gardens, but “fill up 
the lack in other cities”, or “build up a town in 
the next land where the inhabitants have much 
waste and unoccupied ground”. 
Utopian writing of the European Enlighten- 
ment in the eighteenth century also used stories 
of the exploration of unknown regions as a device 
to criticize the familiar world of the European 
states. Even before Australia was “discovered” 39

by voyagers, the French writer Gabriel de Foigny 
published New Discovery of Terra Incognita Aus- 
tralis (1676). He was the first utopian to conceive 
of a society without government. Following the 
French navigator Louis-Antoine de Bougainville’s 
exploration of the islands of Oceania in the 1760s, 
Denis Diderot wrote his delightful Supplement to 
Bougainville’s Voyage. Published posthumously, 
after the French Revolution, it consists of an 
imaginary conversation between an old man from 
Tahiti, who describes the freedom and plenty that 
existed before the Europeans came, and a French 
sailor who tells him of the misery of the poor 
in pre-revolutionary France. 
Worlds of industrial plenty 
The nineteenth century changed everything, 
including utopias. The steam engine, iron and 
steel, the railway, the factory system and the huge 
growth of towns and cities all led to utopian 
writing which projected the pace of industriali- 
zation into the future. In 1816 the philosopher 
and economist Claude-Henri de Saint-Simon was 
already predicting that France and its population 
would be organized as one vast factory. Later 
in the century, in The Coming Race: or the New 
Utopia (1870), Lord Lytton foresaw a future 
in which machinery and robots would be 
powered by a new form of energy called vril. 
This was followed by another widely read 
industrial utopia by the American writer Edward 
Bellamy, Looking Backward (1888), in which 
the hero awakens from a hypnotic state in 
the year 2000. His host explains what has 
happened: 
““The movement toward the conduct of bus- 
iness by larger and larger aggregations of capital, 
the tendency towards monopolies, which has 
been so desperately and vainly resisted, was recog-

nized at last, in its true significance, as a process 
which only needed to complete its logical evolu- 
tion to open a golden future to humanity... 
When the nation became the sole employer, all 
the citizens, by virtue of their citizenship, became 
employees, to be distributed according to the 
needs of industry....”” 
The optimistic scientific utopias of the 
nineteenth century gave rise to a whole genre of 
deeply pessimistic anti-utopian literature in the 
twentieth: savage satires on the trends of indus- 
trial society by such writers as H.G. Wells, 
George Orwell and Yevgeny Zamyatin. 
A simpler life 
There also arose in the 1890s a stream of alterna- 
tive utopian thinking, looking towards what we 
would now call a post-industrial, ecologically 
viable human society. 
The English poet and craftsman William 
Morris was so outraged by Edward Bellamy’s 
vision of the world as one vast factory that he 
wrote a history of the future that be wanted. In 
News from Nowhere, the author awakens in a 
future England which has abandoned not only 
factories but government and money too. It has 
become a nation of craft workers, delighting in 
making beautiful things, whose idea of a holiday 
is to row up the river to work in the fields at har- 
vest time. The “big murky places which were 
once the centres of manufacture” have disap- 
peared, and the ecological change in the human 
environment is the result of a change in the pur- 
pose of work. 
Citizens of the future explain to the time- 
travelling Morris: “The wares which we make are 
made because they are needed; men make for 
their neighbour’s use as if they are making for 
themselves, not for a vague market of which they 
know nothing, and over which they have no con- 
trol.... Nothing can be made except for genuine 
use; therefore no inferior goods are made. 
Moreover, as we have now found out what we 
want, so we make no more than we want; and 
as we are not driven to make a vast quantity of 
useless things, we have time and resources enough 
to consider our pleasure in making them. All 
work which would be irksome to do by hand is 
done by immensely improved machinery; and in 
all work which it 1s a pleasure to do by hand, 
machinery is done without...” 
Two contemporaries of Morris also had an 
immense concern for the details of productive 
work and the decentralization of human settle- 
ments. Peter Kropotkin, a Russian geographer 
and anarchist, argues in favour of mixing factory 
work with farm work, brain work with manual 
work, and town jobs with country jobs, in his 
Fields, Factories and Workshops (1899). 
Looking at the enormous productivity of 
small workshops and horticulture as opposed to 
large-scale industry and farming, Kropotkin

claims that the future lies with the dispersal of 
both. The significance of this book, which gives 
it relevance almost a century later, is that it is a 
plea for “a new economy in the energies used in 
supplying the needs of human life, since these 
needs are increasing and the energies are not 
inexhaustible”. 
Another utopian contemporary of Morris 
was an obscure English inventor and shorthand 
writer, Ebenezer Howard. The question he asked 
himself was very simple. How can we solve the 
problems of desperate overcrowding in the 
metropolitan city, with all the human misery it 
produces, and at the same time cope with the 
depopulation of rural areas from which the young 
and active escape precisely because of the lack of 
opportunities? 
Howard’s answer was the garden city. His 
book Garden Cities of Tomorrow (1898) advocates 
a network of planned small towns, providing 
homes and employment and incorporating 
agriculture with industrial work, surrounded by 
a green belt, and linked by public transport to 
form a “Social City”. It was very influential in 
the ideology of town and country planning

Garden City, and his work inspired the British

Ecological utopian thinking 
There is an extraordinary gap between the widely 
read utopian writings of the 1890s and the new 
environmental, ecological awareness that emerged 
in the 1970s, with its consciousness of the finite 
nature of the world’s resources and the terrifying 
rate at which they are being exhausted. Few uto- 
plans have explored the implications of an eco- 
logically aware civilization. 
One notable exception is the American 
science fiction writer Ursula Le Guin. Her novel 
The Dispossessed (1974) presents the experiences 
of a visitor from one planet, where a Kropot- 
kinian ethic of mutual aid has won a viable 
society from an arduous environment, to another 
planet where society is built upon self-indulgent 
consumerism. Another American novel, Ernest 
Callebach’s Ecotopia (1975), carefully examines 
the dilemmas which would face a society which 
attempts to adopt a green or ecologically aware 
ideology.

hands of anyone interested in the connections 
between utopia, architecture and ecological cons- 
ciousness is an older American exploration of uto- 
plan imaginings. This is Communitas: Means of 
Livelihood and Ways of Life (1947) by Paul and 
Percival Goodman. They were brothers, a poet 
and an architect, and they compiled this book 
during the Second World War as a modest and 
dissident contribution to the worldwide debate 
on “post-war reconstruction”. Numerous works 
of this kind were produced in many countries, 
most of which have been completely forgotten. 
Communitas survives because, as the philosopher 
Lewis Mumford put it, it is the only modern con- 
tribution to the art of building cities which “deals 
with the underlying values and purposes, polit- 
ical and moral, on which planning of any sort 
must be based”. 
The Goodman brothers saw a “community 
plan” not as a layout of streets and houses, but 
as the external form given to human activity: 
“There is a variety of town schemes: gridirons, 
radiations, ribbons, satellites, or vast concentra- 
tions; what is important is the activity going on, 
how it is influenced by the scheme and how it 
transforms any schemes, and uses or abuses any 
site, to its own work and values.” 
Their book examines the three main types 
of city plan which had emerged in the previous 
hundred years, grouping them into Green Belt 
Plans, Industrial Plans and Integrated Plans. They 
see the first as a reaction against the ugliness and 
squalor of the factory system—attempts to 
recreate pre-industrial values, or to live decently 
with industry. Next they turn to city plans 
centred on production, with an absorbing discus- 
sion of forgotten urban utopias dreamed about 
in the Soviet Union in the 1920s, and of the tech- 
nological solutions appropriate to an advanced 
economy put forward by the American engineer 
Buckminster Fuller. His “Dymaxion” house, 
conceived in 1929-1932, was based on the mass 
production of lightweight self-sufficient houses

depend on an industrial system in the back- 
ground. 
Finally the Goodmans examine those utopian 
plans which integrate city and country, such as 
American architect Frank Lloyd Wright's dream 
of Broadacre City where the whole population 
is dispersed over the entire countryside and 
dependent on small farming and vaguely decen- 
tralized industry. This formula was more effec- 
tively argued for many years by another 
American, Ralph Borsodi, who declared that by 
cutting out the costs of transportation and mar- 
keting and a host of middlemen, at least two- 
thirds of the goods and services required in a 
home could be more efficiently produced domes- 
tically with electrically powered tools. 
Yet the brothers were sternly realistic. They 
had the honesty to emphasize, rather than 
minimize, the fact that we all have different uto- 
pian dreams. Aware that someone’s utopia is 
someone else’s hell, they arrived at three quite 
different formulae for ideal communities. 
The first is the City of Efficient Consump- 
tion, which can be recognized in most European 
or American cities today. The second, the New 
Commune, is an idealized version of the small 
workshop economy that actually sustains the 
Italian region of Emilia-Romagna today. 
The third, in which they envisage a two-level 
economy, they call Maximum Security: 
Minimum Regulation. Everyone would be 
obliged to work for a short time (as in military 
conscription) in a basic economy, attending the 
machines which provide food, clothing and 
shelter, distributed free to all. The rest of the time 
would be occupied in a luxury economy in which 
the choice of activity is left to the individual. 
Needs such as medicine and transport would be 
taken care of by a financial arrangement between 
the subsistence economy and the secondary 
economy. This solution may well prove instruc- 
tive to politicians seeking to resolve the contradic- 
tions between the ideology of a welfare state and 
the virtues of a free market. n

I. the idea of lifelong education utopian? Partly 
it 1s a matter of definition. Strictly speaking, the 
only projects that qualify to be called utopian are 
those that envisage a new world radically different 
from our own, based on aims and values entirely 
different from those of the established order and 
drawing on a common will for change. Absolute 
otherness is the hallmark of utopia. 
So to answer the question we must find out 
whether or not the concept of an educational 
experience stretching from the cradle to the grave 
implies the complete transformation of present- 
day education and whether or not it presupposes 
a new model of society. 
The fact is that lifelong education involves 
a great deal more than a learning experience 


### 87742: Non-stop learning

  
NON-STOP LEARNING 
BY GILBERT LECLERC 
lasting from infancy into old age. It also embraces 
the idea that education should no longer be exclu- 
sively confined to schools. Instead it should 
embrace all of life—work, leisure, the environ- 
ment, family, job, society, international relations. 
It requires that people should become their own 
teachers so as to realize their full intellectual, emo- 
tional and artistic potential. And it demands that 
in this quest everyone should have an equal 
chance of success. 
In this new view of education, every aspect 
of a person’s life has some educational sig- 
nificance. The whole panoply of educational 
resources must be available to all, so every 
individual can attain his or her full potential. 
This last objective is of central importance 
for all the pioneers of the new philosophy, and 
particularly those who have worked with Unesco 
in this field. Lifelong education seeks nothing less 
than the complete transformation of the 
experience of learning, which it attempts to 
expand to its uttermost limits in time, space, 
and the social arena. It aims to replace a part-time 
and compartmentalized system with one that is 
both continuous and integrated. Under its aegis, 
every aspect of peoples’ existence would be 
open to the lessons of a world in which educa- 
tion is ommnipresent. The theory demands a 
completely new perspective. Opened up in all 
directions, the horizons of education become 
almost limitless. 
The idea, then, is certainly revolutionary in 
its educational implications, but does it presup- 
pose a social transformation of similar scope? 
Once again its proponents would answer “yes”. 
A society genuinely dedicated to education in its 
widest sense requires both new structures and 
altered ways of thinking. Such a commitment 
would not be compatible with a profit-oriented 
consumer society. Nor would it sit easily with 
a technocratic world in which knowledge is the 
restricted property of specialists, or with a 
bureaucratic society that tends to obfuscate the 
ways in which it is run. 
So by its very nature the concept of lifelong 
education would seem to be utopian. The old 
ideal of an education fulfilling all aspirations and 
developing every potential has doubtless never 
before been pushed so far. It is hardly surprising, 39

GILBERT LECLERC, 
of Canada, is head of the 
research and development of 
lifelong education at the 
University of Sherbrooke, 
Quebec. The author of a

Montréal, 1985). 
  
then, that it has induced thousands of men and 
women to try to construct a new world. 
Although it is only thirty years since it was first 
formulated, this dream has already inspired 
countless projects and experiments in many parts 
of the world, and in so doing has played an 
important role in the development of contem- 
porary education. 
It is the fate of utopias, though, never to be 
realized in full. Whenever enthusiasts have tried 
to transplant their vision from the written page 
to the real world, whether by democratic or by . 
revolutionary means, they have either been mar- 
ginalized or forced to compromise to some degree 
with the existing system—always assuming that 
they have not simply had to give up. In one sense, 
then, the history of utopia is an unbroken 
sequence of failures, for the dreamed-of perfect 
society has never been brought to fruition. 
From another point of view, though, its pages 
are studded with success, if one considers the 
untold number of genuine, practical achievements 
that the utopian vision has inspired. Viewed in 
this light, utopia appears less as a blueprint for 
action than as a motive force that, by creating 
new horizons for social progress, has the power 
to get history under way. And if human destiny 
is so rich in potential, it is because the deepest 
truths about mankind and society cry out for an 
imagined world that cannot be found in a 
revamped version of the existing one. 
Human activity only takes on its full sig- 
nificance if it can be conceived of as an incessant 
search for totalization. People have always held 
before them as a beacon a vision of some state 
or condition that would lead them away from the 
particular and towards the totality of experience. 
Inevitably they have drawn inspiration from the 
imaginary, since the condition they seek does not 
yet exist; insofar as it is not simply a variant on 
existing conditions, it is necessarily utopian, 
which is to say radically other. No genuinely 
innovatory change is possible without this 
visionary dimension. | 
As education is particularly concerned with 
the totalization of experience and with the ful- 
filment of human potential, it is bound to feed 
on utopias. Without them it would be caught in 
a vicious circle of repetition and stereotypes. 
Need one add, then, that a utopian approach to 
education is just as essential as a scientific 
approach? Imagination and reason both have a 
part to play in shaping tomorrow’s education. 
The role of the imagination is to come up with 
new models, better adapted than existing ones to 
the individual’s changing needs. Reason must test 
these visions and put into action those that are 
viable. The road to reality must pass through the 
creative imagination. uN

### 87743: A Planetary utopia

DOCUMENT 
=3 
  
In 1946 the British 
scientist and 
humanist Julian 
Huxley (d. 1975), 
soon to be Unesco’s 
first Director-General, 
wrote a long paper 
entitled Unesco, its 
purpose and its 
philosophy, in 
which he set forth 
guidelines for the 
new organization. 
The document was 
highly controversial. 
It was regarded by 
some as an attack 
on religion, by others 
as pro-communist. 
Eventually Unesco’s 
General Conference 
refused to sponsor 
its publication. Over 
forty years later, 
Huxley's “planetary 
utopia” has lost none 
of its force or 
topicality. Published 
below are salient 
extracts. 
 
I. general, Unesco must constantly be testing 
its policies against the touchstone of evolutionary 
progress. A central conflict of our times 1s that 
between nationalism and internationalism, be- 
tween the concept of many national sovereignties 
and one world sovereignty. Here the evolutionary 
touchstone gives an unequivocal answer. The key 
to man’s advance, the distinctive method which 
has made evolutionary progress in the human sec- 
tor so much more rapid than in the biological and 
has given it higher and more satisfying goals, is the 
fact of cumulative tradition, the existence of a 
common pool of ideas which is self-perpetuating 
and itself capable of evolving. And this fact has 
had the immediate consequence of making the 
type of social organization the main factor in hu- 
man progress or at least its limiting framework. 
Two obvious corollaries follow. First, that the 
more united man’s tradition becomes, the more 
rapid will be the possibility of progress: several 
separate or competing or even mutually hostile 
pools of tradition cannot possibly be so efficient 
as a single pool common to all mankind. And 
secondly, that the best and only certain way of 
securing this will be through political unification. 
As history shows, unifying ideas can exert an 
effect across national boundaries. But, as history 
makes equally evident, that effect is a partial one 
and never wholly offsets the opportunities for 
conflict provided by the existence of separate 
sovereign political units. 
The moral for Unesco is clear. The task laid 
upon it of promoting peace and security can never 
be wholly realized through the means assigned 
to it—education, science and culture. It must en- 
visage some form of world political unity, whether 
through a single world government or otherwise, 
as the only certain means for avoiding war. 
However, world political unity is, unfor- 
tunately, a remote ideal, and in any case does not 
fall within the field of Unesco’s competence. This 
A PLANETARY UTOPIA 
BY JULIAN HUXLEY 
does not mean that Unesco cannot do a great deal 
towards promoting peace and security. Specifi- 
cally, in its education programme it can stress the 
ultimate need for world political unity and 
familiarize all peoples with the implications of 
the transfer of full sovereignty from separate 
nations to a world organization. 
But, more generally, it can do a great deal to 
lay the foundations on which world political 
unity can later be built. It can help the peoples 
of the world to mutual understanding and to a 
realization of the common humanity and 
common tasks which they share, as opposed to 
the nationalisms which too often tend to isolate 
and separate them. (...) 
Qur evolutionary analysis shows clearly 
enough that a well-developed human individual 
is the highest product of evolution to date. This 
provides external and scientific support for the 
democratic principle of the dignity of men, to 
which by its Constitution Unesco is committed. 
It also constitutes a complete disproof of all 
theses, like those of Hegelian philosophy, of fas- 
cism, or of nazism, which maintain that the state 
1s in some way higher than the individual, and . 
that the individual exists only or primarily for 
the state. 
On the other hand, we have been brought 
to realize that the evolution of man, though a 
natural continuation of that of the rest of life, is 
quite a different process, operating by the essen- 
tially social method of cumulative tradition, and 
manifesting itself primarily in the development 
of societies, instead of in the genetic nature of the 
individuals composing them. And this at once 
makes it equally obvious that the opposed thesis 
of unrestricted individualism is equally erroneous. 
The human individual is, quite simply, 
meaningless in isolation; he only acquires sig- 
nificance in relation to some form of society. His 
development is conditioned by the society into 41

### 87743: A Planetary utopia

which he is born and the social traditions which 
he inherits; and the value of the work he does 
in life depends on the social framework which 
benefits by it or transmits it to later time. 
Thus Unesco’s activities, while concerned 
primarily with providing richer development and 
fuller satisfactions for the individual, must always 
be undertaken in a social context; and many of 
its specific tasks will be concerned with the social 
means towards this general end—the improve- 
ment of social mechanisms or agencies, such as 
educational systems, research organizations, art 
centres, the press, and so forth. 
In particular, Unesco must clearly pay special 
attention to the social mechanism of cumulative 
tradition in all its aspects, with the aim of ensur- 
ing that it is both efficient and rightly directed 
in regard to its essential function of promoting 
human evolution. 
The unifying of traditions in a single com- 
mon pool of experience, awareness, and purpose 
1s the necessary prerequisite for further major 
progress in human evolution. Accordingly, 
although political unification in some sort of 
world government will be required for the defini- 
tive attainment of this stage, unification in the 
things of the mind is not only also necessary but 
can pave the way for other types of unification. 
Thus in the past the great religions unified 
the thoughts and attitudes of large regions of the 
Earth’s surface; and in recent times science, both 
directly through its ideas and indirectly through 
its applications in shrinking the globe, has been 
a powerful factor in directing men’s thoughts to 
the possibilities of, and the need for, full world 
unity. 
Special attention should consequently be 
given by Unesco to the problem of constructing 
a unified pool of tradition for the human species 
as a whole. This, as indicated elsewhere, must in- 
clude the unity-in-variety of the world’s art and 
culture as well as the promotion of one single 
pool of scientific knowledge. 
But it must also eventually include a unified 
common outlook and a common set of purposes. 
This will be the latest part of the task of unify- 
ing the world mind; but Unesco must not neglect 
it while engaged on the easier jobs, like that of 
promoting a single pool of scientific knowledge 
and effort. [|

### 87744: Imaginary cities

IMAGINARY CITIES 
BY CRISTINA GRAU 
M... famous writers have por- 
trayed city life. They have taken over 
real cities and transformed them into 
literary objects and they have creat- 
ed imaginary cities with lives of their 
own. They have reconstructed urban 
settings from scattered fragments of 
memory, and have brought fame to 
cities that were previously unknown. 
A stroll through the urban land- 
scapes of literature reveals a vari- 
ety of creations: cities depicted with 
a high degree of realism, cities in the 
abstract, cities which merely provide 
background atmosphere, and cities 
which are themselves protagonists in 
works of fiction. 
The realistic city 
Joyce's Dublin, Proust's Paris, Kaf- 
ka's Prague, and the Buenos Aires of 
Borges are realistically depicted ci- 
ties which help to shape the course 
of the fictional events which take 
place in them. 
Although Kafka rarely refers to 
Prague in his novels and short sto- 
ries, his native city has a very spe- 
cial place in them. Prague is never 
actually named in The Trial, for ex- 
ample, but the meandering corridors 
and passages, the disconnected set- 
tings through which Joseph K. 
wanders in an attempt to find out 
why he is being tried, evoke the at- 
mosphere of Gothic Prague and the 
labyrinth of narrow streets in its Jew- 
ish district. 
The city is seen as if ina dream or 
through the mists of memory, in 
black and white, with the contrasts 
of light and shadow that appear in Ex- 
pressionist films, The impression of 
being in a dream is reinforced by 
topological distortions (as when 
something distant suddenly seems 
very near, and vice versa) and by 
44 changes of scale which make space 
seem to expand or contract, depend- 
ing on K.’s state of mind. The vision 
of reality is phantasmagoric. 
The building in which K.'s trial is 
to be held “was of unusual extent, 
the main entrance was particularly 
high”, but when K. enters it he gets 
lost in a maze of corridors, landings, 
stairways and empty rooms—it is 
more like a tenement than a law 
court. On ancther occasion, K. opens 
the door of a lumbper-room in the 
bank where he works and “finds him- 
self suddenly in the court precincts’. 
In his story Amerika, Kafka depicts 
New York, where he never set foot, 
as an abstract, futuristic version of 
Prague. The outstanding features are 
the towering skyscrapers and geo- 
metric layout that differentiate it 
most strongly from his native city, 
with its labyrinth of winding streets 
Capriccio (1795) by William Marlow. 
      
 
and alleyways. When Karl, the hero 
of the story, leans over the balcony 
of his uncle’s New York house (a bal- 
cony is not exactly typical of New 
York buildings), he is fascinated by 
the sight of the street which “ran per- 
fectly straight between two rows of 
squarely chopped buildings and 
therefore seemed to be fleeing into 
the distance”. Here too, the city is 
perceived in monochrome. Despite 
the crowds and the skyscrapers, Kaf- 
ka’'s imaginary New York does not ex- 
ist except in terms of Prague, which 
he uses as a kind of blueprint. 
The camouflaged 
city 
Many cities in literature are inspired 
by real cities whose names are 
‘changed, perhaps because the 
author wishes to eliminate local 
colour, to conceal the true identity 
of the characters, or simply wants a 
better-sounding name than the origi- 
nal, But even under its new name, 
the real city can still be seen beneath 
the camouflage. Vetusta, the setting 
of The Regent's Wife by the Spanish 
novelist Clarin {Leopoldo Alas) is a 
faithful reflection of the Spanish city 
of Qviede. What is most memorable 
in Clarins description is the sense of 
space which can be felt from the very 
first chapter in which a priest climbs 
to the top of the cathedral bell-tower 
to spy through a telescope on the 
comings and goings of parishioners 
who reveal their sins to him in the 
confessional. 
The little town of Illiers near 
Chartres (south of Paris) was immor- 
talized as Combray in Proust's A la 
recherche du temps perdu and is 
now officially known as Illiers- 
Combray. The fictional town is so 
skilfully superimposed on the real 
town that a visitor to llliers who has

### 87744: Imaginary cities

read Swann's Way, the first part of 
Proust's great novel, has no difficulty 
in recognizing the setting of the prin- 
cipal scenes—Aunt Léonie’s house, 
the church of Saint-Hilaire, the main 
square, the chateau of Tansonville, 
the Pré Catelan. Stone by stone, 
street by street, liliers coincides ex- 
actly with Combray. 
The imaginary city 
A city cannot be created out of noth- 
ing. The ostensibly imaginary cities 
of literature are actually an amalgam 
of fragments of cities which the 
writer has known. As a rule it is im- 
possible to identify these hetero- 
geneous monsters. 
The mythical city of Santa Maria is 
a thread that runs through the work 
of the Uruguayan writer Juan Carlos 
Onetti and gives it unity and univer- 
sality. The city is never far from the 
thoughts of his characters. As a 
result of Onetti's desire to eliminate 
anecdotal details and references to 
existing places, Santa Maria could be 
any provincial city on the banks of a 
river, with low-roofed houses, a 
resplendent new hotel and a plaza 
bordered with arcades. Argentine 
and Uruguayan readers may be 
tempted to identify the river as the 
 
Above, Metropolis 
(1916) by George Grosz. 
Below, The Thermae of Titus, 
engraving by Piranesi (18th century). 
Rio de la Plata and Santa Maria as the 
city of Colonia, if they try to relate 
Onetti's laconic, even contradictory, 
indications to their own memories 
and experiences. 
In Onetti’s novel A Brief Life, for ex- 
ample, there is a reference to “a 
broad river, a narrow river, a solitary 
and threatening river, in which clouds 
heavy with torment were reflected". 
   
These contradictions introduce an 
element of ambiguity which allows 
the river of Santa Maria to be identi- 
fied with all rivers. The descriptions 
of the city are always very general 
and appeal to other senses than that 
of sight, as if to blur the contours of 
objects: “It came to me like a per- 
. fume, an aroma that | had long ago 
inhaled in a confused impression of 
streets, compost, ivy, an image of a 
tennis court and of a lantern sway- 
ing at the corner of a street.” 
As "a city hemmed in by a river and 
a colony of Swiss settlers”, Santa 
Maria seems to have precise bound: 
aries, unlike Gabriel Garcia Marquez's 
fictional Colombian township of 
Macondo, which is presented at 
different times as a large hacienda, 
a village or an entire kingdom, with 
no temporal continuity. Since there 
is no single narrator, Macondo ap- 
pears as each person sees it or wish- 
es to see it. 
In Garcia Méarquez’s novel One 
Hundred Years of Solitude, the logic 
of space and time is often violated 
as near merges with far, the order of 
events is mixed up, and the passage 
of time is slowed down or speeded 
up. And in the story entitled Big Ma- 
ma’s Funeral, where the Supreme

REFLECTIONS 
‘Pontiff, on his way to the funeral in 
Macondo, glides in his fong black 
gondola past the famous sights of 
Rome (mixed up with those of 
Venice), Garcfa Marquez abruptly 
writes: ‘At dusk the resonant peal- 
ing of St. Peter's Basilica mingled 
with the cracked tinklings of Macon- 
do.” But the Pope does not arrive in 
Macondo in his gondola, but in a ca- 
noe loaded with yuccas, bananas and 
chickens. 
The township of Comala in the 
works of the Mexican writer Juan Rul- 
fo, and the City of the Immortals in 
the works of Jorge Luis Borges, are 
two sides of the same coin, nightmar- 
ish places inhabited by the dead or 
by those unable to die. 
Comala is a place of memory and 
dreams, haunted by all those who 
have lived there and by the dreams 
they have dreamed. To read Rulfo's 
Pedro Paramo is to be assailed by im- 
ages of the ghost towns of the Ameri- 
can West. Abandoned like the mines 
which made them rich, they have the 
surrealist appeal of Giorgio de Chiri- 
co's paintings of plazas where there 
is no human presence, only marble 
statues or tailor's dummies. The 
equally uninhabited City of the Im- 
mortals described by Borges in his 
story The Immortal is situated on the 
banks of a river which grants immor- 
tality to those who bathe in it. 
The narrator, a Roman tribune ar- 
riving at the end of a leng and ardu- 
ous journey, like that of the mythical 
heroes Gilgamesh and Achilles, 
describes his first contact with the 
city in the following terms: “I began 
to glimpse capitals and astragals, tri- 
angular pediments and vaults, con- 
fused pageants of granite and 
marble.” This architecture, arranged 
in a disorderly and chaotic manner 
in a labyrinthine structure, consti- 
  
  
pa 
     
Above, The Great Metaphysician 
(1949), by Giorgio de Chirico. 
Below, View of the Ideal City. 
Italian, 15th century. 
tutes the city: “In the palace | imper- 
fectly explored, the architecture 
lacked any finality.” 
This boundless, chaotic, disorder- 
ly, unpopulated city appears to be the 
work of immortal builders or dement- 
ed gods. With its magnificent ar- 
chitecture completely divorced from 
anything on a human scale, it evokes 
the precincts of a Roman forum, the 
classical fantasies of a Piranesi en- 
graving, or cities like Petra which 
have been abandoned for unknown 
reasons. 
Borges has said that his vision of 
the City of the Immortals was in- 
spired by the tombs in La Recoleta 
cemetery in Buenos Aires, small tem- 
  
ples that bear no resemblance, if only 
because of their scale, to the place 
which the reader sees through the 
eyes of the Roman tribune: “This City 
(1 thought) is so horrible that its mere 
existence and perdurance, though in 
the midst of a secret desert, con- 
taminates the past and the future 
and in some way even jeopardizes 
the stars.” 
A dusty and sordid city-cemetery, 
an infinite marmoreal cCity- 
cemetery—two mythical and equal- 
ly monstrous places. 
The invisible city 
In invisible Cities, the Italian writer 
Italo Calvino adopts a different ap- 
    
 
  
  
  
proach to the city, which becomes 
the protagonist of his story. The book 
is meant to be an account of the trav- 
els of the Venetian explorer Marco 
Polo to the cities of Kublai Khan's 
empire. The exoticism of the narra- 
tive can be felt in the very names of 
the cities—Maurilia, Despina, Zirma, 
Tamara—descriptions of which, al- 
ternating with meetings between 
Marco Polo and the Great Khan and 
the asides of Calvino himself, dis- 
orientate the reader who has the im- 
pression that this is a travel book 
rather than a work of fiction. In this 
way the reader is gradually made to 
understand that these apparently re- 
mote and fabulous cities are actual 
ly the cities of our everyday lives. 
After Marco Polo has described at 
length the many cities of the Empire, 
the Khan asks him to speak of one 
city which he has not yet 
mentioned—Venice, And Marco Polo 
replies: “Every time | describe a city 
| say something about Venice. To dis- 
tinguish the qualities of other cities, 
I must start from a city that never 
changes. For me that city is Venice.” 
In. point of fact, Marco Polo's 
Venice is San Remo, which Calvino 
admits is the basis of all the cities 
described in his books: “I cannot 
overlook the native and familiar land- 
scape. San Remo is the backcloth in 
all my books...especially in many of 
my invisible cities.” 
For each of these writers it is, af- 
ter all, their native city, the city they 
know, which provides the foundation 
for the cities of their imagination— 
a Platonic archetype fleshed out with 
endless variations to shape cities 
which are always new but always 
similar. n

Chicago August 1961. 
Gene Ammons (tenor sax.), Sonny 
Stitt (alto sax.), John Houston 
(piano), Buster Williams (bass), 
George Brown (drums). 
1 CD. Verve 837 440-2. 
Ammons and Stitt, partners in 
the early 1960s, counterbalance, 
or rather counterattack, one 
another in a battle of giants. 
Ammons’ earthy, hard-driving 
sound, typical of the blues of his 
hometown of Chicago, is set 
against Stitt’s highly-strung East 
coast virtuosity, bringing new life 
to “There is No Greater Love” and 
“Blues Up and Down". Solid 
mainstream jazz brought up to 
date with a rare swing. 
George Coleman. 
Manhattan Panorama. 
Coleman (tenor sax.), Jamil Nasser 
(bass), Harold Mabern (piano), Idris 
Muhammad (drums). 
1 CD. Theresa TRCD 120. 
Apart from the "Mayor Koch” 
track, this set was recorded live 
at the Village Vanguard in New 
York, and the warm and 
welcoming atmosphere of the 
club pervades the music. 
Coleman, one of the best 
saxophonists in the world, creates 
direct, energetic music with no 
frills but packed with innovative 
ideas. He sings with gusto in 
"Mayor Koch”, his own 
composition; launches into the 
“New York Suite" (including 
“I Love New York”, “Manhattan”, 
“How About You?'", “Harlem 
Nocturne” and “Autumn in New 
York") in a mode reminiscent of 
late 1960s jazz, and paints his 
“El Barrio” in vibrant Latin 
colours. 
HB FOLKLORE 
Chine: L’Art du Qin (‘‘China: The 
Art of the Qin’). Li Xiangting. 
1 CD. Ocora C 560001. 
This recording was made for 
Radio France in February 1990, Li 
Xiangting is the greatest living 
exponent of the qin, a 7-stringed 
zither. The poetry in these subtle 
and refined compositions from the 
traditional Chinese repertoire is 
evident from their titles, such as 
“Three Variations on the Plum- 
Flower”, “Autumn Declaiming on 
the Great Wall” and “Flowing 
Waters". The ear is gradually 
captivated by the tiny nuances of 
phrasing which lead into a 
dreamlike universe that is difficult 
to leave. 
Anthology of the Music of Niger, 
1 CD. Ocora C 559056. 
Niger, on the fringes of the 
Sahara, is influenced by the music 
of the desert. This recording 
brings together the music of the 
Zerma, Songhai, Hausa, Galla, 
Tuareg and Fulani peoples. The 
sudden changes of voice, 
surprising to the unprepared 
listener, create a dramatic mood 
that suits the songs of praise or 
exorcism common to the music of 
Niger. Detailed accompanying 
notes are provided by Tolia 
Nikiprowetzky, an 
ethnomusicologist specializing in 
West Africa. 
Mali. La Nuit des Griots (‘'Mali. 
The Night of the Griots"). 
Ousmane Sacko and Yakaré

2 cassettes. Ocora 4558662/3. 
This is a recording of a concert 
by the guitarist Ousmane Sacko 
and his wife, the singer Yakaré 
Diabate, at Le Havre, France, on 8 
January 1983. They are both 
griots who belong to the tradition 
of the Mandingo people of West 
Africa. Some songs from the 
traditional repertoire praise the jali 
(griots), while others such as 
“Apollo” and *'Saheli Véri” deal 
with more contemporary themes 
and social problems. Sacko and 
Diabate are backed by Boubakar 
Diabate on the kora and Brahima 
Kouyate on the balafon. A great 
art form, which the non-African 
world is only just beginning to 
discover. 
EH POPULAR MUSIC 
Lecuona Cuban Boys. 
1 CD. Calig CAL 50586. 
A long-awaited reissue on a 
German label of tracks recorded 
between 1935 and 1937. The 
Lecuona Cuban Boys, formed in 
the 1930s by the composer 
Ernesto Lecuona, were important 
ambassadors for Cuban music in 
Europe and America. The band 
concentrates particularly on 
rumba and conga, the most 
popular dances of that time. The 
arrangements and the old- 
fashioned vocal style evoke pre- 
war films. As the expression of 
the spirit of an era of Cuban 
music of which few recordings 
exist, this is a document of great 
value. 
Ray Lema. Nangadeef. 
1 CD. Mango CIDM 1000. 
An excellent example of African 
cross-fertilization. Lema’s 
arrangements, backed by fine 
session musicians, range from 
reggae (“Hal 99") to Oriental 
(“Pongi™), to soca or Zairian 
rumba ("Moni Mambo”) or to 
house music ("Boye Te). 
“Orchestra of the Forest", 
evoking the atmosphere of the 
African forest, and the brilliant 
saxophone playing of Courtney 
Pine on “What We Need”, are 
particularly outstanding. 
Various Reggae Refreshers. 
The Wailers, Black Uhuru, Gregory 
Isaacs, Stee! Pulse, Third World, 
Jimmy Cliff, Toots and the 
Maytals, Burning Spear. 
1 CD. Mango 846 269-2. 
This compilation of tracks by 
great Jamaican bands expresses 
all the fighting spirit of reggae, as 
in "Hard Road tc Travel”, Burnin’ 
and Lootin® "', "Tribal War” and 
“War in Babylon”. The regular 
strong accent on the backbeat 
makes reggae rather monotonous 
rhythmically, but its lasting 
success with young people 
everywhere shows that they 
wholeheartedly identify with its 
message and with its charismatic 
musicians.

HB CLASSICAL 
Gyorgy Ligeti. 
Requiem. Aventures. Nouvelles 
Aventures. (‘‘Requiem. 
Adventures. New Adventures.") 
1 CD. Wergo 60 045-50. 
An exceptionally fine recording 
of 3 of the most beautiful works 
by the Hungarian avant-garde 
composer, Ligeti, who divides his 
time between Vienna, where he 
lives, and Hamburg, where he 
teaches, is obviously influenced 
by the Viennese school, especially 
by Alban Berg. His austere and 
difficult music here gives pre- 
eminence to the voice. In the 
accompanying notes he describes 
his approach tc musical 
composition in Aventures and 
Nouvelles Aventures: “the ‘text’, 
written in phonetic lettering, was 
not drafted before the 
composition, but developed at the 
same time as the music; that is to 
say, that as pure composition of 
spoken sound, it is itself music. 
The point of departure for the 
spoken sound composition was an 
idea of the interrelations in 
emotional behavicur, and not an 
abstract plan of construction.” 
Benjamin Britten. Peter Grimes. 
Peter Pears, Covent Garden 
orchestra and choruses conducted 
by Benjamin Britten. 
3 CDs. Decca 414 577-2, 
Some musicians sum up an 
entire culture: Bartok in Hungary, 
Sibelius in Scandinavia and Britten 
in England, where classical music 
had been dormant since Purcell 
and Handel. Britten's opera Peter 
Grimes, which launched his career 
in 1945, was followed by such 
works as The Rape of Lucretia 
(19486) sung by the young 
Kathleen Ferrier, Billy Budd 
(1951), The Turn of the Screw 
(1954) and Death in Venice 
(1973), his last opera. Although 
the tenor Peter Pears was 
Britten's lifelong friend and 
principal interpreter, his version 
does not compare with that of 
Jon Vickers, conducted by Colin 
Davis. Decca’s efforts to reissue 
the bulk of Britten's work are 
nevertheless to be applauded. 
Heitor Villa-Lobos. 
Concerto for Guitar and Small 
Orchestra. 
Narciso Yepes (guitar), London 
Symphony Orchestra conducted 
by Garcia Navarro. 
1 CD. D.G. 423 700-2. 
This late work, dating from 
1951 (Villa-Lobos died in 1959), is 
a superb synthesis of Brazilian 
folklore and the neo-classical 
music of the twentieth century. 
The great Brazilian composer's 
spellbinding magic, well ahead of 
its time, conjures up the kind of 
cultural syncretism that is so 
fashionable today.

### 87745: The Rock-hewn churches of Cappadocia

>) world heritage 
The rock-hewn churches of Cappadocia 
T.- setting for the rock-hewn 
churches of Cappadocia in Turkey is, 
literally, like nothing on earth. At its 
bleakest, it could be a moonscape. 
At its most fantastic, it could be a sur- 
realist scene imagined by Salvador 
Dali. 
Its origin was dramatic: a volcan- 
ic eruption millions of years ago that 
covered the terrain with lava. But its 
most bizarre features are due to a 
centuries-long process of erosion 
that has etched the volcanic rock and 
ash into steep-sided valleys, some- 
times white, sometimes yellow, 
sometimes slashed with horizontal 
bars of different colours. 
Here and there, where isolated lay- 
ers or fragments of volcanic rock 
proved more resistant to erosion 
than the surrounding ash, nature has 
produced shapes stranger than any 
human sculpture. Singly and in 
groups, there rise from the valley 
floors rock cones, needles and what 
the local people call “fairy chim- 
neys", slim pillars topped by horizon- 
tal slabs that sit on them like hats. 
Yet what is visible in the valleys of 
Goreme and Zelve is less strange 
than what is hidden: Byzantine 
churches with frescoes, flat ceilings, 
domes or vaulting, tunnelled into the 
cliff faces or hollowed out of rock 
cones by men who used the friable 
“tuff as material to reverse the nor- 
mal sequence of architecture, taking 
away rather than adding on, carving 
out rather than building up. 
Christianity came early to Cap- 
padocia, long before the Emperor 
Constantine made Byzantium into 
“New Rome” in 330 AD. For centu- 
ries it flourished, and Asia Minor 
abounded in Christian bisheprics. 
When Constantinople became Istan- 
bul, the capital of the Ottoman Em- 
pire, in the fifteenth century, the 
most recent churches in the Géreme 
valley were already 300 years old. 
The oldest churches probably date 
from the seventh century, but when 
the first Christian inhabitants arrived 
can only be guessed at. Possibly, 
they were hermits who hollowed their 
cells from the soft rocks. It is possi- 
ble, too, that the mushroom shapes 
of the “fairy chimneys" attracted the 
“stylites”, those early Christian pole- 
squatters who spent their days on 
the top of pillars, to prayer on their 
insecure summits. 
by Antony Brock 
However, the variety of styles in 
the rock-hewn churches indicates 
that they were constructed at differ- 
ent dates by different waves of 
migrants. Most of the churches ap- 
parently belong to the later Byzantine 
period, when the new faith of Con- 
stantine had become the old religion, 
when the Church he made respecta- 
ble had become in many instances 
a persecuted sect. 
 
  
The wild regions of Cappadocia 
offered natural refuges for monks 
who wanted to live in peace in self- 
supporting communities. Where 
these developed, they attracted 
peasants to live around them, some 
in cave dwellings like those in G&- 
reme, which riddle the cliffs like holes 
in some gigantic Gruyére cheese. 
Should armies come to their remote 
havens, monks and peasants had a 
second line of retreat-——underground. 
The “tuff” could be excavated down- 
wards as well as laterally, and there 
are some twenty underground 
refuges in the Goreme area extend- 
ing to seven or eight levels below the 
surface. Small entrances and narrow 
connecting passages which allow 
only one crouching invader to pass 
at a time have made those who used 
these pre-atomic age fall-out shelters 
secure from all except starvation 
through long siege. 
In one of these underground vil- 
lages is a Christian chapel with a 
stone altar and carved crbss, but

### 87745: The Rock-hewn churches of Cappadocia

  
scholars cannot agree whether reli- 
gious settlers created them or sim- 
ply took over the refuges of earlier 
communities. Whatever the case, it 
takes no imaginative leap to see the 
church architects as not only moti- 
vated by the easily workable nature 
of the rock but also by the opportu- 
nity it gave to keep the mysteries of 
their religion away from hostile eyes. 
Perhaps they saw in the rock-hewn 
churches a link to the catacombs of 
Rome and the reputation of the Ear- 
ly Christians as “gens lucifugera’”— 
the people who flee the light. 
They left behind a veritable muse- 
um of Byzantine styles. For example, 
in the Elmali or Apple church, one of 
seven in Géreme and the Zelve val- 
ley selected for priority restoration 
work, two layers of decoration can be 
seen. The first, painted directly on to 
the rock, is made up of crosses and 
geometrical patterns and probably 
dates from the iconoclastic (literally 
“image-breaking”) period before 
about 850 AD when the representa- 
tion of living forms was forbidden. 
The second, painted on to plaster, 
shows a Pantocrator, or Christ the 
Almighty, cn the central cupola, with 
other frescoes depicting scenes from 
the life of Christ in the style of the 
eleventh century. 
Cross-domed like the Elmali church 
is the eleventh-century Karanlik, or 
Dark church, which gets its name 
from the deep blue-grey of its fres- 
coes, still well-preserved and illustrat- 
ing the sophisticated style of 
Constantinople. In other churches of 
the valley, like the church of the Vir- 
gin Mary, the style is more provincial, 
showing the hand of local artists. 
The barrel-vaulted E! Nazar church 
is an example of a cruciform struc- 
ture in which the main apse joins 
directly on to a central square 
without an intervening east cross- 
arm. Unlike the Dark church, which 
includes a refectory and a dormito- 
ry, and many of the others, it is not 
connected with a monastery but set 
apart in an isolated tent-shaped rock 
cone. 
Over the centuries, the Christians 
left their settlements and the 
churches were neglected until the 
1920s and 1230s, when the writings 
of a French priest, Fr. Guillaume de 
  
Jerphanion, drew the attention of 
scholars and tourists. What had been 
religious communities became farm- 
ing communities. Peasant families 
made their homes in the caves, many 
of them continuing to live there un- 
til recent years. In at least cne case, 
this secularization had an advantage: 
the frescoes of the Dovecote church 
in Cavusin were well preserved be- 
cause the church was sealed-up un- 
til 1964 so that pigeons, valued in 
the area for their guano, could be 
" keptin it. But the Dovecote church, 
like the Carikli, or Sandal church of 
Goreme, has been brutally exposed 
to the elements. In both cases the 
narthex, where gnce congregations 
stood in worship, has crumbled away 
and the modern tourist climbs a me- 
tal staircase to enter. 
For the delicate rock which made 
the churches possible and the ero- 
sion which gave them their unique 
shapes are today the chief threats to 
their continued existence. Rain has 
soaked into the decorated surfaces, 
fading colours and flaking paintwork. 
More dangerously, it has seeped into 
cracks, then frozen and fissured the 
structures. Goreme is in a seismic 
zone and it was thanks to an earth- 
slip that the church of St. fohn the 
Baptist was discovered as late as 
1957. But tremors have destabilized 
more churches than they have rev- 
ealed. Some churches have been to- 
tally destroyed, leaving only traces 
behind. 
These threats explain why Unesco 
has not only put the rock-hewn 
churches onto its list of monuments 
belonging to the cultural heritage of 
all mankind, but has launched an in- 
ternational appeal to save them for 
future generations. The perils to body 
or soul which drove the Christian 
communities of Cappadocia into 
these bleak valleys have long since 
faded. The men who conceived the 
churches, hewed them from the liv- 
ing rock and lovingly decorated them 
have been forgotten for centuries. 
But their faith and their artistry creat- 
ed something unique, that still hush- 
es a group of modern visitors into 
silent wonder, | |

LETTERS 
TO THE EDITOR 
HB An issue on death? 
Your extremely interesting issue 
on Sacred Places led me to think 
about the different ways in which 
people come to terms with death. 
How about an issue of the 
Courier on different customs and 
attitudes towards death? 
Please accept my 
congratulations on the 
quality of your magazine. 
Cédric Deharbieux 
Saint-Georges-d'Orques 
(France) 
We are considering this as a future 
theme. Editor 
HM Unlovely Hartung 
The theme of your December 
1990 issue was one of the most 
edifying subjects in human 
culture: beauty. You introduced 
the theme by astutely showing a 
photo of Marlene Dietrich side by 
side with a superb profile of 
Nerfertiti. Then came a series of 
images and texts which 1 found 
quite admirable. 
Then, as if you had been 
leading us up the garden path, 
you closed the thematic part of 
the issue by throwing at us a 
photo (on page 44) of a work by 
Hans Hartung that is the negation 
of all you claim to like on the 
preceding pages. This clumsily 
executed composition with the 
colours of a decomposing fish is a 
stupid work which brings shame 
on humanity. It is an image of 
contemporary chaos, without 
either hope or quality. 
Beauty is irrelevant where such 
a picture is concerned. 
Pierre Lohner 
Art teacher 
Paris 
The choice of this painting by Hartung 
—at the end of a brief survey of art 
from Fra Angelico to the 20th 
century—illustrates how modern art 
broke away from the traditional concept 
of the beautiful. Your point of view 
shows something that we wanted to 
emphasize in our issue—that a feeling 
for beauty is both deep and relative. 
Editor 
  
   
HB Towards the same ideal 
| cannot decipher Arab calligraphy 
and | do not know what 
feelings guided the hand of 
Mr. Hassan Massoudy when he 
drew the magnificent calligraphic 
design which appears on 
page 39 of your December 1990 
issue devoted to beauty. 
However, as | look at it through 
the prism of my Western 
culture | dream of an irresistible 
movement in which man is 
freed from the chains of 
gravity and soars towards an 
infinity radiant with peace and 
serenity. 
If | had to choose a work of 
French literature to illustrate with 
this calligram, it would be 
Victor Hugo's poem “Plein ciel" 
from his collection La Légende 
des siécles, which appeared over 
a century ago. In this poem 
Hugo already brilliantly foresaw 
man freed from gravity 
and journeying in the infinity of 
space. 
Is it possible that our cultures, 
different though they are, are 
converging on the same ideal? 
I look forward to reading the 
Courier each month with 
impatience and curiosity.

HM Cars for hire 
| enjoyed reading your issue on 
the Myth of the Automobile 
(October 1990) but | was sorry 
there was nothing in it about 
the use of cars in towns and 
cities. All major towns and cities 
today are choked with traffic. 
Driving around in search of a 
parking place wastes time and 
increases pollution. Who will have 
the courage tc tackle this 
problem? 
It has been suggested that 
traffic in towns should be 
prohibited, except for priority 
vehicles such as ambulances 
and fire engines, and that self- 
drive vehicles for hire should be 
made available. Ideally such 
vehicles would be battery- 
powered, would function with a 
magnetic card and be paid for 
according to the length of time 
for which they were hired. 
After use the vehicle would be 
returned to a special station—the 
only place where the driver could 
get his or her card back. 
Microchip technology is so 
sophisticated today that this 
solution would surely be feasible. 
In one European country 
(Greece?) efforts have been made 
to control traffic by allowing only 
cars with even registration 
numbers to be used on even days 
of the week, and vice versa. 
Perhaps this system would be 
more difficult to apply because it 
requires too many controls... 
Clearly public transport must be 
kept. But would it not be possible 
to simplify the payment system 
(for example, by charging a single 
fare in all medium-sized French 
towns) or even to make public 
transport free?

Hl The notation of figures 
Bravo for your issue “A 
Mathematical Mystery Tour” 
{November 1989). 
However, what | should really 
have liked to see was a table 
showing the evolution of the 
notation of figures from the 
Indians to the Arabs and in the 
Middle Ages. 
Could you help me to find this 
information? 
Henri Croiset 
Sanary 
(France) 
The Histoire universelle des chiffres by 
the Moroccan historian Georges Ifrah 
(Paris, 1981) provides information of 
the kind you are looking for. Editor
