WEAVING CLOUD BROCADE 
These weavers are practising their craft on modern reconstitutions 
of a Chinese loom dating from the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). 
Looms of this type, which represent an advanced form of weaving technology, were 
used to produce intricately figured fabrics, notably the multi-coloured brocaded silks 
with floral and cloud motifs which are known as yunjin (“cloud brocade”). 
While the weaver operates the loom by pressing treadles with his feet, 
an operative seated on top of the machine creates the pattern. 
Automation of this technique has proved difficult, 
and time-honoured methods are still used to produce this kind of brocade.

The origins of many of the things the modern world 
takes for granted—from paper to porcelain, from 
mechanical clocks to the harness, steel-making and 
the extraction of petroleum and natural gas—can be 
traced to ancient China. Although for centuries 
these and many other achievements of Chinese 
inventiveness were forgotten or veiled in obscurity, 
in recent years the nature of the Chinese scientific 
genius has become increasingly appreciated. This is 
largely due to one of the outstanding intellectual 
ventures of our time, the research and writings of 
Dr. Joseph Needham of Cambridge University, 
who has spent over half a century investigating the 
history of Chinese science and technology. The 
results of Dr. Needham’s investigations, and those 
of his colleagues at the Needham Research Institute 
in Cambridge, are being published in a monumental 
work, Science and Civilisation in China, which will 
be complete in 25 volumes. (Fifteen have so far 
appeared or are passing through the press.) 
With Dr. Needham’s authorization, an 
American science writer, Robert K.G. Temple, has 
written a book entitled China, Land of Discovery 
and Invention which attempts to make this 
scholarly research accessible to the general reader. 
All the articles in this issue have been extracted 
from Mr. Temple’s book, with the kind permission 
of the publishers. The issue falls into 3 parts: a brief 
introduction in which Temple describes the genesis 
and importance of Needham’s work; a short text in 
which Needham sets the question of scientific and 
technological activity in a social and economic 
context; and descriptions of over 20 discoveries and 
inventions. (Most of the descriptions have been 
abridged.) A celebration of the Chinese scientific 
genius, this issue may also lead readers to speculate 
about the surprises that will be revealed when the 
history of science and technology in other great 
world civilizations comes to be written.

### 81670: The Chinese scientific genius

The Chinese BY ROBERT K. G. TEMPLE 
scientific genius 
inventions and discoveries upon 
which the “modern world” rests 
come from China. 
Without the importation from China of 
nautical and navigational improvements 
such’ as ships’ rudders, the compass and 
multiple masts, the great European 
Voyages of Discovery could never have 
been undertaken. Columbus would not 
have sailed to America, and Europeans 
would never have established colonial 
empires. 
Without the importation from China of 
the stirrup, to enable them to stay on 
horseback, knights of old would never 
have ridden in their shining armour to aid 
damsels in distress; there would have been 
no Age of Chivalry. And without the 
importation from China of guns and gun- 
powder, the knights would not have been 
knocked from their horses by bullets 
which pierced the armour, bringing the 
Age of Chivalry to an end. 
Without the importation from China of 
paper and printing, Europe would have 
Pe more than half of the basic continued for much longer to copy books 
by hand. Literacy would not have become 
so widespread. 
Johann Gutenberg did not invent mov- 
able type. It was invented in China. Wil- 
liam Harvey did not discover the circula- 
tion of the blood in the body. It was 
discovered—or rather, always assumed— 
in China. Isaac Newton was not the first to 
discover his First Law of Motion. It was 
discovered in China. 
These myths and many others are shat- 
tered by our discovery of the true Chinese 
origins of many of the things, all around 
us, which we take for granted. It is exciting 
to realize that the East and the West are 
not as far apart in spirit or in fact as most of 
us have been led, by appearances, to be- 
lieve, and that the East and the West are 
already combined in a synthesis so power- 
ful and so profound that it is all-perva- 
ding. Within this synthesis we live our 
daily lives, and from it there is no escape. 
The modern world is a combination of 
Eastern and Western ingredients which 
are inextricably fused.

Beijing hasvhad an astronomical 
observatory since the Qin Dynasty 
(3rd century BC). 
The discovery of this truth is a result of 
incidents in the life of the distinguished 
British scholar Dr Joseph Needham, au- 
thor of the great work Science and Civi- 
lisation in China. In 1937, aged thirty- 
seven, Needham was one of the youngest 
Fellows of the Royal Society and a 
biochemist of considerable distinction at 
Cambridge. He had already published 
many books, including the definitive his- 
tory of embryology. One day he met and 
befriended some Chinese students, in par- 
ticular a young woman from Nanjing 
named Lu Gwei-djen, whose father had 


### 81670: The Chinese scientific genius

passed on to her his unusually profound 
knowledge of the history of Chinese sci- 
ence. Needham began to hear tales of how 
the Chinese had been the true discoverers 
of this and that important thing, and at 
first he could not believe it. But as he 
looked further into it, evidence began to 
come to light from Chinese texts, hastily 
translated by his new friends for his 
benefit. 
Needham became obsessed with this 
subject, as he freely admits. Not knowing 
a word of Chinese, he set about learning 
the language. In 1942 he was sent to China 
for several years as Scientific Counsellor 
to the British Embassy in Chongqing. He 
was able to travel all over China, learn the 
language thoroughly, meet men of science 
everywhere he went, and accumulate vast 
quantities of priceless ancient Chinese 
books on science. After the War, 
Needham became Unesco’s first Assistant 
Director General for the natural sciences. 
In July 1946 Needham stated in a lec- 
ture to the China Society in London that: 
“What is really very badly needed is a 
proper book on the history of science and 
technology in China, especially with re- 
ference to the social and economic back- 
ground of Chinese life, Such a book would 
be by no means academic, but would have 
a wide bearing on the general history of 
thought and ideas.” 
Needham, now back in Cambridge, 
went ahead and wrote—and is still writ- 
ing—the very work which he envisaged, 
except for the fact that it is, indeed, very 
academic. It is in fact much easier to read 
than it looks, but of course is very expen-

The earliest surviving Chinese notations 
are records of divination incised over 
3,000 years ago on “oracle bones” 
(tortoise shells or the shoulder blades of 
animals). Some oracle bones unearthed 
near Anyang are inscribed with 
astronomical and calendrical 
information such as the names of stars 
and data about solar and lunar eclipses. 
Left, two Anyang oracle bones bearing 
sive, and even many libraries cannot 
afford it. Needham, however, has never 
lost his early vision of a work which was 
“by no means academic”; he has always 
wanted to make his work more accessible 
in every possible way. Therefore, when I 
approached him in 1984 with the sugges- 
tion that I write a popular book for the 
general reader based upon his half cen- 
tury’s labours, he agreed more readily 
than at the time I could understand. It is 
now clear that this was a project which he 
had long envisaged, and which he felt he 
could no longer hope to accomplish 
himself. 
In the 1946 lecture which was so 
prophetic of his future activities, Dr. 
Needham went on to say: “I personally 
believe that all Westerners, all people be- 
longing to the Euro-American civiliza- 
tion, are subconsciously inclined to con- 
gratulate themselves, feeling with some 
self-satisfaction that, after all, it was 
Europe and its extension into the 
Americas which developed modern 
science and technology. In the same way I 
think that all my Asian friends are subcon- 
sciously inclined to a certain anxiety about 
this matter, because their civilization did 
not, in fact, develop modern science and 
technology.” 
We need to set this matter right, from 
both ends. And I can think of no better 
single case than the lesson to be drawn 
from the history of agriculture. We should 
take to heart the astonishing and disturb- 
ing fact that the European agricultural 
revolution, which laid the basis for the 
Industrial Revolution, came about only 
because of the importation of Chinese 
ideas and inventions. The growing of 
crops in rows, intensive hoeing of weeds, 
the “modern” seed drill, the iron plough, 
the moldboard to turn the ploughed soil,

and efficient harnesses were all imported 
from China. Before the arrival from China 
of the trace harness and the collar harness, 
Westerners choked their horses with 
straps round their throats. 
Although ancient Italy could produce 
plenty of grain, it could not be transported 
overland to Rome for lack of satisfactory 
harnesses. Rome depended on shipments 
of grain by sea from places like Egypt. As 
for sowing methods—probably over half 


### 81670: The Chinese scientific genius

of Europe’s seed was wasted every year 
before the Chinese idea of the seed drill 
came to the attention of Europeans. 
Countless millions of farmers broke their 
backs and their spirits by ploughing with 
ridiculously poor ploughs, while for two 
thousand years the Chinese were enjoying 
their relatively effortless method. 
It would be better if the nations and the 
peoples of the world had a clearer under- 
standing of each other, allowing the men- 
tal chasm between East and West to be 
bridged. After all they are, and have been 
for several centuries, intimate partners in 
the business of building a world civiliza- 
tion. The technological world of today is a 
product of both East and West to an extent 
which until recently no one had ever im- 
agined. It is now time for the Chinese 
contribution to be recognized and ack- 
nowledged, by East and West alike. |

### 81671: Precursors of modern science

  
of modern science 
BY JOSEPH NEEDHAM 
HE extraordinary inventiveness, and 
insight into nature, of ancient and 
medieval China raises two fun- 
damental questions. First, why should the 
Chinese have been so far in advance of 
other civilizations; and second, why aren’t 
they now centuries ahead of the rest of the 
world? We think it was a matter of the 
very different social and economic sys- 
tems in China and the West. Modern sci- 
ence arose only in Europe in the seven- 
teenth century when the best method of 
discovery was itself discovered; but the 
discoveries and inventions made then and 
thereafter depended in so many cases on 
centuries of previous Chinese progress in 
science, technology and medicine. 
The English philosopher Francis Bacon 
(1561-1626) selected three inventions, 
paper and printing, gunpowder, and the 
magnetic compass, which had done more, 
he thought, than any religious conviction, 
or any astrological influence, or any con- 
queror’s achievements, to transform com- 
pletely the modern world and mark it off 
from Antiquity and the Middle Ages. He 
regarded the origins of these inventions as 
“obscure and inglorious” and he died 
without ever knowing that all of them 
were Chinese. We have done our best to 
put this record straight. 
Chauvinistic Westerners, of course, al- 
ways try to minimize the indebtedness of 
Europe to China in Antiquity and the 
Left, a model reconstructed after a Tang 
Dynasty (7th century) original, of a “/i- 
counter” or device for measuring 
distance, The counter was constructed in 
such a way that, asit moved along the 
road, one of the 2 drummers would beat 
thedrumateach i, an ancient Chinese 
distance unit corresponding to half a 
kilometre. 
Middle Ages, but often the circumstantial 
evidence is compelling. For example the 
first blast furnaces for cast iron, now 
known to be Scandinavian of the late 
eighth century AD, are of closely similar 
form to those of the previous century in 
China; while as late as the seventeenth 
century al] the magnetic compasses of sur- 
veyors and astronomers pointed south, 
not north, just as the compasses of China 
had always done. In many cases, however, 
we cannot as yet detect the capillary chan- 
nels through which knowledge was con- 
veyed from East to West. Nevertheless we 
have always adopted the very reasonable 
assumption that the longer the time elaps- 
ing between the appearance of a discovery 
or invention in one part of the world, and 
its appearance later on in some other part 
of the world far away, the less likely is it 
that the new thing was independently in- 
vented or discovered. 
But all these things being agreed, a for- 
midable question then presents itself. If 
the Chinese were so advanced in Antiqui- 
ty and the Middle Ages, how was it that 
the Scientific Revolution, the coming of 
modern science into the world, happened 
only in Europe? 
The fact is that in the seventeenth cen- 
tury we have to face a package deal; the 
Scientific Revolution was accompanied 
both by the Protestant Reformation and 
by the rise of capitalism, the ascendancy of 
the entrepreneurial bourgeoisie. Distinc- 
tively modern science, which then de- 
veloped, was a mathematization of 
hypotheses about nature, combined with 
relentless experimentation. The sciences 
of all the ancient and medieval worlds had 
had an indelibly ethnic stamp, but now 
nature was addressed for the first time ina 
universal and international language, the 
precise and quantitative idiom of mathe-

matics, a tongue which every man and 
woman, irrespective of colour, creed or 
race, can use and master if given the proper 
training. And to the technique of experi- 
ment the same applies. It was like the 
merchant’s universal standard of value. 
How one looks at the primary causative 
factor in all this depends on one’s own 
background. If one is a theologian one 
probably thinks that the liberation of the 
Reformation was responsible; if one is an 
old-fashioned scientist, one naturally 
thinks that the scientific movement occur- 
red first and powered all the others; and if 
one is a Marxist, one certainly thinks that 
the economic and social changes bear the 
main responsibility. 
One factor which must have great rele- 
vance here is the undeniable circumstance

This tower for measuring the shadow 
cast by the Sun at the winter and summer 
solstices was considered by Chinese 
astronomers in ancient times to be the 
centre of the world. A gnomon (sundial 
arm), almost 13 m high, stood uprightin 
the central niche and its shadow was

that the feudalism of Europe and China 
were fundamentally different. European 
feudalism was military-aristocratic: the 
peasantry were governed by the knights in 
their manors, and they in turn were sub- 
ject to the barons in their castles, while the 
king in his palace ruled over all. In time of 
war he needed the help of the lower ranks 
in the feudal hierarchy who were bound to 
rally to him with stated numbers of men- 
at-arms. How different was the feudalism 
of China, long very justifiably described 
as bureaucratic. From the time of the first 
emperor, Qin Shih Huangdi, onwards 
(third century BC), the old hereditary 
feudal houses were gradually attacked and 
destroyed, while the king or emperor (as 
he soon became) governed by the aid of an 
enormous bureaucracy, a civil service un- 
imaginable in extent and degree of orga- 
nization to the petty kingdoms of Europe. 
Modern research is showing that the 
bureaucratic organization of China in its 
earlier stages strongly helped science to 
grow; only in its later ones did it forcibly 
inhibit further growth, and in particular 
prevented a breakthrough which has 
occurred in Europe. For example, no 
other country in the world at the begin- 
ning of the eighth century AD could have 
set up a meridian arc survey stretching 
from south to north some 4,000 kilo- 
metres. Nor could it have mounted an 
expedition at that time to go and observe 
the stars of the southern hemisphere to 
within 20° of the south celestial pole. Nor 
indeed would it have wanted to. 
It may well be that a similar pattern will 
appear in the future when the history of 
science, technology and medicine, for all 
the great classical literary cultures, such as 
India or Sri Lanka, comes to be written 
and gathered in. Europe has entered into 
their inheritance, producing an ecumenic- 
al universal science and technology valid 
for every man and woman on the face of 
the Earth. One can only hope that the 
shortcomings of the distinctively Euro- 
pean traditions in other matters will not 
debauch the non-European civilizations. 
For example, the sciences of China and of 
Islam never dreamed of divorcing science 
from ethics, but when at the Scientific 
Revolution the final cause of Aristotle was 
done away with, and ethics chased out of 
science, things became very different, and 
more menacing. This was good in so far as 
it clarified and discriminated between the 
great forms of human experience, but very 
bad and dangerous when it opened the 
way for evil men to use the great discover- 
ies of modern science and divert them to 
activities disastrous for humanity. Science 
needs to be lived alongside religion, philo- 
sophy, history and aesthetic experience; 
alone it can lead to great harm. All we can 
do today is to hope and pray that the 
unbelievably dangerous powers of atomic 
weapons, which have been put into the 
hands of human beings by the develop- 
ment of modern science, will remain 
under control by responsible men, and 
that maniacs will not release powers that 
could extinguish not only mankind, but all 
life on Earth. [|

OF AN ANCIENT GIVILIZATION 
  


### 81672: The Observation of sunspots

The observation of sunspots 
Most of the sunspots seen in the West before the seventeenth century were 
explained away as transits of the Sun by the planets Mercury and Venus. 
The theory of “perfection of the Heavens” forbade the admission of any 
imperfections on the surface of the Sun. 
The Chinese suffered from no such preconceived insistence on “perfec- 
tion”. Since sunspots are sometimes large enough to be seen by the naked 
eye, the Chinese naturally saw them. The earliest surviving record we have 
of their observations would seem to be some remarks by one of the three 
known early astronomers in China, He was Gan De, who lived in the 
fourth century BC. He and two contemporaries, Shi Shen and Wu Xian, 
drew up the first great star catalogues. Their work was fully comparable to 
that of the Greek Hipparchos, though two centuries earlier. 
The next indication of a sunspot observation dates from 165 BC. We are 
told in a much later encyclopaedia, The Ocean of Jade, that in that year the 
Chinese character wang appeared in the Sun. This was therefore a sunspot 
which appeared not round, but shaped like a cross with a bar drawn across 
the top and the bottom. The astronomer D.]. Schove accepts this as the 
world’s earliest precisely dated sunspot. The recording of sunspot observa- 
tions in the voluminous official imperial histories of China commenced on 
10 May 28 BC. But systematic Chinese observations of sunspots probably 
began at the latest by the fourth century BC, and only the loss of much 
literature of that time denies us more specific information. 
Most people today believe that sunspots were first observed in the West 
by Galileo, who is also supposed to have been the first person to “invent” 
or at least use the telescope. Neither belief is true. Galileo most certainly 
did not invent the telescope, though he gave it prominence, and 
courageously advocated its use to study the heavens. As for the observation 
of sunspots, the earliest clear reference to them so far found in Western 
literature is in Einhard’s Life of Charlemagne, of about 807 AD. 
Later sunspot observations in the West were made by the Arab Abu 
al-Fadl Jafar ibn al-Mugqtafi in 840 AD, by Ibn Rushd about 1196, and by

: The Chinese practised the technique of using blast furnaces for making cast 
C as t Iron iron from at least the fourth century BC. There were a number of reasons 
for this. China had good refractory clays for the construction of the walls 
of blast furnaces. The Chinese also knew how to reduce the temperature at 


### 81673: Cast iron

which the iron would melt. They threw in something which they called 
“black earth”, which contained much iron phosphate. If up to 6 per cent of 
phosphorus is added in this way to an iron mixture, it reduces the melting 
point from the normal 1130°C to 950°C. This technique was used in the 
early centuries, ceasing before the sixth century AD, when proper blast 
furnaces came into use which needed no such assistance. 
Coal, which gave a high temperature, was used as a fuel from the fourth 
century AD, and probably earlier. One method was to put the iron ore in 
batteries of elongated, tube-like crucibles, and pack these round with a 
mass of coal which was then burnt. This had the extra advantage of 
excluding sulphur from the process. 
The widespread availability of cast iron in ancient China had many side 
effects. It led to the innovation of the cast iron ploughshare in agriculture, 
along with iron hoes and other tools. Iron knives, axes, chisels, saws and 
awls all became available. Food could be cooked in cast iron pots, and even 
toys were made of cast iron. Cast iron statuettes of various animals have 
been found in Han Dynasty tombs dating between the second centuries 
BC and AD. Cast iron moulds for implements dating from the fourth 
century BC have also been discovered. Hoes and axes would have been cast 
in these, in either bronze or iron. 
The expertise in cast iron enabled pots and pans to be made with very 
thin walls, impossible by other iron technology. One extremely important 
result was that salt could be mass-produced from evaporated brine, which 
can only be done in such thin pans. This in turn led the Chinese to exploit 
natural gas by deep drilling. This was in order to tap the energy from the 
burning gas to evaporate the vast quantities of brine required for the giant 
salt industry (which the Han Dynasty nationalized along with the iron 
industry in 119 BC). The salt and gas industries could not have existed 
without the cast iron industry. 
In the third century BC, the Chinese discovered how to make a 
malleable cast iron by annealing (that is, by holding it at a high temperature 
for a week or so). It was then not so brittle, and would therefore not shatter

metallurgy. The 13-m-high Yu Quan 
pagodaat Dangyang (Hubei) is entirely 
built of cast iron. Erected in 1061, itis the

if subjected to a violent shock. This meant that objects like ploughshares 
could survive striking large stones with considerable force. Cast iron had 
something of the elasticity of wrought iron, but with the much greater 
strength and solidity that came from being cast. It was almost as good as 
steel. 
Some of the ancient Chinese feats of casting iron are so impressive as to 
be almost unbelievable, even when the results are before our eyes. For 
instance, there is the cast iron pagoda shown on opposite page. 
Perhaps the grandest cast iron structure of all was not actually a building. 
The Empress Wu Zetian had an octagonal cast iron column built, called the 
“Celestial Axis Commemorating the Virtue of the Great Zhou Dynasty 
with Its Myriad Regions”. It was built in 695 AD upon a base of cast iron 
51 metres in circumference and 6 metres high. The column itself was 
3.6 metres in diameter and rose 32 metres in the air; on top was a “cloud 
canopy” 3 metres high and 9 metres in circumference. On top of this in 
turn stood four bronze dragons each 3.6 metres nigh supporting a gilded 
pearl. We have a record of the amount of metal used in this construction— 
about 1,325 tons. The largest single cast iron object ever made (the pagodas 
were obviously not a single piece) was erected on the orders of the Emperor 
Shizong of the Later Zhou Dynasty in commemoration of his campaign 
against the Tartars in 954 AD. This extraordinary object, 6 metres tall, still

The cardan suspension 
The “cardan suspension”, or gimbals, takes its name from Jerome Cardan 
(Girolamo Cardano, 1501-1576). But Cardan neither invented the device 
nor claimed to have done so. He merely described it in his very popular 
book De subtilitate rerum (1550; “The Subtlety of Things”). It appeared in 
Europe as early as the ninth century AD; but it was invented in China by 
the second century BC at the latest. 
This invention is the basis of the modern gyroscope, making possible the 
navigation and “automatic pilots” taken for granted in modern aircraft. 
Anyone who has been fortunate enough to enter a nineteenth-century 
Gypsy caravan will have noticed affixed to the walls the brass gimbals that 
hold lamps which remain upright no matter how violently the cart may jolt 
on the road. These interlocking brass rings can be moved around as much 
as you like, but the lamp suspended in the centre never turns over. This 1s 
the basic idea of the “cardan suspension”. A series of rings inside one 
another are each joined at two opposing points, enabling them to twist and 
turn freely. Consequently, if a heavy weight, such as a lamp, is positioned 
upright in the centre, it will remain upright. Whatever motions might occur 
to the rings around it will be taken up by the rings themselves, leaving the 
lamp unmoved. By the eighteenth century, Chinese mariners were using a 
gimbal-mounted compass. A ship’s magnetic compass mounted in this way 
was free of disturbance by waves. 
The earliest textual reference to gimbals which has been found is in a 
poem called Ode on Beautiful Women, composed about 140 BC. More 
than three centuries later, about 189 AD, the clever mechanic Ding Huan 
was given credit for inventing gimbals a second time. 
Gimbals reached Europe after 1,100 years. And 800 years after that, the 
English physicist Robert Hooke and others adopted its principle in a new 
form, applying power from without rather than stabilizing a central 
element within, to formulate that Western invention, the universal joint. 
And it was this invention which resulted in the transmission of automotive 
power in contemporary motor cars. u

### 81675: Steel manufacture

Steel manufacture 
The Chinese were the first to produce cast iron, and were also the first to 
make steel from cast iron. This was fully under way by the second century 
BC at the latest, and eventually led to the invention of the Bessemer steel 
process in the West in 1856. Henry Bessemer’s work had been anticipated 
in 1852 by William Kelly, from a small town near Eddyville, Kentucky. 
Kelly had brought four Chinese steel experts to Kentucky in 1845, from 
whom he had learned the principles of steel production used in China for 
over 2,000 years previously, and had made his own developments. 
Iron, when melted and reformed into ingots, has a carbon content. This 
determines the nature of the metal as cast iron or steel, whichever the case 
may be. Cast iron is brittle because it contains a considerable quantity of 
carbon, perhaps as much as 4.5 per cent. “Decarburization” is the removal 
of some or all of this carbon. Remove much of the carbon and you have 
steel; remove nearly all the carbon and you have wrought iron. The 
Chinese used wrought iron a great deal, most notably perhaps in building 
large bridges and aqueducts. 
The Chinese invented the suspension bridge, often constructing such 
bridges with chains whose links were of wrought iron instead of plaited 
bamboo. Cast iron was called “raw iron”, steel was called “great iron”, and 
wrought iron was called “ripe iron” by the Chinese. In order to make iron 
“ripe”, they clearly understood that the iron was losing a key ingredient, 
and they described this as “loss of vital juices”. But, without knowledge of 
modern chemistry, they could not identify the ingredient as carbon. 
The Chinese were not the first to make steel. But they did invent two 
particular steel manufacturing processes, of which taking the carbon out of 
cast iron was the first. The process of “decarburization” was accomplished 
by blowing oxygen on to the cast iron (“oxygenation”). We read of this in 
the classic Huainanzi, which dates from about 120 BC. 
Making steel by this method was also called “the hundred refinings 
method”, since it was often done over and over again, the steel becoming 
stronger each time. Swords made by this method were highly prized. The 
back of the sword, not having an edge, would often be made of the more 
elastic wrought iron, and the harder steel would be welded on to it to bear 
the cutting edge for a sabre. The carbon content of the steel could be 
adjusted depending upon how much oxygen was applied to the molten 
iron, 
Generally speaking, steel with a higher carbon content is stronger, but 
then strength is traded against brittleness. Steel can have a carbon content 
of between 0.1 per cent and 1.8 per cent. The Chinese could only make 
empirical judgments on the qualities of steel obtained from certain num- 
bers of refinings. If very soft steel was desired, they could go on blowing 
more oxygen in, removing increasing amounts of the carbon. And they 
practised the world-wide technique of quenching, whereby steel that is 
cooled instantly in a liquid when still either red- or white-hot preserves its 
inner metallic micro-structure which it would lose if allowed to cool 
slowly. On the other hand, cooling steel slowly (tempering) has other 
advantages. The Chinese were great masters at manipulating their iron 
materials in countless different ways to obtain the exact type of metal they 
required. 
Around the fifth century AD, the Chinese developed the “co-fusion” 
process, in which cast and wrought iron were melted together to yield the 
“something in between”, which was steel. This is essentially the Martin and 
Siemens steel process of 1863, though carried out 1,400 years earlier. 
The process was in full swing by the sixth century, from which time we 
have a Chinese description of it: “Qiu Huaiwen also made sabres of 
‘overnight iron’. The method was to bake the purest cast iron, piling it up 
with the soft ingots of wrought iron, until after several days and nights, it 
was all turned to steel.” 
We are given precise technical details by Song Yingxing in 1637: 
“The method of making steel is as follows. The wrought iron is beaten

into thin plates or scales as wide as a finger and around four centimetres 
long. These are packed within wrought iron sheets and all tightly pressed 
down by cast iron pieces piled on top. The whole furnace is then covered 
over with mud (or clay) as well. Large furnace piston bellows are then set to 
work, and when the fire has risen to a sufficient heat, the cast iron comes to 
its transformation [i.e. melts] first, and dripping and soaking, penetrates 
into the wrought iron. When the two are united with each other, they are 
taken out and forged; afterwards they are again heated and hammered. This 
is many times repeated.”

### 81676: The Chain pump

The chain pump 
One of the inventions of the greatest utility which has spread from China 
throughout the world, so that its origins are no longer realized, is the 
square-pallet chain pump. It consists of an endless circulating chain bearing 
square pallets which hold water, earth, or sand. 
This pump can haul enormous quantities of water from lower to higher 
levels. The optimum angle of slope at which the chain of pallets can be laid 
out is about 24°. So, depending on how well the pallets were fitted to avoid 
leakage and on the sturdiness of the machine as a whole, the height that 
water can be raised by a single pump is about 5 metres. 
By medieval times in China, the pumps had been adapted for use as 
conveyors of earth or sand rather than just water. They were thus the first 
conveyor belts. 
We do not know who invented the chain pump, or exactly when. 
Although it may have existed some centuries earlier, we can take as its time 
of origin the first century AD. The philosopher Wang Chong refers to its 
existence about 80 AD in his book Discourses Weighed in the Balance. 
Considerable improvements were made to the design during the next 
century. We know this from an account in the imperial history of the time, 
which discusses the lack of water in the capital, Luoyang. The history tells 
us that the famous eunuch minister Zhang Rang (died 189 AD) ordered 
various improvements for Luoyang from the engineer Bi Lan: 
“He further asked Bi Lan ... to construct square-pallet chain pumps and 
suction pumps, which were set up to the west of the bridge outside the 
‘Peace Gate to spray water along the north-south roads of the city, thus 
saving the expense incurred by the common people [in sprinkling water on 
these roads and carrying water to the people living along them] ... 
Chain pumps had achieved a standard form in China by 828. The 
imperial history for that year records: 
“In the second year of the Taihe reign-period, in the second month ... a 
standard model of the chain-pump was issued from the palace, and the 
people of Jingzhao Fu were ordered by the Emperor to make a consider- 
able number of the machines, for distribution along the Zheng Bai Canal, 
for irrigation purposes.” 
The pumps were used for civil engineering works and for draining all 
sorts of sites, as well as for irrigation and the supply of drinking water. The 
pumps were so spectacular in their results that visiting dignitaries and 
ambassadors from neighbouring lands eventually adopted them in their 
own countries. E

### 81679: A Cybernetic machine

A cybernetic machine 
By the third century AD at the latest, the Chinese had a fully operational, 
navigational “cybernetic machine”, using the principles of feedback. It was 
called the “south-pointing carriage”, but had no connection with a magne- 
tic compass. It was a large carriage, 3.3 metres long, 3.3 metres deep, and 
2.75 metres wide, surmounted by a jade statue of an “immortal”—a sage 
who had achieved immortality. The figure’s arm was raised, pointing 
ahead, and it always faced towards the south, no matter which way the 
carriage turned. Even if the road were circular, the jade figure would rotate, 
keeping the finger pointing in the same direction. How was this possible in 
the third century AD? This machine may have been invented even earlier, 
indeed, as much as 1,200 years earlier. An official history for 500 AD 
describes how: 
“The south-pointing carriage was first constructed by the Duke of Zhou 
[beginning of the first millennium BC] as a means of conducting home- 
wards certain envoys who had arrived from a great distance beyond the 
frontiers. The country was a boundless plain in which people lost their 
bearings as to east and west, so the Duke caused this vehicle to be made in 
order that the ambassadors should be able to distinguish north and south.” 
If this information is correct, the invention would date from about 
1030 BC. But Needham suspects that the word “carriage” was inserted in 
this account by scribes, and that what is being described ts a “south- 
pointer”, that is, a compass. 
The next person credited with building a south-pointing carriage is the 
astronomer and scientist Zhang Heng, about 120 AD, although this is also 
regarded by Needham as doubtful. The only date which he is prepared to 
accept with certainty is the middle of the third century AD, with the 
famous engineer Ma Jun as the builder (and, thus, the inventor). The 
drawing of a pointing figure of jade, taken from the Universal Encyclo- 
paedia of 1601, was copied from a print of 1341. 
If the machine did not use a magnetic compass, how did it work? The 
answer is that it had a train of differential gears, similar to those in a modern 
automobile. Perhaps the function of a differential gear should be explained 
as follows. When a wheeled vehicle is turning a corner the wheels on 
opposite sides of the vehicle are clearly going to need to turn at different 
rates since the near side is travelling a shorter distance than the far side. 
With a hand-cart or horse-drawn carriage, this may not pose such prob- 
lems. But when a vehicle has power being applied to the axle to make the 
wheels turn, how is it possible for one wheel to be permitted to speed up a 
little, and the other slow down a little, on the same axle? This is made 
possible only by an ingenious combination of gear wheels and flywheels: 
the differential gear. 
When Needham published his volume on mechanical engineering in 
1965, he believed that the Chinese had invented the differential gear, and 
that it had made its first appearance in this south-pointing carriage. If the 
first south-pointing carriage were the one attributed to the Duke of Zhou 
about 1000 BC, then the Chinese would indeed have been the inventors; 
but we must stay on the side of caution, and assume that the first 
south-pointing carriage was made in the second or third century AD. In 
that case, we must credit the Greeks with inventing the differential gear, a 
fact which became known only in 1975, when Professor Derek Price 
published his book Gears from the Greeks. In this work Price wrote the 
definitive account of a Greek differential gear dating from 80 BC, which 
Price said “must surely rank as one of the greatest basic mechanical 
inventions of all time”. And although a transmission of this invention from 
Greece and Rome to China was possible, it is equally possible that the 
differential gear was independently re-invented in China for the south- 
pointing carriage. 
The precision needed in the construction of the south-pointing carriage 
almost defies belief. For the outside road wheels alone, Needham points 
out, J. Coales, in The Historical and Scientific Background of Automation, 
“has calculated that a difference of only one per cent between the wheel 
circumferences would lead to a change of direction of the pointing figure of 
as much as 90 per cent in a distance only fifty times that between the two

### 81679: A Cybernetic machine

wheels.” This was because the carriage would veer more and more to one 
side if one wheel were smaller (relative slip). So that for this south-pointing 
carriage, the size of the road wheels had to be accurate to a margin of error 
far less than one per cent, and a commensurate accuracy in size of gear 
wheels would have been necessary. This points to engineering of such a 
high order that we may well be justified in hesitating to apply the words 
“ancient” and “primitive” to it! 
The south-pointing device was basically a reversal of the use of the 
differential gear in the modern automobile. Today, such gears are used to 
apply power to turn the wheels and make the vehicle move. But with the 
south-pointing carriage, which was pulled by animals, the power was 
transmitted from the wheels, and applied towards the continual adjusting 
of the position of the pointing figure. Thus it was the differential gear in the 
machine which turned the figure so that it always pointed to the south. And 
it did so just as the differential gear operates today, only in reverse. 
Needham has called the south-pointing carriage “the first homeostatic 
machine in human history, involving full negative feedback. Of course, the 
driver had to beincluded in the loop. But as Coales has acutely pointed out, 
an attractive carrot held by the pointing figure might have replaced the 
human driver and closed the loop more automatically.” Although 
Needham has occasionally spoken of the south-pointing carriage as the 
first actual cybernetic machine, he has qualified this by saying: “The 
south-pointing carriage would have been the first cybernetic machine had 
the actual steering corrected itself, as we could easily make itdo today.” WM

### 81680: Magic mirrors'

‘Magic mirrors’ 
Those who like to think of China as a land of mystery are well served by the 
Chinese “magic mirrors”, which are some of the strangest objects in the 
world. They are known to go back to at least the fifth century AD, though 
their exact origins are unknown. About 1,200 years ago, there still existed a 
book entitled Record of Ancient Mirrors, which apparently contained the 
secrets of these magic mirrors and their construction, but sadly it seems to 
have been lost for over a thousand years. 
When magic mirrors came to the attention of the West in 1832, dozens of 
prominent scientists attempted to discover their secret. It was a hundred 
years before a satisfactory theory of magic mirrors was formulated by the 
British crystallographer Sir William Bragg. 
What exactly, then, is a magic mirror? On its back it has cast bronze 
designs—pictures, or written characters, or both. The reflecting side is 
convex and is of bright, shiny polished bronze which serves as a mirror. In 
many conditions of lighting, when held in the hand, it appears to be 2 
perfectly normal mirror: 
However, when the mirror is held in bright sunshine, its reflecting 
surface can be “seen through”, making it possible to inspect from a 
reflection cast on to a dark wall the written characters or patterns on the 
back. Somehow, mysteriously, the solid bronze becomes transparent, 
leading to the Chinese name for the objects, “light-penetration mirrors”. 
But surely, the reader will protest, solid bronze cannot be transparent. 
This is true, and there was certainly a trick to it. But it was a sufficiently 
good trick to baffle Western scientists for a century, and even the earliest 
surviving Chinese discussion of magic mirrors consists of speculation on 
how they might work. This occurs in a fascinating work, Dream Pool 
Essays, by Shen Gua, published in 1086. Even at this date, Shen Gua 
thought of the mirrors as coming from some vague archaic period: 
“There exist certain ‘light-penetration mirrors’ which have about twenty 
characters inscribed on them in an ancient style which cannot be inter- 
preted. If such a mirror is exposed to the sunshine, although the characters 
are all on the back, they ‘pass through’ and are reflected on the wall of a 
house, where they can be read most distinctly.... I have three of these 
inscribed ‘light-penetration mirrors’ in my own family, and I have seen 
others treasured in other families, which are closely similar and very 
ancient; all of them ‘let the light through’. But I do not understand why 
other mirrors, though extremely thin, do not ‘let light through’. The 
ancients must indeed have had some special art .... Those who discuss the 
reason say that at the time the mirror was cast, the thinner part became cold 
first, while the raised part of the design on the back, being thicker, became 
cold later, so that the bronze formed minute wrinkles. Thus although the 
characters are on the back, the face has faint lines too faint to be seen with 
the naked eye.” 
Although differences of cooling rate are not the explanation, Shen Gua 
was correct in suggesting that the shiny, polished mirror surfaces concealed

light is projected at the reflecting surface 
and the mirror is held so that it casts a 
reflection on a dark wall, the ornamental 
design on the back becomes visible in the 
reflection on the wall. The mirror shown 
here is Japanese. The characters Takasago 
which form part of the ornamental 
design refer to the title of a No play.

minute variations which the eye alone could not detect. Needham says of 
the experiments carried out by European scientists: “Careful and extended 
optical experimentation demonstrated that the surfaces of ‘magic’ mirrors 
reproduced the designs on the backs because of very slight inequalities of 
curvature, the thicker portions being very slightly flatter than the thinner 
ones, and even sometimes actually concave.” 
The basic mirror shape, with the design on the back, was cast flat, and the 
convexity of the surface produced afterwards by elaborate scraping and 
scratching. The surface was then polished to become shiny. The stresses set 
up by these processes caused the thinner parts of the surface to bulge 
outwards and become more convex than the thicker portions. Finally, a 
mercury amalgam was laid over the surface; this created further stresses 
and preferential buckling. The result was that imperfections of the mirror 
surface matched the patterns on the back, although they were too minute to 
be seen by the eye. But when the mirror reflected bright sunlight against a 
wall, with the resultant magnification of the whole image, the effect was to 
reproduce the patterns as if they were passing through the solid bronze by 
way of light beams. As Sir William Bragg said when he finally discovered 
this in 1932: “Only the magnifying effect of reflection makes them plain.” 
Needham rightly calls this “the first step on the road to knowledge about 
the minute structure of metal surfaces.” | 
Efficient horse harnesses 
From earliest times until the eighth century AD in the West (and, as we 
shall see, much earlier in China), the only means of harnessing horses was 
by the “throat-and-girth harness”. It was an absurd method since the strap 
across the throat meant that the horse was choked as soon as he exerted 
himself. As long as man was restricted to the use of this pathetic harness, 
horsepower was all but useless for transport by cart. Even individual riders 
could half-strangle their mounts at a gallop. 
Those who read about ancient Rome are often struck by the importance 
attached to the shipping of grain from Egypt. Without Egyptian grain, 
Rome must starve. But why? What was wrong with grain grown in Italy,

### 81681: Efficient horse harnesses

one asks? Why was Rome dependent on ships from Egypt in order to be 
able to eat? The answer is simply that there was no horse harness capable of 
making it possible for Italian grain to be transported to Rome. 
In about the fourth century BC the Chinese made a great breakthrough. 
A lacquered box of the period bears a painting which shows a yoke across 
the horse’s chest, from which traces connect it to the chariot shafts. Soon, 
the hard yoke across the breast was also abandoned and replaced by the 
more satisfactory breast strap, commonly called the “trace harness”. There 
is no longer a strap across the horse’s throat; the weight of the load is borne 
by the horse’s chest and collar bones. 
Experiments have been carried out to establish the relative efficiency of 
the different types of harness. Two horses harnessed in the throat-and- 
girth fashion can pull a load of half a ton. But a single horse in a collar 
harness (described below) can easily pull a ton and a half. With a trace 
harness the efficiency is only slightly less. 
Needham suggests two factors which may have led the Chinese to invent 
the trace harness. There was the motivation of the Chinese, Mongols and 
Huns living on the edge of the Gobi Desert where they were always getting 
stuck in the sand, from which horses using the throat-and-girth harness 
could not extricate them. Secondly, there was the use of human haulers. 
Man’s own experience of hauling, for example, boats upstream, meant that 
he was quickly aware of the inadequacy of a rope round the neck. 
The most efficient harness is the collar harness (see drawing this page). 
The earliest evidence for the collar harness in China may be seen in a 
rubbing from an ancient brick. It dates from some time between the fourth 
and first centuries BC. Therefore, we must consider the collar harness as 
having been invented in China by the first century BC at the latest. This is a 
full thousand years before its appearance in Europe a century after the trace 
harness. 
After some time, it was found by the Chinese that the collar could be 
used in another and simpler way: traces could be attached from the sides of 
the collar directly to the vehicle. It is this form of the collar harness which is 
used today all round the world. || 
  


### 81682: The Stirrup

The stirrup 
For most of the time that man has been riding horses, he has had no 
supports for his feet. Stirrups were unknown to most of the great armies of 
ancient times—the Persians and Medes, the Romans, the Assyrians, the 
Egyptians, the Babylonians, the Greeks. The horsemen of Alexander the 
Great made their way across the whole of Central Asia without being able 
to rest their feet while in the saddle. When galloping or jumping, horsemen 
had to hold the horse’s mane tightly to avoid falling off. The Romans 
devised a kind of hand-hold on the front of the saddle which gave them 
something of a grip when the going got rough; but their legs just dangled 
whenever they were not pressed tightly against the horse. 
Mounting a horse without stirrups was not so easy either. Fierce 
warriors took pride in their flying leaps, gripping the mane with the left 
hand and swinging themselves up; and some bareback riders still do this 
today. Cavalrymen of ancient times used their spears to help them up, 
either by hoisting themselves aloft as in pole-vaulting, or by using a peg 
sticking out of the spear as a footrest. Otherwise it was necessary to rely on 
a groom for a leg-up. 
By about the third century AD, the Chinese had remedied this situation.

bronze or iron foot stirrups. No inventor of the stirrup is recorded and the 
original idea probably came from the occasional use of a loop of rope or 
leather to assist in mounting. Of course, such loops could not be used for 
riding, because if one fell off, one would be dragged along and come to a 
sticky end. Such loops may have been first used by the Chinese, the 
Indians, or the nomads of Central Asia bordering on China. The essentials 
of the stirrup may thus have originated in the steppes, the product of 
ingenious men whose lives were lived on horseback. Apparently from the 
third century, the Chinese were casting perfect metal stirrups. The earliest 
surviving depiction of a stirrup is on a pottery figure of a cavalryman found 
in a tomb in Changsha (Hunan) and dated to 302 AD. 
The transmission of stirrups westward took place with the migrations of 
a fierce tribe called the Ruan-Ruan, who came to be known as the Avars. 
Their cavalry was devastatingly effective because they had the use of 
cast-iron stirrups. About the middle of the sixth century, they were driven 
westwards and moved across south Russia to settle between the Danube 
and the Theiss. By 560, the Avars were a serious threat to the Byzantine 
Empire, and the Byzantine cavalry was entirely reorganized in order to 
counter them. The Emperor Maurice Tiberius prepared a military manual, 
the Strategikon, in 580, specifying the cavalry techniques to be adopted. He 
mentions the need to use iron stirrups—the earliest mention in European 
literature. 
Stirrups then spread to the rest of Europe by means of the Vikings and 
possibly the Lombards. One Avar-style child’s stirrup has even been 
excavated in London, brought by a Viking. But the use of stirrups in 
Europe (other than by the Byzantines and the Vikings) was long delayed, 
for reasons which are not entirely clear. Conventional armies of Europe do 
not seem to have adopted them until the early Middle Ages. Perhaps the 
lack of metallurgical expertise was a handicap, with stirrups having to be of 
wrought rather than cast metal for a long time. Mass production of stirrups 
was only possible with cast metal. || 
  


### 81684: The Segmental arch bridge

The segmental arch bridge 
A conceptual breakthrough occurred when a Chinese engineer realized 
that an arch did not have to be a semi-circle. A bridge could be built which 
was based not on the traditional semi-circular arch but on what is known as 
a segmental arch. The way to envisage this 1s to imagine a giganuc circle 
embedded in the ground, of which only the tip shows above ground level. 
This tip is a segment of a circle, and the arch it forms is a segmental arch. 
Bridges built in this way take less material and are stronger than ones built 
as semi-circular arches. 
This advance took place in China in the seventh century AD. It was the 
concept of Li Chun, the founder of an entire school of constructional 
engineering whose influence lasted for many centuries. We are fortunate 
that his first great bridge, built in 610, survives intact and 1s still very much 
in use today. Called the Great Stone Bridge, it spans the Jiao river near 
Zhaoxian at the foot of the Shanxi Mountains on the edge of the North 
China Plain. 
Four small whole arches were incorporated within the structure of the 
main bridge. They were an innovation of great consequence in bridge- 
building, for they were the world’s first arched spandrels. Li Chun found 
that by punching these holes in the ends of the bridge he could accomplish 
several things at once: flood waters could rush through them, lessening the

sudden flood; the total weight of the bridge could be lessened, thereby 
diminishing the tendency to buckle by the ends sinking down into the river 
banks; and vast quantities of material could be saved, which would 
normally have gone to make solid ends for the bridge. 
The Great Stone Bridge has a span of 37.5 metres. The largest surviving 
Roman whole arch bridge, the Pont Saint Martin near Aosta, spans 35.5 
metres. But the average whole arch Roman bridge spanned between 18 and 
25 metres, whereas whole arches in Roman aqueducts had an average span 
of about 6 metres. 
The greatest segmental arch bridge in China is the famous “Marco Polo 
Bridge”, often so named because Polo described it at length. Just west of 
Beijing, it crosses the Yongding river at the small town of Lugougiao, and is 
213 metres in length, consisting of a series of eleven segmental arches 
extending one after another across the river, each with an average span of 19 
metres. It was built in 1189 and is still heavily used by modern truck and 
bus traffic. Marco Polo thought this bridge “the finestin the world”. WH

### 81686: A Refined value of pi

A refined value of pi 
The irrational number pi can be computed to an infinite number of decimal 
places. It expresses the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, 
a relationship which cannot be framed in terms of whole numbers. (Pi is 
needed to compute the area of a circle or volume of a sphere.) The value of 
pt was computed by Archimedes to three decimal places, and by Ptolemy 
to four decimal places. But after that, for 1,450 years, no greater accuracy 
was achieved in the Western world. The Chinese, however, made great 
strides forward in computing pi. 
One way in which the ancient mathematicians tried to approach an 
accurate value for pi was to inscribe polygons with more and more sides to 
them inside circles, so that the areas of the polygons (which could be 
computed) would more and more closely. approach the area of the circle. 
Thus, they could try to find a value for pi, since the circle’s area was found 
by using the formula containing it. (They could measure the diameter, and 
squeeze a polygon whose area they knew into the circle; the only unknown 
number would be pi, which could then be calculated.) Archimedes used a 
96-sided polygon, and decided that pi had a value between 3.142 and 3.140. 
The Chinese tried to sneak up on pi in the same fashion. Liu Hui in the 
third century AD started by inscribing a polygon of 192 sides in a circle, 
and then went on to inscribe one of 3,072 sides which “squeezed” even 
closer. He was thus able to calculate a value of pi of 3.14159. At this point, 
the Chinese overtook the Greeks. 
But the real leap forward came in the fifth century AD, when truly 
advanced values for pi appeared in China. The mathematicians Zu 
Chongzhi and Zu Gengzhi (father and son), by means of calculations 
which have been lost, obtained an “accurate” value of pz to ten decimal 
places, as 3.1415929203. The circle used for the inscribing of the polygons 
is known to have been 10 feet across. This value for pi was recorded in 
historical records of the period, but the actual books of those mathemati- 
cians have vanished over the centuries. Nine hundred years later, the 
mathematician Zao Yugin (about 1300 AD) set himself to verify this value 
of pi. He inscribed polygons in a circle with the enormous number of 
16,384 sides. He thus confirmed the value given by the Zu family. | 
  


### 81687: The Decimal system

The decimal system 
The decimal system, now fundamental to modern science, originated in 
China. Its use can be traced back to the fourteenth century BC, the archaic 
period known as the Shang Dynasty, though it evidently was used long 
before that. 
An example of how the ancient Chinese used the decimal system may be 
seen from an inscription dating from the thirteenth century BC, in which 
“547 days” 1s written “Five hundreds plus four decades plus seven of days”. 
In computation, the Chinese used counting rods on counting boards. To 
“write” ten involved placing a single rod in the second box from the right, 
and leaving the first empty, to signify zero. To change the ten to eleven, a 
single rod was added in the first box. To “write” 111, single rods were 
placed in the first, second and third boxes. Apparently from the earliest 
times, the decimal place system for numbers was literally a place system; 
the Chinese placed counting rods into actual boxes. 
The fact that the decimal system existed from the very beginnings of 
mathematics in China gave the Chinese a substantial advantage, laying a 
foundation for most of the advances they later made. |

glaze, is one of the oldest surviving pieces 
of porcelain (3rd century AD). 
  


### 81689: Porcelain

Porcelain 
Ordinary pottery is made from clay baked in a kiln at temperatures ranging 
from 500°C to 1150°C, and is called earthenware. Porcelain is something 
quite different: it consists of a body of fused clay covered by a glaze, a 
glassy substance, and is fired at a high temperature—about 1280°C. The 
secret of making porcelain lies in the use of a pure clay, kaolin or China 
clay, which when fired at a sufficiently high temperature changes its 
physical composition, a process known as vitrification, and becomes 
translucent and totally impervious to water. The reason why China was 
able to “invent” porcelain at a very early age compared to the rest of the 
world was that the Chinese potters both found the clay and were able to 
produce the high temperature necessary to fuse it. 
It now seems that archaeological finds push back the date of true 
porcelain to the first century AD. By the third century AD, in any case, 
true porcelain was undeniably in use. 
By the Song Dynasty (960-1279), porcelain had reached a very high 
degree of artistry. Porcelain manufacture by this time was a highly 
organized trade employing hundreds of thousands of people. There were 
teams of men who specialized in washing the clay, others who concerned 
themselves only with glazes, others who maintained the kilns, and so on. 
One kiln of this period which has been excavated could accommodate 
25,000 pieces of porcelain at a single firing. It was built on the slope of a 
hill, the gentle incline of about 15° reducing the speed of the flames 
through the kiln. The sophistication of the kilns was most impressive. 
Some were fired by burning wood, while others were down-draught 
burners of charcoal. Control of the firing process was of the utmost 
precision. In the Ming Dynasty (1369-1644), when the famous blue and 
white ware was largely produced, the best lustrous quality of the cobalt 
blue pigment could only be obtained at certain specific temperatures, and 
in a reducing (de-oxidizing) flame. 
The secrets of porcelain manufacture were jealously guarded, and 
visitors from Europe such as Marco Polo could but gape and wonder. 
Porcelain objects were still a very great rarity in Europe by the fifteenth 
century. They were gifts for kings and potentates. Not until 1520 did the 
first sample of kaolin clay reach Europe, brought by the Portuguese. 
Europeans then thought that if only they could find deposits of this white 
clay, they would be able to make porcelain. But kaolin clay alone is far 
from sufficient for the making of porcelain. 
The countless experiments carried on with various earths and solid 
substances in furnaces eventually had a most unpredictable result. Scien- 
tists and craftsmen began to notice that upon cooling down again, molten 
minerals could crystallize. Until this began to be observed, Western 
scientists had been convinced that crystals could only be formed from 
liquids. About the middle of the eighteenth century in Europe, the idea 
began to gain ground that perhaps the Earth’s rocks could have been 
formed from the cooling of molten masses of lava. In 1785 the geologist 
James Hutton presented his revolutionary new theory of the Earth based 
on this idea. And so, one of the great scientific advances in the Western 
world took place as a direct consequence of the attempts by Europeans to 
find the secret of porcelain manufacture. |

### 81690: Matches

Matches 
The first version of a match was invented in the year 577 AD by impover- 
ished court ladies during a military siege, in the short-lived Chinese 
kingdom of the Northern Qi. Hard-pressed during the siege, they must 
have been so short of tinder that they could otherwise not start fires for 
cooking or heating. 
Early matches were made with sulphur. A description is found in a book 
entitled Records of the Unworldly and the Strange written about 950 by 
Tao Gu: 
“If there occurs an emergency at night it may take some time to make a 
light to light a lamp. But an ingenious man devised the system of impreg- 
nating little sticks of pinewood with sulphur and storing them ready for 
use. At the slightest touch of fire they burst into flame. One gets a little 
flame like an ear of corn. This marvellous thing was formerly called a 
‘light-bringing slave’, but afterwards when it became an article of com- 
merce its name was changed to ‘fire inch-stick’.” 
There is no evidence of matches in Europe before 1530. Matches could 
easily have been brought to Europe by one of the Europeans travelling to 
China at the time of Marco Polo, since we know for certain that they were 
being sold in the street markets of Hangzhou in the year 1270 or there- 
abouts. [|

### 81702: Biological pest control

Biological pest control 
For 1,700 years, the Chinese have controlled insect pests by biological 
means, using one insect to kill another. Perhaps their most striking and 
important use of biological pest control was in the use of yellow citrus 
killer-ants to protect mandarin trees. Here is how a text of 304 AD, Records 
of the Plants and Trees of the Southern Regions, describes the use of the 
carnivorous yellow ants: 
“The mandarin orange is a kind of orange with an exceptionally sweet 
and delicious taste.... The people of Jiaoshi [Tonkin] sell in their markets 
[carnivorous] ants in bags of rush matting. The nests are like silk. The bags 
are all attached to twigs and leaves which, with the ants inside the nests, are 
for sale. The ants are reddish-yellow in colour, bigger than ordinary ants. 
These ants do not eat the oranges, but attack and kill the insects which do. 
In the south, if the mandarin orange trees do not have this kind of ant, the 
fruits will be damaged by many harmful insects, and not a single fruit will 
be perfect.” 
This biological pest control first came to Western attention when a paper 
on the subject was published in the North China Herald on 4 April 1882. 
But it was not until a serious outbreak of citrus canker occurred in the 
Florida citrus groves in the 1910s that a plant physiologist was sent to 
China by the US Department of Agriculture in 1915 to search for canker- 
resistant oranges, and discovered the citrus ants. In 1958, a Chinese 
scientist, Chen Shou-jian, recommended a renewed study of the ants. Their 
use in Chinese orange groves continues to this day. [|

### 81703: Petroleum and natural gas

Petroleum and natural gas 
It is probably a conservative estimate to say that the Chinese were burning 
natural gas for fuel and light by the fourth century BC. The deep boreholes 
drilled for brine also yielded natural gas from time to time. These methane 
‘gas deposits tended to occur under the brine, but many boreholes, includ- 
ing those intended for brine, yielded only natural gas and were known to 
the Chinese as “fire wells”. These boreholes were being drilled systemati- 
cally for brine by at least the first century BC, so that deep supplies of 
natural gas were tapped from that date by boreholes going down over 
100 metres. And the systematic search for natural gas itself by deep drilling 
is recorded in the second century AD. 
Chang Qu in 347 recorded in his book Records of the Country South of 
Mount Hua: 
“At the place where the river from Bupu joins the Huojing River, there 
are fire wells; at night the glow is reflected all over the sky. The inhabitants 
wanted to have fire, and used to ignite the gas outlets with brands from 
household hearths; after a short time there would be a noise like the 
rumbling of thunder and the flames would shoot out so brilliantly as to 
light up the country for several dozen /i around. Moreover they use 
bamboo tubes to ‘contain the light’, conserving it so that it can be made to 
travel from one place to another, as much as a day’s journey away from the 
well without its being extinguished. When it has burnt no ash is left, and it 
blazes brilliantly.” 
Bamboo pipelines did indeed carry both brine and natural gas for many 
kilometres, sometimes passing under roads and sometimes going overhead 
on trestles. 
The ignition and use of the natural gas for light and fuel posed problems 
which were successfully overcome by the ancient Chinese. Old texts 
describe in some detail the complicated arrangements which were even- 
tually adopted to control the burning of natural gas. The gas from the “fire 
wells” was fed first into a large wooden chamber about 3 metres below 
ground level over the mouth of the borehole. It was basically a cone-shaped 
barrel into which an underground pipe also conveyed air. The chamber 
therefore acted as a great carburettor, feeding into banks of pipes which led 
to other smaller conical chambers which rested on the surface of the earth. 
These too took in air, with a variety of entry pipes which could be opened 
or closed, so that a fine-tuning of the “engine” was possible by a con- 
tinuous manipulation of the fuel/air mixture. If the pressure of the mixture 
were to flag, dangerous flash-backs and explosions could occur, so the 
main chamber would be opened up further. But fires could result if the 
mixture were too rich, so surplus gas was allowed to escape through what 
was called a “sky thrusting pipe” exhaust system. 
Flames less than 50 cm high were used for other purposes, such as 
providing lights in certain Sichuan towns. The gas was also available for 
heating in these towns, though details of how it was employed are lacking. 
It seems doubtful that proper gas stoves existed, and it is more likely that 
the heating applications were generally for cooking and boiling uses. 
Other portable heat sources included petroleum products, which often 
went under the name of “stone lacquer” because they looked like lacquer 
but seeped from the stones. 
The domestic uses of petroleum products seem to have been confined to 
modest applications such as oil lamps and oil-fired torches, but they were 
used on a large scale for breaking up rocks by fire. Since burning oil could 
burn in water, boulders in harbours were sometimes broken apart by 
having burning oil poured over them. |

Model of Su Song’s great astronomical 
clock of 1092. The framework has been 
left uncovered to reveal the mechanism. 
The original clock tower was 10 m high, 
with a power-driven armillary sphere at 
the top for observing the stars. Inside the 
tower, a celestial globe (B) turned in 
synchronization with the sphere. The 
central element was the escapement 
(D, and detail below), which was turned 
clockwise by water or mercury pouring 
from the tank on the right. 


### 81704: The Mechanical clock

    
The Chinese did not invent the first clock of any kind, merely the first 
mechanical one. Water clocks had existed since Babylonian times, and the 
earliest Chinese got them indirectly from that earlier civilization of the 
Middle East. 
The world’s first mechanical clock was built by the Chinese Tantric 
Buddhist monk and mathematician Yixing (683-727). This was actually an 
astronomical instrument which served as a clock, rather than simply a 
clock. A contemporary text describes it: 
“[1t] was made in the image of the round heavens and on it were shown 
the lunar mansions in their order, the equator and the degrees of the 
heavenly circumference. Water, flowing into scoops, turned a wheel 
automatically, rotating it one complete revolution in one day and night [24 
hours]. Besides this, there were two rings fitted around the celestial sphere 
outside, having the sun and moon threaded on them, and these were made 
to move in circling orbit. ... And they made a wooden casing the surface of 
which represented the horizon, since the instrument was half sunk in it. It 
permitted the exact determinations of the time of dawns and dusks, full and 
new moons, tarrying and hurrying. Moreover, there were two wooden 
jacks standing on the horizon surface, having one a bell and the other a 
drum in front of it, the bell being struck automatically to indicate the 
hours, and the drum being beaten automatically to indicate the quarters. 
All these motions were brought about by machinery within the casing, 
each depending on wheels and shafts, hooks, pins and interlocking rods, 
stopping devices and locks checking mutually [i.e. the escapement]”. 
Yixing’s clock was, like water clocks, subject to the vicissitudes of the 
weather. In order to keep the water in them from freezing, torches 
generally burnt beside them. Therefore, in the next great clock of which we 
have accounts in China, mercury was substituted for water because of the 
freezing problem. This clock was built by Zhang Sixun in 976 AD. Zhang 
Sixun’s clock was apparently much larger than Yixing’s. It was certainly far 
more complex. The dynastic history of the time describes it: 
“... a tower of three storeys each over 3 metres in height, within which 
was concealed all the machinery. It was round at the top to symbolize the 
heavens and square at the bottom to symbolize the earth. Below there was 
set up the lower wheel, lower shaft, and the framework base. There were 
also horizontal wheels, vertical wheels fixed sideways, and slanting wheels; 
bearings for fixing them in place; a central stopping device and a smaller 
stopping device [i.e. the escapement] with a main transmission shaft. Seven 
jacks rang bells on the left, struck a large bell on the right; and beat a drum 
in the middle to indicate clearly the passing of the quarter-hours. Each day 
and night [i.e. each 24 hours] the machinery made one complete revolution, 
and the seven luminaries moved their positions around the ecliptic. Twelve 
other wooden jacks were also made to come out at each of the double- 
hours, one after the other, bearing tablets indicating the time...” 
All of these efforts were preparatory for the greatest of all Chinese 
medieval clocks, the “Cosmic Engine” of Su Song, built in the year 1092. 
Su Song’s clock was actually an astronomical clock tower more than 
10 metres high, like the previous one of Zhang. But on top of Su Song’s 
tower was additionally a huge bronze power-driven astronomical instru- 
ment called an armillary sphere, with which one could observe the 
positions of the stars. A celestial globe inside the tower turned in synchro- 
nization with this sphere above, so that the two could constantly be 
compared. We are told that the observations made on the demonstrational 
globe inside and by the observational sphere above “agreed like the two 
halves of a tally”. 
On the front of the tower was a pagoda structure of five storeys, each 
having a door through which mannikins and jacks appeared ringing bells 
and gongs and holding tablets to indicate the hours and other special times 
of the day and night. All of these time-indicators were operated by the 
same giant clock machinery which simultaneously turned the sphere and 
the globe. 
Knowledge of the principles of Su Song’s clock spreading to Europe led 
to the development of mechanical clocks in the West two centuries later. Hl

### 81705: Paper money

Paper money 
The Chinese invented paper money at the end of the eighth or beginning of 
the ninth century AD. Its original name was “flying money” because it was 
so light and could blow out of one’s hand. The first paper money was, 
strictly speaking, a draft rather than real money. A merchant could deposit 
his cash in the capital, receiving a paper certificate which he could then 
exchange for cash in the provinces. This private merchant enterprise was 
quickly taken over by the government in 812. The technique was then used 
for the forwarding of local taxes and revenues to the capital. Paper 
“exchange certificates” were also in use. These were issued by government 
officials in the capital and were redeemable elsewhere in commodities such 
as salt and tea. 
Real paper money, used as a medium of exchange and backed by 
deposited cash, apparently came into being early in the tenth century, in 
the southern province of Sichuan, as a private enterprise. Early in the 
eleventh century the government authorized sixteen private businesses or 
“banks” to issue notes of exchange; but in 1023 the government usurped 
this private enterprise and set up its own official agency to issue bank notes 
of various denominations which were backed by cash deposits. The money 
issued by this bank had printed on it a notice to the effect that it was good 
for only three years, and gave the dates. By 1107, notes were being printed 
with multiple blocks in no less than six colours. 
The issuing of paper money by the government took on enormous 
proportions. By 1126, seventy million strings (each string being equal to 
one thousand pieces of “cash”) had been officially issued. Vast amounts of 
this paper money were not backed by any deposits, and a horrifying 
inflation occurred. 
Another problem which soon arose was counterfeiting. Since anyone 
can print on pieces of paper, the authority must make the processes of 
manufacture of its paper money so intricate that they cannot be exactly 
reproduced. Complex manufacturing secrets were thus adopted quite 
early, and included multiple colourings, immensely complex designs, and a 
mixture of fibres in the paper: The basic material for the paper of paper 
money was the bark of mulberry trees, and silk was sometimes incorpor- 
ated. One could hand in soiled or worn-out notes for new ones, but had to 
pay the small cost of the printing of the replacement. 
When the Mongols came to power in China, they issued a quaint form of 
paper money called “silk notes”. The deposits behind this currency were 
not precious metals but bundles of silk yarn. By 1294, Chinese silk notes 
were being used as money as far afield as Persia. In 1965, two specimens of 
“silk notes” were found by archaeologists. 
Paper money under the later Ming Dynasty was not so effective. The 
Ming issued in 1375 a new note called the “Precious Note of Great Ming”. 
It was issued in one denomination only throughout the 200 years in which 
it was the legal tender. This was naturally very inconvenient for all 
commercial purposes, although copper coins were permitted to circulate, 
and these must have provided the small change necessary in everyday life. 
Through inflation, the Precious Note gradually lost its value and was 
replaced by silver. |

### 81706: Declination of the earth's magnetic field

Declination of the Earth’s magnetic field 
The Earth’s magnetic field is oriented slightly askew from what might be 
expected. The magnetic North Pole is about 1,900 km from the geo- 
graphical true north of the planet. The difference between a finger pointing 
at the true geographical North Pole and a compass needle pointing at the 
magnetic North Pole is known as the angle of declination or variation; itis 
not constant, and continually shifts. By the eighth or ninth century AD at 
the latest, the Chinese had discovered this magnetic declination. 
As Needham says, in doing so the Chinese were “antedating European 
knowledge of the declination by some six centuries. The Chinese were 
theorizing about the declination before Europe even knew of the polar- 
ity....” The magnetic compass and the polarity of the Earth’s field are not 
mentioned in any Western writing until 1190 AD, and the Chinese had had 
the compass for a good fifteen hundred years before that. In his Dream 
Pool Essays of 1086, the medieval Chinese scientist Shen Gua wrote on 
magnetic declination that “Magicians rub the point of a needle with a 
lodestone; then itis able to point to the south. But it always inclines slightly 
to the east, and does not point directly at the south.” [| 
  
    
  
  
  


### 81707: The Wheelbarrow

The wheelbarrow 
The wheelbarrow was apparently invented in south-western China in the 
first century BC by a semi-legendary personage called Guo Yu. 
The oldest surviving picture of a wheelbarrow dates from about 100 AD. 
It is a frieze relief from a tomb-shrine excavated near Xuzhou (Jiangsu) 
which very clearly shows a wheelbarrow with a man sitting on it. There are 
several other illustrations from this period, the Han Dynasty, indicating 
that wheelbarrows were increasingly commonplace. 
The earliest descriptions of the construction of wheelbarrows are 
couched in coy and obscure language. For the first few centuries, wheel- 
barrows were of great military importance, and specifics of their construc- 
tion were closely guarded secrets. Some carried men on seats, and others 
carried supplies. They were also used to form protective movable barriers 
against cavalry charges. The ingenuity of the Chinese at exploiting the 
wheelbarrow was limitless, and they were even given sails, with which they 
could achieve speeds over land or ice of 60 kilometres per hour. 
A large variety of designs existed, some with wheels in the dead centre, 
with the weight resting entirely on the axle, and others with wheels 
forward. Some had tiny wheels, some had huge ones. Additional small 
wheels were sometimes fitted in front to ease the passage over potholes and 
other obstacles. Practically all shapes and sizes of wheelbarrow existed— 
and still exist—in China. [|

### 81708: Lacquer

  
— 30 _— 
Lacquer 
Lacquer was in use by at least the thirteenth century BC in China. Queen 
Fu Hao of that date was buried in a lacquered coffin, discovered when her 
intact tomb was excavated in 1976 at Anyang. Needham has written that: 
“Lacquer may be said to have been the most ancient industrial plastic 
known to man.” 
Lacquer is obtained rather like rubber, by tapping the sap of tree trunks. 
The lacquer tree (Rhus vernicifera, recently named verniciflua by bota- 
nists) is indigenous to China but not to Europe. It is particularly common 
in central China, growing at altitudes between 900 metres and 
2,000 metres. The trees are tapped in summer and left to recover after a 
period of five to seven years, though in some cases they are cut down after 
tapping, and an inferior lacquer is obtained from their branches. The 
largest amount of lacquer a tree can produce is about 50 grams. 
Lacquer is a plastic varnish which has remarkable powers of preserva- 
tion, strength and durability. Strong acids and alkalis cannot damage it; it 
cannot be affected by heat less than 200°-250°C; it cannot be damaged by 
water or other liquids; it 1s insoluble to most solvents; and it is resistant to 
bacterial attack. 
Lacquer was used for kitchen utensils thousands of years ago in China. 
Wood, bamboo or cloth utensils coated with many layers of thin lacquer 
formed the standard dinner service for rich Chinese in place of bronze 
vessels. They were able to withstand the heat of cooking and serving of 
food as well as metal. Chinese emperors gave lacquered articles to their 
officials as recognition for their services, and the monetary value of 
lacquerware actually exceeded that of bronzes. 
Lacquer was used in China for furniture, screens, pillows and boxes of 
all sorts. It was worn as bonnets and shoes. Weapon accessories, such as 
sword scabbards, bows and shields were made of it. Lacquers were often 
inlaid with gold and silver or tortoiseshell. The fluidity of the lacquered 
surface when applied made possible a form of Chinese decoration which 
was as free and spontaneous as could be imagined, and this had a major 
impact on ancient Chinese art. 
The lacquer industry in ancient China was highly organized, in the 
traditional Chinese bureaucratic way. There were both private and state 
lacquer manufacturing centres. There is a lacquered wood wine cup which 
canbe dated precisely to the year 4 AD by an extraordinary inscription 
which, besides giving the date of manufacture, lists seven artisans involved 
in making the cup and five other officials of the company. Twelve people to 
produce a single cup, nearly half of them functionaries who perhaps never

incisions in a lacquer bowl

very like the modern industrial production-line. 
As early as the second century BC, the Chinese had made important 
chemical discoveries about lacquer. They found a way to keep it from 
going hard by evaporation—they threw crabs into lacquer to keep it liquid! 
Crustacean tissue does in fact contain powerful chemicals which inhibit 
certain enzymes, including the one which makes lacquer solidify! 
Needham comments on this bizarre affair as follows: 
“There can be no doubt that the ancient Chinese, before the second 
century BC, had accidentally discovered a powerful laccase inhibitor. ... So 
great an interference with the course of nature, analagous to the arrest of a 
spontaneously occurring rigidification and ageing process, must -have 
seemed highly significant to the alchemists, preoccupied as they were by 
the preservation of supple youth and the postponement or elimination of 
ankylosis and death.” 
Not only did the perpetual liquefaction of lacquer pose a model for 
immortality, in this proto-industrial biochemistry, but lacquer accompa- 
nied a Chinese from cradle to grave—he would be fed as a baby from 
lacquer vessels with lacquer ladles, and in death he would be buried in a 
beautifully ornamented lacquer coffin. u

### 81710: The First contour transport canal

The first contour transport canal 
The world’s first contour transport canal, the Magic Canal (Lingqu), was 
constructed in China in the third century BC. This was indeed a most 
impressive pioneering achievement. It was constructed by the engineer Shi 
Lu on the orders of the Emperor Qin Shih Huangdi. The impetus for this 
innovative type of canal was to assist in supplying the emperor’s armies 
sent south in 219 BC to conquer the people of Yue. We are told by the great 
historian Sima Qian that: 
“[the emperor] sent the Commanders (Zhao) Tuo and Tu Zhu to lead 
forces of fighting-men on boats with deck-castles to the south to conquer 
the countries of the hundred tribes of Yue. He also ordered the Superinten- 
dent (Shi) Lu to cut a canal so that supplies of grain could be sent forward 
far into the region of Yue.” 
The Magic Canal is just over 32 kilometres long. Its chief interest is thus 
not its length, which is unexceptional. The construction of the Magic 
Canal, linking as it did two rivers flowing in opposite directions, made 
possible the continuous inland navigation of barge transport for a distance 
of 2,000 kilometres in a direct line, from the 40th to the 22nd parallel. One 
could thus sail inland from the latitude of Beijing in the north as far as 
Canton and the sea—to what is today Hong Kong. The Magic Canal was 
the final link in the chain. 
The problem that had to be overcome was that the River Xiang with its 
source at Mount Haiyang, flowed northwards, while the nearby River Li 
flowed southwards. If only one could get a boat from one to the other!— 
for the Xiang led eventually to the Chang Jiang and the Li joined a tributary 
of the West River and led to Canton. Near the little village of Xing’an, the 
Xiang and the Li, in a landscape of limestone hills, are only 5 kilometres 
apart. Simply joining them was not sufficient. Another solution had to be 
found. 
There was a saddle in the hills at this point along which a canal could be 
dug. The rivers themselves were unruly and a lateral transport canal had to 
be dug alongside the Xiang river for 2.4 kilometres at a more even gradient 
than the river itself had. At the other end, some 22 kilometres of the Li river 
had to be canalized in order to regulate it and make navigation possible. 
Only with the two rivers “tamed” at either end like this could a 5-kilometre 
canal then be dug to join them. A mound shaped like a snout was 
constructed in the middle of the swiftly running Xiang to divide its flow, 
and lead off much of the rushing water. It was backed up by two spillways, 
and further spillways were made lower down. Several bridges at Xing’an 
were constructed to cross the canal, which was 1 metre deep and 4.5 metres 
wide. The system of division of the waters and spillways resulted in only 
about three-tenths of the water from the Xiang entering the connecting 
canal, so that it was not overwhelmed. 
By being built along the contours of the saddle in the hills, the canal was 
nearly level. Eighteen flash-lock gates were there by the ninth century at 
the latest, reducing the number of towers needed for barges by the tenth or 
eleventh century. The Magic Canal came to be considered a sacred 
waterway, with a dragon as its governing spirit. A modern railway bridge 
goes right over the old Magic Canal, which is still used. |

This type of articulated junk used for 
transporting freight was specially 
designed to negotiate the many sharp 
bends and shallows of the Grand Canal, 
animmense waterway some 
1,800 km long which was completed in 
the 14th century. The prow and the stern 
of the long, narrow boat can be separated 
and sailed independently. The mast can 
be lowered to enable the junk to pass 
beneath low bridges. Below, the Grand

### 81711: Immunology

Immunology 
The origins of inoculation against smallpox in China are mysterious. We know that 
the technique originated in the southern province of Sichuan, where there is a 
famous mountain called Emeishan which is known for its connections with both 
Buddhism and Taoism. The Taoist alchemists who lived as hermits in the caves of 
that mountain possessed the secret of smallpox inoculation in the tenth 
century AD. 
The technique first came to public attention when the eldest son of the Prime 
Minister Wang Dan (957-1017) died of smallpox. Wang desperately wished to 
prevent this happening to other members of his family, so he summoned physi- 
cians, wise men and magicians from all over the Empire to find some remedy. One 
Taoist hermit came from Emeishan. This monk or nun brought the technique of 
inoculation and introduced it to the capital. 
Inoculation has certain dangers which set it apart from the later technique of 
vaccination. When one is inoculated, one has the live virus inserted into one’s body. 
When the process is successful, one is immune for life. But the process can simply 
be one of direct exposure to the disease, so that one ends up with smallpox. With 
vaccination, the immunity conferred is only temporary, so that vaccinations have to 
be given every few years as “boosters”. This is because vaccination uses dead viruses 
or some other kind of denatured virus (perhaps a related one) which cannot actually 
give oné the disease. 
At first sight it looks as if inoculation against smallpox must have been madness. 
Were not people just being given smallpox every time? The answer is no. And here 
we find the subtlety of the Chinese inoculators to be truly astounding. They 
practised a variety of methods for the attenuation of the deadly virus, so that the 
chances of getting the disease were minimized. First of all, there was a strong 
prohibition against taking the smallpox material from people who actually had the 
disease. The Chinese conceived of inoculation as a “transplant” of poxy material 
tmagined as being like beansprouts which were just germinating. “To inoculate” in 
Chinese was called zhong dou or zhong miao, meaning “to implant the germs”, or 
“implant the sprouts”. 
The method used was to put the poxy material on a plug of cotton, which was 
then inserted into the nose. The pox was thus absorbed through the mucous 
membrane of the nose and by breathing. (The technique of scratching the skin and 
putting the pox on the scratch seems to have developed long afterwards, possibly in 
Central Asia as the technique spread westwards.) 
Ideally, inoculators chose poxy material from persons who had been inoculated 
themselves and had developed a few scabs. They also knew the difference between 
the two types of smallpox, Variola major and Variola minor, and they chose 
material from the latter, which was a less virulent form. Indeed, the favourite source 
of material was from the scabs of someone who had been inoculated with material 
from somebody who had been inoculated with material from somebody who had 
been inoculated.... In other words, a several-generations attenuation of the virus 
through multiple inoculations. 
But there were other artificial methods used to attenuate the virus even further, 
so that it would be safer still. Here is one account from a work on Transplanting the 
Smallpox by Zhang Yan in the year 1741: 
“Method of storing the material. Wrap the scabs carefully in paper and put them 
into a small container bottle. Cork it tightly so that the activity is not dissipated. 
The container must not be exposed to sunlight or warmed beside a fire. It is best to 
carry it for some time on the person so that the scabs dry naturally and slowly. The 
container should be marked clearly with the date on which the contents were taken 
from the patient. 
“In winter the material has yang potency within it, so it remains active even after 
being kept from thirty to forty days. But in summer the yang potency will be lost in 
approximately twenty days. The best material is that which had not been left too 
long, for when the yang potency is abundant it will give a ‘take’ with nine persons 
out of ten; but as it gets older it gradually loses its activity, and finally it will not 
work at all. In situations where new scabs are rare and the requirement is great, it is 
possible to mix new scabs with the more aged ones, but in this case more of the 
powder should be blown into the nostril when the inoculation is done.” 
Needham comments on this and similar passages: 
“Thus the general system was to keep the inoculum sample for a month or more 
at body temperature (37°C) or rather less. This would certainly have had the effect 
of heat-inactivating some 80 per cent of the living virus particles, but since their 
dead protein would have been present, a strong stimulus to interferon production 
as well as antibody formation would have been given when inoculation was done.” 
In other words, 80 per cent of the smallpox viruses with which the Chinese were 
inoculated would have been dead ones which could not have given anyone 
smallpox. Instead, they would (as with vaccination) have stimulated the body to 
produce antibodies against smallpox. n 
      
  
The concept of vaccination appeared in 
China in the 10th century, when 
inoculation against smallpox was 
practised. Engraving of a child suffering 
from smallpox, above, is taken from the 
Golden Mirror of Medicine (1743).
