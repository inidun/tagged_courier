They are the ultimate entertainment destinations: walled 
kingdoms outside space and time 
where the weary can give free rein to the pleasure principle 
and consume in a holiday spirit 
ike a cosmos where the light never dims, shopping malls play multiple 
roles in modern-day culture: that of a Godless paradise, of a timeless space, 
of an absolute getaway without landmarks. The shopping mall is an entet- 
tal t venue, and its greatest achievement lies in cultivating the fantasy 
that on has stopped existing in some way without ever really dying. With 
A round music, controlled climate and round-the-clock operations, 
the polished halls of a mall stand as a metaphor for a happy trip to nowhere 
in particular—a perfect holiday. 
In contrast to the places where people work, the shopping mall acts as an 
oasis where the world of holidays is in incessant rebirth and regeneration, as an 
enclosed space where time never acquires a restrictive dimension, where sen- 
sations obey the calls of seduction, availability, flattery and reward instead of 
duty and penance. Streets in shopping malls are circuits turned towards providing 
entertainment or pleasure, just as holidays, at least in their intent. The world’s 
largest mall—Canada’s West Edmonton in the western province of Alberta— 
covers a space equivalent to 100 football pitches, and according to Jeremy 
Rifkin, author of The Age of Access, contains the largest indoor amusement park 
in the world, the largest indoor waterpark, a golf course, 800 shops, 11 depart- 
ment stores, 110 restaurants, an ice-skating rink, 13 nightclubs and 20 cinemas. 
The plans for the planet’s very first mall were drawn up in 1924 by 
J. C. Nichols in Kansas City, and the centre that resulted, with its Mediter- 
ranean architecture, tiled fountains and cast-iron balconies, became the pro- 
totype for those built after World War II. All shopping malls currently 
boast similar fountains, waterfalls, tropical plants, ocean blue patios, marble »

sightlines and the latest pop tunes. This host of links between the 
holiday and the shopping centre helps alleviate the distress 
caused by regimented time. 
There are no clocks in shopping centres, and no impa- 
tience over wasting valuable time. In contrast to nature’s bound- 
less space, the mall offers an illuminated cavern that has neither 
beginning nor end, but is shaped like a Moebius strip. Within it, 
time is shattered,and what is left in place is space made fun. 
The average American,according to sociologist William 
Kowinski,author of the The Malling of America, visits a shop- 
ping mall every ten days, and spends over an hour and a quarter 
there on each occasion; the most frequently given reason for this 
pilgrimage is a desire for “entertainment.” Indeed the shop- 
ping malls of the future have been billed as entertainment 
centres in which people will be able to shed the burden of their 
own selves. Minnesota’s Mall of America,which 
until just recently was the largest in the world, is 
visited by over 45 million people each year, we 
among them package tourists from Australia. 
The place has become a kind of sacred site of the 
sort discussed by the late Romanian philoso- 
pher Mircea Eliade. It has the same power of 
attraction as Mecca or the Vatican, where one 
has to go at least once in a lifetime. 
Working is the mundane side of life, but 
being a consumer is potentially its most poetic or 
symbolic pay-off. While the average worker is 
asked to be realistic and pragmatic, consump- 
tion can stimulate every possible dream, even 
the dream of salvation in the form of liberation 
from the constraints of space and time. 
Nothing seems to threaten this walled 
kingdom protected by security guards and wat- 
ched over by increasing numbers of closed cir- 
cuit cameras. Sociologist Peter Hemingway has 
argued that the mission of mall architects and 
designers consists in providing a sugared dream, 
where one can buy, play and experience without 
ever having to go outside—where one can 
change experience like one switches television 
channels, using the credit card as the all-powerful 
Open Sesame. 
Loudspeakers, closed circuit cameras, video 
recorders and monitors are integral parts of a 
system that is aimed at the production of a totally 
autonomous universe. Inside the mall’s walls, it 
can be spring even if snow is falling on the streets 
outside, or autumn though it is baking hot under 
the summer sun. Weather has no real meaning,

and is only a pretext for a change in fashion. Different segments 
of the mall can resemble Thailand, the Tyrol, China or Canada, 
since its inner space has been transformed into a dolled-up uni- 
verse, just like paradise. In Scottsdale, Arizona, the Borgata repro- 
duces the Tuscan village of San Gimignano in the middle of the 
desert, while Olde Mistic Village in Connecticut is a carbon copy 
of the main street in a New England town from around the start 
of the 17th century. The vogue for copying, a key trait of global 
society, has forged an alliance with the shopping mall in its bid to 
make places and dates vanish. In the inaugural ceremony for 
West Edmonton, one of the centre’s creators, Nader Ghermezion, 
declared that people would no longer have to “go to New York, 
Paris, Disneyland or Hawaii. We can offer you all that here!” 
Assembled under one roof, built to copy the best of all 
worlds, with a selection of the best the globe can offer. Whereas 
any given shop in a city has had to choose its urban location in 
accordance with historical and geographical dictates, the shop- 
ping mall is free from any such demographic tradition—indeed 
itis free from history entirely. The main criterion for a mall’s loca- 
tion is simple:how fast people can get there.

The mall is constantly changing its appearance, anchoring 
itself to an evolving present in a magical process that eludes all 
threat of death. Freed from the pull of gravity, the mall is now 
society’s most revered safety valve, with such importance as a 
social and political symbol that terrorists intent on disrupting 
normal life choose it as a prime target. By planting a bomb in 
a mall, they attack the contemporary vision of dreamland. In this 
“spaceship,” the city’s most benevolent and leisurely impulses 
are now distilled. The world of work, illness and repression 
has been extracted; all that remains is soft-flowing leisure and 
purchasing power. 
Independent, beyond the pull of gravity, open all hours, 
without prisons, sweet-smelling, tropical and radiant,the shop- 
ping mall is a parody of utopia. Mornings are the same as after- 
noons, Sundays as Mondays, China as Argentina, Rome as New 
York; potential purchases are in abundance, changing only to 
match the spiral of constant progress and advertising them- 
selves as the best items going. Faced with this spectacle, the 
visitor is invited to partake of the profusion as if he or she were 
on holiday and about to dive into the sea.Buying becomes like 
dipping in the ocean—disappearing, forgetting oneself and eve- 
rything else. All becomes one in the newest passion of the day.

cologists and rural landowners 
remember 2000 as the year of 
ait tion. Both wanted to decide the 
messages supported the country’s non- 
governmental organizations (NGOs) 
and blocked an amendment to the 
national forestry regulations that would 
have increased by a 
quarter the number Brazilian public 
fertile land. There are more than 100 mil- 
lion hectares of unused land alone in the 
sertdo,” the scrubland that covers a 
quarter of the country. Amazonia has lost 
60 percent of its original vegetation 
through the spread of soybean farming 
and especially pasture land for cattle. 
Another major Brazilian newspaper, 
O Estado de Sdo Paulo, summed up the 
worries about the future with a headline 
that asked: “What kind of air are we going 
to breathe?” The popularity of the eco- 
logists’ campaign could be seen through 
the fact that characters in the cartoon 
strip Monica, which appears in dozens of 
newspapers, were dressed in mourning 
clothes as a sign of protest. 
“For the first time

ting down more trees would not help 
reduce hunger. Even more important was 
the finding that in a country where few 
people read newspapers, 63 percent said 
they had closely followed the debate, 
mostly through radio and television reports. 
The financial press was firmly against 
the amendment too. “There is not a single 
argument that can justify this disastrous 
measure,” said the influential newspaper 
Gazeta Mercantil. “Brazil has plenty of

region’s most respected 
NGOs.“Everyone understood that a public 
resource was about to be destroyed without 
generating any kind of development.” 
Brazilian public opinion, which is now 
in tune with what many international 
bodies and organizations have been advo- 
cating for years, has switched as a result of 
the economic disaster of unregulated log- 
ging. Most of the destroyed forest areas 
have become pasture land or soybean, 
palm, coffee and black pepper plantations. 


### 121200: Brazil turns its back on the Amazon trade

il turns its back on 
the Amazon trade 
For the first time, the Brazilian public has joined the ecological campaign 
These foreign crops, which are ill-suited to 
poor soil and heavy rains, have had a hard 
time growing over two-thirds of the defo- 
rested area. Half the 20 million hectares of 
pasture are also in a miserable state. 
Low yields made farmers look for new 
land, causing deforestation to increase 
year after year—always in vain, however, 
because 78 percent of the soil was too 
acidic and had little natural fertility. Along 
with this vicious circle, there were trans- 
port problems. It takes several days by 
river to get from the ranches deep in the 
jungle to a port from where crops can be 
sent out to domestic and foreign markets. 
So although 14 percent of Amazo- 
nia’s virgin forest has been destroyed, it is 
still a poor area and its 20 million inha- 
bitants—three-quarters of whom live in 
towns—only produce seven percent of 
the country’s GDP. Per capita income 
there is below the national average, while 
the region’s main export, Brazil nuts, is 
only worth about $3 million, far behind 
the $230 million earned from the urban 
production of syrups for soft drinks. 
The waste of sawmills and 
the defiance of loggers 
A recent survey carried out by 
IMAZON for the World Bank showed 
why farming in the region is so difficult.It 
noted that 18 percent of the Brazilian part 
of the Amazon was given over to cattle-rai- 
sing. That area, in the far south of the 
Amazon, is the most deforested part and 
has a low annual rainfall of 1,800 mm. To 
the north is a mixed zone that has a little 
more rain and where farming is still fea- 
sible, despite a host of insects and plant 
diseases. In the remaining 45 percent of 
Brazilian Amazonia, where heavy rain 
falls each day, the only viable large-scale 
economic activity is forestry. “Here and 
inthe mixed zone, logging is as profitable 
as agriculture,” says Verissimo, one of the 
experts involved in the survey. “That shows 
forestry is the best thing for Amazonia.” 
But the timber industry has not 
managed to make use of this natural 
resource without destroying it. Nearly 
three years ago a European Commission 
report blamed the industry for 72 per- 
cent of deforestation, and said its activities »

were much more harmful to the forests 
than felling by farmers or ranchers. The 
sawmills also waste an enormous amount 
of timber, sometimes as much as two- 
thirds of the trees felled. Even worse, most 
timber firms do not obey the law. “The 
strategic affairs ministry says about 80 
percent of the timber is illegally chopped 
down in the region and forest manage- 
ment schemes are mostly ignored,” says a 
survey put together by Greenpeace. 
What are these schemes? First, there is 
the battle to keep current forestry regula- 
tions on the books and strictly enforce 
them. During the 1960s, each landowner 
was required to preserve 50 percent of the 
forests on his land. As deforestation sped 
up, parliament decreed in 1996 that 80 per- 
cent must be preserved. President Fer- 
nando Henrique Cardoso sided with the 
ecologists, saying that “forestry regulations 
are needed to ensure the survival of Ama- 
zonia, which belongs to Brazilians but also 
to humanity as a whole.” 
A haven for biodiversity is the 
last farming frontier 
Brazil contains the planet’s richest 
biodiversity and the widest range of plant 
species. A sixth of all the world’s birds 
live there, an eighth of all amphibians, 
one in every 11 mammals and a 15th of 
the world’s reptiles. Five thousand diffe- 
rent kinds of trees grow in the Amazon, 
against North America’s 650. 
Another scheme currently on the 
books is the Pilot Programme to Pre- 
serve Tropical Forests, funded by the G7 
countries, the European Union and the 
Brazilian government,which have toge- 
ther contributed $280 million to support 
sustainable use of the forests. The pro- 
gramme is the biggest multilateral invest- 
ment in the environment ever made in a 
single country. 
1 2 The Unesco Courier - November 2000 
The nine states making up the Amazon, which spans 5.5 million km?2. 
  
  
As well as these schemes, there is the 
Amazon Region Protected Areas Pro- 
gramme, backed by Brazil, the World 
Bank and other international bodies, such 
as the World Wildlife Fund and the World 
Bank Forest Alliance Programme. It aims 
to convert 10 percent of Amazonia into 
protected areas. Twelve million hectares 
are already protected,and the goal is to 
increase that to 37 million hectares—an 
area the size of Germany. 
All these conservation measures are 
opposed in varying degrees by Amazo- 
nian landowners, who see the region’s 5.1 
million sq kms as the last agricultural fron- 
tier, with unlimited possibilities for growth. 
They say society owes them something for 
having stopped felling on part of their lands 
to help safeguard the environment, and 
are demanding monetary compensation. 
An all-party parlia- 
mentary commission, 
headed by the pro- 
government centre-right 
deputy Mosir Miche- 
letto, tabled a draft law 
at the end of 1999 to 
allow a very flexible 
interpretation of the 
forestry regulations. 
Micheletto’s bill stipu- 
lated that half of Ama- 
zonia’s ranchland should 
remain uncleared, but 
that Amazonian state 
governments would be 
able to grant 
special logging conces- 
sions on a case by case 
basis. Estates of less than 
25 hectares, meanwhile, 
would be exempted 
from all conservation 
regulations. 
During a 
demonstration in favour of the new pro- 
posal last February, 600 members of the 
National Agricultural Federation made a 
nationalistic protest against what they 
called “the harmful interference of 
national and foreign ecological organi- 
zations in drafting punitive laws which 
hinder national development.” 
Environment Minister José Sarney 
Filho, the National Environment Council 
(CONAMA) and the NGOs responded 
by pointing out the need to continue pre- 
serving 80 percent of the Amazonian 
forest. For six months, they organized 
public debates all over Brazil. 
Battles among the region's 
shareholders 
The ecologists overwhelmingly sup- 
port the government’s stand. Their main 
criticism is that the scrubland areas 
of the Amazon must also be safeguarded, 
since—contrary to most people’s 
beliefs—jungle is not the only native 
vegetation in the Amazon. Environ- 
mental NGOs say it is not enough to 
leave only 35 percent of the ranchland in 
this ecosystem untouched, as CONAMA 
proposes, let alone descend to the 20 per- 
cent threshold in the Micheletto pro- 
posal Either way, it would seem hard to 
ignore Brazilian public opinion, which 
now broadly agrees with arguments that 
until recently were dismissed as unpa- 
triotic and slavish to foreign interests. m

### 121201: Where the riches lie

PLANET?)   
Brazil turns its back on the Amazon trade 
WHERE THE RICHES LIE 
The preservation of forest areas can only be funded through regulated and sustainable 
use of the rest of the Amazonian jungle 
  BY DIANA ALVES 
BRAZILIAN JOURNALIST SPECIALIZING 
INTHE ENVIRONMENT 
t stake are not just the millions of 
square kilometres of jungle or the 
14,000 million cubic metres of timber gro- 
wing in the region, or even the fact that it 
is a biological reserve that contains a third 
of the world’s plant and animal species. 
Behind the dispute that has set off so 
many debates in parliament over much of 
the past year are advocates of two very dif- 
ferent models of development. 
Rural landowners naturally want to 
continue chopping down trees to clear 
land for cattle or agriculture. Environ- 
mental organizations want to protect spe- 
cific areas of tropical forest as agents of cli- 
mate regulation, a source of future 
medicines, a place for scientific research 
and home to many indigenous tribes, while 
leaving the logging industry to use the 
rest of the jungle in a sustainable fashion. 
The economic feasibility of the lan- 
downers’ stance has already been chal- 
lenged by the facts, while the ecologists’ 
plans are only feasible if accompanied 
by a myriad of other measures. Ecotou- 
rism is one possible source of revenue, as 
is use of the jungle’s pharmaceutical or 
biotechnological re- 
SOUrces. 
3 But the region’s main 
income would still come 
from logging. There has 
been significant progress 
in this activity, such as the 
planting of a million hec- 
tares of trees for timber 
in the past seven years. 
A score of Amazonian 
sawmills have pledged to 
rotate their use of forest 
areas and allow the 
forests to regenerate. 
One such company, Mil 
Madeireiras, was 
awarded a quality certifi- 
cate by the Forest Ste- 
wardship Council (FSC), 
the chief monitor of sus- 
tainable forestry deve- 
lopment, after dividing 
55,000 hectares into 30 
lots with a rotation   
system to ensure that each lot was only 
touched every 30 years. The firm also has 
a 25,000 hectare reserve which it pre- 
serves permanently. Another 17 compa- 
nies are willing to follow the example of 
Mil Madeireiras and hope to get certifi- 
cates from the FSC. Among them is Cikel, 
the region’s biggest sawmill. 
But “certified” companies such as these 
are still rare among hundreds of semi-legal 
competitors. Most of the 1,600 sawmills 
in the Brazilian Amazonia are small or 
medium-sized outfits that account for 70 
percent of total production. “Illegal 
timber will always be cheaper,” says Adal- 
berto Verissimo, a biologist with the Insti- 
tute of People and the Environment in 
Amazonia. He is 
counting on two

Amazonian tribes. One of the best examples 
is a cure for high blood pressure, Capoten, 
made by scientists (at the pharmaceutical 
company Bristol-Meyers Squibb) from the 
venom of the jararacd snake. 
A couple of years ago the government 
asked a group of scientists to focus their 
work on Amazonia. One of the group’s 
main conclusions was that the region 
could support all kinds of activity, from 
agriculture and logging to extracting 
natural resources. Even the much-criti- 
cized pasture lands were said to be tole- 
rable. According to Roberto Kishinami, 
head of Greenpeace-Brazil, “the best

Apart from logging, the possibility of 
planting new areas that will act as carbon 
sinks (in an effort to limit climate change 
in accordance with the Kyoto Protocol), 
has sparked the interest of several of the 
region’s landowners. A pilot project is 
under way on the island of Bananal, in the 
far south of the region, sponsored by a 
foundation linked to the U.S. electricity 
multinational American Electric System. 
This aims to preserve 200,000 hectares, as 
well as plant 240,000 saplings and recover 
800 hectares each year. 
Biotechnology is the region’s third big 
investment opportunity. In the coming year, 
a centre for research into the Amazon 
region’s resources will open in Manaus. This 
is urgently needed because foreign labora- 
tories are already developing thousands of 
with publication of the annual defores- 
tation figures by the National Institute 
for Space Research,INPE—figures that 
will tell whether ecologists or rural lan- 
downers have won the war of percen- 
tages. 
But another problem will remain: how 
to make the transition from a world of 
symbolic victories and defeats, of laws 
which are not obeyed,to one where the 
government manages to convert symbols 
into reality. n

lenge facing Armeido Maya, the former 
‘rector of the University of Timor who is 
now mu the country’s higher educa- 
tion on ~“If we could manage while 
occupied by Indonesia, just think what we 
can do now that we're free,” he declares. 
  
    
1 4 The Unesco Courier - November 2000 
Maya, 42, was born in East Timor 
under Portuguese rule. In 1975,only two 
weeks after gaining independence from 
Portugal, the country was occupied by 
Indonesia.“ had to give up my plans to 
enter the Jesuit school in Dili [the 
capital],” he says. “I was 18 and very keen 
to learn, but for two and a half years I 
chose to live in the jungle and the bush 
with my mother and two brothers as a 
member of the underground resistance.” 
When he left the Fretilin guerrillas 
and came back to Dili, he was tortured by 
the occupation forces. After agonizing 
about what to do with his life, he gave up 
the idea of becoming a priest though not 
his faith in East Timor’s independence. 
Today, the problems are different. 
“Ninety-five percent of school buildings 
were destroyed by the Indonesians a little 
over a year ago after the referendum that 
confirmed our wish for independence,” 
he says. Rebuilding a poor country is 
tough.“The help of the Catholic church 
has been very important,” says Maya, who 
spent five years at the Catholic University 
in Java reading history and geography. 
The East Timorese are 90 percent Catholic, 
and identify closely with a church that was 


### 121202: Teaching free Timor

Teaching free Timor 
Money may be tight, but East Timor’s school year began recently with plenty of enthusiasm. One of the 
people in charge discusses what lies in store 
on their side during the bloody 24-year 
Indonesian occupation, in which 300,000 
people were killed. As a result, the 1996 
Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Arch- 
bishop Carlos Ximenes Belo and the poli- 
tical leader José Ramos Horta. 
Starting from scratch: 
from language to history 
“The education system needs first 
aid,” says Maya. “To begin with, we want 
to teach computing, human rights, English 
and Portuguese. This is what we need for 
training and informal education.” The 
language problem in East Timor is espe- 
cially serious since almost everyone 
speaks the Bahasa of the Indonesian inva- 
ders, while the local Tetun language has a 
surprising number of dialects. “Bahasa is 
going to be replaced by Tetun and Por- 
tuguese in primary and secondary schools, 
and by Portuguese and English in higher 
education,” he says. 
Language classes, however, are jeo- 
pardized by some very basic flaws. “We 
could only begin the school year when 
classrooms had roofs and enough books 
and other materials,” says Maya, who also 
points to a lack of good teachers. “Half of

those who say they can teach primary 
and secondary courses would fail profes- 
sional tests.” 
Things are not much better in the uni- 
versity. “We have 5,000 people wanting to 
take courses in agronomy, education,eco- 
nomics or political science, which are our 
four faculties, but we only have 1,000 
places because 3,000 are already reserved 
for those whose studies were interrupted 
last year. Furthermore, we only have 90 
teachers for the four faculties” 
The curriculum has also caused a 
number of headaches. “We have to teach 
children the history of our country, but we 
need to do it with a book that is impartial 
and based on democratic values,” he 
observes. “We're working on a textbook 
with help from foreign teachers, which 
will have to be ready 
within a year.” Then 
it will be read under “We have to teach 
being frightened by snow!”Maya had to 
go into exile several times due to political 
fluctuations in East Timor, but his firm 
intention was always to return. 
But going home after the fall of 
former Indonesian dictator Suharto was 
no easy matter. “After the independence 
referendum on August 30th of last year, 
we had to hide in the mountains again,” 
he says. “I didn’t even have time to enjoy 
my honeymoon. But now I'm back,and 
this time for good.” Maya hopes many 
other students and ex-students share his 
desire to return. “Most who went to New 
Zealand and Australia to study will come 
back. I'm sure of that. We need them to 
build the country. Their skills are vital 
for our people and the thousands of chil- 
dren who have to go to school.” 
For the moment, 
life is still confused 
and unstable. Witness

rooms with dirt floors, children the history

Jacob Filomeno, who with a book that 
by three currencies— 
the U.S. dollar, which 
runs the refugee 
office, simply notes Is impartial” 
has been adopted 
as the official cur- 
that “every day we 
have 2,000 children 
gathered outside wanting to take classes.” 
UNICEF sent $490,000 worth of 
school supplies to East Timor, mainly in 
the form of $300 kits designed by 
UNESCO “that were a success in Somalia 
and Rwanda” according to Pilar Aguilar, 
the UNICEF representative in East 
Timor. “Each kit contains enough mate- 
rials for 80 pupils and a teacher in a class 
that can be held outdoors” 
Coping with a desperate situation does 
not faze Maya, whose only complaint is 
that he does not have time to play chess 
and to read. Outside his office, the alleys 
and streets are full of pigs, chickens and 
oxen while helicopters skim through the 
sky to anxious glances from people below. 
“Between 1993 and 1997, after retur- 
ning from further studies in sociology 
and economics in New Zealand,I was in 
charge of the University of Dili again 
and the situation was worse,” recalls 
Maya. “I don’t mean in terms of poverty, 
but in terms of freedom. The tyres of my 
car were slashed several times, I got death 
threats by phone. I had to go into exile in 
the United States, to Minnesota. There 1 
was, a man from the tropics, used to tem- 
peratures of more than 30° C, passing the 
time in some place where I remember 
rency, the Indonesian 
rupiah and the Aus- 
tralian dollar, both local currencies from 
neighbouring states. “Over the next year, 
we'll have elections and a local Timorese 
government will take over from the coun- 
try’s Brazilian administrator, Sergio Vieira 
de Mello,” says Maya. 
The present administration is a coali- 
tion that includes members of the 
National Council of Timorese Resistance 
(CNRT), such as Maya, who also works in 
the education ministry, and officials from 
the United Nations Transitional Admi- 
nistration in East Timor (UNTAET). 
“We're working against the clock,” says 
Maya. “As well as the help from UNICEE, 
we've also had $13 million from the World 
Bank that we’ve used for the most urgent 
repair work and to provide some trai- 
ning for teachers and pay their wages.” 
“Wages,” it should be said, is some- 
thing of a euphemism. Maya is ready to 
tackle all the problems that come his way, 
including hunger. He prefers not to talk 
about it, but UNICEF is also taking care 
of the most urgent food needs of pupils 
and teachers, some of whom are going 
to school on empty stomachs and are so 
tired that they cannot concentrate for 
long. “But at least we're free now,” says 
Maya with a smile. [|

wo trillion dollars or one-twentieth of global gross domestic pro- 
duct: this is what the world spends on education according to the 
most measured assessments. The private sector, which accounts 
for roughly a fifth of the amount, is determined to capture a 
larger share of this giant market (p.18). Riding on a neo-liberal 
wave, vaunting greater efficiency, innovation and knowledge of the 
job market, the corporate world is gaining unprecedented influence 
5 in running education and shaping its goals (pp. 19-22). In the 
United States, there is a groundswell of support for privatization 
and companies are starting to run public schools (pp.28-30). In Brazil, the Objetivo chain 
attracts close to 500,000 students, mostly from privileged backgrounds, while in India, pri- 
vate schools are winning marks for catering to the poor (pp. 23-26). Higher education is at 
the vanguard of the commercial drive, with online learning spurring multiple alliances to attract 
students able to pay for a prestigious offshore degree (pp. 26-27,31-32). But there are already 
lessons to be learnt from excessive 
trust in market principles. The less 
advantaged are seldom the winners, 
as New Zealand's bold experiment 
goes to show (pp. 33-34),quality is 
often dangerously compromised 
while national identities run the risk 
of erosion (pp.35-36). Today's 
supreme economic focus needs to 
be urgently balanced by a more 
holistic approach, and in this, the 
state's role is pivotal (pp. 17 and 
37).

### 121203: Guarding the common interest

GUARDING 
THE COMMON INTEREST 
The process of globalization is moving 
ahead so fast that it has reached hereto- 
fore public sector areas, such as education. 
True, the relationship between schools 
and the private sector goes back a long 
way. Learning institutions have adapted 
some of the private sector’s operating 
methods, and the public service has dele- 
gated teaching missions to private com- 
panies, but a further step has been taken. 
The explosion of new technologies, which 
speeds up the production and spread of 
“educational goods” and the globalization 
of markets, spurs on their commerciali- 
zation worldwide and eventually, irresis- 
tibly attracts entrepreneurs, always on 
the lookout for new markets. Today edu- 
cation is a sector weighing two trillion 
dollars and companies are continually 
expanding their choice of “educational 
merchandise.” At the same time, the real 
or supposed shortcomings of public edu- 
cation are turning parents and students 
away from it,and fuelling their growing 
demand for quality services, which they 
are ready to seek elsewhere. 
Everyone who believes that educa- 
tion is a basic right thinks that commer- 
cialization carries acute risks. They argue 
that education must not only train wor- 
kers, but also citizens and responsible

UNESCO ASSISTANT DIRECTOR-GENERAL FOR EDUCATION 
individuals. Therefore they question not 
only the effects liberalization will have, 
which would lead to discrimination against 
the most disadvantaged countries, groups 
and individuals, but also the impact a com- 
mercial approach will have on the spread 
of “common values” or respect for the 
indispensable diversity of learning content 
and methods, which take into account the 
language, culture and teaching traditions 
of the people for whom they are intended. 
Proponents of liberalization criticize 
the public school system’s ability to offer 
equal access to education for all. They 
stress that it’s time to increase and diver- 
sify offer in order to meet demand that the 
traditional systems can no longer meet, all 
the less so because of budget cuts. They 
emphasize the necessity to introduce ideas 
of productivity and responsibility, the lack 
of which, they argue, is the public sector’s 
main shortcoming. 
It is the opinion of UNESCO, and of its 
member states, that neither a wholly 
public nor an entirely commercial edu- 
cation system can overcome the educa- 
tion crisis, which is tangible. The organi- 
zation is convinced that public and private 
education sectors each have something 
valuable to contribute, and that by com- 
bining their efforts and forging partner- 
ships, they can boost the educational sys- 
tem’s overall effectiveness—under one 
condition: primary responsibility for tea- 
ching must remain in the hands of public 
authorities, because they alone are the 
guardians of the common interest. Above 
all, education must be a means to train 
responsible citizens. It goes without saying 
that the deregulation of educational ins- 
titutions cannot be accompanied by the 
decline of the basic rules which underpin 
the educational mission, and by a lack of 
serious monitoring to ensure that those 
rules are observed. 
This is just as valid on a worldwide 
scale. The commercialization of education 
requires regional or international co-ope- 
ration, especially to ensure that the acqui- 
sition of universal values remains the pri- 
mary objective of any educational system. 
The World Trade Organization has started 
taking an interest in this issue. But we 
would be straying from our mission by 
envisaging the impact of globalization only 
from a business perspective, and there- 
fore ignoring its effects on—and potential 
for—human freedom and self-fulfillment 
through education, science and culture. m

s the winds of liberalization blow 
onwards, a new vocabulary is running 
through education plucked straight 
from the corporate universe. Principals 
step into the shoes of managers, parents 
become choosey customers while schools compete 
and innovate, striving to offer an efficient,quality 
service, which at the end of the day yields a profit 
and turns out graduates fit for the job market. 
Tacitly supported by governments, the movement 
is gaining legitimacy worldwide, fuelled by the grass- 
roots and corporate interests, both of which have taken 
aim at public education’s tarnished report card. 
In the mid-1990s, the European Round 
Table of Industrialists, which gathers 
prominent CEOs, pointed its 
finger at “an ever-widening 
gap between the education 
that people need for 
today’s complex world 
and the education 
they receive.” The 
Merrill Lynch bro- 
kerage firm

deemed it “unacceptable that 
more than 113 million children 
have no access to primary education 
... and that the quality of learning and 
the acquisition of human values and skills fall 
far short of the ... needs of societies.” 
As Motoyo Kamiya from the OECD’s Centre 
for Education Research and Innovation notes, edu- 
cation, which typically represents 25 to 30 percent of 
public spending, “is becoming more politicized and 
controversial both at the national level and locally, 
because of decentralization.” Accounting for roughly 
20 percent of total education spending, the private 
sector has always provided services, textbooks or 
  
   
   
  
1. CORPORATE AMBITIONS 
Education Inc.? 
Buoyed by mounting criticism of public education, 
the business world is investing in this new field with 
a managerial mindset and enterprising spirit 
schooling via missions, NGOs or other channels. 
But now, following the dismantling of state mono- 
polies, the whole public sector is deemed ripe for libe- 
ralization. For advocates of this process, healthcare, 
along with education—a market worth two trillion 
dollars—are the last bastions to be overrun. 
Critics attack public education’s inefficiency and 
bureaucratic, often overly-centralized, outmoded 
structures. Pointing to the principles that have made 
many a business prosper, they argue that schools need 
market incentives and competitive pressures to 
improve and innovate, and that these can be created 
through various forms of privatization. As the Euro- 
pean Round Table of Industrialists puts it, “the whole 
situation could be turned around if school education 
underwent the same transformation as the workplace.” 
Struck by funding cuts, higher education is at the 
vanguard of more commercial reforms, from weaving 
closer ties with industry to tapping the online learning 
market. But despite the latter’s bullish forecasts, the 
burgeoning of the private sector cannot be pinned to 
technology alone. As Kamiya notes, a broad public 
sector reform movement is underway, in which 
market-oriented approaches are the backdrop. In 
the U.K. and the US., the publication of league tables, 
test scores and rankings, accompanied by hefty media 
publicity, is “putting schools under pressure to attract 
students and hence funding.” In many countries, 
rules are being loosened up over the right to set up 
schools, while the running of public schools is being 
entrusted to private outfits. 
Answering the pressure from below 
Taking this process one step further, schools are 
becoming business enterprises in their own right. In 
western Africa, retired teachers are opening their 
own, while elsewhere in the developing world full- 
fledged private school chains are attracting growing 
numbers. Under pressure to cut spending, govern- 
ments are loosening regulations and providing incen- 
tives to the private sector. In Cote d'Ivoire, 60 per- 
cent of secondary schools are now in private hands. 
The trend seems set to stay. “What's really pushing 
the for-profit sector is parental demand for better 
and different education,” says the World Bank’s Harry 
Patrinos. “Now, in relatively poor countries, people are 
demanding English, technology. They know it’s out 
there and that some countries are benefiting greatly 
from it. They see that the private sector is able to 
gear its product to those demands.” [|

ooking to business is nothing new in edu- 
cation. A century ago, schools adopted 
reforms based on their reputed economic 
benefits to individuals and the newly 
industrializing urban society. The current 
era has at its core a resurrected and strengthened 
version of this notion. In both eras, reformers have 
agreed that whatever public schools do to improve 
individual students’ job opportunities has direct 
economic consequences for the nation as a whole, 
and for cities in particular. 
The difference today is that corporate refor- 
mers have gained the upper hand, tilting a tension- 
filled compromise that had prevailed over the past 
100 years. Corporate leaders have assumed the 
unrivalled moral authority to define the purposes 
and methods of public schooling in response to the 
new technology-driven global economy. Hailed as 
victorious generals in the battle between capita- 
lism and socialism, many espouse a millennial vision 
that links education to global free markets. Schoo- 
ling, they tell us, hedges our national bets in the 
global competition for market share and predicts 
which students become good employees. But history 
also cautions us that the long-term consequences of 
today’s experiments are probably less well unders- 
tood than their advocates imagine 
The transfer of management methods from busi- 
ness to schools began with a critique of school failure. 
Between 1880 and 1920, different proponents had 
their own economic justifications for reform. Cor- 
porate leaders criticized urban schools for failing to 
respond to a newly industrialized, centralized, and 
increasingly integrated world economy. They sought

1. CORPORATE AMBITIONS 
centralization and efficiency, frequently invoking the 
powerful metaphor of scientific management or 
“Taylorism,” using the stopwatch and management 
to discover the “one best way.” These principles had 
been instrumental, industrialists of the time believed, 
in creating the American industrial revolution and the 
wealth of powerful international companies. The 
quest for efficiency of those decades led to the pro- 
blems we must now repair, notably the rigid and 
bureaucratic structure of our school systems. 
Today, public schools continue to adapt new 
business efficiency techniques in what seems to be 
a constant recycling process. Scientific manage- 
ment,it turns out,was only the precursor to a host 
of ever newer management theories aimed at encou- 
raging greater worker productivity, and hence 
greater national wealth. 
When schools become levers 
to attract business investment 
These trends have echoes in the management 
reforms prescribed for and adopted by schools. Some 
seek increased efficiency through decentralized school 
governance while others imagine that outsourcing 
(or contracting) the management and operation of 
schools will lift educators’ performance because 
incentives are lacking in secure government jobs. 
All this is happening against the backdrop of eco- 
nomic globalization, which inevitably creates poli- 
tical tensions by pitting governments against one 
another in competition for transnational corporate 
jobs and global capital. Our current era mimics the 
turn of the century to the extent that international 
capital flows and transnational production processes 
influence both corporations and governments. Today, 
technologically induced speed, growth among inves- 
tors, concentration of wealth, and interconnected- 
ness have increased the effects of this global specu- 
lation and decreased the capacity of governments to 
regulate business and markets. Not surprisingly, this 
global market ideology has been broadly recognized 
as a force in national education policy. 
Reforming local schools becomes one of the 
ways that cities engage in the global competition to 
provide production resources to corporations. When 
formal schooling is seen as a key element of pro- 
ductive capacity, a view reinforced by the decline of 
manufacturing and the rise of information-based 
technologies in the U.S. the quality of the local 
public school system takes on renewed importance 
for business leaders and local politicians alike. 
Today’s corporate leaders have uncommon access 
to elected political officials and government agency 
heads, the wealth of large corporations to draw 
upon, and the ability to affect local and regional eco- 
nomies simply by making business decisions. 
Schools are treated as engines of economic 
development to lure businesses to a particular city 
or state, so corporate and local political leaders 
cooperate in their governance and redesign. In 
short,school policy becomes labour policy. 
This powerful combination of corporate, national 
and state executives is happening at the expense of 
education professionals. In contrast to the turn of the 
century, when educators played a pivotal role in 
debates by emphasizing the role of schools in deve- 
loping citizenship, today they have been largely dis- 
credited. Selecting school leaders from outside the 
field has become both symptom and spur to this 
decrease in the educator’s status. A small but influen- 
tial group of school districts is choosing leaders from 
among the ranks of businessmen, politicians and 
the military, rather than educators. 
All this is taking place with little evidence that 
recent management solutions will turn around poor 
schools, nor that improvements in school perfor- 
mance protect against declines in productivity or the 
business cycle. Yet there are more troubling pro- 
blems with reform strategies that pit the market 
against government in education.One is that edu- 
cation is reduced to its narrowest economic pur- 
poses. According to a 1992 survey, corporate exe- 
cutives most want schools to emphasize “a basic 
understanding of math and science” and “sound 
work habits such as self-discipline, timeliness and 
dedication to work.” These are laudable goals, but 
reflect a narrow set of traits that employers predict 
their workers will need in an information economy. 
The corporate model of reform pays little heed 
to other expectations of public schools: building 
just and tolerant communities, reducing distrust of 
one another and our shared institutions, safeguar- 
ding democratic ethics and introducing children to 
the cultural wisdom of the world. We are also wit- 
nessing the abandonment of many kinds of equality. 
Neither markets nor business ethics routinely put 
equality or fairness above profits. Whole groups of 
people will not fit the prevailing model of what it 
takes to be competitive in an educational market- 
place in which competition is the guiding principle 
of improvement. Another disturbing trend is the 
anaemic citizenship that economic justifications for 
schooling envision. Increasing the emphasis on indi- 
vidualism is likely to exacerbate a pattern of civic 
disengagement many already find disturbing in its 
scale and scope. 
A balancing act to reach 
a healthy equilibrium 
We need a contemporary counter-movement to 
restore a healthy equilibrium of goals for our public 
schools. This movement would be grounded in a 
very different educational critique that rejects the 
metaphor of market (or management) failure, and 
instead tackles the problems in our schools as symp- 
toms of a widespread civic breakdown. The solutions 
to school failure would then hinge on common 
concerns, rather than rigorous individual competition 
and accountability. In addition to academic criteria, 
parents and reformers would craft student perfor- 
mance measures that reward active citizenship, tole- 
rant and respectful behaviour, and cultural know- 
ledge in the arts, history and languages. This reform 
movement, seeking equity and tolerance, would 
revitalize democratic institutions, and not merely 
aim for more efficient production. n

2. CATERING TO DEMAND 
y : 
Children explore the possibilities of paint in one of Objetivo’s schools. 
LUCIANA ZENTI 
JournALIsT FoR Nova Escola, 
A BRAZILIAN EDUCATION MAGAZINE 
  
hirty-five years after it was founded, Obje- 
tivo has grown into one of the most thri- 
ving educational enterprises in Brazil, with 
over 400 schools located all around the 
country and a university. What's the secret? 
Objetivo’s aim is to see that students get through, 
and in this the company succeeds. Fewer than one 
percent of pupils at the primary and secondary 
level repeat a year, far below the national average, 
which stands at 21.3 percent in primary school and 
40.1 percent at the secondary level, according to 
Education Ministry figures. 
While the share of students in the private sector 
is declining (10.5 percent in 1996 to 8.2 percent in 
2000), Objetivo reaches close to 500,000 pupils from 
kindergarten to university level. Besides its own 
schools (13 in Sao Paulo alone, where its head- 
quarters are located), the company has franchises in 
places as far apart as Brasilia, Goiania, Manaus, 
Campinas and Bauru. 
Objetivo’s pedagogical coordinator, Alfredo Fer- 
nandes, attributes the company’s success to the sound 
reputation it has built over the years.“There’s a posi- 
tive atmosphere in our schools, we’re always open to 
a dialogue with students and society at large,” he says. 
What has become a national network began in 
1965 as a preparatory course for the entrance exam 
required by Brazilian universities. This notched up 
a pass rate of almost 90 percent and its fame quickly 
grew. In 1970, spurred by the good state of its 
finances, Objetivo founded a regular school since 
university entrance coaching was not part of the 
national education system. “We wanted to offer 
quality education so we came up with our own acti- 
vities and methods,” says Fernandes 
Objetivo grew rapidly. In 1972, its first faculties 
were inaugurated, and sixteen years later, it was offi- 
cially recognized as a full-fledged university (UNIP), 
which today counts 53,000 students. In 1975 Objetivo 
set up its first kindergarten and primary schools. 
The schools accept both good pupils and those 
with learning difficulties. “After much discussion, we 
decided to go for an open school with no strea- 
ming, where everyone had a chance to express 
themselves,” says Fernandes “This openness is the 
main difference between us and other private 
schools.” 
Ironically, Objetivo is criticized because it has 
no entrance exam. “Because we made it easy for 
children to get into our schools and stay there, we

were accused of having purely commercial inten- 
tions,” he says. In a country with widespread poverty, 
Objetivo’s fees (between $215 and $355 a month 
depending on the level) are certainly a sizeable 
obstacle for many parents. 
The high cost of tuition and the fact that the 
project was started by people from outside the edu- 
cation world made many experts suspicious of the 
schools. “I'm very much against commercializing 
education,” says Dermeval Saviani, professor of phi- 
losophy and education history at the State Univer- 
sity of Campinas. “Education is a social need that is 
by nature incompatible with the private sector.” 
Objetivo is a good example of this, he argues. 
“With the profits it makes from higher education, it 
has the money to provide low-cost schooling. But this 
is not happening. Because maintaining all its infra- 
structure calls for major investment, Objetivo ignores 
the poorest people.” He says this is a common failing 
of all profit-making private schools, which are only 
accessible to middle and upper-class children. 
With an annual turnover of approximately $400 
million,the company has a long tradition of inves- 
ting in technology. It had the first school in Brazil to 
use interactive video for teaching, and was the first 
to introduce computers in the classroom. Nearly 
all its schools have computer rooms, libraries and 
sports fields, and offer extra-curricular activities 
such as judo, music and visual arts 
“This means we can escape from the routine 
and learn more,” says 14-year-old Bianca Sgai 
Franco. As well as having it own teaching mate- 
rials—textbooks, computer software and CD- 
Roms—some schools are carrying out pioneer pro- 
jects. Two of them are linked to the environment: the 
Sea School at Angra dos Reis, near Rio de Janeiro, 
was founded in 1988 and offers courses in marine life 
to pupils and teachers, while the Nature School, deep 
in the Amazonian jungle, is run on similar lines. 
Another attraction is the Talent Encourage- 
ment Programme for children with exceptional 
skills. A parent or teacher can ask for a gifted child 
to be tested in order to take special classes in both 
the social and natural sciences. “I enrolled my 11- 
year-old daughter in an Objetivo school because of 
this programme,” says Maria Cecilia Novaes 
Augusto. “Now she’s doing robotics, technology 
and art.It’s a very good programme.” 
Tereza Cristina Matteis pays about 1,200 reales 
($650) a month for the schooling of her three sons. “It’s 
a forward-looking educational system that keeps very 
close contact with the children’s families,” she says. Sil- 
vana Da Costa, who attended an Objetivo school and 
now has three of her children there, says “it’s very 
open to the parents.” Given that her husband’s job has 
meant living in eight of Brazil's states, Objetivo’s 
nationwide network has proved an invaluable asset. 
Fernandes, the chain’s pedagogical coordinator, 
says the key difference between the schools and 
the state system is the level of teacher training. “It’s 
a very serious problem in Brazil,” he says. Which is 
why Objetivo offers all its teachers regular refresher 
courses. “Each year we organize at least five regional 
meetings with teachers from other states,” says 
Deborah Cristina Catarinacho, who has taught Por- 
tuguese for the past 12 years. Quality control is also 
strict, with teachers around the country required to 
use the course materials in exactly the same way. 
“Objetivo draws you in,” says Adriana Venturi, 
a preschool teacher. “We're a family where eve- 
ryone encourages each other to go forward.” =m

Private education: 
the poor’s best chance? 
Across the developing world, private schools and education companies 
are not only flourishing, but reaching the poor. India is a case in point 
JAMES TOOLEY 
PROFESSOR OF EDUCATION PoLicy, UNiversITY oF NewcasTLE (UNITED KINGDOM) 
    
common assumption about the private 
sector in education is that it caters only 
to the élite, and that its promotion only 
serves to exacerbate inequality. On the 
contrary, recent research points in the 
opposite direction.If we want to help some of the 
most disadvantaged groups in society, then encou- 
raging deeper private sector involvement is likely to 
be the best way forward. 
Several developments are underway in India, all 
of which involve the private education sector meeting 
the needs of the poor in distinct ways. But India is not 
unique in this respect—similar phenomena are hap- 
pening all over the developing world. 
As a point of departure, how do government 
schools serve the poor? Usefully, the government- 
sponsored Public Report on Basic Education in 
India (PROBE) from 1999 paints a very bleak pic- 
ture of the “malfunctioning” of government schools 
for the poor. When researchers called unannounced 
on their random sample of schools, only 53 percent 
had any “teaching activity” going on. In 33 percent, 
the headteacher was absent. Alarmingly, the team 
noted that the deterioration of teaching standards 
was not to do with disempowered teachers, but ins- 
tead could be ascribed to “plain negligence.” They

noted “several cases of irrespon- 
sible teachers keeping a school 
closed ... for months at a time,” 
many cases of drunk teachers, and 
headteachers who asked children 
to do domestic chores. Signifi- 
cantly, the low level of teaching 
activity occurred even in those 
schools with relatively good infra- 
structure, teaching aids and pupil- 
teacher ratios. 
But is there any alternative to 
these schools? Surely no-one else 
can do better than government 
given the resources available? As 
it happens, the PROBE report 
pointed to private schools that 
were serving the poor and 
conceded—rather reluctantly— 
that such problems were not found 
in these schools. In the great majo- 
rity of private schools—again

random—there “was feverish 
classroom activity.”Most parents 
would prefer to send their chil- 
dren to private schools if they could afford them. Pri- 
vate schools, they said, were successful because they 
were more accountable: “the teachers are accoun- 
table to the manager (who can fire them), and, 
through him or her, to the parents (who can with- 
draw their children).” Such accountability was not 
present in the government schools, and “this contrast 
is perceived with crystal clarity by the vast majority 
of parents.” 
The way forward: loosen regulations 
and set up voucher schemes 
To many readers, the existence of these private 
schools for the poor will come as a surprise. It was 
to me too, until I had the privilege of conducting 
fieldwork for the International Finance Corporation 
(the private finance arm of the World Bank) on a 
group of such schools operating under the banner 
of the Federation of Private Schools’ Management 
based in Hyderabad. The federation has 500 private 
schools (from kindergarten to grade ten) serving 
poor communities in slums and villages. I was 
impressed by both the entrepreneurial spirit within 
these schools —they were run on commercial prin- 
ciples, not dependent on hand-outs from state or phi- 
lanthropy— but also by the spirit of dedication 
within the schools for the poor communities served: 
not for nothing were the leaders of the schools 
known as “social workers.” But these schools suffer 
under restrictive and inappropriate regulations. 
One example will suffice: to be recognized, a school 
must deposit up to 50,000 rupees(about $1,200) in 
a stipulated bank account, of which neither the 
capital nor the interest can be touched.Given that 
the fees charged in these schools ranged from 25 (60 
cents) to Rs 150 per month (about $3.50), with 
most of the schools grouped near the lower end of 
the range, such sums are completely prohibitive. 
Fees of around $10 per year are not affordable 
by everyone, but they are to a large number of poor 
families. Furthermore, the great majority of the 
schools offer a significant number of free places — 
up to 20 percent— for the poorest students, allocated 
on the basis of claims of need checked informally in 
the community. 
All of this suggests that if one is interested in 
serving the needs of the poor in India, then trying to 
reform the totally inadequate, cumbersome and 
unaccountable government system is unlikely to be 
the best way. Instead, reform the regulatory envi- 
ronment to make it suitable for the flourishing of pri- 
vate schools for the poor, help build private financing 
schemes using overseas and indigenous philanthropy, 
and encourage public voucher schemes, so that 
parents can use their allowance of funding where they 
see the schools are performing well, rather than was- 
ting them in unresponsive state schools. 
Private education in developing countries isn’t 
just about the poor, of course, and there are many 
exciting examples of big education businesses. But 
these too have implications for the ways in which the 
private sector can reach the least advantaged. One 
Indian company which embodies much of the exci- 
tement and innovation in the education industry is the 
National Institute for Information Technology 
(NIIT). With its competitor, Aptech, it shares just 
over 70 percent of the information technology edu- 
cation and training market in India, estimated at 
roughly Rs. 1.1 billion ($24 million). NIIT has 40 
wholly owned centres in the metropolitan areas, and 
about 1,000 franchised centres across India. It also 
has a global reach, with centres in the U.S.,Asia- 
Pacific, Europe, Japan, Central Asia and Africa. A key 
aspect of NII'T’s educational philosophy is that there 
is a need to harness research to improve the effi- 
ciency of learning and to raise educational standards. 
Because of its success in developing innovative 
and cost-effective IT education and training, NIIT has

attracted the attention of several state governments. 
First off the mark was Tamil Nadu, which wanted to 
bring a computer curriculum to all of its high schools. 
Significantly, although allocating about $22 million 
over five years to this endeavour, it didn’t hand the 
funds over to government schools, perhaps in light of 
the PROBE report’s lessons. Instead, it developed a 
model to contract out the service to private compa- 
nies, which provide the software and hardware, while 
the government supplies electricity and the class- 
room. For the first round of the Tamil Nadu process, 
43 contracts were awarded for 666 schools, with NII'T 
allotted 371 schools. Many of the classrooms have 
become NIIT centres, open to school children and 
teachers in daytime, then used by the franchise holder 
in the evenings. The contracting out of curriculum 
areas such as this represents an important step for- 
ward in relationships between the public and pri- 
vate sectors, and provides an interesting model worth 
watching and emulating. 
Most recently, NIIT has focused on reaching 
largely illiterate and unschooled children through the 
Internet. Within weeks of having set up an “Internet 
kiosk” in a slum area, the institute’s researchers 
found that without any instruction, children could 
achieve a remarkable level of computer literacy. 
NIIT is exploring ways to roll out the idea com- 
mercially, harnessing the power of the private sector 
to reach the poorest through modern technology. 
These initiatives all find echoes in other deve- 
loping countries. In each case, the private, not the 
public sector, is most responsive to the needs of 
the poor, and is bringing innovation, efficiency and 
educational quality to the lives of the most disad- 
vantaged. The private sector has the potential to pro- 
mote greater equity and to influence education 
policy, provided it is encouraged and viewed as a 
partner, not a threat to governments, whether in the 
developing or the developed world. n

South Africa: t 
for portable quali 
The government is trying to put some order into the burgeoning private higher education 
sector and clamp down on dodgy foreign outfits 
  
ebo Sekoto is an upwardly mobile young 
woman, a 28-year-old senior human 
resources consultant at a large mining 
corporation in Pretoria. She is now inter- 
nationally mobile too, she says, thanks 
to the arrival of Britain’s De Montfort University. 
It is one of hundreds of further and higher educa- 
tion institutions—local and foreign—that have set 
up shop in South Africa. 
Now nearing the end of a part-time MBA,Lebo 
offers good reasons for choosing De Montfort.“I 
want to expand my horizons and work for a multi- 
national corporation and gain experience in the 
United Kingdom.So I thought it fitting to obtain a 
globally portable U.K.qualification.” In fact Lebo, 
born in the sprawling black township of Soweto, has 
been studying most of her life. 
After leaving school she obtained a business 
diploma at a polytechnic. Then came a part-time 
degree in industrial psychology and business mana- 
gement through the distance University of South 
Africa, and now the MBA, which combines part-time 
and on-line study. “Companies see you as a young 
black female first,” she says, “irrespective of your qua- 
lifications. If I want to move up the ladder to become 
a chief executive, I have to be three times more qua- 
lified and experienced than male colleagues.” 
De Montfort (450 students in South Africa of 
whom 65 percent are black) is one of several foreign 
institutions now operating in South Africa’s private 
sector. It is unusual in being non-profit and aiming to 
Ne race 
cations 
build management skills in this developing country: 
most others, local and foreign, are straight businesses. 
It was also the first private institution to be registered 
in South Africa under new laws aimed at regulating 
the growth and quality of private higher education, 
which is burgeoning here as it is in many other coun- 
tries—to the point of threatening the viability of 
many public institutions. 
“Our public sector is immature, so we are imple- 
menting new policies to develop it,” says Professor 
Nasima Badsha, the government’s deputy director- 
general in charge of higher education. “Much of the 
private sector is for-profit and market-driven, and 
does not share our commitment to access, equity, 
quality and human resource development. Such 
concerns are shared by a number of countries in the 
south.” Fees for private institutions tend to be 30 to 
50 percent higher than those for state institutions. 
After the dismantling of apartheid, 
the foreign influx begins 
It is not known exactly how many private tertiary 
institutions are currently operating. In higher edu- 
cation, 100 of more than 200 institutions that applied 
for accreditation have been or are well on the way to 
being registered. The private higher education insti- 
tutions have more than 20,000 full-time students in 
South Africa, which last year had 564,000 students in 
the public sector. Hundreds of thousands are enrolled 
in private part-time higher education courses and a 
vast number of further education courses ranging

EDUCATION: THE LAST FRONTIER FOR PROFIT 
 
from literacy to art, computing and business. 
The influx of foreign institutions began after the 
nation’s first democratic elections in 1994. With the dis- 
mantling of apartheid, black students shifted away 
from poorly resourced “black” institutions to well- 
endowed formerly “white” ones, while many mostly 
middle-class white students moved to private institu- 
tions, due to perceptions—hotly denied—of decli- 
     LAN = 
A computer course for adults at t 
ning quality, disruption and lack of safety in the state 
sector. 
With an unemployment rate near 30 percent 
and the formal economy absorbing only 56 percent 
of students from top universities—and 25 percent 
from less respected ones—students seek “marke- 
table” qualifications that vocationally oriented poly- 
technics and private institutions are seen to offer. 
Many people see foreign degrees as more prestigious 
and portable than local ones, while others view them 
as an emigration ticket to a richer country. 
Most of the private institutions are genuine, but 
fly-by-night operators are a problem. The 1997 
Higher Education Act is supposed to weed them out 
by requiring that all private institutions seek course 
accreditation from the South African Qualifica- 
tions Authority. They must also register with the 
education department, which has two criteria for 
acceptance: financial viability and quality. 
“Foreign institutions posed a particular threat 
to public universities,” says Professor Badsha. “They 
mostly operate in a narrow range of areas, especially 
IT, business and commerce, ‘cherry picking’ finan- 
he Lawaaicamp settlement in the Western Cape, 
cially lucrative courses without the obligation of offering the 
full range of disciplines. Public universities found themselves 
losing income-earning courses they use to cross-subsidize 
expensive disciplines such as music and art, medicine and 
engineering, which are critical to South Africa’s cultural, social 
and economic development.” 
Foreign institutions also attract good staff from public uni- 
versities by paying higher salaries, and charge fees that only the 
LER SA 
wealthy can afford, resulting in a new form of apar- 
theid, says Badsha.“We are trying to move away 
from race and class to create truly South African ins- 
titutions.” 
As a result, the government is amending the 
act to make it more difficult for foreign institutions 
to set up in South Africa. For example, before gran- 
ting permits, the registrar will judge whether the 
applicant is useful to the public system and broadens 
the scope of courses offered. Even though South 
Africa’s constitution prohibits discrimination against 
foreign institutions, some of them have threatened 
to take the issue to the World Trade Organization. 
Indeed many foreign institutions have already left. 
Education Minister Kader Asmel strongly 
rejects claims that the clampdown is motivated by 
“narrow protectionist agendas or national chauvi- 
nism.” The goal, he says, is simply to assure the 
accountable and efficient use of public resources. 
“We do not wish to turn a blind eye to supra- 
national developments, or build new walls around 
ourselves. But we cannot stand by and watch the 
erosion of our system.” [|

### 121210: When parents want out

2. CATERING TO DEMAND 
When parents want out 
In the U.S., parents are claiming the right to spend their tax money as 
they see fit and are rallying in growing numbers behind voucher plans. A 
critical look at the school choice controversy 
PEDRO A. NOGUERA   
  
    
URBAN SOCIOLOGIST, PROFESSOR AT HARVARD UNIVERSITY'S GRADUATE SCHOOL 
OF EbucaTioN 
he industrialized world’s first public edu- 
cation system is under siege, with fierce 
attacks pitched from all sides in the U.S. 
political arena. First the administrative 
leadership of large urban school districts 
is reeling from accusations of being inefficient, 
overly bureaucratic and more preoccupied with 
rules and regulations than with providing quality 
education to students. Meanwhile, teachers, stu- 
dents and parents, especially those from low-income 
areas, are the targets of blame for what has been 
characterized as the “rising tide of mediocrity that 
threatens our very future as a nation and a people.” 
Never before has education received such atten- 
tion in a presidential campaign. The nation tuned 
into televised debate where Al Gore and George 
Bush clearly marked out the battle lines. The Demo- 
crat pledged to pump $115 billion more into a school 
system in need of greater accountability and inno- 
vation, while the Republican vowed to dismantle the 
system and replace it by privately managed schools 
that operate on marketplace principles 
At the centre of the debate lies the highly 
controversial voucher plan: instead of paying taxes 
to support their local public school, parents can 
opt to use that money to send their child to a private 
school.In 1998 Florida became the first to adopt a 
statewide plan,while California and Michigan will 
vote on similar initiatives in November 2000.Cali- 
fornia’s is notably supported by Tim Draper, a 
Silicon Valley venture capitalist. The proposed 
policy: to provide state-funded scholarships of $4,000 
(compared to the $5,627 per student the state now 
spends) to any parents who want to send their chil- 
dren to private or parochial schools. 
Despite their power, teacher unions have been 
left to the margins of the debate. Often castigated 
as stubborn defenders of the status quo, unions 
have been forced into a defensive posture, attemp- 
ting to fight off the most radical reform measures 
while working to raise the salaries and benefits of 
their members, which are widely recognized as 
inadequate. Although the American Federation of 
Teachers and the National Education Association 
continue to play a major role in statewide elec- 
tions, their influence in the debate over educational 
reform has been minimal. 
Support for the privatization camp is drawn lar- 
gely from certain corporations which perceive public 
education as hopelessly unfixable, religious conser- 
vatives who want to exercise greater control over 
what their children are taught, and a growing 
number of middle-class parents whose children 
already attend private schools and who resent being 
taxed to support a system they do not patronize. In 
most states, this coalition has been unable to muster 
the support needed to implement privatization pro- 
posals beyond a small number of isolated cases. 
But this appears to be changing. 
Other constituencies who once were viewed as 
reliable supporters of public education now appear 
willing to back efforts to radically transform the 
system and replace it with new models, many of 
which remain undefined and untested. A recent 
study conducted by the Joint Center for Political 
and Economic Studies found that 88 percent of 
African Americans were in favour of education 
choice plans, with the highest support (95 percent) 
coming from families earning less than $15,000 a 
year. For parents whose children have long consti- 
tuted a“‘captured market” and been forced to attend 
the most inferior schools, the various privatization 
proposals hold out the promise of providing access 
to quality education. 
The white middle class takes flight 
How do we explain this groundswell of interest? 
The answer is far from straightforward. Though the 
right to education is not guaranteed by the U.S. 
constitution, access to education has effectively 
become a universal entitlement. Moreover, many 
significant advancements in civil rights for racial 
minorities, the disabled, language minorities, and 
more recently gays and lesbians, have first been 
achieved in public education before spreading to 
other sectors of society. Schools in the U.S. are 
governed locally, and throughout the country com- 
munities increasingly look to their public schools for 
solutions to a growing list of social problems. 
Yet so many schools are in such a lamentable 
state that the entire system is now under attack. 
Severe funding cuts in the 1980s forced many school 
districts to eliminate academic programmes (such as 
art, music and athletics), increase the number of stu- 
dents per classroom, and reduce access to services such 
as counselling. Fractious labour relations, decaying 
buildings and an array of social problems, many of 
which are related to impoverishment of the children 
they serve, have overwhelmed school personnel. 
Such conditions have compelled many middle- 
class families to flee urban school districts and trans- 
formed many schools into institutions of last resort. 
African American and Latino students are grossly 
over-represented in these failing schools. So it may 
be only natural to find their parents increasingly 
open to voucher proposals

### 121210: When parents want out

    
EDUCATION: THE LAST FRONTIER FOR PROFIT 
      
    
Fear, racial prejudice toward mino- 
rities, and the arrival of new immigrants 
have also contributed to the flight of the 
white middle class. States such as Cali- 
fornia, Florida and New York have 
experienced substantial increases in 
public school enrolment due to the 
immigration of large numbers of Asians 
and Latin Americans. As the demogra- 
phics of the student population has 
changed, registered voters, typically 
older and disproportionately white, have 
been less willing to cover the costs of 
public education through tax increases. 
The airline model and the 
future of schools left behind 
Despite their many weaknesses, 
public schools continue to offer one 
of the only sources of mobility and 
social support to poor and working- 
class families. Under voucher schemes, 
elite schools may become even more 
selective as an increase in the demand 
for admission allows them to raise the 
cost of tuition and moves them even 
further beyond the reach of low- 
income families. And what will happen 
to those schools and students left 
behind? Funding is based largely on 
enrolment, so it seems unlikely that 
the undesirable schools will receive 
the resources needed to improve. The 
State of California’s legislative analyst 
projects a major cut in public school 
funding if the children already in pri- 
vate schools receive vouchers and if 
five percent of those in the public 
system use vouchers to leave. 
Shifting the burden 
of responsibility 
The essential difference between 
the present situation and what is likely 
to occur after privatization is that indi- 
viduals rather than government will 
bear responsibility for ensuring access to 
quality education. Advocates point to 
the example of the new airlines that 
were established shortly after the indus- 
try’s deregulation in the 1980s. Most 
of the new airlines no longer exist, 
however, and those that do are widely 
seen as offering inferior quality albeit at a lower 
price. But the advocates still argue that new schools 
couldn’t possibly be worse than the public ones now 
operating in certain districts. But unlike public 
schools, which are required to meet legally establi- 
shed educational standards (mainly teaching cre- 
dentials and accessibility for students), there is no 
guarantee that private schools will be held to similar 
requirements.

Children and parents rally in Dayton,Ohio, for the freedom to pick their schools. 
The advocates seem to be gaining the political 
advantage. In such a climate, defence of public edu- 
cation must be based upon more than its potential to 
improve, but on evidence that this can in fact be 
done. Public education is in desperate need of reform, 
and those who value and appreciate its role in society 
must be at the forefront of efforts to hasten the pace

2. CATERING TO DEMAND 
struggling to make a profit 
MARK WALSH 
ASSOCIATE EDITOR OF EpucaTioN WEEK (U.S.) 
  
enno C. Schmidt Jr. stunned many when 
he quit one of the most prestigious posi- 
tions in academia in 1992 to help lead a 
controversial educational venture that 
had no guarantee it would ever open its 
first school. 
Schmidt was lured from the presidency of Yale 
University by media entrepreneur Christopher 
Whittle to bring some educational prestige to what was 
then known as the Edison Project, a venture launched 
in 1991. The goal: to try new approaches in elementary 
and secondary education that Whittle believed would 
be as revolutionary as Thomas Edison’s replacement 
of the candle with the electric light bulb. 
Nine years later, Edison Schools Inc. is viewed 
as the leading company in the movement towards 
private management of public education in the U.S. 
It now manages 108 public schools serving some 
57,000 students, up from 25 schools in 1997-98. 
Many are so-called charter schools, namely public 
schools that are largely independent of the tradi- 
tional school districts and operate free of many 
state bureaucratic rules. They receive funding from 
the state government on a per-pupil basis and 
parents pay no tuition. But Edison also contracts 
with school authorities to manage traditional public 
schools using its educational model. 
“Most people thought of this as a kind of expe- 
riment on the edge of the possible,” says Schmidt, 
“and a lot of people are distrustful of how a private 
firm would operate public schools But we’ve seen 
a broader and broader acceptance by public edu- 
cational institutions that good, high-quality private 
firms have a lot to offer.” 
In many districts, authorities have turned over 
some of the worst performing schools to Edison. 
While the company has a well-oiled marketing 
machine, a number of school administrators have 
been attracted by Edison’s all-encompassing exper- 


### 121211: Edison's third way

  
Edison's third way 
In a less than a decade, a New York-based company has established a 
reputation for managing troubled public schools, but the venture is still 
tise and bold approach. The company offers a com- 
plete package, which cost $40 million to develop. Its 
curriculum is regarded as rigorous, exceeding requi- 
rements of most states. School days are longer than 
normal, students take Spanish in kindergarten and 
can study for the International Baccalaureate. The 
schools have at least three computers per class- 
room, and students can take home a personal com- 
puter to work on projects and surf the Internet as 
well as to link parents and teachers. 
The company has a touchy relationship with 
the country’s two teachers’ unions, which have been 
generally critical of private management. The 
unions’ chief concerns are that the company uses 
relatively inexperienced teachers, and that the tea- 
cher turnover rate is high. The American Federation 
of Teachers (AFT) has paid particularly close atten- 
tion to test scores and argues that the achievement 
record is not as rosy as the company paints it. “Some 
of their schools have improved and some have 
really struggled. There’s no magic in being private,” 
says Celia Lose, an AFT spokeswoman. 
Despite criticism, Edison Inc. is confident.Enrol- 
ment has increased eightfold since 1996, revenue 
stands at $225 million, financial losses are shrin- 
king ($37 million) and its stock has inched upward 
since the company went public in November 1999. 
While the company’s priority is to get a firmer foo- 
ting in the U.S. —it has to manage several hundred 
schools before realizing economies of scale— it will 
seek to expand internationally. “Edison genuinely 
represents what people in the U.K., especially Tony 
Blair, call a third way,” says Schmidt. “It’s not fully 
private, and not fully public.” He notes that to many 
in Europe, privatization of public services has been 
an “all or nothing” proposition. It has meant taking 
a state enterprise “and converting it completely to 
private management,” he says. “Edison offers more 
of a partnership with government.” n

Prestigious universities are forging alliances to conquer a share of the 
e-learning market and stand up to virtual competitors

cational qualification. Technological developments, 
increasingly necessary for learners in all fields to 
master, offer ever more innovative tools for sup-

For business, online learning is “the” new market 
opportunity, with the need for re-training and pro-

industry by 2003. Business is better able to develop 
and maintain the technological infrastructure neces-

A host of companies has sprung up to help uni-

in the early stages of setting up their own virtual uni- 
versities. But what has become clear is that the conser- 
vative and labyrinthine decision-making processes 
which characterize most university procedures are 
being jolted by a race to get a share of the lifelong 
learning market. 
So far, the most common approach for universities 
to break into the e-learning universe has been to develop 
courses specifically for a corporate partner or to form 
alliances among themselves. Universitas 21, a company 
incorporated in the UK. is a network of 18 leading 
universities in ten countries. Earlier this year, it formed 
ajoint venture with Rupert Murdoch’s News Corpora- 
tion to provide premium higher education programmes 
using new information technologies and learning 
methods. In October 2000, Stanford, Princeton, Yale and 
Oxford formed “The Big Four Alliance,” aimed at offe- 
ring courses in the arts and sciences 
to 500,000 alumni. The most common 
undoubtedly become more valuable than a Bachelor 
of Science from a renowned university. 
The more consumerist the approach of the edu- 
cation provider, the more what is taught is influenced 
by demand. MBAs dominate e-learning provision 
and IT courses are a close second. While the new 
consumet/learner demands flexibility, choice and just- 
in-time learning opportunities, suppliers will inevitably 
arise who are focused on meeting the demand at the 
expense of quality and value. And is the consumer 
really the best judge of what course material to 
choose? Education is a more complex “product”than 
toothpaste or washing powder. A totally consumer- 
driven education market is unlikely to be in society’s 
best interests in the long term. 
The commercialization of education usually 
goes hand-in-hand with desegregation: course 
design,delivery, tutoring, assess- 
ment and accreditation may be 
Very often, prestigious universi- 
ties have stayed clear of going fully approach for 
carried out by different organi- 
zations. Students might study 
online, seeing a danger to their 
brand name. Many are limiting their universities to break 
courses or modules from diffe- 
rent universities or providers 
offerings to continuing education 
programmes and/or non-degree into the e-learning 
and then put themselves for- 
ward for examination and 
courses, and more often than not, 
universe has 
accreditation by yet another ins- 
titution. While most academics they are aiming at the corporate 
market. One company, UNext.com, 
has partnered with first-class insti- been to develop loathe marking assignments, 
they regard this scenario with 
tutions such as the University of courses specifically horror, and blame commercia- 
lization for the demise of the Columbia (U.S.) and the London 
School of Economics to create for a “community of scholars” 
online courses marketed under the 
name Cardean University. Their corporate partner 
concept of a university. The 
death of the “course” has also 
target: the Fortune 500 companies as 
well as individual adults. They've 
managed to attract Nobel laureates to design courses and 
the universities receive royalties for their content. Other 
universities have formed spin-off for-profit companies 
specifically to develop online programmes. This facilitates 
the commercialization of software and other products, 
and is a way to take a commercial approach to conti- 
nuing and professional studies without compromising 
the University’s academic standing. 
Then there are the freestanding for-profit virtual uni- 
versities, which are arousing the ire of institutions that 
have prided themselves on a long history of public 
service. The most quoted examplar is Phoenix Univer- 
sity, the largest private outfit in the U.S. Now owned by 
the Apollo Group, it operates the country’s largest 
online programme with 12,200 students. The university 
tracks students’ progress and contacts those who don’t 
submit assignments on time or fail to enrol in subse- 
quent courses. Many critics question Phoenix’s blatant 
commercialization, but few doubt the university’s 
impact on continuing professional development pro- 
vision. 
Although e-learning is in its infancy, its impact can 
already by gauged.New providers are coming on the 
market all the time and the trend is accelerating to the 
point of upsetting universities’ virtual monopoly in 
educational accreditation. An Information Technology 
training course offered or accredited by Microsoft has 
  
been predicted, with learners— 
especially corporate and on-the- 
job learners—demanding short study modules. 
What then happens to the ability to get an overview 
of a field when learning consists of the student 
selecting a whole series of unconnected learning 
“bites”? Learners will be “zapping” between short 
sequences or presentations much as they do bet- 
ween television channels. 
But while some faculty view e-learning with 
alarm, technology-based learning is where most of the 
pedagogical innovation is taking place in universities. 
Multimedia learning resources and interactive simu- 
lations are being developed for the web. Collabora- 
tive learning activities, new forms of online assess- 
ment and small group teaching technologies are 
making online courses more stimulating, interactive 
and attractive than many face-to-face taught courses. 
Despite “doom and gloom scenarios,” most mode- 
rate observers of the scene see a continued future for 
the campus university, especially at the undergra- 
duate level, while e-learning will above all cater to 
adult, professional and independent learners. Some 
commercialization of education is good if it fosters 
innovation, concern for quality and responsiveness to 
consumer demands. But if some is good, more is not 
necessarily better! Not in education at least. [|

New Zealand: the price of 
the market model 
The country with the most 
free-market public education 
system in the West is now 
trying to rescue schools 
caught in a downward spiral

he case for bringing the ideas and values of 
the private sector to primary and secon- 
dary education sounds fine on paper. Give 
local schools operational autonomy. Then 
abolish geographical enrolment zones and 
allow parents to choose which school their child 
will attend so that schools have to compete to attract 
students. In the resulting educational “marketplace,” 
schools will improve their teaching and student 
achievement records. 
Such was the thinking that New Zealand applied 
to the running of its state education system in the 
1990s under a series of legislative changes known as 
Tomorrow’s Schools reforms. The reform plan was 
the boldest experiment with market-based educa- 
tion ever carried out by a developed country. 
Overnight, the system goes local 
and parents take charge 
What were the results? The answer is at best 
mixed. It was good for some schools and some stu- 
dents, but disastrous for other schools, many of 
which served disproportionate shares of disadvan- 
taged students. As New Zealand policymakers now 
busily retreat from the reforms, their experience 
offers some warnings for other countries thinking 
about moving down the same road. 
The application of market principles to the deli- 
very of public education was a natural step for New 
Zealand. This island nation of 3.8 million people had 
gone through a serious economic crisis in the early 
1980s that had left the country close to bankruptcy. 
In 1984 a new Labour government was elected that 
decided to break with tradition and restructure the 
country’s economy around neo-liberal themes. By the 
end of the decade, the government extended the 
restructuring effort to the social sectors of the eco- 
nomy. First came the national health system, then 
housing and welfare. Education was next.

3. NOTES OF CAUTION 
In 1989, Parliament abolished the national 
Department of Education and turned control of 
primary and secondary schools over to locally 
elected boards of trustees, dominated by parents. 
Virtually overnight, one of the world’s most tightly 
controlled public education systems became one 
of the most decentralized. The central government 
continued to fund the education system,negotiate 
teacher contracts and enforce accountability 
through an inspectorate system. 
Innovation versus the downward 
spiral of low-performing schools 
Two years later anew government controlled by 
the conservative National Party ratcheted the stakes 
up another notch. Parliament abolished neighbou- 
rhood enrolment zones and gave parents the right to 
choose which school their child would attend. Pri- 
mary and secondary schools found themselves com- 
peting for students in an educational agora. Public 
relations and marketing skills became as integral 
to the job description of principals as knowledge of 
curriculum and the ability to manage a faculty. 
Many schools prospered under the new arran- 
gements, especially those serving middle and upper- 
middle class students. Such schools had the social 
capital among their parent bodies to elect boards of 
trustees with the governance, financial, legal and 
other skills needed to run an educational institution, 
and some principals with entrepreneurial instincts 
took full advantage of their new-found autonomy to 
offer innovative educational programmes. 
The Gladstone Primary School in Auckland, for 
example, began offering a programme organized 
around the theory of “multiple intelligences” arti- 
culated by Harvard University psychologist Howard 
Gardner. “No one is restricting us,” said Colin Dale, 
the principal. “The potential is now there to do wha- 
tever you want. It’s all about meeting needs and per- 
forming. If you get it right, people will flock to you.” 
Self-governance did have its price. The workload 
of principals and teachers increased substantially and 
many schools serving large numbers of disadvan- 
taged students found it difficult to muster boards of 
trustees with the requisite governance skills. 
For their part, New Zealand parents enthusias- 
tically embraced their new right to choose where 
their child would go to school. Substantial num- 
bers of students began venturing outside their local 
neighbourhoods to attend classes. Their numbers 
included many Maori and Pacific Island students 
from low-income families who saw an opportunity 
to flee low-performing urban schools. 
From the point of view of parents, moving up the 
scale in choice of school is understandable and even 
rational. But in New Zealand, parents judge the qua- 
lity of schools by the ethnic and socioeconomic mix of 
their students. Schools with a preponderance of Euro- 
pean students are seen as superior to those with large 
numbers of Maori and Pacific Islanders. In the new 
educational marketplace, schools serving predomi- 
nantly white students have grown in size during the 
1990s, while those serving large numbers of minority 
students saw their rolls decrease. They could not com- 
pete for either high quality teachers or motivated stu- 
dents. The cost of transportation and optional school 
fees have also limited minority access to the most 
desirable schools. 
Although other countries might design a compe- 
titive system somewhat differently from New Zealand, 
the forces unleashed by parental choice are under 
any circumstances likely to push systems towards 
greater polarization. By definition, in any competitive 
environment some participants will be successful and 
others will fail. That’s the way markets work. We 
observed situations in New Zealand where schools 
operating on a level playing field were engaged in 
vigorous competition for students that probably 
redounded to the benefit of both. The problem is that 
the playing field is not always level. Enrolment data 
show lower income and minority students are dis- 
proportionately represented among schools that are 
unable to compete. There has been an enhanced 
concentration in schools at the bottom of difficult- 
to-teach students—those from poverty-stricken homes, 
those whose English is weak, those with learning dif- 
ficulties and those who are suspended from other 
schools for disciplinary reasons. 
New Zealanders describe the loser schools as “spi- 
ralling” downward. Once they begin to fall behind in the 
educational marketplace, downward spiralling schools 
find their problems compounding and feeding on each 
other. Lower student rolls means fewer teachers, which 
means a less attractive academic programme, which 
means even fewer students. Schools become losers; so 
do the students and families served by them. 
The return of the state and the 
need for policy safeguards 
By the mid-1990s public pressure began buil- 
ding on the Ministry of Education, a policy-oriented 
successor to the abolished department, to assist 
these spiralling schools. The ministry began offe- 
ring managerial assistance, then moved toward more 
direct intervention. By 1998 top ministry officials 
were conceding that the educational marketplace 
would never work for as many as a quarter of 
schools. 
One may ask whether it is defensible, on moral, 
practical or other grounds, to organize the delivery of 
public education so that you know from the outset 
that a properly working system will seriously exa- 
cerbate the problems of some schools. The creation 
of losers might be justified if competition led to an 
overall improvement of the system as a whole and the 
losers would still be winners in absolute terms. Or it 
might be justified if the Ministry of Education, aware 
that competition leads inevitably to unsuccessful 
schools, stood ready with a safety net. Neither condi- 
tion,however, was present in New Zealand. 
The country’s decade-long experience with 
market-based reform demonstrates there are no 
panaceas in school reform. The trick is to adopt 
reform strategies that will protect the positive values 
of self-governance and competition while minimi- 
zing their negative consequences through appro- 
priate policy safeguards. [|

### 121214: Offshore threats

Offshore 
threats 
The impending flood of offshore 
courses may do more than lure 
students away from the public 
system. It may shake a pillar of 
national cohesion, says Gajaraj 
Dhanarajan, head of the 
Commonwealth of Learning* 
INTERVIEW BY CYNTHIA GUTTMAN 
UNESCO COURIER JOURNALIST 
  
re online degrees offered by foreign 
universities eroding the position of 
national institutions? 
The impact has not been significantly felt yet, 
because a large part of the population in developing 
countries cannot afford to pay for courses travelling 
via the Internet from offshore sources. Even when 
such courses are heavily subsidized, as is the case 
with the African Virtual University, the cost is pro- 
hibitive. An AVU course from Canada,the U.K.or 
the U.S. is said to be around $200-300 per credit. 
That’s probably the monthly salary of an academic 
in one of the countries with an AVU site. 
  
What about in the longer term? 
Academic environments run the risk of being des- 
tabilized in countries where offshore courses are 
downloaded. Students who can afford these courses 
are the ones who have already enjoyed previous pri- 
vileges, notably a much better secondary educa- 
tion. Offshore degrees provide yet another privilege: 
they're an attractive proposition for those wishing 
to get jobs abroad besides being prized by local 
employers. So two types of student communities 
might evolve: an underprivileged class that attends 
a local university and a privileged class that can 
use a brand-name “foreign”education. This is likely 
to create resentment. The local academic commu- 
nity could also become demoralized if it sees itself 
serving only the second best. 
So there is a threat to national cohesion? 
Yes. In many developing countries, higher education 
is seen as a key component of nation-building. I 
fear this is in danger of being damaged for a number 
of reasons including a mismatch between offshore 
curricula and local hopes of building national cohe- 
sion,maintaining cultural integrity and addressing 
local resource needs. What we are seeing with off- 
shore courses is the dumping, at an international 
level, of products created for domestic consumption. 
How much leverage do governments have in 
this context? 
There is very little they can do without running into 
a string of criticism including accusations of erecting 
barriers to the free flow of information. Local legis- 
lation concerning quality and curriculum can be 
applied to foreign institutions in real space, but is 
much more difficult to do in cyberspace. Govern- 
ments could tax those delivering the product, but 
ultimately the customer pays. Taxing the user is also 
difficult to justify because students could argue that 
they’re already paying for a quality they can’t get 
locally. Governments could take a stronger moral 
line, saying yes to a free market but stipulating that 
a significant part of the curriculum must address 
local human capital development needs. They have 
to be persuasive in presenting those arguments in 
global fora like the World Trade Organization. 
Education is 
the art of making 
man ethical. 
Georg Friedrich Hegel, German 
philosopher, (1770-1831) 
How can local institutions improve their stan- 
ding? 
Local capacities have to be developed, and these 
include making education accessible to those who 
cannot study within campus walls. Online education 
is not the only solution. There are open universities 
in the developing world that do a very good job of 
taking knowledge to learners through a variety of 
methods but which are supported at the village level 
by mentors who can help students. These capaci- 
ties ought to be developed. Universities in develo- 
ping countries should become dual-mode institu- 
tions to cater to the off-campus population. If those 
capacities include e-learning, wonderful. But our 
aim should be to improve access to learning and to 
internationalize education. This does not mean 
making education a trade. The issue is too important. 
Commodifying education does not augur well for the 
cause of internationalizing edu- 
cation.

### 121215: Money over merit?

3. NOTES OF CAUTION 
Money 
over merit? 
Samik Lahiri, general secretary of the 
Students’ Federation of India (SFI), 
one of the world’s largest such 
organizations, raises the alarm 
over advancing commercialization 
INTERVIEW BY UTPAL BORPUJAR 
JOURNALIST BASED IN NEW DELHI 
  
hen did the commercialization of edu- 
cation became a concern for the SFI? 
SFT has been strongly protesting moves 
to privatize education since the early 
1990s when the process of economic 
liberalization started in India. Since then education has 
come under severe threat due to the policies of suc- 
cessive governments bent upon following the World 
Bank's privatization agenda. While the share of higher 
education in the government's total education budget 
has gradually declined over the years, private investors 
have gained more and more access to the market. 
Despite rules to monitor private institutions, 
there is in reality no government control over most 
of the private medical, engineering and other colleges 
mushrooming all over the country. Most of them 
have no infrastructure, offer poor quality education 
and charge very high fees that can’t be afforded by 
even the middle class, let alone the poor. 
  
What are the implications for students? 
First, private investors are setting up large edu- 
sy FA 
cational institutions where entry is based more on 
the capacity to pay or donate large sums of money 
than on merit. In recent years we have also seen the 
emergence of small time fly-by-night operators. 
They claim to charge lower fees and set up illegal 
institutions that are sometimes housed in one-room 
structures, like a dental college we came across 
near Agra,in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. 
Many private institutions in states like Bihar donot 
even have the minimum number of teaching faculty 
required by government rules. Whenever there is an 
official inspection, they simply hire extra profes- 
sors who disappear afterwards. 
In clear violation of a Supreme Court order 
passed in the mid-1990s, some private institutions 
allocate places beyond stipulated limits to those who 
have money instead of giving opportunities to meri- 
torious students. There were reports that during the 
most recent admissions to a private medical college 
in the southern Indian city of Manipal, the highest 
bidder paid Rs 26 lakhs ($58,000) for a place. 
Even in government institutions, fees are being 
hiked to such an extent that meritorious students 
from poorer families are finding it harder to pursue 
their studies. Universities are now expected to raise 
25 percent of their recurring expenditure through 
fees and other methods. We found that due to a 
cash-crunch, many government-run institutes were 
unable to upgrade their laboratories and syllabi. 
Has commercialization improved the quality of 
education? 
No. The overall quality of private educational 
institutions is abysmal, though there may be a 
few exceptions like the Pai group of educational 
centres operating in southern India. Our own stu- 
dies found that some promoters of private edu- 
cational institutes openly violate the laws of the 
land, primarily through the fact that they run their 
institutions in the name of trusts, meaning without

a profit motive. Despite making huge profits 
through students fees, these private institutions 
submit records showing that they are not making 
any and claim that they're re-investing the money 
to set up more institutions. 
What kind of public response has there been? 
People are upset, but they don’t have a forum to 
protest. Apart from the left, even mainstream political 
parties are not bothered about this. A large section of 
the media has failed to take up the issue and 
concerned students are not allowed to raise their 
voice. In fact, the government did not give permission 
to the SFI to hold a rally on the issue in New Delhi 
last September, but we organized demonstrations 
in most state capitals. In November, we plan to mobi- 
lize 100,000 students in Delhi to protest against the 
commercialization of education. | 


### 121216: Beyond economics

Beyond economics 
Unless policymakers take a more all-round view of education, 
they risk sending their countries down the wrong path 
YIN CHEONG CHENG   
CENTRE FOR RESEARCHAND INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION, HONG KONG INSTITUTE OF EDUCATION 
ver the past decade, educational change 
in most countries has been driven by 
one imperative:survival in the global 
economy. This process has been parti- 
cularly salient in the Asia-Pacific region 
following the drastic shock of the 1997 economic 
downturn. But in the current reform process, 
marked by speeding commercialization and eco- 
nomic preoccupations, other educational missions 
are being ignored,and countries risk paying a high 
price for their shortsightedness. 
There’s no denying that economic considera- 
tions are critical in today’s world.Students have to 
acquire the knowledge and skills to survive and 
compete in the global economy, especially one 
which more than ever before prizes human capital. 
A high-quality labour force gives nations a cutting 
edge in global competition.Understandably, stres- 
sing economic returns in the current educational 
debate attracts private resources. But education 
has other functions that are the indispensable corol- 
lary of more balanced, equitable development. They 
deserve to be briefly explained. 
The first is a social function: education has a 
role to play in facilitating social mobility and brin- 
ging about integration in often very diverse consti- 
tuencies. It is at school that children learn how to 
form a broader set of relationships, to live toge- 
ther and become aware of belonging to a commu- 
nity. Linked to this is education’s political function: 
schools are there to teach us civic attitudes, to make 
us aware of our rights and responsibilities —in 
essence, to become responsible citizens. The task is 
fundamental in light of democracy’s advance in so 
many countries over the past decade or so. Then 
there is education’s cultural function.Developing 
creativity and aesthetic awareness, accepting other 
traditions and belief systems while valuing our own 
are all part of the path towards fulfillment. Finally, 
education is a goal in and of itself. Schools help 
children learn how to learn and play a pivotal role 
in transferring knowledge from one generation to 
  
the next. I believe that all these facets of learning are 
critical for the long-term prosperity of our societies. 
In our globalized, interdependent world, these func- 
tions take on a more international character. Eve- 
rywhere, education has a role to play in eliminating 
racial and gender biases, promoting global common 
interests, movements for peace, and greater inter- 
national understanding, 
Rising above short-term pressures 
to strike a harmonious balance 
While education is widely recognized as the 
spine of the learning society, the complexity lies in 
striking a balance between these various functions. 
The commercialization of education that we are 
witnessing the world over inevitably pushes schools, 
educators, parents and policymakers to pursue short- 
term, market-driven outcomes. Lawyers, bankers 
and businessmen have an increasingly high profile in 
educational debates. Following Southeast Asia’s 
downturnin 1997, they were influential in changing 
the academic mindset. In little time, emphasis has 
shifted from academic achievement to developing 
communication skills, creativity, adaptability. In and 
of itself, this is not necessarily regrettable. The pro- 
blem is that these skills are all perceived to be at the 
service of a supreme economic value. 
Sounder research will be required to analyze 
and assess where the current trends are leading us. 
It is increasingly recognized, however, that unless 
economic growth is accompanied by good gover- 
nance, a fair sharing of benefits, better social and 
environmental protection and attention to culture, 
it will, sooner or later, lead to unrest. It is through 
education that this broad spectrum of concerns can 
be nurtured. Policymakers who have taken stock 
of this holistic mission unfortunately represent a 
minority in today’s educational debates and reforms. 
Their foremost challenge is to manage commercia- 
lization, to rise above short-term pressures and to 
take a more cthical stance towards education, a 
long-term strategic view. n

PE TH 
Garlic. knives and

C S

PRINCIPLE LECTURER IN SPORT SOCIOLOGY AT BRITAIN'S 
SHEFFIELD HALLAM UNIVERSITY 
  
_ 
hree days into England’s new football 
season and Patrick Vieira, France’s World 
Cup and Euro 2000 winning midfield 
Arn is dismissed while playing for 
rsenal against Liverpool, earning his 
cond red card in as many matches. The 
British press is quick to speculate that 
he will quit the English game, invoking 
the player’s own accusations that he has 
been subject to “racist” intimidation from 
players and officials alike. According to 
Vieira, he is being singled out for abuse 
not because he is black, but because heis 
French—a complaint previously made 
by expat footballers like Eric Cantona, 
Frank Leboeuf and Emmanuel Petit. 
Only months before, a defender playing 
for West Ham faced disciplinary charges 
after allegedly calling Vieira a “French 
prat” and joking that “he could smell the 
garlic”’when the midfielder spat at him. 
“What a load of nonsense,” commented 
West Ham manager Harry Redknapp at 
the time. “There is no way he should be 
punished. What for? For having a joke?” 
The true colours of fans 
dancing with a swastika flag 
In England, the cradle of football hoo- 
liganism, the debate over racism in foot- 
ball has evolved. Overt racism among sup- 
porters and abuse directed at black 
players, both of which flourished in the 
1970s and 1980s, have declined steeply in 
recent years in the face of vociferous 
public campaigning, though residual pre- 
judices against foreign players have evi- 
dently been unaffected. Elsewhere, in 
contrast, much less trivial manifestations 
of racism plague the game. Throughout 
much of Europe, football grounds have 
become hosts to deplorable displays of 
supporters’ bigotry, providing outlets

for racist abuse, though the problem stems far beyond match day 
 GILG ELEN ELE themselves felt in Lille, France, during the 1998 World Cup. 
through sporting rivalry to attitudes that 
are either dormant or concealed in society 
at large. 
The recent conviction of Ricardo 
Guerra for the murder of Aitor Zabaleta, a 
Real Sociedad fan from Spain’s Basque 
region, is a case in point. Zabaleta’s death 
came in the aftermath of the stoning of an 
Atletico Madrid supporters’ bus after a cup 
tie played in San Sebastian, during which 
Atletico’s notorious Bastion group of hoo- 
ligans, of which Guerra was a member, had 
chanted “Fuera, fuera maricones, negros, 
Vascos, Catalanes, fuera, fuera” (Get out, get 
out,queers, niggers, Basques and Catalans) 
to the tune of the Spanish national anthem. 
While the official line is that Zabaleta was 
killed only because he followed a different 
football team, the public perception of the 
Bastion’s political sympathies was re- 
enforced during the return game when they 
were captured on film bouncing up and 
down with a swastika flag. 
Several commentators have suggested 
this racial hatred can be explained by the 
influence of neo-Nazi and neo-fascist 
groups inside football grounds. Along 
with Atletico, extreme racism has 
resurged among fans of Real Madrid and 
Espanyol in Spain, Lazio and AC Milan in

Italy, Paris Saint-Germain in France and 
Red Star Belgrade in Yugoslavia. In Italy, 
Udinese’s attempts to sign the Jewish 
player Ronnie Rosenthal were aban- 
doned after anti-Semitic slogans were 
daubed on the club’s office walls, while 
Lazio fans unfurled a banner reading 
“Auschwitz is your country, crematoria 
your home” along with swastikas prior to 
a game with local rival Roma. 
The labelling of particular clubs or 
fans as prototype fascists or racists, 
however, is in fact deceptive. While Ger-

many has one of the worst reputations 
for far-right influence amongst its fans, 
many claim that this image, fostered by the 
German media, does not accurately reflect 
reality. Professor Volker Rittner of the 
Sports Sociology Institute in Cologne for 
example, argues that “Nazi symbols have 
a provocative role; they break down 
taboos. But the point is not political—it is 
to get noticed and mentioned in Mon- 
day’s newspapers.” Even where there is 
evidence of politically motivated racist 
behaviour amongst fans, it is often uns- 
table, contradictory and secondary to foot- 
ball-related enmities. During the World 
Cup Finals held in Italy in 1990, when 
Napoli fans abandoned the Italian 
national team to support their local 
Argentine hero Diego Maradona, “ultras” 
from northern Italy demonstrated their 
hostility towards Maradona, Napoli and 
the southern region by supporting any 
team playing against Argentina. As a 
result, the “racist” elements amongst nor- 
thern fans had no problem cheering in 
passionate support of the black African 
team from Cameroon when they played 
Argentina—the then embodiment of all 
that the northerners detested. 
Race as a weapon in the 
arsenal of ritualized abuse 
In short, the racism on display in Euro- 
pean football matches is more often than 
not dependent on the traditions and his- 
toric rivalries within white fans’ cultures. 
Here the concept of an “effective insult” 
proves useful: fans will tend to use the 
abuse that is most effective and pertinent, 
in an effort to cause the most harm and 
provocation. Supporters of English clubs 
who have rivalries with clubs from Liver- 
pool regularly sing “I'd rather be a Paki 
than a scouse (Liverpudlian)” for the same 
reasons Italian fans throughout the north 
often refer to fans and players of southern 
clubs such as Napoli as “blacks.” In each of 
these cases, the effective insult is chosen on 
the basis of racial outcasts despised by 
both groups of fans, with the obvious aim 
of making the insult as hurtful as possible. 
To state a preference for the racial cate- 
gory “Paki” over the white identity of the 
“scouser” might be seen to add venom to 
the insult, while the association of sou- 
thern Italians with “blackness” plays with 
internal insecurities relating to the region’s 
proximity to Africa. 
These insults only work because of the 
stigma that these racial groups still suffer 
in the minds of large swathes of white 
European society. As such, race often 
stands on the sidelines, ready to be mobi- 
lized in circumstances where it is deemed 
appropriate within the ritualized abuse of 
a football game rather than forming the 
political core of fans’ identities. The fact 
that many of the Italian ultras’ chants are 
adapted from traditional communist and 
fascist songs is, in itself, no more evidence 
of political sympathies than the extensive 
use of hymn tunes among British fans is 
evidence of ecclesiastical affiliation. 
Comparisons between the insults 
levelled in football grounds across the 
world only goes to prove that racism 
emerges against a backdrop of shared 
prejudices among supporters. In Brazil, 
for instance, where many fans are from 
ethnic groups who are themselves mar- 
ginalized and discriminated against, racist 
Ducking the issue 
IFAs Executive Committee responded to 
the incidents in Spain and Italy by decla- 
ring that it “vigorously condemns these 
public demonstrations of racism. This type 
of behaviour, whether visible on the pitch, 
the terraces or outside the stadium,is unac- 
ceptable.” While this may be a laudable 
development, such statements do not dis- 
guise the lack of action against football 
administrators such as the president of the 
Turkish team Trabzonspoor, Mehmet Ali 
Yilmaz, who called the black English striker 
Kevin Campbell a “cannibal” and “disco- 
loured,” forcing him to go on strike before 
he was transferred to the English team 
Everton. u 
Trouble in 
Strasbourg 
or the manager and directors of 
Strasbourg’s Racing Club, the season 
could not have started in a worse fashion. 
Following a string of bad results, an estima- 
ted 50 fans of the dub in France's Alsace- 
Lorraine region barracked manager Claude le 
Roy and grunted like monkeys at two of the 
club's African players. Days later, a wall of the 
club's stadium was adorned with a swastika 
and the words “Le Roy, dirty Jew.” The 
Racing directors immediately filed a com- 
plaint for indting racial hatred against the 
suspected culprits, sparking an investigation 
by local prosecutors. [| 
abuse is rare (and is substituted by sexist 
derision). In England, the success of black 
players has shifted prejudice to the kind 
of race-fuelled denigration mentioned 
above or to the xenophobic “humour” 
endured by Vieira. In Eastern Europe, 
and to some extent in Germany and Italy, 
a comparative lack of black players has 
left racist insults of these footballers as a 
potent weapon in supporters’ armoury 
of abuse. 
The spectre of racism in the football 
ground certainly is appalling, but its roots 
lie neither in far-right factions nor in the 
particular characteristics of fans. Violent 
footballing antagonism is the circumstance, 
but European society is the cause. |

Victory euphoria in Fra 
PETHI CS 
nce at the end of the 1998 World Cup. 
but discrimination lingers on 
BY TIM CRABBE 
PRINCIPLE LECTURER IN SPORT SOCIOLOGY AT BRITAIN'S 
SHEFFIELD HALLAM UNIVERSITY 
  
V\frine in the liberal English national 
newspaper The Guardian after the 
French World Cup victory in 1998, Nick 
Fraser suggested that “no man or woman 
really believed in a multicultural France... 
French people probably merely wanted 
foreigners to be more like themselves.” 
His remark seemed to fly in the face of 
France’s cup-winning exuberance. Just as 
major sporting tournaments offer some of 
the last spaces in which notions of identity 
and nation can be ritually expressed and 
celebrated, victory can also seem to 
breach, or even dissolve, racial differences 
within a country. And the French national 
team’s achievements in winning the World 
Cup and Euro 2000 were widely credited 
as such a triumph over traditional, cultu- 
rally homogenous nationalism. 
The French national team which 
achieved these feats displays an incredible 
diversity, with many of its stars born outside 
of metropolitan France, including Marcel 
Desailly, Patrick Vieira and Lilian Thuram. 
Others like Youri Djorkaeff, Thierry Henry, 
the talismanic Zinedine Zidane and the

Garlic, knives and banners: 
A TRICOLOUR TRIUMPH? 
France's recent footballing successes have been hailed as victories over racism, 
Championship Final scorers Sylvain Wil- 
tord and David Trezeguet, would qualify as 
what France’s Jean Marie Le Pen, leader of 
the extremist National Front party, would 
call “Francais de souche récente,” mea- 
ning that such players are not “real” 
Frenchmen because their parents were 
recent migrants. 
French Sports Minister Marie 
Georges Buffet stated in the aftermath of 
the Euro 2000 victory that the multi- 
ethnic side proved France had created a 
harmonious society “that could do great 
things together.” The prominent presence 
of Arab and black citizens among the 
celebrating crowds in the capital 
appeared to back Buffet’s point, espe- 
cially given that the French had pre- 
viously suburbanized urban poverty and 
largely confined its immigrant popula- 
tions to the desolate banlieue ring sur- 
rounding Paris. 
Notions of diversity, however, can still 
be seen as little more than a style of natio- 
nalism that assimilates (rather than 
excludes) newcomers and insists on one 
universal sovereign identity. What mattered 
in the victory party was that Arabs and 
black 
citizens were cheering for a France whose 
identity had already been secured in their 
absence. Deeper patterns of discrimina- 
tion had certainly not been resolved. 
Paris’ racially stratified geography was 
once again apparent the morning after, as 
the same Arab and black citizens lauded as 
symbols of a new united France returned 
to their homes on the outskirts of the city. 
Meanwhile, the multicultural band of 
players who won the Euro 2000 trophy 
have now returned to luxury homes in 
Italy, England and Germany where they 
play their club football—managed by 
white coaches, paid by white directors and 
watched by white spectators. 
The enduring stereotype 
of brain versus brawn 
The pretext for these sporting hierar- 
chies may well be the culture of Europe’s 
former colonial powers, in which white 
settlers ruled indigenous “coloured” popu- 
lations on the basis of the supposedly 
greater rationality of white people as 
against the sensuality, lack of emotional 
restraint or intelligence of the “native.” 
The continuing power and resonance of 
such notions were reflected in the inter- 
pretation of the outcome of Euro 2000 
by the left-wing French daily, Libération, 
which claimed that “France’s victory, its 
secret, is without doubt based on the win- 
ning combination of two styles—physical 
and technical.” Sadly, the metaphor ‘phy- 
sical = black, technical = white’ is only 
thinly disguised within such analyses, 
which do little to move beyond the racial 
differences implicit within the concept of

he Bot year holidays are nearing. Ima- 
gine you have decided to give books as 
presents to all your friends and relatives, 
who are interested in just about every- 
thing. The decision 1s made, but where 
Id you buy them? The standard 
choice 1s your local bookshop. There you 
will probably find a professional book- 
seller who will be able to recommend the 
most interesting books for each of your 
friends, tell the difference between a 
paperback and a pocket edition, and 
order from the publisher or distributor 
any book he or she does not have in stock. 
If you live in France, Spain,Germany 
or any of the other six European Union 
countries that have a single-price policy 
for books, it will cost you exactly the same 
whatever bookshop or department store 
you go into looking for the cheapest price. 
And if you are a good customer, the 
bookseller may give you a five percent 
discount,which is usually the maximum 
allowed under the fixed-price laws. 
This system is founded on two basic 
principles: that the same book should 
cost the same wherever it is bought, whe- 
ther in the centre of Berlin or the only 
shop in a tiny Bavarian village, and that 
unlike shoes and clothes, the price will 
stay the same all year round because sea- 
sonal discounts are not allowed. Under 
this arrangement, the publisher usually 
sets the price of the book, giving the book- 
seller a profit margin of about 30 percent. 
But if you live in Belgium, Sweden 
or the United Kingdom (where book 
prices were deregulated in 1995), you will 
find big differences from shop to shop 
because the booksellers themselves can 
set the prices. Although this seems at first 
sight to benefit the reading customer, the 
book trade is divided over it. In a world of 
disappearing national borders, transna- 
tional authorities such as the European 
Union are therefore seeking a degree of 
standardization which, while obeying the 
laws of competition,is fair to everyone. 
The advocates of the fixed-price 
system hold up Germany as an example.

The price of books in recent years has pitted small independent bookshops against

than 1,200 publishers, it is one of the 
driving forces in the print word. Or France 
where, unlike the film industry’s depen- 
dence on government aid, publishing is 
self-sufficient. In both countries, all those 
involved in the book trade—authors, 
publishers, distributors and booksellers— 
ardently defend the fixed-price system. 
Similar attitudes can be found in Spain, 
where the government has deregulated 
discounts on textbooks for the current 
school year, unleashing noisy protests 
from writers, publishers and booksellers. 
The French publishers’ magazine Livres 
Hebdo reports that in the United Kingdom, 
where both systems have operated over the 
past decade, five years of deregulation have 
seen the price of books rise 16 percent, far 
more than the nine per- 
cent rise in the cost-of- 
living. One result of this, 
  
prices only works for the best-selling 
books: the rest are seen as ‘bad quality’,” 
says Markus Gerlach, a German expert 
on book prices. “This argument is quite 
unacceptable when it comes to a book 
of poetry or an essay.” 
Of course books are not the only pro- 
ducts with fixed prices. In virtually every 
country, cigarettes, medicine and newspa- 
pers are as well. “Books are a cultural pro- 
duct and as such they deserve every pro- 
tection we can give them, especially as 
they are now threatened by things such as 
pirating and illegal copying,” says J. Ryba, 
who runs a bookshop in Israel.

Under a free-pricing 
system, the law of supply 
and demand will imme- 
diately affect prices, since 
publishers mark up their 
best-sellers to compen- 
sate for losses from the 
discounts handed out by 
supermarkets. The temp- 
tation becomes strong 
just to publish things that 
will sell easily and 
quickly, with a resulting 
loss of diversity. Further- 
more, for every 200 books 
published there is rarely 
more than one best-seller, 
and it is not unusual for 
these to keep on turning 
up in the catalogues of 
the same handful of 
publishers—namely 
those who can afford to 
pay huge advances to the 
most famous authors and 
buy the most expensive 
foreign rights.

months before they can offer the latest

too, because publishers are unwilling to 
take the risk of releasing a book unless

clubs may sell carefully chosen books quite 
cheaply, but they can prove an annoyance 
after a while because you have to buy a 
minimum number over periods of up to 
two years. 
Lastly, the other factor that can make

is tax. If you live in Sweden or Denmark, 
book prices may not be very expensive, 
but you will have to add a 25 percent sales

So what is the best way to buy your 
books? There is no single answer. Do you 
want to give best-sellers, books about 
current affairs, reference books, original 
works or translations? Do you want prose 
or poetry? Full or abridged versions? 
Complete works or anthologies? Hard- 
back or paperback? 
Whatever price you pay, dear reader, 
the future of books is in your hands.

A sister show in Brazil did likewise. Some

favourite contestants back to “real”life. 
Germany, government ministers suggested 
the programme could be declared uncons- 
titutional. Bernard Crick, biographer of 
the author George Orwell, despaired at a 
fulfilled prophecy. People “are simply depo- 
liticized by cultural debasement, dumbed 
down, kept from even thinking of deman- 
ding fair shares,” he wrote of Orwell’s satire 
in 7984, the novel that invented Big Brother. 
The show, he suggested, offered the same 
glitzy “prolefeed.” 
Intimate troubles under 
the glare of spotlights 
So many viewers and such attacks 
would suggest that cameras and humans 
have been striking up a new relationship. 
“Viewers come from all social classes, even 
culturally very high ones,” argues Ignacio 
Bel, a professor in information rights in 
Madrid. “It comes down to a morbid fas- 
cination, to an unhealthy curiosity.” When 
the American channel Court TV briefly 
ran a show in which criminals confessed 
their murders on camera, the concerns 
seemed fully justified. Watch Big Brother, 
however, and privacy fears may be 
allayed. For a start, the participants want 
to be there: their fear is not exposure but 
anonymity, a kind of individual fade-out. 
And though much of the appeal centres 
on the promise of spying a saucy 
moment—sex is always being talked 
about, though rarely had—the truth is 
that the viewer’s diet is less salacious. In 
the British version, contestants overslept, 
tended chickens, photocopied their ana- 
tomy, and decried the utter tedium of 
living on television without watching tele- 
vision. Rather than intrusive, the antics 
44 The Unesco Courier - November 2000 
  
were just excruciatingly banal. 
But look again, and the 
same lack of action can take 
on a different meaning. 
Nothing much happens, no- 
one emits an even remotely 
interesting opinion, but the 
tell-tale reality TV gesture, the 
quick eye-flick, registers the 
nearest camera. Each conver- 
sation, vacuous as it may be, 
treads a perilous line between 
self-expression, impressing 
housemates (who nominate 
each other for eviction), and 
currying favour with millions 
of sofa-bound viewers. The 
effect is akin to a public rela- 
tions assault course. “It 
appealed to the psychologist 
in me,” says 39-year-old Nidi 
Etim from Manchester, 
England.“ Watching how they 
all interacted, who were the natural lea- 
ders, how they coped with the nomina- 
tions.” 
At the heart of reality shows’ popu- 
larity are exactly these interpersonal 
conflicts—the same force which animates 
traditional drama, soap-operas and talk- 
shows. Indeed talk-shows are among the 
closest relatives of reality TV, allowing 
“ordinary” people to thrash out their 
most intimate troubles under the glare of 
studio lights. But the new genre has a 
different focus. Cameras are mounted 
on an island or in a house, and a mini- 
society is invited in. Viewers pry on 
events, monitor reactions, assess beha- 
viour. Instead of an individual’s tale, or a 
daily life, the show is about the society’s 
evolution, the disintegration of an artifi- 
cial assembly via a period of co-operation 
towards a final prize-winner. 
“The best mixture of fiction and reality 
that has existed until now,” insists Elizabeth 
Lopez, producer of Gran Hermano for 
Spain’s TeleS. The shows may be contrived 
(the producers of the U.S. Big Brother tried 
to bribe dull contestants $50,000 into 
making way for a “sexy” newcomer), but as 
Lopez says, the participants “write their 
own scripts.” For many viewers, the struggle 
is all too recognizable. It is the balance 
between staying on the show, getting others 
off the show, and preserving at least a 
facade of solidarity. It is a “script” that the 
modern workplace and family are founded 
upon—battling to be first but staying 
popular. In Internet chat forums, the debate 
centres on who is sincere, who is “playing 
Miss Cool,” who is the villain: in short, 
how each person responds to the chal-

lenge. Add cameras and excessive stage 
management, says social psychologist Peter 
Lunt (see interview opposite), and the 
stakes get even higher. Contestants are 
not just playing with each other, but with 
the very nature of living in a world domi- 
nated by the emotions, language and 
images coined by the mass media. 
With it has come a new kind of cele- 
brity. Graduates from the school of 24- 
hour surveillance such as Holland's Bart 
Spring and U.S. Survivor victor Richard 
Hatch, a gay corporate trainer, have 
soared into fame’s dizzy heights—Spring 
has even launched his own logoed clo- 
thing range. Rather than offer perfect 
teeth,the new stars glitter with ordinari- 
ness: they are people one could know 
before fame won them the services of 
bodyguards and image consultants. Non- 
stop availability of many shows on the 
Internet,gossip sites, public voting, even 
the chance to e-mail participants, rein- 
forces this democratic attraction. Rea- 
lity TV appears to be under viewers’ 
control even as it trumpets media power. 
The cynical appeal 
of a staged life 
Following its early successes, the mix 
of ceaseless documentary and game-show 
is spawning in a frenzy, confining volun- 
teers in buses (De Mol’s new show The 
Bus), locking them to possible mates 
(Chains of Love, De Mol again) or chasing 
them round cities (the extremely bizarre 
game at www.realityrun.com). “Any given 
success is overproduced like mad by imi- 
tators,” says Todd Gitlin, a leading thinker 
on the media from New York University. 
All harmless, say the show’s produ- 
cers. No blood is spilt, and no-one ends up 
poorer. Yet the loops connecting televi- 
sion and society are difficult to untangle. 
It may be fun to watch men and women 
stumble through the hardships with a fat 
lens over their shoulder, but is this not a 
case of television spreading its empire? 
And in so doing, is television imposing its 
own shorthand on the “real” world—its 
typologies, quick characterizations, game- 
show dynamics and ad breaks? 
“I'suspect that the greatest flavoring 
of life that comes from these shows is a 
kind of knowing cynicism,” says Gitlin, 
“an embrace of the idea that everything 
is staged, that feelings are shallow, that 
the difference between life and simula- 
tion is insignificant.” Not a voyeuristic 
hell then, but a televised format to daily 
life: that may be reality TV’s main mes- 
sage. Or, as one man said of his Big Bro- 
ther housemates: “we're soclose ... well, 
I feel we are.” |

CONNEXIONS) 
  
INTERVIEW BY I. B.   
D° you see reality shows as a new tele- 
vision genre, or something that has 
evolved from previous programmes? 
Reality television seems to have two dif- 
ferent origins. One of them is the changing 
form of the talk-show, which from a very 
gentle format based on celebrities’ public 
relations evolved via presenters like Phil 
Donahue and Oprah Winfrey in the 
United States into something that shifted 
interest from the everyday life of a cele- 
brity to celebrating everyday lives. 
Take the programma Queen for a Day 
as an example. This was a gameshow in 
the U.S.in the 1960s for middle-class hou- 
sewives, who would file in the studios and 
be selected on the basis of their hard- 
ships: the people who had the most heart- 
rending and difficult stories got to tell 
them to the audience, there was a vote, 
and the most worthy person was crowned 
Queen for a Day, and given all sorts of 
presents. It was a momentary reversal of 
social status, like putting the ordinary in 
the position of the king, which was done 
in medieval fairs and tournaments 
But to understand reality television, you 
also have to look at another genre, which 
is fly-on-the-wall documentary. In the 
1960s, especially in Britain, this formed 
part of a cultural trend towards repre- 
senting ordinary lives in cinema and tele- 
vision. And what you see there is a move- 
ment from celebration to something 
closer to scrutiny or surveillance. 
But in contrast to fly-on-the-wall docu- 
mentary, the presence of cameras in these 
new shows is absolutely crucial. 
That is very important. Compared to pre- 
vious shows, the new programmes have a 
much more managed feel. Jerry Springer [a 
US. talk-show] is a good example of this 
format. A first person comes on and is given 
lots of time to discuss an intimate problem— 
everything is quite calm. Then there’s a gra- 
dual build-up of tension as other people 
are levered into the process. Then the people 
who come much later get much less time, 
leading much more intensely to an emo- 
tional eruption. The idea is that we've lost 
the ability to express ourselves, and that it’s

### 121221: Inside the emotion machine

All eyes on the reality game 
INSIDE THE EMOTION MACHINE 
Peter Lunt, a social psychologist at University College London and expert on the impact 
of television, pins the vogue for “reality” on changes in public emotional life 
only in these carefully structured and 
managed public spaces that we can do this. 
You can see similar structuring elements in 
other reality shows. There is the inevitability 
of voting, an underlying push in the pro- 
cess that is highly ritualized. 
Are you saying itis increasingly difficult to 
express emotions without some kind of 
intervention? 
I'm not making radical arguments that 
we're completely transformed in our 
emotional life, though some thinkers have 
argued just that. The most I'd want to say 
is that this new mode of public expression 
and scrutiny of emotions is of central 
importance to how we think about our- 
selves and experience our emotions. The 
appeal of these programmes is very much 
based on that. 
How do you explain the success of these 
shows in so many different countries? 
I am inclined to link this to the globalization 
of culture. The new kinds of global social 
relations are precisely formulated through 
mediation, through business, through 
travel, and are not grounded in the tradi- 
In Germany, Jana and Juergen go to their bedroom for the first time in the Big Brother house. 
tional collective social forms. The same 
goes for work, which is no longer a life-long 
career but requires flexibility, adaptability 
and the construction of teamwork within 
organizations. What we now know is that 
we all live in these sorts of artificially 
constructed relations—which are not arti- 
ficial anymore, but have become our reality. 
How do you interpret the connection bet- 
ween these programmes and new tech- 
nologies, many of which seem to under- 
mine people’s privacy? 
There’s been a lot of vague talk recently 
around issues of privacy. In the case of e- 
commerce, for instance, everyone knows 
that companies have a lot more informa- 
tion about them. So there’s something 
being worked through here about this 
extraordinary explosion of information 
about individuals, and what this implies 
for how they can live and be private, 
expressive individuals. The programmes 
stand I think as a metaphor for that— 
and no more. The shows work because 
they push these buttons, though they defi- 
nitely don’t provide any interesting ana- 
lysis of the question. n

### 121222: Maryse Condé: grand dame of Caribbean literature

  
  
IViaryse 
Conde: 
grand dame of 
Caribbean literature 
  
The celebrated author speaks 
openly of her new book, passion 
and politics with Elizabeth 
Nunez, a leading literary light 
from Trinidad 
N:I was very moved by a talk 
you gave two years ago about 
growing up in Guadeloupe 
and thinking of yourself as no 
different from a French 
person. Could you talk about 
why it was important for you 
to go to Africa? 
MC: Elizabeth, I remember when I took 
you to a restaurant in Guadeloupe how 
surprised and shocked you were to see 
that all the cooks and waiters were 
white, French people. So imagine what it 
was like growing up in Guadeloupe 
some years back. The teachers in the 
schools were French. The priests, when 
we went to Mass with our families, were 
white. We lived in a completely white, 
French environment. It seemed normal 
to me. I did not ask any questions. Of 
course, when I looked at my face in the 
mirror I could see that it was black, but 
for me, colour was totally unimportant. 
I felt I was exactly like the people 
around me, that is to say, French and 
 
white. Then when I went to France I dis- 
covered that the colour of my skin 
meant something. It was not an acci- 
dent that I was black. There was a deep 
difference between me and the people 
whose skin was white. I had to go to 
Africa to discover the meaning and 
importance of that difference. 
EN:And what did you discover? 
MC: At the beginning I thought the dif- 
ference was that black people had a 
common culture that was different from 
the culture of French people. I believed 
that all black people were united by a 
common origin, a common history. We 
were basically one people divided by the 
evils of slavery. I, who was born in Gua- 
deloupe, was separated from the people 
in Guinea, where I was in Africa,simply 
because of the slave trade. 
EN:Do you think differently now? 
MC: I made an important discovery in 
Africa: I did not share the same lan- 
guage as the people in Guinea. We did 
not eat the same food—this may seem 
trivial to you, but it is important. We did 
not dress the same way, we did not enjoy 
the same type of music, we did not share 
the same religion. In a few months, I 
found myself terribly isolated. I could 
not even communicate with my Gui- 
nean husband. So I made a second dis- 
covery:race, in fact, is not the essential 
factor. What is important is culture. As I 
did not share the culture of the Gui- 
nean people, of the African people, I 
left Africa,and, as a result, my marriage 
ended. 
EN: Then would it be fair to say that cultu- 
rally there are now more similarities bet- 
ween you and your husband, Richard 
Philcox, though he is white and British, 
than there were between you and your first 
husband, though he was black and African? 
MC: When I met Richard twenty years 
ago, I was in my period of political acti- 
vism and I could not see myself with a 
white man.My children,also, were very 
nationalistic and so they were shocked 
and disturbed that I would be involved 
with a white man. But eventually I came 
to understand that the colour of one’s 
skin does not matter. I found that a white 
man was closer to me than my first hus-

band, even closer to me than the majority 
of the people I knew. It is a matter of 
understanding: in a word, love. Marriage 
should not be viewed as part of a political 
agenda. It concerns the feelings and per- 
sonal choices of two people 
EN: To return to the time when you left 
Africa, did you go back to Guadeloupe or 
to France? 
MC: One has to make a living, so I went 
to France, though it was difficult there for 
me to find a job. But in France I 
immersed myself in the Guadeloupean 
and Martiniquan society living as a 
person in exile. Five years later, I went 
back to Guadeloupe. 
EN: So what are your thoughts now about 
Africa? Do you sometimes feel ashamed of 
Africa when you hear stories of the cor- 
ruption there? | often think that a cruel 
joke is being played on us today. Just as we 
are beginning to restore our pride in our 
rich African heritage, we are being bom- 
barded with media reports about the cor- 
ruption that seems to be rampant in Africa. 
MC: lived for twelve years in Africa.l 
must confess they were the most difficult 
years of my life. I was in Guinea and 
Ghana. One cannot deny the corruption 
of the régimes there. The people in those 
regions are suffering from the evils of 
their rulers. They are dying of hunger 
and disease. We have to face the fact that 
there is a lot of evil and hardship in 
Africa. But it should not lead us to 
conclude that Africa is inferior. It took 
years for European countries to arrive at 
democracy. Even now many of them 
have not achieved it. France, for example, 
is constantly being ripped apart by strikes 
and riots. So why should we be ashamed 
of the problems of Africa? They are 
aggravated by neocolonialism, by the 
lack of education for the people. This 
situation is the consequence of many 
years of colonialism, of independence 
that happened under the worst possible 
conditions. So I am not ashamed at all. 
Africa is trying hard to find solutions. I 
believe that one day it will. 
EN: In your novel The Last of the African 
Kings you seem to satirize those middle- 
class African Americans who speak only in 
glowing terms about the African people 
and are critical of those who focus on 
the corruption that exists there. You wrote 
about a fictitious “prestigious black col- 
lege in Atlanta where duty towards one's 
race was taught as devoutly as science 
and literature.” 
MC: Those African Americans who think 
this way are simply trying to find a way 
to hide their deep inferiority complex. 
They are ashamed of Africa as it is today,

and they prefer to lie about the corrup- 
tion and evil there. Let’s face it: Africa 
has been robbed of its grandeur, of its 
power, of its magnificence. If we keep 
having the kind of discourse that 
conceals these painful facts, we will have 
an incomplete view of Africa.lt is time 
we realize that we have a duty towards 
the suffering of our people. I am not 
interested in fighting for reparation for 
slavery or for financial aid. am fighting

TT ALK N G TT O -  
to find a solution that I can give to the 
people of Africa who are in despair, who 
need to find a way to restore faith in 
themselves. To quote [Jamaican black 
nationalist] Marcus Garvey, “I would 
like to teach the black man to find beauty 
in himself.” The problem for me is not 
fighting white people who are bad and 
evil, but fighting our own people who 
are bad and evil. 
EN: Yet you write a lot about slavery, 
which I find unusual for a Caribbean writer. 
Caribbean people seem to sweep such 
stories under the rug. We seem to want to 
think well of the “mother country,” of the 
Europeans. Recently, a British expatriate 
reviewer in Trinidad, bristling under the 
criticism of colonialism in my latest novel 
Bruised Hibiscus, implied that | had bitten 
the hand that had fed me. | was shocked 
by the silence that followed her review, 
even from my family. No one stood up to 
say the obvious—that it was | who had fed 
the British through slavery and colonia- 
lism. What do you hope to achieve with 
the stories you tell about slavery? 
MC: People often ask me for whom am 
I writing. The answer is I am writing for 
myself. I write about slavery, Africa,the 
condition of black people throughout 
the world because I want to order my 
thoughts, to understand the world, and to 
be at peace with myself. I write to try to 
find answers to the questions I ask 
myself. Writing for me is a type of the- 
rapy, a way to be safe and sound. 
EN: So you don’t have an instructive goal 
in mind? 
MC: No, not really. It would be too easy to 
say that I am writing to educate my 
people. For the early generation of writers, 
like Aimé Césaire, that was their goal— 
teaching, writing for their people. For 
myself, for my generation, we are much 
more modest. We are writing to make the 
world understandable to us first of all, 
and if it is understandable to us, perhaps 
others will understand the world better. 
EN: Is this why you do not write your 
books in Creole? According to some intel- 
lectuals like Patrick Chamoiseau in Mar- 
tinique, as Caribbean writers we should 
write our stories in Creole, the language 
of the majority of the people in the Carib- 
bean. 
MC: I refuse to accept that kind of dicho- 
tomy between French and Creole. As I 
like to say, Maryse Condé does not write 
in French or Creole. Maryse Condé writes 
in Maryse Condé. Each of us has to find a 
voice, a way of expressing the emotions, 
the inner impressions that we have, and to 
do that we should use all the languages 
that are at our disposal. In my last novel, 
Célanire cou-coupé, there is a glossary at 
the end of the book. In it you will find 
words in African languages, in Creole lan- 
guages, in Spanish. In order to express 
the story I wanted to tell, in the manner I 
wanted, I had to use many resources. That 
kind of narrow choice between French 
and Creole is a political choice. In politics 
it is necessary to speak in the language 
that can be best understood by our 
people, that is closest to our people, but 
when we write, we should be totally free 
to choose the medium that is best suited » 
NUNEZ IN 
FULL BLOOM  
  
" ¢ till waters run deep.” The worn expres- 
Seon takes on a polished gleam with Eli- 
zabeth Nunez, who sends readers reeling 
with her latest book, Bruised Hibiscus, in 
which she reveals the pain and vengeance 
of two women who dare to defy the political 
and cultural taboos of colonial Trinidad in the 
1950s. The dizzying force of the novel seems 
at odds with the author's privileged upbrin- 
ging in Trinidad and now tenured position as 
English professor and director of the Black 
Writers’ Institute at Medgar Evers College in 
New York. At the age of 56, Nunez appears to 
use her own security as a springboard-rather 
than refuge—to explore life's passions. 
In addition to her three novels and scholarly 
publications, Nunez also contributes to the 
literary world as director of the National 
Black Writers’ Conference, which aims to 
improve opportunities for authors of colour, 
especially those from her beloved Carib- 
bean. [|

EN: And for you, is that language French? 
MC: My French, my own brand of French. 
It is not the language you hear in France. 
It is a combination of the language of a 
person born in Guadeloupe, who listens to 
the many different sounds of language, 
and my own personal language. 
EN: So what makes someone an authentic 
Caribbean writer? 
MC: I hate the word authentic. Here, I 
am, Maryse Condé, born in Guadeloupe,

living and working in New York. Here 
you are, Elizabeth Nunez, born in Tii- 
nidad, working and living for most of 
your life in New York. We are both 
authentic Caribbean writers. It is a ques-

how we see our place in the world, how 
we see ourselves and who we are.

Edwidge Danticat [a young Haitian 
author living in New York] is writing an 
aspect of Caribbean literature. You,Eli- 
zabeth, are writing an aspect of Carib-

home—Patrick Chamoiseau for 
example—they are writing an aspect of

phony which is Caribbean literature. I am

only one narrow definition.

the women who have influenced my life: 
those who refused to see themselves as 
victims and took charge of their lives. There 
are also very strong female characters in 
your novels. Would you say you are a femi- 
nist writer? 
MC: My answer is similar to yours. I was 
educated by a strong mother and a strong 
grandmother. My sisters are strong. All 
the women I knew in Guadeloupe were 
strong. They triumphed over the condi- 
tions that limited them. My books are a 
reflection of what I see in life. I don’t think 
I am a feminist. I write about what I know.

you have more personal reasons for wri- 
ting your novel? 
MC: Somebody gave me Emily Bronté’s 
Wuthering Heights when I was about 15 and 
was still living in Guadeloupe. I was a very 
sombre child, a very lonely child. My mother 
died when I was very young and for years I 
tried to reconnect with her. I looked for her 
everywhere, in nature, everywhere. When I 
read Wuthering Heights, 1 felt it was written 
for me. I identified completely with Heath-

### 121222: Maryse Condé: grand dame of Caribbean literature

TT ALK  
to find Cathy after her death. I wrote my 
novel to prove that in spite of differences 
in time, conditions, or ideology, women 
could communicate with each other 
because we share common desires and 
experiences. Emily Bronté could speak 
to Maryse Condé more than a century 
later because her story was similar to my 
personal history. I was compelled to 
rewrite Bronté’s story, not to show the 
differences between Caribbean women 
and English women, but,rather, to show 
what we had in common. 
EN: I notice that you begin the book by 
saying you hope Emily Bronté will approve 
of your interpretation of her masterpiece. 
Did that wish for her approval limit you in 
any way? 
MC: I must confess that I totally forgot 
Emily Bronté, the author, when I was 
writing my novel. What I concentrated on 
was the passion between Cathy and Hea- 
theliff, the excessive love that fused these 
two characters. But I read Bronté&’s novel 
often, and I kept it on my desk open to 
the page where Cathy says, “I am Hea- 
theliff.” That is a beautiful line. It tells 
about the intensity of passion possible 
between two people. When I was fini- 
shed writing my novel, I wondered what 
Bronté would think of it, but it was not a 
serious question I asked myself. I never 
tried to compete with Bronté. She posed 
no problem for me. 
EN: Can you talk a little about your work at 
Columbia University? | know you created 
the Department of Francophone Studies 
there. In fact, you are the chairperson. 
MC: In New York there is a lot of space 
devoted to the English- and Spanish- 
speaking Caribbean people, but there is 
hardly any space for French-speaking 
Caribbean people. It seems as if we don’t 
exist. When I tell people I am from Gua- 
deloupe, they are puzzled. They have 
never heard of Guadeloupe. When I was 
invited to teach Caribbean literature at 
Columbia University, I felt I had a duty 
to use my position to create a depart- 
ment to attract people from the French 
Caribbean so that they would have a 
space to talk about themselves and about 
their work and so make their presence 
known. I won’t say I changed the face of 
New York—that would be arrogant— 
but at Columbia, at least, people now 
know that Aimé Césaire is not the only 
Francophone writer from the Caribbean. 
EN: You are far too modest, Maryse. | 
know you are also an advocate for all 
Caribbean literature. Not only have you 
organized some major conferences on 
the subject but you recently established 
the book prize, Prix Des Amériques Insu- 
laires et de la Guyane, for the best literary 
work written in any of the languages of 
the Caribbean. 
MC: Some people criticize me for accep- 
ting money from Amédée Huyghues Des- 
pointes who funded the prize. They say he 
is a béké [a white Creole from the planto- 
cracy|, but the man loves Guadeloupe as 
I'love Guadeloupe. He is concerned about 
the country’s future. We are in the year 
2000. We should be finished with these 
divisions between black and white and 
move towards unity. 
EN: You have a new book, Célanire cou- 
coupé. 
MC: It’s a departure from my other 
novels. My daughters have been com- 
plaining that all my novels are sad and 
painful, so I wrote a comical novel, a fan- 
tastic novel. It is based on a story I read 
in a newspaper in Guadeloupe, in 1995, 
about a baby girl who was found dead, 
her throat slashed, in a heap of rubbish. 
EN: That doesn’t sound like a happy novel, 
Maryse. 
MC: Listen and tell me what you think. 
Everyone wanted to know why the baby 
was killed that way. I mean, a woman who 
wants to get rid of her baby doesn’t usually 
slash the baby’s throat. There is a special 
cruelty and malice in doing such a thing. So 
ry 
people in Guadeloupe began to specu- 
late that the baby was used as a human 
sacrifice. In my novel, I imagined she was 
brought back to life by a doctor who 
repaired her throat. The girl then goes in 
search of those who murdered her. 
EN:That is a very sad story. 
MC: Wait. The girl begins to attack eve- 
rything that we think of as sacred. For 
example, she goes to Africa at the begin- 
ning of colonization. When she sees that 
colonization is failing because there is no 
communication between Africans and 
Europeans, she decides that the way to 
improve the situation is to have a bor- 
dello where African women could make 
love to white men. Ah, you are laughing. 
EN:That is funny. 
MC:So, you see, I was not wrong to say 
the novel is comical. 
EN: Farcical. 
MC: Yes, that is the word. 
EN: How do you manage to do all that 
you do, Maryse? You are a magnificent 
writer, you have a brilliant career as a 
professor, scholar, administrator, literary 
activist, mentor to fledging writers, and 
yet you have a very active family life. 
MC: Honestly, I do not have an answer. 
I do not make an effort to be one or the 
other. am everything at the same time. m 
CONDEATTHEHELM 
New York and Guadeloupe 
1998); The Last of the   Kings 
toryteller, activist, teacher and critic—but perhaps one title best applies to Maryse Condé: navi- 
Serr For the grande dame of Caribbean literature incites us to explore ever-shifting terrain, 
from the cruelty of the slave trade and the self-hate caused by racism to the spiral of lovers’ pas- 
sion. In threading through the web of relations between Africa, the Caribbean and Europe, Condé 
calls on her personal experience. Born in 1937 in Guadeloupe, she left her comfortable family at 
the age of 16 to study in Paris, where the spirit of decolonization and the Négritude movement 
led her to criss-cross Western Africa, first with her Guinean husband and then as a single mother 
of four children. Returning to Paris in 1973, she completed a doctorate in Caribbean literature from 
the Sorbonne while launching her literary career. Her first great success was her Sequ series 
(1984), renowned for its historically accurate and engaging portrayal of the impact of Islam on ani- 
mist West Africa and the brutality of the slave trade. 
In 1985,Condé won a Fulbright scholarship to teach in the U.S. and went on to set up the Cen- 
ter for French and Francophone Studies at Columbia University where she continues to teach. Her 
11 works of fiction (translated in several languages) have earned her numerous prizes, including 
the prestigious French awards, Le Grand Prix Litteraire de la Femme (1986) and the Prix Yource- 
nar (1999). Perhaps more importantly Condé is one of the few “foreign”authors to be accepted 
by Africans as one of their own.She and her husband,Richard Philcox,divide their time between
