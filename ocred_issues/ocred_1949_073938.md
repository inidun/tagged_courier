~ Programme 
LBERT EINSTEIN was born 
A seventy years ago, on 14 March 
1879, in Germany. When he was 
) still a boy, his family moved first 
to Switzerland and then to Italy. He 
wasn’t a very bright boy. He didn’t care 
for any school subjects, except mathe- 
matics; and he disliked the discipline 
of German schools enough to run away 
at least once. He had some difficulty in 
qualifying to take a degree. And the best 
job he could get was as a minor official 
in the Swiss Patent Office. 
rt is what Einstein was in 1905: a 
junior Swiss patent official. But that year, 
1905, was his annus mirabilis, his wonder- 
ful year. In that year, at the age of 26, he 
published a series of papers which made 
outstanding advances in three quite 
separate branches of physics. The most 
famous of these was his first paper on 
Relativity. In ten years from 1905, 
Einstein created a revolution in physics. 
He became at the same time a recognized 
leader and the enfant terrible of science. 
OR the seventieth birthday of Albert 
IF Einstein, the greatest scientist of 
our generation, and one of the great 
men of our time, Unesco prepared a 
special radio programme for its “World 
Review”. 
The persons whom Unesco invited to 
pay this Tribute to Albert Einstein, the 
man, the scientist and pioneer of the 
human spirit, are themselves leaders of 
science in our day: the famous American 
scientist and educator, Dr. Arthur Comp- 
ten; the distinguished French mathema- 
tician, Professor Jacques Hadamard; and 
the great Danish physicist, Niels Bohr. 
But they speak not for science alone but 
for all humanity. The homage they pay 
is to the man and the pioneer rather than 
the specialist. And they speak of Einstein, 
and to E.nstein, not as specialists but as 
friends. 
INSTEIN has always DdDeen an 
international man. He was inter- 
national by temperament, and like 
every scientist he was international by 
training; because science is the oldest 
of all international brotherhoods. 
Science speaks a universal language, 
which is built up of the contributions 
.. of men of all ages and of all nations. 
s~. Einstein’s work is unthinkable without 
that of his predecessors, ancient and 
modern, German and Russian, Euro- 
pean and American. 
Unesco has asked Professor Niels 
Bohr of Denmark, to put his work 
into this international perspective. 
Neils Bohr won the Nobel Prize in 1922, 
the year after Einstein. He is with 
Einstein the greatest physicist living, 
and it is characteristic of him that 
his work has been done in many parts 
of the world and with men of many 
nationalities.

### 73939: The Internationalist

THE INTERNATIONALIST 
T is most natural and appropriate 
that the United Nations Educa- 
tional, Scientific and Cultural 
Organization should pay a tribute to 
Albert Einstein on the occasion of his 
seventieth birthday. Indeed, for the 
whole of humanity Einstein's name 
stands pre-eminently for that search to 
extend our knowledge and deepen our 
understanding which is not only the 
spirit and object of science, but which 
forms the very foundation of ail human 
civilization. 
Through Albert Einstein's work the 
horizon of mankind has been immeasur- 
ably widened, at the same time as our 
world picture has attained a unity and 
harmony never dreamed of before. The 
background for such achievement is 
created by preceding generations of the 
world-wide community of scientists and 
its full consequences will only be revealed 
to coming generations, 
Man's endeavours to orient himself in 
his existence beyond the immediate neces- 
sities of life may be traced back to the 
widely spread birth-places of our civiliza- 
tion like Mesopotamia, Egypt, India and 
China and, above all, to the small free 
communities in Greece, where arts and 
science rose to a height unsurpassed for 
long ages. During the Renaissance, when 
all aspects of human culture again 
flourished, most intense and fruitful con- 
tacts between scientific endeavours all 
over Europe took place, as we are remind- 
ed by the names of Copernicus, Tycho 
Brahe, Kepler, Galileo, Descartes, Pascal 
and Huygens, men of many countries 
whose achievements created the basis of 
By 
Professor Niels BOHR 
  
  
    
the edifice of which Newton's genius is 
the pinnacle. 
New Insight 
o HE great advance of natural phi- 
losophy at that time, which came 
to exert a deep influence on all 
human thinking, consisted above all in 
the attainment of a rational description 
of mechanical phenomena based on well- 
defined principles. It must, however. not 
be forgotten that the idea of absolute 
space and time formed an inherent 
part of the basis of Newton's work and 
that also his well-known concept of 
universal gravitation constitutes an ele- 
ment so far not further explainable. 
It was just at these points that Einstein 
initiated quite a new development which, 
in an unforeseen manner, has deepened 
and rounded our views and given us new 
insight and power of comprehension, 
The way leading to this turning point 
was paved by the development during the 
nineteenth century, of our knowledge of 
the electromagnetic phenomena which 
has brought such a great increase in 
human facilities and created the modern 
means of world-wide communication. 
This development was furthered by an 
ever more active international co-opera- 
tion, the extent of which is recalled by 
such names of many nations as Volta, 
Cersted, Faraday, Maxwell, Hertz, Lo- 
rentz and Michelson. Gradually, however, 
the growth of knowledge in this new field 
disclosed more and 
_ description of our 
more clearly the  . 
difficulties and paradoxes inherent in 
absolute space-time description. 
A quite new outlook was here cpened 
by the genius of Einstein, who changed 
the whole approach to the problems by 
exploring the very foundation for the 
experience. Thus, 
Einstein taught us that the concept of 
simultaneity of events occurring at 
different places was inherently relative, 
in the sense that two such events which 
to one observer appear simultaneous, may 
seem to follow each other in time from 
the standpoint of another observer. 
‘This recognition of the extent to which 
the account of ‘phenomena depends 
essentially on the motion of the observer 
proved, in the hands of Einstein, a most 
powerful means of tracing general phy- 
sical laws valid for all observers. 
In the following years, Einstein even 
succeeded in attaining a viewpoint wide 
enough to embrace the gravitational 
phenomena, by extending his considera- 
tions to the comparison of the effects 
experienced by observers with accelerated 
movement relatively to each other. Out 
of Einstein's novel approach to the use 
of space and time concepts grew gra- 
dually a wholly new attitude towards 
cosmological problems, which has given 
most fertile inspiration for the explora- 
tion of the structure of the universe. 
Although simplicity and beauty are 
the principal marks of Einstein’s fun- 
damental ideas, the detailed treatment 
of complex problems often demands the 
use of abstract mathematical methods 
like non-Euclidean geometry. As often 
before, it has here been most fortunate 
that such tools were ready as the fruip 
of the work of older mathematicians.

### 73940: Is a world council of philosophy really necessary?

IS A WORLD 
of Philosophy 
Really Necessary ? 
By Robert FAWTIER 
Professor at the Sorbonne. 
N January 18, an Internaional Council for Philosophy 
{ and Humanistic Studies was founded in Brussels. 
Sceptics may smile on hearing of the creation, of 
another organization and of the forming of a new inter- 
r.ational council and may ask themselves what good all 
{ais will do. They may even smile at the mention of 
i.amanistic sciences. For to many of them the human 
sciences, which study Man, his moral behaviour and the 
\arious manifestations of his mind, are not sciences at all 
And then, too, they may probably say that in our age of 
the practical application of science and of the mastery 
. oi matter over mind, the human sciences are of no impor- 
tance or interest whatever. 
It is, of course, true that the natural sciences have for 
more than a century made unquestionable advances, and 
Lave pursued their research and practical applications to 
such a -point that we are sometimes tempted to believe 
1trat their potentialities are unlimited and their work in 
the world unique. But what is not always realized is that 
the results of these sciences, and indeed the sciences 
tizemselves, are in the last resort only manifestations and 
products of the human mind. 
If we examine the matter, we are forced to admit that 
it is man himself, either individu®lly or collectively, who 
has the command of these sciences and of their results, 
and that upon him, and him alone, depends the use that 
is made of them; that it is through him, and him alone, 
that their discoveries will prove a blessing to mankind or, 
alternatively, its utter destruction. 
We see, therefore, that there is after all a certain value 
in knowing about Man, on whom the natural sciences’ 
have conferred powers which primitive times reserved for 
the Divinity alone. 
Now, it is this Man which the human sciences study. 
Little by little, these sciences have revealed to us the secret 
springs of human action. It is through them that we can 
discover how individuals and human communities react. 
Finally. they are the means by which we can, if not 
establish certainties, at least determine with a fair 
measure of preciseness, Man’s potentialities of action, 
either as an individual or as a member of a community. 
The physicist, in splitting the atom, suddenly unleashes 
forces the powers of which frighten even those who have 
discovered them. However, if we allow ourselves to be 
impressed by these immediate practical results, what shall 
we say of the thinker or worker in the human sciences 
who elaborates a theory the social application of which 
is ignored or even despised, but which may one day 
transform man? ) 
The answer will no doubt be that a meeting of phi- 
lologists or linguists, of historians or folklorists has only 
a very relative immediate interest, and that the results 
these research workers obtain will be applied only in a 
more or less distant future. 
“i Qutinoded View of Life 
Such an attitude is simply the survival of a largely 
outmoded view of life. The means of spreading knowledge 
have become so rapid that we cannot say how long it will 
be before a particular theory discovered by the study of 
human sciences will take effect. 
In the past, and not a very remote past, it took weeks 
and months to travel a few thousand miles. Now it takes 
a single day. Formerly it took months, years, centuries 
almost, for an idea conceived and formulated at one ead 
of the world to reach the other end; now it takes a second. 
That is a point of some importance. 
Should we expect the scholars emerging from their 
recent meeting in Brussels to solve all the problems of the 
fluman sciences over night? They would be the first to 
laugh at such a suggestion. What they want ‘to do first 
of all is to learn to work together. 
The human sciences have as their subject Man, gq 
creature of infinite diversity. But they are studied by men 
who, perhaps because of the very nature of their studies, 
‘2nd to work in isolation. Teamwork may be perfectly 
ratural to chemists and physicists and to al) natural 
scientists, but for the human scientist it represents 
something against which he has a tendency to revolt. 
Thus, too, work in the human sciences is often carried 
cn with the idea that it will be linked up only in infinity. 
And yet how often, during research in a specific field, 
&re we not obliged to cast a glance at what is happening 
in parallel disciplines? The truth is that at the present 
time there is no way of knowing what is being done 
in related fields of the social sciences without much waste 
cf time and effort. 
Each of the human sciences has its own separate

tistic Studies, which was created in Brussels on January 
38th, under the auspices of Unesco, 
A small working committee whose members come from

Switzerland and the United States, is to meet at Unesco 
House from March 24th to 26th, to draw up the terms of 
the organization’s constitution. 
When formed, it will replace the International Congress 
yi Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences, which has 
so far arranged the meetings of experts in these fields 
of the Human Sciences. 
Unesco is encouraging and assisting the establishment 
of the new organization so that the scientists it will group 
can work more closely with oiher human scientists 
already collaborating through the International Council 
for Philosophy and Humanistic Studies.

method and rarely troubles about the methods used in 
the other human sciences. Thus one finds that human 
scientists very often “re-discover” things which have 
already been discovered in neighbouring fields. 
The first goal of the newly created Council for Phi- 
losophy. and Humanistic Studies is therefore to establish 
contacts between scientists working in different fields 
and to inform them of what is being done in similar or 
related fields devoted to the study of Man. If in this way 
we could break down the water-tight compartments be- 
tween the different disciplines, research work in the 
humanities would be made considerably easier. An 
observation made by an anthropologist is often valuable 
to a linguist; a discovery by a linguist may teach the 
historian that his enquiries are along the right lines; a 
particular feature in folklore throws light on the literary 
heritage of mankind, 
In order to make serious progress, the human sciences 
need crossfertilization. Up to the present there has been 
little or none of it, and for that reason a clearing-house 
of information on all that is being done in this enormous 
field of world-wide intellectual activity cannot fail to be 
of value, 
Finally, the human sciences—precisely because of the 
difficulty they have in discovering truth—offer another 
advantage for the human mind. The materials they use 
cannot be isolated in a test-tube, or be subjected to 
chemical analysis, or broken up or bombarded by elec- 
trons. Their great merit—we might almost say their 
superiority over the natural sciences—is that even if 
they arrive at the truth they are never sure of possessing 
it. Hence that constant intellectual research, that 
ceaseless criticism of work already done, that constant 
criticism of the materials to hand. . 
In those who practise these sciences all this develops 
a mentality which is sometimes exasperating, but which 
is none the less essential, The critical spirit is a product 
of the human sciences, and it is the critical spirit which 
makes of man what he must be if he is to be worthy of 
that high title: a being who does not accept all that he 
is told, who does not do everything that he is ordered, 
and who reflects before he dcts—in a word, a being who 
is free. 
That is why those systems which want to reduce man 
to the function of a machine or animal do not encourage 
the development of the human sciences. What they want 
is human material which does not think, because—if it 
did—it might come to see that those in command are not 
so much to be feared as they imagine. The critical spirit 
and liberty are indissolubly bound together. For that 
reason it is possible that, by encouraging the establish- 
ment of a Council on Humanistic Sciences which hopes to 
give these sciences a fresh impulse and unite in common 
action all those who make moral man the subject of 
their studies, Unesco may have done the best service to 
its own cause, namely, to give man his intellectual 
freedom, his omly true freedom, and the only possible . 
basis of peace.

### 73942: UNESCO reports education needs of M.E. refugees

Needs of M. 
HE educational and cultural 
needs of over 800,000 war 
refugees in the Middle East are 
described in a report by Mr. P.N. 
Kirpal, Deputy Secretary at the 
Indian Ministry of Education, 
just issued by Unesco. Mr. Kirpal 
recently completed a survey for 
Unesco on conditions in the ref- 
ugee camps in Egypt, Iraq, 
Transjordan, Syria, Lebanon, Pa- 
lestine and Israel. 
“The most urgent task”, Mr. 
Kirpal states in his report, “is the 
  
  
  
E. Refugees 
fight against hunger, cold and 
diseas: and, in the midst of this 
suffering, it may seem fantastic 
to think of introducing a plan 
for education and culture. Yet 
there is no doubt that an educa- 
tional programme should be’ 
planned and implemented at 
once. Very little is being done at 
present.” 
Mr. Kirpal adds: “A wel- 
designed programme can raise 
the refugees’ morale... ond mor- 
ale is the most important factor 
in the present situation... all the 
teachers required can be. found 
among the refugees.” 
Unesco has already allocated 
15,000 dollars to finance a limited 
educational programme and 
hopes to obtain 40,000 dollars in: 
cash or educational materials 
from cther organizations. In co- 
operation with the United Na~ 
tions Relief for Palestine Refu- 
gees and other voluntary organ- 
izations, Unesco js seeking to 
provide education for the 200,000

Deadline Extended 
The closing date of Unesco’s 
two essay and poster competi- 
tions, launched last September 
for school-children, has been 
extended from July 1 to Septem- 
ber 1, 1949, 
The first is open to students 
between 15 and 18 years of age 
and the second to those from 12 
up to 15. Entries may be submitt- 
ed in either of twe forms—an 
essay between 1,000 and 2,000 
words, or a poster not exceeding 
48 x 66 cms. 
The essays and the posters 
submitted should be sent to the

Canada, United States Set Up 
Book Exchange Centres 
'§ NESCO has stressed for a . 
long time that surplus 
books and periodicals, 
which normally go to paper-mill 
for re-pulping, should be made 
available to libraries and other 
institutions in other countries 
through a system of exchanges 
and gifts. 
During a trip last January and 
February to the United States 
and Canada, for Unesco, I was 
able to see that this sysiem has 
now become a reality. In the past 
few months, two book centres 
have been set up in Washingion 
and Halifax to carry out this 
work. 
The first, the United States 
Book Exchange Inc. (U.S.B.E.) was 
established through a grant from 
the Rockfeller Foundation, to 
carry on the work formerly done 
by the American Book Centre. 
In additdon to exchanging pubii- 
cations with other countries on 
the basis of two U.S. items for 
one from overseas, it will send 
free publications to needy insti- 
tutions in war-damaged countries. 
When I visited Washington in 
February, only a few weeks after 
the U.S.B.E. had asked American 
libraries for their surplus publi- 
cations, .over half a million 
volumes had already been re- 
ceived. 
In collaboration with Miss A.D. 
Ball, US.B.E.s Administrative 
Director, I was able to draw up 
a plan for the distribution of 
publications and the co-ordina- 
tion of the Centre’s work with 
that of Unesco. Under this plan, 
still to be approved by U.S.B.E, 
publications will be listed accord- 
ing to subject matter and sent 
to libraries interested in a parti- 
car field. The allocation will

be made on a rotating scale so 
that a different library will have

Association and the Canadian 
Council of Reconstruction, 
through Unesco. It will supply 
free publications to war-damaged 
countries, and when it opened nn 
February 4th had already collect- 
ed 30,000 books and periodicals. 
By the end of 1949 it hopes to 
have dealt with 500,000 volumes. 
In co-operation with Mrs M.N. 
Reynolds, Director of the Centre, 
I drew up a distribution plan 
which is being considered by the 
Book Committee in Ottawa, 
similar to that for the Wash- 
ington Centre. This provides for 
lists of publications to be sent 
to institutions whose names have 
been supplied by Unesco. From 
requests received, Unesco woud 
then submit a tentative alloca- 
tion list to the Centre. 
Although the Centre was set 
up as a short-term reconstruction 
service, it is honed that Cana. 
dian librarians will decide to 
maintain it as a permanent cen- 
tre for book exchange and dis- 
tribution. 
A good example of the way it 
sould help Canadian librarizs 
was given at the opening cere- 
mony, when a librarian of the 
Canadian National Research 
Council came across some tech- 
nical periodicals which her libra-

cultural life, they must take their 
place in the long queue of appli- 
cants for slices of the foreign 
currency available. In most coun- 
tries this total is now very small 
indeed and scientists and scholars 
must compete with the general 
demand for food-stuffs and con- 
sumer goods, and with industry's 
need for machinery and raw 
materials. 
An International . 
Publications Bank 
JroM its very first days Unesco 
has been aware of this prob- 
lem-—the key to educational re- 
construction and cultural inter- 
change. Plans for some kind of 
international publications bank 
were brought forward, and these 
ripened, in 1948, into the Unesco 
Book Coupon Scheme, through 
which individuals and institu- 
tions can now buy, in their own 
currencies, required foreign pub-

lications in the fields of educa- 
tion, science and culture. 
In December 1948 Unesco dis- 
tributed about one hundred and 
fifty thousand dollars worth of 
book coupons to thirteen coun- 
tries. Part of this distribution 
was a gift for reconstruction, but 
most of it was paid for by the 
receiving countries in sterling or 
French francs. ‘The coupons are 
then sold in each country to

des2rving book-users, and paid 
for, by them, in the national 
currency. Thus purchasers are 
able to order the books they need 
from hard currency countries, like 
the United States. 
Mr. MacBean, the system’s 
first client, bought a coupon 
from the British distributing 
body and sent it on to the cen- 
tral selling organization in the 
United States. Unesco paid the 
American bookseller in dollars 
and will, itself, receive sterling to 
the same amount, 
Who then, you might ask, is 
the loser? Nobody, although 
Unesco backs the scheme with a 
hard currency reserve of one

plays the role of clearing-house 
and doesn’t even have any over- 
head expenses as the personnel 
needed to operate the scheme are 
paid out of a five per cent sur- 
charge on coupons sold. 
By-Passing the Barriers 
THE National Central Library 
in Florence, Italy, which suf- 
fered heavy losses during the 
war, has sent in an order of more 
than three thousand dollars for 
French books, otherwise un- 
obtainable. 
A few weeks after the first issue 
of the coupons American book- 
sellers received orders for abcut 
eight thousand dollars, of which 
ninety-five per cent are for scien- 
tific and technical po2riodicals, 
indispensable tools for the re- 
searcher. 
It is being realized more and 
more that the main hindrance fo 
what is genszrally called the free 
flow cf ideas and the interchange 
of culture is an economic one. In 
their way the Unesco book cou- 
pons by-pass this barrier and give 
ihe student in Bombay a chance 
to get the latest work on soil ero- 
sion from Harvard, enable the 
scientist in Budapest to receive a 
newly publishad paper on nuclear 
physics from Paris. Now a hu- 
manist in Czechoslovakia can 
follow the latest developments in 
Shakespearian research and critie 
cism in England. 
Unesco’s book coupon scheme, 
although only run as an experi- 
ment in 1949, has already been 
acclaimed a success in many 
countries as a practical and effi- 
cient means of breaking through 
one of the highest barriers to the 
free flow of books. Unesco now 
has it in mind to develop and 
broaden the scope of the scheme, 
and to include other educational 
aids in the operation. 
[The above article was takem from 
the new weekly radio programme, 
“Unesco World Review.) 
  
 
Book Coupon Echoes 
  
Unesco proposes to continue its book coupon scheme by making a 
further 250,000 dollars available as “hard” currency backing when the 
present experimental period ends this year. It is also heped to find 
other sources of “hard” currency, so that the scheme can be extended 
still further.

Unesco is planning to use its four Science Co-operation Offices at

### 73946: At Paris headquarters UNESCO initiates fortnightly student evening discussions

Unesco Initiates Fortnightly 
Studeni Evening Discussions 
As part of its 1949 plans to 
interest youth in its aims and 
work, Unesco has organized a 
‘series of “Student Evenings” in 
the form of lecture-discussions 
for the benefit of young people 
of all nationalities who are 
studying in Paris. 
With the backing of French 
univers.ty authorities and the 
co-operation of student organ- 
" jzations in Paris, the first of 
these gatherings was held at 
Unesco House on March 9, 
when Unesco welcomed about 
250 students to a discussion of 
the question: “Should There 
Be a World University?” 
Before the opening of a gen- 
eral discussion, short state- 
ments on the subject were 
made by Professor Georges 
Scelle, Professor at the Faculty 
“of Law in Paris, M. Roger Lu- 
tigneaux, Director of French 
Educational Broadcasts. and 
two students from the Insti- 
tute of Political Studies. 
Other subjects to be dis- 
cussed at “Student Evenings” 
on March 23 and April 6, and 
which were voted by the mem- 
bers themselves, are “Orient 
and Occident—unity or diver- 
sity of cultures” and “The 
effect of Illiteracy on Inter- 
national 
tively. 
Relations” respec- 
Unesco hopes that these 
“Student Evenings” will serve 
to stimulate similar student 
activities and interest in inter- 
national affairs, through Na- 
tional Commissions in its other 
Member States. 
  
 
New Indian

Three new broadcasting sta-

India during the month of 
March 1949. They are situated 
at Admedahad, Hubli and 
Calicut, all of which are on, 
or near, the West Coast. This 
will mean that ten new trans- 
mitters have been put into 
operation in India during the 
last eighteen months.

said “nothing 
could come closer to Unesco’s 
aims than the initiative you have 
taken... the words ‘University of 
the Air’ embody our most im- 
portant concepts while illustrat- 
ing the means we have to bring 
them to life”. 
“We are convinced”, he said, 
“and your meeting demonstrates 
an identity of views, that know- 
ledge is as vital to man as food. 
“This University of the Air you 
wish to create will be available 
to all listéners. What is even

### 73947: 67 Nations discuss future of short-wave frequencies

67 NATIONS DISCUSS FUTURE 
OF SHORT-WAVE FREQUENCIES 
OR the past five months, 
representatives of 67 coun- 
tries have been meeting mn 
Mexico City to discuss a question 
that concerns radio listeners all 
. over the world—the future of 
short wave broadcasting. 
Since 1938, when short waves. 
or high frequencies, were last 
allocated at an international Con- 
ference in Cairo, the number of 
countries actively engaged in 
short wave broadcasting has in- 
creased from 20 to 80, and the 
number of short wave stations 
from 250 to 800. But, while the 
needs of modern radio are cons- 
tantly increasing, the number of 
frequencies remains stationary. 
The resulting competition, in 
which many stations operated out- 
side their assigned frequencies. 
has cluttered up the air waves 
with a great deal of unnecessary 
interference. The victim has been 
the radio listener all over the 
world, who has had to struggle for 
good reception out of the conflict- 
ing voices bidding for his atten- 
tion. 
To make a more efficient, more 
orderly use of frequencies, in the 
interests of all, the International 
Telecommunications Union, a 
Specialized Agency of the United 
. Nations, has convoked the In- 
ternational High Frequency 
Broadcasting Conference in Mexi- 
co. An earlier world conference, 
in Atlantic City in 1947, set aside 
a bloc of some 2,150 kilocycles for 
this purpose. The job of the 
Mexico Conference is to establish 
& plan for allocating these fre- 
quencies among the breadcasting 
services of the world. 
Dividing up the frequencies is 
very much like cutting up a cake 
when there is not enough to go 
around. Requests put before the 
Mexico Conference are far 1n 
excess of the frequencies available. 
- How does one decide who gets 
how much? Should it be according 
to the size of a country’s popula- 
tion? Should large countries that 
need high frequencies for aomes- 
tic broadcasts to encompass their 
vast drea take priority over those 
who claim them for broadcasts to 
foreign countries? Which coun- 
Television 
in the U.S.A. 
The recent progress of tele- 
vision in the United States 
was conimented on by M. Bor- 
ge Michelsen, of Unesco’s 
Popularization of Science Di- 
vision, following his return 
early this month from a mis- 
sion to that country, 
“At thé beginning of 1948”, 
M. Michelsen said, “there were 
only 17 television stations on 
the air and some 200,000 
receiving sets in use. While I 
was in America, the Mid- 
Western network was hooked 
up, through a co-axial cable, 
with the Eastern network, and 
it is estimated that at least 
400 stations will be on the air 
within two years and that by 
the end of 1953, 18 million 
receiving sets will be in use.     
tries have a right to the most 
frequencies for foreign broad- 
casting? — 
These are but a few of the 
difficult questions that have kept 
delegates at Mexico debating far 
into the night. At one point, when 
the conference was threatened 
with adjournment without adop- 
tion of a plan, delegates from the 
United States, the Soviet Union. 
the United Kingdom and France 
rose to say that they were con- 
vinced that agreement could be 
reached. The conference by an 
overwhelming majority headed off 
the move to interrupt its work. 
Unesco has followed the confer- 
ence with the keenest interest. 
In response to a suggestion from 
its Director-General, in a message 
to the conference, the plenary 
session adopted a solemn pledge 
that the frequencies assigned at 
Mexico would not be used for 
purposes contrary to mutual 
understanding and tolerance 
The resolution further declares 
that practical measures will be 
taken to ensure that short wave 
broadcasting contributes to the 
development of international 
cooperation and peace, and that 
such measures will be communi- 
cated to the United Nations, in- 
cluding Unesco. 
Thus, quietly, almost unnoticed 
amid the stories of conflict in 
today's newspapers, the nations of 
the world have joined together in 
a code of conduct that would 
make radio, not an instrument of 
psychological warfare, but a voice 
in the service of peace.

Little by little, the new asso-

other countries in Europe and 
even in far-off India. Soon other 
groups—such as students and 
Quakers and Youth .Hostellers— 
became interested and organized 
work camps in France, in mining

They did everything: construct-

In 1948 alone, over 135 Volun-

reconstruction of Europe. With 
volunteers enlisting in increasing 
numbers, a total of 950 camps

THE VOLUNTARY WORK CAMP 
A Rewarding Adventure for Peace 
With Youngsters irom 
their “camp” on a houseboat. 
Rapidly they came to understand 
that differences in cultures can 
be reconciled and that similari- 
ties among people are far stron- 
ser than the differences. 
The common aim of the Work 
Camp movement is to help build 
the peace, or as some of the 
camps themselves have expressed 
it, “build peace through small 
international groups of volun- 
teers working, living and learn- 
"ing together”. 
Work Camps vary in size and 
type of work. Some are large, 
with thousands of volunteers 
pooling their efforts for some 
important job, such as the Youth 
Railway in -Yugoslavia referred 
to above. 
Numerous exemples are how- 
ever provided by the smaller 
groups of 30 to 100 volunteers, 
working on a project of some 
months with a rotating scheme 
for volunteers who offer up to 
four weeks or more of their 
holidays. 
On March 2 and 3, Unesco held 
a conferencé in Paris of the 
organizers of these Voluntary 
Work Camps. Representatives at 
international conferences are 
usually people of mature years. 
It was quite refreshing, therefore, 
to see that at this Unesco mesting 
most of the delegates were in 
their twenties.

Others short, 
dark, ‘nuggety’ 
types, with a 
sprinkling of young girls among 
them.” They came from all parts 
of Europe and America, repre- 
senting 27 organizations. And 
they reported on the past year’s 
work of almost 150 international 
work camps, manned by some 
50,000 volunteers,

camps. As the young organizers 
themselves unanimously agreed, 
the importance of work camps iies 
not only in the “very important 
material contributions to recons- 
truction and construction work 
of public interest”, but also in 
HE Unesco conference laid 
special stress .on the edu- 
cational aspect of work: 
the unique possibilities for “edu-

mon work and through contacts

made possible between indivi- 
duals of varied crigin and

Addressing the group of work 
camp organizers, a member of 
Unesco’s Education Department 
outlined how adult education 
methods, making use of round- 
table discussions. newspapers, 
folklore dances and music, could 
be applied to the camps. Later 
many of the young delegates 
declared that their association 
intended to place greater stress 
on organized educational activity 
during 1949. Some plan a week’s 
seminar just before opening the 
camps, to form the basis for 
further discussions during the 
work period. Other organizations 
intend to set aside one or two 
afternoons each week for educa- 
tional activities in their camps. 
Handbook For Work Camps 
. T the present time, Unesco 
A is preparing a handbook 
on camp organization de- 
signed to assist inexperienced 
associations and camp leaders. 
It will give the results of expe- 
riences gained in planning and 
running different types of camps 
and will be ready for. distribution 
before the 1949 camp season 
begins. On the opening day of 
the conference, Unesc® was able 
to distribute a little pamphlet, 
just off the press, entitled “In 
Work Camps For Peace”. 
Speaking into a Unesco micro- 
phone on the afternoon of March 
2, Miss Susan Fleisher, an Ame- 
rican girl from Philadelpnia, 
summed up her impressions as 
a delegate to the conference. 
“I think that this conference 
of many groups, working through 
different methods towards the 
same idea, is an excellent exam- 
ple of people of the world work- 
ing together, and 1 pevsonally 
find it very exciting. 
“.. (It) has given all of us an 
opportunity to meet one another, 
to exchange ideas 
  
playgrounds, youth 
Work Camps chalked up 
about our programe 
mes, and especially 
to profit from one 
another's experien- 
ce. We are finding 
ways in which we 
can help each other 
through an exchan- 
ge of information 
and persons. 
“We are loping 
that Unesco will 
help us by organiz- 
ing a study camp 
for work camp 
leaders somewhere 
in Europe, as well 
as a post-camp con- 
ference of volun- 
teers to discuss the 
results of our work 
and experience 
while they are 
fresh in our minds. 
What we would 
most like to do, 
sometime in the 
future, is a 
  
 
projece we have been discussing 
this morning. It is called a “Pilot 
Project”. Each organization would 
set up, in a selected area, its own 
work camp as part of an enore 
mous work camp project. In this 
way we could all contribute to & 
common project and yet retain 
our own particular methods of 
work and organization.” 
A few minutes later, a Dutch 
camp organizer. Mr. Meilink, 
spoke into the same microphone 
in his native language. 
“I sincerely hope”, he said, 
“that this conference and its 
relationship to Unesco will further 
the idea of international work 
camps and will make an appeal 
to the youth of the world to join 
hands in an international work 
camp for peace.”

Fundamental Education 
On Marsh 17th an educationist appointed 
by Unesco will arrive in Mexico City to 
make a three months’ 
fundamental education programme. This is 
in response to interest shown by 
Education circles in the rest of 
the world in the way that the Mexican Cul- 
tural Missions attempt to raise the cultural, 
economic and educational level of the rural 
people. Unesco’s expert, Mr. Lloyd Hughes, 
will study this werk and will make a repost 
to educators “abroad”. 
The Colombian Government set up last 
year a model programme 
education at Viani in the Andes and has 
asked Unesco to send an expert to assist 
in this work. Mr. Patricio Sanchez arrived 
in Colombia in February 1949.

### 73950: W.H.O. stresses importance of joint action with UNESCO

Are You A Courier’ W. H. O. Stresses Importance 
| Of Joint Action With Unesco 
] HE year 1949 finds. the human race at grips with the gravest and the most desperate task it ever 
has had to tackle. What is at stake today is,quite simply, humanity’s survival, On all of us 
wherever we live, whatever we are doing, from wherever we come, will depend the answer to this ques- 
tion: will the weapons put at our disposal by modern science spell the end of the human race or the 
beginning of an era of lasting peace and greater happiness? 
The spotlight of the news continues to be focused on various so far mostly unsuccessful—attempts 
made in the last three years to unite the world politically. 
Meanwhile, there is in all countries a growing awareness that the 
challenge will be met only if governments and peoples live up to their 
responsibility to etsure, through effective international co-operation, 
a decent standard of living to every human being regardless of race, 
religion or political belief. 
Acceptance of such a joint un- 
divided responsibility  presup- 
poses, however, the emergence of 
a true feeling of world citizenship, 
the willingness of all men to live 
together as citizens in a world 
community in which local and 
national loyalties are compatible 
with the higher loyalty to hu- 
manity as a whole. In order to 
attain this goal nothing less than 
a radical transformation of the 
traditional patterns of both in- 
dividual and collective human 
behaviour is needed. In short, 
fear and insecurity must be radi- 
cated as predominant elements 
in human relationships. 
Such a task obviously will be 
long and very arduous. To ac- 
complish it wes shall have to eli- 
minate belief in the superiority 
of one national or racial group 
over such—a belief which always 
goes hand in hand with con- 
tempt and hatred of others. We 
shall have to correct the distort- 
ed picture which the majority of 
people have of the world outside 
their own little spheres. We shall 
have to put and end to attitudes 
which unavoidably lead to re- 
sentment, aggresiveness and ten- 
sions. 
Viewed against this appraisal 
of our problems today, the con- 
tribution which such agencies as 
Unesco and W.H.O. can make to 
the solution of these problems 
can hardly be overestimated. 
Unesco, which from its inception 
has recognized that war starts 11 
the minds of men, is devoting all 
its resources to the use of educa- 
tion, science and all branches of 
culture as a means for establish- 
ing understanding among the 
peoples of the world and for free- 
ing men from the slavery engen- 
dered by insecurity and fear. 
W.H.O. considers as its specific 
task to give to all peoples “the 
highest possible level of health”. 
It also aims at enabling men “to

PUBLISHED 
HE second number of Museum, 
Unesco’s quarterly magazine 
devoted to significant new deve- 
Jopmentis in the field of museo-

Dealing entirely with the edu- 
cational aspect of museums, the 
current issue publishes a series of 
articles in English and French 
“on important, unusual, little- 
known or unusually successful and 
suggestive developments in coa- 
nection with museums’ contempo- 
rary role as centres of instruction 
for the ordinary man.” 
The present number, which is 
abundantly illustrated, is divided 
into four main sections: “Mu- 
seums Teach” ; Educational Dis- 
play Devices” ; Children and Mu- 
seums” ; and “The Film and the 
Art Museum”. In each of these 
sections, leading specialists from 
different parts of the world con- 
tribute articles showing “the mu- 
seum in its unigue function as a 
place where one learns by seeing” 
and as a living expression of 
man’s activities down through the 
ages to the present day. 
Museum is the successor to

many years by the Institute of 
Intellectual Co-operation. The 
Unesco publication, however, is 
considerably broader in scope.

exhibitions, the conservation and 
restauration of paintings, and the 
philosophy of museums.

### 73951: Benefits to man-in-street seen in world medical council

    
Benefits to Man-in-Street Seen 
In World Medical Council 
XT April 4, scientists representing over 50 international 
medical organizations will gather at the Palais des Académies 
in Brussels to set up what, to the layman, may sound like a 
forbidding body: a Permanent Council For the Co-ordination of Inter- 
national Congresses of Medical Sciences. 
In reality, this new council may play an important role in making 
the latest results for treating tuberculosis, cancer, heart trouble, 
rheumatism and other prevalent diseases more widely known to 
medical men in different corners of the globe. 
HAT does the Medical Science 
Congress hope to accom- 
plish? Perhaps the following 
story may explain its proposed 
function, in part: 
In the summer of 1947, several 
important international meetings, 
all devoted to related fields of 
medicine, were held simultane- 
ously in widely separated cities 
of the globe. One was a congress 
on cancer meeting in St. Louis, 
in the United States. The second 
was on microbiology in Copen- 
hagen, another on physiology was 
held at Oxford, and the fourth 
on cytology at Stockholm. These 
were all meetings dealing with 
medical subjects in closely asso- 
ciated fields, and many of the 
scientists attending one of the 
congresses keenly desired taking 
part in several of the others. 
Obviously, however, they could 
not be in different parts of the 
world at the same time. 
Through the new Medical Con- 
gress Council it is hoped that 
future international meetings in 
related fields of medicine can be 
so arranged for time and place 
as to present no conflict for me- 
dical scientists wishing to attend 
various congresses. 
  
Unesco Aid Sought 
On World-Wide Science 
Teaching Policies 
An appeal to Unesco for leader- 
ship in establishing worldwide po- 
licies on teaching natural sciences 
has been voiced by the Natural 
Science Teachers Association of 
the United States. 
The apeal called for a “more 
adequate programme of science in 
general education” and suggested 
that Unesco gather information 
and prepare a booklet containing 
a statement of the policies and 
activities of the Natural Sciences 
Departement of Unesco. 
The organization of Science 
Teachers, representing all parts of 
the United States, also suggested 
the formation of an international 
organization of science teachers 
and stressed the importance of 
maintaining freedom of inquiry in 
all fields of science. 
The new medical organization 
will be sponsored jointly hy 
Unesco and the World Health 
Organization, both of which will 
contribute an equal amount for 
its operation. 
The ~ Permanent Council is 
however planned as an indepen- 
dent non-governmental body. 
In addition to co-ordinating 
congresses as to dates and places, 
the Council will provide informa- 
tion to and on medical congresses 
both on their programmes and 
on the technique of holding con- 
gresses. 
An important function of the 
Medical Council will include ma- 
terial assistance to congresses by 
helping in the transfer of funds, 
facilitating international travel 
of their members and by support- 
ing the publication of their 
proceedings. 
Professor J. Maisin, General 
Secretary of the International 
Union against Cancer, will be 
chairman of the new co-ordina- 
tion committee. 
Official Bulletin 
Unesco has begun publica- 
tion of an Official Bulletin, 
which will henceforth appear 
every two months in English 
land French editions, 
Th's new periodical will give 
an account of the important 
official decisions and activities 
of Unesco.     


### 73952: Over 3,000 to attend UNESCO conference in US this month

  
Over 3.000 to Attend Unesco 
Conference in US ThisMonth 
VER 3,000 delegates represent- 
ing some 800 United States 
organizations and communities 
are due to arrive in Cleveland, 
Cthio, at the snd of the month to 
attend the second nation-wide 
conference of the U.S. National 
Commission for Unesco. 
Details of the results of the 
conference, which is meeting from 
March 31st to April 2nd, will be 
published in the next issue of 
the “Courier”. 
The purpose of the conference, 
whose theme “Nations will come 
together not to destroy but to 
construct” was inspired by the 
words of Louis Pasteur, is to 
discuss and demonstrate prac- 
tical ways in which individuals 
and communities can share in 
Unesco’s work. 
One of the principal speakers 
will be Dr. Jaime Torres Bodet, 
Unesco’s Director-General, who 
will give expression to his per- 
sonal faith in Unesco at a public 
meeting in Cleveland's audito- 
rium, which seats 10,000 people. 
Among the other distinguished 
persons due to speak are Mrs. 
Franklin D. Roosevelt, who will 
discuss the Declaration of Human 
Rights; Sir John Maud, of Great 
Britain; Sir Arcot Ramaswami 
Mudaliar, of India; Mr. George 
V. Allen, U.S. Assistant Secretary 
of State and Mr. Milton S. Eisen- 
hower, Chairman of the U.S. 
National Commission. 
After group discussions on six 
special areas of Unesco interest 
and on how community resources 
and individual help can be used 
within these areas, tlie delegates 
will be shown how the Cleveland 
community has been organizing 
in order to earry out Unesco’s 
aims. 
  
Australia Offers To 
Aid War - w ecked 
Museums - 
Museums of Australia have 
offered to help war-wrecked 
museums overseas to replace 
items of minerals, fauna and 
flora used in teaching. In com- 
municating this offer, the Austra- 
lian Government asked Unesco to 
obtain lists of items urgently 
needed by devastated museums. 
Unesco has supplied the Aus- 
tralian authorities with lists 
already received from museums

Krakow, Poland; in Prague and

kia: and Salonica, Greece. 
live harmoniously in a changing 
total environment” and at foster- 
in “activities in the field of men- 
tal health, especially those effect- 
ing the harmony of human rela- 
tions. 
HE “Tensions Project” started 
by Unesco in 1948 is probably 
one of the best examples of how 
the two agencies can work joint- 
ly for international co-operation. 
The value of the project for our 
time is clear from the very defi- 
nition of its general purpose: to 
provide a means by which social 
scientists in all countries may 
contribute the knowledge and. 
experience of their respective dis- 
ciplines to the advancement of 
international understanding. In 
1949 and succeeding years Unesco 
will prepare a series of mono- 
graphs on the “Way of Life” of 
the principal nations of the 
world. It is hoped that the result 
of such an enquiry will stimulate 
the sympathy and respect of na- 
tions for each others’ ideas and 
aspirations and the appreciation 
of national problems. Another 
essential {feature of the same 
project is a combined effort by 
experts in the fields of sociclogy, 
psychology, psychiatry, econo- 
mics and philosophy to explore 
the conditions which must be 
created if attitudes leading to 
international aggression are toc be 
replaced by those leading to co- 
operation among the people. The 
phrase “Tensions project” sounds 
rather cold, technical and aca- 
demic. Buf behind it is nothing 
less than the mapping out of a 
concentrated and integrated at- 
tack on the causes of the ten- 
sions now standing in the way 
of international understanding. 
ANOTHER example of plans 
which Unesco intends to de- 
velop in 1949, with the active 
support of W.H.O., can be found 
in the effort to enable Universi- 
ties and other institutions of 
higher learning to adapt them- 
selves to the needs of modern so- 
ciety and thus to play their part 
in the formation of a spirit of 
true world citizenship in all coun- 
tries, The foundation for this 
work was laid in discussions held 
in Utrecht in the suminer of 
1948, when University professors 
from 32 nations studied such 
vital issues as ‘the changing role 
of the university”, “the univer- 
sity as a force in world co-oper- 
ation”, “Relations between higher 
education and the State”, etc. 
In the beginning of April 1949 
an international conference joint- 
ly sponsored by Unesco and 
W.H.O. will meet in Brussels to 
take concrete steps for the co- 
ordination of Medical Science 
Congresses. For the first time in 
history a permanent Council will 
be established for that purpose 
which will see to it that, through 
the channel of medical cone 
gresses (mankind as a whole may 
benefit from the progress achiev- 
ed by physicians in individual 
countries of individual branches 
of their science. 
It is through projects like all 
of these that Unesco, W.H.O. and 
their sister U.N. agencies intend 
to serve the cause which must 
transcend all our other concerns: 
the building of a physically and 
mentally healthy and stable One 
World.   Just Issued

(Continued from page 1) 
The names of Gauss, Lobachevsky, 
Bolyai, Riemann, Ricci and Minkowski 
here again remind us of the fertility of 
international co-operation in all fields of 
science. And the same may be said of 
Einstein’s other outstanding work. 
For example, his explanation of the 
irregular motion of small bodies in 
liquids, based on the ideas of Maxwell, 
Boltzmann, Smoluchowski and Gibbs, 
made it possible for Jean Perrin accu- 
rately to count the atoms of which 
substances are built. 
We find our- 
selves today in a 
new epoch in 
physical science, 
in which exper- 
imental discov- 
eries and theoric- 
al methods have 
led to a rapidity 
and fecundity of 
progress made 
possible only by 
international co- 
operation of an 
unprecedented ac- 
tivity and extent. 
It is not possible 
in this occasion 
to disentangle the

contributions of individual workers, but 
mention must be made of the guidance, 
at almost every step, which Einstein has 
given us ‘by his Relativity theory and 
by his analysis of elementary quantum 
phenomena. 
Altogether, this short exposition of 
Einstein’s scientific achievements aims at 
giving an impression of the extent to 
which his originality of outlook has made 
him an innovator in science. At the same 
time, I have attempted to remind you 
that all scientific endeavours are parts 
of a great common human enterprise. 
The gifts of Einstein to humanity are 
in no way confined to the sphere of 
science. Indeed, his recognition of hith- 
erto unheeded assumptions in even our 
most elementary and accustomed con- 
cepts means to all people a new en- 
couragement in tracing and combating 
the deeprooted prejudices and com- 
placencies inherent in every national 
culture. 
With his human and noble personality, 
characterized equally by wisdom and 
humour, Einstein himself has through all 
his life, and not least in these latter 
years, worked for the promotion of inter- 
national understanding. On his seven- 
tieth birthday evidence of the veneration 
and: gratitude our whole generation owes 
to him will reach Einstein from many 
sides, and we all want to express the 
wish that the hopes for which he has 
lived and worked may be fulfilled to the 
benefit of all mankind. . 


### 73954: Seeker after peace

SEEKER AFTER PEACE 
  
  By — 
Prof. Jacques HADAMARD 
Noted French Mathematician     
For ten years now, Einstein has sought 
by every means in his power to cement 
the world into ors international com- 
munity, He has fought what divides 
the world, and he has fought towards 
an undiv.ded world. He has been the 
proudest member in the ancient and 
international brotherhood of science; 
and his one wish remains to be as 
proud a member of the new interna- 
tional brotherhood of man. 
Professor Jacques Hadamard, recalls 
some of Einstein’s struggles for peace. 
shall not speak of Einstein's great 
[| contribution to the development of 
modern physics. I shall not speak 
either of his mathematical methods, in- 
teresting as they are, or of the powerful 
way in which Einstein uses them in his 
theory of relativity. 
Of all his discoveries, this is the theory 
which has caused the greatest sensation. 
However, the theory of Relativity was 
known only to scientists at the time that 
the war broke out in 1914. Two ideas of 
the world then stood face to face. That 
which inspired the Germans was eXx- 
pressed in the manifesto of the ninety- 
three intellectuals, which has remained 
infamous from that day. 
A Manifesto Signed by Three 
UT the human conscience replied. A 
|B counter manifesto was signed by 
Einstein and only two others. By 
this gesture, the man whom scientists 
already knew to be great, showed himself 
no less so in his humanity. 
Neither of these two characteristics of 
Einstein—his scientific genius and his 
high moral vision—was then known to 
the general public. That did not happen 
until 1919, when the Royal Society pub- 
lished the astronomatical findings which 
strikingly confirmed Einstein’s prediction. 
Then his scientific fame at once became 
universal; but at the same time it exposed 
him to the most violent ajtacks. 
There were scientis's, even distinguished 
scientists, who believed that his theory 
centradicted commonsense. And non- 
scientists spoke a more violent language. 
Einstein was a Jew. He had also chosen 
Swiss nationality as a youth (for he had 
already disliked the moral climate of 
Germany). And that was enough to have 
his theories called “un-German” and to 
make him unpopular in Germany. 
At this very time, his theories were 
being attacked in France because their 
author was called a German. And 
elsewhere, so-called philosophical and 
political attacks joined forces: Relativity 
was called “Bolshevism in physics”, 
A Turning Point in his Life 
INSTEIN has never ceased to do 
| important scientific work, but from 
that time this was no longer his 
only work. Indeed, his courageous counter 
manifesto of 1914 marks a turning point 
in his thought and his life. From that 
moment his mind was filled with a 
- horror against war, 
“My pacificism is not based on any 
intellectual theory,” he said, “but on a

rant to say a word about Albert 
| | Einstein as a scientist, for it is as 
one who has greatly clarified man’s 
view of his world that Einstein will always 
be remembered. 
Einstein's great contributions to science 
are his “Principle of Relativity” and his 
theory of particles or “quanta” of light. 
These are fields of knowledge so special- 
ized that most persons consider them too 
' abstruse to understand and too theoretical 
to affect human life. It would be possible 
to tell how these theories have indeed 
aided the advance of oractical physics 
and chemistry, and how they affected the 
outcome of the recent war. But this would 
put the emphasis in the wrong place. 
Einstein is great, not because of any 
effect he may have had on our habits of 
life, but because he has shown us our 
world in truer perspeclive, and has helped 
us to understand a little more clearly 
how we are related to the universe around 
us. 
In 1921 the Nobel Physics Prize was 
given to Albert Einstein “for his discovery 
of the law of the photoelectric effect”. 
This was selected as an aspect of his 
theoretical study that was subject to 
precise test and had been thoroughly 
verified by experiment. It is, however, his 
“Principle of Relativity” that has properly 
brought to Einstein his great fame, 
“The Principle of Relativity” 
OUND about 1900, new properties of 
rapidly moving objects were dis- 
covered that did not fit with the 
long accepted ideas of physics. Typical

deep antipathy to every form of cruelty 
or hatred.” : 
At one time he was elected a member 
of one of the Commissions of the League 
of Nations. Feeling that the League did 
not take a strong enough stand against 
the militarily powerful states, he resigned. 
But he returned, because he decided that 
what is good must 
be supported even 
though it makes 
mistakes. 
It was about 
this time that 
Einstein came to 
Paris, in 1922, at 
the invitation of 
the College de 
France. We in the 
college were still 
afraid that there 
might be demon- 
strations against 
him by nationalist 
fanatics—the very 
men who later in 
1940 collaborated 
with the invaders 
of our country. So 
we even kept his 
address in Paris a 
secret.

Te 
But our peaceful discussions were not 
interrupted, however, violent were the 
polemics outside the college. And though 
peaceful, our discussions did not lack 
liveliness: there were still sceptics who 
thought the new theory self-contradictory, 
and who did not understand that the 
contradiction was only between Relativity 
and their own deep-seated habits of 
thought. I am proud to have taken part 
in these discussions, and there to have 
argued with my dear and illustrious friend 
Painlevé. 
©... Simplicity and Music 
UT 1 also had the pleasure of more 
intimate conversations and closer 
contacts, in which I learned to 
know Einstein in yet another light; the 
youthfulness, the almost disingenuous 
youthfulness of his look, and that great 
simplicity which marked even his deepest 
and most fruitful ideas. 
To this pleasure was added that of a 
common love of music. It was a delight | 
to have that great scientist reveal! him- 
self in my home as a first-class violinist 
with a rare musical gift, and to see the 
pleasure which he took in taking part 
in our musical reunions. 
~ gitude on a globe. 
  
of these properties was that the mass of 
an electron was found to increase greatly 
if it was set in motion at very high speed. 
One special assumption after another had 
been introduced to account for such 
effects, but these special assumptions 
themselves had no justification. 
Then, in 1905, E:nstein suggested that 
the laws of physics as we observe them 
may be in no way dependent upen how 
fast we are mov.ng through space. It is 
only how fast an object is moving relative 
to us that, on his view, can affect the 
way things on this object appear to act. 
The mathematical consequences of this 
simple assumption were found to fit with 
the changes In the properties of objects 
moving at very high speeds. No further 
special hypotheses were needed. 
Accordingly, since Einstein, science hag 
given up the idea of anv framework of 
space, such as a fixed “ether”, relative to 
which we might think of ourselves as 
moving. The only motion that has any 
meaning, according to the “Special Theory 
of Relativity”, is the motion of one object 
relative to another. 
Among the unexpected consequences of 
~ this theory is that the mass of anything 
is proportional to its energy, a result now 
well verified by experiment. It was this 
principle which led Lise Meitner to find 
the enormous energy associated with 
atomic fission. 
A New Concept of Weight 
[| : ARDLY was the scientific world 
becoming accustomed to think in 
terms of this “special” relativity 
when, in 1915, Einstein introduced a 
“general theory of relativity”. This took 
into account not only the speeds, but also . 
the changes in speed, or “accelerations”, 
of objects relative to each other. 
It introduced a 
new concept of 
weight: according 
to Einstein now, 
the weight of 
anything, that is, 
the pull on it by 
gravity, was itself 
nothing but the 
reaction against 
an enforced chan- 
ge of motion. 
This concept 
meant that in the 
neighbourhood of: 
& massive body, 
such as the earth, 
toward which ob- 
jects fall if left to 
themselves, there 
must be a natural 
state of motion 
that is different 
from that at dis- 
tances far away 
from such masses. 
This natural state 
of motion near the earth Einsiein found 
could be described by modifications of 
space and time in its neighbourhcod, 
modifications that correspond roughly to 
the curvature of the “parallels” of lon= 
 
Br. Complon 
The most celebrated consequence of this 
was that tested by the British expedition 
to observe the solar eclipse of 1918: 
namely, the effect of the sun’s attraction 
on a ray of light passing near it. The 
delicate astronomical studies made then 
and since have confirmed these and other 
predictions of Einstein's General Theory. 
This General Theory of Relativity also 
has its remarkable consequences. One of 
these is that there cannot be an endless

LLITERACY can be swept 
out of China. Madame Sun 
Yat-sen's China Welfare Fund 
(C.W.F.) is adding to the proof 
every day, in the slums of 
Shanghai. : 
Thee burden of the proof rests 
on the shoulders of the very 
children who come to the three 
centres the C.W.F. has in strategic 
spots in the city. For these 
youngsters are groomed in the 
principles of the “little teachers” 
system and their success is de- 
monstrating that this is a teach-

be adopted over all of <China.

### 73955: Cleaning up China's illiteracy: the story of the 'Little teacher' system as it works in Shangai

The Story of the ‘Little Teacher’ System As It Works in Shanghai 
began to set up classes in their 
shabby homes, on the streets 
or in any vacant spot in their 
neighbourhood. 
Six Difficulties 
XPERIENCE has shown that 
the “little teachers” meet 
six main difficulties. The 
first is that most people do not

that - this system it really a 
workable one. It can uproot and 
clean out illiteracy. 
" When the China Welfare Fund 
adopted the late Dr. H.C. Tao's 
“little teacher” system, it did so 
with great flexibility. This was 
because the method was origi- 
nally conceived for use in the 
countryside and the C.W.F. cen- 
tres are in the city. The living 
and pace of life are different. 
The necessity for learning is 
sharper. Therefore, the approack 
and even the contents of the 
text-books had to be revised. 
Selection and Training 
INCE the children are the 
most important element in 
this system, their selection 
must be done carefully. A short 
cut to finding and training effec- 
tive “little teachers” is to choose 
the brightest and most suitable 
children available, those who 
want to serve and help their 
neighbours. This works many 
different ways in practice. At 
the first C.W.F. centre in the 
western factory district, for 
instance, such youngsters were in 
evidence at a nearby municipal 
"primary school. In order to 1ni- 
‘tiate this work, the CWF took 
its first “little teachers” from 
this school. 
Those who were doing well in 
- their lessons and who showed 
signs of understanding the idea 
"of rendering service were chosen. 
They were taught teaching 
methods. Since they came from 
‘poor families, the C.WDF. also 
helped them with their tuition 
so they could carry on with their 
education. These youngsters then 
taught the first children register- 
ed in the C.W.F. literacy classes 
who were picked right off the 
‘streets of Shanghai. 
The “little teachers” at the 
second and third centres, how- 
ever, were selected differently and 
now that the whole project has 
gathered momentum, this is the 
pattern of selection which is 
basic policy for the programme. 
The same qualifications of 
brightness in class and will- 
ingness to serve were sought, 
oniy this time within the centre 
literacy classes. These children 
were given teacher's, training 
and put to work among their 
own people. Although their edu- 
cation level was lower, the 
understanding of their pupil's 
living conditions was much better. 
This aided them in getting 
acceptance, especially as they 
understand the 
system. 
Secondly, many parents- fear 
that once their youngsters take 
up “little teacher” work, they 
will neglect their own studies. 
“little teachers” 
This is not the case, however, 
according to C.W.F. records. The 
“teachers” must prepare their own 
very well. They must thorough- 
ly understand every character 
before they can teach it to others. 
As a result, the “little teachers” 
retain their lessons much more 
effectively than ordinary pupils 
in the literacy classes. 
In fact, the children mention- 
ed above in connection with first 
centre have proved themselves 
so proficient in their own 
schooling that the municipal pri- 
mary school wishes to send more 
of their students to the C.W.F. 
centres for this valuable training. 
Thirdly, since all of these 
children come from exceedingiy 
poor homes, they are expected to 
do some of the household chores, 
and their parents are afraid their 
teaching work will prevent them 
from doing this. The C.W.F. must

can sometimes be easily discou- 
raged by severe criticism. C.W.F. 
learned this early in its work, 
therefore “setting a good exam- 
ple” is stressed as the corrective 
to be used by the “little teachers”. 
This takes some time to get 
across to a few of the children, 
especially those who come from 
homes where the cuff and the 
kick are used to “keep kids in 
line”, In such cases, the conduct 
of the adult supervisors is 
extremely important since they 
set the example for their young 
charges. 
Fifth “Trouble-Maker” 
HE fifth trouble-maker for 
1 the C.W.F. literacy pro- 
gramme is lack of space. 
The centres are much too confin- 
ing, therefore the main work is 
being done outside, in the homes 
and alleyways of Shanghai's 
poorest districts. But this pre- 
sents its own problems. 
Most of the hosts and hostesses 
of the home literacy classes are 
the parents of the children who 
  
trances, beside a grave or next 
to the local barber-shop. 
The sixth difficulty the home 
literacy teachers face is how to 
find class time that will please 
everyone at once. They cannot 
hold the class too early because 
usually one or two members of 
the family get up late. They 
cannot hold the class too late 
because so many of the homes do 
not have light. 
class must be held sometime in 
the afternoon, sandwiched in be- 
tween work, study and family 
duties. 
The element of time enters into 
the problem in yet another way. 
It is hard to hold the classes 
punctually. Most families are too 
poor to own a clock. What usually 
happens is that the “little teacher” 
dashes to some nearby place 
where they do have a clock, gets 
the time and hurries back to 
start class. 
Two Little Teachers 
S can be gathered, these 
A “little teachers” are people 
with a great deal of heart. 
A closer view of the lives of two 
of them will prove this more con- 
clusively. 
Chen Lih-tsun, whose family 
originally came from Kwangiung, 
is one of six children. Their main 
support is procuring cigarettes 
for two vendors and Lih-tsun is

teach those very classes. The 
biggest job is to obtain the 
acceptance of the parents to this 
idea. Once this is accomplished, 
time after time, it ha$ been 
witnessed that reluctance turns 
to co-operation, especially when 
the parents begin to take pride 
in their child's new work. What 
usually happens it that the class 
is soon crowding everything else, 
including parents and little 
brothers and sisters, out of the 
house, all with the aid of the 
older folks. 
Five venerable teachers, who usually work side by side with younger 
instructors, discuss mass education methods they are applying 
in China, 
win and hold the confidence of 
the mothers and fathers since 
their recognition of the literacy 
work is important to its success. 
Therefore, the policy followed is - 
to emphasize the need for doing 
the work at home quickly and 
efficiently so freedom can be won 
for the school—both to learn and 
to teach. 
The fourth difficulty is centred 
about the fact that youngsters 
As the word spreads that literacy 
is available for those who are 
willing to help themselves, the 
applicants increase in numbers. 
They constantly overcrowd the 
24 classes held in the centres 
morning, noon and night. More 
and more home literacy classes 
are formed to meet the need and 
at this writing there are 41 in 
session—in kitchens, under mat- 
sheds, on streets, in street en-

winning. 
Because of the shortage of 
cigarettes, ne has fo get up at 
four every morning and squeeze 
into a long queue to buy a few 
packages of this commodity. He 
buzzes around from one line to 
the other, buying as much as he 
can. These he sells at a profit to 
the vendors, who are located near 
a row of bars at the foot of Gar- 
den Bridge. He works for the 
vendors and the bars until 3 
o'clock in the afternoon, when he 
is relieved by an elder brother. 
Then he comes to the CWF 
centre where he teaches. He stays 
until evening, as he is now in the 
junior class and has his own 
studying to do. After this he 
tackles another class of his own 
in his neighbourhood. The centre 
personnel have tried to hold 
young Chen down, for his health 
might be impaired. But he drives 
on, learning as much as he can 
and passing it out as fast as he 
gets it. He is an example to all 
the “little teachers” and to the 
adults as well. 
Another typical CWF youngster 
is Hsu Yung-hai, age 14, a native 
of Kiangsu and the son of a 
pedicab man. He was not in the 
centre literacy class long before 
he caught the fever to be a 
“little teacher”. He was indus- 
trious and studied hard. When 
the first home literacy class was 
set up in a back street lane, it 
seemed only natural that this 
boy should be the teacher. He 
went after his job with great 
earnestness and soon convinced

said Yung-hai taught better than 
an adult. 
Becomes Trouble Shooter 
E became the centre trouble-

joh came up, the adult super-

ember when the CWF was re- 
quested by people living in a 
slun a short distance from the 
centre to set up home literacy 
classes, Yung-hai was called to 
take over the task. He walkad 
into a locale of makeshift matsh- 
ed huts and shacks surrounded 
by stagnant pools of water. It 
would have turned the stomachs 
of most kids not toughened by 
their own hard life. But this

It can be seen that the children 
reached by the China Welfare 
Fund programme live lives mark- 
ed by hard fact. In order to 
teach them to understand, they 
must be taught useful knowledge. 
As a result, most of the text- 
books that can be bought in 
shops are unsuitable for this 
kind of work. They are meant 
for pupils in regular schools, not 
for child labourers, garbage 
pickers, shoe-shine boys, orphans 
and refugee children. ‘These 
youngsters need their lessons 
down to earth and concentrated, 
for they never know when their 
education will be abruptly stopped. 
Text-book Problems 
O meet this situation, the 
CWF adult teachers have 
prepared four text-books to 
cover a two-year period, one book 
covering one semester of work. 
These books are packed with 
practical knowledge, especially 
relating to health and sanitation 
measures. The set of four are 
called “Books for All Ages”, and 
can therefore be used for adult

the less, at present the set of 
four serves to teach the pupils fo 
read and write Chinese, some 
practical arithmetic and simple 
folk songs. In addition, the 
“little teachers” and pupils of 
“ne higher grades in the centre 
classes get lessons on the abacus, 
advanced hygiene and English 
once or twice a week, depending 
upon how advanced they are. 
This programme the China 
Welfare Fund is operating, com- 
plemented by a medical and nu- 
tritional aid project, illustrates 
many important points in social 
welfare work. It demonstrates 
that only the poor really under- 
stand the poor, and can do the 
best work among them; that illi- 
terates best understand the dif- 
ficulties of illiterates; that chil- 
dren in these circunstances 
understand that this is their 
chance to serve their country 
and to cultivate their own 
talents; and that the basic prin- 
ciple underlying all of Mada- 
me Sun Yat-seu’s work, “Help 
the people to help themselves”. 
is without question the hope of 
the future China.

—— 
UNESCO 
  
  Courier Supplemen 
  
rejoice that my first official 
|| journey as Director-General of 
Unesco should be to your country. 
The nearness of our headquarters in 
Paris was not the sole factor which 
guided my choice. To my mind there 
are spiritual considerations which 
outweigh mere geographical proxi- 
mity. The first of these is the in- 
terest which Belgium has always 
shown in the international work of 
intellectual co-operation and which 
has already taken the form of 3 
major contribution to Unesco's ac- 
tivities. 
Even before the 1945 Conference, 
the Belgian Government, established 
throughout the war in London, took 
part with disinterested zeal in the 
meetings of the Allied Ministers of 
~ Education, whose labours were to 
provide an excellent basis for the 
United Nations Educational, Scienti- 
fic and Cultural Organization. At the 
Conference of 1945, where I had the 
honour to represent Mexico, I was 
able to appreciate the full value of 
the assistance given us by the Belgian 
delegation under M. Buisseret and to 
note that intense vitality which, 
despite the sacrifices demanded by 
the war, remains the outstanding 
quality of the Belgian people. Later, 
in Mexico in November 1947, and at 
Beirut in 1948, the delegations chair- 
ed with such distinction by M. Camille 
Huysmans, deeply impressed the Con- 
ferences by the vigour of their con- 
tributions and by ther manifest and 
entirely logical conviction of the 
noble task that is Unesco’s. 
Worth of the Spirit 
the support which Belgium has 
ll ever given to Unesco I would 
add two other factors in explana-~ 
tion of my eagerness to make this 
particular visit, one of them his- 
torical and the other intimate and 
personal. The historical factor is 
this: if there be a people in all 
Europe which may be deemed to 
have reached a degree of maturity 
sufficient to attain Unesco’s goal, it 
is the Belgians. 
Their position on the map has 
made them the predestined victims 
of a succession of war-like adven- 
tures which they endured heroically 
without ever in their turn seeking to 
subject others to their own ambi- 
tions. All Belgium sought was to 
save the honour of its flag. There 
are few countries in the world 
which have proved as thoroughly as 
Belgium the worth of the spirit in 
the face of force or how justice over- 
tops the invader’s lust for domina- 
tion. The shells which more than 
once have torn Belgium's soil could 
not breach the virtues of its people, 
its love of work, its compassion for 
the humble, its concept of impartial- 
ity and honour. That is a noble 
exemple, to which I am glad to do 
reverence, and in itself is a source 
of living hope for Unesco. 
Personal Factor 
mentioned an intimate personal 
factor. It is my full appreciation 
of your ideals and your anx.eties. 
From my earliest years, in the far- 
off country of my birth, beneath a 
sun which every evening gilds the 
- pyramids of Teotihuacan and every 
morning brings back the memory of 
Queltzalcoatl, I have felt drawn 
towards your hard-working and 
poetic land, mystical and practical at 
once, able to enjoy realism even in 
the opulent mythology of a Rubens, 
but able also to escape from it in the 
dreamboat of a Rodenbach along the 
moonlit canals of Bruges. 
In 1937, I came to live among you 
as the diplomatic representative of 
‘the United States of Mexico. On 26 
"November, 1948, the General Confer- 
ence of Unesco, meeting in Beirut, 
did me the honour to appoint me 
Director-General in the place of my 
illustrious friend, Dr. Huxley, and on 
11 December I assumed my present 
office. Since that day I have not

difficulties Unesco has met in its 
course. Some of them are temporary 
and internal, their source a kind of 
growing pains. Two years ago Unesco, 
to all intents and purposes, did not 
exist; today it is a great international 
institution. What wonder then if 
- everything is not yet exactly right 
in a machine put together in such 
haste and in charge of so complex, 
so vast and so diversified a pro- 
gramme? 
Time and Experience 
N face of a new international 
mechanism, our first impression 
resembles what Saint-Exupéry felt 
when he compared an aeroplane of 
Blériot’s time with a modern stream- 
lined aircraft. Disheartened by the 
difficulties of detail and the complica- 
tions of the structure, dazed by the 
innumerable springs, levers and 
brakes, we stand perplexed in front 
of a collection of parts which do 
not yet make up a living whole. Let 
us not despair on that account. There 
is no success which does not follow 
on time and experience. Unesco will 
gradually acquire the organic flexi- 
bility it now lacks,.and, the simpler 
it becomes, the better it will fulfil 
its functions. 
“It appears,” Saint-Exupéry sa.d 
fn speaking of his aircraft, “that the 
whole industrial effort of man, all 
his calculations, all his nightly toil- 
ing over plans had their visible con- 
clusion in sheer simplicity, as though 
it needed the experience of genera- 
tions to arrive little by little at the 
curve of a column, a hull or fuselage 
of a plane, and give to them the 
elemental purity of a breast or 
shoulder. It appears that perfection 
is reached, not when there is nothing 
more to add, but when there is 
nothing more to take away. When 
it is finally completed, the ‘machine 
is hidden”. 
That is how we must go to work 
with the administration of Unesco: 
simplify it as much as is necessary 
in order that the machinery may be 
concealed and the Organization be- 
come humanized as we 
shall. 
a § @ 
Such internal difficulties can and 
will be overcome by the Executive 
Board and backed by the support 
and goodwill of the General Confer- 
ence. There are, however, other dif- 
ficulties inherent not in Unesco as 
a Specialized Agency of the United 
Nations, but in the United Nat.ons 
themselves and, through the United 
Nations, in every government and 
every people. I mean the difficulties 
arising in every country from the 
clash between the imperative of the 
national will and those of a construc-

“The 
    
tive internationalism. This is a dif- 
ficulty which is not peculiar to 
Unesco; the same state of affairs is 
found, in the transitional period 
through which we are passing, at all 
levels of world co-operation. 
HE peoples yearn for collective 
T agreement, but fear that if that 
agreement is arrived at it may not 
take account enough of the legitimate 
interests of each individual commun- 
ity. With their lips they declare that 
no practical international work can 
be accomplished unless States agree 
to a limitation of their sovereignty. 
But each of them asks in his heart: 
“Who will agree to surrender part of 
his sovereign rights? All of us? Then 
how much? Some of us only? Who? 
Only the weak?” 
Economic and political agreements 
alike justify such doubts. Those 
doubts are still more justified in 
if there is any- 
thing which governments are not 
entitled to surrender, it is the cul- 
ture of their peoples. Their culture 
is the very soul which gives them 
life, the secret of their individuality 
as units in civilization. That indivi- 
duality is the fruit of their history, 
fashioned through long centuries by 
tradition and custom, by suffering 
and conquest, and to seek to assail it 
would be to outrage in peace a sanc- 
tuary which the most ambitions ag- 
gressors have seldom dared to violate 
in war. 
Unesco did not come into existence 
to plot that assault. Far otherwise; 
its task is to work towards better 
understanding between the peoples 
by showing each of them all it has 
to gain by knowing and respecting 
foreign cultures, so true is it that 
foreign cultures serve to broaden our 
own concept of life and our own idea 
of civilization. Public opinion must be 
warned against the mistake of think- 
ing Unesco capable of conceiving a 
civilization where unity would result 
automatically from the application 
of uniform rules and purely mechan- 
ical adjustment. 
Intellectual Path to Peace 
HE intellectual path to peace 
mM and human brotherhood does 
not lie through any doctrinaire sim- 
plification of historic cultures. In 
any case such a simplification— 
where each culture would lose its 
special savour—would bring with it 
immeasurable impoverishment. It 
would be rather like the artificial 
language offered to us from time to 
vehicle of 
thought. 
However useful they may be for 
that purpose, they are never mca 
than a collection of bloodless conven- 
tions, and only blind optimism coud 
imagine their ultimately replaciag 
the real languages, whose vocabulary 
has slowly gathered treasure from tire 
lived experience of a people, from the 
joy and grief of its poets and tue 
thought of its philosophers, and 
which have been given their form 
and colour by the innumerable thir zs 
making up daily life, a particular 
kind of daily life, a particular way 
of living, in a word, a unique civiliza- 
tion. 
It would be perilous for univercal 
culture to become a kind of ves 
haberdashery counter, where dilct- 
tantes could choose at will what 
seemed to them rarest, most cur.ous, 
most exotic. And there is anothozr 
kind of unigersalism whose victcry” 
would be no less fatal, one in which 
the impossible came to pass and all 
became interchangeable. There would 
be little profit in that save for the 
slothful minds which had created it 
by selecting everywhere the iteins 
they thought best calculated to sa- 
tisfy the most people most quickly. 
and which would necessarily be the 
crudest and the worst. 
Universalism 
UR Meritage is marvellous in its 
O diversity and we must lose 
none of it. Nevertheless, we must 
make it the possession of the whole 
world or, at the least, make possible 
the interpenetration . of cultures 
rather than rejection or ignorance, 
sometimes even hatred and scorn, 
one of another. The first goal to be 
attained is sympathy, and, after that, 
mutual enrichment; not a collection 
of samples, nor a catalogue, nor an 
amalgam of mediocrities, nor some 
sort of highest common factor. It is 
not, of course, impossible to break 
down the different civilizations into 
their prime factors, but it may be 
neither so easy nor so quick to re- 
build anything strong and viable 
from those prime factors, once am- 
putated from the living and life- 
giving body. 
Unesco’s object in this field is in 
very truth to breathe into each cul- 
ture the spirit of universalism, by 
inspiring it with the desire for un- 
derstanding and exchange; by pre- 
senting to its gaze the peculiar qua- 
lities of other cultures in brotherly 
emulation, to lead it to awareness of 
its own, and to an effort to pro- 
claim and to perfect those special 
qualities, avoiding both aggressive 
r.valry with others and the sacrifice 
of its own values to an idol made by 
many hands. 
Classics and Cultures

UNESCO COURIER SUPPLEMENT March 1949 
 
the similarity of their ultimate ob- 
jective impels them at“ least as 
strongly to come together. 
Lquilibrium Between Symbols 
N wartime everything becomes the 
¥ symbol of conflict, right down to 
the best-known characters of a na- 
tio1’s classics. Yet not all the symbols 
fie1t for the regime in power in 
their motherlands. An example I 
have in mind is how in the last war 
the first bars of the Fifth Symphony 
achuired the status of the anthem 
of democracy. Beethoven against 
Hitler! 
Can the sight of such protagonists 
Tali to teach us faith in the incorrup- 
tib'e power of culture ? Above—and 
below—the governments there are 
two forces whose conjunction is ever 
possible: they are, firstly, the peoples 
themselves and, secondly, the heroes 
in whom the peoples see the In- 
caination of their race. 
‘Thus it was that Paul Valéry's 
luc'd genius led him to say that peace 
js primarily a state of equilibrium 
be ween symbols. It ig the reason, 
too. why, at the war's end, the United 
Nations resolved to set up an 
organization “for the purpose of ad- 
vancing, through the educational 
and scientific and cultural relations 
of the peoples of the world, the ob- 
jectives of international peace and of 
the common welfare of mankind...” 
It is interesting to read again the 
preamble to the Constitution signed 
in London on 16 November, 1945. This 
preamble says, among other things: 
That ignorance of eagh other's 
ways and lives has been a com- 
mon cause, throughout the his- 
tory of mankind, of that suspi- 
cion and mistrust between Lhe 
peoples of the world through which 
their differences have all too often 
broken into war; 
That a peace based exclusively 
upon the political and economic 
arrangements of governments 
vould not be a peace which could 
secure the unanimous, lasting and 
sincere support of the peoples of 
the world, and that the peace must 
therefore be founded upon the in- 
tellectudl and moral solidarity of 
mankind; 
That the wide diffusion of cul- 
fure, and the education of human- 
ity for justice and liberty and 
peace are indispensable to the 
dignity of man and constilute a 
sacred duty which all the nations 
must fulfil in a sprit of mutual 
assistance and concern. 
For these reason—the text goes 
on—the States parties to this 
Constitution, believing in full and 
equal opportunities jor education 
for all, an unrestricted pursuit of 
objective truth, and in the free 
exchange of ideas and knowledge, 
are agreed and determined io 
develop and increase the means of 
communication between their 
peoples and to employ these means 
for the purposes of mutual under- 
standing and a ilruer and more 
perfect knowledge of each other's 
lives. 
Unesco’s Achievements 
WRT then, has Unesco done 
to translate so rich a pro- 
gramme into acts? I will try to tell 
you br.efly. 
In the field of Reconstruction, 
Unesco has first sought to establish 
the educational, scientific and cul- 
tural needs of the war-devastated 
countries. The Secretariat keeps im- 
portant information on this subject 
regularly up to date and disseminates 
it through various publications, such 
as the monthly “Bulletin of Recons- 
truction”, which appears in English, 
French and Spanish, and the “Book 
of Needs”, of which two volumes 
have been issued. Illustrated booklets 
have been published on special sub- 
jects, for example “Universities in 
Need”, and “Suggestions for Science 
‘Teachers in War-Devastated Coun- 
tries”. The last in particular has prov- 
ed extremely valuable even in coun- 
tries not devastated by the war, but 
where public educatior still possesses 
only rudimentary equipment. It is at 
the request of those countries that 
we are now undertaking to issue 
Spanish, Chinese and Arabic editions 
of this pamphlet. Other pamphlets 
are being prepared on devastated 
libraries, laboratories and art gal- 
leries. A documentary film has been 
made on university reconstruction, 
and a very moving exhibition of 
photographs of children in Europe 
has just been sent to America. 
N the basis of all this informa- 
(D tion Unesco has helped to 
launch and co-ordinate nation- 
al and international campaigns to 
collect the money for meeting such 
enormous needs. It has promoted the 
establishment of, and furnished the 
Secretariat for the Temporary Inter- 
national Council for Educational Re- 
construction, which groups together 
the chief private organizations con- 
cerned in this b.g task. 
We owe thanks to Belgium for 
having found 10 0.0 of the funds 
placed at our disposal, as the result 
of the campaign by the Belgian Com- 
mittee of U.N.A.C. 
From its own budget Unesco finds 
the means of providing emergency 
aid: in 1948 $395,006 and in 1949 
$175,000 were devoted to the purchase 
of teaching equipment. This year a 
special effort will be made on be- 
half of the 200,000 children among 
the 800,000 refugees from the Middle 
East. | 
However, the problem cannot be 
solved simply by sending material, 
however necessary. The havoc 
wrought by the war in people’s minds, 
and especially in children’s minds, is 
even more serious than the material 
destruction. The problem of the re- 
education of child victims of the war 
is one of those to which Unesco in- 
tends to devote closest concern. 
In the first place we have to res- 
tore to these children and young 
people, whose minds are obsessed by 
so much violence and poisoned by 
so much hatred, the desire to re- 
construct and to share the experience 
of human brotherhood. In 1947 
Unesco sponsored four international 
volunteer work camps in Belgium, 
France, Czechoslovakia and Poland. 
In 1948, it called a conference of or- 
ganizations interested in the work 
of these camps, to co-ordinate and 
back up what they were doing. Books 
were collected and distributed among 
thirty work camps. In 1943 more than 
50,000 volunteers furnished 3,000,000 
hours of work in 135 camps. 
Further, Unesco sponsored in 1948 
a conference of Directors of Chil- 
dren’s Villages, which met at Trogen 
in Switzerland and ended in the 
establishment of a special Federation 
for the development of this undertak- 
ing. The vice-president of the Fe- 
deration’s governing body is a coun- 
tryman of yours, M. de Cooman. 
OME other countries escaped de- 
iF vastation by the war, but have 
for centuries been denied their birth- 
right or otherwise victimized by the 
facts of History. It is to those coun- 
tr.es that we are applying our pro- 
gramme of Fundamental Education. 
In the valley of Marbial, in Haiti, a 
pilot project is now being carried out 
in co-operation with other Specializ- 
ed Agencies of the United Nations, 
like the Food and Agriculture Organ- 
jzation and the World Health Or- 
ganization. Begun last year, this ex- 
periment quickly stirred the en- 
thusiasm of the local inhabitants, it 
is in full swing and has already fur- 
nished valuable lessons. 
That is only one example and, in 
this and in all the other fields Unes- 
co’s activity is not confined to under- 
takings for which it assumes direct 
responsibility. It has made it its 
business to stimulate, aid and ad- 
vise a whole series of experiments 
and kindred projects organized by 
others, if it is only by ensuring the 
exchange of information and special- 
ized knowledge. 
In countries where education is 
well developed, practical study 
courses, also known as seminars, 
have proved an excellent method of 
joint comparison and research. The 
first course was held at Sévres, out- 
side Paris, in 1947. Its subject was 
the examination of studies best 
adapted for developing international 
understanding, and its success en- 
couraged Unesco to repeat and ex- 
tend the experiment. 
Last year four seminars were ar- 
ranged simultaneously at Ashridge 
(England), on the training of teach- 
ers, at Adelphi College (United States) 
on teaching about the United Nations 
at Caracas (Venezuela) on certain 
educational problems peculiar to 
Latin America, and at Podebrady 
(Czechoslovakia), For this year two 
such courses are heing prepared, one 
will be at New Delhi and will be 
devoted to adult education in rural 
areas, the other in Brazil where the 
subject will be the campaign against 
illiteracy. These international courses 
are not only useful for the perfecting 
of educational methods, but also 
constitute highly encouraging ex- 
periments in international under- 
standing. 
Educational Missions 
NOTHER technique characteriz- 
\ ing Unesco’s educational work 
is that of educational missions. Up 
to now we had not been able to make 
a start, but I am glad to tell you 
that this year four countries have 
already asked for our help. The first 
mission has begun its work in the 
Philippines where, under the direc- 
tion of an American expert it is res- 
ponsible for the study of primary 
and secondary education. The second 
mission, headed by an Englishman, 
has just arrived in Bangkok. It is io 
advise the Siamese Government in its® 
campaign against illiteracy. The 
other twe missions are now being 
fitted up and will proceed, one to 
Afghanistan and the other to Syria. 
All these missions are sent at the 
request of the countries concerned, 
which share the expenses with Unes- 
co. They are made up of experts 
chosen by Unesco from the most 
highly qualified specialists in that 
field in wh.ch they are asked by the 
inviting governments for their ad- 
vice. Here again international soli- 
darity marches side by side with 
social advancement, 
Certain other achievements or 
projects now in the course of plan- 
ning I must pass over rapidly, in- 
teresting though many of them are. 
Thus I can only mention in passing 
the establishment of an interna- 
tional Universities Office, set up as 
a result of the Congress summoned 
by Unesco last year at Utrecht in 
conjunction with the government 
of the Netherlands and which was at- 
tended by two hundred universities 
from thirty-two countries. Nor can I 
do more than name the forthcom- 
ing Conference on Adult Education, 
which Unesec is arranging in co- 
operation with the Danish Govern- 
ment to meet in June at Copenhagen. 
Better Textbooks 
MUST, however, dwell for one 
i moment on a project particularly 
close to my heart. That is the im- 
provement of school textbooks, and 
when I say improvement I am speak- 
ing of a juster presentation of hu- 
manity’s profound solidarity, both in 
time and space. 
This is a task which has been long 
under contemplation but has been 
constantly postponed; the present 
state of the world. however, gives it 
an urgency to which we can no longer 
close our eyes. That is especially true 
of history and and geography text- 
books, whose authors too often 
emphasize the differences between 
men far more than their points of 
resemblance; the grandeur of their 
common destiny is wantonly distorted 
by the weight attached to their con- 
flicts. 
Let me not be misunderstood. We 
are not trying to establish, still less 
to impose, uniform textbooks for all 
the world. We acknowledge and res- 
pect the diversity of national condi- 
tions and traditions. All we want to 
do is to stimulate and help the res- 
ponsible authorities in each country 
to undertake on their own account a 
revision of school books in the diree- 
tion of that international understand- 
ing I have just defined. For this 
purpose the Secretariat, after very 
careful work, is now completing the 
formulation of objective criteria and 
general advice, from which, we be- 
lieve, all may benefit. It is, in the 
last resort, for each to undertake his 
own reform. 
Field Science Offices 
N the field of the Natural Sciences 
Unesco has already accomplished 
a remarkable task of international 
organization. 
Since 1947 it has established four 
regional offices for international 
co-operation—at Cairo, Shanghai, 
Delhi and Montevideo—in order to 
create closer contacts between scien- 
tists and scholars who sometimes work 
far from their main centres of re- 
search. The functions of these offices 
vary with the conditions in each 
region: contacts with government 
services, scientific societies and insti- 
tutions and individual scientists; 
technical advice, co-ordination of 
research work and the mutual com- 
munication of results obtained, in-~ 
formation about documentation and 
scientific equipment; census of needs 
and the search for the means of 
satisfying them, exchanges of informs- 
ation and surveys, etc. Now with- 
drawn to Shanghai, the East Asia 
Office is completing the scheme of 
scientific and industrial equipment 
left behind by U.N.R.R.A.; it is dis- 
tributing laboratory material among 
Chinese institutes. In Southern Asia 
the Delhi Office is studying the pos- 
sibilities of manufacturing rubber and 
penicillin, not for commercial but for 
scientific and social purposes. The 
Cairo Office has been equally pro- 
ductive in the fields of both pure and 
applied science. 
The Montevideo Office has spent 
most of its time on the setting up 
of the International Institute of the 
Hylean Amazon and its Constitution, 
which was signed by the founder 
states at the Iquitos Conference held 
last August under Unesco’s auspices, 
is now in course of ratification. This 
damp and marshy tropical forest, 
rich in raw materials, oilfields, hevea, 
medicinal and nutritional plants and 
broken up by big rivers, extends over 
more than 5,000 kilometres in length 
and covers more than 7,000,000 square 
kilometres between the Andes and the 
Atlantic. 
While respecting the customs of the 
natives, who are struggling for sur- 
vival in these deadly areas, the Ins- 
titute’s aim is to open up these in- 
comparable reserves to the work of 
man. There is a host of problems to 
be faced, ethnological® and sociolo- 
gical, zoological, botanical and clima- 
tological, health problems, agrieultu- 
ral and hydrobiological problems, not 
to mention the political difficulties 
in the way of essential international 
co-operation. Through the Institute 
and helped by the enthusiastic aid of 
several countries and specialized 
organizations, Unesco’s business is to 
solve these problems. Upon the suc- 
cess of its efforts depend in great 
measure the opening up and the ra- 
tional development of a vast stretch 
of territory. : 
Conservation of Natural Resources 
N a similar connexion I must 
| | refer to the efforts of Unesco 
towards the protection of nature and 
the conservation of natural resources. 
Last year’s conference at Fontaine- 
bleau led to the establishment of an 
International Union for the Protec- 
tion of Nature, to which our help is 
promised. At present we are actively 
engaged, in conjunction with the 
EC.0.8.0.C, In preparing for a very 
important conference to be held next 
August on the conservation of natu- 
ral resources, this being one of the 
most burning and also most diffienit 
problems of our time. Lastly, I must 
not fail to mention the Congress 
which, thanks to the hospitality of 
the Belgjan Government, will meet 
in April in your capital and which, 
jointly organized by Unesco and the 
World Health Organization, aims at 
preparing for the establishment of a 
permanent Council for the co-ordina- 
tion of international congresses of 
the medical sciences. If there is one 
field in which humanity should 
affirm its solidarity, it is surely in 
the campaign against disease. 
Social Sciences 
Visi regard to the Social 
W Sciences, we have experienced 
much dificuity in framing a pro- 
gramme and putting it into execution. 
Besides, the problems here are more 
complex, the methods less approved 
and the collaboration of specialists is

UNESCO COURIER SUPPLEMENT C 
 
March 1949 
of more recent date. Nevertheless, 
here also our work is beginning to 
bear fruit. 
Economists, sociologists and special- 
jsts in political science and compa- 
rative law, invited from the different 
countries, are organizing themselves 
in response to our appeal and with 
our aid. The Secretariat in its turn, 
helped by many outside consultants, 
is undertaking various surveys which 
before the year is out, will result in 
publications of a quality which I 
hope will do us credit. 
Among these studies I will mention 
two on the state and the method- 
ology of the political sciences; a vol- 
ume on “Aggressive Nationalism” 
(with chapters written by eight 
savants representing five countries); 
a series of monographs on the “Way 
of Life” (from eight countries), on 
the ideas which people of one coun- 
try hold concerning their own and 
other nations (in nine countries),-and 
finally on the methods for changing 
the mental attitudes of communities 
in their relations with one another. 
All these very concrete studies will go 
beyond purely scientific investiga- 
tion; they wil aim at developing a 
rational understanding of human 
groups such as may lead to better 
inspired work in the cause of closer 
international understanding, toler- 
ance and peace. 
Translation of Classics 
N the kindred field of philosophy 
[| and associated sciences, interna- 
tional organization is still farther 
advanced. Last month, on Unesco's 
initiative, an international council of 
philosophy and humanistic sciences 
was set up, That success I am glad 
to be able to associate with the name 
of this city, which has once again 
manifested its concern for enterprises 
serving the cause of international 
co-operation. 
In the field of the Arts, the Inter- 
national Theatre Institute, a creation 
of Unesco, began its life on 1 January 
of this year with a detailed pro- 
gramme of work. 
A great deal of work is being done. 
as regards translations. A list of 
translations and translators has been 
methodically prepared and put at the 
disposal of Member States, and 
Unesco also has in hand a programme 
of translations on its own account. 
These are translations of the clas- 
sics and of important classical works 
which, whilst being truly representa- 
tive of the culture from which they 
originate have also, by reason of their 
value and wide appeal, attained uni- 
versal interest. These books must be 
made accessible to all men in all lan- 
guages, for they are a common treas- 
ury of culture and spiritual libera- 
tion. Unesco has initiated a two-fold 
programme which will be spread over 
several years, beginning in 1949, 
One part of this programme, which 
cagicerns the Arab world, will include 
the translation into Arabic of world 
classics and the translation of Arabic 
classies into several well known lan- 
guages. The other part is more parti- 
cularly concerned with the transla- 
tion into English and French of the 
most important works of Latin Amer- 
ican literature. Both will provide 
plenty of material for fruitful intel- 
lectual relations. 
+ The same may be said with regard 
to the visual arts and music, thanks 
to the collections of reproductions 
and recordings for which Unesco is 
organizing dissemination and ex- 
changes on a large scale. 
In the field of museums, where we 
work in close collaboration with the 
International Council of Museums, 
Unesco has made a notable contri- 
bution in the publication of a quarter- 
ly review entitled “Museum”, «f 
which the second number has just 
been issued. 
In this connexion the programme 
adopted at Beirut includes an imper- 
tant resolution regarding measures 
to be taken for ensuring the preserva- 
tion, and possibly the restoration, of 
historical sites and monuments. This 
seems to me to be a duty which is 
incumbent upon all civilized nations 
—a duty involving both respect for 
the past, to which we owe all that 
we are, and the education of future 
generations to whom we must pass 
on the precious heritage of civiliza- 
tion, of which we are the trustees. 
Books and Libraries 
UR Organization has from the 
0 beginning taken a particular 
interest in libraries. For nearly two 
years the Libraries Division has 
published each month a Bulletin for 
Libraries which is sent free of charge 
to 6,500 libraries. This Bulletin has 
been most useful in connexion with 
the re-establishment of contacts in- 
terrupted by the war. A very success- 
ful Summer School for Librarians was 
organized last year in Manchester 
and London. Twenty countries were 
represented. 
The most interesting of the projects 
that should be mentioned is, however, 
the institution of an international 
Book Coupons Scheme, which enables 
buyers in “soft currency” countries to 
pay in their own currency for orders 
placed with booksellers in “hard cur- 
rency”’ countries, through the inter- 
mediary of Unesco acting as a clear- 
ing house thanks to its own resources. 
The scheme began to work on an 
experimental basis at the beginning 
of December; it concerns thirtesn 
countries and has a ceiling of $150,- 
000, of which $50,000 have been re- 
mitted in the form of coupons to ten 
countries. Its success was immediate 
and striking. France's share, for 
example, was absorbed at once. In 
Czechoslovakia, the distribution of 
coupons gave rise to official demon- 
strations, The effect was the same 
in the United States of America; 
numerous orders for foreign books 
were piaced at once. 
As regards copyright—in which 
Belgium has always taken an active 
interest—a methodical enquiry has 
been carried out during the last two 
years. A great many documents have 
been collected. We have just pub- 
lished the second number of an In- 
formation Bulletin which will form a 
link between specialists on this sub- 
ject and the numerous professional 
associations concerned. Once the 
work of collecting documents and 
making contacts is finished, we shall 
have arrived at the stage when the 
question of a Universal Convention on 
Copyright should be considered—and 
it will be considered. 
The Department of Exchange of 
Persons published last month an 
International Handbook of Fellow- 
ships, which concerns twenty coun- 
tries and in which more than 10,000 
fellowships and other facilities for 
studies abroad are listed. Unesco now 
has its own programme of fellow- 
ships, however, paid for either by our 
Budget or by endowments whose 
administration is entrusted to us. The 
number of fellowships for which 
Unesco is directly responsible is now 
220. They were at first reserved for 
war-devastated countries but will be 
extended this year to economically 
backward countries and trustee terri- 
tories. 
UT our greatest efforts must be 
devoted to mass communication 
-— by press, radio and films—if we are 
to fulfil our task of promoting inter- 
national understanding and better 
social conditions. 
Work in this domain was begun by 
a far-reaching enquiry into the tech- 
nical needs of the press, radio and 
cinema, This enquiry was carried out 
in 1947 in twelve war-devastated 
countries of Europe and the Far East 
and has since been steadily extended 
to other parts of the world. Seventeen 
countries in Europe, Asia and Amer- 
jca were covered in 1948, Fifteen 
others will be covered this year, in- 
cluding some in Africa. The results 
of this enquiry have been published 
in two volumes which constitute a 
mine of informatign such as has 
rarely been collected hitherto. 
On the basis of this information, a 
Committee of Experts which mects 
annually has recommended a series of 
measures designed to remedy the lack 
both of equipment and of trained 
personnel which appears to be gen- 
eral, It must be admitted that our 
efforts have not so far produced any 
tangible results. 
An Organization like ours is in 
fact somewhat poorly equipped for 
overcoming the economic, financial, 
and even political, obstacles with 
which this problem bristles. But we 
do not despair of making ourselves 
heard, once it has been realized by 
the professionals and by public opin- 
ion that our cause is also theirs. 
This is the spirit in which we are 
now busily preparing a series of 
pamphlets on special subjects, special 
that is as regards their technical 
terms, but of very wide range, such as 
the professional training of journal- 
ists, the production and distribution 
of newsprint, the use of radio in edu- 
cation and the manufacture of cheap 
receiving sets and cinema projectors. 
And this is the spirit in which Unesco 
is preparing to take part in the Con- 
ference on Wood and Wood Products 
convened by the Food and Agricul- 
ture Organization next April in Mont- 
real, at which we intend to put for- 
ward the extremely important ques- 
tion of the production and distribu- 
tion of paper. 
Press, Radio and Film 
S regards the free flow of infor- 
A mation, the Conference at 
Beirut adopted the text of a Conven- 
tion whereby visual and auditory 
material (gramophone records and 
films) of an educational, scientific or 
cultural nature may henceforth be 
imported free of customs duty. This 
js the first international agreement 
to be drawn up by Unesco. Other 
agreements are already under con- 
sideration, for it seems to me that 
an inter-governmental Organization 
like ours possesses here a legal tool 
which has perhaps. not been suffi- 
ciently used in the past. We are 
engaged, in particular, on a draft 
convention concerning the duty-free 
importation of books, newspapers and 
periodicals, which has been drawn up 
by a Belgian expert and is sure of a 
welcome in this stronghold of free 
exchange. 
Finally, a special service has been 
set up to ensure a fuller use of the 
immense informative and persuasive 
possibilities of the press, radio and 
cinema for the promotion of the 
ideals which Unesco was created to 
serve. After a long, hard preparatory 
period, this service has at last 
reached the productive stage. A week- 
ly bulletin of information suitable for 
broadcasting on educational, scien- 
tific and cultural events and topics— 
the most important events and topics 
of mankind's real mission, and yet 
the least known, the least appreciated 
—-has recently been published. It is 
sent free of charge to some hundreds 
of broadcasting stations throughout 
the world and we hope that a good 
deal of its contents wiil be dissemin- 
ated. I should like to mention that 
this bulletin is the result of recom- 
mendations made to Unesco by 
broadcasting directors from seven- 
teey countries who met in Paris, in 
October 1948, under the chairmanship 
of M. Fleischmann. 
We mean to concentrate this year 
on two main subjects: 
1. Food and People; 
2. Human Rights. 
I have already touched on the first 
of these subjects in connexion with 
the conservation of natural resources. 
The second sums up, justifies and 
-econditions all the rest. 
Human Rights 
N 10 December 1948, the General 
'D) Assembly of the United Nations 
approved, in Paris, the Universal De-~ 
claration of Human Rights. Unesco 
was bound to welcome with enthu- 
siasm a document of such scope. Tha 
General Conference af Beirut ins- 
tructed me, by acclamation, to stimu- 
late the dissemination of information 
about this declaration and to advoe- 
cate its inclusion in the teaching 
regarding the United Nations given 
in schools. 
In accordance with this decision, I 
suggested to the governments of 
Member States and the National 
Commissions that, in order to impress 
on the minds and hearts of young 
people the memory of the historic 
moment when the value of the 
human person was universally pro- 
claimed, the 10th December should be 
observed each year in all school as a 
day of recognition of the principles of 
the liberty and dignity of Man, 
I added, in particular, in my com- 
munication that the world was long- 
ing for an era of peace which would 
enable every man to develop his 
creative powers to the full for the 
benefit of all and in the cause of 
progress. Peace and justice require, 
indeed, above all things the streng- 
thening of that intellectual and 
moral solidarity without which, as 
Unesco’s Constitution states, the eco- 
ncemic and political arrangements of 
governments would not secure the 
unanimous, lasting and sincere sup- 
port of the peoples of the world. One 
thing is needful if this solidarity is 
to spring from a real harmony of 
minds and not from a passive inter- 
dependence of wishes: respect for the 
human being in his essential integ- 
rity and h:y multiple diversity. 
Unesco therefore finds support and 
encouragement in the Universal De- 
claration of Human Rights. The 
recognition of the principles affirmed 
in the Declaration and the dissemi- 
nation of those principles through 
teaching will help to strengthen the 
faith of every human being in the 
dignity of his existence and to foster 
the fraternal impulse which bids him 
join with all his fellows to save by 
united action the heritage of civiliza- 
tion. : 
I have given a rough outline of 
Unesco’s task. It will be difficult, no 
doubt, for obstacles arise in our path 
at every step. But if we succeed, our 
success, important enough in itself, 
will also be a pledge of the sucecass 
of the entire international system 
which originated in the Charter of 
San Francisco. 
Fellowship Between Nations 
HEN we met in London, in 1945, 
WwW to establish Unesco, I ex- 
plained what I thought was the most 
burning problem of our time: how to 
raise the standard of the masses 
without lowering the dignity of the 
individual, May I recall the words I 
used on that occasion? Never have 
we been so deeply indebted to the 
ordinary people, whose mute heroism 
has once again been the means of 
saving the human race; and never 
have the ordinary people been so in- 
debted to their leaders. Without the 
General Staffs of engineering and 
science, how could they have secured 
the triumph of their ideal? This two- 
fold debt now owed by the world 
(both to the general public and to the 
men who forged the very instruments 
of victory) lays upon us the duty of 
trying to construct some form of so- 
ciety in which the masses will not 
be neglected in favour of exceptional 
figures which may arise, any more 
than individuality will be smothered 
by the progress of the masses. The 
only solution is perhaps to reconcile 
these rival claims, keeping in mind 
the need to replace the conflict be- 
tween the Rights of the individual 
and the Rights of the community by 
a social structure in which the best 
citizen is also the most complete man, 
I see that I have given there a defi- 
nition of the ultimate aim of Unesco 
That aim is to promote, through edu-~ 
cation, science and culture, such 
fellowship between the nations of the 
world that each country will give its 
highest esteem to those of its sons 
who best serve the cause of humanity. 
Today, when the Belgian Commis- 
sion for Co-operation with Unesco has 
honoured me by its welcome, what 
else could I wish for than to see all 
its members working, each in his own 
sphere, to hasten the advent of that 
new man, the perfect citizen of his 
own country and perfect citizen of 
the world? 
Belgium has always advocated 
peaceful settlement in times of strife. 
This country, so heroic in its resis- 
tance, has nevertheless always been 
prompt to lend its voice to counsels 
of wisdom and persuasion. Unesco 
therefore has every reason to expect 
from it most valuable assistance. Your 
help will encourage us {o persevere, 
In conclusion, I would like to quote 
the noble words of one of your great 
poets who said, forty years ago: 
“If, in the evening, you climb a 
mountain, you see the trees, houses, 
village church, meadows, orchards, 
the highroad, even the river, getting 
smailer and smaller until at last they 
are swallowed up in the encroaching 
shades of the valley. But the tiny 
points of light which twinkle in the 
blackest night, wherever there are 
human habitations, do not grow 
dimmer as you climb. With every step 
that brings you nearer to the summit, 
you discern more and more lights in 
the villages sleeping below. So it is 
with our spiritual lights when we look 
at life from a higher plane.” 
In our day, so full of encroaching 
shadows, we have come to realize 
how precious are those spiritual 
lights. Let us see to it that they are 
kept burning: this is our most im- 
perative task.

UNESCO COURIER SUPPLEMENT March 1949 
 
Torres Bodet’s Sorbonne Address 
  
We publish below the full text 
of the address delivered on 
February 24, 1949, by Dr. Jaime 
Torres Bodet, in the large 
amphitheatre of the Sorbonne 
on the occasion of the solemn 
consecration of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, 
in the presence of the President 
of the French Republic, M. Vin- 
cent Auriol, M, Yvon Delbos, 
French Minister of National 
Education, M. Paul - Boncour, 
former Prime Minister, and M. 
René Cassin, Vice-President of 
the Conseil d’Etat. 
M 
¢asion. 
Within the walls of the University 
of Paris, the League of the Rights of 
Man and of tie Citizen today pays 
tribute to what the United Nations 
have achieved in their determination 
to frame a Universal Deaclaraion of 
Human Rights. Unesco wholeheart- 
    
AY I begin by saying how 
proud I feel to be here 
among you on such an oc- 
edly joins them in that tribute. The 
day when our Beirut Conference 
learned that the United Nations As- 
sembly had adopted this Declaration - 
the delegates with one voice express- 
ed their w'sh that Unesco should 
bend its efforts towards publicizing 
among all classes of society a docu- 
ment which holds out such bright 
hopes for humanity. On 29 December 
I called upon the Member States of 
the Organ.zation, to participate in 
this work of dissemination, Of all 
the answers to my appeal, today's 
demonstration is one of the most 
significant. In saying that, I am 
thinking of the enhanced value 
which attaches to the voice of France 
by v.rtue of its history, a history that 
has been wholly devoted to the ser- 
vice of a civilization in which man 
shall be able to express himself both 
individually and collectively. 
Nothing in your country claims to 
lie outside the domain of man, neither 
the beauty of your monuments, nor 
the ordering of your institutions, nor 
the clarity of the most famous among 
your written works. It would be dif- 
ficult to offer mankind a bedy of 
contributions to humanity better cal- 
culated than the sum of yours to 
meet the call for freedom and inte- 
grity. 
Other cultures have attained in 
philosophy, in the arts and in litera- 
ture, heights which command our ad- 
miration. But in that mental atmo- 
sphere, lucid yet not frigid and ima- 
ginative without being Utopian, which 
is the climate of France, there is 
never the feeling that other cultures 
are fore.gn. The realization is ever 
present that there can be no health- 
ier or more solid foundation for the 
peace of the world than agreement 
among men in the spirit of justice 
and truth. In that spirit of justice 
and truth I recognize alike the most 
enduring aspect of your striv.ngs 
and Unesco’s essential goal. 
Rights and Duties 
mT HE League of the Rights of Man 
and of the Citizen has always 
been an active force in assuring the 
triumph of that spirit. Its vigilance 
has never relaxed; it has never lack- 
ed courage or resolution in denounc- 
ing injustice and demanding redress 
for the innocent. 
The Universal Declaration of the 
Rights of Man has focussed your 
labours and our own efforts in their 
true perspective, which is the wish 
for universal progress. I do not claim 
to pass judgment on this Declara- 
tion in its details. I am not unaware 
of the reservations and even the cri- 
ticisms that have been made about 
it. Moreover, every right connotes a 
corresponding duty. Perhaps, from 
this standpoint, not enough import- 
ance has been attached to the sug- 
gestion made by Mahatma Gandhi 
on 5 May, 1947, to my predecessor: 
“I learned from my illiterate but 
very wise mother”, wrote the apostle 
of non-violence, “that the rights 
worth preserving are those which re- 
sult from duty done. Thus the very 
right to live only becomes ours when 
we fulfil our duty as citizens of the 
world”, 
Two Decisive Questions 
ERE I wish only to put two 
IH questions, but they are decisive 
ones, and ones which each of us no 
doubt asks himself, The first is this: 
What will be the practical value of 
a. Declaration which makes no pro- 
vision for legal sanctions? Would it 
not have been better to bind the 
signatory States by a Convention 
which would have had the force of 
a contract? And the other is this: 
What interpretation will each people 
put on the Declaration—What mean- 
ing will be given in each country to 
such general concepts as freedom of 
expression and information? 
Do we not run the risk of seeing 
the political security of the State in- 
voked to justify curtailment of that 
freedom? Worse still, have we not 
cause to fear lest certain men, within 
a political party or government ad- 
ministration may take it on them- 
selves to dec!de of their own author- 
ity where the political security of the 
State begins and ends ? And, at the 
opposite pole, do we not also run 
the risk of seeing the masses of the 
people acknowledge that freedom of 
expression and information is effec- 
tively secured in a society in which 
news, even though it escapes govern- 
ment censorship, rema.ns the raw 
material of an industry and trade 
which are often subordinated to the 
interests of what are in fact mono- 
polies? 
These few remarks are by no means 
intended to detract from the im- 
portance of the Declaration, but 
rather to make it clear how closely 
Unesco’s very future is bound up 
with its applicaticn. In the absence 
of a certain unity in the conceptions 
which the various peoples form of the 
principles of culture, the practical 
results of any international declara- 
tion can at best be only uncertain 
and precar.ous. That is why, at the 
moment, I am not unduly perturbed 
by some of its shortcomings. 
In the present state of the world, 
a more coherent and ambitious mani- 
festo would have been no more than 
a hypothetical forecast without any 
grip on reality. The very thought of 
reinforcing the Declaration by a list 
of penalties or of giving it the legal 
character of a convention is a for- 
cible reminder to us of the use which 
the more favoured countries could 
make of the decree of an interna- 
tional tribunal, always ready to sum- 
mon before it States which are eco- 
nomically and militarity weak, but 
usually much less ready to put strong- 
er States in the dock. 
A Proclamation of Honour 
HE Universal Declaration of the 
1 | Rights of Man is, in my cpinion, 
the richest in promise of all the in- 
ternational texts to which the govern- 
ments have subscribed since 1945 in 
order to give life to the San Fran- 
cisco Charter and to create a firm 
bond between that Charter and the 
Constitution of Unesco. It is the first 
international manifesto which lists 
the rights of the individual and 
clearly states the conditions which 
all States claiming to respect the 
freedom and dignity of the human 
personality are required to observe. 
It is a proclamation of man’s honour. 
It comes at the right time to a world 
where in all spheres collective forces 
are uniting to destroy the human 
being, whether with the object of 
propagating the creed of a regime or 
of preserving a state of society favour- 
able to the mmnorities possessing 
power and wealth. It is an urgent 
appeal to remind governments that 
man exists, that he is not an auto- 
maton at the beck of systems of 
political or financial domination. and 
that he must be considered as an 
end and not as a means, as the one 
end which interests each of us to the 
same degree. 
Such an alarm call brings us a 
message from all our brothers, white 
and black, Asiatic and Indian, learn- 
ed and ignorant, rich and poor. 1t 
must resound in all such precincts 
as these, which have been built to 
house intelligence, to safeguard man's 
creative power, his frail destiny as 
a “thinking reed”, free and respon- 
sible. . 
The Seed of Progress 
T is not by chance that the Uni- 
[| versity of Paris placed at the 
disposal of the League of the Rights 
of Man the famous building from 
which she dispenses education so 
conducive to strengthening the work 
of Unesco. We, too, feel in a measure 
the beneficiaries of its activity, se- 
cure in the knowledge that we also 
are pledged to the course which will 
help to shed light in that most vul- 
nerable, and for that reason often 
most inaccessible of citadels, the 
heart of man. 
But let us be quite clear. Man's 
assent to what is best in men—their 
capacity for compassion and under- 
standing—unfortunately does not 
depend solely on intelligence. That 
assent is innate in Man and is, as 
it were, the seed of his progress. If it 
is true that science and culture form 
the most favourable climate for the 
growth of this seed, it must not be 
forgotten that science and culture 
are, by nature and vocation, instru- 
ments of peace. They must there- 
fore dedicate themselves, seifessly 
and without reserve, to improving the 
lot of the masses. Today, when the 
world is passing through a material 
and moral crisis, an inner circle of 
intellectual Brahmins might open a 
dark gulf between man and men, be- 
tween peace and justice, between the 
intellect and c.vilization. 
A Boy and A Map 
AY I repeat to you a story 
M which was popular among 
diplomats before the war? An Eng- 
lish university don had invited to 
his home a few of his intellectual 
friends. But their conversation was 
continually interrupted by one of the 
host's sons, - a boy of six or seven, 
who kept on pestering the guests 
with questions. In order to get rid 
of him, his father thought he would 
set him a game taking some time. 
He tore up a large map of the world 
which was lying on the table and 
told the boy not to come back until 
he had stuck the map together again. 
He thought he would get rid of him 
in this easy way for some consider- 
able time. 
He was greatly surprised when the 
child returned a few minutes later 
with the work completed. 
They were not long in discovering 
the secret of the young cartographer. 
The map had been printed on paper, 
on the other side of -which was the 
silhouette of a man standing erect. 
To put the pieces in order, the child 
had no: had to rely on his knowledge 
of geography, no doubt very inade- 
quate, but on something much more 
tangible, the visible structure of 
human beings. Thus, by reassembling 
the picture of the man, he had reas- 
sembled the map of the world. 
Is there not an important lesson 
for us in this story? 
It is only by thinking of Man and 
On Declaration of Human Rights 
by endeavouring to refashion him (to 
refashion his conscious mind, his 
love of good) that we shall succeed 
one day, without too many hesita- 
tions and errors, in giving a new 
political contour to the earth, and 
in remaking the social and economic 
map of the contemporary world. 
Towards World Citizenship 
HAT is the duty of those who, 
1 like you in this University and 
ourselves of Unesco, are devoting 
their efforts to winning Man, through 
culture for the common adventure 
of humanity. Unesco’'s main task is 
to find men, individuals, among the 
citizens of all nations, among the in- 
habitants of all countries. Individuals 
speaking different languages, sing- 
ing different anthems, rallying to 
different banners, but all of whom, 
despite the unfortunate disparity of 
their resources, endeavour to over- 
come the same anxieties: poverty, 
fear, ignorance and disease, to the 
end that eccnomic and cultural con- 
ditions more equitable for all may 
enable them to reach self-expression. 
Yes, we are looking for individuals. 
But amid so many threats and com- 
promises, where are they to be found? 
During the war they disappeared, 
swallowed up by the Moloch of the 
Army. ‘Today, after the signing of 
armistices, when "peace should be 
established, we still hear the groans 
of the individual behind the ram- 
parts of narrow nationalisms. 
That voice is drowned by the din 
of every kind of propaganda. Often 
it reaches us d.storted by those who 
should be most concerned to trans- 
‘mit it to us faithfully. And, what is 
most appalling, the absence of the 
individual, his submission to the 
dictates of factions, endangers the 
working of an international system 
whose final end is indeed a universal 
policy and economy, but which must 
nevertheless rely on local, national or 
even regional realities. 
Unesco has entered the lists against 
the perils of this disappearance, this 
submission of the individual and has 
engaged all its resources In the task 
of awakening in the conscience of 
the peoples the inner summons to 
world citizenship. In such a task the 
help of the intellectuals of France 
will be of great value to us. 
A Solemn Responsibility - 
The Universal Declaration of Hu- 
man Rights confronts us with "a 
solemn responsibility which we can- 
not evade: it is for all of us to ensure 
that each of these rights becomes a 
reality in all circumstances and in 
all places. It is not by decrees that 
we shall succeed, but by a common 
effort, in which each will contribute 
his part, whether by understanding 
or by persuasion. For, in the words of 
one of the greatest poets of our time, 
“the individuality of Man is price- 
less, for it is that alone which enables 
us to realize the universal”. 
Monsieur le Président de la Répu- 
blique : 
My last words are addressed to 
you, whose presence today, in the 
amphitheatre of a University so dear 
to us all, has the significance of a 
testimony of which the world has 
never been unheedful. 
You show us that France is proud 
to acknowledge Man's creative 
mission. 
Nothing could be in closer har- 
mony with the traditions of the 
people to whom the world owes the 
glorious principles of 1789. And the 
Universal Declaration of the United 
Nations is inspired in many of its 
clauses by those principles. 
Testimony of such authority is to 
Unesco both an encouragement and 
a promise. I am grateful for that en- 
couragement and deeply stirred by 
that pramise
