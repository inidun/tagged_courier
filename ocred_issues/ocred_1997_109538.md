THE CHAIR 
  
1994, acrylic on newspaper 
(80 x 56 cm) 
by Michel Molins 
This chair belongs to the 
oldest member of a pygmy 
group whose life 
the artist shared during a 
month spent in Africa, It 
symbolizes the gradual 
sedentarization “directly or 
indirectly” imposed on the 
world’s nomadic peoples, 
The painter sees this 
widespread sedentarization 
as a form of intolerance 
and a refusal by dominant 
societies to accept 
ways of life different from 
their own.

was a reminder both that the theatre is a major art and that it is in good shape. In spite of = | 
strong competition from the cinema and to an even greater extent from television, theatre 4 
still attracts vast audiences the world over. 
What makes the theatre irreplaceable is the direct physical link it establishes between 
a what happens onstage and the audience, This explains why each performance in the theatre is 
unique. However many times a film or a video is shown its content never varies; a theatrical per- 
formance is never the same twice running. The emotions it arouses are stimulated by a myste- 
rious process of alchemy, which begins when the actors encounter an audience that is always dif- 
ferent, and which dies out when the curtain falls. Theatre is designed to serve this mystery, to 
enable it to happen again and again. 
This plasticity which is the touchstone of theatre may be one of the reasons why theatre has 
survived for so many centuries and found a place in so many cultures; why it has adapted to all 
periods and has sometimes foreshadowed them and even announced their birth. 
Since the invention of classical theatre by the Greeks, great dramatists such as Shake- 
speare, Beaumarchais, Goethe and Ibsen have given wide currency to this concept of theatre in 
the West. But what of theatre elsewhere? This issue looks at what happened in Japan and India, 
in Africa and the Arab world, and to some extent in Latin America and Russia, after theatre 
rooted in traditional society was confronted with “the shock of the new”—modern European 
theatre which has tended to focus on what might be called intimate tragedy rather than the des- 
tiny of communities, highlighting the individual personality rather than the archetype. Far from 
collapsing, however, theatre in these countries has taken on a new lease of life in the twenti- 
eth century. 
It is almost as if theatre-lovers everywhere had spontaneously agreed that the new should 
not be allowed to sign the death warrant of the old—in this case theatre itself—but should 
instead seek channels whereby traditional inspiration could irrigate modern forms of expression, 
whereby the theatre, by transforming itself, would continue to celebrate life. 
The ninth International Festival of Experimental Theatre, held in Cairo from 1 to 11 September 
1997, showed brilliantly how attempts are being made on all continents to present many of the 
great questions of the contemporary world through the prism of theatre. 
In other words, where there's life there's theatre. ®

### 109539: Theatre for tomorrow

In an age of spreading computer technology and cultural intermingling, 
the world’s many forms of theatre have reached a crucial stage 
Theatre for tomorrow 
The Dragons’ Trilogy, 
directed by the Canadian 
Robert Lepage, a leading 
exponent of the “forward- 
looking avant-garde”. 
 
THE UNESCO Courier BR NOVEMBER 1997 
“Where is the theatre going?” The ques- 
tion is often asked, but perhaps it 
would be more accurate to ask it in the plural 
rather than the singular, for itis clear that there 
are many different kinds of theatre and that 
they are not moving in lock-step. 
There is the theatre of artists, modeled on 
Western-style plays made mostly of words, 
written by playwrights and acted for the most 
part in a naturalistic style. 
BY RICHARD SCHECHNER 
There is the theatre of highly codified ges- 
tures, costumes and make-up, combining the 
spoken word with sung dialogue and songs, 
such as Japanese Kabuki. 
There 1s theatre that could also be called 
dance or opera because of its total integration 
of movement, gesture, song and narrative— 
such as Chinese jingju or Indian Kathakali. 
There is the theatre of ritual performances 
addressing, honouring or entertaining the 
gods—as practised in many cultures around 
the world. 
There is the theatre of popular festivity 
and ritual where people build and wear masks 
and full-body costumes, such as Yoruban 
gelede, Hopi kachina, or Trinidadian carnival. 
Theres the theatre of religious narrative which 
takes many days to enact, such as Indian 
Ramlila, Yaqui Waehma, or the Passion play 
performed once every ten years at Oberam- 
mergau in Germany. 
There is so-called “mainstream” theatre— 
Broadway, the West End and Boulevard Theatre, 
There is also avant-garde or experimental 
theatre. 
The life and death 
of the avant-garde 
Once upon a time avant-garde or experimen- 
tal theatre was “in advance of” what was fol- 
lowing. But it has been at least twenty-five 
years since that was so. Avant-garde theatre is 
no longer in advance of anything, and most of 
the persons working in it do not risk failure 
in order to explore new boundaries of per- 
formance knowledge or practice. In fact, there 
are strong arguments for saying that all today’s 
theatre is “official”, paid for by governments, 
foundations, or other mainstream funds—or 
desiring to be paid for by them. Of course, 
many works are still labeled “avant-garde”, 
but the term does not refer to a single style or 
tendency, but to several. 
v The current avant-garde consists of what- 
ever or whoever critics, audiences and artists 
identify as belonging to the avant-garde. Calling

1975. 
atheatreartist “avant-garde” is sometimes more 
a way of praising the artist than describing the 
work. 
¢ The historical avant-garde. This is the 
line of development which began with natu- 
ralism in Europe in the 1880s and extended 
through many successive waves of experi- 
mentation: symbolism, futurism, Dada, sur- 
realism, Happenings, environmental theatre, 
performance art, and so on. Each of these 
claimed hegemony over all its predecessors; 
cach was destined to be absorbed into the 
mainstream in one way or another. Works that 
were hissed off the stage by one generation 
were honoured by the next. 
This historical avant-garde ended in the 
1970s. No more waves of newness came crash- 
ing onto the shore. With the emergence of 
postmodernism, recycling came to the fore 
The end of the historical avant-garde probably 
coincided with a certain perception of the final- 
ity of scientific knowledge, as new develop- 
ments in science came to be technical innova- 
tions and “improvements” rather than shifts 
in fundamental paradigms. A definite mode 
of stability reminiscent of the European Mid- 
dle Ages came to be felt. Perhaps if newness is 
to become important again it will originate 
outside the Euro-American cultural sphere. 
But since the end of the Cold War and the 
advent of “globalization”, is anywhere really 
outside the Euro-American cultural sphere? 
¢/ The forward-looking avant-garde enacts 
an amazing and sometimes apocalyptic future. 
It celebrates the newest technology and is cur- 
rently dominated by interactive telecommu- 
nications and CD-ROMS, the Internet, virtual 
realities, and multimedia. 
v The tradition-secking avant-garde, on 
the other hand, eschews high tech and looks 
instead towards “ancient knowledge,” “ritu- 
als,” and “traditional performances” especially 
in non-Western cultures. Here the ideas and 
researches of the Polish director and teacher 
of acting Jerzy Grotowski are dominant. Gro- 
towski has said that his goal is “To re-evokea 
very ancient form of art where ritual and artis- 
tic creation were seamless. Where poetry was 
song, song was incantation, movement was 
dance. One might say—but it is only a 
metaphor—that we are trying to go back and 
discover what was before the Tower of Babel. 
First to discover differences, and then to dis- 
cover what was before the differences. ... We 
can hopetodiscoveravery old form of are, art 
as a way of knowledge.”

» ¢ The intercultural avant-garde has two 
aspects. One 1s positive, secking and synthe- 
sizing “universals” and connections between 
cultures. The other is ironic and probing, seck- 
ing out disjunctures and miscommunications 
“at the borders.” The work of the Danish direc- 
tor Eugenio Barba and his International School 
of Theatre Anthropology (ISTA)is an example 
of the first aspect (see the UNESCO Courier, 
January 1996); the practice and theories of the 
performanceartist Guillermo Gomez-Pena are 
an example of the second. 
At ISTA and in his writings, Barba 
attempts to show how “pre-cxpressive” posi- 
tions, movements and gestures are at the root 
of all effective artistic performing. For Barba, 
these are most clearly seen in Asian dance-the- 
atres such as Kathakali and Odissi in India, 
buto in Japan, jingju, and kunchu in China. 
Gomez-Pena emphasizes the contradictions 
of living and working in more than one cul- 
ture simultaneously. While Barba wants to 
find connections, Gomez-Pcna and others like 
him explore the ways in which cultures collide 
and fail to communicate, with their attendant 
fractures, difficulties, ideological contradic- 
tions and crumbling national myths. Barba 
tends to work with traditional performers; 
Gomez-Pena with both traditional and post- 
modern artists. 
The principal goal of the historical avant- 
garde was to expose, ridicule, and destabilize 
official art and official culture. The principal 
goals of the other four kinds of avant-gardeare 
too various to summarize, but revolution and 
rebellion are not today very important themes. 
Nor is there an attempt to present “the shock 
of the new”. The newest work in today’s 
avant-garde is highly technological—and these 
technologies are immensely popular and wide- 
spread, global even. They are innovative but 
not shocking; they tend to integrate rather 
than divide; and they cost a lot of money, 
especially during the development stage, and so 
there has to be a deep alliance with the social 
forces that have money. 
What next: 
Once it was felt that theatre would disappear 
in the face of various other forms of dramatic 
entertainment and arts, especially movies and 
video. But the emergence of computer tech- 
nology is more likely to lead to a collapse of 
the differences between the various media arts. 
The use of the information chip instead of 
strips of celluloid or magnetic tape will mean 
an increasingly easy-to-use flow back and forth 
of images and actions from computer to film

to video—and also between the so-called live 
and the so-called mediated. 
[ use the term “so-called” because interac- 
tivity will allow for the immediate interven- 
tion of “viewers” or “audiences” who will 
become “users” or co-creators. And although 
fixed-text media—movies and television—will 
be ubiquitous, interactive exchanges on the 
personal as well as the artistic level will increase 
exponentially. 
The emergence of chip technology and per- 
formance does not sound the death knell of 
“live theatre”. It means only that the various 
avant-gardes will bifurcate even more. If today 
thereare five avant-gardes, in twenty-five years 
there may be ten or more. 
Collectively, there will be a lot of live per- 
formance, but each genre will have relatively 
few scattered clients, brought together first by 
means of the Internet and secondly by local 
and regional “festivals” or other occasions that 
gather into one spot for a limited time all those 
interested in a certain kind of performance.

Culture will no longer be defined as local- 
1zed in place, but as localized in taste and prac- 
tice. People will be able to belong to a “drama 
culture” or a “performance art culture” wher- 
ever they happen to live. 
This new definition of “local” will have an 
effect on traditional performance genres. At 
present, such forms as Kathakali or N§, 
gelede, samba or wayang kulit have been tied 
to a particular place, particular social practices, 
and particular practitioners. But increasingly, 
at least some of these forms arc opening to 
practitioners who might not be “born to 
them,” and are frequently domiciled outside 
their place of origin or primary practice. 
Global tourism 
and traditional arts 
Global tourism exerts an extremely strong pres- 
sure. Governments and corporations—often 
indistinguishable from each other—are replac- 
@ 
2 
  
        
ing traditional patrons. Already many tradi- 
tional arts have been commercialized, global- 
ized and “smoothed out” to satisfy the tastes 
of tourists and “art lovers”. Only those societies 
rich enough to establish categories comparable 
to Japan’s “living national treasures” will be 
able to preserve their traditional arts as such. 
And even when they are preserved in this way, 
the traditional arts tend to exist in venues that 
are, like museums or game parks, strictly fenced 
off from the impact of ongoing life. Many tra- 
ditional arts will cease to exist. No effective 
remedy has been found to stop this cultural 
extinction, which is in any case not entirely 
bad. Times and circumstances change; not every- 
thing that was can be preserved indefinitely. 
Sometimes the urge to preserve is a mask hid- 
ing fear of change. 
Nor ought we to underestimate people’ 
inventiveness and creativity, especially the 
power of popular culture. As advanced 
economics preserve some traditional arts in 
their traditional forms, and other less pro- 
tected arts vanish, a new category of continu- 
ous creation of tradition through fusion and 
hybridity is emerging. Throughout Latin 
America, for example, performances fusing 
African, European, and Native American reli- 
gions are thriving. Other parts of the world are 
experiencing a similar surge of creativity. 
Over the past several centuries immigra- 
tion and displacement have created the great- 
est movement among the world’s peoples ever 
experienced. From assailed or displaced frag- 
ments of cultural practices, new vigorous per- 
formances have arisen. And soon enough, for- 
merly “artificial” or “synthetic” practices are 
transformed into new wholes. We live in a 
period where older traditional arts exist side by 
side with new traditional arts, the fruit of 
both consciously “invented traditions” and 
less thought-out but very robust hybrids. 
‘Ordinary theatre’—the string 
quartet of the next century 
And what about “ordinary theatre” (in Euro- 
American terms), the enactment of dramas 
written by playwrights and performed by 
actors? Of course, this kind of theatre is not 
“universal” and “omnipresent”. Itis a specific 
cultural occurrence and as such it could go 
extinct. But I don’t think it will. I believe that 
this kind of theatre will become the string 
quartet of the twenty-first century. By that I 
mean that it will have a small devoted audi- 
ence, but it will not be important in the way 
it was, say, at the end of the nineteenth century »

when anew drama by Ibsen could shake up an 
entire continent. The important debates about 
public culture will be conducted outside the- 
atres—on TV, over the Internet, in new ritu- 
als convened and enacted electronically, or via 
mass movements assembled in the streets. 
Live performance 
But this is not the whole story. The utopian 
clectronic global village may turn out to be as 
non-existent as all previous utopias. The media 
and the Internet are increasingly omnipresent 
but they do not satisfy certain basic needs 
that are met by live performance. In fact, live 
theatre will flourish to some degree because 
of the rapid development of media and instant 
information transmission. Note that I say 
“information” —and perhaps ought to say 
“data”—and do not use the more complex 
term “communication”. The media provide 
more information than communication, while 
live performance often offers more commu- 
nication than information. 
Live performance can be sub-divided into 
non-theatre and theatre performances. The 
former include performance in everyday life, 
THE UNESCO Courier B NOVEMBER 1997 
religious services, sports, and popular enter- 
tainments such as rock-music concerts and 
theme parks. Thereare three kinds of live the- 
atre: Broadway, boulevard, and other large- 
scale commercial enterprises; not-for-profit, 
subsidized mainstream theatres such as the 
Stadtheaters in Germany or the regional the- 
atres in the U.S.A; experimental theatre and 
performance art. 
Commercial theatre is self-supporting 
because it effectively exploits crossovers 
between media and live performance. Shows 
and stars exist both live and on tape, CDs, 
and film. In this sense, the pop entertainment 
industry is the most advanced performance 
genre economically and technically. 
The Stadtheater system is the way in which 
the middle class tells itself that it is “cultured” 
and “responsible”. Its repertory is based on 
“classics” but includes some new works and 
the safer experimental artists who “graduate” 
to official status.

experimental theatre. But basically, experi- 
mental theatre and performance art take place 
in small venues for tiny audiences. 
Yet they perform a very important func- 
tion. Live performance of this type contin- 
ues to be “dangerous”. By dangerous I do not 
mean that the performers wound themselves 
onstage but that they work in front of audi- 
ences while making and recovering from mis- 
takes and unforeseen circumstances. Live per- 
formanceis also able to explore risky or taboo 
subjects, unlike large-scale media such as film 
and video which involve so much money that 
often the financial backers do not want to take 
chances. Finally, live performances before/with 
small audiences allow for the experience of 
close contact physically, emotionally and con- 
ceptually between actors and spectators. This 
experience of shared presence is irreplaceable. 
Will there be money for this kind of the- 
atre? Surely not enough. At one time, exper- 
imental performance got no public or official 
support at all. Maybe under those circum- 
stances the avant-garde was most alive, dan- 
gerous, and important, since it owed its exis- 
tence to no onc except the artists and the 
immediate audiences gave freedom to those 
involved. Of course, censorship and worse has 
always been and will continue to be a threat. 
But the underground scems to find a way. 
Thereis areal need for an unofficial or anti- 
official theatre. Official theatre—no matter 
how beautiful—is always just that, “official”. 
And in houses of worship—live theatre’s clos- 
est sibling—laughter is scarce, especially laugh- 
ter of the sarcastic, ironic, parodic, and blas- 
phemous kinds. Nor do church, synagogue, 
mosque or temple encourage bleak tragedy or 
atheistic scepticism. Official or corporate the- 
atres, newspapers and media, as well as state 
sponsored religions, all require continuous 
challenge and critique. Corrective tones of 
unbelief, mockery, parody, horror and delight 
are found in experimental theatre and perfor- 
mance art. I hope the next century will see 
plenty of this kind of theatre. ||

Theatre people only became an accepted 
part of African society sometime in the 
1980s. It was on European stages that most 
of them, like the Congolese poet Sony Labou 
Tansi and his Roccado Zulu Theatre, first won 
recognition and fame. Then, largely as aresult 
of democratization and the spread of educa- 
tion, theatre took root in African soil and 
endeavoured to become involved in African 
society. This change can be seen in the flower- 
ing and spread of social action theatre, a form 
of drama which has different names in differ-

staged in local languages for grassroots audi- 
ences in villages and urban working class neigh- 
bourhoods. Social action drama attempts to 
change attitudes about specific questions such 
as hygiene, customs or relationships with 
community property (a well, for example). 
Signs of this change can also be seen in the 
increasing number of facilities for production 
and performance across the continent. The- 
atres, private cultural centres and festivals reveal 
a strong determination by African artists to 
produce theatre tailored for their public. What 
impact has this had on the sources of inspira- 
tion used by creative artists? 
During the 1980s, political life was the pri- 
mary source for African playwrights, who 
concentrated on describing what they saw as 
the bankruptcy of African political regimes. 
Plays like Sony Labou Tansi’s Anthony Sold 
Me His Destiny (1986) and The Street of Flies 
(1985), Zadi Zahourou Bernard’s The Secret of 
the Gods (1985), Senouvo Agbota Zinsou’s 
The Singing Turtle (1985) and my own The 
Entranced Savannah (1990) and The Mad- 
man (1987) were highly popular. 
With the advent of the 1990s politics were 
replaced by three other main sources of inspi- 
ration: traditional dramatization, religious 
ritual and folk art. 
Traditional drama 
Traditional African society is highly codified 
and the individual is subject to such a wide 
range of social, professional and religious rules 
that he or she ends up thinking that only the 
community counts. 
Yet almost everywhere these rules provide 
for moments of release where the individual is 
allowed to transgress the social code, often 
through acting. In Mali, for example, the 
avowed goal of the kotéba, a form of folk the- 
atre organized once a year by young people, 
was to give the young a chance to criticize their 
elders. This was the only occasion in the year 
when they could do this without risk—the 
young people were in duty bound to have 
their say about society, while their elders were 
in duty bound not to hold it against them.

everything returned to normal. 
These two examples are interesting because 
they can be considered as forms of play, of 
social dramatization or dedramatization. The 
protagonists were aware that they werc acting 
because they knew that at a specific moment 
the rules would change again. The current suc- 
cess of African social action theatre has roots 
in social games of this kind. 
Although this form of theatre was created 
and tested in Latin America, especially Brazil, 
by Augusto Boal, it has not simply been lifted 
from Latin America and transplanted in Africa. 
African society has changed so much that a 
tool had to be found to enable ruling classes, 
whether African or non-African, which are 
often out of touch with everyday life, to com- 
municate with local communities in order to 
involve them in development. African social 
action theatre is far less political in its inten- 
theatre of the oppressed” 
and is effective because it knows so much 
about the mindset of those it wishes to reach.

the process whereby traditional societies peri-

» theatre achieves very close contact with its 
audience by adopting the acting techniques of 
traditional artists such as the West African 
griot. The goal of each performance is to cre- 
ate an atmosphere that will encourage com- 
munication between the different groups in 
the audience. The audience and the audience 
alone will make the decision whether or not to 
change its behaviour. 
Religious ritual 
We have also seen a flowering of religious sects 
and a strengthening of mysticism in tradi- 
tional religions—Animism, Christianity and 
Islam. As a mirror to life, the theatre could 
not afford to ignore this movement. 
Firstly we are seeing a return to traditional 
ritual. In Céte d’Ivoire, for example, so-called 
ritual theatre has been one of the main avenues 
of experimentation in theatre, opened up by 
studies carried out by Jacques Scherer and 
Werewere Liking on the ritual and staging 
techniques of the Basa pcople of Cameroon. 
Since then, the presence of ritual in the theatre 
has become commonplace. In 1985 Sony 
Labou Tansi was already noting in the intro- 
duction to The Street of Flies that “This play 
is in the tradition of a theatre that is as old as 
the Kongo world, the Kingizila or theatre of 
healing.” Zadi Zahourou Bernard has based 
his entire theatre aesthetic on a ritual of the 
Bete people of Cote d'Ivoire from which his 
troupe, Didiga, takes its name.

But these borrowings are not limited to 
traditional rituals; theatre has also drawn inspi- 
ration from imported religions. Concert Party, 
for example, a form of popular theatre staged 
in Togo and Ghana, owes its form to Chris- 
tian church rituals in those countries. 
Nowadays most big African theatre shows 
have their share of “rituality” either in the set- 
ting and the acting or in the words themselves.

of Mwambayi Kalengayi’s (of the former Zaire) 
production of La passion selon Pier Paolo

In a different way, the costumes, make-up 
and plot of Fasou Siba’s Guinea National The-

strange resemblance to a ceremony of exor- 
cism in a village. 
Traditional arts 
At present, however, playwrights draw most 
of their inspiration from folk tales. 
Of a total of some twenty plays staged in 
African theatres in 1996 and 1997, more than 
half were based on folk tales. Some plays such 
as Akonio Dolo’s Zinimo . . . Zinimo Zi, 
Souleymane Koly’s La colére de la brousse 
(“The Anger of the Bush”) and Habib Dem- 
bélé’s Fidélité cravachée (“Horsewhipped 
Loyalty”), stay very close to classic tales 
although they attach more importance to the 
use of space and movement. They contain two 
characteristic features of folk tales—clements 
of fantasy combined with an outlook on the 
world that always makes a moral point. The 
work of the African sage Amadou Hampaté Bi 
is also beginning to be adapted to the stage. 
 
Through use of folk sources—community 
life, folk plays, religious ritual and folk tales— 
African theatre has confirmed its goal of 
addressing itself above all to the audience it 
wants to reach, an African audience. And that 
is a good thing, for it is by translating the 
deepest aspirations of this audience that 
African theatre will carn credibility and some 
day have a chance of attracting wider audiences.

### 109541: An Art in search of its roots

  
An art In search of ItS roots 
Raslila, below, is a devotional and ritual theatre form which originated 
in northern India. 
 
THE UNESCO Gounier B NOVEMBIR 1997 
BY ROMAIN MAITRA 
Indian folk theatre is a composite art 
with a composite set of skills practised 
by artists who stage a total performance 
through the creation of verbal, spatial and 
visual patterns. Folk theatre forms such as 
Jatra from Bengal, Tamasha from Maharash- 
tra, Nautanki from Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan 
and Punjab, Bhavai from Gujarat, Yaksha- 
gana from Karnataka and Therukuttu from 
Tamil Nadu feature a wide range of make-up, 
song, dance, mime, improvised repartee, slap- 
stick or stylized acting, and even acrobatics. 
These folk theatres give a glimpse of styles 
of speech, music, dance, dress, behaviour, 
humour, legend, proverb and wit in their 
respective regions. The actors, who are often 
very talented performers, speak directly to the

audience—audience participation is the hall- 
mark of Indian folk theatre—and often 
improvise. They are apt to mix up several 
moods and disciplines, from time to time 
bursting into song and dancing with gusto 
when the chorus sings their dialogue. The 
resultis a form of drama which springs from 
an exhilarating freedom of expression and pro- 
vides the villagers with a complete emotional 
experience in an environment in which ideas 
can be effortlessly communicated. 
Folk forms have their own stage conven- 
tions and production styles. The scenography 
is nonrealistic and the stage is usually a bare 
space manipulated by the actors through the 
use of stylized and symbolic make-up and by 
codified gait, choreographic acting, and sym- 
bolic hand gestures. Change of location is 
denoted by movement and by word of mouth 
rather than by change of set and decor. 
Folk theatre has inherited many of the clas- 
sical conventions of Sanskrit theatre. The clas- 
sical Sutradhar or narrator is used in several 
vernacular theatres, and the classical Vidushak 
or buffoon appears under different names in 
different regions as Konangi, Komali, or 
Joothan Mian. Other stock characters are 
found in different regions. 
While ageless in pattern these performances 
are refreshingly novel in their appeal. Cosmic 
or symbolic battles between the forces of good 
and evil, mythological stories and legendary 
romantic tales are sprinkled with commen- 
tary on current social or political conditions. 
One reason for the survival of folk plays, in 
fact, has been their capacity to gradually adapt 
old themes to changing ways of life and sati- 
rize the latest local happenings. The exaggera- 
tion, malapropism and ready wit in the fol- 
lowing picce of dialogue from Naga! (from 
Punjab), taken from Balwant Gargi’s Folk 
Theatre of India (1966), is typical.

With the disintegration of the traditional

pounding the ill effects of 200 years of colo- 
nization which had already shaken traditional 
Indian cultures loose from their moorings. 
Urban influences have a weapon of matchless 
power—the TV and cinema—whose shadow 
is falling over village drama. 
And yet at the same time, many Indian direc- 
tors realize that theatre forms borrowed froin 
the West are inadequate to project the social aspi- 
rations, ways of life, cultural patterns and prob- 
lems of the people of India as a whole. Since, 
like theatre artists all over the world, they are 
interested in establishing a closer relationship 
between the theatre and the people, there is every 
reason why they should make greater use of the 
living tradition of indigenous theatre 
It is unfortunate that there has not been 
more mutual exchange and collaboration 
between the urban and rural traditions in 
Indian theatre. Some leading theatre groups 
in Calcutta, Bombay and Delhi are involved in 
experiments of this kind, but they are rela- 
tively few. Ultimately, the outcome of their 
work will depend on the resilience of the the- 
atre form itself to withstand and coexist with 
the powerful invasion of commercial cinema 
and television sitcoms and serials. |

There is a basic difference between classi- 
cal Japanese theatre and Shingeki or 
“modern theatre”, which emerged in the carly 
twentieth century under the influence of West- 
crn theatre. Classical theatre, which is performed 
exclusively by men, is musical theatre with a 
strong infusion of dance, unlike Shingeks, 
which is purely verbal, a theatre of dialogue. 
The traditional forms of Japanese classical 
drama, No, Kabuki and Bunraku, are quite dis- 
tinct from cach other and each one has its own 
playhouses. Thereare N6 theatres (ndgaku dd) 
and Kabuki theatres, and Bunraku (a variant 
of puppet theatre) is only performed on spe- 
cially designed stages. When Shingeki came 
along, it created a need for Western-style play- 
houses in which the curtain divides the stage 
from the audience. In response to the acsthet- 
ics of realism, women began appearing in plays 
after centuries of banishment from the stage. 
In theory neither traditional theatre nor 
modern theatre, which politically speaking leans 
to the left, receive state subsidies. National the-

largely at a female audience, still has an immense 
following today. 
Born again Shingeki 
During Japan’s militarist period before the Sec- 
ond World War, Shingeki was repressed, and 
by the summer of 1945 only one company was 
left—the Bungaku-za (“The Company of Let- 
ters”), which had been founded in 1937. Dur- 
ing the democratization process initiated by 
the American authorities, Shingeki came back to 
lifc as popular theatre. Newly founded around 
directors such as Aoyama Sugisaku® and Senda 
Korceya, the Haiy(i-za (Actors Theatre) Com- 
pany in 1946 staged Kensatsukan, a Japanese 
version of Gogol’s Revisor (The Inspector 
General). After reforming his company, 
Shinkyo6gekidan, which he had been forced to 
break up, Murayama Tomoyoshi returned to 
the theatre in the same year with Kofuku no

House of Happiness. Kubo Sakae, one of 
Shingeki’s great playwrights, inaugurated the 
Tokyo Geijutsu Gekijd (the Tokyo Art The- 
atre) with actors including Takizawa Osamu, 
and made a new departure in the same year with 
Ibsen’s A Doll’s House. A number of leading 
theatre people joined the communist party 
(newly recognized as a political party) and, as 
before the war, made it their duty to spread its 
message through the theatre. 
By 1948 the great figures of pre-war Shingcki 
had already made their come-back. Some new 
plays, such as Miyoshi Jurd’s Sono hito o shirazu 
(“You don’t know this man”) and Tanaka 
Shikao’s Kumo no batate (“At the end of the 
clouds”), depicted post-war life. Others like 
Kinoshita Junji’s Yazuru (“Twilight of a 
Crane”), staged by the Budd no kai company, 
and Onna no isshé (“The Life of a Woman”), 
performed by the Bungaku-za company, 
became classics of the modern repertory. 
The year 1950 was a turning-point in post- 
war history. The Cold War between the United 
States and the former Soviet Union had settled 
in. When war broke out in nearby Korea, anti- 
communist purges in Japan spared neither the 
cinema nor the theatre. One Shingeki com- 
pany, the Haiy@-za, built a small theatre in 
1954 (the Haiyii-za gekijo) where it staged 
Onna no heiwa, a production of Aristo- 
phanes’ Women in Parliament. It is still 
unusual today for a Shingeki company to have 
its own theatre; most of the time they hire 
theatres for their plays.

The Haiyi-za became the leading Shingeki 
theatre when in 1949 it founded its own train- 
ing centre, which came to provide it and other 
companies with a plentiful supply of actors. 
Shiki, a company founded by Asari Keita and 
Kusaka Takeshi, reappraised the approach 
which had presided over the origins of 
Shingeki, that of Stanislavsky-inspired real- 
tsm. It specialized in the plays of Jean Girau- 
doux and Jean Anouilh, which had very rarely 
been staged in Japan. In 1955, the Bungaku-za 
(Literary Theatre) Company had a hit with 
Hamlet in a version translated and directed 
by Fukuda Tsunecari. Shakespeare is the most 
widely performed playwright in Japan. In 
terms of the number of performances per 
author, he shares first place with the Kabuki

playwright Kawatake Miluami. The diversity 
and depth of his work are a source of endless 
fascination to theatre lovers. 
One important feature of post-war Shingeki 
was the introduction of Bertolt Brecht’s plays 
and theories of drama. Brecht’s Fear and Mis- 
ery of the Third Reich was first staged in Japan 
by Senda Koreeya with the Haiyt-za ydseisho 
(School of Dramatic Art) in 1953. Debate about 
Brecht’s ideas on drama went hand in hand 
with questioning about the renewal of the 
modern world through theatre. 
In 1957, for the first time in the history 
of a Shingeki company, the Bungaku-za used 
Kabuki actors in a Fukuda Tsuneari play 
(Akechi Mitsubide). The first tour of Japan by 
the Moscow Art Theatre the following year 
had a tremendous impact. It marked the start 
of a wave of tours by famous foreign com- 
panies that began to develop in the second half 
of the 1970s.

Notes from underground 
While big demonstrations against the renewal 
of the security treaty with the United States 
were taking place in 1960, Bungaku-za brought 
the theatre of the absurd to Japan with their 
production of Samuel Beckett’s Waiting for 
Godot. The play hinted that, like Godot, the 
change long awaited by part of public opinion 
would not appear. . .. A series of plays by 
Beckett and Eugene Ionesco were produced 
around this time, which also saw the first per- 
formances of Shingeki outside Japan. 
The events of spring 1960 also left their 
mark on the world of Shingeki. The author- 
ity of the major companies such as Haiy(-za, 
Bungaku-za and Mingei began to be ques- 
tioned and new companies critical of their pre- 
decessors emerged. This was a period of intense 
experimentation and creative activity. Doubts 
about the traditional left were accompanied 
by criticism of Shingeki. 
The aim behind this experimentation was 
to create a different theatre from Shingeki, 
and renewal took an extreme form in 1967 
with a Karagumi (situationist theatre) per- 
formance. In the same year the Tenjosajiki

company (The Gallery Company) broke new 
ground as part of the drive for “the rehabili- 
tation of theatre”. Faces wearing way-out 
Kabuki make-up appeared on stage and pop 
songs announced that Shingeki was a thing of 
the past. A world of human folly was por- 
trayed in an atmosphere of utter confusion. 
Put out of their stride by the emergence of 
such a different kind of theatre, critics soon 
dubbed it Angura (“underground”). 
Each underground company had its own 
special features, but they all shared a belief in 
the need to destroy the traditional perception 
of theatre and staging, in the importance of the 
actor’s role, In a new approach to N6 and 
Kabuki, in the abandonment of realism and in 
exploration of the human unconscious. 
The Tenjdsajiki company, directed by Ter- 
ayama Shiji, staged many bold experiments, 
changing its use of space and stagecraft with 
each performance. For Nokku, street theatre, 
in 1975, Terayama transformed Tokyo’s Sug-

nami district into a vast stage, injecting dra- 
matic structure into daily life and obliterating 
the boundaries between reality and fiction. 
The action took place in thirty different places 
at once, making it impossible for one specta- 
tor to see the entire show. 
Strolling Dreamers 
Starting in the 1970s young playwrights, dircc- 
tors and actors influenced by Angura founded 
a host of small companies which took their cue 
from the main trends of contemporary theatre 
Among the most influential figures were 
Tsuka, who cynically examined the foibles of 
Japan and the Japanese, and Higashi, the author 
of a musical comedy, Tokyo Kid Brothers. 
Angura abolished the distinction between 
author, director and company manager, a move 
that came to be widely followed. 
Japanese society in the 1980s became highly 
prosperous and experienced the cuphoria of 
running the world’s second biggest economy 
after the United States. Concern about the 
unemployment of young people disappeared, 
and so did anxiety about the economic future 
This was the context which gave rise to Noda 
Hideki with his Company of Strolling 
Dreamers (Yume no Yiiminsha) and Kdkami 
Shoji with his Third Stage (Dai san butai). 
One distinctive feature of their style is the 
absence of any “ordinary” people from the 
stage. The heroes are young people of inde- 
terminate social background. In its stagecraft 
and its language this kind of theatre jumps 
from one forin to another. It turns away from 
Angura’s dark, brooding expressiveness and 
stages shows full of light music and dancing, 
in which sensitivity is the keynote. This form 
of theatre, very different from Shingeki and 
Angura, attracts crowds of young spectators 
from all social classes. Many companies have 
taken part in this kind of experimentation. 
In the 1990s, however, most of the com- 
panies practising this type of theatre have had 
chequered careers. The Company of Strolling 
Dreamers no longer exists. The playwrights 
of note are those who have gone back to every- 
day life and language. This marks a return to 
early Shingeki. Independent playwrights are 
making a come-back, and young authors are 
producing their works with established 
Shingeki companies. Whether these play- 
wrights work independently or not, I feel 
that contemporary Japanese theatre is once 
again at a turning point, |

Despite the sweeping changes that have occurred since the Soviet era, 
Russian theatre is still a crucible of collective enthusiasm 
A common home 
Ten Days That Shook the 
World, directed by Yuri 
Lyubimov at the Taganka 
Theatre in Moscow (1965). 
The play is based on John 
Reed's eyewitness account of 
the 1917 Revolution. 
Just a hundred years ago, a famous 
encounter took place in a well-known 
Moscow restaurant, the Slav Bazaar, between 
the actor and director Konstantin Stanislavsky 
and the playwright and critic Vladimir 
Nemirovich-Danchenko. 
They talked non-stop for eighteen hours 
and ended up agreeing to create a new company. 
Little more than a year later, the Moscow Art 
Theatre (MKhT) was born. It was to be adriving 
force of twenticth-century Russian theatre. 
The Art Theatre gave rise to numerous 
other theatres and spawned many directors 
and actors. It also nurtured some well-known 
aesthetic critics and dissenters who developed 
their own approaches to theatre. The names

with the acceptance or aggressive rejection of 
the ideas of the Theatres founders at the begin- 
ning of the century. 
In the 1930s, Stanislavsky’s ideas were glo- 
rified by the Soviet state and many of his oppo- 
nents were liquidated. In reality, however, his 
official adoption was accompanied by the nega- 
tion of all that he stood for. In the early 1930s, 
Stalin renamed the Art Theatre the “Theatre of 
Academic Art” (MKhAT), which was the sig- 
nal for all the country’s theatres to model them- 
selves on the Soviet-style MKhAT.

> The leaders of the Revolution had realized 
immediately that the theatre could be used as 
a spiritual substitute for the Church they had 
dismantled. It would not be good for the holy 
places to remain empty. So for decades, until 
the fall of the Soviet Union, this model of a 
theatre-cum-church existed in one form or 
another. If it was sacrilege, it was also remark- 
ably effective. 
In Soviet Russia, the theatre replaced a par- 
liament which had become just a rubber stamp, 
and a Church which had been half suffocated. 
Several generations of directors, actors and 
spectators had developed a kind of condi- 
tioned reflex. You didn’t go to the theatre just 
for entertainment but for communion. 
The elite’s notion of communion (sobor- 
nost), which was very popular with the Russ- 
ian symbolists at the beginning of the century, 
now found an unexpected place in society. The 
theatre became perhaps the only focal point of 
Russian sobornost, a spontaneous living con- 
tact between people. Directors and actors made 
themselves servants of the cult of the theatre 
Audience expectations rose, to the point where 
it was felt that life could be transformed by a 
moralizing production. 
When the Soviet Union began to fall apart, 
the country had about 600 state-subsidized

actors and actresses cach. In the towns, the 
theatre usually stood near the offices of the 
regional party committee or the party-con- 
trolled House of Culture. The authorities 
stressed, even geographically, the importance 
of the theatre as a vital tool in leading the 
“flock”. 
But while the vast majority of theatres 
faithfully carried out their mission for the 
party, some managed to express dissent. Oleg 
Efremov, Georgi Tovstonogov, Yuri Lyubi- 
mov and Anatoly Efros were not content just 
to reflect the standard trends of Russian the- 
atre. They also worked through troupes which 
were like families, designed not to break up 
after a few weeks but to stay together for years 
of joint creativity. This was the indelible fea- 
ture of what was, and still is, understood in 
Russia as “theatre”. 
To be in the theatre in Russia is to share a 
common home and to devote your whole life 
to a joint endeavour. It’s a long-terin artistic 
association which demands a special set of 
structural, aesthetic and, especially, moral cir- 
cumstances. 
The crisis 
The coming of freedom put our biggest the- 
atre “temples” to the test. The deaths of Efros 
and Tovstonogov plunged the Art Theatre 
and the Taganka Theatre, the two biggest the- 
atres under communism, into crisis. After a 
long internal conflict which spilled over into 
the newspapers, the Kremlin decided in May 
1987 to split up the Art Theatre. Efremov 
remained as head of one half of the MKhAT 
while actress Tatiana Dronina took charge of 
the other. The split quickly turned ideologi- 
cal, with the first MKhAT naming itself the

Chekhov and the sccond continuing to be 
called the Gorky. 
While Efremov tried yet again to revive a 
“troupe of friends” and to get back to the 
founding tenets of the MKT, the tempestu- 
ous amazon Dronina, who had no production 
or management experience, gathered so-called 
“patriotic forces” around her. At the Gorky 
MEKhAT, it was even decided to celebrate Stalin. 
At the end of a production by Sergei Kurgin- 
ian based on Mikhail Bulgakov’s play Batum, 
the white-uniformed generalissimo looks pen- 
sively into the distance and the crowd rises as 
onc on hearing the sound of the abolished 
Soviet national anthem and its words: “Stalin 
taught us to be true to the people. He has 
inspired our work and achievements.” 
From temple 
to entertainment hall 
The two MKhATs, both of them in Tver- 
skaya Street, are a good illustration of the pre- 
sent state of Russian theatre. A similar thing 
happened at the Taganka Theatre. When Ly u- 
bimov returned there, he was greeted as a hero 
and the audience chanted “stay! stay!” Some 
people wept. The spring of 1988 was still a 
heady time in Moscow. He stayed, dug up 
plays which had been banned and put on oth-

ers, including Nikolai Erdman’s The Suicide, 
Pasternak’s Dr Zhivago and Dostoyevsky’s 
The Adolescent. 
But the collapse of the Berlin Wall didn’t 
bring success. Lyubimov no longer had anyone 
to fight against. He had returned to a different 
country, something he didn’t immediately 
grasp. When he did, it was too late. His main 
opponent was a member of his troupe, one 
of his pupils, Nikolai Gubenko. The dispute 
at the Taganka took the form of a battle over 
property, but as at the Art Theatre, it was 
tinged with ideology. Gubenko was close to 
the communists, led by Zyuganov, and as his 
fellow actors said wryly, he had gone “from 
the Taganka to the Zyuganka”. 
In this situation, the days of the Soviet 
theatre caine to be regarded with nostalgia. 
Though squeezed dry by censorship and iso- 
lated by an “iron curtain” from theatre devel- 
opments in the outside world, the best pro- 
ductions of that era were an expression of the 
society’s spiritual life. One might say, recalling 
Stanislavsky, that it was a theatre with “too 
much to do”. 
In the new, relatively free atmosphere, the 
Russian theatre lost its special iinportance. 
The “super-theatre” became just theatre. Such 
downgrading affected every aspect of intellec- 
tual life. The print run of “hcavy-weight”

> newspapers and magazines fell tenfold, some- 
times a hundred-fold. Playwrights, directors 
and authors who had thought of themselves 
as good shepherds of the people were now 
confused. Their books were no longer pub- 
lished and their plays became only one of 
many leisure activities. 
It was something quite new for Russian 
theatre people to be just another part of the 
modern entertainment industry. Artistic free- 
dom was no longer felt to be something spe- 
cial and healthy. People very quickly adjusted 
to the new scene, just as they do to the air 
they breathe. 
The system of state subsidies for theatres no 
longer covered half their budgets. In an cffort 
to survive, Moscow theatres opcned casinos 
and night-clubs on their premises. Many of 
the old “theatre show enterprises,” as the Soviet 
authorities officially dubbed theatres, became 
criminal show enterprises. With a high degree of 
symbolism, signs saying “Money changed here” 
were posted outside the capital’s biggest the- 
atres. Just as the whole country was changing its 
blood, so were the theatres. That said, it was 
hard to sce what was being exchanged for what 
and, as 1t were, at what exchange rate. The loss 
of social status and of the saintly feeling that 
you were at the top of the tree, which were 
embedded in the genes of Russian artists of 
every kind, was one of the most important 
results of the change. 
At the crossroads 
The new class invented its own structures and 
took to what was called “tusovka”, a slang word 
of the new Russia which is difficult to translate. 
The word evokes big extravaganzas, endless

and Sheep, directed by Piotr 
Fomenko (1997). 
birthday celebrations, the razzmatazz of pub- 
licity, banquets, exchanges of honours, orgies of 
words and other such pleasures which Russia 
had forgotten while frozen under communism. 
In the new Moscow, political, religious 
and “artistic” tusovkas intermingled. The same 
people went from event to event, variety artists 
hobnobbed with the high clergy and satirists 
with KGB bosses. The president sent his best 
wishes to the biggest tusovkas, thus marking 
the transition of the post-Soviet artistic elite 
to a new lifestyle. 
The Russian theatre embraced the new 
trend, of which it was simultaneously recorder 
and victim. “Perestroika” plays were built 
around turning everything upside down. The 
tired old heroes and institutions—leaders of 
the Revolution, party secretaries and collec- 
tive farm virtuosos—were exposed and jeered 
at. The popular actors who once played Lenin 
now depicted the moving figure of the mur- 
dered Tsar Nicolas IT. 
Then came new characters: “international 
girls,” evil KGB agents, the heroes of the dis- 
sident movement. The puritan language of the 
old era disappeared from stage and screen as 
easily as the taboo of sexuality. A naked body 
and a daring speech became a kind of symbol 
of the freedom we had gained. “A stinking 
mixture of blood and excrement,” was how 
elderly critics described the new art forms. 
As Russia entered the market economy, 
the theatre began to depict the emergence of a 
new kind of human being, the transforma- 
tion of Soviet Man into the “nouveau riche” 
or “new Russian.” It was often hard to make 
out any difference between the subject of the 
artistic study and the resources used to carry 
it out. Socialist realism and “capitalist realism” 
turned out to be twins. 
Renewal 
There are no reliable statistics, but most the- 
atres in the capital are clearly full again, after a 
crisis period in the early 1990s. The country is 
coming out of a critical phase and the healthy 
theatre attendances of the past two years are 
striking evidence of the change. The advent of 
the free market has of course produced the 
kind of openly commercial operations famil- 
1ar in Europe and the United States. 
More interesting are the persistence and 
survival in Russia of what could be called, not 
so much home-made theatre as cult theatre,

Anatoly Vassiliev’s School of Dramatic Art. 
This is a modern experimental theatre labora- 
tory not especially noted for its annual “pro- 
ductivity” level, but its existence is crucial to 
theatre in Moscow. Vassiliev’s most recent 
work, The Lamentations of Jeremiah, was 
closer to arcligious and liturgical event than to 
traditional theatre. 
Vassilievis notalone. In St. Petersburg, Lev 
Dodin is also trying to preservea Stanislavsky- 
style repertory theatre capable of withstand- 
ing the context of rampant capitalism. Among 
the popular new theatres are the Piotr 
Fomenko Workshop and Sergei Jenovach’s 
theatre. Also popular are the shows put on 
by Kama Ginkas, usually at the small Young 
Moscow Theatregoer’s Stage (TTouZ). This is 
serious new work, highly representative of 
the creativity of the new Russian theatre. 
In June 1997, an international conference 
was held at the Art Theatre on the Slav Bazaar, 
the meeting that laid the foundations of twen- 
ticth-century Russian theatre. [t was attended 
by all of Russia’s leading stage dircctors and 
many of their European and American col- 
leagues, who reflected on the theatre achieve- 
ments of the past century and the prospects 
for the next. 
I think it was Dodin who came up with the 
best summary. For him, the Art Theatre of 
Chekhov and Stanislavsky’s time was a model 
for “home-made” theatre, family theatre built 
on two distinct foundations—great idealism 
(which made the theatre into a kind of cult), 
and the kind of clearsighted economic calcu- 
lation that is inevitable in a market economy. 
The twentieth century rubbished these 
two foundations. Idealism degenerated into 
Stalinism or fascism. Economic rationality 
and honesty degenerated into cynical wheeling 
and dealing. The laws of the marketplace have 
infiltrated the remotest corners of the theatre 
business and robbed our theatre of some of its 
meaning. 
Weare back with the same problems which 
were being argued about at the beginning of 
the century. To start the new one, Russia needs 
another Slav Bazaar. But is it only the Russian 
theatre which needs something like that? WH

### 109545: The Birth of modern Arab theatre

 
Outward-looking pioneers in the 19th century set the scene 
for contemporary theatre in the Arab world 
In February 1848, a Beirut merchant 
named Marun Al Naqqash (1817-55), 
put onin his own home a performance of ‘Al 
Bakhil, a play based on Moliere’s L’Avare. 
When the curtain rose he stood before the 
audience and delivered a prologue in true cigh- 
teenth and nineteenth century European style. 
He promised to introduce his people to a new 
artistic form, “a literary theatre... which shall 
be Western gold in an Arab mould”. This 
form, he added, was of two kinds: drama and 
opera. “It would have been much caster for 
me,” he said, “to start with the former but I 
decided to take the harder course... because it 
is more likely to meet with the approval of 
the audience and delight them. I trust that I 
have made the right choice. .. and that you will 
benefit froin this theatre, for it teaches... 
proper manners, proffers good advice, pol- 
ishes and refines.” 
Al Naqqash went on to develop his adap- 
tative approach, still embryonic in Al Bakhil, 
in plays which were based on The Arabian 
Nights and performed in a playhouse which 
he built for the purpose. After his death, his 
brother Nicolas and his nephew Salim contin- 
ued his work, taking French theatre as their 
major source of ideas and material. But faced by 
what they considered insufficient appreciation 
for their efforts they left for Egypt where they 
contributed to a budding dramatic movement. 
Meanwhile another merchant, Sheikh 
Abou Khalil Qabbani (1836-1902), was doing 
in Damascus what Marun Al Naqqash had 
started in Beirut, although unlike Al Nagqash 
he was not versed in foreign languages and had 
not travelled abroad. He may have seen per- 
formances of Italian operettas by visiting 
troupes and plays staged by Turkish actors, 
but on the whole he was solidly rooted in the 
local tradition. His major source was The Ara- 
bian Nights. 
Al Qabbani set out to establish theatre in 
Arab society as a form of entertainment that 
was deeply rooted in tradition yet open to 
new ideas and to the outside world. He failed 
because conservative forces plotted against him 
with the authorities in Istanbul and did not

give up until orders were given for his theatre 
to be closed. 
Like Salim Al Naqqash and others from 
Beirut, Al Qabbani packed up and left for 
Egypt, where a young man named Ya’coub 
Sannu’ (or Abou Naddara as he preferred to 
be called) had launched a new theatre move- 
ment. As a young man Ya’coub Sannu’ had 
been sent to Europe, where he learnt languages 
and developed a passion for the theatre. On his 
return to Egypt he worked with European 
troupes whose repertoire consisted mainly of 
operettas and farces and decided to emulate 
them. Initially using these two Western forms, 
he drew upon aspects of local tradition that 
were conducive to the development of musical 
drama. His characters were deeply rooted in the 
social fabric and used the vibrant spoken Ara- 
bic of everyday life. With Sannu’ the Western 
gold and the Arab mould merged very well— 
although one sometimes wonders which is the 
gold and which is the mould. The written text, 
the form, and the Italian frame stage were West- 
ern-inspired innovations, but everything clse 
was deeply rooted in popular tradition. 
Sannu’ wrote scores of plays, most of 
which were performed with him as principal 
actor, director, producer and prompter. The 
majority of his plays dealt with contemporary 
issues, often in a comic vein. Many had polit- 
ical overtones which made him enemies and 
alienated some of his foriner friends and spon- 
sors including the Khedive himself. His theatre 
survived for only two years until it was closed 
down by the authorities. 
Traditional shadow theatre 
Further west, traditional Arab forms were 
holding their own in Tunisia, Algeria and 
Morocco. All three countries had an active 
shadow play theatre tradition. One form, fea- 
turing a satirical figure called Garaguz, was 
banned by the French authorities in Algeria in 
1848 on account of its anti-French political 
bias. In addition to Garaguz, shadow theatre in 
both Morocco and Tunisia featured a rawi or 
narrator who told stories to a musical accom- 
paniment. In Morocco the Islainic Ashura fes- 
tival was celebrated with performances remi- 
niscent of medieval miracle plays. Western 
forms, except for Sicilian marionettes, were late 
reaching the Maghreb countries, and Western 
influence only began to make itself felt when 
travelling Egyptian companies visited Tunisia, 
Algeriaand Morocco at least half a century after 
AlNagqash, Al Qabbani and Sannu’. 
Until the middle of the twentieth century, 
successive generations of theatre practitioners 
carried on where the pioneers had left off. The 
end product almost invariably appealed to 
local taste, speaking the language of the audi-

ence, which was often drawn into the action 
despite the increasing impact of the distance 
imposed by the Italian frame indoor stage— 
carlier traditional performances usually took 
place outdoors in courtyards. 
Many translations were made of works by 
European dramatists such as Racine, Corneille, 
Shakespeare, Sheridan and Goldoni. Most of 
them were adaptations in which translators 
and directors “improved” texts or adjusted 
them to suit contemporary taste. Romeo and 
Juliet, for example, rendered as Martyrs of 
Love, ended happily and was full of song and 
music. During this productive period Arab 
theatre professionals considered the world 
drama tradition as their own and used it freely, 
often shaping it to their needs. There were 
perhaps more theatres per head of population 
in the Arab world then than there are today 
and intense activity in the theatre generated 
widespread interest and debate about the 
objectives of drama and the forms of Arabic 
that should be used in it. 
George Abyad (1880-1962) was one major 
figure in the history of the Arab theatre in 
this period. He became widely known for the 
formal style and eloquent literary language of 
his adaptations of Western plays, mainly

plays. By virtue of his foreign training which 
dictated the kind of plays he chose and his 
exaggerated acting style he helped to move 
Arab theatre away from its traditional popu- 
lar audience to a more cultivated and more 
intellectual public. 
For much of the first half of the twentieth 
century there were two types of play in Arab 
theatre. On the one hand there were “serious” 
literary translations of Western plays and orig- 
inal Arabic “literary” compositions; on the 
other there were the situation comedies, farces 
and musicals which constituted the daily fare 
of the commercial theatre. With a few excep- 
tions, notably Tewfik Al Hakim, there was 
very little creative talent at work in Arab the- 
atre by the mid-1950s. Much had been 
achieved, however, particularly in Egypt, where 
a Higher Institute for Dramatic Art and a 
national theatrc company had been established. 
The call of modernity 
A new era in the history of modern Arab 
drama began in the late 1950s with the devel- 
opment of a type of communal drama which 
could contribute to the wider socio-political

awakening. The entire Arab world was 
responding to the call of modernity by devel- 
oping its academic and cultural institutions, 
interacting with the outside world and react- 
ing to its challenges. 
The fifth of June 1967, marking defeat in 
the Six-Day War, brought home to many Arabs 
the need for political stability and transparency, 
democracy, dialogue and debate, objective analy- 
sis and freedom from rhetoric. It was thought 
that drama could contribute to this process by 
drawing on and contributing to national iden- 
tity, without however excluding foreign cul- 
tural influences. Direct imitation of Western 
plays was to be shunned, but translation was 
encouraged and assimilation promoted. 
In countries such as Egypt, Syria, Lebanon 
and Iraq, specialist drama magazines were 
started, national or state-supported theatres 
were promoted and national theatre compa- 
nies formed. Artistes were sent abroad for train- 
ing and foreign troupes were warmly welcomed. 
In the universities student drama throve. The 
coming of television brought performers an 
additional source of income which further con- 
solidated their financial and social status. Cul- 
tural co-operation agreements with other coun- 
tries, socialist countries in particular, opened 
important venues for the study of such arts as 
puppetry, ballet, folk dance, music, acting, 
directing and film-making. Altogether, the 
1960s were a time of intense activity in the per- 
forming arts not only in Egypt but practically 
everywhere else in the Arab world. 
Representative figures of the effervescence 
of the 1950s and 1960s included Nu’man 
Ashur, Yusuf Idris, Alfred Farag, Mikhail 
Roman and Mahmoud Dyab, all playwrights 
working in Egypt; Roger Assaf and Nidal 
Ashkar (back from France and England respec- 
tively), Yacoub Shadrawi (back fom Moscow) 
and the Rahbani brothers (pioneers of the 
operetta revival in Lebanon and the Arab 
world) in Lebanon; Saadalla Wannous (back 
from Cairo and Paris) and Rafiq Sabban (back 
fom Paris) in Syria and Yusuf El Ani in Iraq. 
Audience participation 
They all believed in the theatre as a moral and 
political force and shared a determination to 
produce good theatre based on tradition with- 
out being inward-looking. Yusuf Idris led the 
call for “an Egyptian theatre”, arguing that 
most of the plays produced were Egyptianin 
dress, dialogue, characters and situations but 
Western in structure and style. He advocated a 
return to Al Samer, that combination of one- 
man chorus, narrator, entertainer and Shake- 
spearean fool, who worked alone or with one 
assistantand perhaps a dancer, drawing on the 
circle of onlookers around him.

Al Samer, Idris argued, always achieved the- 
atricality, meaning the active participation in 
the action of all the people present, actors and 
audience alike. “If the action involves dancing, all 
must dance; if it involves singing, all must sing. 
Sender and receiver, actor and audience, must 
become one; both sending and receiving”. The 
performance should be based on a text but 
should allow for much improvisation on the 
part of both cast and audience. Breaking through 
the barrier between stage and audience is a feature 
of ancient Egyptian and Mesopotamian rites,

classical Greek theatre, of the age of Shakespeare 
and of course of contemporary European and 
Eastern theatre. Idris knew this but did not 
seck to use audience participation as a mere tech- 
nique or device; he wanted it to perineate the 
whole performance, expressing the collective 
folly, or wisdom, of the community. 
A few years after Idris had put forward his 
theory about Al Samer and put it into prac- 
tice in Al Farafir, Saadalla Wannous (1940- 
1997) published his Manifestos for a New 
Arab Theatre in which he, like Idris, but per- 
haps more forcefully, put the emphasis on the 
public and the relationship between the pub- 
lic and the stage. The ultimate aim of a per- 
formance, he wrote, is to make us “come out 
of our skin, unite in one group, and become 
aware of our common destiny as a group, and 
of the laws governing that destiny.” 
A chaque parfum, une fleur, 
written and directed by 
Rida Drira (Tunisia). Wannous translated his ideas into a play, 
An Evening Entertainment for the Fifth of 
June, that was a major landmark in his career. In 
this play the line between actors and audience 
gradually disappears until the director/actor 
shouts in fear and consternation “what is all 
this leading to? Has the theatre turned into a 
public square or what?” This is exactly what 
Wannous wanted: the theatre turns into a pub- 
lic square regardless of the consequences, which, 
in the play, are the detention by the authorities 
of the entire audience. 
Wannous used the play-within-a-play 
device in several of his later works, often in 
conjunction with the device of the café story 
teller. He explored history simultaneously 
through the eyes of narrators and listeners, 
who are the audience both within and out- 
side the play-within-the play. He wanted to 
generate this kind of dialogue in what he called 
the theatre of politicization, which is in many 
respects both total theatre and theatre as enter- 
tainment. 
Much of what Wannous advocates may 
echo Brecht, Piscator, Peter Brook or Peter 
Weiss, but much of what he practised is also 
reminiscent of the work of the three major 
pioneers, Al Naqqash, Al Qabbani and Sannu’. 
Wannous repeatedly calls on us to turn to 
them since he feels they represent an outward- 
looking approach to theatre. ||

Some people do theatre because it’s their 
job, their craft or their calling. But all 
men and women on Earth are a theatre in 
themselves. It’s second nature to them. 
In every one of us there’s an actor—some- 
one who acts—and a spectator, who watches 
the actor acting. We have the ability to watch 
ourselves doing things. The other animals, 
evenin front of a mirror, don’t recognize their 
own reflection, so don’t use it to improve 
their own appearance. Cats don’t look at them- 
sclves in a mirror to smooth their whiskers 
and lions don’t comb their manes in front of 
one. But we humans, cven without mirrors, 
can watch ourselves watching. 
But we aren’t content, any of us, to be just 
actors and spectators of ourselves. We also 
write our own scripts for every scene we are 
involved in. We are in charge of the wardrobe 
of costumes to be worn wherever we are (at 
home, at work, during time off). Weare also 
the directors who stage our own actions. 
So every human being 1s a miniature theatre 
The “theatre of the oppressed” is based on 
this simple notion of clementary theatre, 
where everyone is involved, whether trained 
for it or not. 
On stage, actors experience passions and 
emotions just as we do in real life. And we, in real 
life, express ideas and feelings through dialogue, 
movements and voice intonations, just like 
actors. With one difference: the actor onstage ts 
aware of using theatrical language whereas we 
use language without this awareness (which 1s 
why we aren’t so good at using it).

### 109546: The Theatre of the oppressed

The conviction that there is an actor in each of us 
is the driving force behind a form of drama that 
seeks to awaken consciences and change lives 
about in the bath. We have all kicked a football 
around our backyards, even if we haven't 
played at Wembley or Maracaiia. 
Some sports engulf entire nations—like 
football in Brazil, baseball in the United States 
and table tennis in China—but only some 
athletes attain excellence. So itis with the the- 
atre. Thereare professionals, but everyone can, 
and should, take part. 
First steps 
The theatre of the oppressed springs from 
these basic ideas. It was born some years ago in 
Brazil and elsewhere in Latin America when 
military dictators first censored plays and 
shows and then cracked down on theatre com- 
panies and actors. 
Atthe time, I was running the Arena The- 
atre of Sio Paulo. They began by telling us 
what plays we should put on. The ones we 
chose were all either banned or censored. Then 
we lost the theatre itself when they forced us 
to make pointless alterations to it which we 
couldn’t afford. 
Each time, we responded by devising new 
kinds of activity. We ended up doing strect 
theatre and staging plays in trade union halls,

schools and churches. We had no money, so we 
had to do without scenery and costumes. We 
acted in ordinary clothes. 
In the end, we lost everything when the 
police banned us from playing anywhere at 
all. It was only then, when we had neither the- 
atre, repertoire, scenery, costumes nor stars, 
that we discovered the essential thing. Face- 
to-face with our audiences, we realized how 
like them we were, and also how different. 
We had lost the rings on our fingers, but 
not our fingers; our costumes but not our 
bodies; our illusions but not our dreams. We 
were like our audiences because we were human 
beings like them. But we were also different 
because we were specialists in a craft. We could 
help the publie make usc of our craft. 
This is how the first version of the Theatre 
of the Oppressed was born. We called it 
“Newspaper Theatre”. We invented and devel- 
oped thirteen ways of turning newspaper arti- 
cles (or any other apparently non-dramatic 
material) into plays. Then we went to our 
audiences to tell them what we’d learned and 
to help them write and produce their own 
plays from texts they chose themselves. 
For the first time, we were teaching our 
public the “means of production” instead of 
presenting them with a finished product. We 
weren't telling them “what to do” but “how 
to do it”. 
After we had set up dozens of popular 
groups, we had to stop because the dictator- 
ship was becoming harsher and harsher. After 
many incidents, I had to leave the country 
myself. 
Fact or fiction? 
The next version of Theatre of the Oppressed 
surfaced in Argentina in 1971 and was called 
“invisible theatre.” The “El Machete” troupe 
that I led put together a play about hunger 
which was to take place, ironically, in a restau- 
rant. The script, a joint effort, was ready and 
the production seemed OK. At first we wanted 
to stage it in the street, but Brazilian friends 
warned us. Argentina was going through a dif- 
ficult transition to democracy and as a Brazil- 
1an, I risked getting deported and handed over 
to the Brazilian police. 
In the end, my actors insisted that I should 
take part in the show. One of them suggested 
doing the play in a restaurant and having the 
actors come in incognito as if they were genuine »

customers and without revealing that it was 
part of a play. I would go in before the others 
and sit at a table in a quiet corner to eat my 
steak. The actors would then come in and the 
various scenes would follow. There was one 
problem though. The play involved two wait- 
ers and a maitre d’hétel who would have tobe 
played by actors. How would the real waiters 
and maitre d’hétel react to that? 
We began the play while the other cus- 
tomers were eating and chatting. To our sur- 
prise and delight, at the very moment the 
actors were supposed to speak, a real waiter 
and the maitre d’hétel himself stepped up to 
say almost exactly the words in our script. 
We were fascinated by this experience where

fiction mingled with reality and became just as 
real, at the same time as reality became a kind 
of fiction. But what worried me was that the 
audience took part in the action without real- 
ising they were in a play which itself was inside 
a piece of reality. So where exactly were they, in 
fiction or reality? For them, how far was fic- 
tion real and reality fictional? 
Spectators on stage 
I continued doing this kind of theatre insev- 
eral countries, always very successfully but 
always with some anxiety and also regret that 
it could not be done in an open manner. 
We entered a new phase in Chaclacayo, Peru, 
where we devised “Forum Theatre” as part of 
the Alfin integrated literacy programme which 
was based on the ideas of Paulo Freire. I was 
promoting literacy through the theatre. Oth- 
ers did it through film, silk-screen printing, 
local languages or Spanish. 
It was here that we first came up with a 
play in which the main character didn’t know 
what he was supposed to do or else made 
wrong or unsuitable decisions. So I asked the 
audience what they would have done instead. 
There was a lot of response. So I suggested 
doing the play again with the same script, with 
the addition that if a member of the audience 
wanted to change something, they could stop 
the play there and then. The person would 
then take over from the actor and instead of

just speaking, could explain his or her idea in 
dramatic form. 
So the audience could use the same stage 
language as the actors to convey what they 
thought, what they wanted and dreamt about, 
and what they proposed. Everyone, freely and 
knowingly, would be “talking theatre”. 
“Forum Theatre” has become the most pop- 
ular version of the Theatre of the Oppressed. At 
the eighth International Festival of the Theatre 
of the Oppressed, recently organized by the 
Mixed Co. in Toronto (Canada), as well as at an 
earlier festival put on in Rio de Janeiro by the 
Centre for the Theatre of the Oppressed there, 
more than thirty countries were represented 
by theatre groups or “professional” users of 
the Theatre of the Oppressed, such as teachers, 
psychotherapists and social workers. 
Internalized oppression 
Later on, in exile in Europe, I came across 
forms of oppression more insidious than 
those in Latin America. My European friends 
told me of the oppression of feeling empty 
inside, of being unable to communicate, of 
being afraid of the future. At first I didn’t 
take these kinds of problems seriously. Then 
I found that the suicide rate in the richest 
countries was far higher than in Latin Amer- 
ica, and understood that if someonc chose 
death rather than loneliness, it was a kind of 
oppression as real as any other. 
 
At the Centre for the Theatre of the 
Oppressed in Paris, over two years, Cecilia 
Thumim and I developed claborate ways of 
expressing internalized oppressions, the ones 
we carry around inside ourselves. As the fif- 
teenth-century Portuguese poet Si de Miranda 
put it, “my biggest enemy is the one inside 
me, the one I carry in the core of my being.” 
When I got back to Brazil, I was elected a 
Vereador (city councillor) in Rio de Janeiro. 
I hired all the staff of my Theatre of the 
Oppressed centre, and throughout my four- 
year term we worked with needy communities 
(favelas), trade unions, schools, neighbour- 
hood associations and old people’s groups, 
landless peasants, black students, street chil- 
dren, Aids sufferers and others to create a sort 
of “legislative theatre”. 
We helped our audiences-cum-playwrights 
to write and produce their own plays, first in 
their own communities and then as part of 
“dialogues” between communities, so that 
everyone could see the oppression others suf- 
fered, and not just their own. Three times a 
year, we put on an outdoor festival to let the 
public know about us and give them a chance 
to take part in our “forum” shows. 
For each show, one of us wrote a proposal 
which was sent to the “city council” where it 
was studied by our lawyers. Sometimes, the 
solution they recomnmended was an approach to 
the mayor’s office or else a street event. Or our

team would drafta law which I would present 
to the real city council. 
An opportunity for dialogue 
In all, we presented about fifty proposed laws, 
all of which came from the grassroots. They 
were about protecting old people, children, 
handicapped people and witnesses to crimes 
(to put an end to impunity, one of the 
scourges of Brazilian society), as well as mea- 
sures against racism and all other forms of dis- 
crimination. 
Thirteen of them were taken up by the 
counciland became laws. So thirteen times we 
managed to make wishes come true, in the 
form of laws now in force all over Rio. 
Why is the Theatre of the Oppressed so 
amazingly successful? First, we don’t try to 
expound a message or a revealed truth, We try 
to ask the right questions instead of giving 
what we think are the right answers. Next, we 
offer a simple system of exercises, games and 
methods which anyone can handle but which 
can also be used for very complicated things 
like psychotherapeutic introspection. Thirdly, 
we create an opportunity for freedom which 
produces dialogue. All of us want to talk with 
people, to know their views and have the 
chance to express our own. 
We know our identity is the result of what 
weare, but also of what others are and of what 
weare not. [ama man because thercare women, 
white because there are black people, a father 
because I have children. Pluralism, differences 
and diversity are at the core of our existence.

So the Theatre of the Oppressed is neither 
aclosed dialogue with itself nor a collection of 
rules and obligations. It’s alanguage. As such, it 
involves all areas of human activity, not just 
politics. It concerns teaching the young, psy- 
chotherapy, literacy and even the theatre itself. 
In 1997, I shall be having a new experience in 
Stratford-upon-Avon in England. With the 
Royal Shakespeare Company and using the 
play Hamlet, we arc going to sec if we can apply 
the psychotherapecutic methods described in 
my book The Rainbow of Desire to helping 
the actors get to grips with their roles. 
This fascinating experiment has a great sym- 
bolic meaning for me. It means official recog- 
nition (for Shakespeare, I don’t know how 
much more official you can get than the Royal 
Shakespeare Company) that the Theatre of 
the Oppressed is truly theatre. [|

World Congress of IT] took place in Seoul from 14 
to 20 September 1997 and included the following 
events: 
) The International Festival of Higher Education 
Theatre Institutes. Eleven international and six 
Korean schools gave performances based on the 
theme “Tradition and Experiment: What does the- 
atre seek to do in the 21st Century?” 
} An International Production of King Lear. 
Planned and organized by ITI/Unesco’s New The- 
atre Project Group, this production of Shake- 
speare’s play featured actors from Hungary, Ger- 
many, Japan, Korea and the United States and 
was staged by the Korean director Jeong-Ok Kim. 
The performances given in Seoul marked the start 
of an international tour.

International 
Activities 
Hl World Theatre Day, 27 March 
World Theatre Day, which was created in 1961, 
is celebrated annually by ITI Centres. Each year a 
noted theatre personality or an outstanding fig- 
ure from another field 1s invited to share his or 
her reflections on theatre and peace between peo- 
ples. This “International Message” 1s translated 
into more than 20 languages, read to spectators 
before performances in theatres throughout the 
world, printed in newspapers and broadcast in 
the audio-visual media. World Theatre Day also 
features events ranging from small-scale demon- 
strations to big popular celebrations. In 
Bangladesh, for example, the entire theatre com- 
munity joins in World Theatre Day celebrations, 
as more than 1,000 actors and actresses parade 
through the streets of Dhaka in theatre costumes. 
Theatre exhibitions are organized, and in the 
evening there is a lecture on theatre in 
Bangladesh and performances by the country’s 
theatre companies. 
HM The Albert Bothol University 
of the Theatre of Nations 
The University of the Theatre of Nations (UTN}), 
which has borne the name of its first director, 
Albert Botbol, since 1993, was founded in Paris 
in 1961 in connecticn with the “Theatre of 
Nations”. Since 1984 the UTN has been itinerant, 
organizing each year with UNESCO's support a 
session on a theme relating to the culture of the 
host country. As a structure for exchanges 
between young professionals all over the world, its 
basic principles are inter-disciplinanty, interna 
tional exchange, encounters between cultures, 
the development of joint projects, the presentation 
of work and mobility of activities. 
HM The Theatre of Nations 
Based in Paris until 1972, the Theatre of Nations 
became an itinerant international festival In 1975. 
The goals 1t pursues are those of quality, plurality 
and diversity in contemporary theatre. Its orga- 
nizers work under the aegis of the ITI National Cen- 
tre of the country in which the event is taking place. 
In September 1997, the “Theatre of Nations 
Seoul-Kyonggl, 1997" included 5 separate but 
interrelated events that took place in Seoul (Rep. 
of Korea) and in the province of Kyongg): the Inter- 
national Theatre Festival (some 15 international 
productions); the BeSeTo (Beijing, Seoul, Tokyo) 
Festival where plays from various Asian countries 
were performed; an Open Arr Theatre Festival 
which presented some twenty productions {10 
international and 10 Korean) on the theme of 
“Nature, human beings, environment”; and the 
Seoul Theatre Festival, which is celebrating its 
twentieth anniversary in 1997.

The eve of a new millennium is an appropriate moment for 
UNESCO and other international organizations to reflect on 
their missions and the challenges that lie ahead. 
Education for all remains the foundation for the achieve- 
ment of sustainable human development. Basic education will 
continue to be an absolute priority, as it forms the essential first 
step towards further learning and plays a critical role in the 
shaping of values and the development of other necessary life 
skills. For this reason we must ensure that we enter the next mil- 
lennium equipped and determined to “reach the unreached”— 
the world’s 850 million adult illiterates and the over 200 million 
children still deprived of the right to education, 
Education means mastering one’s own destiny; it means 
personal sovereignty. It is the key to a genuine participatory 
democracy, which is closely related to development and peace. 
Itis not just about knowledge; it is also about learning to do, 
learning to be and above all learning to live together. Educa- 
tion and teachers have an ethical function that must never be for- 
gotten. In this connection, I should like to insist that while a 
market cconomy may be acceptable, a market society most cer- 
tainly 1s not. What matters is not whether the market is free, but 
whether people are free. 
A continuing process 
Education can no longer be regarded as a one-chance affair. It 
must be seen as a continuing process whereby people are offered 
learning opportunities at a number of times throughout their 
lives. This “lifelong” and “life-wide” education for all demands 
the diversification and expansion of structures, and a better 
linkage between general and vocational education. It also implies 
the development of alternative educational opportunities and 
delivery systems, both formal and informal. 
The role and functions of higher education systems and 
institutions need to be re-examined in the light of the pro- 
found transforinations occurring in socicty today. Too often, 
the model of higher education we see in both the developing and 
industrialized countries involves an acceptance of old, inap-

propriate models that have remained largely impermeable to 
economic, cultural and social needs. We need also to reflect on 
Article 26.1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
which says that “higher education shall be equally accessible 
to all on the basis of merit”, Yes, merit and merit alone must 
be the criterion; and once this criterion is satisfied, there should 
be no limits—of means, age or sex—to access. Higher education 
must be universally available throughout life to all those who 
can benefit from it. 
Secondary education must be treated as a level in its own 
right, not simply a means to placing students at the door of the 
university. Some of the most crucial needs in the educational sys- 
tem as a whole involve summoning individuals of all ages to such 
modestly paid but highly important work as primary and sec- 
ondary school teaching. Secondary education must be recognized 
as pivotal to any education system. 
A new strategy for science education 
Science education isa key component of all education systems. 
The unprecedented growth in scientific knowledge and the dra- 
matically increased complexity of this knowledge, together 
with an ever-increasing demand for high quality, constitute a 
challenge for science educators at all levels. How to introduce sci- 
ence and its breathtaking advances into limited curricula frame- 
works, what should be the correct balance between education 
in the basic sciences and the environment, and the intercon- 
nection of science education with education in technology— 
theseare just some of the questions for which answers need to 
be found. Science education can, of course, only be satisfac- 
tory if account is taken of the cultural background and ethical 
implications of scientific progress. 
The universities bear the great intellectual responsibility of 
identifying new strategies to promote science education and 
science teacher training, as well as setting and maintaining high 
professional standards in education for scientific research. Intro- 
ducing new information technologies in science education, 
updating basic and specialized university courses, as well as

modernizing university laboratories remain a pressing need 
and a challenge for inter-university co-operation at the national, 
regional and international levels. 
Action needs to be taken to build university science educa- 
tionin the developing and least developed countries. I am con- 
fident that the world scientific community would gladly com- 
mit itself to such action. UNESCO will spare no efforts in 
developing North-South co-operation via inter-university net- 
works—as in the UNITWIN and UNESCO Chairs programme. 
I believe that UNESCO and the Third World Academy of Sciences 
are natural partners in such an endeavour. 
Science today is at a turning point. All countries are having 
to face important decisions in this field. The richer nations are 
being required to rethink their science and technology priori- 
ties in the face of economic constraints and new political and cth- 
ica] challenges, whilst developing countries are striving to build 
up the critical capacity necessary for effective science teaching and 
research leading to sustainable development. 
If science alone is not capable of responding to people’s aspi- 
rations for a better life, it has shown itself to be one of the major 
driving forces behind development. And yet this fact and its 
implications are still underestimated by decision-makers and 
politicians secking short-term success and benefits. Short-ter- 
mism in policy-making naturally involves dangers for the basic 
sciences. I believe thata healthy, productive scientific community 
is dependent upon the pursuit of basic research. We must ensure 
that the basic sciences are pursued by all nations, and that the com- 
mon stock of fundamental knowledge is shared by all. 
Haves and have-nots 
Another feature of the sciences today is the continuing asym- 
metry in the distribution of scientific research capacity world- 
wide. The developing countries are responsible for a mere 10 per 
cent of research and development, whilst the member coun- 
tries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and 
Development (OECD) can claim 85 per cent. The world is still 
divided between the haves and the have-nots. 


### 109548: Science education and sustainable development

Each country’s capacity to move towards sustainable human 
development depends on the existence of a critical mass of 
skilled human resources in the many scientific, technical and pro- 
fessional fields needed for addressing complex environment, 
resources and development issues. Training of the right kind and 
number of scientists, experts, technicians and educational per- 
sonnel is urgently needed. UNESCO has highlighted a number 
of key problems within the context of the vicious circle of low 
human and capital investment/low productive returns in which 
so many developing countries are locked. 
The first of these problems concerns the lack of “critical 
mass” at national evel. Despite considerable efforts, many 
developing countries do not yet have sufficient trained per- 
sonnel for sustainable development of their natural resources 
and suffer from a shortage of training facilities, especially for 
preparing teams of specialists to conduct studies and research 
useful for decision-making. The second problem is that estab- 
lished institutions and programmes may be of limited rele- 
vance to local conditions, with the result that many trainees in 
the developing world receive an education that has little bear- 
ing on their countries’ social and economic needs. A third prob- 
lem is lack of continuity. Students who return home with 
skills inappropriate to their countries’ needs often end up aban- 
doning their professional fields for other pursuits, such as 
business or government. 
Another challenge for developing and industrialized coun- 
trics alike 1s that nature does not respect the frontiers of scien- 
tific disciplines. Interdisciplinarity is required to study nat- 
ural phenomena in all their complexity. And yet most current 
training programmes are sectoral or disciplinary and do not 
address the complex interactions between people, resources, 
environment and development. 
All UNESCO’s intergovernmental scientific programmes 
dealing with freshwater, oceanography, coastal and marine sci- 
ences, the carth sciences, and particularly land resources include 
a major component on training precisely oriented in this direc- 
tion. The goal of the recently launched UNEsco-Cousteau 
ccotechnology programme is to identify, promote, and mul- 
tiply transdisciplinary university efforts through financial 
assistance and networking and through the establishment of 
UNEsco-Cousteau Ecotechnology Chairs. Here, one of the 
basic tasks is to ensure that in villages and municipalities there 
are people with the knowledge and motivation to prescribe 
and perform all the “ccojobs” that are vital to the safeguarding 
of our environment. 
Water and food security 
Access to water 1s considered a basic human right, but ts there— 
and will there be——cnough water to go round in future? Can 
water be considered a free commodity which is available in 
unlimited quantities? The answer has to be no. Clearly, fresh 
water 1s—although renewable—a very limited and vulnerable 
resource. In my view water is going to be onc of the major 
issues of the twenty-first century. We need to practise greater 
sharing of knowledge and resources in this field. My dream is 
to see the channelling of water from places where it is plentiful 
to others where it is scarce, together with the promotion 
through education of new attitudes to water, awareness of how 
precious a shared commodity it is. 
The issue of food security will be ever-present in the first 
decades of the new century. The application of sound scien- 
tific knowledge will be an important factor in attaining sus- 
tainable food production, based on enhanced agricultural pro- 
ductivity, the conservation and management of natural 
resources, the protection of the environment, and the stabi- 
lization of world population. But once again the solution will 
be ethical—the greater sharing of knowledge and resources. 
We must work together at the international and national lev- 
els to achieve a consensus among governments, the scientific 
community and the public at large on the importance and the role 
of science for the development of societies and the well-being of 
humankind. Only in this way can a solid foundation be laid for 
sustainable and equitable human development. |

For many people scaweeds 
are simply plants that grow 
in water. This was the accepted 
definition until the eighteenth cen- 
tury. They were regarded as “not 
proper plants” because they had 
neither flowers nor seeds. Today, 
this definition is out of date. A sca- 
weed or alga may be either veg- 
etable or animal, thrive in water or 
on land and interest zoologists as 
much as botanists. 
Until the end of the 1950s, 
explains Brono de Reviers, senior 
lecturer at Franee’s Natural His- 
tory Museum, scientists nsunally 
classified living things as either aui- 
mal or vegetable. Seaweeds are in 
fact both. Says Reviers: “Sca- 
weeds aven’t simple, they've a bun- 
dle of organisms drawn from very 
different gronps, sometimes quite 
philogenetically distant, that is, 
without direct links.” 
The overall view of the world 
of living things is changing very 
quickly. The vegetable kingdom 
was traditionally divided into thal- 
lophytes and cormophytes. The

former (from the Greek word for a 
shoot, thallos) are “simple” (some- 
times called “inferior”) vegetation, 
without stems, leaves, roots or vein 
systems. They included seaweed, 
mushrooms, lichens, mosses and 
even bacteria. Cormophytes (from 
the Greek for stem, kormos) have 
stems, roots and lowers. 
So how were vegetables distin- 
guished from animals? By the abil- 
ity of animals to move, something 
vegetables cannot do. But things get 
complicated when some animals, 
like sea anemones or coral, stay iu 
one spot, while some microscopic 
seaweeds move about, like Spir- 
ulina (a blue scaweed) ov diatoms 
(brown planktonic seaweed). 
Another difference is that veg- 
etables synthesize living matter by 
using the energy of light through 
pliotosynthesis, while animals trap 
and eat prey. But like earnivorous 
plants, some scaweeds ean trap 
prey too and [eed off organic mate- 
rial as well. To cover this com- 
plexity, biologists now offer five or

Estimates range from 20,000 to

mosses, and between dinophyte

The common ancestors of some 
sreen seaweeds gradually emerge 
from the water and adapt to life 
in air. Oddly, some later return to 
living under water. Eel grass, for 
example, which serves as a nurs- 
ery for young fish, actually flow- 
ers and reproduces through seeds. 
Like seaweed it can take in nutvi- 
tion directly through its leaves, 
instead of its roots. 
Brown seaweeds are microscopic 
like diatoms or huge like giant 
kelps, which grow to a length of 50 
metres or more. They are found 
anywhere from the snrface to 150 
metres down. Dinoflagelates are 
single-cell organisms which form 
“red seas” and can seerete poisons.

Unesco Courter, October 1997). 
THE USES OF SEAWEED 
Alvaro Isvael, of the Israeli 
National Institute in Haifa, has 
identified 107 types and 493 vari- 
eties of seaweed used by hnman 
beings. Most are grown and con- 
sumed in the Far East and the 
Pacifie in accordance with long tra- 
ditions. In Korea, for example, 
brown seaweed was found in the 
10,000-year-old remains of meals 
in tombs at the Kiong-Lu burial 
gronnds. In fourth-centuvy Japan, 
the imperial court taxed the con- 
sumption of nori (Porphyra), 
  
a A See 
wakame (Undaria) and konbu 
(Laminaria). Since then, the 
national dish of sushi (rice and raw 
fish) has been seryed with nori. 
In the West, famine in the fif- 
teenth century led people to cat 
seaweed, which is why it was dis- 
dained for so long in this pact of the 
world. The Chinese eat the most 
seaweed these days—20 kg a head 
every year—[ollowed by the Kore- 
ans and the Japanese, with 13.4 
kg. About 60 varieties of hrown and 
red seaweed are eaten in the forms 
of vegetables, pité, jam, soup, 
bread or beverages. In the Pacific, 
delicious little “grapes” of caulerpa 
are served up as salads, 
At the Seaweed Rescareh and 
Des clopment Centre (CEVA), part 
of the French Researel Institute 
for the Use of the Sea (IFREMER), 
Joel Fleurenee is looking into the 
nutritional value of seaweeds. 
“Their make-up,” he says, “varies 
according to the species, the sea- 
son, the surroundings, and geo- 
graphical and physiological factors.” 
Edible seaweeds are mostly 
made up of carbohydrates—com- 
plex sugars and dietary fibres. 
Brown seaweeds contain the least 
protein—from 5 to 15% of their 
dry weight—but red seaweeds like 
Palmaria and Porphyra tenera 
have about 47% and rival soya 
(35%). They ave very low in [ats 
and contain mineral salts and trace 
elements suel as magnesium, 
arsenie, copper, lithinm, sulphur 
and zine. They also have a full range 
of vitamins, especially vitamin A,

» lack of which can lead to blindness. 
Unfortunately they tend to disap- 
pear with drying or cooking, par- 
ticularly vitamin C. 
From seaweed, industry gets 
alginates and earrageens, valuable 
additives which feature in much 
of our food, for example, stabiliz- 
ing sauces and making dairy prod- 
ucts ereamy. They hide behind the 
European Union code names of 
E400 to 407. 
ENDLESS POSSIBILITIES 
But not just any seaweed can be 
harvested, any time or anywhere, 
since seaweeds easily absorb pol- 
lutants like mercury. They are 
increasingly being cultivated in 
specially ehosen and protected 
places. In Asia, the 530,000 
hectares of scaweeds farmed by 
250,000 family businesses provide 
950,000 jobs. According to the 
Food and Agriculture Organiza- 
tion of the United Nations (FAO), 
7,637,000 tonnes of fresh seaweed 
were harvested in 1991, 90% of it 
cultivated. 
The uses of seaweed seem end- 
less. Do you want to make cherries 
without cherry flesh? Make your 
plants grow? Mop up urine in 
babies’ nappies? Have waterproof 
umbrellas or mackintoshes? Make 
plastic {floors and wood shine with- 
out polishing them? Make dental 
impressions without risk of burning 
the patient? Have photographie 
film where the gelatine doesn’t 
melt in the heat? Or put out forest 
fires by dropping thiek chemicals 
from firefighting planes? Biologists 
think a lot more research should 
be done into seaweed, especially 
for food purposes, when the world 
is going hungry and seaweed is 
everywhere. Rn

PROTECTING THE SOUTH PACIFIC 
Fifteen countries and territories in the South 
Pacific have joined forces to develop and 
implement a 1997-2000 Action Plan to pro- 
leet their environment. They ave parties to 
the Agreement Establishing the South 
Pacific Regional Environment Programme 
(SPREP), whieh was opened for signature 
in 1993 and came into effect in 1995. SPRED, 
which has existed as a distinet entity since 
1982, now has the status of an autonomous 
mtergovernmental organization. 
“Threats to the environment of the South 
Pacific are an integral part of global concern 
for environmental protection and sustainable 
development,” the Plan states. “International 
agreements and action programmes, inelud- 
ing Agenda 21, the Barbados Programme of 
Action on the Sustainable Development of 
Small Island Developing States, the Cairo 
Programme of Action on Population and 
Development, and conventions on climate 
change, biodiversity, ocean management and 
pollution, provide an important framework 
for regional action.” 
Besides facing the adverse effects of cli- 
mate change, these Pacific island countries 
share problems of waste disposal and pollu- 
tion prevention, Population growth, espe- 
ciallyin urban centres, is putting increasing 
pressure on them, Disposal of solid waste is 
a particularly acute problem on very small 
islands, where reeyeling is often not ceo- 
nomical and landfill is the method generally 
used. A range of liquid wastes risks polluting 
freshwater systems and groundwater in the 
region. Problems associated with the man- 
agement of toxie substances sueh as pesti- 
cides and heavy metals are also giving risc to 
concern. The Waigani Convention aims to ban 
the import into all island member countries 
of the South Pacific Forum (with the exeep- 
tion of Australia and New Zealand) of haz- 
ardous and radioactive waste, and to control 
the transboundary movement and manage- 
ment of hazardous waste within the South 
Pacifie Region. 
In addition to a monitoring role, the 
SPREY Sceretariat is involved in public 
awareness and training activities. Tt promotes 
the inclusion of environmental issues into 
school curricula and the publication of mate- 
rialsinlocal languages. Supported hy donors, 
including several United Nations agencies, the 
World Bank, governments and non-govern- 
mental organizations, SPRED has an annual 
budget of approximately $7 million. But 
Pacific states complain they attract little oult- 
side attention. Much needs to be done to guar- 
antee the futnre of these islands where 65 
per eent of the population is under 23. I

AIRCRAFT 
AND THE OZONE LAYER 
In the 1960s, before chlorofluorocar- 
bons (CFCs) were suspected of destroy- 
Ing the ozone layer, there were fears that 
it could be harmed by fleets of super- 
sonic jets. These fears have resurfaced 
inthe wake of a recent study by the US 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Admin- 
istration in Boulder (Colorado), which 
has revealed that exhaust produced by 
the Concorde supersonic aircraft con- 
tains a large quantity of sulphuric acid, 
the particles of which serve as carriers 
for the chlonne pollutants that destroy 
ozone. - 
GAS TO THE RESCUE 
A filling station with a capacity to fill 14 
million bottles a year with butane gas 
(65,000 tonnes) was opened in March 
1997 in Mbao, a suburb of Dakar (Sene- 
gal). Since a “butanization” campaign 
was launched in 1974, household use of 
butane increased from 10% in 1982 to 
27%in 1992, anse which 1s partly due to 
a 40% drop in the sale price of bottles. 
Butane use enables Senegal to save 
70,000 tonnes of wood and 20,000 
tonnes of charcoal annually, thus help 
Ing to reduce the pressure on forests 
as a firewood source, n

by Coal India Ltd., one of the world's 
biggest coal companies, will come from 
the International Development Associa

RESPECT FOR THE SEA 
The Aquarium of La Rochelle (France) and 
the Nicolas Hulot Foundation for Nature 
and Humanity (formerly known as the 
Ushuaia Foundation) teamed up with the 
European Blue Flag (for clean beaches) in 
June 1997 to launch an operation called 
“The sea is not adustbin” in two depart- 
ments on France's Atlantic coast. Twelve 
thousand young people received an edu- 
cational pamphlet informing them about 
the fragile ecological balance of the manne 
environment, The operation was particu- 
larly urgent since In 1995 the Aquarium’s 
study centre for sea turtles recorded an 
abnormally high number of leatherback 
turtles washed up on beaches. Autop- 
stes revealed that most of them had died 
from swallowing plastic bags, perhaps 
mistaking them for jellyfish. ™ 
BAD BUZZ FOR BEES 
Experts estimate that 90% of wild bee 
colonies have been decimated in the last 
few decades as a result of harsh win- 
ters, wet springs, the massive use of 
pesticides, and two vaneties of micro- 
scopic mites which suck the bees’ 
blood. One mite settles inside the bee's 
respiratory tube, and the other, an exter- 
nal parasite which originated in Asia, 
attacks chrysalises, larvae and adults, 
causing major deformities that prevent 
the insect from fulfilling its vital func- 
tions. Wild bees play an important role in 
pollinating plants. What if they became 
extinct?

THE UNESCO Gouner 8 NOVEMBER 1997 
  
 
The world’s first iron bridge, built in 1779 
across England's River Severn, came to epitomize the genesis of 
industrialization based on iron and coal 
... If an atheist who had never 
heard of Coalbrookdale could be 
transported there in a dream, and 
left to awake at the mouth of one 
of those furnaces, surrounded on 
all sides by such a number of infer- 
nal objects, though he had heen all 
his life the most profligate unbe- 
liever that ever added blasphemy 
to incredulity, he would infallibly 
tremble at the last judgement that in 
imagination would appear to him. 
With these apocalyptic words, 
written in 1801, the dramatist and 
traveller Charles Dibdin concluded 
his observations on the Severn Gorge 
in Shropshire, in the Midlands of 
England. What drew Dibdin and 
numerous other travellers there in 
the late eighteenth and early nine- 
teenth centuries was the remark- 
  
able concentration of industrial 
activity, concerned in the main with 
ironmaking, spread along some five 
kilometres of the valley of the River 
Severn. Today this area, known as 
the Ironbridge Gorge, is a World 
Heritage Site in recognition of its 
outstanding importance in the early 
development of industrialization. 
THE DARBYS OF COALBROOKDALE 
The initial importance of the Sev- 
ern Gorge stems {rom the pioneering 
work of the Quaker ironmaster Abra- 
ham Darby (1678-1717) who in 
1709 developed a technique for 
smelting iron using coked coal as a 
fuelinstead of the charcoal—made 
from wood—which was convention- 
ally used at the time. 1le had taken 
over an existing charcoal-lired blast 
furnace built about 1638—in Coal- 
brookdale, a small side valley of the 
River Severn, and using local coal 
converted into coke hie was suceess- 
fnlin smelting iro  ore to form a use- 
able iron. 
Although the impact of this new 
technology was limited at first, per- 
taps because there was little price 
advantage in coke-smelted iron, hy 
the middle years of the eighteenth 
century Coalbrookdale and the sur- 
rounding area, by then in the hands 
of the second Abraham Darby 
(1711-63), had become an impor- 
tant source of good quality iron. 
By using ceked coal as fuel ivon- 
masters were freed [rom the restrie- 
tions imposed by limited supplies of 
timber for charcoal. Already, by 
1700, Britain had less forest cover

than any other European state, as a 
result of elearanee for agriculture, 
cntting for charcoal and the 
demands of the Navy for ship- 
building. But coal was available in 
virtually unlimited quantities; and 
with coke as a uel, blast [uirnaees 
could be built bigger, thus allow- 
ing larger eastings to be made. Coke 
smelting was to beeome almost uni- 
versalin the early years of the nine- 
teenth century. 
THE WORLD'S FIRSTIRON BRIDGE 
During the eighteenth century the 
Coalbrookdale Company became 
renowned not only for the making 
of iron but for using irouin new an 
innovative ways, [Tere the first iron 
rails were made along which ran 
trucks with iron wheels, pushed by 
men or pulled by horses, carrying 
iron goods down to wharves on the 
river. Then in the 1770s came the 
most dramatic and spectacular new 
use for iron, in the building of the 
workl’s irstiron bridge. 
The River Severn, Englands 
longest river, was one of the keys to 
the suceess of the Coalbrookdale 
area. It provided ready access to ont- 
stde markets for the products of the 
iron foundries and forges, for coal 
aud elay from loeal pits, and for 
bricks, tiles and pottery. But the 
Severn also presented a barrier to 
the movement of goods by road from 
one side of the gorge to the other. 
The need for a bridge resulted in 
the novel proposal to build one of 
iron. Under the supervision of the 
third Abraham Darby (1750-89), 
thenin charge of the Coalbrookdale 
Company, the bridge was cast and 
erected in the summer of 1779. It 
was opened ou New Years Day 
1781, the first large-seale use of iron 
for structural purposes in the world 
and a remarkable demonstration of 
the utility and versatility of iron [or 
construction. With a span of 30 
metres, the graceful semi-circular 
arch reached across the gorge of the 
Severn at its navrowest point, an ele- 
gant centrepiece for what the cotton 
master Charles TTulbert was to call 
in 1837 “the most extraordinary dis- 
trict in the world”. 
As a river crossing and as a sin- 
gular example of new engineering 
the Tron Bridge was an immediate 
success but its symbolic significance 
was much greater, not only in 
Britain but throughout Europe and 
in the United States. It epitomized 
the birth of a new era in humar his- 
tory in which industrial technolo- 
gies were to provide immeasurable 
opportunities. 
Even before the construetion of 
the Iron Bridge the valley of the 
River Severn around Coalbrookdale 
was already becoming a magnet for all 
who wished to see the the birth of 
industrialization based on iron and 
coal. Many visitors from overseas eame 
to see the furnaces and forges of the 
iron industry, coal pits and pumping 
engines, the eanal with its celebrated 
inclined plane down which boats 
could pass to the Severn, the famous 
china works at Coalport and the Tar 
Tunnelnearby [rom which oozed nat- 
ural bitnmen used for waterprooling 
and medicinal purposes. 
The gorge exereised a peculiar 
fascination on artists too. [Tere the 
combination of topography—the 
River Severn flowing through its 
precipitous gorge—and the smoke 
and flames of the [urnaces and 
forges conspired to produce a seene 
at once picturesque and sublime. 
But one view above all others epit- 
omizes the artist’s vision of the new 
industrial Britain. Tt has become 
the archetypal description of the 
(irst industrial nation. Coalbrook- 
dale by Night, painted in 1801, is 
the work of Philippe Jacques de 
Loutherbourg (1740-1812). In 1t,

DERELICTION AND DECAY 
Throughout the nineteenth century 
industry thrived in the Ironbridge 
Gorge, as it was to become known, 
but its unique contribution was 
largely over. Other, better located, 
industrial areas overtook it in scale 
and influence. As canals and later 
railways linked the growing indus- 
trial regions of Britain to ports like 
London, Liverpool and Glasgow, 
Coalbrookdale became bypassed. 
By the beginning of the twenti- 
eth century the Ironbridge Gorge 
was in decline. The Coalport China 
Works closed in 1926, production 
having moved to the Potteries of 
Staffordshire, but the foundries in 
Coalbrookdale remained, as they 
do today. The last of the tile works 
in the Gorge, where from the 1870s 
decorative floor and wall tiles had 
been made from loeal clay, closed in 
THE UNLSCO Gourier B NOVEMBIR 1997 
1969. Dereliction and decay were 
the features that characterized the 
gorge. Cottages once oecupied by 
workers in the iron, pottery or tile 
faetories lay empty, shops closed 
as people moved away to find work 
elsewhere. To the north the area of 
the old East Shropshire coalfield 
was similarly in decline. The last 
pit closed in 1979. 
But the distinguished industrial 
history of the Ironbridge Gorge was 
never forgotten, Writing in 1955 
Michael Rix (1913-81), an archi- 
tectural historian, referred exten- 
sively to the importance of the area 
and its monuments and nsed for the 
first time in print the term “indus- 
trial arehacology” to describe their 
significance. In 1964, in the third 
issue of the Journal of Industrial 
Archaeology he made an impas- 
sioned plea for the establishment 
of “national parks” of industrial 
archaeology stating that the “Iron- 
bridge Gorge is a prime candidate 
for sucha designation”.

group, had excavated the Old Fur- 
nace and opened a small museum 
in 1959 to commemorate the 250th 
anniversary of Darby's smelting of 
iron with coke. And a growing num- 
ber of those with an interest in 
industrial archaeology made pil- 
srimages to see the extensive 
remains, still surviving, of this pio- 
neer industrial site. 
The years of industrial and 
urban renewal after the Second 
World War saw the sweeping away 
of much of the evidence of Britain 
as an early industrial nation hut this 
destruction, inevitable as it was, led 
to a growing recognition that the 
archaeological evidence of the age 
in which we still lived—the indus- 
trial age—was disappearing too. 
Efforts began all over the country to 
record or preserve the archaeology 
of the Industrial Revolution. 
Such was the extent of the 
decline in and around the Iron- 
bridge Gorge and the area immedi- 
ately to the north that it was des- 
ignated as a New Town, making it 
eligible for special funding from 
government. Under the terms of the 
New Towns Act of 1946 new com- 
munities were established in many

parts of England, initially on green 
field sites, in order to accommodate 
the growing populations of great 
conurbations like London, Birm- 
ingham and Manchester. Under the 
same legislative provisions a second 
generation of new towns was ere- 
ated with the same aims but 
located in areas of industrial decay, 
high unemployment and social 
deprivation. 
The old East Shropshire Coal- 
field became one of these new 
towns. The objective was to renew 
the worn-out infrastructure, build 
new houses, and encourage new 
industry to bring jobs to the area. 
The boundaries of the new town of 
Telford, named, appropriately, 
after the great civil engineer 
Thomas Telford who had estab- 
lished his early repntation in Shrop- 
shire in the 1780s, were specifically 
defined so that the Ironbridge 
Gorge was included in recognition of 
its historical and archaeological 
importance and amenity potential. 
The 
spelled the extinetion of the indus- 
new town could have 
trial archaeology of the Ironbridge 
Gorge. But from the outset enlight- 
ened planning and informed diree- 
tion and management of the new 
town development corporation 
ensured that proper recognition was 
accorded to the most important 
sites and monuments. It was Telford 
Development Corporation that took 
the lead in establishing the Iron- 
bridge Gorge Museum Trust, 
charged with the daunting task of 
preserving and prescuting to the 
public the evidence of early indus- 
try in the Gorge. 
The Trust was formed in 1968 
and within three years was engaged 
on a major programme of conserva- 
tion and interpretation. Most of the 
physical requirements of the Gorge 
have been met. The whole of the 
valley has been designated as a Con- 
servation Area, and there are now 
some 300 buildings listed as being 
of architectural and historical 
importance. 
With the demise of Telford 
Development Corporation, its work 
of creating the new town substan- 
tially complete, one element of man- 
agement and control has gone. The 
Corporation’ support for the 
Musenm Trust has gone too, to be 
replaced by a government endow- 
ment. Proper international recog- 
nition came with the designation of 
the Gorge as a World Ileritage Site 
in 1986, the first area of industrial 
stgnilicance to be so listed. 
Places like the Ironbridge Gorge, 
by virtue of their renown and the 
recognition that comes with it suffer 
peculiar forms of stress. Visitors in 
particular are an inescapable con- 
sequence of fame. They place stress 
on communities and on the fabric of 
historic environments. There is some- 
thing slightly obscene about places 
that are monuments to work being 
given over to pleasure. But visitors 
have rights and demand access. If 
the Ironbridge Gorge is to take its 
rightful place as one of the great 
monuments to human endeavour 
then it needs all the attentive care 
and thoughtful respect that we can 
bestow. nH

interview 
Lebanese-born poet, novelist 
and playwright Andrée Chedid 
has published over thirty books 
including (in English 
translation) Selected Poems 
(1996), Multiple Child (1995) 
and From Sleep Unbound 
(1987). From her standpoint at 
the crossroads of several 
cultures she is an alert observer 
of the tensions and divisions 
of the modern world. In this 
interview with Martine Leca, she 
voices her commitment to 
freedom in direct, simple 
terms.

BH You often take the themes of your novels from 
the Bible... .. 
Andrée Chedid: When they coineide with topical 
issues. If Lonly took ny ideas from current events 
their range might be limited and they would fail 
to achieve a universal dimension, By bringing 
together the present and the distant past, myths 
are universal and open np avenues for exploring 
all the facets of human nature. When yon 
immerse yourself in enrrent affairs, yon get ear- 
ried away on the tide of events. Our inner life 
suffers if our eyes are glued to what is going on 
around us, whereas myth makes us step back. 
HW According to you, the world would be a more 
tolerant place if it were ruled by women. 
A. C.: A good question. Guided hy their maternal 
instinet, women would probably be less naturally 
inclined to resort to physieal violence. But every- 
one tends to be corrupted by power, and women are 
no exeeption. Would women continue to be peace- 
loving if they were in power? The common good can 
only be based on equitable power-sharing between 
the sexes, not by denying part of humanity. 
BH You know a lot about Middle Eastern women. 
How would you define their status? 
A.C.: Women in the Middle East are caught up in 
a tide that ebbs and flows. They hecome the 
beneficiaries of certain social changes, and then, 
lo and behold, just when they are starting to 
adjust to these changes, along comes a connter- 
current that makes society move backwards.

‘Aninner 
freedom 
Some kinds of freedom appeared in Middle East- 
ern countries, hut they ebbed away as a result of 
fundamentalist obscurantism. When I was young, 
I thought the world was moving steadily forward 
in a straight line. But there are slow-downs and 
U-turns. I believe that human destiny is subjeet 
to cyelieal movements of this kind. This does not 
mean that we should stop looking towards the 
future, towards progress. My novel Les marches 
de sable, for example, explores the innermost 
fears, the hopes and the retreats—as well as the 
ideological and theological struggles—that mark 
these cyeles. Whereas religion should ennoble 
us, take us out of ourselves and make us more 
humane, it can build walls between people. 
HM You always try to steer clear of ideologies and 
conventions. 
A. C.: Yes, as far as possible. I base my life on 
the word freedom. I don’t like Deing kept on a 
lead. But this calls for eternal vigilance because 
life is full of traps of which we are unaware—con- 
ventionality, unserupulous ambition, age, tak- 
ing oneself too seriously. I try to elude all labels 
and, of course, classification arising from my ori- 
gins and culture. Age is a label—one is old or 
oneis young. Other labels are blood, gender and 
soil. I distrust anything that confines a person 
to a specific station in life. There is something in 
us that is so much larger, a sort of flame, aninner 
freedom that defies definition. This indefinable 
quality must constantly he reconsidered and

renamed. Thatis what I try to examine through 
poetry, the form of expression I cherish the most. 
BW One recurrent theme in your books is coming 
and going between the city and the desert and vice 
versa. 
A. C.: That is an unending process that my char- 
acters are pushed into by their instinet. Cities 
for me mean freedom; they are places where peo- 
ple can eseape from themselves and their hack- 
ground. City life allows people to blend in with the 
population, with others, without being chained to 
them. If lived in a village, I would feel that 1 
belonged theve; I wouldnt experience this self- 
deliverance that the solitude of city life affords 
we, City life makes it possible to expand, to he 
with other people within minutes and to talk to 
them in the midst of a crowd. You can walk in 
the city without being disturbed. And poetry is all 
around you, You just have to stop and observe, 
BW What about the desert? 
A.C: 1s a place where yowean make a fresh start 
after you've been through some kind of ordeal. 
It’s a place for putting things together, for con- 
templation and simplicity. For dropping your 
guard, It’s a form of training in asceticism and 
endurance, and a kind of filter. My characters go 
into the desert to liek their moral wounds. Anas- 
tasia, for example, the heroine of Les marches de 
sable, thinks only of emerging [rom this ordeal in 
the desert, the crossing of which has purified and 
strengthened her, Bat the teaching of the desert 
is sterile ilitis not taken back to the city. After the 
desert, one has to return to the human world. lt is 
also important to listen to the desert in oneself, It 
helps to take the sting out of death, to greet it 
every day as an inevitable companion, so that we can 
exorcise it and welcome it when the time comes. Fs 
itupossible to see life clearly unless one has thought 
about death at an early age. Deathis a certainty— 
onr only certainty—and a scale of values, What 
comes after, [don’t know. 
HM Is your work a quest for continuity? 
A.C: My work is a step forward in this world, not 
in the hereafter. It is this side of our existence 
that concerns me. We keep on asking ourselves 
the same questions—where have we eome from? 
where are we going? —and no philosopher, sei- 
entist or poet has ever answered them satisflac- 
torily. I am amazed every day that I exist as a 
physical being through this combination of mol- 
ecules that Lam made of. I'm not talking about 
beauty, make-up or appearance. I wonder how 
this factory of being with all its complicated 
mechanisms has managed to take shape. This 
Through writing 
we bring together our body 
and our mind 
extraordinary mystery is enough for me, That is 
why I don’t try to pievee the mysteries of the 
after-life, of the beyond. 
IW Is your whole life built around writing? 
A. C.: For me writing and life are inseparable. 
Writing enriches life. But I'm not a metronome; 
l can get by for a while without writing, The ges- 
tation of a book, for example, calls for a Tot of 
thought and imagination. Something builds up 
inside me, and ink then traces on paper the 
course of its dey elopment. But the desire to write 
never leaves me. It is always there, coiled up 
inside ne, and if alter a while no writing appears, 
I start to feel rather uncomfortable, because my 
life 1s no longer harmonious. For me, writing is 
like the act of love, which amplifies, sublimates 
life and gives ita luminous tension. It puts mein 
step with this inner vibration, this desire that 1 
feel deep within me. Without it, purely mater- 
ial life is incomplete. 
IW Isn't it self-centred, this act of love you describe 
as part of writing? 
A. C.: Writing, when compared to the work of a 
Mother Teresa or a great doctor, to the suffering 
they alleviate and the difficulties they face, can 
sometimes seem lightweight and facile, almost 
like fun. But as the French philosopher Gaston 
Buchelard wrote, we are “real and unreal”, and 
if we do not combine the real and the unreal, we 
are traumatized because we are incomplete. 
Through writing we bring together our body and 
our mind. Poctry is an act of love, and love gives 
you inspiration. This is not just love between a 
man and a woman, but universal love. When [go 
out inte the street, when I mingle with the 
crowds, [love others. [observe them. I immerse 
myself in them, The erowd is the elay from which 
I'mould my poems and novels. All these fleeting 
moments with others nourish life, the foree with- 
out which we would sink into the void that lies 
in wait [or us.

### 109551: Interview with Andrée Chedid

» BM You have restored a sense of poetry to the novel. 
A. C.: Poetry is asking questions at the deepest 
level, an attempt to get to the bottom of things. 
The act of writing is a moment of purification, 
deployment and self-condensation during which 
the writer is balanced on a thin wire strung 
between alpha and omega. It is a moment to ask 
questions about the purpose and the essence of 
things. I feel very close to the Japanese poets 
who write haiku, those formal seventeen-syllable 
poems where the radiance of the essential flows 
through the ink. I like to write briefly and sue- 
einctly. A poem of a few lines often results from 
a long ehain of questioning and reflection that 
may last several days. 
BM What form does all this take in your daily work? 
A.C.: Alhiny novels have a poetic texture. The raw 
matcrialis a block of rough, shapeless clay that 1 
work on until I’ve found the formula. The first 
draft is always a sketch which is virtually illegible, 
except to me. Then the characters emerge from 
the rough matter, and their destiny takes shape. 
I don’t start methodically, with a prearranged 
plan. At first I let things flow along and take their 
course. Then I go hack to what I’ve written and 
look very elosely at the words that will have to be 
cut, tightened or straightened out. I look at the 
text much more eritically at this stage. I search for 
the right word. Craftsmanship starts after visu- 
alization of the idea: I work on the rhythm, the 
music. [t’s a process of question-and-answer that 
goes on day after day. |
