DIPTYCH WITH TRANSPARENCIES 
1996, acrylic on canvas (height 73 cm, width 1.20 m) 
by Jean-André Martin 
  
Much of this artist's output consists of assemblages of several canvases. In each part of the diptych shown here, he notes that “the overlapping colours create 
impressions of transparency in a work aspiring to symbolize the enrichment that accrues from encounters of all kinds.”

by Bahgat Elnadi and Adel Rifaat 
Does medicine treat patients or combat illness? Are patients 
completely autonomous individuals or do they form part of a 
natural, social and cosmic environment? Is illness caused simply by the 
intrusion into the body of an outside agent—a virus or a demon?—or is 
it the sign of an imbalance, a disrupted harmony which the body tries to 
rectify, where necessary with medical assistance? What role should be 
played in treatment by knowledge that can be acquired, codified and 
taught, as opposed to hands-on experience arising from direct contact 
between practitioner and patient? 
These are some of the many questions raised in the present issue. Our 
contributors, who come from different cultural backgrounds, do not 
claim to offer hard and fast answers. Instead they put these issues in the 
different—sometimes very different—perspectives of their respective 
traditions and doctrines, composing a panoramic picture of medical 
practice in which knowledge and faith, the culture of the community and 
personal contact, can sometimes go hand in hand. 
Until recently, the approach of modern Western medicine has been 
radically different from that of all other cultures. The Western art of 
healing is based on a body of scientific knowledge which views the 
human body's organs, functions and ailments as phenomena governed 
by physical, physiological and genetic laws and therefore independent of 
cultural and local contexts. In the Western tradition treatment means 
using knowledge of these laws, often backed by sophisticated 
techniques, to neutralize ailments. Things are starting to change, 
however, and itis increasingly recognized that other forms of medicine 
have something to offer or at least that certain questions must be asked. 
Necbody would dream of denying the beneficial effects—in some cases 
immense—of modern medicine. But the excesses to which it can and 
sometimes does lead are equally plain to see. Is there not a risk of 
dehumanization inherent in mobilizing a battery of technical resources on 
patients while disregarding their mental outlock, their culture, their 
psychological, moral and spiritual resources, their dignity and willpower, 
their emotional environment and their attitudes to life and death? 
Perhaps so-called traditional forms of medicine still have much 
to teach us. ... ||

### 110440: Culture and health

Culture and health 
BY CLAUDINE BRELET-RUEFF 
Modern medicine may be coming round to the idea 
that the sick are not ‘machines’ but people rooted in 
their cultural and natural environment 
THE UNESCO Gourier HB FEBRUARY 1998 
Medicine, perhaps more than any other 
of the activities that contribute to our 
survival, depends on the cultural context in 
which it is practised, dealing as it does with 
birth, suffering and death, thosc essential fca- 
tures of our human condition. People have 
becn receiving medical attention since long 
before biology and chemistry came into being, 
long before the advent of Western-style pre- 
ventive medicine. Highly efficient therapies— 
some of them, such as the trepanation and 
dental surgery performed by the Incas, involv- 
ing the use of amazing techniques—have been 
employed for thousands of years. 
Only recently, however, have such tradi- 
tional forms of medicine been studied in the 
West. Their significance and value have been 
more decply understood by Westerners thanks 
to the worldview of modern physics (relativ- 
ity and quantum theory, thermodynamics)— 
in which everything is seen in terns of inter- 
action—and decolonization, which has given 
peoples previously held in conteinpt an 
opportunity to make the voices of their cul- 
tures heard once more. 
Western medicine, which had hitherto 
regarded human beings as “machines”, is grad- 
ually coming round to the idea of treating 
“the whole person”, in accordance with an 
outlook that in some respects links up with 
that held in traditional societies. The medical 
model that is thus emerging is no longer inter- 
ested solely in disease but in health in a general 
sense, and in the psychological and cultural 
factors from which it stems. 
Those who extol the virtues of progress 
are sometimes annoyed by certain “irrational” 
aspects of traditional forms of medicine, but 
the fact is that they spring from cultures that 
firmly believe in the existence of a network of 
interdependences between human beings and 
the universe at large; a person’s relationship 
with nature, in the broadest sense, is regarded 
 
as that of a humble partner, not a proprictor. 
The various types of traditional medicine, 
from shamanism to Ayurveda, reflect widely 
different ways of thinking, but all of them, as 
the following examples show, tend to sce 
humans as an integral part of the world as a 
whole, and science and spirituality as being 
different points on the same continuum. 
Shamanism 
A feature common to the various forms of 
shamanism found all over the world, from 
Siberia to Amazonia, is the practice of diag-

nosis and therapy through an cestatic state. In 
addition to possessing a profound, albeit 
empirical, knowledge of the medicinal prop- 
erties of plants, the shaman performs also as 
poet, soothsayer, healer and sometimes magi- 
cian and ventriloquist as well, but he is above 
all else an initiate. Initiation, the personal expe- 
rience of the threefold mystery of suffering, 
death and resurrection, bestows an aura of the 
sacred on him. While he is officiating, his body 
is covered in signs and objects symbolizing 
his powers. He is able to communicate with 
spirits that are invisible to the cyes of the 
uninitiated, and his words translate the mur-

As an initiate, he is able to enter in spirit 
into his patient’s body, to drive out demons 
and pursue them in the world beyond. The 
convulsing womb of a woman about to give 
birth thus becomes a universe peopled with 
monsters and mythical beasts, metaphorically 
representing the contractions and fears with 
which she must contend. The shaman can give 
the ailment not only a name but also material 
form, removing, often by sucking, from the 
patient’s body or soul the crystals and blood- 
soaked down he has chewed.

While the shaman is performing his rites, 
the patient is never isolated from the world. As 
during voodoo ceremonies in Brazil or Benin, 
all his kith and kin are on hand during the 
“therapeutic drama” that helps purge the sick 
of their ills. The responsibility for coping 
with suffering is shared. 
Medicine in ancient Egypt 
In addition to the meagre information about 
ancient Egyptian medical practices that can be 
gleaned from papyri, we can appreciate the 
anatomical knowledge required by the tech- 
niques used in the process of mummification 
to remove the brain, viscera and eyeballs, and 
the Egyptians’ command of the antiseptic 
properties of the essential oils, resins, herbs 
and spices they used not only to embalm the 
mortal remains of their dignitaries but also 
to treat many illnesses.

Like scribes, sorcerer-physicians were trained 
in a “house of life” whose supreme master and 
first initiate was the ibis, symbol of the god 
of wisdom. When sleeping, the ibis curls itself 
up into the shape of a heart, just like the hicro- 
glyph which represents “goodness” and which 
1s made up of three signs—vibration (or air), the 
individual (through whom life on earth is car- 
ried on), and the mouth (through which 
breathing, also manifested in the beating of the 
heart, passes). As in Chinese medicine, the “heart 
speaks” throughout the body. 
Hippocrates, the famous Greek physician 
of Antiquity, who had studied the healing art 
inthe temples of Egypt, divulged the lessons 
he had learned. His aphorism “Weare what we 
eat” and his pronouncements on the impor- 
tance of the interaction between people and 
their environment tie in with the explanation 
given in the Ebers Papyrus Treatise on the

functioning and knowledge of the heart. 
“Four vessels (metou) lead to the liver and 
convey moisture and air to it. They then cause 
all kinds of illnesses.” As well as being the seat 
of the intelligence, the “heart” is also the organ 
that powers and steers the body, distributing 
energy thereto via the metou, which carry air, 
waste products and blood. Each individual’ 
blood is held to pulsate at its own specific fre- 
quency. This pulsatory conception of the 
human being might explain why so many of 
the incantations that have been rediscovered 
were not accompanied by any form of treat- 
ment. Others were performed at the same time 
as particular potions were administered. 
Rationalists are often put out by the mag- 
ical aspect of pharaonic medicine, such as the 
use of sacred sleep in temples. This therapy, 
probably induced by hypnosis that weakened 
self-awareness, might have remained a puz- 
zling phenomenon if sleep cures had not come 
to be used in modern clinics.

protection of humanity, the sorcerer-physi- 
cians did not claim to have invented the spells 
they intoned or the treatments they pre- 
scribed. Their lore eame from the gods. Learn- 
ing alone is not, however, enough to make a 
good physician, whose status is indissociable 
from that of priest. Not only must he study 
while young, work hard and long so that 
knowledge, as it were, comes naturally and 
grows of its own accord, but he must live an 
upright life, since “holy things should be 
taught only to those who are pure”. 
Aztec angst 
Underlying the culture of the Aztecs was a 
sense of dread stemming from their belief that 
the world they knew was doomed to be wiped 
out by fearsome earthquakes, just as the four 
previous worlds had been annihilated by cat- 
astrophes. The gods had had to sacrifice them- 
selves in order to overcome death, and humans 
likewise had to pay the price of their survival 
in human blood. The Spanish chronicler »

Bernardino de Sahagin, who arrived in Mexico 
in 1529, relates that never a day passed but that 
women were sacrificed to the goddess of salt, 
or children to the rain gods. Their hearts were 
torn out in order that the sun might not die. 
From their earliest ycars, children were sub- 
jected to the severest discipline of a mystical

and military hierarchy. Depending on the 
social class to which they belonged, boys were 
educated either in local schools which pre- 
pared them for the productive work of the 
community, or in religious schools whose 
austerity trained them for their future roles as 
priest-physicians or high officials of the state. 
Illness was seen as a divine punishment 
provoked by a disturbance of the cosmic bal- 
ance resulting from the failure of the sick to 
conform to the natural order to which every- 
one should submit on pain of unleashing the 
wrath of the gods and bringing on further 
cataclysms. The responsibility of the sooth- 
sayer-priest (¢icitl), as the humans’ go-between 
with the gods, was therefore not so much to 
treat ailments that had been sent as punish- 
ments as to find out, especially by means of 
astrology and sacred numerology, what the 
sick had done to displease the gods. He 
employed simple forms of divination (recov- 
ery was guaranteed if grains of maize thrown 
down on the ground or into a pot of water did 
not scparate; otherwise the patient would die) 
but also used hallucinogenic plants such as 
peyotl (Anbaloninm lewini), a small spineless 
cactus, and sacred mushrooms such as the teo- 
nanacatl (Pancolus campanulatus), which were 
eaten to induce the collective trances that 
accompanicd human sacrifices. 
The Aztec pharmacopocia comprised some 
12,000 medicinal plants (patli) which were sold

in the markets of the main towns and were 
sometimes grown in the floating gardens 
known as chinampas. They were used mainly 
for the purpose of treating minor ailments. 
Among the Aztecs, where the individual was 
absorbed bodily into the community, illness 
was regarded primarily as the sign of some 
disturbance of the cosmic order, fraught with 
the dread of a punishment on which their 
afterlife depended. 
Sacred medicine 
and all-round health 
Although it is clear from these few examples 
that traditional medicine is indissociable from 
the spiritual path chosen by the society within 
which itis practised, thereare certain features 
common to all forms of such medicine that are 
absent from modern medicine. These are: 
«3 holistic approach to the individual, seen 
as a multi-dimensional—at once physical, 
mental, social and spiritual—being who lives 
in close interdependence with his or her nat- 
ural environment and with the vast, mysteri- 
ous cosmos; 
« aview of the physician’s role as being close 
to that of the priest, or indeed the sorcerer, at 
any cvent of the initiate who needs to have 
direct experience of death and suffering. The 
physician has to be upright and pure, and is 
held accountable to men and the gods, if not 
indeed to life itself; 
« [earning based upon observation of living 
reality and a thorough, albeit empirical, 
knowledge of the natural environment and 
natural resources, including cosmic rhythms, 
which are reflected in the fluctuations observ- 
able in human health. 
Traditional medicine’s characteristically 
global approach to lifc and the human being is 
attracting growing interest in the West, which 
nowadays takes a would-be holistic view of the 
world—holos being the Greek both for 
“whole” and for “sacred”. Hence, the defini- 
tion of health given by the World Health 
Organization (WHO) can also serve as a uni- 
versal definition of the human being consid- 
ercd in all his or her many dimensions: health 
is “a state of complete physical, mental and 
social well-being and not merely the absence of 
discase or infirmity.” This definition bids 
modern society to draw inspiration from the 
wisdom of traditional medicine. It offers 
modern medicine an opportunity to find the 
path of harmony and wisdom. |

A Buddhist remedy 
The unifying approach of Buddhist thought 
encourages a fruitful relationship between doctor 
and patient 
“The dichotomy between body 
and mind posited by Western 
thought seems to be 
responsible for an increase in 
psychosomatic illnesses.” 
: # 
p THE UNESCO Gourier WB FEBRUARY 1998 
A major psychological problem of our 
times is what I call “loss of relatedness”. 
It takes many forms and seems to me to some 
degree intertwined with the progress of mod- 
ern science and technology. 
Here are two examples taken from my 
experience as a psychotherapist. 
The father of a boy who obstinately 
refused to go to school over a long period 
once said to me: “Today human beings can go 
to the moon and back when somebody merely 
presses a button. Why can’t you find the right 
button to press to make my son go to 
BY HAYAO KAWAI 
school?” In other words, he wanted to oper- 
ate his son ltke a machine. Sensing this lack of 
“relatedness”, the son resisted his father, con- 
sciously or unconsciously. 
Another modern trend is the increase in 
psychosomatic diseases. Modern medicine, 
based on the premise of a dichotomy between 
mind and body, has made great progress in 
many fields, especially the conquest of dis-* 
ease. But at the same time, this dichotomy 
seems to be responsible for an increase in psy- 
chosomatic illnesses; it is almost as if nature 
were taking revenge. 
I suspect that the rapid progress of mod- 
ern science has something to do with this. To 
sec whether this is so let us examine the main 
principles of scientific methodology. 
The basic premise of scientific methodol- 
ogy is that the observer must be separated 

## [Page 13](110439engo.pdf#page=13) 0

### 110441: A Buddhist remedy

  
from the phenomena that are observed, so 
that the results of observation are indepen- 
dent of the observer and have universal value. 
The distinction between subject and object is 
a great achievement of modern European cul- 
ture, which can claim thereby to have given 
science its universal quality. 
Science has also become inseparable from 
technology, which is now available to anyone. 
To use technology, all you have to do 1s follow 
the instructions in the manual; you don’t 
need any special skill or ability. As the father 
of the high-school boy said, a human being can 
go to the moon just by pressing buttons. 
The success of modern technology has led 
many people to want to apply its methods to 
family and social relationships. Everybody 
wants to know the best technique for con- 
trolling or managing others. There has been a 
flowering of “how to” knowledge: how to raise 
a good baby, how to treat old people, and so on. 
The Buddha is shown 
meditating (centre) and 
preaching on a 5th-6th- 
century-A.D. mandala from 
Bamyan {Afghanistan). 
The social and human sciences have fol- 
lowed in the wake of the natural sciences and 
technology. When a researcher can objectify a 
specific aspect of a human being this approach 
can achieve reasonable results, but if we think 
of a person as a whole being, the methods of 
natural science do not work. A rescarcher is 
human, so that it is impossible to make a clear 
distinction between subject and object; the 
quality of the relationship between the subject 
and object always influences the results. 
The wholeness 
of human beings 
As a psychotherapist, if I meet a hyperactive 
six-year-old boy who cannot concentrate on 
his work in the classroom and try to be as 
objective as possible and avoid any relationship 
with him, all I can say 1s that he is insecure, of 
low intelligence and so on. However, if I try to

establish a good relationship with him, so 
that he feels protected and is allowed to behave 
freely, his behaviour will change. 
The important thing is not so much to 
observe his present situation accurately as to 
wait for his inner possibilities to show them- 
selves. No positive results can be achieved in 
psychotherapy unless there is a relationship 
between subject and object. This is also true in 
education and some fields of medicine. When 
I have come across patients with psychoso- 
matic discases I have sometimes deliberately 
tried not to explore their causes, give advice 
or use medical drugs. While I have not “cured” 
these patients, their symptoms have sponta- 
neously disappeared. 
This approach is completely different from 
technology, where everything is very clear-cut.

What one should do and the kind of responses 
one gets are all described in the operating man- 
ual: a specific action produces specific results. 
Instead, I wait for something to happen, with- 
out knowing exactly what it will be. My 
approach 1s heuristic and I feel that I am cre- 
ating something. Patients are cured by their 
creative activities, which are fostered by the 
relationship between them and me. 
The Buddhist approach 
I think Buddhism has much to teach us about 
this kind of relationship. 
The most important point stressed by the 
Buddhist text known as the Garland sutra is 
that no being has its own innate “self-nature”: 
I am myself because of an infinite number of 
relations that I have with others. This is a rad- 
ically different idea from the common belief 
that everything that exists has its own nature 
and then has its own relations with others. 
The Garland sutra starts from the premise 
that thereare relationships and that these rela- 
tionships define each being. 
This Buddhist idea stems from a state of 
consciousness which is different from the 
ordinary state in which each object is sepa- 
rated from others. Ata different level of con- 
sciousness the demarcations between objects 
become blurred and eventually everything 
becomes one being which cannot be named. 
This whole being is called Nothingness because 
it has no name, but actually one might say 
that it is Everything. 
After this experience, consciousness returns 
to its ordinary state in which the whole being 
manifests itsclf as separate objects or creatures. 
However, each object is a manifestation of the 
whole being. In the Kegon School of Buddhism, 
this is known as “the Arising of True Nature”. 
This is what I do in psychotherapy when 
I abandon active intentions and simply wait on 
events. This attitude is diametrically opposed 
to that of modern science and technology. Our 
everyday consciousness is oriented by modern 
science towards discrimination, whereas in 
Buddhism it is oriented towards fusion. 
Those who are totally dominated by mod- 
ern scientific thinking may feel that Buddhist 
ideasare confused or nonsensical. For my part, 
I think we need Buddhist ideas as a necessary 
counterweight which may, by admitting the 
existence of a relationship between subject and 
object, make a positive contribution to the 
development of science and technology. H

Ayurveda in a nutshell 
INTERVIEW WITH K. M. SHYAM SUNDAR 
Dr. K.M. Shyam Sundar of the Centre for Indian 
Knowledge Systems (CIKS) in Madras is a specialist in 
Ayurveda. Here he explains some of the basic ideas of 
this traditional system of medicine which is still widely 
practised in India today.

HB What does the word Ayurveda mean? 
— The Sanskrit word Ayu means life, and 
Veda means to know. In other words, 
Ayurveda is the knowledge or science of life. 
Ayurveda highlights the basic laws and prin- 
ciples that govern life in the universe. As well 
as being concerned with the origin, develop- 
ment and treatment of disease, it discusses 
what is bencficial and harmful to life, and what 
is conducive to happiness and unhappiness. 
BM What is the relationship between Ayurveda and 
the Vedas, India's ancient religious scriptures? 
— The text known as the Atharva-Veda 
cxplains the theoretical foundations of 
Ayurveda and highlights their practical use and 
methods of application. It contains anatomical 
descriptions and explanations of certain dis- 
cases and methods of treating wounds and 
ulcers, as well as a discussion of epidemic discases 
and their management. The Rg Veda, the Yajur 
Veda and the Saama Veda also contain mater- 
ial relevant to Ayurvedic medicine. 
BM What are the philosophical foundations of 
Ayurveda? 
— The core belief of the Indian world-view is 
that humankind is the epitome of the universe. 
In cach individual there is as much diversity as 
there is in the world outside. To visualize the self 
in the entire universe and the entire universe in 
the self is the highest aim of human evolution. 
The schools of philosophy in which Ayurveda 
is rooted thus believe that humankind and the 
universe have a common origin and arc com- 
posed of the same basic elements. 
HB What are these elements and how is the body 
constituted from them? 
— Thereare five basic elements—earth, water, 
fire, air and ether. They are known as the Pan- 
chamahabhootas. Knowledge is perceived 
through the senses—hearing, touch, vision, 
taste and smell. 
HM How is the body constructed and how does it 
function? 
— The basic structural units of the body are 
known as dbathus (the word “dhathu” means 
“to support”). They are nourished by the inges- 
tion of food. There arc seven dbathus in the 
human system—body fluids, blood tissue, 
muscular tissue, adipose tissue, bone tissue, 
nerve tissue and marrow, and generative tissue. 
HM The idea of balance is very important in 
Ayurveda. How does it work?

control, an exercise in yoga, the Hindu system of philosophy 
and spiritual discipline.

### 110442: Ayurveda in a nutshell

— In Ayurveda, the prevention and cure of 
all diseases are based on what are known as the 
three doshas: Vatta, Pitta and Kapha. They are 
the biological representatives of the five basic 
elements which constitute the human body, 
and in a healthy person they are always in a 
state of equilibrium. In this balanced state, 
the three doshas control and perform all phys- 
iological functions. When the balance between 
them is disturbed, diseases begin and develop. 
The doshas pervade the whole body but in 
the normal or healthy state Vaita, Pitta and 
Kapha are located in the lower, middle and 
upper portions of the body respectively. 
They support the body as pillars support 
a building and they are actually referred to as 
“Tri Sthuna” or the three pillars. Kapha is pre- 
dominant during childhood, Pitta in youth, 
and Vatha in old age. The day is divided into 
three parts—day, night and the period for the 
digestion of food. Kapha is predominant in 
the first part, Pitta in the middle part, and 
Vatha in the final part. 
The human constitution, both physical 
and mental, is determined at conception by 
the permutation and combination of the three 
doshas that manifest in the gametes. This basic 
constitution of the individual remains con- 
stant throughout life. It is known in Sanskrit 
as Prakruthi, which means “natural” or the 
“original form”, and is the expression of the 
five basic elements. 
HB How is the practice of Ayurveda organized? 
— Ayurveda has eight branches dealing respec- 
tively with: 
 
An Ayurvedic doctor (at left) 
takes a patient's pulse. 
a or AP 
ER SE TR 
@ physical diseases caused by functional or 
systemic disorders; 
@ al] organs above the shoulders; 
« bodily disorders caused by foreign mate- 
rials such as thorns, grass, stone and nails and 
involving the removal of pus and highly viti- 
ated doshas; 
«diseases caused by bites of snakes, spiders 
and other poisons of animal or plant origin; 
# mental disorders and infectious diseases 
caused by unknown or unseen creatures or 
germs. This branch also deals with sacrifices 
and rituals intended to remove evil spirits; 
« children’s diseases. Methods of purifying 
breast milk and diseases originating from 
astrological defects; 
« improving the quality of body tissues, 
consequently increasing resistance, strength 
and intellect, delaying the ageing process and 
maintaining a youthful body; 
«increasing the quality and quantity of sem- 
inal fluid and ova and methods of increasing 
sexual desire, vigour and fertility; curing steril- 
ity and other related sexual disorders. 
HE How would you define the relationship between 
Ayurveda and Western thought? 
—Modern medicine and Western thought gen- 
eralize and categorize individuality. Accord- 
ing to the Western concept of normality and 
health, what is common in a majority of indi- 
viduals constitutes the norm. 
Ayurveda holds that normality must be 
evaluated individually, since every human being 
manifests his or her own particular and spon- 
taneous temperament and functioning. In the 
East, the key to understanding is acceptance, 
observation and experience. The West, on the 
contrary, believes in questioning, analysis and 
logical deduction. Western thought trusts 
objectivity, whereas Eastern thought empha- 
sizes subjectivity.

### 110444: The Healing power of faith

The healing power of faith ue sciesm 
In India, the sick visit the tombs of saints in search of a cure 
Top, a sick child who has been 
cured is ritually weighed 
during a pilgrimage to a 
saint's tomb. The equivalent of 
her weight in sugar will be 
given to the priest. 
THE UNESCO Courier BW FEBRUARY 1998 
For centuries the faithful have been mak- 
“ing pilgrimages to the burial sites of holy 
men throughout the Indian subcontinent. The 
pilgrims believe that these saints, some of 
whom are women, have supernatural powers, 
and that when they died God empowered them 
with a benevolent force called baraka that 
emanates from the grave and can be used to per- 
form miracles for the living. 
Different rituals have evolved at these sites to 
unite the faithful with this special power and 
give them spiritual strength. Some of these prac- 
tices arc universal and some are specific to certain 
tombs. One very common ritual is for a person 
to be chained to a railing surrounding the tomb 
or to a part of the building housing it. 
The supplicants remain chained until they 
feel united with the power of the saint. This 
may take a few hours, or involve attempts 
Jasting several days. After experiencing this 
union, supplicants wear the chains wrapped 
around their arms as a badge of honour. It is 
also common to see the faithful walking in 
circlesaround the tomb until they drop from 
dizziness or exhaustion. When have recovered 
their strength, they get up and continue. The 
faithful are led through these rituals, which 
also constitute an attempt to invoke the spirit 
of the deceased, by hereditary priests who are 
often descendants of the holy person buried 
there. When an infertile woman gives birth, 
or a sick child is cured, the child is brought 
back to be weighed, so that a gift of raw sugar 
amounting to the exact weight of the child 
can be offered. This is accepted by the priests 
on behalf of the saint. 
If the tomb is located near a body of water, 
either natural or artificial, the water is consid-

ered to be imbued with curative powers and 
the pilgrims immerse themselves in it—fully 
clothed in the case of the women. Another 
common ritual is that of fumigation. Incense 
is burned near the tomb. If the illness or mis- 
fortune is due to a spirit that has entered the 
body it will be “smoked out”. 
Lavish decoration 
Any type of behaviour, as long as it is not 
destructive, is accepted at these locations. Peo- 
ple are allowed, even encouraged, to forget 
everyday restraints and sing, dance or shout to 
their hearts’ content. The tombs are lavishly 
decorated, and many sites house additional 
shrines and cenotaphs dedicated to lesser sacred 
personages. 
A visit to the tomb is a break from the 
arduous routine of daily life and the strict 
social controls of Indian society. The more 
popular locations are equipped with small 
rooms around a courtyard in which entire 
families can stay overnight, or for a few days. 
Visits to these tomb sites have become part 
of the secular tradition of the people, attract- 
ing them regardless of their religious affiliation 
or walks of life. They are places where rich and 
poor, uneducated and educated, Muslim, 
Hindu, Christian and Jain all come together, 
some to be cured of illnesses and some to be 
helped to cope with their everyday problems— 
lost love, debt, despair. People whose wishes 
have been granted return to give thanks 
throughout their lifetime. |

BY EMMANUELLE KADYA TALL 
THE UNESCO Courier W FESRUARY 1998 
African traditional medicine seeks both 
to cure disease and to make sense of mis- 
fortune and illness. 
In addition to herbal or biochemical reme- 
dies, a patient must be given psychological and 
social back-up, which plays an equally impor- 
tant part in the cure. This has long been known 
in traditional African medicine, which tries to 
place the occurrence of illness in a context, to 
  
      
  
integrate a specific ailment into a wider frame- 
work of disorder and decipher its meaning. 
In keeping with a widespread African 
notion of the punishment of evil, traditional 
healers regard a sick person as the victim of 
external aggression of human or supernatural 
origin. It is notso much the details of a symp- 
tom as 1ts recurrence and association with 
other symptoms which determine the choice

of remedy. If the symptoms persist, the search 
fora cure is extended to other systems of med- 
icine including biochemical treatment to relieve 
physical pain and traditional treatment to 
appease evil spirits. 
The two systems exist more in harmony 
with each other than in competition. Biomed- 
icine concentrates on the patient’s body, over- 
looking the fact that the patient is a social being. 
The traditional healer takes account of the social 
aspect and diagnoses the illness in accordance 
with a system of symbolic interpretation shared 
by the whole community. Traditional cures, 
empirical as they are, are rooted in the sym- 
bolism of a society, such as its cosmology. 


### 110445: Senegal: a mirror of the cosmos

The Haalpulaaren 
of northern Senegal 
The theoretical and practical inedical knowl- 
edge of the Haalpulaaren people of northern 
Scnegal 1s based on several traditions. These 
farming people who have been in contact with 
Islam since the cleventh century, are divided 
into lineage groups originally based on social 
and occupational categories (marabouts, 
hunter-warriors, fishermen, craftsmen and 
slaves). Each group has its own special field of 
knowledge. The hunter-warriors, fishermen 
and shepherds know about ecology and med- 
icine. The descendants of the toorooBe group 
(“God’s beggars”) are conversant with Islam. 
Craftsmen have highly specialized knowl- 
edge of healing. Blacksmiths, through their 
mastery of iron and fire, soothe burns and 
lance abscesses. Weavers tie knots to stop 
headaches and toothache. Leather workers 
make small bags to contain the writings pre- 
scribed by marabouts. Everyone acquires some 
basic therapeutic knowledge during their 
apprenticeship, but some are naturally gifted 
healers and only one of these is recognized as 
such in each generation and lineage group. He 
acquires his knowledge from his group and 
his activity is confined to the home and the vil- 
lage. Sometimes, however, his reputation 
spreads to the whole region. 
These types of healing are not based on a 
divinatory form of investigation into the causes 
of illness but on observation and experience, 
and the purpose of a cure is only to make the 
symptoms and physical pain disappear. 
Oral and written wisdom 
There is another, more scholarly and secret tra- 
dition among marabouts and hunters of sor- 
cerers (or counter-sorcerers). Marabouts never 
interpret an illness in terms of sorcery because 
sorcerers belong to a pre-Islamic universe rejected 
by Islam. They rely on writing, the instrument 
of the Qur'an. Counter-sorcerers, who belong

» to a more relaxed pagan universe, combat sor- 
cerers and use the spoken word, the medium of 
the traditional pre-Islamic world. The two 
groups stand far apart and do not share the same 
cosmological landmarks, but their rivalry does 
not prevent them from working together. 
They both start by asking themselves why 
their patients areill. Their powers of healing are 
based on being able to give explanations con- 
sistent with the theory and practice of cause 
and effect in Haalpulaar culture. 
Evil spirits 
Apart from the will of God, there are three 
possible main causes of illness and misfor- 
tune: the actions of sorcerer-cannibals and 
spirit-devils, and “maraboutage” or magic. 
Sorcerer-cannibals are human beings who 
leave their bodily form and go off in spirit 
form to hunt the spirit of their prey. They 
belong to the pre-Islamic world of “drinkers of 
blood”, a parallel group modelled on human 
society. They meet at night and organize feasts 
to which each of them must bring in turn their 
contribution of human flesh. Sorcerers attack 
their victims by entering their belly. The symp- 
toms of a sorcerer’s attack are hard to detect 
because the Haalpulaar medical system relies 
less on nosology (the analysis of symptoms) 
than on actiology (the study of causes). But 
some symptoms, like unexplained fainting fol- 
lowed by delirium, young children having 
nightmares, spitting blood, bloodshoteyes or 
nosebleeds, arc immediately seen as sorcery. 
Spirit-devils arecreatures that form part of 
Islamic culture. Of monstrous appearance, they 
haunt certain places at certain times of the day 
when the primitive world reasserts its rights 
over the domesticated world. A person who 
breaks social laws by walking through the bush 
at midday or midnight, or who crosses a 
deserted village square may have an unpleasant 
encounter. The mere sight of these spirits and 
devils can trigger off pathological states ranging 
from mental disturbance to partial or total 
paralysis. Their vigorous breathing enters the 
victim’s body and leaves traces such as swellings, 
paralysis and damage to the intelligence, indis- 
putable evidence of their attack. 
“Maraboutage”, or “bewitchment” is an 
activity which is widely found in other soci- 
eties where it is known as black magic or witch- 
craft. There arc no symptoms enabling it to be 
THE UNESCO Gourier 8 FEBRUARY |998 
  
diagnosed. However, a range of indispositions 
and minor accidents are attributed to this kind 
of aggression. Bewitchment targets the social 
personality of the subject and its most extreme 
cffect is imbecility. Used constructively, 
bewitchment can increase a person’s social abil- 
ities, and 1n this case it is highly appreciated. 
Some Islamic priests are great experts in this. 
Three divisions 
of the body 
The Haalpulaaren divide the body up in three 
ways—symmetrically, with a left and a right 
side, transversally, with the right leg associ- 
ated with the left arm and vice versa, and ver- 
tically, from top to bottom. 
The first division symbolizes the contrast 
between masculine (right) and feminine (left). 
The second is connected with the distortion 
caused by the breathing of spirit-devils. The

third corresponds to the progress of an ill- 
ness, always from the bottom upwards. 
Headaches, for instance, are often said to orig- 
inate from an tllness lower down in the body. 
Therapy is thus designed to make theillness go 
back down to the lower limbs from which it 
can leave the body more casily. 
Symptoms and canses 
The healing arts include physical techniques, 
herbal preparations, writings and incantations, 
which are often used in conjunction. 
Massage, touching, cauterization, cutting 
the skin, knots of cotton thread are all 
designed, along with incantations and writ- 
ings, to casc pain, cast out the discase and pro- 
tect the sick person. 
Medicinal plants are used to purify or heal. 
Purification is carried out by taking baths, 
inhaling decoctions of leaves and roots, fumi-

gating the head or administering enemas. Swal- 
lowing powders and potions also helps. 
Short and fervent incantations (ceft) and 
writings (binndi) belong to pre-Islamic and 
Islamic tradition respectively. The former usc 
the spoken word to connect humans directly 
with the plant and animal world. Each group 
has cefi enabling it to work harmoniously 
with its natural environment. With the writ- 
ten word (binndi), communication is indi- 
rect. The marabout writes on a picce of wood 
a few Qur’anic verses, figures derived from 
some of the verses, or prayers to God. Then he 
wipes the board with cotton soaked in water 
and gtves it to the patient, who will keep it in 
a bottle of water which he will drink or use to 
wash himself. 
So the traditional healer works on two lev- 
els—symptoms and causes. On the first level, he 
fights the visible evidence of the illness; on the 
second, he attacks the illness at its root. [|

### 110446: Zimbabwe: a healer in the marketplace

Zimbabwe: a healer in 
the marketplace 
Gordon Dhliwaye, a n’angaor 
traditional healers, at a market 
in the suburbs of Harare, the 
capital of Zimbabwe. 
In Zimbabwe, 
traditional 
healers are on call 
to solve all kinds 
of medical, social, 
spiritual and 
cultural

In his “office” in the Mbarc musika, a 
market on the outskirts of Harare, the 
capital of Zimbabwe, Gordon Dhliwayo is 
almost hidden behind heaps of twisted roots, 
carthtone powders, forbidden furs, horns, 
bones and shells that clutter the small table in 
front of him. 
Dhliwayo is an’anga or traditional healer. 
To reach him for consultation, you pass by 
umpteen tables of tomato and cabbage sell- 
ers, browse over piles of fruit, and continue 
through the kitchenware section—mainly 
hand-carved wooden utensils and baskets 
beautifully woven with intricate designs. 
The ordinariness of the dozen healers prac- 
tising in the market is striking. Dhliwayo wears 
a dingy jump-suit, and were it not for the horse 
tail in one hand and the tortoisc-shell in the 
other, you might take him for a garage hand. 
His appearance belies the powerful talents ances- 
tral spirits have bestowed upon him. 
One secret his grandmother never told him 
was to put butter on a burn. A good n’anga 
knows that crushed ostrich egg is the proper 
remedy, and instead of a low dose of buffered 
aspirin when baby has a headache, Dhliwayo 
BY KRISTOPHER WALMSLEY 
recommends pulverized sea shells rubbed into 
asmall incision on the infant’s head. Grown-ups 
should smoke twigs of the mufandichimuka 
bush and call him in the morning. 
Mutual respect between modern 
and traditional healers 
Nineteenth-century colonialism bred scepti- 
cism which resulted in the Witchcraft Sup- 
pression Act, which forbade traditional heal- 
ing in what is now Zimbabwe. Today, the 
n’angas at Mbare’s musika and another 25,000 
of them throughout the country are licensed 
by the Zimbabwe National Traditional Heal- 
ers Association (ZINATHA). This associa- 
tion was established in 1980, shortly after the 
Rhodesian government was replaced by a par- 
liamentary democracy, and the country 
renamed itself Zimbabwe. 
Since independence, ZINATHA has offered 
recommendations to the government on the 
acceptance and use of traditional medicine. Cur- 
rently, the association is co-operating with the 
University of Zimbabwe on research into the 
herbs used by its members. Mutandi Sibanda, 
a spokesman at ZINATHA, cstimates that 96 
per cent of the population consult n’angas, 
including paticnts from abroad and even West- 
ern medical doctors practising in Zimbabwe. 
What may have disconcerted the colonists 
is that n’angas offer more than health care. If 
your afflictions are not in your body, but in 
the courtroom, the n’anga has a cure. Some 
n’angas have had to face the courts on charges 
of malpractice. Sibanda notes, however, that 
since legal recognition of the herbalists under 
the auspices of ZINATHA, such cases and 
other allegations of quackery have decreased. 
Understanding and mutual respect between 
modern and traditional healers have developed 
outside the courts through workshops and 
information exchanges. Most significant is the 
training n’angas are receiving to incorporate 
HIV/Aids awareness, prevention and care activ- 
ities into their work. 
“As long as we have our society,” says 
Sibanda, “there will be a need for the n’anga 
to help with medical, social, spiritual and cul- 
tural problems.” |

### 110447: China: the full treatment

  
China: the full treatment BY TING HOR 
Chinese doctors see illness as triggered by unbalanced relations between the organs and treat 
the body as a whole rather than its constituent parts 
In a Chinese hospital, 
surgery is performed under 
local anaesthetic induced by 
acupuncture. 
~ Doctors in modern Chinese hospitals 
wear ties and white coats and look very 
much like their Western counterparts. How- 
ever, the similarity stops there 
At the beginning of a consultation, adoc- 
tor takes your pulse in a special way, with 
three fingers, and then carefully examines your 
tongue. He will use imagery to describe his 
diagnosis. “The wind and the cold have 
attacked your lungs,” he might say. 
The medicines used are mostly extracted 
from plants, but animal and mineral sub- 
stances arc also prescribed. In this particular 
case the purpose of the pharmaceutics will be 
to “chascaway the wind and the cold and add 
some earth to produce gold.” 
In other cases, the doctor may order an 
acupuncture session, or the application of burn- 
ing “sticks” of medicinal herbs (moxa treat- 
ment), or clse Chinese massage to “unblock 
the meridians”. Other remedies include suction 
cups, plasters and wires under the skin. 
The notion of balance 
Chinese medicine is as old as Chinesc civiliza- 
tion itself butit was only established as a for- 
mal doctrine in the third century B.C. Tts the- 
oretical basis, which has never changed since

then, springs from the Taoist principles of 
yin and yang, the five movements, and gi. 
Taoists use these terms to describe natural 
phenomena. Thus day is yang and night is yin. 
The two are intertwined and blend to produce 
a complete day. The whole universe works on 
the same principle. When yin and yang are in 
harmony, we feel well. When they are not, we 
feel ill. When they are separated, death ensues. 
The aim of Chinese medicine is to restore 
a balance, to harmonize yin and yang through 
the “five movements” —represcnted by nature’s 
five most common elements, wood, fire, carth, 
metal and water. Taoists have studied the rela- 
tionships between the five and devised a sys- 
tem of references enabling them to understand 
the world, including all aspects of life. 
A map of the body 
In accordance with this system, doctors have 
divided the body up into five kinds of func- 
tions, cach represented by an “organ”. Physi- 
ologically speaking, cach function is the basis 
of another one and is under the control of a 
third. The lung, for example, is supported by 
the spleen and is controlled by the liver. Illness 
occurs when these links are disturbed. If the 
spleen does not give the lung sufficient sup- 
port, the lung becomes diseased. Hence the

spleen has to be stimulated so it supports the 
lung properly again, making treatment more 
effective. This is why, in the example men- 
tioned above, the doctors decided to “add 
carth (the spleen) to produce gold (the lung).” 
Buthow do you “add carth”? The answer is 
through qi, one of Taoism’s most metaphysical

concepts. In modern Chinese, the word means 
“air”, but Taoists use it to explain particular nat- 
ural or social tendencies. To Chinese doctors, it 
means, broadly speaking, a function. Certain 
plants or animal or mineral products have the 
ability to improve the g7 of certain organs. Qf 
also tells the doctor, through the pulse, the state 
of cach organ (depending on whether the pulse 
is strong, weak, fluid, delicate, noisy, ctc.). The 
appearance of the tongucis also gi “speaking” to 
the doctor. And itis gi which travels around all 
the body’s “meridians”. 
Meridians pass right through the entire 
body and connect the inner organs to the sur- 
face. There are fourteen main ones, with 360 
points of contact with the skin from inside the 
body. By stimulating the meridians, ¢.g. with 
needles, or with “burning” moxa herbs or by 
massaging the contact points, gi can be

adjusted to re-establish the balance of the 
body’s yin and yang. 
All imbalances are due to a “change of cli- 
mate” brought about either by one of the six 
“external causes” (wind, cold, heat, humid- 
ity, drought and fire) or by one of the six 
“internal” ones (happiness, anger, sadness, anx- 
iety, obsession and terror). There are other 
causes which do not fit into either category, 
such as unhealthy life-styles or accidents.

Chinese doctors do not try to make an in- 
depth diagnosis of a part of the body. They 
make an overall prognosis and treat the patient 
as a whole. They do not treat a specific com- 
plaint, such as an ulcer, but the entire body. 
The biological mechanism involved in such 
therapy has not been clearly established. Some 
think doctors encourage patients to cure them- 
selves. Others believe the immuno-defence sys- 
tem is activated. Be that as it may, the strategy 
of helping “good” ¢i to chase away “bad” gi 
avoids aggression against the body and mini- 
mizes side-cffects, and it is this that has helped 
to make Chinese medicine popular in the West. 
Question marks 
Is it scientific? “Cold” and “wind” cannot be 
scen under a microscope, and there is no scien- 
tific way of measuring gi. Thus, although 
rescarchers have found “traces” of meridians in 
the laboratory, Western doctors do not consider 
Chinese medicine as being scientific. On the 
other hand, some Chinese doctors claim that 
modern methods of scientific investigation are 
still too limited and rudimentary to detect the 
basic principles applied in Chinese medicine. 
But the aim of medicine is not the same as the

aim of science. Therapy is first and foremost 
the art of healing. If something works, you do 
not need to know the reason why. 
Is it better than other systems of medi- 
cine? Like them, it is more effective in some 
instances than others. Its global approach helps 
in treating psychosomatic illnesses and chronic 
or functional discases, for example. Acupunc- 
ture works with sporting injuries. But Chinese 
medicine is not so good when it comes to 
emergencies or acute conditions. It is not magic 
or universal—it is not a panacea, in fact. 
What of orthodoxy? The apparent ortho- 
doxy of natural medicines is an illusion of 
which we should be wary. In Chinese medicine, 
as in other areas, there are fashions, fads and 
trends. A search for traditional remedies at all 
costs leads to bigotry and superstition. The 
spirit of the ancient wisdom should certainly

be preserved, but the world is a changing place. 
When practised outside China, Chinese med- 
icine encounters new circumstances, New aims 
and a different range of drugs. Even in China, 
people from the north are not treated med- 
ically in the same way as people from the 
south. The best way to grasp the most subtle, 
traditional and authentic aspects of Chinese 
medicine is to understand that its essence is 
its ability to adapt. [|

Unesco office in Jakarta (Indonesia). 
The first volume of the catalogue was published in 1896 under 
the title International Collation of Traditional and Folk Medicine, 
Northeast Asia, Part I. Covering Korea, China, Japan and Hong Kong, 
it identifies and studies the active agents in 200 medicinal plant 
species. Volumes Il (published in 1997) and ill (in preparation) are a

WHO SUPPORT 
FOR TRADITIONAL MEDICINE 
Despite the increase in international trade in herbal medicines and other types of alternative 
medicine, the potential of traditional medicine 1s far from being fully utilized in most national 
health systems. 
Many elements of traditional medicine are beneficial, but others are not. The World Health 
Organization (WHO) encourages and supports countries’ efforts to find safe and effective 
remedies and practices for use in health services while not endorsing all forms of traditional 
medicine. 
Most of the population in developing countries still rely mainly on traditional practi 
tioners and local medicinal plants for primary health care, and interest in traditional and alter- 
native systems of medicine has grown in industrialized countries during the last decade. In 
the United States it 1s estimated that one-third of the population uses at least some form 
of alternative treatment such as herbal medicines, acupuncture, chiropractic and home- 
opathy. Surveys in European countries have shown similar interest: 60% of the Dutch and 
Belgian public have expressed their willingness to pay extra health insurance for alternative 
medicine, and 74% of the British public favour complementary medicine being available on the 
national health service, 
Herbal medicines have existed for many centuries, but only a relatively small number of 
plant species—about 5,000—have been studied for their possible medical applications. 
Safety and efficacy data exist only in respect of a much smaller number of plants, their extracts 
and their active ingredients. The establishment and use of regulation procedures and quality 
control have become major concerns in both developing and industrialized countries. 
Acupuncture is used worldwide because of the simplicity of its application, its minimal 
side-effects and its low cost. It has been in constant use in China for thousands of years, 
and spread to other oriental countries long ago. By 1990, 62,000 of Europe's 88,000 
acupuncturists were medical doctors, and acupuncture users totalled 20 million. Consumer 
surveys consistently show positive public attitudes to complementary medicine—90% of 
the pain clinics in the United Kingdom and 77% in Germany use acupuncture. 
There are 12 WHO collaborating centres for traditional medicine, 8 of which are involved 
in training and research on acupuncture, while the others are conducting research on herbal 
medicines. These centres have made a major contribution to the international standardiza- 
tion of herbal medicines and acupuncture, and to the exchange of information. 
In China, where traditional medicine is widely practised, each province has a college and 
aresearch institute for Chinese traditional medicine. In India, the government provides finan- 
cial research and development support for the Ayurvedic and Unani systems and their 
increasing involvement in the delivery of health services. Such systems are seen as allies in 
the delivery of primary health care. Research institutes and foundations have also been estab 
lished in industnalized countries, such as the Office of Alternative Medicine in the United 
States. A group set up by the European Commission is investigating the therapeutic sig- 
nificance of unconventional medicine, its cost-benefit ratio and its sociocultural importance 
as a basis for the evaluation of its possible use in public health. 
WHO strongly supports the further promotion and development of the rational use of 
traditional medicine throughout the world.

AN INTERNATIONAL 
CONFERENCE 
“Culture and Health” was the yearly theme chosen for the World 
Decade for Cultural Development (1988-1997) in 1996, and in May 
of that year Unesco and WHO held an international conference on the 
subject at Chiang Rai (Thailand). 
The Conference drew attention to the dangers implicit in the 
body-mind dichotomy in the medical context and put the debate 
between traditional and modern medicine in a broader perspective, It 
stressed the need to reconcile the two approaches In the treatment 
of illness and to explore a number of issues including the use and 
“modernization” of traditional medical practices, endogenous devel- 
opment of community health care for self-reliance, the use of herbal 
remedies, and the study of indigenous food habits and traditional 
lifestyles in different cultures. 
Attention was also drawn to the importance of non-physical 
factors In health and healing. Health should not be divorced from the 
social and cultural context. It is now known, for example, that peo- 
ple who live alone and suffer from loneliness tend to live up to ten 
years less than those who have close personal relationships. 
The proceedings of the conference will be published in 1998, 
together with a booklet for the general public. Unesco and WHO were 
also urged to organize an international conference on “Culture, Ethics 
and Health".

(4.4 years for males and 4.9 years for females). 
3. There are now 380 million people aged 65 years and above. By the year 2020, 
the over-65 population Is projected to increase globally by 82%. 
4, For every baby born today in an industrialized country, there are ten people aged 
65 or over. By the year 2020 there will be 15 such elderly persons for each new- 
born child. In developing countries, the ratio today is 2 people over 65 for every 
newborn child, and 4 for every newborn child by 2020. 
5. Life expectancy at birth was 48 years in 1955; 59 years in 1975; and 65 years 
In 1995. 
6. In 1960, most deaths were among people under 50. Today, most are among 
the over-50s. 
7. By 2025, more than 60% of all deaths will be among the over-63s, and more 
than 40% among over-75s. 
Infant and child health 
8. Deaths among children under 5 years declined from 19 million in 1960 to 11

parasitic diseases, more than 15 million to circulatory diseases, over 6 million to 
cancers and about 3 million to respiratory diseases. 
12. Of over 52 million deaths in 1996, 40 million were in developing countries, 
including almost 9 million in the least developed countries. 
Infectious diseases 
13. The leading killer among infectious diseases in 1996 was acute lower respi- 
ratory infection, which killed 3.9 million people. 
14. Tuberculosss killed 3 million people in 1996. 
15. Diarrhoeal diseases killed 2.5 millicn people in 1996.

than 70%. 
19. Leprosy registered prevalence cases fell from 2.3 to 1.7 per 10,000 popula- 
tion between 1995 and 1996, and the problem has been reduced by 82% world- 
wide inthe last 11 years. 
20. The Onchocerciasts Control Programme which began in West Africa in 1974 
has now protected an estimated 36 million people from the disease. 
21. More than 120 milion children under 5 in India were immunized against 
poliomyelitis in a single day in 1996. 
22. Field trials in Africa in 1996 showed that insecticide-treated bed nets can 
reduce childhood deaths from malaria by up to 35%. 
Noncommunicable diseases 
23. Tobacco Is calculated to cause 3 million deaths a year mainly from lung can- 
cer and circulatory diseases. 
Cancer 
24, About half of the more than 6 million deaths from cancer in 1996 were due 
to cancers of the lung, stomach, colon-rectum, liver and breast. 
25. Smoking accounts for one in 7 cancer deaths worldwide. 
Mental disorders 
26. An estimated 45 million people are affected by schizophrenia. There were 4.5 
million new cases of schizophrenia and other delusional diserders in 1996. 
27. An estimated 28 million people worldwide incur significant health risks by using 
pyschoactive substances other than alcohol, tobacco and volatile solvents. 
Occupational health 
28. Occupational accidents account for more than 120 million injuries and at least 
220,000 deaths a year. 
29. There are about 160 million cases a year of occupational diseases, of which 
30-40% may lead to chronic disease and 10% to permanent work disability. 
30. Only 5-10% of workers in developing countries, and 20-50% in industrialized 
countries, have access to adequate occupational health services.

“Universal peace will one day come about not because 
human beings will hecome better (that is too much to hope 
for), but because a new ovder of things, new science and 
new economic needs will force peace upon us”. These 
prophetic words were written by Anatole France. This new 
order of things and the new science aud new economic 
needs lie announced have now come to pass. If war is still 
raging in many corners of the carth, it is because most peo- 
ple have not yet grasped this changing situation. 
It might have been thought that the end of the cold war 
would have liberated resources from which development 
and peace would have benefitted. Ilowever, such transfers 
have been few. It might have heen thought that the glob- 
alization of communication, which has turned the planet 
into a single community—a village, it is said—would have 
broadened the sense of unity and, by abolishing distance, 
would rave ipso facto created global solidarity. Nothing 
could be further from the truth. 
Paradoxically, peace has never been more threatened 
thanitis at present. The reshaping of geo-strategic interests 
and the emergence of new, less tangible types of risk have 
given rise everywhere to a wait-and-see attitude, and indeed 
tomistrnst and withdrawal. As interdependence increases 
and extends beyond economics and finance to include social 
life and the environment, new divisions are appearing— 
both between states and within national commnnities. 
Poverty and exclusion are growing. Rather than broaden- 
ing onr horizons, the change in our relationship with things 
both far and near either makes us lose all our bearings or 
else withdraw dangerously into ourselves. What Bill Gates 
blithely calls “friction-free capitalism” is clearly liable to 
increase marginalization and inequality.

### 110449: Africa and the world

Africa and 
the world 
I am not blaming the proeess of globalization, which in 
many respects liberalizes and even liberates, and forges 
new ties. Globalization is neither good nor bad. It is what the 
human community makes of it—further proof that good for- 
tune smiles on the rich, the selfish and the cynical, or else 
a sign that justice, dignity and solidarity have not entirely 
disappeared from the face of the earth. It can be a great 
opportunity or a great danger. Like knowledge, it is neutral 
by nature and takes on meaning and value from the way it 
is used. 
There is only one world, yet there are so many differ- 
ences, sich lack of symmetry, so many contrasts. The gap 
between rich and poor in this “smaller” world is constantly 
widening. In what we coyly describe as the “least developed 
countries”, and especially in Africa, poverty is growing 
worse. Their share of world trade is still tiny. In some eases, 
economic marginalization goes hand-in-hand with social dis- 
integration, spiralling violence and increases in armed con- 
flicts, and sometimes countries lapse into frandulent prac- 
tices. Other countries, on the other hand, have developed 
political and economic capacities which open np new pos- 
sibilities in their relations with foreign partners. 
There are therefore countless situations and very dif- 
ferent levels of development. llowever, the economies of the 
developing countries, where three-quarters of the world’s 
population live, account for less than 10 per cent of gross 
world produet. Africa—which is certainly not lacking in 
resources—accounts for less than 3 per cent of this gross 
product and its share of world trade is less than 2 per cent. 
The international economic context accordingly continues 
to be characterized by enormous disparities that are fraught 
with risk and conflict. These disparities seem to grow even

worse within countries themselves, contributing to an 
increase in the risks of social upheaval and threatening the 
stability of a large number of African countries. 
Africa: globalization’s forgotten continent? 
The study of recent developments and the extrapolation 
of trends in several fields do not encourage optimism. From 
the standpoint of the balance between population and 
resources, the situation in tropical Africa is disastrous as far 
as the immediate future is concerned, since population 
growth will remain high for several decades, while a large 
proportion of the region’s 
lateritic soil is irretrievably 
exhausted and rules out 
any increase in agricultural 
production. 
In spite of striking exam- 
ples to the contrary like that 
of South Africa, as far as 
civil peace is concerned, we 
know what the situation is in 
Algeria, in the Great Lakes 
region and in other regions 
where there are a host of 
latent or low-intensity con- 
flicts. What are sometimes 
known as the “new African =~ A 
dominoes” remain largely 
unpredictable, at least to the outside observer puzzled by the 
logic of African wars. 
The picture as regards democracy is mixed. It is true 
that the on-going democratic reforms give the impression 
that the process is irreversible. Since 1990, more than 
twenty African countries have held free elections. This is 
enormous progress compared with the early decades fol- 
lowing independence. But the progress of “African democ- 
ratization” is uneven and the results are varied. What is 
more, democracy is a culture in itself, which cannot be 
improvised or expected to take root after only a few years. 
In a region like Africa, the demise of traditional social sys- 
tems and the weakening of religious authority can, even with 
the best of intentions, leave the door open to the most neg- 
ative aspects of tribalism and dictatorship.

The crisis which the continent is currently going through 
is also, to a significant degree, institutional, Macro-eco- 
nomic stabilization, no matter how necessary it may be, will 
always beinadequateifitisnot accompanied by a strength- 
ening of the African state. How is it possible for an effective 
and pro-active state, playing a key role in the necessary 
reforms, to emerge in order to ensure that economic devel- 
opment will be in harmony with a country’s society and 
culture? In fact, in many cases, it lies with societies and 
cultures in the plural, since colonially-created divisions 
of territories have been instrumental in causing the cultural 
fragmentation that is com- 
mon in Africa. 
How can a state under 
the rule of law be encour- 
aged and supported so as to 
create the conditions for 
development, for the reduc- 
tion of inequality and the 
rolling-back of poverty? It 
can be done by placing more 
cinphasis on the institutional 
aspect of co-operation and 
by strengthening political 
relations between the rich 
countries and Africa. The 
~~ [failure of strnetural adjust- 
ment policies will at lcast 
have confirmed one thing: that far from general solutions 
presented as recipes or panaceas, it is necessary to know, 
analyse and understand the specific individual paths taken 
by the African countries. Even in instances where some 
countries in the same cultural region may appear to have 
features in common, cach nation, perhaps more so than in 
Europe, has its own history, traditions, myths, demons and 
strong points, in short its specific characteristics. 
If these specific features are not taken into account, if 
the law of the market alone continues to rule, if liberalism 
is not accompanied by any social concern, how will Africa 
find the resources and mobilize the energy that will enable 
it to be integrated harmoniously and with dignity into the 
world scene?

The biosphere 
reserves of Senegal ji

“7 dirt road runs for several 
kilometres between two walls of tall 
golden grass broken by occasional 
burnt clearings. A hornbill takes 
off in {light. A family of wartbogs 
ambles by. This is the vast Niokolo- 
Koha National Park, created in 
Senegal in 1926 and one of the first 
in Africa. The 913,000-hectare 
park, the central part of which is 
completely protected, is adminis- 
tered under the programme for the 
management of the Upper Niger 
and Gambia river valleys. 
The importance of Niokolo- 
Koba, which contains exception- 
ally rich animal life, came to be 
seen when it was classified as a 
UNESCO biosphere reserve and a 
World Ileritage natural site in 
1981. It receives some 3,000 visi- 
tors a year and, with the neigh- 
bouring park at Badiar in Guinea, 
will soon form a large transnational 
biosphere reserve. 
SIMENTI POOL 
At Simenti, in the middle of the 
park, there is a hotel, a camp for 
game wardens and a viewing plat- 
form overlooking the wide, muddy 
Gambia river, which flows lazily 
  
between stands of bamboo linked 
to giant trees by tangles of flower- 
ing creepers. A troop of green mon- 
keys scamper about in them. Fur- 
ther away, on a sand spit, are a fish 
eagle and a herd of guib (tragela- 
phus), a species of harnessed ante- 
lope with a white-spotted or 
striped coat. 
The pool at Simenti—a natural 
depression of stagnant water 
formed at a bend in the river—is 
replenished in the dry season by 
pumping. A large number of ani- 
mals go there to drink. During the 
dry scason the last traces of green- 
ery are also to be found there. 
From the viewing platform, all 
kinds of antelopes (giant or Derby 
eland, roan antelope, Buffon’s kob 
and Defassa waterbuck), warthogs 
and aquatic birds can be seen. The 
common cnemy here is mimosa 
pigra, a prickly thorn bush which 
is slowly encroaching on the grass 
on which the animals live. Ele- 
phants, lions and panthers also 
roam the park. Unfortunately, 
poaching is widespread. Shortly 
before L arrived, the game wardens 
had rescued a pair of baby pan- 
thers whose mother had heen shot. 
They are now living in captivity at 
the camp, but lack of funds means 
they have to feed on a dict of only 
onc goat every three days! 
OPEN AND 
LATENT WARFARE 
Poachers keep the 150 game war- 
dens on a war footing. Already 
eight wardens have been shot dead 
and five others wounded. Three 
soldiers have also been killed. The 
day we were leaving, poachers were 
reported nearby. low did the

game wardens spot them in the 
dense vegetation? They found 
bicycle tyre marks in the ashes of 
a clearing where a fire had been 
lit to help the pasture to grow 
back. ITunters, who spend months 
at a time in very remote areas, 
obtain water and food from vil- 
lagers who travel around on hicy- 
cles and in return take hack 
slaughtered game to their villages. 
The poachers are better armed 
than the game wardens. More than 
93 per cent of the wardens are also 
due to retire in 2002, which wor- 
ries Lieutenant Boucar Ndiaye. 
Unless new ones are engaged, there 
will only be ten wardens to wateh 
over almost a million heetares. 
Money is a big problem. The war- 
dens have only three vehicles with 
badly worn tyres, no radios and not 
even a chainsaw. 
The situation is the same on the 
Guinean side. Fifty game wardens

also new, is gradually losing all its 
wildlife to hunting by people from 
nearby villages, many of whom have 
kept the weapons which the late 
dictator Ahmed Sékou Touré dis- 
tributed to people’s militias. 
BITTERNESS AND POVERTY 
The biggest enemy of eonservation 
efforts in both Senegal and Guinea 
is poverty. llow can you tell a man 
whose children are hungry that he 
must not kill the antelope or 
guinea fowl he comes across? 
When the Niokolo park was 
ereated, five villages inside its 
boundaries were moved fifty kilo- 
metres away. The villagers are still 
bitter abont this. In the park, the 
soil was richer, the yield from 
orchards was at its peak and hunt- 
ing flourished. They had to leave 
their ancestral cemeteries behind

aware of the problem. “We now 
have to make up for past mis- 
takes,” he says. But how? “We 
can’t bring the villagers back,” says 
Lieutenant Ndiaye. “If we did, in 
less than two years there wouldn’t 
be a single animal let in the park.” 
MICRO-PROJECTS AND 
DEVELOPMENT 
A considerable effort is being made 
in both Senegal and Guinea to 
develop micro-projects in villages 
on the edge of the parksin a bid to 
compensate for the frustration of 
the inhabitants. This inclndes rats-

» drained tree, which takes 20 years 
to grow to its full height and can 
live as long as 70 years, quickly 
dies. Everything about this palm 
tree species is useful—its wood is 
good for timber, its leaves for roofs 
and its stalks for fences and fur- 
niture. Its fruit can be eaten raw or 
grilled. All these uses are a threat 
to its survival. Even though heavy 
fines and even prison sentences can 
be imposed for cutting down the 
trees, felling continues. 
The central area of the Samba 
Dia biosphere consists of a pro- 
tected palm forest which has for- 
tunately been saved from tle 
woodcutters. No poachers are 
found there either “because there 
is no game,” says Abdul Diallo, who 
supervises the forest without the 
help of a vehicle or even a tele- 
phone. lle relies on inter-village 
watch committees who let him 
know of any illegal felling. 
The reserve’s buffer zone is by 
contrast an uncontrolled mix of 
farming activity. The outer area is 
ina very poor state. Despite a han,

WHAT ARE BIOSPHERE RESERVES? 
Biosphere reserves are geographic areas considered typical of the balanced relationship between 
people and nature. As of April 1997, 337 Reserves in 85 countries met the criteria for this desig- 
nation laid down within Unesco’s “Man and the Biosphere” (MAB) Programme. They combine three 
functions: 
« safeguarding samples of the earth’s landscapes, plant and animal species and ecosystems; 
= fostering economic development that is ecologically and culturally sustainable; 
« providing support for research, monitoring, training and education relating to local, regional 
and global conservation Issues. 
The reserves form a world network within which information, experience and personnel are 
exchanged. They contribute to meeting the objectives of the Convention on Biological Diversity 
and the Agenda 21 Programme that resulted from the 1992 United Nations Conference on Envi- 
ronment and Development held in Rio de Janeiro. 
HOW ARE THEY ORGANIZED? 
A core area needs to be legally established and ensure long-term protection for the landscape, 
ecosystem and species it contains. 
The limits of a buffer zone around the core must be clearly demarcated. Human activities in this 
area should not run counter to the conservation objectives of the core area. This may be an area 
for experimental research into appropriate methods of managing the ecosystem. 
A transition area, or area of co-operation, extends outwards from the reserve. It is here that local 
communities and other stakeholders must agree to work together to manage and develop the area’s 
resources on a sustainable basis. 
For fuller details, see “The world network of biosphere reserves” in the May 1997 
issue of the Unesco Courrer, Landscape with Figures (pp. 36-37).

includes the dry forest of Fathala, 
which has splendid trees but little 
animal life. Its manager, Major 
Jacques Rigoulot, who was already 
in charge of the area before the 
Senegalese army took it over as a 
training ground, has been recalled 
to carry out an almost impossible 
mission. [lis task is to rebuild the 
burned-down camp, close the 
twenty sawmills-cum-woodwork 
factories in the area and set up 
partnerships with the villages on 
the edge of the reserve. 
The taxes levied on gathering 
dead wood have earned the villages 
a million CFA francs ($1,700) in 
ten months—a lot of money in 
Senegal—which paid for improve- 
ments in water supply, schools and 
clinics. But Rigoulot is bitter. 
Thereis no longer a drop of drink- 
ing water in the reserve since its 
single well was contaminated by 
sea water, and he has no money to 
dig another one. He also badly 
needs solar panels to provide 
energy for lighting. 
However, the results of work- 
ing with the local communities 
have been very positive. In the vil- 
lage of Bakadadji, inside the 
reserve, Rigoulot helps women to 
harvest oysters, whose roasted 
shells make good-quality bricks. 
Like his opposite number at 
Samba Dia, Abdul Diallo, he (and 
the village women) could do with 
some kind of transport—a boat, 
for example, since four-fifths of 
the reserve consists of mangroves, 
inlets and islands. 
On the edge of the reserve, just 
as at Niokolo, vast areas—some- 
times whole islands, which are the 
homes of birds—have been leased 
to foreigners. The local population 
derives no benefit from this, except 
in the form of payment for guides. 
Lieutenant Ndiaye says that if the 
villagers were the only people 
allowed to hunt, poaching would 
certainly be reduced. But defend- 
ing nature is an uphill job that is 
made even harder by lack of 
resources. This makes the deter- 
mination of Boucar Ndiaye, Abdul 
Diallo and Jacques Rigoulot all 
the more impressive. n

EL VIEJO 
THE TORNADO-MAKER 
After studying 35,000 tornadoes 
that have hit the United States 
since 1950, two researchers have 
discovered a direct link between 
tornadoes and a cold Pacific cur- 
rent known as El Viejo or La Nina, 
the opposite of the better-known 
warm El Nifio. When the waters off 
Peru cool by only 1° Fahrenheit 
(3/4 of a degree Celsius) com- 
pared with their average temper- 
ature, El Viejo sets in motion a jet 
stream pattern that carries moist 
air from the Gulf of Mexico to the 
Ohio Valley, where it clashes with 
cold air from Canada and triggers 
off tornadoes. 
According to the two resear- 
chers, the probability of having four 
or more springtime tornadoes in 
the area ranging from Michigan 
to Alabama increases by 300 to 
500 per cent when El Viejo is 
active in the Pacific in the previ- 
ous winter. They also discovered 
that when El Nino warms the 
waters of the Pacific off South 
America, there is a significant 
reduction in tornado activity in the 
states of Texas, Louisiana, Okla- 
homa, Kansas and Arkansas— 
known as “tornado alley”. n 
AMPHIBIAN 50S 
Frogs, toads and salamanders are 
vanishing from all parts of the 
globe. Not enly are these very com- 
mon amphibians victims of the dry- 
ing-out of wetlands and the intro- 
duction of alien predators, they are 
also on the decline in protected 
areas. What 1s more, growing num- 
 
bers of congenital malformations 
are found in all three groups. 
Researchers suspect factors such 
as acid rain, ultraviolet-B radiation, 
which now penetrates the depleted 
ozone layer more easily, and pes- 
ticides. More than 500 teams of 
scientists all over the world are 
working flat out to understand what 
the frogs are trying to tell us, before

When public services in Dhaka 
(Bangladesh) could no longer pro- 
vide satisfactory waste collection 
facilities, two volunteers from the 
Kalagaban district, where the 
problem was particularly acute, 
began offering a parallel service in 
return for a small financial contri- 
bution from the households 
served. Rickshaw van-drivers sort 
the waste for bones, polythene 
bags, paper, plastics and metals, 
then sell what they collect to rele- 
vant industries, thereby adding a 
little extra to their monthly pay-

In Gambia, discarded worn-out bat-

placed metal containers at strate- 
gic points for use by the general 
public. This initiative was sug- 
gested by a woman living in the 
suburb of Kololi, who asked 
schoolchildren to bring her bat- 
teries in return for a small sum of 
money. She stored the battenes 
at her home until a suitable dump 
could be set up. © 
CORRUGATED 
SHEETING 
A factory near Cotonou (Benin) will 
soon be producing plant-derived 
polyol in order to make corrugated 
sheeting. Polyol is usually a deriv- 
ative of oil and goes into the pro- 
duction of a common plastic, 
polyurethane. In this case the oil 
will be replaced by locally-pro- 
duced palm, cotton and shea oils. 
Since all corrugated sheeting is

### 110452: Music from South Africa

© Listening Sibel 
South African traditional popular music has taken the international music scene by storm 
These days South African music is known all 
over the world. It emerged on the interna- 
tional scene at the end of the 1960s with Myriam 
Makeba and Hugh Masakela and really took off 
after apartheid was abolished. 
Now we have the wonderfnl sounds of Joseph 
Shabalala’s a cappella Ladysmith Black Mamhazo 
croup, Mahlathini and the vivacious Mahotella 
Queens, the lively jazz of Dollar Brand, Chris 
McGregor, Dudn Pukwana, Jonas Gwangwa and 
Bheki Mseleku, as well as the dynamic mnltiracial 
gronp Juluka, led by Johnny Clegg and Sipho 
Mchunu. 
Influenced by gospel and soul music, the 
ancient indigenous choral traditions—especially 
among the Znlu and the Xhosa—developed rich 
vocal harmonies which are the basis of the coun- 
try’s modern popular music. 
The black townships—artificial ghettos swollen 
by migrants from the countryside who were forcibly 
resettled under apartheid—are especially fertile 
eround for musicians. Soweto, for example, is one 
of the most lively musical centres in the country, 
where the mbaganga, a combination of South 
African rhythms, jazz, soul and old European tunes, 
with a throhbing bass sound, is still very popular. 
The Africa Cultural Centre 
Last summer, the Musiques de Nuit festival in 
Franee invited nineteen young musicians, dancers 
and artists from Johannesburg’s Africa Cultural 
Centre to come and run workshops for teenagers 
in various suburhs of Bordeaux. They also orga- 
nized discussion groups on philosophical and 
humanistic subjects. 
The Centre, a lively cultural spot and symbol 
of liberated Africa, was founded in the 1980s in the 
west Johannesburg suburlh of Newton Bay by 
Benjy Francis, a man of the theatre who was born 
in a Durban township in the year apartheid was offi- 
cially introduced. Since the end of the 1970s, he 
has been the standard-bearer of rebellious Dlack 
culture, along with others like the producer Bar- 
ney Simon, After the Soweto massacre of 1976, 
Francis decided “to give the struggle another 
dimension with new cultural projects.” 
With limited resources, he founded the Mar- 
© THE UNESCO Gourier MB FEBRUARY 1998 
ket Theatre, which started out in the street before 
becoming what is now the Centre a few years later. 
It was shut down several times by the authorities, 
but survived thanks to the perseverance of Fran- 
cis and to funding by progressive organizations. 
Its repertoire was then expanded to include other 
disciplines and several artists gave their time freely. 
In 1980, Francis opened an artists’ centre to 
encourage exchanges between various forms of 
expression, and the Africa Cultural Centre grew 
out of this initiative. A repertoire of South African 
plays was put together, notably Duzaka’s Night of 
the Long Wake. 
The Centre is well known in Johannesburg but 
also organizes courses and workshops in other 
towns, teaching music, dance (traditional and hip- 
hop), percussion, drama and the plastic arts. The 
aim, says Francis, a colourful figure with a beard 
and a beret, is “to channel young people’s energies 
towards artistic expression which can free them. We 
are offering our approach and we are ready to 
learn as well. We don’t close our doors, we don’t 
commercialize and we don’t downsize our dreams.” 
Citing the example of Nelson Mandela, Francis 
opts for dialogue rather than confrontation, for 
tolerance and openness rather than revenge and 
hostility. Two years ago, the Centre staged Africus, 
the continent’s first biennial modern art exhibi- 
tion, on the theme of “Let’s decolonize our Minds”. 
In 1994, the Centre opened its Children’s 
Museum, which will soon have a scientific section 
and a library. The Centre has also welcomed per- 
formers such as Whitney Houston and organized a 
children’s parade (“Heal IIumanity”) aimed at 
encouraging young people’s creativity. Francis is 
likewise planning to launch a social awareness 
project, to look at problems like battered children, 
poverty, hunger and teenage pregnancy. 
Last autumn, the Cité de la Musique in Paris 
welcomed some other South African musicians, 
who also displayed the country’s cultural rich- 
ness and diversity. They included the Nzalabantu 
Choir, a physically striking group of traditional 
female singers from Kwazulu Natal who usually 
perform at initiation rites, marriages and village 
festivals. There was also the diva Sibongile Khu- 
malo, who comes from the same part of the coun-

try but grew up in Soweto. Accompanied by a 
quartet featuring the talented young jazz pianist 
Moses Mololekwa, she sings [rom a repertoire which 
blends the lyrical with traditional Zulu chants. 
There was also a troupe of ingoma dancers (the 
Lamontville Group) and the Shukuma Black Mam- 
bazo All Star Flutes. 
Choirs, dances and penny whistles 
On Sundays, ingoma, a collection of dances that 
tales its name from a drum, is put on by Zulu min- 
ers living in the mine hostels. The songs and 
dances, which hark back to those of ancestral war- 
riors and are warlike and initiatory, are performed 
to the accompaniment of a large drum made of a 
double cowhide stretched over a metal oil drum. 
Lamontville, after the name of a Durban town- 
ship, is a group of young dancers who keep alive 
the famous gumboot dance beloved of Znlu work-

ers during their leisure time. The dancers wear 
rubber boots adorned with tinkling bottle caps 
which they slap with their hands. The rhythm of the 
steps, the hand-slapping and the shouts and exhor- 
tations of the gronp’s leader are the only musical 
accompaniment. 
The Shukuma Black Mambazo All-Star Flutes, 
which blossomed in the Johanneshurg township 
of Alexandra between 1956 and 1963, came 
together again specially for the Paris concert. With 
acoustic guitars and penny whistles, they recreate 
the sound of the kicela groups. Kwela! in Zulu 
means “scram!” and is used to warn that the police 
are coming. This musical style, popular in the 
1940s and 1950s, is a street version of township 
jazz. It has gathered other instruments along the 
way, such as the saxophone, electric guitar, bass 
and piano, and influenced many performers, 
including Myriam Makeba. |

The old town of Banska Stiavnica, 
in the heart of the Carpathian mountains, was 
once a nucleus of the European mining industry. 
Its remarkable architectural and technological 
monuments earned it a place on the World 
Heritage List in 1993. 
guarding his flock one day saw a 
lizard covered in flakes of gold 
and immediately spread the news 
of this extraordinary sight, At 
that time the local people laeked 
the teclmical skills and resources 
necessary for extracting the gold 
and silver buried deep in the 
mountain, and the mines, some of 
which were on the surface, were 
probably first worked by the Celts 
a century or two before the mod- 
ern era. The Celis even minted 
coins known as biatecs, weighing 
16 grams cach. A large number of 
these have heen found at some fif - 
teen sites, espeeially in the eoun- 
try’s western regions. The Slavs, 
who arrived in the region later, 
continued extracting the precious 
metals and traded in them. 
A twelfth-century document 
shows that the Banska Stiavniea 
region, in Slovakia’s heartland, 
was known as the “land of min- 
ers”. After having settled in the   
   el 
Carpathian Mountains for over a 
century, the Hungarians ineorpo- 
rated Banska Stiavnica into their 
kingdom, which eventually 
extended to the shores of the 
Adriatic. They were quick to 
grasp the benefits they conld reap 
from mining the rich veins of gold, 
silver and eopper that stretched 
for kilometre after kilometre. 
In order to work the mines 
intensively, they bronght in Ger- 
man settlers, whose expertise in 
the held was famed thronghont 
Europe. To make sure they 
stayed, King Bela IV allowed 
then a series of privileges, espe- 
cially the freedon to trade, which 
he set ont in 1238 in a special 
charter granted to Banska. A few 
years later, when the area was dev- 
astated by the Mongols, the Ger- 
man and Slovak inhabitants were 
given permission to build fortifi- 
cations to proteet themselves from 
future attack. Mindful of their

own interests, the Inngarian 
rulers built a fortified enclave for 
themselves in the upper part of 
the town, the remains of which 
are still visible today. It was here 
that they collected taxes and 
received their due share of the 
proceeds from mining. 
PIONEERING 
TECHNOLOGY 
By the Middle Ages Banska 
Stiavnica was producing 20 per 
cent of the silver circulating on the 
world market, as well as large 
quantities of gold for export to var- 
ious parts of Europe, especially 
Germany and Flanders. Two eities 
further north, Gremmica and Ban- 
skid Bystrica, also rich in precious 
metals, flourished at the same 
time. Growing everricher, the Ger- 
man colonists and the ITungarian 
nobility began building Catholic 
and Protestant churches and 
    
stately palaces and mansions that 
were the glory of the kingdom. 
Alter the Battle of Mohacs in 
1526 in which the Magyar army 
was defeated, the Turks occupied 
Buda and began making armed 
forays into the interior of Slova- 
kia, then known as Upper Itun- 
gary. Even so, they were never able 
to lay their hands on the gold and 
silver mines. With support from 
the forces of Count Nicholas 
Pallly, the inhabitants of Banska 
Stiavnica succeeded in repelling 
the foreign invaders in 1593 only 
a few kilometres from the town. 
In 1627, explosives were used 
(for the first time for such a pur- 
pose in Europe) to extract ore from 
the mountain. In the seventeenth 
century two local engineers per- 
fected a mechanical pumping sys- 
tem which improved the silver 
extraction process by creating some 
sixty artificiatlakes to drain off the 
water that was forever threatening 
to flood the mines. About twenty of 
them still exist, and the Slovaks 
bathe in them during the summer 
months. In the eighteenth century 
Banské Stiavnica became the Euro- 
pean centre of mining technology 
and expertise. In 1762, Maria 
Theresa, Empress of Austria and 
Queen of ITungary, founded a Min- 
ing Academy there. The first of its 
kind in the world, it attracted cel- 
ehrated teachers from all over 
Europe. One of the founders of 
modern chemistry, Antoine Lau- 
rent de Lavoisier, gave it his sup- 
port. The Academy’s reputation 
was such that it served as a model 
for the Ecole Polytechnique in 
Paris. 
However, by the end of the nine- 
teenth eentury the mines were no 
longer profitable. Today there are 
amere 10,600 people living in Ban- 
skd Stiavniea, and only a [ew of the 
region's slender gold and silver veins 
are still mined. Despite wars,

Banska Stiavnica, Slovakia’s oldest mining 
town, lies on the steep slopes of the Glanzenberg 
in the Paradajz Mountains. 
Its ores have been worked since the Bronze 
Age (10th-8th centuries B.C.) and mining only 
ceased at the end of the 19th century. 
The city and the technical plant in the 
surrounding area illustrate a remarkable 
symbiosis between the urban environment and 
the natural habitat. 
MW State-of-the-art technology 
In the 17th century Banska Stiavnica saw a large 
number of technological advances. Gunpowder 
was used in the mines for the first time. In the 
field of hydraulic energy, a system of dams and 
weirs was built in the 18th century to wash the 
ore. This system was adopted all over the world 
and remained the most advanced of its kind right 
into the 19th century. 
WM Reservoirs and dams 
About 20 reservoirs have survived, the oldest of 
which, Velka Vodarenska, was built in 1510.

devoted to the region’s history, 
especially the struggles against 
the Ottoman army. 1t also contains 
many mementoes from the six- 
teenth and seventeenth centuries. 
Other churches, chapels,

Three others date from the 16th century and two 
more from the 17th century. Most of them were 
built in the 18th century, a period of intense 
mining activity in the town. 
There is also a series of dams—the longest of 
which is nearly 775 metres long—and water- 
collecting channels. 
HM Factories and mines 
Two remarkable drainage galleries still exist: the 
Beiber, begun in the 14th century, is the oldest 
known example of its kind. The Voznicka gallery, 
which is over a kilometre long, was the world’s 
longest when it was inaugurated in 1878. 
There are also several surface ore deposits. 
The mine building and the Mayer machine room 
(begun in 1805) are still standing. 
Also still standing is a silver and lead smelting 
plant which dates from the first half of the 17th 
century and was modernized in 1872. It was one of 
the buildings belonging to the world’s first factory 
producing machine-made metal cable (1837). Last 
but not least, the mine museum houses a number of 
items of equipment from the region.

interview 
WM How did you get into films? 
Abbas Kiarostami: My roots were in graphic art; 1 
branched ontinto cinema quite by chance. Graphic 
art is a kind of minimalist art in which one has to 
communicate an idea in a precise and agrecable 
form using great economy of means. I learned to 
live with the constraints of graphic art, and this 
helped me to aceept eonstraints in general and use 
them in my films. My son wants to be a film-maker 
but Thave advised him to learn graphics first. 
While I was a graphic artist, I started making 
advertising films as well. In advertising films, you 
have only thirty seconds or a minute to get a mes- 
sage across. You have to know your target audi- 
ence very well: you have to know how people act and 
react: you have to know all about marketing, When 
yout have to condense a message into one short 
minute, you learn what a minute really is. Making 
advertising films gave me an opportunity to learn all 
about film-making before getting into real cinema. 
Today I do everything in my films: [ write the seript, 
visualize the scenes with sketches, direct, supervise 
the sonud and its mixing, choose the music and 
take care of the montage. 
HM What are the possibilities of cinema? 
A. K.: To my mind cinema offers greater possibili- 
ties for self-expression than any other art. 
Absolutely anything can be depicted iu cinema and 
this is not really possible in the other arts. In a film 
you can use silenee or darkness, for instance, to 
great effect. At the end of my latest film, The Taste 
of Cherry, the central character, Mr. Badii, goes 
down into a pit and lies down. The moon disap- 
pears behind clouds and everything fades into dark- 
ness. For a whole minute nothing is shown on the

Abbas Kiarostami 
 
The work of Iranian film 
director Abbas 
Kiarostamiwon an 
international accolade in 
1997 when his latest 
film, The Taste of Cherry, 
was awarded the Golden 
Palm at the Cannes Film 
Festival. Two years 
before, the Locarno 
Festival had organized a 
retrospective of all his 
work, which 1s notable 
for its imaginative range 
and humanity. In this 
interview with Romain 
Maitra, Abbas Kiarostami 
looks back over his 
career and describes his 
approach to film-making. 
magical power, cinema is a remarkable instrument 
for stimulating wonder and casting doubt on the 
most deeply rooted ideas. 
HM Are there any images or ideas you are not 
allowed to show when you make films in Iran? 
A.K.: The kind of violent scenes that appear in 
movies all over the world are prohibited in the Iran- 
ian einema, where it is also virtually impossible to 
make any reference to sexuality. Wherever in the 
world my films are set, I can never make any allusion 
to sex in them. 
In Iran, you cannot hold your wife’s hand in the 
street. In a movie, if a woman falls down in the 
street, she can only be helped up by another woman 
because touching is involved. And so if you see a 
woman tumble in an Iranian film don’t be shocked 
if a man happens to be standing nearby but docs 
nothing to help. It's not that he’s unwilling to lift 
the woman baek onto her feet but that he is not 
supposed to do so. Don’t be shocked if you sec a 
woman drowning in a swimming pool or a lake and 
a man is standing around doing nothing. He’s not 
allowed to do anything. In real life maybe he would 
step in, but notin a movie. It’s not that Iranian peo- 
ple are eold-blooded—it’s just a limitation imposed 
on Iranian cinema. Don’t he surprised if you see in 
an Iranian film a woman wake up in bed wearing 
her chador. Inreal life this is absurd, but in the cin- 
ema women have to wear a chador all the time. It 
is forbidden to show dancing and drinking alco- 
lol—but not smoking—in the cinema. 
To reeeive an exhibition permit in the 1980s, all 
films had to go through a four-stage process involv- 
ing approval of the synopsis, seript, cast and erew, 
and the final film. The situation has not changed 
much sinee then. Although political and social erit-

icism is uot unknown in films, care is taken not to 
displease the clerical establishment. Ironically, how- 
ever, prohibitions of this kind have lielped the Iran- 
ian cinema to achieve success internationally because 
it has always had to face the challenge of not show- 
ing certain things or inding inventive ways of express- 
ing them. The pressure has slackened a little since 
the new government took over recently and one hopes 
that film-makers will now have more freedom. 
M Are Iranian films widely distributed outside Iran? 
A.K.: I think Iranian cinema today is well placed 
internationally. Few countries from my part of the 
world make films that have the kind of worldwide 
distribution that ours have, not to speak of appre- 
ciation {rom international eritics. Only recently 
Iranian film-makers have won four prizes at tuter- 
national film festivals. My The Taste of Cherry won 
the Golden Palin award at the Cannes Film Festi- 
val, Jaffar Panahi’s “Mirror” won the Golden Leop- 
ard at the Loearno Festival, and at the Montreal 
Festival Majid Majidi won first prize for direction, 
as well as four other awards, for his film “Children 
of Heaven”. Even more recently Parwiz Shahabazi 
won first prize in the young film-maker category 
for his film “Traveller from the South” at the Tokyo 
Film Festival. This is something very new for Iran. 
Compare our situation with that of China. China 
was on the verge of the same kind of breakthrough 
three years ago. But Chinese films were often pro- 
dnced in America and many Chinese (ilm-makers 
depended on American finance. These films were 
given an American-style treatment and lost their 
Chinese flavour: American financing changed the 
whole strueture of Chinese filins. Iranian einema, 
on the other hand, may lack technical rigour, finance 
to mount expensive productions, and access to net- 
works but it has one invaluable advantage—ideas. 
Besides, the [act that American films are not dis- 
tributed in Iran is a blessing in disguise because it 
means that our film industry has heen protected 
from stiff competition. What’s more, the commercial 
success of high-quality Iranian films has led banks 
to offer long-term loans for film production, thus 
placing the industry on a more secular basis. 
BM The main character in The Taste of Cherry 
decides to take his life. How did you come to make a 
film about suicide? 
A.K.: There were a number of reasons. Firstly, sta- 
tistics show that very few suicide attempts are sue- 
cessful; in other words the desire to live is a lot 
more powerful than the desire to die. Secondly, 
all religions strongly disapprove of suicide and what 
is forbidden naturally attraets euriosity and is 
worth looking at closely. We should be free to ask 
the question: “Must | eontinne to live or not?” 
Life 1s a choice and not a sentence, but often we 
do not realize this. When we accept life as a bun- 
dle of constraints we are actually making a chotee. 
I want to tell people: if yon choose to live, then do 
it well. So niany people are standing by the exit

door: they neither take part in life wholeheartedly 
nor leave it. They live in the shadow of death. 
Let us not pass judgment on the act of suicide. 
It may be an act of violence, but in my film it is 
accompanied by eritical enquiry. Mr. Badii wants to 
communicate with people; otherwise he could have 
quictly ended his Life in bed by taking sleeping 
pills. But the really important thing is that life 
goes om, that there is an nuending ey cle in which 
nature sheds its old shircand grows a new one. This 
is more important than wanting to know whether a 
characteris alive or dead at the end of the film. 
Actually the film has more to do with life and 
death than with suicide and that is not a new sub- 
ject for me. Three of my lilms—Where is My 
Friends Home? (1987), And Life Goes On (1992) 
and Through the Olive Trees (1991)—are shown as 
a trilogy beeause they were shot in the same loca- 
tion. But if you replace Where ts My Friend's 
Ilome? with The Taste of Cherry, it makes another 
trilogy whose theme is the fight for life and aware- 
ness of death, appreciating life and accepting 
responsibility for it while knowing that the exit 
door is just round the corner. The Romanian writer 
E. M. Cioran onee said, “Without the possibility of 
suicide, I wonld have committed suicide quite a few 
years ago.” 
HM Did you have problems dealing with this issue? 
AK. Itis true that in Iran suicide is forbidden by 
Quranic law. Catholics too are strongly opposed 
to suicide. But there are also other people in the 
world who are not religious, and besides, religious 
laws and those who uphold them may not always 
have respeet for our lives. In Tran we have a religion 
with two parallel streams: one is devoid of the spirit 
of enquiry and flows backwards; the other is more 
developed and accepts enquiring minds. 
HM In your work the plot of one film often blends 
imperceptibly into that of another.... 
A.K.: Yes. This is particularly true of my latest 
trilogy in whieh each film emerges from the previ- 
ots one inch like a Russian doll. My films never tell 
a story which begins at one point and ends at 
another. A new story always begins somewhere along 
the way. And the stories are blended together to 
such an extent that it’s impossible to separate 
them. In fact they are all part of a single story. 
Another thing: I think it’s important that film-mak- 
ers should leave their films somewhat incomplete so 
that spectators can complete them using their own 
imagination. 
M Nature is a constant presence in your films. 
AK.: Yes. Weare separated from nature bnt we are 
part of it. Industrialization and progress have not 
really come to our resene. To rediscover ourselves, 
we nust go hack to nature. In The Taste of Cherry, 
1 tried to show the gradual encroachment of the 
industrial landscape and people’s relation to it.

» hand and is being eaten up by expanding cities. 
The old taxidermist in the museum says to Mr. 
Badii: “Are you in despair? ITave you never looked 
at the moon? Don’t you want to see the stars? And 
the nights of the full moon? Don’t yon want to hear 
the whisper of the rain, the song of the nightin- 
sale? You want to close your eyes? My dear feHow, 
you should see all these things! Those who live in 
the other world want to come over here to see, and 
you want to hurry to go there?” 
BH What do you think of the violence that pervades 
cinema today? 
A.K.: Violence, like kindness, is a part of human 
beings, and as long as it exists it is probably neces- 
sary to show it. But there is a difference between vio- 
lence as it exists and violence as it is expressed in 
films. 1 think violence tends to he artificially treated 
in the cinema. The kind of violence that prevails in 
real life is cold, grey violence but it is shown in eiu- 
ema in red-hot blood and guts form. We have seen so 
much of this fake violence that its so-called magic 
does not work any more. But the merchants of vio- 
lence go on making fortunes ont of conjuring up a 
phantasm of this impulse that is inside everybody 
and rooted in soeiety. For twenty years most main- 
stream cinema has not shown violence as it really is. 
Violence was not treated like this in the past. In 
Fritz Lang's The Big Heat (1953), for example, itis 
completely internalized so that enormous tension is 
built up. The French director Claude Santet’s 
Classe Tous Risques (1960) also explored the psy- 
chology of violence with great skill and emotional 
realism. But what we sce now is professional vio- 
lence-mongering for its own sake. The irony is that 
nobody likes violence but everybody goes to see it. 
HB How do you feel about winning the Golden Palm 
at the 1997 Cannes Festival and Unesco’s Federico 
Fellini Gold Medal later in the year? Will these 
awards help your career? 
A.K.: They certainly will. Tam very proud and happy 
that such prizes have been awarded to my kind of 
cinema. The fact that such valuable awards are 
coming my way is very important becanse they 
encourage {iln-makers to carry on producing “dif- 
ferenteinema™, cinema with a personal touch. They 
will attract audiences to come and see this kind of 
cinema and give it greater prestige. Good cinema 
cannot exist without an audience. 
BW Who are your favourite film-makers? 
A.K.: Tlike cinema which has roots in reality and yet 
also explores dreams. There are many film-makers 
I like, but if I had to name one it would be Yasn- 
jiro Ozu of Japan. 
B How should the cause of non-commercial 
cinema he defended today? 
A.K.: Mueh commercial cinema is churned out in 
response to market forces. But this process con- 
tains the seeds of its own destruction because there 
is a limit to what people can take. The gap between 
this kind of cinema and the reality of normal life has 
become so great that people do not recognize them- 
selves any more in this kind of filin. 
There is not much to be done to counter this 
trend; it is going to self-destrnet. I certainly hope 
that a different kind of cinema will come into its own 
and that real cinema will put a stop to fake cinema. 
To help this to come about, it is erucial that this 
new cinema shonld be given critical recognition. Il
