nth by month 
This year marks the fiftieth anniversary of the foundation of the United 
Nations. The occasion is not being celebrated in a notably festive atmos- 
phere. One thinks of Somalia and Rwanda, and also, constantly, of Bosnia. 
But can these failures be blamed on the United Nations as such? If the UN 
did not exist, would the situation be better or worse? 
In this issue, we review in a three-part dossier the questions that are 
quite rightly asked about the role and functions of the United Nations. The 
first part presents factual information about the UN system and how it 
works, and about important moments in its history. The second contains a 
critical analysis of the UN's achievements and failures in its three key areas 
of activity: peace-keeping, human rights and development. In the third, 
Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Secretary-General of the United Nations, and 
Mr. Federico Mayor, Director-General of Unesco, set forth their views on 
future developments. 
Many people have a persistent, nagging feeling of deep disappointment 
at the gap between what they would have liked to see and what has actually 
come to pass, especially since the fall of the Berlin Wall, the end of the bi- 
polar world, and the concomitant assertion of demands for freedom, justice 
and solidarity. 
This sense of disillusion is actually a promising sign, for it reveals the 
capital of hope which public opinion has invested in the United Nations. At 
the same time, it reflects misapprehensions about the machinery governing 
its workings. The way in which the system works is directly dependent on 
agreements and disagreements between its Member States, in other words 
between their governments—especially the most influential among them. 
What the United Nations system most cruelly lacks, and what explains the 
disappointments to which it gives rise, is an international consensus on the 
objectives and standards whereby the common interests of humanity can 
prevail over the specific interests of states or nations and ethnic or religious 
communities. 
This consensus is still a distant prospect, but it will have to be reached 
sooner or later because it is so vital to the future of humanity and the 
planet. Who can doubt that when it is finally achieved its main architect will 
have been the United Nations system? 
For all its defects, its unwieldiness and its mistakes, which mirror the 
imperfections of the international community itself, the United Nations has 
patiently authored a unique experiment in international relations and given 
rise to the feeling, amorphous though it may be, that in spite of everything 
the much-maligned skyscraper in New York is for all of us an ultimate bas- 
tion against barbarism—a forum where we know that yesterday’s enemies 
will be able to speak to each other tomorrow.

### 101203: Grounds for hope

  
Grounds for hope 
by Boutros Boutros-Ghals 
The world in which we have to carry 
out our work is radically different 
from that envisaged by the founding fathers 
of the United Nations Charter fifty years 
ago. But it is also very different from the 
world glimpsed after the fall of the Berlin 
Wall by those who predicted the coming of a 
new international political order. 
The United Nations today has to try to 
instill order in an international society that 
is simultaneously becoming both more 
globalized and more fragmented. The his- 
tory that is being made before our eyes— 
with its characteristic blend of stop-go and 
repetition—is confronting the United 
Nations with the emergence of a global 
society and a return to various kinds of 
nationalism. The United Nations is thus 
being called upon both to resolve the con- 
flicts flaring up all over the globe and to keep 
pace with the major changes taking place in 
the world. 
In a supplement to my Agenda for 
Peace* 1 have tried to draw conclusions 
from United Nations action to halt the 
armed conflicts and confrontations that 
jeopardize international security. In the past 
five years, the United Nations has under- 
taken more peace-keeping operations than in 
the previous forty. The fact is that the very 
nature of the conflicts that beset the world 
has profoundly changed. We are now having 
to contend with instances of secession, parti- 
tion, ethnic confrontation and tribal rivalry. 
What is more, UN forces now have man- 
dates that go well beyond the traditional 
idea of peace-keeping. Operations can at pre- 
sent encompass election supervision, 
humanitarian aid, the reconstruction of 
roads and bridges, mine-clearance, the dis- 
arming of militias, the repatriation of dis- 
placed persons, the reintegration of combat- 
ants into civilian life, the protection of 
human rights, the promotion of democracy 
and many other activities besides. 
We must remember all this at a time when 
there is a tendency to dwell more often on 
the Organization’s failures than on its suc- 
  
cesses. But if the United Nations is to play 
its role fully as a servant of peace, it 1s more 
than ever necessary for the Security Council 
and the Member States to define and imple- 
ment effective and consistent policies. 
Emphasis must also be placed on the role 
played by the Organization in the world’s 
economic and social development, which 
accounts for more than 70 per cent of its 
activity. i 
From the Earth Summit in Rio to the 
Cairo International Conference on Popula- 
tion and Development, from the Copen- 
hagen World Summit for Social Develop- 
ment to the Beijing Conference on Women, 
the UN seeks to rally governments and 
public opinion around the major issues of 
the coming century. 
We are all aware that the basic problems 
facing humanity are increasingly transna- 
tional in nature. 
However, the global society in which we 
now live is fraught with many dangers, 
including that of destroying traditional 
bonds of solidarity or marginalizing coun- 
tries or even whole regions of the earth, and 
hence of further widening the gap between 
rich and poor. 
We know only too well that this situa- 
tion is not without risks. Wars, exclusion, 
and ethnic and religious antagonisms always 
prosper in such a climate. Irrational and 
fanatical thinking is always prompt to pro- 
pose fallacious solutions to people who have 
lost their bearings. 
We should therefore take advantage of 
this celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of 
the United Nations to join together in 
thinking about a new blueprint for living in 
society and to offer solid grounds for hope 
to states and nations, to men and women the 
world over. | 
  
* In his Agenda for Peace (United Nations, New 
York, 1992) written at the request of the Security 
Council, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali proposes a series 
of measures for reinforcing the UN’s capabilities in 
preventive diplomacy, peace-making and peace-keeping 
and for increasing its effectiveness within the 
framework of the Charter’s provisions. (Ed.)

### 101204: Fifty years on

Fifty years on 
We all know that the inequalities 
existing in the world today are a scandal 
that must be brought to an end. We know too 
that the burden of debt must be alleviated so 
that the spiralling process whereby the poor 
continue to get poorer and the rich richer can 
be halted. We are aware of the need to promote 
lifelong vocational training and education, to 
foster scientific and technological development 
so that countries may become masters of their 
own fates, to facilitate urban renewal as well as 
rural development, to ensure that the law and 
freedom of expression are respected, that the 
independence of the judiciary is maintained 
and that democratic principles are embodied in 
everyday practice. 
So much we all know. But now is a time 
for action, in the first instance at the national 
level. It is pointless to adopt declarations, 
strategies and charters unless countries set 
themselves definite plans with precise objec- 
tives and deadlines, so as to undertake— 
while there is still time—the changes of 
direction that are now unavoidable. There 
must be changes in behaviour and attitudes 
towards the consumption of energy and raw 
materials, of production and employment 
and also of welfare. Such changes take time, 
they require sustained effort and a long-term 
outlook; but it is unfortunately difficult to 
reconcile the demands of national politics 
with medium- and long-term preoccupa- 
tions. When things too obviously go wrong 
and imbalances become too glaring, the 
powers that be prefer to recommend adjust- 
ments, and then apply corrective measures to 
offset the often devastating effects of those 
adjustments. And they take it upon them- 
selves to transpose—or even 1mpose— 
models from elsewhere instead of helping 
individual countries and peoples to work 
out their own plans for the future. 
While it is true, however, that history 
marches on, contemporary history—the his- 
tory we are living through—is not a piece of 
machinery that only needs oiling when it 
  
by Federico Mayor 
seizes up or can be improved by repeated tin- 
kering. We are dealing with the aspirations of 
billions of people throughout the world who 
need to be provided with a more tolerable 
present, and at the same time enabled to 
envisage the future as a project, respectful of 
their dignity and their culture, from which 
they may draw sustenance and to which they 
may contribute, often with a creativity that 
others better off than themselves might envy. 
This urgent need for interdependent 
action also involves a thorough-going 
reform of the United Nations system. The 
system was designed to deal with the prob- 
lems of the postwar world but it is ill pre- 
pared to meet the challenges of the present 
and the foreseeable future, which are, first 
and foremost, those of world development. 
We must in all honesty admit that the 
efforts made by the international commu- 
nity over the last fifty years to promote 
development are far from having achieved the 
desired effects. The promises made by the 
richest countries, twenty or so years ago, to 
help the development of the poorest coun- 
tries have not really been kept, while large- 
scale movements of capital and market forces 
are increasingly outside states’ control. 
The undertakings in which we have 
invested have all too often ended in failure, 
and the emphasis now placed on peace- 
keeping operations—with results that do not 
always justify the large sums of money 
poured into them—shows that the logic of 
responding to emergencies still prevails. But 
international stability and security today 
transcend the military sphere; they rely upon 
a whole set of economic, financial, political, 
educational, scientific and technological mea- 
sures that need to be worked out in concerted 
fashion and applied in good time. 
We therefore need to revise our conception 
of the role of the United Nations system 
without delay. We are spending vast amounts 
on deploying armies to “re-establish” peace 
and then on restoring, repairing and recon-

structing what has been destroyed by warfare, 
but it is war itself that we should destroy, by 
rooting out the underlying causes of conflict: 
poverty, social injustice, political oppression, 
and discrimination and exclusion in all their 
forms. The time has come to put the Charter 
in its totality into effect and to move on 
from a conception of the role of the United 
Nations whereby peace-keeping constituted 
its principal task to a more ambitious concep- 
rion, having in view the prevention of con- 
flicts and the building of peace. 
The places where peace has hitherto made 
most headway are those where societies have 
succeeded in maintaining their cohesion and 
progress while preserving respect for human 
rights, providing themselves with democ- 
ratic structures and making development a 
joint undertaking, i.e. ensuring that its fruits 
are fairly shared. Many societies today are, 
however, also under threat from faceless ene- 
mies: unemployment, poverty and exclusion 
that are becoming worse and worse from day 
to day, despite the emergency measures 
applied in some places. Even where tolerance 
used to be the order of the day, a shift 
towards xenophobia is becoming more evi- 
dent, and chauvinist or racist utterances that 
had seemed to be a thing of the past are heard 
more and more often, and are taken up and 
sometimes amplified by certain intellectual 
:lites who are incapable of seeing beyond the 
horizon of national frontiers. 
Indignation is an insufficient response to 
“his state of affairs. We need to find a real 
-iposte to the real threats now posed to 
nternational security in the shape of exclu- 
sion, rural decline and urban decay, large- 
scale emigrations, deterioration of the envi- 
ronment, new pandemic diseases and the 
‘raffic in arms and drugs. 
In UNESCO's own specific domain, we 
1eed to rally the forces of the human mind 
0 this cause. We must concentrate our 
fforts on the development of human 
resources with a view to getting back, after 
lecades when strategies have been character- 
zed by a narrowly economic approach, to 
‘hat which lies at the very heart of develop- 
nent, the human individual. We are learning 
‘0 invest in that intangible asset, human cre- 
itivity, and in the acquisition, transfer and 
>ooling of knowledge, which hold the key 
‘0 any process of individual and collective 
>mancipation. Emancipation can never be 
achieved in isolation or by turning in upon 
oneself. It is by receptivity and interaction 
‘hat cultures grow strong, and it is by expe- 
-iencing and seeking out the Other that indi- 
vidual personalities are formed. 
To counter the culture of war we must 
construct a culture of peace, a culture of con- 
viviality, founded upon the principles of 
freedom, justice and democracy, of tolerance 
and solidarity, and upon respect for all 
human rights; a culture that rejects violence 
and seeks solutions to problems through 
dialogue and negotiation; a culture of pre- 
vention that endeavours to get to the very 
root of conflicts in order, as far as this is 
possible, to stop them erupting. 
Development for peace and peace for 
development, these are the two thrusts of 
our action. Helping the weakest, bringing 
society's outcasts back into the fold, facili- 
tating the exercise of civil rights and the par- 
ticipation of the whole population in devel- 
opment, learning to live together and build 
together in spite of disagreements and dif- 
ferences, these are our objectives. [|

THE BERLIN BLOCKADE 
In 1948, the city of Berlin was divided into 
two zones: West Berlin under British, French 
and American occupation, and East Berlin 
under Soviet occupation. In a bid to curb infla 
tion, on 18 June the United States, France 
and the United Kingdom introduced a mone- 
tary reform which was meant to include West 
Berlin. On 23 June, Stalin intervened and 
barred all land and river access to the city 
from the western sectors. 
The Western powers mounted an emer- 
gency airlift, which kept the city supplied for 
almost one year. In September, they brought 
the issue before the Security Council. The 
Secretary-General, Trygve Lie, organized con- 
sultations which reached a successful con- 
clusion on 4 May 1949 and led to the lifting 
of the blockade. 
CONFLICTS 
The UN’s main goal is to maintain world peace, especially by 
contributing to the resolution of major confrontations

The origins of the partition of Korea date back 
to the end of the Second World War. In 1948, 
in spite of United Nations efforts to estab- 
lish a united Korean State, the country was 
split in two. The same year, the General 
Assembly created the United Nations Com- 
mission on Korea, which was replaced in 1950 
by the United Nations Commission for the 
Reunification and Rehabilitation of Korea. 
On 25 June 1950, the Korean War broke 
out. On 7 July, the Security Council created 
an international force under unified command. 
Contingents from 16 countries joined the mil- 
itary forces of South Korea. 
THE KOREAN WAR 
The Soviet Union, having refrained from 
occupying its seat on the Security Council for 
six months*, considered that the Council's 
decision was illegal because it had been taken 
in its absence, but this had no effect. 
On 1 August, the Soviet Union decided 
to return to the Council and vetoed all the 
draft resolutions put to it. 
On 3 November, Dean Acheson, the Ameri- 
can Secretary of State, secured the adoption of 
aresolution authorizing the General Assembly 
to deal with matters blocked by a veto in the 
Security Council and, in case of need, to allow 
the use of force by a two-thirds majority vote. 
  
  
  
  
In the same month, volunteers from the 
People's Republic of China joined in the war 
alongside North Korea. The Council requested 
the withdrawal of the Chinese troops, only to 
be faced with the Soviet veto. In response, 
the Assembly formed a group to examine the 
conditions for a cease-fire. 
On 18 May 1951, the General Assembly 
decided to impose an embargo on China. On 
30 June, North Korea accepted an armistice 
offer. A preliminary agreement was reached in 
February 1952. On 27 July 1953, at Pan- 
munjom, the United Nations command and 
the Chinese-North Korean command signed 
an armistice agreement, thus bringing the 
Korean War to an end. 
A joint communiqué issued by the two 
governments on 4 July 1972 announced that 
their common aim was to promote national 
unity and to seek reunification by peaceful 
means. 
In 1991, the two countries were simulta 
neously admitted to the United Nations. 
* Disapproving of the fact that China was represented 
in the United Nations by the delegates of Chiang Kai- 
shek, the Soviet Union temporarily withdrew from the 
Council as a sign of protest.

### 101207: Major conflicts

  
ARAB-ISRAELI WARS 
The question of Palestine is at the origin of the Arab-Israeli conflict in the 
Middle East. In 1947, when the General Assembly had to decide on its 
future, this territory administered by the United Kingdom had a popula- 
tion of about two million inhabitants (composed of two-thirds Arabs and 
one-third Jews). 
On 29 November, the General Assembly adopted a partition plan pro- 
viding for the creation of an Arab state and a Jewish state, with Jerusalem 
coming under an international regime administered by the United Nations. In 
December, this plan was rejected by the Arab Summit meeting held in Cairo. 
On 14 May 1948, the United Kingdom relinquished its mandate over 
Palestine. The state of Israel was proclaimed. On the following day, the 
Palestinians, together with the armies of Syria, Lebanon, Egypt and 
Jordan, opened hostilities against the new state. In 1949, these four 
countries and Israel signed armistice agreements. The United Nations 
Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO) assisted the parties in com- 
plying with the provisions of these agreements. 
However, border incidents continued. 
Following the nationalization of the Suez Canal announced by 
Egypt on 26 July 1956, Israeli forces invaded Sinai, while British and 
French troops landed at Suez at the end of October. 
On 4 November, the General Assembly, meeting in special session, 
called for a cease-fire and created the first peace-keeping force, the 
United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF), which supervised the pro- 
gressive withdrawal of the Israeli, British and French troops, patrolled 
the demarcation line between Egypt and Israel and brought relative 
quiet to the area. 
UNEF was withdrawn at Egypt's request on 16 May 1967. On 5 
June, war broke out again between Israel on the one hand, and Egypt, 
Jordan and Syria on the other. The Security Council called four times for 
a ceasefire, which was eventually concluded on 11 June. At that date,

Israel occupied Sinai, the Gaza strip, the West Bank of the Jordan, 
including East Jerusalem, and part of the Syrian Golan Heights. The Secu- 
rity Council sent observers to monitor the ceasefire. 
On 22 November 1967, the Council unanimously adopted resolu- 
tion 242, which laid down the general principles for a peaceful and 
lasting settlement: the withdrawal of Israeli armed forces from territo- 
ries occupied in the most recent conflict; the termination of all claims or 
states of belligerency; respect for and recognition of the sovereignty, 
territorial integrity and political independence of every state in the area; 
the guarantee of free navigation through international waterways in the 
area; and the establishment of demilitarized zones. 
Between 1967 and 1973, the Secretary-General’s representative, 
Gunnar Jarring, had tatks with the countries concerned (with the excep 
tion of Syria, which did not accept resolution 242), but without reaching 
a successful outcome. On 6 October 1973, hostilities resumed. 
On 24 October, the Security Council created the second United 
Nations Emergency Force (UNEF II). The deployment of 7,000 men from 
twelve countries brought the October war to an end. 
The ensuing withdrawal of forces took place under United Nations 
supervision. 
 
CRISIS IN THE CONGO 
In 1960, shortly after the Congo gained inde- 
pendence, inter-ethnic disorders broke out 
and Belgium, the former colonial power, sent 
troops to the country. 
On 11 July 1960, Moise Tshombe, a polit- 
ical leader in Katanga province, announced the 
secession of Katanga. On 12 July, Congolese 
leaders Joseph Kasuvubu and Patrice 
Lumumba requested UN military assistance. 
In less than 48 hours, contingents provided 
by more than 30 countries started to arrive in 
the country, along with UN civilian experts, 
whose task it was to help maintain public ser- 
vices. On 25 July, Belgian troops withdrew 
from the entire territory except for Katanga. 
On 17 January 1961, Patrice Lumumba 
was assassinated. One month later, the 
Security Council authorized the use of force 
to prevent civil war in Congo. UN forces took 
control of the territory between Kabalo and 
Albertville. The secessionist forces, led by for- 
eign mercenaries, clashed with the United 
Nations forces. On 17 September, the Secre- 
tary-General of the United Nations, Dag Ham- 
marskjold, was Killed in a plane crash on his 
way to Ndola to meet Tshombe. 
Initially responsible for ensuring the with- 
drawal of Belgian troops from the Congo, the 
    
UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold in 
Katanga, Congo (now Zaire) in August 1960. 
United Nations Operation in the Congo 
(ONUC) became an operation to maintain the 
country's territorial integrity and political inde- 
pendence. It prevented civil war and ensured 
the evacuation of all foreign military and para- 
military forces, and of all mercenaries. 
By the time it ended in June 1964, this 
operation—one of the largest in the history 
of the United Nations—was responsible for 
implementing a vast long-term programme of 
technical assistance, employing some 2,000 
experts at its height in 1963-64. 
THE CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS 
With the coming to power of Fidel Castro, rela- 
tions between Cuba and the United States 
deteriorated. In April 1969, Cuban exiles 
armed by the United States landed at the Bay 
of Pigs. Their plan to trigger off a popular 
uprising came to nothing. In the face of con- 
tinuing American hostility, Cuba appealed to 
the Soviet Union for assistance. 
On 18 October 1962, the Americans 
detected work being carried out on the installa 
tion of Soviet rockets capable of reaching Amer- 
ican territory. Four days later, U.S. President 
John F. Kennedy imposed a complete blockade

Nations, Sithu U Thant, then intervened per-

Kennedy and Soviet leader Nikita S. 
Krushchey, and holding separate meetings 
with representatives of the two parties. The 
Soviets agreed to withdraw the missiles and 
the United States confirmed its undertaking 
to withdraw its missiles from Turkey.

THE IRAN-IRAQ WAR 
After the conflict of the 1970s, when the 
United Nations contributed effectively to the 
conclusion of an agreement between Iran and 
Iraq, hostilities flared up again in September 
1980. On 28 September, the Security Council 
gave urgent attention to the matter and 
requested the two parties to settle their dis- 
pute through mediation or conciliation. 
Between 1980 and 1986, the Security 
Council adopted seven resolutions and dis- 
patched several missions to Baghdad and 
Teheran. UN experts confirmed that chemical 
weapons were being used, and this was con- 
demned by the Security Council and the Secre- 
tary-General. 
On 20 July 1987, the Security Council

Headquarters at Sulymaniyah (Iraq). 
unanimously adopted resolution 598 which, a 
year later, was to become the framework for 
reaching a cease-fire agreement. 
The Secretary-General engaged in intense 
diplomatic activity and established direct con- 
tacts between the two governments. Discus- 
sions under the auspices of the United 
Nations continued after the signature of the 
armistice. The United Nations Iran-Iraq Military 
Observer Group (UNIIMOG) supervised and 
verified the withdrawal of troops to the inter- 
nationally recognized boundaries. Its man- 
date was terminated in 1991. 
CAMBODIA 
In 1989, the five permanent members of the 
Security Council embarked on a series of dis- 
cussions and in November 1990 prepared a 
document setting out the mandate of a 
future United Nations Transitional Authority 
in Cambodia. 
in June 1991, the Cambodian parties 
decided to apply an unlimited cease-fire and to 
stop receiving military assistance. In October, 
the United Nations set up the United Nations 
Advance Mission in Cambodia (UNAMIC), 
which helped the parties concerned to main- 
tain the ceasefire and until March 1992 
engaged in alerting the civilian population to 
the danger of land mines and in training people 
10 detect and clear them. 
On 23 October 1991, the Cambodian 
parties signed the Cambodia Agreements in 
Paris (France) and assigned to the United 
Nations all powers necessary to ensure their 
application. 
In March 1992, the United Nations 
launched a programme of repatriation and 
resettlement for some 375,000 refugees and 
displaced persons and established the 
United Nations Transitional Authority in Cam- 
bodia (UNTAC). UNTAC supervised the cease- 
fire and the withdrawal of foreign forces, dis- 
armed all armed forces of the Cambodian 
parties, supervised the activities of the 
administrative structures, and organized free 
elections. 
The elections took place from 23 to 28 
May 1993, after which the new Cambodian 
government was formed.

RWANDA 
Fighting between the Armed Forces of the Government of Rwanda and 
the Rwandese Patriotic Front first broke out in October 1990 across the 
border between Rwanda and Uganda. In spite of a number of cease-fire 
agreements, hostilities resumed in February 1993. The United Nations 
Observer Mission Uganda-Rwanda (UNOMUR) supervised the border 
area and became an important factor of stability in the region. 
On 4 August 1993, a comprehensive peace agreement was signed 
in Arusha, providing for the installation of a democratic government, 
the repatriation of refugees, the integration of the armed forces of the 
two parties and the deployment of a neutral international force to 
assist in its application. 
In October 1993, the military observers of UNOMUR were placed 
under the command of the new United Nations Assistance Mission for 
Rwanda (UNAMIR). 
The deaths of the Presidents of Rwanda and Burundi in a plane 
crash on 6 April 1994 triggered off a resumption of the civil war in 
Rwanda. The situation changed radically. UN troops were attacked and 
killed, and the Belgian battalion pulled out. The “blue helmets” never- 
theless continued their humanitarian activities in collaboration with the 
International Committee of the Red Cross and the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). 
On 22 June 1994, the Security Council decided to authorize the 
mounting of a multinational operation. This was Operation Turquoise— 
a French initiative with the assistance of African troops—which 
ensured protection of safe areas in July and August, until the UN con- 
tingent returned in strength.

On 2 August 1990, the day of Iraq's inva- 
sion of Kuwait, the Security Council 
imposed mandatory sanctions and under- 
UN peacekeepers took diplomatic moves in a bid to avoid war.

known as Operation Desert Storm, con- 
sisted of troops from 28 countries acting 
on the authorization of the Security Council 
under U.S. command. 
On 27 February, the Iraqi forces left 
Kuwait.

SOMALIA 
The downfall of President Siad Barre in Jan- 
uary 1991 triggered off an increasingly bloody 
struggle for power. Political chaos was com- 
pounded by famine, disease and banditry. 
Hundreds of thousands of Somalis died and 
more than one million fled into exile. 
The United Nations was fully engaged in 
humanitarian activities, with which FAO, 
UNDP, UNICEF, UNHCR, WFP and WHO were 
associated. The United Nations Operation in 
Somalia (UNOSOM 1: April 1992-April 1993) 
constantly had to contend with attacks and 
looting by armed bands. 
On 9 December 1992, the first elements 
of the Unified Task Force (UNITAF), led by the 
United States, were deployed in Mogadishu, 
with the mission of supporting the humani- 
tarian assistance missions. Its activities were 
taken over by UNOSOM [1 in May 1993. 
   
  
   
UNOSOM II achieved remarkable results 
in providing humanitarian assistance. How- 
ever, in spite of the conciliation agreements 
signed between the Somali political move- 
ments (in January 1993, March 1993 and 
May 1994), it did not succeed in carrying 
through the agreed disarmament process, 
which was the basic prerequisite for the Oper- 
ation’s success. 
The 29 countries which provided a total of 
28,000 troops and some 2,800 civilians decided 
each in turn to withdraw their contingents. 
in March 1995, the last UN troops left

CONFLICT BETWEEN INDIA AND PAKISTAN 
In 1947, under the partition plan provided for 
under the Indian Independence Act, the State of 
Jammu and Kashmir was free to accede to India 
or Pakistan, with both of which it has a common 
border. The Maharaja of the State requested its 
accession to India. This choice was at the root 
of an armed conflict between India and Pakistan, 
which has been under United Nations surveil 
lance for almost the past fifty years. 
On 31 December 1947, the matter was 
referred to the Security Council which on 20 Jan 
uary 1948 established a United Nations Com 
mission for India and Pakistan (UNCIP), with a 
view to putting an end to the conflict. The cease- 
fire came into effect on 1 January 1949. The first 
UN military observers to arrive in the area on 24 
January formed the nucleus of the United 
Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pak- 
istan (UNMOGIP). In July, the two countries 
signed the Karachi (Pakistan) Agreement estab- 
lishing a cease-fire line to be supervised by the 
observers. 
In August 1965, hostilities again broke out 
and spread to the international border between 
India and West Pakistan. The Secretary-General 
established an administrative adjunct of 
UNMOGIP, the United Nations India-Pakistan 
Observation Mission (UNIPOM), which was 
required to supervise the cease-fire beyond the 
borders of Kashmir. The Security Council called 
for a ceasefire with effect from 22 September 
1964. The opposing troops were withdrawn in 
February 1966. UNIPOM's task was accom- 
plished. 
On 3 December 1971, hostilities broke 
out yet again on the cease-fire line in Kashmir. 
The next day, the General Assembly called for 
a ceasefire, which was accepted on 17 
December. In July 1972, India and Pakistan 
signed the Simla Agreement defining a Line of 
Control in Kashmir. 
UNMOGIP continues to exist, but with a 
reduced contingent. It task consists in 
observing compliance with the cease-fire of 
17 December 1971 and in reporting thereon 
to the Secretary-General. 
FORMER YUGOSLAVIA 
The disintegration of Yugoslavia sparked off a 
civil war which, between June 1991 and June 
1992, extended from Croatia to Bosnia and 
Herzegovina. 
In March 1992, the United Nations Pro- 
tection Force (UNPROFOR) was deployed with 
the mission of supervising the demilitariza- 
tion of the areas protected by the United 
Nations and, later, the Dubrovnik region. 
In view of the deterioration of the situation 
in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the mandate and 
strength of UNPROFOR have been enlarged sev- 
eral times. Its task is to ensure the operation of 
Sarajevo airport, the delivery of humanitarian 
assistance, and the control of military flights in 
the airspace over Bosnia and Herzegovina. The 
ceasefire agreements in Bosnia and Herze- 
govina have not been respected. 
In December 1992, UNPROFOR was 
deployed on a preventive mission in Macedonia. 
From 1994 onwards, NATO engaged in 
military strikes in Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
On 31 March 1995, UNPROFOR was split 
into three separate but interdependent peace- 
keeping forces: UNPREDEP (former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia), UNPROFOR (Bosnia 
and Herzegovina) and UNCRO (Croatia).

### 101208: The Road to peace

The road to peace 
by Maurice Bertrand 
To improve its response to crises, 
the United Nations will probably have to 
rethink its structure 
There are two conflicting theories 
about the future of the United 
Nations. According to the more widely 
accepted one, the structure of international 
organizations can only change after the end 
of a world war, as history would seem to 
demonstrate—the League of Nations was set 
up in 1919 and the United Nations in 1945. 
This argument rests on the observation that 
it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to 
obtain a consensus within the “international 
community” for alterations to the legal 
framework governing relations between 
states. Only a universal surge of emotion 
such as that caused by the ending of a war, or 
rather the victory of a coalition on a world- 
wide scale, could therefore create the condi- 
tions for such a consensus. 
In this view, unless there were to be a 
third world war the United Nations, what- 
ever the difficulties it might encounter, 
would be fated to survive as it is for many 
decades, and the appropriate response to its 
fiftieth anniversary would therefore be to 
wish it many happy returns. While con- 
ceding that we live in a changing world and 
that ideas, including ideas about peace, 
evolve, proponents of this argument believe 
that the existing institutions will manage to 
adapt to such changes without needing in- 
depth reform. 
The other theory, proceeding from a more 
complex analysis of institutional change, calls 
for reforms, or an aggiornamento, of the 
system as a whole to be carried out without 
delay. However, it concurs with the previous 
theory in believing that it was the thinking 
on the subject of peace summed up by U.S. 
President Woodrow Wilson! that shaped the 
League of Nations in 1919, and it further 
observes that the same thinking—corrected 
and supplemented by “functionalist” ideas 
on the pooling of efforts in science and tech- 
nology—Ilay behind the Roosevelt adminis- 
  
tration's setting up of the Bretton Woods 
institutions (the International Monetary 
Fund and the World Bank) in 1944 and the 
United Nations in 1945. 
Statesmanship in the post-war world 
This theory therefore readily accepts 1919 
and 1945 as being crucial dates since they cor- 
responded to exceptional situations, but 
points out that other institutional changes 
have come about at other times and in other 
circumstances. One of these changes is of 
especial importance, the ongoing process of 
European construction since the 1950s, from 
the establishment of the European Coal and 
Steel Community to the Treaty of Rome 
and then the Treaty of Maastricht. 
The fact is that European construction 
has had a far more effective influence on the 
establishment of world peace than the 
League of Nations or the United Nations, 
insofar as it has succeeded in rendering 
almost unimaginable an outbreak of war 
among France, the United Kingdom, Ger- 
many, Austria and Italy, countries that until 
1945, and for a thousand years before then, 
had been involved in innumerable conflicts, 
including the two world wars. 
On the global scale, other important 
institutions have been founded since 1945: in 
1956, the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA); in 1975, the G7 group, a 
summit gathering of the Heads of State or 
Government of the seven leading Western 
industrial countries which provided previ- 
ously lacking opportunities for exchanges of 
views between the great powers and set up 
the equivalent of a world “board of direc- 
tors”; and in 1994, the World Trade Organi- 
zation (WTO). 
These examples suffice to show that fun- 
damental institutional changes come about 
when statesmen, whose position allows

them to influence the political class and 
world opinion, are convinced that such 
changes are necessary. This was the case when 
Jean Monnet and Robert Schuman launched 
European construction in 1951, drawing on 
the ideas concerning European unity held by 
many thinkers since the eighteenth century 
and rallying a considerable section of the 
political class to the cause of a “United States 
of Europe”. 
Further evidence that institutional change 
can occur at other times than following the 
victory of an international coalition in war 1s 
given by U.S. President Dwight D. Eisen- 
hower's influence on the establishment of 
the IAEA, by that of several European 
leaders, including French President Valéry 
Giscard d'Estaing, at the time of the estab- 
lishment of the G7 group, or again by that 
of prevalent views about the need to regulate 
international trade at the time when the 
WTO was established. 
The need for reform 
Any attempt to define the future of the 
United Nations in the light of this second 
theory would entail consideration of the five 
factors outlined below. 
There is now a very broad measure of 
acknowledgment of the need for wide- 
ranging, rapid “change” in the world. Political 
discourse abounds increasingly in clichés 
about the constraints of interdependence, a 
single world market, acid rain “knowing no 
frontiers”, the revolution in information 
technology and communication, and the 
“global village”. The free-market ideology, 
with its accompanying monetarist view of the 
economy, predominates and, though increas- 
ingly challenged, monopolizes thinking in 
these matters. The end of the Cold War has 
not had the same kind of repercussions as the 
end of the two world wars but has led to a 
gradual calling into question of the type of 
society in which we now live. 
This reassessment has in large part been 
brought about by the general sense of frus- 
tration arising from the failure of attempts 
to settle the growing number of intra-state 
conflicts that are breaking out in various 
parts of the world (Yugoslavia, the Cau- 
casus, Somalia, Mexico, Rwanda) and also 
from the increasingly vast floods of refugees 
fleeing from these conflicts towards the 
industrialized countries. 
Furthermore, the threat of economic 
destabilization on a world-wide scale, as in 
the case of the Mexican crises of February 
1995 and the periodic bouts of exchange-rate 
speculation, are worrying not only to public

opinion in general but also to the heads of 
the major business enterprises and those in 
charge of the economy and public finances. 
Added to all this, the profound changes 
in the mode of production brought about 
by rapid progress in electronics and commu- 
nications are aggravating unemployment, 
bringing down wages and contributing to 
marginalization in the rich as well as in the 
poor countries. 
Yet neither governments nor the interna- 
tional institutions have any solutions to offer 
to these new threats. The credibility of the 
entire political class is thus being undermined 
in very many countries. It is as though nation- 
states had become incapable of solving their 
own problems because they have become 
world-wide problems, while at the same time 
the international institutions have failed to 
acquire the powers needed in order for them 
to be able to make up for these shortcomings. 
Public anxiety about this situation may 
give rise to one of two attitudes. On the one 
  
hand, racist, nationalist, populist and fascist 
trends may grow stronger in the rich coun- 
tries while at the same time the poor coun- 
tries turn inwards on themselves in the search 
for ethnic identity or under the influence of 
nationalism or religious fundamentalism. On 
the other hand, there may be a renewal of the 
democratic ideology that opposes fascism and 
defends human rights, leading on to calls for 
institutional reform on a global scale. 


### 101208: The Road to peace

The first of these trends is already mani- 
festing itself in the rise of populist and 
extreme right-wing parties in Europe, the 
spread of nationalist and militarist ideas in the 
United States and the exacerbation of various 
forms of fundamentalism in many countries 
of the South. However, the unease caused by 
this trend is provoking resistance in the form 
of movements by citizen groups and by a sec- 
tion of the general public in support of 
stronger defence of human rights, democracy 
and peace. : 
The kind of society that should be set up 
in order to ensure the success of the humanist 
and universalist ideology remains, however, 
ill-defined, especially as regards peace and the 
share-out of political responsibilities at the 
global, regional and national levels. 
Underrated proposals 
As a result of this state of uncertainty, much 
thought has been given and many suggestions 
have been made in the last ten years or so as to 
the reform or complete reorganization of 
international institutions. This is something 
new; until 1985 all thinking on this subject 
was paralysed by forty years of the Cold War. 
Not only are Germany and Japan, at the most 
official level, claiming their places as perma- 
nent members of the UN Security Council 
but other institutional proposals are begin- 
ning to win approval from the majority of 
experts and at least some political leaders in 
various countries. | 
These proposals include: the establish- 
ment of an Economic Security Council, a 
body of limited membership comprising 
representatives of the major powers—in eco- 
nomic or demographic terms—and the var- 
ious regions of the world (equivalent to 
envisaging an enlargement of the G7); the 
introduction of international taxation to 
replenish the budgets of the international 
organizations; making good the “democratic 
deficit” on a global scale by means of 
improved representation of civil society or 
even a World Parliament; defining and imple- 
menting a “conflict-prevention strategy” 
instead of relying solely on the inefficient 
methods of “preventive diplomacy” or 
trusting to those of “collective security”, 
illusory as they have proved to be; thor-

ough-going reform of the International 
Monetary Fund or its possible replacement 
by a body akin to a “World Central Bank” 
providing better guarantees of stability in 
exchange rates. 
The tendency emerging from the efforts 
undertaken, this year alone, in over a hun- 
dred commissions, symposia, seminars and 
research programmes, is towards recognition 
of the fundamental requirements that 
modern international institutions should 
meet: an effective system of joint consulta- 
tion by the world's political leaders; democ- 
ratic representation of citizens; a security 
system making it possible to prevent the 
outbreak of civil wars; and better safeguards 
of economic stability. 
These proposals continue, however, to 
run up against national political leaders’ lack 
of interest in problems of this kind and the 
public’s lack of information about them. 
There is thus a long way to go before they 
can be seen as viable political responses to the 
most urgent problems. 
The future of the United Nations is in fact 
tied up with the evolution of the world polit- 
ical situation itself and with the nature of the 
crises arising therein in the years ahead. Should 
serious crises of security occur—such as the 
mass migrations caused by civil wars in coun- 
tries near to the industrialized world, which 
are in danger of provoking a sharp increase in 
racist and ultranationalist reactions in the rich 
countries—they could lead to the rejection of 
the United Nations or even to its demise, as 
the world reverts to national rivalries and the 
competitive struggle for hegemony. 
On the other hand, crises which, though 
less grave, nevertheless sound serious warn- 
ings, in the field of economic security for 
instance, could induce those statesmen who 
take the long view and who are concerned to 
avoid a disastrous outcome to recommend 
and put into effect reforms broad enough to 
allow for the gradual reorganization and 
reinforcement of the international institu- 
tional structure. 
The future of the United Nations will 
thus depend, in the final analysis, on the 
ability of statesmen to suggest, and to put 
into effect, visionary solutions—before it is 
too late. |

The development debate 
by Christian Comelian 
Can development be the same for all? 
Has the United Nations contributed 
to development in its fifty years of 
existence and if so, to what kind of develop- 
ment? What role can we expect to see it play 
in this field in the coming years? 
In a short article it is scarcely possible to 
present a complete assessment’. To do so 
would, for a start, be a technically challenging 
undertaking: how could precise demarcation

lines be drawn between action in support of 
development and other related fields such as 
international security, human rights, humani- 
tarian activities or many specific areas such as 
childhood, food, labour and health? It is dif- 
ficult, if not impossible, to give an overall pic- 
ture of activities that are many-sided and com- 
plex and are carried out by a large number of 
specialized agencies and programmes. 
Another difficulty in the way of this 
assessment is that it is the subject of heated 
controversy: given that development results 
from a political process rather than from mere 
technocratic know-how, it entails choices 
between different objectives and arbitration 
between different interest groups, and hence a 
constant interplay of power relationships, 
ideological confrontations and negotiating 
strategies. 
An uneven track record 
I should like to emphasize four points. 
Firstly, the challenge of meeting the 
overall demands of development on a world- 
wide scale is an enormous one, made even 
greater by recent political and economic 
upheavals. No organization is capable of 
meeting that challenge single-handed in a sat- 
isfactory way. The question thus arises: 
should the role of an international organiza- 
tion be limited to a few day-to-day manage- 
ment tasks, or can it be expected to come up 
with the new ideas and carry out the changes 
that such a challenge calls for? The initial 
temptation, as regards the second half of the 
question, would be to answer no, but that 
would be to overlook the conceptual and 
methodological value of ideas recently put 
forward by the United Nations such as “sus- 
tainable” development, “human” develop- 
ment and “social” development—even if the 
uses to which these concepts have so far been 
put fall short of the potential they represent. 
Secondly, in the matter of development, 
the United Nations has served as an arena for 
dialogue and confrontation between North 
and South. Confrontation has, however, had 
the upper hand over dialogue, and has proved

fruitless: either the end result has been incom-

with increased public aid to development, 
which was supposed to have reached 0.7 per 
cent of donor countries’ GNP but still stands 
at half that rate! 
As to the confrontation between the cap- 
italist and socialist theories of development, 
no serious debate on the subject ever took 
place, with the very regrettable result that 
simplistic conceptions of the role of market 
forces now hold sway. 
Thirdly, the weak point of the United 
Nations is that it has never had a proper body 
of principles as regards development. It has 
always fallen into line with the viewpoints of 
the financial institutions, which are them- 
selves dominated by neoclassical orthodoxy 
and the vested interests of the North, albeit 
with a few of the demands of the South, 
irreconcilable as they are with that ortho- 
doxy, thrown in for good measure. The 
United Nations Development Programme 
(UNDP) itself long felt compelled to mimic

nature of the “development decades” and 
suchlike solemnly proclaimed events. 
Fourthly, this being the case, it comes as 
no surprise to see the very uneven quality of 
the development activities of the United 
Nations, not only regarding population, the 
environment or children but also in the 
fields of structural adjustment, industrializa- 
tion, food and international trade. This 
uneven track record, partly inevitable 
though it may be, is particularly regrettable 
since the United Nations has shown on 
many occasions that it is capable of doing 
excellent work in these fields, work that is 
now more than ever needed. 
Making the UN a more global 
organization 
How could performance be improved in the 
future? The record shows serious shortcom- 
ings that can only be put right by means of a 
comprehensive overhaul of the entire United 
  
Nations system. The primary need is to take 
steps to make it a truly global organization. 
This means, in the first place, allowing the 
major players in the development process to 
be more fairly represented at the world level. 
The United Nations cannot go on letting a 
minority of states, albeit the richest ones, 
hold the financial and monetary levers of 
development in their hands, as they do today. 
The institutional solution is not, however, an 
easy one: the richest countries cannot be 
required to provide most of the funding for 
organizations over whose decisions they have 
no control. 
Next, the new organization must be able 
to act in an integrated and coherent manner 
upon all the dimensions of development and 
not be limited to only some of them, as was 
seen to be the case during the preparations 
for the Copenhagen Summit for social 
development. The view was expressed on 
that occasion that the United Nations 
should specialize in “social” development 
and leave the economic aspects of develop- 
ment to other bodies. Such a break-up 
would be both absurd and disastrous, espe- 
cially as one of the most urgent tasks for 
thinking and planning in relation to devel- 
opment is that of integrating its economic, 
social and political dimensions®. It is a task 
the United Nations cannot shirk. 
Lastly, such an organization should 
understand the expression “development” as 
encompassing a much wider range of social 
needs than just the need, as set forth in the 
model that prevails today, for access to greater 
and greater consumption of goods. Not only 
must the structures of production and con- 
sumption that characterize growth be recon- 
sidered; we must also accept pluralism in the 
definition of development, of the elements of 
which it is composed, of the way in which it 
is shared out, and of the models of social 
organization upon which it depends—in 
political terms, a much harder task. 
These reforming ideas have far-reaching 
implications. They confer upon the United 
Nations a power of arbitration in the alloca- 
tion of collective resources to the satisfaction 
of needs that are considered, world-wide, as 
having priority, such as the reduction of the 
least acceptable forms of physical depriva- 
tion or social oppression, the banning of 
trade in certain weapons or the protection of 
the basic conditions for the survival of the 
ecosystem, whether or not these needs meet 
the criteria of the dominant economic 
approach. 
Thus enlarged, the conception of the role 
of the United Nations runs the obvious risk 
of suffering from the same lack of realism as 
has marked the Organization in the past—one 
need only think back to the grandiloquent

declarations about the “right of all peoples to

double one: on the one hand, the danger 1s 
that the political and social basis for defining 
these priorities will be lacking; and on the 
other, an even worse danger, that a cosmetic 
consensus will be arrived at around a few gen- 
eral objectives to which nobody is committed. 
This lack of realism could, however, be 
avoided by sticking to precise, specific com- 
mitments, entailing well-defined strategies 
and resources. I shall cite two examples. 
The first relates to international trade. In 
this field, the prevailing model imposes a 
specific orientation on all countries through 
the action of the Bretton Woods institu- 
tions and the GATT’ accords, in particular 
the fullest possible integration of national 
economies into international trade in accor- 
dance with the often obscure rule of “com- 
parative advantages”. The social costs of this 
narrow, mercantile conception of develop- 


### 101209: The Development debate

ment have, alas, been proven beyond all 
doubt, yet the United Nations has never 
made any serious attempt to reverse it. 
The second relates to the new ways of 
funding development and in particular to 
the role that a world-wide taxation system 
might play. This idea, recently taken up by 
the United Nations Development Pro- 
gramme®, has the advantage of being rela- 
tively painless while potentially bringing in 
considerable resources. A much clearer com- 
mitment by the United Nations, or by a 
renovated world organization, to such a 
scheme would doubtless be much more 
effective than any number of generous- 
sounding but empty speeches, 
The task of thinking these questions out 
and, in particular, of making specific pro- 
posals is going ahead, but remains inadequate 
and needs to be tackled more thoroughly. The 
stakes are high. It is not a matter of promising 
a “radiant future” but, by trying to eradicate 
certain unacceptable factors, of ensuring the 
survival of the present world. |

United Nations Committee on 
Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights and Professor of Law and 
Director of the Centre for 
International and Public Law at the 
Australian National University. He 
is the author of a number of 
books, the most recent of which 
is The Best Interests of the Child: 
Reconciling Culture and Human 
Rights (Oxford University 
Press, 1994), and is the editor of 
the English version of The 
International Dimensions of 
pl} Human Rights (2 vols. UNEsco, 
1982).    
When the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights was adopted in Paris in 
1948, virtually all governments said the stan- 
dards were not to be legally binding upon 
them. At that time, no specific human rights 
violations, apart from slavery, genocide and 
gross abuses of the rights of aliens, were 
effectively proscribed. Virtually all states 
shielded themselves happily behind Article 
2(7)" of the United Nations Charter in 
arguing that any other human rights matter 
was strictly an internal affair for the state 
concerned. While a UN Commission on 
Human Rights was set up, its work was 
dominated entirely by governments and its 
mandate was largely confined to the drafting 
of new treaties and other legal instruments. 
Governments wasted no time in declaring in 
1947 that the Commission had “no power” 
   
by Philip Alston 
whatsoever to respond in any way to viola- 
tions of human rights. A procedure which 
examined complaints was correctly described 
by a senior UN official as “the world’s most 
elaborate waste-paper basket”. 
In 1948 many governments specifically 
rejected proposals to move to the adoption 
of binding treaty obligations and, by 1953, 
the United States had informed the world 
that it would have nothing to do with any 
human rights treaty that might be adopted 
by the United Nations. The Cold War 
ensured that the drafting of the two Interna- 
tional Human Rights Covenants was not 
completed until 1966. It then took another 
decade before thirty-five states ratified them, 
thus bringing them into operation. In 1976, 
therefore, less than twenty years ago, an 
assessment of the United Nations’ achieve-

few grounds for optimism. 
From theory to practice 
Since then, however, very significant progress 
has been made. The standards contained in 
the Universal Declaration are, in practice, 
applicable to every state, whatever its formal 
attitude to their legal status. The view that 
human rights violations are essentially 
domestic matters, while still put forward in 
an almost ritual manner from time to time, 
receives very little credence from the interna- 
tional community. 
The Universal Declaration has been sup- 
plemented by a vast array of international 
standards, the most important of which are 
the six “core” human rights treaties—the 
two Covenants and Conventions dealing 
with racial discrimination, discrimination 
against women, torture, and children’s 
rights. In addition to the six expert treaty 
bodies created by the United Nations to 
supervise the compliance of states parties 
with their obligations under those treaties, 
regional human rights conventions, and 
implementing machinery, have been set up in 
Europe, the Americas and Africa, and the 
United Nations has created a complex array 
of other monitoring mechanisms. 
In the mid-1960s the Commission on 
Human Rights began responding to human 
rights violations, albeit in a very limited 
number of situations. Since 1979 it has gradu- 
ally and persistently expanded both the 
number and diversity of countries subjected 
to public monitoring and the range and 
intrusiveness of the procedures it has been 
prepared to apply. Ever-increasing numbers of 
non-governmental organizations and victims 
of human rights violations now participate in 
the work of one or more of the bodies set up 
by the Commission or its Sub-Commission, 
and governments attest to the growing 
potential of the United Nations to be effec- 
tive by the lengths to which they go in order 
to achieve membership of the Commission 
" ASSEMBLEIA 
0TO N°! 
  
and to influence its deliberations, as well as by 
the occasional harshness of their denuncia- 
tions of its actions. 
Most recently the United Nations has 
become heavily involved in the administra- 
tion of human rights programmes of 
unprecedented scope and importance in 
countries such as El Salvador, Cambodia, 
Haiti, Rwanda and Burundi. Electoral assis- 
tance, which was such a novelty in Namibia 
as recently as 1989, has developed into a 
major United Nations activity, and technical 
assistance in the human rights field has been 
provided to a significant number of coun- 
tries. The 1993 World Human Rights Con- 
ference held in Vienna definitively identified 
women’s rights as having been subject to 
unacceptable neglect in the past and as a 
major priority concern for the future. The 
following year the first United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights was 
appointed. In brief, the international human 
rights system has developed to an extent that 
would have been considered inconceivable by 
the vast majority of observers in 1945. 
The challenge of universality 
One of the biggest challenges facing interna- 
tional human rights law in the post-Cold War 
era is to establish beyond doubt its univer- 
sality. When the Universal Declaration was 
drafted, many Third World countries had not 
attained independence and were thus unable to 
contribute. When the two International 
Covenants were adopted in 1966 a far larger 
number of them participated. Nevertheless the 
Cold War tended to discourage adequate dis- 
cussion of cultural concerns because of the 
pressure on many states to support either East 
or West in the global ideological struggle. It 
was only in the late 1980s that an energetic 
debate began at the international level over 
whether human rights are indeed universally 
valid or are relative to each specific society. 
Subsequently the Vienna Conference? reaf- 
firmed that “the universal nature of these 
rights and freedoms is beyond question”.

### 101210: The Struggle for human rights

its traditions and culture and other such fac- 
tors become highly pertinent to any efforts 
to promote and protect respect for the 
rights concerned. We must recognize that the 
intransigent approach that is appropriate in 
relation to such core violations will simply 
be less productive and achieve far less 
enduring results than a more sensitive, open 
and flexible approach which situates the goals 
sought within the society in question. The 
precise requirements of what is often termed 
the right to democracy is a case in point. 
Human rights efforts will be enriched, not 
compromised, by an approach that is, in 
appropriate respects, more probing, more 
self-conscious and more selective than that 
which many countries have achieved to date. 
It is also important to recognize that there 
are conflicts among rights and that the reso- 
lution of such conflicts requires greater 
openness about the difficulties and a more 
concerted attempt to accommodate the dif- 
ferent values involved. 
The problem of relativism 
On the other hand it is essential to scruti- 
nize claims of relativism on cultural, philo- 
sophical or religious grounds. Many of the 
claims made essentially reflect no more than 
the age-old tendency of governments to jus- 
tify the cynical and self-interested proposi- 
tion that their own citizens neither want nor 
need the protection of human rights. 
In the development of the international 
human rights system and in its application at 
the national level, non-governmental organiza- 
tions have played an indispensable role. They 
have contributed to the drafting of many of 
the international standards; they have devel- 
oped a much greater awareness of human 
rights among the public at large; they have 
constantly prodded governments to respect 
their obligations, and they have assembled the 
facts that have compelled other governments 
to react to gross violations of human rights in 
a wide range of situations. They have also 
played a central role in responding to human- 
itarian emergencies. Ironically, the fact that so 
many governments have sought to suppress or 
subvert them should be seen as a tribute to 
their effectiveness. 
There are various challenges ahead for non- 
governmental organizations. They must be 
accorded greater opportunities to contribute 
to the work of international organizations, 
including the United Nations, the United 
Nations Development Programme, the 
World Bank, the Organisation of African 
Unity and the Organization of American 
States. At the international level they need to 
become both better co-ordinated and more 
systematically critical. They as a group need to 
work out how they can ensure that adequate 
attention is accorded to economic, social and 
cultural rights. Too many of the major 
groups currently do no more than pay lip 
service to these crucial rights. 
Matching words with deeds 
Thus while much has been achieved in half a 
century, there remain many challenges. In the 
years ahead governments must match their 
fine words with deeds. The United Nations 
human rights programme is radically under- 
resourced and clearly incapable of dealing 
with the tasks assigned to it. Economic, 
social and cultural rights continue to be 
largely neglected by the vast majority of 
governments, despite the rhetorical commit- 
ment of many. The result is that large-scale 
problems such as chronic malnutrition and 
lack of access to clean water, primary health 
care, primary education and adequate shelter 
are not considered human rights problems. 
This approach is morally and legally unten- 
able and the obligations undertaken by gov- 
ernments and the international community 
must be taken seriously. Universal ratifica- 
tion of the six basic international human 
rights treaties should be an urgent objective. 
It must be followed by further strength- 
ening of the institutional arrangements 
designed to help and, where necessary, to 
pressure governments into respecting the 
full range of their citizens’ human rights, 
just as they are pledged to do under the 
Charter. |

### 101213: A Guided tour of the UN system

A GUIDED TOUR OF THE UN SYSTEM 
The Charter of the United Nations Organization (UNO) was 
drafted between 25 April and 26 June 1945 at a Conference 
bringing together the nations which had officially taken up 
arms against the Axis powers prior to 1 March 1945. They set 
out to create an instrument capable of preserving the newly 
won peace and of managing it by perpetuating the Alliance 
which, in spite of differences, had held together throughout 
the Second World War. 
Ratified by most of the signatory countries on 24 October’ 
1945, the Charter reflected the determination of those 
countries to strive for the preservation of peace in order to 
ensurerespect for human rights, “social progress and better 
standards of life in larger freedom”, For this purpose, it offered 
the nations a framework for international co-operation that 
was unprecedented in human history. 
The United Nations Organization, whose Headquarters is 
in New York (U.S.A.) is open to all states which request to join 
it, accept the obligations of its Charter and have the 
determination and the means to fulfil them, 
Pursuant to the terms of its Charter, the United Nations 
Organization has six principal organs, which are empowered to 
establish subsidiary bodies to assist them in their functions 
and to conclude co-operation agreements with existing or new 
international institutions which, after signing the Protocol, 
acquire the status of specialized agencies (see organization 
y
r
 
  
The General Assembly, whose first ses- 
sion was convened in London (United 
Kingdom) from 10 January to 14 Febru- 
ary 1946, is composed of representatives 
of all the Member States of the Organiza- 
tion. Itis the main deliberative organ, and 
decisions are taken in it by a simple 
majority (with a two-thirds majority 
being required for major questions), each 
member having one vote, without dis- 
tinction as to its size or wealth. The Gen- 
eral Assembly decides on the admission 
of new Members on the recommenda- 
tion of the Security Council. The num- 
ber of Member States rose from 76 in 
1955 to 100 in 1960, 127 in 1970, 154 in 
1980 to 185 at the present time. 
The General Assembly meets in 
annual sessions. In principle, the regular 
chart, pages 30-31). 
Principal organs 
session is convened for the third Tues- 
day in September and continues until 
mid-December. However, the General 
Assembly may be convened in special 
sessions at a different date and at a place 
other than New York. 
During a regular session, the General 
Assembly examines the agenda items in 
plenary meeting and in committees. In 
addition to the Special Political and 
Decolonization Committees, there are 
currently five other Main Committees 
responsible respectively for disarma- 
ment and international security; eco- 
nomic and financial matters; social, 
humanitarian and cultural matters; 
administrative and budgetary matters; 
and legal matters. 
The General Assembly approves the 
budget, examines reports from other 
United Nations organs, elects the mem- 
bers of these organs if need be, appoints 
the Secretary-General on the recommen- 
dation of the Security Council, and dis- 
cusses any question or issue within the 
scope of the Charter or affecting the 
powers and functions of any organ of 
the United Nations. It is not, however, 
authorized to adopt resolutions on 
points being discussed by the Security 
Council. 
The decisions of the Assembly have 
no legally binding force, but they carry 
the weight of world opinion on major 
international issues, as well as the moral 
authority of the world community. The 
work of the United Nations derives 
largely from the will of the majority of 
the Member States as expressed in the 
resolutions of the General Assembly.

The Security Council, which was estab- 
lished on 12 January 1946, is composed of 
15 members, including five permanent 
members designated by the Charter 
(China, France, the Russian Federation, 
the United Kingdom, and the United 
States) and ten members elected by the 
General Assembly ina rotation of five for 
a two-year term. 
The keystone of the Organization, 
the Security Council, is so organized as 
to be able to function continuously and 
it may meet elsewhere than at Headquar- 
tersif it considers this advisable. The sole 
organ with the power of coercion, it 
decides on enforcement measures, eco- 
nomic sanctions and the intervention of 
armed forces placed at its disposal by the 
Member States, and has primary respon- 
sibility for the maintenance of interna- 
tional peace and security. 
The Security Council is the only 
organ of the United Nations where the 
principle of equality of the states is 
replaced by the rule of “great power una- 
nimity” (often referred to as the “veto” 
power), whereby the negative vote of 
only one of the five permanent members 
of the Council is sufficient to block a 
decision that has received the assent of 
the fourteen other members, except in 
regard to procedural questions. 
LE NN NN NN 
The Economic and Social Council, 
established on 13 January 1946, has 54 
members elected for three years (with an 
annual rotation of 18 members), who 
meet once a year for five weeks. Its com- 
petence extends to all areas of economic 
and social co-operation. Its year-round 
work is carried out in its subsidiary 
bodies, which include the following: 
& nine commissions and technical 
committees which are responsible in 
particular for questions relating to sta- 
tistics, population and development, 
social development, human rights, the 
status of women, narcotic drugs, science 
and technology, sustainable develop- 
ment, and crime prevention and criminal 
justice; 
® five regional commissions, the main 
instruments of decentralization of 
United Nations action in the economic 
and social fields, with offices at Addis 
Ababa (Ethiopia) for Africa; Santiago 
(Chile) for Latin America and the 
Caribbean; Bangkok (Thailand) for 
Fastern Asia and the Pacific; Geneva 
(Switzerland) for Europe; and Amman

1946. Tt is the principal judicial organ of 
the United Nations and its Statute 1s an 
integral part of the Charter. The Court is 
composed of 15 judges, who are elected 
for a term of nine years. They are chosen 
by the General Assembly and the Secu- 
rity Council on the basis of their qualifi- 
cations, and not of their nationality— 
although no two Judges can be nationals 
of the same state. They may not engage 
in any other occupation during their 
term of office, 
The Court adjudicates legal disputes 
between States submitting their case to 
it. Its rulings are binding on the parties 
having accepted its jurisdiction. It also 
gives advisory opinions on legal ques-

The United Nations International 
Research and Training Institute for 
the Advancement of Women, 
which commenced activities in 
1979, is an emanation of the World 
Conference of the International 
Women’s Year (1975). 
INSTRAW is an autonomous 
body within the United Nations 
system, whose main objective is to 
contribute, through research, 
training and information, to the 
integration of women in the 
economic and social development 
process and to their participation 
in all levels of political life. 
Over the past five years, 
INSTRAW has engaged in a wide 
range of activities on women’s 
work in the informal sector, their 
role in the media, the place they 
occupy in credit, sanitation and 
water supply programmes, and 
the harnessing of new and 
renewable energy sources. Its 
programme of work for the 1994- 
1995 biennium is centred on four 
main themes: the improvement of 
women’s status; statistics and 
indicators concerning women; 
women, the environment and 
sustainable development; and 
communication for development. 
The Institute does not receive 
annual subsidies under the 
contributions to the United 
Nations regular budget, and it 
depends entirely on voluntary 
contributions from UN Member 
States, governmental and non- 
governmental organizations, 
foundations, and private and

Member States which generally 
meets every two years and reports 
to the General Assembly. The 
Environment Fund, UNEDP’s 
financial component, is a 
voluntary fund administered by 
the secretariat. 
UNEDP’s primary role is to 
encourage partnership in caring 
for the environment, by helping 
nations and peoples to improve 
their quality of life, without 
compromising that of future 
generations, through the 
sustainable management and use 
of natural resources. It 
concentrates on issues such as 
atmosphere and climate change, 
deforestation and desertification, 
pollution, and the health of the 
oceans. Its co-ordinating role was 
reinforced by Agenda 21, the 
global plan of action adopted in 
1992 at the UN Conference on 
Environment and Development 
(UNCED). 
More generally, UNEP 1s 
concerned with promoting 
international co-operation, the 
development of international 
environmental law, and the 
improvement and use of 
environmental economic 
instruments and tools. It monitors 
and assesses environmental data, 
transmits information to

UNHCR also defends refugees’ 
rights to employment, education, 
public assistance, access to the

artistic and literary rights and 
industrial property. Entirely 
dependent on voluntary 
contributions from governments 
and private sources, UNHCR 
helps to provide material

UNICEF was established as a 
temporary body in December 
1946 by the General Assembly to 
provide emergency assistance to 
children in war-ravaged countries 
of Europe. In 1953, it was placed 
on a permanent footing and its 
mandate was broadened to help 
children in developing countries. 
UNICEF promotes the 
survival, protection and 
development of children and their 
mothers in such fields as health, 
nutrition, education, water and 
sanitation, and provides relief and 
rehabilitation assistance in 
emergencies (vaccines, basic 
medicines, medical equipment 
and food supplements). One of its 
most important public health 
achievements has been in 
immunization. In what has been 
called “the largest single 
collaborative peace-time effort in 
world history”, the Universal 
Child Immunization (UCI) 
programme launched by 
UNICEF and the World Health 
Organization in 1984 successfully 
vaccinated 80 per cent of the 
world's children by 1990 against 
six major childhood killer diseases 
(measles, poliomyelitis, 
tuberculosis, diphtheria, 
whooping cough and tetanus), 
thus saving the lives of some 9 to 
10 million children in the 
developing world. 
UNICEF also supports the 
implementation of the 
Convention on the Rights of the 
Child, which entered into force as 
international law on 2 September 
1990. As of mid-August 1995, the 
Convention had been ratified by 
177 countries. 
Supported by 38 National 
Committees, mostly in 
industrialized countries, UNICEF 
co-operates in programmes in 144 
countries. It depends mainly on 
voluntary contributions from 
governmental and non- 
governmental sources. Total 
expenditure for 1994 amounted to 
$999 million.

In 1984 the General Assembly 
decided that the activities of the 
Voluntary Fund for the UN 
Decade for Women should be 
continued by the establishment of 
a separate entity, UNIFEM, in 
autonomous association with the 
UN Development Programme 
(UNDP). 
UNIFEM seeks to improve the 
lives of women in developing 
countries, to promote the 
involvement of women in the 
decision-making process of 
mainstream development 
programmes, and their 
achievement of equal status 
through economic and social 
development. UNIFEM considers 
that the best approach is to 
strengthen organizations created 
and managed by women 
themselves by providing direct 
technical and financial support. 
UNIFEM focuses its efforts in 
three main fields: agriculture and 
food security, trade and industry, 
and national planning. The Fund 
also seeks to provide women with 
access to credit, training, science 
and technology, information and 
other tools of development, and 
encourages links and partnership 
between women at grassroots 
level and national and 
international institutions,

The United Nations Institute for 
Training and Research, 
established in 1963, has 
functioned since 1965 as an 
autonomous institution within 
the framework of the UN. It 
provides training to persons, 
particularly from developing 
countries, for assignments with 
the UN or its specialized agencies 
and for assignments in their 
national services which are 
connected with the work of the 
UN, the organizations related to 
it, or other institutions operating 
in related fields. By the end of 
June 1995, more than 23,500 
participants from some 180 
nations had taken part in courses, 
seminars or workshops organized 
by UNITAR. Presently, UNITAR 
is designing and organizing some 
seventy different training 
programmes per year, for the 
benefit of approximately 3,000 
participants on five continents.

UNRWA was created on 8 
December 1949 to provide aid for 
Palestine refugees following the 
Arab-Israeli conflict of 1948, and 
began operations in May 1950. 
Representatives of the ten nations 
which are members of UNRWA’s 
Advisory Committee meet 
annually to review the 
Commisioner-General’s Annual 
Report to the General Assembly. 
The functions of UNRWA are 
to provide essential education, 
health, relief and social services 
directly to the Palestine refugees. 
It runs (with technical assistance 
from UNESCO for education and 
from WHO for health) over 600 
elementary and preparatory 
schools, several vocational and 
technical training centres and 
teacher training programmes, 
some 120 health units, as well as 
community-based rehabilitation 
centres, women’s programme 
centres, etc. It also awards 
scholarships, provides grants and 
loans for income-generating 
projects and emergency relief 
assistance for improvements in 
health clinics, schools and other 
facilities and for job creation 
programmes. 
UNRWA depends almost 
entirely on voluntary 
contributions for both its regular 
and emergency operations.

Created in 1973 and operational 
in September 1975, the United 
Nations University 1s an 
autonomous body functioning 
under the joint auspices of the 
United Nations and UNESCO. 
Headed by a Council comprising 
28 members who are appointed 
for six years in their personal 
capacity and not as 
representatives of their countries, 
plus four permanent members, it 
works through a worldwide 
network of university institutions. 
In addition to the central co- 
ordination and planning body, 
the University has five research 
and training centres and 
programmes’, each specializing in 
a particular field, which co- 
ordinate the activities in which 
the higher educational 
establishments of many countries 
are participating. It is also 
associated with a large number of 
universities and national research 
centres, most of them situated in 
the developing countries, which 
are the focal points of its world 
network. This decentralized 
structure, with its different 
component parts in constant 
interaction, confers on UNU an 
almost in-built flexibility in the 
interdisciplinary approach to the 
problems of the modern world.

The only multilateral food aid 
organization of the UN system, 
WEP was established on a 3-year 
experimental basis in 1961 jointly 
by the Food and Agriculture 
Organization and the General 
Assembly. In 1965, the 
Programme was extended “for as 
long as multilateral food aid is 
found feasible and desirable”. 
WEP provides food aid to 
developing countries both to 
promote development and to help 
alleviate emergencies. In 1994, 44 
per cent of WEP beneficiaries (25 
million people) were victims of 
wars, ethnic conflicts and civil 
strife in 41 countries. Another 13 
per cent (7.5 million people) were 
afflicted by droughts and other 
natural disasters in 8 countries. 
Some 60 per cent of the 
beneficiaries of WFP development 
aid obtain family rations by 
participating in labour-intensive 
programmes to construct 
infrastructure and create assets 
essential for their longer-term 
advancement. 
WEP is funded through 
voluntary contributions from UN 
and FAO member countries and 
intergovernmental bodies. It 
currently has 225 on-going 
development projects in 83 
countries and some 50 relief 
operations in 41 countries.

Origin: The ILO was established on 28 June 1919 (its 
Constitution having become operative on 11 April) 
by the Treaty of Versailles (France) as anautonomous 
body associated with the League of Nations. On 14 
December 1946, it became a specialized agency associ- 
ated with the United Nations. 
Administration: The International Labour Confer- 
ence, a world parliament on labour issues, meets once 
a year and is attended by delegations from all the 
member countries. Each delegation is composed of 
two government delegates, one delegate representing 
workers and one representing employers. The Gov- 
erning Body, ILO’s executive organ, comprises 28 
government delegates (including 10 permanent dele- 
gates, the others Being elected for a term of 3 years), 
14 employer delegates and 14 worker delegates. The 
International Labour Office is the permanent secre- 
tariat of the ILO. 
Objectives: To promote social justice and raise living 
and working standards throughout the world. 
Functions: Adopting international labour standards 
(in the form of conventions and recommendations). 
Every state ratifying a convention undertakes 
thereby to apply it nd accepts de facto the principle 
of international monitoring. Recommendations, 
which are not subject to ratification, provide guid- 
ance for national legislation and practice. Since it was 
founded, ILO has adopted 174 conventions and 181 
recommendations constituting the International 
Labour Code in such areas as the fundamental rights 
of working people (freedom of association, prohibi- 
tion of forced labour, elimination of discrimina- 
tion), wages, hours and conditions of work, public 
employment services, social services, welfare protec- 
tion schemes, job relations, protection of mothers 
and children, migrants and certain categories of 
workers, and labour inspection. 
Activities: Activities connected with the setting and 
monitoring of standards draw on work done in con- 
nection with research and publications and on the 
organization of technical meetings,’ In addition, a 
wide-ranging technical co-operation programme 1s 
carried out in liaison with other United Nations 
organs, Through a policy of active partnership, ILO 
provides Member States with expertise and advice in 
all its fields of competence, such as employment pol- 
icy, vocational training, management techniques, 
occupational safety and health, improvement of 
social security systems, sectoral activities, co-opera- 
tives and the strengthening of employers’ and work- 
ers’ organizations.’ 
Observations: With a view to strengthening the effec- 
tiveness of its legal arsenal against child labour (sev- 
eral conventions on which were adopted between 
1919 and 1973), in 1992-1993 ILO launched an Inter- 
national Programme on the Elimination of Child 
Labour (IPEC). This Programme is already opera- 
tional in some ten countries and is making rapid 
strides.

Origin: The International Civil Aviation Organiza- 
tion (ICAO) was founded with the signing of the 
Convention on International Civil Aviation in 
Chicago (U.S.A.) on 7 December 1944. The Conven- 
tion entered into force on 4 April 1947 after its ratifi- 
cation by 26 States. ICAO became a specialized

Origin: The World Bank is composed of four institu- 
tions: the International Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development {IBRD or the Bank), which was estab- 
lished in 1945, a year after its Articles of Agreement had 
been drawn up by a United Nations monetary and 
financial conference attended by 44 Governments at 
Bretton Woods (U.S.A); the International Finance 
Corporation (IFC), created in 1956; the International 
Development Association (IDA), created in 1960; and 
the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency 
(MIGA), created in 1988. 
Administration: All powers in the Bank are vested in 
the Board of Governors, composed of one Governor 
and one alternate from each Member State. The Pres- 
ident of the World Bank is ex officio President of the 
four institutions. 
The Development Committee is a forum bringing 
together the Boards of Governors of the World Bank 
and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to dis- 
cuss international economic co-operation. The Inter- 
national Centre for the Settlement of Investment 
Disputes (ICSID) is managed by a Board composed 
of one representative of each Member State and 
chaired by the President of the Bank. 
Objectives: To improve living standards in develop- 
ing countries by granting them financial resources 
provided by the industrialized countries. 
The Intemational Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development (IBRD) 
» Number of member countries: 178 
Functions: Assisting in the reconstruction and devel- 
opment of territories of its members by facilitating the 
investment of capital for productive purposes (agricul- 
ture, energy, education, health, family planning, roads, 
telecommunications); promoting private foreign 
investment on reasonable terms; contributing to the 
long-term development of international trade. 
Activities: In addition to granting loans, IBRD pro- 
vides a wide range of technical assistance services. The 
Bank’s capital 1s subscribed by the Member States. 
However, it finances its lending operations primarily 
from its own borrowings in world markets, as well as 
from retained earnings and repayments on ts loans. 
Observations: In accordance with its Statutes, IBRD 
can only make loans for productive purposes; each 
loan must be guaranteed by the Government con- 
cerned and, except in special circumstances, must be 
for specific projects. IBRD’s lending decisions are 
supposed to be based only on economic considera- 
tions, but since 1980 it has also supported pro- 
grammes for the readjustment of economic policies 
and institutional reform. 
The International Finance Corporation (IFC) 
} Number of member countries: 162 
Functions: Helping to finance private enterprise with- 
out guarantee of repayment by the government con- 
cerned; bringing together investment opportunities 
and stimulating the flow of private capital domestic 
and foreign, into productive investment in member 
countries. 
Activities: Invests primarily in manufacturing, but 
also in mining and energy, tourism and agriculture. 
Observations: While closely associated with the 
World Bank, the IFC is a separate legal entity and has 
its own resources, which chiefly come from the sub- 
scriptions of its member countries and from accu- 
mulated profits. 
The Intemational Development Association (IDA) 
) Number of member countries: 157 
Functions: Providing the poor countries with loans 
on much more flexible terms than IBRD. 
Activities: Grants credits over a period of 50 years, 
usually interest-free. Repayment of principal does 
not begin until after a 10-year grace period. 
Observations: 1D A's resources come from the net carn- 
ings of the World Bank, capital subscribed in convertible 
currencies by its members, and contributions from its 
richer members. In order to borrow from IDA, a coun- 
try must meet four criteria: it must be below the 
“poverty line”; it must have sufficient economic, finan- 
cial and political stability to warrant long-term develop- 
ment lending; it must have serious balance-of-payments 
problems; and it must have a genuine commitment to 
development as reflected in its policies.

Origin: Established on 27 December 1945, following 
the ratification of the Bretton Woods Agreements 
(US.A., July 1944—see entry on the World Bank). 
Administration: The Board of Governors, composed 
of one representative and one alternate for each mem- 
ber country, meets annually; it decides quotas and the 
conditions of accession to the Fund. The Execuuve 
Board is responsible for the conduct of the day-to-day 
business of IME It is composed of 24 members (5 of 
them appointed by the member countries having the 
largest quotas’ and 19 elected’ by the others) and is 
chaired by the Managing Director, who is elected by the 
Board. 
Objectives: To exercise surveillance over the eco- 
nomic policies of its member countries; foster mone- 
tary co-operation, exchange-rate stability and the bal- 
anced growth of international trade; administer a code 
of conduct regarding exchange-rate policies; promote a 
multilateral payments settlement system; provide 
member countries with the financial resources neces- 
sary to help them correct their payments imbalances 
without jeopardizing national prosperity; foster their 
mutual collaboration; and provide technical assistance 
asrequired. 
Functions and activities: The IMF has the power to 
allocate international reserve assets in the form of 
SDRs.’ It also provides financial support on conces- 
sional terms for low-income member countries 
under the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility 
(ESAF). The resources which the IMF can lend 
come mainly from the quotas of the member coun- 
tries, in other words from their subscriptions to the 
Fund’s capital.* Each country pays a contribution cor- 
responding to its economic size.’ The IMF is autho- 
rized to raise loans from official lenders in order to 
supplement its resources, It may also draw on a line 
of credit of SDR18.5 billion (US$27 billion) which has 
been opened by various countries under the “Gen- 
eral Arrangements to Borrow” (GAB). 
Observations: The IMF’s lending policy is guided by 
the following principles: any member country bor- 
rowing a given currency is expected to return it as 
soon as its payments problems have been solved, so 
as not to limit other members’ access to the same cur- 
rency; before taking a loan, the country must demon- 
strate how it intends to solve its payments problems, 
so that it can repay the Fund within a repayment 
period of three to five years (but which may, if neces- 
sary, be up to ten years).

operation between all the Union’s members for the 
improvement and rational use of telecommunication 
systems. 
Functions: Promoting the creation, development and 
efficient operation of technical facilities, with a view 
to improving the efficiency of telecommunication 
services, increasing their usefulness and making them 
generally available to the public; encouraging interna- 
tional co-operation to provide the developing coun- 
tries with the technical assistance they request; 
extending new telecommunication technologies to all 
the countries of the world and co-ordinating the har- 
monization of national services. 
Activities: ITU lays down the rules applicable to the 
allocation and registration of radio frequencies 
throughout the world and to the assignation of the 
orbital positions of geostationary satellites, in order 
to avoid interference between radio stations of dif- 
ferent countries. It encourages agreement between its 
members on rates that are as low as possible. In col- 
laboration with the international funding and devel- 
opment agencies, ITU endeavours to promote the 
setting up of preferential lines of credit, so that 
telecommunication services can be extended to the 
most isolated regions of countries.

rological Organization (IMO) founded in 1873, 
WMO became a specialized agency of the United 
Nations on 20 December 1951. 
Administration: The World Meteorological Con- 
gress, the supreme body of WMO, meets every four 
years to determine general policy, programmes and 
budget. The Executive Council, composed of 36 
directors of national meteorological services, meets 
once a year, Six Regional Assoctations’ are fora for 
members of WMO and are responsible for supervis- 
ing the implementation of the resolutions of the 
Congress and the Executive Council. Eight technical 
commissions are responsible for studying various 
branches of meteorology and operational hydrology. 
Objectives: To facilitate worldwide co-operation in 
meteorology, climatology, operational hydrology 
and other related disciplines. 
Functions: Promoting the establishment and mainte- 
nance of meteorological centres and systems for 
making and exchanging information; promoting 
standardization and uniform publication of meteo- 
rological observations and statistics; furthering the 
application of meteorology to aviation, shipping, 
water resources, agriculture and other human activi- 
ties; encouraging research and professional training.

merly called the Inter-Governmental Maritime Con- 
sultative Organization—IMCQ"), which was drafted 
in Geneva (Switzerland) on 6 March 1948, came into 
force on 17 March 1958, after it had been ratified by 
21 states, including seven with at least 1 million gross 
tons of shipping each. IMO was recognized as a spe- 
cialized agency of the United Nations in January 
1959. 
Administration: The Assembly, consisting of repre- 
sentatives of all Member States, lays down IMO’s 
policy and priorities. Every two years it elects a 32- 
member Council, which is the governing body 
between the Assembly’s biennial sessions. Four prin- 
cipal committees (on legal matters, marine safety, 
marine environment protection and technical co- 
operation) submit reports or recommendations to 
the Assembly through the Council. 
Objectives: To assist in the development of shipping 
services and the expansion of maritime trade; to 
encourage the elimination of restrictive practices by 
shipping companies. 
Functions and activities: Sets standards, by drawing 
up conventions and adopting recommendations 
aimed at improving maritime safety, preventing 
marine pollution by ships, and training maritime 
personnel; promotes the adoption of international 
agreements. 
Observations: IMO provides a forum for member 
governments and interested organizations to 
exchange views on technical, administrative and legal 
problems.

Origin: The Agreement establishing the Fund was 
adopted by a United Nations conference held in 
Rome in June 1976 and came into force on 30 
November 1977. 
Administration: The Governing Council comprises 
representatives of all the Member States, who are 
divided into three categories, each with the same vot- 
ing power: developed countries (members of 
OECD"), key contributor member countries (mem- 
bers of OPEC?) and other developing countries, 
which are mainly the beneficiaries. Each category has 
equal representation on the Governing Council and 
the Executive Board, which is responsible for super- 
vising the Fund’s operations. 
Objectives: To mobilize resources for improved 
food production and better nutrition among low- 
income groups in developing countries. 
Functions and activities: Fostering the development 
of the poorest rural communities; helping to 
increase food production; improving local prospects 
for employment and nutrition; designing and 
financing projects, with or without the participation 
of other institutions such as the World Bank and the 
regional development banks (the African, Asian, 
Inter-American and Islamic Development Banks). 
Observations: IFAD pays special attention to grass- 
roots development in rural areas through an innova- 
tive approach to problems and the preservation of 
natural resources. For every dollar contributed in 
support of its projects, it has mobilized two dollars 
from other external donors. By the end of 1994, it 
had invested almost $44.5 billion in nearly 400 pro- 
jects in 102 developing countries. When they have 
been completed, they are expected to benefit some 
230 million people.

Origin: The World Trade Organization was estab- 
lished on 1 January 1995, replacing GATT (the Gen- 
eral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade’) upon comple- 
tion of the Uruguay Round negotiations’. Whereas 
GATT was a multilateral treaty applying ona provi- 
sional basis, WTO has the legal personality of a 
fully-fledged international organization, like the 
International Monetary Fund or the World Bank. 
Like GATT, however, it does not have the official 
status of a specialized agency of the United Nations, 
although links have been established with it. 
Objectives: To increase production, trade and 
investment; further the active participation of the 
developing countries in world trade. 
Functions: Administering and implementing the 
whole range of multilateral trade agreements which 
together form the Organization's structure; fur- 
thering international trade negotiations; endeavour- 
ing to settle trade disputes; overseeing national trade 
policies; co-operating with the other international 
institutions which participate in the formulation of 
world economic policy. 
Activities: The new multilateral trade system— 
which is subtended by a number of fundamental 
principles aimed in particular at ensuring the secu- 
rity and predictability of trade in goods and ser- 
vices—covers a volume of trade amounting to a value 
of close on $6,000 billion. 
Unlike GATT, WTO rules will cover commercial 
activities such as trade in services, intellectual prop- 
erty and investment. In GATT’s traditional sphere 
of activity, the rules on international competition 
have been spelt out much more clearly, and ranff 
barriers to trade will be significantly lowered, by an 
average of 40 per cent over asix-year period. GATT’s 
conciliation system, which enabled it to settle dis- 
putes between its members in all its areas of activity, 
has been considerably strengthened. Technical co- 
operation in favour of the developing countries has 
also been improved. 
1. These are member countries of GATT which have completed 
their legislative ratification procedures. Their number is expected to 
increase to 150 by the end of 1995. GATT currently has 125 
members, 
2. GATT came into force on 1 January 1948. 
3. In order to make for a smooth transition between GATT and 
WTO and enable the largest possible number of countries to 
complete their ratification procedures, GATT will continue to 
function in parallel with WTO until 31 December 1995,

Origin: IAEA commenced its activities in Vienna ’ 
(Austria) in July 1957. In November of the same 
year, the General Assembly of the United Nations 
approved an agreement governing relations between 
IAEA and the United Nations. IAEA isan indepen- 
dent intergovernmental organization created under 
the aegis of the UN. Although it does not have the 
official status of a UN specialized agency, it submits 
an annual report to the General Assembly and, if 
necessary, to the Security Council and the Economic 
and Social Council. 
Administration: The General Conference, composed 
of all the Member States, meets annually to adopt 
the Agency's policy, budget and programmes. These 
are implemented by the Board of Governors, which 
is composed of 35 members (22 of whom are elected 
for two years by the General Conference and 13 are 
appointed for one year by the Board). 
Objectives: To seek to accelerate and enlarge the con- 
tribution of atomic energy to peace, health and 
prosperity throughout the world. 
Functions: Ensuring that nuclear materials and 
equipment intended for peaceful use are not 
diverted to military purposes; setting standards for 
nuclear safety and environmental protection; serv- 
ing as an intermediary between Member States; facil- 
itating the transfer of technology, and providing 
advisers, equipment and training services for the 
developing countries; managing an international

The right to food is the most fundamental 
of human rights. Throughout history 
chronic hunger, whether caused by war, drought, 
poverty or natural disaster, has led to widespread 
suffering, and freedom from hunger remains a 
long-cherished goal. Alongside peace, hunger is the 
most pressing of all issues. : 
There must be two principal components in 
any strategy to eradicate hunger. One is to increase 
food production in order to feed an expanding 
world population. The second is to alleviate 
poverty at least to the point where every person 
has access to the food they need for a healthy life. 
While the Food and Agriculture Organization 
concentrates on helping to ensure sustainable 
expansion of agricultural production and pro- 
ductivity, we also promote the concept that, 
where feasible, a greater emphasis by developing 
nations on the agriculture sector can make a pow- 
erful contribution to combating poverty. This 
follows from the fact that the majority of the 
poor in most developing countries depend on 
agriculture for employment and incomes. As 
Tea i fT SR, mu 
w i » - 
long as this dependence continues, the growth of 
food production and of agricultural produc- 
tivity in the countries with high concentrations 
of rural poverty will continue to be among the 
principal means of alleviating poverty and 
improving nutrition. 
The dimensions of the hunger problem are 
great. In the developing countries 800 million 
people are chronically undernourished. Among 
them, 192 million children under the age of five 
suffer from acute or chronic protein and energy 
deficiencies. Hundreds of millions more suffer ail- 
ments such as retarded growth, blindness and 
impaired vision or goitre because their diets lack 
essential vitamins and minerals. 
Progress has been made, both in absolute and 
per caput terms. For example, the figure of 800 
million undernourished people mentioned above 
is down from 893 million in 1969-1971. It is pro- 
jected to drop further to 730 million in 2010, a 
figure which still represents an appalling level of 
suffering and wasted human potential. Happily, 
the number of undernourished people as a per- 
centage of total population has declined appre- 
ciably over the last two decades and is expected to 
continue to drop. 
At present, 88 nations fall into the category of 
low-income food-deficit countries. Forty-four of 
these are in Africa, 19 in Asia and the Pacific, nine 
in Latin America, four in the Near East and 12 in

the states of the former Soviet Union. The net 
food deficits of the developing countries are 
expected to continue to grow, and the developing 
countries as a whole will soon turn from being net 
agricultural exporters into net importers. These are 
alarming prospects given the difficult balance of 
payments situation and the unfavourable eco- 
nomic prospects for many developing countries. 
Nothing short of a significant upgrading of 
the overall development performance of the lag- 
ging economies, with emphasis on a more equi- 
table sharing of the benefits, will free the world of 
the most pressing food insecurity problems. The 
only feasible option for an early and sustainable 
improvement in food security is the enhancement 
of the productivity and production of food. The 
key to such gains is efficient technology, applied 
to the commodities that can make a difference. 
The basic goal of food security is one that peo- 
ples, governments and the international commu- 
—— 
{

nity have no alternative but to address. Yet certain 
trends are not encouraging. Developmental com- 
mitment from bilateral and multilateral sources to 
developing country agriculture is declining. 
Between 1981 and 1992, overall amounts dropped 
from $12.3 billion to $8.5 billion, in constant 1980 
U.S. dollars. During this period, agriculture's share 
of total development assistance fell from 25 per 
cent to 17 per cent. 
I believe that now is the time to raise public 
awareness and to promote political commitment 
at the highest level for a global campaign to pro- 
vide food security for all. The Food and Agricul- 
ture Organization will host a World Food 
Summit in November 1996 to pursue this com- 
mitment. Only a combination of faster, poverty- 
reducing development and appropriate public 
policy, both national and international, will ulti- 
mately improve access to food by the poor and 
eliminate chronic undernutrition. um 
IAEA's activities are directly relevant to a 
number of areas that are vital to the future 
weapons, energy, the environment and develop- 
. ment assistance. 
The number of states acceding to the Non-Pro- 
liferation Treaty (NPT) has grown significantly in 
recent years, For example, several republics of the 
former Soviet Union—notably Ukraine—along 
with South Africa and, quite recently, Algeria have 
joined the 169 countries which had already signed 
the Treaty. This has led to the broadening of the 
nuclear materials safeguards system, which now 
covers more than 1,000 installations all over the 
world. To perform this field work, IAEA has a 
team of 200 inspectors and an annual budget of 
some $68 million. It is currently envisaging the 
introduction of new technical methods to increase 
the effectiveness of monitoring operations. 
On two occasions in recent years, this funda- 
mental activity has come up against major diffi- 
culties—in Iraq and in the Democratic People’s 
Republic of Korea. However, IAEA remains res- 
olutely optimistic regarding its ability to con- 
tribute substantially to the efforts deployed to 
circumscribe the danger which nuclear weapons 
can still represent for world security, in spite of 
the end of the Cold War. 
With regard to the environment, the energy 
sources chosen by all of us will continue to play 
a fundamental role if we wish to halt the process 
of degradation that is already well under way. The 
choice of a viable form of electricity production 
in the coming decades will chiefly lie between 
“polluting” fuels, such as coal, oil and gas (above 
all from carbon dioxide), and nuclear energy, 
from which the emanations are negligible.

It is up to every country to make its own

The shortage of resources for development 
caused by the world crisis which followed 
the collapse of the Soviet Union makes it essen- 
tial that these resources should be rationally and 
effectively managed. 
With this in view, a number of innovations 
have been introduced into the project cycle of the 
International Fund for Agricultural Develop- 
ment (IFAD), in order to make these projects 
less costly and more suited to the real needs of 
the Fund’s clients. The resulting savings will be 
used to strengthen operations in priority sectors. 
IFAD is devoting increased attention to tech- 
nical assistance. A lasting reduction in poverty 
requires technologies of a new type that will be 
both intrinsically suited to the purpose and 
financially affordable. IFAD has applied itself to 
persuading international research institutes to 
shift their priorities and strategies and to give 
prominence in their schedules to the needs of 
small farmers and other disadvantaged people 
living in rural areas. This preoccupation is at the 
root of the Fund’s efforts to foster partnerships 
between national agricultural research systems in

energy source, but all are agreed that nuclear 
energy should be exploited under the best pos- 
sible safety conditions. It is from this standpoint 
that IAEA is devoting considerable efforts to 
enhancing the safety of nuclear installations, in 
particular at the request of countries, including 
those of the former Soviet Union and of Eastern 
Europe, wishing to obtain the Agency’s opinion 
and support in regard to the operation of their 
nuclear power stations. Last year, the first Inter- 
national Convention on Safety laid down stan- 
dards in this area, to which some 50 countries 
have already signified their assent. 
Lastly, IAEA is also endeavouring to transfer 
peaceful nuclear techniques in a number of fields 
to its developing member countries. These 
include the eradication of the tsetse fly and the 
fruit fly by the sterile insect technique, the pro- 
duction by radiation of mutant cultivated plants 
that are more capable of withstanding crop-dev- 
astating organisms or difficult climatic condi- 
tions, the use of radioactive isotope tracers to 
detect water resources, and the use of radiation in 
combating cancer. JAEA attaches the utmost 
importance to these transfers, which are a key fea- 
ture of its work programme. nu

research institutions. 
IFAD also attaches special importance to the 
elaboration of joint strategies and alliances with 
other financing and development agencies. Such 
collaboration has to go beyond the co-financing 
of projects. IFAD’s vast experience could be used 
to advantage on a broader front in connection 
with joint approaches to combating poverty in 
rural areas. The idea is to establish a package of 
programmes, centred on an IFAD-type project, 
which would benefit from substantial funding 
from other international financing agencies.

duced on a larger scale, which would considerably

(WEF) are currently examining ways and means of 
strengthening their collaboration in contending 
with the interdependent problems of poverty and 
the environment. Breaking the vicious circle of 
rural poverty and the degradation of the environ- 
ment has long been at the heart of IFAD’S con- 
cerns, especially in connection with the Special Pro- 
gramme for the countries of sub-Saharan Africa. 
Through innovative projects and specialized studies 
carried out under this programme, new ways have 
been found of helping small farmers to protect the

agriculture. IFAD is intent on making the most of 
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) 
In the last 50 years, many changes have taken 
place in the world economy, all of which 
have had an impact on the work of the Interna- 
tional Monetary Fund (IMF). These changes have 
included the emergence and growth of the devel- 
oping countries—today there are almost 130 of 
them among the IMF's 179 members; the trend 
toward greater symmetry 1n economic size among 
the industrial countries; the increased interna- 
tional mobility of goods, capital, and labour, and 
the associated international integration of mar- 
kets; the trend towards regional integration; and 
the integration of the formerly centrally planned 
economies into the world market economic 
system and the IMF itself. 
But the influence has not been only one-way: 
some of the changes can be attributed to a signif- 
icant extent to the work of the IME. Over the 
years the IMF has come to see more clearly that 
macroeconomic policies need to be conducted 
within a medium-term framework of monetary 
stability and fiscal rectitude and have to be sup- 
ported by structural, cost-effective social and 
environmental policies; that restrictions on cap- 
ital flows are generally not to be recommended as 
an instrument of policy; that the requirements 
of maintaining pegged exchange rates, especially 
in the face of increasingly voluminous and agile 
international capital markets, as revealed by the 
Mexican crisis, are demanding. 
These developments have been reflected in each 
of the IMF's three major areas of activity. 
First, in the provision of financial assistance: 
one major change is the concentration of the 
IMF's financing operations in recent years on 
developing countries and countries in transition 
this experience in the framework both of concerted 
action with WEF and of the International Conven- 
tion to Combat Desertification and Drought. 
The coming years arc likely to be difficult 
ones. Resources will be limited, while needs will 
keep on growing. It is imperative therefore that 
every dollar at our disposal should be used as 
effectively as possible. Success in banishing 
hunger in twenty years, thirty years or a century 
will depend on the sense of commitment of the 
donor and beneficiary countries and on the inter- 
national institutions. IFAD, in its modest and 
positive fashion, is paving the way. |

and the introduction of new financing facilities 
operating in a more flexible framework. These 
adaptations have enabled the IMF to continue 
serving the needs of countries in balance of pay- 
ments difficulties, to play its role in resolving the 
debt crisis and recent systemic crisis in Mexico, 
to make its contribution to growth-oriented 
adjustment in the developing countries, and to 
play its full role in Russia and the other transi- 
tion economies. 
Second, the IMF has adapted its role in the 
exchange rate system. It has responsibility for 
exercising “firm surveillance” over the exchange 
rate policies of members, which involves surveil- 
lance over all policies impinging on exchange 
rates. IMF surveillance is conducted through reg- 
ular—usually annual—consultations with indi- 
vidual member countries, and through consider- 
ation of policy issues in a global context. This has 
been and remains the IMF's principal means of 
promoting exchange stability. 
The third main area of IMF activity is the 
provision of technical assistance to member gov- 
ernments in its areas of expertise, including fiscal 
policy, central banking and monetary policy, and 
economic statistics. There has been a dramatic 
growth in demand for these services in recent 
years, especially to help with institution- 
building in the countries in transition. [|

of this human explosion as well as to ensuring a 
better life for the three quarters of humankind 
who live in developing countries. 
A complex range of development problems 
have to be tackled in most of these countries,

ever for the economic survival of the South. As 
new challenges emerge for developing nations and 
economies in transition, the demand for indus- 
trial services is increasingly at the forefront of 
development issues. 
The future of UNIDO lies in providing the 
services essential to meet the demands of industrial

Responding to the recent dramatic changes in the

ore than half the earth’s 
population are women. 
Although they account for 
two-thirds of all the hours worked 
in the world, women receive only a 
tenth of the total earnings. Two- 
thirds of them suffer from the 
handicap of illiteracy. UNESCO has 
always sought to remedy the 
inequalities of which women are 
victims, and action to improve 
women’s status is a common 
denominator of programmes in all 
its fields of competence. 
But while there is no signifi- 
cant difference in status 
between, for example, male and 
female astronauts trained in the 
industrialized countries, the sit- 
uation is quite different in 
regions where women still bear 
sole responsibility for family 
care, work in the fields and main- 
taining water supplies. As Sabine 
Estier wrote in Le Journal de 
Genéve of 5 June 1995: “Con- 
trary to a widespread assump- 
tion, women do not naturally ben- 
efit from overall development. In 
countries where they are less

desired at birth, less well fed, 
less well looked after and less 
well educated than men, they 
miss out on projects designed and 
executed by men.” 
I —
DIFFERENT PRIORITIES 
A typical example is to be found 
in Culture and Agriculture, a 
remarkable document published 
by the secretariat of UNESCO’s 
World Decade for Cultural Devel- 
opment: “When project officers 
set out to implement a community 
forestry project in Nepal a few 
years ago, they wanted to do the 
right thing,” writes Vicki L. 
Wilde. “They went directly to the 
villagers and asked what kind of 
trees they wanted to plant. ‘Hard- 
wood trees’ was the answer, so the 
project provided 3,000 hardwood 
seedlings—and all 3,000 seedlings 
subsequently died from lack of 
care. Why? Because the project 
officers . . . consulted only the 
male villagers, who were only 
interested in wood for furniture- 
making and carving that could 
     
  
  
   
   
earn them cash. But, by tradition, 
it was the women who planted and 
watered tree seedlings.” 
The women were not interested 
in slow-growing trees. As they 
spent six hours a day collecting 
fuel and fodder, they would have 
preferred fast-growing species to 
ease their burden. 
Another graphic example of 
the relation between gender and 
development comes from southern 
India, where women used to earn 
their living working on tea planta- 
tions. When irrigation technology 
was introduced into tea produc- 
tion, it was the men who were 
taught how to use it and they took 
over the women’s jobs. It was soon 
noticed that the children in the 
area were beginning to suffer from 
increased malnutrition. The reason 
was that women had lost their 
source of income, and in house- 
holds in this part of India it was 
they who were responsible for 
earning the money to buy food; 
the men spent their money in 
other ways.

“The division of responsibilities is 
very much a part of the culture of 
a country,” Wilde goes on, “but it 
can also vary greatly from village 
to village depending on tradition, 
social customs, the economics, the 
environmental situation and the 
degree of development.” She cites 
two examples from the moun- 
tainous Khao Kho region of north- 
eastern Thailand. Among the

In the Indian region of Maha- 
rashtra, water is in short supply 
and of poor quality. In a study of 
water scarcity in the region, B. 
Rao has shown how this too is con- 
nected with the structure of 
society. Deep wells were sunk by 
wealthy farmers although common 
wells had dried up, and increases 
in sugar-cane cultivation also 
reduced the amount of water avail- 
able for households. When a pro- 
ject to pump water to villages was 
established, however, it failed to 
acknowledge women as individuals. 
Traditionally, only men can own 
land, and under the pumping 
scheme only men were granted 
water rights. On the other hand, it 
was still the women’s task to fetch 
water, and when access to it 
became easier the men shifted 
responsibility for some of their own 
tasks to them. 
A HEAVY ENERGY BILL 
Satisfying daily energy needs is a 
“massive burden on women in devel- 
oping countries. “In low-income 
countries such as Burkina Faso, 
Ethiopia and Nepal, the house- 
hold sector accounts for more than 
90 per cent of total energy con- 
sumption,” says E. Cecelski in a 
WHO document entitled Women, 
Health and Environment. “Use of 
tree, crop and animal residues for 
fuel deprives the soil of recycled 
nutrients and reduces crop yields 
along with the land’s capacity to 
support livestock.”

FRANCE’S COASTLINE 
CONSERVATION 
COMMISSION 
Since it was established in 1975, France's 
Coastline Conservation Commission has 
acquired almost 45,000 hectares of land 
along the seaboard, along with lakes cov- 
ering an area of over 1,000 hectares, and 
sites on estuaries and deltas. Ten per cent 
of the French coastline has already been 
protected in this way. The purchases, which 
are mainly paid for by the state, have been 
made by mutual agreement in 85 per cent 
of the cases. Management of the 339 sites 
acquired in this way has been entrusted to 
local authorities, nature conservation asso- 
ciations or farmers. The aim is to prevent 
any new buildings from being erected, 
demolish those disfiguring the landscape, 
and ban motor traffic and campsites, while 
at the same time providing proper recep- 
tion facilities for visitors, who last year 
numbered 15 million. The purchase of a 
further 60,000 hectares is planned over 
the next few years. The Conservation Com- 
mission recently participated in the setting 
up of a similar agency in Tunisia. | 
  
- COOKING BEANS WITH 
| SUGAR CANE 
The Pan-African News Agency (PANA) reports 
an interesting initiative in Sudan. The 
country’s first factory for turning sugar-cane 
waste into fuel was brought into operation 
in May 1995 by the Sudan Development Cor- 
poration. It makes combustible bricks from 
a mixture of molasses and bagasse (cane 
residues after sugar extraction), thus elimi- 
nating the need to fell trees for charcoal pro- 
duction. The bricks cost 75 per cent less to 
produce than charcoal. This ingenious 
process makes it possible to cook a potful 
of beans for only 200 Sudanese pounds, or 
five times less than the cost of using fire- 
wood. The factory plans to process 6 million 
tonnes of bagasse a year, the equivalent of 
8,000 tonnes of fuel. |

volcanic Lake Nyos, in Cameroon, has at 
last been degassed. It was the scene of a 
disaster in 1986, when 1,700 people were 
asphyxiated by emanations of carbon 
dioxide from the waters of the lake, which 
contains huge quantities of the gas. At the 
time, UNEsco held a scientific conference in 
Yaoundé, in conjunction with the Govern- 
ment of Cameroon. In 1992, a Franco- 
Cameroonian team succeeded in extracting 
HOTELS 
carbon dioxide from neighbouring Lake 
Monoun. In March this year, the degassing 
of Lake Nyos—a much more difficult task 
because it is 200 metres deep and its 
waters are saturated with the gas—was 
successfully carried out. But the “killer 
lakes” will have to remain under surveil- 
lance. The degassing technique developed 
by the Geophysical Instrumentation Labo- 
ratory in Chambéry (France) could prove to 
be useful in other parts of the world, 
notably in Indonesia. nm 
  
A GOOD 
ENVIRONMENT GUIDE 
FOR HOTELS 
The United Nations Environment Programme 
(UNEP) has just published (in English) an 
“Environmental Action Pack for Hotels”, 
whose appearance is particularly timely in 
view of the growth of tourism. The pack pro- 
vides hoteliers with information enabling 
them to implement a recommended plan of 
action by taking practical steps in such areas 
as water, wastes and energy, and to monitor 
their performance with the help of check 
lists. [|

The Scientific Education of Girls 
An Education Beyond Reproach? 
by the French Commission for UNESCO under 
the supervision of Renée Clair 
1995, 207 pp., ISBN 92-3-103168-6, 149 FF 
Experience has shown that, even if their 
capabilities equal those of boys, many 
girls choose to turn away from the 
sciences for numerous conscious and 
unconscious reasons, a situation which is 
worth while studying. This book focuses 
on assessing situations and diagnosing the 
causes. It also gives some examples of 
national strategies designed to fight this 
insidious trend.   
The Vortex Family 
A Family Saga Set in Haiti 
by Jean Métellus 
1995, 232 pp., ISBN 92-3-103092-2, 135 FF 
The Vortex Family is a richly poetic 
novel, set in Haiti in 1949, by one of 
Haiti’s leading contemporary writers. 
The characters, Solon and Olga and their 
middle-class family, reflect Haiti’s 
cultural richness: they are cheerful, 
violent, cynical and generous. The book 
affirms with sensual brilliance the life 
force of the Haitian people, which 
prevails over political intrigue, and it 
casts light on an enigmatic and 
mysterious land. 
 
Study Abroad 
29th edition 
1995, 1,376 pp., ISBN 92-3-003148-8, 120 FF 
The New Page 
by Federico Mayor 
1995, 98 pp., ISBN 92-3-102949-5, 215 FF . . 
PP A complete guide to plan your studies 
abroad. It contains detailed information 
on 3,082 offers in 134 countries for 1996 
and 1997 in all academic and professional 
disciplines in post-secondary education. 
For Federico Mayor, Director-General of 
UNESCO, only a culture of peace, based 
on a culture of democracy, may ensure 
the possibility of changing radically our 
economic, social and political perceptions 
comprising the interests and needs of the 
North and South in a new renaissance of 
hope and creativity. 
  
Working with Street Children 
Selected Case-studies from Africa, Asia and 
Latin America 
1995, 304 pp., illus., ISBN 92-3-103096-5, 100 FF 
This book shows how individuals and 
non-governmental organizations, includ- 
ing many religious organizations, have set 
up tens of thousands of highly effective 
projects throughout the world to ensure 
the reinsertion of street children into 
their families and/or society through 
education. 
Maria Calleja’s Gozo 
A Life History 
1994, 246 pp., illus., 92-3-102977-0, 170 FF 
Legendary home of Calypso, Gozo, in 
the Maltese archipelago, has a long 
history going back beyond Classical 
times. Its culture has been shaped by 
Phoenicians, Romans, Arabs, Normans, 
Germans, French, Spaniards, and the 
Hospitaller Order of St John of 
Jerusalem. Against this island setting, 
Maria Calleja tells her own story by 
opening a window into the Gozitan life 
and the vanishing traditions in a changing 
world.
