### 83410: Interview with Richard Attenborough

The director of Gandbi and Cry Freedom 
the topicality of films about Third World countries and the 
prospects for African cinema, 
reflects on 
Richard Attenborough 
  
How did you come to make a film about apartheid? 
— I wanted to make a film about South Africa and com- 
missioned several scripts but until I read Donald Woods’ 
book I had not found a subject which I felt was sufficiently 
pertinent or which contained sufficient optimism and hope 
for the future, Nor had I found a subject which I felt had 
a chance of reaching a sufficiently large number of people. 
It seemed to me that to reach only an audience which was 
already aware of what was happening in South Africa and 
concerned about the situation there was a waste of time. 
I wanted to reach people who were indifferent, who didn’t 
know what was going on and didn’t care. It was only when 
I read Donald's book that I thought I had found a subject 
to which people in many parts of the world would find it 
possible to relate. 
Most important of all, of course, I wanted to reach an 
American audience because it was, I thought, in the United 
States that a fundamental change of attitude towards the 
administration of South Africa was likely to be most 
influential. 
A number of black people—not the majority by any 
means—believe that I dodged the issue and that by not tack- 
ling the subject purely from a black African’s point of view 
I smudged the edges. I don’t agree with that. 
I think it is a well made and wonderfully acted film. 
The script is immensely skilful, but it may be that my con- 
cern to reach a wider audience in fact resulted in a misjudge- 
ment. Whereas the picture will probably gross something 
like $45-50 million worldwide it will gross under $10 mil- 
lion in the United States. I believed that Americans would 
* Sir Richard Attenborough’s film Cry Freedom (1987) is based on the writ- 
ings of a white South African editor, Donald Woods, who befriended a lead- 
ing black activist, Steve Biko. Biko was arrested and died in police custody. 
When Woods attempted to get the truth about Biko's death told, he became 
a banned person and was forced to flee South Africa with his family. Editor 
go to see it and that black people in particular would be 
angry with what is going on in South Africa, I thought that 
the picture—even if it wasn’t as incisive as they might have 
hoped—nevertheless had its heart in the right place. 
It is fascinating that most black people in the United 
States did not go to the movie. It did worse business in 
Atlanta than it did in Los Angeles, although it did terrific 
business in Washington, which of course has a large black 
population, so I don’t really know whether I made a total 
miscalculation in assuming that there was an audience in 
America who would be interested in this kind of subject. 
There is no question whatsoever that the film actually 
affected the political debate in some countries and from all 
I can gather it was justified in that millions of people have 
been affected by it. But the fact remains that with hindsight 
I am enormously disappointed in attendances in the States. 
Cry Freedom was released at a time when a number of 
films were coming out about Africa, just as a number of 
films and TV films about India appeared around the time 
when you made your film Gandhi. How would you account 
for this interest in the Third World? Is the present crop of 
films about Africa a reflection of nostalgia for British 
colonialism or a desire to change apartheid? 
— It 1s very difficult to be certain. Suddenly an interest seems 
to arise in science fiction, in detective stories, nostalgia, 
historical subjects or love stories or whatever. 
As far as Gandhi is concerned there is no question what- 
soever that the film opened up Indian material for serious 
film-making, Gandhi was in the air for twenty years, and 
the studios consistently maintained that nobody was interest- 
ed in India. When I went to see the head of one major stu- 
dio I was told “Who on earth do you think is interested 
in a little brown man wearing a shirt and carrying a bean 
pole?” It was only because of the enormous attention that

### 83410: Interview with Richard Attenborough

This film—Gandbi— 
paved the way for an 
examination of 
imperialism, colonialism 
and other related subjects. 
Cinema people...began 
to realize that if they 
simply reflected what was 
available on TV then the 
cinema would die. 
  
the film attracted long before it came out that financiers be- 
gan to think that the subject might have some potential, This 
paved the way for an examination of imperialism, colonial 
ism and other related subjects. 
There is no doubt whatsoever that Indian independence 
after the Second World War helped set the scene for indepen- 
dence in Africa, the emergence of the African nations, and 
the weight of African opinion on the world stage. Because 
of this weight there is a worldwide interest in Africa which 
has nothing to do with cinema. 
I also think that with the advent of television, cinema 
has to some extent moved up a notch or two. The TV soap 
operas, detective stories and hospital series now supply the 
entertainment that is sought by vast numbers of people and 
was previously supplied by the cinema. I think cinema 
people—not the creative people who have always wanted 
to do this sort of thing but the financiers and the 
distributors—began to realize that if they attempted simply 
to reflect what was available on the television screen then 
the cinema would die. Cinema had to show something that 
was more exciting and stimulating than television. The pos- 
sibility opened up of larger scale movies in non-familiar set- 
tings. India was non-familiar, Africa was non-familiar. Sud- 
denly a number of people like myself who were interested 
in making that kind of film found the doors were easier to 
push open. 
Gandhi was such a success artistically and economical- 
ly that everybody assumed that a film made by the same 
person or company about Africa would be just as success- 
ful. If you saw the number of ideas for films about China 
which have arrived on my desk since the Italian director 
Bernardo Bertolucci’s Last Emperor of China then you'd real- 
ize how true it 1s that we in the cinema suppose that suc- 
cess will follow success. I don’t think one should look for 
any more social significance beyond that. 
Do you think there is any kind of link between this post- 
colonial nostalgia and the American experience as reflect- 
ed in the large number of American films about Viet Nam? 
— [think there is a hankering after the past. Even in India 
itself there is a wish to look back to the “good old days”, 
however appalling they were really. There is sufficient in- 
terest and sufficient of a potential audience to justify those 
movies being made. We want to discover how that era 
evolved and how the paternalistic attitude of colonialism 
manifested itself. But whereas I think there is a terrible sense 

## [Page 7](083412engo.pdf#page=7) 0

### IGNORE

of guilt in the United States in relation to Viet Nam in the 
minds of a vast number of people, I think the sense of guilt 
as far as empire and the UK are concerned is minimal. 
Is it cheaper to film in Africa than to film in Europe, say, 
or America? How important are the economics in film 
making? 
— They are undoubtedly very important. I want to make 
a film about Thomas Paine. So I go to a distributor, The 
distributor reads the screenplay and then he may say “Yes, 
this interests me”. He then goes to the heads of his market- 
ing and distribution divisions and says “How do you think 
a picture on this subject will do in Europe? Has it got any 
chance in Japan? Where do we stand with this on subsequent 
video?” He will then calculate that if the picture costs X 
dollars they have a chance of getting it back on the assump- 
tions made by the distribution people, which are of neces- 
sity conservative. The financial viability of a film is based 
on quite a small differential. A picture costing $15 million 
1s acceptable and a picture costing $19 million is not. The 
company has to hold down the budget to a figure which 
is viable. 
For a number of years the majority of movies made in 
Africa were shot in Kenya. Now if you go and talk to the 
budget people or the production people or the location 
managers they will say to you Kenya is tough because the 
prices you have to pay there are very stiff. And so if you 
are thinking of shooting in Africa you look for other coun- 
tries such as Botswana or Zimbabwe. The difficulty is that 
because of the tradition of film making in Kenya you've 
got a background of understanding of the problems involved. 
A degree of expertise has been built up. On Cry Freedom, 
which was filmed in Zimbabwe, if we had been able to find 


### 83410: Interview with Richard Attenborough

a sensational location manager who understood filming who 
was black and who lived in Zimbabwe we would have em- 
ployed him. He would have known ten times more and un- 
derstood ten times more what our requirements were than 
somebody from outside who knew nothing about Zim- 
babwe. But the difficulty is that you do not find 2 high lev- 
el of expertise, no one has had an opportunity to acquire 
the experience. 
I believe that the African continent is so exciting, so full 
of drama, so devastating in its imagery that there is no ques- 
tion whatsoever that if the African countries themselves are 
prepared to acknowledge that they have to make certain con- 
tributions, then the potential for building up indigenous 
African knowledge and experience of film making is there 
and viable. African countries that want to create an in- 
digenous movie industry should be discussing and trying to 
understand all the problems involved. The build-up has to 
come slowly and it has to come out of a strongly-felt desire 
to create that indigenous industry. If the question is removed 
into the political arena it will only scare off the financiers 
and create a counter-productive situation. 
On Cry Freedom we had two or three people who were 
passionate about movies but knew nothing at all about 
production. One of them, who became head prop man, I 
would have no hesitation in using in the same capacity on 
any picture that I might make in Zimbabwe in the future. 
In the meantime what happens to him? 
— He'll have to do something else. Few governments in the 
world have actually accepted the desirability of fostering 
cinema as the primary art form of the century. What is 
Africa facing? If you could get twenty minutes with Presi- 
dent Mugabe you could perhaps persuade him of the im- 
portance of creating a film school or making sure that a 
number of people came to a European school. But what is 
Mugabe doing? He's fighting for his country’s life. Film 
making has to come so far down on the list. And the heart- 
breaking thing is that whereas I believe that the potential 
really does exist to continue the work that has been begun 
with the movies that have been made there, I think my props 
man 1s in terrible trouble. I get a letter from him every two 
or three months asking whether [ know of a picture coming 
in. The terrible thing is that the situation has got to be turned 
round and it must no longer be a question of movies coming 
in from outside but of Africans fostering their own cinema 
in some way. But because of the problems of Africa, the 
difficulties and the existence of South Africa in its present 
form, the chances of this are very remote. They've estab- 
lished central film laboratories in Zimbabwe and I think 
many people there really see the potential of cinema. But 
I think one of the greatest problems facing this totally 
understandable desire to say “We are black Africa and we 
will make our own movies” is that there will not be a suffi- 
cient indigenous return from what is made. Somehow or 
other a number of movies will have to be made that can 
find specialist audiences around the world and bring returns 
of foreign currency. |

Street Scene at Five in 
the Afternoon (1887), by 
the French painter Louis 
Anguetin (1861-1932). 
HAT better way into the heart of a country could there be than the streets 
of its towns and cities? Here time-worn labyrinthine alleyways...there busy modern 
thoroughfares—streets endow cities with their personality, in some cases balanced 
and harmonious, in others overwhelming. 
In many parts of the world the urban environment is changing rapidly through 
pressures of industrialization, the influx of newcomers from rural areas, and the 
incursions of the automobile. Old streets are being torn apart and the memories 
of the past enshrined in them are fading. And yet the life of a city is rooted in its 
streets and neighbourhoods. Without this fabric etched with so many traces of the 
past, what would cities look like and what sort of places would they be? 
Many city-dwellers today are organizing themselves to defend their cities against 
the threat of dehumanization, and the widespread creation of neighbourhood defence 
committees has been a striking urban phenomenon of recent years. What can be 
done to encourage urban populations to identify more closely with their environment 
and to defend it more effectively? 
One answer to this question may be found in a Unesco-supported project entitled 
“Memories in a Street” in which seventy cities throughout the world took part three 
years ago. The project, which originated in an idea put forward by Robert Delpire, 
director of France’s National Photography Centre, was organized by the International 
Association of Art (IAA) and France’s National Academy of Street Arts. It began 
in Paris with displays in ten Metro stations which presented a pictorial history of 
the French capital. Cities taking part in the operation were invited to select century- 
old photos of their historic streets and display them on the spot where they had 
been taken so many years before. “Memories in a Street” evoked a wide response 
as citizens ransacked their family archives in search of old documents and photos, 
while their children combed avenues and alleyways photographing historic features 
that caught their eye. 
In Paris, Tokyo, Abidjan, Baghdad, Colombo and other great cities people thus got 
together to celebrate the life of their streets, past and present. For them perhaps 
the rediscovery of the street was a first step towards making their city a more human 
place to live in. 
The Editors wish to thank Mr. André Parinaud, Commissioner-General of the IAA at the time when the 
“Memories in a Street” operation was organized, for his help in the preparation of this issue.

### 83399: Berlin: the Friedrichstrasse, a link in the chain of history

Emam 'm 0c Friedrichstrasse, 
4 Balink in the chain 
of history 
  
BY CHRISTIANE MENGIN 
From the late 19th century Four kilometres in length and lying athwart 
until the end of World the boundary between the two parts of the city, 
War I, the Friedrichstrasse (he Friedrichstrasse sums up the history of Ber- 
bustled with activity. lin better than any of its other thoroughfares. The 
Friedrichstrasse is more representative than, for 
example, the Unter den Linden, the wide 
boulevard in the east where, during the eight- 
eenth century, Frederick the Great, thirsting for 
prestige, erected a number of monumental build- 
ings, or than the Kurfirstendamm, the “Champs- 
Elysées” of the western part of the city. 
Sleepy suburbs 
and unobtrusive houses 
At the beginning of the eighteenth century, 
Berlin was becoming more and more cramped 
within the straitjacket of its ramparts and a new 
district, Friedrichstadt, was constructed outside 
the city walls. Baroque in style, this outgrowth 
was traversed by three streets, the Wilhelmstrasse, 
the Friedrichstrasse, which formed the central 
axis, and the Lindenstrasse, leading southwards 
to the Rondell circus, inspired by the Piazza del 
Popolo in Rome. In the middle of the circus stood 
a column commemorating the battle of Water- 
loo which marked the south-eastern limit c{ the 
extension of the city. 
Until the late nineteenth century, Friedrich- 
stadt remained essentially a residential suburb 
with its rows of identical, unpretentious, two- 
storey, bourgeois houses. Here and there an ele- 
gant aristocratic property enlivened the aspect of 
this sleepy suburb. Nothing disturbed the calm 
of the Friedrichstrasse except the passage of 
hearses on their way to the out-of- town cemetery 
or the tramp of soldiers heading for the Rondell 
parade ground or the Tempelhofer Feld training 
ground to the south of the city. Barracks and sta- 
bles added the finishing touch to the somewhat 
martial aspect of the Friedrichstrasse. 
The arrival of a number of shopkeepers and 
craftsmen during the first half of the nineteenth 
century gave little indication of the frenetic

development that was to change the face of the 
Friedrichstrasse following the proclamation of 
William I of Prussia as Emperor of Germany in 
1871. When this period of frenzied growth and 
speculation began, the historic heart of Berlin and 
the Unter den Linden were bursting at the seams. 
Not a scrap of land was available for building, 
so it was in the Friedrichstadt district that the de- 
velopment occurred that was to transform the 
somewhat provincial chief city of Prussia into the 
capital of the Reich. 
The end of a golden age 
A vast construction programme turned the once 
peaceful Friedrichstrasse into a bustling main 
_ thoroughfare with heavy traffic and lined with 
serried ranks of fashionable shops, restaurants, 
cafés, nightclubs, theatres and a wide variety 
of hotels, business headquarters, banks, insurance 
companies and government offices. The “street 
of 107 cinemas” housed a host of studios and 
workshops of the youthful German motion 
picture industry, while newspapers and publishers 
established themselves in the nearby Kochstrasse. 
The golden age of the Friedrichstrasse lasted 
until the fall of the German Empire in 1918. Its 
long, narrow perspective, disappearing into the 
distance between the contrasting fagades of the 
three- to five-storey buildings that had replaced 
its original houses, has been immortalized in 
hundreds of photographs and illustrations. 
Passers-by, casual strollers, elegantly-dressed 
women and office clerks jostled each other on the 
narrow sidewalks beneath a profusion of multi- 
coloured signs. With its trams and old, horse- 
drawn buses, the Friedrichstrasse hummed with 
the feverish activity of an Empire launching 
itself into a tardy but breakneck process of 
industrialization. 
After the First World War, Germany was 
plunged by defeat into an economic slump that 
did not spare the Friedrichstrasse. Nevertheless, 
although building activity was considerably 
slowed down, this centre of Berlin life inspired 
several avant-garde architects to conceive some 
of their most daring projects. In 1921, on the oc-

Rohe designed a triangular-shaped glass tower 
which presaged the glass and steel buildings he 
was to erect in the United States twenty years 
later. Around 1930, the functionalist town- 
planner Ludwig Hilberseimer suggested that 
several blocks on either side of the Friedrich- 
strasse should be demolished and replaced by rec- 
tangular, eight-storey office blocks so as to make 
more rational use of space in the business centre. 
This visionary project was never realized, but it 
was no accident that it was to have been sited in 
this lively part of town. 
Although its role as the capital’s business and 
shopping centre continued, artistic and literary 
life became concentrated in the west of the city 
around the Kurfiirstendamm. However, a num- 
ber of the great names of the theatre remained 
faithful to the Friedrichstrasse. Max Reinhardt, 
in particular, continued to direct many produc- 
tions, at the theatre company which in 1954 be- 
came Bertolt Brecht’s Berliner Ensemble and at 
the Grosse Spielhaus, transformed in 1919 by the 
architect Hans Poelzig into an expressionist 
theatre. 
A city in ruins 
When Hitler came to power in 1933, the 
Friedrichstadt district was largely taken over by 
the Nazis. They occupied many old buildings in 
which they installed the government offices of 
the Third Reich. Albert Speer’s monumental plan 
for Berlin, whose fruition was prevented by the 
war, did not include the Friedrichstrasse. Only 
the planned redevelopment of Museum Island and 
its extension westward would have modified its 
appearance slightly. The proposed construction 
on either bank of the Spree River of four new 
museums would have involved, among other 
things, the demolition of the Admiralpalast (to- 
day the Metropol), a popular theatre devoted to 
operettas and musical comedies. 
In May 1945, after the battle of Berlin, the 
centre of the city was in ruins. 
When Berlin was divided up between the Al- 
lies, the Red Army, the first on the scene, oc- 
cupied the eastern part of the city. The dividing 
line followed the boundaries of the existing dis- 
tricts. Part of the old Friedrichstadt district, in- 
cluding three-quarters of the Friedrichstrasse, was 13

in the Soviet sector. The fourth quarter, to the 
south, was allotted to the American sector. 


### 83399: Berlin: the Friedrichstrasse, a link in the chain of history

In the hope of a reunification of the city, the 
local authorities in the west delayed reconstruct- 
ing the area under their control so as to be able 
to do so in collaboration with their counterparts 
in the east. At that time, the southern end of the 
Friedrichstrasse was a sea of mud from which 
arose the sinister shells of a few buildings that had 
escaped total destruction by bombing or in the 
fighting. 
In the east the authorities began to raze 
ruined buildings. The winters of the latter years 
of the war, when no heating was available, had 
seriously damaged the stucco-work and external 
ornamentation that had once been one of the 
street’s attractions. They were removed and the 
facades were coated with a beige rendering which 
fapidly weathered to a gloomy grey. 
The erection of the Berlin Wall, in 1961, set 
the seal on the division of the city into two parts. 
The Friedrichstrasse took on a new symbolic sig- 
nificance since it was the site of two crossing- 
points, the Friedrichstrasse underground station, 
which had become a railway station, to the north, 
and, to the south, the famous “Checkpoint 
Charlie”, a reinforced barrier set up in the mid- 
dle of the roadway and reserved for use by 
foreigners. 
From that time onwards, renovation of the 
Friedrichstrasse began in both east and west. 
Berlin's 750th anniversary 
In the west, the renovation programme began 
with the reconstruction of the Mehringplatz, the 
former Rondell. The Wilhelmstrasse and the Lin- 
denstrasse, which both led to it, were diverted 
and it became a pedestrian precinct whose cir- 
cularity was emphasized by the construction, be- 
tween 1968 and 1975, of two rings of massive 
buildings. 
After 1980, however, this policy gave way to 
an altogether different approach to urban reno- 
vation. An attempt was made to conserve build- 
ings that had survived and still bore witness to 
the past glories of the Friedrichstrasse. The origi- 
nal street pattern was retained and an effort was 
made to take into account the architecture of the 
earlier buildings. The aim was to restore this ur- 
ban area, so roughly treated by history, while 
keeping in mind the integrality of Berlin, evoked 
in 1987 by the city’s 750th anniversary. 
In the east, too, the reconstruction of the 
Friedrichstrasse went on apace. In the early 1980s, 
several buildings were under construction, among 
them a huge auditorium, the Friedrichstadtpalast, 
an international Trade Centre and several modern 
hotels, including the Metropol and the Unter den 
Linden. Other buildings still in the planning 
stage—apartment blocks, restaurants, cafés and a 
cinema—will all help to restore the former charm 
of the Friedrichstrasse. n

### 83400: Tokyo: a city of towers and traditions

   
   
 
A city 
of towers 
an 
traditions 
  
BY SARAH ZARMATI 
[x 1878, an Englishwoman named Isabella Bird 
toured Japan on foot, horseback and by sedan- 
chair. On her arrival at Shiganawa station (then 
one of Tokyo's two railway stations), she noticed 
that the houses, temples and public buildings 
were all low and in many cases enveloped in a 
profusion of greenery. In this great city, which 
already had more than 800,000 inhabitants, there 
was no sign of smoke nor of factory chimneys. 
When she saw the blue waters of the bay and the 
fishing smacks drawn up on the shore, she ex- 
claimed “Where is Tokyo?”.! 
Today Tokyo has over 10 million inhabitants 
and the only green spaces are to be found in a 
few parks, in temple precincts and around the Im- 
perial palace. Almost all its districts bristle with 
tower blocks, while industrial development and 
expressways have covered over the waterways, 
the beaches and most access roads to the bay, 
whose water is now grey. Nevertheless people 
still wonder “where is Tokyo?” and especially 
how to find their way around there. 
There seem to be two independent networks 
of streets in Tokyo. There are the functional and 
impersonal major arteries, with their imposing 
tower blocks, dense traffic and multicoloured 
neon signs. There is also a labyrinth of alleys and 
passages lined with low-roofed houses, narrow 
streets where the pedestrian still takes precedence 
over the motorist. The usual landmarks such as 15

major axes, vistas and monuments, that help vi- 
sitors to find their way around a city, either do 
not exist or are hard to find. Instead of joining 
the different parts of the city, many of the prin- 
cipal streets seem to separate and isolate them.

of a centre, although it bears only a very superfi- 
cial resemblance to that other great city without 
a centre, Los Angeles, whose linear development 
seems to have been determined by the railway 
and later by the automobile. In Tokyo, the major 
axes between districts were built after the earth- 
quake of 1923, when the city already had more 
than 3 million inhabitants. There is no focal point 
partly because Tokyo has developed through the 
gradual amalgamation of a number of villages, 
which have, unusually, survived intact in the 
heart of the modern city. 
At one 
with nature 
Except in the old cities of Nara and Kyoto, 
modelled on Changan in China, the geometric 
city layout has never been favoured in Japan. 
Japanese town planning seems to have been a 
response either to military needs, with impasses 
and mazy streets built as obstacles to invading 
forces, or to have been influenced by factors such 
as the natural features of the site, a wish to inte- 
grate with existing buildings and to meet the 
changing needs of the population. Whereas many 
Western cities have a linear plan which reflects 
the primacy of motor traffic, the pedestrian has 
always been paramount in Japanese town plan- 
ning. The primacy of nature can still be felt in 
Tokyo, where the few vistas are not aligned with 
monuments but with natural features such as 
Mount Fuji or Mount Tsukuba. 
The French scholar Augustin Berque has said 
of traditional Japanese town planning that “the 
logic of the streets adds to the impression of 
movement, of getting somewhere”, that “the 
journey is more important than the destination”, 
and that “this weakening of the transit function 
subordinates the street to the district which it ir- 
rigates.”? The neighbourhood is the basic unit in

Tokyo. The cultural and social life of the city can 
only be understood in terms of each neighbour- 
hood, especially its small traditional streets. 
Community spirit 
The streets of Tokyo, like those of other Asian 
cities, are crowded with market stalls, and daily 
life spills out of accommodation which is often 
cramped. Pot plants adorn the pavements and 
streets as well as windowsills, and casually-dressed 
local people can often be seen sitting outside chat- 
ting with their neighbours or taking the air on 
fine evenings. 
Many community events take place in the 
street. Each district organizes traditional festivals, 
called matsuri. In Europe, festivals often take 
place in public squares, whereas in Japanese ci- 
ties they tend to take the form of a procession. 
A festival begins in the temple. A procession then 
emerges from the sacred precincts and wends its 
way through the streets of the neighbourhood be- 
fore spreading out into spacious avenues. Big 
crowds take part in these festivals, and even on 
the main roads traffic slows down or stops while 
the procession goes by. 
The use of public areas for community ac- 
tivities takes other forms. In spring, garlands of 
plastic flowers are hung on telegraph poles and 
lamp standards to herald the flowering of cherry 
blossom and wisteria. Every day, ubiquitous loud- 
speakers announce the end of school and other 
events of general interest. Advance warnings of 
air pollution are also made by loudspeaker. Each 
neighbourhood also has its kooban (small police 
station) for maintaining order and providing 
visitors with information. 
As a result of growing concern about earth- 
quakes and fire, the city authorities are being led 
to sacrifice these little streets with their low 
wooden houses in favour of wide avenues with 
more fire- and quake-proof buildings. 
Is one of the most lively features of Tokyo's 
traditional way of life destined to disappear? ®

### 83401: Bogotá: a trip along the Séptima

A trip along 
the Septima 
  
BY ANNE BERTY 
Tic Carrera Séptima, more commonly 
referred to as the “Séptima”, Bogot4’s Seventh 
Avenue, is the Colombian capital’s busiest 
thoroughfare. In this one avenue are encapsulat- 
ed the personality, the history, the culture and 
the daily life of the city, which was founded in 
1537 by the Spaniard Gonzalo Jiménez de 
Quesada. 
This vast, thirty-kilometre-long axis, which 
links the richest residential area to the north with 
the poorest working-class district to the south, 
is also a huge barometer of the social and eco- 
nomic climate of a conurbation with a popula- 
tion of four and a half million, swollen by the 
urban explosion of the last forty years. 
From Bolivar Square to the old district 
of La Candelaria 
A thoroughfare like the Séptima is no place for 
the pedestrian and the traffic is so dense that 
casual strolling is discouraged. However, in the 
older districts of Bogota, the Santa Fé of coloni- 
al times, the Séptima still has a certain human 
dimension where it links Bolivar Square with the 
Candelaria district, whose carefully restored patri- 
cian houses recall the days of the viceroyalty of 
New Granada. 
Bolivar Square, or Plaza Mayor, remains the 
heart of Bogotd’s civic, political and religious life. 
The Capitol, the Town Hall, the Law Courts and 
the Cathedral, representing the four essential ele- 
ments of public life, each occupy one of the four 
sides of this huge square, whose stone buildings 
exemplify the austerity of "colonial town 
planning. 
Encompassing the styles of every epoch of its 
history, this architectural ensemble has witnessed ANNE BERTY,

regular, geometric layout, has been revitalized by 
intellectuals, artists and cultural organizations. 
From the outside, its manzanas (blocks), most of 
which are square and divided into long, uniform- 
ly rectangular solares (lots), reveal nothing of their 
interior spaciousness. The usually austere, anony- 
mous appearance of these blocks underlines the 
fundamentally inward-looking nature of the 
buildings of which they are composed. 
The few openings that the houses present to 
the street are hidden behind fine balconies of slat- 
ted wood or ornamental grilles. Thus domestic 
life is shielded, not only from outside eyes, but 
also from too open an outward-looking view 
which would reduce its intimacy. The life of the 
household is organized around a central patio, 
which is surrounded by arcades and galleries and 
is the focal point of all circulation within the 
house, as well as providing the rooms with some 
of their light. 
The decoration of the floors, the intricate 
woodwork of the galleries, the gardens enclosed 
with whitewashed cob walls and the presence of 
* plants and flowers throughout the house, create 
in the heart of the city a peaceful and harmoni- 
ous environment,

reaches out to the foothills of the Eastern Cor- 
dillera, the natural limit of the “Sabana (savan- 
na) de Bogotd”, the city’s grandiose site. The 
proximity of the mountains and the working-class 
district to the south lends a picturesque and some- 
what anachronistic air of animation to this area 
only a few blocks away from the presidential 
palace and some of the major cultural and touris- 
tic points of interest. Donkeys passing by laden 
with eucalyptus branches, bundles of wood, 
bunches of flowers, and other goods, are a 
reminder that Bogot4 has been swollen by the ex- 
odus from rural areas, and that thousands of 
former peasants are struggling to survive in the 
city. 
Chicha and agua de panela 
A host of small boutiques and craftsmen’s work- 
shops bring life to the Candelaria district. Much 
frequented, they relieve the solemnity of the 
colonial-style residences and keep alive old tradi- 
tions. A bar sign hanging in a patio is a reminder 
of the chicha (beer made from maize) stalls the 
aristocratic families used to keep on the ground 
floors of their houses in colonial times and in the 
early days of Independence. Further on is one of

the last aguadepanelaria, where a drink sweetened 
and coloured with “panela” (sugar-loaf made 
from raw sugar-cane) was served, as well as the 
famous santafererio chocolate. Everywhere there 
is a diversity of small businesses: tiny bookshops, 
antique shops, cabinet-makers, shoemakers, 
tailors and many other small artisans’ stalls. 
Returning to the Séptima and passing north- 
wards through Bolivar Square, the village at- 
mosphere gives way to the forms and symbols 
of a modern city—glass-clad towers and concrete 
skyscrapers. From one end of the avenue to the 
other, even on the same sidewalk, there is a strik- 
ing juxtaposition of the relics of a still recent past 
and the more aggressive indications of modernity. 
This itinerary, in keeping with the spirit of 
Bogota today, evokes a series of contradictory 
emotions. It includes a magnificent tower block 
in international style, a hamlet with Victorian 
overtones and a building cleverly drawing inspi- 
ration from the Bauhaus. One of the finest ex- 
amples of the new Colombian architecture, Park 
Towers, was built in Independence Park between 
1968 and 1972 by Rogelio Salmona. It 
subtly takes advantage of the light and verdure 
of the site, and echoes the majestic contours of 
the landscape. u 21

### 83402: Abidjan: a colourful kaleidoscope

22 
A colourful 
kaleidoscope 
  
BY PHILIPPE HAERINGER 
Li the continent itself, with its variety of cul- 
tures and climates, the streets of African cities are 
rich in contrasts. Some, in sandy areas, are lined 
with shrubs and trees—mango, avocado, palm and 
pawpaw—behind which huts with sloping roofs 
are concealed. In others the warm colours of 
lateritic soil blend with those of the straw and 
clay-daubed walls of flat-roofed houses facing 
onto inner courtyards. In yet others the houses 
are mainly in “carabotte” style (clapboard houses 
often built in English cottage fashion). Painted 
colonial white, they open out on to verandahs 
and lawns. And then there are streets lined with 
a succession of fagades, some high, some low, of 
often uncompleted cement houses, behind which 
are overcrowded tenement courtyards. 
The latter kind of street is typical of the port 
and capital city of Abidjan, Céte d'Ivoire (popu- 
lation between two and three million, one 
hundred times greater than fifty years ago), or at 
least of its working-class areas, in particular the 
“old” Treichville district (developed in 1930), 
Koumassi (1950) and the huge suburb of Abobo 
which mushroomed around 1970. The dwellings 
there are all the same—stereotyped, ugly and 
strictly functional. As a result of the land and ur- 
ban planning policies adopted, coupled with 
population growth and economic expansion, 
most of the inhabitants of Abidjan are tenants. 
All these houses and courtyards contain rented 
properties. 
A playground for all 
Against this somewhat bleak architectural back- 
ground, worsened by the eternal problem of road 
maintenance (though the authorities have made 
a major effort to improve the situation in recent 
years), the often rutted, muddy, dirty streets of 
Treichville, Koumassi and Abobo are, need it be 
said, overflowing with life and human warmth. 
In these streets which are usually nameless (at best 
they have a number), life is intense and firmly 
rooted in the present. 
It has become a commonplace to evoke the 
warmth and exuberance of the crowds which 
throng the market-places of Africa and the multi- 
coloured costumes of the women. It is perhaps 
less well known that the same animation reigns 
in the more remote, less frequented streets. There 
are no “dead” streets. 
Why is this so? First of all, it is due to the 
demographic pattern. The courtyards ace full of 
children for whom the street is an after-school 
playground. Secondly, it is due to the very na- 
ture of these rented, collective dwellings in which 
the living accommodation is little more than a 
series of cells. As a result, domestic life opens out 
on to the street and the neighbourhood. The 
street is the playground of both child and adult 
and the setting for quiet games of ludo, draughts 
or awelé between two, or full-scale neighbour- 
hood tournaments. Games like these make up an 
important part of the leisure-time activities of the 
inhabitants of Abidjan. In one street in Abobo 
there is a draughts school. In another there is a 
carpenter who specializes in making tables for 
bar-football, a game which has proliferated out- 
side bars in recent years and is also played in the 
entrances to some of the courtyards. 
Leisure activities such as these are for the 
men, but in the life of the street women are even 
more in evidence. Housewives, or young wom- 
en who cannot or do not want to leave home to 
work, set up in the street as peddlers of knick- 
knacks, fritters or grilled maize. Then there are 
the water-sellers. There are no longer any public 
water-fountains in Abidjan, but here and there 
are private watering points at which water can 
be bought. The spouts are high up so that women

customers can fill their recipients without hav- 
ing to take them off their heads. Nearby are the 
charcoal-sellers whose wares are in daily demand 
for cooking, which is always done on wood or 
charcoal. Also close at hand will be the “bou- 
tique”, a tiny shop which sells matches, soap, 
tomato purée and oil. For their supplies of vegeta- 
bles, fish and meat the women go each day to the 
local market. 
Calligraphy, trades and crafts 
In recent years Abidjan has experienced an ex- 
plosion of crafts, services and trades. The econom- 
ic crisis has accelerated the natural tendency 
towards diversification. Trades formerly concen- 
trated on the main thoroughfares are now tend- 
ing to spread throughout the city. Advertising for 
them has become more arresting. Calligraphers 
specializing in sign-writing and banner design are 
in great demand. The art of window-dressing has 
developed and new trades and new services are 
springing up and prospering. 
Dress-makers, for example, who formerly 
plied their trade in the market-places or from 
premises discreetly located in the depths of the 
courtyards, are now opening up in streets oc- 
cupied by ready-to-wear boutiques with attrac- 
tive shopfronts. Equally striking is the sudden 
proliferation of private telephone kiosks, often 
associated with such services as photocopying, ex- 
press typing facilities and the plastic covering of 
identity papers. They are to be found alongside 
small legal and tax advice bureaux and mini es- 
tate agencies, all of which were hitherto unknown 
outside the main thoroughfares. 
No less remarkable is the upsurge in the num- 
ber of private clinics and other health centres; 
even the healers are opening their own “clinics”. 
Similar innovations are occurring in education, 
where private enterprise is coming to the rescue 
of the public authorities. In the streets of Abobo, 
hoarding after hoarding proclaims the merits of 
kindergartens, primary and secondary schools, 
evening classes and workshops for apprentices. 
An immense variety of crafts are practised in 
African streets. In addition to repair men and 
“mamy-foutou” (women selling foutou, a dish of 
bananas or yams), you will find hairdressers and 
hair-braiders, photographers, tailors, shoemakers, 
watch “doctors”, mechanics, automobile electri- 
cians, coach-builders and welders, brick-makers, 
blacksmiths, plumbers, glaziers and cabinet- 
makers, key-cutters, fan specialists, and many 
more besides. : 
Beyond the street, the group 
The animation of the street largely compensates 
for the anonymity of the urban fabric. It creates 
a hierarchy of streets and gives them a soul. It 
creates more landmarks: a particularly striking 
sign may be popularly adopted as a street name, 
as in Aunt Solange Street or Symphony Bar

Street. But everything is in a state of constant flux. 
The people of Abidjan live in the present. What 
room can there be for nostalgia? 
It is true that in the old Treichville district 
some property owners look back with regret to 
the days when they first arrived. Similar feelings 
are sometimes expressed in Koumassi and Abobo, 
but they are far from being shared by the great 
majority of the present population. Only a few 
place names remain to evoke the early days, 
names such as Avocado-tree, The Other Side of 
the Tracks and Wireless (referring to a large tree, 
a railway line and a radio transmitter), or the 
name of the landowner or the village communi- 
ty which began the development (Ayébi, Agnis- 
sankoi, and so on). 
It is not easy for the city-dwellers to identify 
with such a new and uniform environment, in 
which accommodation is mainly rented by a mo- 
bile and rapidly increasing population. Yet, be- 
yond the still vital ethnic ties, new links are being 
established based on geographical proximity over 
a wider area than the immediate neighbourhood. 
The district, or even the arrondissement (today 
called the commune) is supplanting the street. 
The activities of groups or associations, whether 
they are concerned with sport, games, music, sav- 
ing or investment, professional life, religion or 
politics, are all mainly situated at this level. 
In this way local loyalties develop, with the 
inhabitants closing ranks against the threat of a 
sector clearance, even though this alone may not 
be enough to halt the bulldozers’ advance, or to 
demand the provision of amenities. But such in- 
itiatives never get very far. At one time the pub- 
lic authorities and international organizations 
hoped that the city-dwellers of Africa would 
themselves take a hand in the development and 
upkeep of the streets of their cities, but these 
hopes were swept away in the rising tide of ur- 
ban expansion. 
Thus road maintenance and other infrastruc- 
tures remain the responsibility of the authorities. 
Nevertheless these authorities can only view with 
satisfaction the remarkable vitality of the trades 
and crafts sector and the equally remarkable ca- 
pacity of the people of Abidjan, who come from 
all over western Africa, to breathe life into their 
city and live together in comparative harmony, 
despite their many differences. 
Muddy though they may be, the streets of 
Abidjan are well worth lingering in. |

### 83403: Moscow: Gorky Street, fifty years of change

Soviet capital has experienced over the past fifty 
years. As Tverskaya Street it was the main trad- 
ing link between Moscow and Tver, one of the 
oldest cities of Russia. Lined with luxury shops, 
their signs written in both French and Russian, 
it was at that time one of Moscow's liveliest 
thoroughfares. It was here that Muscovites had 
their first experience of traffic jams, and photo- 
graphs taken at the beginning of the century show 
among the bustle of horse-drawn vehicles and 
trams the first automobiles imported into Russia. 
Despite its commercial importance, Tver- 
skaya Street, like most Moscow streets, was nar- 
row and twisting. For although by the mid-1920s 
the city had a population of some two million 
inhabitants, it had more the air of an overgrown 
village than of the great capital it was to become. 
This large village was clearly ill-suited for its role 
as capital of the Soviet Union and, in the immed;- 
ate aftermath of the Revolution, a multitude of 
plans for its redevelopment were put forward, 
ranging from a first project, which would have 
made of Moscow a sort of Roman forum but 
which never got beyond the blueprint stage, to 
a plan dating from 1935, some provisions of 
which are still in force. The 1935 plan revolved 
around Tverskaya Street, by then renamed 
Gorky Street. 
A ‘model’ thoroughfare 
The objective of the 1935 plan, the Plan for the 
Reconstruction of Moscow, as it was called, was 
to make Moscow ‘a model communist city”. It 
put an end to the often stormy quarrels between 
those who favoured moderate urban decentrali- 
zation and the protagonists of total decentraliza- 
tion. It confirmed the concentric structure of 
Moscow—opposed by the modernists—and 
turned Gorky Street into a “model” thorough- 
fare. Execution of the plan was entrusted to the 
architect Arkady Mordvinov who, in the ideo-

more imposing structures in the new official style, 
a mixture of Italian Renaissance and Russian Im-

War II, Gorky Street looked much as it does to-

National Hotel housed the members of the Soviet 
Government and their families when Moscow be-

built some fifteen years ago a few metres from 
the old building, breaks the roofline established 
in the 1930s. During the pre-war years, militants 
and administrators of the Comintern occupied

Gorky Street is the work of Arkady Mordvinov 
and his collaborators. More than any other 
grouping of buildings in Moscow it epitomizes 
a bygone architectural era. With its colonnades 
and cornices inspired by the palaces of Leningrad 
and thence by Italian classicism and the Renais- 
sance, it represents the triumph of socialist real- 
ism in architecture. 
Yet the statues that crown these buildings are 
not the familiar deities of graeco-roman mythol- 
ogy. They are the heroes, real or imaginary, of 
the first Five-Year Plans. Workers, peasants and 
Red Army soldiers stand guard over Gorky 
Street, bearing witness to an age that strove to 
consummate the marriage of architectural forms 
and social objectives. [| 29

### 83404: Cairo: in the heart of an ancient capital

BY ALAIN BONNAMY In the heart 
of an ancient capital 
¢ 
Caro does not possess a single noble street, 
but a quantity of small ones that twist and turn. 
This clearly shows that all the houses were built 
at random, everyone building on the plot of land 
that pleased him, without asking himself whether 
he was blocking a street or not.” These remarks 
were made in 1657. How far do they apply to 
Cairo today? 
In the Cairo of the past there was no obliga- 
tion to respect the line of the street when build- 
ing. If a second house or site was acquired on the 
opposite side of the roadway, the two plots were 
simply joined up—expansion at the expense of the 
public thoroughfare. In this way many streets be- 
came blind alleys which served as courtyards 
where women gossiped, went about their domes- 
tic tasks, or supervised the games of their numer- 
ous offspring. At the entrance to the alleys, dogs 
bared their teeth at would-be intruders. 
A source of shade 
Other customs made the streets even narrower. 
Only a thin strip of sky could be seen between 
the balconies with their moucharabys* jutting out 
from windows on both sides of the street. 
Benches and platforms were permanently in- 
stalled in front of shops and cafés. Merchants and 
their wares even invaded the courtyards of 
mosques, clung to the facades of monuments or 
found a corner below the city walls. They took 
over the roadway, forcing passers-by to make 
long detours. 
Save in exceptional circumstances, the 
authorities were powerless to react against these 
practices. On one occasion, the Fatimid caliph 
al-Hakim had a large chandelier made and want- 
ed to have it delivered to the Amr mosque. To 
make room for its passage, the obstacles which 
encumbered the streets had to be demolished, 
some roadways dug up, and facades and balco- 
nies knocked down. The same thing happened 
in 1813, when the pasha’s daughter got married. 
Two days before the ceremony, police officers 
inspected the streets through which the wedding 
procession was to pass and ordered buildings 
which would hinder the procession to be pulled 
down. The narrowness of the streets could only 
be justified by the shade they provided but, far 
* A wooden latticework screen around a window which permits the 
person behind it to see into the street without being seen. Editor 
from being the chief reason for it, the shade was 
often no more than a happy consequence of the 
liberties taken with the streets. 
From alleys to avenues 
Today there are still two main categories of street 
in Cairo—open and covered. There are many 
kinds of open streets. A zukak is a blind alley; 
an atfa or khanka is an alley without an entrance 
gate and without shops, leading into a busier 
street, often by steps or through a gateway. 
A darb or bara is a local street closed by a 
gate. It contains shops but is not more than two 
or three metres wide. A stkka was originally a 
palm-lined way, or a village street, but later the 
word was used to indicate a main street. The 
terms qasaba, tarik and shari are reserved for par- 
ticularly lively, rather spacious avenues where 
people assemble to discuss business and engage 
in trade. The word gasaba has come to mean a 
metropolis or capital. 
There are also the akaba, a climbing street; 
the hadar, a descending street; the djisr, a road- 
way raised above the level of floodwaters; and the 
suk, a street where shops or workshops specializ- 
ing in a specific product or service are found. 
Proud of their pharaonic past, Egyptians 
turned their backs on the thousand years of ar- 
chitecture which preceded their opening to Eu- 
rope after Bonaparte’s expedition. Until recently, 
the authorities were not much interested in 
preserving this urban architectural heritage. Since 
the nineteenth century, Egyptian town planners 
have always been inspired by a desire for moder- 
nity, and took as their models the Paris of Hauss- 
mann and, later, cities of the United States. 
Contrary to what happens in some Europe- 
an countries, in Cairo the use of buildings has not 
changed over the centuries. Not a single palace, 
madrasah or mosque has become a town hall, 
ministry, embassy or theatre. Many have decayed 
beyond repair, but they are beginning to attract 
renewed interest, and an archaeological depart- 
ment has been entrusted with their maintenance. 
Palaces and mosques may have been reprieved, 
but not more modest buildings, although it is 
they which constitute the spatial texture of a 
street. 
What is the state of this ancient urban fabric" 
today? A survey carried out over twenty years 
ago showed that 6 per cent of the old city was 31

in a satisfactory condition, 12.5 per cent in a mid- 
dling condition, 36.5 per.cent less than satisfac- 
tory, and 45 per cent in a very bad state. The 


### 83404: Cairo: in the heart of an ancient capital

situation has not improved since then. Three- 
quarters of Cairo’s pre-nineteenth-century build- 
ings have now deteriorated beyond repair. 
Modernizers and pasticheurs 
There are two schools of thought on how to 
remedy this situation. The majority, anxious to 
rationalize and modernize the old city, favours 
the systematic alignment of streets, with cross- 
roads to facilitate the circulation of traffic. A few 
mosques and palaces would be preserved like 
pieces of sculpture in a glass case, but within this 
framework property developers would be given 
a free hand. 
Others, whom I would call the *“historian- 
pasticheurs”, regard the entire 400 hectares of the 
old part of the city as a conservation area. They 
would respect the existing fabric, restore what can 
still be restored and, undaunted by the hazards 
and constraints of pastiche, reconstruct what has 
disappeared. 
This solution has two disadvantages. The old 
city is too closely packed and could not be opened 
up sufficiently. Moreover, the project would take 
too long and would be too costly and nearly all 
the local people of modest or average income 
would be driven out. 
So, what can be done to revitalize the heart 
of the city, which has become run down and 
overcrowded and is underequipped to meet the 
many needs of its inhabitants? In my opinion, it 
must be restructured and renovated in depth, 
despite all the inconvenience that implies for the 
people living there. The shopkeepers, certain

craftsmen, property-owners and others who use 
the area are the most likely to accept these dis- 
ruptions. Opening up this sector would reinte- 
grate it into the city centre, and there would 
certainly be a big increase in the price of build- 
ing land. : 
However, so far as know, no urban renew-

al of this kind, wherever it has taken place and 
under whatever kind of political régime, has yet 
succeeded in keeping the poorer members of the 
population in an old town centre, however regret- 
table and immoral this may appear to be.

and enjoy life. This quality of life is a result of 
the gregariousness and conviviality of the Cai- 
renes. But it also owes much to the layout of the 
streets. The frequent breaks in their alignment 
create spaces in between the flow of people in 
street, courtyard, stairway and building, Any new 
town planning project will have to preserve this 
interstitial fabric, this symbiosis between open 
and enclosed spaces. 
Between complete order and utter chaos, a 
certain degree of urban disorder must be 
preserved. But how? By means of a geometrical 
pattern that respects the complexity of the spa- 
tial organization. It would be grafted onto the ur- 
ban tissue which is to be preserved, making the 
most of the existing space, and would harmonize 
new needs with living social customs and prac- 
tices. In this way, perhaps, the old heart of Cairo 
would beat again. |

Heron is a city in trompe l'oeil. It has 
at least four downtown areas organized around 
ultra-modern tower blocks, and then, as far as the 
eye can see, covering nearly 650 square 
kilometres, stretches a medley of districts rang- 
ing from the smart to the run-down. 
These districtsare linked by highways rather 
than streets, for the streets of Houston are un- 
like those of many other cities. Even Milam Street 
or Louisiana Street, in downtown Houston, are 
not quite ‘‘streets”. Houston is a city of 
boulevards and avenues.

### 83405: Houston: highways in the city

Chevrolets and pickups cruise along freeways 
leading into the city, where they become multi- 
lane thoroughfares with flower-covered embank- 
ments, link roads or bypasses. Houston's streets 
are a vast maze of diversions, interchanges and 
junctions through which an endless flow of traffic 
is channelled in and out of the city. 
Vertical addresses 
These enigmatic, paradoxical streets make it 
difficult to know where you are. They are enig- 
matic because they do not provide any bearings. 
In downtown Houston addresses are vertical. 
You go from one skyscraper to another, from Al- 
lied Bank Plaza to the Milam Building or the 
Republic Bank. You find your way around not 
by looking for street names, but for skyscrapers. 
INSET PREVIOUS PAGE 
 
Allen Parkway and Allen 
Center, in the heart of 
downtown Houston. 
The roads simply provide access to glass and steel 
tower blocks whose great height symbolizes the 
power of the companies whose headquarters they 
are. The interest of a street is defined only by the 
beauty of the building that soars above it. The 
street has no existence of its own. 
If you happen to get lost, you will look in 
vain for someone to put you right. No one seems 
to be around. Mystified, the new-comer wonders 
where everyone can be. As a pedestrian you feel 
vaguely out of place because you are alone. Apart 
from a few patient souls waiting interminably for 
a bus to take them out to the suburbs, the only 
animation is that provided by passing traffic. And 
sometimes—during the lull between the peak 
periods at the beginning and end of office 
hours—there is not even any traffic. Tower block, 
avenue, car park. Tower block, avenue, car park. 
And so on. Even the department stores close at 
lunch-time for lack of custom. 
An air-conditioned city 
The American myth of the highway has carried 
all before it in Houston, a city shaped by and for 
the automobile. Even the splendid monoliths 
created by the architects of prosperity seem to 
pay tribute to the concept of a city planned for 
the automobile, a vertical city built in response 
to the ups and downs of the cotton and oil in- 
dustries. Houston’s latest jewel, the Transco 
Tower, has been planned as a freeway sculpture, 
to be seen from all sides. 
For Houston’s white-collar workers, under- 
ground galleries replace streets as they are known 
in New York, San Francisco or in the cities of 
Europe. Here, because of the torrid heat, people 
travel from air-conditioned houses in air- 
conditioned cars to air-conditioned offices which 
they reach through air-conditioned corridors 
beneath the skyscrapers. Street life does exist, as 
in every other city, but it goes on in the shop- 
ping galleries located in these corridors, with their 
boutiques, restaurants and news-stands. 
In this city, which has no real centre, the 
streets seem to be works of the imagination, 
traced at random. While the controlled environ- 
ment underground has taken over the life of the 
city, what remains of nature is left to the streets 
outside. It is a science-fiction all-steel nature, 
where the plaintive cries of a marsh bird sudden- 
ly pipe out from a roadside tree, one of the few to 
have been spared by the flow of concrete. R 
Beneath the city’s 
downtown area is a tunnel 
system with shops and 
restaurants, providing air- 
conditioned access to major 
buildings.

### 83406: Beijing: the street of the glazed tile factory

The street 
of the glazed tile 
factory 
  
BY PIERRE CLEMENT 
Vistrors to Beijing stroll through broad 
avenues where it is hard to keep a sense of direc- 
tion. They look in vain for the animation of small 
shopping streets. Following first a horizontal then 
a vertical line, like the cursor in an electronic 
game, they go from north to south and east to 
west, unable to escape the grid pattern and the 
obstacles it creates to taking short cuts. Every- 
where there are walls, the walls of the Forbid- 
den City and its surrounding districts, house walls 
and the screen walls inside gateways.* 
The modern town planner has shattered this 
geometrical dream. Even broader avenues have 
been traced, so many of them that Beijing is now 
enclosed in five concentric circles of ring roads. 
And the old horizontal city, with its closely 
woven tissue of houses, its inner void of housing 
compounds and their courtyards, is now being 
replaced by a vast building site of tower blocks 
in which it is impossible to discern any kind of 
urban order. 
An image of power 
Beijing is above all a city that reflects power. This 
was already the case in the thirteenth century un- 
der the Yuan or Mongol dynasty, which adopt- 
ed the square model of the ancient Zhou capital. 
* The brick screen walls, or yingbi, located inside the entrance gate 
to housing compounds, were seen as a protection against evil spirits 
and prevented curious passers-by from looking inside. Editor

It remained so under the Ming (fourteenth-

fifteenth century when they brought back their 
capital from Nanjing (Nanking) in the south to

The town planners of northern China always

as the Tatar City) at the southern end of Tianan-

late nineteenth-century commercial architecture. 
Liulichang Street, to the west, was a testimo- 
ny to artistic life under the Qing dynasty in the 
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, until recent- 
ly when it became the site of a reconstruction 
operation that is original to say the least. 
Liulichangjie, or the street of the glazed tile 
factory, derives its name from an Imperial facto- 
ry established there at the beginning of the Ming 
dynasty to provide the many materials—bricks, 
glazed tiles, roof and window decorations— 
required to build the Imperial palace when the 
capital was transferred to Beijing. This establish- 
ment was demolished at the end of the Qing dy- 
nasty, but in the meantime the district had 
attracted booksellers, printers, vendors of paper, 
brushes, ink, ink stones, seals and other equip- 
ment used by scholars, sellers of calligraphies and 
paintings, bookbinders and antique dealers. The 
district became a meeting-place for artists, scho- 
lars and foreigners, who crowded into its almost 
200 shops. 
A showpiece for tourists 
Like the rest of traditional Beijing, the district 
around Liulichang Street comprised low, 
wooden-framed houses with grey brick walls and 
tiled roofs of the same colour, opening onto in- 
ner courtyards surrounded by carved panelling. 
Of course, the district had become very dilapi- 
dated, but rather than renovate the old frame- 
work, it was decided to raze the old buildings and 
reconstitute them using modern materials and 
traditional techniques, combining a desire for the 
new with a concern for archaeology. 
The project, which was carried out jointly by 
Beijing Municipal Council, which owned the 
land, and the Ministry of Culture, got under way 
in 1978. The first phase of the operations provid- 
ed for the reconstruction of fifty-four art and an-

tique shops. Only one house built in 1920 and 
one nineteenth-century house with a courtyard 
located behind a large calligraphy shop, were 
spared by the demolishers. 
Continuity of style 
The West has learned to respect old stone, 
original materials and authenticity of style. In the 
Far East, however, whether in Japan, Korea or 
China, prestigious buildings made of perishable 
materials have always been periodically recon- 
structed. While new materials were used, old tech- 
niques continued to be practised, and the original 
forms were reproduced. The permanence of the 
model took precedence over the use of authen- 
tic materials. 
In the case of Liulichang Street, the architects 
used the results of historical research to help them 
design buildings of the late Qing dynasty. They 
made extensive use of concrete for pillars, beams 
and other structural elements, but the concrete 
was concealed by a rich decoration of bricks, tiles, 
carved wood, paintings, lacquerwork and gilding, 
All the specialists in the region were mobilized 
to help with the project. The reconstitution is 
painstaking and ornate, and if the decoration is 
still rather garish, the brightness of the fresh paint 
will be mellowed by the patina of time. This 
first phase of the project cost some twenty mil- 
lion yuan, a sum whose magnitude shows the im- 
portance attached to the operation by the Chinese 
authorities. 
The fifty-four shops of the new Liulichang 
Street, renamed the Street of Culture, today ply 
their trade in souvenirs, crafts, antiques, antiquar- 
ian books, paper, brushes and paintings. The 
reconstitution applied only to the outer skin of 
the district, which was removed by the bulldoz- 
ers. The depth, substance and authenticity of the 
area and the conditions under which it developed, 
were all ignored. Bruised and battered, the street 
is losing the memory of its past, and its former 
spirit has gone. This is why Shen Zhanxiang, a 
- Chinese town planner, has suggested that the ex- 
periment should be regarded as a historical mis- 
take never to be repeated. 
Will his warning be heeded? In the meantime 
similar projects have been started in other cities. 
A street in Xi'an has been “recreated” in the style 
of the T’ang emperors (seventh-tenth century). 
Similar reconstructions in the old style have also 
been effected in Kaifeng and Tianjin. The move- 
ment is spreading elsewhere. In Paris, at the con- 
fluence of the Seine and the Marne, the idea of 
building a Chinese city on similar lines is already 
being aired. n

### 83407: Under the roofs of Paris

Under the roofs 
of Paris 
S OME Paris streets, such as Rue du Renard (Fox 1 — 
Street) and Rue du Chat-qui-Péche (Street of the BY ANNE-MARIE 
Fishing Cat), have names that recall the once- A 
famous signs that used to hang in them. Others CHATELET 
have rural names, like the Rue du Chemin-Vert 
(Green Lane) which at one time meandered be- 
tween vegetable gardens, or the Rue des Belles- 
Feuilles (Fairleaf Street) of which glimpses could 
be had over the wall surrounding an old property. 
Yet others evoke crafts and trades, such as the 
Rue de la Lingerie (Linen-Drapers Street) and the 
Rue du Rouet (Spinning-Wheel Street), or life in 
the old days: people crossed the Seine on the fer- A typical Paris roofscape.

end of the Rue de la Croix-Nivert (Street of the 
Cross of Nivert), at the Croix Rouge (Red Cross) 
crossroads and in the Rue Croix-des-Petits- 
Champs (Street of the Cross of Littlefields). 
Many Paris streets are named after prominent 
personalities. Landowners often gave their names 
to streets that crossed their land. Rue Beaufils and 
Rue Baudelique are typical examples. Local 
authorities paid tribute to those who had ren- 
dered service to the community by naming streets 
after them. The former commune of Vaugirard, 
for example, named Rue Fondary after one of its 
mayors. A person’s fame was often sufficient rea- 
son for a street to be named after him. Three ar- 
chitects are thus honoured in Rue 
Théodore-Ballu, Rue Auguste-Perret and Rue 
Mallet-Stevens. 
The latter, a little street in the 16th Arron- 
dissement designed by the great French architect 
Robert Mallet-Stevens, is very modern in style. 
Completed in 1927, it consists of five villas and 
a caretaker’s house. Today the existence of this 
architectural masterpiece is threatened by the en- 
croachments of speculators.

Lef, Rue Mallet-Stevens, 
in the 16th 
Arrondissement of Paris, 
was designed by the French 
architect for whom it is 
named. Far left, the 
classical lines of Rue de 
Rivoli. 
A corner of old Paris, Rue 
Frédéric Sauton. In

cathedral, 
During the nineteenth century, Rambuteau 
and Haussmann, who were successively Prefects 
of the Seine Département from 1833 to 1870, gave 
Paris the appearance that it has today. They 
rebuilt the network of main thoroughfares, car- 
rying through, in fifty years, the most ambitious 
road-planning project in the history of the capital. 
A number of routes were opened up to the 
outskirts of the city in areas then still little deve- 
loped. New precincts sprang up, like the Europe 
district planned in 1826 and then gradually built 
up on the site of the old Tivoli gardens. Six roads, 
each named after a capital city—the Rues de Con- 
stantinople, de Madrid, de Vienne, de Londres, 
ed by the Boulevard de Sébastopol and the 
Boulevard Saint-Michel, the same kind of 
nineteenth-century-style buildings are to be 
found. These roads, however, are but gashes in 
the living urban flesh behind. A stroll round the 
labyrinth of narrow streets behind the Place 
Saint-Michel, where the Rues de la Harpe, de la 
Huchette and du Chat-qui-Péche intertwine, 
reveals buildings of another age, with bulging 
walls, narrow facades and windows that on each 
storey are smaller than on the one below. 
What should we look for in this maze of 
streets? The ones reputed to be the longest or the 
widest? Those that have survived the hand of 
Haussmann or those that bear witness to his 
work? Those whose rich outlines were the work 
of a single architect or those that offer a mosaic 
of styles? Those whose cobbles we walk with 
familiar tread or those to which we go with the 
reverent step of pilgrims? 
The poet Raymond Queneau gives an answer 
in these lines: 
There are streets that are tubes 
There are streets that are arches 
There are boulevards dowdy 
And others all crowdy 
With cars, vans and coaches 
There are squares dodecagonal 
Some simply infernal 
There are sausage-shaped avenues 
Where the beetles are ravenous 
Canals quite Venetian 
And islands West Frisian 
Bridges and alleys and dead-ends and quays 
Highways and courtyards and footpaths, all 
these 
For a multiple, motley mosaic of modes 
You cannot beat Paris’s system of roads... ®

investigate and record the daily life of at least one 
representative family in every country of the world, 
and to publish the results of her enquiries in a

After carrying out research into the social and 
economic conditions in each country, Ms. Tremblay 
consults academics and social workers who help her 
select a family with which to live. She then takes 
part in the family’s daily life, observing and 
listening to its members as they talk about their 
problems and aspirations. In the resulting book she 
describes a typical day in the family’s life. In the 
article below Ms. Tremblay presents some reflections 
inspired by her experiences on her ‘Families of the

### 83408: Families of the world

common to all humankind, and sharing this 
experience among other families all over the world 
is the most powerful force for international 
understanding among “ordinary” people that I have 
ever witnessed. 
There is a particularly urgent need to strengthen 
international communication about the family today 
when it is feeling the impact of the hurricane of 
change that is sweeping through the world. 
Everywhere I have found that families are 
wondering where the forces of change are taking 
them and whether these forces will bring them 
better lives. 
In the Americas, the Caribbean, East and 
Southeast Asia and the Pacific, I have seen some of 
the harsh realities millions of families on our planet 
face every day. I have accompanied women and 
children on the long daily trek to fetch drinking 
water which is not always safe. I have lived with 
peasant families who were unable to keep up the 
payments on the debt they owed to the local 
middleman, and wondered when they would have 
to take the road to the city slum. At the other end 
of that road I have shared the pitiful but generous 
shelter of proud people reduced to the ultimate loss 
of dignity caused by rampant disease and chronic 
unemployment. 
When I visit a country I ask the people I meet 
to tell me about their beliefs and traditions. 
Invariably someone exclaims, “Oh, grandmother 
used to do this or think that, but it is not so 
anymore.” And everywhere grandmothers say with 
regret, “Things are not as they used to be.” 
Young people are impatient to master every 
piece of information that comes their way. The old 
feel sad and powerless when they see the young turn 
their backs on traditional culture. In between these 
two groups there is a generation of people in their 
late thirties and early forties who act as a buffer and 
try to ensure that young and old live happily side 
by side and communicate with each other. 
Satisfying both groups, however, does not 
demand the same responses. The old want the 
pattern of their daily lives to be unchanged. They 
want to feel that their beliefs are shared. To keep 
them happy new ideas must often be filtered and 
their impact softened. Meanwhile, the deepest 
concern of the world’s parents is how to satisfy the 
young. 
In the developing countries these forces are far 
more manifest than in the industrial countries, but 
families have less resources to cope with them. To 
satisfy the aspirations of today’s young people, the 
buffer generation must find more and more cash. 
The first priority, I have found everywhere, is 
education, including school clothes, equipment and 
transport. Young people are also pushing their 
parents out of the subsistence economy in a process 
which may start in an apparently trivial way, with 
a desire for jeans and T-shirts with a slogan, the 
universal uniform of youth. Young people are also 
hungry for the new universal music and for the 
foreign products that transnational advertising,

### 83408: Families of the world

television and video offer as daily temptations. They 
become dissatisfied with the stillness of village life 
and the attraction of the city starts to break the spell 
of the extended community. 
In this way such families are being propelled into 
a materialistic society. As they leave the tranquil 
shore for the turbulence of a fast-moving river, they 
wonder whether they will be carried along to crash- 
ing waterfalls or to calm waters. Neither sociolo- 
gists nor economists seem able to answer this 
question of universal concern. 
For millions of people living in societies that 
have known a regular, predictable, unchanging way 
of life for centuries, today Is a time of tumult. They 
feel with alarm that their lives are spiralling out of 
the control of their community and coming under 
the influence of a new, international “paramount 
chief”, who ts motivated by cash and materialism 
rather than by spirit and soul. 
Meanwhile, as societies and individuals try to 
understand what is happening, the daily round con- 
tinues. Children must be fed, roofs must be repaired 
before the rainy season, and water must be fetched. 
Gardens and fields must be planted, weeded and har- 
vested, rents paid, debts met. And whatever may 
be happening to the old cultures and values, every 
man and woman who wakes up to start a new day 
shares with unknown millions elsewhere in the 
world the same desire to live through it in dignity 
and faith. How much stronger they would feel in 
face of the new doubts, if they knew they shared 
this desire! 
For at a time when the people of the world are 
coming to know that they share the planet with mil- 
lions of others, I find that most people feel lonely, 
thinking that their own worries are the worst. 
I take to each family I visit pictures of the fa- 
milies whose lives I have shared in other countries 
and continents. Wherever I go I am struck by peo- 
ple’s eagerness to know how others live. They are 
always interested to see the similarities between their 
dwellings and those of others, and to discover how 
people in different economic and geographical cir- 
cumstances find different ways of solving the 
problems of everyday life and realizing the same 
universal aspirations. 
In every home I have found that in almost every 
field of change, from family planning to health, from 
new divisions of labour in the home to new 
economic enterprise in the community, women are 
taking the initiative. Everywhere I have been amazed 
by the work of women’s organizations in unleashing 
the full potential of women within the family. 
As family size is getting smaller and parents are 
realizing that their financial investment in secondary 
education should be given to the most eager of their 
children, more and more girls have an opportunity 
to study. The women argue, rightly, that whereas 
men prefer the social and economic challenge of 
urban life, many educated women return to their 
communities as nurses, social workers and educators. 
The example of these educated women devoting 
their lives to the improvement of their people’s 
conditions is giving other women the confidence to 
determine their own destinies and those of their 
families. 
Everywhere relationships within the family are 
being exposed to new stresses and tensions by 
international communications, especially messages 
such as the Western concept of “love” which reach 
young people by TV and video. In Southeast Asia 
and the Pacific most parents I visited had been 
brought together in arranged marriages, but they 
all said that they would let their children choose 
their partners. The new relationship between these 
partners and’ their families will change the 
individuals involved and their society. 
Where these changes are concerned, there are 
striking contrasts between rural and urban families. 
Rural families cannot live in isolation from the 
community and from those members of the 
extended family who live within reach. Only 
through mutual support, help and generosity can 
they cope with the forces of nature, poverty, and 
lack of understanding from the urban communities 
which they feed. 
In the cities, however, behaviour patterns which 
were once simply inherited from other members of 
the extended family are now increasingly being 
modelled on those of people from completely 
different backgrounds and are thus much more 
unpredictable. Limited space and the proximity of 
neighbours who are not part of the clan also incite 
urban families to keep to themselves, lead people 
to behave aggressively in defence of their interests, 
and often end in the severance of family ties and 
a descent into loneliness. The urban individual and 
the rural family vie with each other in the national 
community, with governments increasingly called 
on to play 2 mediating role. 
In this new and unstable situation, many would 
prefer the pace of change to slow down. Not only 
family specialists but also the United Nations system 
must help nations and families to understand the 
forces of change. Surely families beset with doubts 
in the face of change would gain insight and courage 
if they knew that the same problems are faced by 
all those with whom they share the planet. 1

SCIENCE AND SOCIETY 
  
  


### 83409: International co-operation in space

International co-operation In space 
BY DAVID SPURGEON 
Canadian scientific journalist based in Ottawa 
Ten years ago, US astronaut Neil 
Armstrong became the first human to 
set foot on the Moon. His arrival there 
was heralded in the West as the win- 
ning of what was popularly called “the 
space race”, 
In those early days of the space age 
we used to hear a lot about the “space 
race”. Competition between the two 
giant space-faring nations, the Soviet 
Union and the United States, was 
the order of the day. Teday that is 
changing. The new watchword is co- 
operation. Competition certainly still 
exists between the great space powers, 
but international co-operation is now 
the vogue. 
Today, instead of talking about rac- 
ing back to the Moon or on to Mars, 
the Soviets and the Americans are at 
least thinking about the possibility of 
going there together. 
The joint statement after the Soviet- 
US Summit in 1988 noted that the two 
countries “agreed to expand exchanges 
of space science data and of scientists... 
They noted scientific missions to the 
Moon and Mars as areas of possible 
bilateral and international c¢o- 
operation”. 
Other kinds of collaboration in 
space are already well underway. The 
recent ill-fated Phobos probes of the 
Soviet Union, destined for the moons 
of Mars, for example, were Soviet-built 
and launched, but they carried instru- 
ments and employed scientists from 
Austria, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, the 
Federal Republic of Germany, the Ger- 
man Democratic Republic, Finland, 
France, Hungary, Ireland, Poland, Swit- 
zerland and Sweden. And the USA 
provided radio tracking. Similarly, cos- 
monauts from twelve countries (Bulgar- 
ia, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, France, the 
German Democratic Republic, Hungary, 
India, Mongolia, Poland, Romania, Syria, 
and Viet Nam) have flown on Soviet 
spacecraft. 
The major current US manned 
space priority—the Space Station 
Freedom—is a co-operative venture be- 
tween that country and Canada, Europe 
and Japan. The Space Station will pro- 
vide a permanent manned research 
laboratory and spacecraft servicing and 
repair facility in space. It will also func- 
tion as a transportation depot from 
which spacecraft can depart to distant 
parts of the solar system. 
Although the United States is the 
project director and senior partner, the 
US National Aeronautics and Space Ad- 
ministration (NASA) calls the Space Sta- 
tion a “genuine partnership” which 
involves “friends with common in- 
terests”. The Eurcpeans and Japanese 
are each providing a habitable module, 
while Canada is building a Mobile Ser- 
vicing System. 
Other space-faring nations are co- 
operating not only with the Big Two, 
but among themselves. Canada has 
partnerships with France, the Federal 
Republic of Germany, Japan, Sweden, 
the United Kingdom and the USSR. 
Japan has co-operated with the USA in 
projects other than the Space Station, 
and with the European Space Agency, 
and intends to conduct research joint- 
ly with Malaysia and Thailand using data 
from Japan's Marine Observation Satel- 
lite, MOS-1. 
Countries that have conducted 
space activities now include, besides 
those mentioned above, the Arab 
States, Australia, Brazil, China, India and 
Indonesia. Most of these, too, have 
been collaborative ventures. 
The USSR has been particularly ac- 
tive in trying to promote international 
space agencies. In June 1988, for the 
third year in succession, Soviet delegates 
at the United Nations sponsored the 
idea of a World Space Organization. 
Connected with the United Nations, the 
WSO would concentrate its efforts on 
peaceful space exploration and preven- 
tion of extension of the arms race to 
space. It would develop such projects 
as the use of space platforms to moni- 
tor global change and, later, manned - 
interplanetary missions. 
The most comprehensive collabora- 
tive space activity of all will be the 
celebration in 1992 of International 
Space Year (ISY). In April 1988, NASA 
hosted a meeting at the University of 
New Hampshire to which it invited 
representatives of twenty-three space 
agencies around the world. The agen- 
cies formed an organization—Space 
Agency Forum for the International 
Space Year (SAFISY)—to meet regular- 
ly to co-ordinate ISY activities, particu- 
larly those associated with studying the 
Earth. Such activities—the use of space 
observations and complementary 
ground-based studies to better under- 
stand our planet—will be a feature of 
the 15Y. 
One of these activities will be an ef- 
fort to search among existing data on 
the Earth to try to determine whether 
there are unequivocal signs that human 
activity has been responsible for warm- 
ing of our planet Earth. A US project 
planned to study another global change 
is the Upper Atmospheric Research 
Satellite, scheduled for launch in 1991. 
It will measure processes in the upper 
atmosphere that control the loss of 
ozone. 
Topex/Poseidon, a joint US-French 
project to measure with great accura- 
cy the depth of the oceans, is scheduled 
for launch in 1992. This will help scien- 
tists learn more about global ocean cir- 
culation. It is to be coupled with 
Scatterometer, a device to be flown on 
a Japanese satellite in the mid-1990s, 
which will measure wind stress on the 
ocean surface. Together, Topex/ 
Poseidon and Scatterometer will help us 
understand the coupling between the 
oceans and the atmosphere. 
Finally, to study how the at- 
mosphere and the Earth interact as an 
integrated system, a platform will be 
placed in polar orbit by the US Space 
Station, carrying a comprehensive set 
of equipment called the Earth Observ- 
ing System. This will be complement- 
ed by another platform provided by the 
European Space Agency and still 
another from the Japanese. 
Platforms in polar orbit can see the 
entire Earth rotating under them. In 
time, geostationary platforms (which re- 
main stationary in orbit with respect to 
a position on Earth) will be added to fo- 
cus instruments on a single region on 
the Earth's surface. Together, they will 
provide comprehensive, long-term 
measurements of such factors as the 
Earth's vegetation, cloud and snow 
cover, ocean currents, and even the 
production of the simple plants 
(phytoplankton) that are the food 
source of marine animal life, 
All these studies will be com- 
plemented by satellite and ground- 
based studies from around the world— 
particularly through the International 
Geosphere-Biosphere Programme of 
the International Council of Scientific 
Unions (ICSU). 
THE SOVIET SPACE 
PROGRAMME 
In recent years, the Soviet “space 
programme has been far more active 
than the US programme. The American 
newsmagazine Time said in its cover 
story on 5 October 1987: “In sheer 
numbers of launches per year, the 
Soviets inched past the US in 1967, 66 
to 58, and have stayed in front since." 
Since then, Soviet cosmonauts have 
set the long-term space flight record, 
two of them—Vladimir Titov and Musa 
Manrov—staying there for a full year. 
And in 1988, along with the first, un- 
manned, launching of their Buran re- 
usable spaceship, the Soviets conducted 
89 other space missions—compared to 
26 by the rest of the world combined. 
Major successes were also scored 
with Soviet unmanned missions to Ve- 
nus and Comet Halley: the Vega Project 
had broad international participation— 
six socialist and three market-economy 
countries and several international 
scientific organizations. The Vega 
probes soft-landed on Venus to deter- 
mine the composition of the surface,

and balloon probes radioed back data 
on the planet's atmosphere. 
Later, the Vegas entered the enve- 
lope of Halley's comet to obtain the first 
large-scale images of the comet's 
nucleus, from a distance of 8,000-9,000 
kilometres. Later again, the West Euro- 
pean spacecraft Giotto, and two 
Japanese - spacecraft, Suisei and 
Sakigake, joined in, with Giotto pass- 
ing even closer to the nucleus—520 to 
550 kilometres from it. 
US MISSIONS 
TO VENUS AND JUPITER 
After the Space Shuttle Challenger 
disaster in January 1986, the US 
programme began to pick up momen- 
turn again. Its first interplanetary probe 
in a decade was launched on 4 May 
1989. That spacecraft, Magellan, is due 
to visit Venus to map the surface, in- 
cluding its land forms and geological 
features, using radar. its findings are ex- 
pected to help answer fundamental 
questions about the origin and evolu- 
tion of the planet, which can then be 
compared with that of Earth. 
Also this year, the Galileo mission 
is scheduled to set off on a six-year 
voyage, never before attempted, to 
Jupiter and its satellites. It will parachute 
a probe that will make measurements

of the chemical composition of Jupiter's 
atmosphere and of those of its satellites. 
Galileo will also make measurements of 
the Jovian magnetosphere. 
The US programme has other 
major scientific missions scheduled for 
the near future. These include two of 
what are known as the Great Observa- 
tories: the Hubble Space Telescope and 
the Gamma Ray Observatory. Both are 
scheduled for launch early in 1990. 
The Hubble telescope will carry 
both an optical telescope and ultravio- 
let instruments. It will investigate the na- 
ture of processes occurring in stars and 
galaxies, study the history and evolution 
of the universe, and confirm the univer- 
sality of physical laws. The Gamma Ray 
Observatory will study objects that emit 
gamma rays and investigate such 
phenomena as neutron stars and black 
holes. 
Also scheduled for 1990 launch by 
the USA are the Cosmic Background Ex- 
plorer and the Roentgen Satellite. The 
Cosmic Background Explorer is designed 
. to measure the remnants of cosmic 
microwave radiation believed to date 
from the explosive event (the Big Bang) 
that some theorists say created the 
universe, and will thus have implications 
for our understanding of its origin and 
fate. The Roentgen Satellite will study 
X-ray emission from stars and galaxies. 
OBJECTIVE MARS 
The first part of a project named Ves- 
ta, which the Soviet Union, France and 
the European Space Agency are jointly 
planning, is also tentatively scheduled 
for the beginning ‘of the 1990s. Vesta, 
a follow-up of Vega, will make a 
detailed study of several asteroids and 
a comet. Which ones will depend on the 
time of launch. 
By far the biggest goal for the 
Soviets is Mars, first for unmanned ex- 
ploration, and later for manned flight. 
One version of such a mission has been 
described by Novosti Press Agency's 
scientific analyst, Oleg Borisov. 
The first stage is planned for 
1994-1996, using the rocket Energiva 
to loft sophisticated equipment to the 
surface, including rovers, drilling units 
and balloons for atmospheric studies. 
The next mission would come be- 
tween 2000 and 2005, with a lander 
bringing back samples of Martian soil 
for analysis. If the first two phases were 
successful, the first manned flight would 
take place between 2005 and 2010. 
Borisov reported: “Soviet research- 
ers, pioneers of this mission, call for an 
international effort, for participation of 
some European countries and the US”. 
At least one Soviet writer, Vladis- 
lav Shevchenko, a physicist and 
mathematician, has repeatedly publi- 
cized the advantages of a manned lu- 
nar base. Last year, through Novosti 
Press Agency, he led his article with the 
declaration: “It is probable that the 
Soviet Union and the United States will 
co-operate in exploring Mars and the 
Moon", 
Last April, according to the US pub- 
lication Aerospace Daily, NASA's Ad- 
ministrator, James C. Fletcher, said that 
a US-USSR manned mission to the 
Moon was more attractive in the near- 
term than a similar voyage to Mars. 
Whatever is decided about such 
eventual missions, it seems certain we 
can look forward to more internation- 
al co-operation in space—and as a result 
more detailed knowledge of the 
universe. [|
