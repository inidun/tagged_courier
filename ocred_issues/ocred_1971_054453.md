1. the classic civilizations 
of ancient Greece and Rome creative 
thought and work were recognized 
and appreciated. Outstanding monu- 
ments and works of art were visited 
then just as tourists today include 
famous sites and monuments in their 
itinerary. 
Of the hundreds which existed, 
seven were considered to be outstand- 
ing and called the “Seven Wonders 
of the World". Of these a few traces 
have survived to the present, but the 
fame of those which have disappeared 
still lingers. 
Today, more than seven would be 
recognized throughout the world, and 
surely within that limited group would 
be found Angkor Wat. The news that 
it had been damaged made headlines 
in the world press and aroused de- 
mands that it should be protected from 
further Injury. 
Angkor Wat Is but one of many sites 
and monuments surrounding the Tonlé 
Sap, the great natural flood reservoir 
of the lower Mekong and its tributa- 
ries, in the Khmer Republic. Annual 
monsoon rains result in a great expan- 
sion of the lake, and as it recedes in 
the dry season fertile silt is deposited 
and the land becomes ready for the 
cultivation of rice and other crops. 
Fish abound and contribute protein to 
the diet. Even today 2,000 square miles 
of farm land are flooded annually. 
This easily exploited wealth was 
the foundation for the growth of an 
urban civilization, and major empires 
rose and fell, to be succeeded by 
others. Each left traces of its exist- 
ence. Ancient cities, temples and 
palaces (some still buried under dense 
tropical vegetation), bear mute witness 
to former glories of the Khmer people. 
Bas-reliefs carved on walls of stone 
depict a triumphant procession, cap- 
tives taken in war, the pomp and cere- 
mony of royal courts. Statues of Siva, 
Vishnu and other deities of the Hindu 
pantheon, and of Bodhisattvas, or 
future Buddhas, record the images of 
long dead kings, queens, princes and 
dignitaries apotheosized as gods. 
Frequently the sculptors succeeded

graphy. 
“in merging man with god”, in giving 
their creations a transcendent quality 
which contemporary visitors respond 
to though they may be ignorant of 
Khmer history and of the religious and 
cultural traditions from which these 
monuments were created. Of all the 
complex of monuments known collect- 
ively as Angkor, the masterwork is 
Angkor Wat. It was built in the 12th 
century AD. during the lifetime of 
King Suryavarman Il and eventually 
became his mortuary temple. 
French archaeologists, historians 
and architects have worked for years 
in Cambodia (today the Khmer Repu- 
blic). Part of the legacy of the Ecole 
Francaise d'Extréme-Orient rests in 
the monuments which have been exca- 
vated, studied and restored. Khmers 
have also been trained and now staff 
the national and provincial. museums 
and services responsible for the pro- 
tection of sites and monuments. 
Several thousand sites have been 
identified and thousands have still 
to be discovered. 
M... remains to be done; 
before the recent outbreak of con- 
flict, Unesco sent an architect-restorer 
to begin work on a group of sites 
150 kilometres east of Angkor, which 
ranged in time from the seventh cen- 
tury to about the end of the thirteenth. 
Other experts were sent to assess 
the expenditure required for the deve- 
lopment of such sites. 
Cultural tourism was already an 
important factor in the economy of the 
country. Siem Reap now has a modern 
airport which can receive jets, and new 
hotels have been built or were under 
construction in 1970. The develop- 
ment of sites away from Angkor would 
have encouraged visitors to stay 
longer in the country and the resultant 
increase in income would have helped 
to justify the budget required for 
research and restoration. The outbreak 
of armed conflict has, of course, put 
all of these plans in abeyance. 
This is not the first time that Angkor 
has been menaced by armed conflict. 
A period of unrest followed the death 
of Suryavarman lI, the weakened king- 
dom fell to the Chams and Angkor 
was pillaged in 1177. Successive 
kings restored Khmer rule. New 
by Hiroshi Daifuku 
construction and changes to the old 
took place, enriching the monumental 
heritage of the Khmer people. 
Once again the threat of armed 
conflict menaces not only the people 
but their past heritage. Nowhere else 
is there greater anxiety about the pre- 
servation of Angkor. Whatever the 
cause of recent damage, the Govern- 
ment, recognizing the need for effect- 
ive measures to ensure Angkor's pre- 
servation, has suggested that a neutral 
zone be established surrounding the 
monuments so that further damage 
will not occur as a result of military 
operations. 
This move to protect Angkor is but 
one attempt in the long and turbulent 
history of man to preserve links with 
the past so that people may share a 
common history and tradition. The 
loss of such identification and conti- 
nuity could lead to the eventual disap- 
pearance of an entire people. 
This factor was recognized from 
very early times. Conquerors or 
would-be conquerors, in order to 
assure their posterity and the pride of 
future generations, have built monu- 
ments or destroyed those of their 
enemies. Rome, for example, adopted 
Cato’s slogan “Delenda est Carthago” 
(Carthage must be destroyed) after the 
second Punic War. 
The third Punic War, provoked by 
the Romans, resulted in the sack of the 
city. The site was dedicated to the 
infernal gods, no stone left standing, 
and all habitation in the ruined area 
forbidden. Carthage, as a city, even- 
tually rose again, but it was no longer 
Punic. The survivors had been absorb- 
ed and their identity had gone forever. 
(See “Unesco Courier”, December 
1970). 
During World War 11, for example, 
after an uprising by the inhabitants of 
Warsaw had been repressed, Hitler 
ordered the complete evacuation of 
the city, The ancient royal castle, the 
old medieval section (the central 
market place known as the “Stare 
Miasto”), palaces and churches were 
destroyed, and much of the rest of the 
city was dynamited and gutted by fire. 
The decision taken by the people of 
Poland to restore most of the monu- 
ments of Warsaw, including the “Stare 
Miasto”, expressed their desire to re- 
create the fabric of the city and main- 
tain the continuity of Polish history. 
(See "Unesco Courier”, March 1961.)

### 188338: S.O.S Angkor

  
The lessons learned from World 
War Il eventually led to the preparation 
by Unesco of an “International Con- 
vention on the Protection of Cultural 
Property in the Event of Armed Con- 
flict which was adopted at The 
Hague in 1954. As In all examples of 
legislation it represents a compromise 
between the ideal and the adoption of 
rules which the majority of States who 
took part in its preparation believe that 
forces engaged in armed combat could 
be expected to ohserve. 
The Hague Convention (1954) is now 
in force and over fifty States have 
ratified it, including the Khmer Repu- 
blic. One of the provisions (Article 23) 
states that Unesco can be called upon 
for technical assistance in organizing 
the protection of cultural property. 
At the request of the Khmer Govern- 
ment, Unesco sent an expert to help 
negotiate a cease fire to protect Ang- 
kor and permit the transfer of movable 
bronzes and sculptures to Phnom Penh 
for shelter. Later, additional experts 
were sent to aid and advise In the 
packing, transport and storage of 
these works of art, and the most 
valuable items are now’ adequately 
protected In the National Museum in 
Phnom Penh. 
But whereas the Khmer Government 
has ratified the Convention the other 
belligerents have not. One solution 
would be the negotiation of special 
agreements so that the provisions of 
the Hague Convention can be applied. 
Should this be done, centres contain- 
ing monuments of great importance 
could be placed under special protec- 
tion (Article 11). It would represent a 
triumph demonstrating the goodwill of 
all concerned. 
The threat of destruction by armed 
conflict is immediate and dramatic. 
But in heavily populated centres, the 
pressures of population growth and 
short-sighted projects for economic 
development have resulted in far great- 
er destruction to man's cultural heri- 
tage than that caused by either of the 
two World Wars and the many smaller 
conflicts of the past 50 years. 
This too is a challenge to be met 
by the present generation in order that 
future generations shall not be depriv- 
ed of cultural links with the past nor 
live in an environment polluted through 
man's excesses, whether against the 
atmosphere, rivers, lakes and seas or 
the cultural heritage of our planet. W

This general view shows the site of Angkor 
(meaning “city”) in its present forest setting. 
Capital of the Khmer empire from the 9th 
to the 13th century, the city covered an 
area of 600 square kilometres and boasted 
600 temples. Some 100 of these temples 
have been cleared of vegetation and 
the most important ones are identified on 
the plan above. The prosperity of Angkor 
was dependent upon the construction a 
by the Khmers of a fantastic irrigation 
system to support the production of rice. 
During the rainy season, water was stored 
in artificial lakes, or “barays”, and a network 
of canals provided irrigation for an area 
of 1,000 square kilometres, thus providing | 
the food supply for a population which, 
at its height, numbered one million. 
The greyish-white areas surrounding the 
temples or seen as rectangles are 
| 
canal-works, basins and lakes forming 
by Henri Stierlin 
part of the extensive Khmer irrigation system.

Angkor. This site in Cambodia, the 
capital of the Khmer kingdom from 
the 9th to the 14th century, provides a 
perfect example of the way in which 
a civilization equipped itself with the 
means of producing an ample food 
supply without which a vigorous 
culture could never have flourished in 
the hostile setting of virgin forest and 
the Indo-Chinese jungle. 
This article briefly describes the 
main influences which shaped the 
Angkorian civilization and its match- 
less architecture, recently thrown into 
high relief by the tragic events in 
South-East Asia. 
The Angkor site forms a vast net- 
work of dozens of temples and satel- 
lite cities, equipped with the water 
supplies required for agriculture and 
for the day-to-day needs of the Khmer 
population. Thus Angkor strikes a 
miraculous balance between land and 
water, men and gods; from the fusion 
Drawing by Tanguy de Rémur © Paris-Match 
of these four elements emerged one 
of the greatest civilizations in medieval 
Asia. 
Even before the beginning of the 
Christian era, the fruits of India’s 
advanced civilization, especially in the 
spheres of religion and art, had begun 
to spread beyond its frontiers. Ceylon 
was the first of its neighbours to be 
subjected to the Buddhist influence, 
as early as the 3rd century B.C. 
Burma, Indo-China, lava and Bali 
were not impregnated by the creative 
genius of India until the early cent- 
uries of the Christian era. The trade in 
exotic products between the Far East 
and the Roman Empire was the chief 
vehicle for the dissemination of the 
Buddhist and Hindu creeds throughout 
south-east Asia. The links then forged 
between India and the Far East 
endured in some instances centuries 
after the trading relations had ceased. 
There was some sort of division into 
spheres of influence between India

### 54455: Angkor, masterpiece of architecture and town-planning

MASTERPIECE OF TOWN-PLANNING (Continued) 
Delicate balance between ecology and aesthetics 
and China in this part of the world; 
hence the name of Indo-China acquir- 
ed by the peninsula watered by 
three great rivers: the Menam and 
the Mekong, where Indian-influenced 
cultures flourished; and the Red River, 
which watered the provinces gravi- 
tating in China's orbit. 
The first architecture in durable 
materials clearly shows the Indian 
influence; but a capital named Oc-Eo 
is known to have existed even earlier 
on the Bassac Delta in the lower 
Mekong valley. In the 3rd century 
AD. it was enclosed in a rectangle 
3,000 metres long by 1,500 metres 
wide, formed by a series of five earth- 
works separated by moats. The 
shrines in this region, known to the 
Chinese of that time as “Fu-nan”, 
seem to have been built of light mat- 
erial (wood and thatch), and no trace 
of them remains. 
Among the earliest monuments of 
which we have certain knowledge are 
the sanctuaries of Sambor Prei Kuk 
in Cambodia, a town which seems to 
have covered an area 2 kilometres 
square, Construction in this capi- 
tal of the early 7th century, which 
dominated the unified Tchen-la empire, 
was on an impressive scale: the brick 
sanctuaries, standing in vast square 
enclosures, had high roofs with jutting 
arches; their soaring silhouettes were

obtained by superposed storeys of 
diminishing size, forming a sequence 
of small temples, on a principle which 
recurs in all Khmer architecture. 
During the 8th century, when Tchen- 
la had split into two kingdoms whose 
history remains obscure, there seems 
to have been little artistic develop- 
ment. Javanese raiders invaded Malay- 
sia and Indo-China; and the Javanese 
influence was to play its part in 
shaping the course of Angkorian civi- 
lization. 
The full flowering of Khmer archi- 
tecture was preceded by an “incu- 
bation period” in the Kulens, 50 kilo- 
metres north-east of the Great Lake 
of Cambodia, where the capital of the 
kingdom was then transferred. It was 
as if the royal house foresaw that the 
destiny of the Khmers was to be 
played out in the heart of the country, 
and no longer in the southern delta, 
as at Oc-Eo, or to the east of the 
Great Lake, as at Sambor. 
In this period, between 800 and 
850 A.D., were laid the foundations of 
the art form which first emerged at 
Roluos in the Angkor region. At Rong 
Chen, in the Kulens, the first temple- 
mountain was built; its conception is 
typical of all Khmer architecture. It 
marries the two main architectural 
features inherited from India through 
the Javanese incursions; the stupa (an 
artificial mound around which Bud- 
dhists walk in ritual procession, and 
of which Borobudur is the most perfect 
example) and the Hindu shrine of 
superposed storeys, derived from 
Indian models at Mahaballipuram, for 
example, through the Javanese temples 
of Dieng or Prambanam. 
Thus, the temple-mountain is a stupa 
crowned by a square shrine, with a 
roof formed of vertically superposed 
storeys, symbolizing the City of the 
Gods built on the Mount Meru of 
Hindu legend. 
The Ak Yum temple erected north- 
west of Angkor just before the Sth 
century was a second attempt at the 
same effect. [t seems to have been 
built by the Khmer King Jayavarman II, 
who lived for many years at the Court 
of the Sailendras of Java, and was 
responsible for establishing the royal 
city once and for all in the Angkor 
area. 
The specific Khmer technique really 
came into its own, however, with the 
foundation of Roluos by King Indra- 
varman (877-889) in the south-east 
quarter of Angkor. For the first time, 
the Indo-Chinese did more than merely 
dig channels to make the fullest use 
of the monsoon rains; they undertook 
a vast development scheme to improve 
the yield of rice, which formed the 
staple food throughout the whole of

south-east Asia. This was the source 
of wealth to which the vast Angkorian 
complexes owed their construction. 
Indravarman realized that to break 
the immutable monsoon cycle, with 
torrential rain for four months in the 
year, and not a drop falling for the 
following eight months, there was only 
one solution: to store the surplus 
water for redistribution in time of 
shortage. 
It was thus possible to use the 
Angkorian plain to the best advantage; 
with abundant irrigation all the year 
round, it could bear as many as three 
rice crops a year. To this end, 
Indravarman initiated vast hydraulic 
engineering works, and created huge 
artificial lakes or barays. These 
formed reservoirs for the accumulation 
of the water needed to irrigate the 
rice fields.

This vast frieze with its 
hunting scenes and life-size

mahouts, all in high relief,

on either side of the stairway

moat. At the end of the

the stairway, stand the 
triple-headed elephants of 
the goddess Indra, gathering 
lotus blossoms with their trunks. 
east Angkor, the earliest known exam- 
ple, formed a rectangular sheet of 
water 3,000 metres long and 800 me- 
tres wide. Dykes were used to 
construct this artificial lake, thus 
ensuring a permanent head of water— 
the water level was higher than the 
plain. 
It was merely necessary to open 
trenches in the dykes for the water 
to run out at the required rate for 
regular irrigation of the rice fields. 
The baray, filled by a feeder canal and 
by the monsoon rains, with a storage 
capacity of 6 million cubic metres, 
was to be the source and basis of the 
wealth of the Khmer Kingdom. 
The succeeding kings followed up 
this hydrological development by 
creating the great Eastern Baray, meas- 
uring 7,000 by 1,800 metres, built by 
Yasovarman about 900 A.D., then the 
Western Baray measuring 8,000 by 
  
2,200 metres, which was constructed 
about 1050 A.D., with a storage capa- 
city of more than 40 million cubic 
metres. 
This vigorous technological improve- 
ment of the Angkorian plain inevi- 
tably entailed a profound modification 
of the landscape. The hydraulic sys- 
tem moulded the countryside, which 
was furrowed by countless irrigation 
channels and sub-divided by the 
checkerboard of the rice fields. 
The Khmers had thus worked out 
their specific system of area develop- 
ment, and the plain of Angkor was to 
produce 150,000 metric tons of rice a 
year from a stretch of nearly 1,000 sq. 
km. This was enough to feed a popu- 
lation which, in the 12th century, can 
be estimated at 700,000 or 800,000 in 
the Angkor region alone, with a pro- 
duction surplus of about 40 per cent 
for export to less prosperous regions

MASTERPIECE OF TOWN-PLANNING (Continued) 
Water conservation: key to the Khmer equation 
which had no similar “rice factory” to 
draw upon. 
This artificial environment, comple- 
tely dominated and largely moulded by 
man, was reflected in the ground plan 
of the towns, with their strictly right- 
angled lines framing the temple placed 
at the very heart of the city. Every 
part of the Khmer world was inter- 
connected, from the embankment 
bordering the Cambodian peasant’s 
rice field to the three-walled temple 
whose moats were linked to the 
irrigation system. 
This is illustrated by the city of 
Roluos, the first great dynamic capital 
in the Angkor region. Indravarman was 
not content with constructing the Lolei 
baray; in 881 he built the temple- 
mountain of Bakong, which stood in 
the centre of the city then called 
Hariharalaya. 
The temple is formed of five super- 
posed sandstone terraces or plat- 
forms, almost square, measuring 67 
by 65 metres at the base, and form- 
ing a monumental pedestal 15 metres 
high for the principal shrine. 
The fourth storey of the temple was 
ringed by twelve “chapels”, and eight 
massive brick towers (prasats) stood 
watch around the pyramid, within 
a precinct measuring 160 by 120 
metres, surrounded by a moat 
60 metres wide and about 1,500 metres 
round. 
The dwelling-houses, made of thatch 
or matting, and raised on piles to 
protect them from the monsoon rains, 
bordered this first moat, and were in 
turn encompassed by a second moat 
22 metres wide. The city formed a 
quadrilateral 800 metres long, with a 
population of some 7,000 to 8,000. 
Four axial avenues crossed the moats 
on earthen causeways to converge on 
the central temple, thus dividing the 
city into four equal parts. 
The Khmer complex was thus com- 
plete: a baray supplied water to the 
moats in the town, with the temple- 
mountain or royal sanctuary at its 
heart. The whole constituted an inter- 
acting technological and religio- 
magical mechanism which ensured the 
prosperity of an agrarian society based 
on intensive rice cultivation. 
That is the key to the Khmer equa- 
tion; and even when the proportions 
of the Roluos enterprise were magni- 
fied 4 or 5 times, in Angkor, in the 
walled cities of Yasodharapura and 
later at Angkor Thom, the system 
remained the same. The architecture 
was only an embellishment of the func- 
tional hydraulic works installed for 
irrigation. 
The temple protected and sanctified 
the technological achievement through 
the image of the deity inhabiting the 
inner shrine. The Khmer temple, 
whether dedicated to the Hindu divi- 
nities of Siva, Vishnu or Brahma, or 
(when the world of Angkor had nearly 
run its course} to the Buddha-King, 
represented the centre of creation, the 
Mount Meru which was the home of 
the gods (as Olympus was the haunt 
of the divinities in the Greek Pan- 
theon). 
The square plan of the temple, with 
its geometrical divisions, constituted 
an immense mandala (a mystic sym- 
bolic diagram of Indian origin), includ- 
ing the temple (which was thus 
brought into harmony with the laws of 
the Cosmos), the royal! capital inhab- 
ited by humans (which was thus iden- 
tified with the centre of the universe), 
and the vast expanse of the plain 
(which was thus dedicated to the 
gods). The whole panorama was quar- 
tered by the four axial avenues running 
from the sanctuary in each direction to 
be lost to sight in the perspective of 
the Khmer landscape. 
This all-round symmetry of construc- 
tion along the axial roads is a fun- 
damental law of temple composition 
in the architecture of Indian-influenced 
countries; but only the Khmers suc- 
ceeded in impressing that symmetry 
on the sacred edifice, on the human 
city and on the surrounding country- 
side. : 
This total vision of mystic symbol- 
ism and its religio-magical power, 
associated with the practical function 
of the barays and the irrigation sys- 
tem, is the hallmark of the Khmer 
genius. From this astonishing talent 
for synthesis, embracing all aspects 
of human creation, emerged the admi- 
rable apotheosis of Angkor Wat. 
One of the factors responsible for 
the individual character of Khmer art, 
which differentiates it from its Indian 
sources, derives from the popular 
architecture typical of ancient Cam- 
bodia, especially the wooden dwellings 
built on piles and topped by gabled 
roofs covered with thatch. This domes- 
tic style probably dates back to pre- 
historic times, and is hardly distin- 
guishable from pre-Indian neolithic 
building. 
The popular art represented on 
Khmer bas-reliefs (at Angkor Wat and 
Bayon, in particular) inspired some 
typical forms of Angkorian architecture. 
Its influence can be detected in many 
instances of translation into stone of 
features borrowed from what were 
originally wooden structures. 
One example is the moulded window 
balustrades, reproducing in sandstone 
the rounded lattice gratings of hut 
dwellings; others are the cross-gabled 
roofs, imitating the carpenter's tech- 
nique in stone; the colonnettes border- 
ing some raised walks, reminiscent of 
the traditional gangways leading to pri- 
mitive dwellings beside the Great 
Lake: the mortise effect at the apex 
of doors and windows, and so on. 
All these traits are characteristic of

Khmer art, and in no way derived

architecture drew Its inspiration both 
from native and from Indian sources. 
A rich symbolism already infused 
Indravarman’s achievement at Roluos 
(the temple-mountain of Bakong); but 
there followed a steady development 
in architectural science which became 
more complex while also gaining in 
uniformity and quality. Thus, the long 
structures bordering the Bakong sanc-

This photograph is quite extraordinary in more than one sense. What appears to be a simple wall with several figures 
on it is in reality a tele-photo picture in foreshortened perspective of a 30 metre stretch of several planes of 
the great gallery of Angkor Wat. This gallery forms the vestibule of the temple, the biggest and best preserved 
of the temples of Angkor, which was built by King Suryavarman Il in preparation for his eventual apotheosis. The figures 
with diadems and long skirts, bare-breasted in the ancient Khmer tradition, are minor divinities, known as “apsara” 
or “devata”, destined, according to Buddhist mythology, to gladden the hearts of the Gods and the blessed ones. 
which led (in the temples of Phimeana- 
kas and Takeo) to the emergence of 
the encircling gallery, that essential 
element of classical Khmer architec- 
ture. 
The long buildings were run toge- 
ther, the outer wall of the gallery thus 
formed was finally placed at the edge 
of each storey, the axial entrances 
(the Hindu gopura) and corner towers 
were integrated in the composition. 
The various concentric platforms sym- 
bolize the mountain ranges surround- 
ing the human universe, encompass- 
ed in turn by the primordial ocean, 
here represented by the wide moat 
skirting the city. 
Meanwhile, there was appreciable 
technological progress: as a result of 
the general adoption of masonry for 
temple architecture, the sanctuaries 
built of brick and hewn stone, to pro- 
vide the eternal gods with imperishable 
materials, were soon topped by roofs 
where wooden timbers and tiles were 
replaced by corbelled vaulting built 
of sandstone. 
Lastly, the classical period paid spe- 
cial attention to the perfection of orna- 
mental detail. The use of hewn stone 
contributed to the quality of the sculp- 
ture. One of the first really classical 
buildings in this sense is the small 
temple of Banteay Srei, some twenty 
kilometres north of Angkor. 
The layout of this jewel in stone is 
highly original, as it is not a temple- 
mountain, but a horizontal temple, 
where the successive closes represent 
a horizontal version of the superposed 
galleries typical of the pyramid form. 
But the fame of this miniature sanc- 
tuary is founded on its extraordinarily 
rich and elaborate decoration. Des- 
pite a certain leaning toward “pretti- 
ness” it reveals such authority in its 
excellence, such a marked feeling for 
grace and elegance, such a sure hand 
and such perfect mastery that it un- 
deniably represents one of the highest 
peaks of Khmer artistry. 
The little temple, built in 967 AD., is 
completely covered with divinities, 
nymphs and guardians, beautifully car- 
ved in the pink sandstone. The sur- 
face shows not an inch of stone which 
is not decorated with matchless craft, 
reminiscent in its luxuriance of the 
primeval forest around it.

MASTERPIECE OF TOWN-PLANNING (Continued) 
constructed during the reign of Surya- 
varman II (1113-1150), the most re- 
nowned and glorious of the Angkorian 
kings, Khmer architecture reached its 
culmination, both in perfection of form 
and spacing and in quality of crafts- 
manship. 
The temple proper is a veritable 
cathedral of the jungle. Paradoxically 
enough, it is a contemporary of the 
great gothic structures of Chartres, 
Sens or Notre-Dame de Paris. Ang- 
kor Wat is not only the largest, but 
also the finest of all the temples 
erected in the Indo-Chinese penin- 
sula. } 
The moat, nearly 200 metres wide, 
lines a rectangle measuring 1,500 by 
1,300 metres, and encloses an area of 
2 sq. km. larger than such a town as 
Timgad under the Roman empire. The 
temple forms the pivot of an urban 
system of which only the buildings 
constructed with durable materials 
have survived, but which must have 
housed a population of some 17,000 to 
20,000 people. 
The moat, measuring 53 km, round, 
is bridged on the west by a dyke 
supporting a causeway leading to an 
immense portico 235 metres long, pier- 
ced by three gateways. This spacious 
structure forming the main entrance 
prefigures the temple fagade, which 
comes into sight on the far side of 
these majestic propylaea. 
Another axial avenue 350 metres long 
leads to the foot of the temple pro- 
per, its fagade rising from a high, 
elaborately moulded sub-structure, 
dominated by the five towers crowned 
by a tiara-shaped stone roof. The 
colonnaded wings of the immense 
surrounding gallery, measuring 187 by 
215 metres, form a perfectly balanced 
composition. 
Along the inner walls of this gallery 
runs a fantastic sequence of bas- 
reliefs girdling the whole temple, 
which represents a distance of over 
500 metres. They constitute a sort of 
chronicle of the rulers of Angkor, 
combined with a pictorial mythology. 
Passing through the gateway, the 
visitor enters the cruciform courtyard 
found at the centre of all classical 
Angkorian architecture. lt consists of 
four small courts connected by cover- 
ed corridors and linking the friezed 
gallery to the gallery encircling the 
second precinct. 
The cruciform courtyard provides the 
first example of sandstone vaulting

supported by four rows of pillars to

tion, decorated in high relief by a 
dancing procession of Devata and 
Apsara (Indian goddesses). 
To proceed to the upper storey, the 
three parallel galleries in the court- 
yard follow the rise of the covered 
stairways by an arrangement of super- 
posed overlapping arches. The gallery 
running round the second storey 
opens inwards only, through balustrad- 
ed windows. This second precinct, 
measuring 100x115 metres, encloses 
the enormous base of the temple 
13 metres high, topped by the five 
towers of the sanctuary. 
The third tier of the temple-moun- 
tain is also formed by an encircling 
gallery, but its balustraded windows 
open outwards, while pillared porticos 
look on to the inner patios. The central 
shrine, on a level with the four corner 
towers, is connected with the gallery 
by covered cloisters, as in the cruci- 
form courtyard. Resting on four pro- 
jecting porches, it soars a sheer 
42 metres upwards to its summit 
65 metres above the level of the plain.

ture can be clearly perceived, plann- 
ed in the image of the celestial palace 
which is the home of the gods. 
Upon the death of Suryavarman II, 
about 1150, the Khmers' neighbours, 
the Chams, took advantage of the 
general disorganization of the empire, 
then plunged in palace revolutions and 
struggles for the throne, to carry out 
a daring raid against Angkor, which 
they destroyed by fire in 1177. The 
merit of restoring the Khmer power 
belongs to King Jayavarman VII; he 
succeeded in expelling the invaders, 
and was crowned King of Angkor in 
1181, when he at once undertook the 
total reconstruction of the city. 
Jayavarman forsook the Hindu reli- 
gion of his predecessors and was con- 
verted to Buddhism. An entirely new 
style of building suddenly sprang up, 
redolent of an oddly fascinating baro- 
que, which superseded the classic for- 
malism of Angkor Wat by a new con- 
ception of space and volume: a new 
art flowered where no line was drawn 
between sculpture and architecture. 
The towers of the temples were car- 
ved with colossal faces in relief, 
representing both the image of Buddha 
Sakyamuni (Gautama the Sage), and 
the effigy of layavarman VII. There 
of the temple of Banteay Srei. 
was thus a complete upheaval in both 
religion and its outward forms. 
The King first erected the temple- 
city of Ta Prohm, which covered an 
area of 1,000 by 600 metres. , The 
temple proper was built on a plan 
which was to serve as a model for 
most of the Buddhist monasteries 
constructed in Jayavarman's reign. 
The fundamental conception was that 
of the horizontal temple already applied 
at Banteay Srei, but the precincts were 
enclosed with concentric peripheral 
galleries as well as walls. 
Thus, the progressive encroach- 
ment of the surrounding galleries on 
the steps of the temple-pyramid 
was completed, while the symbolism 
remained the same in the horizontal 
temple as in the temple-mountain. 
The layout of the Preah Khan tem- 
ple, encompassed by a moat 40 metres 
wide and covering an area of about 
1,000 by 750 metres, closely resembled 
that of Ta Prohm; but both these 
structures were hurriedly and perfunc- 
torily built, the construction often being 
of mediocre standard, the adornment 
crude and lifeless. All the buildings 
put up in Jayavarman VII's reign show 
signs of haste.

Angkorian architecture. It marked

the decadence of the Khmer empire.

once introduced a new style; the five 
dykes crossing the moat supported a

THE KHMER SMILE 
  
by Philippe Stern 
Wor a strange yet wonder- 
ful monument we have in the Bayon 
at Angkor. 
The Bayon is the last of the great 
Khmer monuments in stone. Khmer 
art began in the 6th century A.D. 
on territory very roughly correspond- 
ing to the Cambodia of today; but dur- 
ing about the first half of its evolution, 
its monuments, which frequently 
contained very beautiful statues and 
were remarkable for their decoration 
(especially on the lintels), were only 
small buildings made up of separate 
elements. 
It was not till later, after the found- 
ation of Angkor in the late Sth or 
early 10th century A.D. that large 
temples began to appear, with con- 
centric enclosures, and constructed 
in stone instead of brick. 
At Angkor, some thirty monuments 
were still standing until very recently 
and, apart from a brief period in the 
10th century, Angkor remained a 
capital until the decline of the splen- 
dour of the Khmers with Jayavar- 
man Vlil—and even for some time 
thereafter. 
At the Bayon two outstanding points 
of interest compel our attention. One 
is the outer gallery which, though in 
ruins, still has intact walls covered 
with bas-reliefs. From one point in their 
PHILIPPE STERN, of France, Is one of the 
great names connected with the study of 
Khmer art. He is the originator of a now 
widely adopted research method which 
enabled him to explain the evolution and 
establish the chronology of Khmer art. His 
book “Les Monuments Khmers du Style du 
Bayon et layavarman VII" Is an internation- 
ally accepted source book for scholars. 
At present he is working on a book on aes- 
thetics the central theme of which, “the 
smile“, is discussed in the article published 
here. Another of Philippe Stern's works is 
currently in press: “Colonnes Indiennes 
d'Ajanta et d'Ellora: Evolution et Répercus- 
sions" (Publications du Musée Guimet, 
Presses Universitaires de France). Honorary 
curator-in-chief of the Musées de France 
(Arts Asiatiques), he contributed greatly to 
the development and renovation of the 
Musée Guimet of Paris, which is famous for 
its Oriental collections. Phiiippe Stern was 
also one of the first scholars to take a 
serious interest In the music of Asia and 
Africa. For his various books on Angkor see

### 54457: The Khmer smile of the Bayon

OF THE BAYON 
development, the great Khmer temples 
were generally made up of concentric 
galleries encircling a central sanctuary, 
and from the 12th century AD. 
onwards, the outer galleries were 
covered with bas-reliefs, such as those 
seen at Angkor Wat, Banteay Chmar 
and the Bayon. 
At the Bayon we find an interesting 
innovation on the bas-reliefs. Along 
the base of one of them a series of 
little scenes of daily life unfoids before 
our eyes. (Photos pages 30-38.) 
These bas-reliefs give us a remark- 
able insight into the crafts and occup- 
ations and the homely details of the 
life of the people of the time. Khmer 
art is a religious art, and these scenes 
are remarkable, not only in themselves, 
but because nowhere else in Khmer 
architecture are similar works of a 
non-religious nature to be found. 
But far more striking is the upper 
part of the monument. The Bayon is 
a ‘“temple-mountain” of the type 
usually constructed by each of the 
great Khmer kings in the form of a 
tiered pyramid. The temple-mountain 
was considered to be the centre of 
the world of men just as the divine 
mountain was the centre of the world 
of the gods. 
The tower-sanctuaries of the Bayon 
are striking in that on each of their 
four sides there is a gigantic face 
representing the divinity and the deifi- 
ed king merged into one, with all the 
faces irradiating royal benevolence to 
the four points of the compass, “look- 
ing everywhere”, as the texts say. 
This was an innovation of the great 
Buddhist king . Jayavarman VII (who 
reigned from approximately 1181 to 
1219 A.D.), which corresponded to his 
major religious reform undertaken, 
according to my findings (1), some ten 
years after his reign began. Since 
there are more than fifty of these 
towers, the Bayon constitutes a most 
extraordinary architectural and sculp- 
tural complex. 
During the construction of the upper 
part of the Bayon it was decided to 
enlarge the building as originally plan- 
ned. As a result earlier sculptures 
(1) See my book ‘Les Monuments khmers 
du style du Bayon et Jayavarman VII°, 
published by Presses Unlversitalres de 
France, which contains translations and quo- 
tations from philological studies by G. Coe- 
dés and other writers on the great historical 
figure layavarman VIL 
  
were hidden and the general effect 
was one of near chaos. Yet on reach- 
ing the upper section the visitor is 
stupefied by the astounding sight it 
offers from every viewpoint. He is 
greeted on all sides and from every 
height and angle by faces which echo 
and reflect each other. And many of 
these faces are smiling. 
Later Buddhism, or mahayana (Bud- 
dhism of the Great Vehicle), differed 
markedly from early Buddhism. And 
the Buddhist smile, found on the later 
statues such as those at the Bayon, 
is the height of perfection and beauty. 
(Photos, cover and page 17.) Here 
the face is shown carved with closed 
eyes. 
What does this smile really mean? 
For me it is a concrete example of the 
notion—basic to our aesthetic concep- 
tions—which, when expressed in 
words, could be translated as a union 
of opposites, but which, in reality, are 
opposites that have not yet emerged 
as distinct entities. In other words a 
notion which transcends language and 
concepts. 
The closed eyes thus express an 
‘inwardness, set apart from everyday 
things, the search in one's innermost 
depths for a transcendental detach- 
ment and a supra-human peace, the 
way to nirvana; whereas the smile, ris- 
ing also from the innermost depths, 
represents the almost tender Buddhist 
charity of communication and com- 
munion with all creatures, imparted by 
the smiling expression to the face as 
a whole. 
The style at the Bayon thus has a 
unity of expression which is that of 
the masculine bodhisattvas (heads sur- 
mounted by a cylinder with a small 
statuette) or the corresponding femi- 
nine prajnaparamita (where the stat- 
uette is placed on a cone above the 
head. (Photo page 16.) 
The bodhisattvas of the Great Vehi- 
cle are the miraculous, almost divine 
beings who, after countless lives of 
detachment and charity (perhaps also 
of cognition) have succeeded in trans- 
migrating to the very threshold of 
nirvana, where they could be freed 
from all suffering by losing their indi- 
viduality and merging into the Ineffa- 
ble, which no words can adequately 
describe. But they refuse to be set 
free, in order to devote themselves 
compassionately to the salvation of 
others, and until such time as all

layavarman VII was so strongly 
imbued with this Buddhist charity that 
the stele inscriptions near the hospitals 
(see below) bear the words “He suffer- 
ed from the ills of his subjects more 
than from his own: for it is the grief of 
the people that causes the grief of 
kings, and not their own grief”. 
In the Khmer heads of this period 
(Photos opposite) the closed eyes and 
the lips drawn out in a deep smile 
draw us irresistibly into an inner world 
of surpassing peace and tender com- 
passion for all creatures.

| referred earlier to deified kings. 
But except in the case of layavar- 
man VII, at the end of the period of 
Khmer splendour, what the statue 
represents is the divinity portrayed 
according to the contemporary canons 
of beauty, completely idealized and 
devoid of any individual resemblance 
(this is perhaps where its value lies). 
This is true whether the statues are 
Hindu (the supreme gods Siva or Vish- 
nu) or Buddhist. Only the inscription 
indicates that particular human beings 
(to begin with, only kings, then grad- 
ually members of the royal family and 
even high dignitaries) were consider- 
ed after death to have been merged 
into the divine, the deity represented 
by the statue. It is with Jayavar- 
man VII, presumably identified with 
Buddha himself (the “Enlightened™) 
that we first see the expression of 
spirituality combined with the portrait 
of the individual. (Photos cover and 
page 17). 
This brings to our attention a curious 
and moving fact. The representations 
of the “deep smile” are very rare in 
the history of art (to my belief there 
are only four periods). The reigns of 
two great kings who were also reli- 
gious reformers, Amenophis IV-Akhe- 
naton of ancient Egypt (14th century 


### 54457: The Khmer smile of the Bayon

THE SMILE 
OF DEEP 
CONTEMPLATION 
Few Eastern forms of artistic expression 
surpass in beauty the deep smile of the 
statues of Angkor (right, a deified queen or 
princess; centre, King layavarman VII). 
Compare this smile with the ghost of a 
smile on the lips of the pharaoh and reli- 
gious reformer, Amenophis IV or Akhenaton 
(extreme right) who reigned in Egypt 
during the 14th century B.C. It reveals a 
world of humanity and sweet serenity 
which was expressed to perfection in 
Khmer art. The smile shines out from the 
vast countenances of the “towers with 
faces” at the Bayon, signifying the bene- 
volent contemplation of the Buddha encom- 
passing the whole universe. (Below, aerial 
view of the Bayon.) 
B.C.) and the Khmer king layavar- 
man VII (late 12th and early 13th cen- 
turies A.D.), both coincide with such 
a period (Photos page 17). It is cer- 
tainly not by chance, for the smile 
is linked with communication, under- 
standing communion, compassion and 
even tenderness. 
A still more astonishing coincidence 
Is the fact that in both cases, heads 
of statues representing spiritualized 
portraits have come down to us. The 
colossal head of Amenophis IV, at 
Karnak, reveals one of the most extra- 
ordinary faces found on a work of 
sculpture, with its elongated profile, 
high cheekbones and long chin. 
The head of Jayavarman VII, on 
the other hand, though also extremely 
individualized so that one can immed- 
iately recognize it in other portraits 
of the king, is broad-featured and 
slightly puffed up. Nevertheless it 
retains all its spirituality (G. Coedés 
has proved that the portrait is indeed 
that of Jayavarman VII). 
In Egypt, Amenophis IV, who took 
the name of Akhenaton at El Amarna, 
was perhaps the first monotheist ruler, 
and his hymn to the sun is compared 
in Daniel Rops’ “Le Roi ivre de Dieu” 
with the biblical psalm 104, with which 
it is identical, verse for verse. In view 
of the approximate date of the Exodus 
and the possibly legendary history of 
Moses, this in all likelihood indicates 
the influence of Akhenaton on the 
ible. 
Jayavarman VII showed throughout 
his life the intense charity of Buddhism 
(“the grief of the people causes the 
grief of kings” is only one of many 
apposite quotations), and was, as we 
shall see in a moment, a great religious 
reformer. At El Amarna there is also 
the feeling for family life, emphasized 
by Boisselier, in the same way as in 
the bas-reliefs of the Bayon to which 
we have already referred (Photos 
pages 30-38). 
Thus a comparison may be drawn 
between Amenophis IV and Jayavar- 
man VII for their leaning towards the 
same kind of humanism; but there is 
no possibility of the one having 
influenced the other, separated as they

were by geography and above all by 
25 centuries of history. 
Another striking particularity of Jaya- 
varman VI| is that he appears to have 
built up a highly complex and statistic- 
ally-minded civil service. With aston- 
ishing accuracy, he indicates almost 
to a man the number of temple staff 
and the objects attributed to the tem- 
ples. Thus there is a record of how 
many tower-sanctuaries there are to 
each monument, how many dwellings 
(probably sections of galleries), the 
length of the enclosing walls and of 
the moats that flanked them. 
The Bayon was not only the royal 
temple of Jayavarman VII, perhaps 
intended as his tomb (the two were 
frequently combined), but also a pan- 
theon containing statues of many of 
the gods of the kingdom; though not 
all apparently, since we know from 
inscriptions that there were 24,400 of 
them. There were 8,176 villages 
dedicated to the temples and 208,532 
men and women, including 1,622 danc- 
ing girls. 
One example of Jayavarman Vll's 
attention to minute detail is the hos- 
pitals. His Buddhist charity had its 
practical aspect, and at intervals along 
the roads he had resting-places (“hou- 
ses with hearths”) erected, 121 of 
which were in existence 10 years after 
he acceded to the throne; also hos- 
pitals, 102 of which were already in 
operation five years after his acces- 
sion. 
The specifications for each hospital 
were meticulously precise. “All four 
castes may be treated here. There are 
two doctors, each having one male and 
two female assistants entitled to free 
accommodation, two storekeepers res- 
ponsible for the distribution of medica- 
ments... two cooks entitled to free 
fuel and water, responsible for remov- 
ing dead flowers and cleaning the 
temple (a chapel annexed to the hos- 
pitals)... fourteen hospital attendants 
responsible for administering the medi- 
caments... two women to pound 
rice... a total staff of 32, 98 if one 
includes those who pay for their own 
accommodation.” The various lists are 
never-ending. 
It is not possible to list all the 
numerous symbolic elements linked to 
Jayavarman VII's major religious 
reform, such as the corner decora- 
tions, apparently of cosmic signifi- 
cance, in which the lion is placed 
above the elephant and the garuda, a 
fabulous bird, above the lion. 
To take only the specific example of 
the Bayon, there is the multiplication 
of the tower-sanctuaries with faces, 
as we have seen. Another of Jaya- 
varman VII's innovations were the 
stone town walls, several miles long, 
which like those at Bayon have gates 
at the four points of the compass, 
together with a fifth leading to the 
royal palace. The gates are surmount- 
ed by similar faces, and in front of 
them, flanking the causeway, are the 
minor gods (deva) and their enemies

no more than a tiny seed,’ said Pierre 
Loti, ‘‘carried by the wind to a frieze 
or the top of a tower, its fine, tentacular 
roots snaked down between the stones... 
reaching the soil, the roots swelled,

Member of a Chinese embassy sent to Cam- 
bodia in 1296 on a mission lasting almost a 
year, Chou Ta-kuan wrote the only eye- 
witness account known to exist of the 
Khmer kingdom at the height of its splend- 
our. His invaluable “Notes on the Customs 
of Cambodia’ became famous in China, It 
was an excellent piece of reporting, full of 
life and acutely-observed detail, as may be 
judged from the extracts below. [It was not 
until 1902 that Chou Ta-kuan’s Notes were 
transfated in full by the eminent French 
Oriental scholar Paul Pelliot. These extracts 
are taken from J. Gilman d’Arcy Paul's 
translation of Pelliot’s version in French, 
published by the Social Science Association 
Press, Bangkok in 1967. 
T O the Chinese the country called Cambo- 
dia is known as Ch'en-la or Ch'an-la and to its inhabitants 
as Kan-po-chih (Kam boja). The present dynasty, drawing 
on Tibetan religious lore, calls the country Kan-p’u-chih, a 
name phonetically allied to Kan-po-chih, 
    
The Royal Palace, as well as official buildings and homes 
of the nobles, all face to the east. The Royal Palace stands 
to the north of the Golden Tower and the Bridge of Gold. 
In the chamber where the Sovereign attends to affairs of 
state, there is a golden window, with mirrors disposed on 
square columns to the right and left of the window, forty or 
so in number. Below the window is a frieze of elephants. 
  
Every man or woman, from the Sovereign down, knots the 
hair and leaves the shoulders bare. Round the waist they 
wear a small strip of cloth, over which a larger piece is 
drawn when they leave their houses. Many rules, based on 
rank, govern the choice of materials. 
Only the ruler may wear fabrics woven in an all-over 
pattern. On his head he carries a diadem much like those 
worn by the vajradhara; at times he lays aside the diadem 
and weaves into his hair a garland of fragrant blossoms re- 
minding one of jasmine. 
Only the womenfolk of the commoners are permitted to 
stain the soles of their feet and the palms of their hands. 
This is forbidden to men. The wearing of fabrics patterned 
with recurring groups of flowers is permitted to high officers 
and princes. Ordinary mandarins are allowed to wear only 
material with two groups of flowers, and women of the peo- 
ple may do likewise. Should a Chinese, newly arrived, wear 
cloth with two groups of flowers, it cannot be charged 
against him, for he is “An-ting pa-sha”, “a man who does 
not know the rules.” 
When functionaries go out in public, their insignia and the 
number of their attendants are regulated according to rank. 
The highest dignitaries use palanquins with golden shafts 
and four parasols with handles of gold; those next in rank 
have a palanquin with golden shafts and two gold-handled 
parasols; then come those entitled to one palanquin with 
gold shafts and one gold-handled parasol; and finally those 
with only a gold-handled parasol. Further down the line 
come those permitted only a silver-handled parasol. 
 
For ordinary correspondence, as well as official docu- 
ments, deer-skin or similar parchment is used, which is 
dyed black. The parchment is cut by the scribe in sizes to 
suit his needs. A sort of powder resembling Chinese chalk 
is moulded into small sticks called so, which are used to 
inscribe the parchment with lasting characters. When 
finished with writing, they place the so behind the ear. The 
nature of the characters makes it possible to recognize the 
writer. Rubbed with something moist, they disappear. All 
documents are read from left to right, and not from above 
to below. 


### 54459: Notes of a 13th century Chinese diplomat in Cambodia

Notes 
of a 13th century 
Chinese diplomat 
In Cambodia 
by Chou Ta-kuan 
In Cambodia the New Year begins with the tenth Chinese 
moon, and is called chia-te. In front of the royal palace a 
great platform is erected, sufficient to hold more than a 
thousand persons, and decorated from end to end with 
lanterns and flowers. Opposite this, some hundred and 
twenty feet distant, rises a lofty scaffold, put together of 
light pieces of wood, shaped like the scaffolds used in 
building stupas, and towering to a height of one hundred and 
twenty feet. Every night from three to six of these structures 
arise. Rockets and fire-crackers are placed on top of these 
—all this at great expense to the provinces and the noble 
families. As night comes on, the King is besought to take 
part in the spectacle. The rockets are fired, and the crack- 
ers touched off. The rockets can be seen at a distance of 
thirteen kilometres: the fire-crackers, large as swivel-guns, 
shake the whole city with their explosions. 
 
 
Every month a festival is held. The fourth month they 
have ball games. With the ninth month comes the ya-lieh 
or census, when the entire population of the kingdom is 
summoned to the capital and passed in review before the 
royal palace. With the fifth month comes the ceremony of 
“bringing water to the Buddhas.” Then Buddhas are car- 
ried from all over the kingdom, water is procured, and the 
ruler lends a hand in cleansing them. The festival of floats 
marks the sixth month, with the King enthroned on a 
belvedere to enjoy the spectacle. 
“The burning of the rice” marks the seventh month. This 
is the season for harvesting the new rice, which is brought 
to the South Gate and burned as a sacrifice to the Buddha. 
Countless women arrive in carts or on elephants to watch 
this ceremony, but the ruler is not to be seen. The eighth 
is the month of ai-lan, or dancing. Every day actors and 
musicians are summoned to the royal palace to perform the 
ai-lan. In addition battles are staged between boars and 
elephants. Foreign ambassadors are invited as guests of the 
King to these festivities, which last ten days. 
 
 
Every day the King holds two audiences for consideration 
of affairs of state. No list of agenda is provided. Function- 
aries and ordinary people who wish to see the Sovereign 
seat themselves on the ground to await his arrival. In the 
course of time distant music is heard in the palace, while 
from outside blasts on conch-shells sound forth as though 
to welcome the ruler. | have been told that at this point the 
Sovereign, coming from nearby, contents himself with only 
one golden palanquin, Two girls of the palace lift up the 
curtain with their slender fingers and the King, sword in 
hand, appears standing in the golden window. All present 
—ministers and commoners—join their hands and touch 
the earth with their foreheads, lifting up their heads only 
when the sound of conchs has ceased. The Sovereign 
seats himself at once on a lion's skin, which is an heredi- 
tary royal treasure. When the affairs of state have been 
dealt with the King turns back to the palace, the two girls 
let fall the curtain, and everyone rises. =   21

A ccione to the throne 
of Angkor after having overthrown a 
Thai prince imposed by the Siamese 
sovereign, Ponhea Yat, the king of 
the Khmers, decided to abandon his 
prestigious capital, prefering to estab- 
lish himself on the banks of the 
Mekong, first at Srei Santhor, then 
at Phnom Penh. 
According to generally accepted 
chronology, Ponhea Yat is supposed 
to have abandoned Angkor around 
1432. But in a recent study OW. Wol- 
ters fixes his accession to the throne 
at an earlier date and, consequently, 
holds that Angkor was abandoned 
around the year 1400. Wolters believes 
that Ponhea Yat may well have merely 
confirmed a change in residence which 
his predecessors had already carried 
out provisionally. 
Whatever the date, its causes 
remain the same. Situated close to 
the frontier and renowned for its 
splendour, Angkor was a much coveted 
and easily accessible prize and King 
Ponhea Yat understood this well. 
Abandoned by the monarchy, fre- 
quently occupied and pillaged, its 
sanctuaries mutilated and the cream 
of its population departed, the city 
was soon invaded by forest. 
Although Henri Mouhot is generally 
accorded the title of “discoverer of 
Angkor®, he is far from being the 
first to have found the city which 
was in fact never really lost. It was 
a sixteenth-century Khmer king who 
first “discovered” it. In the course of 
a hunting expedition, he came across 
this extraordinary city in the middle 
of the forest, which his predecessors 
had abandoned less than a century 
earlier. 
The Portuguese, Diego do Couto, 
relates the circumstances of this 
discovery: “Around the year 1550 or 
1551, the King of Cambodia was 
hunting elephants in the most dense 
forest areas of the kingdom, as was 
his habit. His people, cutting through 
the brush, came upon some imposing 
constructions invaded by luxuriant 
undergrowth which they were unable 
to penetrate. 
“And this being told to the king, he 
went to the site and, seeing the extent 
and height of the exterior walls, wanted 
to see the interior as well. Immedia- 
tely he gave orders that all the under- 
growth be cut and burnt... And, after 
everything had been carefully cleaned, 
the king entered within. After exam- 
ining the whole site, the king was 
struck with admiration by the extent 
of the constructions. For this reason, 
MADELEINE GITEAU is a French Oriental 
scholar and member of the Ecole Francaise 
d'Extréme-Orient on whose behalf she has 
undertaken a number of missions to South- 
East Asia. Former curator of the National 
Museum of Phnom Penh, she was commission- 
ed by Unesco to study and catalogue the 
coilections of the Wat Phra Keo Museum of 
Vientiane, Laos. She Is the author of several 
works on Khmer civilization and Asian art

100 YEARS OF EFFORT 
by Madeleine Giteau 
he straightway decided to move his 
court there” (1). 
It was thus that, in the 16th century, 
the monarchy returned to Angkor. 
All the same, the date suggested by 
Diego do Couto seems a little late; 
inscriptions on the later bas-reliefs 
at Angkor Wat tell us that these 
sculptures were begun, on the king's 
orders, in 1546. It is probable that 
the sculpting of the later bas-reliefs 
at Angkor Wat is related to the return 
of the monarchy to the region. This 
return, then, probably took place 
around the beginning of the second 
quarter of the 16th century, at the 
latest. 
The king of Cambodia at that time 
was Ang Chan, a brilliant sovereign 
who, for a few years, restored the 
lustre of the Khmer monarchy. After 
his death, the kings of Cambodia con- 
tinued, for a while, to reside at Angkor. 
Portuguese and Spanish mission- 
aries then arriving in Cambodia were 
able to see Angkor and their marvelling 
accounts are to be found in contem- 
porary works, 
The capital, however, remained at 
Lovek, to the south-east of the Great 
Lake. In 1593, the Thais captured 
Lovek, Satha fled to Laos and ihe 
monarchy, which fell back on Srei 
Santhor, was beset by war and usur- 
pation. 
Although their residence was at Srei 
Santhor, or at Oudong, the Cambodian 
kings continued to visit Angkor. 
Throughout the 17th century, sove- 
reigns made pilgrimages to this shrine, 
which had witnessed the great days 
of their dynasty. The chronicles 
mention these journeys, and the events 
which marked them. 
At the end of the 17th century, the 
monarchy abandoned Angkor for good. 
In the 18th century, the Thais and 
Vietnamese exercised increasing pres- 
sure on Cambodia, so there was no 
question of the kings either going to 
Angkor or ensuring its upkeep. Little 
by little the undergrowth crept back 
into Angkor Thom, though Angkor Wat 
remained a cult shrine. 
From the 16th century to our own 
times successive new religious foun- 
dations were made and the site 
attracted Khmer pilgrims and foreign 
visitors. Evidence of this lies in the 
accumulated statues in the galleries 
and in the Cruciform Courtyard and 
in the inscriptions translated by

au 16° siécle d'aprés les sources portugaises 
et espagnoles”, by Bernard Groslier and 
C.R. Boxer, Paris 1958. 
Etienne Aymonier. In wood or in 
stone, in princely or monastic attire, 
the buddhist images of Angkor Wat 
illustrate every school of sculpture 
that has flourished in the post-Angko- 
rian period. 
Texts published throughout the 17th 
and 18th centuries prove that the 
ruins of Angkor remained famous. In 
1676, a Spanish historian, the Domi- 
nican Navarrete, reported that, in 
Cambodia, “There are magnificent 
monuments and decoration more per- 
fect than one can say”; he recounts a 
frequently formulated theory according 
to which Alexander the Great “built 
this most sumptuous of monuments, 
enclosed within its courtyards and 
cloisters”. At the beginning of the 
17th century, a Japanese pilgrim, who 
had come to Cambodia, drew up a plan 
of Angkor Wat, of which a copy was 
made in 1715. 
Foiown the Portu- 
guese and the Spanish, the French 
came to hear of Angkor. In 1668, in 
the course of a stay in Cambodia, 
Father Chevreul mentions Angkor, and 
emphasizes the fame of this holy place 
throughout south-east Asia. 
At the end of the 18th century, 
Father Langenois, who had been sent 
as a missionary to Battambang, visited 
Angkor of which he gave a short 
description in latin, a description which 
was later made use of by Father Bouil- 
levaux. Father Langenois recounts, 
in a letter, the visit of the Portuguese 
missionary, Father Carpo de Orta, and 
describes a typical sculpture which 
must have been a representation of 
the ascetic Sumedha, an incarnation 
of the Buddha in a former life, 
Thus, at the end of the 18th century, 
thanks to travellers both from the West 
and from the Far East, the existence 
of Angkor, the fine layout of its 
buildings, the richness of its decora- 
tions and even certain of its sculptures 
were known. These accounts however, 
were only known to a restricted public, 
since they often remained stored in the 
archives of monastic orders. 
If we cannot accord to 19th century 
travellers the glory of having dis- 
covered Angkor, at least they have the 
merit of having revealed the celebrated 
dead city to the public at large. In 
1858, Father Bouillevaux published a 
description of Angkor, which he had 
visited in 1850. Bouillevaux was 
subsequently to contest the title of 
“discoverer of Angkor” with Henri 
Mouhot. But Bouillevaux had not 
really discovered Angkor, and the

profound beauties of Khmer art quite 
clearly utterly escaped him. 
This was not the case with the natu- 
ralist Mouhot, who visited Angkor in 
1860. He died shortly after, but his 
notes were published after his death. 
If not the “discoverer of Angkor”, at 
least he appreciated the extraordinary 
artistic value of these ruins. He 
imparted his enthusiasm to the readers 
of a variety of publications, including 
the mass-circulation “Tour du Monde”, 
and from then on visitors to Angkor 
began to increase in numbers. 
A permanent Mission to Indochina, 
later to become the Ecole Francaise 
de .I'Extréme Orient, was founded on 
December 15th, 1898, under the 
patronage of the Academie des In- 
scriptions et Belles lettres. Its aim was 
to study not only the monuments, but 
also the history, the languages and 
the civilizations of south-east Asia 
and neighbouring countries. When 
the treaty of 1907, concluded with 
Siam, returned the province of Siem 
Reap to Cambodia, the Conservation 
d'’Angkor was set up to clear and 
restore the monuments. 
From its foundation, the Conserva- 
tion was entrusted to J. Commaille. 
When, in 1916, Commaille was mur- 
dered by pirates while delivering the 
workmen's pay, his place was taken 
by H. Marchal who remained there- 
till 1932. H. Marchal was subsequently 
to return to the Conservation twice: 
in 1935, and, in 1947, in order to 
restore the South Gallery at Angkor 
Wat. Since 1960 the Conservation 
has been directed by B. Groslier. 
Commaille's first task was to open 
up the monuments, to clear away the 
forest which had engulfed them, keep 
the ever threatening undergrowth at 
bay, remove the accumulated earth 
and the piled up debris, and prevent 
their further degradation. Only very 
simple equipment was available to the 
first curators. Nonetheless this was 
sufficient to deal with the most urgent 
problems. 
The most important innovation in the 
restoration of the temples was the 
adoption of anastylosis, a process 
which consists in restoring a monu- 
ment with its own materials and 
according to the original construction 
methods. 
In 1930, H. Marchal was sent to 
Java, where archaeologists had already 
used this method. On his return, 
Marchal applied the method to the 
restoration of the temple of Banteay 
Srei. Anastylosis was subsequently 
used in the restoration of the greatest 
monuments, and it has remained the

forgotten city 
cleared from the jungle 
basic process for work carried out 
since that time. 
The piety of the Cambodians, and 
the establishment of two monasteries 
within the enclosure had saved Angkor 
Wat from invasion by the undergrowth; 
but ground subsidence and the poor 
state of the stonework had led to 
widespread decay. Long years of 
effort have gone into the restoration 
of Angkor Wat; the tireless work of 
restoring collapsed elements, of con- 
solidating and reconstructing the gal- 
leries has begun; finally research has 
produced good results in dealing with 
stone decay. 
The Bayon temple was cleared 
between 1911 and 1913, and anasty- 
losis of the towers with faces was 
carried out between 1939 and 1946. 
After 1960, research was undertaken 
aimed at removing the lichen which 
covers the stone reliefs, giving the 
monuments a leprous appearance. 
Won was begun on the 
Great Palace of Angkor Thom and its 
approaches in 1911. Bas-reliefs in 
the interior of the Elephants’ Terrace 
and the Terrace of the Leprous King 
were discovered at that time. 
Just before the events of 1970, 
excavations had revealed a prolonga- 
tion of the Terraces to the north of the 
Terrace of the Leprous King. Close 
to the Great Palace of Angkor Thom, 
the Temple of Baphuon, built on an 
artificial hill of light soil, had heen 
dislocated in ancient times by sub- 
sidences. The many attempts to con- 
solidate the monument had brought 
only temporary relief and so, in 1958, 
it was decided to reconstruct the 
temple completely. This considerable 
undertaking—the base of Baphuon 
measures 120 m. xX 100 metres—was 
partially carried out in 1970. 
Restoration work has been carriad 
out both within the enclosure and in 
the surroundings of Angkor Thom. 
Three of the roads, lined by stone 
giants, which give access to the city, 
have been restored, each road leading 
to a monumental gate surmounted by 
a tower with four faces. The temples 
of Ta Keo, Ta Prohm, Preah Khan, 
Banteay Kdei, Ta Nei and many others 
have been excavated and partially 
restored. Following the restoration of 
Banteay Srei, Banteay Samre, Neak 
Pean and the central sanctuary of 
Bakong were restored by anastylosis. 
While the excavation and the resto- 
ration of the temples was going on, 
researchers were studying the con- 
siderable documentation afforded by 
these monuments. 
Those who were beginning to take 
an interest in Khmer art could linger 
lovingly over the romantically exotic 
drawings that illustrated Louis Dela- 
porte’'s “Voyage to Cambodia” and 
examine the first photographic docu- 
mentation in John Thomson's book. 
Publication of the works of H. Dufour 
and G. Carpeaux has meant that full 
details of the bas-reliefs of the Bayon 
are available to researchers. Car- 
peaux, the son of the famous French 
sculptor, was to die at this task. 
At the same time Commandant 
Lunet de la Jonquiére produced a 
“Descriptive Inventory of the Monu- 
ments of Cambodia”, a basic work 
still of great value 60 years later. 
The abstracts and architectural studies 
of the monuments were primarily the 
work of Henri Parmentier, head of 
the Archaeological Department of the 
Ecole Francaise d'Extréme Orient. 
To pinpoint the vestiges of monu- 
ments, of successive town walls and 
the traces of roads and hydraulic 
works, Victor Goloubev directed an 
aerial survey lasting from 1931 to 
1934. This survey was resumed by 
Bernard Groslier in 1951. 
The sites of Angkor have yielded 
a large number of inscriptions. Fol- 
lowing the work of the German epi- 
graphist Adolf Bastian, the Dutch 
scholar Hendrik Kern became inte- 
rested in Khmer epigraphy. He in 
turn was followed by the German 
August Barth and the Frenchman 
Abel Bergaigne who translated the 
first collection of inscriptions. Finally 
Georges Coedés published eight 
volumes of these inscriptions and suc- 
ceeded in re-constituting the history 
of Angkorian Cambodia and in bring- 
ing to life again great kings who had 
long been forgotten. 
Thus we learnt which kings and 
dignitaries had constructed temples 
and the nature of their religious foun- 
dations was revealed. Like Bernard 
Groslier, Laurence Briggs, who publish- 
ed a history of Angkor, followed the 
fortunes of the city after the removal 
of the capital to the east. Finally, 
Jean Filliozat, Director of the Ecole 
Francaise d’Extréme Orient, began a 
study of the temples as seen in 
Indian texts. 
An important step forward in our 
knowledge of Khmer art was due to 
Philippe Stern who established the 
chronological order of the monuments 
on the basis of the evolution of their 
decorative motifs. 
Now, after a century of research 
and effort, Angkor is as well known to 
the general public as to the schola 
and the art-lover. |

T: walls of the Bayon temple 
of Angkor bear striking testimony to the exceptional care and 
interest that King Jayavarman Vl took in the joys and suffer- 
ings of his people. Towards the end of the 12th century, 
Jayavarman ordered his sculptors to carve on the outer walls 
of the Bayon the minutest details of the daily life of his 
subjects, providing a veritable saga of the humble men and 
women who had contributed to his empire's greatness. 
A profusion of carvings of people, plants and animals unfolds 
before our eyes like a gigantic strip cartoon, completely 
covering the 1,300 square metres (approx 14,000 sq. ft.) of the 
Bayon gallery walls (above, the outer gallery to the south of 
the temple). The carvings present scenes from the everyday 
life of the common people, their work, their food, their

amusements, etc. The daily life of the Khmers was linked to 
the rhythm of the two main seasons of the year: the dry 
season, the time of festivals and leisure activities, and the 
rainy season, the time of work in the paddy-fields. Here the 
close link between the temple and the rice crop is clearly 
evident (see article page 6). 
From sunrise to dusk, craftsman, merchant and housewife 
went about their business. From 6 a.m. to noon the markets 
were particularly animated with their stalls laden with 
vegetables, rice, herbs and spices, fish and meat, silks from 
China, pewter-ware from Chen-chou, porcelain from Ch’uan- 
chou, fishing tackle, medicines, combs and trinkets and hard- 
ware of every kind. (Photo left, detail of a teapot measuring 
only a few centimetres on the Bayon wall.)

12TH CENTURY DIARY IN STONE (Continued) 
The Khmer sculptor had a keen eye for the human foibles and 
idiosyncrasies of his fellow men whom he carved with 
spontaneous realism and an occasional touch of humour. We 
can pick out merchants and craftsmen, masons shaping their 
stone (above right), pedlars selling grilled fish on skewers 
(above left), cooks busy at their ovens preparing cakes, 
cooking rice or serving drinks (below). Elsewhere the artist 
regales us with scenes from the life of the nobility, from 
military life, of craftsmen sitting down to a communal meal. 
He shows us landscapes, farmyard scenes, cattle (right, a bull 
tethered to a tree), as well as amusing incidents such as the 
youngster pilfering goods from a stall while its owner is 
taking a short siesta.

12TH CENTURY DIARY IN STONE (continued from page 32) 
On the following four pages we present a photo-panorama 
of one of the complete outer walls of the Bayon temple. 
The bas-reliefs on the inner walls are devoted to religious and 
court scenes. The outer walls portray scenes from daily life 
and historical events in Angkor’s past. Here the sculptors 
gave free rein to their narrative talents. 
Many of the scenes they depicted were doubtless inspired 
by the festivities connected with the celebration of the New 
Year and the Rice and Dance Festivals. Below, an acrobat, 
lying on his back, manipulates a wheel with his feet, while 
another actually seems to be performing a juggling act, 
balancing children on his head and hands. A tightrope-walker 
sways above the crowds, who watch with open-mouthed 
admiration. Hunting scenes are frequent, with the hunters 
attacking game of all kinds with bow and arrow, crossbow 
and blowpipe. (Photo right, detail of bird perched on abranch).

Amidst the wealth of plants and animal and human figures in 
the Bayon bas-relief (above), can you spot the crocodile and 
fish, captured and magnified by the camera's lens (right) ? 
If not, turn the page and you will see this same detail in its 
broader fishing scene setting. The three photographs togeth- 
er illustrate the extraordinary carving ability of the Khmer 
artists and their skill in portraying fine detail as well as the 
revelatory powers of modern photographic art. The panorama 
shown on these two pages and the two previous pages 
represents 26 metres, that is 85 ft. or one tenth of the length 
of the wall with its bas-reliefs five metres (16%, ft.) high 
which surrounds the Bayon temple. 
12TH CENTURY DIARY IN STONE (continued from page 34) 
The temples of Angkor Wat were veritable cities within a city 
and their towers looked out over a huge urban area with its 
artificial lakes, its palaces, its residential quarter for ambass- 
adors and high dignitaries its jewellers’ and weavers’ stalls, 
its painters’ and sculptors’ studios, its masons’ and carpen- 
ters’ workshops. Beyond lay the rural suburbs where lived 
the peasants, market-gardeners and fishermen. Thanks 
to the genius of the Khmer sculptors, many details of their 
working methods have come down to us across the gulf of 
eight centuries. For example, a whole sequence of the 
Bayon bas-reliefs is devoted to fishing which, though practi- 
ced all the year round, really came into its own during the dry 
season, when the amateur angler, freed from his work in 
the paddy-fields, could devote himself to the sport.

through waters abounding with turtles, crocodiles and fish 
of all kinds. In the stern is the oarsman, while, in the bows, 
the fisherman has just cast his net. Between them, a third 
member of the crew displays his catch. Fishing with nets 
probably took place on rivers and on the great artificial lakes 
which the Khmers built. The fishermen’s flimsy craft are 
dwarfed by the big pleasure boats, like the one in the centre

### 54457: The Khmer smile of the Bayon

THE KHMER SMILE OF THE BAYON 
(the asura) holding out the mythical 
serpent above the waters of the moats. 
According to Paul Mus and to 
G. Coedés, this is all intended to 
symbolize the rainbow, linking the 
world of men to that of the gods, and 
also the Churning of the Sea of Milk, 
a cosmic myth related to the grandeur 
of the kings frequently found in Khmer 
bas-reliefs, in this case sculptured in 
the round and on a gigantic scale. 
The story goes that in one of his 
incarnations, or avatars (the Hindu 
belief in avatars was retained by the 
Buddhist Jayavarman VII by syncretism 
between the two religions) the Hindu 
god Vishnu, in the form of a tortoise, 
upholds the Sacred Mount while 
deva on one side and asura on the 
other, grasping the mythical serpent, 
with the Sacred Mount serving as a 
churn, make many wondrous things 
gush forth from the Sea of Milk, 
culminating with the ambrosia of im- 
mortality (amrita). 
Paul Mus suggests that the deva 
at each gate probably have their corres- 
ponding asura at the gate on the oppo- 
site side of the town; and that since 
the Bayon was situated at the centre 
of these walls and gates, it was preci- 
sely a symbol of the Sacred Mount, 
used for the Churning of the Sea of 
Milk on a gigantic scale. 
T HE fact that the Bayon was 
considered to be the centre of the 
town both gave rise to, and later dissi- 
pated, a serious error in research. An 
inscription which is of a late period, but 
lengthy and detailed, indicates that the 
king who founded Angkor (Yasovar- 
man) had the royal linga or “God- 
King”, the phallic emblem of Siva, 
erected on the central hill, and since 
the temple-mountain of the Bayon was 
at the centre of these stone walls, it 
was assumed that the Bayon was the 
first great Khmer monument... when 
in fact it was the last. 
When | began to study the Khmers, 
this was the key used in dating all the 
other temples, with the result that the 
chronological sequence of the monu- 
ments of Angkor was the wrong way 
round. 
My whole career as an archaeologist 
has been based on a method which 
lays no claim to replace other methods, 
but merely to complement them. It 
consists in attempting to establish the 
chronological order of monuments and 
of the evolution of types of art, motifs 
or styles, by making comparisons with 
the development of a certain number 
of motifs chosen on the basis of 
experiments devised for this purpose. 
When applied to Khmer art, this me- 
thod proved that the date attributed 
to the Bayon was impossible and must 
be considerably later. 
| thus had the honour and the good 
fortune, together possibly with some 
insight, of proposing a complete 
change which put research on the right 
lines. | did not however go far enough 
in either direction, and it was 
G. Coedés, on examining the inscrip- 
tions after | had published the results 
of my work, who situated the exact 
date of the Bayon during the reign of 
Jayavarman VII. At the same time, the 
centre of the original town was iden- 
tified from the air by V. Goloubev as 
being even more different than | had 
thought. 
The original error, as indicated in 
my first book, derived from the fact 
that the Bayon is the centre of an 
enclosure whose gates are of the 
same style as the Bayon and accord- 
ingly of the same period. Previously, 
the successive centres of Angkor had 
been located elsewhere. 
Thus the establishment of the entire 
chronology of the Khmer monuments 
hinged on the Bayon. 
At the close of my career, it was 
again the Bayon, with the constructions 
added by Jayavarman VII to monu- 
ments built during his own reign to 
house new gods (this was a time of 
great enthusiasm for deifying human 
beings), which enabled me to cross- 
check the method employed. 
To take a single example, the female 
figures on the walls (devata or apsara) 
differed considerably according to 
whether they belonged to the first, or 
the third and last period of the style. 
Where these two different types, indic- 
ating the beginning and the end of the 
style, are to be found side by side on 
the same gallery in the same monu- 
ment, there is always between them a 
vestige on the wall of the architectural 
addition separating the new part from 
the older one, providing objective proof 
of the accuracy with which the 
development of the motifs has been 
studied. 
This is demonstrated in my book 
“Les monuments khmers du style du 
Bayon et Jayavarman VII” which 
includes the essential parts of the 
texts concerning Jayavarman VII written 
by G. Coedés, with whom | collaborat- 
ed throughout, constantly exchanging 
archaeological and philological observ- 
ations. lt also contains texts by 
Paul Mus. To both these scholars, who 
died recently, | wish to pay particular 
tribute for their outstanding work. 
While the Bayon of Angkor was the 
(continued from page 18) 
temple-mountain of Jayavarman VII, it 
is only one of a great number of build- 
ings in the same style. Examples are 
the two great groups of buildings 
dating from the beginning of his reign 
(the date was estimated using the 
method indicated above, and sub- 
sequently confirmed by an inscription): 
the first, Ta Prohm, dedicated by the 
king to his mother and his guru, and 
the second, still larger, Preah Khan at 
Angkor, to his father (the head of Ta 
Som—colour photo page 24— comes 
from the enclosure added by lJaya- 
varman VII to one of his own, smaller, 
monuments). But monuments in the 
Bayon style are very numerous at 
Angkor and even outside the Angkor 
complex. 
B Y far the most remarkable 
site of all, Angkor itself contains 
more than 30 temples; but scattered 
throughout the country there are an 
enormous number of Khmer monu- 
ments, many of which are remarkable 
and some unique in style. Representa- 
tive examples of pre-Angkorian Khmer 
art are the astonishing 7th century 
group of Sambor Prei Kuk and, perhaps 
the most perfect Khmer temple of all, 
the small, delicately detailed, 10th cen- 
tury temple of Banteay Srei. It is a 
constant source of anxiety to us to 
think of the dangers to which they 
are daily exposed, particularly the 
temples at Angkor and the Phnom Penh 
museum, with its unique collection of 
Khmer sculptures, other Khmer temples 
and the Cham monuments in what is 
today Viet-Nam. Many difficulties have 
been surmounted and much patient 
effort devoted to the reconstruction of 
seriously dilapidated monuments, some 
of which have even been restored to 
their original state, yet a monument, 
and the work done on it, could be redu- 
ced in an instant to a heap of rubble. 
These buildings which we have 
studied for so long have become for 
us almost like living friends. 
We implore those involved in the 
present hostilities, whatever their 
convictions, to spare these monuments. 
Most of them were the work of their 
ancestors, a valuable treasure house 
of beauty enriching mankind as a 
whole, which is entrusted to their care. 
They are also a tourist attraction from 
which everyone stands to gain. It is 
our fervent hope that once peace is 
restored {which we all hope for, and 
which must come one day), all these 
beautiful monuments, all these totally 
irreplaceable groups of buildings 
which we love so intensely, will emerge 
unscathed.

—— Letters to the Editor 
NEW 
WMO EMBLEM 
  
  
Sir, 
I have noticed in the August-Septem- 
ber 1971 issue of the “Unesco Courier” 
that you are still using the World Meteo- 
rological Organization emblem which 
was amended by WMO'’s Fifth Congress 
In 1967.

PERILS OF PESTICIDES 
 
Sir, 
The article by Gene Gregory in the 
June 1971 issue of your excellent maga- 
zine tells us that: 
“... some gifted polemicists, with an 
emotional, romantic and mystical bent, 
have effectively managed to persuade 
many people, including some public 
officials, that pesticides—especially 
DDT—are dangerous and should be 
banned. Cantrary to many reports, no 
one has yet been harmed in any way 
by residues of crop protection pro- 
ducts...” 
If this had been written at the end 
of the last war—shortly after the dis- 
covery of DDT—it would have surprised 
no one. But, published in 1971 in a 
magazine concerned with modern world 
affairs, it is, to say the least, a cause 
for some astonishment. 
If the idea of a complete ban on 
pesticides is absurd, it is no less 
absurd to maintain that pesticide resl- 
 
dues have never harmed anyone in 
any way. Over the years, numerous 
examples have shown that the use of 
pesticides has harmful, often unfore- 
seeable, side effects which sometimes 
deeply disturb nature's equilibrium. 
One of the most striking examples is 
the progressive disappearance of cer- 
tain species of birds due to a nse 
in sterility and a drop in the hatching 
rate—a direct result of the use of 
pesticides, 
Unfortunately, such tangible harmful 
effects are not confined to animals, but 
are now being noted in human beings. 
Certain vegetation defoliants, such as 
2-4-5-T, result in genetic malformations 
and defects, and some organo-mercury 
fungicides can cause damage to the 
kidneys and serious disorders of the 
nervous system. 
Many similar examples could be 
given. Should we then ban the use 
of these toxic agents? No, since we 
can use them to control a wide range 
of destructive pests, disease-carrying 
insects and parasites of all kinds. To 
ban them would result in unprecedented 
disasters to crops and orchards and 
the re-appearance of illnesses that 
today have virtually disappeared. 
So it is difficult to draw up an 
accurate balance sheet on the use of 
pesticides, particularly one that takes 
into account long-term effects, many of 
which are still unknown. 
Another article published in the 
August-September 1970 issue of the 
“Unesco Courier” stated: "Minute 
amounts of pesticides such as DDT 
have been found to inhibit photosyn- 
thesis in marine algae by 75 per cent. 
Yet we have dumped an estimated 
1,000 million Ibs of DDT into our envi- 
ronment and are adding some 100 
million lbs per year.” 
This long-term effect upon photosyn- 
thesis is easily the most disquieting 
factor of all. 
What remedies can we adopt? Re- 
search is opening up new possibilities 
of combatting parasites. These solu- 
tions include: the development of a 
rational system of "pest management” 
in place of the systematic (and often 
excessive) use of pesticides; the repla- 
cement of a purely chemical onslaught 
by an integrated attack which would 
include crop rotation and a carefully 
phased use of pesticides; research into 
a biological control of pests by the 
introduction of their natural enemies, 
the use of hormones to attract or repel 
pests and sterilization of the males. 
Indeed, how much easier it would be 
if only pesticides were not dangerous!

STANDING ROOM ONLY 
 
Sir, 
In his article “The Magic of Modern 
Chemistry” (June 1971) Gene Gregory 
assures us that chemistry is now 
supplying and will continue to supply 
mankind with the food, clothing and 
other requirements for its continuing 
life and comfort. Mr. Gregory seems 
to forget that the population of the 
world is growing and that the earth's 
surface Is limited; this means that one 
day there will just be room for all of 
us if we remain standing packed 
together side by side. Can Mr. Gregory 
tell us what chemical processes will 
make life possible under these con- 
ditions? There wouldn't even be room 
for crops, however well fertilized. 
Your author also appears to forget 
that food, medicine, housing, etc. are 
not enough, and he slides very rapidly 
over the problem of pollution and the 
destruction of the world’s beauty spots.

### 54455: Angkor, masterpiece of architecture and town-planning

MASTERPIECE OF TOWN-PLANNING (continued from page 13) 
achievement. The Bayon represented 
an entirely new departure which was 
rich in significance, as it heralded the 
irradiation of the Khmer country by 
the Buddhist faith. 
Such is the moving and impressive 
legacy left by the last of the great 
Khmer Kings. In his time, architecture 
broke through its confines, effaced the 
distinction between building and 
sculpture, and adopted the role of 
mystic diagram, way of initiation, 
giving man the key to the universe 
and the divine world. 
During the 14th century, despite 
the repeated incursions of the war-like 
Thais from across the border, a few 
weak kings succeeded each other on 
the throne of Angkor; but the city 
was abandoned in the mid-15th 
century. The vicissitudes of war and 
the widespread destruction altered the 
rate of flow in the vast hydraulic 
installations of the plain of Angkor. 
The water, which was previously 
clouded with silt, became limpid, and 
fostered malaria. 
The whole Angkorian mechanism, 
which had brought wealth, prosperity 
and power to the Khmers, seemed to 
fall under an evil spell, and ground 
to a halt. Fever and malaria compelled 
the decimated population to desert 
the immense city, now a useless seat 
of pestilence. Pollution had brought 
low a powerful empire. 
Any attempt to assess the achieve- 
ments of the Khmers during their four 
centuries of flourishing civilization at 
Angkor should recall that the rice-field 
and the temple were the two extreme 
links in the same sequence of events 
governing the development of the 
area. Ecology illuminates the forms 
assumed by art. |

to illustrate an article entitled “A Soviet 
Scientist looks at Futurology.” 
In fact, this photograph was originally 
taken to illustrate the use of electronic 
hands and myoelectric devices develop- 
ed specifically at the Rehabilitation 
Institute of Montreal, Canada, and 
particularly to show the various develop- 
ments that have taken place to improve 
the original Russian hand prosthesis 
purchased by the Rehabilitation Institute 
in 1964, 
The original Soviet equipment was 
modified in several respects. On the 
basis of clinical experience, all wiring 
was incorporated in the structure of the 
forearm socket. The reliability and 
convenience of the device were improv- 
ed and the patient's comfort increased. 
A versatile new battery package utilizing 
a flexible plastic enclosure was develop- 
ed. 
The Department of Research of the 
Institute decided to design a new 
control unit. The principal character- 
istics of this unit are a very good 
stability and performance, small dimen- 
sion and negligible weight and it is 
easily accommodated between the walls 
of a laminated plastic arm socket. The 
unit has been used on approximately 
60 patients for the past four years and 
has proved to be reliable. 
The primary purpose of this com- 
munication is to Indicate that the 
prosthesis illustrated in your article is 
not the sole result of the US.S.R. 
efforts. It is the result of improvements 
and research,

Sir,

by Mr. Wayne McEwing on Unesco in 
the August/September 1971 issue of the 
“Unesco Courier” devoted to Unesco's 
25th anniversary. 
| was much impressed by the survey 
carried out by this young Canadian and 
especially by his fresh and lively 
approach and the sincerity of his 
remarks. 
Nevertheless, i regret that Mr. Mc- 
Ewing said nothing about the role of 
the National Commissions in Unesco's 
activities and that consequently the 
uninformed reader might have the 
impression that Unesco consists only 
of a headquarters and Secretariat in 
Paris, and be unaware of the national 
branches of Unesco—the National 
Commissions—which give Unesco a 
strength and originality in the United 
Nations family. 
One further point, it is generally 
accepted that it was Copernicus and 
not Galileo who showed that the earth 
circled the sun,

THE 2000 A. D. PROBLEM 
Sir, 
By the year 2000, 7,000 million people 
will inhabit the globe, yet Gene Gregory 
(June 1971) is calmly counting on 
modern chemistry to solve the problems 
that this will pose. But if mankind 
concentrated its efforts on controlling 
the number of births, none of these 
problems would arise. If the population 
could be maintained at a reasonable 
level, the quality of life would be much 
higher than it will be with the help of 
the chemicals with which we are 
flooded, and which pollute the atmo- 
sphere, water and food. ‘Man, after all, 
is supposed to be an intelligent being? 
Yet thanks to these “miracle” chemical 
products, we are slowly but surely 
destroying the balance of nature, and 
this may one day threaten the very 
existence of life on our planet.

Sir, 
We were immensely gratified to find 
the Menton Statement (“A Message to 
Our 3% Billion Neighbours on Planet

we have not been able to reach all of 
the biologists around the world who 
might wish to add their signatures to the 
statement. Those who would like to 
do so and others who have comments 
or inquiries can send correspondence 
to Dai Dong of the Fellowship of 
Reconciliation at any of the following 
adresses: Glaciset 32, 2800 Lyngby,

THE PUBLIC AND MODERN ART 
Sir, 
The Inquiry by the International 
Council of Museums into public attitudes 
towards modern art ("Unesco Courier”, 
March 1971) was extremely interesting, 
but the results are rather disappointing. 
Putting to a limited, obviously con- 
servative section of the public the blunt 
question, “do you like or dislike 
modern painting?”, was bound to lead 
to one conclusion, namely that the public 
is hostile to modern art because it goes 
against traditional concepts of art. But 
the artist should not merely produce 
works which please and can be under- 
stood by people of average intelligence. 
And surely the inquiry was invalidated 
from the start by a method of presenta- 
tion that could only baffle the public—a 
mixture of unidentified works, old and 
recent, figurative and abstract, famous 
and little-known, sometimes belonging 
to several different periods of the same 
artist, 
Dr. Theodore Heinrich, commenting 
on the results, pointed out that some- 
times a particular style of painting may 
have been familiar to the persons 
polled but not the particular painting 
they were shown. These persons would 
give their preference to famous paint- 
ings even if they were not in fact to 
their taste. We know that if the ordi- 
nary man in the street still rejects 
Mondrian’s works, he nevertheless 
accepts in architecture, painting, fashion 
and theatre, etc., trends which have 
been strongly influenced by the works 
of Mondrian and other often criticized 
artists such as Malevitch, Kandinsky, 
Delaunay, Picasso, etc., which goes to 
prove that the much talked of gap of 
two generations between the artist and 
the public does not in fact exist. 
On the other hand, we may well ask 
whether traditional easel and canvas 
painting is not on the way out, to be 
replaced in the future by mural art and 
a synthesis of the arts. If this 
happens, won't our present conception 
of museums and art galleries be out of 
date? If the public no longer goes 
to see works of art because our 
museums and art galleries do not attract 
them, why don’t we take these works 
out into the streets, the factories, the 
schools and public transport? 
D.!l. Corre 
Chantilly, France 
Dr. Theodore Heinrich (member of 
the Toronto inquiry Committee on public 
attitudes to modern art) replies: 
Our task was to develop and test 
a practical working method that could 
be applied in many parts of the world. 
When that larger study has been done, 
we shall be justified in starting to draw 
conclusions. 
The “blunt” question, "Do you like 
or dislike modern painting?”, was never 
asked. The testing materials, which 
had for fairly obvious reasons to be 
anonymous, continue to serve their 
specific purposes quite adequately. 
The study was undertaken to provide 
the museum profession with data upon 
which to re-evaluate current methods 
of presentation, Interpretation and 
education in modern art. 
Qur method allows for proper pro- 
portional representation of those already 
interested, but for the first time begins 
to represent that large tax-paying public 
which mostly avoids museums of all 
kinds, let alone those dedicated to 
modern art. 
The museum-going public Is not 
diminishing and public appetite for art 
of all periods that it can enjoy and 
understand constantly increases. But 
the evidence collected does show a 
sympathy among this public that de- 
creases in direct ratio with the new- 
ness and difficulty of art. We have 
never suggested that artists or mu- 
seums should tailor their activities to 
meet the approval of the broad public 
(let alone the least common denomi- 
nator), only that museums question 
their own methods in order to reduce 
the clearly existing gap of comprehen- 
sion. 
The sad, cold fact Is that Mon- 
drian’s own pure and beautiful paint- 
ings, for instance, are still “caviar to 
the general” and the reasons for that 
are exactly what we are trylng to 
decipher.   41

Unesco’s 
25th anniversary ceremony 
Ceremonies to mark Unesco’'s 25th 
anniversary are to be held in Paris on 
November 4 and 5, 1971. This issue of 
the “Unesco Courier” goes to press 
before the inaugural ceremony which will 
be opened by M. Attilio Dell'Oro Maini, 
president of the 16th session of Unesco’s 
General Conference. The President of the 
French Republic, M. Georges Pompidou, 
and the Lord High Chancellor of the United 
Kingdom, Lord Hailsham, are expected to 
attend the ceremony as well as Mr. Prem 
Kirpal, president of Unesco's Executive 
Board, M. René Maheu, Director-General 
of Unesco since 1962, and his four pre- 
decessors in this post, Julian Huxley (1946- 
1948), Jaime Torres Bodet (1948-1952), 
Luther Evans (1953-1958) and Vittorino 
Veronese {1958-1961). Ministers and high- 
ranking officials from many countries are 
to attend as well as several former officials 
of the Organization. 
Nag Hammadi bibliography 
Since the first publication, in 1948, of 
information concerning the discovery of 
Coptic gnostic codices in the vicinity of 
Nag Hammadi (see the “Unesco Courier”, 
May, 1971), more than 2,400 items have 
been written about the Nag Hammadi library. 
Details of the literature published between 
1948 and 1963 have now been brought 
together in a single classified bibliography 
compiled by David M. Scholer. In addition 
to works dealing with the Nag Hammadi 
codices themselves, the bibliography in- 
cludes materials on gnosticism in general 
and on certain special topics which provide 
a context for situating the Coptic gnostic 
library.

EVERYDAY LIFE 
IN 12TH CENTURY 
ANGKOR 
FS 8 (29 
= ‘- 3 - 5 § 
Photo © Luc lonesco, Paris 
The temples of Angkor (Khmer Rep.) are considered one of the greatest 
architectural complexes in all Asia. And among the wonders of Angkor, 
the Bayon temple, with its multi-faced towers and sculpted walls 
literally covered with thousands of scenes from everyday life, stands 
out as the acme of Khmer architectural and artistic achievement. Depict- 
ed here are traders, surrounded by their wares, taking a hasty nap as 
they wait for their customers to arrive. (See pages 30-38 for a series of 
exceptional photo-studies of this * diary in stone ). LH Ma TL
