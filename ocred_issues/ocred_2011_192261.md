Editorial 
Irina Bokova 
“To be female in this place is to be an open wound 
that cannot heal. Even if scars form, the festering is 
ever below," wrote Toni Morrison’ in “A Mercy’, 
which to me is one of the most poignant novels 
ever written about being a woman. The lives of 
four women — European, African, Native American 
and a mysterious young girl who comes out of the 
sea — are intermingled, all of them tragic, 
inextricably linked to each other and deeply 
rooted in the soil that would a century later give 
birth to the United States. These four powerful 
female characters stand like caryatids supporting 
the emerging American society. And yet, the 
author says, they are “open wounds”. Is it the 
common fate of women throughout the world to 
be both the pillars and the victims of society? 
Obviously the situation of women has 
undergone considerable evolution. The 
International Council of Women (ICW), founded in 
1888, followed by the International Alliance of 
Women (IAW) in 1904 and the Women 
International Democratic Federation (WIDF) in 
1945, have played a crucial role in the struggle for 
gender equality. 
Gender equality lies at the heart of human 
rights and fundamental freedoms, which are 
essential for the dignity of individuals, for healthy 
societies, and for the rule of law. Second, equality 
between men and women is a powerful 
accelerator of political, social and economic 
transformation. Gender equality is a core 
development issue. It is also a security issue. Girls 
and women suffer disproportionately from armed 
conflict. They are also very often the best 
advocates for reconciliation. Finally, the last 
hundred years have taught us that gender 
equality is everyone's job. Governments are key, 
but so are civil society and business, teachers and 
administrators, cultural personalities and the

media. The international community plays its part 
by setting goals and mobilizing support to reach 
them. 
UNESCO seeks to tighten the link between 
gender and the internationally-agreed 
development goals. We made this case in 2010 
during the 15th anniversary of the Fourth World 
Conference on Women in Beijing. We took it to the 
Millennium Development Goals Summit in New 
York last September. Working with the Republic of 
Korea, we pushed education higher on the 
agenda of the G20 summit in Seoul. | made the 
same argument at the 2011 World Economic 
Forum in Davos. Throughout all of this, we worked 
closely with the United Nations Girls Education 
Initiative and we will continue with the newly- 
created UN Women, led by Michelle Bachelet. 
Gender equality is woven through the work of 
all UNESCO sectors. It has inspired me in 
reforming the Organization itself. It guides our 
activities on the ground — including in difficult 
settings, in Afghanistan and Iraq as well as in 
Pakistan. During my recent visit to the Democratic 
Republic of Congo, | signed an agreement with 
the Government to establish a research and 
documentation Centre on Women, Gender and 
Peace-building. Located in Kinshasa, this UNESCO 
Category 2 Centre will address an issue of vital 
importance for human rights, social stability and 
development for the Great Lakes Region. 
Remembering a visit in the 1980s to 
northwest Zimbabwe, her country of origin, Doris 
Lessing said, “That poor girl trudging through the 
dust, dreaming of an education for her children, 
do we think that we are better than she is - we, 
stuffed full of food, our cupboards full of clothes, 
stifling in our superfluities? | think it is that girl, 
and the women who were talking about books 
and an education when they had not eaten for 
three days, that may yet define us!”

disadvantaged. UNESCO has other ways of 
reaffirming the same faith. Beyond the limits of 
her fiction, the author was reaffirming her faith in 
women, even the most disadvantaged. UNESCO 
has other ways of reaffirming the same faith. To 
empower the world’s poorest girls and women, 
we will launch a new initiative on girls’education 
that will engage official and private sector 
partners This will focus on the innovative use of 
new technologies to expand basic education and 
literacy, on the education of women and girls in 
situations of conflict and natural disasters, and on 
system-wide policy frameworks and teacher 
training. To empower the world’s poorest girls and

women and girls in situations of conflict and

There has been progress. The 2011 Education 
for All Global Monitoring Report shows that 
gender parity has improved in primary enrolment 
since the start of the decade, especially in 
countries that featured the greatest gaps. But 
disparities have increased at the secondary level, 
notably in Africa. And while women are making 
breakthroughs in higher education in all regions, 
they still account for only 29 percent of 
researchers. The share of illiterate women has not 
changed over the last 20 years: women still 
represent two-thirds of the world’s 796 million 
illiterates. 
The French writer Antoine de Saint Exupéry 
once wrote, “If you want to build a ship, don't herd 
people together to collect wood and don't assign 
them tasks and work, but rather teach them to long 
  
for the endless immensity of the sea!” A longing for 
the endless immensity of the sea has guided us 
since 1911. It still inspires us today.

Inequality between men and 
women remains deeply 
rooted in many societies. 
Women are too often denied 
access to education and 
health care, they face 
occupational segregation 
and gender wage gaps, they 
are under-represented in 
decision-making processes 
and they suffer violence. 
Michelle Bachelet takes on 
these challenges as the first 
Executive Director of UN 
Women, the new United 
Nations Entity for Gender 
Equality and the 
Empowerment of Women. 
Can you tell us what inspired you to 
make violence against women one of 
the key priorities of UN Women? And 
what types of violence are women 
subjected to in the world? 
Violence against women is one of the 
most widespread human rights 
violations. It is one of five priority areas 
UN Women will focus on because 
making progress in this area can 
accelerate progress for women across 
many fields. For example, a woman who 
lives free from violence has much better 
prospects to find a good job, seek an 
education, care for her health and act as 
a leader in her community or elsewhere. 
Women face many types of violence. 
Many societies in the world today have 
some elements of this, and the 
prevalence rates can be as high as 76% 
if you look at women across their 
lifetimes. Specific forms of violence 
include domestic violence, rape, sexual 
violence as a weapon of war, early 
marriage and female genital mutilation. 
What other priorities are you planning 
on tackling and how will you mobilize 
the necessary resources to achieve 
your goals? 
We will actively support and look for 
creative ways to empower women 
economically, increase women’s roles as

leaders and advocates of change, bring 
women to the centre of peace and 
security processes, and integrate gender 
equality priorities across national 
planning. Part of mobilizing resources to 
achieve these goals will be to 
demonstrate how much of a 
contribution women make to 
development, not just for themselves, 
but for their societies at large. There is 
growing evidence of this. The most 
recent World Economic Forum Global 
Gender Gap Index Report, for example, 
shows that out of 114 countries, it is 
those with greater gender equality that 
are more competitive and grow faster. 
What human and financial resources 
does UN Women currently have at its 
disposal? Is it gh to achieve your 
mission? 
UN Women inherited the resources of 
the four UN entities that have been 
combined to create it. Building on these 
resources and moving forward, as 
recommended in the Secretary-General’s 
comprehensive proposal of January 
2010, a minimum annual budget of US 
$500 million is foreseen. This is the 
target we will be working towards. 
 
Are you planning to prioritize certain 
countries? If so, which ones, and for 
what reasons? 
We will work with all UN Member States 
that request our assistance, both 
developing and developed countries. UN 
Women currently has varying presence 
in approximately 80 countries and we 
will need to strengthen our exiting 
presence in some countries where there 
is the greatest need. We will be doing this 
over time and as we build our 
institutional capacities and resources. 
Within countries, a priority will be to 
reach the most marginalized groups of 
women. They are the most in need of UN 
Women's support and reaching them can 
make the most effective use of our 
resources. As UNICEF has started to 
demonstrate, investing in the most 
marginalized part of the population 
offers higher rates of return. 
What is the role of gender equality in 
the Millenium Development Goals? 
How do you plan to give it more 
importance? 
Achieving Gender equality — Goal three, 
is fundamental to achieving all of the 
other MDG goals. We will continue to 
advocate on the critical linkage 
between gender equality and all the 
other goals—on poverty, health, 
education, the environment —as we 
move towards the target date of 2015. 
One MDG issue that is particularly 
important is maternal mortality. 
Globally, we have not made nearly 
enough progress. We can—and must— 
do much more. Saving more lives in 
childbirth requires basic knowledge and 
inexpensive tools that could be readily 
available everywhere, if governments 
and the international community 
decide to really make that a priority. 
The number of women elected as 
Heads of State and Government and of 
UN Agencies has been rising in the past 
few years. Has this already had 
positive effects on critical issues 
concerning women around the world? 
If we look back in time, we can see that 
enormous progress has been made over 
the last 100 years. Although challenges 
remain, gender equality has a 
momentum that it has never had before 
at any other point in history. This is true 
both on the international level and in 
most countries. 
This is because women have taken 
leadership roles as advocates for gender 
equality—at many levels, whether in 
communities or as heads of state. 
Women leaders have made sure that a 
growing number of people understand 
that we must bring women fully into 
our economies, we must end violence 
against women, we must tap into 
women’s capacities as agents for 
changes that benefit everyone. And that 
we must bring resources and take the 
actions necessary to achieve these 
goals—as we have now done in part 
through the creation of UN Women as a 
global champion for women. 
  
Michelle Bachelet, who trained as a surgeon, is the first Under-Secretary-General 
and Executive Director of UN Women. The former President of Chile (2006 to 2010) 
was noted for her government's investment in pension reform, social protection 
programmes for women and children, and research and development, despite the 
financial crisis. Other initiatives included tripling the number of free early child-care 
centres for low-income families and the completion of some 3,500 child-care 
centres around the country. On 14 September 2010 when she became chief of the 
new UN agency, Ms Bachelet pledged to make it a “strong champion” for gender 
equality. 
UN Women 
In July 2010, the United Nations General Assembly created UN Women to accelerate 
the Organization's goals on gender equality and the empowerment of women.

Launched officially on 24 February 2011, UN Women merges four parts of the UN 
system: the Division for the Advancement of Women (DAW), International Research and Training Institute for the 
Advancement of Women (INSTRAW), Office of the Special Adviser on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women (OSAGI) 
and the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM). 
UN Women’s main goal is to support inter-governmental bodies and Member States in their formulation of global and 
national policies, standards and norms on gender equality. It can also hold the UN system accountable for its own 
commitments on gender equality, including regular monitoring of system-wide progress.

### 192300: Women political leaders

  
political leaders 
Some of history’s greatest leaders have been women, and yet, female political leaders are 
rare in modern democracies. There have been fewer than 50 female heads of state in 
recent times, and today, only 20 of the world’s 192 countries have women leaders at the 
helm. In politics, progress towards gender parity may be slow but it is inevitable. 
SHIRAZ SIDHVA, USA-based Indian journalist 
While most countries acknowledge that 
the representation of women in 
decision-making structures is crucial for 
change, women are rare at the highest 
levels of decision-making. The Inter- 
Parliamentary Union reports that 
despite increased numbers of women in 
parliaments, with an all-time global high 
of 19.1% in both houses of parliament, 
“the target of gender balance in politics 
is still a distant one in many countries.” 
There have been some remarkable 
stories, however, in the last few decades, 
of women who have managed to 
shatter the highest of glass ceilings, 
surmounting all odds to enter a 
predominantly male bastion. These 
path-breaking women have managed 
to make a difference in their countries, 
while inspiring other women across the 
globe to make sure their voices are 
heard when policies affecting their 
societies are being formulated. 
Women like Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, 
who made history in 2006, when she 
was elected President of Liberia, making 
her the first female head of state in 
Africa. A champion of women's rights, 
the Harvard-educated President said 
throughout her campaign that if she 
won, it would encourage women across 
Africa to seek high political office. The 
devoted grandmother figure who has 
braved prison and exile in her 30-year 
political career, has shown a steely 
determination to install peace in a 
country ravaged by a decade of conflict. 
Johnson Sirleaf was recently 
presented the African Gender Award 
2011, recognizing “Liberia's efforts in the 
enhancement of women’s rights with a 
strong emphasis on girls’ education, 
economic empowerment and 
legislation to curb violence against 
women. “By promoting gender equality 
and empowering our girls, we are also

“lifting Liberia,” President Johnson 
Sirleaf said in a recent speech to women 
graduates who participated in an 
economic empowerment programme. 
Iceland's former President Vigdis 
Finnbogadéttir also stresses the role of 
education in women’s empowerment. 
“My message to the women of the 
world: get educated as much as you 
can, and never accept a shorter 
education than your brother. Skills, 
reading, knowing what life is about, are 
very important. Not everybody can go 
to universities, but if your brothers are 
lorry-drivers, learn something that can 
be compared to that,” she urges. 
President Vigdis, as she is known in 
Iceland, became the world’s first 
independently elected female president 
in 1980.. “I paved the way, not only for 
women, but also for men, in politics. 
Because as soon as a woman succeeds, 
she is paving the way for other women 
and societies around the world," she 
points out. 
Iceland, along with other Nordic 
countries, continues to top the world in 
gender equality, and currently has a 
woman prime minister, Johanna 
Sigurdardéttir, at its helm. But when 
President Vigdis got elected 30 years 
ago, “it was considered so absurd that a 
woman could lead a country. | think my 
Icelanders were so courageous to take 
that step. It was really breaking a 
tradition.” Other women leaders that 
preceded her, including Indira Gandhi of 
India, Isabel Perén of Argentina, and 
Sirimavo Bandaranaike of Sri Lanka, 
came to power as “legacy leaders’, 
taking over from their fathers or 
husbands, while Israel's Golda Meir and 
Britain's Margaret Thatcher were 
nominated by their country’s political 
parties. President Vigdis, who did not 
belong to a political party, was re- 
elected to the Presidency four 
consecutive times (between 1980 and 
1996), making her the world’s longest- 
serving female political leader. “The first 
time, | won by a narrow margin, the 
second time, it was not (narrow) . 
Because then | had proved it was 
possible that | could succeed as a 
woman, and in spite of being a woman! 
When it comes to leadership, does 
gender really matter and does it affect 
leadership qualities? The contexts in 
which these and other women leaders 
have emerged are entirely different, and 
yet, research by political pundits shows

Bhutto, Corazon Aquino and Kazimiera 
Prunskiene, former prime minister of 
Lithuania, to name just a few — resulted 
in a seminal book: Women World 
Leaders: Fifteen Great Politicians Tell 
Their Stories. 
Women’s leadership 
Political scientists have long debated 
the role of gender in leadership. “In 
some cases, gender matters very little, 
explains Michael A. Genovese, Professor 
of Political Science, and Director of the 
Institute for Leadership Studies at 
Loyola Marymount University, 
California. “Margaret Thatcher serves as 
an example of this. In other cases, 
gender matters a good deal. Here, 
Corazon Aquino comes to mind.” 
According to him, itis “better to ask 
when and under what circumstances 
gender becomes more or less important. 
There are built-in structural forces that 
all leaders face, forces which compel 
them to perform certain tasks and 
responsibilities in similar or expected 
ways: ceremonial duties, constitutional 
or legal requirements, role expectations. 
These all bring out more or less common 
responses from both male and female 
leaders. It is in new and unstructured, or 
crisis times that gender can make a great 
deal of difference, situations where there 
are not clear role expectations to fulfill. 
Here, personality and gender differences 
can make a huge difference” 
Not surprisingly, most women 
leaders bring formidable educational 
and professional qualifications to their 
positions. Many of them are authors, 
lawyers, diplomats, and ministers before 
taking on the top job in their countries. 
A majority of claim that, besides 
education, their main inspiration came 
from a strong role model in childhood, 
invariably a father or mother, who made 
them believe that girls were as capable 
as boys when it came to achieving 
things. 
Michelle Bachelet, who was the first 
female president of Chile, and before 
that, the country’s first female Defence 
minister is no stranger to blazing new 
trails. “As a young mother and a 
paediatrician, | experienced the 
struggles of balancing family and career 
and saw how the absence of childcare 
prevented women from paid 
employment,’ she said, addressing a 
crowd in Liberia on International 
Women's Day. “The opportunity to help 
remove these barriers was one of the 
reasons | went into politics. It is why | 
supported policies that extended health 
and childcare services to families and 
prioritized public spending for social 
protection.” 
Do women have different styles of 
leadership that distinguish them from 
men? “It is commonly believed that 
men exhibit more of a command style, 
and women a more collegial style of 
leadership,” explains Genovese, an 
authority on global and national leaders 
and author of 28 books. “While this 
generalization has many exceptions, 
there is something to the distinction. 
Men tell, women talk. Men do 
monologues, women have discussions,’ 
Genovese says. “In terms of different 
issues that might be promoted, it may

come as a surprise that women tend not 
to aggressively promote “women’s 
issues” when in office any more than 
most men. Here differences of ideology 
and partisanship are better indicators of 
support for what are traditionally 
thought of as women’s issues: 
education, welfare support, etc” 
Entrenched prejudice 
Unlike their male counterparts, female 
leaders in today’s democracies are 
compelled to navigate deeply- 
entrenched public prejudices, and are 
judged more harshly than men by the 
media and the people who elect them. 
“There is no glass ceiling, just a thick 
layer of men," insists Liswood. In 1996, 
Liswood co-founded the Council of 
Women World Leaders with President 
Vigdis, and was appointed its secretary 
general. “The urgency lies in preparing 
women now for positions of influence, a 
goal that cannot be achieved without 
role models who are willing to foster 
others in this direction,’ Liswood says, 
and this is where the Council is best 
equipped to step in. 
In 1997, Liswood co-founded The 
White House Project dedicated to 
electing a woman president in the 
United States. “| kept hearing so many 
similar stories,” she says. “Experiences 
were the same, though the leaders were 
from different nations, cultures and 
backgrounds. They seemed to have 
received the same treatment for 
reporters and their readers — they were 
over-scrutinized. The press looked at 
them first as women, excessively 
critiquing their person — their clothes, 
hair, handbags and scarves.” 
“The widespread perception that 
women are not competent leaders is 
probably the strongest barrier to greater 
participation of women in policy- 
making,” says Esther Duflo, professor of 
development economics at the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
(MIT) in the United States. Duflo and her 
colleagues, who co-founded the Abdul 
Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab at MIT, 
have done a series of ground-breaking 
studies in India which show that women 
leaders are evaluated more negatively 
than male leaders, even though they 
tend to provide better services like 
clean drinking water and took 
significantly fewer bribes. 
In an experiment using actors, Duflo 
tested prejudices in hundreds of villages 
in India, where one-third of the seats in 
rural village councils have been 
reserved for women since 1993, a 
proportion recently raised to 50%. The 
villagers were asked to listen to an 
identical political speech—some were 
exposed to speeches read by men, 
others by women. Villagers who had 
never been exposed to a woman leader 
were more likely to judge the female 
speech-readers as incompetent. Voters 
that had actually seen a woman in 
power, however, had no such bias. 
“Exposure reduces prejudices,” 
according to Duflo, whose findings 
show that public policy can influence 
simple voter prejudice. 
Brinda Karat, a member of India’s 
Communist Party of India (Marxist) 
Politbureau and a member of the 
Upper House of Parliament, believes 
that “women leaders do tend to raise 
issues of concern to women more than 
men do!” According to her, the country’s 
decision to reserve 50 per cent of seats 
for women at the “Panchayat” or local 
level, is paying off. “The record of 
women’s participation at the grassroots, 
overcoming social and cultural barriers 
is an inspiring chapter in India’s political 
history and is expanding and 
intensifying every day’, she says. Yet, 
India’s parliament has less than 11% 
women, and in most state assemblies, 
there are even fewer women elected. 
“Does it therefore mean that women 
are not capable or do not have merit on 
their side?” asks Karat, who has worked 
with women’s movements for the last 40 
years. “Clearly this would be an 
outrageous and unacceptable 
conclusion. The truth is that 
discriminatory attitudes and practices in 
the distribution of tickets keep women 
out of elected politics. Just as women 
fight discrimination in economic and 
social spheres, it is necessary to fight 
discrimination in the political sphere. 
Any discrimination on the basis of 
gender weakens democracy. The 
struggle for equal representation is a 
struggle to strengthen democratic and 
citizenship rights.” 
Working their way up 
Women’s empowerment may be slow in 
coming but both Genovese and 
Liswood believe change is inevitable. 
“Things have changed dramatically in 
the past few decades,” Genovese says. 
“When | published my book on women 
12. THE UNESCO COURIER - APRIL-JUNE 2011 
leaders in 1993, | could literally name all 
the women heads of government. Today 
that number has shot up and women 
are more represented throughout the 
government than ever before (yet, still 
below their percentage in the 
population). 
“One of the keys is that today, more 
and more women are serving in the 
entry positions in politics, at the local 
level, working their way up. This means 
that there are more women in the 
“minor leagues” of politics, more women 
in the political pipeline who might earn 
their way up the ladder. The chief cause 
for this change has been first the 
woman's movement, second, that many 
political parties — especially in Europe — 
have quotas for women in campaigns, 
third, support groups that raise money 
for women (e.g. Emily’s List), and finally, 
changes in attitudes in society towards 
women in public life 
“There's no question that things 
have changed,’ says Liswood. “More to 
the point is, have things changed 
quickly enough? In many countries, 
women are coming into colleges, 
getting degrees and entering the 
workforce. But they're seemingly having 
a hard time upgrading to higher-level 
positions. That | think is where we have 
to focus.” 
“There will be a woman president (in 
the United States) in my lifetime,” 
Genovese believes. “Perhaps the main 
reason it is taking so long, apart from 
the already mentioned issues, is that 
major powers, super powers, with 
significant military entanglements 
across the globe, tend to look for men 
who exude a certain toughness that 
suggests the ability to use force and 
even violence when it is deemed 
necessary. Prejudices in this regard still 
plague women, in spite of the fact that 
some of the toughest leaders of the 
post World War ll era have been women 
(Thatcher, Golda Meir, for example). This 
stereotype is very hard to break’ m

The main problem for newly 
independent countries is 
their identity, says Roza 
Otunbayeva, first woman to 
become President of 
Kyrgyzstan. The country’s 
Iron Lady has seen more 
than one crisis come and go 
and has overcome many 
obstacles in the long career 
that brought her to 
leadership in July 2010. On 
the brink of collapse, the 
nation nearly split in two - 
she did not let this happen. 
Reading your biography, we note a 
number of ‘firsts’: first woman Minister 
of Foreign Affairs in Kyrgyzstan, first 
woman Ambassador to the USA and 
then to the UK and, finally, 
Kyrgyzstan’s first woman President. 
What is the secret of your success? 
During Perestroika, when | was Vice- 
President of the Council of Ministers in 
the Republic of Kyrgyzstan, | was invited 
to Moscow, to join the Soviet Union's 
National Commission for UNESCO. | 
started as Executive Secretary, before 
becoming President of the Commission. 
It was no small thing to represent the 
Soviet Union. The country was a 
superpower at the time, and, because 
the USA was not a member of UNESCO, 
we were the main contributor. That is 
how | came to join the Cabinet of the 
Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where, 
incidentally, | was also the first woman. 
When the Soviet Union collapsed, 
Askar Akayev [first president of 
Kyrgyzstan, who was deposed by the 
March 2005 revolution] invited me to 
become Minister for Foreign Affairs. But 
as the USA was very important to us at 
that time, on the same level as the 
World Bank and the International 
Monetary Fund on which we depended,

| was appointed Ambassador to the 
USA, a post | held for two years, before 
returning to Kyrgyzstan as Minister of 
Foreign Affairs. 
It was three years later, in 1997, that 
Askar Akayev became increasingly 
authoritarian. We no longer saw eye-to- 
eye. | spent my time criticising him; he 
got irritated. In the end, | suggested we 
go our separate ways. The idea was not 
to go against him — people still trusted 
him and wanted him to go through with 
his reforms. So | became Kyrgyzstan’s 
first Ambassador to Great Britain. That 
was also a major pioneering effort, with 
members of the UN Security Council. At 
the time, our aim was to put Kyrgyzstan 
on the map. 
In 2005, having united several 
opposition parties, we staged the Tulip 
Revolution. But Kurmanbek Bakiyev' 
usurped our revolution. He took over 
everything and installed a family 
dictatorship. For the next five years, we 
fought for our ideals, in opposition. | 
was head of the opposition in 
parliament. In 2010, finally, we took 
control! 
How do those around you, and 
ordinary people, feel about having a 
woman as Head of State? 
With the respect traditionally given to 
elders, women and mothers. And 
among my colleagues | am probably the 
one with the most experience. After all, | 
deserved this promotion. | have fought 
all the way and made many sacrifices. As 
1. Brought to power by the Tulip Revolution, 
Kurmanbek Bakiyev led the country from 2005 to 
2010. He was relieved of his functions in April 2010 
after a popular uprising in which 87 people died. 
First woman Head of State in Central Asia, 
Roza Otunbayeva was born in 1950. With 
a degree in philosophy from Moscow State 
University and a lecturer early in her career, 
she was soon recruited to the party and 
rapidly climbed the political ladder. She 
played a key role in the overthrow of two 
authoritarian regimes in Kyrgyzstan in 
March 2005 and April 2010.In June 2010 
when a referendum voted in a new 
constitution, the people elected the single 
candidate, Roza Otunbayeva, as president 
of the country. 
  
for the Kyrgyz people, they also know 
that | am not in politics by accident, | am 
not someone's protégé. 
Of course there are some people 
who think that a woman cannot govern 
a country. And to them, | say: the year 
2010 was one of the most critical in the 
history of Kyrgyzstan. We almost 
collapsed as a country and became a 
divided nation. But we managed to save 
everything. We got ourselves out of a 
situation of utter chaos and back onto 
dry land. Even though the rest of the 
world stood by and did nothing. Let 
someone else try to do that! 
The news is full of stories about 
countries in turmoil, like Libya. In 
Kyrgyzstan, those troubles are behind 
us. Our young country still has many 
challenges to overcome, but the worst is 
over. 
Your energy and enthusiasm were 
rewarded this year with the 
International Women of Courage 
award from the US Department of 
State. What does this mean to you? 
| think the award is more for my country 
than for me. The events in the Arab 
world are showing that the whole world 
is beginning to understand that the 
movement of people, countries and 
whole continents towards democracy is 
unstoppable. What we have gone 
through demonstrates that my country 
is not out of step with the evolution of 
the rest of the world. What my country 
and my people have had the courage to 
show is that they are motivated by a 
love of freedom, and their faith in 
progress and democracy. | was just 
caught up in the wake of this

14 - THE UNESCO COURIER - APRIL-JUNE 2011 
Kyrgyzstan has already done a lot for 
women’s equality. There is a 30% 
quota for in parli t. What 
more needs to be done, in your 
opinion? 
Gender equality is a never-ending battle. 
Making quotas part of the law, as we did 
in the last term of office, is not enough. 
These laws are not applied in daily life. 
Today, the National Audit Office, which 
also has a legal quota of 30% women, 
expects three candidates to be 
appointed by the President, three by the 
opposition and three by the coalition. 
The opposition and the coalition only 
put forward men, leaving me to put 
forward the women. This is just pure 
cynicism! 
Women do hold some of our 
important posts, though. Apart from my 
post, which was the product of a 
consensus of political forces, the National 
Bank has a woman president, as do the 
Supreme Court and the Academy of 
Sciences. But, in the government, we 
have just one woman, which is quite 
simply unacceptable. And, in the 
business sector, there is not a single 
woman on the boards of any of our 
major enterprises. 
This is a special year for Kyrgyz 
women. First, because this is the 
bicentenary of the birth of Kurmanjan 
Datka. This woman, who governed Alai, 
in the south, did a great deal to achieve 
the unification of this region and to 
annex it from Russia. She was progressive 
and had prodigious strength and 
determination. She is a figurehead for 
women and for the nation as a whole. 
And second, because my presidency is 
coming to an end. This year will 
undoubtedly see debates over the role of 
women in our country come to a peak. 
What would you say is the main 
priority for the country? 
It is difficult to give a categorical answer 
to this question. But | would say that the 
most acute problem facing newly 
independent countries concerns their 
identity. This is a vast, complex and 
many-layered issue. All of us, all 200-odd 
members of the United Nations, are 
being swept along by the same tide, 
called globalization. Yet the question of 
identity is tormenting every nation and 
every thinking person. This is a serious 
obstacle to development. We are all 
suffering from it and have to find a 
solution. =

commitment 
Interview with MICHAELLE JEAN by Katerina Markelova 
How does a Haitian woman immigrant 
become governor-general of Canada? 
And, to top it all, with responsibilities as 
Head of State and Commander-in-Chief 
of the armed forces! (laughs) | think it’s 
first and foremost a matter of 
commitment. In Haiti | learned 
something very valuable — never remain 
indifferent! In a country where 
indifference has been responsible for 
some terrible problems, my parents 
always encouraged me to look around 
me, to develop a point of view and to 
act. | have inherited my courage, 
perseverance, pragmatism and sense of 
commitment from the women of Haiti. 
When | first arrived in Canada as a 
child, | quickly understood that 
integration meant participation. Very 
early on | started to become involved in 
the women’s movement in Quebec, 
particularly by setting up a network of 
emergency refuges for battered women 
and their children. That set me on the 
path of active and responsible 
citizenship. 
That experience also brought me 
into journalism — 18 years in public 
television! Television journalists often 
find themselves moving into 
entertainment programmes, if they 
have the kind of look that stands out. 
But | was quickly assigned to the news 
service — in a newsroom, anchorwoman, 
head of broadcasting, and in front of the 
cameras.

Canada is the embodiment of 
diversity. For us, diversity is a reality, 
rooted in daily life. And, rather than see 
it as a threat, we see it as a valuable 
asset, despite all the challenges that go 
with it. Whenever | have been the victim 
of discrimination or racism — because no 
society is sheltered from these kinds of 
aberration — | always found plenty of 
people to support me, and resources 
and organisations that would stand up 
and, collectively, say “No! Not in Canada. 
That's not acceptable!”That is why a 
black woman, militant feminist to boot, 
and a former political refugee, was able 
to become Governor-general of Canada. 
What are your priorities as UNESCO 
special envoy for Haiti ? 
First of all, to make sure that we keep in 
mind the state of emergency and 
vulnerability of this country. Haiti was 
on the agenda of all the missions | have 
been on around the world, as Governor 
General of Canada. Whether in the West, 
in Latin America or Africa, | have always 
sensed the desire to be part of a pact of 
solidarity for Haiti. Given that the 
ground has already been prepared, | 
now intend to ask them for support. 
Haiti cannot get out of this alone. It’s a 
disastrous situation! But, at the same 
time, Haiti must also accept its share of 
responsibility. 
| think that the entire world is 
watching what is happening in Haiti. 
How will the international community 
respond? Will the Haitian people — and 
the Haitian state in particular — act 
responsibly? We have to succeed and 
send a message of hope to all of 
humanity. Haiti is beset with 
emergencies and miseries of every kind. 
But it is still possible to act. On one 
condition — to make sure the citizens are 
included. 
| usually say that, in Haiti, life and 
survival both depend on hope. This 
country has always been able to pick 
itself up after being knocked down. It 
triumphed over barbarity through the 
Revolution and escaped slavery by 
enfranchisement. But hope took a real 
body blow with the earthquake. 
We often hear about Haitians’ 
capacity for resilience. But | would prefer

that they were known for their creativity, 
their thinking and what they have to say. 
If we look only at their capacity for 
resilience, we will end up believing that 
these people can carry on waiting, 
because they are so good at holding on 
in the worst circumstances. 
What do you think is the role of women 
in rebuilding Haiti? 
When | went to Haiti in March 2010, | 
deliberately chose 8 March, International 
Women’s Day, to go back. The women of 
Haiti needed to hear someone saying 
that reconstruction would fail unless 
they were involved. It was truly amazing, 
amid this scene of total devastation, 
where it was almost impossible to go 
anywhere, to see 5000 women turn out 
to tell me how much they wanted to see 
life triumph over this disaster. 
The women’s movement in Haiti is 
extremely well organized. Some leading 
women who helped to set up the 
movement across the country lost their 
lives, including some very close friends. 
All of those who survived were in 
mourning. But they were possessed by a 
limitless energy, determined to make 
sure life wins in the end! 
And what part can the diaspora play? 
The diaspora has had to overcome a 
number of challenges, and this is not the 
first time that Haiti has had to face 
difficulties. When the Duvaliers' left, in 
1986, everyone hoped for great things. 
We saw ex-patriots selling up and 
moving back home. Men, women and 
children wanted to contribute to the 
renaissance of Haiti, to the construction 
of a democratic state and to new 
governance. At that time people were 
already speaking of refounding, 
reconstruction, a new start. But it turned 
out to be a minefield. A series of coups 
and the army's straitjacket stifled any 
hope there had been. After a fleeting 
moment of euphoria, life became painful 
for Haitians for a long time. 
When the hurricanes struck in 2008 
[taking the lives of nearly 1000 people], | 
saw a bad sign - the diaspora did not 
respond. Oh, how terrible it was to see 
that! In fact, Haitians living abroad had 
been disappointed by the behaviour of 
1. Francois (“Papa Doc”) Duvalier and his son Jean- 
Claude (“Baby Doc”) Duvalier seized power in Haiti 
from 1957 and 1986, a period characterized by 
corruption, the repression of civil rights and the 
institutionalization of fear. 
their compatriots in the previous years — 
the aid they had been sending home lay 
rotting in containers or was 
appropriated by corrupt officials. 
But the 2010 earthquake touched 
the hearts and minds of everybody! The 
diaspora pulled itself together and

now, people are struggling to join in this 
stage in the country’s development, 
which could be a turning point. People 
have said it before me - this disaster has 
to become an opportunity to act! 
On your visit to Haiti in March 2010, 
you emphasized the importance of 
education. It was during a round table 
discussion in Port-au-Prince that you 
chaired alongside the Director-General 
of UNESCO. What do expect to do in 
this area? 
Haiti is a country where it is possible to 
do a great deal in terms of education. 
Why? Because, in the very fabric of Haiti, 
in its culture, in the Haitian way of 
being, in its history, education has 
always been synonymous with 
emancipation and access to freedom. In 
the plantations, the slaves remained 
illiterate. But there was also another 
category of people -— the children that 
the masters had with their slaves. These 
children were not sent to the 
plantations and were taught to read and 
write. These ‘domestic slaves’ as they 
were called, had access to knowledge. 
Some even went as far to show off their 
talents. And the plantation slaves saw all 
of this. 
Today, when you see little Haitians 
going to school, you cannot imagine the 
dreadful circumstances they are being 
forced to live in! But when they go off to

foundation that bears her name, focused on 
youth and the arts.

are beautiful, they are proud and their 
parents are proud, too. 
All these families, even the poorest, 
bend over backwards to send their 
children to school! So the conditions are 
very favourable. If we invest in 
education, if we help Haiti to build a 
quality public education system, the 
people will immediately take it on board 
as something great and useful. 
At the present moment, there is an 
incredible number of scattered 
educational projects, but there is no 
coordination. | think that UNESCO has 
all the necessary skills to play a 
leadership role in this area and to help 
the Haitian State to create a standard 
framework for schools.

In Mauritania, the question of slavery is closely linked to women because, traditionally, 
slave status was hereditary and passed on by the mother. Since 2007, slavery has been a 
crime under Mauritanian law. But, in practice, it continues in more or less disguised forms 
while the perpetrators escape prosecution. Lawyer Aminetou Mint El Moctar has devoted 
her life to the rights of women, especially single mothers. 
AMINETOU MINT EL MOCTAR answers questions put by Laura Martel, a journalist at RFI 
At 55, you have already spent over four 
decades fighting all forms of 
discrimination, especially against 
women. Where did this militant spirit 
come from? 
Iam a born rebel! The social context and 
my family environment only 
accentuated this aspect of my character. 
| took my first steps as a left-wing 
militant at the age of 11. | was living in 
the southwest of Nouakchott, the capital 
of Mauritania, in a National Democratic 
Movement stronghold. This Marxist 
movement was calling for economic and 
social emancipation, while contesting 
the single-party rule of President Ould 
Daddah. So, | got many of my ideas after 
hearing them in the streets or from 
friends or at school. | read a lot — on the 
resistance of Vietnamese women, the 
Bolshevik revolution and especially the 
Commune. | even got nicknamed 
“Commune de Paris"! This ideal of the 
liberation of the people and equality 
was in radical contrast with the old- 
fashioned ideas and feudal spirit that 
prevailed in my family. We were rich, we 
had slaves, and my father ruled as 
absolute patriarch. He beat me and 
chained me up whenever | stayed out of 
school to join demonstrations or hand 
out leaflets. All that cost me several stays 
in prison, from the age of 12.1 was soon 
let out, because | was young, but the 
worst punishments were handed out at 
home. That only served to turn my 
spontaneous commitment into 
unshakeable convictions. Since then | 
have been fighting relentlessly for 
equality between men and women, for 
an end to slavery and for human rights. 
In Mauritania, slavery has been replaced by domestic 
service, deplores Aminetou Mint El Moctar. She is 
particularly concerned by the plight of underage 
girls. mineures. © UN Photo/Jean-Pierre Laffont

### 192305: Crime without punishment

Your commitment goes back a long 
way, but you have only recently set up 
your Single Mothers Association 
(AFCF). What sparked that? 
For years | have been a member of a 
number of organizations, like the 
Comité de solidarité aux veuves 
[Solidarity with Widows Committee] or 
SOS Esclaves (SOS Slaves). In 1999, | was 
present at the trial of a woman who had 
secretly married the head of a company 
and was fighting for their two children 
to have a share of their deceased 
father’s inheritance. The court refused to 
recognise his paternity. Hearing this 
verdict literally struck her down and she 
died on the way to hospital. With no 
husband, and so no money, no 
education, and therefore no chance of 
finding work, she knew that she and her 
children would find themselves in the 
street. She died because she was unable 
to claim her rights. It was then that | 
realised it was time to fight for these 
abandoned women, so | set up the 
Association. Today, the AFCF has over 
10,000 members and employs 62 
people. Our staff and running costs are 
all paid out of members’ subscriptions, 
while our projects are funded by donor 
agencies. 
Mauritanian society is multicultural, 
with two main ethnic strands - Arab 
Berbers and black Africans. Do women 
have the same status in both 
communities? 
Women traditionally have the same 
function in both communities — they are 
“made for marriage and to satisfy the 
desire of men”, but that translates 
differently in daily life. The constraints 
aren't the same. For black Africans, a 
good wife pays her way essentially with 
household duties, educating the 
children and satisfying her husband. If 
she does earn money, she generally has 
to hand it over to the “master of the 
household”. Most Arab-Berber women 
escape household chores. This is not 
just because their families are generally 
better off, but also because a woman 
has to be “preserved” to make the best 
possible marriage. Pampering her and 
feeding her up are an investment. 
Family honour depends on girls 
marrying young — “she was married 
young” being an adage frequently used 
by griots as a form of praise. The 
nomadic tradition allows more freedom 
to Arab-Berber women than their black 
African sisters, in terms of what they can 
and cannot do. And Arab-Berber 
Mauritanian women have a traditional 
concept of divorce that is quite unusual. 
Not only is it acceptable, but it can even 
give a woman added value! A woman 
who has been divorced several times is 
considered very sought-after. |, myself, 
have three children from different 
fathers and have been married 5, 6 or 7 
times... but now it’s finished! (laughs). 
But, for black Africans, divorce is, on the 
contrary, frowned upon, and they are 
more likely to practice polygamy than 
Arab-Berbers, although the current 
obscurantist trend means a resurgence 
of this tradition for them too. These are 
all, of course, generalisations, for which 
there are many exceptions. 
Force-feeding, child marriage, 
excision, slavery, domestic service... 
the list of human rights breaches is a 
long one. What is your priority? 
The most urgent task is to establish a 
legal basis for equality between men 
and women. For centuries jurisprudence 
has mixed up religious imperatives and 
tradition to create a cocktail of 
discrimination. In Mauritania, a woman 
has a legal guardian for her entire life. It 
might be her father, her husband or 
even her son. She has no rights of her 
own. Let us take marriage as an 
example. According to the civil code, 
er , 
  
18 - THE UNESCO COURIER - APRIL-JUNE 2011 
the legal age for marriage is 18 years, 
but with the guardian's consent, it may 
be celebrated earlier. This, in a way, 
legalises childhood marriages and 
deprives women of the power to decide. 
That was how, one day, when | came 
home from school, | discovered | had 
been married to a friend of my father. | 
was 13 years old. 
Also, when inheritances are divided 
up, two-thirds go to the boys, one third 
to the girls, while only the husband can 
initiate a divorce. Mauritania signed the 
Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Discrimination against Women 
(CEDAW), but added two reservations, 
precisely on divorce and inheritance. 
AFCF is currently campaigning to get 
these two reservations lifted. It is by 
inscribing equality between men and 
women in the law that we will acquire 
the weapons to combat concrete acts of 
discrimination, even if this is just the 
first step because many laws are not 
applied. 
This is particularly true of the 2007 law 
that makes slavery a criminal offence. 
You often point out that no one has 
been convicted since this law was 
& Down through the centuries, religious imperatives 
and ancestral customs have been combined to justify 
discrimination against women in Mauritania, says

passed. Does this mean that there are 
no more slaves in Mauritania? 
It's difficult to quantify because the 
subject is taboo. Nevertheless, we know 
that slavery still goes on, because we 
regularly pick up victims. Along with 
other associations, AFCF has denounced 
cases of slavery to the authorities on 
several occasions, but so far, no action 
has been taken and no one has been 
convicted. The “masters” are people with 
high positions and are protected. 
The question of slavery is intimately 
linked to women, since, according to 
tradition, it is hereditary and passed 
down through the mother. That means 
it is more advantageous for a “master” to 
have female slaves, because he can then 
appropriate their offspring. Even so, this 
traditional form of slavery, where 
individuals are the property of a master 
from one generation to the next, is on 
the decline. Unfortunately it is being 
replaced by a more ‘modern’ form of 
slavery — domestic service. Poor families 
place their daughters with rich families, 
where they often receive only board 
and lodging. These girls, who are usually 
very young, receive no education and it 
is not uncommon for them to be 
beaten. There are many of them in 
Nouakchott. They mostly come from 
rural areas of the country, but also from 
neighbouring states like Senegal, Mali 
or Gambia. In 2009, with the 
international human rights 
organization, Terre des Hommes, we 
launched a programme that enabled us 
to help 2200 minors. 
One day, when | came home 
from school, | discovered | had 
been married to a friend of my 
father. | was 13 years old 
Do you see Mauritania as a hub for 
trafficking children? 
This form of traffic has existed for a long 
time, but has grown over the past few 
years. The traffickers seek out children in 
poor families in rural areas, promising 
their parents that they will find their 
girls work, or a religious pilgrimage, a 
favourable marriage, a sum of money, 
etc. The girls transit through 
Nouakchott, before being taken to the 
Gulf, where they are sold and married. If 
they are black, their skin is lightened. 
Once they reach the age of 18 or 20, 
their husbands throw them out into the 
street, because they are no longer young 
enough for their taste; most then fall 
into prostitution. If they are still minors, 
they may be deported. Three years ago | 
met 14 girls at the airport, all about 15 
years old, who had lived through this 
ordeal and did not know where to go. 
The prostitution ring also extends out to 
Europe. AFCF is currently looking for 
funding for a survey to determine the 
extent of this phenomenon. 
Are there any areas where you can see 
progress ? 
Excision! Even though it is disappearing 
very slowly, this practice is beginning to 
be abandoned collectively, mostly as a 
result of a number of agreements and 
action by donor organizations, which 
have been providing substantial 
funding, as well as the commitment of 
some highly placed religious figures. A 
fatwa [religious law] was signed against 
excision in 2010. The police and the 
judiciary have also been made more 
aware of the issues, but once again, 
there have been virtually no convictions. 
Force —feeding is also on the decline, 
mostly because of a gradual change in 
concepts of beauty. But over 20% of 
Mauritanian girls jeopardize their health 
to put on weight, even if the traditional 
methods have nowadays been replaced 
by food supplements, often with 
dangerous side effects. 
And then there is political 
representation, where we made clear 
gains between 2005 and 2007, 
particularly with the establishment of a 
20% quota for women in elected 
institutions. Today, we do have a female 
Minister of foreign affairs, but the 
number of senior positions held by 
women (such as Secretary of state, 
police chief, governor) has been falling 
since 2008. Symbolically, the Ministry for 
the Advancement of Women has once 
again been merged within the Ministry 
of Social Affairs. Meanwhile, Mauritania, 
like some other countries, is under 
pressure from right-wing factions that 
want to reassign women to a more 
primitive role. 
What do you recommend women 
should do to defend their rights? 
Traditionally, women do not follow any 
in-depth religious instruction, learning 
“just what is needed to pray”. But a 
better understanding of religion would 
enable them to free themselves from 
certain practices. They would know, for 
example, that the Koran does not 
impose excision and polygamy. | also 
think that religions, including Islam, have 
to adapt to the modern world — we 
should be lobbying religious scholars for 
a’‘modern’ exegesis of the scriptures. 
In Mauritania there is a majority of 
women — some 52% of the population. 
There is, then, the potential to develop a 
female elite, able to overcome racial and 
ideological schisms. AFCF, in 
collaboration with the American 
NGOWomen'’s Learning Partnership 
trains 100 women each year in 
leadership skills. Politics is one means 
towards our ends, but it may not 
necessarily be the best, because many 
women, once in power, look after their 
own interests first. What is needed is 
collective awareness of the issues. It is 
starting. 
Why did you not go into politics? 
Because | prefer to work at grassroots 
level, with the victims. It is by getting 
women into the streets that we will gain 
most power. | know that it is a slow 
process, but | do get the feeling we are 
at a turning point — the efforts of our 
Association were rewarded with France's 
Human Rights Prize in 2007, and the 
Heroes Acting To End Modern-Day 
Slavery Award from the US Department 
of State in 2010. This encourages more 
international organizations to fund our 
projects.

### 192306: Mama Maggy and her 20000 children: a meeting with Maggy Barankitse

  
  and he children 
A meeting with Maggy Barankitse 
JASMINA SOPOVA 
Maggy Barankitse was 37 when the civil 
war broke out in Burundi, one of the 
smallest and poorest countries in the 
African continent. From 1993 to the first 
years of the millennium, the conflict 
between Tutsis and Hutus saw over 
200,000 people lose their lives, but hers 
was spared, and she saved thousands of 
children in her home region of Ruyigi, 
near to the border with Tanzania, as well 
as across the entire country. “Today | am 
the happiest mother in the world — | 
have 20,000 children,” she says, with a 
radiant smile. “We have raised the 
children of a generation of fratricide and 
created a new generation. We made no 
distinction between the children of 
victims and the children of criminals — 
they were all just children who needed 
to be loved and comforted. Three 
quarters of my colleagues today — 
doctors, psychologists, economists, 
nurses, teachers — were Tutsi and Hutu 
children who grew up in the Maison 
Shalom.” 
One shouldn't think of this house as 
having four walls and a roof. For 17 
years, “Mama Maggy” used different 
places that were lent or given to her to 
house the war orphans, before creating 
three large centres. “But | realized, she 
admits, “that children who grow up in 
orphanages lose their sense of 
her house. First she took a wheelbarrow. She carried and responsibility. So | closed down the 
orphanages and opened a series of 
outreach centres for the association. | 
murdered in front of her, mostly refugees in the diocese built 3000 little houses across the 
country where siblings could live

look for children who had survived. “Some of them had no families. | compare this house to a boat,

### 192306: Mama Maggy and her 20000 children: a meeting with Maggy Barankitse

  
  
“Men and women have enough love in 
their hearts to say ‘no’ to doom, no to 
fratricidal hate, insists this woman, who 
held a‘democratic poll’ of the children 
when they were looking for a name for 
the association. “It was the children who 
gave their house the name Shalom. Itis a 
Hebrew word, but has become universal, 
as it means ‘peace!The little Muslim 
children also raised their hands when it 
came to the vote! 
Over the years she built the children 
a centre for vocational training — 
teaching plumbing, carpentry, 
agriculture, animal husbandry and 
dressmaking. But her greatest pride and 
joy is the hospital she founded in Ruyigi, 
with a mother and baby unit.“ opened a 
large hospital because, that way, | will no 
longer have to repair all the damage. |

had lost their mothers while they were 
still in nappies. No-one in the world can 
replace the tenderness of a mother. No 
institution, no centre can stand in for a 
mother. | built a beautiful maternity 
centre and started a nursing school. | 
knocked on every door to get hold of an 
ambulance. And then | went to see 
mothers in the villages to tell them they 
could call us if ever a mother was in 
need! 
For those who are HIV positive or are 
suffering from AIDS, Maggy Barankitse 
opened a special centre where they can 
not only be fed, cared for and treated 
with antivirals, but also get advice. “They 
learn how to organize themselves 
through associations and set up little co- 
operatives. Look at this...” she says, 
pointing to the beautiful red dress she is 
wearing as she talks to us, “they made it! 
The main thing is not to help these 
women, but to help them help 
themselves.” 
It is difficult to put figures to the work 
of Maison Shalom. “As we work across 
the entire country, | cannot tell you how 
many people we have supported. The 
schools are for all the children living in 
the communities where we built them. 
The libraries and cinemas we set up are 
open to everyone!’ 
Today, the association employs 220 
people, without counting the volunteers, 
and receives support from over 40 
charities, institutions and governments. 
Maggy Barankitse is very convincing, 
even though she does not hold back 
from criticising certain forms of 
behaviour — or perhaps it is because of

this. While UNICEF is one of the friends 
of Maison Shalom, she is outraged at 
the hundreds of plastic schools bearing 
the name UNICEF, dotted all over the 
country. “Rather than send us plastic 
manufactured in western factories that 
is toxic for the children, why not help us 
to buy straw, which is much better 
adapted to our climate, so that we can 
help build our own schools and earn 
money at the same time, to pay for our 
children’s education?”

And to conclude the chapter of

United Nations agencies to take a good 
look at themselves. They should stop

### 192307: Afraid of nothing

SULTANA KAMAL was interviewed 
by Anbarasan Ethirajan, Indian 
journalist for the BBC in 
Bangladesh    
Women may hold top political posts in Bangladesh, yet discrimination because of gender 
is institutionalized, says women’s rights activist Sultana Kamal. In this country that claims 
to be secular but where Islam remains the state religion, the rise of fundamentalism and 
disruptions in the democratic process are having a direct impact on women’s status. 
Bangladesh will be celebrating its 40th 
anniversary of liberation this year. 
How has life changed for women over 
these decades? 
Lots of things have changed in the last 
40 years. To begin with, generally 
women are much more conscious of 
their rights now. They are much 
stronger on demanding their rights and 
also very vocal on the political and 
social scene. 
Of course it is not the same 
everywhere in the country, and it could 
have been much better, if not for the 
interruptions in the democratic process 
or the rise of fundamentalism. But in 
22 THE UNESCO COURIER 
general, the people have never ever 
endorsed the orthodox type of religion. 
That is why women always benefited 
from a very liberal atmosphere that 
gave them the leverage to debate and 
to take part in lots of things. 
The prime minister of Bangladesh, 
Sheikh Hasina, and the opposition 
leader, Khaleda Zia, are women, which 
is quite unusual for a Muslim majority 
country. 
| like the way you put the question — you 
think it is very unusual for a Muslim 
majority country. Yes, Bangladesh is a 
Muslim majority country but we do not 
APRIL-JUNE 2011 
call ourselves a Muslim country. Itis a 
country where people of many religions 
live, many cultures are alive in 
Bangladesh and very well loved and 
respected. But we have to be very honest 
about the women we see at the top. They 
are not there because they are women or 
because they have come through a 
process which has actually supported 
women's emancipation. They are there 
because they bear a legacy. 
| would be very honest here - when 
we vote for Sheikh Hasina, we in fact vote 
for her late father Sheikh Mujibur 
Rahman, the first president of the 
country. When we vote for Khaleda Zia

we vote for her late husband, General 
Ziaur Rahman, the former military 
dictator. People still bear the images of 
these two very well known leaders. 
But then again the very fact that the 
two women are there, running the 
country and really taking control of 
situations, gives other women a sense of 
confidence, a belief that women can do it. 
Which identity is dominant in 
Bangladesh? Bangladeshi identity or 
Islamic identity? 
Many people wonder whether they are 
Muslim or Bangladeshi first. This struggle 
has its roots in the Pakistani period. The 
main challenge to the people of East 
Pakistan from the Pakistani military rulers 
was that you had to prove you were a 
loyal Pakistani. You had to prove you were 
a true Muslim. They actually merged two 
identities together. 
But people in Bangladesh generally 
believe that we can have multiple 
identities. Yes, | am a Muslim or born to a 
Muslim family, | am also a Bangladeshi, a 
woman, a human rights activist. lam 
known by many different names. So 
likewise, there will be Hindus and 
Christians who will have multiple 
identities. The people of Bangladesh 
basically believe in pluralism, they believe 
in Sufism. Their way of relating to nature, 
to God, to whatever mysteries of life, is 
dependent on their own perception of 
self and nature. 
People’s love of Bangladesh is mixed 
with love of the rivers, trees and nature. It 
is very much related to the basic harmony 
that they want to see everywhere. It is not 
a confrontational culture, but one was 
created artificially, constantly supported 
by forces in the society that have been 
able to capture power and influence 
through the economic system, 
educational system and cultural inputs. 
Have Islamist fundamentalist forces 
changed social and cultural life within 
Bangladesh? 
The fundamentalists have captured the 
main sectors of the society, like banking, 
insurance, medical and education. And 
the worst influence is on education 
because they have changed all the 
curricula, they have changed all kinds of 
information methods in the country. 
People must accept the lessons they 
teach or surrender to what they think is 
the correct path of religion. 
They get into power or stay in power 
by using the tool of fear. Whatever 
degradation in society we see in 
Bangladesh was because they used 
weapons. They use religious dogma, 
which tell us you cannot question 
anything, so it is absolute surrender or 
nothing. It's a question of faith, nothing 
else. 
They are using freedom of 
expression, democratic opportunities, to 
give religious orders. They keep saying 
we want the head of this person or this 
individual should be hanged because he 
is a traitor, whatever this person has said 
is sacrilegious. These tactics scare 
people. But you also notice that not 
many people actually support all these 
efforts. They talk against them and make 
their opinions known as soon as they 
know there will be not be any 
repercussion or retaliation by the 
fundamentalist forces. But there are 
other forces in the society which support 
them, give them courage and will 
protect them when they are at risk and 
that is what happens each time we have 
an election. 
There have been a number of court 
rulings in recent years that no woman 
should be forced to wear a burqa. But if 
you go outside the capital people are 
still wearing traditional Islamic dress. 
We have to remember women in rural 
areas have little means of supporting 
themselves economically or socially. All 
these people probably belong to the 
lower middle class or poor sections of 
the society, so their struggle is very 
basic. They are using these tactics to at 
least get out of the house. As they tell us, 
‘Unless | wear a burga, my family will not 
allow me to go out! So, only to go to 
school, or work or a meeting, they have 
to use the burga. 
How does it happen? In the rural 
areas the men are also denied 
opportunities and bullied by the social 
leaders. Unfortunately, the social leaders 
are also connected to religious hierarchy 
and push the men to control their 
women in that way. And since for many 
years this country was ruled by the 
generals who had a very strong alliance 
with the religious forces, all these things 
were promoted, deliberately nurtured 
and protected by the state. That is why it 
will not be so easy for all women to 
refuse from one day to the next to wear 
the burga. 
You see many more burgas now in 
Bangladesh than we saw in the Pakistani 
time. This is an outcome of disruptions 
in the democratic system where people 
were forced to surrender to certain 
powers, to be silenced so that they do 
not revive the spirit of the liberation war 
of 1971. There was a direct conflict 
between hard line groups opposed to 
our independence and the powers that 
actually fought for the liberation of 
Bangladesh.

### 192307: Afraid of nothing

Let’s talk about another major issue, 
attacks on women that include 
throwing acid on them and sexual 
harassment of young girls, which lead 
to suicide in many cases. Can these 
practices be controlled only by 
enacting law? 
It is a social problem and it has to be 
dealt with by social forces. We should 
create an atmosphere where women 
will get enough confidence that they 
can fight it. Also, the state, the society 
and the families will have to be involved 
in protecting women. We need to 
explain this to the families. We have to 
make it clear that women have equal 
rights and dignity in the country and 
that has to be maintained. There cannot 
be any compromise there. There has to 
be a social movement about it. But then 
laws are also helpful because they give 
you a kind of a power and confidence 
that you can also fight these legally. 
Gender bias and prejudice against 
women - is it institutionalised in 
Bangladesh? 
| would say yes, if you look at the 
personal laws that exist in the country. 
According to these laws, people are 
governed by their religious laws and 
those are very clearly discriminating 
against women. But the state is not 
doing anything about it. We have been 
demanding since 1972 that there 
should be a uniform civil code or family 
code for everybody. The government is 
not able to do anything about that and

we still have a very confused view of 
what is positive discrimination, what is 
equity, what is an affirmative action? So 
there is a lot of resistance within the 
society reflected in the state policies. 
There is controversy over how 
Bangladesh is treating the Rohingya 
ethnic refugees from neighbouring 
Myanmar. What's your view on this? 
One impression | have is that these 
people are also being used by 
supporters of fundamentalist forces in 
Bangladesh. That's one thing. The other 
problem as | heard from our foreign 
minister is economic. The minute you 
recognize them as refugees and you 
start dealing with them according to the 
treaties, it represents an economic 
burden Bangladesh is not prepared for. 
Population is another problem. 
Bangladesh is not being able to deal 
with such a huge population. 
On the other hand, as a human 
rights activist | would like to say yes, all 
these problems are there. But there 
should be a decent way of dealing with 
them. | strongly feel that these people 
also have certain rights and those rights 
should be respected. 
Tell us about yourself. What prompted 
you to become a women’s rights 
activist? 
| was brought up among people who 
were social activists, political activists. 
My parents were deeply involved in the 
anti-British movement. Then my mother 
became the pioneer of the women’s 
movement in Bangladesh. She took a 
leading role in the language movement 
  
and also in the 1950s and 1960s cultural 
movements. 
| got involved in public life during 
the country’s liberation war. | was in 
India for some months during the nine- 
month war. With my sister, | setup a 
hospital for the wounded freedom 
fighters. Before then | was engaged in 
helping people with information, 
shelter, assisting them to cross the 
border. 
After our liberation in 1971, | started 
working with women affected by the 
war, because many came to my mother 
with a lot of problems. A number of 
women had lost their husbands and had 
difficulties with their in-laws. Many 
women wanted to remarry and keep 
their children. That is how | became 
interested in law and became a lawyer. | 
felt | could be useful to those people, to 
help them realise they do have rights 
and they can live with dignity. 
You were threatened on many 
occasions and there were attempts on 
your life. Did you ever feel you were 
ready to quit? 
Not really, because | learnt from my 
parents that the minute you quit, that is 
half the defeat. Why let others feel that 
they have won and abandon the causes 
you are fighting for? That is the strength 
of life: you will only lose your life once. 
The fundamentalists did not approve 
of my marriage to a Hindu, or to the 
people that | associated with, so they set 
fire to my house in 1995. We almost died. 
Later they threw a bomb. But | never 
worried about my own well-being or my 
own life. Yes, | have responsibility 
towards my husband and my daughter. 
They have a claim on my life. But the way 
| was brought up and the way | started 
understanding the issues of life taught 
me that you should never be afraid. 
Being afraid is not the solution. =

### 192308: A Lawyer with a thick skin

A lawyer 
with a 
      
Interview with ASMA JAHANGIR by Irina Zoubenko-Laplante 
You have spent your whole life 
defending human rights. What 
inspired you to become a human rights 
lawyer? 
| was brought up in a politically active 
family. My father, Malik Jilani, was a 
political leader who had always been in 
the opposition and suffered all his life. | 
saw how you had to go to court even 
when you realize you are not going to 
get any justice. Day after day | 
understood the important work of 
lawyers. 
In the early 1980s, you set up an 
NGO, the AGHS Legal Aid Cell, run 
exclusively by women. 
Having finished my law studies and 
obtained an LLB degree in law from 
Punjab University, | realized that | was 
not going to get a chamber to take me 
in. To have one’s own firm appeared to 
be the best solution. | worked this out 
with two friends and my sister, Hina 
JilaniThis was the time of absolute 
oppression against women and side by 
side the women’s movement was 
coming along. There was also a lawyers’ 
movement. So we ended up being in 
the centre of both movements. Our 
activism started rather quickly. 
What challenges did you face as a 
h rights defender? 
In the last five or six years, | have been 
honoured with signs of recognition 
internationally and also in my own 
country. But if you ask people today 
who do not believe that human rights 
are universal, they will say that lam a 
Westernized woman - though | never 
studied or lived abroad; that | am anti- 
religion - because | believe people must 
have a right to have or not to have a 
religion; and that | am anti-Pakistan - 
because | believe Pakistan must live in 
peace with its neighbours... 
But | also come from a society that is 
full of dichotomy. You have violence 
against women, women are looked 
down upon, and yet Pakistan did 
produce a very courageous woman, 
Benazir Bhutto, to be the first woman 
Prime Minister in a Muslim country. We 
have people like me who are under 
threat but also people who would stand 
by me, protect and encourage me. So | 
have learned a lot and | have a lot to be 
thankful for. 
As an activist, | have noticed three 
things: you have to be thick-skinned; 
you have to persevere; and you have to 
constantly look for more solutions. 
I recall when | started to work with 
bonded labour workers — that is, slave 
type practices. The judge would ask 
them Do you recognize her, is she your 
lawyer?’ Those workers were so scared 
they would say no. And | risked having 
my license taken away because my own 
clients said they had not engaged me. 
But | had to persist because then the 
litigant begins to have faith in you and 
finally begins to speak. And that was 
how the case of a woman bonded 
labourer was taken up to the Supreme 
Court and when that woman's employer 
accused her of lying, she put her hand 
on her hip and said “Who is a liar - you

or me? | will tell this court you are not 
only a liar but an exploiter too." That day 
| thought the case was won! Today 
bonded labour has not been completely 
discontinued but a large number of 
people have won freedom. 
We have to have a thick skin too. | 
remember in 1983 when in the name of 
Islam a law was proposed that the value 
of a woman's testimony would be half 
that of a man’s. Many of us, mostly 
upper class women, not realizing where 
we were going, came into the street and 
were suddenly beaten by the police, our 
hair pulled out. Eventually a mullah 
declared in the mosque that our 
marriages were dissolved and our 
husbands had to divorce us - actually 
none of them did. It was difficult but it 
gave us courage - not only to those 150 
women in the streets and beaten by the 
police but to a much larger number. 
Since then we continued to multiply the 
number of activists. 
When | was in danger, one of my 
children said to me “Mother, if you do 
not fight for women’s rights, they will 
come only a minute later than they are 
supposed to come.” But | think it is that 
one minute that human rights activists 
work for. 
What in particular made you 
concerned about the situation of 
women? 
When | started as a lawyer many women 
were put in prison because of a new 
law: any sex outside marriage was 
considered a crime - as it is still 
regarded today but in a diluted form. 
Even women who were victims of rape 
but could not prove it were put in 
prison. And whenever | went to court, 
the judge would say: “Don’t you get any 
other clients except these delinquent 
women?” And | would reply: “My Lord, 
the law is more delinquent to put them 
behind bars!” 
Women do face huge problems in 
many countries, including mine, starting 
with security of life. Women are 
expected to behave in a certain way, 
and if they don't, they are sometimes 
killed, which is known as “honour 
26 - THE UNESCO COURIER - APRIL-JUNE 2011 
killings” When I first raised this question, 
some judges said they did not see what 
| was talking about. Gradually our 
movement against honour killings took 
root not only in Pakistan but got the 
attention of people and organizations 
across the world. We now have a lot of 
support against this practice, whereas 
only a few decades ago politicians were 
saying they could not support people 
who were talking against honour 
killings, because it was against accepted 
social norms. Now those politicians are 
ashamed of having said that. 
What can be done to accelerate 
positive change for women? 
First, advance women’s economic rights, 
which are very much missing in many 
countries. Women do not have the same 
status as men; even when they are 
working, they do not get equal pay. And 
violence against women is rampant. We 
have to start is by making women 
themselves more aware, which has 
increased tremendously. And secondly 
itis necessary to sensitize organizations

and institutions like the judiciary, the 
parliament, the media, in favour of 
women’s rights. We have made some 
advances but not enough. 
Will we be able to meet the UN 
Millennium Development Goals, in 
particular to reduce poverty through 
promoting gender equality? 
| think we should commend the 
aspiration of the United Nations but 
obviously these are not going to be met 
by the anticipated 2015 deadline. That 
does not mean that we have to give up. 
| think the question of children and 
poverty is particularly acute today. 
Children in marginalized sections of our 
societies, children who have been 
abused for sex, for pornography, 
children who are often now abused for 
beggary, children who have been sold, 
they, | believe, are the first victims of 
poverty. 
Based on your experience as UN 
Special Rapporteur on Freedom of 
Religion or Belief, what do you think 
about human capacities for tolerance? 
This very delicate and intellectually 
challenging mandate taught me many 
things. For example, there is no country 
in the world where prejudices do not 
exist and at the same time there is no 
country in the world where people are 
not fighting intolerance. But this must 
be recognized in the echelons of power 
that should be establishing policies to 
eliminate intolerance. Education is 
particularly important but it depends on 
what kind. In our own part of the world 
people have been radicalized and 
militarized in the name of education. We 
want quality education, not only 
through textbooks but through 
interaction of children from diverse 
communities. Education should 
inculcate a genuine respect for human 
dignity and not just teach taboos. For 
example, | do not see that children are 
taught to that people may dress 
differently, a man may be dressed as a 
girl but that does not mean that you 
should look down on them. A woman 
may cover her head but it does not 
mean she is different in her thinking. | 
do not see that in any educational 
books — West or East. 
There are countries, often because 
of conflict, that get blocked inside and 
there is no cross-border interaction, 
which is very important. At the same 
time, | believe the world must remain 
diverse, with different ideologies also. 
But we have to underline there are 
some red lines people must not cross. | 
cannot expect you to think like me at 
the point of a gun, | can persuade you 
within the limits, not through abuse or 
threat. If | begin to do that, it is clearly 
intolerance. And if | make discriminating 
legislation, it is clearly intolerance. And 
to give the justification of legislation 
being based on your own social and 
religious norms is something 
governments will have to rethink. It is 
an insult to your own people to say they 
have less dignity than others in this 
world. The question of dignity is 
therefore everywhere. 
Human rights defender work is not 
easy. In my own country, we have 
conflict and Islamic militants killing 
people. Even they have rights. But when 
we human rights defenders have to talk 
about their rights, people wonder 
whether we are not Taliban supporters. 
Of course not, but even ifaman isa 
suspected Taliban, you cannot make 
him disappear. 
What is the role of a State in ensuring a 
society's progress? 
| think the State is the last to come on 
board. It is the time of civil society, in 
particular of activists’ groups and 
movements such as we can see at 
present in the Latin America, in the mass 
media. It is they who have carried out 
campaigns and taken up vital issues. For 
example, civil society and activist groups 
in the West were the first to talk about 
arbitrary detentions after the September 
11th terrorist attacks. This movement 
received an input from lawyers, from 
human rights defenders, from students, 
so all this is the combination of civil 
society actors. 
How are democracy and human rights 
linked? 
You cannot have human rights flourish 
in a country that is non-democratic: we 
have seen this time and again. At the 
same time, we cannot say if there is 
democracy in a country, there will be 
automatically human rights. 
Democracy can exist in all societies 
but cannot be transplanted from outside 
— democracy has to come from within 
societies. Democracy does not start and 
end with the electoral process which 
may be its very beginning but true a 
democracy means much more: it means 
institution building, inclusiveness, 
empowering people. These are all 
ingredients of democracy linked with 
human rights. 
In fact, human rights movements 
focus on deepening democracy because 
we need that in every society. Over the 
last decades, we have witnessed the 
stagnation of democracy even in the 
Western countries with a much longer 
experience of it. Human rights activists 
have to work to connect both civil and 
political rights and social and economic 
rights to make democracies effective. 
Do you believe that things are 
changing for the better? 
Changing mindsets is the most difficult 
thing. If | look back 30 years, | think there 
has been change. We have become 
more honest and this accelerates the 
change of mindsets and younger people 
really come forward to the scene of 
public life and give it a new colour. There 
was a time when you could not talk 
against the government and not risk 
prison. Today we do not have political 
prisons in our country. That does not 
mean we do not have human rights 
violations, but we have gone several 
steps forward. 
But we have also gone a step 
backward as the world is becoming 
more complex with new challenges and 
threats. We should all be looking for 
solutions to common problems. We 
need to talk not just about human rights 
monitoring but also determine where 
we need sustainability, where we need 
to do better, and what strategies we 
should follow. One civil society leader 
said to me many years ago: “Asma, you 
can't simply be a human rights activist 
with two feet running on the streets, you 
must use your head too”. | am learning 
now that the feet must move with the 
head. |

### 192309: Rights won, freedoms lost

SANA BEN ACHOUR 
In the Arab region, the debate on 
women’s rights is currently focused on 
the reform of family law. Indeed, in the 
name of an Islam raised to the rank of 
State religion, modern laws accord a 
lower status to women than to men. 
From the Middle East to North Africa a 
normative system has been constructed 
around women — and women in 
particular — that is subordinate to Sharia 
law or the figh [Islamic law and 
jurisprudence] and which, in a variety of 
forms, legitimizes a whole range of 
amalgams, such as between religion and 
political affiliation, political

commandment and the application of 
Sharia law, marriage and religious 
endogamy, etc. 
Family law cements the links 
between religious and political orders, 
turning the family into a citadel of male 
domination. One only has to look at the 
rules on marriage, which include 
matrimonial subjugation, a ban on 
unions between Muslims and non- 
Muslims, and relationships between 
marriage partners based on a duty of 
maintenance, giving men the 
predominant role. And then there are 
the rules of descent and kinship, which 
are based on patrilineal genealogy and 
also apply to laws on nationality — a

Of the 22 members of the League of 
Arab States, 16 signed the Convention 
on the Elimination of all Forms of 
Discrimination against Women in 1981. 
However, they have nearly all voiced 
substantial reservations, whether 
specific or general, regarding one 
measure or another in the text. It is thus 
easy to understand that the feminist 
movements that emerged in the 1980s 
rallied around public policy issues to 
protest against institutionalized 
discrimination and the differences 
between universal human rights and 
national laws.

### 192309: Rights won, freedoms lost

Hostages of the political regime 
It is interesting to note that economic, 
social and cultural reforms have been 
initiated by authoritarian governments — 
often the offspring of national liberation 
movements — exploiting family relations 
as leverage for their national politics. As a 
result, civil codes regarding the 
individual and the family, although they 
derive their origins from classic Muslim 
law, are part of a legislative policy that 
signals a certain conquest of modern 
legislative reason. This was the case for 
the Egyptian laws of 1917, 1920 and 
1929, then laws on personal status in 
Jordan (1951 and 1976), Syria (1953), 
Tunisia (1956), Morocco (1957-1958) and 
Iraq (1959). Other countries recently 
rallied behind this model: Algeria and 
Kuwait in 1984 and, nearer home, 
Mauritania in 2001. In all of these cases, 
the reforms led to changes in the law and 
a restructuring of Islamic normative code 
around women. This is because what is at 
stake is siyassa tachriya (“the making of a 
legislative policy”), taking account of the 
need for arbitration between the 
principles of the organisation of identity 
and civil society's demands for equality. It 
is precisely for this reason that the law on 
personal and family status oscillates 
between the spirit of tradition and the 
spirit of innovation. 
Furthermore, not one of these 
policies has been implemented without 
authoritarian intervention by central 
government — such as decrees from the 
Head of State (as in Tunisia, under the 
presidency of Habib Bourguiba), 
regulations arising from a state of 
emergency (as in Egypt under President 
Anwar El Sadat) or dhahir of the King (as 
in Morocco). Almost everywhere, they 
have been accompanied by the 
establishment of National Women's 
Unions, satellite women’s organizations, 
heavily embedded within the State 
apparatus and the party in power. And 
these organizations serve as a conduit to 
disseminate social policy regarding 
maternal and child health, education and 
literacy, rural development, the 
popularization of new laws on personal 
and family status. These forms of “State 
feminism” ended up by taking women 
hostage and using them as a shield of 
stability for political regimes. 
Maintaining the status quo 
Today, in countries that have been taken 
over by Islamist movements and appeals 
for conformity, these texts, marred by a 
lack of democracy, still seem to have only 
a precarious hold. They may be called 
into question at any moment, as was the 
case in Egypt with the Jihan law of 1979 
(named after Sadat’s wife), which allowed 
a woman to obtain a divorce 
automatically during the year after her 
husband's second marriage. This law was 
revoked in 1985, under the new article 2 
of the Constitution that made Islamic law 
the principle source of legislation. It was 
the same in Tunisia when President 
Bourguiba was deposed in 1987 and 
there were increasing threats of a “return 
to origins”. Once again the tutelary 
intervention of top State authorities was 
required to ensure that the law on 
personal status was not touched, that its 
principles became an accepted national 
fact, and to come down hard on the 
Islamist movement — once it had been 
‘normalized’ - and, while they were at it, 
on the democrats too. 
In other words, behind the scenes of 
these legislative policies on the family, 
not only the reform of traditional law is at 
stake, but maintaining the status quo. 
Any questioning of the traditional 
asymmetry between the rights of men 
and the rights of women would be a 
threat to established public order. And 
those in power permanently renew this 
asymmetry when they grant legal 
guarantees to women without ever 
letting go of male superiority. In the 
wider landscape of family law in Islamic 
countries, Tunisia is undoubtedly the 
country that has gone furthest in terms 
of transgressing against holy law —

### 192319: Now or never

  
Now or Never 
The feminist struggles of past decades often reduced men to enemies, to be fought with any 
possible means. Today, Italian women are mobilizing side by side with men, in order to keep 
their precious gains and to make new demands, such as equal pay for equal work and 
flexible working conditions that do not lead to precarity. 
GIUSY MUZZOPAPPA 
Italian journalist 
‘We didn’t expect it! This was the first 
answer that the organizers of the 
demonstrations on 13 February 2011 
gave to those persons who asked them 
to comment on their initiative. The 
organization in just a few days of a 
national day of action, which succeeded 
in spreading all over the world, must 
have seemed an enormous challenge at 
first. Everything started with a clear and 
categorical movement of indignation, 
which affected a very varied group of 
women, who were members of the Di 
Nuovo association and who had been 
involved in the defence of women’s 
rights for a long time. Several hundred 
thousand people responded to their 
call, one million according to the 
organizers. Women who took to the 
streets with their partners, their fathers, 
their sons and their brothers, in order to 
clearly make a stand for the 
emancipation of Italian women. ‘Every 
one of us made phone calls and 
contacted their networks, and in no 
time we got enthusiastic replies from 
everyone, said the young poet Elisa 
Davoglio. 
The slogan of the demonstration, ‘Se 
non ora quando?, which is a clear 
reference to the title of a novel by the 
famous Italian writer Primo Levi (1919- 
1987) —‘Now or Never’in English — 
clearly expressed the brutal degradation 
of the depiction of woman in the media 
and in Italian politics. The malaise that 
led to this protest found its roots in the 
erosion of gains that Italian women 
thought were permanent, the fruit of 
the struggle for civil rights and the 
equality of the sexes in the 1960s and 
30 THE UNESCO COURIER 
1970s. This period of political struggle, 
which forged an entire generation of 
Italian feminists, seemed to have led to 
major victories: family law was radically 
modified (with the authorization of 
divorce in 1974) and women obtained 
the freedom to decide about pregnancy 
(thanks to the abolition of a particularly 
restrictive abortion law in 1981). The 
fervour of those years seems to have 
gradually died down during the 
following decades, which saw a major 
divide developing between the first 
generation of Italian feminists and their 
daughters and granddaughters. 
Let’s start again together 
Comparing this era to the current 
mobilization of Italian women, 
Francesca |zzo, a lecturer in the history 
of political doctrine at the University of 
Naples ‘L'Orientale, observes how this 
movement ‘very quickly built bridges 
promoting communication between 
the generations, as a result of mutual 
recognition.‘On the one hand, the 
generation that fought in the 1970s 
became fully aware that their gains 
risked being seriously challenged if they 
did not find the courage to speak up 
while recognizing the errors of the past. 
On the other hand, the young 
generations finally understood that the 
rights and benefits which they had 
enjoyed without realizing it were 
threatened with disappearance. Having 
reached that point, we said to ourselves: 
‘Let’s start again together.

### 192319: Now or never

Together, and with men. Elisa 
Davoglio is very clear about this point: 
‘Men gave us very precious assistance. 
The mobilization was born in a climate 
of sincere cooperation and spontaneous 
sharing of reasons for indignation. 
Francesca lzzo goes further and 
identifies a radically new aspect of this 
issue compared to former feminist 
movements: ‘Above all, young people 
could not understood, and rightly so, 
the demands of the feminist struggles 
of past decades, which often reduced 
men to enemies to be fought by any 
means. Young women today have the 
same fears, frustrations and aspirations 
as men of their ages, and they often feel 
fragile and inadequate. They would 
never support a mobilization where 
only women had the right to feel 
indignant! Cristina Comencini, the film 
director and writer, who, with her sister 
Francesca, contributed to organizing 
the demonstration, noted, ‘it is the first 
time that men have been on an equal 
footing with women and have taken to 
the streets side by side with them to 
show their political and human 
strength! 
A political contest 
‘Italy is not a country for women’ is 
another slogan that was found on many 
banners in the streets of Italy and 
elsewhere. Cold hard statistics confirm 
this. According to the 2010 OECD report 
about education in the world, women in 
Italy study more than men (they 
represent 61 % of graduates), but have 
great difficulties in entering the job 
market. According to the report Salariin 
Italia, 2000-2010: il decennio perduto 
(Salaries in Italy, 2000-2010: the lost 
decade) by the CGIL, the main Italian 
trade union, it also appears that their 
salaries are 12 % lower than those of 
their male colleagues, on average. 
According to the 2010 report by ISTAT 
(National Institute of Statistics), the 
female inactivity rate — i.e. the 
percentage of women who are not 
working or studying — is 48.9 %, which is 
the highest level in the European Union 
after Malta. The presence of Susanna 
Camusso, the first woman secretary- 
general of the CGIL, on the podium of 
the Piazza del Popolo in Rome on 13 
February is therefore even more 
symbolic. Working conditions, the right 
to choose between a professional career 
and motherhood, the right to equal pay 
   
> Scene from the demonstration “Se non ora quando”. Piazza del Popolo, Rome, Italy, on 13 February 2011

with men, the right to flexibility which 
does not lead to lifetime precarity - 
these are the issues in the political 
contest started by the movement 'Se 
non ora quando?’. 
The discrediting of women’s roles in 
society goes hand in hand with the 
monstrous and deformed depiction of 
women in the mainstream media. Last 
year, a documentary by the women’s 
rights activist Lorella Zanardo, entitled 
‘Women's Bodies, made a considerable 
impact: no Italian woman who saw it 
can forget the grotesque atmosphere of 
this montage of extracts from the 
television programmes that are shown 
on every Italian channel every day. The 
idea of women being just bodies for 
consumption has profound 
repercussions, above all on younger 
generations. It is precisely this which 
enables the organizers of the 
mobilization to ask deeper questions. 
‘We launched this call in order to say 
that it is not the country we want; said 
Elisa Davoglio. To attain this, we 
decided to make the first move and 
avoid any exploitation of our message, 
by circulating it on our networks via 
Facebook and by creating a blog from 
which we could launch a debate that 
was not controlled by the traditional 
media. We asked everyone to leave all 
political and group membership 
symbols at home, and we chose to 
spread the message and guidelines 
ourselves, with clear and simple words, 
so as to prevent the traditional media 
from taking over our mobilization in any 
way! 
What are the next steps and the 
next problems that the movement will 
decide to face? The question remains 
open. There is no lack of objectives, said 
Francesca Izzo, ‘but we must know how 
we want to attain them. Democracy is 
fundamentally a constant struggle 
between objectives and means. The 
issue of women’s rights is at the heart of 
the major crisis of democratic 
representation. The enormous task in 
front of us consists in reorganizing 
democracy, an objective which needs 
determination and patience/The 
women in the ‘Se non ora quando?’ 
movement want to reclaim the 8 March, 
International Women’s Day, which has 
lost its meaning in Italy. Elisa Davoglio 
concludes: ‘It is not just about 
celebrating the fact of being a woman 
for one day, about being given flowers, 
or even about going to the restaurant. 8 
March speaks about rights, work and 
emancipation! m

Standing up to

If we do not speak out, we are accomplices, says Monica Gonzalez Mujica, laureate of the 
2010 UNESCO/Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize. Jailed and tortured during the 
dictatorship in Chile, she never relinquished her right to free speech. Denouncing injustice 
is what counts for her, beyond gender barriers. 
Interview with MONICA 
GONZALEZ MUJICA by Carolina 
Jerez and Lucia Iglesias (UNESCO) 
Do women do journalism differently? 
As a woman journalist, what were your 
advantages and the obstacles you had 
to overcome throughout your career? 
Let’s talk first about the advantages of 
being a woman, because there are 
some. We have a particular sensitivity, 
which | think is very useful for 
investigative journalism — a greater 
capacity for perceiving who is telling the 
truth, who is lying, who is hiding behind 
a shield, a mask or a disguise. | also feel 
that when women undertake 
something, we are more persistent and 
we only ease up when the work is done. 
We're hard-headed! And | say that 
without being a feminist. 
Of course there are obstacles, 
particularly when aggressors, torturers, 
attack us sexually in order to destroy us. | 
discovered under the dictatorship that 
rape is primarily intended to break us. No 
one could enjoy raping a woman. The 
pleasure is to humiliate a woman and rob 
her of her identity. But in my case, on the 
contrary, it made me stronger. 
What do you consider your greatest 
professional success? 
The most important accomplishment 
for me was to be able to go from 
dictatorship to democracy without 
giving up journalism. | never gave it up 
during the dictatorship, not in jail, not 
32 THE UNESCO COURIER 
under torture, not when my friends 
were killed, or when | had to be 
separated from my daughters, or when | 
shared the pain of so many people in 
this country. When democracy came, | 
felt that there was so much to build. 
What | did right was not to give up 
journalism and | found a new way to 
continue every time | was unemployed. 
I managed to do this thanks to the 
assistance of many people - | am not a 
Superwoman. | am grateful to have met 
people who supported me and 
encouraged me to persevere when | was 
the most afraid. In this profession, you 
are put to the test every day and | want 
this to go on until | die. 
What is the situation of investigative 
journalism today? 
It is without any doubt the type of 
journalism most severely under attack

everywhere. Investigation was the first 
victim of the economic crisis of 2008. It 
was the most expensive journalists that 
were laid off first, those who were 
dedicated to investigation. As the 
investigation’s journalism often is source 
of problems and conflicts, the crisis was 
a wonderful excuse to get rid of the 
desk best equipped to investigate the 
real, pressing issues that were decisive 
for the lives of citizens. 
However, | must stress that the 
quality of investigative journalism in 
Latin America is at least as high as that 
of investigative journalism in English- 
speaking countries. And not only today, 
because we also did this type of work 
under dictatorships. In Chile, for 
example, journalists denounced the 
Pinochet regime crimes under his 
dictatorship, running incredible risks. 
Either journalists have to denounce 
crimes and atrocities or they become 
accomplices. And it is true that 
investigative journalism always involves 
great personal sacrifices and the use of 
the journalist's own funds, because, let's 
face it, no media organization will pay 
journalists for months so they can carry 
out an in-depth investigation into an 
issue and reveal it to the world. 
Basically, | think that Latino- 
American investigative journalism is 
facing a major problem: the drug cartels 
are eroding our societies. Their final 
objective is to deprive us of pleasure, 
happiness and life. This is why it is so 
important to attack them, and it is also 
why it is so important to guarantee that 
journalists can investigate and inform, 
contrary to the current practice in most 
countries’ regions. 
What is your view of the media 
landscape in Latin America? 
Two problems pose an increasingly 
urgent threat to the right of society to 
be informed. First: the formidable 
concentration of media ownership. 
Groups take control of several media 
companies thus consolidating 
television, radio and the written press, 
while they maintain interests in other 
sectors of production, such as 
agriculture, mining, services, real estate, 
etc. A media company cannot provide 
objective reporting on corporations of 
which its owner has shares. This is very 
serious. Journalists are losing their 
independence, their dignity and 
essential skills.

The second threat comes from 
authoritarian governments, which, 
although they came to power 
democratically, make journalists their 
enemies and submit them to constant 
threats. Here, once more, there is 
unfortunately no opposition able to 
defend freedom of information properly. 
Because freedom of information is not 
about supporting the government or 
the opposition, it is about providing 
quality journalism. Just as it is intolerable 
that organized crime cartels go to war 
on journalists, it is unacceptable for 
democratically elected governments to

most committed and tenacious journalists 
in Chile. Exiled in France after the coup

1978, but was not able to practice her 
profession again until 1983. She has

engage in authoritarian practices. 
All this to say the Latin-American 
landscape of media industry is, 
objectively speaking, discouraging; it 
shows the precariousness of journalism. 
This is having a deep effect on society. 
It is democracy as a whole that is 
undermined, because a badly informed 
citizen easily becomes prey to petty 
tyrants. We who lived through 
dictatorships and who regained 
freedom only at the cost of people’ lives 
consider that we cannot let democracy 
get weak and be manipulated by 
authoritarian powers again.

Affected by poverty, forced migrations,

policy, the country is now experiencing 
an unprecedented profusion of media, 
in a semi democratic society thriving 
with unlimited freedom of expression. 
Devoid of any experience of historical 
evolution, these media have grown 
suddenly, in the wake of political and 
commercial propaganda. According to 
Adila Kabiri, journalist and Professor of 
Journalism at Herat University, women 
had no place in journalism in 
Afghanistan’s past. In its capacity as a 
new science, journalism found a footing 
in Afghanistan at the same time as the 
country’s Constitution and for a long 
time was an area exclusively dominated 
by men. And when women were 
gradually getting a share in the 
development of journalism, especially in 
central Afghanistan, the black rule of 
Taliban gained ground. As a result, 
women’s journalistic life in Afghanistan 
has no long precedence. 
In the 1980s, a very limited number 
of women such as Zakia Kohzad were 
active in journalism, while in the 1990s, 
under the Taliban's authoritarian regime, 
women journalists were almost entirely 
non-existent. A few women such as

in the media and the social arena within 
the past decade, reaching a level of 
participation unprecedented in 
Afghanistan’s history. The country is 
now home to more than three hundred 
woman journalists and managers of 
publications. Women have established 
more than ten radio stations and in 
2010 some provinces in Afghanistan, 
notably Herat and Bamyan, were chosen 
to host women’s centres and 
foundations. 
Despite the many social and 
political restrictions, there are a lot of 
Afghan women who have kept up their 
activities in journalism. Yet a well-known 
Afghan writer and poet, Najiba Ayoubi, 
head of the media group Kilid, points 
out women journalists should not be 
satisfied, given the limited percentage 
of them who participate in the 
profession. 
Examining the main challenges 
confronted by women in the media and 
the need to raise women’s share in this 
area, Ms Ayoubi sees journalist training 
institutions and centres for journalism 
education as responsible for providing 
greater opportunities for women. The 
current situation reflects the fact that 
. 
women have undergone immense 
educational and literacy losses within 
three decades of war in Afghanistan, 
thus calling for positive discrimination 
in their favor. According to Ms Ayoubi, 
women have a lower share than men in 
leadership roles in the largely male 
designed media and fewer 
opportunities for work as journalists. In 
other words, gender issues should be 
brought to the attention of media 
[Sila ETE Rol {ei ETE] 
Afghanistan. 
Like all other fields of activity, 
journalism is also a forefront of 
challenges for Afghan women. Farida 
Nekzad, winner of the Canadian 
Association of Journalists’ award for 
Freedom of Expression in 2007, believes 
family restrictions are the main reason 
preventing Afghan women from 
entering the profession upon 
graduation, thus pushing them towards 
the teaching profession. Furthermore, 
women suffer from a lack of social 
relations, not much permitted for 
Afghan women, and a basic 
discriminatory attitude in their society 
that sees women’s activity as less 
significant than men’s. 
Yet Nekzad believes insecurity in the 
country is the first and foremost 
problem facing Afghan women 
journalists. A large number of women 
have lost their lives for their profession 
in the last decade, among them Shaima 
Rezai and Shakiba Sanga Amaj. Other 
journalists like Farida Nekzad and Najia 
Khodayar have been severely 
threatened, causing them to change 
their profession. 
The head of the Women’s Rights 
Group for Afghan Women, Manizha 
Naderi, sees the threats and attacks on 
women journalists as a representation 
a 
of military violence in the country. She 
believes Afghan women in general and 
women journalists in particular are 
attacked for their attributes, with the 
perpetrators seeking to weaken 
women’s social position. 
Fawzia Fakhri, founder of the Centre 
for Women Journalists in Herat, 
enumerates important factors for the 
growth of journalism among Afghan 
women, such as increasing the share of 
women journalists participating in 
international gatherings and adding 
value to their profession at country 
level. The more Afghan women enter 
journalism, she believes, the more their 
future will improve; better opportunities 
and conditions must therefore be 
provided for them. 
Because Afghanistan is moving from 
a traditional society towards a modern 
society, everything has undergone 
sudden, unprecedented growth and all 
is imported from outside. In this 
context, Afghan women journalists 
believe patience is required to build a 
better future and time is the remedy for 
their security issues. 
Afghan women call for the support 
of the international community to 
resolve their security problems and 
other challenges. They see international 
support as an effective step towards 
future development of their activities, 
making it possible to eliminate threats 
and spare women journalists the cruel 
fate of Zakiyah Zaki. m

### 192324: Conquering the job market

  
Conquering 
the job market 
International Women’s Day this year is focusing on the right 
to a decent job. Here, The UNESCO Courier looks at the case of 
Algeria, which has seen a rapid expansion in job 
opportunities for women since the 1990s. Today, Algerian 
women are entering the job market armed with diplomas, 
but they still come up against either job insecurity or the 
glass ceiling. 
FERIEL LALAMI 
“My name is Hassiba. | am 38. Married, 
three children. | work as a technician in 
a private sector company. To get to 
work, | have to take two buses and start 
out at least an hour and a half before

days. | can’t afford to lose my salary —

children when they come out of school. 
My mother finds it hard to accept that | 
have a job — in her day, women only 
worked at home. But, despite the 
difficulties, | am happy to have a 
professional activity, to have colleagues 
and to contribute to the family budget.” 
The story of this young Algerian, 
from the Ain Naaja district of Algiers, 
which | documented in November 2010 
as part of a research study on changes 
in the family, shows that despite the 
obstacles women in Algeria have 
entered the jobs market sustainably. A 
trend that has been confirmed slowly 
but surely over the past three decades, 
even if the results are not yet conclusive. 
Indeed, with women making up only 
15% of the entire workforce (a figure 
36 - THE UNESCO COURIER - APRIL-JUNE 2011 
that remained steady between 2007 
and 2010), Algeria lags far behind its 
neighbours Tunisia and Morocco, which 
have 25% and 28% respectively. 
Even so, the proportion of working 
women increased by 10% between the 
1980s and the early 2000's. Why? Above 
all because of the sad episode in history 
that some call the “Algerian tragedy of the 
1990s" or “the second Algerian war.” 
And also, the ending of State price 
controls, public sector cuts and rising 
unemployment that followed pushed 
families into poverty. Women started 
looking for work, with their families not 
daring to throw the weight of tradition on 
their shoulders — after all, they had to eat. 
Added to all of this is something 
specifically Algerian — women who work 
are better qualified than men. Over half 
of working women, in 2003, had at least 
secondary school qualifications, 
compared to only one fifth of men. This 
is essentially due to a deliberate policy 
of democratising education developed 
by the State, which from the end of the 
colonial era saw a rapid progression in 
the numbers of girls in school. So much 
so that in 2010 girls made up 57% of the 
student population. 
Another observation is that, up until 
the 1990s, the majority of active women 
were aged between 19 and 24 and were 
unmarried. In most cases, marriage or 
the birth of a child would put an end to 
their career. Today, there has been a 
considerable increase in the number of 
married women working, with almost as 
many (18%) as single women (20%). 
But these statistics do not tell the 
whole story. There is also a wider range of 
jobs. Although their preferred sectors are 
still teaching, health and administration, 
women are now entering other areas, 
such as journalism. At present 60% of 
media workers are women. 
The glass ceiling and lack of job 
security 
These jobs also allow women to gain a 
certain degree of visibility in the public 
arena. Even so, there is no escaping the 
fact that, as they move up in their 
careers, including those that are 
‘feminized, women come up against the 
glass ceiling — senior positions of 
responsibility are reserved for men. 
While women make up half of school 
staff, in 2005 they held only 9.15% of 
head teacher posts and 5.6 % of basic 
education inspector positions.

On top of this, unemployment hits 
women harder than men - 19.1 % 
compared to 8.1 % respectively in 2010, 
according to the National Office of 
Statistics. Even worse, among those who 
are most qualified, three times as many 
women as men are unemployed — 33.6 
% versus 11.1 %. Faced with a saturated 
jobs market, women often choose to set 
up their own small business in sales, 
service or cottage industries. According 
to the National Chamber of Commerce 
(CNRC), between 2006 and 2007, the 
number of small traders rose by 4%. 
While these are often micro-enterprises, 
the proportion of women employers 
rose from 3 to 6 %. And a new finding is 
that an increasing number of women 
are becoming estate agents, travel 
agents or agricultural managers. 
The regular increase in the number 
of women in paid employment has also 
led to the creation of informal jobs, such 
as child minder or domestic cook. This 
informal economy, generally reserved 
for women, is also spreading to small 
businesses and the private sector. 
Creating yet more unstable, badly-paid 
jobs without social security benefits. 
Women's access to the job market is 
also affecting family dynamics, bringing 
women greater independence. The 
model of “man as breadwinner” is slowly 
becoming obsolete. But where in the 
past women had to tackle a patriarchal 
culture to gain paid employment, they 
now face another obstacle, just as hard 
to overcome — the extreme scarcity of 
jobs.

### 192326: Gender equality: a global public good

       
Gende

a global public good 
SANIYE GULSER CORAT and ESTELLE RAIMONDO 
Like other Global Public Goods, gender equality represents 
long-term collective benefits that run up against short- 
term special interests. UN Women, the new United Nations 
entity for gender equality and the empowerment of 
women, is called upon to surmount the main obstacles to 
adequate investment in girls and women. 
In the context of the international 
economic downturn combined with the 
food, energy and environmental crises, 
the reflections on “global commons” and 
finding global responses have gained a 
new momentum. Yet while there is an 
extensive literature on Global Public 
Goods (GPGs)', gender equality and 
women’s empowerment are 
conspicuously absent in these 
discussions, despite the fact that it will 
be impossible to achieve global 
economic growth, accountable 
governance and peace when half the 
world’s population — women — are kept 
outside of the global agenda setting 
process. 
Investments in girls and women are 
all the more important at a time of 
budget constraints when only 
investments with a high rate of return 
and a significant multiplier effect are 
placed on the agenda of donor 
countries. The time has come to change 
the perspective of development 
funding, or international development 
assistance. Altruism and geo-politics 
must give way to a vision of provision of 
utility for all. Girls and women must no

longer be viewed as victims of 
marginalization from the “mainstream” 
development efforts but as critical 
actors and agents of change who can 
add significantly to the overall 
productivity of national, regional and 
global economies. 
We know that women spend, on 
average, 90% of their earnings on 
education, health and the nutrition of 
their families and communities while 
men invest only 40% of their earnings in 
these areas. Recent evidence 
demonstrates that at the corporate 
level, increased numbers of women in 
top management positions tend to have 
a positive effect on the performance of 
companies and on their stockholders’ 
level of trust. Finally, at the macro-level, 
evidence also shows that the simple fact 
of having women in the workforce has a 
positive impact on productivity. 
Gender equality in the political 
realm, i.e. women’s inclusion in political 
decision-making structures and 
processes along with men, also has 
powerful spill-over effects. At the local 
level, for example, quotas for women in 
the Indian Panchayat (local 
government) show that women leaders 
are more effective in delivering public 
goods such as drinking water 
infrastructure than their male 
counterparts.

Rwanda provides a good example of 
this correlation. Rwanda’s constitutional 
reform imposed a minimum of 30% 
representation for women in the 
national parliament. Female members 
of Parliament succeeded in putting 
health and education at the top of the 
Rwandan national agenda. The fast rate 
of growth of the country is also 
intrinsically linked to the active 
participation of women in the labour 
force in general (80 per cent) and as 
heads of enterprises in particular — they 
head 42% of enterprises in the formal 
sector and 58% in the non-formal 
sector. 
In rare instances, such as in Liberia 
or Guatemala, where women 
participated in formal peace building 
processes on an equal footing with 
men, peace negotiations became more 
constructive, inclusive and sustainable. 
Gender equality as GPG becomes 
even more straightforward when the 
Millennium Development Goals are 
considered. Gender equality is critical 
for achieving gender parity in 
education, reducing child mortality, 
improving maternal health and 
eradicating poverty and hunger, as a 
majority of the poor are women. As for 
environmental sustainability, how can it 
 
be achieved if women, who constitute 
the majority of those who safeguard 
biodiversity, are kept at bay? Finally, how 
can a global partnership for 
development be achieved if women 
either absent or are grossly under- 
represented in policy and 
decision-making? 
What measures can be put in place 
to ensure that gender equality 
circumvents the fate of other GPGs 
regarding “under-provision”? There is a 
need to modify the incentives to 
overcome three major obstacles: lack of 
coordination among actors; “free-riding” 
— letting others provide the good while 
one enjoys its benefits; and time 
inconsistency and public choice, as 
gender equality is not at the top of the 
agenda of election platforms. 
The United Nations as a system has 
significant comparative advantages. It 
can overcome the coordination problem 
as it is mandated to serve as a platform 
for Member States to come together and 
address global issues. It can overcome 
the “free-riding” by holding international 
institutions and governments 
accountable for their commitments such 
as to the Convention on the Elimination 
of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women (CEDAW) and the Beijing 
Declaration and Platform for Action. 
Last but not least, it can surmount the 
time inconsistency obstacle by putting 
pressure on the Member States and 
institutions to honour their obligations. 
The new United Nations Entity for 
Gender Equality and the Empowerment 
of Women (UN Women) has the 
potential to play this crucial role 
provided that it has vision and strategic 
leadership, sets an agenda and course of 
action accepted by the major 
stakeholders, and is equipped with the 
requisite human and financial resources 
to fulfil its responsibilities. m

### 192328: Davos Forum: women are the future

  
avos Forum:     
women are the future 
Last January’s World Economic Forum in Davos (Switzerland) brought together some 35 heads 
of state and government and 2,500 decision-makers, and only 16% of them were women. 
Nonetheless, the rate of women’s participation has practically doubled since 2001 and 
according to Ben Verwaayen, one of the Forum's founders, the future of Davos depends on it. 
KATRIN BENNHOLD, German journalist at the International Herald Tribune 
Davos Man is a very particular kind of 
beast. Powerful, worldly and often very 
rich, he tends to be more familiar with 
stock market prices than supermarket 
prices and has all the right accessories: a 
villa on the Cote d'Azur, a private jet on 
call and a pet philanthropic project. 
Davos Woman is worldly, wealthy 
and influential, too. But mostly, she is 
scarce. 
Women attending this annual Alpine 
schmoozefest of the global super elite 
find themselves in a peculiar place: They 
are members of that elite — but 
relatively recent members with a 
minority status. 
Female participants still account for 
only 16 percent of the total at the World 
Economic Forum. Indeed, with so many 
of the women shuffling through the 
snow in their fur coats being spouses, 
those who aren't can easily find 
themselves mistaken for one: “At a Davos 
cocktail party people tend to assume 
you're a ‘wife’ rather than a C.E.O." said 
Francoise Gri, the president of Manpower 
France, who has made Fortune 
magazine's list of 50 most powerful 
women in the world for the past seven 
years. It is her second time in Davos. 
“It still feels a little like a white men’s 
club,” she said. “As a woman, one doesn’t 
entirely feel like one belongs.” 
Christine Lagarde, the French finance 
minister and a Davos regular for over a

International Herald Tribune. Entitled “Women Make 
Their Mark at Davos, Though Still a Distinct 
Minority, it appeared in the supplement “The 
Female Factor” on 26 January 2011. 
decade, described how “the male- 
dominated chemistry” at the forum used 
to affect her confidence. “You know 
you're competent, you've looked at your 
files, but somehow you feel inhibited,” 
she said. 
Female elites do not live in a bubble 
It is tempting to think about the rich and 
powerful as a gender-neutral group that 
operates in a borderless bubble of 
privilege and whose disconnect to the 
everyday lives of the middle classes in 
their respective home countries has only 
been exacerbated by the current 
economic crisis. 
Even rich and successful mothers 
tend to bear primary 
responsibility for the children. 
That can hold back careers or 
make the work-life balance 
particularly hectic. 
But unlike many of their male peers, 
women at the top have something 
powerful in common with their less- 
privileged sisters: “Gender equality is a 
concern that cuts across the class divide,” 
said Dominique Reiniche, who heads 
Coca-Cola Europe.“Women at all levels 
have a common cause!’ 
That helps explain why the rising 
phenomenon of female philanthropy 
often focuses on seeking to improve the 
lot of less-fortunate women, said Jacki 
Zehner, vice chairwoman of the Women's 
Funding Network and the first female 
trader to make partner at Goldman

Sachs. Entertainers including Angelina 
Jolie [USA] and Annie Lennox [UK] — both 
recent Davos attendees — promote 
women’s rights for the United Nations or 
other organizations. 
There are other elements that put 
women perhaps less at risk of living in a 
hermetically sealed bubble. 
Even rich and successful mothers 
tend to bear primary responsibility for 
the children. That can hold back careers 
or make the work-life balance 
particularly hectic. But they stay more in 
touch with society: they have the 
primary relationships with nannies, often 
women from more disadvantaged (and 
perhaps immigrant) backgrounds. They 
speak to teachers and interact with 
mothers of their offspring’s friends. 
They are also more likely to help with 
child-related practical tasks, like birthday 
parties and shopping. (“There is nothing 
like teenage daughters to keep you in 
touch with the world,” said Ms. Reiniche, 
a mother of three girls.) 
Often, female elites lack the sense of 
entitlement among male elites, said Ms. 
Lagarde. “Women, for all sorts of 
historical, cultural and economic reasons, 
have a tendency to stay more connected 
with the real world,” said Ms. Lagarde, 
herself a mother of two boys. 
“I don’t know many men at that level 
who would go to the supermarket to do 
their own shopping, but | do," she added. 
Among others who do the same, she 
said, are Anne Lauvergeon, chief 
executive of the nuclear giant Areva; 
Chancellor Angela of Germany; and 
Lubna Olayan, a Saudi businesswoman.

Being out of touch with the real world 
is one of the most serious charges leveled 
at the elites — and elite institutions like 
the World Economic Forum. 
Gender equality: a must-have 
accessory 
If Davos wants to remain relevant in 
the decades to come, women need to 
feature much more not just on the 
participant list but as speakers 
throughout the program, said Zainab 
Salbi, founder of the humanitarian 
organization Women for Women 
International and one of the World 
Economic Forum's Young Leaders. 
“I know many women who already 
talk about no longer coming to Davos,” 
she said ahead of this year’s meeting. 
“The forum was a great 20th century 
event, now it needs to prove that it is fit 
for the 21st” 
Or, as Ben Verwaayen, chief 
executive of Alcatel-Lucent and a 
member of the forum's foundation 
board, put it: “Gender equality is about 
future-proofing your organization — it’s 
a license to be there.” 
40 - THE UNESCO COURIER - APRIL-JUNE 2011 
The sense of urgency has certainly 
grown in recent years, particularly since 
a French businesswoman who was 
reportedly fed up at not being invited to 
Davos set up a Women’s Forum in 
Deauville, France. 
The share of women participants in 
Davos has almost doubled since 2001. 
Women-related events, once relegated 
to the early breakfast slot off-site, now 
occupy prime slots in the main Congress 
Center. There are receptions, dinners 
and cocktails dedicated to female 
networking. 
This year, for the first time, forum 
organizers agreed a 20 percent female 
quota with their 100 top partner 
companies, insisting they send at least 
one woman among their five delegates 
or forgo the fifth place. The quota has 
more than doubled the number of 
women sent from these companies. 
Because it affects only 500 of the 2,500 
participant slots, it hasn't increased 
overall female attendance, but it is, say 
organizers, about as much as they can 
force the issue. 
if Davos wants to remain 
relevant in the decades to come, 
women need to feature much 
more not just on the participant 
list but as speakers throughout 
the program 
“As a foundation that draws its 
individual membership from the world’s 
leading thousand businesses, we reflect 
their gender balance,” said Saadia 
Zahidi, Head of the forum’s Women 
Leaders and Gender Parity Program. 
Soon women might be getting help 
from a very Davos corner: Nicole 
Schwab, daughter of the founder of the 
World Economic Forum, is introducing a 
gender equality certificate to 
companies that live up to (yet to be 
defined) standards on equal pay, female 
representation and employee 
satisfaction with gender equality. 
“The objective is that this certificate 
becomes a competitive advantage for 
companies who need to attract talent 
and compete for investments,’ said 
Aniela Unguresan, Ms. Schwab's partner 
at The Gender Equality Project. 
Now the elites just need to be 
convinced that along with the yacht and 
the yoga guru, a gender equality label is 
a must-have accessory. m

As she speaks, Lorena Aguilar tosses her hair with the same energy she puts into every 
word and emphatic hand gesture. For over 25 years, she has worked on developing public 
policy on climate change, expanding knowledge on issues not yet addressed in terms of 
gender equality. 
LORENA AGUILAR was interviewed by Alfredo Trujillo Fernandez, Spanish journalist 
Why is it necessary to look at climate 
change from a gender perspective? 
What do women contribute, in your 
opinion? 
Men and women have a different 
relationship to natural resources. So we 
need to make use of both points of 
view. Unfortunately when it comes to 
finding solutions, the scales are tipped 
in one direction. Strategies are all too 
often implemented with a bias, only 
from men’s point of view. It is also a 
matter of defending women’s rights. We 
have to remember that they make up 
more than half of the world’s 
population. So they should be included 
when decisions are made, which has 
not been the case up to now. 
Women are the guardians of crucial 
knowledge for combating climate 
change. For example, in many countries 
and regions of the world, like Asia, 
Africa, and South America, men have 
opted for monoculture, while women 
continue to cultivate a great variety of 
plants in their gardens and plots. 
According to the weather they predict 
for the current year, they will choose 
one kind of seed rather than another. 
This diversity is a goldmine for 
scientists who want to reintroduce 
species that have disappeared in 
certain countries because of farming 
policies. 
In countries like Cuba, women have 
sometimes kept up to 250 varieties of 
bean, and 75 varieties of rice... In Peru, 
there are as many as 60 varieties of 
yucca. And in Rwanda, up to 600 
varieties of rice! This is what the UN 
Food and Agriculture Organisation 
(FAO) claims, anyway. 
This wealth of diversity in seeds and 
in the traditional knowledge linked to 
them is both a treasure in itself and a 
fantastic tool for combating climate 
change. Firstly, because these kinds of 
seed can adapt more easily to the 
climatic conditions we are seeing today. 
And then because this improved 
capacity for adaptation means we will 
be able to produce more and therefore 
better deal with the food needs of the 
world’s population.

How are women in particular affected 
by climate change? 
Women are more vulnerable, especially 
during natural disasters related to 
climate change. Researchers at the 
London School of Economics (LSE) 
looked at 141 disasters around the 
world, and found that in those countries 
where gender differences were most 
marked, four times as many women 
died as men! This is not because they 
are weaker but because they have less 
education. When a woman who has 
never gone to school hears on the radio 
that there will be winds of 260 km/h, 
this means absolutely nothing to her. 
She does not have the tools or sufficient 
knowledge to respond to the threat. 
The same problem arises in Muslim 
countries where a woman is not allowed 
out of the home unless a male 
accompanies her. In Bangladesh, in 
1991, a hurricane killed almost 150,000 
people. No less than 90 % were women! 
They didn’t want to leave their home 
without a man, or they didn’t know how 
to swim. 
The study also found that, in 
countries where the gender gap is less 
pronounced, a natural disaster causes 
about the same number of deaths for 
each of the sexes. Our work at the 
International Union for Conservation of 
Nature (IUCN) consists of emphasising 
the fact that women are agents for 
change, with special knowledge and 
skills, and the right to participate in 
decisions and political life. 
What are you doing to encourage this 
change? 
For a start, we present things differently. 
Itis not a question of arguing that 
women are more sensitive or better, just 
because they are women, or that it’s in 
our nature to hug trees. Sentimentality 
will get us nowhere! Our argument is 
about development, it is technical and 
scientific, positive and preventative. It is 
an argument based on rights with 
universal relevance. The Arab League 
has become one of our main allies, 
alongside countries like Finland and 
Denmark. 
This year, we have developed three 
strategies that link gender awareness 
and adaptation to climate change — in 
Mozambique, Jordan and Central 
America. Our action mainly involves 
visiting each of these regions to see 
what has been accomplished in terms of 
combating climate change, and from 
that point developing strategies 
adapted to each particular situation. 
This is not a model to be applied 
uniformly. We take into account regional 
specificities. 
In Central America, for example, the 
seven countries in the region (Belize, 
Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, 
Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama) have 
developed a common strategy for 
mitigating climate change and adapting 
to its effects. Women have been 
consulted and asked to share their 
knowledge. By integrating their needs 
within this new strategy, we are able to 
incorporate the gender factor into the 
mitigation measures to be 
implemented. 
Over 25 countries want to develop 
similar actions, which will enable us to 
reduce the differences that lead to a 
higher mortality rate for women. 
How do communities feel about these 
new projects? 
Some indigenous tribes in Central 
America have been actively involved, 
both in sharing knowledge and in 
building capacity. Their knowledge is 
42 - THE UNESCO COURIER - APRIL-JUNE 2011 
fundamental. But, even so, we still 
encounter a certain resistance. People 
are afraid of repeating past mistakes. We 
know for example that 70 % of the 
poorest people in the world are women, 
but when we look to see who benefits 
most from cooperating in projects, we 
find that the resources almost never go 
to the women. But when they do 
benefit, 95 % use these resources to 
improve living conditions for the family, 
while only about 15% of men do this. 
That is why they are afraid that these 
projects will once again be just for men, 
as was the case when financial 
compensation was paid to rural 
communities to combat deforestation. 
We have fears, and so do communities. 
Specifically, what are your fears for the 
future? 
We have many fears, because most 
development programmes have never 
taken gender inequalities into account, 
and that is what we want to put right. 
The World Bank evaluated over 200 
projects on water resources and 
concluded that those that were most 
effective were always those that 
promoted gender equality. What we 
want to do is to attract global attention 
to this fact. To point out this is a battle 
that must be won and that we will 
campaign to see this happen.

odd cathedral portico, as part of 
superstition, or in literature. | will 
illustrate with the examples of two 
ambiguous, contradictory figures who 
endured long periods of suffering 
caused by bodily vicissitudes and 
incredible tragedies but who like the 
phoenix ultimately experienced 
resurrection and vindication. 
Just two women, out of the 
hundreds | would have liked to salute. 
There is not the space in this article to 
talk about the great leaders like Golda 
Meir, Bandaranaike — mother and 
daughter — Indira and Sonia Gandhi, 
Benazir Bhutto, Angela Merkel, Evita, 
Michelle Bachelet or Cristina Kirchner. 
And, even though | have profound 
admiration for the tenacity of Carla del 
Ponte and Mary Robinson, or the 
courage of Karla Michel Salas and her 
tireless campaign to bring the 
controversial case of the murdered 
women of Ciudad Judrez before the 
Inter-American Court of Human Rights, | 
cannot dwell on them here. | also 
cannot say more about Waris Dirie, the 
first woman to publicly denounce 
female circumcision. This may be 
essentially an African practice, but | feel 
that her struggle needs to be shouted 
from the rooftops, so that even more 
people will follow her example. Indeed, 
her cause has long been championed 
by a centenarian with more energy than 
many half her age, Rita Levi-Montalcini, 
nicknamed “Lady Neuron”. Every day she

goes to the office of her foundation in 
Rome to lend her support to education 
programmes for African women. An 
asteroid discovered in 1981 bears her 
name, an appropriate tribute. 
The road to emancipation that 
women have trodden for almost a 
century has been hard going — and 
continues to be fraught with 
ambiguities, contradictions, traps and 
perpetual confrontations between the 
forces of light and those that do their 
utmost to relegate us to the kingdom of 
darkness. The lives of two writers, two 
dazzling stars that | want to extricate 
from obscurity here, will serve as 
examples — Else Lasker-Schiler and 
Janet Frame. 
Else Lasker-Schiiler, a foreigner in her 
own land 
| have kept her portrait and her letters 
close at hand for years. She was a mix of 
contrasting characteristics - surrender 
and arrogance, rebellion and submission. 
The works by Else Lasker-Schiler illustrating this 
article are being shown from 21 January to 1 May 
2011 at the Hamburg Bahnhof - Museum for the 
Present, Berlin. The exhibition is organized by the 
Jewish Museum in Frankfurt with the Berlin 
National Gallery and State Museum and supported 
by the Friends of the National Gallery.

But Else was above all an inner 
voice, pursuing poetry, her 
poetry, to its ultimate 
consequences. A giftand a 
destiny. 
And so much destitution, so much 
poverty. But Else was above all an inner 
voice, pursuing poetry, her poetry, to its 
ultimate consequences. A giftand a 
destiny. “Everyone loves my poetry, but 
no-one loves my heart,” she used to say 
lucidly and incisively. 
Else Lasker-Schiiler’s life was filled 
with paradox. During the Nazi period, the 
Germans added her books to the pile to 
be burned as examples of entartete Kunst 
(degenerate art). And yet only shortly 
before, she had been awarded the Kleist 
prize, Germany's highest literary 
distinction. In Israel, they didn’t like her 
much either, which is to say no one read 
her because she wrote in the language of 
the enemy, the cursed language. Today, 
her “bad motherland’, Germany, where 
she was born, and Israel, where she is 
buried, are fighting over her, each 
claiming that she is “their” national poet, 
calling her “the Muse of Berlin,” and “Star 
of Weimar," no less.

administered the treatments were 
conscientious, indifferent or relentless, 
but none had any effect on her passion 
for writing. 
Literature saved her life. In 1952, she 
was at the Seacliff hospital in Otago, New 
Zealand, about to undergo an operation. 
The diagnosis — later proved wrong — was 
schizophrenia. A lobotomy was planned, 
to return her to’normality’ But just then,

Else was never satisfied with the 
world as it is. She had to transform it, 
changing history to suit her. Starting 
with herself. She made up her age, her 
grandparents’ occupations, the names 
of her husband and lovers — the 
Sulamite, the Prince of Thebes, Prince 
Youssouf, Tino of Bagdhad. But the 
reality was more arid, and often the pain 
(the premature deaths of her brother 
and her only son), the terror (the rise of 
Nazism) and the poverty (writing never 
earned her enough to live on) lurked 
within the damp basements that were 
her temporary dwellings. 
A very old bookseller in Jerusalem 
who is dear to me remembers coming 
across her in the one café where the 
city’s insomniacs could go at the time, 
Attara. Bizarrely dressed almost in rags, 
eccentric as always and with no money 
to pay for her modest order, she pulled 
some gold foil wrappers from her 
blouse and offered them to the irate 
waiter as if they were gems or little suns. 
What Am | Doing Here? was the title 
chosen by the publisher Salman 
Shocken, a refugee in exile in the USA, 
for his collected correspondence with 
the poet. It contains bitter 
recriminations against the earthly 
Jerusalem's harsh climate, its inhabitants’ 
lack of subtlety and the overall poverty 
of its literary and cultural life. 
Expatriate nostalgia was Else's 
greatest sorrow. Her masterpiece, My 
Blue Piano, is dedicated “to my 
unforgettable friends from the cities of 
Germany — and to those who were 
driven out like me and are now 
dispersed throughout the world. Yours 
faithfully!” 
Posterity’s belated judgment 
avenged her. On 20 November 2003, in 
her acceptance speech for the Nobel 
Prize in Literature, Elfriede Jelinek paid 
homage to her: “As a schoolgirl | loved 
the extravagant, exotic and colourful 
personality of Else Lasker-Schiiler. | 
wanted desperately to write poems like 
her, and even though | never did, she 
made a considerable impression on me!”

out of the blue, the fairy godmother of 
literature appeared — her first book, The 
Lagoon and other stories received the 
country’s most prestigious prize. 
It was a miracle that the surgeon, 
Blake Palmer, and the Otago hospital 
administrator happened to read that 
very day in the papers that their patient, 
Janet Frame, had just received the 
Hubert Church Memorial Award. 
To situate her in space and time - she 
was born in Dunedin on 28 August 1924, 
and passed away on 29 January 2004. 
An Angel at My Table, the 1990 film 
Jane Campion based on Frame's three- 
volume autobiography, was awarded 
the Special Jury prize at the Venice Film 
Festival and propelled her into the 
limelight. “Until Jane Campion’s film,” 
said its subject, “I was known as the mad 
writer. Now | am the mad, fat writer” Her 
forte was to scrutinise everything 
fearlessly. She never forgot her friend 
Nola and all the other women that had 
no literary prize to save them from 
lobotomies and who were irreversibly 
turned into silent and docile zombies.

Janet Frame is the most penetrating 
and brilliant woman writer who ever 
attempted to explore madness from the 
inside. In her books, she defines her self 
as a “migratory bird”. 
In Faces on the Water, she notes that 
total madness or death never come 
when we seek or call them. Frame 
establishes her voice in another world, 
the world of the defeated, on the other 
side, behind the bars, the sedatives and 
the straitjackets — speaking for the 
bodies and minds locked up inside the 
prison of the asylum. 
As she was to learn to her cost, there 
is a hierarchy among these patients: 
there are the “good”, the “crazy” and the 
resistant ones like herself who continue 
thinking. They are the ones subjected to 
electroshock, a trap that springs shut 
“on the shadows of the deep”. 
Janet Frame is the most 
penetrating and brilliant woman 
writer who ever attempted to 
explore madness from the inside. 
In her books, she defines her self 
as a “migratory bird” 
There were five children in the 
Frame family — a boy and five girls. Their 
father was a railway worker, their 
mother a maid, for a while in the service 
of the family of writer Katherine 
Mansfield. 
Tragedy marked their lives several 
times — two of the girls died from 
drowning, ten years apart. The son had 
epilepsy. 
As a child she was rejected because 
she was unattractive, and in 
adolescence she was mocked for her 
excessive shyness. A teacher she was in 
love with convinced her to have herself 
committed after a clumsy suicide 
attempt. She ended up spending eight 
years in a psychiatric hospital, “an 
imprisoned Now, an eternal Is-Land 
without its accompanying horizons”. 
Second amazing intervention by the 
fairy godmother of writers: at the end of 
her hospital nightmare she met Frank 
Sargeson, mentor to promising young 
New Zealand writers, who satisfied her 
hunger for books and persuaded her to 
write full time. He set her up in a cabin 
on his property in Takapuna, north of 
Auckland. A year later she finished her 
first novel, Owls Do Cry. Sargeson also ©

helped her find the money to goon a 
visit to Europe. 
London, Paris, Barcelona, Ibiza and 
back to London, where she could not 
find work because of her history of 
mental illness. Once again, stigma, once 
again she committed herself voluntarily, 
this time to the Maudsley hospital. Third 
visit of the fairy godmother in the guise 
of the doctor, Alan Miller, who rejected 
the initial diagnosis and erased any 
trace of schizophrenia. He encouraged 
her to undergo psychoanalysis and to 
exorcise her past by putting her ordeal 
into words. 
As the magic of numbers requires, 
having written seven novels, she 
returned home seven years later. And so 
life goes. 
From then on it was a succession of 
prizes, grants, writer's residencies, 
distinctions, voyages and honorary 
doctorates, but also controversy 
surrounding her work and herself. And 
periodic nominations for a Nobel Prize 
that never came. 
“The edge of the alphabet where 
words crumble and all forms of 
communication between the living are 
useless,” she writes. How true.

### 192332: Mother Teresa: the most powerful woman in the world

Al 
the most powerful woman in the worl 
She devoted her life to 
serving the weakest, 
founding a multinational 
charity in the process. 
Portrait by a Hindu author of 
Mother Teresa, an Albanian 
Catholic who was born in 
Skopje’ under the Ottoman 
Empire and died in Calcutta, 
India. She received the Nobel 
Peace Prize in 1979 and in 
2003 she was beatified by 
Pope John-Paul Il. 
NAVIN CHAWLA 
Mother Teresa, with whom | had a 23- 
year long association, was a 
multi-dimensional figure, both simple 
and complex. Her attention to 
whomsoever was with her at any point in 
time — whether poor or rich, disabled, 
leprosy afflicted or destitute — was 
complete. Yet she also simultaneously 
ran a huge religious order, the 
Missionaries of Charity, that had taken 
root in 123 countries by the time she 
died in 1997. This included feeding 
centres, schools, soup kitchens, hospices, 
homes, leprosy stations for orphans and 
abandoned children, drug rehabilitation 
centres and home-visiting to comfort the 
sick and elderly. All these were achieved 
with a fair amount of precision and 
regularity by the Sisters and Brothers of 
her Order. 
The biography | wrote on Mother 
was an accident. | had known her for a 
number of years and helped her with her 
concerns in Delhi. In all that time it never 
struck me to write a book. One day when 
we were in conversation she said 
1. Capital of the Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia 
 
& Mother Teresa, with Navin Chawla and his family. © Navin Chawla 
something enormously funny and we 
both laughed. It was then that | 
remarked that none of the books that | 
had read about her had brought out that 
side of her personality. Perhaps | should 
write a book, | said. She was not inclined 
to agree: “So many books have already 
been written!” | blurted out: “Why, 
Mother, does one have to be a Catholic, 
can't a bureaucrat and a Hindu write?”| 
immediately regretted my words and fell 
into an embarrassed silence for she had 
never discriminated in any way. However, 
she took that seriously and said: “All right, 
but don’t write about me, write about 
the work!” 
Although she herself remained 
fiercely Catholic, her brand of religion 
was not exclusive. Convinced that each 
person she ministered to was Christ in 
suffering, she reached out to people of 
all faiths. The very faith that sustained her 
infuriated her detractors who saw her as 
a symbol of a right-wing conspiracy and, 
worse, the principal mouthpiece of the 
Vatican's well-known views against 
abortion. Interestingly, such criticism 
went largely unnoticed in India, where 
she was widely revered. 
| once called her the most powerful 
woman in the world. She replied: 
“Where? If | was, | would bring peace to 
the world! | asked her why she did not 
use her undeniable influence to lessen 
war. She replied: “War is the fruit of 
politics. If | get stuck in politics, | will stop 
loving. Because | will have to stand by 
one, not by all”

### 192332: Mother Teresa: the most powerful woman in the world

The large bequests and donations 
were gratefully received and 
immediately ploughed into wherever 
the need was most pressing. Yet, it was 
the “sacrifice money” that she always 
remembered — the Kolkata beggar 
who emptied his day’s earnings of a few 
coins into her hands; the young Hindu 
couple who loved each other so much 
yet refused a marriage feast so that they 
could offer her the money they thus 
saved. 
When Mother Teresa was alive, | had 
expressed concern to her whether the 
organization she had built from scratch 
could be sustained after she passed on. | 
had seen several other organizations 
begin to wither away soon after their 
charismatic founders died. The first time | 
posed this question to her, she merely 
pointed her fingers heavenwards. The 
second time | asked, she set my question 
aside with a smile saying, “Let me go 
first” On my persistence, she finally 
answered, “You have been to so many of 
our‘homes’ (branches) in India and 
abroad. Everywhere the Sisters wear the 
same saris, eat the same kind of food, do 
the same work, but Mother Teresa is not 
everywhere, yet the work goes on!"Then 
she added, “As long as we remain 
committed to the poorest of the poor 
and don't end up serving the rich, the 
work will prosper.” 
As a Hindu, armed only with a certain 
eclecticism, | found it took me longer 
than most to understand that Mother 
Teresa was with Christ in each conscious 
hour, whether at Mass or with each of 
those whom she tended. It was not a 
different Christ on her crucifix and a 
different one who lay dying at her 
hospice in Kalighat. For Mother Teresa, to 
love one’s neighbour was to love God. 
This was what was essential to her, not 
the size of her mission or the power 
others perceived in her. She explained 
this to me simply but meaningfully when 
she said, “We are called upon not to be 
successful, but to be faithful” m 
A retired high-ranking civil servant, 
Navin Chawla had a long association 
with Mother Teresa. He wrote a 
biography of the founder of the 
Missionaries of Charity. 
The 100th anniversary of Mother Teresa's 
birth will be celebrated globally between 
August 2010 and August 2011.

### 192335: Manuela Sáenz: liberator of the liberator

Manuela 
Saenz 
liberator 
of the 
Liberator 
LAUTARO POZO    4 
(i ¥ fa
The bicentennial commemoration of Latin American declarations 
of independence (2009-2011) has given official historians a 
chance to glorify the heroes of this era. Manuela Saenz Aispuru 
from Ecuador is one of them. Born at the end of the 18th century 
and nicknamed “liberator of the Liberator” by her lover Simon 
Bolivar, she survives in memoirs only for saving his life in an 
assassination attempt in Bogota, the Colombian capital, in 1828. 
She did much more. 
By this time, this very beautiful woman 
and admirer of Bolivar had already 
taken up arms on many occasions. As 
early as 1809-1810, while she was still a 
teenager, she had supported the 
uprisings in Quito, her birthplace, where 
the struggle for independence started. 
In 1821, she helped to liberate Lima 
(Peru), where she married and received 
the decoration “The Order of the Sun” 
from General San Martin. Back home in 
Quito, she joined the battle of 
Pichincha, which established the 
independence of Gran Colombia. It was 
when the Liberator marched 
triumphantly into the city on 24 May 
1822 that our two heroes met. They 
remained inseparable until Bolivar died 
in 1830. 
From 1823 she became his secretary 
and official archivist. A wise advisor and 
skilled politician, she worked behind the 
scenes for the great man, acting as both 
confidant and mediator for the military 
chiefs, from Sucre to San Martin. 
But, above all, she performed 
miracles on the battlefield, recruiting, 
arming, providing supplies, organising, 
caring for the wounded, putting her 
energy into any task where she could be 
useful. In her diary, she wrote: “(...) we 
recruited entire villages for the 
revolution, the motherland. Women 
made uniforms, others dyed the cloth 
(...). We dragged children around with 
us, asking them to gather scraps of iron 
and tin so that we could melt them and 
make rifles, cannons, nails, horseshoes, 
etc. In a word, | was a real war 
commissioner, and | didn’t rest for a 
moment until our revolution was won.” 
In 1824, after the decisive battle of 
Junin for the independence of Peru, she 
was made captain of the hussars, then 
colonel of the army of Gran Colombia. 
The tireless Ecuadorian died in exile, in 
Paita (Peru) in 1856. 
Yet her story does not end there, as, 
in 2007, many years later, she was 
posthumously promoted to General of 
the Republic of Ecuador by President 
Rafael Correa.

### 192336: Tribute to Edouard Glissant

Tribute to 
Faouard Glissant 
The 
Philosophy of 
Tout-Monde 
“When | heard of the death of 
Edouard Glissant a flood of 
images came to me from a 
long and fertile friendship.” 
This is how the Guadeloupian 
writer Ernest Pépin opened 
his vibrant homage entitled 
“An unquiet global soul!” We 
publish an excerpt here, in 
memory of Edouard Glissant, 
Editor in Chief of the UNESCO 
Courier from 1982 to 1988. 
ERNEST PEPIN 
In the frenzy of his poems, plays, novels 
and theoretical works, it is sometimes 
difficult to follow the thread of Edouard 
Glissant’s thinking. Yet we find his ideas 
alluring, like the ‘field of islands’ he 
wanted to build at the tip of Tout-Monde'. 
Endlessly expanding the concentric 
circles of writing in a state of high alert, 
he irrigated a proteiform ‘system’ of a 
rare density [...] 
For Glissant, the idea of the Tout- 
Monde did not mean kowtowing to the 
humbug of globalization. On the 
contrary, it meant substituting the 
“trembling” of the world for the myth of 
an immutable identity. It stood for its 
unpredictability! Its ‘globality’! 
1. First formulated in a novel in 1993, then in a 1997 
theoretical work, “Tout-Monde” became a 
fundamental concept of Glissant’s universalist 
thinking. An institute devoted to it was founded in 
Paris (French-only website: www.tout-monde.com).

By investigating the world, in all its 
incessant movement, Glissant taught us 
to renounce the idea of a levelling and, 
when all is said and done, imperialist 
unity. 
He made it impossible to make 
assimilations, encouraging us to 
appreciate the frictions, the lightning 
strikes, the variations of a 
heterogeneous intellectual and cultural 
effervescence. How a Frenchman can 
become Chinese, a Chinese person 
Caribbean, a Caribbean, Finnish, 
without losing anything of their identity. 
Glissant taught us about plasticity 
versus rigidity. All one has to do today is 
to watch or listen to some of the 
younger generation to understand this 
alternative way of thinking of the world 
and oneself. Glissant taught us that 
identity is not a rosary to be recited but 
a risk that one faces up to with the 
imagination of the world. Not a denial of 
others but an opening to others.A loss 
of identity! cry those nostalgic for 
‘purity”’No’ replies Glissant, a 
reorganization of the self within the 
creative instability of the world! 
His legacy to us is no less than a 
philosophy fit for the 21st century. All 
50 THE UNESCO COURIER - APRIL-JUNE 2011 
others condemn the components of the 
world to endless and pointless 
confrontations. A way of inhabiting the 
world, without putting up barriers! 
His more recent work consolidated 
his thinking about the Tout-Monde. 
Places defy national straitjackets. 
Connections defy borders. Exchange 
abolishes isolation, bringing in its wake 
a global-identity. An identity without 
cultural hierarchies, without 
imperialism, which is neither exclusive 
nor excluding, and which is able to 
accept without begrudging unexpected 
forms of creation of humanity by 
humanity! 
Because that was the issue — the 
humanization of a world that is 
conscious of and responsible for its 
diversity! 
What emerges from this work and 
this examination is its indiscipline. 
What | call ‘indiscipline’is the non- 
respect for ready-made theories, rigid 
writing, aesthetics by consensus. It has 
not been said often enough that 
Glissant’s is a philosophy of dissidence, 
of rupture. 
Breaking with European and 
Eurocentric reasoning. Breaking with 
rigid anti-colonialist reasoning. Breaking 
with notions of identity as the hostage 
of essentialism. Breaking with the 
disguised hegemony of globalization. 
Breaking with language gaps. Breaking 
with the dictatorship of imperial 
languages. Breaking, finally, with a 
certain conception of literature! 
With each break there emerges an 
adherence to other values, other ways 
of knowing, other aesthetics of writing, 
other functions of the writer and of the 
human being. 
He did not invite us to follow the 
world. He invited us to run ahead and 
wait for it where it was not heading! He 
invited us not to write but to produce a 
work of writing. He invited us not to 
look for transparency but to respect 
opacity where it appears.

### 192336: Tribute to Edouard Glissant

  
Looking more closely, he stood, 
alone, in defiance of that most deadly of 
imperialisms — a mutilated and 
mutilating vision of the world. That is 
why he refused to be confined, while 
always remaining loyal to his Martinique 
and Caribbean. 
Before him stood the vast continent 
of black identity, the sovereign empire 
of a form of western philosophy whose 
rebels he admired (like Rimbaud, 
Breton, Arthaud, Segalen, etc.). While 
refusing to be colonized, he chose to 
build his own cathedral. And in his 
honour, it was always built on the 
foundations of human emancipation, as 
can be seen with his creation of a 
research institute in Martinique, setting 
up a journal, Acoma, his constant 
devotion to the Caribbean Carbet Prize 
[Prix Carbet de la Caraibe], launching the 
Edouard Glissant prize, founding the 
Institut du Tout-Monde, etc. 
Few have really understood him! 
Many have admired him! Now the time 
has come to read him! 
To me, a writer from Guadeloupe, he 
has given the scope of his questions, the 
fervour and generosity of his responses 
and the exigency, devoid of all 
chauvinism, of living in the world. 
May he be thanked for all of this! = 
THE INDELIBLE SIGNATURE OF EDOUARD GLISSANT 
foun 
Pgh | A 
“This intermingling, [in the Caribbean] however, was not passive assent to the 
values imposed,’ claimed the Martinican writer, Edouard Glissant, in an article in 
the UNESCO Courier published in 1981 under the title “Creative contradictions, 
the Caribbean genius has given birth to a new civilization” A year later he was to 
be appointed Editor in Chief of that magazine, a post he held until 1988.“The 
Caribbean stands forth as a special setting in which nations and communities 
interrelate, each with its own originality, sharing nevertheless a common future,” 
wrote this philosopher of the universal, to whom we owe the concept of ‘Tout- 
Monde’ He defined métissage not as a simple mingling of cultures, but as a 
meeting of differences, thus helping to forge the notion of cultural diversity that 
UNESCO defends today, just as it did then. 
A few months after he took over as Editor of the UNESCO Courier, Edouard 
Glissant had published an issue entitled ‘War on war; poets of the world at 
UNESCO’ (November 1982), with contributions from internationally eminent 
writers such as Adonis, Guinsberg, Labou Tan’si, Voznesensky, to name just a few. 
Soon to follow were ‘Theatre of the World, ‘Civilizations of the Sea, “The Artistic 
Genius of Latin America; ‘The Story of the Universe'.. He had set the tone: The 
UNESCO Courier was going to establish itself as an open forum for intellectual 
debate on an international scale. This ‘mark’ of Edouard Glissant still remains 
indelibly imprinted on the pages of our magazine. — J. Sopova

To what do you attribute Saudi 
Arabia’s progress in moving toward 
the Millennium Development Goal of 
achieving universal primary 
education? 
It has always been planned with 
forethought and according to the 
country’s need. We had no problem 
asking for help from UNESCO or the 
United Nations to do some of the 
planning for us. It is our will to do so. As 
for the goal of having perfect education, 
| don't think anybody will reach it. 
Hopefully we (Saudi Arabia) have 
reached the point that we are aiming 
for, supplying efficient service to the 
nation and meeting the needs of the 
country. 
What are the prospects for giving 
Saudi education a more international 
character? 
Exchanges have always existed. If you 
go back in our educational history since 
the time of King Abdelaziz (founder of 
the kingdom in the 19th century), 
students have been sent to acquire 
specialties all over the world. It is an 
international system. | think the future is 
being made at the moment in a lot of 
areas in education. It is a very exciting 
time for us in Saudi Arabia. We have 
great examples like the King Abdullah 
University. We are concentrating on 
research now. And this is an area that 
has been given a boost by the creation 
of the King Abdullah University, which is 
based on research.

Foresight 
Youth is our 
country’s wealth 
Seeing the present as “a very exciting time” for Saudi Arabia, 
Princess Loulwah evokes youth - and not oil — as the country’s 
wealth. 
Interview by LINDA TINIO, UNESCO Bureau of Strategic Planning 
What is the role of Saudi Arabia in the 
dialogue of cultures? 
The King is the one who launched the 
whole idea of dialogue, both in Saudi 
Arabia and outside. He has been behind 
it all the way from the very beginning. 
Saudi Arabia has always believed in 
dialogue. It is very important. You 
cannot do anything without dialogue. | 
think that all the projects that the king 
has put forward, all include dialogue — 
in religion, culture, personal life, even 
the way he is doing politics... Hopefully 
everybody will follow his example. 
How do you see the future of UNESCO- 
Saudi Arabia relations? 
Collaboration with UNESCO is not only 
with the Arab Thought Foundation. 
There are many areas in which we are 
cooperating. | hope the university I'm 
responsible for (Effat College) will also 
collaborate with UNESCO. Not enough 
people have either contributed to it, or 
used the wonderful work that UNESCO 
has done for the world. The dialogue 
area is where UNESCO is well-known. 
The whole policy of Saudi Arabia is 
dialogue. I'm sure it will get better and 
better. 
What is the value of the younger 
generation today in Saudi society? 
They are our wealth. It is not the oil. 
Youth is the wealth of our country. So 
they are the people we need to 
concentrate on. | was bornina

the generations after us, we need to 
give them that opportunity to serve 
their country. m

### 192338: Universal thought: Tagore, Neruda, Césaire, poetry in the service of a new humanism

Ceésaire   Tagore, Neruda, 
| poetry in the service of 
a new humanism 
  
NOEMIE ANTONY and 
JASMINA SOPOVA 
“Even though they moved in very different cultural circles, and almost never came across 
each other in the course of their lives, the vision of these three giants of philosophy and 
poetry converged,” says Irina Bokova, Director General of UNESCO, about Rabindranath 
Tagore, Pablo Neruda and Aimé Césaire. 
The work of these three global giants of 
poetry, born, respectively, in India, Chile 
and France (Martinique), underpins a 
new UNESCO project, entitled “Tagore, 
Neruda, Césaire: for a reconciled 
universal!’ It was launched in June 2011 
with the objective of inspiring 
reflection, in both academic and artistic 
milieus, on the universal values of 
human society. 
“The idea was put forward in 2008 
by Olabiyi Babalola Joseph Yai, 
Permanent Delegate of Benin to 
UNESCO and Chairman of the 
Organization's Executive Board,” explains 
Francoise Riviere, who, at the time, was 
Assistant Director-General for Culture at 
UNESCO. “He received the backing of 
the permanent delegations of Chile, 
France and India," she adds, then sums 
up the gist of the project. “The main 
objective was to establish a link 
between these writers who have 
marked their era and the current global 
context, and to observe contemporary 
problems in the light of their work!” 
“Poetry is always like an act of 
peace. The poem is born just as 
bread is born of the flour” 
Pablo Neruda 
One of the most acute issues arising 
today, which is of particular interest to 
the project, is otherness, explains Annick 
Thébia-Melsan, one of the project's 
creators. “Our relationship with the 
other is no longer a theoretical 
question,’ says this Aimé Césaire 
specialist, who published an interview 
with the father of Negritude in the May 
1997 issue of the UNESCO Courier. “We 
have never regarded our specificity as 
the opposite or antithesis of universality 
[...]. Our concern has always been a 
humanist concern and we wanted it to 
have roots," said the poet from 
Martinique, adding “the universal is 
reached by a deeper exploration of the 
particular” 
Rabindranath Tagore had said much 
the same thing, in his own words, in a 
letter to a friend in 1921, “...but by 
nature all men are dwija or twice- 
born... first they are born to their home, 
and then, for their fulfilment, they have 
to be born to the larger world” (UNESCO 
Courier, December 1961). In a letter to 
another friend in 1934 he added 
“Individuality is precious, because only 
through it can we realize the universal” 
(UNESCO Courier, January 1994). 
And Pablo Neruda, in a lecture given 
at UNESCO in 1972, when he was 
Permanent Delegate of Chile, said “l am 
far from being an individualist — | 
believe that man is only free to the 
extent that he is a collectivist This idea 
had appeared in his 1945 poem Song to 
the Red Army on Its Arrival at the Gates of 
Prussia: “1 wanted to sing for you all, for 
the whole of the earth, this song of 
obscure words, to make us worthy of 
the light that is coming.” 
Other areas of convergence have 
been identified within the “Tagore, 
Neruda, Césaire: for a reconciled 
universal” project, which aims to 
stimulate thinking on five subjects in 
particular: — poetry as mediator 
between man and the world; a new pact 
between humanity and nature; 
emancipation versus all forms of 
oppression; a certain vision of the 
relationships between science, 
knowledge and ethics; and the 
educational heritage of these three 
writers. UNESCO is also setting up a 
sponsoring committee made up of 
academics, scientists and artists whose 
task will be to oversee the development 
of the project and to help establish a 
network for research and the exchange 
of ideas. “A whole network of partners 
has been established to implement this 
project,” explains Edmond Moukala, the 
programme’s coordinator. “We have 
established links with universities, 
research centres, NGOs, non-profit 
associations, festivals as well as the 
media, to plan conferences and 
exhibitions and to encourage scientific 
research projects and documentary 
films.” 
“The revolution in Martinique 
will be made in the name of 
bread, of course, but also in the 
name of the air and poetry” 
Aimé Césaire

### 192338: Universal thought: Tagore, Neruda, Césaire, poetry in the service of a new humanism

  
  
As socially committed writers who 
have helped make history, 
Rabindranath Tagore, Pablo Neruda and 
Aimé Césaire shared a vision of the 
world that was both humanist and 
poetic. The task of this project, 
dedicated to them, is to challenge 
minds in the contemporary world to 
think about what humanism means 
today. A task defined subtly by the 
Haitian poet René Depestre: “This 
expedition should lead us from the 
homes of each of the three authors 
towards other cultural areas and to a 
whole, unified universe! m
