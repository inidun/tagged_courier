### 102556: Henri Atlan: the frontiers of science

Henri Atlan 
The frontiers of science 
The French biologist Henri Atlan, 
professor of biophysics at the 
University of Paris VI and at the 
Hebrew University of Jerusalem, has 
won an international reputation for 
his research on the self-organization of 
cells and artificial intelligence. 
Notable among his published works 
are Entre le cristal et la fumee, Essai 
sur organisation du vivant (Seuil, 
Paris, 1979), A tort et a raison, 
Intercritique de la science et du mythe 
(Seuil, Paris, 1986), L’Organisation 
biologique et la théorie de 
l'information (Hermann, Paris, 1992) 
and Questions de vie, Entre le savoir 
et opinion (Seuil, Paris, 1994). 
Here he talks to Géraldine Schimmel 
about some topical matters arising 
from the relationship between science 
and society. 
  
Hl Science was vested with an 
immense hope that it would explain 
everything, help people to live, and 
provide a basis for ethics. How do 
things stand today? 
Henri Atlan: It is now clear to most sci- 
entists that this hope is groundless. 
Unlike the religions, ideologies and 
philosophies that claim to give meaning 
to the universe and to people’s lives, sci- 
ence owes its successes to its method, 
which involves carefully circumscribing 
a subject for study and contenting itself 
with local explanations that hold good in 
a certain well defined field. Science and 
technology have been effective in domi- 
nating matter, but unable to give meaning 
to life or solve social, political or moral 
problems. There is still a nostalgic hope 
that science may provide us with Truth 
with a capital T, a single truth from 
which it will then deduce individual, 
social, political or some other form of 
Good; but this is simply nostalgia. 
HB An illusion? 
H. A.: Of course. A piece of nostalgia 
based on the illusion of a universal 
theory that would explain everything, 
things as they are and as they ought to 
interview 
be. This is what is known in English as 
the naturalistic fallacy, deducing what 
“ought to be” from what “is”. “What 
ought to be” is actually the product of 
our imagination and of our desires, and 
is not usually deducible from “what is”. 
Knowledge of “what is” enables us to 
realize the constraints that impose 
limits on our imagination, limits which it 
is usually impossible to transgress. 
Bl Are science on the one hand and 
myths and religions on the other based 
on the same rationality? 
H. A.: Not at all. In my book 4 tort et a 
raison I tried to demonstrate that there 
are several sorts of rationality—something 
which is not self-evident. Many people still 
believe that only science is rational, and 
that what is not scientific is necessarily 
irrational. But every myth expresses, in its 
own way, a kind of rationality which is dif- 
ferent—in terms of its method, its objec- 
tives and its means of verification—from 
that of scientific thought. It is wrong to 
get them mixed up. The same reason is 
involved, but the ways in which it is 
applied are different. 
BH You have said that the real 
generator of objective knowledge is 
It is wrong to think that only science is rational. Every 
myth expresses a kind of rationality which is different 
§ from that developed by scientific thought.

### 102556: Henri Atlan: the frontiers of science

H enri Atlan at a UNesco 
Philosophy Forum on the 
theme “What We Do Not 
Know" (Paris, March 1995). 
mastery of nature and that ethics is 
the motor of mystical and religious 
traditions. What happens when ethics 
is required to deal with objective 
knowledge? 
H. A.: That is a quite straightforward 
matter. It’s the reverse situation that 
raises problems. It is indispensable that 
ethics should be concerned with the use 
made of science-based technology, 
insofar as technology raises moral ques- 
tions that the sciences are unable to 
answer. Let’s take an example from the 
field of biomedical ethics: is the real 
mother the woman who carries the child 
or the one who supplied the egg that is 
fertilized and then implanted? This 
question did not arise before technology 
made it possible to separate the uterine 
and ovarian aspects of maternity. In this 
field the progress of science and tech- 
nology has created problems—of legiti- 
macy, of good and evil, of what is per- 
mitted and what is not—that did not 
exist before and that neither biology nor 
medicine alone can solve. 
HB You have rejected the term 
‘bioethics’. Why? 
H. A.: 1 don’t like the term because it 
implies the existence of a new discipline 
derived from biology, rather like bio- 
physics or biochemistry, and suggests 
that via bioethics it may be possible to 
find, within biology itself, the answers 
to the ethical problems posed by 
biology. But this is not at all the case. 
 
Biology poses problems of an ethical 
nature, but it does not solve them, even 
if it is clear that we cannot begin to 
tackle them without an understanding 
of their biological roots. Solutions will 
result from different ethical 
approaches that vary from person to 
person and culture to culture. These 
problems are so new that people 
belonging to the same tradition often 
respond spontaneously to them in totally 
different ways. 
Bl Is thinking about the problems 
posed by new scientific discoveries 
exclusively a matter for specialists? 
H. A.: Certainly not. It is vitally impor-   
tant that questions about the rights or 
wrongs of using a given biological tech- 
nique should be asked by people out- 
side the field who have a broader, non- 
partisan approach to it. In fact this is 
increasingly being done by so-called bio- 
medical ethics committees. The mem- 
bers of these committees include 
experts who explain to the best of their 
ability the scientific background of the 
problems, but also philosophers, reli- 
gious leaders, sociologists, psychologists 
and especially legal experts, who—even 
though their answers are, perforce, 
fragmentary and incomplete—have to 
give an opinion on what is permissible 
and what is not.

interview 
  
Hl What about the general public? 
H. A.: They are faced with two prob- 
lems. On the one hand, biologists don’t 
have a big platform on which to make 
their science known. On the other, the 
media present problems in a way that is 
inevitably incomplete and sometimes 
biased. The general public is forced to 
decipher a confused message which 
reflects a debate between specialists fil- 
tered through the media, which try to 
explain to their audience the issues 
involved in complex questions to which 
there are no simple, ready-made 
answers. 
Bl Do you think that fear about 
advances in genetics is justified? 
H. A.: It depends on what kind of fear 
you are talking about. Abuses are 
always possible, but they existed before 
advances in genetics. Don’t forget that 
the most horrible eugenic policies this 
century were implemented by the Nazis 
without the help of genetics. Tech- 
nology is not necessarily dangerous in 
itself. Its application can be, however, 
if it is left to the discretion of criminals. 
This is one of the reasons why a min- 
imum of legislation is necessary. 
Applying to human beings some of the 
genetic techniques that are applied to 
animals (making chimeras, transgenic 
individuals whose genome is modified in 
such a way that it is largely impossible

sc
o 
to know what will come from it) is obvi- 
ously criminal. This must be made quite 
clear, so that no geneticists should feel 
authorized to go in for such practices. 
In any case almost all geneticists 
agree that a clear distinction should be 
made between therapeutic activities in 
which the genes of somatic cells (the 
body’s non-reproductive cells) are mod- 
ified, and activities designed to modify 
the genes of germ cells (cells trans- 
mitted to descendants). The difference 
is enormous: modifying the genes of 
somatic cells is no more dangerous than, 
for example, x-ray therapy. Treating a 
cancer with x-rays entails a lot of muta- 
tion of cells, but not of germ cells. Most 
ethics committees have completely for- 
bidden the use of gene therapy on germ 
cells. But how can we be sure that this 
prohibition will be maintained unchanged 
in future? 
Hl Does the same prohibition also 
apply to disease-bearing germ cells? 
H. A.: At present it is strictly forbidden 
to try to manipulate sperm, ova and fer- 
tilized eggs to replace disease-bearing 
genes with normal genes because, | must 
stress, cells transmitted to descendants 
are involved. A very important distinc- 
tion must be made about the purpose 
of genetic techniques. Are we trying to 
treat a person with a specific disease or 
are we trying to modify the human 
species? Insofar as we are dealing with 
individual therapy, classical standards 
of medical practice and biomedical 
ethics that are now developing make it 
possible to distinguish, sometimes on a 
case-by-case basis, between what is and 
what is not allowed. But imagining that 
we are going to modify humanity is the 
same irresponsible fantasy that has been 
at the root of all eugenic disasters. 
B Can standards of ethical 
practice, ethics committees and 
legislation slow up research and 
development? 
H. A.: Some people think they should. I 
don’t agree with that at all. In any case 
it would be impossible. First of all 
because as soon as you know something, 
you can no longer behave as if you didn’t 
know it. Secondly, because it is impos- 
sible to know in advance what results a 
research programme is going to lead to. 
Research programmes can’t be stopped 
on the pretext that they may be dan- 
gerous. Obviously it is always possible 
to stop certain specific applied research 
programmes that do not come under the 
heading of basic research. But that is 
not the same thing as putting a brake 
on research or halting scientific 
progress. The ban on applying certain 
research techniques to human beings 
has always existed; implicitly before the 
Second World War, and explicitly after 
the trial of Nazi criminal doctors at 
Nuremberg. That was when biomedical 
ethics began to be established. 
Hl The Nobel Prize-winner Albert 
Szent-Gyorgyi once claimed that ‘life 
as such does not exist’?1 Wasn't that 
a strange thing for a biologist to say? 
H. A.: He said that at the beginning of 
the century, but it’s even more obvious 
today. It simply means that life does not 
exist as an object for biological research. 
Biologists today are not preoccupied

The progress of science and technology has created 
problems that did not exist before and that neither 
biology nor medicine alone can solve.

with knowing what life is. They study 
systems, organisms, and try to under- 
stand how they work, i.e. the physical- 
chemical mechanisms of what structures 
them and of what they do. This being the 
case, life has completely disappeared as 
a subject of research for this science that 
is still called the science of life! —but 
this does not mean that it no longer 
exists. It is still a matter of subjective 
experience: it’s our life. But it no longer 
has anything to do with biology. 
HB What difference is there, then, from 
a biological point of view, between a 
living being and a dead one? Between 
the animate and the inanimate? 
H. A.: From a physical-chemical point 
of view it’s merely a change of state. 
The same applies to the soul, which is 
no longer a subject of scientific 
research. In the past these two notions 
were inextricably linked: a living being 
was living because of having a soul that 
bestowed that particular quality. This 
idea goes back to Aristotle. It domi- 
nated the West until the Renaissance, 
but has now disappeared. 
BB In the view of scientists, what role 
does chance play in the organization 
of nature? 
H. A.: When we study systems that are 
not simple (living organisms, some phys- 
ical systems and interlocking chemical 
reactions, for instance) we can see— 
since we don’t know everything about 
them—that the best way to understand 
and achieve even a very slight measure 
of control over them is to take this igno- 
rance into account. Chance appears in 
the form of phenomena that arise at 
random. For example, the evolution of 
species is considered to be an effect of 
genetic mutations supposedly occurring 
by chance in individuals. This does not 
mean that the mutations do not have 
causes. They do have causes, in fact, 
some of which we know fairly well: 
cosmic radiation, natural (or artificial) 
Imagining that we are going to modify the human 
species is an irresponsible fantasy that has been at the 
root of all eugenic disasters. 
radioactivity and exposure to chemical 
substances that exist in nature or are 
even stored in specific kinds of waste. 
Mutations always have physical causes. 
The only random element has to do with 
their possible effect on an organism; in 
other words, there is no link between 
the cause of a mutation and the change 
it will effect in the functioning of the 
organism in question. 
HB What is self-organization? 
H. A.: The classic example is that of a 
hen’s egg. When you look at an egg, it 
doesn’t seem very complicated. Even 
when you examine it under a microscope 
you find it only consists of one cell. But 
the chicken that will emerge from it will 
consist of a large number of cells that 
are very different from one other. 
The same principle applies to the 
development of species. All palaeonto- 
logical data show that we began with 
relatively simple, single-cell organisms, 
like seaweed or paramecia. Multi-cell 
organisms appeared much later, but 
they were still fairly simple with 
roughly similar cells. Then more com- 
plex organisms began appearing with 
diversified cells performing different 
functions. 
What we have to understand is how 
a piece of matter that appears poorly 
organized to us—rightly or wrongly— 
can evolve using its own properties to a 
more complex state of organization. 
Vitalist theories said it was the life 
force. The French philosopher Henri 
Bergson himself said that the organiza- 
tion of living organisms was explained by 
what he called an “élan vital”. But now 
that this kind of explanation is no longer 
accepted, we have to find a physical 
theory capable of describing these self- 
organizing mechanisms. This is where 
chance comes into it. It seems to play a 
positive role in the sense that it may 
permit a state of things to be modified 
in the direction of greater organization. 
In the past chance was thought to be 
nothing but a source of disorganization. 
But certain factors that can only be con- 
sidered as random, as the product of 
chance, may on the contrary encourage 
the appearance of more organized 
states. There is nothing magical about 
this. To call something “chance” is only 
a way of formalizing factors we are igno- 
rant of. 
But this is only a summary descrip- 
tion of one possible form of self-organi- 
zation. There are many others which 
use computer models that enable us to 
study how complex forms and functions 
can be produced by interconnected net- 
works of simple elements. 
lB Has chance replaced the magic of 
the Middle Ages? 
H. A.: Not at all. We're talking about 
chance which is formalized and tamed, 
and thus forms part of laws—laws of 
probability that are decisive. 
Hl Is there any order in nature? 
H. A.: Undoubtedly; and probably more 
than one. But the person who could tell 
us about it would need to be very bright 
indeed. Science is trying to discover cer- 
tain regularities that look like order. H

Each month since I have been receiving the 
UNESCO Courier 1 feel more closely involved in 
all that is happening in the world; I feel that 
the whole world is my home. I received my sub- 
scription from a donor as part of your Opera- 
tion Solidarity campaign, and I am writing to 
encourage you to continue this excellent ini- 
tiative and to thank the person who took out 
my subscription. I hope Operation Solidarity 
will go on so that people like me, who cannot 
afford to subscribe, may continue to enjoy your

HUNTERS—A PROTECTED SPECIES? 
I was unpleasantly surprised to find a short 
news item entitled “Hunters—a much- 
maligned species” in the Greenwatch section 
of the October 1995 issue (“The United 
Nations, Why it matters”). I fail to see why the 
proliferation of hunted animals should be big 
news, nor how the proliferation of some species 
(even if hunters are indirectly responsible) can 
be considered a positive sign of the health of 
the environment. In general it seems to me 
that, on the contrary, it is a sign of an imbal- 
ance—albeit one that hunters hasten to cor- 
rect! I trust that this will be nothing more than

What is a news item in favour of hunting doing 
in the Greenwatch section of your October 
1995 issue? Certainly the text is carefully 
worded and expresses certain reservations, but 
the message that will stay in people’s minds is 
that hunters protect nature. I would suggest 
that nature cannot be protected by people 
wielding guns. The ecological balance is not 
aided by reintroducing species that are “inter- 
esting” to hunt. The real balance is infinitely 
more complex and is not limited to deer and 
elk. I hope the UNESCO Courier will be more 
careful in what it says about this topic in 
future and will not make excuses, however 
unintentional, for hunters.

   “onth by month 
In one sense this issue on racism is a follow-up to last month’s number devoted to the mechanisms 
of complex thought. The astonishing advances of genetics are a new reminder of the need to think 
in complex terms, of how dangerous it is to make do with simple explanations, to float on the sur- 
face, confuse the foam on the billows with the depths of the ocean. 
A day rarely seems to go by without the announcement that scientists have discovered genes 
that trigger diseases such as certain cancers and cardio-vascular ailments, and conditions such as 
obesity. One gene may even predispose people to suicide; another to a spirit of innovation. 
Such news items report on highly complex scientific research that may one day lead to major 
breakthroughs in technology and therapy. When they are presented in oversimplified form to hun- 
dreds of millions of non-specialized readers or televiewers, they may have a grossly misleading 
effect. Instead of regarding the gene as one key among others to the mystery of life, many people 
come to believe that genetics can explain everything. The impression spreads that we are pro- 
grammed—even before birth—to possess certain qualities and certain defects, perhaps even a 
predisposition to good or evil. 
As well as attaching excessive preponderance to nature over nurture, this approach leads to 
a perfidious mixture of value judgements and clinical observations. A potential defect comes to be 
regarded as inevitable. A weak point is magnified into total infirmity. This deviation towards sim- 
plistic determinism is bad enough when it leads to the establishment of hierarchies and of inequal- 
ities between individuals. It becomes criminal when it seeks to define classes of people which are 
inherently endowed with a certain weakness or a certain token of superiority. Genetics is not at fault 
here, but it may, like Darwinism in the late nineteenth century and biology early in the twentieth, 
serve as a new pretext on which to base old prejudices. 
We are living at a time when racism is again rising from its ashes and manifesting a virulence 
and pervasiveness that we hoped had disappeared at the end of the Second World War. This is why 
we have thought it necessary to go to the roots of this evil phenomenon, to the obscure origins of 
racism, to the enigma that underlies it and perpetuates it in various guises in different times and 
places. 
What causes racism to appear and reappear? 
One contributor to this issue, French sociologist Michel Wieviorka, suggests that racism is a 
corollary of modernity, and that its resurgence is a result of the collision hetween economic glob- 
alization and cultural individualism. Etienne Balibar argues that it is a fearsome instrument of col- 
lective identification, the evolution of which often goes hand in hand with modes of social domina- 
tion. American sociologist Stephen Steinberg believes that only interventionist policies can shake 
the structures in which discrimination is enmeshed. Geneticist Albert Jacquard reminds us that 
however often science exposes the alleged “scientific” justifications of racism, racism continues to 
feed on our fears and repressions. 
We also publish excerpts from landmark texts by Elias Canetti and Claude Lévi-Strauss to round 
off our analysis of an evil that Gandhi once admitted was for him a “mystery”.

### 102557: The Seeds of hate

The seeds of hate 
by Michel Wieviorka 
Crisis in the modern world is fanning the embers of 
racism and nationalism 
An elderly woman with the

4 In the wake of the Second World War 
“%5% and, later, of decolonization, Western 
societies had reason to believe that racism in 
their countries would gradually fade away. 
After the discovery of the Nazi concentration 
camps and gas chambers, antisemitism could 
no longer be regarded as a matter of opinion; it 
had become a crime and a taboo. Colonial 
racism ceased to have any justification when 
colonized peoples achieved independence. 
The modern age beckoned, and nothing 
seemed likely to halt the march of progress.

Then, in the early 1970s, the situation 
altered radically. The idea that political and 
economic change would lead towards more 
and more growth and democracy and less 
and less poverty, racism and anti-semitism 
began to run out of steam. 
The first signs of this reversal appeared in 
the United Kingdom in the late 1960s when 
Enoch Powell criticized current immigration 
policy in the name of English nationalism, and 
when the National Front movement emerged. 
During the 1980s, racism, xenophobia and 
anti-semitism became features, often central 
features, of political life in most European 
nations. 
  
A rising tide 
Today, the situation is particularly disturbing. 
A number of studies and surveys have 
shown that racial discrimination in employ- 
ment and housing has become widespread in 
the United Kingdom. There has been an 
upsurge in racist violence, mainly in towns 
and cities but also in rural areas. In France, 
where public opinion polls reveal growing 
race prejudice and racialist attitudes, the most 
conspicuous sign of racism has been the rise 
of a populist nationalist party, the Front 
National, which has scored considerable suc- 
cess in elections since 1983. The party gives 
shape to popular feelings in which racism, 
more than antisemitism, has an important 
place. In France, a country where racist vio- 
lence is limited in extent, race discrimination 
is a less central issue than that of social and 
ethnic exclusion. The French experience is 
different from that of Britain, where there is 
little specifically political expression of racism. 
Racism in the former Federal Republic of 
Germany took real but limited form in xeno- 
phobic campaigns linked to economic down- 
turns in 1966-1967 and 1974 and in the treat- 
ment of Turkish immigrants. The situation 
changed radically with reunification. After

the bombing of a hostel for immigrant 
workers in Hoyerswerda in September 1992 
a wave of violence swept through the former 
German Democratic Republic and then 
spread throughout the country. In this case 
the violence had more to do with xenophobia 
than with racism and involved groups of 
skinheads or neo-Nazis. At the same time 
anti-semitism gained some ground, and 
Jewish cemeteries were desecrated. Racism, 
xenophobia and anti-semitism also had a 
political impact as extreme right-wing groups 
did well in elections. This breakthrough was 
not however followed up in elections in the 
mid-1990s. 
In Italy, whose traditional non-racist cre- 
dentials include the reluctance of the fascist 
regime to take its cue from Nazi anti-semi- 
tism, racism has been a subject of concern to 
the media and intellectuals since the early 
1990s. Racism exists on a very limited scale in 
what was for many years a country of emi- 
gration but has now become a country of 
immigration. It mainly consists of social ten- 
sions due to dislocation of the urban fabric 
where there are large numbers of immigrants, 
or to economic competition from immi- 
grants on the clandestine job market, in door- 
to-door trading or in illegal trafficking, espe- 
cially in drugs. It gets more exposure in the 
media than in politics. Anti-immigrant racism 
was only a minor plank in the platform of the 
populist Leagues of northern Italy during 
their ascendancy in the early 1990s. It would 
be misleading to compare these movements 
with the French Front National, for instance. 
In Belgium, on the other hand, racism is 
above all political and institutional. There is 
very little violence, but extreme right-wing 
parties are growing, especially the Flemish 
Vlaams Blok party, whose focus on intercom- 
munity differences is largely shaped by the 
crisis of the state and Belgian national identity 
as well as by tensions between the Flemish and 
Walloon communities and Brussels. 
This review of the situation in individual 
European countries could be taken further. 
The essential point, however, is that we are 
dealing with a problem whose common fea- 
tures transcend differences in the ways in

Crumbling structures 
Throughout Western Europe the structure of 
situations that had been relatively stable until 
the 1970s is tending to change. European 
societies were industrial societies with strong 
labour movements that played a central role 
in social, political, cultural and intellectual life. 
Now these societies have entered the post- 
industrial era and their labour movements 
have split up and atrophied. They have lost 
the power to set the agenda of debate on the 
main social and political issues. Germany is no 
exception to this rule. Reunification posed 
serious problems to the German unions, 
which had stood up to the crisis in trade 
unionism more successfully than their coun- 
terparts elsewhere in Europe. 
The problems of exclusion and social and 
economic polarization have become a major 
source of concern, and racism has found a 
new breeding ground. On the one hand the 
“poor whites”, who are victims of social 
change or afraid of becoming so, regard

immigrants as scapegoats. They act as if their 
own exclusion and social decline were the 
fault of immigrants, whose situation, more- 
over, they often share. On the other hand, 
people on the “right” side of the social divide 
act individually or collectively in ways that 
amount to building social and racial barriers 
to keep at arm’s length the “dangerous” 
classes, to which the immigrants are widely 
considered to belong. 
Throughout this century the European 
nations have developed welfare-state policies 
in an attempt to promote equality of oppor- 
tunity and the redistribution of social 
resources. These policies have been under 
fire since the 1970s, primarily for economic 
reasons. The intensification of market com- 
petition combined with the globalization of 
the economy and the internationalization of 
business are increasing the cost of welfare 
policies to a prohibitive degree, especially at a 
time when the ranks of the unemployed are 
swelling and society is ageing. 
In these circumstances, neo-liberalism 
made constant headway during the 1980s 
while social democrat-style approaches fell 
by the wayside. This explains the resentment 
and in many cases the populism of those who 
feel abandoned by the state and ignored and 
betrayed by the politicians. Once again these 
people think that they lose out to the immi- 
grants, who abuse public institutions to the 
detriment of native-born citizens. 
The question of identity has been a major 
preoccupation in Europe since the 1970s. 
There have been widespread appeals to spe- 
cific allegiances. On the one hand, regional, 
religious and community loyalties have given 
a certain weight to the notion of ethnicity. On

the other, manifestations of a tense and anx- 
ious nationalism have reflected varying 
degrees of xenophobia and racism and have 
been more intent on isolating nations from 
the outside world than opening them up to 
the universalist values of reason and democ- 
racy. These forms of nationalism usually 
reflect the feeling that national identity or cul- 
ture are threatened. They accuse Jews and 
Gypsies, as well as immigrants, with being the 
perpetrators of a cultural invasion, and they 
point to the intransigent nature of their cul- 
ture or religion. In this situation, racism 
becomes cultural. 
  
A sombre outlook 
This leads us to the hypothesis that we have 
entered a new era of European racism, con- 
current with the triumph of modernity. It 
may take the form of a universalism that 
sought to subjugate colonized peoples and 
destroy them if they resisted, or to dominate 
and exploit them whilst allowing them to join 
the march of progress via the back door. It 
may take the form of a “differentialism” that 
regarded the Jews in particular as the symbol 
of the most controversial aspects of moder- 
nity—the cosmopolitanism of money and 
power, and even socialism and revolution. 
Racism and anti-semitism faded into the 
background with the formation of national 
political frameworks which created the condi- 
tions, especially through education, for eco- 
nomic modernization and industrialization, 
expansion and cultural integration. Today these 
frameworks are disintegrating. Economic 
activity is taking place in an international con- 
text and more often than not seems at odds 
with the nation-state; institutions are col- 
lapsing; racism, xenophobia and anti-semitism 
are re-emerging in societies that find it increas- 
ingly difficult to connect the values of reason 
and economic progress with those of cultural 
and national individuality. = 
When nationalists accuse immigrants, 
Jews and Gypsies of perpetrating a 
cultural invasion, racism becomes 
cultural.

#" The term “racism” seems to have been 
“+ introduced into the English language in 
1938 1n a translation of a book by the German 
writer Magnus Hirschfeld which had appeared 
in German four or five years earlier and 
described the “racial theory” that underlay 
Hitler's conception of a war between races. The 
word thus seems to have been coined in Ger- 
many to describe the racism of the Nazi state, 
which was targeted primarily against the Jews 
but also against other “sub-human” peoples and 
groups and was based on the Aryan myth. In 
due course it came to acquire its internationally 
accepted meaning as a prejudice based on belief 
in the congenital inequality of human groups. 
Pierre- André Taguieff, a French philoso- 
pher who has made an exhaustive study of the 
question, has discovered what he calls two 
“totally distinct appearances” of the word 
“racism” in France. The first, relatively 
episodic use of the word occurred between 
1895 and 1897 and was connected with the 
founding of the authoritarian ultra-nationalist 
organization, Action Francaise, and of an 
extreme right-wing nationalist newspaper, La 
Libre Parole. The supporters of this move- 
 
by Etienne Balibar 
ment, which actively propagated anti-semitism 
in France and also had close ties with colonial 
circles, described themselves as “racists”, rep- 
resentatives of a “French race” that was to be 
preserved from degeneration. Then, between 
1925 and 1935 the terms “racisme” and “raciste” 
made a come-back in France but this time were 
used in a broader sense to designate the doc- 
trine of German fascism, and to translate its key 
adjective, “vélkisch”. 
After the Second World War this second 
meaning and the accepted English usage of the 
word racism came to overlap. But in France 
the reference to nationalism was still of deci- 
sive importance, for attempts to stigmatize 
German-style “racism” were entirely orga- 
nized around its difference from French-style 
“nationalism”. The latter was presented as 
“universalist” and was regarded as having a 
“cultural” basis that was quite alien to the Ger- 
manic “naturalist” tradition, propped up by 
belief in the supposed biological immutability 
of “races”. An ideology based on xenophobia 
and essentialism may thus lie at the roots of 
antiracism in France.

### 102558: Racism and anti-racism

An ambivalent doctrine 
This reasoning, which I have here simplified to 
an extreme degree, has shown up the ambiva- 
lence which may to some extent be character- 
istic of both anti-racist and racist thinking. The 
ambivalence of racism is manifest in the fact that 
it is based both on idealization of oneself 
(“master race”) and on denigration of others as 
“degenerate”, “sub-human” or “primitive”. It 
also appears in the relationship of racism to uni- 
versalism. Racism which heightens in a quasi- 
mystical fashion the illusion of the absolute 
uniqueness and superiority of a nation or group 
of nations that believe themselves to have been 
“chosen” paradoxically coincides with univer- 
salism when it attempts to set this supremacy 
in a context of universal history or natural evo- 
lution of all humanity. 
It should not be surprising, then, that anti- 
racism, which also exists in the context of 
nationalism—the dominant state ideology of 
our era—should sometimes manifest a sim- 
ilar ambivalence. What is true of the French 
condemnation of “German racism” in a cli- 
  
‘Races’ do not exist, but the word ‘race’ has been for an entire 
age the pivot of a vision of history and a confrontation between 
different outlooks on the world. 
mate of nationalistic revenge is equally true of 
the condemnation of Nazism by the victors 
of the Second World War and of the con- 
demnation of colonial racism by certain 
national liberation movements. 
The notion of “race” has such a wide range 
of meanings that it can be used in many dif- 
ferent contexts. “Races” do not exist, but the 
word “race” has been for an entire age the pivot 
of a vision of history and a confrontation 
between different outlooks on the world. 
While the meaning of certain words may have 
shifted as historical circumstances have 
changed, these changes of meaning have arisen 
from the same questioning about the relation- 
ship between biological heredity and cultural 
specificity that is suggested by the term “race”.

### 102558: Racism and anti-racism

Historically speaking, there is not a single racism but several 
successive ideological configurations, bound up with the conflicts 
of cultures and violent political practices.

ETIENNE BALIBAR, 
of France, is professor of moral 
philosophy and politics at the 
University of Paris X-Nanterre. 
Among his works published in 
English are Race, Nation and Class 
(London, 1991) and Masses, 
Classes, Ideas: Studies in Politics 
and Philosophy (New York, 1994). 
  
This questioning may seem to have disap- 
peared today but in all likelihood it has only 
moved to different terms. 
  
The origins of 
modern racism 
The history and critique of “racism” have lost 
their innocence. Since they are themselves 
historically and ideologically determined, they 
must face the blinding and retaliatory effects of 
the very language they use. 
At the time when a standard definition of 
racism was taking shape, two important 
debates were underway. One centred on the 
relationship between “racism” and “anti- 
semitism”, the other on the circumstances in 
which the specifically modern form of 
“racism” emerged. The first debate is far from 
over, but the second has given rise to a broad 
consensus that modern racism emerged in the 
late fifteenth century around the time when 
the Americas were “discovered”. This was the 
starting point of the Europeanization of the 
world, and also of the formation of absolute 
monarchies (embryonic national states), the 
secularization of anti-semitism and the taming 
of aristocracies that would develop the ide- 
ology of the “purity of blood”. 
I am tempted to adopt the methodology 
of the current debate about the notion of 
“racism”. A single racism did not appear in 
the West at one moment in history and dis- 
appear at another. There are several succes- 
sive ideological configurations, closely bound 
up with conflicts between cultures and with 
the political practice of violence (particularly 
state violence). Each of these configurations 
expresses the tensions and internal antago- 
nisms of a far-reaching attempt to achieve 
world domination: the Roman Empire, 
Christianity, European expansion, nation- 
alism, the global market and, tomorrow per- 
haps, the “new international order”. 
Each configuration leaves a trace that goes 
into the makeup of a new “racism”, which is 
thus always a “neo-racism”. Thus there have 
been transitions from theological anti- 
Judaism to secular anti-semitism, from bio- 
logical racism to cultural racism, and from 
colonial violence to post-colonial discrimina- 
tion against people from the “South”. 
Whether we like it or not, this is probably 
due to the fact that schemes for domination 
and discrimination (internal exclusion) are 
powerful tools for the identification of one- 
self and others, and thus of historical and col- 
lective memory. 
The ambivalences and theoretical weak- 
nesses of anti-racism obviously do not cast 
doubt on the need to combat racism. Just as 
the fluctuations of racist doctrine justifying 
discrimination and segregation cannot con- 
ceal the similarities between all these prac- 
tices, so the continuity of anti-racism in every 
era is based on a perception of the intolerable 
inhumanity of racism and on its patent 
incompatibility with freedom. -

### 102559: The Affirmative action debate

The affirmative 
   
    
  
action debate 
      
by Stephen Steinberg 
Inthe U.S.A. government action to combat 
workplace discrimination against minorities faces 
growing criticism 
Above, wartime women 
workers keep a locomotive of 
the Pennsylvania Railroad 
spick and span (1943). 
¢ The civil rights revolution in the United    Abr States was primarily a struggle for liberty, 
not equality. It sought to dismantle the system 
of official segregation that had been erected in 
the aftermath of slavery and to secure full rights 
of citizenship for African Americans. The 
abiding faith of the movement was that once 
the walls of segregation came tumbling down, 
blacks would be free to assume their rightful 
place in American society. 
No sooner were the historic Civil Rights 
Acts of 1964 and 1965 passed, however, than 
it became clear that legislation alone would 
not address the deep-seated inequalities that 
were the legacy of two centuries of slavery 
and another century of Jim Crow. This was 
acknowledged by President Lyndon Johnson 
in a commencement address at Howard Uni- 
versity in Washington, D.C., in June 1965, the 
very month that the Voting Rights Act 
received Congressional approval. As he told 
the graduating class: 
“Freedom is not enough. You do not 
wipe away the scars of centuries by saying: 
‘Now you are free to go where you want, do 
as you desire, choose the leaders you please.’

been hobbled by chains and liberate him, 
bring him to the starting line and then say, 
“You are free to compete with all the others,’ 
and still justly believe that you have been 
completely fair. We seek not just freedom but 
opportunity, not just equality as a right and a 
theory but equality as a fact and as a result.” 
Passive and active policies 
Johnson’s oratory was punctuated by the out- 
break of racial violence in the Watts section of 
Los Angeles only two months later. In the 
ensuing years there were scores of other 
“riots” that threw American society into a 
deep political crisis, one that forced the nation 
to confront the issue of equality as well as lib- 
erty. This is the historical context in which 
affirmative action evolved as national policy. 
Affirmative action has never been formu- 
lated as a coherent policy, but evolved incre- 
mentally through a series of presidential exec- 
utive orders, administrative policies and 
court decisions. Partly for this reason, the 
term itself is so fraught with ambiguity that it 
is not always clear what advocates and oppo- 
nents are squabbling about. Let us therefore 
make several crucial distinctions. 
First, affirmative action must be distin- 
guished from policies of non-discrimination. 
Although both seek racial justice in the work- 
place, policies of non-discrimination merely 
enjoin employers not to practise discrimina- 
tion in the recruitment, hiring and promotion 
of workers. It is essentially a passive injunc- 
tion not to discriminate. Affirmative action, 
on the other hand, commits employers to go

Executive Order requiring federal 
contractors to take ‘affirmative action’

a decisive step beyond non-discrimination 
and to actively seek out protected groups in 
employment. In this form—essentially “out- 
reach” programmes reliant on the good faith 
efforts of employers—affirmative action 
arouses little or no opposition. 
There is another form of affirmative action, 
however, that goes a decisive step beyond out- 
reach and involves granting “preference” to 
minority applicants in order to guarantee the 
desired result. This is where controversy 
begins. For example, in his confirmation hear- 
ings to the Supreme Court in 1991, Clarence 
Thomas spoke passionately of his support for 
outreach programmes to extend opportunity 
to women and minorities, but he was equally 
adamant in his opposition to affirmative action 
programmes that involve preference. 
These three forms of anti-discrimination 
are not mere abstractions, but are anchored 
in history. Let us briefly review how social 
policy evolved from non-discrimination, to 
outreach, to preference. 
Occupational apartheid 
Africans were originally imported to the 
United States to provide labour in the South’s 
evolving plantation economy. In the century 
after slavery, when tens of millions of immi- 
grants from Europe were rapidly absorbed 
into the North’s burgeoning industries, a 
colour line excluded blacks from employ- 
ment in the entire industrial sector, with the 
exception of a few menial and low-paying 
jobs. When the Southern economy finally 
underwent modernization, blacks were still 
confined to “negro jobs”—servile and unde- 
sirable jobs that were reminiscent of slavery 
itself. As late as the 1960s, even as the civil 
rights movement reached its triumphant 
climax, the United States had, in effect, a 
system of occupational apartheid that 
excluded blacks from entire job sectors. Most 
black men worked as unskilled labourers; 
most black women as low-level service 
workers, especially domestics.

### 102559: The Affirmative action debate

This racial division of labour went virtu- 
ally unchallenged until the Second World 
War, when the black union leader A. Philip 
Randolph threatened a march on Washington 
unless blacks were given access to jobs in 
defence industries. This also led to the estab- 
lishment of a Fair Employment Practices 
Committee. Even though the FEPC had few 
resources and virtually no power to enforce 
non-discrimination, it was quickly engulfed 
in controversy and disbanded as soon as the 
war was over. Here was an early sign that 
attempts to enforce compliance with non- 
discriminatory policies would encounter 
enormous resistance. 
In the 1940s and 1950s a second FEPC, 
along with other federal and state agencies, 
preached non-discrimination, but with 
meagre results at best. Indeed, this is pre- 
cisely what eventually led to a shift from non- 
discrimination to affirmative action. A major 
turning point occurred in 1961 when Presi- 
dent John EF. Kennedy, again in response to 
rising protest from the black community, 
issued Executive Order 10925, which 
required federal contractors to take “affirma- 
tive action” to desegregate their work force. 
Unlike similar declarations in the past, the 
presidential edict established specific sanc- 
  
   
 
LITTLE 
tions, including termination of contract, to be 
applied against contractors who were not in 
compliance. Three years later Title VII of the 
1964 Civil Rights Act proscribed employ- 
ment discrimination on the basis of race, 
colour, religion, sex or national origin. A year 
later President Johnson issued Executive 
Order 11246 that put further teeth into affir- 
mative action by requiring federal contrac- 
tors to develop specific goals and timetables

Corporate inertia 
One might think that these developments 
would have dealt a fatal blow to America’s 
system of occupational apartheid. This was 
hardly the case. In 1973—nine years after the 
passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act—a tele- 
phone company which was the nation’s largest 
corporate employer and a major government 
contractor still had a highly segregated work- 
force. The company employed 165,000 per- 
sons in low-paying operator classifications— 
99.9 per cent of whom were female. Of 
190,000 higher-paying craft workers, 99 per 
cent were male. Virtually no women were in 
management positions, and even supervisory 
personnel in “female” departments were male. 
The company, furthermore, could boast 
of “equal opportunity” policies that had 
increased black employment from 2.5 per 
cent in 1960 to 10 per cent in 1970, but this 
mainly reflected the hiring of black women 
as operators to replace white women who 
were experiencing a high rate of turnover. 
There were virtually no black males in craft 
jobs and even fewer in management. This was 
the context in which the Federal Communi- 
cations Commission opposed a rate increase 
on the grounds of the company’s discrimina- 
tory employment practices. 
Eventually this resulted in a landmark 
consent decree with the Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the 
Department of Justice, and the Department

a poor start but by 1976, 99 per cent of its 
short-term targets had been reached. Fur-

of new technology.

gave preference to minority applicants who 
met basic qualifications but might not have 
been hired or promoted without affirmative 
action mandates. Critics, of course, complain 
that this amounts to a system of de facto 
quotas. Like Clarence Thomas, they raise no 
objection to affirmative action so long as it 
involves “outreach”, but reject affirmative 
action as soon as it involves “preference”. 
What these critics overlook, however, is 
that decades of preaching non-discrimination 
produced little or no change in the system of 
occupational apartheid. Indeed, this is why 
affirmative policy shifted from outreach to 
preference in the first place. 
Unfortunately, no systematic body of evi- 
dence exists that would permit a precise 
accounting of what has been achieved under 
affirmative action. This much is clear, how-

Imm 
ever: the occupational spheres where blacks 
have made the most notable progress—in 
government service, in major blue-collar 
occupations, in corporate management, and 
in the professions—are all areas where vig- 
orous affirmative action programmes have 
been in place over the past two decades. 
Before affirmative action, the black middle 
class consisted of a small number of profes- 
sionals and businessmen anchored in the 
ghetto economy. Most of the progress that 
we celebrate—particularly the emergence of 
a large black middle class with roots in main- 
stream economic structures—is a direct 
product of affirmative action. 
Thus, much is at stake in the current 
debate over the future of affirmative action. 
In recent years there has been a rising chorus 
of criticism against affirmative action pro- 
grammes, and it has not come only from 
whites who feel that they are being asked to 
pay the price for crimes that they did not 
commit. Criticism also has been levelled by 
legal scholars who challenge the constitution- 
ality of affirmative action and see it as 
betraying the cardinal principle of the civil 
rights movement itself: a colour-blind 
society. A new genre of black conservatives

have denounced affirmative action as patron- 
izing to blacks and subversive of black self- 
esteem. Even some liberals who say they 
support affirmative action in principle have 
concluded that it is self-defeating because it 
triggers a popular backlash that only serves 
their political enemies. 
These are powerful arguments, based as 
they are on legal and moral principles as well 
as on political pragmatism. However, they fail 
to recognize the lesson of history: that even 
laws proscribing discrimination and well- 
intentioned efforts to increase minority rep- 
resentation were never effective until they 
were backed up with specific affirmative 
action mandates. 
Thus, the problem is stated falsely when it 
1s suggested that we must choose between 
merit or preference, or between the rights of 
individuals and the rights of groups, or 
between a colour-blind or a colour-conscious 
society. Rather, the paramount choice is 
between racial progress or returning to the 
status quo ante: the period before affirmative 
action when we salved our national con- 
science with laws on the books that did little 
or nothing to reverse centuries of occupa- 
tional apartheid. |

### 102560: An Unscientific notion

An unscientific notion 
by Albert Jacquard 
“ys Racism 1s based on two assertions 
“7. which are presented as facts. First, that 
the human species is made up of very distinct 
groups with different biological characteris- 
tics—in other words, “races”; and second, 
that these “races” can be ranked in hierar- 
chies according to a scale of “values”. 
These two propositions were laid down as 
incontrovertible truths in a book that all 
French schoolchildren were given to read 
during the first half of this century, Le Tour de 
la France par Deux Enfants (A Tour of France 
by Two Children). When the two children 
visit Marseilles, they are surprised by the 
diversity of people of every colour they 
encounter there. This provides the author 
with an opportunity to teach them about the 
four human races—white, red, yellow and 
black—and to make the following observation: 
“The white race is the most perfect.” 
The author is careful to illustrate each race 
with a very decent-looking individual. He 
admits that each race is “perfect”, but cannot 
help establishing a hierarchy of perfection, 
which is to the benefit of the white race. 
The role of the scientist is to cast a rig- 
orous, dispassionate eye on these two asser- 
tions and determine the degree to which they 
are fantasy or fact. 
Defining race 
Human beings display a variety which is at once 
disturbing and marvellous. The task of science 
1s to try to make sense of this chaotic situation 
by proposing a classification. The most cele- 
 
brated classification is that of the Swedish natu- 
ralist Linnaeus. He conceived of a tree whose 
successive ramifications would mark the dis- 
tinction between two “kingdoms” (animal and 
vegetable), then between several “classes” 
within each kingdom (such as mammals in the 
animal kingdom). Each class contained several 
“orders” (carnivores, for example), each order 
several “genera” (such as the genus Canis), and 
each genus several “species”. 
The dividing lines between this series of 
categories are often blurred and arbitrary, 
except in the case of species, where an objec- 
tive criterion—interfecundity—makes it pos- 
sible to determine whether two living crea- 
tures belong to the same species or not. In 
other words, individuals are deemed to 
belong to a single species if they are capable 
of reproducing and obtaining fertile offspring. 
Usually, however, a species comprises 
such a large number of members that it is 
tempting, and scientifically logical, to pursue 
the classification process by defining rela- 
tively homogeneous groups within a given 
species. Criteria need to be defined before 
the dividing lines between these groups, 
which are generally described as “races” or 
“breeds” can be drawn. 
It was not really until the eighteenth century 
that scientists tried to introduce some sort of 
order into the various ideas that were being 
peddled on the subject. They first needed to 
specify the characteristics to be taken into 
account when comparing individuals. 
The characteristics concerned were natu-

### 102560: An Unscientific notion

    
   rally visible ones, such as size, colour and shape. 
Throughout the nineteenth century anthropol- 
ogists squabbled over the number of races con- 
tained within the human species. The four tra- 
ditional races, which were based on skin colour, 
were clearly inadequate when it came to taking 
into account the degree of variety involved. 
Should humankind be divided up into ten, 100 
or 1,000 races? The controversy might have 
gone on raging for ever if the parameters of the 
whole question had not been changed by the 
sudden appearance of a new discipline: genetics. 
From 1900 on, the rediscovery of con- 
cepts devised by the Austrian monk Gregor 
Mendel (1822-1884) made scientists realize 
that appearances, or “phenotypes”, were the 
manifestation of factors concealed in the 
nuclei of cells: genes. The combination of 
genes in any individual constitutes his or her 
“genotype”. Thus, parents pass on to their 
children not a visible characteristic but half 
the genetic inheritance that governs their 
phenotype. They do not transmit what they 
are, but half the mass of information that 
allowed them to become what they are. 
This meant that scientists had to go back 
to square one. They realized that the only 
comparison that makes it possible to appre- 
hend the stable reality of a given population 
is one that focuses on what it passes on with 
each generation, in other words its genetic 
inheritance, and not on appearances, which 
are no more than a manifestation of it. 
A false genetic trail 
The first thing scientists did was try to track 
down “marker” genes whose presence 
would indicate that an individual belonged to 
a given race. If all members of a given popu- 
lation possessed a certain gene that was not 
found elsewhere, things would be straight- 
forward. But no such genes have been found. 
Most genes are present in virtually all human

populations. Some of them, probably as a 
result of recent mutations, are found only in 
certain populations, but even then they are 
rare and do not qualify as marker genes. 
What distinguishes groups, then, is not the 
presence or absence of a gene, but the fre- 
quency of its occurrence. The B-gene of the 
blood system accounts for 25 per cent of the 
genetic inheritance of people who live in the 
Indian sub-continent, but that proportion 
decreases the farther west one goes: it is 15-20 
per cent in Russia, 10-15 per cent in Central 
Europe, 5 per cent in France and Britain, and 
0 per cent in the Basque Country. 
Any definition of race can therefore result 
only from a logical process that allows for 
such differences in frequency. The starting 
point is a table which indicates, for all popula- 
tions, the frequency of the greatest possible 
number of genes. Information now available 
to us means that this line of reasoning can be 
pursued with the help of a large mass of 
observations. As part of this approach, popu- 
lations are regarded as belonging to one and 
the same “race” when most of their genes 
occur with similar frequency. 
If the problem is to be approached with 
scientific rigour, a definition of genetic dis- 
tance between different populations is 
required. Once all such distances between all 
populations have been calculated, it seems 
logical enough to assume that populations

with a small distance between them belong to 
the same race, and those with a great distance 
between them belong to different races. 
If these populations are represented as 
dots whose distance on paper is proportional 
to their genetic distance, the result in the case 
of dogs is shown in figure A (this page) where 
each cluster of dots may be regarded as a 
breed. On the other hand, if all human popu- 
lations are represented, the result is not a 
series of very distinct clusters, but an indis- 
tinct haze of dots which cannot be put in 
groups without an arbitrary element coming 
into play (figure B). It is true that populations 
X and Y are genetically closer to each other 
than they are to population Z, but it is impos- 
sible to know where to draw the dividing line. 
There is only one conclusion to be drawn: 
the concept of race is not valid for human 
populations. There are obvious differences 
between, for example, Lapps and Pygmies, 
but the transition from the former to the 
latter can be established via intermediate 
populations without any abrupt leaps. 
The reason why the concept is not valid is 
well known. If a genetic inheritance is to 
acquire a certain originality, if it is to distinguish 
itself significantly from that of neighbouring 
groups, it has to remain in complete isolation 
for a very long period, or for roughly as many 
generations as there are individuals of repro- 
ductive age. That kind of isolation can exist in 
the case of animals, but is barely conceivable for 
a species as nomadic and as keenly curious as 
ours. Because we are capable of crossing 
mountain ranges and oceans, we have homog- 
enized our genetic inheritances. 
That observation can be illustrated by the

following figures: the proportion of the total 
genetic diversity of the human species that can 
be put down to differences between the four 
traditional “races” is only 7-8 per cent. In the 
case of differences between nations within 
these races, it is also only 7-8 per cent, while the 
remaining 85 per cent is due to differences 
between groups belonging to the same nation. 
In other words, the essential differences are not 
between groups, but contained within them. 
The concept of race consequently has so little 
content that the word becomes meaningless 
and should be eradicated from our vocabulary. 
From classification to hierarchy 
However arbitrary it may be, some sort of 
classification is necessary. But, in Western 
culture at least, a classification is often auto- 
matically assumed to be the basis of a hier- 
archy: if two objects are not identical, they are 
regarded as not being “equal”, in which case 
one is superior to the other. This automatic 
assumption originates in primary school, 
where we are taught that when two numbers 
are different one is bigger than the other. 
What is true for numbers does not apply 
when several sets of measurements are used. 
In this case, the opposite of “equal” is not 
“superior” but “different”. There can be a 
hierarchical rank only when objects are 
described by a single number. Thus one stone 
will be heavier, or denser, or more voluminous 
than another. It can be “superior” only if all the 
measurements are synthesized into one. 
This is what some psychologists do when 
they want to compare people’s intellectual 
potential. Some individuals can reason more 
quickly, others have a more extensive

memory, and others again ask more relevant 
questions: they have different mental pro- 
files. But the question “Who is the most intel- 
ligent” can only be answered if intelligence is 
gauged by a single measurement. Hence the 
success of the notorious “intelligence quo- 
tient” or IQ. In fact it measures nothing def- 
inite, but enables people to talk as though a 
hierarchy of intelligence existed. 
Different human groups have varying 
potentials in every field. Whether innately or 
thanks to their culture, Pygmies are better 
equipped to solve the problems posed by 
living in an equatorial rain forest than Lapps, 
who know better how to cope with Arctic 
cold. The two populations are different; nei- 
ther 1s superior to the other. 
Unfortunately, our minds have been 
impregnated with a belief in that kind of hier- 
archy, which is reflected in turns of phrase 
that are so familiar to us that we take their 
meaning for granted. Thus we accept the idea 
that breeders have “improved” the equine 
race, whereas in fact all they have done is 
improve the racing abilities of certain stock, at 
the cost of a spectacular decline in their bio- 
logical potential. Such “thoroughbreds” are in 
fact defective animals whose only achieve- 
ment—one of little interest—is their ability to 
run fast over short distances. 
The phrase I used about the “white race” 
being “the most perfect” is not even a fallacy: 
it is meaningless. But it is much harder to 
combat such assertions, which are meaning- 
less, than it is to combat inaccuracies. 
That is why the fight against racism may 
well go on for ever. It matters not that the 
geneticist can prove that the notion of race is 
without foundation or that the logician can 
demonstrate the absurdity of global hierarchies. 
The head of a fruit fly 
(Drosophila melanogaster), 
an insect widely used in 
genetic experiments. 
The racist’s attitude will not change one iota 
because when it comes down to it that attitude 
has nothing to do with biological reality or logic. 
An expression of contempt 
What racism expresses is essentially con- 
tempt—contempt for other people that is 
motivated not by their characteristics as such 
but by the fact that they belong to a group. 
Hence remarks such as “All... are...”. What 
prompts such contempt is a lack of self-confi- 
dence, and its end-product is self-destruction. 
What are human beings if not animals 
whose peculiar characteristic is to be able to 
construct themselves with the help of 
others? My “I” has emerged from the “yous” 
that have been addressed to me. “I” is made 
up of a web of links I weave with others. 
But the weaving of those links cannot take 
place unless efforts are made and fears quelled. 
Other people are a source of both riches and 
risks. We have to confront them, that is to say 
tackle them head on and set intelligence against 
intelligence. The exchange will be fruitful only 
if a modicum of confidence exists—both self- 
confidence and confidence in others. 
Racists are people who have no self-confi- 
dence. To disguise their fear, they puff them- 
selves up and claim to be superior. Their con- 
tempt for others only serves to mask the panic 
their own inner emptiness inspires in them. 
It is easy to prove that the notion of race in 
the case of human beings is virtually impossible 
to define, or that the concept of hierarchy 
cannot be used in a global way. But the most 
useful contribution science can make to the 
fight against racism lies elsewhere—in a greater 
awareness of what a human being is: a won- 
derful thing which each individual builds with 
the help of others. [|

Elias Canetti in 1983. 
EET 
EDGAR REICHMANN 
is a novelist and literary critic. His 
most recent novel, Nous n'irons 
plus a Sils Maria, was published 
earlier this year by Denoél, Paris. 
  
 
  
HW You left us on 14 August 1994. Where did 
you come into the world? 
Elias Canetti:] was born at the beginning of the 
century at Ruschuk on the Bulgarian bank of the 
Danube. It was a marvellous city for a child. 
People of the most varied backgrounds lived 
there, and on any one day you could hear seven 
or eight languages. As well as the Bulgarians, there 
were Turks, Greeks, Jews, Albanians, Arme- 
nians, Gypsies and Romanians who came from 
the opposite side of the Danube. I lived with my 
parents and my two brothers in the neighbour- 
hood of the Sephardim, the Spanish Jews, where 
my father had a successful business. 
HM The looming threat of war led your family 
to emigrate to England. Your father died when 
you were living in Manchester in 1912. 
E. C.:It was a terrible shock and in a way I never 
got over it. Someone who has been exposed to 
death too soon can never rid himself of it. It is a 
wound which becomes a kind of lung through 
which one breathes. 
Hl But you try to use remembrance as a kind 
of counterweight to death. . . 
The novelist, dramatist and philosopher Elias Canetti (1905- 
1994), who wrote in German, was born at Ruschuk in Bulgaria. 
His parents were Sephardim, Jews of Spanish origin. In 1981, 
when he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, the 
Swedish Academy noted that the characteristic features of his 
work are “a satirical bite in the observation of people's 
behaviour, a loathing of wars and devastation, bitterness at 
the thought of life's brevity”. This imaginary interview has 
been composed by writer and journalist Edgar Reichmann 
using extracts from Canetti's work. 
E. C.: One must visit the dead and localize them; 
otherwise they slip away with astonishing speed. 
As soon as you join them in their proper place, 
they return to life. In a flash, you remember 
everything you thought you had forgotten 
about them, you hear their words, stroke their 
hair and see your reflection in the brightness of 
their gaze. Once upon a time you might never 
have been quite sure of the colour of their eyes; 
now you recognize it immediately. Perhaps 
everything in them is more intense than when 
they were alive; perhaps the dead await com- 
plete self-fulfilment in the resurrection that one 
of those they have left behind will offer them. 
Bl Then you left England. . . 
E. C.:In 1913 I left with my mother for Vienna, 
then we moved to Zurich and at the end of the 
Great War to Frankfurt, where I passed my 
school certificate. After learning English, I 
learned German, which became my second 
mother tongue and the language in which I 
wrote. I went back to Vienna to study chem- 
istry. I was very excited by the intellectual fer- 
ment in the capital of the former Austro-Hun- 
garian empire. It was there, in 1924, that I met 
Veza Taubner-Calderon, who became my wife

ten years later. In 1928 I went for the first time 
to Berlin, where the artistic and cultural life was 
just as intense as it was in Vienna. 
HB But intolerance was also rife at this time. 
The rise of totalitarianism had begun. This 
climate is reflected in your writing. 
E. C.: My first play, Hochzeit (“The Wedding”), 
which I wrote in 1932, is not based on a model. It 
stands on its own. The way in which the charac- 
ters express themselves reveals all kinds of tur- 
moil and none of them grasps what the others 
want to say. The lack of communication is total. 
Komadie der Eitelkeit (“Comedy of Vanity”) was 
written in 1934 beneath the dark sun of the 
tragedy that was unfolding in Germany. At the 
end of January Hitler came to power. From then 
on every event bore its load of anguish. In 1925 1 
began to try to find out the meaning of the con- 
cept of the crowd, how crowds functioned and, 
later, how power sprang from crowds. When the 
madness that was later to become all-consuming 
took control of the heart of Europe I felt the need 
to understand this even more strongly. 
  
In 1925 | began to try to find out the meaning of the concept of 
the crowd, how crowds functioned and, later, how power sprang 
from crowds. 
While books were being burned in Berlin, I 
was writing my metaphor-novel, originally enti- 
tled Kant fangt Feuer (“Kant takes fire”) and later 
Die Blendung (“The Blinding”). In it I tried to 
expose the narcissistic verbiage of the mandarins 
who were incapable of foreseeing the horror that 
would soon destroy them or force them into exile. 
The book was rejected by Austrian publishers and 
first appeared in a Czech translation. After the war 
it was published in English as Auto-da-fé. 
Bl Then came your key work, Crowds and 
Power, essential reading for anyone who 
wants to understand the twentieth century. 
E. C.: This book grew out of research that I had 
begun in adolescence and pursued more deeply

| have always thought it was mad to insist that everyone should 
think in the same way, submit to the demands of a single faith 
and only regard the world from a single standpoint. 
with the rise of Nazism. I concentrated on 
threats of war in the hope that I would be able to 
dissipate them. 
After my mother’s death in 1937, an event 
that prostrated me, I returned to Vienna. A year 
later I saw Hitlers troops enter the city. I stayed 
there a few more months in order to observe 
the horror at close quarters and to understand 
more about how the crowd functioned. 
Men’s feeling for their own increase has 
always been strong. The large numbers of the 
herds they hunted blended in their feelings with 
their own numbers which they wished to be 
large. They expressed this feeling in a specific 
state of communal excitement which I call the 
rhythmic or throbbing crowd. 
Their excitement grows and reaches frenzy, 
until they are all doing the same thing. They all 
swing their arms to and fro, and shake their 
heads. In the end, there appears to be a single 
creature dancing, a creature with fifty heads and 
a hundred legs and arms, all acting in exactly the 
same way and with the same purpose. When 
their excitement 1s at its height, these people 
really feel as one, and nothing but physical 
exhaustion can stop them. 
The fact that wars can last so long and may 
be carried on well after they have been lost 
arises from the deep urge of the crowd not to 
disintegrate; to remain a crowd. This feeling is 
sometimes so strong that people prefer to 
perish together with open eyes rather than 
acknowledge defeat and thus experience the dis- 
integration of their own crowd. 
HM What suddenly creates this uncanny 
cohesion? 
E. C.: The phenomenon is so mysterious that it 
must be approached with a measure of caution. 
People decide that they are threatened with 
physical destruction and proclaim the fact pub- 
licly to the whole world. They say “I can be 
killed”, and secretly add “because I myself I 
want to kill this or that man.” The stress prop- 
erly belongs on the second half of this sentence. 
It should run: “I want to kill this or that man, 
therefore I can be killed myself.” But when it is 
a question of a war starting, of its eruption and 
the awakening of a bellicose spirit, the first ver- 
sion will be the only one openly admitted. Even 
if in fact the aggressor, each side will always 
attempt to prove that it is threatened. 
Il What is the place of the individual survival 
instinct during these deadly confrontations? 
E. C.: Death, which threatens every individual at 
every moment, must have been proclaimed as a 
collective sentence before people will oppose it 
actively. There are, as it were, declared times of 
death, times when it turns on a definite, arbitrarily 
selected group as a whole. It is “Death to the 
French” or “Death to the English.” The enthu- 
siasm with which people accept such declarations 
has its root in the individual’s cowardice before 
death; no one likes facing it alone. The death that 
thousands approach together is entirely different. 
The worst that can happen to men in war is to 
perish together; and this spares them death as indi- 
viduals, which is what they most fear. 
HB Where does force come into all this? You 
make a distinction between force and power. 
E. C.: The word “force” suggests something 
close and immediate in its effect, something 
more directly compelling than power. When 
force gives itself time in which to operate it 
becomes power. The distinction between force 
and power can be illustrated very simply by the 
relationship between cat and mouse. The cat 
uses force to catch the mouse, but while it 1s 
playing with its prey another factor is present. It 
lets it go, allows it to run about a little, and during 
this time the mouse is no longer subjected to 
force. But it is still within the power of the cat 
and can be caught again. The space which the cat 
dominates, the moments of hope it allows the 
mouse, while continuing however to watch it 
closely all the time and never relaxing its interest 
and intention to destroy 1t—all this can be called 
the actual body of power, or, more simply, 
power itself. Inherent in power, therefore, as 
opposed to force, is a certain extension in space 
and time. 
lB What role does religion play? 
E. C.: The distinction between force and power 
can be seen in another, quite different sphere. All 
those who believe in God believe that they are 
continuously in His power, but there are some

for whom this is not enough. They await some 
sharp intervention, some direct act of divine 
force, which they can recognize and feel as such. 
They live in expectation of God’s commands; for 
them He has the cruder features of a ruler. His 
active will and their active and explicit submission 
become the core of their religion. Believers of 
this kind yearn for God’s force. His power alone 
does not satisfy them; it is too distant and leaves 
them too much room for thought and personal 
initiative. The state of continuous expectation of 
command to which they surrender themselves 
for good and all, marks them deeply and has a 
momentous effect on their attitude to other 
people. It creates a soldierly type of believer, men 
to whom battle is the truest representation of life. 
HM Religious literature seems to have been 
important to you.

leading 
anthropologists, Claude 
Lévi-Strauss twice set 
forth his ideas on 
racism for Unesco, first 
in Race and History

(1971). On the 
following pages we 
publish long extracts 
from these two 
important studies.

The development of human life is not everywhere 
the same but rather takes form in an extraordinary 
diversity of societies and civilizations. This intel- 
lectual, aesthetic and sociological diversity is in no 
way the outcome of the biological differences, in 
certain observable features, between different 
groups of men; it is simply a parallel phenomenon 
in a different sphere. But, at the same time, we 
must note two important respects in which there 
is a sharp distinction. First, the order of magnitude 
is different. There are many more human cultures 
than human races, since the first are to be counted 
in thousands and the second in single units. . . . 
Second, in contrast to the diversity of races, where 
interest is confined to their historical origin or their 
distribution over the face of the world, the diver- 
sity of cultures gives rise to many problems; it may 
be wondered whether it is an advantage or a disad- 
vantage for human kind. . .. 
Last and most important, the nature of the 
diversity must be investigated even at the risk of 
allowing the racial prejudices whose biological 
foundation has so lately been destroyed to 
develop again on new grounds. . . . We cannot 
therefore claim to have formulated a convincing 
denial of the inequality of the human races, so 
long as we fail to consider the problem of the 
inequality—or diversity—of human cultures, 
which is in fact—however unjustifiably—closely 
associated with it in the public mind. . ..

strategy. Number and diversity: a comparison of 
the Old World with the New on the eve of the 
latter’s discovery [in 1492] provides a good illus- 
tration of the need for these two factors. 
Europe at the beginning of the Renaissance 
was the meeting-place and melting-pot of the 
most diverse influences: the Greek, Roman, 
Germanic and Anglo-Saxon traditions combined 
with the influences of Arabia and China. Pre- 
Columbian America enjoyed no fewer cultural 
contacts, quantitatively speaking, as the various 
American cultures maintained relations with one 
another and the two Americas together represent 
a whole hemisphere. But, while the cultures 
which were cross-fertilizing each other in Europe 
had resulted from differentiation dating back sev- 
eral tens of thousands of years, those on the more 
recently occupied American continent had had 
less time to develop divergencies; the picture 
they offered was relatively homogeneous. Thus, 
although it would not be true to say that the cul- 
tural standard of Mexico or Peru was [in 1492] 
inferior to that of Europe at the time of the dis- 
covery (we have in fact seen that, in some 
respects, it was superior), the various aspects of 
culture were possibly less well organized in rela- 
tion to each other. . . . Their organization, less 
flexible and diversified, probably explains their 
collapse before a handful of conquerors. And the 
underlying reason for this may be sought in the 
fact that the partners to the American cultural 
“coalition” were less dissimilar from one another 
than their counterparts in the Old World. 
No society 1s therefore essentially and intrin- 
sically cumulative. Cumulative history is not the 
prerogative of certain races or certain cultures, 
marking them off from the rest. It is the result of 
their conduct rather than their nature. It repre- 
sents a certain “way of life” of cultures which 
depends on their capacity to “go along together”. 
In this sense, it may be said that cumulative his- 
tory is the type of history characteristic of 
grouped societies—social super-organisms— 
while stationary history (supposing it to exist) 
would be the distinguishing feature of an inferior 
form of social life, the isolated society. 
The one real calamity, the one fatal flaw which 
can afflict a human group and prevent it from 
achieving fulfilment is to be alone. 
We can thus see how clumsy and intellectu- 
ally unsausfactory the generally accepted efforts 
to defend the contributions of various human

races and cultures to civilization often are. We list 
features, we sift questions of origin, we allot first 
places. However well-intentioned they may be, 
these efforts serve no purpose for, in three 
respects, they miss their aim. 
In the first place, there can never be any cer- 
tainty about a particular culture’s credit for an 
invention or discovery. . .. In the second place, all 
cultural contributions can be divided into two 
groups. On the one hand we have isolated acqui- 
sitions or features, whose importance is evident 
but which are also somewhat limited. . . . At the 
other end of the scale (with a whole series of 
intermediates, of course), there are systematized 
contributions, representing the peculiar form in 
which each society has chosen to express and sat- 
isfy the generality of human aspirations. There is 
no denying the originality and particularity of 
these patterns, but, as they all represent the exclu- 
sive choice of a single group, it is difficult to see 
how one civilization can hope to benefit from the 
way of life of another, unless it is prepared to 
renounce its own individuality. Attempted com- 
promises are, in fact, likely to produce only two

results: either the disorganization and collapse of 
the pattern of one of the groups; or a new combi- 
nation, which then, however, represents the 
emergence of a third pattern, and cannot be 
assimilated to either of the others. The question 
with which we are concerned, indeed, is not to 
discover whether or not a society can derive ben- 
efit from the way of life of its neighbours, but 
whether, and if so to what extent, it can succeed in 
understanding or even in knowing them. . . . 
World civilization 
Finally, wherever a contribution is made, there 
must be a recipient. But, while there are in fact 
real cultures which can be localized in time and 
space, and which may be said to have “con- 
tributed” and to be continuing their contribu- 
tions, what can this “world civilization” be, which 
is supposed to be the recipient of all these contri- 
butions? It is not a civilization distinct from all the 
others, and yet real in the same sense that they 
are... . [tis] an abstract conception, to which we 
attribute a moral or logical significance—moral, if 
we are thinking of an aim to be pursued by 
existing societies; logical, if we are using the one 
term to cover the common features which 
analysis may reveal in the different cultures. In 
both cases, we must not shut our eyes to the fact 
that the concept of world civilization is very 
sketchy and imperfect, and that its intellectual and 
emotional content is tenuous. To attempt to 
assess cultural contributions with all the weight 
of countless centuries behind them. .. by refer- 
ence to the sole yardstick of a world civilization 
which is still a hollow shell, would be greatly to 
impoverish them, draining away their life-blood 
and leaving nothing but the bare bones behind. 
... The true contribution of a culture consists, 
not in the list of inventions which it has personally 
produced, but in its difference from others. The 
sense of gratitude and respect which each single 
member of a given culture can and should feel 
towards all others can only be based on the con- 
viction that the other cultures differ from his own 
in countless ways. . . . 
We have taken the notion of world civilization 
as a sort of limiting concept or as an epitome of a 
highly complex process. If our arguments are 
valid, there is not, and never can be, a world civi- 
lization in the absolute sense in which that term is 
often used, since civilization implies, and indeed 
consists in, the coexistence of cultures exhibiting 
the maximum possible diversities. A world civi- 
lization could, in fact, represent no more than a 
worldwide coalition of cultures, each of which 
would preserve its own originality.

### IGNORE

  
[In 1952,] in a booklet written for UNESCO, I sug- 
gested the concept of “coalition” to explain why 
isolated cultures could not hope to create single- 
handed the conditions necessary for a truly 
cumulative history. To achieve this, I said, dif- 
ferent cultures must, voluntarily or involuntarily, 
combine their respective stakes in the great game 
of history, to increase their chances of making 
that long run of winning plays by which history 
progresses. Geneticists are at present [1971] 
putting forward very similar views on biological 
evolution, in pointing out that a genome is in 
reality a system within which certain genes func- 
tion as regulators and others act in concert on a 
single characteristic (or the contrary, if several 
characteristics depend on a single gene). What is 
true of the individual genome is also true of a 
population, in which the combination of a 
number of genetic inheritances—in which until 
recently a “racial type” would have been identi- 
fied—must always be such as to allow the estab- 
lishment of an optimum equilibrium and 
improve the group’s chances of survival. In this 
sense, it might be said that in the history of popu- 
lations, genetic recombination plays a part com- 
parable to that played by cultural recombination 
in the evolution of the ways of life, techniques, 
knowledge and beliefs by which different soci- 
eties are distinguished. . . . 
The nature-culture debate 
[But] one fact cannot be too strongly emphasized: 
while selection makes it possible for living species 
to adapt to their natural environment or to resist 
its changes more effectively, in the case of man 
this environment ceases to be natural in any real 
sense. Its characteristics arise from technical, eco- 
nomic, social and psychological conditions 
which, through the operation of culture, create a 
particular environment for each human group. 
We can go a step further, and consider whether 
the relation between organic evolution and cul- 
tural evolution is not merely analogical, but also 
complementary... .. 
In the dawn of humanity, biological evolution 
perhaps selected such pre-cultural traits as 
upright posture, manual dexterity, sociability, the 
capacity to think in symbols, speech and the 
ability to communicate. But once a culture 
A world civilization could represent no more than a 
worldwide coalition of cultures, each of which would preserve its 
own originality. 
  
existed, these traits were consolidated and prop- 
agated by cultural factors. When cultures became 
specialized, it was again cultural factors which 
consolidated and encouraged other traits, such as 
resistance to heat or cold for those societies 
which had willy-nilly to adapt themselves to 
extreme climatic conditions; aggressive or con- 
templative dispositions, technical ingenuity etc. 
None of these traits, as perceived at a cultural 
level, can clearly be attributed to a genetic basis, 
although we cannot exclude the possibility that 
such a connexion—even if partial, remote and 
indirect—may sometimes exist. In that case, it 


### 102562: Race, history and culture

would be true to say that every culture selects 
genetic aptitudes which then, by reflex action, 
influence those cultures by which they were at 
first stimulated. 
An ideological cover 
By pushing back the earliest beginnings of 
humanity to an ever more remote past— 
according to recent estimates, some millions of 
years ago—physical anthropology has under- 
mined one of the principal bases for racialist 
theory, since the number of unknowable factors 
concerned thus increases much more rapidly 
than the number of landmarks available to stake 
out the paths followed by our earliest ancestors 
in the course of their evolution. 
Geneticists delivered even more decisive blows 
to these theories when they replaced the concept 
of type by that of population and the concept of 
race by that of the genetic stock, and again when 
they demonstrated that there is a gulf between 
hereditary differences attributable to a single gene— 
which are of little significance from the point of 
view of race, since they probably always have an 
adaptive value—and those attributable to the com- 
bined action of several, which makes it virtually 
impossible to determine them. . .. 
Only in the last ten years have we begun to 
understand that we were discussing the problem 
of the relation between organic and cultural evolu- 
tion in terms which Auguste Comte would have 
described as metaphysical. Human evolution is 
not a by-product of biological evolution, but nei- 
ther is it completely distinct from it. A synthesis 
of these two traditional points of view is now pos- 
sible, provided that biologists are not content with 
answers not based on fact, or with dogmatic expla- 
nations, and realize both the help they can give 
each other and their respective limitations. 
The unsatisfactory nature of the traditional 
solutions to the problem perhaps explains why 
the ideological struggle against racialism has 
proved so ineffective on a practical level. There 
is nothing to indicate that racial prejudice is 
declining and plenty of evidence to suggest that, 
after brief periods of localized quiescence, it is 
reappearing everywhere with increased intensity. 
It is for this reason that UNESCO feels called upon

### 102562: Race, history and culture

All true creation implies a certain 
deafness to outside values, even to the 
extent of rejecting them. 
to renew from time to time a battle whose out- 
come appears uncertain, to say the least. 
But can we be so sure that the racial form 
taken by intolerance results primarily from false 
beliefs held by this or that people about the 
dependence of culture on organic evolution? Are 
these ideas not simply an ideological cover for a 
more real form of antagonism, based on the will 
to subjugate and on relations of power? This was 
certainly the case in the past, but, even supposing 
that these relations of power become less 
marked, will not racial differentiation continue to 
serve as a pretext for the growing difficulty of 
living together, unconsciously felt by mankind, 
which is undergoing a demographic explosion 
and which . . . is beginning to hate itself, warned 
by a mysterious prescience that its numbers are 
becoming too great for all its members to enjoy 
freely open space and pure, non-polluted air? 
Racial prejudice is at its most intense when it 
concerns human groups confined to a territory so 
cramped and a share of natural resources so 
meagre that these peoples lack dignity in their own 
eyes as well as in those of their more powerful 
neighbours. But does not humanity today, on the 
whole, tend to expropriate itself and, on a planet 
that has grown too small, reconstitute, to its own 
cost, a situation comparable to that inflicted by 
some of its representatives on the unfortunate 
American or Oceanic tribes? Finally, what would 
happen to the ideological struggle against racial 
prejudice, if it were shown to be universally true— 
as some experiments conducted by psychologists 
suggest—that if subjects of any origin whatever are 
divided into groups, which are placed in a com- 
petitive situation, each group will develop feelings 
of bias and injustice towards its rivals? 
Minority groups appearing in various parts of 
the world today, such as the hippies, are not dis- 
tinguished from the bulk of the population by 
race, but only by their way of life, morality, hair 
style and dress; are the feelings of repugnance and 
sometimes hostility they inspire in most of their 
fellows substantially different from racial hatred? 
Would we therefore be making genuine progress 
if we confined ourselves to dissipating the partic- 
ular prejudices on which racial hatred—in the 
strict sense of the term—can be said to be based? 
The mirage of universal entente 
In any case, the contribution ethnologists can 
make to the solution of the race problem would 
be derisory; nor is it certain that psychologists 
and educators could do any better, so strong is 
the evidence—as we see from the evidence of the 
so-called primitive peoples—that mutual toler- 
ance presupposes two conditions which in con- 
temporary society are further than ever from 
being realized: one is relative equality; the other is 
adequate physical separation. 
... No doubt we cherish the hope that one day 
equality and fraternity will reign among men 
without impairing their diversity. But if humanity 
is not to resign itself to becoming a sterile con- 
sumer of the values it created in the past and of 
those alone... ., it will have to relearn the fact that 
all true creation implies a certain deafness to out- 
side values, even to the extent of rejecting or 
denying them. For one individual cannot at the 
same time merge into the spirit of another, iden- 
tify with another and still maintain his own iden- 
tity. Integral communication with another, if fully 
realized, sooner or later dooms the creative origi- 
nality of both. The great creative epochs in history 
were those in which communication had become 
adequate for distant individuals to stimulate each 
other, but not frequent or rapid enough for those 
obstacles, indispensable between individuals as 
they are between groups, to be reduced to the 
point at which diversity becomes levelled out and 
nullified by excessively facile interchange. 
... Convinced that cultural and organic evolu- 
tion are inextricably linked, [biologists and ethnol- 
ogists] know, of course, that a return to the past is 
impossible, but they know, too, that the course 
humanity is at present following is building up ten- 
sions to such a degree that racial hatred is a mere 
foretaste of the greater intolerance that may hold 
sway tomorrow, without even the pretext of 
ethnic differences. To forestall the dangers threat- 
ening us today and those, still more formidable, 
that we shall have to face tomorrow, we must 
accept the fact that their causes are much deeper 
than mere ignorance or prejudice: we can only 
hope for a change in the course of history, which is 
even more difficult to bring about than progress 
in the march of ideas. [|

Article 1 
as 
Meaning 
of tolerance 
 
1.1 Tolerance is respect, acceptance and 
appreciation of the rich diversity of our 
world’s cultures, our forms of expres- 
ston and ways of being human. It is fos- 
tered by knowledge, openness, com- 
munication, and freedom of thought, 
conscience and belief. Tolerance is har- 
mony in difference. It is not only a 
moral duty, it 1s also a political and legal 
requirement. Tolerance, the virtue that 
makes peace possible, contributes to the 
replacement of the culture of war by a 
culture of peace. 
1.2 Tolerance is not concession, conde- 


### 102563: A Plea for tolerance

scension or indulgence. Tolerance 1s, 
above all, an active attitude prompted by 
recognition of the universal human 
rights and fundamental freedoms of 
others. In no circumstance can it be 
used to justify infringements of these 
fundamental values. Tolerance is to be 
exercised by individuals, groups and 
States. 
1.3 Tolerance is the responsibility that 
upholds human rights, pluralism 
(including cultural pluralism), democ- 
racy and the rule of law. It involves the 
rejection of dogmatism and absolutism 
and affirms the standards set out in 
international human rights instruments. 
1.4 Consistent with respect for human 
rights, the practice of tolerance does not 
  
mean toleration of social injustice or the 
abandonment or weakening of one’s 
convictions. It means that one is free to 
adhere to one’s own convictions and 
accepts that others adhere to theirs. It 
means accepting the fact that human 
beings, naturally diverse in their appear- 
ance, situation, speech, behaviour and 
values, have the right to live in peace and 
to be as they are. It also means that one’s 
views are not to be imposed on others.

Education 
4.1 Education 1s the most effective 
means of preventing intolerance. The 
first step in tolerance education is to 
teach people what their shared rights 
and freedoms are, so that they may be 
respected, and to promote the will to 
protect those of others. 
4.2 Education for tolerance should be 
considered an urgent imperative; that is 
why it is necessary to promote system- 
atic and rational tolerance teaching 
methods that will address the cultural, 
social, economic, political and religious 
sources of intolerance—major roots of 
violence and exclusion. Education poli- 
cies and programmes should contribute 
to development of understanding, soli- 
darity and tolerance among individuals as 
well as among ethnic, social, cultural, reli- 
gious and linguistic groups and nations. 
4.3 Education for tolerance should aim 
at countering influences that lead to fear 
and exclusion of others, and should help 
young people to develop capacities for 
independent judgement, critical thinking 
and ethical reasoning. 
4.4 We pledge to support and implement 
programmes of social science research 
and education for tolerance, human 
rights and non-violence. This means 
devoting special attention to improving 
teacher training, curricula, the content of 
textbooks and lessons, and other educa- 
tional materials including new educa- 
tional technologies, with a view to edu- 
cating caring and responsible citizens 
open to other cultures, able to appre- 
ciate the value of freedom, respectful of 
human dignity and differences, and able 
to prevent conflicts or resolve them by 
non-violent means.

1. All human beings belong to a single 
species and are descended from a 
common stock. They are born equal in 
dignity and rights and all form an integral 
part of humanity. 
2. All individuals and groups have the 
right to be different, to consider them- 
selves as different and to be regarded as 
such. However, the diversity of life 
styles and the right to be different may 
not, 1n any circumstances, serve as a pre- 
text for racial prejudice; they may not 
justify either in law or in fact any dis- 
criminatory practice whatsoever, nor 
provide a ground for the policy of 
apartheid, which is the extreme form of 
racism. . .. . 
4. All peoples of the world possess equal 
faculties for attaining the highest level in 
intellectual, technical, social, economic, 
cultural and political development. 
5. The differences between the achieve- 
ments of the different peoples are 
entirely attributable to geographical, his-

cultural factors. Such differences can in 
no case serve as a pretext for any rank-

1. Any theory which involves the claim 
that racial or ethnic groups are inher-

that some would be entitled to dominate 
or eliminate others, presumed to be 
inferior, or which bases value judge- 
ments on racial differentiation, has no 
scientific foundation and is contrary to 
the moral and ethical principles of 
humanity. 
2. Racism includes racist ideologies, 
prejudiced attitudes, discriminatory 
behaviour, structural arrangements and 
institutionalized practices resulting in 
racial inequality as well as the fallacious 
notion that discriminatory relations 
between groups are morally and scien- 
tifically justifiable; it is reflected in dis- 
criminatory provisions in legislation or 
regulations and discriminatory practices 
as well as in anti-social beliefs and acts; it 
hinders the development of its victims, 
perverts those who practice it, divides 
nations internally, impedes international 
co-operation and gives rise to political 
tensions between peoples; it is contrary 
to the fundamental principles of interna- 
tional law and, consequently, seriously 
disturbs international peace and security. 
3. Racial prejudice, historically linked 
with inequalities in power, reinforced by 
social differences economic and 
between individuals and groups, and still 
seeking today to justify such inequalities, 
is totally without justification.

Article 4 
of 
1. Any restriction on the complete self- 
fulfilment of human beings and free 
communication between them which is 
based on racial or ethnic considerations 
is contrary to the principle of equality in 
dignity and rights; it cannot be admitted. 
2. One of the most serious violations of 
this 
apartheid, which, like genocide, is a 
principle is represented by 
crime against humanity, and gravely dis- 
turbs international peace and security. 
3. Other policies and practices of racial 
segregation and discrimination consti- 
tute crimes against the conscience and 
dignity of mankind and may lead to 
political tensions and gravely endanger 
international peace and security.

### 102565: The Rights of future generations

  
  
  
  
  
he extent to which future generations will 
be able to enjoy their rights will depend on 
the moral and intellectual choices made by 
present generations—on whether we do our duty 
to our children and our children’s children. 
  
Time to act 
For the first time in the history of humanity, 
awareness of the global impact of our actions— 
starting with the effects our population numbers 
have on the environment—compels us to do all 
we can to avoid causing irreparable environmental 
damage and preventing future generations from 
exercising all or some of their rights. Because of 
this risk we must act before it is too late and cor- 
rect trends which might otherwise lead to incalcu- 
lable problems. We must observe, anticipate, and 
prevent. Prevention 1s not just an option. It is an 
unavoidable obligation, an ethical imperative. We 
must act in good time. We must look ahead and try 
to see the shape of our common destiny. We must 
never lapse into fatalism. UNESCO’s Constitution 
has entrusted us with a unique task: to be the con- 
science of humanity. This task includes considera- 
tion for those who will follow in our footsteps, 
those who have yet to be born. 
The survivors of wars think with great intensity 
of those who will come after them, because they 
want to spare future generations the horrors they 
have known themselves. Death, which they have 
seen at close quarters, has at least given them an 
opportunity to discover the full meaning of life. Not 
life lived selfishly and in isolation, but community 
life in all its aspects, including that of continuity. 
  
COMMENTARY BY FEDERICO MAYOR 
THE RIGHTS OF 
FUTURE GENERATIONS 
It is not surprising, therefore, that the opening 
words of the Charter of the United Nations 
should refer to the fate of succeeding generations. 
What is surprising, however, is that there has been 
no subsequent attempt to look more deeply into 
the idea of “future generations”, especially from 
the standpoint of the rights they should enjoy. It 
is true that the World Heritage Convention 
adopted by UNESCO’s General Conference in 1972 
was inspired by a determination to safeguard the 
heritage so that it could be passed on intact to 
future generations—those very words appear in 
its text. Twenty years later, the Earth Summit 
adopted the Rio Declaration, which strengthens 
and reaffirms the idea of solidarity between the 
generations. 
Solidarity between the generations 
But we must go further. We must recognize and 
guarantee the rights of future generations. Probably 
the most striking example of a possible threat to 
those rights is that of pollution and its attendant haz- 
ards, especially in relation to choices concerning 
nuclear energy—an issue which is rarely as simple 
and cut-and-dried as it is presented to the general 
public. The political, economic or financial interests 
that favour particular solutions must never be 
allowed to overshadow the interests of future gen- 
erations. In cases where the foreseeable conse- 
quences of investment will extend far beyond the 
present, it is worth considering whether an impact 
study should not be made of the consequences of 
the various options on offer over a fifty-year 
period, the span of two generations.

### 102565: The Rights of future generations

In fact there is little doubt that several of the 
rights of future generations are affected: the right 
to life and to the conservation of the human 
genome, the right to development and to indi- 
vidual and collective fulfilment, and the right to an 
ecologically balanced environment. These are 
indeed human rights, that is, universal and univer- 
sally recognized values which are a legitimate cause 
of concern for the international community as a 
whole. This is a far cry from rights regarded 
merely as legally protected vested interests. 
The duties of the present 
The fact remains that the rights of future genera- 
tions belong to a new type in comparison with the 
rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights of 1948. First of all because, by def- 
inition, those entitled to them do not yet exist— 
although since Roman times the law has admitted 
cases in which the rights of persons yet unborn are 
acknowledged. We must now extend that possi- 
bility, without, however, ending up with a precise 
legal status for the unborn child or embryo, issues 
which are now under discussion in many countries. 
In reality, these new-style rights are only rights 
because today’s generations have obligations 
whose counterparts are the rights of future gener- 
ations. In other words there is a dialectical rela- 
tionship between rights and duties which should 
make us aware of the inherent unity of the human 
race, in space and over time. 
Which rights of future generations should be 
recognized? It has often been correctly pointed 
out that all the rights set forth in the thirty articles 
of the Universal Declaration can be condensed 
into a single one: the right to live in dignity, which 
1s indeed the sum of civil, political, economic, 
social and cultural rights. The same synthesis could 
probably be applied to the rights of future genera- 
tions, with the added dimension of the continuity 
of human life, 1.e., guaranteeing the right to live in 
dignity on an earth that is habitable. This brings us 
back to the preoccupation with the environment 
which will probably, with hindsight, be seen as the 
major qualitative change that has occurred in the 
twentieth century. 
However, it is preferable, if only for educa- 
tional and legal reasons, to consider the rights of 
future generations on an individual basis. First of 
all, the exemption of persons belonging to future 
generations from all individual responsibility for 
the crimes of earlier generations should be 
regarded as a human right. I have long believed, to 
put it bluntly, that history kills and that accordingly 
we are in duty bound to “disarm history”, since it 
1s axiomatic that future generations cannot con- 
tinue to shoulder the burden of the crimes, actual 
or alleged, of their forebears. Make no mistake: 
this has nothing to do with the moral responsibility 
which each person, each community and each 
nation must assume in complete freedom, but 
concerns legal responsibility, with its attendant 
criminal and civil consequences. 
 
The right to live in peace 
The second right which is of great importance at 
the present time is that which has been formuated 
as “right to peace and right not to be a victim of 
war”. In this context I think particularly of the pio- 
neering work carried out by the recently founded 
Tricontinental Institute for Parliamentary Democ- 
racy and Human Rights and by Captain Cousteau 
and his associates. We know that war does not stop 
when the guns fall silent but continues long after, 
to the detriment of those who were not respon- 
sible for it. The acknowledgment of this new right 
for future generations is part of the culture of 
peace for which UNESCO is working. 
If it is true, as the French philosopher Henri 
Bergson once said, that “the idea of the future is 
more fertile than the future itself”, we must start to 
work on this idea, extract all we can from it, and 
ensure that it flourishes. The rights of future gen- 
erations are the duties of today’s generations. Their 
lives tomorrow depend on the concern we show 
for them today. |

lished in 1554, of the adventures of a 
maverick hero born, as his name suggests, 
on the banks of the River Tormes, who 
does his best to get through life without 
overburdening himself with ethical con- 
siderations or lofty sentiments. This story 
marked the birth of Spanish picaresque 
literature and is one of the sources of the 
modern novel. As for La Celestina, or La 
Tragicomedia de Calisto y Melibea 
(1499), it was probably written in Sala- 
manca by Fernando de Rojas. With its 
pair of tragic lovers and the unforgettable 
character of La Celestina, an aged bawd- 
cum-witch, the play is one of the most 
important forerunners of modern theatre.

A third figure who did much to bring 
fame to Salamanca is that of the stu- 
dent. In the Spain of the Golden Cen- 
tury, the student figure who features in 
so many stories and plays always hails 
from Salamanca. He is generally quar- 
relsome and ne’er-do-well (the meaning 
of the word picaro), but above all 
bursting with youthful vitality. He 
enjoyed an eventful literary career 
which lasted until José de Espronceda y 
Delgado’s The Student of Salamanca in 
the nineteenth century. Even today,

THE OLD CATHEDRAL 
The courtyard known as the Patio Chico 
affords the finest view of the cathedral of 
Santa Maria de la Sede (known as the Old 
Cathedral, to distinguish it from the 
New Cathedral built next to it three cen- 
turies later). It was erected between the 
beginning of the twelfth century and the 
end of the thirteenth, which explains 
why the original fortress-like building 
gradually became lighter, in both senses 
of the word, under Gothic influence. 
The monumental lantern-tower known 
as the Torre del Gallo (the Cock’s Tower), 
which tops the building, even has an ori- 
ental quality. Its lower section, which is

flanked by four turrets, rises to a Byzan- 
tine-style cupola. This almost improvised 
arrangement resulted from changes made 
to the original plan by master architect 
Pedro Pérez with the aim of covering the 
naves. The elegant solution he devised is a 
model of architectural creativity. 
The Old Cathedral is remarkable 
not only for its wealth of architectural 
interest, the abundance of its decora- 
tion (capitals, paintings and sculptures) 
and the inventive fantasy of the vault in 
the Talavera Chapel (eight semicircular 
arches, arranged in parallel pairs, all of 
them different, which do not meet at 
the keystone), but also because it used 
to house the Ecclesiastical School, first 
mentioned in 1130, which later became 
the University. It was there, in the 
Santa Barbara Chapel, that examina- 
tions and degree ceremonies were held 
for centuries. 
THE UNIVERSITY 
Patio de Escuelas, a small square over- 
looked by the monumental facade of 
the University, is a masterpiece dating 
from the early seventeenth century. It is 
lined with the buildings that form the 
heart of the old University complex: the 
Escuelas Mayores and Menores and the 
Estudio Hospital (which now houses the 
Vice-Chancellery). It was in 1218, at 
the behest of Alfonso IX, that the 
Ecclesiastical School broadened its cur- 
riculum fo include general studies. 
From 1255 on, the University of Sala- 
manca ranked among the most famous 
centres of learning in Christendom, 
alongside Oxford, Paris and Bologna. 
The University’s golden age came in 
the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. 
The Escuelas Mayores were built 
between 1415 and 1433. The founda- 
tion stone of the hospital was laid in 
1413. The portal of the Escuelas 
Menores (an establishment providing 
secondary education) was built in 1533. 
The courtyard onto which these build- 
ings give includes rows of multifoil 
Gothic arches—a sophisticated combi- 
nation of curves and countercurves 
which rank alongside other hidden trea- 
sures to be found in Salamanca’s many 
inner courtyards (in the Casa de las Con- 
chas, the Palacio de Fonseca, and the 
University’s upper cloister). 
The Estudio Hospital was built in the 
Gothic style on the spot where Raymond 
of Burgundy’s palace once stood, and 
which was traditionally thought to be 
the site of the ancient Roman pretorium.

### 102566: The Golden stones of Salamanca

The Plateresque decoration of the 
friezes borrowed many stylistic elements 
from the Italian Renaissance: fauns (one 
of whom is shown engaged in amorous 
activity), cartouches, foliated scrolls and 
grotesque masks. 
The University’s early-sixteenth-cen- 
tury portal, which is also in the 
Plateresque style, seems to thrust for- 
ward its convoluted decoration of 
The cloister of the kings (16th 
century) in the Convent of San 
Esteban.

grotesques, coats of arms and medal- 
lions almost defiantly. It contains in code 
an overview of Renaissance civilization 
with, in its lower section, medallion por- 
traits of the Catholic kings and, above, 
some admirable representations of Her- 
cules and Venus. 
What confers unity on these buildings, 
as it does on all those in Salamanca, is the 
material of which they are built: a red- 
dish-gold stone from the Villamayor 
region. The statue of the theologian, poet 
and philosopher Fray Luis de Léon, which 
stands majestically in the middle of Patio 
de las Escuelas seems silently to approve 
the lines of the poet Miguel de Unamuno: 
“The stones where your soul is enclosed/ 
Are the colour of ripe ears of corn.” The 
monumental portal leads to cloisters, 
around which are arranged the lecture 
halls and the ancient University Library 
(founded in 1254, it is the oldest univer- 
sity library in Europe). The room where 
Fray Luis de Leon used to teach looks 
exactly as it did on that day in 1577 
when, after spending many months in the 
Inquisitors’ jails, he greeted his students 
with the celebrated “As I was saying the 
other day. . . ,” thus stylishly drawing a 
veil over the persecution he had suffered. 
With its twin rows of benches consisting 
  
simply of squared-off wooden beams 
facing a professorial chair that is doomed 
to remain empty for ever, this stark room 
has a strangely magnetic feel about it. 
It was in the adjoining hall that, three 
centuries later, the Vice-Chancellor of 
the University crossed swords with the 
Francoist General Millan Astray, who had 
just exclaimed: “Death to the intellec- 
tuals! Long live death!” The Vice-Chan- 
cellor rose to his feet and said: “This is 
the temple of intelligence, and you have 
just desecrated it. Victory will be yours, 
but you shall not carry conviction, for to 
 
Facade of the Casa 
de las Conchas, or 
House of Shells (early 
16th century).

convince and persuade you need some- 
thing which you lack: reason and a just 
cause.” In the uproar caused by his 
remarks, soldiers had to “see him home”. 
The incident took place on 12 October 
1936, three months after the beginning 
of the Civil War, and the Vice-Chan- 
cellor’s name was Miguel de Unamuno. 
If we leave the University, after one 
last look at the statue of Fray Luis de 
Leon bathed in the light of the blue 
autumn sky, and take Calle Libreros and 
Calle Serranos, we come to the cross- 
roads of Calle Compafia, an architectural 
Crowning glory of

Benito, the scene of many bloody events 
in Spanish history, the baroque outlines 
of the Monterey Palace rise before us. 
Unamuno wrote as follows about the 
palace’s tower, which he contemplated 
every day from his window: “These stones

that, facing Nature, there was a

They will remain to show the universe 
that there was reflection, order and equi- 
librium.” Unamuno died on the last day 
of the tragic year 1936, but his statue, 
like that of Fray Luis de Leon, continues 
to proclaim loud and clear the right to 
think of freedom and the right to 
freedom of thought. 
PLAZA MAYOR 
A stone’s throw away is the square, as it 
is known in Salamanca. Reflection, order 
and equilibrium seem to be the quali- 
ties sought by the architects of Plaza 
Mayor, which was built between 1729 
and 1735. It is remarkable for its fine 
proportions and the elegance of its dec- 
oration, which is at once baroque and 
  
 
sober. Plaza Mayor is, in a sense, Sala- 
manca’s open-air salon, where everyone 
likes to foregather. 
It is always thronged with people, 
whatever the time of day or night, or 
the time of year. But they do not go 
there just to be seen. Every inhabitant 
of Salamanca hastens back to Plaza 
Mayor after a trip away from the city, 
to make sure that it has not changed 
and that the colour of the sky above it is 
still as pure as ever, and to meet old 
friends who also love this unique 
square. To cross Plaza Mayor, stroll 
around it and enjoy its atmosphere is to 
belong to Salamanca. |

Waste-free manufacturing—feasible 
goal or wild goose chase? 
G reylag Geese

TT SET ey 
FRANCE BEQUETTE 
is a Franco-American 
journalist 
specializing in 
environmental 
questions. 
A ore to the United 
Nations Industrial Develop- 
ment Organization (UNIDO), 
world economic output is 
expected to double between now 
and 2010. In developing countries 
it is anticipated to nearly triple. 
It is vital, therefore, to identify 
manufacturing technologies that 
produce a minimum of waste and 
encourage their widespread use 
internationally, as well as pre- 
venting pollution at its source. As 
waste storage and treatment 
become more and more costly, 
“zero waste” manufacturing is in 
everybody’s interest. 
It was against this background 
that the United Nations Univer- 
sity (UNU, see box page 44) 
launched a long-term research 
programme known as the Zero 
Emission Research Initiative 
(ZERI). The aim of the pro- 
gramme, which is the brainchild 
of Gunter Pauli, an advisor to the 
UNU’s Rector, is to achieve tech- 
nological breakthroughs that will 
facilitate manufacturing without 
any form of waste. 
RESEARCH 
INTO ECOTECHNOLOGY 
  
The ZERI programme is based on 
the principle that the ideal indus- 
trial system is one where total 
input equals total output, i.e. the 
by France Bequette 
raw materials used in the manu- 
facturing process are fully used. 
The programme has a four-step 
approach. Firstly, it is compiling 
lists of the types of waste prod- 
ucts that can be returned to 
industry for use as raw materials. 
Secondly, it is suggesting that cer- 
tain industries should co-operate 
in “clusters”, with waste from one 
industry being used as raw mate- 
rials by other members of the 
cluster. Thirdly, it is encouraging 
the search for technological 
breakthroughs that 
improve the cost-effectiveness of 
this 
would 
kind of reorganization. 
Lastly, the programme calls for

government backing which is nec- 
essary if its aims are to be real- 
ized on a large scale. 
A number of companies agreed 
to take part in the programme, 
and five core projects were 
selected for research into indus- 
trial clustering. The industries 
concerned were fish farming and 
the brewing of beer and soya 
sauce; sugar; forestry; the paper 
and pulp industries; and plastics, 
cement and construction mate- 
rials manufacturing. Two other 
projects are encouraging research 
into “technologies from nature” — 
the non-waste production of 
colour pigments and waxes. 
VERTICAL 
CONCENTRATION 
  
The brewing of beer and soya 
sauce creates a number of envi- 
ronmental headaches. It produces 
large amounts of solid waste that 
is often simply dumped because 
it is not financially worthwhile to 
convert it to animal food even 
though it has a high protein con- 
tent. ZERI suggests that these 
two industries join forces with 
fish farming. This calls for exten- 
sive research into the effluents 
and solid wastes produced by 
oe 
  
breweries and the best way of 
feeding them directly to fish, the 
fish best suited to 
absorb waste from breweries, and 
varieties 
algae which could absorb waste 
from fish ponds and, thanks to 
sunlight and oxygen, convert it 
back into feedstuff for the fish. 
Another problem faced by the 
beer and soya sauce industries is 
that of cleaning returned bottles 
and bottling machines. Harsh 
chemicals such as caustic soda 
and sterilizing agents are widely 
used, and as a result cleaning has 
to be done twice, once with chem- 
icals and once with water to rinse 
out the chemicals. If sugar-based 
cleaners such as APG (alkyl 
polyglucose currently used in cos- 
metics and pharmaceuticals) were 
used, waste water could be 
directly channeled to fish-farming 
ponds. As the ZERI programme 
sees it, vertical concentration of 
these industries would bring 
mutual benefit and would be an 
ideal solution for recycling waste. 
Another example, albeit on a 
smaller scale, concerns recycling 
branches and foliage from felled 
trees. The leaves of some tree 
species can be used to produce 
perfume, essential oils, colour 
pigments, and stabilizers (preser- 
vatives) used in food processing. 
Unlike the synthetic products 
that are currently used, all these 
natural products are biodegrad- 
able. The distillation process 
used to obtain them is often 
highly energy-intensive, but small 
wood debris could be used in 
mobile distillation units that 
would operate at the felling site. 
At the end of the operation 
residues from distilling could be 
used as a soil enricher. In this way 
the trees would be fully used, 
and highly skilled jobs would be 
created for foresters.

Everyone is in favour of recycling 
Bottles for paper, but not everyone knows that 
recycling. itis an expensive operation and one 
that causes pollution. De-inking is 
inefficient (only 65 to 80 per cent 
of ink is effectively removed). A lot 
of water is needed and highly pol- 
luting toxic sludge is produced. In 
short, recycled paper is more 
expensive to produce than new 
paper. It will be necessary to 
develop de-inking technologies 
using enzymatic, microbiological, 
biochemical or magnetic methods, 
and produce a new ink that will be 
easier to detach from paper. The

The United Nations University (UNU), which was founded in 
1973 and has been operational since September 1975, is an 
autonomous body operating under the joint auspices of the 
UN and Unesco. More than a university in the strict sense of 
the term, it consists of a network of institutions which serve 
as a bridge between the universities of the industrialized and 
developing countries. In addition to a central co-ordinating 
body at its headquarters in Tokyo (Japan), the UNU has five 
research and training centres around the world. The major 
themes studied are universal human values, economics and 
development, global life-support systems, new sciences and 
technologies and the dynamics of populations and their well- 
being. The environment is a constant that features in all UNU 
programmes.

resulting waste—sludge and short 
fibres—could be used in the 
building industry as a substitute 
for asbestos or for making sound- 
proof panels and corrugated card- 
board. 
Meanwhile, fly ash from incin- 
erated municipal waste and slack 
from the iron and steel industry 
could be converted into high- 
value-added raw materials for the 
construction business, as 1s 
already being done with coal 
dust. Limestone and gypsum are 
used in the cement industry and 
could partly be produced from 
these wastes. To be completely 
efficient, however, the size of the 
cement factory must correspond 
to the size of the town and the 
volume of waste incinerated. 
NOT STRICTLY 
FOR THE BIRDS

encourages research into tech- 
ZERI programme also 
nologies based on processes and 
systems that are well known to 
nature but not to humankind. To 
date only the pharmaceutical 
industry has investigated these 
possibilities. 
Take the case of colours, 
which are used in industries 
ranging from textiles to cars and 
from cosmetics to food. Industry 
has developed some 4,500 colour 
pigments, most of them based on 
petrochemicals. In textiles, most 
of the colour pigments are wasted 
in the water and only a fraction 
sticks to the fibres. In countries 
where there are strict environ- 
mental protection laws, compa- 
nies are obliged to treat the pol- 
luted water at great expense. 
This partly explains why many 
textile companies have moved to 
developing countries where pro- 
duction costs are lower and envi- 
ronmental constraints not so 
severe. 
The painting process used in 
the automobile industry has 
changed considerably over the 
past twenty years, largely due to

the introduction of powder- and 
water-based paints. These newer 
techniques do not produce the 
sludge once made by car-paint 
workshops, which is handled as 
special industrial waste and incin- 
erated with great care. However, 
metallic paints remain a potential 
health hazard. 
To solve these problems the 
UNU suggests studying birds. 
The 
feathers of several tropical birds 
brilliant colours of the 
are not based on colour pigments 
but on the refraction of light that 
offers the variety of colours of the 
the 
refraction of light in synthetic 
rainbow. Research into 
fibres can build on optic fibre pro- 
duction technologies developed in 
telecommunications, although a 
lot of work still needs be done 
before this technology can be 
applied to automobiles. 
Birds have another original gift 
to offer us. They produce various 
kinds of wax that are essential for 
their survival. Oddly enough their 
 
feather wax is liquid and easy to 
apply at -30° C, whereas it solidi- 
fies in the +40° Celsius heat of the 
tropics. The ZERI study will con- 
centrate on migrant birds such as 
geese that fly at high altitudes 
between the North Pole and the 
Equator. Synthetic waxes that 
protect the paint on cars, trains, 
aircraft and satellites and reduce 
their friction are both polluting to 
produce and non-biodegradable. 
Before applying this process in 
industry, the molecular structure 
of wild goose wax must be studied 
in order to solve the mystery of 
why it remains liquid at very low 
temperatures and solidifies in 
great heat. |

### IGNORE

   
  
THE SWAN SONG OF THE COW? 
Up to 1,500 of the world’s 4,000 to 5,000 domestic animal breeds may eventually disappear, 
according to the new edition of FAO's “World Watch List for Domestic Animal Diversity”. Because 
of the rapid spread of high-yield commercial breeds, the genetic resources of certain animals are 
becoming impoverished. One case is that of Europe's dairy-cattle population, which is now dom- 
inated by the Holstein breed. Conservation of animal genetic diversity is essential because it 
allows farmers to select stocks and develop new breeds in response to environmental changes, 
threats from disease, and consumer demands. 
FROM WORM TO 
WATCHDOG 
Genetic engineering carried out at the Univer- 
sity of Nottingham (United Kingdom) on a 
transparent aquatic worm, Caenorhabditis ele- 
gans, has endowed it with the capacity to turn 
royal blue when it comes into contact with 
toxic chemical waste or heavy metals. Since 
the intensity of the blue is proportional to the 
degree of pollution and the worm takes only a 
few hours to change colour, it may well 
become an efficient watchdog for monitoring 
water quality. 
INSURANCE COMPANIES 
ACCOUNT FOR THE 
ENVIRONMENT 
The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change says that climate changes caused by 
human interference with the environment 
have already begun and that an increase in 
natural disasters such as floods, droughts 
and hurricanes is to be expected. The United 
 
Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has 
pointed out that more than $50 billion com- 
pensation was paid out in the wake of 
storms and cyclones between 1987 and 
1995, a period in which the number of floods 
and droughts also increased dramatically. 
Last November, 14 European and Japanese 
insurance companies signed a declaration 
promising to protect the environment by 
introducing environmental considerations 
into their risk-management policies. 
FAO HAS TO TIGHTEN 
ITS BELT 
The budget of the Food and Agriculture Orga- 
nization of the United Nations (FAQ), whose 
mandate is to help the 800 million human 
beings (including 200 million children under 
five) who do not have access to sufficient 
food, is equal to the amount spent in nine 
industrialized countries on dog and cat food 
in six days. For 1996 and 1997, FAQ Director 
General Dr. Jacques Diouf had to propose a 
no-growth budget ($697.8 million). Dr. Diouf

said that he was sensitive to the concern of some member states to 
find savings in order to reduce imbalances in their national budgets, 
but warned against retreating before “the growing needs . . . of the 
world’s poor”. 
A DEADLY NEW ALGA 
Late in 1994, the French Institute for Marine Research (IFREMER) 
detected the presence of a poisonous micro-alga (Heterosigma carterae) 
in several bays on the coast of Finistére, western France. The alga has 
proliferated to a concentration of several million specimens per litre, 
turning the waters where it thrives yeliow-brown. Substances released 
into the water by the algae attack the gills and digestive tracts of fish 
and cause them to suffocate. The reasons for this sudden infesta- 
tion are not yet known. 
AIRBORNE PARTICLES THAT MAY 
COOL THE EARTH 
Scientists now suspect that aerosols (microscopic particles of sul- 
phur compounds and other pollutants floating in the atmosphere) may 
play a role in neutralizing or even reversing the greenhouse effect in cer- 
tain of the world's highly industrialized regions. Aerosols are mostly 
produced by burning fossil fuels but are also emitted by living organ- 
isms and volcanoes. By reflecting sunlight back to space, these tiny par- 
ticles directly affect the amount of radiation entering the earth's atmos- 
phere and may help to slow down global warming. 
GREEN GOLD 
Bamboo (often called “green gold") and rattan generate global revenues 
exceeding $11 billion annually, and some 2.5 billion people worldwide 
depend on bamboo alone for uses ranging from building material to

have led the International Plant Genetic Resources Institute (IPGRI),

Teresa Laredo in concert at Unesco’s Paris Headquarters in 1992, 
aa » Ay 
The internationally known Bolivian pianist 
  
and harpsichordist Teresa Laredo studied at 
the Academia Santa Cecilia in Rome (Italy) 
and the Mozarteum in Salzburg (Austria), 
and later taught at the Conservatory in 
Geneva (Switzerland). She recently carried 
out a study on women composers in Bolivia 
and made two recordings, one devoted to 
works by the Argentine composer Alberto 
Ginastera and by a number of Bolivian 
composers, and the other to the early works 
of Clara Schumann. 
Lela Cy EEE a] 
ISABELLE LEYMARIE 
is a Franco-American musicologist. 
HB You seem to feel that music is 
above all a state of exaltation, 
something almost sacred. . . 
Teresa Laredo: Spanish has a term that 
describes perfectly how I feel about 
music: jitbilo (jubilation). Music is a way 
of experiencing higher states of con- 
sciousness and communicating them to 
others. That is why I love teaching. I've 
often hosted musical events and I enjoy 
improvising for all kinds of audiences, 
flying in the face of barriers and com- 
partmentalization. I like to explore all 
kinds of music and musical tastes. . . . 
HB How did you become so 
eclectic? 
T. L.: When I was a child I danced the 
flamenco with castanets and the zap- 
ateado. I also played the xylophone. My 
response to music was totally physical. I 
also danced my country’s Indian dances.

OF JUBILATION 
LAREDO 
One of my grandmothers came from 
Granada. She had an expansive person- 
ality and sang. The other was Bolivian 
and was more withdrawn. She played 
waltzes and light music on the piano. 
Later I spent three years in Casablanca 
where I became interested in Arab 
music and its influence on Spanish 
music. In Morocco I played the ganun 
for fun, and studied classical harp at 
the conservatory. I like oriental music 
because, with its quarter tones, it 
reveals all the refinements of the soul. I 
also became interested in Indian music 
and have taught ragas on the piano. 
Hl Since the piano is not a 
tempered instrument, teaching 
Indian music must be difficult, 
especially for rendering slides from 
one tone to another. 
T. L.: Yes, it was a little frustrating. 
Later I lived in Sydney (Australia) and 
was fascinated by the music of the 
Aborigenes—their culture, their 
musical instruments, especially the 
didgeridoo, a wind instrument made 
from a bamboo pipe. I found it all 
enchanting. Their music seems to cap- 
ture the sounds of the sea and the wind, 
even the movement of ants. 
HB Some American jazz musicians 
are very fond of the didgeridoo. 
T. L.: 1 haven't got enough wind to play 
the Bolivian panpipes, so at home I hook 
up them up to a sampler, which synthe- 
sizes the sound and integrates it into the 
keyboard. I've done a lot of composing 
directly on this device. When I scrape my

foot on the floor, for example, I get 
sounds that evoke certain cosmic sounds 
when they are processed by the sampler. 
HB Would you call this kind of 
composition concrete music? 
I. L.: Yes, sort of, but combined with 
notes. When I use this instrument 1 take 
myself into the next century. I composed 
Star Dust while gazing at a drawing done 
by my little niece. You see the earth and 
the galaxies and children coming down 
towards our planet. They're like voices, 
vibrations of innocence that help us to 
purify ourselves. They arrive on earth 
and join together in celestial harmony. 1 
am very keen on Andean pantheism, its 
cosmic and solar rituals and its celebra- 
tions of the equinoxes. 
BM You are particularly fond of 
women’s music. . . 
T.L.: What interests me about women is 
that they've always made music while 
they were cloistered at home, at court 
or in convents, Later they played at 
family gatherings and gradually began 
to study in conservatories. Right now | 
am very interested in Amy Beach, an 
American contemporary of Olivier Mes- 
siaen, and in Seymanovska, a Polish 
woman who composed nocturnes that 
Chopin admired. In Fribourg not long 
ago I asked the audience to identify the 
composer of a piece I had just played. 
They all guessed it was Chopin, but in 
fact it was Seymanovska. 
HB How do you manage to 
remember so many works from 
such varied sources? 
T. L.: My memory seems to be tailor- 
made for that. What’s more | have a 
wide range of experience. I've accompa- 
nied ballets, played chamber music and 
concertos and given solo recitals. I've 
experienced moments of ecstasy, espe- 
  
cially when playing César Franck. 
Somewhere in Latin America in a place 
where there was no piano, I even mimed 
piano-playing to taped music in front of 
a rapt audience of children. 
Bl Where did you get your 
enthusiasm for Clara Schumann? 
T. L.: 1 read her journal and her corre- 
spondence with Robert Schumann and 
Brahms when I was thirteen years old in 
Bolivia. Later I met a woman who had 
photographed some documents about 
Clara, and she gave me her archives. 1 
admired Clara. She adored giving con- 
certs; she didn’t play her own works but 
other people’s, and she always deferred 
to her husband. So I said to her with my 
inner voice, “Now it’s your turn. I’m the 
person who will make your work 
known.” 
From then on, I decided to draw 
attention to minor works composed by 
women, those fleeting moments in life 
that men sometimes tend to disdain. 1 
did research and made some amazing 
discoveries. It was thanks to Clara that 
I finally had the courage to start com- 
posing myself. I think I've interpreted 
her music faithfully. It has an aura that 
has to come out in every piece so that 
the music is radiant with the artist’s 
inspiration. 
lB Every note seems to have a life 
of its own. 
T. L.: Absolutely. This explains the con- 
nection between music, poetry and the 
other forms of art. When I compose, 
words and melody often come to me at 
the same time. Music has taught me to 
see our hidden qualities. The magic 
that music gives off comes from our 
inner being, from what one might call 
the soul—which is something unique to 
all of us and at the same time links us to 
others. [| 
six flags

Six flags symbolizing the 
spirit of tolerance were 
hoisted for the first time at 
UNESCO headquarters in 
Paris on 16 November 1995 
on the occasion of the 50th 
anniversary of the signing of 
UNESCO's Constitution, The 
flags were designed by six 
leading contemporary artists 
to mark the United Nations 
Year for Tolerance (1995), an 
initiative spearheaded by 
UNESCO, and were produced 
by UNEsco Goodwill 
Ambassador Pierre Cardin. 
Each of UNESCO s 185 
Member States will receive a 
full set of the flags, to be 
flown in 1996. Here, the 
significance of each flag is 
indicated in 2 brief comment 
by its creator.

### 102576: The Image and the word

As it was... THE UNESCO 
The notion that the book and the printed word are in rapid 
decline gained its widest currency following the spectac- 
ular success of the image and the media of visual commu- 
nication—the cinema, television, advertising displays, strip 
cartoons, road signs and so on. 
But few persons appear to have given much thought to 
the fact that the image owes its success, in turn, to the 
entry into humanity’s arena of large masses of humanity, 
including the newly literate and the totally illiterate. 
The illiterate person undeniably has a distinctive visual 
awareness. For him the whole world is a vast system of 
visual signs and symbols waiting to be interpreted and trans- 
lated. The origin of writing itself, with its slow progression 
from the representation of an object to a form of sym- 
bolism, shows that primitive man used his eyes for tasks 
that civilized man later entrusted io his ears. 
So in the first place, what we are dealing with is not so 
much a decline of the book as a triumph of the image, a tri- 
umph due in far smaller measure to those who have always 
been readers than to those who only yesterday did not know 
how to read. 
If this is so, as [ myself believe, we can expect at any 
time to see a steady decline in the influence of the image 
and a corresponding resurgence of the book. In other 
words, as millions upon millions of illiterate men and women 
learn to read and write, they are likely to abandon the 
primitive, direct language of the image in favour of the 
more elaborate, more indirect language of the printed 
word. 
Modern man, moreover, uses the picture in ways that 
are basically different from those of primitive man. In the 
primitive world, it marked the first steps in communica- 
tion; today it is only a provisional return to conditions that 
are perhaps temporary. The modern world is not so much a 
primitive world as one temporarily “primitivized”. In other 
words, even in the progression from the language of the pic- 
ture to the language of the printed word we can observe 
once again the phenomenon of ontogenesis (the development 
of the individual) which duplicates the phenomenon of phy- 
logenesis (the development of the whole human species). 
That this hypothesis is plausible is furthermore borne 
out by the huge circulation of paperbacks. Between the 
traditional book and the paperback there is not just a dif- 
ference of quality and price. In reality the two types of 
book are profoundly different in nature. 
The traditional book was roeted, indeed still is rooted, 
in an organic, stratified culiural context that has lasted for 
centuries. The paperback, on the other hand, scatters the 
seeds of the culture of all ages and all regions wholesale 
upon completely virgin soil. In the space of a few years, the 
entire population of our planet, only now barely emerging 
from illiteracy, has been inundated, without any prepara- 
tion, with the culture of thirty centuries. 
The danger is that this culture will be not assimilated, 
but thrown together, condensed and reduced to mere for- 
mulas and synthetic aggregations in a vast grinding opera- 
tion of destruction. After which the masses would appar- 
January 1972 
by Alberto Moravia 
Italian writer (1907-1990) 
ently be free to revert to the image, thenceforward the sole 
medium of communication. 
This, indeed, may be the direction taken by Marxism in 
China with its rejection of the past as “Bourgeois”. Mao Tse 
Tung has said that the vast masses of the Chinese people are 
like a sheet of blank paper on which one can write whatever 
one wishes. What will be written on this paper we still do 
not know. 
Besides, the image itself has recently appeared to be 
reaching its limits. The fact that the spectator takes in the 
picture passively, without any effort of interpretation, ulti- 
mately results in the picture itself losing its full force and 
becoming a victim of this passivity. People watching televi- 
sion or a film at the cinema simply do not see what is hap- 
pening before their eyes on the screen; or if they do see, they 
do not really comprehend. Passivity has atrophied their 
powers of concentration, rendering them inattentive to the 
point of blindness. 
Of course, they “see” the road sign indicating a school, or 
the cowboy astride his horse firing his gun, but now what 
they “see” is nothing more than a response to the same con- 
ditioned reflex devoid of any mental reflection and hence any 
communication. Marshall McLuhan admits this when he says 
that “the medium is the message.” 
The decline of the book is by no manner of means, then, 
a certainty. Even if we ignore the fundamental fact that the 
book springs from nature, that is from the faculty natural to 
all human beings to utter words and shape them into orga- 
nized speech, we should not overlook the fact that the book 
is made up of words which are “also” under certain condi- 
tions of poetic creativity, images. Thus there is no substantial 
difference between the image suggested by the book and 
the image that appears on the screen. In fact there is only one 
difference, though an important one: the image on the sereen 
allows for no play of imagination; it is what it is. 
Nevertheless, we must distinguish between one type of 
reading and another type of reading, between one book and 
another book. Reading some books is no more than a simple 
physical exercise. Such books, written for mass consump- 
tion, conventional in content and in style, are not read in the 
full sense of the word but rather are skimmed through by 
the reader: when the eye passes from one ready-made phrase 
to the next, from one cliché to another, the “reader” may 
believe he has been “reading” but in reality he has done no 
more than register the notations of a verbal mechanism that 
is as incomprehensible as it is insignificant. 
For a book to be properly “read” it must first be really 
“written”. If it is true that the book is in decline this is due 
not to the fact that the broad general public does not read 
but to the fact that they read books that have not been 
“written” but merely printed. 
A book, then, must be thought out and created or it is not 
a book. Indeed, the future of the book is bound up with the 
poetry, creativeness, descriptive power and imagery of the 
writing. The future of the book will be assured if we succeed 
in “writing” books; it will perish if we content ourselves with 
merely printing them.
