Two billion people live in the world’s seismic 
zones. In February of this year Guatemala 
was devastated by an earthquake. Where will 
the next one strike...? This issue discusses 
seismic hazards and the efforts undertaken 
throughout the world to improve our know- 
ledge of earthquakes and associated pheno- 
mena, to predict them and mitigate their de- 
- structive effects. Unesco co-ordinates a wide 
range of activities and research in seismo- 
logy and earthquake-resistant building techni- 
ques. Cover photo shows a swaying building 
seconds before it collapsed when an earth- 
quake struck Fukui (Japan) in 1948. Conside- 
rable progress has been made since then in 
the development of quake-proof buildings.

A T two minutes past three on the 
morning of Wednesday 4 Feb- 
ruary 1976, the stresses that had been 
gradually, accumulating deep in the 
Earth's crust under the mountains of 
Guatemala reached the point of rup-

long, running south and west of Guate-

Once again, an earthquake had 
shown its immense power of destruc- 
tion, unequalled even by modern 
- weapons of war; once again, an earth- 
quake took its heaviest toll of human 
lives, among the poorer sections living 
in houses neither designed nor able 
to withstand its force. 
As soon as this disaster became 
known, offers of help flowed into Gua- 
temala from the four quarters of the 
world. The United Nations Disaster 
Relief Co-ordinator sent a special rep- 
resentative to assist the Government 
of Guatemala in co-ordinating this aid 
- and in dealing with the immediate 
problems of rescue and relief. Unes- 
co's help was more concerned with 
reconstruction after the disaster and 
took the form of experts in seismology 
in earthquake-resistant rural housing, 
in school buildings and in the protec- 
tion of the cultural monuments with 
which Guatemala is so richly endowed. 
This was the immediate reaction. 
The basic problem remained: how to 
prevent such disasters from occurring 
again in the future. The answer is 
simple. The earthquake problem will 
have been solved when every house, 
every building and all the other works 
of man in the world's seismic zones 
will have been designed and built or 
strengthened to resist earthquakes. 
This will surely be done one day, but 
it will probably take several genera- 
tions. 
Why so long? The reason is, that

earthquake-resistant design.and con-

DEATH OF A 7-STORY BUILDING

This huge mass of rubble is all that remains of a seven- 
story building (inset left of photo) that stood in the 
port area of Agadir, on Morocco’s Atlantic coast. 
The building collapsed when a major earthquake

struction are known, and the details 
have been worked out for modern 
buildings In steel and concrete and for 
important public works, relatively little 
effort has yet been put into the earth- 
quake-resistant design of rural and 
low-cost housing. 
In the world's seismic zones about 
2,000 million people live in houses, 
many of which they have built them- 
selves, not designed or engineered to 
resist earthquakes. It will certainly be 
many years before the principles and 
practice of earthquake-resistant build- 
ing reach these grass roots. In the 
meantime, even in the cities, we shall 
have to continue for a long time yet 
to live and work in older buildings 
which are not earthquake-resistant but 
which, for a variety of reasons, must 
remain in use. : 
   
to 
   
It is this that makes it so important 
to develop means of predicting earth- 
quakes. This will not prevent damage 
but at least it will save lives if predic- 
tions can be made with the accuracy 
sufficient for public warning services. 
The ultimate goal is: to achieve 
immunity from earthquakes throughout 
the world's seismic zones. But where 
are these zones? It is important to 
know, because earthquake-resistant 
design and construction adds to the 
cost of building (between 5 and 20 per 
cent, according to the type of building, 
the materials used and the magnitude 
of the earthquake risk). 
The main seismic zones of the world, 
the circum-Pacific belt, the Mediterra- 
nean - Alpine - Hindu Kush - Himalayan 
zone, etc., have been known for a long 
time, but it is only recently that the 
to exist: whole sections were totally destroyed, 
10,000 persons were killed and 12,000 injured out of iy 
tal population of 33,000. x

concepts of plate tectonics (continental 
drift) have provided a logical expla- 
nation of the large-scale pattern of 
seismicity. 
‘What still remains to be done in 
most parts of the world is to study 
and define this pattern in more detail 
and to express our knowledge of the 
earthquake phenomenon in terms that 
are useful to the architect and the 
design engineer. For them, it is not 
sufficient simply to know that the risk 
of earthquake exists; this risk has to 
be quantified in terms of the prob- 
ability of occurrence of certain accel 
erations’ or velocities of ground 
movement. : 
These and many other problems 
were discussed at an inter-govern-

SS AE RE NE rN De 
p was held at Unesco headquarters in 
Paris on 10-19 February 1976, only a 
few days after the catastrophic earth- 
quake in Guatemala. Over 180 per- 
sons attended this conference, includ- 
ing the delegates of 52 member states 
of Unesco and the representatives of 
15 international organizations. 
The conference had two main objec- 
tives: firstly, to examine the present 
state of knowledge regarding earth- 
quakes and the means of protection 
against them; secondly, to identify the 
obstacles which prevent the fullest 
possible use being made of existing 
knowledge, and to seek ways of over- 
coming them. In other words, the 
conference looked at the earthquake 
problem from the governmental rather 
than from the purely scientific and 
technical point of view. 
The conference thus differed from 
other international meetings on this 
subject, in that it discussed not only 
the nature of earthquakes and the 
engineering means to reduce ° the 
losses caused by them, but also their 
human, social and economic impli- 
cations. 
Some of the most interesting and 
fruitful discussions were those which 
took place between seismologists, 
social scientists, insurance experts 
and civil defence specialists. It was 
clear that much still remains to be done 
in order to provide policy makers with 
the data on which to base government 
decisions with regard to investment in 
earthquake research, in protective 
measures, or in insurance, 
- Another scientific subject with im- 
portant human, social and economic 
overtones is that of earthquake pre- 
diction. The general feeling before

the conference was that, although the 
prediction of earthquakes as a scien- 
tific exercise might well become 
feasible within the next few years, at 
least in areas subjected to intense 
instrumental surveillance, it would 
probably be a long time before the 
degree of accuracy required by a 
public warning service was achieved. 
Furthermore, there was reason to 
believe that, in many social contexts, 
the announcement of an impending 
destructive earthquake might have 
consequences almost as serious as 
the earthquake itself, not to speak of 
the adverse reaction that might be 
expected from the public to any false 
alarm. 
The conference therefore listened 
with particular interest to the report 
of the Chinese delegation on the 
methods used in that country, and pp

p particularly on the successful predic- 
tion of the earthquake at Hai Cheng 
on 4 February 1975 (see article Ey ’ 
page 11). 
The wide range of scientific tech- 
niques employed and, above all, the 
involvement of large numbers of ama- 
teur observers in efforts to detect the 
signs of imminent earthquake shocks, 
were of particular interest and demon- 
strated that, in the Chinese context 
at least, an earthquake warning system 
can be made to operate successfully. 
The ensuing debate on this subject 
showed that, while the general scien- 
tific approach to the earthquake pre- 
diction problem was the same in all 
countries, the social problems raised 
by earthquake forecasting were likely 
to differ widely from country to 
country. 
The conference adopted over 40 res- 
olutions on technical matters, whose 
implementation will demand many 
years of effort on the part of Unesco 
and of its member states. Will this 
effort be made? In these days of 
financial stringency, this is a question 
that may well be asked. Although no 
immediate answer can be given, it is 
worth looking back at the years that 
have passed since the first inter- 
governmental conference on earth- 
quakes in 1964 and noting the progress 
that has been made since then: 
  
® establishment of an International 
Seismological Centre (in the United. 
Kingdom) which uses one of the 
world's fastest computers to process 
the data coming into it from observ. 
atories all over the world and to 
produce its definitive monthly bulletin 
of earthquakes;

carry out considerable research into earthquake-resistant construction. 
EARTHQUAKES MADE TO MEASURE. Soviet Central Asia is a region nf 
intense seismic activity. Violent earthquakes destroyed almost all the old 
buildings of Ashkhabad, capital of Turkmenistan, in 1948 and those of 
Tashkent, capital of Uzbekistan, in 1966. Earthquake risk was thus an 
important factor in plans to rebuild these two cities. Soviet specialists have 
developed special “vibrating machines” enabling them to subject buildings 
to the equivalent of seismic shocks. Left, technicians set up the vibrating 
machine on a rooftop in Alma Ata, capital of Kazakhstan. At the Research 
Institute of Geophysics and Earthquake Engineering in Leninakan, Soviet 
Armenia, scientists have established that there exists in certain rocks a 
type of magnetization, sensitive to mechanical stress, whose changes 
can be used to help forecast earthquakes. The Institute is therefore deve- 
loping the instrumentation required for monitoring these changes. Ph

pecially that resulting from the filling 
of large reservoirs (see page 23). 
Many of these achievements de- 
pended of course upon the financial 
support received from the United 
Nations Development Programme. 
Others may be cited, but the point has 
been made that progress in this field, 
although slower than some might have 
wished, has been steady and may be 
expected to continue in the future, 
despite financial uncertainties. 
This is because there Is a basic 
economic justification for this work. 
‘A single earthquake may cost a 
country more than its annual national 
budget and may set back Its economic 
progress by 5 or 10 years. Since 1964, 
more than 100,000 human lives have 
been claimed by earthquakes and the 
damage caused by. them throughout 
the world must be reckoned in billions 
of dollars. The cost of seismological 
research, of seismic zoning, of earth- 
quake prediction and even of earth- 
quake-resistant building is small in 
comparison. 
We now know enough about the 
cause of earthquakes, the slow but 
inexorable movements of the crust 
driven by forces deep within the earth, 
to be convinced that these movements 
have been going on since our planet 
was formed and will probably continue 
for thousands of millions of years in 
the future. They are part of the “life - 
process” of the earth by which the 
crust is constantly renewed and which, 
by the way, is responsible for the 
formation of the minerals on which our 
present civilization is based. 
The instantaneous destruction and 
loss of life inflicted by earthquakes 
can only be compared with that inflict- 
ed by modern weapons of war. It 
seems right, therefore, that Unesco, 
which seeks to prevent such human 
folly, - should equally be concerned 
with protecting mankind from nature's 
violence. 
We have been too long accustomed 
to people dying in earthquakes. We 
must learn to live with them.

### 49527: China predicts a major earthquake and saves an entire population from disaster

For the first time in history 
CHINA PREDICTS A MAJOR 
EARTHQUAKE AND SAVES 
AN ENTIRE POPULATION | 
FROM DISASTER 
by Dan Behrman 
A N international scientific meet- 
ing at Unesco headquarters in 
Paris took a dramatic turn recently 
when, for the first time in such a sett- 
ing, the story was told of a successful 
attempt to predict a major earthquake 
and to get an endangered population 
out of its way. The report was given 
by China to the Unesco Intergovern- 
mental Conference on the Assessment 
and Mitigation of Earthquake Risk, at 
a special session devoted to earth- 
quake prediction. 
The Chinese delegation, headed by 
Liu Ying-yung, director of his country's 
State Seismological Bureau, told of 
methods used to forecast the Haicheng 
earthquake that occurred in Liaoning 
Province on 4 February 1975 with a 
magnitude of 7.3 on the Richter 
scale (1). : 
The delegation also described Chi- 
na's effort to develop a seismological 
network which has been termed “the 
equivalent of an Apollo space pro- 
gramme”. The genesis of the effort 
was traced to the severe earthquake 
that struck Hsingtai in Hopei Province 
in 1966 and led the late Premier Chou 
En-lai to.set a priority on seismology. 
China now has 10,000 professional 
and 100,000" amateur seismologists in 
a network comprising seventeen stan-

edition, "In Partnership with Nature: Unesco

dard stations and nearly 300 regional 
stations. By enlisting amateur obser- 
vers—who include farmers, workers, 
teachers, telephone operators, meteo- 
rologists and radio broadcasters—the 
Chinese have sought to give the 
population at large a role and a stake, 
to put the citizen on the same side as 
the scientist. 
From the very start of the pro- 
gramme, Liaoning Province looked sus- 
picious. Following the earthquake at 
Hsingtai, seismologists noted that the 
epicentre of subsequent smaller shocks 
seemed to be migrating northeast 
towards Liaoning, heavily populated 
and industrialized. In 1970, a decision 
was taken to keep a close watch on 
the province. This involved all the 
techniques in the seismologist’s pano- 
ply, starting with the study of past 
earthquakes and local geology. 
Geodetic surveying across a major 
fault between September 1973 and 
June 1974 showed that the earth's 
surface there was rising twenty times 
faster than in a normal year and tilting 
towards the northwest. During the 
same period, a change was recorded 
in the earth’s magnetic field and tidal 
stations over on the shore of Liaotung 
Bay showed a rise in sea level. Finally, 
the number of small earthquakes in 
1974 was five times higher than 
normal. 
These findings led the. government 
to warn the population that a bad 
earthquake was in the offing. However, 
no one could yet say exactly when it 
would occur and other signs were 
sought. Among these were changes 
in the behaviour of animals. 
The Chinese, in their report to the 
Unesco conference, told of such ins-- 
tances in the past. Two hours before 
the Pohai earthquake of 7.4 magnitude 
on 18 July 1969, a keeper at the Tient- 
sin zoo noticed that his tigers were 
acting strangely and told local seis- 
mologists that “a big earthquake may 
be approaching”. And in Szechuen 
Province in September 1972, a pre- 
diction team announced the onset of 
another earthquake after "observing 
“the panic of chickens, pigs refusing to 
enter pigsties, horses and sheep 
running about frenziedly...” 
- The man in the street or on the farm 
is considered by the Chinese to be a 
valuable source of observations of 
changes in animal behaviour or in the 
level of ground water. 
In December 1974, such changes 
were seen and reported in Liaoning. 
Wells in four communes suddenly 
turned muddy and started to bubble; 
rats and mice left their holes; hibern- 
ating snakes slithered out onto the ice. 
Then a magnitude 4.8 earthquake 
occurred seventy kilometres from 
Haicheng, leading authorities to con- 
clude that something more serious was 
on the way. The local population had 
already been involved in “earthquake 
manceuvres”; now, a campaign began 
to teach every household what to do 
if an earthquake came. 
Though a scientific paper, the Chi- 
nese report is almost a cliff-hanger, 
leaving the reader to wonder what will 
happen next. Early in February, ani- 
mals were still acting abnormally and

in a 
off three times. The report stated: 
“The most peculiar case took place at 
the Shaozihe Commune in Youyan 
Country where gas-bearing water 
spouted forth from ice like geysers.” 
The pace of events quickened. On 
2 February, an abrupt fall in terrestrial 
electricity was recorded at one seis- 
mological station; at another, the tilt 
-of the earth's surface was seen to 
move towards the southwest. 
One wonders just what made the 
Chinese decide when the earthquake 
would strike. Apparently, the last 
straw was a series of small earth- 
quakes that began on 1 February in a 
region that had been almost non- 
seismic previously. 
Seismologists studied the location of 
these shocks and the direction taken 
by their so-called P-waves [seismic 
waves that cause rocks in their path 
to compress and then expand in the 
same direction as the waves are travel- 
ling]. The scientists concluded that 
these were the forerunners of a much 
12 
larger earthquake likely to hit the 
Haicheng-Yingkou region. 
The scientists passed their findings 
to the local government. An hour and 
a half later, a meeting at Haicheng 
decided that it was time to move from 
earthquake manceuvres to reality. 
“Without delay, people were notified 
to build temporary huts, to move 
patients from hospitals, to concentrate 
transportation facilities and important 
objects, to organize medical teams, to 
persuade people to move out of their 
houses, to move the old and weak to 
safe places...” : 
At 7:36 p.m. on 4 February 1975, 
the Haicheng earthquake came at last. 
But, reported the Chinese, loss of life 
“was greatly reduced because most 
people had left their homes. Vehicles 
had been moved from garages and 
farm animals from barns. “Within 
the most destructive area, more than 
90 per cent of the houses collapsed 
to some extent, but many agricultural 
production brigades did not suffer 
even a single casualty. In the Ding- 
jlagou brigade of Haicheng, consisting 
of more than 3,000 persons, only one 
child was Injured.”

a 
ANCESTOR 
OF ALL 
SEISMOGRAPHS 
The Chinese have the double distinction of 
having kept faithful records of earth- 
quakes from very early times—since 780 
B.C.—and of inventing the first instrument 
capable of detecting them at a distance. 
The Chinese ancestor of all seismographs 
was produced in 132 A.D. by a famous 
mathematician, astronomer and geograph- 
er named Chang Heng (78-139 A.D.). His 
instrument was fitted into a large orna- 
mented bronze vessel (as ‘shown .in 
drawing on right and in facsimile, at left, 
in the Museum of Geology at Peking). 
    
  
From Volume Ill "Science and Civilization in China” by 
On one street in Yingkou, 3,470 per- 
sons came through with no casualties, 
although 82 of their 801 homes collap- 
sed completely. “However,” said the 
report, “in certain communes and 
brigades, such as the Shinpengyou 
brigade, two commune members, in- 
fluenced by old ideas, did not believe 
the prediction of a strong earthquake. 
They brought their children back to 
sleep in the evening of 4 February. 
As a consequence, among more than 
3,400 people in this brigade, three 
died in the earthquake”. 
This led the Chinese to conclude 
that if earthquake losses are to be 
reduced, one must not only estimate 
the danger accurately but, at the same 
time, educate those who are at risk, 
making certain that the seismologists’ 
findings do not remain arcane 
secrets. There is a human side as well: 
“Let seismological work be really 
considered as the task of the masses 
of the people as well as of the govern- 
mental seismological brigades.” 
A similar attitude was expressed at 
the Unesco conference by Rasnar 
Stefansson of the Icelandic Meteoro- 
logical Office who told how an earth-

Drawings below explain how it functioned. 
Inside the vessel was a heavy pendulum 
connected to eight mobile arms. At the 
end of each arm a crank operated the 
jaws of a dragon head (eight heads in all). 
Earthquake shocks vibrated the mechanism 
causing the dragon's jaws facing the 
direction of the shock to open, dropping a 
ball into the mouth of one of the eight 
toads placed around the instrument. The 
position of the ball thus indicated. the- 
direction from which the seismic shocks 
had originated.

his country near the end of last year. 
Within a month, it generated no fewer 
than 10,000 earthquakes that could 
be felt without instruments, 100 of 
- them greater than magnitude 4. 
On 25 December 1975, he was able

to tell local sheep-raisers that there . 
was no need to fear any more severe 
shocks. He emphasized that the 
population must be involved: “If you 
explain what you know and what is 
happening, people won't hold it 
against you if you make mistakes.” 
This is all the more important in 
China with a great density of popu- 
lation living in seismic zones. It was 
in China that the most disastrous 
earthquake of all time occurred at 
Huahsien in Shensi Province in 1556, 
leaving 820,000 dead. 
Traditional Chinese houses are 
built’ with heavy roofs that protect 
them from the climate but can prove 
lethal in an earthquake. Replacing 
them with earthquake-resistant hous- 
ing is a long job. Until it can be 
done, prediction is the best safeguard. 
The Chinese delegation stated that 
more than ten earthquakes with a 
  
magnitude greater than five have 
been forecast. However, this is only a 
“small percentage” of all that occur 
because few observations are avail- 
able from remote areas in western 
China. 
Other countries, notably Japan, 
U.S.A. and U.S.S.R., have been con- 
ducting research in earthquake pre- 
diction and reported some of their 
findings at the conference. Dr Robert 
Hamilton of the U.S. Geological Sur- 
vey told how the San Andreas Fault 
in California has been - instrumented 
with fifty tiltmeters in deep and shal- 
low holes while laser-ranging instru- 
ments sensitive enough to ‘detect one 
centimetre of crustal deformation over 
ten kilometres have been set up. 
The tiltmeters have shown the most 
promise. Since November 1974, three 
earthquakes of magnitude 4 or greater 
on the San Andreas Fault were all 
preceded by a tilt anomaly. About a. 
month before the earthquake, the 
+ instruments start to deflect and keep 
on deflecting until it occurs. 
“Precursors do exist and prediction 
is feasible,” Dr Hamilton said, “but 
a prediction sufficiently reliable to be 
Never- useful to us does not exist.” 
theless, it was the policy of the U.S. 
Geological Survey to inform the pub- ° 
lic of what it observes, rather than 
withhold information for fear of rai- 
sing an alarm. “We see no alterna- 
tive,” said Dr Hamilton. 
One should note that stakes are not 
the same everywhere. In the United 
States, only 1,600 lives have been 
lost to earthquakes during the entire 
history of the country and the typical 
American wooden dwelling can: be 
expected to ride cut most shocks. 
Even so, earthquake prediction in *!. 
"United States is a delicate matter an: 
is likely to be so in any developed 
industrial country. 
An American study has shown that 
property values can be expected to 
drop by as much as 60 per cent in 
the event of the prediction of a 
7.3 magnitude earthquake while cons- 
truction comes to a halt and overall 
business activity declines by a quar- 
ter. Such are the problems that are 
likely to appear in the not-so-remote 
future as the prediction of earthquakes 
is fined down to an exact science.

### IGNORE

On 8 July 1975 the ancient city of Pagan in Burma was 
rocked by an earthquake. Of all the great centres of 
Buddhism in Asia few boast such a concentration of 
religious edifices as Pagan with its forest of pagodas 
and stupas. All told some 5,000 monuments extend 
across a site covering over 70 sq. km. In Pagan’s 
fantastic landscape some stand out glistening white 
against their red-brown weatherbeaten neighbours. 
A Unesco mission was sent to Pagan in November 
1975 to assess the damage to the temples and advise 
on urgent restoration work,

This astonishing spectacle you have

today at the site of Pagan, capital of

which stood on a vast cultivated plain 
of the Irrawaddy river, surrounded 
with fields of sesame, peanuts and 
corn, and villages set among clusters 
of trees. 
Dwellings, markets and palaces, 
built of wood and bamboo, have been 
effaced by the centuries. The only 
remaining trace of secular architecture 
is the wall around the ancient city, 
said to have been erected by King 
Pyinbya in the ninth century A.D.

edifices of all shapes and sizes, some 
assembled in great constellations, 
others in small groups and others 
again standing in isolation. All these

monuments within an area just under 
80 square km are cared for by Burma's 
Department of Archaeology which has 
carried out an inventory of all the 
remains. Monuments at Pagan total 
some 5,000 if all the archaeological 
vestiges are included. 
Pagan has two main 
monument: 
MW Stupas or pagodas, masonry con- 
structions enclosing some venerated 
relic, They frequently stand upon 
several terraces arranged in tiers, and 
are reached by flights of steps on 
each facade. The main structure, 
generally circular in plan, suggests an 
enormous bell surmounted by a deli- 
cately wrought flower-shaped metal 
ornament. 
The Shwezigon pagoda is the most 
famous and attracts numerous pilgrims, 
especially during festivals, occasions 
when traditional theatrical perform- 
types of

ances, music and dancing take place, 
and greate markets are held. The 
offerings of the pilgrims help to 
maintain the gold-leaf coating, period- 
ically renewed over the entire surface 
of the edifice. . 
M Temples, known in Burmese as 
gu or “grottoes” are the second type 
of monument. The name is clearly an 
allusion to the ancient temple-caves 
of Buddhist India, but also indicates 
how they differ from the stupas, for 
what counts here is the space left 
inside for people to walk around the 
statues of Buddha. 
The main structure is usually shaped 
like a cube surmounted by tiered 
terraces, crowned either with a tower 
known as’ a “sikhara" or with a 
masonry bell resembling a stupa. 
Rising overhead Is the summit orna- 
ment with its slender spire. At the 
terrace corners, where the steps lead 
off, there are turrets, urns or 
stupas. i 
The tallest temple in Pagan, the 
Thatbyinnyu, is 64 metres high, the 
height of a 20-storey building, and 
comprises corridors on four levels, a 
wide vestibule, a vast sanctuary, and 
terraces, 
In addition to the temples and 
small 
stupas, there exist numerous mon- 
asteries, other partly underground 
“edifices (temples or monasteries), 
vaulted rectangular rooms known as | 
“ordination halls”, subsidiary structures 
such as walled enclosures and gate- 
lodges, and some ornamental pools, 
reservoirs and canals. 
. The decoration inside the temples is 
mostly the work of painters. The 
paintings, in vivid colours (often dulled 
by time but which careful cleaning 
restores) cover the walls and the 
vaults, either as great panels in broad 
  
=n - - 
compositions featuring numbers of 
human figures, or as small groups 
of individual scenes, frequently ac- 
companied by inscriptions not unlike 
modern comic strips. 
These scenes illustrate the jatakas, 
tales of the former lives of Buddha. 
Colour is enhanced by outline drawing 
felicitously emphasizing expressions 
on faces, details of clothing or 
objects, attitudes of animals, as well 
as depicting decorative plant motifs. 
Sculptors have also left their mark: 
imposing statues of Buddha, smaller 
statues placed in the many niches, or, 
at the Nanpaya temple, four stone 
pillars decorated with extremely beauti- 
ful sculpture carved in low relief.

4 dence provide a more scientific basis 
for a history of Pagan beginning 
with the reign of Anawrahta (1044- 
1077 AD). And although several 
archaeological finds have revealed that 
the site has been occupied since 
neolithic times, the oldest monuments 
of Pagan would appear to date from no 
earlier than the eleventh century AD. 
Anawrahta is said to have conquered 
the Mon kingdom of Thaton (in the 
south-central part of present-day 
Burma) in 1057, and to have brought 
to Pagan Thaton’s captive king, arti- 
sans, workmen, architects and scholars, 
as well as the sacred texts of Thera- 
vada Buddhism, the religion of Burma 
down to the present day. 
The kingdom of Pagan extended 
almost to the frontiers of modern 
Burma, and was to last for two 
hundred and fifty years: it collapsed 
before the Mongol armies of Kublai 
Khan, then master of China, which 
took Pagan in 1287 A.D. The Peking 
court thereupon broke up the kingdom 
into small rival principalities, and the 
"last kings of Pagan were rulers in 
name only. It was from other capitals 
such as Toungoo, Ava, Pegu and 
Mandalay, that later Burmese dynasties 
succeeded in restoring the unity of 
the kingdom. 
However, the city was never com- 
pletely abandoned. Paintings in the 
underground temple of Kyanzittha 
Umin feature Mongol soldiers, showing 
that work continued under their 
occupation. Even later, a few monu- 
ments were constructed, and others 
decorated, right down to the eighteenth 
century. The most celebrated sanc- 
tuaries have been cared for by monks 
from neighbouring monasteries until 
our own times. 
0 N 8 July 1975, this unique site 
was rocked by an earthquake. 
An initial series of vertical tremors at 
6:35 in the evening was followed by a 
few seconds of calm, and then 
horizontal movements in a northeast- 
southwest direction. Amid the din of 
collapsing masonry, monuments dis- 
appeared in enormous red clouds 
which slowly deposited the dust of 
crushed mortar and bricks. 
Staff from the Department of 
Archaeology set out as night was 
falling to assess the damage and for 
several days despatched to the capital 
a growing list of damaged monuments. 
Fortunately, however, the earthquake 
had claimed no victims. 
The tremor reached an intensity of 
8 on the international scale (graduated 
from 1 to 12), and its magnitude on 
the Richter scale was estimated at 5.6. 
The epicentre seems to have been 
quite close. The tremor was more 
intense around the modern village of 
Pagan and along the river, where 
numerous monuments were heavily 
damaged, and less so towards the 
southeast. 
The extent of the damage thus varies 
16 
widely from one monument to another. 
Several factors may have either 
produced a combined effect or can- 
celled one another out. These include 
the site of the building, its mass, its 
architecture, the details of its con- 
struction and its state of preservation. 
Although several monuments col- 
lapsed entirely, it was generally only 
the upper parts which suffered, in 
varying degrees. The vaults of the 
temples of Manuha and Mimalaung 
Kyaung, the upper storey of Guni 
North and of several other temples, 
collapsed into the halls or corridors. 
Elsewhere, damage was limited to the 
superstructures: steeples of stupas and 
sikharas, turrets, terrace walls, etc. 
In general, and though spectacular, 
this damage has not jeopardized the 
stability of these monuments, and 
except in rare cases the work of 
restoration can be progressively under- 
taken without any difficult problems. 
More serious is the structural 
damage affecting the upper part of 
the walls and the vaults which they 
support. Deep crevices reveal move- 
ments of inclination and subsidence 
which may be intensified by the thrust 
of the vaults. 
These shaken monuments have been 
more or less stabilized for the time 
being, but are still in a dangerous 
condition, and major work will be 
required to ensure their survival: 
insertion of reinforced-concrete ties 
and countervaults, interior lining of 
terrace walls, etc. 
The only irreparable damage was to 
the decorations: sculptured plaster that 
fell from outside surfaces and painted 
plaster fallen from the inside. In most 
cases, the fragments shattered upon 
striking the ground and cannot be 
pieced together. A few monuments 
lost half of their paintings in this way, 
but more frequently the loss amounts 
to 10 to 20 per cent of what existed 
before the earthquake. Parts still in 
place, but in some cases loosened, 
could fall at any moment. 
Pagan had already experienced 
several earthquakes: Burma is situated 
in the so-called “trans-Asiatic” seismic 
zone extending from the Mediterranean 
to Indonesia. More than 400 earth- 
quakes were recorded in Burma 
between 1904 and 1975, including 32 
of a magnitude greater than 6. Though 
Pagan is located west of the most 
exposed region (the north-south Pegu- 
Mandalay fault) it suffered shocks and 
damage in 1948, 1965 and 1967, and 
five slight tremors were reported 
between 1968 and 1975. 
Several ancient inscriptions found 
on monuments refer to restorations 
following a seismic disturbance, and 
a history of Burma, written by a 
minister, Twin Thin, relates that under 
the reign of Narapatisithu (1174-1211), 
an earthquake “ravaged the temples, 
monasteries and pagodas, from the 
southwest corner of the royal palace 
to the jetty of Let-Pan, and covered the 
ground with a network of crevices.” 
Hence the earthquake occurred

during construction of the monuments, 
and was doubtless not the only one. 
This explains the great care taken with 
the foundations (which have never 
budged down to present times) and 
with the construction in general: well- 
baked bricks scrupulously assembled 
(at least on the facings), thick walls 
reinforced at critical points with cross- 
pieces or foundations of stone, vaults 
of carefully bonded brick, all of which 
prevented much more serious damage 
and make it possible to undertake the 
work of restoration under the most 
favourable conditions, 
However, the job is sure to be long, 
tricky and costly. In particular, earth- 
guakes must be regarded as a per- 
manent threat, and the work must be 
capable of safeguarding structures 
from at least force-8 tremors on the 
international scale. 
The great number of badly shaken 
monuments will require several work- 
sites to be operating at the same time 
and an order of priority to be estab- 
lished for restoration work. The 
Burmese authorities and people realize 
the size of the job and are resolved 
“to devote a major effort to it. 
J eeoiarey after the catastro- 
phe, effective temporary measures 
were taken: tarpaulins were installed 
on frames and terraces repaired to 
protect the monuments during the rainy 
season, and in numerous cases this 
preserved interior paintings and pre- 
vented further collapsing: scaffoldings 
have been erected and damage surveys 
prepared. Bemoval of debris and 
cleaning up were quickly done, with 
the aid of numerous youth movement 
volunteers from all over Burma. 
Collections among the Burmese 
people have raised three million kyatts 
(approximately U.S. $480,000), and this 
is still intact, since the initial 
work was financed out of government 
An Advisory Board 
was set up to co-ordinate the action 
of several government departments 
and of engineers from the Rangoon 
Institute of Technology. 
However, a job of such magnitude 
and urgency is an enormous one for 
a country to undertake alone, and it 
is to be hoped that international aid 
will be organized. The qualified work- 
force already available at Pagan and 
Rangoon will have to be increased 
and trained in new techniques of 
restoration and consolidation. 
But the lack of foreign currency 
makes it very difficult for Burma to 
purchase the minimum equipment 
required to cope with this urgent task. 
An initial calculation has estimated the 
cost of needed equipment (cranes, 
trucks, concrete-mixers, drawing, sur- 
veying and worksite equipment, etc.) 
at around U.S. $900,000. Numerous 
countries and cultural institutions 
should be ready to share in such 
a worthwhile enterprise.

earthquake of July 1975, Ananda figured on the list of monuments for priority 
restoration drawn up by the Burmese authorities. Photos below show aspects of 
restoration work being carried out on Pagan’s major edifices. Note the dense

FRAGILE TREASURES FROM 
THE TEMPLES OF PAGAN 
Photos on this double page show wall paintings and carvings from Pagan 
temples that were hit by a violent earthquake last year, 
1—Carved in the 11th century on a wall of Nanpaya temple at Pagan (Burma) 
this low-relief sculpture shows Brahma holding lotus flowers. Head of Brahma 
here has three faces. Only one of them can be seen on photo, hence the apparent 
disproportion between Brahma’'s arm and face. 
2—Many of the inner walls of Pagan’s temples are decorated with paintings 
executed on dry chalk plaster. Paintings such as this one, depicting figures holding 
lotus flowers, were gracefully executed in bright colours though some are now 
faded with age. The lotus is often associated with the Buddha. Like the lotus, 
which germinates under the water and rises to the surface to unfold, the Buddha 
is born in this world and rises above it. 
3—Animated scene thronged with figures is part of a large 18th-century wall 
painting in the little monastery of Ananda-Okkyaung, near the great temple of 
Ananda. Detail shows everyday scenes from the lives of Burmese princes, 
including their construction of a temple as a votive offering. 
4—Sikharas, graceful brick towers covered with carved plaster, crown most of 
the temples of Pagan. Fragile and delicate, they suffered severe damage in the 
earthquake of 8 July 1975. Photo shows remarkable example of plaster carving 
on the tip of a sikhara.

### 49530: The Coming earthquake in San Francisco: scientists are certain that a major earthquake will occur in the San Francisco Bay area; the only question is when will it happen

THE COMING EARTHQUAKE 
  
IN SAN FRANCISCO 
  
Scientists are certain that a major earthquake 
will occur in the San Francisco Bay area 
The only question is when will it happen 
by Karl V. Steinbrugge 
A major earthquake will strike 
the San Francisco Bay Area. 
The only question is when will it 
strike. But if disaster is thereby im- 
plied, then why is the San Francisco 
area allowed to grow? The answer lies 
in the plans and actions which have 
and are being taken to reduce the 
seismic hazards to acceptable levels 
of risk, 
Earthquakes cannot yet be predic- 
ted with accuracy as to time, place, 
and severity—but progress is being 
  
KARL V. STEINBRUGGE /s perhaps 
America’s leading expert on designing earth- 
quake-resistant buildings. He is chairman of 
the U.S. National Committee of the Inter- 
national Association of Earthquake Engi- 
neering and chairman of the Seismic Safety 
Commission of the State of California. Since 
1950 he has been professor of structural 
design at the Department of Architecture, 
University of California, Berkeley. 
  
made in this direction (see article 
page 11). The San Francisco Bay Area 
has been chosen as a major study for 
experimenting with earthquake predic- 
tion techniques for several reasons, 
including its potential for having many 
earthquakes in the near future and 
thereby allowing the testing of theories. 
A glance at the comparatively brief 
historic record of this region of Cali-. 
fornia shows that destructive earth- 
quakes have been frequent. Five major 
earthquakes have struck the area 
in the two centuries which comprise 
its historic record. The great 1906 San 
Francisco earthquake had surface 
faulting [fractures in the earth's crust] 
which extended for over 400 kilometres 
apart as much as 7 metres. 
However, the other four earlier 
earthquakes were also very strong. 
These five major earthquakes have 
occurred on two well-known geo- 
logically active faults. The greater of

these two faults (the San Andreas) 
goes through the San Francisco area 
and runs very close to Los Angeles; it 
has often been termed California's 
“Master Fault”. 
Geologic studies show that many 
major earthquakes have occurred on 
this fault over the past millions of 
years, and there is no reason to 
believe that earthquakes on it will 
suddenly cease now. Indeed, precise 
surveys conducted for over a century 
across the San Andreas fault show 
that the islands offshore from San 
Francisco are moving northwesterly at 
the rate of 5 centimetres per year with 
respect to the continent, This consti- 
tutes substantive evidence that strains 
are increasing in the earth's crust and 
are leading to an earthquake. i 
A second line of evidence is the 
fact that the San Andreas fault is 
slowly “creeping”. By creeping is 
meant that the land masses on one 
side of the fault are moving with

CITY IN FLAMES. This striking view of San Francisco in flames was taken 
five hours after the great earthquake of 18 April 1906. Fires raged for . 
three days because water mains had been destroyed and many buildings which survived 
the quake were gutted as flames swept through nearly 500 city blocks. 
Towns and villages along a 300 kilometre section of the earthquake-prone 
San Andreas fault also suffered heavily from the same quake. : 
respect to the other side, but moving 
so slowly that only instruments can 
record these displacements. 
This creep is not associated with 
recorded earthquakes, but is an evi- 
dence of strains within the earth's 
crust. The most prominent example 
is a winery south of San Francisco 
and on the San Andreas fault which 
has been in the process of being torn 
apart at the rate of over 1 centimetre 
per year for at least the past 50 years. 
Certainly, the historic record plus 
the geologic settings are strong indi- 
cations that the San Francisco area 
will experience a major earthquake 
from the notorious San Andreas fault. 
On the other hand, there exists the 
potentially more dangerous Hayward 
fault which goes through major popu- 
lation areas within the suburbs of 
San Francisco. The Hayward fault has 
had major earthquakes on it and fault 
creep is taking place on it. 
It is easy to conclude, therefore, 
that a major earthquake is a reason- 
able probability in the foreseeable fu- 
ture. It is understandable why scien- 
tists are using this area as the first 
major testing ground for earthquake 
prediction research. 
Earthquakes, in themselves, are not 
a significant hazard. The documented 
cases of a fault opening up and en- 
compassing people and then burying 
22 
them can, perhaps, be counted on 
one’s fingers. Landslides can, and 
do, take a-very significant toll of lives, 
but in most cases these hazards are 
relatively self-evident before the earth- 
quake and do not need an earthquake 
to trigger them. The major life 
hazard in the usual earthquake is from 
the collapse of man-made structures 
such as buildings and dams. This is 
certainly true for all of California as 
well as San Francisco. 
The solution to seismic hazards is 
to design and construct buildings in 
such a manner that they will remain 
safe during and after an earthquake, 
with damage limited to acceptable 
economic and functional levels. Idea- 
lly, then, an earthquake would become 
an exciting experience, but not a 
hazardous adventure. 
However, tearing down all existing 
construction and replacing it with 
- earthquake resistant construction has 
overwhelming limitations. Financial and 
material resources simply do not exist, 
technologies are inadequate for some 
cases, and only over time can these 
hazardous buildings be replaced. 
As a result, disaster response offi- 
cials in government and in the private 
sector must evaluate what can be 
reasonably expected to occur since 
the hazards will remain. The United 
States government has completed four 
such studies for areas in which earth- 
quakes are likely to occur and where 
their occurrence would be disastrous. 
Earthquake loss studies for disas- 
ter preparedness should consider the 
problems from three standpoints: 
® Effects on local medical resources: 
This includes damage to hospitals, 
medical supplies at hospitals and else- 
where, bloodbanks, structures housing 
ambulances, and the like. 
@® Demands on local medical resour- 
ces: Planners must know what to ex- 
pect as a reasonable upper limit to 
the number of deaths and injured, 
weigh these figures against the losses 
to medical resources, and plan for the 
needs that must be supplied from dis- 
tant sources. 
® Effects on immediate and vital pub- 
lic needs: Estimates must be made 
of probable damage and its location 
in relation to water supplies and sys- 
tems, electric power, transportation, 
and the other items which constitute 
a community's “lifelines”. Provision 
must be made to care for those made 
homeless from damage to dwellings, 
from fire following earthquake, from 
evacuation due to damage to or failure 
of dams, etc. 
Time of day may be important in 
evaluating hazard. In California, for 
example, most persons will be in their 
quite safe wood frame dwellings at 
2:30 a.m., but many of these persons

### 49530: The Coming earthquake in San Francisco: scientists are certain that a major earthquake will occur in the San Francisco Bay area; the only question is when will it happen

will be in significantly more hazardous 
structures during the working day. 
The season of the year is also impor- 
tant, since landsliding is much more 
likely during the wet season than du- 
ring the dry season, while conflagra- 
tion is much more likely in the reverse 
order. 
The San Andreas fault is associa- 
ted with the largest potential life loss. 
However, the nearby Hayward fault 
has the largest potential to disrupt 
disaster recovery, since many of San 
Francisco Bay Area's “lifelines” must 
cross this fault and thereby be expo- 
sed to rupture. 
For example, major water aqueducts 
cross the Hayward fault in deep tun- 
..nels which cannot. be readily. repaired, . 
and the water distribution system 
-{criss-crosses~the: fault. —Highway-and- 
freeway bridges are located in the 
‘ fallt zone; - Oil lines, natural gas lines, 
"underground telephone cables, etc. 
frequently cross the fault. 
A total of 10,000 deaths in the San 
Francisco area has been established 
as an upper limit for disaster planning 
purposes. This possible loss of life 
is horrendous, but it represents less 
than 1/4 of one per cent of the affec- 
ted population. Fortunately, steps have 
been and are being taken to reduce 
this potential loss of life. 
The 1971 San Fernando, California 
earthquake showed the need for Fe- 
deral Government studies. Currently, 
active and detailed disaster response 
planning to these Federal studies is 
proceeding at all governmental levels 
and in the private sector. This planning 
will substantially reduce the time need-

ed to restore the cities to normal, 
will minimize suffering, and will reduce 
most of the adverse effects of a great 
earthquake. 
Response to seismic hazards and to 
disaster may be post-disaster oriented 
as mentioned above but it may also 
be pre-disaster oriented. While post- 
disaster response is absolutely vital, 
it is pre-disaster response which has 
the greatest promise. 
At local government level, the city 
of San Francisco is emulating the long 
established Los Angeles policy of 
removing or bracing all hazardous 
non-reinforced brick parapets and 
appendages. Worldwide earthquake 
experience clearly shows that these 
hazards .are serious even .in moderate . 
- shocks. 
{ 
At California state level, numerous 
..- legislative matters were acted. upon 
and became’ law after the 1971 San 
Fernando earthquake. The details of 
these laws need not be reviewed here, 
but the following are, in the author's 
view, the most significant changes in 
public policy at California state level: 
® The concept that certain facilities 
vital to the public must remain func- 
tional in addition to being safe. Re- 
cently enacted law is concerned with 
new hospitals, and other legislation is 
being considered for other types of 
installations. Certainly, damage control 
is a new dimension insofar as Califor- 
nia earthquake building regulations 
are concerned, 
® The implication in law that perfect 
seismic safety does not exist. The 
mandatory preparation of inundation 
maps of areas below dams clearly 
implies that risk exists, but also im- 
plies that public policy deems the areas 
to be within acceptable risk levels. 
® Construction in earthquake geolo- 
gically-hazardous areas is acceptable, 
provided sufficient engineering design 
and construction precautions are taken 
to reduce the hazards to acceptable 
risk levels. Thus, one may build 
within fault zones under specified cir- 
cumstances which largely eliminate 
the hazards to life. 
Seismic safety public policy is great- 
ly influenced by events over which 
people have no control. The 1971 San 
Fernando earthquake stimulated exis- 
ting programmes and led to new and 
improved policies. But ‘from past 
experience, fonly too often the rate of 
-hazard_ reduction. decreases. with.time_ 
after the disaster. 
On the pther hand, the State of Cali- 
fornia created a Seismic Safety Com- 
mission which is to study public 
policy and to report directly to the 
Legislature and to the Governor. This 
Commission, therefore, has the poten- 
tial to insure continued progress. It 
has been in existence for less than a 
year and understandably there exist 
no major accomplishments to measure 
its success. But it could be followed 
with careful attention as a possible 
model to be used elsewhere. 
The remaining earthquake hazards 
in the San Francisco Bay Area will, 
in time, be reduced to acceptable risk 
levels, but not until the numerous older 
non:earthquake resistant buildings are 
removed. 
Wm Karl V. Steinbrugge 
DAMS THAT TRIGGER OFF 
EARTHQUAKES 
Lakes used as reservoirs seen in this 
photo of a section of the U.S. Pacific 
coastline, are formed by subsidences 
along the San Andreas Fault in Cali- 
fornia. Here seismic activity has helped 
man to solve the problem of water 
storage. Elsewhere many cases are 
known where dam construction and 
other engineering works have actu- 
ally triggered off earthquakes. Such 
“induced seismicity”, also caused by 
mining and the injection of water and 
liquid wastes deep underground, was 
studied at the first international sym- 
posium to be held on this problem, in 
Banff (Canada) in September 1975. 
More recently (at Unesco’s February 
1976 conference on the assessment and 
mitigation of earthquake risk) a Cana- 
dian geophysicist, D.l. Gough, reported 
that 20 cases are known of increases in 
seismic activity related to the filling 
of large reservoirs. These range from 
micro-earthquakes, detectable only 
with sensitive seismographs, to a 
major quake which would have cused 
heavy casualties if it had occurred in a 
densely populated area. “Known cases” 
he stated, “suggest that significant 
seismic activity may occur near a 
reservoir if the dam height is more 
than 100 metres and the water volume 
more than 1 billion cubic metres... As 
there are now more than 275 reservoirs 
with dam heights of over 100 M, the 
probability that a given projected 
reservoir will cause earthquakes is at 
least 1 in 14... As some 135 large 
- reservoirs are now under construction 
or proposed, 10 to 15 new cases of 
reservoir-induced seismicity may be 
expected in the next few years.”

earthquakes. The issue of new coin- 
age and the establishment of new 
mints were often measures taken by 
the authorities to relieve regions after 
disastrous earthquakes.’ 
Inscriptions recording public assist- 
ance and private generosity for .the 
reconstruction of destroyed towns are 
equally valuable. Abrupt.changes in 
building materials and methods of 
construction as well as the relocation 
of settlements are all useful in assess- 
ing the relative importance of early 
earthquakes, 
Other factors have also to be taken 
into consideration. Among these are 
population density; uniformity and 
concordance of source material; natu- 
ral exaggeration in the description of 
early earthquakes; and the varying 
attitudes of historians and poets 
throughout the ages to phenomena 
such as earthquakes, which reflect the 
importance they attach to the events 
they are, recording. 
One of the major aspects of the 
research is the identification of large 
earthquakes and the rate at which they 
have been occurring during the last 
2,000 years. Another is the assess- 
ment of their economic and social 
impact on the people in the region 
and their eftect on the environment. 
Search for large earthquakes is not 
limited to the most populous centres. 
"It is usually possible to determine that 
an earthquake felt in large towns, 
where it may be well documented, was 
felt even .more severely and destruc- 
tively in outlying, less cultivated areas 
nearer to the true epicentre, where 
some cloistered sage may have referr- 
ed to it'in the course of a voluminous 
history of his sect or township, or in 
a panegyric on his local ruler, 
Large earthquakes can be identified 
from the size of the area over which 
they were felt, the duration of their 
aftershocks, the degree of damage 
wrought in the centre of the earth- 
quake area and from the economic 
and social impact they have on those 
involved, 
There is little doubt about the size 
of the earthquake of 21. July 365 A.D. 
which affected an area of about two 
million square kilometres in the 
Eastern Mediterranean, between ltaly 
and Palestine, and Greece and North 
Africa. ' This earthquake, one of a

Earthquake shocks subject man-made structures to horizontal forces 
that most of them are not designed to withstand. Though these 
forces do not always totally demolish buildings, their “whiplash” 
effect can result in freakish forms of damage particularly as shown 
in photos 2 and 3. 
1) During an earthquake at Dasht-e-Bayaz (eastern Iran) that caused 
12,000 deaths in 1968, brick and adobe buildings collapsed into 
rubble, whereas “windshafts”, rooftop kiosques providing ventilation, 
remained intact. 
.2) Spire of the Mustapha Pasha mosque after the earthquake of 
July 1963 in Skopje (Yugoslavia). Its tip has been knocked so far 
sideways that the minaret seems to defy the laws of equilibrium. 
The more flexible upper part of the spire reacted to the violent 
accelerations with a “whiplash” effect, the base of the minaret 
acting as the whip’s handle. 
3) Another example of the same effect is seen in the sections of this 
Doric column, dislocated by an earthquake long ago. The column 
supports the capital of an ancient Greek temple in Athens, dedicated 
to Hephaestus, god of fire and blacksmiths. 
4) Railway lines are buckled and twisted as if made of plasticine 
in this photo taken after the 1964 earthquake at Niigata (Japan). 
Four trains in the area were able to stop in time. Their 500 passengers 
were obliged to spend the night in the carriages but escaped from 
their terrifying experience unharmed.

pe half millennia, was associated with 
a catastrophic sea-wave which in 
Alexandria alone drowned 5,000 people. 
Evidence of the social impact this 
earthquake had is found in the church 
calendar. For two centuries the event 
was commemorated .in- Egypt and 
Greece by a yearly festival meant to 
appease the sea and arrest the waves, 
which in 365 A.D. carried boats over 
the walls of towns and deposited them 
on roof-tops, drowning thousands - of 
people. 
Recent archaeological evidence has 
shown the effects of the 365 A.D. 
disaster which marked the end of a 
number of declining towns in Libya 
and Sicily. Hoards of coins found on 
the floor of public buildings trapped 
by the tumbled down masses of mason- 
ry pre-date the disaster and testify to 
the abandonment of these sites. 
Evidence of catastrophic earth-- 
quakes abounds in areas which today 
appear to be free from earthquakes. 
North-Central Iran is a typical example. 
During the last two millennia, sites 
such as Shahr-Reyy, today a suburb of 
Tehran, Qumis near modern Semnan, 
Nishapur and Juvain not far from 
Mashhad, and other places in Kho- 
rassan, were totally destroyed and 
abandoned. 
Indeed, Shahr-Reyy was well known

for its earthquakes even during the 
time of Alexander the Great and the 
Greek name of the locality “Rhagae” 
meant a place “rent in an earthquake”. 
Elsewhere, destructive earthquakes in 
Baluchistan and Oman, in Lebanon and 
Western Syria as well as near Kabul 
and Rawalpindi are known. to have 
caused widespread damage. 
In many instances, particularly in the 
western part of the area being studied, 
official documents of the late Roman 
and Byzantine periods give lists of 
towns that after destructive earth- 
quakes received financial assistance 
from the government, as well as 
remission of all contributions to the 
exchequer for a number of years to 
help their reconstruction. These lists 
make it possible today to assess the 
extent of the area affected by early 
earthquakes. 
The earliest written. evidence re- 
questing such action was actually 
found in tablets from Northern Iraq, 
dating back to the later part of the 
second millenium B.C. This particular 
request came from an ill-defined region 
north of Mosul, which today is con- 
sidered to be almost free from large 
earthquakes. Similar second millen- 
nium B.C. notices have been found 
referring to the inability of the local 
rulers to pay tribute after destructive

earthquakes on the Mediterranean 
coasts and in Syria. 
During our research we have found 
that deterioration of the local coinage, 
taken together with other evidence is 
a good indication of the damaging 
effects of ancient earthquakes. This 
was the case, for instance, in the 
25 A.D. earthquake which destroyed 
Taxila, in Northern Pakistan, very near 
modern Islamabad. The earthquake 
destroyed the mint and apparently kill- 
ed its engravers. Similar cases have 
- been found for Rhodes, Cyprus and 
Western Anatolia. 
After the Taxila earthquake, houses 
were rebuilt stronger, with special 
precautions to make their foundations 
secure. In some cases these were 
carried down as much as five metres, 
a drastic change in building techniques 
noticed also elsewhere, notably in 
Western and Southern Anatolia and 
Syria, where after destructive earth- 
quakes builders reduced the height 
of new houses from three to one or 
two storeys and the lower storey was 
left half buried beneath the fallen 
debris, and thus constituted a sort 
of basement. 
After destructive earthquakes, towns 
were often rebuilt on an extensive 
plan with marked changes in building 
techniques such as unusual types of

foundations, consisting of a grid of 
wooden beams on which the struc- 
tures are built, the introduction of 
timber-bracing of houses and the 
abandonment of ordinary unreinfor- 
ced brickwork. It is often assumed 
that these changes are due to tech- 
niques brought into the region by new 
settlers, or by invaders. This is not 
always the case. 
The acknowledged advantages of 
timber-braced constructions in regions 
subject .to earthquakes have condi-. 
tioned building methods, for instance 
in Anatolia, Crete, Northern Pakistan 
and elsewhere, up to quite recent 
times, and historical as well as ar- 
chaeo'ogical evidence shows that even 
in antiquity such a device was inten- 
ded to give to a building that resilience 
which would increase its resistance to. 
earthquakes, although it would de- 
crease its fire resistance. 
What puzzles archaeologists is the 
use of timber-bracing as a building 
technique in areas situated outside 
the regions where earthquakes are 
most prevalent today. This, however 
can be explained. : 
Studies of areas that have been 
damaged or devastated repeatedly by 
earthquakes during the first 17 centu- 
ries A.D. reveal quite clearly that his- 
torical earthquakes follow not only a

4 well defined pattern but also that this 
pattern in places fits surprisingly well 
that of earthquakes that occurred du- 
ring this century. 
However, studies also show the 
occurrence of quakes In regions which 
today are thought to be free from 
large earthquakes, such as the Dead 
Sea, southeast Turkey and northern 
Syria and Iraq, the central Balkans 
and eastern Iran. Study shows that 
zones which were notorious for their 
destructive earthquakes, such as those 
in northern Syria and Iraq or east- 
central Iran, are quiescent today, while 
zones which are active today, such as 
Anatolia and the Zagros, were free 
from large earthquakes two genera- 
tions ago. 
Individual zones may undergo long 
periods of activity followed by equa- 
lly long periods of inactivity, lasting 
many generations, during which pre- 
cautionary measures against earth- 
quakes in building houses are gra- 
dually abandoned only to be taken up 
again a few hundred years later. As 
was said earlier, the human time-scale 
is minutely short when compared with 
the time-scale involved in the geolo- 
gical processes leading to quakes. 
E ARLY and modern history shows 
that the lasting effects of single 
major earthquakes during the past 
twenty-five centuries would not seem 
to have been very significant for a 
developed and stable .community. 
Soon after a large earthquake, vested 
interests invariably led people and 
their leaders to act once again with 
disregard for the prospect of future 
such calamities, 
Yet modern writers have attempted 
to use earthquakes to account for gaps 
in the sequence of civilizations and 
for large movements of peoples, hypo- 
theses for which there is little histori- 
cal justification. Earthquakes have had 
little, if any, serious influence on major 
or global historical 
They did often account for the prema- 
ture decline of a local economy or for 
a crisis in local human affairs. But 
they have never caused the ruin of a 
culturally advanced state, far less the 
end of a civilization. 
In contrast with wars, epidemics 
and other long-lasting calamities, 
earthquakes, no matter how 
seem to have had little long-term im- 
pact on Man. Personal, political, reli- 
gious and in particular economic inte- 
rests seem to overshadow the lessons 
‘to be learnt from earthquakes. 
Take for example, Antiochia, modern 
Antakya in Turkey. Since its founda- 
tion the city, built partly on very soft 
ground, had suffered from earthquakes. 
"In 115 A.D. the city was almost totally 
destroyed, but because of its strategic 
position was rebuilt on the same site. 
In 458 A.D., Antiochia was almost tota- 
"lly destroyed by another earthquake 
and rebuilt on the same spot although 
it was pointed out to those concerned - 
that reconstruction on the same site 
was likely to be unwise.

developments. - 
large, . 
particularly effective, 
The part of the city on the worst 
ground, on the river, being settled by 
merchants, was of course rebuilt, only 
to be totally destroyed a generation 
later with a loss of 200,000 lives. An- 
tiochia was again rebuilt on the same 
site, this time becoming an important 
religious centre, and was finally 
destroyed in 540 A.D. by the Persians. 
The economic effects that an earth- 
quake may have on a developing 
country or on a poor community are 
more important and they can lead to 
serious and often uncontrollable di- 
sasters, far more important than the 
immediate destructive effects of an 
earthquake. 
crippling of an unstable economy may 
lead to population movements, to a 
latent emigration of skilled people, 
increase in taxation and to undesira- 
ble, though unavoidable, loans from 
foreign countries which may lead to 
economic and social consequences. 
For instance, as early as in the 
5th century B.C. an earthquake in 
Sparta gave the opportunity to the 
subject helots to shake off the yoke 
of their Spartan masters. In 978 A.D. 
an earthquake marked the end of Siraf, 
a declining port on the Persian Gulf. 
In 1139 A.D., Gandja, the former Eli- 
zavetpol, now Kirovabad, was des- 
troyed by an earthquake in which more 
than 100,000 people perished; this 
gave a chance to the Georgians to 
sack the ruined city. 
The "earthquakes of 1157 in Syria 
caused great damage, killing thousands 
of people. They brought about a tem- - 
porary peace between Moslems and 
Crusaders who were too busy repair- 
ing shattered forts to think of serious 
aggressive expeditions for some time 
to come; these earthquakes caused 
little change to the final outcome of 
the crusades, 
An earthquake in 1320 destroyed 
completely Ani, the capital of the Ar- 
menian province of Ararat, causing 
its inhabitants to disperse into various 
parts of the world, as far as Poland 
and Iran. The real cause for the deser- 
tion of the ruined city, however, was 
the decadence of the Mongol dynasty 
of Armenia. 
In 1755, the Lisbon earthquake, on 
the other hand, provided an opportu- 
nity for the rebuilding of the city on a 
grand scale and also for reducing the 
trading privileges of foreigners, thus 
stimulating an already active economy. 
At the present level of technology, 
earthquakes cannot be prevented. Nor 
for some years to come will it be 
possible to predict them in the detail 
required to safeguard the economy of 
a developing country, 
Earthquake prediction was a cons- 
tant preoccupation for the early sooth- 
sayer, astrologer or prophet, and there 
are many instances recorded in his- 
tory of destructive earthquakes having 
been forecasted. Earthquake predic- 
tion is also increasingly preoccupying 
the modern seismologist.” Even when 
accurate, such predictions are not 
since people 
tion was one of apathy. 
The damage and sudden 
seem strangely reluctant to believe 
that an earthquake will occur whether 
it is a credited astrologer or a seismo- 
logist who tells them so. 
History is full of such examples, 
demonstrating that Man reacts to an 
inevitable hazard in a special way, 
distinct from a preventable hazard. 
The earthquake of 1042 A.D. in Tabriz, 
in Iran, was predicted by the chief 
astrologer, who tried in vain to per- 
suade the people to leave. Earthquakes 
had happened in Tabriz sufficiently 
frequently to be likely to occur again, 
yet the main reaction to the predic- 
The earth- 
quake happened and more than 40,000 
people perished. Subsequent pre- 
dictions, allegedly accurate, were in- 
variably ignored, 
The earthquake of 1549 in eastern 
‘Iran was also predicted by the Cadi 
[judge] of that place who tried unsuc- 
cessfully to convince “his people to 
stay out in the open that particular 
night. They refused to listen and 
the Cadi stayed out alone, but finding 
the night very cold returned to his 
house where he soon perished with 
3,000 people in the district. Apparen- 
tly, the Cadi himself was not too sure: 
about his prediction. 
Our research shows that with earth- 
quakes it is not only the prediction and 
warning problems that are important 
but also the social and economic im- 
plications of forecasting such disas- 
ters, False alarms and inaccurate ti- 
ming might create more problems than 
already exist. 
) - ODAY, earthquake prediction 
would be welcomed by scientists 
and engineers, but for the general 
public it is not certain whether this 
would solve more problems than the 
social,. economic and even political 
ones that it must create. 
There is no denying that there ‘is 
at present a lack of knowledge of facts 
regarding earthquake risk in many 
parts of the world and that it is through 
the study of the historical record that 
such facts may become known. In 
spite of the recent rapprochement 
between archaeologists, historians and 
earth scientists, a proper link for the 
study of subjects of mutual interest 
such as early earthquakes, volcanic 
eruptions, weather changes, droughts 
and floods, has not been formed. 
Work on these subjects is being 
pursued singly and with little co-ope- 
ration or guidance from other fields of 
knowledge, a process which is not 
only painfully slow, but one which is 
fraught with danger of misuse of other 
disciplines, 
The need for a co-ordinated re- 
search programme on historical earth- 
quakes and other natural hazards is 
obvious. Such research, the scope of 
which is international and global, will 
give further dimension to. our know- 
ledge of what Nature has in store 
for us. Co

TSUNAMIS 
E VERY island and coastal settle- 
ment in the Pacific Ocean area 
is vulnerable to the onslaught of seis- 
mic sea-waves, the destructive oceanic 
offspring of earthquakes (or seisms) 
and volcanic eruption, 
Some call them “tidal waves”, a 
name as misleading as it has been 
persistent; these great waves are not - 
caused by tides. The Japanese, whose 
islands have felt the destructive power 
of the great waves for generations, 
give us the name used internationally: 
tsunami. 
In 1868 and 1877 tsunamis devas- 
tated towns in northern Chile, and 
caused death and damage across the 
. Pacific. A series of seismic sea-waves 
generated by the eruption and collapse 
of Krakatoa in 1883 killed more than 
36,000 persons in the East Indies. 
Japan lost 27,000 lives to the wave of 
1896, and 1,000 more to that of 1933.

instant after the photograph was taken by an unknown seaman on 1 April 1946, the 
man seen at left (arrowed) was swept to his death—one victim among 300 killed or 
injured that day in Hawaii. The tsunami had been triggered off five hours earlier by an 
underwater quake in the Aleutian trench 4,000 km. to the north. Right, capsized fishing 
boats and smashed buildings on a Japanese beach demonstrate the shattering force 
of tsunami waves generated in May 1960 by an earthquake in Chile 16,000 km. away. 
whose effects were less spectacular 
but which took many lives and did 
much damage. 
Tsunamis occur most often in the 
Pacific. Around this immense ocean 
runs a zone of extreme seismic ac- 
tivity crowned by a volcanic “Ring of 
Fire.” 
This seismic belt extends along the 
major geologic faults, or fractures, and 
the deep oceanic trenches of South 
and Central America and the United 
States, turning westward along the 
Aleutian Island are, then southward 
through Japan and the Philippine Rep- 
ublic; here it branches westward to 
Malaysia and Indonesia, and eastward 
through New Guinea, the southern 
island groups, and New Zealand. 
The phenomenon we call “tsunami” 
is a series of travelling ocean waves 
of extremely long length and period. 
In the deep ocean, their length from 
crest to crest may be a hundred miles 
or more, their height from trough to 
crest only a few feet. 
They cannot be felt aboard ships in 
deep water, and they cannot be seen

the energy of movement—represented 
by a tsunami is impressive: a tsunami

ocean, and it appears that the progress 
of this imperceptible series of waves 
represents the movement of the entire 
vertical section of ocean through which 
the tsunami passes. In the deep

“lanches on the slopes of the Pacific 
trenches may also produce tsunamis. 
Although it has been established 
that a relationship exists . between 
seismic or volcanic disturbances and 
tsunamis, the nature of this relation- 
ship is not well-defined. Tsunami 
magnitude appears to be a function of 
earthquake magnitude and depth, 
water depth where the tsunami is 
generated and the extent to which the 
earth's crust is deformed by the earth- 
quake. But the combined effect of 
these factors is still imperfectly under- 
stood. 
The speed of tsunamis varies with 
water depth, and it is this relationship 
which permits prediction of tsunami 
arrival times at all points in the Pacific 
Ocean area. 
A tsunami warning system and an 
international tsunami information cen- 
tre serving all areas of the Pacific have 
been set up at Honolulu, capital of 
Hawaii. Their work has done much to 
reduce the hazards of the tsunami—the 
most destructive of all waves.

. Using seismographs and tide-gauges 
scientists ‘are able to predict almost 
exactly when a tsunami will arrive at 
a given seacoast since tsunamis are 
known to travel at speeds that may 
average from 650 to 800 kilometres an 
hour, the exact speed depending on 
the depth of water over which they 
pass. : 
But it is still not possible to predict 
what effect the topography of the 
ocean floor will have on a tsunami. 
It is not completely clear, for example, 
why a tsunami's wave may be of negli- 
gible size at one beach, and of giant 
proportions a few miles away. 
What is certain, however, is that all 
tsunamis—like hurricanes—are poten- 
tially dangerous, even though they may 
not strike each Pacific coastline or do 
damage at each coastline they strike. 
So a constant tsunami watch has to be 
kept and the peoples of the Pacific 
alerted when the great waves roll 
across the world's largest ocean. HM 
International 
warning system 
i HE Tsunami Warning System in the 
Pacific is an international co- 
operative operation designed to predict 
the arrival of seismic sea waves 
(tsunamis) and to alert countries 
throughout the Pacific region. In 1965 
Unesco’s Intergovernmental Oceano- 
graphic Commission set up an Interna- 
tional Tsunami Information Center 
which now works closely with the 
Tsunami Warning System in the Paci- 
fic, operated by the United States 
Weather Service from a headquarters 
near Honolulu (Hawaii). 
The International Information Center 
provides aid in the establishment of 
national-tsunami warning-systems and - 
technical advice on the latest warning 
system equipment, It also maintains a 
computerized storage and retrieval 
system on tsunami data. 
Unesco’s Oceanographic Commission 
also established an International Co- 
ordination Group for the Pacific war- 
ning system which today numbers 15 
member countries (1). 
The first tsunami warning system in 
the Pacific was set up in Hawaii by the 
U.S.A. in 1948, two years after a 
destructive tsunami took the islands 
by surprise, killing or injuring over 300 
persons and causing widespread 
damage. Subsequently, the need for a 
broader based international network 
was shown when major tsunamis 
swept across the Pacific—from a 
submarine quake off Kamchatka in 
1952 and from otliers near the Aleutians 
(1957) Chile and Peru (1960) and 
Alaska (1964). 
The present Tsunami Warning System 
in the Pacific operates primarily through 
two lines of detection. The first is a 
network of over 30 seismograph sta- 
tions which pick up the shock waves of 
earthquakes and then determine their 
magnitude and location. If the shocks 
are strong enough and if the focus of 
the quake is under the ocean or close 
enough to it to disturb the ocean floor 
a tsunami may have been generated. 
The warning system H.Q. in Honolulu 
reports the fact to all participant 
countries and issues a preliminary alert 
that includes the estimated time of 
arrival of a possible tsunami. 
The system then turns to its second 
line of detection: a network of more 
ghan 50 tide stations where gauges 
record the cycle of the tides conti- 
nuously. Such gauges record tsunamis 
as abnormal phenomena. 
When confirmation is received by the 
Honolulu H.Q. it alerts all countries to 
the approach of a potentially destruc- 
tive tsunami, 
New operational methods are now 
being developed for the tsunami warn- 
ing system. Use of the latest technology 
and instruments will reduce the time 
needed to evaluate the tsunami hazards. 
The system will use a large network of 
ocean bottom and shore based seismic 
and tsunami sensors to transmit data 
to Honolulu and will eventually rely on 
space communication satellites. BW

### 49535: Was Atlantis an island in the Mediterranean?

Was Atlantis 
an island 
in the 
Mediterranean ? 
( AN the disappearance of the legendary 
continent of Atlantis, described by 
Plato in his Dialogues and the subject of so 
much controversy and theorizing, be explain- 
ed in terms of an ancient seismic catastrophe 
"in the Aegean Sea? Some archaeologists 
believe so or at least that the seismic history 
of the eastern Mediterranean can throw 
light on the sudden collapse, around 
1500 B.C. of the Minoan empire and the 
Cretan civilization, one of the greatest of 
Antiquity. 
y We now know-that 3,500 years ago the 
‘eastern Mediterranean was the scene of 
..bne of history's most. gigantic natural disas-, - 
ters: the explosion (around 1480 B.C.) of 
the volcanic island of Santorin, 100{ km 
north of Crete. The explosion sent millions 
of tons of volcanic ash hurtling into the 
atmosphere, giving rise to intensive atmos- 
pheric shocks and generating devastating 
tsunamis that destroyed many ports and 
towns of the Minoan empire. 
Examining this cataclysm and the theories 
that have been put forward about it, notably: 
by Prof. Spyridon Marinatos, Director of 
the Greek Department of Antiquities, George 
Pararas-Carayannis, Director of the Inter- 
national Tsunami Information Center in 
Honolulu, writes : “Recent archaeological 
work on the island of Santorin unearthed, 
partly submerged below the sea, a comple- 
tely - intact 3,500-year-old Minoan city. 
Excavations by the University of Athens 
uncovered one-, two-, and three-story 
houses and numerous Minoan artifacts and 
utensils. The absence of human skeletons 
from the city indicates that the inhabitants 
had advance warning of the oncoming 
eruption of the volcano and had time to 
evacuate the island’’. The volcanic eruption 
and the tsunamis alone did not destroy 
entirely the Minoan civilization. But for 
two centuries the Minoan civilization on 
Crete was weakened by numerous earth- 
quakes that destroyed its cities and caused 
it to decline rapidly, : 
As for the legend of Atlantis, he concludes, 
“Whether Santorin and the other Minoan 
colonies on the Aegean islands actually 
constituted the lost continent of Atlantis may 
never be known with absolute certainty.” IB 
  
 
Santorin in the Aegean Sea (see map below) was once a volcanic island almost 
1,500 metres high. Around 1480 B.C. it erupted. The crater blew sky-high, 
and then tha whole mountain collapsed, forming a huge cavity in the sea. 
Into this cavity rushed some 62 billion m? of sea water creating waves that reached 
hundreds of metres in height. Then just as quickly excess water rushed out - 
setting off giant waves (tsunamis) in all directions across the Mediterranean at 
speeds of over 500 km per hour. Above, Thira, chief town of Santorin (also called 
Thira) dominates a circular lagoon, where the sea replaced the vanished crater. 
Of ancient Santorin there remains only the little group of islands seen in photo 
below. This, according to one theory, is the source of the legend of Atlantis.

SCHOOL CHILDREN'S PLEA: 
  
STOP THE SLAUGHTER 
OF BABY SEALS 
Sir, 
Shocked by the slaughter of seals 
off Labrador since 16 March 1976, we 
wish to express our surprise and 
distress that such barbaric acts “are 
still allowed to take place in spite of 
"widespread ‘condemnation "in “the last ~ 
few years and protests by leading world, 
figures. 
We appeal to you to urge inter- 
national organizations to do all they 
can to put an end to this horrifying and 
unspeakably cruel massacre, which Is 
‘rapidly leading to the extermination of 
an entire species of animals and causing 
a totally unjustifiable disruption in the 
precious balance of nature. 
In this petition we add our protests 
to those voiced by Canada's “Green 
Peace” organization and the Inter- 
national Fund for the Protection of 
‘Animals, as well as those made by 
France's Society. for the Protection of 
Animals and by thousands of people 
who do not know how to express their 
indignation effectively. 
"We solemnly. promise never. to buy 
anything which has been made from 
the skin of these—or any other—wan- 
tonly massacred animals. Hoping that 
our plea will be heard and that it will 
help to save those baby seals which 
are still alive.

THE NUCLEAR 
NIGHTMARE 
Sir, : . 
* Congratulations on your November 
1975 issue, “30 Years After World 
War II". Of particular interest was the 
series of articles entitled “The Nuclear 
Nightmare® by the Stockholm Inter- 
national Peace Research Institute. | 
wholeheartedly agree with what the 
authors say about the nuclear deterrent 
and the scandal of arms spending and 
the arms industry (and hence about 
economic growth based on arms sales). 
Above all they emphasize the danger 
that the peaceful uses of nuclear 
technology will foster the proliferation 
of nuclear weapons. 
But, | part company with your con- 
tributors when they imply that nuclear 
power must Inevitably be used in 
research and in energy production. They 
"maintain that atomic energy is economi- 
cal and that “the electricity produced 
  
  
Letters to the Editor 
Signed: 
 
by nuclear-power reactors is cheaper” 
(than that generated by coal- and oil- 
fired power stations). 
| do not agree that electricity 
produced by nuclear-power reactors is 
an economic proposition. The Americans 
have published sufficient statistical 
evidence on the operating costs of 
their nuclear-power reactors to prove 
that they are hopelessly uneconomical. 
Harnessing atomic power to generate 
electricity consumes more energy than 
it produces. In most countries this fact 
is concealed because of military and 
political considerations or by a massive 
. conspiracy of economic interests desl- . 
gned to benefit companies with a vast 
range of activities. 
In calculating the cost of producing 
“energy by nuclear power, the following 
factors must be taken into account: 
the costs in terms of energy and capital 
of - prospecting for and .extracting ores - 
for fuel; the disposal of nuclear wastes; 
the costs of reprocessing fuel elements, 
_ enriching uranium and setting up 
control and safeguards systems: the 
risk of accidents. We must also take 
utilization factors into account (remem- 
bering that nuclear reactors are hardly 
ever used to their full capacity) as well 
as breakdowns which sometimes put 
reactors out of service for years. 
You do not say that experts predict" 
that the world's supply of uranium ore 
will run out around 1980-1985, that 
colossal dangers are involved in oper- 
ating breeder reactors and that reactors . 
pollute the environment with liquid and 
gas effluents. If some scientists and 
engineers disagree on these points, it 
simply shows that no scientifically 
proved definitive conclusion has been 
reached in this field. 
Your contributors do not indicate that 
the safe disposal of high-level waste 
for centuries if not thousands of years 
poses insoluble problems. Nor do they 
point out that radiogenic heat acts on 
vitrified wastes, that containers dropped 
in the ocean are only designed to resist 
pressure and corrosion for ten years, 
and that the storage of atomic wastes 
in containers must be carefully super- 
vised, with the substances refrigerated 
and decanted (since radiation causes 
the containers to corrode and fissures 
to develop in them). Moreover, little 
is known about either tectonic move- 
ments on the ocean floor or about 
undergound water movements. Thus 
there have been instances in the 
U.S.A. "of radioactive spring water 
re-emerging near mines where wastes 
have been deposited.

MISSING MILESTONES 
IN WOMEN’S EMANCIPATION 
Sir, 
It is unfortunate that the “Unesco 
Courier” should have omitted some 
important facts in its March 1975 issue 
devoted to International Women's Year, 
The chronological list of “Milestones 
towards emancipation” failed to give a 
true and complete picture of women's 
achievements. Out of 60 places cited, 
less than a dozen are in India, Latin 
America and Africa as opposed to 50 in 
Europe and the U.S.A 
Many “milestones” were missing from 
the list. For example, there was no 
mention of women who have achieved 
high political office in American and 
Asian countries. | have in mind 
Mrs. Indira Gandhi, Prime Minister of 
India, Mrs. Golda Meir, former Prime 
Minister of Israel, and Mme Isabel Mar- 
tinez . de Perdn, who as President of 
Argentina was the first woman to 
achieve the highest political office in 
a contemporary state. 
In my view your references to women 
in the liberal professions gave an 
incomplete impression of women's 
attainments; it would have interested 
readers to have a more global picture 
of women's activities in the world today. 
Prof. Roberto Luis Lihares

Argentina’ 
IN SEARCH 
OF GLOBAL HARMONY 
Sir, . 
In the world today there is a widening 
gap between rich and poor, between 
industrially developed countries and 
developing, non-industrialized countries, 
between the literate and the illiterate. 
Failure to close this gap could one day 
cost millions of lives. 
At this key moment in history an 
important International publication like 
the “Unesco Courier” should discuss 
subjects of global interest with a bear- 
ing on this problem: an international 
economic system designed to serve 
mankind's needs instead of generating 
profits for certain regions of the world; 
new forms of art giving deep satisfac- 
tion rather than superficial enjoyment; 
an International political system that 
recognizes the interdependence of all 
peoples; a new global civilization and a 
world fellowship of nations. 
The task of creating global harmony 
depends ultimately on the efforts of 
 
"every man and woman. And the “Unes- 
co Courier” is in a position to communi- 
cate this idea to the peoples of the 
world,

NOT TO BE 
SHRUGGED OFF 
 
Sir, : 
| am delighted to give my name to 
the 50 children of the primary school at 
Etterbeek and their teachers, whose 
“open letter” on world events was 
published in your February 1976 issue. 
| write this not only for myself but 
on behalf of many persons who would 
be capable of reading such a letter not 
“with a shrug of the shoulders” but 
with pleasure at realizing that such 
children and teachers exist. 
-1 should also like to congratulate 
Mr. Basil Hembry on his acute analysis 
of the arms race, that cancer of modern 
society and its consequences (in the 
letters page of the same issue).

ference last year. The Fund aims to pro- 
mote cultural projects in Unesco Member

as an essential aspect of general dev- 
elopment and as a factor in improving 
the quality of life and’ strengthening

UNESCO LAUNCHES FREE BRAILLE MAGAZINE 
The first number of the “Unezco Braille Review”, a magazine that aims to 
inform blind people on themes in Unesco’s fields of competence, appeared in 
April 1976 in English, French and Spanish.

staff member who lost his sight during World War II, 
It will be distributed free throughout 
and its articles will be 
  
The first issue of the “Unesco Braille Review” consists exclusively of articles 
from the “Unesco Courier". The articles are relatively short (even a 300-page 
novel fills four to five bulky volumes when transcribed into Braille); they deal 
with subjects of special interest to the blind, such as music and travel (“Blind 
people’s movements are often restricted”, says Potter, “but in this way they can 
travel with their fingers"); they have a broad general appeal to help meet the 
special need for Braille literature in developing countries. 
Thus, of the eight items in “Unesco Braille Review” No. 1, “A Stone Age 
Orchestra” and “Music, Dance and Ecstasy” deal with music, the “Journal of a 
Young Burmese Girl” and articles on the Celts and the Eskimos supply arm- 
chair travel, while “An Open-Air Museum in Niger” has a technical interest, since 
the museum has been specially arranged to allow blind people to appreciate it. 
Articles on the world's mineral resources and the work of the United Nations 
Children’s Fund complete the general appeal. 
The English language edition of the “Unesco Braille Review” will be printed 
and distributed in London by the Royal National Institute for the Blind. Early 
production of the free magazine will be limited in the print-run and the number 
of issues—one this year, with two more expected in 1977. 
In an introduction welcoming blind people to “the world-wide circle of readers 
of Unesco publications”, Unesco’s Director-General, Mr. Amadou-Mahtar M'Bow 
writes: “From its very early days, Unesco has been concerned with the impro- 
vement of educational and welfare facilities for people without sight, through such 
activities as the Braille Uniformity Programme, ‘the creation of the World Braille 
Council, the publication of a unique reference work, “World Braille Usage”, and 
in more recent years, Special Education projects for the Handicapped and the 
provision of items of equipment for schools and training centres for the blind 
in developing countries”, 
In conclusion Mr. M'Bow says he regards the launching of the “Unesco Braille 
Review" as “one of the happiest and most noteworthy events of Unesco’s thirtieth 
anniversary year”.

ANNE- MARIE MAILLARD 
‘On 13 March 1976 our friend and’ 
- colleague Anne-Marie Maillard, photo 
editor of the Unesco Courier, died after 
a short illness. She was 32 years old. 
She had been a member of the editorial 
staff of the Unesco Courier since 
1 September 1971. To her post she 
brought a broad cultural background 
. and a youthful eye, alert to original 
and striking illustrations from all conti- 
nents and all cultures. She helped to 
transform our magazine and bring 
distinction to its pages. To her out- 
standing professional gifts were added 
a rare sense of tact and human warmth. 
It is with deep sorrow that we pay 
this tribute to her memory.

(religious jeaders) of the Sikh faith. Born 
at Amritsar in the Punjab in 1621, Tegh 
Bahadur, a musician and poet, became 
spiritual leader of the Sikhs in 1665, at a 
time of growing religious intolerance and 
persecution in India, and took up the 
cause of freedom of worship of the Hindus. 
Detained on the orders of the Emperor 
Aurangzeb, he was commanded to 
change his faith or be executed. He chose 
to give his life for the cause of freedom of 
worship and in November 1675 was be-
