This woman's head in ivory is one of the oldest sculptured reproductions of the human face. 
Named “The Lady of Brassempouy”, from the site of the cave in south-west France where it was 
discovered, this remarkable example of Perigordian culture dates back to between 20,000 and 
25,000 B.C. Men rarely figure in Palaeolithic art and even in cave paintings are usually depicted as 
stick-figures (see back cover) or covered with animal robes. “The Lady of Brassempouy” is now in 
the Museum of National Antiquities, at Saint-Germain-en-Laye, near Paris. (See also p. 33.)

THE EMERGENCE OF MAN 
In the long progression towards Homo 
sapiens, man's ancestors learned to make 
and use different tools. Millions of such 
tools are testimony to early man's skill 
and craftsmanship where the marriage of 
function and design often gave birth to 
objects of great beauty. Cover shows 
three examples from the Palaeolithic and 
Neolithic periods: top an axehead; centre J 
a laurel-leaf spearhead; bottom, a

### 52615: Homo sapiens: 20 million years in the making

Tus issue is 
devoted to a question which 
has aroused passionate ar- 
gument and debate for many 
years: The Origin of Man. 
Recent research has provi- 
ded new answers to many 
puzzling aspects of this 
question. A few years ago, 
Unesco convened an inter- 
national symposium on the 
subject in collaboration with 
the International Union for 
Quaternary Research. The 
proceedings have now been 
published under the title 
“The Origin of Homo sap- 
iens”, produced for the 
specialist (see bibliography 
inside back cover). For this 
special issue, the editors of 
the “Unesco Courier” have 
called upon some of the 
leading authorities in the 
field of palaeontology to 
trace the story of man’s ori- 
gins in simple language ac- 
cessible to the layman. It is 
the editors’ hope that the 
texts and illustrations will 
help to make all readers 
more familiar with man’s 
past and the long road that 
has been travelled since the 
19th century refused to be- 
lieve that modern man ever 
had any primitive ancestors.

Toon we can almost point 
to the first real “ancestor” of man. 
By this ancestor | mean a creature 
who, among the evolving primates of 
20 million or more years ago, had just 
branched off from the group of our 
nearest relatives, the apes—a creature, 
still very much like an ape himself, 
whose descendants nevertheless 
evolved continuously in a different 
direction from that point on. We are 
quite sure we have the fossil jaws 
of such a creature—his name is 
Ramapithecus (named romantically for 
the Indian god Rama)—who lived 
about 14 million years ago, and the 
story of our knowledge of him is an 
interesting story about science itself, 
We have realized for some time that 
man arose In this way, from animals 
leading to the apes on one side and 
to ourselves on the other. After 
Darwin's great book, “On the Origin 
of Species”, had made Inevitable the 
acceptance of evolution (including 
human evolution), Thomas Huxley 
almost at once showed how closely, 
in every way, we resemble the great 
apes. He said, In fact, that they, 
the apes, are closer to us than they 
are to monkeys. 
This led to a lot of public jokes 
and private dismay, and the idea was 
resisted in many ways, by scientists 
as well as others. But now, after a 
hundred years, all the study of anatomy 
and, quite late, of such things as the 
molecular structure of proteins has

only shown more and more positively 
that Huxley was right. Indeed we can 
go a step beyond Huxley and say 
that apes of Africa, the gorilla and 
chimpanzee, are more closely related 
to man than is any of the three to 
the orang-utang of Indonesia. 
After Huxley's time, some anatomists 
pointed to the fact that apes are 
adapted in body form for brachiating, 
or hanging and swinging from their 
arms. This is a particularly good and 
safe way for a large animal to move 
in trees. Pointing also to our own 
broad shoulders and flat, broad 
chests, as well as to details of our 
elbow and wrist joints, and arrange- 
ments of muscles, they argued that our 
ancestors were likewise adapted to 
a considerable degree for brachiation, 
and for life in trees. This was one 
more argument for close relationship 
to the apes. 
Here again, other anatomists resist- 
ed the Idea, arguing that the 
resemblances were not very signi- 
ficant, and perhaps had evolved In 
paralle! with the apes. They preferred 
to think of an ancestral line which 
had been separate from apes, or even 
monkeys, for a very long time. 
(Always In the background there 
seems to have been an unconscious 
revulsion against relating ourselves 
to chimpanzees, by people who looked 
on them as “animals”, not noticing how 
large-brained and intelligent these 
same animals really are.) 
They had arguments: we do indeed 
stand upright, and our feet are very 
different from an ape's; and our jaws 
are now quite different, particularly 
with small eye teeth which do not 
project above the other teeth in the 
obvious way an ape’s do. Could these 
larger teeth have evolved backwards 
to smaller ones? Could the hand-like 
foot of an ape have been made over 
into a human foot? 
These difficulties are not as great 
as they once seemed. Such changes 
are almost commonplace in animal 
evolution, with teeth being diminished 
or lost, and limbs modified in drastic 
ways. In addition, we must not try 
to picture our common ancestor as 
though he were a chimpanzee or 
gorilla; these animals have been 
evolving too. As study has gone on, 
and fact is piled on fact, most anthro- 
pologists have become convinced that 
our forebears did indeed use trees like 
the African apes, who actually live 
more on the forest floor than In trees. 
Still later, fossil Jaws of the ancestral 
ape Dryopithecus drew attention to 
the very close likeness of the molar 
teeth in ourselves and apes. Though 
the first specimen was found in 
France in 1856, it was during the early 
part of this century that such fragments 
were discovered In greater numbers, 
from fossil-bearing beds of Miocene 
and Pliocene age, and in the time 
range of about 20 million to 8 million 
years ago. 
The fossils have come from other 
parts of Europe and from India, and 
later from East Africa, Georgia 
(U.S.S.R.) and China. With all this, the 
web of evidence has drawn tighter 
around our connexion with the apes. 
For Dryopithecus was evidently the 
ancestor of the large apes, and his 
remains are so widespread that we 
can now hardly expect to find a new 
and different fossil group in the future 
from which we ourselves might have 
come. 
Another important fossil “ape”, 
Oreopithecus of Italy and East Africa, 
who lived at the same time, became 
well known a few years ago. But,

THE ROAD TO HOMO SAPIENS 
Drawings on the next four pages show artist Rudy Zallinger’s impression 
of primate and human evolution. The drawings are reproduced with the 
kind permission of Time-Life Books. New York, and are taken from “Early 
Man”, a richly illustrated volume in the “Life” Nature Library series which 
young and old readers alike will enjoy (see bibliography, inside back cover). 
Above the figures is shown a time scale. The progression is not always strictly 
chronological since in certain cases considerable overlap existed. Proto-apes 
and apes were quadrupedal but are shown standing for comparison.

while his body form was rather like 
a chimpanzee's, showing a similar 
kind of adaptation to trees in a related 
animal, his teeth are quite different 
from a chimpanzee’'s and from ours 
as well, a fact which only links our 
descent still more closely to the apes 
of Africa. 
It was out of the Dryopithecus stock 
that man emerged, and in fact it was 
from among the fossils of Dryopithecus

became known. G.E. Lewis of Yale 
in 1934 described the first upper jaw,

from Dryopithecus, although unfartun-

the jaw. So Lewis thought Rama-

But the tide of scientific opinion— 
and such tides are apt to influence, 
not facts, but the way we see facts— 
was against Ramapithecus, and the 
fossil was put away in a drawer as 
simply one more kind of Dryopithecus.

20 MILLION YEARS (Continued) 
No knuckling under to run faster 
they had passed a major milestone of 
change, from tree-hanging, and from 
using the arms when walking on the 
ground (like apes), to a free upright 
gait on an arched foot with an erect 
torso. Apes can walk this way but 
poorly: their feet are flat, their great 
toes protrude and do not help in 
pushing forward, their knees will not 
straighten (except in orangs), and their 
long, high pelvic bones make them 
top-heavy. 
S. we now know that defi- 
nite hominids go back before 5 million 
B.C., while at the same time our 
strong likeness to the African apes 
means that we have a common ances- 
tor at a time not too remote. Ramapi- 
thecus looks like the beginning of our 
line, and if he seems very ape-like we 
must remember that it Is the human 
side, not the ape, which has been 
changing most rapidly. We can be 
sure our ancestors abandoned trees 
and a diet of fruit and coarse vegeta- 
ble matter, perhaps only in the last 
10 million years or less. 
The reasons why we became bipeds 
are far from clear, though many have 
speculated. Even now we cannot run 
very fast: on uneven ground a gorilla, 
using the knuckles of his hands in 
running, can go as fast. We can, 
however, cover long distances in 
hunting, but could the first bipeds do 
so? Carrying food in the arms to a 
safe eating place might have encour- 
aged uprightness: so might the need 
of a small animal to rise and peer 
over tall grass. 
Perhaps, in our tree life, we became 
adapted to uprightness, as did apes, 
but not to such a degree that, as In 
apes, a heavy torso and long arms 
encouraged throwing part of our 
weight on our arms. Perhaps several 
such factors combined; we cannot say. 
But bipeds we were by about 5 million 
years ago, with important changes 
still going on in hip bones and feet 
to make this kind of gait more 
effective (see photos pages 42-43). 
The australopiths are our undoubt- 
ed ancestors at that time; there 
are no other possible candidates. 
Once again, there Is controversy 
over the actual path of evolution. 
Some think there was only one varied 
species of australopith, not two 
distinct lines. And in former days it 
was assumed that there must have 
been a “cerebral rubicon”, a magic 
brain size of about 750 cubic centi- 
metres below which an ancestor could 
not be “human”. 
But simple stone tools, which are 
over two million years old, have now 
been found near Lake Rudolf in East 
Africa. They could have been made 
only by the australopiths since no 
more “advanced” men are known to 
have existed then; and the brains of 
these austrapoliths were not larger 
than a chimpanzee’s. So shaped stone 
tools did not wait for “man” to make 
them, and it is thought likely that tools 
actually helped the australopiths to 
become “man”, by accenting the 
evolutionary advantages of skilful 
hands and [larger brains (1). 
At any rate, this was the next 
major step, the advent of Homo 
erectus. His appearance, about 1 mil- 
lion B.C., probably follows another 
small gap In the record which might 
make the difference from Australo- 
pithecus more obvious. “Homo”, a 
new genus, recognizes the difference, 
and the new group. Also Homo 
erectus is commonly spoken of as 
the first “true man”, but it is not clear 
that such an expression is justified, 
since many of his traits were already 
present in the australopiths, who were 
also working tools at an earlier time, 
These new men, however, must 
have presented an appearance more 
like our own. In body size, and in 
general features of the skeleton, they 
were much the same as ourselves. 
The head also would have looked more 
“human”, with a smaller face and with 
jaws dominated at last by the brain- 
case. However, this braincase was 
thick, and brain size had come only 
half the way from australopiths to 
modern man. 
The first Homo erectus to be found 
was the famous Java man (originally 
named Pithecanthropus), of 1891. He 
caused a scientific explosion, as the 
first really primitive man to come 
to light, and even his own discoverer 
came to think that he was really a 
large tree-living ape. He reigned 
virtually alone (very recently five new 
examples of his skull have been 
found) until the Peking men of north 
China were discovered, but Homo 
erectus is now recognized from East 
and North Africa, and In Hungary 
(Vertesszollos) and Germany (the 
Heidelberg jaw). 
We know little about the transition 
to Homo erectus, or where it took 
(1) Some of these same australopiths, be- 
fore the tools were found, had already been 
classed by Leakey and others as very early 
“men”, or Homo and, following a suggestion 
of Professor Dart, were named Homo habi- 
lis, with the sense of being "good with the 
hands®. We shall come back to this. 
place. Writers like to argue for either 
Africa or Asia as the “home of man”, 
but this may not be important. Rama- 
pithecus probably reached India from 
Africa 10 million years ago at least, 
and after that there must have been 
hominids in both continents, at the 
stage of Australopithecus. It happens 
that their remains so far have been 
found mostly in Africa, in favourable 
spots like Olduvai Gorge. 
We have a few suggestions of what 
occurred. The large-jawed Paran- 
thropus seems to have changed hardly 
at all during three million years or 
more. The site of Swartkrans, In 
South Africa, yielded many of his 
known fossil parts. It also provided 
two or three jaw fragments, of the 
same age, which Broom and Robinson 
twenty years ago believed to be 
different from Paranthropus, and more 
advanced in form. They christened 
the type “Telanthropus”, though Rob- 
inson later decided that the parts 
belonged to Homo erectus. In either 
case, two different hominids were 
there together, one being Paranthro- 
pus and the other a more advanced 
kind. Here Is a powerful argument 
for the real existence of two different 
forms at the same time. 
A few years ago, by an 
almost magic piece of luck, three men 
were looking over these and other 
fragments in the collections in Pre- 
toria when they noticed broken edges 
which could be fitted together to make 
larger pieces, where this had not been 
seen before, 
They were able to join the “Telan- 
thropus” upper jaw to much of a face, 
an ear region, and a bit of forehead. 
(Palaeontology, | said, is not just a 
matter of looking in river banks.) 
This gave most of the face and front 
of the skull, to which the lower jaw of 
“Telanthropus™ would have been a 
fairly good fit. The whole thing 
suggests Homo even more strongly 
than before, but seems to be too 
small in size. 
At about the same time Mrs. Leakey 
found a small crushed skull in the 
lowest levels of Olduvai Gorge, be- 
low the well-known Zinjanthropus (a 
Paranthropus) and dated to not quite 
two million years. This was only the 
latest in a series of similar finds from 
Olduvai, all of which had been called 
Homo habilis by Leakey and his 
associates. Though fragmentary, they 
were obviously not Paranthropus, 
having higher skulls and smaller Jaws, 
and to many they suggested the

7 ome of the principal Stes at ‘which fossil remains have been found? “Map: 
prepared under the supervision of Professor J. Piveteau, Director of the Lab- 
smaller South African form Australo- 
pithecus. 
After a great deal of work, the new 
skull was put together. This and the 
reconstructed “Telanthropus™ give us 
a better picture: they are somewhat 
more advanced than the known Austra- 
lopithecus but are still very small for 
Homo. They may well be showing 
us the ancestor who had just begun to 
make stone tools and who, in the next 
million years, turned into Homo. 
Again, controversy. Some prefer to 
call this little person Homo habilis, in 
the belief that both Australopithecus 
and Paranthropus became extinct, and 
that this graceful little creature dev- 
eloped directly into high-skulled, 
large-brained Homo sapiens without 
passing through the stage of low- 
browed, thick-skulled Homo erectus. 
But this raises the problem of who 
might have been the ancestor of 
Homo habilis, unless it was Australo- 
pithecus, whom he greatly resembles; 
and also the problem of why remains 
of only Homo erectus have been 
found for the period immediately after. 
It seems safer to assume, for the 
present, that the Australopithecus line 
began making simple tools nearly 
2 1/2 million years ago and, during 
a time from which we have almost 
no fossils, grew larger in size and 
advanced to the erectus stage, while 
Paranthropus continued contentedly 
munching coarse vegetable food with 
his great jaws, ignoring tools, until 
he became extinct. 
If the first Homo erectus to be found, 
the Java Man, was considered in the 
1890s to be very subhuman, we know 
better now. [n Africa, and evidently 
in Europe, he made large stone hand- 
axes, or coups de poing, increasingly 
well-shaped in comparison with the 
earlier pebble tools, 
We do not really know about how 
he used them. All we can say is that 
he occupied the warmer parts of the 
Old World for at least half a million 
years {and even some cool places in 
Europe and China), as the major 
glacial periods were beginning: and 
that in this time he showed some 
evolutionary progress in brains which 
became larger and skulls and jaws 
which became less massive. 
At the moment, he may now seem 
more like a well-defined “stage” than 
he should, because we not only lack 
fossils from the period just before, 
but also have very few from the 
hundreds of thousands of years follow- 
ing the second (Mindel) glaciation. 
Change doubtless went on by small 
steps during these times, but we 
cannot see the steps just now, 
The Swanscombe and Steinheim 
skulls, of the Second Interglacial, 
perhaps 250,000 years ago, and the 
new Tautavel skull from the early Third 
Glacial, are important. They are much 
advanced over the known erectus men, 
but they are still too few to help us 
much, or show what was happening 
worldwide. It is only in the Third In- 
terglacial and the last, or Fourth Gla- 
cial, mainly within the last 100,000 
years, that we come again to a wealth 
of fossil men, and to the Neanderthal 
problem, the greatest controversy of 
all.

20 MILLION YEARS (Continued) 
Neanderthal man, father or distant cousin ? 
was reported in 1856, he too was 
thought to be subhuman by some, but 
only an exceptional modern man, pos- 
sibly a diseased person, by others (the 
first controversy, now forgotten). A 
Neanderthal skull is indeed excep- 
tional, being very long and low, with a 
continuous protruding bony browridge 
across the forehead containing well- 
developed sinuses or air spaces. But 
the skull contours are not those of 
Homo erectus, and the brain was at 
least as large as our own. 
Neanderthal man's face was equally 
remarkable; it was long, protruding 
sharply forward in the midline from the 
top of the nose on down. Had his 
nose not been so broad we might call 
him “hatchet-faced”, but modern “hat- 
chet-faced” north Europeans are apt 
to be tall and slender, while the Nean- 
derthals of Europe were short and 
stocky. 
Corovensy over pri- 
mitiveness and antiquity did not last 
long. Today we know that Neander- 
thal man occupied Europe in the Third 
-Interglacial and much of the Fourth 
Glacial periods (perhaps between 
150,000 and 35,000 B.C.), and that he 
was the author of the Mousterian va- 
rieties of retouched flake stone tool, 
which were technically far advanced 
over something like a handaxe. These 
tools in some ways foreshadowed 
those of the Upper Palaeolithic, which 
were made from bladelike flakes and 
were used by Cro-Magnon man among 
others, 
For a hundred years now, discov- 
eries of skeletons of the European 
Neanderthals have given rise to a 
conception of his “classic” form as | 
have described it. They have also 
reinforced the conclusion that he gave 
way, with seeming abruptness, about 
35,000 B.C. to men who were entirely 
modern in physique, though robust, 
and who were in fact like living Euro- 
peans, 
This is the heart of the modern con- 
troversy, with strong opinions on both 
sides. | have stated the distinctive- 
ness of Neanderthal man too simply 
and sharply, in order to begin with a 
contrast. In North Africa there were 
other Neanderthal-like men, more mod- 
en. in some ways, lacking the typi- 
cal facial projection of the Europeans. 
They too were followed by modern 
men of rugged build, apparently com- 
ing from the east about the same time 
(35,000 B.C.), or perhaps earlier. 
The Near East is more puzzling. 
Men with Neanderthal faces, and 
with Neanderthal peculiarities of the 
skeleton, existed in the early 
Fourth Glacial, with Mousterian tools. 
But their skulls were not as “classic” 
as the Europeans, and some of them 
were remarkably tall, like the Amud 
man of Israel, found by Japanese 
excavators. (Here we must remember 
that modern men vary greatly—Scots 
and Eskimos might be compared to 
these Neanderthals in body size.) 
The argument is over whether the 
Neanderthals, in Europe or elsewhere, 
were in fact replaced by invaders, with 
really new Upper Palaeolithic methods 
of tool-making, in a brief period (a 
few thousand years); or whether the 
Neanderthals simply evolved into mod- 
ern man on the spot, while his stone- 
working, adopting new techniques, 
made the changes from what is termed 
Mousterlan to what is termed Upper 
Palaeailithic. 
It Is a complex argument, and is 
based partly on assumptions (and, | 
believe, partly on tides of scientific 
opinion, like older arguments). In 
spite of all that is known, ways of 
convincing opponents have not been 
found. Some archaeologists empha- 
size transition in tool-making. Other 
archaeologists grant that there are im- 
portant Mousterian survivals in the 
early Perigordian culture of the upper 
Palaeolithic of France. But they see a 
clear break with the coming of a 
second culture, the Aurignacian, which 
has different tool-making techniques 
and also a wealth of decorative 
objects previously lacking. This they 
view as something entirely new, an 
intrusion; and they cannot imagine a 
simple cultural evolution. 
Similarly, some anthropologists can- 
not imagine biological evolution so 
swift as to produce a modern face 
and skull from that of Neanderthal 
Man in a few thousand years. Others 
are doubtful about the shortness of 
the period, and emphasize intergrad- 
ation in shape between Neanderthal 
and modern man, especially in the east. 
They hold that evolution, not replace- 
ment, presents fewer difficulties. They 
note that if there was an invasion, the 
source of the “modern” Upper Palaeo- 
lithic men has not been found and that, 
if the European Neanderthals are rather 
special, the Near Eastern Neanderthals 
are more Intermediate and “progres- 
sive”. 
These scholars would paint a rather 
simple picture of human history, prob- 
ably too simple. They suggest that 
there was everywhere a “Neanderthal 
phase” of human evolution in the last 
glacial period, out of which all of us 
—Eskimos and Scots alike—emerged 
as modern man. This broad view as- 
sumes that there were Neanderthal 
men everywhere in the Old World, as 
there certainly were throughout Eur- 
ope and apparently around its edges. 
Carleton Coon, in a well known 
book, “The Origin of Races”, has 
argued for another theory something 
like this one. Modern races appeared 
in different parts of the Old World. 
not from a single Neanderthal phase 
or Neanderthal population, but from 
different races of Homo erectus 
already present in these places, 
There are difficulties here, but the 
theory does recognize something im- 
portant which the other scholars neg- 
lect: that there were other kinds of 
Ice Age men, such as Solo Man of Java 
and Broken Hill Man ("Rhodesian 
Man”) of southern Africa, who had 
some of the primitive traits of 
Neanderthal man but were really 
quite different. They are less well 
known: they are discoveries, or 
facts, which are still hard to interpret. 
Solo Man, though living at the same 
time as the Neanderthals, had a much 
thicker and cruder skull, more like 
Homo erectus. 
There is a final chapter to all this. 
What do we know about modern man 
himself? Living races seem very dif- 
ferent, some with very dark skin, some 
with blond hair, some with narrowed 
eye openings. But in form of skull 
(and this is what we can compare with 
early man) they are really much alike, 
with smaller faces and higher, narrow- 
er braincases. This is my own conclu- 
sion, after having worked with skulls 
from all parts of the globe. | believe, 
as do many colleagues, that all must 
have some common source. But 
where, and when? 
H.. we are in a shadow- 
land lighted by too few discoveries. 
Outside of Europe, where we observe 
the disappearance of Neanderthal 
Man, remains are especially scanty. 
Nevertheless, striking recent finds 
seem to mean that Homo sapiens of 
our own kind existed elsewhere, in 
Africa and Asia, in the same period 
as the Neanderthals of Europe. 
They are different from those “pro- 
gressive” Neanderthals | spoke of. 
Several skeletons from Jebel Qafzeh, 
in Israel, have no radiocarbon date but 
come from cave levels in which the 
tools and the soils indicate a time 
fairly early in the last glacial period, 
probably well before 40,000 years ago.

And the skulls are surprisingly modern 
—not completely so, but being quite 
different from Neanderthals. Only the 
large bony brows, and perhaps larger 
front teeth, in some of them, suggest 
Neanderthal Man, and others of the 
tribe had quite small teeth, and small- 
er, modern brows and faces as well, 
as far as is now known. 
Two skulls found by Richard Leakey 
- in Kenya, of modern form or close to 
it—mand not Neanderthal—are surely 
older than 37,000 years. Some autho- 
rities think they may be very much 
older. For to the east a skull from the 
Niah Cave in Sarawak (Borneo) has 
been dated by two methods to about 
40,000 BC, and it looks like a Melane- 
sian or possibly an Australian. 
M.. men of the same 
general kind had made the difficult 
water crossings (difficult for early 
men) to Australia before 30,000 B.C, 
and many recent discoveries attest 
the presence of such people there and 
in New Guinea over the next ten 
thousand years. In the New World, 
recent finds prove the Indians were in 
South America about 20,000 years ago, 
much earlier than had been generally 
believed, so that men had come to the 
Americas from Asia probably several 
thousand years before. No American 
skeletons are as old as this, but we 
can only suppose that these earlier 
men were like the later. 
Now here is the important thing. 
All the known skeletons | have men- 
tioned were of modern form. In 
addition, the European Upper Palaeo- 
lithic people had the nature of later 
Europeans; the early Australians were 
recognizably like later Australians or 
Melanesians; and we can only suppose 
that the first Indians of America were 
the same kind of proto-Mongoloid we 
see In them today. 
The Omo skulls of Africa cannot be 
recognized yet, and otherwise there 
are no African skulls quite so old. 
. But the signs are that, by the time the 
Neanderthals vanished, or before, not 
only was modern man fairly wides- 
pread, but the races we see today had 
already taken shape.

The 
life an 
of 
Stone 
by Francois Bordes 
D covers in Africa in- 
dicate that the Oid Stone Age, or 
Palaeolithic period, began more than 
two million years ago. The first stone- 
worker was Australopithecus, half- 
way between the great apes (gorillas, 
chimpanzees, orang-utangs) and our- 
selves, with a still rudimentary brain. 
His tools were simply pebbles, chip- 
ped to give them a cutting edge, and 
roughly trimmed flakes. 
The evolution of man and his indus- 
tries took place over a very long 
period. Pithecanthropus knew how to 
use fire, at least in China, and produc- 
ed the Abbevillian and early Acheulean 
industries, traces of which are found 
in various parts of the world. Little is 
known of the various types of man in 
the Middle and Upper Acheulean 
periods; and finally, about 100,000 
years ago, Homo sapiens emerged. 
A distinction used to be made be- 
tween Neanderthal man, Homo nean- 
dertalensis, associated with the Mous- 
terian culture, and modern man Homo 
sapiens, of the Upper Palaeolithic age. 
  
FRANCOIS BORDES is professor of Pre- 
history and director of the laboratory of 
Quaternary Geology and Prehistory at the 
University of Bordeaux and director of Pre- 
historic Antiquities for the Aquitaine region 
of France. An Internationally famous auth- 
ority on Palaeolithic tools, he can himself 
make ail the known varieties of Palaeolithic 
implements (see photo story page 22 and 
bibliography inside back cover). 
The trend today is to establish two 
sub-species, Homo sapiens neander- 
talensis and Homo sapiens sapiens. 
The exact relationship between 
these two fairly different types Is still 
a matter of controversy. lt is possible 
that there were intervening links, mod- 
ern in some respects and Neander- 
thaler in others and the evolution of 
modern man must have taken place 
more or less simultaneously through- 
out the ancient world. Men of a pre- 
sent-day type existed as far back as 
the Mousterian period (as shown by 
excavations at Djebel Qafzeh in Israel 
and perhaps even before). 
For the last 100,000 years, men have 
lived in very different environments, 
the result of geography or climatic va- 
riations. Such variations were particu- 
larly marked in the Quaternary or last 
of the geological eras: several times 
huge glaciers spread over not only 
Greenland and the Antarctic (where 
one can see their vast traces today) 
but also Scandinavia, North America 
and all high mountains, even at the 
equator. At their maximum, the Scan- 
dinavian glaciers covered the north of 
Germany, most of England, and a great 
part of the western U.S5.S.R., while in 
France the Alpine glaciers came down 
almost to Lyons. 
These- Ice Ages were matched by 
oscillations when the earth's tempera- 
ture fell, though the maximum cold did 
not necessarily coincide with the maxi- 
d times 
Age man 
mum glaciation. Depending on the 
period and the place, the cold would 
be damp or dry, and in the regions to 
the south of the glaciers a variety of 
vegetation developed, ranging from 
tundra to forest. 
In Europe, however, the prevailing 
feature was more or less densely 
wooded steppes. This lowering of 
temperature naturally extended beyond 
today’s temperate zones, but tropical 
and equatorial regions seem to have 
been little affected, though depending 
on the amount of rainfall there were 
periods when deserts spread or shrank 
almost to nothing. 
The accumulation of water locked up 
in the huge glaciers (islandsis) meant 
that the level of the seas went down 
considerably, sometimes more than 
300 feet, with inevitable geographical 
changes. England was a part of the 
continent, and Japan was attached to 
Asia. Our ancestors thus lived In a 
changing world (even if the changes 
were only gradual) frequently very 
different from the world we know. 
Throughout this period tool-making 
depended primarily on stone as the 
basic tool for shaping other tools from 
wood, bone, antler, horn, leather, etc. 
These have all disappeared, with the 
exception of those in bone and antler, 
which have often been preserved. 
Those who know nothing of the 
subject often speak slightingly of

### 52616: The Life and times of Stone Age man

STONE AGE MAN (Continued) 
The myth of the troglodyte ‘cave men’ 
Palaeolithic man and his “clumsy flint 
tools“. In fact, he was a consummate 
craftsman who made the best of his 
material. If many of his impléments 
appear crude, it is because “flint, 
though easily flaked by a skilful 
workman, has a fragile cutting edge 
which wears away quickly, or rather 
which chips; flint is harder than steel, 
as you will see If you scratch the blade 
of a knife with a piece of flint. Other 
tools or weapons, designed for lasting 
use or requiring a perfect form for 
functional ‘reasons, were admirably 
well shaped. 
Not all tools were of flint. In some 
regions flint does not exist and was 
replaced by obsidian (volcanic glass) 
which has a still sharper, though more 
fragile cutting edge, quartzite, sand- 
stone and quartz, which is more in- 
tractable, but for which the right work- 
ing techniques had been evolved. 
In other areas, fine-grained eruptive 
rocks were used, such as basalt and 
rhyolite. Tools were often a varied 
collection, the finer ones in flint or vol- 
canic glass, the rougher ones in basalt, 
quartz or quartzite; the choice of 
material depended on the use to which 
the tool was to be put. 
For flaking stone, man first used ano- 
ther pebble; later, from the Middle 
Acheulean period onwards, he realized 
that better results could be obtained 
with a softer striking tool, or hammer, 
of a cylindrical shape, in wood, bone 
or antler. Perhaps during the Moust- 
erian age, but certainly in the Upper 
Palaeolithic, he began striking by indi- 
rect impact, placing a wooden or bone 
chisel between the hammer and the im- 
plement to be shaped. He also used 
pressure flaking, which permits finer 
and more regular retouches, though 
smaller than those produced by strik- 
ing. In the Solutrean period, about 
19,000 years B.C., man discovered that 
strong heat applied slowly to flint, fol- 
lowed by a slow cooling process, 
changed the structure of the stone and 
made it easier to flake by pressure. 
In the Upper Palaeolithic age men 
hollowed out limestone to make blub- 
ber lamps, sometimes decorated, but 
they did not, to our knowledge, fashion 
vases, which did not appear until con- 
siderably later. A distinction is fre- 
quently drawn between the Palaeo- 
lithic (The Old, or chipped Stone Age) 
and the Neolithic (the New, or polish- 
ed Stone Age). But, apart from the 
fact that Neolithic man chipped stone 
far more than he polished it, artifacts 
in polished stone are by no means un- 
known in Palaeolithic times (for exam- 
ple in Central Europe); and partly pol- 
ished axes have even been found in 
northern Australia, pre-dating those of 
European Neolithic by some 15,000 
years, 
Since the great bulk of artifacts in 
perishable material have not come 
down to us, our ideas about the daily 
life of our far-off ancestors are based 
mainly on the examination of bone and 
stone implements, the study of depo- 
sits, and a comparison with primitive 
peoples of today or recent times. In 
cold regions, our ancestors lived 
mainly by hunting, eked out by fish- 
ing, and, if the climate was suitable, 
the gathering of berries, seeds and 
roots. In warmer climates it is pos- 
sible that fruit-gathering was a major 
food resource as it is today for the 
bushmen of the Kalahari Desert. 
Living patterns were not the same 
for the Middle Palaeolithic (the Mou- 
sterian and similar industries), domi- 
nated by Neanderthal man, and the 
Upper Palaeolithic, by which time 
modern man has emerged. There are 
however a certain number of constant 
factors. 
As regards living quarters, people 
often talk about “cave men” as if pri- 
mitive men led a purely troglodyte 
existence. In fact, they lived chiefly

at the entrance to caves, or under 
overhanging sandstone, limestone or 
basalt rocks hollowed out by erosion. 
But these would have provided very 
poor shelter from the intense cold of 
the Ice Ages if they had not been 
suitably fitted up with skin tents or 
huts. Occasionally one finds traces 
of the uprights which supported the. 
roof, or circles or rectangles of stones 
which Indicate the foundations. 
In or near these huts are to be found 
hearths, sometimes merely places for 
lighting a fire, marked by reddened 
stones and ashes. Elsewhere, there 
are more elaborate hearths—small cir- 
cles of stones, or hearths floored with 
pebbles which were perhaps used for 
cooking; the fire heated the pebbles, 
which were then swept clear of embers 
and ash, and the meat was roasted 
directly on the floor, 
Other hearths are full of stones 
which have been split by the heat. 
One can visualise two ways in which 
they were used. Either the stones, pla- 
ced directly in the fire, accumulated 
heat and then radiated it when the 
fire was extinguished, or alterna- 
tively, when hot they were taken out 
with wooden tongs and thrown into 
a leather bag containing water, to make 
the water boil and produce a meat 
stock. The Eskimos use this tech- 
nique today. 
In warm regions, caves and shel- 
ters were probably fitted out more 
simply, with wind screens instead of 
huts. Open air camps probably re- 
sembled those of the bushmen or 
Australian aborigines, with screens or 
huts made from branches. In rainy 
areas, protection was provided by a 
roof of leaves or thatch. 
Open-air camps are however also 
found in cold regions, either in areas 
where there are no caves, or else 
used as transient camps for the sum- 
mer, Many of these camps are in Cen- 
tral Europe and the U.S.S.R. They 
range from the simple round family 
hut partly hollowed out of the earth, 
the walls reinforced with the bones 
of large animals, to the large commu- 
nity dwellings in the Don area, possi- 
bly corresponding to the “long

STONE AGE MAN (Continued) 
Tools and artifacts for every occasion 
houses” of the Red Indians in the 
eastern United States. 
Such open-air camps also existed in 
France in Mousterian and Upper 
Palaeolithic times. In general, the only 
indications of the Mousterian camps 
are sites thickly scattered with chip- 
ped flints, debris, burnt stones and 
remains of bones. Upper Palaeolithic 
camps are well organized; frequently 
marked by a series of post holes to 
show where huts or tents stood, and 
positioned on small spurs overlooking 
two valleys, where possible on flat 
sandy soil. The reason will be clear 
to anyone who has ever camped. 
W..: the large dwellings 
in eastern Europe were probably 
permanent living quarters, the equi- 
valent of the non-existent cave, the 
simpler ones in the west were most 
likely hunting or summer camps. From 
the fact that the too! kits found there 
are not basically different from cave 
tools of the same period, it can be 
deduced that the hunting expeditions 
included women, who were respon- 
sible for dressing skins and smoking 
meat. 
It is possible that Palaeolithic ‘man 
led a semi-sedentary life in the sense 
that the caves were inhabited all the 
year round by part of the group, and 
a_semi-nomadic life in the sense that 
hunting expeditions were divided up 
into temporary camps. The same is 
true for bushmen today: sometimes 
the tribe lives all together, at others 
it breaks up into little groups. 
As regards clothing, comic strips or 
illustrated novels often show prehis- 
toric man with only the skin of an 
animal round his loins. This may 
have been the case during warm 
periods or on fine summer days, and 
of course in tropical areas where clo- 
thing was perhaps even more redu- 
ced. But for life in an ice age, parti 
cularly in winter, a costume similar to 
that of the Eskimos is much more 
likely, considering that the temperature 
must often have been below minus 40 
degrees. 
The bone needle was only invented 
in the Upper Solutrean age—around 
17,000 or 16,000 B.C.—but while it is 
a help to sewing it is not indispens- 
able. Earlier tool kits include bone 
points and flint drills with which it is 
easy to make holes in a hide. Thread 
was provided by vegetable fibres or 
the tendons of animals, in the same 
way as tendons of reindeer are used 
today by Arctic peoples. 
There is also no doubt that Stone 
Age man had shoes, probably like 
moccasins, even though the footprints 
found in caves are all of naked feet. 
Tool kits varied from one period to 
another and from one industry to ano- 
ther, probably corresponding to diff- 
erent populations. They also devel- 
oped over the ages inside the same 
industry, 
In the Mousterian age, stone tool 
kits are the overwhelming majority of 
the artifacts preserved, and are mainly 
of flint flakes. They include a variety 
of scraping tools—flakes with one or 
more edges trimmed to make them 
even. They may have been used for 
scraping hides, and certainly as knives 
and for woodworking. In addition, 
there are notched pieces, flakes with 
toothed edges like saws, scrapers, 
burins or gravers, borers, backed 
knives made from elongated flakes or 
blades with one edge broken off to 
make it possible to lay a finger along 
it (as with the blade of a modern 
knife). 
Among some varieties of Mouste- 
rian tools, there are still hand axes or 
"coups-de-poing”, multiple purpose 
tools, as in the preceding Acheulean 
age. Bone tools are no more than 
splinters with the end worn down 
(perhaps for making clothing) or bones 
which show signs of having been 
crushed, which may have been pres- 
sure tools for trimming flint. 
1. the Upper Palaeolithic 
age tool kits were more varied and 
specialized. A small number of side 
scrapers subsisted, to be replaced by 
various kinds of end scrapers. The 
number and variety of gravers increas- 
ed considerably, probably partly due 
to bone working, which became very 
important. Borers, backed blades and 
bladelets also play a role, but their 
purpose is not always clear. Bone 
tools Included points, smoothing tools 
for sleeking hides, and towards the 
end, needles. 
Weapons were used primarily for 
hunting, since war, in the modern 
sense of the term, was little known in 
Palaeolithic times, though there may 
have been brief skirmishes over terr- 
itorial hunting rights, Weapons also 
varied from one period and one place 
to another. The Mousterians had flint 
points, spear or Javelin heads, wood- 
en spears, a few bone points and 
probably clubs. Upper Palaeolithic 
weapons were more developed— 
various kinds of flint projectile points, 
such as the magnificent Solutrean 
"laurel leaf” and shouldered points; 
also a great quantity and variety of 
bone points, and harpoons during the 
last, or Magdalenian period. 
While Mousterian projectiles were 
thrown by hand, the Upper Palaeo- 
lithic age saw the development of the 
spear thrower, which is still used by 
Eskimos and Australian aborigines to 
give greater range and penetration to 
spears. It is just possible that by the 
Upper Magdalenian age bows were 
used, but so far there is no positive 
proof of this. 
Hunting is as old as man, and it is 
highly probable that it was a factor 
in his evolution, setting a premium 
not only on strength and speed but 
also on intelligence. By the time of 
Homo sapiens, whether Neanderthal 
man or modern man, it had existed for 
more than two million years; and 
Acheulean man, more than 100,000 
years ago and perhaps even 500,000 
years ago, was already a big game- 
hunter or “giant-killer”. 
There were various means of hunt- 
ing, with spears thrown by hand and 
later with spear throwers or bows, dif- 
ferent types of snares, the use of fire 
to make animals stampede and leap off 
a cliff, tracking with several hunters 
taking over from each other until the 
prey was exhausted. This is probably 
how reindeer, bison and horses were 
hunted. 
Snares probably varied with the size 
of the game: large herbivorous ani- 
mals were probably caught in pits dug 
in the ground and covered with bran- 
ches and leaves. Suspended traps 
were laid for carnivores, devised so 
that when the animal tried to take the 
bait he would bring down a roof 
weighted with heavy stones, or be 
pinned to the ground by a spear; 
snares with springs were probably used 
for smaller animals such as hares. 
Fishing varied in importance accor- 
ding to the period: fish-bones are 
only rarely to be found in Mouster- 
ian deposits, though this may be due 
to the fact that little effort has been 
made to look for them. The Mouster- 
lans probably fished chiefly with 
spears or by hand, as we know of no 
special fishing equipment. 
In Upper Palaeolithic sites, however, 
vertebrae and other fish bones are 
found fairly frequently. There are

small bone artifacts, pointed at both 
ends, which may have been straight 
hooks of the kind primitive tribes use 
today, harpoons (for both fishing and 
hunting), forked objects which may 
have been pronged harpoons, all 
chiefly in the Magdalenian age, during 
which fishing probably played an im- 
portant part. 
It is also probable that nets were 
already in existence. Some pebble- 
flagged floors are supposed to have 
been surfaces for drying fish. The 
catch seems to have been chiefly sal- 
mon and trout, but remains of eels, 
perch and pike are also found. 
Little is known of plant resources, 
but fossil pollen analysis shows that 
the hazel tree must have flourished In 
Europe at some periods. Some acorns 
are edible. Wild strawberries, rasp- 
berries, sloes, blueberries and black- 
berries also existed and it is very 
probable that water-caltrops were 
gathered. The bulbs or tubers of 
several plants of the period, partic- 
ularly the lily family, were edible, as 
also were wild carrots and sorrel 
Gathering was part of the work done 
by women and children. In Africa 
and south-east Asia plant resources 
must have been even more varied. 
] HE use of fire has been 
known to man since Homo erectus, at 
least in Asia and Europe, for in Africa 
the indications are so far of a later 
date. This does not mean however 
that Homo erectus knew how to light 
it. He may simply have kept it alight 
after taking it from a fire due to natural 
causes such as bush fires produced 
by lightning, marsh fires, etc. But in 
the Mousterian culture and still more 
in the Upper Palaeolithic age, there is 
no doubt that man knew how to light 
fire. 
There are two main methods, by 
rubbing and by striking. A pointed 
wooden stick may be rubbed to and 
fro in a groove hollowed out in soft 
wood, or rapidly rotated by hand or 
with a bow. Striking is not, as is 
often thought, the striking of one flint 
against another, as the resulting 
sparks are simply cold light; a flint is 
struck against a lump of iron pyrites. 
In some deposits fragments of iron py- 
rites have been found which show tra- 
ces of having been struck; sometimes 
they are so worn that they must have 
been used regularly as lighters. 
It is difficult to estimate the density 
of the population, which must have 
been thinly scattered, with occasional 
large concentrations of several hun- 
dred people living in neighbouring 
sites. 
The expectation of life was not long, 
though recent research tends to leng- 
then the estimates. It was probably 
rare to live beyond fifty. There must 
have been a high rate of infant mor- 
tality and deaths in childbirth. 
The first undeniable burials appear 
with the Mousterian culture. In Cor- 
réze, at La Chapelle-aux-Saints, a man 
was found lying in a trench with his 
knees drawn up and his head pro- 
tected by large animal bones. A bison 
leg had been placed by his head, and 
beside him in a small pit were a bison 
horn and frontal bone, as provision for 
a journey or a funeral offering. In 
a Mousterian deposit at Shanidar in 
Iraq, pollen analysis indicates that a 
man was buried on a bed of flowers. 
In the Upper Palaeolithic age funeral 
rites were more complex. The dead 
were often buried with fine objects in 
flint and bone and elaborate necklaces 
of pierced shells, and were powdered 
with red ochre. Sometimes large 
stones were placed on their hands and 
feet, perhaps to prevent them coming 
back to haunt the living. 
There are many children’s burial 
places, and the Soviet prehistorian 
Okladnikov attributes this to the fact 
that Palaeolithic man was more inter- 
ested in the fate of dead children than 
that of dead adults. It is also worth 
noting the large number of women's 
burial places, often as richly ornamen- 
ted as those of men, which seems to 
indicate that discrimination between 
the sexes was unknown among Palaeo- 
lithic hunters. 
Art probably appeared earlier than 
one imagines. Many Mousterian sites 
yield mineral paint such as black man- 
ganese dioxide and yellow and red 
ochre. But we know of no engravings, 
sculptures or paintings depicting ani- 
mals before the Upper Palaeolithic age. 
The Mousterians probably used min- 
eral pigments for painting on perish- 
able materials, and perhaps their own 
skins, like Australian aborigines. 
In the Upper Palaeolithic age, how- 
ever, art developed considerably, parti- 
cularly in the Magdalenian culture, pro- 
ducing splendid achievements in en- 
graving, sculpture and painting compa- 
rable to those of classical antiquity. 
It is mainly animals that are portrayed, 
but in some caves such as those at La 
Marche (Vienne, France) we have a 
large number of human figures, fre- 
quently caricatures, as if the exact 
portrayal of the human figure had been 
taboo. 
As regards magic and religion, var- 
ious Interpretations have been given 
to prehistoric art. When it was first 
discovered, .it was argued that such 
art was an expression of a highly dev- 
eloped aesthetic sense; subsequently 
the theory was long entertained that 
prehistoric art was used to cast spells, 
either for successful hunting or to 
replenish the stock of game. 
Recently, Professor Leroi-Gourhan's 
school has interpreted it as the ex- 
pression of the dualism between male 
and female, some animals represen- 
ting the male principle, others the fe- 
male. There is certainly no straight- 
forward answer; an explanation which 
may be valid for the Aurignacian 
period (30,000 BC) Is not necessarily 
so for the Magdalenian (15,000 to 
9,000 BC). 
F. a long time it was 
believed that paintings were to be 
found only on the walls of deep caves 
which may have been sanctuaries, but 
it now appears that most rock dwel- 
lings were decorated. The great bulk 
of decorated caves are in western 
Europe, but one has been found in 
the Urals, 
Much has been conjectured about 
the religion of the Stone Age, but 
nothing is known for certain. Funeral 
rites seem to indicate a belief in ano- 
ther world. The theory of bear-wor- 
ship by the Mousterians has been 
strongly contested, but recent investi- 
gations give it a new lease of life, 
As regards social organization, we 
know very little, since in most cases 
we cannot tell the size of human 
groups during this period. We still 
do not know whether a given number 
of tools found in a particular layer 
represents 10 men over 100 years, or 
100 men over 10 years, though recent 
studies are beginning to throw a little 
light. Similarities between tool kits 
and works of art suggest contacts 
between various human groups over 
fairly large distances. 
In conclusion, much remains to be 
learned about daily life in the Stone 
Age, but what we do know suggests 
that while it was certainly a hard life, 
it was not on the whole a wretched 
one. Where game was plentiful, man 
must have had spare time for sculpture 
or story-telling. Unfortunately, while 
certain works of art have come down 
to us through the ages, the entire oral 
tradition of stories, legends and songs 
has disappeared for ever. un

### 52622: Our African ancestors

Our 
African 
ancestors 
24 
by Louis S. B. Leakey 
  
T. have been so many 
discoveries concerning the evidence 
of man’s origin during the past few 
years that nearly every textbook 
available today on this subject is out 
of date. The facts that will be given 
briefly in this paper have all been 
published in such scientific journals 
as Nature, or have been presented 
before international meetings and 
discussed by our colleagues. Only a 
limited part of the evidence is yet 
available in book form. 
  
LOUIS S.B. LEAKEY, of Great Britain, is world 
famous for his discoveries of fossil remains 
in East Africa. He began his first archaeolo- 
gical research there In 1926, when he was 
23, and has devoted his hfe to this work 
ever since. His most exciting finds have 
been made in Olduval Gorge, Tanzania. He 
Is now honorary director of the National 
Museum Centre for Prehistory and Palaeon- 
tology In Nairobi (Kenya) and honorary pro- 
fessor of anatomy at the University College 
of Nairobl. He has published many books 
and studies on his excavation and research 
into man's past in Africa (see bibliography 
inside back cover). Dr Leakey took part In 
Unesco's 1962 International symposium on the 
origins of Homo saplens, In Paris.

East Africa today figures very 
prominently indeed in the story of the 
- evolution of the direct ancestors of 
man himself, as well as of his nearest 
cousins—the great apes—and although 
this article will mainly be concerned 
with the end part of the story, from 
about 3 million years ago onwards, 
it must begin by discussing briefly 
the discoveries of the Miocene 
period, which began about 20 to 25 
million years ago. 
In spite of the fact that Darwin, 
more than 100 years ago, ventured to 
predict that one day it would be found 
that man had originated in Africa, few 
people believed him and it was only 
in 1924 that the first indications were 
obtained that, in fact, Africa had very 
early fossil primates. 
The story begins with a discovery 
made by Doctor, HL. Gordon, who 
was living at Koru, in Kenya, and 
engaged partly in farming and in a 
limited medical practice. Because of 
his early training and interest in 
zoology he began to notice that 
following the ploughing of the land 
of his farm and on subsequent 
washing of the ploughed soil by rain, 
fragments of fossil bones and teeth 
were visible and he began to collect 
these and submitted them to Mr. E. J. 
Wayland, the Director of the Geo- 
logical Survey in Uganda, and to me 
in 1926 in Nairobi. We both realized 
that Dr. Gordon had made a very 
important discovery and thus, through 
the accldent of having a doctor as 
well as a farmer at a critical place, 
began the long series of discoveries. 
Since those early days, East Africa 
has yielded a vast collection of fossils 
of Lower and Upper Miocene age, 
among which are more than 500 fossils 
representing the higher apes and also 
examples of Proto-man. A similarly 
important early discovery was made 
in the same year, 1924, at Taung in 
South Africa when a student brought 
a fossil specimen to his professor of 
anatomy at the Medical School in 
Johannesburg. This proved to be the 
first discovery of a “near-man” or 
australopithecine. Thus, 1924 was an 
important year for the African con- 
tinent. As will be seen in this article, 
discoveries followed thick and fast. 
During the early Miocene period 
East Africa was inhabited by a number 
of higher primate forms, among which 
were true ape-like creatures such as 
Pro¢onsul africanus—at one time 
regarded as in the direct line of 
ancestry of man—and also ancestral 
forms of the gorilla, chimpanzee and 
gibbon as well, possibly, as an 
ancestral orang-utang. 
Living side by side with these 
extinct apes in East Africa, at that 
remote period, was Kenyapithecus 
africanus who Is regarded by me, and 
by many of my colleagues, as in the 
direct line of ancestry of man and 
the “near-men®. This view is not 
universally accepted, but the evidence 
is very strong. In any event, Kenya- 
pithecus africanus Is much more 
similar to a possible ancestor of man 
than the other primates which were 
contemporary and listed above. 
By the Upper Miocene period around 
12 million years ago, the evidence 
from East Africa is much more definite. 
At Fort Ternan, an Upper Miocene site 
in Kenya, we have found fossils of 
a proto-man named Kenyapithecus

wickeri, whose remains are so similar, 
morphologically, to Ramapithecus of 
India, but a little older in time, that 
some authorities consider the two 
species to be identical. 
That question can only be settled 
when more specimens are found. In 
the meantime, what is certain is that 
in the Kenyapithecus wickeri speci- 
mens we have a primate with a 
large number of hominid characters 
and one which is universally accepted 
as a hominid or man-like creature, 
not a pongid or member of the ape 
stock, 
Not only does Kenyapithecus wickeri 
have physical characters such as small 
canine teeth, shovel-shaped incisors, 
rounded mandibular arcade and a 
short face, which are all hominid 
characters, but he was also using 
stones to break open antelope skulls 
and limb bones, in order to obtain 
the brains and marrow. The evidence 
for this statement lies in bones and 
skulls with depressed fractures and 
one stone exhibiting evidence of 
having been used to batter bones. 
In other words, an Upper Miocene 
ancestor in Kenya, around 12 million 
years ago, was already extending his 
food beyond mere plant products to 
include animal proteins. 
It was probably this widening of his 
food resources that enabled the 
descendants of Kenyapithecus wickeri 
to survive, when Proconsul and many 
of the other primates, at this time, 
became extinct. Although it is not 
possible to say that Kenyapithecus 
wickeri must be the ancestor of Homo 
sapiens it would certainly seem likely 
that he represents the stock from 
which all man, and man-like species 
eventually emerged. 
1. 1931, during my Third 
East African Archaeological Expedi- 
tion, we recovered a fragmentary 
mandible in a highly fossilized condi- 
tion at Kanam West on the shores of 
the Kavirondo Gulf of Lake Victoria, 
Kenya. The specimen was highly 
mineralized and derived from deposits 
of Lower Pleistocene age, as determin- 
ed by the fauna. It had been badly 
damaged before being embedded in 
the deposits in which it was found, 
and the lower margin was missing. | 
described it as Homo kanamensis and 
further indicated that it had many simi- 
larities to Homo sapiens. With very 
few exceptions, my colleagues refused 
to accept the evidence that this 
specimen was of Lower Pleistocene 
age, but | never retracted from my 
stand, because | knew the evidence 
was sound. 
It was also during the Third East 
African Archaeological Expedition in 
1931 that | and my colleagues 
discovered that the famous Olduvai 
Gorge was very rich In early Stone 21 
Age cultural remains. 
The original discovery of Olduvai 
Gorge itself was entirely accidental

‘] almost trod on a half exposed fossil skull’ 
and dates back to 1911, when a German 
butterfly collector, Dr. Kattwinkel, was 
chasing a butterfly across the eastern 
corner of the Serengeti Plains. He 
was so intent on making his catch 
that he nearly fell to his death over 
the edge of the Gorge. Having lost 
his butterfly and escaped with his life, 
he climbed down the sides of "the 
cliff and found some magnificent fossil 
bones of a three-toed horse, which he 
took back to his colleagues in Berlin. 
In 1913 a German expedition was 
sent out to examine the place where 
these few fossil bones had been found 
and discovered a wealth of extinct 
animal remains. Thus, again, an 
accident led to the discovery of what 
is now, probably, the most important 
site of fossil human remains anywhere 
in the world. 
Even though | and my colleagues 
studied Olduvai Gorge from 1931 
onwards and obtained wonderful 
collections of artifacts and fossil 
animals, we did not find the first 
significant fossil human skull until 
1959. This was the discovery of Aus- 
tralopithecus (Zinjanthropus) boisei. 
D. the past two years 
my son, Richard Leakey, has been 
conducting intensive palaeontological 
and archaeological research at the 
north east end of Lake Rudolf and he 
has found clear evidence of the genus 
Homo represented by a number of 
specimens. These are completely 
contemporary with the fossil fauna, 
similar, in most respects, to that from 
Kanam West and undoubtedly of 
Lower Pleistocene age. Although 
Richard Leakey's new Homo finds 
have not yet been given scientific 
names, their similarity to the original 
Kanam mandible is most striking, but 
Richard's specimens are much more 
complete, 
An interesting fact, in connexion 
with the discoveries at East Rudolf, is 
that in the same series of deposits 
there also occur magnificently pre- 
served remains of a robust austra-

lopithecine, who was contemporary 
with Homo, and which are more than 
half a million years older than Aus- 
tralopithecus (Zinjanthropus) boisei, 
from Olduvai. There is, therefore, 
clear evidence from Kenya of a 
Lower Pleistocene form of the genus 
Homo, which is completely contem- 
porary with the australopithecines in 
Lower Pleistocene times. 
These facts inevitably lead us to 
a brief discussion on the australo- 
pithecines as a whole. Most of the 
existing textbooks still place the 
genus  Australopithecus (including 
Zinjanthropus and Paranthropus and 
other comparable forms) in the direct 
line of ancestry of the genus Homo, 
and therefore of Homo sapiens. This 
view can no longer be scientifically 
maintained. 
Undoubtedly, of course, the australo- 
pithecines and Homo must have a 
common ancestor, somewhere in the 
scale between the Upper Miocene 
and the Lower Pleistocene, but such 
a common ancestor has not yet been 
found. The fact, however, that a very 
robust australopithecine with a number 
of over-specialized characters existed 
in the Lower Pleistocene some 23% to 
3 million years ago, and was con- 
temporary with Homo, completely 
destroys the view that. Australo- 
pithecus, as such, is our direct 
ancestor. ‘When a common stock 
from which these two types of hominid 
are derived is eventually discovered, 
it will probably have some characters 
of both, but clearly be distinguishable 
from either. 
It is interesting to note, here, that 
in the deposits at East Rudolf of 
Lower Pleistocene age which have 
now yielded numerous specimens of 
Homo, there are stone artifacts which 
are very closely similar to the three 
found in situ at Kanam West with 
the Kanam mandible. These were 
published in my book “The Stone 
Age Races of Kenya”. The preliminary 
notes which have been published 
concerning the East Rudolf artifacts 
show clearly that the genus Homo was 
making several different types of

duval Gorge. 
  
stone tools, during the Lower Pleis- 
tocene in that area. 
At Olduval Gorge a little less than 
two million years ago, we have found 
further very significant evidence 
relative to the origin of the genus 
Homo and, therefore, of Homo sapiens. 
In Bed | at Olduvai in 1959 we 
discovered a very well preserved 
skull of an australopithecine which 
we described as Zinjanthropus boisel. 
At the time of the discovery no 
other hominid remains were known 
from Olduvai Bed |, while we had 
much evidence of the Stone Age 
culture known as Oldowan in these 
deposits. 
Although, therefore, it was accepted 
that Zinjanthropus was an australo- 
pithecine, in its physical morphology, 
it seemed posible that it might qualify 
as a “man”, in view of the current 
definition of “man” at that time— 
“Man the Tool-Maker®. A few months 
later the first fragmentary fossils of 
what is now called Homo habilis were 
found In deposits of the same age as 
Zinjanthropus and also in associa- 
tion with the Oldowan culture. Since 
then, many further specimens of this 
second type of hominid have been 
found at Olduvai and published in 
Nature and elsewhere, as it is clear 
that they represent the genus Homo, 
living during the Lower Pleistocene. 
A full description is in preparation 
at the present time, in monograph, 
and there is no doubt whatsoever 
that the morphology of Homo habilis 
is much more similar (at least in 
respect of the cranial vault) to Homo 
sapiens than are the fossil remains 
of Homo erectus, the extinct hominid 
species first found in Java and China 
and later in Africa in Middle Pleis- 
tocene deposits. 
Ice seems very little 
doubt that Homo habilis lies in the 
direct line leading to Homo sapiens. 
In all probability the branch which 
ended up as Homo erectus diverged 
from Homo habilis at least as far back 
as the Lower Pleistocene, in view of 
the fact of his presence, in the Far 
East, as a fully distinct and over-spe- 
cialized species in the Middle Pleis- 
tocene. 
Another accidental discovery of 
the greatest importance took place 
in 1961—the find of remains of 
the same type of man as in China 
and Java, but twice as old in East 
Africa as in the Far East. This time 
the accident was due to an error on 
the part of one of my staff. The 
geologist working with me returned to 
camp one day with a draft plane table 
map of a certain part of the Gorge. 
| looked at it and said, “But you have 
left out one long narrow side gully.” 
He replied, “I have not", and | said,

## [Page 29](https://demo.humlab.umu.se/courier/078279engo.pdf#page=29) 0

### 52622: Our African ancestors

“I am very sorry, but you have; 
come over with me tomorrow morning 
and | will show you.” 
‘When we got to the long and rather 
grass and bush filled gully, and he had 
had to admit that he was in error, | 
looked back towards our camp site 
and suddenly on the far side of the 
Gorge | saw a very small area of 
exposed fossil beds. These were on 
the north side of the tongue of land 
which separates the main and side 
gorges. 
Although | had explored Olduvai 
on foot since 1931 | knew, at once, 
that | had never set foot in that tiny 
exposure. But for the error on the 
part of my student which had taken 
me back to the point from which | saw 
it, | might still never have seen it. 
It was only visible from that one 
point of view. As soon as we got back 
to camp, | went off again to locate 
this hidden patch of exposures, and 
as | walked on to it | almost trod on 
a half exposed fossil human skull. 
That was the first Homo erectus skull 
from Olduvai. 
This brings us, inevitably, to a 
discussion of the further textbook 
view that Homo erectus is a direct 
ancestor of Homo sapiens. This view, 
too, can no longer be taken seriously 
for the following reasons: 
The shape of the cranial vault of 
all specimens of Homo erectus is 
quite dissimilar to the cranial vault 
of Homo sapiens while, as already 
stated above, the shape of the vault 
of Homo habilis, which is much older 
in time, is very similar. 
With his smooth, sloping brow and canine teeth smaller than those of most apes, 
though larger than man’s, “Proconsu! Africanus” was once thought of as a possible 
common ancestor of apes and hominids. 
Homo erectus exhibits a large 
number of highly specialized charac- 
ters which are present in the African 
and Far Eastern variants while Homo 
habilis has many more Homo sapiens 
generalized features. 
The pelvic bone of Homo erectus 
found in Olduvai Gorge and published 
recently, and the femur shaft associat- 
ed with it, are clearly of a quite 
different type from the corresponding 
bones of Homo sapiens and it begins 
to look doubtful whether the Trinil 
femur truly belongs to Homo erectus. 
‘When we go on, therefore, to 
discuss the emergence of Homo 
sapiens, in the light of the evidence 
available in 1972, it becomes entirely 
clear that we have to revise our total 
picture of how our species came into 
being. 
- can be no doubt 
now, at all, that Homo sapiens was 
present in the Middle Pleistocene 
times in both Europe and Africa; a 
fact which was accepted at the Unes- 
co sponsored Conference on the origin 
of Homo sapiens, in Paris, in 1969, 
when specimens such as the skulls 
from Kanjera, Swanscombe and the 
new Kibish specimens from southern 
Ethiopia were unanimously accepted 
as representing Homo sapiens in a 
primitive form, but quite distinctly 
sapiens, In fact this species was 
present during the Middle Pleistocene 
times in areas as far apart as Swans- 
combe in England and Kanjera in 
Kenya. It is obvious, therefore, that 
an earlier form of Homo sapiens must 
occur somewhere in older deposits. 
When the fragmentary Kanjera 
skulls were found deriving from Middle 
Pleistocene deposits and in associa- 
tion with hand axes in 1932, they 
were rejected, much as the earlier 
Kanam mandible was rejected, and 
were placed in what was called a 
“Suspense Account”. ‘When the 
Swanscombe skull, in its turn, was 
described in 1936 as Homo sapiens, 
it was rejected because it seemed too 
old for that species. It was only 
when the southern Ethiopian skulls 
from Kibish were discovered in 1967 
that a new concept of the antiquity 
of Homo sapiens began to crystallize, 
and become accepted. 
To conclude this discussion we 
may, perhaps, be permitted to try and 
distinguish between Homo sapiens 
sapiens (what is known today as 
psycho-social man) and Homo sapiens 
faber—early tool making members of 
our species who had not yet achieved 
full psycho-social status. 
| believe that the beginning of 
psycho-social man probably coincides 
with the dawn of art, religion, magic 
beliefs and speech in terms of abstract 
ideas as distinct from mere words 
describing material objects. By this 
time too man had begun, perhaps, 
to be a community dweller as shown 
by the vast accumulations of his 
artifacts in the caves of the Dordogne 
and elsewhere during the: Upper 
Pleistocene times. n

Cave wall art 
comes to man 
by 
André Leroi-Gourhan 
  
ANDRE LEROI-GOURHAN is one of the out- 
standing world authorities on prehistoric art. 
He is professor of prehistory at the Collége 
de France and director of the Institute of 
Ethnology in Paris. He has directed many 
archaeological excavations in Europe and the 
Far East. He took part in Unesco's 1969 
international symposium on the origin of 
Homo sapiens, in Paris (see bibliography 
inside back cover). . 
T. contemporary arts of 
Africa and Oceania are often mis- 
takenly labelled “primitive” —a serious 
error since these arts have had just 
as long an evolution as western art. 
Traces of this evolution have all too 
often vanished, yet those that survive 
prove that styles varied over the 
centuries and that, although their 
“language of forms” differs from that 
handed down to us from Ancient 
Greece, the so-called “primitive” arts 
are in no sense rudimentary. 
The same cannot be said for the 
oldest prehistoric art whose first 
expressions can _be perceived at the 
dawn of modern man. This is the true 
primitive art. 
As other articles in this issue make 
clear, the concept of humanity changes 
according to whether we consider man 
within the span of history or within the 
context of the modern age. 
In the modern context we: find a 
single global concept of man; Homo 
sapiens, symbolizing the human race. 
But within the span of history, things 
are quite different. For one or two 
million years, perhaps even longer, 
thousands of generations of bipeds 
succeeded one another, and Homo 
sapiens emerged perhaps less than 
fifty thousand years ago. 
Along this interminable road of 
early human development we en- 
counter relatively few works of art

The cave of Lascaux in S.W. France 
boasts some of the finest prehistoric 
art of the Magdalenian period (15,000- 
9,000 B.C). Cave artists, who depict- 
ed hundreds of vigorous and lifelike 
animal figures on its walls and ceiling, 
knew the animals around them intima- 
tely, and displayed an extraordinary 
understanding of and skill in painting 
by contrasting black, brown, red and 
yellow paints to enhance the realism 
of their work (see back cover). Horses 
in this Lascaux fresco (centre, beneath 
a leaping cow, and at far left) have 
been called “Chinese” because of 
their similarity to horses seen in Chi- 
nese art 15,000 years later. 
At best, one can imagine the pre- 
decessors of modern men, while their 
intellect gradually evolved, indulging 
an occasional! aesthetic impulse by 
using their voices, beating out rhythms 
and making body movements, the pre- 
cursors of song, music and dance. 
As one approaches the types of 
men nearer our own—Neanderthal 
man for Instance—one can add to 
these embryonic forms of artistic 
creation the first signs of engraving, 
painting and sculpture. 
No structured and decipherable work 
of art from these very distant times 
has yet been discovered, but we do 
know that between 40,000 and 100,000 
years ago Neanderthal men handled 
natural red ochre and may even have 
scratched lines on bone fragments 
with the point of a flint. 
Unfortunately, there is little to help 
the prehistorian to understand how 
the arts were born: only a few traces 
of pigment to attest that men were 
already interested in colour. Some- 
times, too, the odd-shaped stones and 
fossilized shells found among the used 
flint tools and remains of game in 
early settlements show us that our 
nearest forefathers were intrigued by 
the spontaneous forms of nature. 
This attraction for “natural curiosities” 
is deeply anchored in the aesthetic 
behaviour of man and has survived 
all through history, right up to our own 
times. 
That Neanderthal men, or the type 
of humanity just preceding our own, 
had aesthetic needs, as well as the 
means of satisfying them, is shown 
by the already advanced state of their 
technical skills. The shaping of stone 
tools creates forms which quickly 
acquire regular outlines (ovals, blades 
with nearly parallel sides, triangles, 
and so on). The first production of 
such artificial forms was dictated by 
the technique used to prepare the 
Photo @ Jean Vertut, Paris 
flint blocks from which the efficient 
tool was to emerge. 
Although it has been shown that 
chance fragments of split flint can be 
used as tools, we perceive, during the 
first million years of human prehistory, 
a search in progress for processes 
which would enable artifacts to be 
standardized. We find, too, a gradual 
evolution of styles which enable us to 
identify objects from different periods. 
The search for efficient tools and 
the need for an economical use of 
whatever raw materials came to hand 
are the obvious explanation for this 
evolution in tool-making. Yet the 
truly significant fact is that this 
increasing technical progress is in- 
separable from the growing elaboration 
of aesthetic forms, 
However, until about 40,000 B.C. 
one cannot really speak of true works 
of art—works in which the hands of 
men created not merely an object but 
also a symbol. 
It is difficult to draw clear lines of 
demarcation between the successive 
stages of man’s evolution since, in a 
theoretical sense, they are not those 
of pre-men, proto-men and finally true 
men. From the very beginning we 
are dealing with men who gradually

became more and more human, right 
down to modern times. The same is 
true for art which did not suddenly 
appear fully formed, but evolved 
gradually through the ages. Neander- 
thal man's interest in the curiosities of 
nature or in pigments, therefore mark- 
ed a decisive phase in a continuous 
process which reached its full develop- 
ment later, 
This development, reflected in the 
nature of modern men, is in all 
probability linked with the emergence 
of language, or at any rate, the 
capacity to formulate abstractions. 
The hand, like the vocal organs, faith- 
fully expresses thought. And although 
it is true that until the appearance of 
writing we have no direct witness to 
verbal expression (which stems from 
the same cerebral centres as manual 
expression), nothing prevents us from

But if from the beginning the hand 
gave form to thought through the

conscious search for forms, no trace 
of any consciously created shapes 
with a symbolic rather than practical 
function has been found among the 
remains of the men who lived between 
500,000 and 1 million years ago. 
What the hand did not translate is 
not likely to have existed in the 
language; and it seems that any 
change had to wait until the long 
process of cerebral and cultural 
development reached a certain thresh- 
old. Homo sapiens—the present 
human species—crossed that thresh- 
old some forty thousand years ago.

Strikingly enough, ornaments (pierc- 
ed teeth and pendants) appeared at 
the same time as the first attempts at 
figurative art. It is as though the 
emerging modes of expression trans- 
lated at the same time the symbols 
of social behaviour (ornaments) and 
the symbols of abstract expression— 
which confirms the link between 
artistic and verbal expression. The 
aesthetic impulse is always the carrier 
of social yearnings, in the fullest 
sense. It does not ‘exist for its own 
sake because it is a means of express- 
ing or giving form to feelings of 
power, love or religious aspiration. 
So far as one can judge, the orna- 
mental or figurative prehistoric arts 
obeyed the same rules as later arts. 
The exact date of their emergence is 
difficult to fix, partly because we are

the regions of the world, but above 
all because we are dealing with an 
evolutionary period; not a particular 
moment in time. Behind innovation 
there is always an inventor; but 
behind the inventor looms a whole 
social and historical background. 
And when, as in the present case, the 
facts cover many small stages spread 
“out over thousands of years, it would 
be an oversimplification to speak of 
the “invention” of painting or sculp- 
ture. 
Our knowledge covers the final 
period of European Neanderthal man 
and the end of the last glacial period 
—perhaps from 50,000 B.C. and 
certainly up 9,000 B.C. The begin- 
nings were extremely slow; and more 
than half the period was gone before

During the second half of the 
period, however, there was an extra- 
ordinary abundance of decorated 
caves in Spain, France, Italy and even 
the Urals, and a profusion of sculp- 
ture and engraving all the way from 
the Atlantic to Lake Baikal in Siberia. 
Works from this long initial period 
of artistic evolution will certainly be 
discovered in other parts of the world. 
But up to now the thousands of paint- 
ings and engravings discovered in 
Africa or southern Asia, for instance, 
belong to more recent periods. This 
does not, of course, make them any 
less valuable or significant. 
A very important point should be 
noted concerning prehistoric art: its 
technical means reached their fullest 
development from the very beginning. 
This is something that radically dis- 
tinguishes artistic creation from 
technical invention. Hunting, fishing,

weaving, clothing and home-making 
skills slowly evolved up to the present. 
One cannot imagine prehistoric man 
inventing the aeroplane on the basis 
of the scientific knowledge offered 
him by his own society. But with 
coloured earths and with flint tools 
whose cutting power is superior to 
most metal ones, the artist was 
immediately in possession of all his 
means of expression. 
Time brought new processes like 
mosaics or oil painting, new colours 
like greens or blues, as well as various 
nuances in the execution; but from 
the very first the artist could give his 
whole measure in forms, in contrasts 
of colour and in relief . . . The position 
is therefore very different for art than 
for technology.

HORSE'S HEAD IN MINIATURE 
Carved with superlative skill and minute precision by an artist of the 
Magdalenian period on a tiny piece of reindeer antler, this horse's 
head measures only 45 mm (2 in) from ear to muzzle. It was found 
in a cave at Mas d'Azil (south-west France).

gination can be disregarded when one 
considers the material equipment at 
his disposal. His level of achievement 
corresponds to the stage at which his 
society has arrived, according to its 
period and geographical situation. 
For art, the dependence on the 
technical and social environment is of 
another order. Crude works and 
those which reach full mastery of 
expression can be found in the same 
society, simultaneously or succes- 
sively. 
Where engraving and sculpture are 
concerned, the problem of tools does 
not arise. Flint is perfectly adequate 
whether for cutting or carving bone, 
lumps of soft stone or the walls of 
caves and rock overhangs. And it 
is even easier'to trace shapes with a 
finger on wet clay or to model them 
in the same material. So such works 
are found from the beginning. Model- 
ling and sculpture in low-relief do not 
appear until relatively late, however, 
probably not before 15,000 B.C. But 
the search for “three dimensional” 
effects is a dominant trait in the 
evolution of prehistoric art. 
In the case of “hollowed out™ works 
of art, one point deserves special 
mention. For practical reasons, low- 
relief is only found in hollows lit by 
daylight. The designs must have 
taken many weeks to execute; and in 
deep caves this would have required 
some form of lighting, as well as 
prolonged stays underground. 
But in some caves (for instance at 
Font de Gaume in the Dordogne), one 
comes across an expeditive process 
for rendering relief which reveals the 
use of an astonishing technical knack. 
After the figure has been traced with 
a line a few millimetres deep, the inner 
border has been rounded off, and with 
side lighting this gives a striking 
illusion of relief. 
A... from wall figures, 
prehistoric artists have left numerous 
engravings on stone tablets or bones 
and antlers. Certain objects like the 
tips of weapons are decorated with 
simple geometrical patterns; and spear 
throwers often bear highly elaborated 
animal figures. 
Small sculptures in the round in the 
form of human and animal figures were 
also made. In certain regions, such as 
Czechoslovakia or the U.S.S.R., where 
cave art is unknown, hundreds of 
statuettes carved in soft stone or 
modelled in clay have been found, 
while female figures, generally . with

CAVE WALL ART (Continued from page 34) 
The palette of the Palaeolithic painter 
greatly exaggerated forms, are com- 
mon from the Atlantic coast of the 
Pyrenees to Lake Baikal in Siberia. 
The development of painting is 
equally remarkable. As has been 
shown, colours were in use very early 
on. By 35,000 B.C., prehistoric man 
knew how to employ fire to oxydize 
natural ochres and change their 
shades; and the whole range of 
yellows and purplish reds was known 
and used. Black was supplied by 
natural manganese or charcoal. 
T cornoues for applying 
paint were no less varied. When the 
ochre or manganese was sufficiently 
firm and friable, true crayons were 
cut, which served to decorate flat 
surfaces. Hard colours were ground 
on a palette of rough stone; and both 
these and natural powders were 
applied in various ways according to 
the nature of the background or the 
effect sought after. 
Sometimes the pigments were 
stippled in close dots, dabbed on with 
the tip of the finger or printed with a 
small stick; sometimes continuous 
lines of varying width were drawn in 
the same way or even with true 
brushes. 
Ancient rock carvings have been 
found in many parts of the world. 
This rock engraving is from Lake 
Onega, 200 km east of Leningrad, 
where archaeologists have uncover- 
ed numerous traces of Neolithic peo- 
ples who lived on the lake's shores 
and islands: tools, and rock-cut ani- 
mal figures including many reindeer. Ph

Occasionally, a special method was 
otherwise have discouraged artistic 
efforts. The most striking case is the 
main part of the Lascaux grotto (Dor- 
dogne, France). The surface of the 
white calcite walls is lumpy, like a 
cauliflower, and ill-suited to the usual 
painting techniques. 
The Lascaux artists, some 15,000 
years ago, solved the problem by 
stencilling on the powdered colours 
with the help of a fur pad, giving a 
dappled effect. As these blurred 
dabs made it difficult to obtain a clear 
outline, the painter masked the outer 
edge of the figures with a strip of 
bark or leather, moving it along as he 
advanced. 
This extremely ingenious process 
required considerable manual dex- 
terity; and it confirms the feeling one 
has when one studies the great 
artistic achievements of the French 
and Spanish caves: the fresco artists 
must have been specialists, at least 
part of whose activity was devoted to 
decorating underground sanctuaries. 
As was mentioned earlier, the most 
original aspect of prehistoric cave 
wall art is perhaps the search for a 
three-dimensional effect. As well 
as low-relief sculptures and carv- 
ings with rounded inner edges, two 
other techniques were developed. 
The first is common to the various 
painting and engraving processes. It 
consists in taking advantage of natural 
irregularities in the wall by placing 
the work in such a way that a bump is 
used for a flank, the edge of a rock 
for a bone or a small knob for paws 
—with colours or engraved lines 
stressing the natural volumes and 
making them explicit. 
The second solution is to vary the 
thickness of the line or use shading 
or hatchings. This method is used 
with great skill at Altamira near San- 
tander, in northern Spain towards 
11 or 12,000 B.C. and at Niaux {Ariége, 
France). It puts the frescoes in the 
depths of these caves on a level with 
the finest works produced by the great 
artists of historical times. 
Can one indeed justifiably des- 
cribe as “primitive”, an art which 
already has thousands of years of 
development behind it? It is reassuring 
to remind ourselves that at a time 
when technology was rudimentary and 
human life still at a subsistence level, 
thousands of years before agriculture, 
metal-working and writing brought 
into being the civilizations of antiquity, 
man had found ways of giving full 
expression to his artistic thought and 
by the same token to his humanity. H

To say man is the "key™ actor in

course, Is to take a very biased view. 
There is no doubt that if this article

Many of my zoological colleagues, 
for instance, are principally interested 
in analysing the background of the 
non-human primates, the lemurs, mon- 
keys or apes. But | am an anthro- 
pologist which means that man is the 
central theme of my research so it is 
not surprising that | am primarily in- 
terested in the appearance of those 
structural and functional features by 
which we characterize man today. This 
being so we must clarify our ideas and 
decide just what we should be look- 
ing for in the primate fossil record. 
First of all we must examine the 
nature of our criteria and select those 
characters that are unique to modern 
man and can truly be called his 
“hallmarks” (*). There are quite a 
number of characters that we might 
choose but, bearing in mind that our 
source material is limited to fossil 
bones and teeth, the range is naturally 
rather restricted. The possession of 
speech and language is the most

unfortunately it leaves no trace in 
ancient bones. 
One can make all sorts of in- 
ferences that speech evolved at such- 
and-such a time but there is no scrap 
of direct evidence to support such an 
assertion. The ability to speak lies, 
first of all, in the shape and mus- 
culature of the mouth, tongue, soft 
palate, pharynx and larynx; and 
secondly, in the centres of the cortex, 
or outer shell, of the brain which 
govern the muscular control of the 
various “soft” parts mentioned above. 
Although many ingenious suggestions 
have been put forward none as far as 
we know can help us to recognize 
the capacity for speech from a study 
of bones. 
There are numerous cultura! 
phenomena which we would regard 
as significant hallmarks but, again, we 
cannot use them because they leave 
no physical evidence behind. Be- 
haviour itself does not fossilize but the 
extra-corporeal accessories of be- 
haviour do.

Man’s debt 
to the tree 
To his ancient ancestors who were tree-living 
creatures, man owes his mobility of hand, 
opposable thumb and the upright posture 
of at least the upper part of his body. Left, 
Gibbon apes still swing happily from tree 
to tree, but, like man, the gorilla (right) is 
now basically a ground-living animal, though 
his lower limbs have not adapted to true 
bipedalism and he still supports himself with 
his knuckles when walking. Through evolu- 
tionary changes in the pelvis, man and his 
ancestors adopted a bipedal, striding gait, 
better adapted to ground-living. Drawing (far 
right), the pelvic girdle of Australopithecus

JOURNEY OF THE PRIMATES (Continued) 
making behaviour can be identified. 
Much as a modern picnic site can 
reveal to an intelligent inquirer all he 
needs to know about the habits and 
social status of the picnickers, so liv- 
ing floors of early man with their 
hearths, their animal remains, their 
wall-paintings, their burials and so 
on can be read and interpreted by 
archaeologists. 
Unfortunately the background to man 
that we are committed to investigate 
extends many millions of years further 
back in time when no living floors and 
no artifacts existed. Apart from the 
evidence of stone or bone tools as 
supplements to our understanding of 
human dexterity we shall not be 
leaning very heavily on the evidence 
of “fossil behaviour”. What, then, are 
to be our criteria? 
When we think about man and 
compare him with non-man one of the 
first things that strikes us is that he 
stands upright and walks on two legs. 
But . this is not nearly a precise 
enough definition to exclude the many 
non-human primates who are also cap- 
able of upright bipedalism. Nor does it 
exclude, for example, the bears. For a 
more exact criterion we must draw 
upon our knowledge of the bio- 
mechanics of human walking. 
Human walking is a highly complex 
affair, This is not the place to stuff 
you with technical details like a 
Strasbourg goose with rich food, but 
to ask you to accept the simplified— 
but nonetheless valid—conclusion 
that modern man shows a unique 
method of walking which we call 
striding. Striding involves the muscles 
and the joints of the vertebral column, 
the pelvis, the leg and the foot in a 
complicated and precisely integrated 
series of manoeuvres. An alternative 
term for striding is heel-toe walking. 
We are now in a position to formulate 
our first hallmark: Man stands upright 
and when walking habitually uses a 
bipedal, striding gait. 
"opposable 
The second characteristic that 
strikes us is the dexterity of the human 
hand which is infinitely capable, 
exquisitely delicate but, at the same 
time, alarmingly powerful—powerful 
enough to cleave a brick in half with 
a karate chop, or to tear a city 
telephone directory into two equal 
parts. 
The essential component of the 
human hand is its opposable thumb, 
which provides the means for grasp- 
ing objects with strength (the power 
grip} or with delicacy (the precision 
grip). The opposable thumb is there- 
fore an obvious hallmark, but un- 
fortunately it is not unique to man; all 
living Old World monkeys and apes 
possess opposable thumbs. 
0. again we must draw 
upon our knowledge of the functional 
anatomy of man's hand to set us on 
the right track. Man's precision grip 
is much more sophisticated than any 
monkey's or ape's; when he places 
his forefinger and thumb together in 
a precision grip he is employing the 
two most acutely sensitive areas in 
his whole body. The sensory input 
from these small areas provides the 
neurological basis for the sort of skill 
that a watchmaker, a plastic surgeon 
or an assembler of micro-circuits 
possesses. 
Sometime ‘ago, In order to provide 
a means of quantifying the precision 
grip of primates, | introduced a simple 
ratio called the opposability index to 
express the relative lengths of the 
forefinger and thumb. The oppo- 
sability index of men is 65. The score 
for a chimpanzee is 43 and for a 
baboon, which approaches nearest to 
man in this respect, it is 57. So now 
we are in a position to formulate the 
second hallmark: man possesses an 
thumb whose length is 
approximately 65 per cent the length 
of his forefinger. 
¢ CC AR TNE ers 00 TEA red 
The third feature that strikes us 
about man is that his brain is large 
and rounded; but of course brains do 
not fossilize and so we can only make 
deductions about the brain from the 
study of its container—the brain-box. 
Unfortunately, apart from overall shape 
and size, there is no means of deter- 
mining the nature of the brain by a 
simple examination of fossil skulls. 
What is more, size itself is a some- 
what misleading indicator because 
it is naturally variable within a 
species; for example among mod- 
ern human populations the brain 
volume ranges from 950-2000 cubic 
centimetres. The average volume is 
about 1400 cc. Brain size is related 
to body size—bigger animals have 
bigger brains—and, in some way that 
we don't fully understand, to in- 
telligence. 
Nevertheless, brain size is a 
valuable guide to the palasontologist 
who is attempting to follow the track 
of man through time. From the 
earliest pre-human stages to the final 
flowering of the human family 
expressed In the species Homo sapiens, 
a steady trend towards enlargement 
is seen. Here, then, is the basis of 
our third hallmark which can be 
expressed thus: man, relative to his 
body size, has a large, rounded brain 
that may exceed 1400 cc in volume. 
Finally, we notice that man 
possesses small, even teeth arranged 
in an elegant parabolic form in his 
upper and lower jaw. The human 
teeth, like those of all living primates, 
are of four types: incisors, canines, 
premolars and molars. Together in 
both jaws they total 32, a number 
characteristic of all Old ‘World 
monkeys and apes but not New World 
monkeys or prosimians. 
Unlike the apes, man's teeth are 
all more or less the same vertical 
length; the canines which form 
massive elongated and projecting 
teeth in the apes are small, short and 
discrete in man. Human molars bear

### 52626: The Long journey of the primates

low, rounded cusps in contrast to the 
sharp, prominent cusps of apes and 
monkeys. The human third molar in 
both jaws is often small and is fre- 
quently absent, whereas in apes the 
third molar is often the largest of the 
series. 
There are many other differences 
but these few should be adequate for 
the purpose of defining the fourth hall- 
mark as follows: man's teeth are small 
and are arranged in the jaws in a pa- 
rabolic curve, the third molar being the 
smallest of the series and the canines 
non-projecting. 
W.. these hallmarks in 
mind we ought to be able to pick up 
the trail of man during our journey 
through the past. The trip will be 
rather like travelling by train between 
two cities a thousand miles apart. 
Most railway systems are very com- 
plicated affairs with numerous junc- 
tions, switching points, branch lines 
and dead-end terminals, so we have 
to constantly be on our guard that we 
do not become shunted along long- 
forgotten tracks that simply finish up 
at the end of nowhere at a pair of 
rusty buffers. 
There is a very real danger of this 
happening because evolution frequent- 
ly involves a form of mimicry as a re- 
sult of which similar characters crop 
up in unrelated or distantly related 
forms. We have already seen for 
example that walking on two legs is 
not uniquely the possession of man. 
This form of mimicry is more 
properly termed parallelism and the 
theory behind it is that, given -a 
similar set of environmental opportu- 
nities, animals with a common ances- 
try will tend to evolve in a similar way. 
The best example of parallelism in 
primate evolution is that the monkeys 
of the New World and the Old World, 
which are related through a common 
ancestor living 40 million or so years 
ago, share so many physical charac- 
ters that it is hard for the average 
person to tell them apart even seeing 
them side by side in a zoo. 
Man has a double ecological heri- 
tage. His earliest ancestors were tree- 
living creatures well adapted to mov- 
ing, feeding, mating and sleeping high 
above the ground In tropical forests. 
His later forebears were ground-livers 
spending their lives among tropical 
woodlands and grasslands in com- 
petition with the myriads of ground- 
based mammals including the large, 
predatory, carnivores. 
His two phases are complementary; 
without an arboreal background he 
could never have succeeded on the 
ground. He possesses neither the 
fleetness of the impala nor the killer 
power of the leopards, cheetahs and 
lions; but he has, through his arboreal 
background, acquired talents which 
were of infinitely greater value. 
He could run on the ground and he 
could climb trees; he could evade dan- 
gers by subtle manceuvres undreamed 
of by the instinct-dominated predators 
and with his emancipated hands he 
could use weapons and tools to pro- 
tect himself and to obtain food. Hands 
were far more efficient than the hooves 
of his ungulate competitors. Para- 
doxical as it may seem, man's success 
as a ground-living primate was entire- 
ly due to his arboreal heritage. 
The earliest ancestors of the pri- 
mates were among the first mammals 
to make their appearance. At this 
stage, some 70 million years ago, pri- 
mates-to-be were small, long-nosed, 
ground-living animals rooting among 
the leaves of the forest floor for their 
insect food, and distinguishable only 
by obscure characters of the teeth and 
skull from the other long-nosed insec- 
tivorous creatures. 
With hindsight, some authorities feel 
they can recognize these primates-to- 
be even though they possessed none 
SLE 
of the arboreal characters by which 
we now recognize the order. They 
may well be right, but to those of us 
interested in living primates (including 
man) the order, effectively, came into 
being when the primates started to 
live in trees. 
Plesiadapis is a most unprimate-like 
primate and is totally deficient in arbo- 
real adaptations, while Smilodectes 
and Notharctus which appeared a few 
million years later were already 
advanced tree-climbers. 
Arboreal characters can be briefly 
summarized as follows: 
HM Mobility of the hands and feet and 
particularly of the thumb and big toe 
which are well separated from the 
other digits and, in some primates, 
capable of being opposed. 
B Replacement of sharp claws by flat- 
tened nails, associated with the de- 
velopment of sensitive pads on the tips 
of the digits. 
HB A shortening of the snout associat- 
ed with a reduction in the apparatus 
and the functions of smell. 
B Convergence of the eyes towards 
the front of the face associated with 
the development of stereoscopic 
vision. 
B A large brain relative to body size. 
B An upright posture which may be 
confined to the upper part of the body 
in some but applies throughout in 
others. 
The lemur-like Eocene family the 
Adapidas (including the genera No- 
tharctus and Smilodectes) possesses 
most of these arboreal adaptations: 
nails had replaced claws and sens- 
ory pads were developing on the finger 
tips, the eyes were converging and 
the snout was shortening, the brain 
was relatively large, and the loco- 
motion pattern involved an upright 
posture of the upper part of the body 
while in the lower part the hips and 
knees were acutely flexed.

### 52626: The Long journey of the primates

JOURNEY OF THE PRIMATES (Continued) 
When the ape line and human line diverged 
This last feature, alone, merits our 
particular interest because the upright 
posture is one of the hallmarks we 
are committed to trace. Later forms 
such as Necrolemur, an early Euro- 
pean tarsier-like primate, and Hemia- 
codon, a North American form, show a 
similar postural pattern. 
The next recognizable stage in the 
fossil record is seen during the geolo- 
gical epoch known as the Oligocene; 
at present the ancestor-descendant 
linkages between the Oligocene and 
Eocene primates have not been prov- 
ed. Most of our information about the 
Oligocene primates comes from a 
region of Egypt called the Fayum, now 
desert but once covered with dense 
tropical forest. 
Between 25-35 million years ago the 
Fayum was the home of an extra- 
ordinary variety of ape and monkey- 
like creatures. Some, like Parapithe- 
cus, were probably destined to become 
true monkeys; some, like Aeolopithe- 
cus, to become “half-apes® like the 
gibbons, and some, like Aegyptopithe- 
cus, to become true apes like the chim- 
panzee and the gorilla. 
It has even been suggested very 
tentatively that one of these creatures 
called Propliopithecus represents the 
earliest known member of the human 
lineage. Both Propliopithecus and 
Aegyptopithecus, of which only teeth 
or Jaws are known, show some of the 
characters which anticipate the human 
condition.  Aegyptopithecus, while 
possessing some human-like dental 
characters, also has features which 
are strongly reminiscent of later apes. 
This raises an important point: the 
relationship of man and apes. Nearly 
everyone would agree that their rela- 
tionship in terms of anatomical struc- 
ture and physiological and biochemical 
functions is extremely close. The 
principal issue is how close? When 
did the ape line and the human line 
diverge? 
There are at least four schools of 
thought which we can call the “late- 
late”, the “late”, the “early” and the 
“early-early”. Personally, | favour the 
late school but there is something to 
be said for the early school which 
would hold that the human lineage 
dates back to Propliopithecus, some 
30 million years ago. 
The late school favours the early 
Miocene species from Kenya, East 
Africa, called Proconsul africanus (or 
something very like it) as a likely can- 
didate. We know a little bit about the 
gait, the skull and the teeth of P. afri- 
canus. The gait was quadrupedal and 
therefore provides no particular hint 
of future bipedalism; the hands are ra- 
ther human-like in proportion but the 
evidence of an advanced type of pre- 
cision grip Is absent; the opposability 
index has been estimated at 56. The 
brain is still rather primitive but was 
quite large in terms of body-size, and 
the teeth—like those of Aegyptopithe- 
cus—are ape-like rather than man- 
like, but not so completely specialized 
that one could not envisage an evo- 
lutionary reversal to a human-like form. 
During Miocene times volcanic act- 
ivity, rift-valley formation and moun- 
tain-building were in full swing. One 
of two consequences of this orogeny 
and the coincidental cooling of the 
earth's surface, which had been stead- 
lly proceeding throughout the Tertiary 
era, was the spread of grasslands at 
the expense of forests. Grasslands 
(or savannas) offered new evolution- 
ary opportunities to a variety of mam- 
mals, including the expanding popula- 
tion of primates in the rapidly shrink- 
ing forest zones. 
A few primate stocks, including the 
ancestors of man and the ancestors of 
the modern baboons, evidently react- 
ed to the challenge of the changing 
environment. In this way new hori- 
zons were opened up for our remote 
human ancestors, and for the evolution 
of the critical hallmarks of mankind. 
The earliest human ancestor as we 
see it at present was a creature called 
Ramapithecus known from north-west 
India and East Africa. Our material 
evidence for the potential humanity 
of Ramapithecus is slight and consists 
only of Jaws and teeth but is, neverthe- 
less, very revealing. 
Ramapithecus has a distinctly man- 
like tooth form lacking all the ape-like 
characters seen in Aegyptopithecus 
zeuxis and Proconsul africanus. The 
dental arcade Is rounded, the canines 
are small and the molar teeth do not 
increase In size from front to back as 
in the apes. Ramapithecus lived bet-

ween 12-14 million years ago but of 
course his ancestors may have evolved 
several million years before this date. 
The next recognizable stage in the 
human lineage started, apparently, at 
least 4-5 million years ago. There is 
fragmentary evidence that pre-human 
creatures belonging to the genus Aus- 
tralopithecus existed in two areas of 
East Africa, called Kanapoil and Lotha- 
gam. We pick up the trail of these 
near-men two million years later in the 
area of Lake Rudolf, again in South 
Africa, and in Tanzania at Olduvai 
Gorge; in all these regions they are 
most prolific. The early (Lothagam 
and Kanapoi) australopithecines do 
not tell us very much, but the later 
forms in East and South Africa show 
many of the characteristics of the gait, 
brain-size and tooth form that we are 
searching for. 
Australopithecines are generally re- 
garded as near-men. Technically, un- 
der the curious rules of current an- 
thropology, they do not qualify for the 
accolade of human beings, but at OlI- 
duvai Gorge 1.75 million years ago 
some of us accept the fact that the 
zoological genus Homo (man) first 
made his appearance. His way of life 
appears to have been that of a scaven- 
ger, a hunter of small game, and a tool- 
maker. 
Homo habilis, as this early man is 
called, was a bipedal walker and prob- 
ably a “strider”; his brain was still 
small by modern standards but bigger 
than his predecessors’, and his teeth 
showed a slight advance on the teeth 
of the australopithecines. His hands 
were of a human type but lacked the 
refinements of precision grip possess- 
ed by modern man. 
Homo habilis was succeeded in the 
fossil record by Homo erectus, known 
from South-East Asia (Java), Asia 
(China), Europe (West Germany) and 
both North and East Africa. Early 
Homo erectus (from Java) had a big- 
ger brain than Homo habilis (H. habilis, 
656 cc; H. erectus 935 cc) and the later 
manifestations of this species, from 
Peking for example, showed a maxi- 
mum brain-size of 1,225 cc. 
l. spite of this large brain 
volume, Homo erectus possesses a 
skull of primitive and easily recogni- 
zable shape. His gait Is assumed to 
have been both bipedal and striding. 
The form of his hands is unknown, so 
the only guide to the extent of his 
dexterity are the tools that he made. 
These fall broadly into the class of 
“power tools”, stone artifacts of simple 
construction designed for relatively 
crude purposes such as killing and 
skinning animals, cutting wood and 
pounding vegetable products. It has 
been shown by experiment that these 
could have been constructed and used 
in the absence of an advanced form 
of precision grip. 
Perhaps it was an increase in brain- 
size that stimulated the evolutionary 
improvement of the hand, but perhaps 
it was the other way about. Anyhow 
it seems highly probable that the com- 
plexity of the brain, the precision 
capabllities of the hand and the 
evolution of “precision tools” were 
closely interlinked. 
Exactly where and when Homo erec- 
tus passed the baton in the human re- 
lay-race to Homo sapiens is not 
known. It may have happened in dif- 
ferent parts of the world, at different 
times, and in different ways. There 
is no saying which geographic popula- 
tion of early men did it first. 
‘With the evolution of Homo sapiens, 
which is dated somewhere between 
250,000-400,000 years ago, our railway 
journey is almost at an end and we 
are entering the suburbs of the metro- 
polis. Most of us can begin to put on 
our overcoats and lift our cases down 
from the rack. The engine-driver has 
read the signals correctly, the signal- 
man has done his job and our work 
is virtually over—over for some, but 
not for all, The complexities of the sub- 
urban system are still to be nego- 
tiated, and for certain experts this part 
of the trip is a matter of deep concern. 
They are the specialists In the 
growth of agriculture, of citizenship, of 
social and political systems, of the 
spread of populations and the inter- 
mingling of genes, processes which 
are leading us slowly but inexorably 
towards the eventual unification of 
mankind in a single biological and 
cultural entity. Only when the train 
comes to a final stop at the terminus 
—at some future date—will these peo- 
ple reach for their overcoats and suit- 
cases and dismount. |

### 52638: Where did the first Americans come from? Antarctica, Siberia or across the Pacific...

OR ACROSS THE PACIFIC... 
Where did 
the first Americans 
come from? 
by Juan Comas 
Woe did the first inhabi- 
tants of America come from? At what 
time in history did their immigration to 
the American continent begin? These 
are the first questions we must ask our- 
selves before seeking to determine 
the biological and cultural traits of the 
first settlers in America. 
I have used the terms “immigration” 
and “settlers” on purpose, thereby 
explicitly rejecting the belief com- 
monly held at the end of the last cen- 
tury and in the first decades of the 
present century, according to which 
the New World saw man evolve inde- 
pendently from earlier forms as in the 
Old World, and hence that early forms 
of man existed in the Americas many 
hundreds of thousands of years ago. 
This is the theory held by the so- 
called “autochthonists® who based 
their beliefs on the discovery of bone 
remains on the American continent 
attributed—erroneously—to hominids 
less evolved than Homo sapiens and 
unearthed in geological strata judged 
to be—also erroneously—much older 
than has since proved the case. 
Going counter to this belief is the 
fact that only the less evolved pri- 
  
JUAN COMAS, born in Spain and now a 
citizen of Mexico, is internationally known 
for his work as an anthropologist. He is 
head of the department of anthropology of 
the University of Mexico, and editor of the 
authoritative "Anales de Antropologia®, pub- 
lished by the university in Spanish. He 
was for many years vice-president of the 
International Union for Anthropological and 
Ethnological Sciences, and was a member 
of both committees of experts on racial 
questions set up by Unesco in 1949 and 
1955. (See bibliography inside back cover.) 
mates, that is, lemuroid fossils corres- 
ponding to the Eocene period at the 
beginning of the Tertiary Era (some 
55 million years ago) have ever been 
found in America. As to the present- 
day living species, the New World 
comprises only the simpler types of 
simians, known scientifically as platyr- 
rhines, but there is no trace of the 
higher - types of primates, called 
catarrhines, which include apes and 
the anthropoids. 
As for the ancestors of Homo sap- 
jens, such as the pre-hominids and 
hominids, they are completely un- 
known to the Americas though they 
have been found in Africa, Asia and 
Europe. All of the prehistoric bone 
remains found on the American con- 
tinent indisputably belong to modern 
man and hence are much much more 
recent than any of the more primitive 
forms such as Homo erectus or Nean- 
derthal Man discovered elsewhere. 
Many suppositions have been ad- 
vanced over the years (and passion- 
ately argued) to explain where the 
first settlers in America came from. 
The list includes the Phoenicians, He- 
brews, Etruscans, Egyptians, Sumer- 
ians and Aryans, but no scientifically 
valid proof for any of these supposi- 
tions has been forthcoming, nor, for 
that matter, for the existence of the 
imaginary, fabulous Atlantis as the 
birthplace of the first Americans. 
Certain writers in the 19th century 
and even in the present century took 
it for granted that all the Indians of 
America stemmed from a common bio- 
logical stock. This gave rise to the 
common saying that: “all Indians are 
alike in colour and other features. 
When you've seen an Indian from one 
region you have seen them all.” 
This was based on the idea that all 
the migrants to the New World were 
Mongols of . Asian origin who had 
crossed the Bering Straits at different 
epochs going back no earlier than 
20,000 to 25,000 years ago. Accord- 
ing to this hypothesis, the physical and 
cultural differences observed among 
the Indians of the Americas can be 
explained in two ways: partly by the 
different degrees of biological evolu- 
tion of the migratory groups that cros- 
sed north-east Asia in the course of 
thousands of years; partly by the dif- 
fering environments of the various 
regions of America the settlers estab- 
lished themselves in. 
Other scientists, however, are of the 
opinion that from remote antiquity

such as the mammoth and the camel 
then roamed the land in great numbers 
and herds of horses are known to have 
existed 40,000 years ago. Weapon 
points used by America’s prehistoric 
hunters to bring down their animal 
quarry are shown at right. Spearheads 
have been found still embedded in the 
fossil remains of some animals. The 
Stone Age Indian could make a new 
weapon point in a few minutes—even 
a neatly polished axe within hours-—so 
he did not always bother to pull out 
his spearhead for re-use or cut it out 
when the shaft had broken off.

THE FIRST AMERICANS (Continued) 
Deep in the heart of Texas 40,000 years ago 
there coexisted on American soil 
human groups of different physical 
characteristics and of different origins. 
All the scientists who support this 
“multi-racial” thesis nonetheless 
unanimously agree that the Mon- 
goloid element that crossed the Ber- 
ing Straits from Siberia at different 
periods of migration by far dominates 
all other groups. 
According to Paul Rivet, former 
director “ of the Paris Musée de 
I'Homme, the populations of pre-Col- 
umbian America are the result of mi- 
grations to the continent of four racial 
groups: Mongols and Eskimos via the 
Bering Straits, Australoids and Malay- 
an-Polynesians across the Pacific. 
Rivet based his conclusions not only 
on the findings of physical anthropo- 
logy by studying data on physical 
and other characteristics of Indian 
groups from southern South America 
and those of Indians from certain 
areas in Brazil, Baja California and 
Ecuador, but also on cultural and lin- 
guistic analogies with population 
groups in Oceania. 
A. Mendes Corréa, of Portugal, ad- 
vanced the theory that an Australo- 
Tasmanian human element populated 
America not by sailing across the 
Pacific but by marching across An- 
tarctica, island-hopping across the 
string of archipelagos between Tas- 
mania and Tierra del Fuego at the 
southern tip of South Americal 
Mendes Corréa has indeed demons- 
trated that between 15,000 and 6,000 
B.C., Antarctica was free of glacial ice 
and actually had a temperate climate 
at the time. Obviously, no archaeo- 
logical proof exists to confirm this 
Antarctic migration hypothesis, and it 
will be extremely difficult, not to say 
impossible, to uncover any evidence 
with the permanent ice cap now cover- 
ing all of the Antarctic continent. 
According to Jose Imbelloni of Ar- 
gentina, one cannot truly understand 
the racial and cultural history of early 
America without taking into account 
the contribution of the peoples of 
south-east Asia, Imbelloni conclu- 
'des that seven distinct racial groups 
‘migrated to America Tasmanoids, 
Australoids, Melanesianoids, proto- 
Indonesians, Indonesians, Mongoloids 
and Eskimos. In his works he descri- 
bes and delineates a total of 11 types 
of Amerindians. 
More recently (1951) Joseph Birdsell 
of the U.S.A. sharply criticized the 
contradictory views concerning the 
population of the Americas put for- 
ward by various multi-racial exponents 
such as G. Taylor, R.B. Dixon, H.S. 
Gladwin, E.A. Hooton, E.W. Count, F. 
Weidenreich and J. Imbelloni. He 
advanced his own hypothesis that 
America had been settled by a mixture 
of two racial groups, Mongols and 
“Amurians” or archaic Caucasoids who 
had also reached the New World via 
north-east Asia, 
As proof of this dual origin, Birdsell 
claims to have found “Amurian” traits 
in contemporary American Indians, 
among the Cahuillas of the interior of 
Lower California and among the Yuki 
and Pomo of the northern Californian 
coast. But if the Indians of North and 
South America were indeed the result 
of the mixture of only the two Mongo- 
loid and Amurian strains, there ought 
to be a much greater similarity in 
blood groups than has actually been 
observed, particularly as regards the 
A-B-O and M-N groups. 
There have been repeated efforts to 
establish similarities and indeed possi- 
ble contacts between the“redskins” 
of the Atlantic seabord of the United 
States and the prehistoric Caucasoid 
man of the Cro-Magnon type who peo- 
pled western Europe at the beginning 
of the Upper Palaeolithic or Old Stone 
Age. Such claims cannot be dis- 
missed since they do contain an ele- 
ment of possibility but no proof of any 
kind has yet been forthcoming. 
F.. the above we can 
summarize our conclusions concerning 
the first inhabitants of the American 
continent as follows: 
1) No authochtonous human popula- 
tion ever existed in America. 
2) Never was there nor is there now 
any biologically homogeneous Amerin- 
dian type. . 
3) The overwhelming population mi- 
gration consisted of Mongoloids. 
4) There is still doubt and debate as 
to what and how many other human 
types also populated America, the 
most widely accepted hypotheses 
being 2 (Birdsell), 4 (Rivet) and 7 
(Imbelloni). 
The advocates of each of these 
hypotheses naturally explain the 
physical and other differences between 
the various types of Amerindians in 
different ways, and no definite conclu- 
sion can, of course, be reached until 
more extensive data is obtained. 
However, the large number of arch- 
aeological explorations carried out in 
recent years in various parts of the 
Americas has unearthed a rich store 
of stone implements and other objects 
as well as, to a lesser extent, fossi- 
lized human remains which, with our 
modern dating techniques including 
Carbon-14 now permit us to establish 
with relative certainty when man first 
appeared in America and a chronolo- 
gical time-table of his presence there. 
Thus we now know that man was 
present in the United States, for exam- 
ple, as early as 38,000 B.C. at a site 
found at Lewisville, Texas. Other pre- 
historic sites have been clocked at 
27,650 B.C. (Santa Rosa, California); 
19,500 B.C. (La Jolla, California); 8,505 
B.C. (Gypsum Cave, Nevada); 7,883 
B.C. (Plainview Site, Texas); and 6,274 
B.C. (Allen Site, Nebraska). In each 
case we must allow a few hundred 
years or more plus or minus as is 
customary for C-14 readings. The 
people who lived in this area between 
40,000 years ago and 8,000 years ago 
were all hunter-gatherers. 
The oldest human settlement in 
Mexico has been found to be Tlapa- 
coya in Mexico State where a disc- 
shaped file and an obsidian knife have 
been unearthed dating back to 
20,200 B.C. (plus or minus 2,600 years) 
and 21,150 B.C. (1,950 years) respecti- 
vely. Later prehistoric sites are also 
known, of course, which show that 
they too belonged to hunter-gatherers. 
Here are a few examples of datings 
from South America (plus or minus 
years are omitted): crude stone tool 
industries in Venezuela (14,375 B.C. 
and 12,275 B.C.); cultural remains in 
Lagoa Santa, Brazil (8,024 B.C.); pre- 
ceramic lithic culture in Lauricocha, 
Peru (7,566 B.C.); Inithuasi Grotto at 
San Luis, Argentina with a pre-ceramic 
lithic industry (6,068 B.C.); a cultural 
complex on the high terraces of the 
Gallegos river in southern Patagonia 
dating from between 10,000 and 
7,000 B.C.; excavations in Chile 
(9,380 B.C.) and elsewhere in southern 
Patagohia (8,760 to 6,700 B.C.). 
From the above examples a very 
interesting observation can be made, 
namely, that as we proceed southward 
the datings of the hunting and gather- 
ing cultures are less ancient. ls this 
a confirmation of the thesis that the 
settlers of America came exclusively 
by way of the Bering Straits and that 
South America was therefore peo- 
pled many millenia later than North 
America? | believe it is still too early 
to say and we must wait for further 
research and investigations. 
I. is generally agreed, for 
the moment, that the oldest date of 
38,000 to 40,000 years ago corres- 
ponds to the beginnings of the warm- 
ing up period of the last Ice Age in 
North America (known as the Wiscon- 
sin glaciation) when it was possible to 
cross from eastern Siberia to Alaska 
and thereby reach the more temperate 
regions of southern North America. 
Culturally, the first hunter-gatherers 
evolved until they became sedentary 
groups after learning to cultivate 
plants and domesticate animals. This 
was a slow and gradual process, but 
we have evidence of prehistoric sites 
where hunter-gatherer tribes were 
simultaneously engaged in the cultiva- 
tion of squash, chile beans and later,

CAVE DWELLERS OF THE AMERICAS, Dating by modern scientific methods of recently discov: 
ered stone implements and fossil human remains in various parts of the Americas show that man 
was present in the United States as early as 38,000 B.C., in Mexico by about 20,000 B.C. and as 
far south as Patagonia between 10,000 and 7,000 B.C. Many finds have been made in caves 
once occupied by Stone Age man. Photo shows a more recent site, known as the “Mummy 
Cave” In the grandiose setting of Chelly Canyon in the state of Arlzona. Here hundreds of cave 
dwellings and graves containing mummies have been found showing that it was occupied by man 
right down to historical times. 
Such agricultural sites have been 
found at Tamaulipas, Mexico, dating 
back to between 7,500 and 5,500 B.C., 
at Sierra Madre, Mexico (4,500 - 
2,500 B.C. and 5,000-3,000 B.C.). In 
the Tehuaca area of the State of Pue- 
bla in Mexico several prehistoric sites 
have been unearthed offering definite 
proof of the existence of agriculture 
between 6,000 and 5,500 B.C. 
In New Mexico (USA) agricultural 
levels have been found at a site 
known as Bat Cave dating back to 
about 3,300 B.C. while in the Peruvian 
Andes agricultural complexes dating 
between 4,700 and 3,000 B.C. have 
been found at Huaca Prieta, Nazoa, 
Paracas, Chilica, and other sites. 
The evolution from the hunter-gath- 
erer stage to agriculture occurred in 
America independently of the same 
development in the Old World. Re- 
search in plant genetics, ecology and 
ethno-history as well as chronological 
datings have effectively demonstrated 
this, thus refuting the thesis that agri- 
culture was introduced into America 
from Asia. 
The initial phases of an agricultural 
economy are known to have occurred 
in different parts of America, first with 
seasonal sedentary settlements and 
then year-round permanent agricultu- 
ral sites. Central America and the 
Peruvian-Bolivian area are at least 
two of the centres on the continent 
which originated the cultivation of cer- 
tain species of plants. Graded terra- 
ces and Chinampas (incorrectly called 
“floating gardens”) are two typical 
techniques used here in early inten- 
sive agriculture. ’ 
From this point we see the begin- 
ning of a new process of development, 
the so-called “high cultures” based 
on what Gordon Childe has termed 
the “urban revolution”, depending on 
extensive cultivation of maize, yucca, 
potato, beans and squash as well as 
the manufacture of ceramics, the use 
of polished stone implements and the 
beginning of the textile industry, etc. 
In Meso-America (Mexico, Guate- 
mala, parts of Honduras and El Salva- 
dor) the high cultures began around 
1,500 B.C. in the highlands. This was 
the case with the Toltec, the Aztec 
and Zapotec civilizations which ended 
with the arrival of the Spaniards in the 
16th century. The Olmec, Maya and 
Totonec civilizations emerged in the 
lowlands a little later than 1,500 B.C. 
In the Peru-Bolivia area, both along 
the coast (Huaca Prieta, Cupisnique, 
Paracas, Mochica, Nazoa, Pachaca- 
mac, Chuncay and Inca civilizations) 
and in the Andean uplands (Chavin, 
Cajamarca, Huaylas, Huilca, Qalas- 
saya, Tiahuanaco and Inca civilizations) 
the high cultures began to develop 
about 1,600 B.C. until their decline at 
the end of the 15th century A.D. 
Alongside these great civilizations 
there also existed much less advanced 
Ruins at entrance date from later pre-Columbian Indian times, 
cultural groups, hampered no doubt by 
the rigours of their surroundings and 
habitat. Notable amongst these were 
the populations living in the great river 
valleys of the Amazon, Orinoco and 
Parana as well as their many tributa- 
ries. 
From the 16th century, with the 
conquest, colonization and accultura- 
tion stemming from the arrival of Eu- 
ropean immigrants, the original Indian 
population of America underwent the 
following three major modifications: 
1) The Indians have dwindled to the 
point of extinction, as in Uruguay, 
Cuba, Haiti, Dominican Republic and 
Puerto Rico; or a reduced number are 
confined to reservations, as in the Uni- 
ted States. 
2) The Indian population still exists 
but has little contact with the, rest of 
the country, living within its own self- 
sufficient economy, virtually untouched 
by the process of acculturation. Such 
populations are found in the Amazon 
and Orinoco river ‘basins, eastern 
Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, etc. 
3) Large-scale intermingling of races 
has taken place to the extent that the 
majority of the inhabitants are biologi- 
cally and culturally mixed, though 
small pockets of Indian populations, 
where less intermingling and accul- 
turation have taken place, continue to 49 
exist, as in Mexico, Guatemala, the 
Andean plateau regions of Ecuador, 
Peru and Bolivia.

Early man 
and the emergence 
of races 
by Vsevolod P. Yakimov 
T. 3,500 million humans 
on our planet comprise an astonishing 
conglomeration of peoples. Amid this 
vast variety, anthropologists distinguish 
between groups of people having a 
common origin, living, or having lived, 
in certain defined regions, and poss- 
essing differing characteristic features 
in their facial structure, skin colour 
and colour and type of hair. 
Scientists call these groups races, 
but we should remember that there 
are no strict lines of demarcation bet- 
ween races. All these groups blend 
imperceptibly into one another with 
intermediate types possessing various 
combinations of physical charac- 
teristics. 
It can readily be seen that distinc- 
tions between individual groups do 
not affect the basic traits that all peo- 
ple have in common—an upright pos- 
ture, well-developed hands and feet, 
an intricately structured brain encased 
in a big skull with a straight, high 
forehead, absence of a bony eyebrow 
ridge, the presence of a prominent 
chin and a common structure of the 
  
VSEVOLOD P. YAKIMOQV, of the US.SR., 
Is Internationally famous for his work on 
prehistoric man. He has written over 
100 studies on primates and the evolution of 
man. He Is director of the Research Insti- 
tute for Anthropology and the D.N. Anuchin 
Anthropological Museum of Moscow State 
University, and is a member of the Executive 
Committee of the International Union for 
Anthropology and Ethnology. 
speech organs. All humans have the 
same number of chromosomes (46) in 
the cell nucleus; primates have 48 and 
the lower simians between 54 and 78. 
Thus modern man is biologically uni- 
form in basic features and polymor- 
phous as regards many secondary 
features, and scientists consider all 
human beings as belonging to the 
single species, Homo sapiens. The 
variations found in groups living in 
different geographical areas reflect 
only a differentiation within the single 
species due to a host of biological, 
social and other factors. 
The emergence of the earliest Homo 
sapiens was preceded by the stage of 
the “oldest” (palaeoanthropus) and 
the “old” (late palaeoanthropus) peo- 
ple, though it is important to note 
that late palaeoanthropus co-existed 
with early Homo sapiens in adjoining 
territories. - 
The genetic relationship between 
various groups of palaeoanthropus and 
Homo sapiens is a matter of consid- 
erable controversy. The question on 
which anthropologists are divided is 
whether all groups of palaeoanthropes 
can be considered as the ancestors of 
modern man and whether modern man 
developed in one or several regions. 
In modern anthropology there are 
two schools of thought on the origins 
of man and the major races—the poly- 
centric and the monocentric schools. 
The founder of the polycentric 
theory, the American anthropologist 
Franz Weidenreich, assumes that mod- 
ern man evolved in several regions, 
relatively independent of one another, 
and that people developed at different 
rates. His theory claims that modern 
man evolved from the “oldest” and 
"old" people in each region and that 
this gave rise to the formation of the 
major races—Europoid, Negroid, Aus- 
traloid, Mongoloid, etc. 
Anthropologists of this school, such 
as G. Debetz and V. Alekseev of the 
U.S.S.R. and Carleton Coon and 
C. Loring Brace of the U.S.A. point 
out that representatives of the modern 
races still possess traits typical of the 
fossil remains found in territories 
where these races once lived, 
0. the other hand, mono- 
centrists, Henri-Victor Vallios and 
G. Olivier in France, Francis Howell 
in the U.S.A., Kenneth Oakley in Bri- 
tain, Victor Bunak, M. Nesturkh, Y. Ro- 
ginsky and myself in the U.S.S.R., 
among others, consider that modern 
man evolved in a single region. Pro- 
fessor Roginsky believes that Homo 
sapiens emerged in a relatively wide 
area covering west Asia, parts of cen- 
tral and south Asia, and north-east 
Africa. Here various groups of pa- 
laeoanthropes interbred, enriching the 
genetic stock and triggering off the 
development of modern man. 
The ancient Homo sapiens who 
evolved there did not possess clearly 
distinguished traits of any of the 
modern races. In a certain sense he 
was “neutral” in racial aspects, and 
characteristics of the modern races 
were present in him in the most diverse 
combinations, 
It was only when human groups 
spread geographically and settled in 
definite territories that racial types 
evolved. That is why the races of 
modern mankind resemble one another 
so closely. This resemblance is a 
sign of their common origin, of their 
emergence in a single region. 
The monocentrists, who believe that 
mankind passed in its evolution 
through the palaeoanthropus stage, 
do not, however, maintain that every

local group of ancient people formed 
part of the ancestry of modern man. 
For historical and natural reasons some 
groups did not participate in the for- 
mation of modern man, or participated 
in that process through subsequent 
blending with already existing Homo 
sapiens. 
Some researchers, including myself, 
believe the late Neanderthals, the so- 
called classic Neanderthals, who lived 
in the Early Wurm glacial period some 
50,000 to 35,000 years ago, to be one 
of these groups. They differed 
greatly from Homo sapiens in physical 
respects; they were short (150 to 
166 cm.), massive, with big heads 
and big, coarse faces, and they also 
differed in their brain and hand 
structure. 
The late Neanderthals of Europe, 
however, did not go up an evolutionary 
blind alley. They too made consid- 
erable progress in the development of 
culture, society and speech. Yet 
certain of their characteristics, their 
inordinate physical strength and struc- 
tural ungainliness, hindered and com- 
plicated their transformation into 
modern man. 
This hypothesis is borne out by the 
palaeoanthropus fossils of the more 
progressive “sapient” type found in 
central and west Asia—in the Teshik- 
Tash caves, in the U.S.S.R. and the 
Skhul, Tabun and Qafzeh caves, in 
Israel. It is highly significant that they 
are older (about 60,000 B.C.) than the 
“classic” Neanderthals. 
Fossils of ancient representatives of 
Homo sapiens displaying some palaeo- 
anthropic traits have been found in 
the Crimea and the Caucasus, in the 
Mousterian culture sites generally 
linked with Neanderthals. This can be 
taken to indicate that the ancient 
“sapiens” spread from the area of 
their origin to the west, where “clas- 
sic” Neanderthals still existed at that 
time. 
Quite recently the Soviet scientists 
A. Zubov and V. Alekseev expressed 
the view that Homo sapiens emerged 
in two centres—north-east Africa and 
south-west Asia. This is a variant of 
the polycentrist viewpoint, based 
mainly on the differences between the 
specific dental structures of ancient 
and modern man, and can in a sense 
be regarded as a compromise between 
extreme polycentric and monocentric 
views. Moreover, both centres fall 
territorially within the fairly extensive 
area the monocentrists regard as the 
cradle of Homo sapiens. 
The most likely hypothesis, there-

### 52639: Early man and the emergence of races

32 
THE EMERGENCE OF RACE (Continued) 
fore, as to who modern man's ancestors 
were and where and when they 
emerged seems to be as follows. 
Modern man’s ancestors were the 
palaeoanthropes who possessed a set 
of “sapient” traits and inhabited west 
and south Asia and north-east Africa. 
From this one area groups of Homo 
sapiens spread to neighbouring 
territories. As these Homo sapiens 
populations, morphologically “neutral” 
in relation to modern races, were 
migrating, settling and integrating, the 
modern races formed. Homo sapiens 
probably emerged in the ancient 
“homeland” some 50,000 to 45,000 
years before our time. 
This view is confirmed in particular 
by data furnished by the British anthro- 
pologist, Kenneth Qakley. He estab- 
lished that the skeletons from Jebel 
Qafzeh were 70,000 years old. Mor- 
phologically “Qafzeh man” was a 
transitional form from palaeoanthropus 
of the "sapient” type to Homo sapiens. 
Radioactive carbon datings fix the age 
of Homo sapiens fossils in Europe at 
35,000 to 38,000 B.C. The oldest fossil 
of modern man, the skull found at 
Niah, on Kalimantan Island (Indonesia), 
displaying all the traits of fully formed 
Homo sapiens, is about 39,000 years 
old. 
Many original theories have been 
advanced concerning the factors res- 
ponsible for the development of Homo 
sapiens. At the beginning of this 
century the French archaeologists 
Gabriel and Adrien de Mortillet 
considered changes in climate (from 
humid, sub-tropical to a dry climate) 
and the change from an arboreal 
existence (which they believed Nean- 
derthal man to have led) to life on the 
ground to be the main reasons for his 
transformation into modern man. 
Later, H. Weinert (Fed. Rep. of Ger- 
many) and V., Gromov (U.S.S5.R.) and 
some other scientists asserted that the 
colder climate, caused by the advance 
of the glaciers, had been the main 
factor in the progressive evolution 
of the ancestors of Homo sapiens. 
S. other scientists be- 
lieve that the evolution of Neanderthal 
man into Homo sapiens was due lar- 
gely to the change from in-breeding 
within small scattered palaeoanthropic 
groups to breeding between different 
groups, which thus put an end to the 
negative consequences of incestuous 
breeding. Naturally, every one of 
these factors was important, but it is 
doubtful whether they alone could 
have transformed Neanderthal man 
into Homo sapiens. 
in 1849 | expressed the view (it was 
also arrived at independently by Fran- 
cis Howell of the U.S.A. in 1951) that 
selection in the severe conditions of 
the pre-glacial period prevented rather 
than promoted the evolution of ‘the 
classic Neanderthals towards Homo 
sapiens. The colder climate did not 
promote mankind's progressive dev- 
elopment and the severe living condi- 
tions made the Neanderthal's physique 
even more rugged. 
Refuting the above theory, the poly- 
centrists point out that classic Nean- 
derthals have been found in areas 
far from the glaciers, notably in Iraq 
(The Shanidar cave) and in Israel (the 
Wadi el-Amud site). But they ignore 
the fact that these were not pure clas- 
sic Neanderthals since they possessed 
some “sapient” traits in the structure 
of the brain-case and the shape of the 
cerebral hemispheres as shown by 
moulds of the inner skull surface. 
The formation of “sapient™ features 
proceeded more actively on territories 
free of glaciers. When we discuss 
“sapient” features, less importance 
should be attached to morphological 
traits than to those traits of Homo 
sapiens which substantially distinguish 
him from his direct predecessor, 
palaeoanthropus. 
Researchers have always been 
struck by the relatively high deveiop- 
ment of the culture of Homo sapiens, 
as compared with that of Neanderthal 
man, by his ornaments and his flair, 
which his ancestors did not possess, 
for various forms of graphic art (sculp- 
ture, stone and bone carving, poly- 
chromic mural painting, etc). 
This testifies to a qualitative change 
in man's thinking, to a growing com- 
plexity in the relations between peo- 
ple and hence to a progressive dev- 
elopment of social organization and 
forms of communication—the emer- 
gence of speech, 
Comparative studies of moulds 
made of the inner brain-case of palaeo- 
anthropus and Homo sapiens fossils 
show that in the latter the areas of 
the brain connected with purposeful 
labour, that is physical activity, speech 
and the regulation of the individual's 
social behaviour, underwent consider- 
able changes. Hence we can assume 
that emerging Homo sapiens acquired 
qualities important to man as a social 
being. Groups of ancient people who 
attained such qualities more rapidly 
found themselves better placed than 
other socially less organized palaeo- 
anthropic groups. 
Professor Roginsky of the U.S.S.R. 
was one of the first to advance this 
hypothesis. He drew attention also to 
the relative stability of the features 
displayed by man as a species from 
the moment of his emergence down to 
our own times, along with the astoun- 
dingly rapid advance of techniques and 
social development. 
At the same time the replacement of 
the Mousterian culture, associated with 
Neanderthal Man, by the late palaeo- 
lithic culture, generally associated with 
Homo sapiens, proceeded against the 
background of great changes in man’s 
physical type, so important to environ- 
mental adaptation. During the transi- 
tion from palaeoanthropus to man with 
his present bodily structure, an evolu- 
tion of the species took place—a 
transformation of one type of man into 
another. It can be assumed that, in 
primeval society, selection, which guid- 
ed the evolution of the ancients, 
stimulated their development into 
Homo sapiens. 
0. Homo sapiens had 
evolved, social tendencies neutralized 
and weakened the action of the 
species-forming selective mechanisms, 
and thus assumed paramount import- 
ance. Modern men began to resolve 
the problems facing them, not so 
much by adapting themselves to new 
environmental conditions which had 
resulted in anatomical and physiolo- 
gical changes in their ancestors, but 
by relying on and utilizing the fruits 
of collective labour. 
For this reason the physical type of 
Homo sapiens underwent no major 
changes during many millenia, whereas 
the range and complexity of his activi- 
ties developed enormously. Although 
the morphological changes that took 
place in Homo sapiens during the for- 
mation of the major races were partly 
adaptational, they did not change any 
of man’s traits as a species. 
According to this viewpoint, Homo 
sapiens is a supreme stage, in speci- 
fic qualitative terms, of man's evolu- 
tion, a stage characterized by a high 
level of social organization. In this 
development of man as a social being, 
speech has played a major role by 
passing on the experience and wis- 
dom accumulated by many generations 
and making possible their integration, 
along with new individual experience, 
in a collective store of knowledge. 
Academician N. Dubinin, the So- 
viet geneticist, has aptly pointed out 
that Homo sapiens is unique, since, 
with his advanced social awareness, he 
has developed, in addition to the 
hereditary programme possessed by 
all organisms, a second, non-genetic, 
non-hereditary programme—"“a pro- 
gramme of social heredity” as Dubinin 
calls it, which makes for man's pro- 
gress in every new generation, [|

~ Sinanthropus skulls, found at Choukoutien,

~ from Peking during the Second World War, 
leaving only a set of plaster casts 2nd . 
by Pierre Leroy 
  
FATHER PIERRE LEROY, S.., of the French 
National Centre for Scientific Research, in 
Paris, was formerly director of the Museum 
of Natural History, at Tientsin and of the 
Institute of Geobiology, in Peking. He was 
a friend and collaborator of Father Teilhard 
de Chardin, and is the author of “Dans le 
Sillage des Sinanthropes” (“In the Track of 
Sinanthropus”), Fayard, Paris (1971), which 
presents unpublished letter between Telhard 
de Chardin and J. Gunnar Andersson, who 
first Investigated the Choukoutien site in 
China where the remains of Peking Man 
were discovered. 
Te discovery near Peking, 
in December 1928, of the very early 
fossil remains of a man, Sinanthropus, 
or Peking Man as he has been named, 
was an event of primary importance in 
the history of the origins of man. 
As early as 1914, the Jesuit priest 
and natural historian, Father Emile 
Licent, had begun exploring the Basin 
of the Yellow River in the north of 
China. There he had come across 
some important layers of mammal fos- 
sils—"dragons’ teeth” as the Chinese 
called them, Himself no palaeontolo- 
gist, he sent sample fossils to Marcel- 
lin Boule, Director of the Institute of 
Human Palaeontology in Paris, who 
entrusted the task of examining and 
cataloguing them to one of his pupils, 
Father Teilhard de Chardin. Finally, 
in 1923, it was decided that Teilhard 
should go to China to examine the 
fossil layers on the spot. 
A French palaeontological expedi- 
tion was organized during which Li- 
cent and Teilhard explored an area on 
the edge of the Ordos desert, to the 
north of the Great Wall, where they 
discovered important layers of mam- 
mal fossils and some chipped stones 
which on examination proved to be 
extremely ancient. They concluded 
that prehistoric man had once inhab- 
ited these regions, but no human 
remains were found which could help 
to identify the craftsmen responsible 
for fashioning these stone implements. 
In 1918, the Swedish geologist 
J. Gunnar Andersson, founder of the 
Museum of Oriental Antiquities at 
Stockholm, was invited out to China 
to explore certain regions in northern 
China for mineral deposits. 
Johann Gunnar Andersson had 
studied at Uppsala University which, in 
1710, had become the headquarters of

PEKING MAN (Continued) 
the Swedish Royal Academy of Scien- 
ces. Men such as Berzelins and 
Linnaeus had made the Academy one 
of the most renowned of its kind in 
Europe. Fresh from university, An- 
dersson had taken part in Otto Nor- 
denskjold’'s dramatic expedition to the 
South Pole in 1901. After their ship, 
“The Antarctic”, had been crushed by 
the ice, the members of the expedition 
were taken aboard the Argentine war- 
“Uruguay” and returned to 
Sweden in 1903. Andersson became 
a professor of Geology and, at the 
age of 32, President of the Swedish 
Geological Society. 
Andersson began prospecting some 
forty miles to the west of Peking. It 
was a region of bare hills whose lime- 
stone bedrock had opened here and 
there and accumulated pockets of sun- 
baked clay, the "red earth” of the 
Chinese geologists. Here he discov- 
ered a vast deposit of mammal fos- 
sils in a perfect state of preservation. 
So rich was the find that he decided 
to postpone its exploration until later, 
and in 1920 he returned to the site ac- 
companied by Dr. W.D. Matthew, a 
palaeontologist from the New York Mu-, 
seum of Natural History, and Dr. Otto 
Zdansky, of the University of Uppsala. 
In the course of the excavations, 
Zdansky found, among the rubble of 
bones, two teeth which he was unable 
to identify; had they come from a mon- 
key or from a man? Four years were 
to pass before this puzzle was re- 
solved. In October 1926, to the gen- 
eral surprise, Andersson took a definite 
stand—the teeth found by Zdansky, he 
declared, were human, and a hominid 
had probably lived at the site of the 
find. 
Then, two years later, Dr. Birger 
Bohlin of Uppsala University, discov- 
ered a perfectly preserved lower 
molar in the same quarry. There was 
no room left for doubt, it was a human 
tooth, and the quarry in which it was 
found was to become world famous— 
the quarry of Choukoutien. 
1. was now certain that 
prehistoric man had inhabited the vast 
territory of Asia, from south of the 
river Yenisei to Peking. But where 
were other remains of these creatures 
to be found? 
The spot to be explored was selec- 
ted on the basis of Andersson's intui- 
tion and the discoveries of his collea- 
gues Zdansky and Bohlin. Since Li- 
cent and Teilhard had found no traces 
of human skeletons in the Ordos de-

THE QUARRY 
OF CHOUKOUTIEN 
Choukoutien hill was systematically 
divided up into sections of two metres 
square. Each cubic metre of earth 
dug up was carefully sieved so that 
nothing would be missed. 
Dr Pei Wen-chung, formerly a pupil 
of the Abbé Breuil in Paris, was in 
charge of the excavations. Father 
Teilhard, of the Geological Survey of 
China, was responsible for the strati- 
graphic study of the terrain. 
The internationally famous prehis- 
torian, Abbé Breuil, was also to play 
an important role. He had previously 
studied specimens from the Ordos 
desert and had found traces of ancient 
palaeolithic workmanship quite distinct 
from that known in Europe. He was, 
therefore, conversant with Chinese 
prehistoric tools and his opinions 
would be of the greatest value if other 
stone tools were found. 
In December 1929, the dome of a 
skull—whether of a man or a monkey 
was not known—was found lying in 
the sand under a limestone overhang. 
It was connected, perhaps rather pre- 
maturely, with the human molar found 
earlier by Bohlin. Were its discov- 
erers right to dub it Sinanthropus or 
Peking Man, or were they led, by 
their desire to produce a startling dis- 
covery, to take their dream for rea- 
lity? At all events, monkey or man, 
the problem of Sinanthropus had now 
been posed. How was it to be re- 
solved? At that time there was -no

means of settling the question, the 
skull was so primitive and incomplete 
that there was no way of deciding its 
real nature. 
Two criteria, tools and fire, enable 
anthropologists to decide whether 
they are dealing with the remains of 
animals or men. Tools alone are not 
enough, nor is the ability to fashion 
them absolute proof of human pre- 
sence. In fact, under certain cir- 
cumstances animals are capable of 
making tools. However, they lack the 
quality of foresight. Once a tool has 
been used for its immediate purpose, 
it is abandoned, rather in the way that 
a young child may throw its spoon 
away after eating its soup, not think-

ing that it will be needed again in a 
few hours time. 
Man is not only a craftsman; his 
intelligence enables him to make abs- 
tractions. He makes tools that will 
last and this power of abstraction en- 
ables him, unlike the animals, to make 
and keep fire. When, therefore, an 
anthropologist finds durable tools and 
traces of fire beside fossil remains 
that could be either of monkeys or of 
men, he knows without doubt that they 
must be the remains of men.

been brought to the Cenozoic Labora- 
tory. This was the laboratory in 
which studies were made of the geo- 
logy and palaeontology of the period 
from the Tertiary to the present day. 
At the laboratory we met Pei Wen- 
chung with whom we had a long dis- 
cussion. We were on the point of 
leaving, when Teilhard asked him point- 
blank, “Hasn't anything really new been 
found at Choukoutien?” “No”, re- 
plied Pei, “we are still turning up lots 
of remains of stag, tiger, hyena and 
all kinds of small mammals”. Then, 
as an afterthought he added, "Oh yes,

desk he took out a few fragments of

### 52640: The Puzzle of Peking man

PEKING MAN (Continued) 
 
The bone of friendly contention 
between Father Teilhard de Chardin and Abbé Breuil 
quartz which he handed to Teilhard. 
Teilhard did not hesitate for an Instant. 
At first glance he had seen that these 
quartz fragments bore signs of delib- 
erate shaping. “This quartz has been 
worked”, he said. Pei's delight 
knew no bounds. “So these stone 
fragments found near skulls must 
therefore be Sinanthropus’ tools?” 
“There Is no doubt about it", replied 
Teilhard, “So Sinanthropus was a 
man?® “That is my opinion”, answer- 
ed Teilhard. 
Teilhard was even more sure of his 
appraisal since, during his trip to Paris 
in the winter of 1930, he had visited 
Abbé Breuil at the Institute of Human 
Palaeontology and had placed on his 
desk a small stag's antler on which 
there was a protuberance. “| shan't 
tell you where it came from”, he told 
the Abbé, “but what do you make of 
this object?” 
“It was heated shortly after the ani- 
mal was killed”, replied the Abbé, 
“and it is an implement fashioned by 
man by hammering the remains of the 
animal's forehead with a stone; the 
marks of the stone's impact can be 
seen on the stem”. “But it comes from 
Choukoutien”, replied Teilhard. “I 
don’t care where it came from”, replied 
Breuil, “my conclusion remains the 
same”. 
The quartz fragments found by Pel 
seemed, .therefore, to confirm the 
great prehistorian's opinion. It was 
immediately decided to send some 
quartz samples to Breuil in Paris so 
that he could give his opinion on this 
vitally important matter. 
Without waiting for the Abbé’s reply, 
Teilhard left for Kalgan where he was 
to rejoin the Citroen motorized scien- 
tific expedition which was about to set 
out for central Asia. 
Meanwhile, at the invitation of the 
Rockefeller Foundation, Abbé Breuil 
went to Peking, towards the end of 
1931. He wanted to examine the Chou- 
koutien site for himself. He did not 
support the view held by the anatomist, 
Davidson Black, his former pupil Pei 
Chen-wung, and his friend Teilhard, 
and his preliminary assessment was 
that Sinanthropus was not a man. He 
thought that he was more likely to 
be some kind of game on which early 
man had fed, throwing his bones, 
along with tools and implements made 
from stags’ antlers, into the Choukou- 
tien quarry. Examination of the 
quartz fragments showed plainly that 
they were deliberately fashioned, 
clearly recognizable tools. Yet there 
was nothing to support the conclusion 
that they were the work of Sinanthro- 
pus. 
This was how things stood when 
Teilhard returned to Peking after a 
long and wearisome journey across 
Asia, He immediately took up his 
work at the Cenozoic Laboratory. In- 
formed by friends of Breuil's doubts, 
he re-examined all the samples brought 
back from Choukoutien, comparing 
them with the Sinanthropus remains 
beside which traces of fire had now 
been found in the form of a layer of 
cinders twelve centimetres thick. 
Why did Breuil have such strong 
reserves, and how had he come to 
think up the improbable theory of the 
hunter and his game? The reason was 
that he could see no possible chrono- 
logical link between the remains of 
Sinanthropus and the perfection of the 
stone and bone tools he was sup- 
posed to have used. 
Teilhard was not a man to allow 
himself to be influenced only by 
“points of view". He wanted to base 
his judgement on concrete evidence, 
and he communicated his own observ- 
ations to Breuil. After several letters 
had been exchanged between the two 
men, Teilhard was unable to convince 
Breuil and Breuil failed to shake Teil- 
hard's convictions. 
Sone about Teilhard, 
Breuil wrote, “To my great regret he 
continues to stick to his original stand- 
point. While Teilhard is a wonder- 
fully good observer of a geological 
site and an excellent palaeontologist, 
he was not trained in technical prehis- 
toric studies and the industrial aspects 
are beyond him.” 
The point at issue between the two 
men was that, for Teilhard, the quartz 
tools found were the work of Sinan- 
thropus, while for Breuil, the fact that 
tools made of bone were also found 
made this hypothesis seem extremely 
doubtful. 
The more value Teithard placed on 
the stone industry as indicative of the 
capabilities of Sinanthropus, the less 
sure he was of the specific nature of 
the bone industry. In a letter dated 
June 17, 1932 to his friend George Bar- 
bour he wrote, “A study on the stone 
industry of Choukoutien will appear 
in the next Bulletin (of the China Geo- 
logical Survey). It puts forward a 
more cautious view than that of Breuil. 
| don't believe that a systematic bone 
industry existed at Choukoutien.” 
A few months earlier (March 20, 
1932) he had expressed the same 
opinion in a letter to J.G. Andersson: 
Concerning Choukoutien, you have 
received Pei's paper (and possibly 
Breuil's too) on the newly discovered 
industry. Since these two papers 
were published we have collected or 
uncrated a large number of new sam- 
ples including a large series of chipped 
boulders. | am sorry not to be in 
full accord with my dear friend Breuil. 
My present feeling is as follows: 
1) The stones are certainly artifacts. 
2) But, even in the case of the finest 
specimens in quartz-crystal, the indus- 
try looks very primitive. | have been 
unable to recognize any true “pointe”, 
for instance, nothing anywhere near 
comparable with the Mousterian points 
in quartz-crystal found in France. 
3) The bone and antler industry 
seems to me to be more than ques- 
tionable. | think that Breuil has been 
deceived by appearances which occur 
in any bone deposit. Logically he is 
led to recognize a similar industry in 
the Nihowan Saumerian beds, a sup- 
position which, so far, cannot be ad- 
mitted. 
| hate this disagreement with Breuil, 
since I like him awfully and since | am 
partly responsible for his coming to 
Peking. But what can | do? 
The most critical point Is to prove 
that, without any ' doubt, the tool- 
maker was Sinanthropus himself. But 
the fact that the jaws and a piece of 
skull were found together with the 
tools seems as convincing as possible. 
I am preparing with Pei a new paper 
on this question. What a pity you 
cannot come here for at least a few 
weeks. We need youl 
Good luck in your work. 
Teilhard de Chardin. 
Teilhard and Davidson Black were 
on their way back from the 1933 Inter- 
national Geological Congress of 
Washington when a cable reached 
them from Peking announcing a discov- 
ery which could either decisively clarify 
or further complicate the situation at 
Choukoutien. 
At the very top of the hill of Chou- 
koutien, where the site had been 
broken up by previous excavations, a 
trench had been dug and a shaft sunk, 
at Teilhard’'s request, to give sideways 
access to the Sinanthropus layer at 
the bottom left of the excavation ditch.

S CIENTISTS have long 
speculated about the origins of 
speech, and a great many theories 
have been advanced. 
One of the earliest, already current 
in Ancient Greece, held that the first 
words were onomatopoeias—imita- 
tions of the sounds prehistoric man 
associated with his various activities. 
Another maintained that words devel- 
oped from inarticulate cries of fear, 
alarm, delight and so on. According 
to a fairly recent theory, it was the 
combination of gestures and vocal 
noises used to indicate a particular 
action that led to the emergence of 
speech. 
But none of these theories explains 
VICTOR BUNAK, of the Institute for Ethno- 
graphy of the U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences, 
is one of the world's leading authorities on 
the early development of speech. He has 
written many studies on race, genetics, the 
theory of the genesis of speech, etc., which 
have been widely published in the world 
press. Dr. Bunak is a member of the Inter- 
national Anthropological Association, the 
International Society of the Biology of Man 
and of many other anthropological societies.

walkie-talkie 
how shouts or onomatopoeias could 
turn Into articulate syllables and 
words, or what factors determined the 
development of mental activity along 
with the faculty of speech so closely 
connected with it. For it is man's 
ability to speak that above all dis- 
tinguishes him from the animal. 
Modern science places the begin- 
ning of human evolution in the early 
Quaternary period, some 1.8 million 
years ago, when a branch of biped 
primates appeared. These hominids, 
man's earliest ancestors, lived in the 
open plains. They were omnivorous, 
eating fruit, green shoots, roots, birds’ 
eggs, grubs and so on. 
Since they were ill-equipped by 
nature for life in the open plains, they 
learned to use objects as weapons to 
defend themselves and as tools to 
obtain food: rocks to fling at their 
enemies or prey, bone fragments to 
clean carcasses, sticks and shells to 
dig up edible roots. These imple- 
ments became essential accessories 
to daily life, multiplying the. strength 
of the hands, extending their reach 
and replacing the long, sharp claws of 
beasts. 
Animal behaviour is guided by 
instincts—by a chain of automatically 
connected actions that never varies. 
Actions based on choice and the 
experience of much trial and error are 
extremely rare. 
The chimpanzee, for instance, can 
use a stick to reach a coveted bit of 
food. If he is given two short sticks, 
he will usually amuse himself with 
them rather than try to use them to 
reach the food. If he does manage 
to join them together to attain the 
food, he will have had to make so 
many exhausting attempts that the 
result has no practical significance. 
This is because the two percepts 
“action with the stick®™ and “making 
the stick longer” exist in his mind quite 
independently. It is difficult for him 
to connect them or to substitute one 
for the other. 
The use of implements, not accident- 
ally as with animals, but systematically 
as in the case of man, became

ORIGINS OF SPEECH (Continued) 
successful only when the choice and 
treatment of materials began to 
correspond to a preconceived aim, in 
other words, when an association was 
established between a chain of 
actions. 
Man finally left the animal world 
when he was at last able to reproduce 
in his mind coherent images of differ- 
ent objects and actions, to distinguish 
between them and to combine some 
with others. This enabled man to 
form percepts about the common 
properties of classes of objects. The 
mental images of these linked percepts 
are what we call concepts, and the 
capacity to form concepts was the 
first main feature distinguishing Homo 
sapiens from the earlier hominids. 
The next stage in man's evolution 
was the ability to combine and diver- 
sify these concepts, a process that 
represents a considerable develop- 
ment of the intellectual faculty. Con- 
cepts form the bricks of man's mental 
activity, and even the simplest among 
them differ substantially from the 
"concrete percepts” to which the 
mental activity of animals is limited. 
The combination of percepts in a 
single mental operation or concept 
becomes possible because of its 
association with vocal stimulations. 
The link-up between the various per- 
cepts takes place in areas of the 
cerebral cortex that are stimulated by 
impulses coming from the vocal organs 
as well as those coming notably from 
the auditory organs. The sound of 
the voice and the corresponding 
movements in the mouth and throat 
become, as it were, symbols of 
concepts, a different set of vocal 
movements being associated with 
each one. 
The vocal organs can produce a 
great many sounds, but in each lan- 
guage only some 30, known as 
phonemes, are used (sounds with a 
distinctive and differentiating function). 
There are, however, hundreds of 
phoneme-combinations or syllables, 
and many thousands of syllable com- 
binations. Even so, the resulting 
vocal sounds do not become elements 
of speech until a specific semantic 
content or meaning becomes attached 
to them, just as new concepts are not 
assimilated until they have been given 
specific vocal expression. 
In the early periods of human 
evolution, before definite speech 
systems or languages existed, con- 
cepts and words were formed simul- 
taneously. This is a dual process 
which consists of combining mental 
percepts and vocal movements. When 
a man thinks, even if he does not 
pronounce words aloud, his speech 
organs make rudimentary movements,

P.cson is a compara- 
tively new branch of science but the 
records of man's preoccupation with 
the riddles of his origins go back to 
the dawn of history. In his early 
search for the truth man drew upon 
the riches of his imagination, and 
strange stories, which were invented to 
explain the mystery of creation, can be 
found in the myths and legends of 
many peoples. 
As the centuries passed, however, 
man began to look for a rational expla- 
nation of the mystery of life through 
the study of nature. This led ultima- 
tely, as we shall see, to a bitter con- 
flict between the Church and the pio- 
neers of the science of prehistory, 
which began in the eighteenth century 
and was brought to a climax in 1859 
by the publication of Darwin's Origin 
of Species. 
The crude stone cutting tools which 
were made by our very early ancestors 
are now accepted as the clues from 
which we learn about their cultural life. 
For many thousands of years, however, 
these implements, fashioned from flint, 
chert, obsidian or other types of stone, 
lay scattered over the face of the earth 
and were regarded as mere “curiosi- 
ties of nature”. Some Greek philoso- 
phers believed that these had been 
launched by Zeus and called them 
“thunderbolts”, and local superstition 
in many countries invested them with 
magical powers. 
It was not until the latter part of the 
sixteenth century that Michael Mer- 
cati, physician to Pope Clement VIII, 
realized the true significance of these 
so-called "thunderbolts”. “Most men”, 
he wrote, “believe that ceraunia (thun- 
derbolts) are produced by lightning. 
Those who study history consider that 
they have been broken off from very 
hard flints by a violent blow in the

days before iron was employed for 
the follies of war.” 
Towards the close of the seven- 
teenth century, a London apothecary, 
John Conyers, who was described 
by his friend John Bagford as a man 
“who made it his chief business to 
collect such Antiquities as were daily 
found in and about London", dis- 
covered “the Body of an Elephant”. 
Not far away he came upon a pear- 
shaped stone. The two friends must 
have examined and discussed this 
stone on many occasions. 
In Bagford's opinion, which must 
have been met with a good deal of 
scepticism at the time, it represented 
“a British weapon made of a Flint 
Lance like unto the Head of a 
Spear”, which had been used in the 
days before Britons knew the use of 
brass or iron. Bagford suggested, 
therefore, that the elephant was one 
of the many which had been brought 
to England during the Roman occu- 
pation of Great Britain, and had 
possibly been slain with the stone 
weapon discovered by his friend 
Conyers. 
it was nearly a century before 
John Frere made the next correctly 
interpreted discovery of man-made 
“stone tools”. These stones described 
by Frere as “spear-heads”, were 
found in the brick-earths in an ancient 
valley at Hoxne in Suffolk, associated 
with the bones of extinct animals. 
Laying aside the preconceived ideas 
of his generation, Frere had the 
courage to announce what he believed 
to be the true significance of his 
discovery. He not only .recognized 
the human origin of the tools, but 
suggested that they belonged to a 
very remote geological period, an 
idea which was incompatible with the 
persistent and widespread belief in a 
universal flood in Noah's time. 
This brilliant interpretation, however, 
was ignored by contemporary scientific 
opinion. It was not until 1859, when 
the brick-earths of Hoxne were re- 
visited, by the geologist Sir John 
Evans and by Sir Joseph Prestwich, 
that Frere's Interpretations were 
verified and his place as one of the 
pioneers of prehistory was established 
for all time. 
It was not long before another vitally 
important step was taken towards 
the unveiling of man's origins, when 
the true status of fossils (which had 
puzzled generations* of men) was 
finally established. Fossils are now 
known to be the remains of plants, 
shells and bones which have been 
preserved by natural means in the

creatures which have lived on our 
planet. 
The advanced thinkers of the eight- 
eenth century came to believe that 
fossils were of organic origin. The 
next step towards a better under- 
standing of their true value was to 
find out when the fossilized creatures 
they represented had lived. It was 
only natural, in an age which was 
deeply influenced by religious doc- 
trines, that enlightenment should be 
sought in the Old Testament account 
of the creation. 
An answer which was acceptable 
to a very large number of scientists 
was found in the story of “The Flood"; 
this suggested that all creatures, 
except those saved by Noah at God's 
command, had perished under the 
waters of a “universal deluge”.

Clearly, then, it seemed highly 
reasonable to accept the idea that 
fossils were the remains of those 
creatures which had been drowned in 
the Flood and buried under the debris 
which covered the earth when the 
waters went down. This became 
known as the “Diluvial theory™ and 
was strongly supported by the Church. 
But there were a great many free- 
thinkers who believed that this philo- 
sophy was contradicted by the 
evidence of geology. Groups of fos- 
silized animals, each differing from 
the others, had been observed in 
successive geological strata, indic- 
ating clearly that they had lived at 
different geological periods of time. 
If this was so, then they could not 
all have been drowned in one and 
the same great flood. 
In order to accommodate the new 
data, the famous French palaeont- 
ologist Baron George Cuvier suggest- 
ed that there had been a succession 
of catastrophes, each followed by an 
era of calm during which the earth 
had been restocked. He was careful, 
however, to fit this new philosophy

into the accepted biblical chronology. 
God's first creation, he suggested, 
had consisted mainly of marine 
creatures, his second of reptiles and 
his third chiefly of mammals. These 
were destroyed in turn and a fourth 
creation, as described in the Old 
Testament, was ultimately swept 
away by “The Flood”, with the 
exception of the inmates of the ark. 
Launched by a man of such reput- 
ation as Cuvier, the new “Catastrophic 
theory” gained Immediate support; 
but a handful of advanced and 
courageous thinkers began to suspect 
that the duration of geological time 
had been grossly under-estimated. 
At this time the Church was still 
blindly supporting the conclusion 
proposed by Archbishop James Ussher 
in 1654, that the. world had been 
created in 4004 B.C. He had arrived 
at this estimate by computing first 
the ages of Adam and his descendants, 
as recorded in the Old Testament, and 
then by adding a number of years 
deduced from a study of Hebrew 
history.

For centuries before the notion of evolution became generally accepted, 
men refused to believe In the existence of fossils dating back hundreds 
of thousands, even millions of years, and. all kinds of theories were put 
forward to explain the strange objects that were constantly being 
disinterred. One popular theory was that they were the remains of 
creatures that had perished in The Flood, and in 1716 the Swiss doctor 
Johann Scheuchzer, seen In engraving left with a collection of fossils, 
even published a book entitled “Museum Diluvianum”.

75 million years ago. The amazing Dinosaur egg, bottom right, was one

Cuvier could not possibly fit three 
additional creations into this time scale. 
He therefore adopted the proposals 
of Comte Georges de Buffon, a great 
French geologist, and pushed the 
creation of the world back by 80,000 
years. 
The early part of the nineteenth 
century was remarkable for the 
intense interest which scientists in 
Europe, England and America began 
to take in cave exploration. Reports 
circulating in 1822 claimed that the 
caves in southern Germany had 
yielded the remains of many extinct 
forms of animals, including those of 
elephant, rhinoceros, hyena and bear. 
The news of these discoveries inspired 
an English clergyman, Dean William 
Buckland, at that time also Reader in 
Geology in the University of Oxford, 
to investigate the Paviland cave on 
the Welsh coast. It was not long 
before Buckland made one of the 
notable discoveries of the century. 
The Paviland cave is set In 2a 
limestone cliff and soon yielded a 
store of prehistoric treasures. Flint 
implements, as well as ornaments and 
tools of bone and ivory, lay embedded 
with the same species of extinct 
animal which had been found in the 
stratified caves of Germany. With 
them Buckland discovered a human 
skeleton, stained with red ochre. 
This became popularly known as 
“The Red Lady of Paviland®, though 
it was [ater found to be that of a young 
man, 
The problem of interpreting his 
discovery placed Buckland in a difficult 
position. As a geolpgist, he suspected 
that he had found the remains of a 
“pre-diluvial man". As a Christian 
minister and a Diluvialist, the tenets 
of his faith precluded him from ad- 
mitting it. In the end, he apparently 
allowed his conscience to dictate his 
pronouncement. He explained his 
discovery by suggesting that although 
the remains of the animals had 
probably been swept into the Paviland 
cave by flood waters, the human body 
must have been intrusively buried at 
a much later date, -when man had 
settled. in England long after “The 
Flood". 
A few years later a Roman Catholic 
priest, the’ Reverend John MacEnery, 
began to investigate the huge 
rambling limestone cave on the Devon 
coast of England known as Kent's 
Cavern. He found man-made stone 
tools in association with the same 
species of extinct animals that Dean 
Buckland had uncovered in the 
Paviland cave; but unlike Buckland he 
did not allow his scientific judgment 
to be obscured by religious beliefs. 
In spite of the severe criticisms to 
which he was subjected by the 
Church, and even by Buckland, Father 
MacEnery remained convinced that he 
had found sufficient evidence to 
maintain that man had lived in England 
long before the time of the “Biblical 
Flood", as a contemporary of the

AN EARLY 
‘EVOLUTIONIST 
An early exponent of the doctrine of 
evolution was the German zoologist Ernst 
Haeckel (1843-19198). These drawings made 
by Haeckel himself In 1866—some of many 
he produced for books on’biology—iliustrate 
one example of his theory of recapitulation, 
i.e. if a land animal had ancestors which 
lived In water and used gills, each embryo 
of that animal continues to develop gills 
even though they may be lost during later 
embryonic development. They show (from 
left to right) fish, salamander, tortolse, bird, 
calf, pig, rabbit and human embryos. At 
first stage (top row) all have gill-like organs 
to the right of the eye. At second stage 
(centre) limbs develop but “gills” are still 
present At third stage (bottom) physical 
differences are apparent and “gills” have 
disappeared in non-aquatic creatures. 
ANTEDILUVIAN THEORIES (Continued) 
 
   
 
The earth begins to yield up its secrets 
extinct animals whose remains he had 
found. The notebooks in which he 
recorded his discoveries and inter- 
pretations were found and published 
many years after his death. 
Meanwhile, the extensive limestone 
caves near Lidge, in Belgium, had 
been attracting the attention of an 
intrepid and dedicated palaeontologist. 
In the course of his explorations, 
Dr Schmerling of Belgium investigated 
more than forty caves along the 
banks of the River Meuse and col- 
lected quantities of fossilized animal 
remains which were associated with 
implements of stone and bone. Human 
fossil remains were both fragmentary 
and scarce, but since he found them 
embedded in the same strata, 
Schmerling maintained, in spite of 
oppositlon, that all three groups were 
contemporary. 
In 1833 he made the discovery for 
which he is famous. Day after day, 
month after month, he had been 
visiting a cave named Engis. His 
reward came at last with the discovery 
of an almost complete “primate” skull. 
It was embedded five feet within the 
breccia and surrounded by the remains 
of extinct forms of elephant, bear, 
tiger, hyena, rhinoceros, reindeer and 
other animals which had disappeared 
before the beginning of what was then 
accepted as the time boundary of the 
late Stone Age. In Schmerling’s 
opinion, this was conclusive proof that 
man had been living in Europe “long 
before the Deluge”. 
Another discovery that was totally 
ignored during this period was made 
in 1848 in Gibraltar. This find, a 
well-preserved skull, was eventually 
brought to England in 1862, but it was 
not until the beginning of the twentieth 
century that its unique place in the 
history of human evolution was finally 
established. It represented, as we 
shall discover, the first recorded 
remains of Neanderthal man, whose 
history plays an important part in the 
story of man's evolution, 
It was largely due to the brilliant 
and indefatigable work of a French- 
man, M. Boucher de Perthes, that the 
balance of scientific thought was 
finally tipped in favour of those who 
believed in the existence of “ante- 
diluvian man” 
Boucher de Perthes was a lover 
of antiquities as well as a great 
scholar. In 1825, when he was about 
forty years old, he was appointed to 
the post of customs officer at Abbe- 
ville on the river Somme. The gravel 
beds in the valley of the Somme were 
continually being exploited for com- 
mercial purposes and had already 
been investigated and found to contain 
the fossil remains of extinct animals. 
These gravel beds naturally attract- 
ed the attention of Boucher de Perthes, 
who soon began to notice that many 
curiously shaped stones were dug 
from the gravel by the workmen. In 
spite of the fact that the gravel beds 
had been assigned to the so-called 
prediluvial geological period, Boucher 
Drawing Ernst Haeckel 
de Perthes was convinced that the 
stones, which he began to collect from 
the workmen, were in fact “stone 
tools” which had been made by man. 
He was sure that he had found positive 
proof of man's existence in Europe 
before “The Flood”. 
He claimed that: the soils outside 
Abbeville contained stones worked by 
“antediluvial man”, in association with 
the fossil remains of large animals 
belonging to extinct species. Boucher 
de Perthes began to be regarded by 
scientists as a dreamer and a vision- 
ary. The Church dubbed him a heretic. 
He does not appear to have had one 
single supporter of any authority until 
1854, when he was visited by a 
Dr Rigollot, a physician from Amiens, 
whose scepticism about the age and 
authenticity of the “stone tools” from 
Abbeville was well known. 
Having examined the Abbeville 
stone implements, Rigollot returned 
to Amiens and discovered that there 
were similar stones in comparable 
strata at OSt-Acheul near Amiens. 
Completely converted, Rigollot ranged 
himself enthusiastically on the side 
of the opponents of the diluvialist 
theory, and it is fitting that the work 
of these two pioneers of prehistory 
should be associated with two early 
cultures of the Stone Age known as 
the Chellean (or Abbevillian as it is 
now called), and the Acheulean.* 
* Chellean after the site at Chelles, Abbe- 
villian after the site at Abbeville and Acheu- 
lean after St.Acheul.

We have already seen how the 
significance of a fossil human skull, 
found in a quarry in Gibraltar in 1848, 
went unrecognized. Nine years later, 
some workmen quarrying the limestone 
cliffs of a deep ravine near Dusseldorf 
in Germany made a similar remarkable 
discovery. The celebrated Nean- 
derthal cave (which has long since 
been demolished), then opened half 
way up the steep side of the cliff and, 
in 1857, the remains of a strange 
individual were found buried beneath 
its floor. 
By good fortune, a medical doctor, 
who was interested in fossils, re- 
covered the remains of this skeleton 
from the workmen and sent them to 
an expert anatomist for examination. 
The extraordinary character of the 
skull presented many problems. These 
were made the more difficult and 
unhelpful because no other animal 
remains and no artifacts were found 
nearby. There was literally no asso- 
ciated clue to guide the scientists in 
their estimation of the antiquity of 
these human bones. The find aroused 
intense interest in scientific circles. 
It is to Professor William King of 
Queen's College, Galway, in Ireland, 
that honour is due for being the first 
scientist to recognize that the skull 
cap . from the Neanderthal cave 
belonged to a representative of a 
hitherto unrecognized type of mankind. 
Although the vault of the skull was the 
only well-preserved part of the fossil, 
King created a new species for its 
  Charles Darwin (1809- 
1882) is shown at left one 
year before his death. 
When he returned from his 
voyage in H.M.S. Beagle 
at the age of 27, he 
brought back with him 
specimens of the 13 types 
of finches (right) he found 
in the Galapagos which 
were to give him the clue 
to the relationship between 
variation and adaptation. 
The traditional Idea of 
creation maintained that 
each of these 13 species 
had been separately creat- 
ed and never varied. 
Darwin assumed that since 
these species were fund- 
amentally the same they 
were descended from a 
common ancestor and that 
the variations were due to 
adaptation to circumstan- 
ces. Darwin was violently 
attacked from all sides 
after the publication of 
“On the Origin of Specles”. 
The 19th century cartoon,

Germany, carried the cap- 
tion “Darwin in consulta- 
tion with one of his 
ancestors.”

reception and named it Homo neander- 
thalensis. 
Scientists of the time were not then 
ready to believe that the prehistoric 
world might have been peopled by 
different species of mankind. Many 
of them therefore continued to regard 
the Neanderthal skull as a pathological 
specimen. More than half a century 
was to elapse before King's opinion 
was endorsed by science and the 
famous skull from the Neanderthal 
cave accepted as representing 
a member of the species he had 
named Homo neanderthalensis. 
The first half of the century was 
now almost over, and the stage was 
set for one of the most dramatic 
moments in the history of science. 
Lyell and other geologists of the period 
had pushed the story of our planet 
back in time, presenting mankind 
with a new and awe-inspiring concept 
of a world which was old beyond 
imagining. 
Their research had revealed that 
great areas of land, now submerged 
by water, had once joined Asia to 
America, Europe to Africa, and Great 
Britain to the rest of Europe, so that 
in prehistoric times both men and 
animals could have wandered across 
these land bridges from one con- 
tinent to another. Evidence had also 
been discovered to show that large 
parts of the world had once been 
frozen in the grip of a great glacial 
epoch. 
In Switzerland, between two glacial 
deposits, geologists had found a bed 
of fossilized plants which could only 
have flourished in a temperate climate. 
This, together with an accumulation 
of additional data, led them to believe 
that there must have been both glacial 
and interglacial stages within the 
Great Ice Age. 
From about 1850 on, the *Diluvial” 
theory rapidly lost ground. Not only 
was it untenable in the light of the 
new geological data which were 
coming to hand, but many scientists 
were beginning to wonder whether the 
Biblical “Flood” had, in fact, been a 
“Universal Deluge”, or merely a local 
flood confined to the area in and 
around the Euphrates Valley, where 
Adam and all his descendants, in- 
cluding Noah, had reputedly lived. 
Learned men throughout the ages 
have speculated upon the number and 
combination of species which Noah 
must have packed into his Ark. In 
the sixteenth century the famous 
Elizabethan sailor and explorer, Sir 
Walter Raleigh, calculated that there 
must have been “eighty-nine distinct 
species of beastes”, but by the end 
of the eighteenth century this figure 
had been doubled, and the estimated 
proportions of the Ark had grown 
correspondingly formidable. 
The problem was aggravated by 
evidence which had now come from 
such far-flung areas as Africa, Asia, 
America and Europe, that each con-

ANTEDILUVIAN THEORIES (Continued from page 63) 
tinent had its own particular fauna. 
Forms ancestral to these animals had 
been found in geological deposits 
formed before the Biblical “Flood” 
could have taken place. Only by 
means of a miracle, therefore, could 
Noah have collected individuals from 
all the living species in the world 
before the “Flood” and redistributed 
them afterwards. 
The controversy regarding the 
existence of man in Europe before 
the “Flood” now began to die away, 
and scientists concerned themselves 
with the chronology of glacial and 
interglacial man and his cultural 
remains, Now that the true signi- 
ficance of stone tools was appreciated, 
a vast wealth of data was beginning 
to accumulate about the social life 
and industries of our remote ancestors. 
A succession of classified cultures 
known as Stone Age, Bronze Age and 
finally Iron Age had by now been estab- 
lished. 
Theories and ideas, suppressed for 
so long by religious prejudice, now 
struggled into the light, and were 
apparent in the new and rational 
approach which was being adopted 
in the search for man’s origins. Many 
of the old beliefs which had been 
exaggerated by poetic fiction were 
therefore swept away. 
Wherever the curiosity of man led 
him to investigate and chronicle the 
marvels of the natural world, scientists 
now found themselves in the posses- 
sion of a vast storehouse of know- 
ledge. It remained for, someone to 
postulate a theory which would account 
for the diversity of life on earth 
and the ultimate miracle of mankind. 
The idea of evolving life, which was 
so soon to capture the imagination of 
man, was not a new one. Until now, 
however, it had been stultified by the 
bigoted acceptance of the doctrine of 
special creation, which maintained that 
all species remained exactly as they 
were when first created. A handful 
of advanced thinkers of the late 
eighteenth century, such as Carl Lin- 
naeus, the famous Swedish naturalist, 
Erasmus Darwin of England, and 
Lamarck of France, had put forward 
revolutionary ideas which were in 
opposition to the theory of immuta- 
bility of species. It was, however, 
Charles Robert Darwin who finally 
gave the world a new concept of the 
animal kingdom. 
Today Darwin's concept of evolution 
is so well known and so widely 
accepted that it is difficult to imagine 
the magnitude of the sensation it 
caused when it was published in 1859. 
The first edition of the book was sold 
out very quickly and the reaction to 
its doctrines was immediate. 
The Church saw it as a threat to 
the very foundations on which the 
doctrine of special creation and the 
literal belief in Biblical chronology had 
been built. It therefore attacked 
Darwin with an almost fanatical inten- 
sity. The idea that a wise and powerful 
God had designed and created all 
living things in a permanent immutable 
form, was part of the Christian faith. 
Many scientists, while recognizing the 
genius of a theory which would with- 
stand the most acid tests of logic, 
nevertheless turned from the idea of 
the mutability of species on purely 
religious grounds. 
Darwin himself was emotionally 
involved in the conflict which his 
theory of evolution had provoked, and 
he always stressed that he had not 
been motivated by any anti-theological 
bias when he wrote the Origin of 
Species. For those who came to 
accept Darwin's theory, man began 
to be regarded as the ultimate triumph 
of a process of evolution which was 
even more miraculous and awe- 
inspiring than was the concept of a 
special creation of each separate form 
of life, 
Louis S. B. Leakey 
and Vanne Morris Goodali 
THE PUZZLE OF PEKING MAN (Continued from page 56) 
In the course of this operation the 
workmen discovered under the sedi- 
ment, at the top of the hill, a well pre- 
served cave, which became known as 
the Upper Cave. It had been used as 
a refuge by animals and by men. 
Human remains, including three well- 
preserved skulls of a much more 
recent period than Sinanthropus, were 
mixed with fossilized skeletons of hye- 
nas, bears, wild goats, tigers and 
stags, and ostrich and civet bones. 
Amid all this confusion lay evidence 
of a quite different culture, fairly close 
to the neolithic—pierced teeth and 
shells, more finely fashioned stone, 
bone necklaces and polished stag 
antlers. 
One very important fact emerged. 
A close study of this material and a 
comparison of it with that found at 
lower Choukoutien and the Ordos 
desert revealed a number of affinities 
and resemblances. Perhaps this was 
due to the similar nature of the stone 
raw material found on these sites: 
quartz, hyaline, silicified limestone and 
chalcedony, as well as pebbles used 
for hammering. 
Nevertheless, the man of the Upper 
Cave, more advanced and a better 
workman, had found a way of piercing 
shells, teeth and even stones with 
which to make necklaces, and the or- 
naments were always found in the 
immediate vicinity of the skulls. The 
industry of the Upper Cave belongs 
to the close of the Palaeolithic era; 
we are now at the beginnings of the 
advanced era of shaped stone, the 
Neolithic era. 
Thus the discoveries made in the 
Ordos desert in 1923 took on new 
meaning. The heterogeneous stone 
industry uncovered by Licent and Teil- 
hard was probably the work of men 
of differing races, brought to this 
place by migratory waves. It has 
links with Mousterian, Aurignac and 
Magdalenian industry. The man or 
men of Ordos fill an intermediary posi- 
tion between the two fossil forms 
found near Peking. 
Prehistoric men, one group as old 
as Pithecanthropus, the other more 
recent, Homo sapiens, inhabited the 
‘Choukoutien site, using, at an inter- 
val of some tens of thousands of years, 
the same raw materials for their indus- 
try—a primitive industry of uneven yet 
also inestimable value to the anthro- 
pologist, having specific, distinctive 
characteristics readily detectable to 
specialists. 
As far as the bone industry of the 
Sinanthropus period is concerned, al- 
though it was positively identified and 
defended by Abbé Breuil, it remains a 
subject of controversy to this day. 
The friendly, scientific quarrel bet- 
ween Teilhard and Abbé Breuil was 
never finally resolved, each of them 
maintaining his own position, Was 
this necessarily a bad thing? | do not 
think so. It shows us how far a scru- 
pulous study of facts can leave men 
of science divided when they are con- 
vinced that their reasoning is rigor- 
ously objective. 
Although, as far as | know, Abbé 
Breuil never went back on his opinion, 
he nevertheless sided with the spe- 
cialists. Like them he saw in Sinanthro- 
pus a representative of a race of men 
in the full sense of the word, that is to 
say, capable of handling fire and 
making use of quartz and pebbles in 
a way essential for his survival. What 
he did not accept was that all the stone 
and bone tools found in the Choukou- 
tien layer were made by Sinanthro- 
pus. 
Let us hope that today’s Chinese 
geologists and anthropologists will 
reap as rich a harvest as their prede- 
cessors. and that, one day, they will 
give us the long-awaited answer,

THE FACE-MAKERS 
Coon about the past Is an enduring characteristic of 
mankind, and Interest in our predecessors is not limited to the 
hard facts of what they achieved and how they lived; equally 
intriguing is the question of what they looked like. 
improved scientific methods of creating anthropological por- 
traits from skulis, developed over the past few decades, have 
enabled us to reconstruct the likenesses of such legendary figures 
of the past as Ivan the Terrible and Tamerlane (see photos below). 
These methods have also made it possible to authenticate disput- 
ed human remains, as, for example, in the case of the puzzle of 
the two skulls of the German poet Friedrich Schiller (see photo 
story page 68). 
With historical figures such as these, records and descriptions 
exist by means of which we can check the accuracy of our recon- 
structions, but the task is not so easy when we attempt to create 
anthropological portraits of our prehistoric ancestors. 
The first attempts to reproduce the outward appearance of early 
man were made during the last decades of the 19th century. 
Anatomists had established certain links between the shape of 
the skull and the flesh and muscles of the face. Such men as 
Professor Schaffhausen of Germany and Professor Kohlman of 
Switzerland were pioneers In this field and during the first half 
of this century several anatomists and anthropologists, sometimes 
with the help of artists and sculptors, attempted to reproduce the 
features of our early ancestors. 
However, reconstructions made by different people of the same 
Neanderthal skull from La Chapeile-aux-Saints, in France, were 
so varied that it was clear that the methods used were inade- 
quate. A big step forward was made by the French anthropologist 
by Mikhail Gerasimov 
Marcellin Boule who reconstructed the basic muscles of the face, 
neck and torso on the assembled Neanderthal skeleton from La 
Chapelie, creating a figure with the characteristically stooped 
spine, the short, forward-thrusting neck and protruding head. 
| had been interested In this problem ever since | was a 
schoolboy and realized that before creating a portrait of prehis- 
toric man we first had to learn how to reproduce the appearance 
of contemporary man. For ten years | carried out research into 
the techniques for reproducing faces from skulls and, in 1937, 
| was abie to formulate a method which has proved itself over 
more than thirty years and has even been used by criminologists 
to identify unknown persons. 
Historical problems too were resolved by these methods. Why, 
for example, were Tamerlane and his son Shahruh of different 
anthropological types? Tamerlane's skull is Mongoloid, while 
Shahruh’s Is Europoid. Proof of the blood relationship between 
Tamerlane and his descendants—Shahruh, Mironshah, Ulug-Beg 
and Mohammed-Sultan—was provided by the morphology of their 
skulls; they all possessed the same asymmetrical form which 
could only be explained by heredity. Shahruh, however, inherited 
his Europoid features from his Tadjik mother. 
When the family sepulchre of Ivan the Terrible was opened in 
1963 there was considerable doubt as to the authenticity of the 
skeletons found. The reconstructions | made corresponded per- 
fectly with contemporary portraits of the Tsar (the right eye 
smaller than the left, the heavy chin, the protruding lower lip, 
which combined to give him his “terrible” appearance) and of his 
son (an insignificant, harmless bald-head). 
| was also able to identify with certainty the skull of the 11th

century poet Rudaki; the eye orbits of his skull showed signs 
of atrophy resulting from the blindness with which he Is known 
to have been afflicted. 
The comprehensive study of modern man by anatomical and 
anthropological methods, by X-Rays and photographs of living 
persons, provided a great deai of Information about the complex 
relationship between the structure of the muscles and soft integ- 
ument of the head and face and the skuli. In the case of pre- 
historic man the skull, of course, Is the only thing we have to go by. 
The Individual features of man are determined by the propor- 
tion, size and shape of the skull, its asymmetry, the degree of 
relief development, the structure of the surface, the vertical and 
horizontal profiles, the structure of the nasal bones, size and 
shape of the teeth, their bite, the size and shape of the eye 
orbits. The thickness of the soft tissue depends upon the 
degree of development of the relief of the skull. As a rule, very 
anclent hominids possess fairly strong reliefs and this is taken 
into account in reconstructing their features, but the same methods 
and techniques are employed In reproducing the likenesses of 
both prehistoric and modern men. 
i began working on a portrait of prehistoric man In 1937 and 
we now have an entire gallery of portraits showing man’s evo- 
lution from the Lower to the Upper Palaeolithic period. 
Reconstructions made from the skulls of ancient forms of men, 
such as “Pithecanthropus® and “Sinanthropus®, give clear 
evidence of the wide range of morphological variations and the 
complexity of human evolution. Study of early Neanderthaloids 
and of classic Neanderthals, helps us to understand the mech- 
anisms which led to the beginnings and the development of 
early “sapiens” forms.

THE TWO SKULLS 
OF FRIEDRICH 
SCHILLER 
When the German poet Friedrich Schiiier 
died, in 1805, two deathmasks were made, 
one in plaster and one in terra-cotta, and 
a portrait drawn by Professor Jagelmann 
(Photo No. 5). In 1826, a skull (Photo 
No. 1) and skeleton were exhumed from 
the communal grave In which Schiller had 
been buried and identified by his children, 
by Goethe and by Schwabe as Schiller's. 
Later serious doubts were raised and it 
was said that the skull was not Schiller's. 
In 1911 an anatomist, Froriep, found ano- 
ther skull (Photo No. 3) in the same 
common grave which he claimed was the 
true Schiller skull. in 1961, the German 
Academy of Sciences in Berlin asked 
Professor Gerasimov to use his technique 
of plastic reconstruction to determine 
which of the two skulls was authentic. 
Photo No. 2 shows (a) Gerasimov's 
reconstruction of the profile of the skull in 
Photo No. 3 superimposed on (b) a 
silhouette in black of the profile of the 
skull in Photo No. 1, Photo No. 4 shows 
Gerasimov's reconstruction of the 1826 
skull (Photo No. 1) which confirms that 
this skull, recognized by Schiller's children, 
Goethe and Schwabe, was indeed authentic

MAN, THE FIRST WALKIE-TALKIE 
Continued from page 58 
giving the same record on an electro- 
myograph (a recording of muscular 
vibrations) as for spoken words. So 
the communication of information and 
the formation of concepts supplement 
and control each other. 
The combination -of percepts in 
concepts and the expression of their 
symbol, the word, has become a 
function of the speech organs because 
no other human organ can respond 
with such versatility, accuracy and 
speed to impulses from the cortex, 
without an excessive expenditure of 
energy and without interfering with 
any other motor activities. 
Modern man can pronounce hun- 
dreds of syllables a minute, each of 
which requires a different use of the 
vocal chords, a different direction of 
air expelled from the lungs and a 
different positioning of the tongue and 
the mouth cavity. The whole system 
of articulation can switch from one 
position to the next in a fraction of a 
second, 
This mobility of the speech organs 
and the extremely flexible link-up of 
concepts are the result of a long 
evolution. To trace the steps in this 
evolution scientists have studied the 
different stages of man’s increasingly 
complex mental activity, the structure 
of jaws and other parts of skeletons 
in fossilized apes and hominids, and 
the stone tools of prehistoric men. 
No fossil records have been discov- 
ered of the first hominids who 
systematically used stones and sticks. 
The cut stones of the Olduvai culture 
(1.7 million years ago) show that to 
give a stone a pointed tip, the crafts- 
men of that period chipped off several 
irregularly-spaced pieces of different 
sizes, which suggests that the Olduvai 
hominids were at an Intermediary 
stage between concrete percepts and 
concepts, or what are known as 
“general percepts”. 
Their vocal activity probably also’ 
belonged to an intermediate stage. 
They inherited from their animal 
ancestors audible signals consisting 
of single sounds, but Instead of 
reproducing these sounds automat- 
ically they were already able to select 
them to a certain extent. 
The earliest hominids had already 
mastered the art of making articulated 
sounds and combining them in differ- 
ent ways to form syllables, which 
initially remained unchanged. This 
early form of articulate speech is 
called the “lalia” stage (from the 
Greek word meaning to chatter or 
prattle). 
Lalias were not used to exchange 
ideas or converse, but to stimulate 
actions or to signal some important 
event in the life of the group. They 
were monosyllables with many mean- 
ings and of course had no grammatical 
structure. Yet they possessed all 
the basic properties of this type of 
speech: fixed enunciation of separate 
sounds and their combination into 
syllables. (The capacity to combine 
syllables and words did not come 
until much later.) 
Substantial progress in the develop- 
ment of speech is indicated by the 
shaped stones of the Acheulean 
culture, which emerged some 200,000 
years ago. These were implements of 
a definite form with regular facets cut 
all over the surface. To make a 
primitive chopper it had been enough 
to remember a sequence of four or 
five blows, but to shape the Acheulean 
implements the craftsman had initially 
to have a clear idea both of the desir- 
ed final shape and of the sequence 
of blows and other actions needed to 
produce it. 
The Acheulean implements reveal a 
varied and flexible combination of 
percepts corresponding to the con- 
ceptual stage of mental activity, though 
naturally in rudimentary form, without 
any clear-cut distinctions between 
individual percepts. True. thought 
becomes possible only when there Is 
a free combination of at least two 
independent elements: the percept of 
the action and that of the object or 
subject of the action; at the previous 
stage both aspects are fused. 
Along with the flexible combination 
of separate percepts, the Acheulean 
hominids mastered the free combin- 
ation of syllables, forming words. 
Their fossilized remains show that 
they possessed a larger brain than 
the earlier forms, as well as a less 
massive and shorter mandible. Be- 
cause of this shortening of the lower 
jaw, the root of the tongue was lower 
and the position of the larynx was 
altered, which meant that the air 
current was no longer directed straight 
at the lips, but had now to overcome 
various barriers, notably the tongue. 
The first words, still few and mainly 
monosyllabic, related to material 
objects and basic facts in the lives 
of primitive peoples, particularly their 
food-gathering, and perhaps some 
percepts with a magical meaning. 
New words were formed by doubling 
or inverting syllables or by changes 
in the pitch of some sounds. First 
mastered by one or several members

10 
ORIGINS OF SPEECH (Continued) 
of a group, they were adopted by the 
group as a whole if they supplied a 
need, and then modified by practical 
use. 
During the later Stone Age, the 
paleoanthropes or Neanderthal men 
gradually enriched their vocabulary, 
but their intellectual faculties and 
speech seem to have remained on the 
same level of isolated words. A 
major change took place at the end 
of the Stone Age, at the time of the 
fourth and final glaclal period, when 
the direct ancestors of modern man, 
(Homo sapiens), appeared, some 
50,000 to 30,000 years ago. 
The brains of these early men were 
about the same size as those of their 
predecessors, but their skull had a 
higher vault and more rounded forms, 
especially the forehead and the back 
of the head. The lower jaw was 
smaller, and the area of the muscle 
attachment was also reduced, aiding 
rapid articulation. The muscle attach- 
ments inside the lower jaw were 
also similar to those of modern man, 
while the bone on the outside had 
grown forward to form a chin. 
These Neolithic men had made 
remarkable progress in stone-cutting 
techniques. More elaborate imple- 
ments of many kinds were made, 
including bone articles and even 
needles. Ornamentation, sculpture, 
drawing and painting were also widely 
developed. The main occupation of 
these men was, of course, hunting 
wild animals. 
So far as their technology, economy 
and arts were concerned, these 
people of the last glacial period in 
Europe had a standard of living and 
way of life that were by no means 
inferior to those of certain hunting 
and food-gathering tribes still existing 
today. There is no doubt that they 
were able to form paired combinations 
of concepts and words (relating an 
action to the object of the action). 
In other words, they had fully master- 
ed articulate speech. 
The emergence of Neolithic man 
with his combination of separate 
words with different meanings ends 
the history of the origins of speech 
as a general human trait. The periods 
that followed saw the elaboration of 
different speech systems or languages 
with their own phonetic, lexical and 
grammatical structures, 
According to historical, archaeolo- 
gical and linguistic research, the great 
basic language systems emerged In 
the early Age of Metals some 6,000 to 
9,000 years ago, while the formation 
of many contemporary languages dates 
from historical times. 
Victor Bunak   
10 MAJOR CONCLUSIONS 
on the origin of Homo sapiens 
1. Recent discoveries have upset the long-accepted time scale which 
showed a modern type of man emerging at around 35,000 B.C. 
These discoveries indicate the existence of men apparently of a 
modern type, not Neanderthals, over 60,000 years ago. These men 
existed in Europe as well as in Africa, the Middle East and perhaps 
Asia. 
2. The Mousterian culture, so called from artifacts found at Le 
Moustier in south-west France and dated to between 90,000 and 
35,000 years B.C., was formerly closely linked by anthropologists 
to Neanderthal man. But Mousterian type artifacts have been found 
at such places as Qafzeh, in Israel, and were not the work of Nean- 
derthals but of a modern type of man. 
3. Prehistoric tools, etc., of a type considered to be Upper Palaeo- 
lithic, a period formerly dated from 35,000 B.C. to 8,000 B.C., have 
been found in Cyrenaica and Poland and shown, by carbon 14 dating 
methods, to date from 38,000 B.C., that is overlapping the period of 
Neanderthal man. 
4, It therefore seems certain that modern type men and Neander- 
thals coexisted for a number of years and that Upper Palaeolithic 
and Mousterian cultures overlapped in time. 
5. The transition from Middle to Upper Palaeolithic seems to have 
occurred in a number of regions. Perhaps a proportion of the 
Neanderthal population evolved to something nearer to modern man 
and there may have been groups of modern type men in various 
places whose stone industry was Mousterian to start with and later 
progressed to Upper Palaeolithic. This is called the “polycentric” 
theory. 
6. Anthropologists now seem to accept as definite that the classic 
European Neanderthal man of the type found at La Chapelle-aux- 
‘Saints, in France, must be excluded from the direct ancestry of 
modern man. 
7. It also now seems to be accepted that certain characteristics of 
“modern” man appeared separately or in various combinations at 
widely different geographical points and at differing points on the 
time scale. Fossil remains recently found at Omo, in Africa, for 
example, support this view. 
8. At the present stage of research a number of hypotheses about 
the origins of modern man are possible. 
WM According to conventional! theory, “modern” man evolved in a 
vast area comprising eastern Europe and western Asia from a non- 
specialized form of Neanderthaloid man. This theory Is known as 
"diffuse monocentrism”. 
HW Dr. Leakey, however, suggests that a split occurred in the genus 
“Homo” in the Lower Pleistocene period (some 2-3 million years ago) 
with "Pithecanthropus” and Neanderthal man. 
BM The majority of the anthropologists attending the Unesco Sympo- 
sium accept the view that polycentric evolution is the most likely 
explanation for the occurrence of fossil human populations at 
different times and places. It is not, however, maintained that all 
lines of descent contributed directly to the evolution of present 
forms of man, 
9. Proof that the early types of “modern” man and Neanderthaloid 
types are not different species may perhaps be found in the disco- 
very in the Middle East of intermediary types, perhaps resulting from 
cross-breeding. (Thoma's theory). 
10. Some anthropologists accept the idea that variations in environ- 
ment and climate played an important part in the physical and 
cultural evolution of man in regions of extreme climate. Others 
maintain that physical evolution was determined by culture rather 
than by environment. [|
