THE UNITED KINGDOM REJOINS UNESCO 
The Union Jack was hoisted outside UNESCO's Paris Headquarters on July 1 after 
a 12-year absence, at a ceremony held to mark the United Kingdom's return to the 
Organization it had helped to create half a century ago. 
Britain’s application to rejoin UNESCO had been formally unveiled in the Queen's 
traditional speech at the May 14 opening of Parliament. 
“It’s good to be back,” said Ms Clare Short, Britain’s Secretary of State for Inter- 
national Development (at left of photo), after raising the flag with Mr. Federico 
Mayor, UNESCO’s Director-General (right). She pointed out that the speed with 
which the new British Government had moved to rejoin UNESCO underlined the 
strength of its commitment to the Organization and to the United Nations system. 
“Today marks a new beginning in our relations with UNESCO,” she went on. 
“The United Kingdom has experience in education, science, culture and commu- 
nication which should be shared with Unesco. But I must emphasize that my pri- 
ority in working with the organization will be focused on the eradication of poverty 
and the education of the excluded.” 
Saluting the United Kingdom’s return as a “homecoming”, Mr. Mayor described 
the UK as “a nation summoned by its culture and traditions to contribute to UNESCO's 
constitutional purpose of advancing the objectives of peace and of the common 
welfare of humanity.”

While we were preparing this issue we often found ourselves 
thinking of the words uttered by André Malraux on 8 March 
1960, at a ceremony held at Unesco Headquarters in Paris to 
mark the launching of the first International Campaign for 
the Preservation of the Monuments of Nubia. 
Malraux's address on that occasion said admirably all 
that needed to be said about the emergence of humanity's 
new sense of responsibility for the invisible masterpieces of 
its heritage. It would have been impossible not to refer to 
this text in our introduction to the presentissue. On 
rereading it we decided it would be best to let Malraux speak 
for himself.

THE UNESCO Gourier B SEPTEMBER 1997

“... ‘Beauty’ has become one of our age’s most potent mys- 
teries, the inexplicable quality which brings the Egyptian 
masterpieces into communion with the statues of our own 
cathedrals, or the Aztec temples, or the Indian or Chinese 
grottoes; with the paintings of Cézanne and Van Gogh, with 
the greatest dead and the greatest living artists; with, in short, 
the whole treasury of the first world civilization. 
“This is an immense regeneration, of which our own 
Renaissance will soon seem a diffident pre figuring, For the first | 
time, men have discovered a universal language of art. We 
feel its influence acutely, even if we only partly understand its 
nature. This tremendous storehouse of art, of which we are 
now becoming conscious, draws its force no doubt from its

being the most signal victory of human effort over death. To 
the impregnable ‘nevermore’ that governs the history of civ- 
ilizations, this art opposes its own mysterious grandeur. 
“Of the force that brought Egypt into being out of pre- 
- historic night, nothing now remains; but the impulse which 
engendered these giants which are threatened today still 
speaks to us as clearly as the genius of the master-craftsmen 
of Chartres, or the genius of Rembrandt. The emotion we 
share with the creators of these granite statues is not even one 
of love, nor a common feeling for death—nor even, per- 
haps, a similar way of looking at their work; yet before their 
work, the accents of anonymous sculptors forgotten during 
two thousand years seem to us as much untouched by the 
succession of empires as the accents of mother love. 
“This is what brings throngs of Europeans to exhibitions 
of Mexican art; of Japanese to exhibitions of French art; and 
millions of Americans to see Van Gogh. This is why the com- 
memorative ceremonies of Rembrandt’s death were inau- 
gurated by the last kings of Europe, and the exhibition of our 
The main temple of Abu Simbel, 
one of the many Nubian 
monuments rescued from the waters 
of the Nile thanks to the 
international campaign launched by 
Unesco in 1960. 
  
* The Director-General 
of UNESCO at the time was 
Mr. Vittorino Veronese. Editor   
own stained glass by the brother of the last Asian emperor. This 
is why, Mr. Director-General®, so many sovereign names are 
associated with the appeal you are launching today. 
“One could not too highly praise your having conceived 
a plan so magnificent and so precise in its boldness—one 
might say, a kind of Tennessee Valley Authority of archae- 
ology. Itis the antithesis of the kind of gigantic exhibitionism 
by which great modern states try to outbid each other. Nor 
should the well-defined object of your scheme conceal its 
profound significance. If UNESCO is trying to rescue the 
monuments of Nubia, it is because these are in imminent 
danger; it goes without saying that it would try to save other 
great ruins—Angkor or Nara, for instance—if they were 
similarly threatened. 
“On behalf of man’s artistic heritage, you are appealing to 
the world’s conscience as others have been doing, this week, 
for the victims of the Agadir earthquake. ‘May we never 
have to choose,” you said just now, ‘between porphyry stat- 
ues and living men!” Yours is the first attempt to deploy, in 
a rescue operation, on behalf of statues, the immense 
resources usually harnessed for the service of men. And 
this is perhaps because for us the survival of statues has 
become an expression of life. 
“At the moment when our civilization divines a mysteri- 
ous transcendence in art and one of the still obscure sources of 
its unity, at the moment when we are bringing into a single, 
family relationship the masterpieces of so many civilizations 
which knew nothing of or even hated each other, you are 
proposing an action which brings all men together to defy the 
forces of dissolution. Your appeal is historic, not because it 
proposes to save the temples of Nubia, but because through 
it the first world civilization publicly proclaims the world’s art 
as its indivisible heritage. In days when the West believed its cul- 
tural heritage had its source in Athens, it could nonetheless 
look on with equanimity while the Acropolis crumbled away. 
“The slow flood of the Nile has reflected the melancholy 
caravans of the Bible, the armies of Cambyses and Alexan- 
der, the knights of Byzantium and Islam, the soldiers of 
Napoleon. No doubt when the sandstorm blows across it, 
its ancient memory no longer distinguishes the brilliant notes 
of Rameses’ triumph from the pathetic dust that settles again 
in the wake of defeated armies. And when the sand is scat- 
tered again, the Nile is once more alone with its sculpted 
mountains, its colossal effigies whose motionless reflection 
has for so long been part of its echo of eternity. 
“But see, old river, whose floods allowed astrologers to 
fix the most ancient date in history, men are coming now, 
from all parts of the world, who will carry these giants far 
away from your life-giving, destructive waters. Let the night 
fall, and you will reflect again the stars under which Isis 
accomplished her funeral rites, the star of Rameses. But the 
humblest worker come to rescue the statues of Isis and 
Rameses will tell you something you have always known 
but never heard from men before: that there is only one 
action over which indifferent stars and unchanging, mur- 
murous rivers have no sway: it is the action of a man who 
snatches something from death.” ||

### 109414: What is the world heritage?

Cultural Organization (UNESCO) 
seeks to encourage the 
identification, protection and 
preservation of cultural and 
natural heritage around the world 
considered to be of outstanding 
value to humanity. 
The idea of creating an 
international movement for 
protecting sites in other countries 
emerged after World War I, but 
the landmark event in arousing 
international concern was the 
decision to build the Aswan High 
Dam in Egypt, which would have 
flooded the valley containing the 
Abu Simbel temples, a treasure of 
ancient Egyptian civilization. In 
1959, after an appeal from the 
governments of Egypt and Sudan, 
UNESCO decided to launch an 
international campaign, and the 
Abu Simbel and Philae temples 
were dismantled, moved to dry 
ground and reassembled. 
The campaign cost about $80 
million, half of which was 
_ donated by some fifty countries, 
showing the importance of 
nations’ shared responsibility in 
conserving outstanding cultural 
sites. Its success led to other 
safeguarding campaigns, e.g. for 
Venice in Italy, Moenjodaro in 
Pakistan and Borobudur in 
Indonesia. 
Consequently, UNESCO 
initiated, with the help of the 
International Council on 
Monuments and Sites 
(ICOMOS), the preparation of a 
draft convention on the 
protection of cultural heritage. 
The idea of combining the 
conservation of cultural and 
natural sites comes from the 
United States. A White House 
Conference in Washington, D.C, 
in 1965 called for a “World 
Heritage Trust” that would 
stimulate international co- 
operation to protect “the world’s 
superb natural and scenic areas and 
historic sites for the present and 
the future of the entire world 
citizenry”. In 1968 the 
International Union for 
conservation of Nature (IUCN) 
developed similar proposals for 
its members. These proposals were 
presented to the United Nations 
Conference on Human 
Environment held in Stockholm 
(Sweden) in 1972. 
Eventually, a single text was 
agreed upon by all parties 
concerned. The Convention 
concerning the Protection of the 
World Cultural and Natural 
Heritage was adopted by the 
General Conference of UNESCO 
on 16 November 1972, 
Objectives 
The term cultural heritage 
refers to monuments, 
groups of buildings and sites with 
historical, aesthetic, 
archaeological, scientific, 
ethnological or anthropological 
value. Natural heritage refers to 
outstanding physical, biological 
and geological formations, 
habitats of threatened species of 
animals and plants and areas with 
scientific, conservation or 
aesthetic value. 
UNEscO’s World Heritage 
mission is to: 
> encourage countries to sign the 
1972 Convention and to ensure 
the protection of their natural and 
cultural heritage; 
> encourage States Parties to the 
Convention to nominate sites 
within their national territory for 
inclusion on the World Heritage 
List; 
> encourage States Parties to set 
up reporting systems on the state 
of conservation of World Heritage 
sites; 
> help States Parties safeguard 
World Heritage sites by providing 
technical assistance and 
professional training; 
> provide emergency assistance 
for World Heritage sites in 
immediate danger; 
> promote the presentation of 
cultural and natural heritage; 
> encourage international co- 
operation in conservation of 
cultural and natural heritage. 
A gift from the past to 
the future 
By signing the World 
Heritage Convention, 
countries recognize that the sites 
located on their national territory 
which have been inscribed on the 
World Heritage List, without 
prejudice to national sovereignty 
or ownership, constitute a world 
heritage “for whose protection it 
is the duty of the international 
community as a whole to co- 
operate”. 
Without the support of other 
countries, some sites with 
recognized cultural or natural 
value would deteriorate or, worse, 
disappear, often through lack of 
funding to preserve them. The 
Convention is thus an agreement, 
signed to date by 149 countries, 
to contribute the necessary 
financial and intellectual resources 
to protect World Heritage sites. 
Sites selected for World 
Heritage listing are approved on

heritage? 
the basis of their merits as the best 
possible examples of the cultural 
and natural heritage. The World 
Heritage List draws attention to 
the wealth and diversity of the 
earth’s cultural and natural heritage. 
The Convention 
The most significant 
feature of the World 
Heritage Convention is to link 
together in a single document the 
concepts of nature conservation 
and the preservation of cultural 
sites. It defines the kind of natural 
or cultural sites which can be 
considered for inscription on the 
World Heritage List, and sets out 
the duties of States Parties in 
identifying potential sites and 
their role in protecting and 
preserving them. 
A World Heritage site differs 
from a site of national heritage by 
virtue of its “outstanding universal 
value”. By signing the Convention, 
each country pledges to conserve 
not only the World Heritage sites 
situated on its territory, but also to 
protect its nationa) heritage 
whether or not it is placed on the 
World Heritage List. 
The Convention describes the 
function of the World Heritage 
Committee, how its members are 
elected and their terms of office; 
specifies the professional advisory 
bodies to which it can turn for 
advice in selecting the sites to be 
listed; and explains how the 
World Heritage Fund is to be used 
and managed and under what 
conditions international financial 
assistance may be provided. 
HOW THE CONVENTION 
WORKS 
The application for a site to be 
inscribed on the World Heritage 
List must come from the country 
itself. UNESCO makes no 
recommendations for listing, The 
application has to include a plan 
detailing how the site 1s managed 
and protected. 
The World Heritage 
Committee examines 
nominations on the basis of 
technical evaluations, provided by 
two advisory bodies, the 
International Council on 
Monuments and Sites 
(ICOMOS) and the World 
Conservation Union (IUCN). A 
third advisory body, the 
International Centre for the 
Study of the Preservation and 
Restoration of Cultural Property 
(ICCROM), provides expert 
advice on restoring monuments 
and organizes training courses. 
SELECTION CRITERIA 
To be included on the World 
Heritage List, sites must satisfy 
the selection criteria which are 
explained in a booklet entitled 
Operational Guidelines which, 
besides the text of the 
Convention, is the main working 
document on World Heritage. The 
criteria have been revised regularly 
by the Committee to match the 
evolution of the World Heritage 
concept itself. 
Cultural properties should: 
(1) represent a masterpiece of 
human creative genius, or 
(11) exhibit an important 
interchange of human values over 
a span of time or within a cultural 
area of the world, or 
developments in architecture or 
technology, monumental arts, 
town planning or landscape 
design, or 
(iit) bear a unique or at [east 
exceptional testimony to a 
cultural tradition or to a 
civilization which is living or has 
disappeared, or 
(iv) be an outstanding example of 
a type of building or architectural 
or technological ensemble, or 
landscape which illustrates a 
significant stage or significant 
stages in human history, or 
(v) be an outstanding example of a 
traditional human settlement or 
land-use which is representative of 
a culture or cultures, especially 
when it has become vulnerable 
under the impact of irreversible 
change, or 
(v1) be directly or tangibly 
associated with events or living 
traditions, with ideas or with 
beliefs, or with artistic and 
literary works of outstanding 
universal significance (a criterion 
used only in exceptional 
circumstances, and together with 
other criteria). 
Equally important is the 
authenticity of the site and the 
way it is protected and managed. 
Natural properties should: 
(i) be outstanding examples 
representing major stages of the 
carth’s history, including the 
record of life, significant ongoing 
geological processes in the 
development of landforms, or 
significant geomorphic or 
physiographic features, or 
(11) be outstanding examples 
representing significant ongoing 
ecological and biological processes 
in the evolution and development 
of terrestrial, fresh water, coastal 
and marine ecosystems and 
communities of plants and 
animals, or 
(111) contain superlative natural 
phenomena or areas of exceptional 
natural beauty and aesthetic 
importance, or 
(iv) contain the most important 
and significant natural habitats for 
in situ conservation of biological 
diversity, including those 
containing threatened species of 
outstanding universal value from 
the point of view of science or 
conservation. 
The protection, management 
and integrity of the site are also 
important considerations. 
Mixed sites have both 
outstanding natural and cultural 
values. Since 1992 significant 
interactions between people and 
the natural environment have been 
recognized as cultural landscapes. »

### 109414: What is the world heritage?

» = PROTECTION AND 
MONITORING 
World Heritage conservation is an 
ongoing process. Listing a site 
does little good if it subsequently 
falls into a state of disrepairorifa 
development project risks 
destroying the qualities that made 
the site suitable for World 
Heritage status in the first place. 
The credibility of World Heritage 
stems from countries’ regular 
reporting on the condition of 
sites, on measures taken to 
preserve them, and on their 
efforts to raise public awareness of 
cultural and natural heritage. If a 
country is not fulfilling its 
obligations under the 
Convention, it risks having its 
sites deleted from the World 
Heritage List. 
The World Heritage 
Committee will be alerted—by 
individuals, non-governmental 
organizations, or other groups— 
to possible dangers to a site. If the 
alert 1s justified, and the problem 
serious enough, the site will be 
BOOKS: 
placed on the List of World 
Heritage in Danger. This list is 
designed to call the world’s 
attention to natural or human- 
made conditions which threaten 
the characteristics for which the 
site was originally inscribed on 
the World Heritage List. 
Endangered sites on this list are 
entitled to particular attention 
and emergency action. 
In urgent cases, such as 
outbreak of war, the Committee 
will make the listing itself without 
having received a formal request. 
Funding and support 
The World Heritage 
Fund, created in 1972 by 
the Convention, receives its 
income essentially from 
compulsory contributions from 
States Parties amounting to 1 per 
cent of their UNESCO dues—and 
voluntary contributions. Other 
sources of income include funds- 
in-trust donated by countries for 
FURTHER READING 
specific purposes and profits 
derived from sales of World 
Heritage products. 
The total amount received each 
year is just under $3 million, a 
modest sum considering the 
magnitude of the task. The onus 1s 
very much on the World Heritage 
Committee to allocate funding 
according to the urgency of the 
request, which is why priority is 
necessarily given to the most 
threatened sites, including those 
listed as World Heritage in Danger. 
The World Heritage Fund 
assists the States Parties in 
identifying and preserving World 
Heritage sites. The work of 
preparation, conservation and 
preservation is expensive and not 
all requests for international 
assistance can be met from the 
World Heritage Fund. The World 
Heritage Committee applies 
stringent conditions, and requests 
have to fall into clearly defined 
categories: preparatory assistance, 
technical co-operation, emergency 
assistance, and training.

### 109414: What is the world heritage?

A portion of the World 
Heritage Fund is allocated to 
States Parties on their request to 
help them prepare periodic 
reports on the condition of listed 
sites. These reports, prepared ona 
voluntary basis, are a crucial part 
of World Heritage conservation. 
They enable the Committee to 
assess the conditions of the sites 
and facilitate its decision-making. 
The reports also make possible the 
development of specific training 
and other programmes aimed at 
resolving recurrent problems in 
site conservation. 
Another essential task is 
building awareness about the 
World Heritage Convention and 
its aims. This takes two forms: 
promoting the World Heritage 
concept, with information for the 
general public or specific interest 
groups, and developing teaching 
programmes and educational 
materials for use in schools and 
universities. The two are 
complementary, since materials 
produced for promotion can also 
be used for education. 
Who does what? 
The General Assembly 
includes all States Parties to the 
Convention. It meets once every 
two years during the ordinary 
session of UNESCO’s General 
Conference to elect the World 
Heritage Committee, to examine 
the statement of accounts of the 
World Heritage Fund and decide 
on major policy issues. 
The World Heritage Committee 
is responsible for the 
implementation of the World 
Heritage Convention and has the 
final say on whether a site is 
accepted for inscription on the 
World Heritage List. It also 
examines reports on the state of 
conservation of listed sites, and 
asks States Parties to take action 
when sites are not being properly 
managed. The Committee is also 
responsible for allocating finance 
from the World Heritage Fund 
for sites in need of repair or 
restoration, for emergency action 
if sites are in immediate danger, 
for providing technical assistance 
and training, and for promotional 
and educational activities. The 
Committee, which meets in 
December each year, consists of 
representatives from 21 of the 
States Parties to the Convention. 
Members are elected during the 
UNEsco General Conference for 
six-year terms of office. Seven 
members of the Committee make 
up the World Heritage Bureau, a 
smaller executive body that 
prepares the work of the 
Committee. 
Js 
was set up in 1992 to assure the 
day-to-day management of the 
Convention. It organizes the 
annual sessions of the Bureau and 
Committee, provides advice to 
States Parties in the preparation of 
site nominations, organizes 
technical assistance upon request, 
and co-ordinates both reporting 
on the condition of sites and the 
emergency action undertaken 
when a site is threatened. It is also 
responsible for the 
administration of the World 
Heritage Fund. Other tasks of the 
Centre include arranging technical 
seminars and workshops, 
updating the World Heritage List 
and database, developing teaching 
materials to raise awareness of the 
World Heritage concept, and 
keeping the public informed of 
World Heritage issues. It co- 
operates with other groups 
working on issues related to 
conservation both within 
UNEsCO—notably the Cultural 
Heritage Division in the Sector 
for Culture, and the Division of 
Ecological Sciences in the Science 
Sector—and on the outside, 
notably the three Advisory 
Bodies (ICOMOS, IUCN, 
ICCROM), and other 
international organizations such 
as the Organization of World 
Heritage Cities (OWHC) and the 
International Council of 
Museums (ICOM). [|

On 16 November 1997 we celebrate the twenty-fifth 
anniversary of the adoption by UNESco’s General Con- 
ference of the Convention concerning the Protection of the 
World Cultural and Natural Heritage. Today the Conven- 
tion has been ratified by 149 States Parties, which makes it 
the most universal international legal instrument in the field 
of heritage conservation. The anniversary is an opportu- 
nity to reflect on, and critically review, its implementation. 
The Convention is uniquely founded on the premise that 
certain natural and cultural sites are of “outstanding uni- 
versal value” and form part of the common heritage of 
humankind. The conservation of this common heritage is 
of concern not just for individual nations, but for all human- 
ity. Another unique feature of the Convention is the fact that 
it secks to protect both cultural and natural heritage. In view 
of the many linkages between people and their environment, 
this holistic approach is both logical and revolutionary. 
The Convention is also remarkable in that it has helped 
to establish systematic international co-operation in the realm 
of conservation. Every year the 21-member intergovern- 
mental World Heritage Committee approves funding for 
emergency conservation assistance to World Heritage sites 
under threat, to support co-operative conservation activities 
at World Heritage sites around the world, for conservation 
training, and for preparatory work on nominations of cultural 
and natural sites for inclusion on the World Heritage List. 
So far, 506 sites of outstanding universal value have been 
included on the List. Of these sites, 380 are cultural, 107 are 
natural, and 19 are mixed cultural and natural sites. They are 
located in 107 States Parties. Despite efforts to ensure a more 
balanced and representative World Heritage List, it is still 
heavily weighted towards the monumental and religious 
architecture of Western Europe. In future years more sites 
from the Arab States, from the Pacific and from Africa 
should be added to the List. 
Part of this heritage is now threatened and consider- 
able ingenuity and resourcefulness are required to ensure its 
continued survival. The challenges are ever increasing. The 
World Heritage Committee has included on the List of 
World Heritage in Danger 22 sites under extreme threat 
and in need of special conservation actions. There is also 
growing concern about the state of conservation of four 
sites in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and of the 
archaeological site of Butrinti in Albania. 
Military and civil conflicts, the growth of mass tourism 
and uncontrolled and ill-advised development are among 
the factors that make it difficult to protect the extraordi- 
nary natural and cultural sites that constitute our World 
Heritage. In this the twenty-fifth year of the World Heritage 
Convention let us recall the splendour of this common her- 
itage and participate, individually and collectively, in pro- 
tecting it for the centuries to come, |

A | ing their own traces makes the preser- 
h vation of the world heritage a duty 
1 Y owed to memory. At a time when 
remembrance of things past is becoming an 
industry, an instrument of power, the profu- 
sion of images and information flowing in from 
all over the world makes our selection of them 
ever more arbitrary. This, paradoxically, helps to 
confuse our standards of judgment and weaken 
appreciation of our cultural diversity. 
And yet it would seem that socicties have 
never felt greater curiosity about each others’ 
ways of life and, especially in the wealthy 
countries, about great monuments, places rich 
in historical associations, the arts, and those 
crafts, traditions and customs of distant pco- 
ples thatare a heaven-sent boon for the tourist 
industry. 
In Western societies, it is true, the serious 
exploration of other cultures, at first the pre- 
serve of certain categories such as ethnologists, 
historians, archaeologists and a well-heeled 
elite of travellers, has long been a fact of life.

> put the art and culture of those regions in a 
historical perspective, although they have had 
for a century a strong hold on the Western 
imagination. 
It was not until the United Nations was set 
up and many new countries achieved inde- 
pendence that UNESCO’s work led to the emer- 
gence of the notion of a world cultural heritage 
as a manifestation of the equal dignity of all 
cultures and to acceptance of the idea that the 
international community as a whole had a 
duty to preserve that heritage. 
The first thing that had to be done was to 
draw up a list of that heritage, to display to 
humanity at large evidence of the splendour of 
all its component parts. The next step was to 
explain the background situation, making it 
clear that there were all sorts of dangers from 
which it was essential to safeguard the world 
heritage—not only age and neglect but also 
war and the destructive fury of those who 
deny other cultures, past or present, the right 
to exist. Other, no less serious, threats that at 
present hang over the heritage include indus- 
trial pollution and the feeding frenzy of prop-

erty developers that is eating away at the 
world’s major tourist sites. 
W The non-material heritage 
As deeper thought has been given to the 
world’s different cultures, it has come to be 
realized that not all of them found material 
expression in major works, and that a whole 
area of humanity’s cultural heritage is invisible 
because it resides in the human mind. For this 
reason, some cultures such as those of the 
nomadic peoples of North America or the 
steppes of Eurasia who for the most part pro- 
duced only small artifacts, long went 
unrecorded. It should also be said that, pace 
Malraux, the production of everyday articles, 
clothing, domestic utensils and so on is nota 
matter of reproduction, not involving the 
kind of creativity that goes into the art pro- 
duced for the court or for religious celebra- 
tions, but embodies a universe of signs that do 
not need to be ostentatious in order to carry 
meaning. 
Nor can the cultural heritage of any given 
society be reduced to its material forms. This 
question first arose in relation to societies 
whose lore and skills, as well as the memory of 
their ancestors, were concentrated in the oral 
tradition. It thus came to be understood that 
the patrimony of any culture is not only an 
inheritance from the past but also preserves, 
through changing circumstances, some of its 
most lasting models and points of reference. 
The concept of a non-material heritage thus 
merges into that of culture as “the whole com- 
plex of spiritual, material, intellectual and emo- 
tional features that characterize a society or 
social group” and which “includes not only 
the arts and letters but also ways of life, the

fundamental rights of the human being, value 
systems, traditions and beliefs”. 
The force of change 
To this definition, which came out of the Mex- 
ico City World Conference on Cultural Poli- 
cies (1982), should be added that which, in 
each culture, explains its dynamism, the force 
of change within it, and the importance of 
the influences it undergoes and the intercul- 
tural exchanges in which it participates, not 
forgetting the changes that all cultures are expe- 
riencing today as a result of the worldwide 
spread of a global model of development!. 
Whereas daily life in “modern” societies is 
supposed to be governed solely by the tastes 
and wishes of individuals (it being considered 
inappropriate for the authorities or the wider 
community to interfere in such matters), pri- 
vate life in traditional societies is strongly 
influenced by the community’s rules. It may 
be true that few purely traditional societies 
still exist, but of those that do, many are still 
far removed from the models of social and 
cultural behaviour that the elites of the coun-

How France 
became aware 
of its heritage 
14 r 
4 THE UNESCO Courier B SEPTEMBER 1997 
n the last twenty years or so, the concept 
of “heritage” has expanded—or rather 
exploded—to the point where it has 
become transformed!. Thus, while older 
dictionaries define it primarily as that which is 
passed on, e.g. from parents to children, a more 
recent definition refers also to “the evidence of 
the past... considered collectively as the inher- 
itance of present-day society "2. 
In France, this idea grew up around that of 
the “historic monument”, itself a notion inher- 
ited from the French Revolution3. It acquired 
official status in the early 1830s and was then 
given a legal definition by a system of listing and 
preservation that was voted into law in 1913. 
Historic monuments, the Roman aqueduct 
known as the Pont du Gard, for instance, or 
Chartres cathedral, were seen as irrefutable evi- 
dence of an ever-present past, acknowledged as

such by the nation and therefore designated as 
representative of the national identity. 
This state-run, centralized system of “list- 
ing” monuments, which in fact amounted to 
a takeover by the public authorities, survived 
with various ups and downs until the mid- 
1970s 4. Then the deluge began, with the emer- 
gence of an ethnological and rural heritage. A 
significant event in this connection was the 
opening, in 1967, of the Museum of Popular 
Arts and Traditions in Paris. Since then, the 
ground covered by the concept of the heritage 
has constantly expanded in three major direc- 
tions: to include the contemporary, in response 
to the interest in industrial archaeology and 
the nineteenth century in general, an aware- 
ness of which was stimulated by the demoli- 
tion of Les Halles, the covered food markets 
built by Victor Baltard in Paris in the middle

years of that century; to take in the daily life 
of bygone times, the evidence of a world—of 
dances, songs, cookery and crafts—that was 
swept away forever by the winds of change in 
the years between the late 1940s and the mid- 
1970s (corresponding to what French econo- 
mist Jean Fourastié has called the “Thirty Glo- 
rious Years of Growth”); and to embrace the 
non-artistic and non-historic—the natural her- 
itage, the heritage of science and technology 
and that of traditions and folklore. 
 Asilent transition 
This snowballing of the concept has entailed 
enormous psychological and financial invest- 
ment in the economy and in tourism. It has 
been accompanied by a silent but decisive tran- 
sition from “national history” to “national 
memory”, i.e. from a historical to a social aware- 
ness of the nation. In concrete terms, this shift 
reflects a kind of emancipation, or perhaps it 
would be better to say an “internal decolo- 
nization”, of such sub-groups within society 
as manual workers, provincials (Corsicans or 
Bretons, for example), women or Jews who, 
because they are becoming more and more 
fully integrated into the nation as a whole, 
have a heightened awareness of their past and 
regard every item of evidence of that pastas an 
indispensable pointer to their identity. 
This change is well illustrated by the recent 
emergence and proliferation of what in France 
are known as “museums of society ”—a pipe 
museum and a clog museum, for instance— 
which aim to preserve the memory of a par- 
ticular industry or local products. The her- 
itage 1s no longer simply the representation 
of an idea held by society as a whole. It increas- 
ingly tends to be linked to the identity of a 
Ndi a LLP TALES 
hg mr "i 
given sector within society, a social group that 
demands to be recognized and registered as 
“national” and that has ceased to perceive itself 
in cultural terms alone. 
This exponential growth in the area covered 
by the concept of the heritage clearly reflects a 
thoroughgoing democratization process and a 
constant proliferation of the forms in which it 
finds expression. Crucial as it is, this change lends 
itself to a linear explanation as the logical cul- 
mination of one of those long-term movements 
that art historians have taught us to decipher’. 
This movement could be seen as a stage- 
by-stage process, with first the establishment 
of a religious heritage (the Church’s relics and 
treasures), followed by an aristocratic one 
(stately homes, weapons, textiles) and next 
the heritage of monarchs and scholars, itself 
scholarly in character, with its libraries, its 
manuscripts and its histories of religious 
orders. Then came the decisive stage, from the 
confiscation of Church property at the time of 
the Revolution to the establishment, under 
the July Monarchys, of major institutions 
concerned with the heritage. It was at this stage 
that the concept of heritage really came into 
being, i.e. that of property not in use for its 
original purpose but acquiring a totally dif- 
ferent kind of use by virtue of its antiquity, 
and it was also at this stage that the nation 
would provide the frame of reference for the 
“togetherness” of the community. This stage 
was continued into, or rather brought to ful- 
filment in, its successor, when the idea of the 
“national” still prevailed but was regulated 
and given a civic, republican character. This in 
turn led to, and achieved fruition in, interna- 
tional organizations such as the League of 
Nations and UNESCO, which have done so

much to disseminate the global concept of 
heritage. Thus we have come to the democra- 
tic, community-based, psychologically sig- 
nificant heritage as we know it today. 
W An aura of sanctity 
May we then conclude that awareness of the 
heritage has progressed uninterruptedly? In 
point of fact, as we well know, quite different 
factors are involved in the present runaway 
expansion of the heritage. It is taking us over 
a threshold and into a new set of circumstances. 
We have moved on from a heritage simply 
handed down to us to a symbolic heritage 
linked with the notion of identity, from a 
visible and material heritage to an invisible and 
non-material heritage, and from a state- 
controlled heritage to a social, ethnic and com- 
munity-based heritage. To borrow the lan- 
guage of relativity theory, we have moved from 
a “special” heritage system to a “general” one, 
in other words from the age of heritage as his- 
tory to that of heritage as memory®. 
In this process, the nature and status of 
the heritage have changed. The heritage now 
belongs to the same constellation of ideas as 
memory, identity and culture, and in demo- 
cratic societies has become the secular equiva- 
lent of sanctity. 
All countries, whether democratic or not, 
are feeling this increasingly powerful concern 
for their cultural property, the only differ- 
ences being in rates of progress, in degrees of

urgency and in the vocabulary employed. The 
example of France is valid because it makes the 
evolution of the concept particularly easy to 
follow for two major reasons. 
The first of these reasons derives from the 
close relationship established by the Enlight- 
enment between the ideas of the nation and of 
civilization, the nation’s existence being justi- 
fied by the fact that itis the vehicle of progress 
and the instrument of civilization. At the water- 
shed of the French Revolution, the preservation 
of the monuments of the ancien régime and of 
the achievements of civilization were thus pro- 
moted with equal vigour. The French politi- 
cian and historian Francois Guizot may rightly 
be seenasakey figure in this respect: in his His- 
tory of Civilization in Europe, he saw the intel- 
lectual merit of the Restauration10 as residing in 
“the reawakening of appreciation of France’s * 
ancient monuments”. 
The second of these reasons derives from 
the long history of state power in France and 
its centralizing, Jacobin tradition, which, via 
a forceful national conservation policy, has 
made the recent transition to cultural and com- 
munity-based conservation all the more strik- 
ing. A kind of “French model” may thus be 
discerned within the overall evolution of the 
heritage conceptl!l. This is not so surprising, 
since in the French language the very word for 
“heritage” —patrimoine—contains within 
itself, for better or worse, the word patrie— 
“homeland”. [|

### 109417: Cultural landscapes

tinuing mix of nature and culture, landscapes 
differ from other World Heritage sites in sev- 
eral ways. They are by their very nature exten- 
sive, occupying more terrain than sites devoted 
purely to the built heritage. While some cul- 
tural landscapes are selected for their spectac- 
ular uniqueness, many are even more treasured 
as representative, embodying qualities that 
typify human impress over sizeable regions, 
even over subcontinental areas. Whereas built 
heritage sites are generally chosen as master- 
pieces and repositories of high art, landscapes 
tend to have a broader, more universal appeal. 
WA vast mosaic 
These traits make it hard to decide which land- 
scape sites to select for inscription. Landscape 
boundaries are difficult to circumscribe, land- 
scape features multiform and fluid, ever evolv-

ing, and subject to periodic change. Every land- 
scape Is unique. Butit is their representativeness, 
rather than their uniqueness, that makes most 
landscapes globally important. Yet to select for 
global recognition even a sample of the world’s 
representative landscapes, let alone to demar- 
cate, describe, and protect them, would be 
impracticable if not impossible. Landscapes 
already listed or in process of being so are, in 
truth, tokens of a much larger assemblage of 
sites that deserve attention and care. 
WA difficult choice 
Today cultural landscapes are widely cherished. 
But their widespread appeal raises another 
problem of selection. Can we envisage how 
the inscription of a relatively small number 
of landscapes “of universal value” will affect all 
the rest? Unhappily, the listing of a few, 
whether chosen as uniquely spectacular or as 
ideally representative, now sometimes signals 
to governments and entrepreneurs that they 
are at liberty to do as they wish with any land- 
scape not on the list, and hence deemed to be 
of lesser aesthetic, historical, and social import. 
Yet the most modest locales embody pro- 
found meaning for folk indigenous to or 
otherwise familiar with them. And routes 
linking particular places—the pilgrim tracks 
of medieval Christians; the desert pathways, 
invisible to others, of Australian Aborigines; 
the trails of such explorers as Lewis and Clark 
in the American West—likewise enshrine essen- 
tial memories. 
In short, in cherishing some landscapes we 
must endeavour to treat them not as the only 
locales worth conserving, but as tokens rep- 
resentative of much of the rich diversity of 
the entire globe. A sense of connection with all 
these peopled and storied places enriches and 
humanizes life the world over. 
% Universal appeal 
Heritage today is increasingly seen not merely 
as the property of individual states but as the 
rightful legacy of all humankind. Of no aspects 
of heritage is this more true than of its land- 
scapes. Not only are landscapes no respecters of 
political boundaries; their inherent worth 
applies alike to natives and to those who love 
them—and often visit them—from afar. 
Indeed, the world’s most famed landscapes 
have achieved their fame largely through the »

devoted study, delineation, and stewardship of 
foreign artists and savants. 
Indeed, experience suggests that the uni- 
versal appeal of landscapes particularly com- 
mends them to global care. Insofar as they are 
in large measure the creations of nature, how- 
ever much altered and improved by human 
occupation, they are less vulnerable to nation- 
alist exclusivity than are purely cultural sites 
and relics. It is often the case that landscapes 
perceived as of universal value have been pro- 
tected by concerns voiced internationally. For 
example, designation by UNESCO enabled the 
  
  
Australian government to rescue the south- 
western Tasmanian temperate rainforest, along 
with its archaeological traces, from destruc- 
tive development. 
Just as all the peoples of the world depend 
for their physical survival on the shared man- 
agement of the global environment, so does 
their spiritual well-being require responsible 
stewardship of global landscapes. Such land- 
scapes enrich those who admire them from afar, 
those who may indeed never visit but only 
envisage them, no less than those for whom 
they are local or national homelands. |

BY JACQUES RIGAUD m 
Arelationship

ups and downs 
as well as some 
surprising 
moments of 
harmony 
he problem of reconciling the safe- 
guarding of cultural sites of historic 
interest with the creation of a new, vital 
architecture is one that is peculiar to our 
own times. For centuries, indeed for thousands 
of years, buildings of various kinds were erected 
in a medley of styles without any thought 
being given to respect for the past. While the 
attraction of some sites lies in their homo- 
geneity and harmony, the Place des Vosges in 
Paris, for instance, the Piazza del Campidoglio 
in Rome or the Campo in Siena, the charm of 
many cities such as Prague, Venice, Naples or 
Rome resides precisely in the way that a wide 
variety of buildings stand there side by side. 
The fact that such contrasts fail to shock 
us may perhaps be due to our awareness that, 
behind the appearance of dissimilarity, theres 
an underlying unity to the architectural her- 
itage. Weare conscious that, between the Doric 
column and the buildings of Andrea Palladio or 
Christopher Wren, between the Roman basil- 
ica, Istanbul’s Hagia Sophia and Romanesque 
art, and between the Pantheon, St Peter’s in 
Rome and St Paul’s Cathedral in London, there 
are just as many ties of kinship and continuity 
as thereare breaks in tradition. However much 
they may differ or even clash, the successive 
styles somehow fit in with one another and 
get along together. It is worth remembering »

changes which aesthetic factors alone cannot 
fully explain. Industrial, urban civilization 
has profoundly altered the design and struc- 
ture of towns as well as construction tech- 
niques and materials. 
Changing attitudes 
The results have been twofold: on the one 
hand, the wholesale destruction of monu- 
ments and sites at the very time when a con- 
sciousness of the heritage—at first concerned 
only with preserving major buildings of sym- 
bolic significance—was emerging; and on the 
other, the untimely onslaught of materials 
and forms that clashed with those of the 
past—steel, concrete and glass giving birth to 
aradically different kind of architecture, con- 
trasting utterly with the buildings that have 
come down to us from former times. 
It is for this reason that several opposing 
attitudes are represented in the modern 
approach to this issue. One consists in regard - 
ing certain sites, monuments or groups of 
buildings as sacrosanct and not tolerating any 
visible assertion of modernity. This is the case 
with the chateau of Versailles and with some 
cities that were destroyed by war, such as War- 
saw, Nuremberg or Rouen, and have been 
rebuilt as faithful copies of their old selves. 
Another attitude is to advocate a type of con- 
struction that is in keeping with, or even a » 
High-rise buildings in San Francisco (U.S.A).

pastiche of, that which already exists. A third, 
conversely, is openly in favour of a dialogue 
between past and present buildings. There 1s, 
unfortunately, a fourth attitude, which I have 
no hesitation in calling indifferent or igno- 
rant and which is the one that has done the 
greatest harm to certain grand urban vistas, as 
in the case of Brussels, London and Paris. 
W Contrasting styles 
The deliberate confrontation of ancient and 
modern can come in various forms. The new 
building can be discreetly fitted in: the audi- 
ence chamber created for Paul VI in the Vati- 
can by Pier Luigi Nervi is uncompromisingly 
modern in form but crouches in the shadow 
of St Peter’s without having the slightest detri- 
mental effect on that august site. By contrast, 
while the Pompidou Centre makes an assertive 
statement in the heart of old Paris, its pro- 
portions are in keeping with those of the 
buildings massed around it, and the piazzain 
front of it provides a smooth transition 
between it and its surroundings at the same 
time as being a successful urban space. Another, 
less controversial, example in France is Norman 
Foster’s Carré d’art in Nimes. It faces the 
Roman temple known as the Maison carrée, 
but far fom overwhelming it, seems to con- 
verse with it across two thousand years. In 
Germany, the Ludwig-Wallraf museums at 
the foot of Cologne cathedral do not flaunt 
2 4 he unesco (COURIER m sErTEMBER 1997 
  
themselves in any such face-to-face encounter, 
but give the impression that they were 
designed with this juxtaposition in mind. 
The case of the Pei pyramid in the fore- 
court of the Louvre is a more subtle one. Clas- 
sical in form, it might appear, though func- 
tional, to be incongruous in such a setting, 
but in fact its metal and glass construction, 
all reflections and transparencies, lends a bold 
and at the same time unassuming new touch to 
the classical facades of the palace. The same 
architect was successful in harmoniously inte- 
grating a new wing into the National Gallery 
in Washington. On another level, certain sen- 
sitively-sited major civil engineering projects 
such as the Golden Gate Bridge in San Fran- 
cisco or the Pont de Normandie in the Seine 
estuary manage to blend in admirably, thanks 
to the elegance and refinement of their forms. 
In the past, the juxtaposition of styles may 
have been a happy coincidence. In our own 
times a construction in a contrasting style 
runs the serious risk of affronting the eye and 
striking a discordant note—unless, that is, the 
juxtaposition is carefully thought out and 
modern architects, for all their boldness, show 
themselves willing to accept with a kind of 
humility the constraints imposed by the pres- 
ence of such prestigious and awe-inspiring 
neighbours. If they do this, there is every 
chance that posterity will be grateful to them 
for enriching the heritage of the centuries. HB

They may be in bad condition or have been 
radically altered; in some cases they are associ-

On the eve of the new millennium, it is 
high time to regard twentieth century archi- 
tecture as part of our heritage and to protect 
it. Fortunately, interest in this new category is 
growing, as shown by a number of recent 
nominations for the World Heritage List.

As of today the List contains properties in 108

Its rapid expansion was made possible by col-

whose international congresses were attended 
by architects and town planners, and by mag-

The international figures associated with 
the Bauhaus also played an important role in the

use of a curtain-glass-wall and its wealth of 
carefully designed interior and exterior details 
(including furnishings and colouring), the 
white plastered building built by Walter

(Gesammtkunstwerk) and a characteristic exam-

and rationalism and tried wholeheartedly to

### 109600: In youthful hands

IN YOUTHFUL HANDS 
by Ingunn Kvistergy 
Are you good-natured, respectful and respected, humble, tolerant, courageous, unselfish, con- 
fident, educated, dynamic, reasonable, diplomatic, intelligent and young in mind and body? 
If you are all of these things, then why not become a “Patrimonito”—a young heritage 
guardian—and take part in Unesco’s Young People’s Participation in World Heritage Preser- 
vation and Promotion project? 
Patrimonito—the name is the diminutive of the Spanish word for “heritage"—is a smik- 
ing cartoon character designed on the basis of the World Heritage logo to symbolize young 
people's involvement in heritage preservation. He was invented by Spanish-speaking par- 
ticipants in a media workshop organized during the first global World Heritage Youth Forum, 
held in June 1995 in Bergen (Norway). And because Patrimonito is a catchy-sounding word, 
it—and he—was enthusiastically adopted by other language groups at the Forum. By the time 
a regional World Heritage Youth Forum was held a year later at Victoria Falls (Zimbabwe), 
Patrimonito had really caught on. 
The idea behind his creation originated in 1994. After working closely with leading 
architects, archaeologists, jurists and historians from many countries, Unesco felt that the 
time had come to get young people involved in protecting the World Heritage. Twenty-five coun- 
tries worldwide were invited to take part. Unesco proposed a challenging task. The countries 
were invited to run projects, teach history, geography, science, religion, language and lit- 
erature from a World Heritage point of view, organize visits to sites and museums and use 
the students’ creative potential in the arts. 
After that first year teacher and student representatives of the twenty-five countries 
were invited to attend the Bergen Youth Forum and swap their experiences. 
Both students and teachers handed out plenty of advice to Unesco on the development 
of its World Heritage Education (WHE) project, and Unesco adjusted its programme accord- 
ingly. In the next two years efforts were made to involve more countries in the scheme, 
regional gatherings for participating students and teachers were held and produced regional 
action plans, and WHE teaching materials were developed to cover such issues as identity, 
peace, environmental questions and tourism. 
In 1986 two regional forums were held, one in Dubrovnik (Croatia), the other at Victo- 
na Falls (Zimbabwe). Encouraging students and teacher trainers to become involved, pro- 
viding WHE teaching materials, organizing youth forums and strengthening national capac- 
ities are part of an overall strategy that links Unesco’s standard-setting and instrumental roles. 
Itis helping to provide young people with the knowledge, skills, attitudes and commitment 
to preserve World Heritage for future generations. |

inition of the cultural and natural her- 
itage enshrined in Article 1 of the 
Convention. This definition is amplified by 
the criteria sct forth in a booklet entitled 
“Operational Guidelines for the Implemen- 
tation of the World Heritage Convention”. 
To some extent the indivisibility of nature 
makes it easy to choose “natural” sites. “Cul- 
tural” sites are another matter. The Convention 
is open to all the world’s cultures and civi- 
lizations, and this allows for considerable lat- 
itude in the interpretation of the definition 
and the criteria. 
According to the Convention, “the follow- 
ing shall be considered as ‘cultural heritage”: 
« monuments: architectural works, works 
of monumental sculpture and painting, ele- 
ments or structures of an archaeological nature, 
inscriptions, cave dwellings and combinations 
of features, which are of outstanding univer- 
sal value from the point of view of history, art 
Or science; 
= groups of buildings: groups of separate or 
connected buildings which, because of their 
architecture, their homogeneity or their place 
in the landscape, are of outstanding universal 
value from the point of view of history, art or 
science; 
& sites: works of man or the combined 
works of naturc and of man, and areas includ- 
ing archaeological sites which are of out- 
standing universal value from the historical, 
aesthetic, ethnological or anthropological 
points of view.” 
The Convention thus takes into consider- 
ation a wide range of possible cases, monu- 
mental and otherwise, but when it comes 
down to it, “monumentalism” and “acsthet- 
ics” often take precedence over the significance 
of a given site. As one ethnologist has written,

“What justification is there for allowing aes- 
thetic and museological criteria, which are 
always extraneous, to take precedence over the 
obvious fact, which can furthermore be veri- 
fied by looking at the way local societies func- 
tion on an everyday basis, that a ‘nasty’ pile of 
mud coated with dried blood, sticky feathers 
and broken eggshells often constitutes a 
‘fetish’ more powerful—and doubtless no less 
rich in spiritual significance—than a superb 
statue which we regard as ‘artistic’?” For 
whom do we make listings and what criteria 
do we use?

An answer to these questions emerges from 
a statistical reading of requests for inscription 
on the World Heritage List, and subsequent 
acceptances and rejections. Rather than 
strengthening the universality and unity of 
the world, the current trend tends to mag- 
nify a certain division between countries. There 
are those which can claim to contribute to 
universality—and the number of their sites 
included on the List proves it (see Table 1).

there has been a striking preponderance of sites

The church of St. Basil the 
Blessed, below, is one of the 
finest examples of Russian 
Orthodox architecture. It was 
built between 1555 and 1560 
at the foot of the Kremlin in 
Moscow (Russian Federation) 
by the Russian architects 
Barma and Postnik. The 
Kremlin and Red Square, 
Moscow, were added to the 
World Heritage List as a 
cultural site in 1990.

preponderance, which diminished in relative 
terms between 1984 and 1989, has again been 
increasing since 1990. Since 1992, the increase in 
listed European sites has continued, and has’ 
actually become more noticeable because of a 
slowdown in listing for the other regions. 
Between 1992 and 1996, 54 per cent of all 
sites nominated and not added to the List 
were European, as were 59 per cent of the sites 
listed during the same period. European coun- 
tries thus submit more nominations than all 
the other regions put together and also garner 
more listings than they do. Table 2 clearly 
illustrates this trend. 
There are several reasons for this growing 
imbalance. Firstly, the criteria for inclusion on 
the list are interpreted in a special way: monu- 
mentality or visible representativity are regarded 
as self-evident criteria. These qualities are less 
easily perceived in a cultural site in the Pacific 
region than in a Greek or Roman site. 
But other reasons are to be found 
upstream. Thirty-seven UNESCO Member 
States have still not adhered to the Conven- 
tion—including fifteen from Africa south of 
the Sahara, nine from Asia and the Pacific (eight 
Pacific islands), six from Latin America and 
the Caribbean, four from the Arab States and 
three only from the European region. 
Before a site can be nominated for inscrip- 
tion on the World Heritage List, it must 
already feature on its country’s national inven- 
tory of heritage properties, which is itself 
deposited with the Convention Secretariat 
according to a set formula. Nomination 
dossiers, which have been improved since the 
early years of the Convention, are becoming 
increasingly complex and call for information 
which is increasingly difficult to provide. Their 
preparation calls for technical skills and admin- 
istrative capacities that are not everywhere avail- 
able. This penalizes the developing countries. 
For several years, efforts have been made 
by the Committee and the Secretariat to help

these countries to make their national inven- 
tories, but the impact of these efforts is lim- 
ited, on the one hand by the conditions nec- 
essary for protection and conservation, on the 
other by the difficulty of applying criteria of 
authenticity, representativity and universal- 
ity to physical representations produced by 
minority civilizations and cultures. 
The big gap between the amounts allocated 
by the Committee and the amounts of 
approved requests (see Table 3) is bewilder- 
ing. At the beginning of June almost $220,000 
(over 70 per cent of the available amount) were 
left for preparatory assistance, and the rate of 
use of the total approved by the Committee 
is 37.1 per cent. While the Convention should 
be rigorously implemented, it should not 
become an instrument of exclusion or divi- 
sion. New, increased resources should be 
deployed to obviate this risk. | 
Between the mid-10th and the carly 14th centuries a 
magnificent series of temples were built at Khajuraho 
(Madhya Pradesh state, central India), a capital of the 
Chandella Rajput dynasty. Around 20 have survived. This 
group of monuments, a cultural site added to the World 
Heritage List in 19886, constitutes an outstanding synthesis 
of the architecture and ornamental carving of its period. 
Right, the temple of Visvanatha.

### 109421: The North-South gap

the  Jorth- Jou gap 
he South and the North face different 
problems and defend different interests 
when protecting and presenting sites 
included on the World Heritage List. 
In the North, a variety of organizations 
hope that the state will protect listed sites 
against the encroachments of tourism. The 
countries of the South, on the other hand, 
hope that inscription on the List will make 
“their sites better known, attract more visitors 
and generate more tourist revenue. 
Other problems arise in East European 
countries where economies dominated for 
decades by the state are in the throes of transi- 
tion to the market economy. These countries are 
creating models of privatization without his- 
torical precedent. In this context, some orga- 
nizations of civil society are doing all they can 
to obtain stronger state guarantees for the pro- 
tection of cultural and natural treasures, while 
others are calling on the state to relax its influ- 
ence and control. Lack of funds is complicating 
matters further. In this situation, sale to foreign 
buyers sometimes seems to be unavoidable. 
The practice of selling off certain national 
properties seems to be gaining ground every- 
where, raising the question that in the long 
term it may weaken the fabric of national life. 
These properties must be given legal protec- 
tion. But here too, the answers given differ 
under different systems of governance. In the 
North attempts are made to draw up legal reg- 
ulations that are both detailed and global in

Yellowstone National Park

scope, whereas in the South the trend is to 
guarantee certain basic rights. These two atti- 
tudes are difficult to reconcile. Let us take the 
example of two national parks. 
Yellowstone Park (United States) attracts 
so many tourists that in 1995 the World Her- 
itage Committee put the Park on the list of 
World Heritage in Danger. But is radically 
reducing the number of visitors the best solu- 
tion? It would mean that only 2 minority of 
privileged people would have access to this 
natural treasure. What about the rest? Would 
they have to make do with photos, films, the 
Internet, virtual reality? 
How can we accept discrimination between 
a minority with the opportunity to enjoy 
direct experience of sites of universal value and 
the overwhelming majority which would be 
excluded from this experience? 
The Virunga animal reserve, on the border 
between Rwanda and the former Zaire, is a 
national park which has been invaded by starv- 
ing refugees from the Rwandan tragedy. Guards 
protecting the wild animals against poachers 
have wondered whether they should use their 
weapons against starving people to protect ani- 
mals belonging to endangered species or whether 
they should help the refugees to capture them. 
The author has no casy answer. But he 
would like to believe that the collective wis- 
dom of international organizations, based on 
freedom and solidarity, will make it possible 
to find solutions. |

an outstanding example of

complex and elaborate. 
W BY MARGARETA BIORNSTAD 
J" 7 hen asite is placed on the World 
\" Heritage List, that is not the end 
/ of the story. If it is to stay on the 
List, the characteristics and qualities 
that justified its inscription must be preserved. 
This means monitoring not only changes 
that directly affect listed monuments and sites 
but also changes in their management and 
upkeep. Knowledge derived from monitor- 
ing is the necessary basis for a dialogue between 
national heritage authorities and UN1sco. The 
chief beneficiaries of such a process arc the 
managers and other professionals who shoul- 
der the day-to-day responsibilities for world 
heritage sites. [tis they who are, or should be, 
the most closely involved in discussions about 
monitoring. 
Managing a world heritage property is an 
ever-changing task that calls not only for spe- 
cial knowledge of the site but for awareness of 
what is going on around it and in society at 
large. Site managers must always be ready to 
cope with new situations such as the intro- 
duction of facilities for tourists, changes in 
land-use or threats from pollution from indus- 
trial plants or cars. Positive developments also 
need to be monitored. Co-operation with local 
people can, for instance, open new possibili- 
ties for site protection and for participation in 
  
tourism based on cultural values. Increased 
interest from researchers can help to explain 
cultural values and counteract threats to them. 
Itis often hard to detect changes on a day- 
to-day basis, and those in charge of listed sites 
need help. They need tools that will enable 
them to check whether site management and 
maintenance comply with commitments made 
when the site was accepted for inclusion on 
the World Heritage List. 
A regular follow up and monitoring sys- 
tem can be such a tool, providing a fine-tun- 
ing mechanism for the overhaul of existing 
management plans and the preparation of 
action programmes for the future. Such a sys- 
tem could also lead to a constructive national 
and international exchange of experience about 
conservation methods and standards that 
would increase awareness of the values of our 
common heritage. 
The Nordic countries have a tradition of 
co-operation on matters of mutual interest. 
This general rule, which applies to the selection 
of sites for the World Heritage List, has been 
extended to include monitoring since the 
foundation of the Nordic World Heritage 
Office in Oslo (Norway), and a plan fora sys- 
tematic survey of the Nordic items on the 
List is now being drawn up. Once imple- 
mented, it should stimulate greater public 
interest in the cultural heritage and encourage 
a feeling of responsibility for it. u

### 109423: Sacred mountains

Sacred mountains are the 
World Heritage sites that 
enshrine the highest physical and 
spiritual values. For many the sight 
of a distant peak looming over 
lowlands, floating above the clouds, 
reaching towards the stars, awakens 
the spirit, evoking intimations of 
~ divine mystery and splendour. As 
the highest features of the land- 
scape, mountains have naturally 
become associated with the highest 
values and aspirations of cultures 
and religious traditions around the 
world. 
Sacred mountains on the World 
Heritage List range from the wild, 
uninhabited glaciers of Mount St. 
Elias on the remote border between 
the Yukon and Alaska to the densely 
populated buildings and streets of 
Jerusalem centred around the Temple 
mount. Cultural monuments such

story of a priest who came to New

Sacred mountains have also 
played important roles in history,

them feel deeply motivated to make 
sure they are protected. Some of 
these sites have become important 
centres for preserving traditional 
knowledge about the environment 
and valuable gene pools for replac-

also strengthens the societies that

### 109408: A Canal in southern France

‘A canal In southern France 
by Francois Bordry B 
In October 1666 King Louis 
XIV of France authorized 
Pierre Paul de Riquet (1604-1680) to 
start work on what was to become 
one of the seventeenth century’s 
most ambitious civil engineering 
projects, the Canal du Midi. 
Built only a few decades after 
the Briare Canal (1642), on which 
the technology of locks and the use 
of reaches of water at high altitude 
had been perfected, the Canal du 
Midi was intended to join the 
Atlantic Ocean with the Mediter- 
ranean, to “improve the prosperity 
of trade by avoiding the Straits of 
Gibraltar, pirates and the Spanish 
king’s fleet”, and to give “more con- 
siderable advantages to the provinces 
of Languedoc and Guyenne”. The 
canal is sometimes called the 
Languedoc Canal or the Canal of 
the Two Seas. 
The canal, which stretches 240 
kilometres between Toulouse and 
the Etang de Thau, took 12,000 
labourers, including 600 women, 
fifteen years to build and incorpo- 
rates feats of engineering that were 
technologically ahead of their time. 
Among the most remarkable of 
them are: 
e The Saint-Ferréol Dam in the 
Montagne Noire (Black Mountain) 
massif. This dam, the biggest of its 
time (780 metres long at the top and 
140 at the base), provides all the 
canal’s water. 
o The number of locks, 63 in all. At 
Fonserannes an eight-lock staircase

water to his birthplace, the city of 
Béziers.

o The Repudre Aqueduct was the 
first canal bridge built in France and 
is now the world’s oldest. It was 
greatly admired by Vauban, Louis

the basis for other aqueducts on the 
canal, most of which are still stand- 
ing today.

world’s first navigable underground 
stretch of canal. The 173-metre-long 
tunnel was built on asite at the foot 
of the hill where the Roman 
oppidum of Ensérune once stood. 
Riquet’s genius lay in finding 
water resources for the canal. Work- 
ing with a team of hydraulic spe- 
cialists, he explored the Montagne 
Noire massif, a region he knew well, 
and dug a 70-kilometre network of 
channels to drain the waters of small 
tributaries and bring the waters of 
the Montagne Noire from the 
 
Narouze Pass, the canal’s highest 
point (altitude 194 metres), to the 
watershed between the Atlantic and 
the Mediterranean. 
Pierre Paul de Riquet died on 
1 October 1680, before the work 
was completed. His son Mathias 
ordered the first navigation trials 
on 15 May 1681. For more than 
two centuries the canal fulfilled 
expectations and brought prosper- 
ity to the regions through which 
it passed. Both goods and passen- 
gers were transported along it. 
Horse-drawn barges, small boats 
and lighters carrying wine plied 
between banks that bustled with 
the non-stop activity of lock- 
keepers, drivers, grooms, bargees, 
travelling salesmen and merchants. 
Today the Canal du Midi no 
longer carries goods, but it has 
taken a new lease on life with the 
development of waterway tourism. 
It is used by thousands of amateur 
sailors who discover a marvel of 
technological ingenuity and archi- 
tectural elegance which blends har- 
moniously with the countryside as 
they drift down its winding, shady 
course. It was added to the World 
Heritage List on 7 December 1996.

### 109424: Three highland villages in Japan

Three highland villages 
in Japan 
by Hidetoshi Saito and Nobuko Inaba B 
Three farming villages in a 
remote valley in the high 
central mountains of Japan’s main 
island, Honshu, were added to the 
World Heritage List in 1995. The 
villages, Ogimachi, Ainokura and 
Suganuma, are located in a region 
historically known as Shirakawa- 
go and Gokayama, where the 
mountains rise to 1,500 metres. The 
region is crossed by the Sho River, 
which flows from south to north 
towards the Sea of Japan, and 
because of the steepness of the 
mountain slopes, most of its vil- 
lages grew up on a narrow strip of 
land along the river valley. 
This is also a region of partic- 
ularly heavy snowfall. In winter 
cold winds blow in from China,

ing the Sea of Japan. Until quite 
recently, before long tunnels were 
constructed and bridges were built 
across the deep valleys, contacts 
with the outside world were very 
limited. Because of the difficulty 
of access, the area was once known 
as “Japan’s last unexplored region”. 
These geological and climatic 
conditions gave rise to a unique 
form of architecture. Larger than the 
national average, the local farmhouses 
are entirely constructed of wood, 
each one being covered with a three- 
sided, gabled thatched roof. This 
building style is called “Gassho” 
(“joined hands” in Japanese) because ®

changed the lifestyle in the moun-

houses disappeared, and many 
unique village landscapes were 
destroyed. In the last century 92 
per cent of all Gassho-style houses 
have been lost, mostly within a 
quarter of a century. 
o Community spirit 
In the 1970s, the villagers of Ogi- 
machi, Ainokura and Suganuma, 
where Gassho-style houses had 
survived in relatively good condi- 
tion, started a preservation move- 
ment in co-operation with the local 
authorities. They felt that if they 
failed to take action, their village 
environment would be destroyed. 
Wanting to preserve the entire vil- 
lage landscape and the surrounding 
natura] environment—fields, canals, 
roads and forests, as well as build- 
ings, the villagers established con- 
servation societies, and national 
legal protection systems were intro- 
duced in each village. Subsequently 
the three villages have been well 
maintained under the legal and tra- 
ditional protection systems.

### 109425: The Heritage, memory of the future

commentary Feder] CO M dyO0 Y 
  
The fundamental dilemma facing all the world’s coun- 
tries, to varying degrees, is that of the need to safeguard 
the past while continuing to build the future, the need 
to balance the demands of development and culture. 
The international scope of the problems—the details of 
which have been brought to our attention in recent 
decades through the rapid growth of communications 
technology—gives added impetus to the prevention 
and education efforts tirelessly deployed by UNESCO, 
in co-operation with all its Member States. UNESCO’s 
Constitution defines one of the Organization’s principal 
tasks as being to “maintain, increase and diffuse knowl- 
edge by assuring the conservation and protection of the 
world’s inheritance of books, works of art and monu- 
ments of history and science”. 
In the words of the Spanish scholar and writer Miguel  - 
de Unamuno, “Memory is the basis of the individual 
personality as tradition is the basis of the collective per- 
sonality of a people. We live in memory and through 
memory, and our spiritual life is, in the last resort, noth- 
ing more than the effort of remembrance to persevere, 
to become hope, the effort of our past to become future”. 
Today our world needs to adopt a broader definition 
8 —— of the word heritage. As well as the physical heritage,

### 109425: The Heritage, memory of the future

the heritage of ideas, the scientific heritage and the 
genetic heritage—which UNESCO has also beguu to pre- 
serve as the heritage of all humanity—are part of the 
ancient lieritage that we must safeguard. But I should 
also like to stress the importance of the ethical her- 
itage, the enormous relevance of a few central val- 
ues, the universal principles which contain the infinite 
diversity of our sources of inspiration and can transform 
itinto the unity that constitutes our strength and our 
hope for the future. 
The task of preserving and enhancing the heritage 
of our ancestors extends far beyond the simple preser- 
vation of magnificent landscapes and sublime monu- 
ments. For the first time in the history of humanity, 
our awareness of the repercussions of our actions on 
the planet at large obliges us to ensure that they do not 
have irreversible consequences on this heritage. This 
criterion of irreversibility, of risk reaching a point of no 
return, creates a moral obligation for decision-makers 
to take steps now before it is too late to rectify trends 
that might otherwise lead to irreversible change. 
We must be vigilant, we must look ahead, anticipate the 
future and take the necessary preventive measures. 
Today these measures are no longer optional; they con- 
stitute an ethicalimperative. We must look ahead so as 
to shape our common destiny, and we must never suc- 
cum) to fatalism. 
It cannot be said too often that everything we do 
depends on consolidating the foundations of peace. It 
is UNESCO’s mission, in particular, to build peace in 
people’s minds through education, science and cul- 
. HE LG Gu JH a i ES hin ais SES wndeilin 8 
ture. This is our goal and it is this that I wish to empha- 
size so that, in our day-to-day work, even when we 
are addressing the most specifie issues, we never lose 
sight of this paramount concern. Because where there 
is conflict, where there is violence, where there 1s war, 
there is only destruetion. There 1s no safeguarding, 
there are no human rights, no democracy, no rights to 
education, justice or housing. Without peace there is 
nothing. Peace is the precondition, and that is why it 
was so clearly proclaimed by the founders of the United 
Nations and of UNESCO in the preamble to their respec- 
tive charters. The overriding aim they set forth is to pre- 
vent “the scourge of war”, to stop people killing one 
another. 
I believe that the most important monument we 
have to preserve is human life. ITminan beings alone are 
endowed with the creative spirit. This is their distine- 
tive faculty, setting them aside from all other living 
organisms. This is the wonder of human life. And in 
wishing to preserve human life, our first concern must 
be with children, children all over the world, whatever 
their nationality, for children have no nationality, they 
are the children of us all. They are the mostimportant 
and the most fragile heritage we have to preserve. 
Our constant endeavour, then, must be to preserve 
human life. [Tow is this to be achieved? Tow is violence 
to be averted? In seeking answers to these (questions we 
must draw upon our memory of the future so that we 
can, in the world of tomorrow, safeguard the most 
important human right, the right to life. 
Let us never forget that safeguarding the past is 
important insofar as it contributes to a new design for 
the future. HN

Available food resources are 
increasing at a slower pace 
than world population, especially 
in developing eonntries. To reverse 
this critical trend, farmers in these 
regions require simple and effec- 
tive farming methods, 
The United Nations Develop- 
ment Programme (UNDP) and the 
United Nations University (UNU) 
have devised an integrated farming 
model adapted to tropical regions. 
Participants at the Indo-Paeific 
Workshop held from 5 to 9 May 
1997 in Suva, the Fijian capital, as 
part of the UNU’s Zero Emission 
Researeh Initiative (ZERI), had an 
opportunity to see an experimen- 
tal farm in action at the Montfort 
Boys’ Town Training Centre. 
Food strategies in industrialized 
countries are based on raising live- 
stock, the largest consumer of

cereal grains and soya Dean meal. 
According to Lylian Rodriguez, a 
Colombian agronomist specializing 
intropical agrienlinre, 50% of the 
world grain supply goes to feeding 
livestock. If this produce were 
reserved for human consumption, 
studies estimate there would be 
enough to feed 10 billion people, a 
figure around which world popula- 
lion is expected to stabilize. 
Rodriguez advocates an inte- 
grated farming system based on 
recycling. Farmers from developing 
conntries wonld grow plants for 
feeding livestock and reeyele the 
wastes produeed. This circuit has 
many economic and ecological ben- 
efits: Hivestock produees meat, milk 
and eggs; animal excrements supply 
biogas for cooking, heating and 
light; manure and other residues 
produce a compost that is used as an

form waste materials into hinus 
and can be used as animal feed. 
EXPLOITING BIOGAS 
In the rural areas of developing 
countries, biogas is one of the 
cheapest sources of renewable 
energy. It forms naturally in humid 
environments with no air or oxygen 
and can be obtained artificially by 
fermenting animal or plant waste in 
a basin known as a biodigester, 
linked by a tnbe to a large polyeth- 
ylene bag. Rich in methane and car- 
bon dioxyde, this unpurified gas 
supplies between 5,000 and 60,000 
kiloealories per cubic metre. 
Biogas has many uses. It pro- 
vides cooking fuel, which cuts fire- 
wood consumption, and eonverts 
manure into an improved fertilizer. 
It reduces manure smells, elimi- 
nates cooking smoke and controls 
pathogens, thereby improving the 
farm environment. 
Biodigesters do more than pro- 
duce gas. Their effluent can be 
used to fertilize both soil-based 
crops and {loating aquatic plants 
like cassava and duckweed, two 
important protein sources for feed- 
ing pigs, ducks and chickens in 
tropical regions. 
For many years, Rodriguez has 
worked with farmers in Viet Nam 
to spread this model. The cassava 
serves as a fence which protects 
the Diodigester and ponds oecu- 
pyinga 61m? arca. Every 45 days, 
the cassava leaves are harvested, 
producing a yield of 35 kilos per 
year, in addition to the 43 kilos of 
protein produced annually by the 
duckweed ponds. These are sig-

grounds. Over a three-year period, 
they learn manual skills and grad- 
uate to a job. 
George Chan, a Mauritian of Chi- 
nese origin, directed the installation 
of a vast integrated farming system 
at the Centre. A biodigester recy- 
cles sheep and chicken wastes. The 
enriched water, purified of patho- 
genic elements dangerous to buman 
health, runs into 3,000 m2 of ponds 
filled with several types of carp and 
tilapia. Since the fish do not breed 
on the spot, young specimens have to 
be brought in from the outside. But 
they grow quickly, providing a food 
supply for the school kitchen and 
local markets. 
Tt cost about $30,000 to build 
the farm, an investment Chan says 
will be paid off in three or four years 
by profits from livestock and poly- 
culture, Annual production of fish (6 
tons) brings in $10,000, with an 
additional $3,000 to $4,000 from 
butcher animals. Vegetables and 
flowers will be cultivated on the 
pond banks, and strawberries and 
orchids on rafts. 
MUSHROOM GROWING 
Shuting Chang, a specialist in mush- 
room genetics (see UNESCO Courier, 
June 1994, “Biotechnology: the 
resourceful gene”), advocates cul- 
tivating edible mushrooms on the 
composted plant waste. 
Temperatures in the tropics are 
too high for growing certain species 
known in Europe, like the Agari-

cus mushroom (Agaricus bisporus). 
Chang selects species adapted to 
hot climates that only require sim- 
ple substrates (wood or sawdust, 
rice or sugar cane straw, waste from 
cotton or water byacinths), pro- 
vided they have been correetly pre- 
pared and composted. In the case 
of pleurotus (Pleurotus ostreatus), 
the straw and sawdust mix has to be 
prepared by autoclaving to elimi- 
nate toxic substances harmful to 
the spawn’s growth. When this pre- 
caution is taken, four to five har- 
vests are obtained every year. Black 
mushrooms, widely used in Chinese 
eooking (Auricula judae), grow 
dircetly on the wood. Another 
prized species, shiitake or per- 
fumed mushroom (Lentinus edo- 
des), is rich in protein. One square 
metre yields five kilos of perfumed 
mushrooms, which only take one 
month to reach maturity.

Mushrooms are a valuable

plants can convert agricultural 
waste materials into human food. 
Furthermore, they have interesting 
nutritional and medicinal proper-

years, Chinese, Korean and Japan- 
ese traditional medicine has used 
mushrooms for reinforeing the 
immnne system, enhancing mem- 
ory, delaying the aging process and 
fighting tumours, aecording to 
Shuting Chang. 
Devcloping an integrated {farm- 
ing system like the one in Montfort 
requires an overall understanding 
of low-cost production techniques 
that protect the environment. 
Horst Doelle, director of the

interview 
Youssef Chahine is a major Egyptian film 
director with an international reputation. 
Earlier this year he was awarded a special 
prize by the Cannes Film Festival on the 
occasion of its 50th anniversary, as an 
accolade for his lifetime's work in the 
cinema. Drama, emotional intensity and 
humanism are the leitmotiv of his films. As a 
man Chahine has championed the cause of 
democratic and progressive intellectuals 
against the currents of fundamentalism and 
conservatism. 
Interview by Michel Fargeon 
Youssef Chahine 
BR After the presentation of your latest film, 
Destiny, the 1997 Cannes Film Festival jury awarded 
you its 50th anniversary prize for your life's work. You 
thus join film-makers like Orson Welles and Luchino 
Visconti who were honoured with 20th and 35th 
Cannes Festival anniversary prizes respectively. 
Youssef Chahine: For me, the greatest reward of all 
was the love and warmth expressed by the fil pro- 
fessionals from all over the world who gave me a 
standing ovation in Cannes’s hinge Louis Lumiére 
theatre. When 1 walked np to the mierophone to 
thank them, 1 almost broke down. All those people, 
who are supposed to be so tough, were opening 
their hearts to me—and love is never a one-way feel- 
ing. I couldn’t find words to describe the feelings 
they had aroused in me. 
As for recognition of my life’s work, 1 have to say 
that none of the 33 films 1 have directed to date has 
been casy to do. At first 1 had a hard time winning 
recognition and acceptance, and 1 owe alot to for- 
eign erittes like Jean-Louis Bory, who organized 
sereenings of my films at Unesco lleadquartersin 
Paris. 1t was a way of paying tribute to the work 
being done in a country like Egypt, whose cinema 
was usually regarded with condescension rather 
than admiration. Many people in Europe thonght 
  that all we could do was make light comedies 
with belly daneing scenes, obviously—though some 
of us were working hard and making more worth- 
while films, often on shoestring hudgets. That is 
why 1 feel 1 am sharing my prize with all the film- 
makers [rom poor eountries who are still having 
great difficulty in making films iu their own eoun- 
tries. In view of my age—I was horn in 1926—1 feel 
that 1 am in a sense their elder statesman, and it

Youssef Chahine at the Cannes Film Festival (May, 1997). 
gave me tremendous pleasure to have been to some 
extent their representative in Cannes. 
B Have the film festivals that have made you 
known outside Egypt also enabled you to present 
your own culture to others? 
Y. C.: For a long time people like me were largely 
used as cultural alibis. We were seeond-string guests 
atfestivals, an extra flag for them to fly and a token 
of their internationalism. We got what we could out 
of them. We were working flat out simply to exist as 
Third World film-makers, and thosc festivals were, 
despite it all, wonderful ways for ns to make our cul- 
ture and our hardships known, to break down the 
walls of ignorance. Knowledge knows ne boundaries. 
It travels from one eountry to another via sharing. 
That is, incidentally, one of the themes of my most 
recent film, Destiny. Without memory, we are 
doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past, which 
have sometimes led humanity to its worst excesses. 
All golden ages have emerged [rom periods of toler- 
ance, sharing and love for one’s neighbour. 
B Yourfilm The Emigrant was banned in Egypt 
shortly after its release. ... 
Y. C.: A fundamentalist group sued me and man- 
aged to convince the court that the film was blas- 
phemous. 1 had spent two years working on it and 
was very upset by the court’s decision, which I con- 
sidered unacceptable and repellent. The greatest 
humiliation for an artist is to feel gagged. I don’t 
make films to hide them away. Apart from my own 
disappointment, a lot was at stake in that trial: the 
descent into intolerance always has terrible results. 
It has to he eountered at all costs, especially since

» the fundamentalist approach is found everywhere, 
in alt religions. Ouly minorities are involved, but the 
press often unwittingly serves their interests by giv- 
ing them a lot of publicity. That's the kind of thing 
[ had in mind when I thought of Destiny. There was 
also another, more private reason. I had a friend—a 
+ charming [lellow, open-minded, tolerant, to some 
extent my alter ego—who acted in several of my 
films but who suddenly went over to the fundamen- 
talists. I couldn’t help but wonder about the deep- 
rooted causes of such a change of direction. 
MW In Destinyan intellectual is confronted by 
fundamentalists. What resources does he have to 
combat them? 
Y. C.: Tt is often said that violence begets violence. 
Television assails us with scencs of violence, gratu- 
itoiis, ugly violence, whose only purpose is to fill the 
pockets of certain produeers. As if stories about 
psychopaths and criminals were the only ones worth 
filming! But the worst kind of violence is perhaps 
to say to someone: “Everything you write will be 
burned.” To fight that violence [ use joie de vivre, 
nmisic, dance—and, of conrse, reason. In Destiny the 
main character, who is at first conditioned by sec- 
tartan thinking, recovers all his joie de vivre when 
he hears the film’ theme song. Ie also dances, aud 
as lie does so, his intolerance and pettiness melt 
away. Dance is as generous as love. 
HM Asfar as you're concerned, does the rise of 
fundamentalism begin when freedom of thought is 
forbidden? 
Y. C.: No doubt about it. But no one today seems to 
be really thinking about the reasons for the rise of 
fundamentalism in different parts of the world. Why 
do so many young people, in many cases college grad- 
uates, support these ideas from another age? Eeo- 
nomic globalization devours people. Young people 
today are excluded from the social process and are 
replaced by machines. Yet a person’s dignity is pri- 
ntarily defined by work. I am revolted when I see 
countries—~sometiues rich countries—let a whole 
section of their population languish in ignorance on 
the sidelines of soeiety. But some day or other, some- 
how or other, people eventually start to think and 
express themselves, overcoming their hesitations and 
defying censorship. And then things change. . . . 
BM Music and dance play a prominent part in 
Destiny. Does this represent a return to your first 
love, the days when you made musicals? 
Y. C.: Music and dance are ways of handling tragedy 
with a light tonch. Dance is an invaluable form of 
expression [or communicating joie de vivre. And | 
love flantenco. It is music that links East and West. 
The first films I saw when I was young were French 
music-hall comedies. Music is the opposite of arro- 
gance. Itis a form of sharing. Everyone loves to sing 
and dance. It is always possible to say important 
things without boring one’s andience, and even to 
give them pleasure in the process. 
THE UNESCO Courier WB SEPTEMBER 1997 
WM Of all your films, which is your favourite? 
Y. Ci Alexandria . . . Why? First of all because 1 
was born in that city. Secondly because it depicts 
two aspects of my Alexandria—the Alexandria I 
knew—that are dearest to me: [riendship and tol- 
erance. All religions, all cultures, all kinds of ideas 
lived side by side in that Alexandria. There were no 
barriers between people: Arabs, Greeks, Armeni- 
ans, Italians, Jews, Russians and French, were all 
friends. No one despised anyone else. We spoke 
almost all these languages, not very well perhaps, 
but we made onrselves understood with a few words 
and phrases. Everyone accepted everyone else. 
Friendship was the rule. This melting pot of peo- 
ple and cultures has vanished today, aud this is 
something I bitterly regret. In Alexandria . . . 
Why? the city is a character in its own right and has 
its own identity and vitality. This explains the title. 
HM Yet you left Alexandria for Hollywood where you 
went to learn your profession. 
Y. C.: Ilats off to American technique! In America 
Ilearned rules straight ont of Aristotle and Plato, 
which American seriptwriters use to produce sce-

narios that are very well constructed but which, 
unfortunately, often tell trashy stories. They re 
always well packaged, well edited and well acted, 
but the stories themselves are mediocre. You sce 
filnts that are remarkably well direeted, hut devoid 
of content: a bit of sex, some stunts, explosions, 
violence and brawling, but when I come out of the 
cinema, I feel I’ve seen nothing at all. I don’t go to 
the cinema to waste my time. 
And yet we have a kind of eomplex about the 
United States. We thiuk that if our Alms are not dis- 
tributed there, they don’t exist. But the Ameri- 
can market will never be open to us; protectionism 
in disguise prevails there. Basically, the Americans 
aren’t interested in films from abroad. Of course 
this doesn’t stop them flooding our sereens with 
their own produetions. We sometimes even man- 
age to invent revolutionary techniques, hut they 
don’t want te know. 1 actually directed the first 
chase scene in cinema history filmed using a hand- 
held camera, an enormously heavy old “Derbie”. 1 
followed the actors down the narrow eorridors of an 
ancient temple. And yet my films, like those of 
many other film-makers from countries of the 
South, have been stdelined [rom major interna- 
tional distribution eircuits. 
BM You started out making light entertainment 
productions before going on to more demanding 
films.

“more aware”. There was a time when my friends 
were leaving Alexandria, and I asked myself why. In 
The Land (1969) 1 tackled the theme of the fel- 
lahin, who possess nothing but whose work pro- 
vides food for us all. But most of all it was after the 
defeat of the Egyptian army in the Six-Day Warin 
1967 that I really became aware of the situation in 
my country. The final scene in The Sparrow (1973), 
where the women take to the streets to express 
their refusal of defeat, was a major turning point in 
my life. Later, when Twas faced with death, I said 
to myself: “What have you done so far?”. I have 
expressed opinions and portrayed feelings whieh, 
in the last analysis, encapsulated an experience 
and refleeted a truth. 1tis very hard to step back 
and look at yourself, to sce yourself as you really 
are. As long as you don’t give way to self-absorption, 
when yon talk about yourself in a social and human 
context, you talk abont ether people too. 
BM What about your experience in theatre? 
Y. C.: What a wonderful memory! It was one of the 
greatest joys of my life! twas an incredible gamble 
on the part of Jaeques Lassalle, the then Director 
of the Comédie I'rancaise in Paris, to ask me— 
someone from another planet who hadn’t produced 
anything in the theatre for forty years—to put on 
a play of my choice. I chose Albert Camus’s 
Caligula. You can imagine what an honour it was for 
me to work with the highly professional actors of 
the Comédie Francaise. I threw myself body and 
soul into this production, I gave it all I'd got. It 
was a tremendous suecess: seventeen curtain calls 
on the first night. An unforgettable experience. 
BM Isit hard for Youssef Chahine to make films in 
Egypt? 
Y. Ci It’s getting more and more difficult for every- 
oue, Once upon a time we made 120 films a year in 
Egypt. Then eighty. Now we're down to sixteen. 
Without French support even 1 could no longer 
make films there. Freneh TV channels buy the 
advance rights to my films, which is a wonderful 
show of support. Egyptian television on the other 
hand stifles talent by only promoting mediocre 
series. They even dare to use excerpts from my 
films without my permission! say to my Egyptian 
students: “Freedom must be fonght for nonstop; it 
isn’t handed out on a plate.” Teelinique is not 
important; you can learn that from books. What 
needs to be taught is freedom. 1 also tell them that 
in order to make films you must have a vision of 
the world. To the actors, technicians and camera- 
men who start out in my films Lsay it takes courage 
to launch yourself and create your own experience. 
As for inspiration, that can be found by observing 
people—with a sympathetie eye. I you love other 
people, every story is interesting. Everybody has a 
magnificent story somewhere inside them. The 
important thing is to know how to listen to the story 
and then to tell it. |

The Unesco Courier will be taking part in the 11th Bordeaux Book Fair 
(Salon du Livre de Bordeaux) from 9 to 12 October 1997. 
As well as seeking to promote books, reading and professions associated with the book 
world, the Fair is also a cultural festival in its own right. Two exhibitions feature on this 
year's programme, one devoted to the Italian writer Dino Buzzati's work as a novelist, 
journalist and playwright, and the other to French man of the theatre Jean Vilar. The 
exhibitions will be accompanied by readings, debates and literary panels. 
This year's foreign literature prize, which honours the work of a writer from outside the 
French-speaking world and the quality of its translation into French, has been awarded to 
the German writer Christa Wolf and her translator.
