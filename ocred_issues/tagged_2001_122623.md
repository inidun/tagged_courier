en think back on this day last year. It was May 27,the day 
er my birthday. I had just turned 28 and didn’t really feel 
like going to work, but, as the Ukrainian expression goes, 
iba hotchech,mousych!” (“You must,whether you like it 
not!”). 
Before the ambulance set off on the streets of Kiev that 
morning, I ran down the usual checklist. The doctor filled out 
the call sheets, a co-worker checked the equipment. When 
everybody was ready, we hit the road! 
Our rescue squad answers all kinds of calls, but most of the 
time we deal with cardio-vascular and gastric diseases, various 
kinds of poisoning and,of course, trauma. 
That day, from ten in the morning till four in the afternoon, 
we drove through the city following a well-worn pattern. I 
don’t know if the capricious weather that spring had anything 
to do with it, but there were a lot of heart attacks. We treated 
some patients at home and brought others to the nearest 
hospital.One man had dropped a 200-litre barrel on his leg 
and paid for his lack of caution with a broken foot. 
Then we had to deal with a car crash caused by two reckless 
drivers. One was suffering from brain trauma and a chest 
injury. The other was walking around desperately waving his 
arms, trying to convince us that he wasn’t speeding and that he 
hadn’t been drinking “too much”—just a few beers—even 
though drinking and driving are against the law in Ukraine. 
At around 5:30 p.m.,we received a call. A man,we were 
told,showed no signs of life. We rushed to the scene. He was 
homeless, dead drunk and incapable of the slightest reaction. 
And there we were, three young women—I was the oldest— 
lifting this poor, dirty “divine creature” on to a stretcher and

carrying him to the ambulance. Our driver helped us, of 
course, but no man, much less a woman,can feel fulfilled by 
this kind of work. 
We are all children of God, and no one has the right to 
judge that homeless man. Who knows why he’s on the streets? 
The deep-seated changes that have occurred in our country 
in the past 15 years have given some people the chance to 
strike it rich and dragged others into poverty. And 
unfortunately, those others are the great majority. 
But something else baffles me. We used to have a special 
ward and rehab centres staffed by sturdy men for this kind of 
case. That was indispensable: in Ukraine, “drinking” does not 
mean the same thing as in the west. But recently, a few 
bureaucrats decided to get rid of these centres, probably for 
financial reasons. And they gave paramedics the responsibility 
for “collecting” drunks. 
Ours woke up and decided that now was the time to “get 
to know each other.” He grabbed me by the leg and started

pulling me towards him. I screamed, the 
driver stopped the ambulance, came to 
my rescue and calmed him down with 
a... heavy object. The incident was 
quickly over, but my hands shook for a 
long while. That time, we were lucky. 
Our “customer” fell asleep without 
moving or making noise. We had to take 
his pulse to make sure he was still alive. 
It was 20 kilometres to the hospital 
and as many for the way back. Being 
stuck in traffic jams gave me time to 
wonder about a few things. For example, 
why go through 10 years of school and 
several years of training—three for a 
nurse, six for a doctor — just to pick 
drunks up off the street? At these times 
I feel as though my profession, 
knowledge and eight years’ experience 
are useless. It’s hard to escape a deep 
sense of disappointment. 
But you can’t spend your time 
brooding. In two months, I'll be on 
vacation with my boyfriend on the 
shores of the Black Sea. I used to go 
there with my parents, but that was such 
along time ago, it seems like a dream... 
We want to stop at Feodosiya,the town 
where the seascape painter Ayvasovsky 
once lived. Then we’ll head further south, 
to Sudak and Novi Svet, where Prince 
Galitsin had tunnels dug to grow the 
local mushrooms that won a medal at the 
1900 World Fair in Paris. Close by, there 
is a cave where the world-famous opera 
singer Chaliapin used to give impromptu 
concerts. And then, somebody told me 
about a grove of juniper bushes whose fragrance is so subtle 
that words cannot describe it.I am familiar with the scent of 
roses, lilies and lavender, but that of juniper is still unknown 
to me. 
I'm also planning to see the Toplovski monastery, where 
the martyred Saint Paraskeva lived. After the October 
Revolution, the Soviets set up the Besboshnik (“The Atheist”) 
kolkhoz [collective farm] on the monastery’s land, and the 
three sacred sources dried up. In the early 1990s, when the 
property was restituted to the Orthodox church, the spring 
began to flow again.Now, people come from everywhere on 
pilgrimages to drink and touch the water. I know all that 
from accounts and pictures. But now that I believe in divine 
providence, I'm looking forward to seeing it with my own eyes. 
But the day is not over. Another call took us to a dead-end 
near the train station, where someone found an unconscious 
boy. The siren wailed. We rushed into the unknown, to a place 
with neither a street nor a house. It was almost midnight. =

Toxic rain kills 
more than the coca 
The so-called “war on coca” in Colombia, backed by the United States, is destroying jungles and 
forests, and threatening the health of half a million peasants and indigenous peoples

of veins appears that seems 
to carry a substance towards the centre. 
This is the narcotic over which 15,000 
leftist guerrillas and 8,000 far-right 
paramilitary troops are fighting in 
Colombia. Each side’s secret military 
structure rests on the underground 
economy of growing and refining coca 
leaves. Drug trafficking has set off a war 
in Colombia just as diamonds have in 
Sierra Leone. 
Over the last 15 years, trafficking has 
turned Colombia into a top national 
security issue for the United States, the 
world’s largest consumer of cocaine. As

such, the U.S. has a direct influence on 
Colombia’s fight against drugs through 
hefty budgets, military hardware and 
other aid, along with the threat of 
political and economic sanctions. 
American involvement has increased to 
the point that the so-called Colombia 
Plan,the main programme of President 
Andres Pastrana’s government, now 
receives $1.3 billion in U.S. aid. 
According to Pastrana’s reasoning, if 
all the coca planted in the country is 
destroyed, there will be no money left to 
fight the war, allowing peace to be 
negotiated with the outlawed groups. 
No more cocaine would be sold on the 
streets of American cities. Washington 
supports this scenario. To achieve the 
goal within five years, a military offensive

was drawn up, including the creation of 
three anti-drug battalions and a fleet of 
planes to spray the plants with a poison 
called glyphosate. 
Is this a good thing? Environmental 
NGOs such as Accion Andina see it as a 
scorched-earth policy and the European 
Union criticizes the programme because 
it provides no long-term solution for the 
survival of communities that live off 
growing coca. The government says at 
least half a million people—450,000 
peasants and 50,000 indigenous people— 
depend directly on the crop for their 
livelihood. Yet last December, the 
authorities began large-scale secret 
spraying of coca plantations with 
glyphosate, a pink liquid herbicide used 
against all crop diseases. 
A desolate 
scene 
Colombian officials from the 
antinarcotics directorate of the national 
police say 30,000 hectares of coca were 
sprayed with the poison last January. 
Glyphosate has been used since 1984 to 
kill marijuana plants. A decade later, the 
government authorized its use in the 
Andean highlands to eradicate a violet 
poppy whose buds produce a thick white 
liquid that forms the rubbery substance 
from which opium, morphine and heroin 
are refined. 
Although glyphosate is banned in 
several U.S. states, including Florida, 
where it was rejected as a way to 
eradicate marijuana plants in the 
Everglades region “because of its unclear 
effects on the environment,” the 
Colombian authorities cited research 
funded by the country’s national farming 
institute that ensures the chemical does 
not pose a health risk to humans and is 
only slightly toxic for animals and plants. 
To appease the growing chorus of

criticism, the authorities promised to 
implement an environmental 
management plan that would limit use of 
the chemical to destroying illegal plants, 
without harming the rest of the 
environment or people. Six years later, 
this plan remains a draft document on 
the desk of environment minister Juan 
Mayr. Meanwhile, the poisonous rain 
has now been sprayed over more than 
300,000 hectares of jungle and forest. 
National watchdog bodies such as 
the office of the ombudsman have since 
shown that glyphosate causes irreparable 
harm to people and the environment 
wherever it is used. The ombudsman’s 
most recent study 
The social consequences of this are 
huge. Villages have been abandoned and 
about 20,000 people have fled their land 
in the face of the military campaign 
against coca.Anticipating the arrival of 
refugees, the UNHCR set up camps in 
the border area of Lake Agrio (Ecuador) 
halfway through 2000.“The evidence is 
strong, so we're calling for an immediate 
halt to the spraying and for the 
compensation of the victims whose 
livelihoods are seriously threatened,” 
says ombudsman Eduardo Cifuentes. 
There is no effective coordination, he 
observes, between the various state 
bodies involved in the government’s 
anti-drug campaign

January 11 against 
the damage 
glyphosate had done to their staple crops 
(maize, bananas, manioc and other 
vegetables), their health and the lives of 
their animals. A delegation from the 
ombudsman’s office, along with experts 
from the UN High Commission for 
Refugees (UNHCR), visited the area 
between January 15 and 25 and reported 
on what they described as a “desolate 
scene.” There had been “indiscriminate 
destruction of the jungle, legal crops, 
medicinal plants and fish-ponds. There is 
clear evidence that wildlife has fled, 
rivers are contaminated and production 
in the region has fallen.” 
Skin and gastro-intestinal problems, 
fevers, headaches, nausea, colds and 
vomiting were common among the 
inhabitants, the mission observed. The 
police and the national anti-narcotics 
authority, which are in charge of the 
spraying, argue that the herbicide is 
dropped very accurately thanks to 
satellite imagery and aerial photography 
that pinpoint the exact location of the 
coca plantations. But wind and the 
weather means that the chemical can 
overshoot the fields by up to 150 metres,

1968 drawn by fortunes to be made out of 
rice growing. Today, he has a wife, 13 
children and has had enough of growing 
coca “for the big shots.” He lives in the 
Santana district and is trying to persuade 
500 of his neighbours that the only 
solution is to sign an agreement with the 
government to pull up the coca plants by 
hand themselves in exchange for an end 
to spraying and subsidies to grow legal

years. It’s left some of us ruined and 
others injail or in the cemetery.” He has 
the hands of an expert coca gatherer, a 
raspachin, as the drug traffickers call 
them,and they were the first to sign an 
accord with the government to destroy 
the coca plants “voluntarily and not 
under threat of the poison.” For Loaiza, 
this is the only solution. 
In recent months, 5,000 families— 
small-time growers with no more than 
10 hectares of coca—have chosen this 
path. These are people who harvest the 
leaves between three and six times a 
year, pack them in bags and take them by 
river to the nearest processing plant. 
Amid or alongside the coca bushes, they 
grow bananas, manioc, maize, fruit and 
medicinal plants. If these crops are

U.S. State Department figures from March 
2000 say 140,000 hectares in Colombia are 
planted with coca bushes, producing about 
580 tonnes of pure cocaine a year. Coca does 
not hold the same cultural importance in   
Colombia as it does in Bolivia and other 
Andean countries, although it has always 
been used for medicinal reasons, especially by 
the Indians living in Amazonia.But it is still 
not legal to use it, as it is in some parts of 
Bolivia. [|

sprayed from the air, the 
families’ lives are destroyed in 
one stroke. 
The agreements signed by 
the farmers stipulate that they 
must uproot all their coca 
plants within a year in 
exchange for being included 
in alternative development 
schemes. The deal works in 
Loaiza’s village, where a 
factory to process palm-oil 
and fruit has been set up to 
enable the villagers who carry 
out the deal to earn a living. 
This would seem to be the 
ideal solution for getting rid 
of coca without further 
damaging the eco-system, at 
least in the eyes of peasants 
and environmental 
organizations. But the funds 
set aside in the Colombia Plan 
for such alternative 
development are small 
compared with the amount 
for military operations and 
spraying. The U.S. is supplying 
only $300 million for social 
and economic substitution 
compared with $1 billion for 
military purposes. 
A new strategy? 
Another obstacle to the agreements 
with the peasants is that they do not 
attract the big-time coca growers, those 
who have 100 hectares or more planted, 
with hidden arsenals to protect them. 
Gonzalo de Francisco, an aide to 
President Pastrana, runs the Colombia 
Plan in Putumayo province. There, he 
says, “the government has no choice but 
to use military means and aerial 
spraying.” 
The head of the national anti- 
narcotics authority, Gabriel Merchdn, 
told the UNEsco Courier that “the drug- 
traffickers are the ones who damage the 
environment and nobody protests 
against that. The arguments are all about 
condemning the use of glyphosate 
despite the fact we’ve used it in 
accordance with national law and 
international rules.” Environment 
minister Juan Mayr agrees, and both 
men insist the “drug traffickers have 
deforested 600,000 hectares of jungle 
and forest land and use 75 chemicals 
more poisonous than glyphosate.”

Tomaés Leon Sicard, a Colombian 
National University researcher and 
expert on the environment and 
development, thinks the parties involved 
should stop being politicians for a 
moment and get to the heart of the 
matter. This is urgent, he says, because 
“The drug traffickers 
are the ones who 
damage the 
environment and 
nobody protests 
against that.” 
the fighting is taking place in very fragile 
and biologically diverse rural eco- 
systems, such as Amazonia. He calls on 
the combatants to save them since “there 
is enough room for everyone on land in 
the agricultural regions” 
Implementation of the Colombia 
Plan, massive spraying and peasant 
protests have spurred the 
environmentalists to 
intervene. After a lot of 
pressure, the U.S. State 
Department recently 
admitted for the first time that 
“errors” were perhaps being 
made in the spraying 
operations and that a new 
eradication strategy might be 
considered if an effective one 
could be found. 
Court action 
For the time being, the 
figures used by the anti- 
narcotics officials themselves 
show that the more land is 
sprayed, the more new land 
is planted with coca. The 
plantations simply move from 
one province to another 
because the conditions for 
growing it are still all there— 
poverty, unemployment, 
absence of the state, social 
conflict and a growing 
demand for cocaine from 
foreign markets. 
In these circumstances, one 
non-repressive solution is the 
law. Environmental lawyers 
Claudia Sampedro and Héctor 
Sudrez have persuaded a Colombian 
administrative court to allow a demand 
from a grassroots group for the 
government to take responsibility for the 
damage the spraying has done to the 
environment and to people. 
“For the first time, Colombian society 
is using the law to check that the 
government respects the environment, 
not just by recognizing the damage 
caused,but by suspending the spraying 
and taking preventive measures,” says 
Sampedro, an expert in international 
environmental law. 
How can the authorities have been 
spraying for more than 15 years without 
taking any steps to protect the 
environment? Who will take 
responsibility for that and for the 
irreversible damage that has been done? 
The court will try to answer that very 
soon because the debate is moving onto

When girls go missing 
from the classroom 
Millions of girls are not making it into school, despite a concerted international movement to push 
the cause forward. In some African countries, the gender gap is even widening.What's gone wrong?

n Ethiopia, girls are sometimes abducted for 
marriage when they're no more than eight. In 
West Africa, they're recruited from poor 
rural families to work as domestics in coastal 
Wetton or neighbouring countries. In South 
Africa, a recent report by Human Rights 
Watch warns that sexual violence and abuse 
is hampering girls’ access to education.And 
in Afghanistan,they’ve simply been barred 
from school under the Taleban regime.

Girls account for an estimated 90 perce 
still account for 60 percent of the estimated 
113 million out-of-school children, and the 
majority live in sub-Saharan Africa and 
South Asia. In 1990, faced with a 
deteriorating educational record in many 
countries, the major development agencies 
and 155 national governments rang the alarm 
at a high-profile conference in Jomtien, 
Thailand.Launching the Education for All 
Initiative, ambitious targets were set, notably 
to get all children into school within ten 
years, stressing that “the most urgent 
priority” was to ensure access to, and improve 
the quality of education for girls and women. 
Ten years later, in Dakar (Senegal ), the world 
community had to face up to the fact that

nt of child domestic workers. Few have a chance to attend 
“gender discrimination continues to 
permeate education systems” and that “little 
progress has been made in increasing girls’ 
participation in basic education.” This time 
round, they set 2015 as the date by which 
“all children,particularly girls ... complete 
free and compulsory primary education of 
good quality.” More boldly, they pledged to 
eliminate “gender disparities in primary and 
secondary education by 2005.” 
For Christopher Colclough, a professor at 
the Sussex-based Institute of Development 
Studies (IDS), there is “no chance 
whatsoever”of reaching the 2005 target.In

constraints to schooling and propose policies 
to improve outcomes, the gap between girls’ 
and boys’ primary enrolment rates has 
increased in some places. “Governments 
recognize that girls’ education is incredibly 
important but their policies to tackle it are 
usually inadequate,” says Colclough, 
suggesting a “de facto political unwillingness” 
to deal with the problem. Secondly, he notes 
“if you have a situation where women and 
girls are discriminated against in society and 
not all children are in school, it follows almost 
as night follows day that girls will be kept out 
of school most.” 
Not that the task is easy. In many countries 
strapped by debt burdens, the goal appears 
more elusive than ever, with families bearing 
increasing costs for educating their children. 
“Alot of girls are dropping out of school or not 
being sent at all because of the poverty of 
parents,” says Peninah Mlama, executive 
director of the Forum for African Women 
Educationists (FAWE), a partner in the IDS 
study. “Traditional cultural attitudes are still 
very strong, especially in rural areas. The little 
money parents have to scrounge for sending 
children to school is seen as too big an 
investment to risk on the girl child.” To make 
matters worse, the HIV/AIDS pandemic is 
cutting into a generation of young adults—in 
Swaziland, it is estimated that three to four 
teachers die every week of AIDS. In the 
absence of a breadwinner, girls are the most 
likely to be denied access to school to head a 
household. 
Hidden costs 
While there is no magic bullet for solving 
the quandary, there 1s little left to discover 
about why girls stay on the sidelines, starting 
with the number one factor, poverty. 
“Although we can’t underestimate the role of 
culture, even in the most conservative 
societies like rural Yemen, the vast majority 
of families want to send their children to 
school,and they will do so if you reduce the 
costs,” says Carolyn Winter, of the World 
Bank. The problem lies in the complex 
weaving of “social and economic forces that

in collaboration with national

Foundation and the World Bank.

overlap and strengthen each other,” 
Colclough underlines. Waiving school fees 
for example, does not address the question of 
how to replace a girl’s valuable labour in the 
home and the fields, nor the profound bias in 
some countries against educating daughters. 
Nor does it recognize the hidden costs of 
schooling, from clothing to textbooks. 
Recruiting more female teachers, an 
indisputably positive influence, is only truly 
beneficial if parents are informed of their 
presence, if textbooks are revised to cut out 
stereotypes and training tackles attitude 
questions. In all the countries where they 
conducted research, the IDS team found that 
teachers believed that boys were more 
intelligent....And when chores have to get 
done like cleaning the classroom, girls are 
naturally expected to oblige. 
“If there is one lesson we have learned, 
“You have to 
understand 
that girls may get less 
protein than boys, 
that communities raise 
girls to have 
different expectations.” 
it’s that there is no single quick fix, but there 
are usually to two or three actions together 
that are catalytic,” says Mary Joy Pigozzi, a 
senior UNICEF education advisor. Two are 
proven musts: getting parents and 
communities involved in schools, and 
improving quality. Most importantly, says 
Pigozzi, quality has be thought about in 
“engendered” terms through an “affirmative 
action” approach that takes into account 
where the learner is coming from: “You have 
to understand that girls may get less protein 
than boys, that communities raise girls to 
have different expectations of themselves. 
Then you have to look at the quality of the 
learning environment to address issues such 
as safety and sexual harassment, and the 
whole teaching-learning process” 
Understanding the critical things that 
make a difference is one part of the story, the 
other is how countries go about changing 
their ways. “Nearly every single policy 
document mentions girls’ education, it’s 
almost as if it’s the politically correct 
language to use,” says Mlama. “But 
governments don’t have the capacity and 
commitment to really do something.” Many 
education ministries, for example, have set up 
gender or girls’ education units, “often staffed 
by one or two people who don’t have the 
skills and capacity to influence overall 
educational policy.” In meetings on education 
reform, she continues, “they’ll be called in 
towards the end of the process or at the final 
meeting with donors.” 
Addressing the bias 
Outside pressure is founded upon 
irrefutable evidence: educating girls and 
women has a significant impact on reducing 
poverty. Benefits include lower fertility and 
infant mortality rates, better health and 
nutrition, higher productivity and chances 
that the next generation will in turn be 
educated. But shaking up bureaucratic, 
patriarchal structures might well be the most 
mammoth task of all.“Civil structures are 
often set up so that there is very limited 
incentive to invest in improvements and 
work towards goals and targets,” says Winter. 
Some examples of good practice involve 
skirting slow bureaucracies and vested 
interests. In India, for example, the state of 
Uttar Pradesh took advantage of a law on 
developing charities to set up a well-staffed 
“parallel” structure to push through a 
comprehensive package on girls’ education 
in rural areas. Women in the community walk 
girls to school, parent-teacher associations 
and principals reach out to homes where 
children aren’t enrolled, and local groups 
stress to mothers that schooling 1s a basic 
legal right. 
Such fine-tuned strategies can only bear 
fruit when countries are ready to take the 
first step, by addressing deeply set biases in 
their societies. Committed governments, say 
activists, can start changing the tide, from 
making education compulsory to delaying the 
age of marriage and opening their eyes to the 
realities of child labour. Otherwise, ten years 
down the road, millions of girls will still go 
missing from the classroom, keeping the wheel 
of poverty turning [|

### 122627: Community schools: Egypt's celebrity model

of a new learning experience   
Community schools: 
Egypt's celebrity model 
Two hundred schools in deprived hamlets of Upper Egypt are sending ripples 
through the country’s education system, making girls and women the beacons 
REDE 2ST 
Plenty of fun keeps everyone's attention. 
MALAK ZAALOUK 
EDUCATION SECTION CHIEF, UNICEF CAIRO 
| her in n N | ; ity schools came to 
the ezbah—hamlets along the Nile that are 
islands amidst an arid desert landscape— 
theystarted from Scratch, in places with no 
basic services. While some districts are 
ious for their seclusion of girls and 
women, the overriding obstacle to schooling 
was distance and economic duress. “We 
wish all girls, women and men of the village 
would get an education,” said an elderly 
man from Helba, a hamlet in the governate 
of Assiut,“but we cannot afford it,nor can 
we allow our girls to go to far places on 
their own.” 
In most rural areas of the south, girls’ 
net enrolment rates range from 50 to 70 
percent, compared with 90 percent 
nationally. In the most extreme cases, only 
12 girls are enrolled for every 100 boys. 
Although the government tried to reach 
these groups in the 1970s through small 
multigrade schools, population growth, 
combined with economic strife and 
teachers’ low qualifications, led to high 
absentee rates, and the initiative gradually 
disappeared. 
From the outset, we were in this 
 endeavour with communities and the 
Ministry of Education. Communities donate 
space, ensure that children come to class 
and manage the schools through an 
education committee in each hamlet. The 
Ministry pays facilitators and provides 
textbooks while UNICEF 1s responsible for 
the overall development of the programme. 
Lifting the economic barriers was a first 
step: rooted in communities, the schools 
are close to the home. Timetables are 
flexible and all hidden costs are knocked 
out, from uniforms to schoolbags. But the 
other pivotal dimension is quality. Parents 
take it for granted that their sons will go to 
school. This is not the case with girls: you 
have to prove the experience is worth it. 
Tapping 
creative talents 
Our model relies on active learning. 
After intensive training, young facilitators— 
women chosen from the area with an 
intermediate school certificate—know how 
to transform the contents of the government 
curriculum into activities, such as cards, 
games, etc. They enhance it with subjects 
suited to local interest, such as health, 
environment, agriculture and local history, 
and encourage self-directed activities, 
learning by doing and in small groups.

A plethora of hand-made curricula has 
flourished over the years, which were on 
loan to the curriculum development centre 
for a year. The centre invited the facilitators 
to help produce learning guides in math 
and Arabic for grades one to three, which 
will be distributed to some 3,500 multigrade 
classroom schools in rural areas. These have 
been launched by the government, on the 
basis of the community school model. 
Now we are designing teacher training 
in tandem with government and 
implementing it ourselves:in short,we are 
training a whole new corps of inspectors, 
supervisors, headmasters and teachers in 
this new “active learning” pedagogy. We 
are gradually negotiating with regular 
schools to assess children’s achievement 
other than through regular exams. 
If we are making headway, it is also 
because we have been fortunate to benefit 
from highly committed policymakers. From 
the outset, the initiative has not been 
regarded as a project, but as a contribution 
to national educational reform. Since 1995, 
an Education Innovations Committee has 
been systematically working to incorporate 
new pedagogies in mainstream schools. 
Beyond reaching the hard to reach, namely 
girls, this model is showing the way to 
changing the classroom experience for all. 
Since the programme was launched, we 
have reached some 6,000 children, and 
female enrolment stands at 70 percent. The 
real barrier lies in girls continuing their 
education, even though evaluations show 
that our graduates pass government exams 
with flying colours. The first lady, a longtime 
defender of education,has given prizes to 
community school graduates, to the tune 
of nationwide media coverage. Within 
communities, the schools are catalysts for 
more profound changes: we are seeing 
facilitators publicly declare they will only 
marry a man who lets them continue 
teaching, and 12-year-olds convincing their 
parents to postpone marriage until they 
graduate. Slowly, girls are gaining a voice in 
areas far from the city walls. [|

SCIENCE A 
The rniddl 
A i our hundred years ago, Giordano Bruno suffered an unenviable fate: his 
tongue gagged, the Italian astronomer was burnt at the stake for 
maintaining, among other things, that each star in the sky is a sun like 
Bl our own and space is infinite. Like it or not, modern science has proved 
him largely right. Our universe is of daunting size, mysterious origin and 
unfathomable purpose. 
The frontiers of cosmology explored in this issue lie far beyond the 
human scale. Using the renowned big bang theory of creation (pp. 18- 
20;pp. 26-27), scientists have deployed telescopes, mathematics and 
particle collisions to plunder further through the first moments of time. Could an 
inconceivably fast expansion have ballooned the early universe (p. 21)? Might we 
inhabit a distorted strip of reality, unable either to observe the deep structure of matter 
(pp. 22-23) or discern the vast optical illusion that is in fact the universe (pp. 24-25)? 
Yet while each new theory strives to fill a gap in our understanding, science may be nearing 
its own limits. The sheer improbability of life remains unexplained (pp. 28-29),while no 
cosmic theory seems free of deep 
metaphysical assumptions (pp. 30- 
31).Centuries after being displaced 
from the heavenly bodies, could God 
once again be the answer to our 37 4 
doubts (pp. 32-35)? Or is that just a fo hil a ; 
get-out clause, to be replaced by a a 
theory of multiple recycled universes 
not unlike those of Hindu myth (pp. 
35-36)? 
The consolations lie in awe of our 
ineffable and sublime origins. The 
cost may be in knowing (see the short 
story on p. 37) that all we leave 
behind is a very faint noise.

### 122628: A Phoenix of human nature

ND CREATION 
e In the skies 
  
O PI NI ON 
A PHOENIX OF HUMAN NATURE 
BY SARA SCHECHNER 
DAVID P. WHEATLAND CURATOR OF THE COLLECTION OF HISTORICAL SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS, HARVARD UNIVERSITY 
Since ancient times, people have 
marvelled at the night sky and sought 
answers to profound questions there. What 
are the heavenly bodies? What moves them? 
How do they affect one another? Where are 
they? And how do they affect us? These are 
questions of cosmology, and each age and 
culture has produced its own answers. 
To the modern astronomer, acceptable 
answers come from physics. But if I may 
point my telescope not just towards deep 
space but also back in time, I would suggest 
that modern answers continue to draw upon 
deep-seated cultural values. 
Religion, social practices and 
observational astronomy have long been 
intertwined in the development of 
cosmological beliefs. The ancient Egyptians 
observed the dawn risings of key stars and 
from them established not only their 
agricultural calendar and civil timekeeping, 
but also their religious rites. Two thousand 
years of observations gathered by 
Babylonian astronomer-priests gave rise to 
mathematical planetary astronomy, which 
Greek philosophers such as Aristotle used as 
the basis for their physical models of the 
cosmos. Aristotle’s cosmos was structured, 
hierarchical, finite, and compatible with the 
tenets of Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. 
God was Prime Mover of the planets and the 
unmoved foundation of a stable world 
system. 
In the 17th century, the Aristotelian 
cosmos gave way to the Newtonian world 
view. Looking out into an infinite universe, 
Isaac Newton showed how the motions of the 
stars, planets, and comets were all governed 
by universal gravitation.Comets circulated 
vital spirits and fuel to the stars, but could 
also slam into worlds, causing mass 
extinctions and global destruction. 
In 1755, Immanuel Kant offered a 
physical theory on the origin and evolution of 
the universe. He described how universal 
forces of attraction and repulsion,acting on 
matter diffused throughout space, gave rise to 
instabilities in the chaos, leading to physical 
and chemical complexity. Denser regions 
gravitationally attracted lesser ones, while 
the action of repulsive forces caused in-falling 
matter to swirl around the dense centres. 
Over time, these vortices collapsed into stellar 
systems containing suns, planets, and comets. 
Creation thus spread out from a central 
point into the chaos and animated the whole 
region of infinite space. But Kant observed, 
“whatever has a beginning and origin, has the 
mark of its limited nature in itself; it must 
perish and have an end.” When a world- 
system exhausted all the manifold variations 
that its structure could embrace, it perished 
in a violent conflagration. The universe was, 
Kant envisioned, a “phoenix of nature, which 
burns itself only in order to revive again in 
restored youth from its ashes, through all 
the infinity of times and spaces.” 
Kant’s book was one of the earliest 
attempts to describe the origin and evolution 
of the cosmos under the influence of 
universal natural laws. Prior to Kant,it was 
commonly held that creation was fixed and 
the universe was maintained in a steady state. 
So where did Kant’s modern evolutionary 
ideas come from? From popular culture as 
remade by Newton. 
Until the 17th century, people believed 
that comets were divine signs heralding 
imminent world change. Newton appropriated 
this popular belief when he portrayed comets 
as natural agents deployed by God to create, 
renovate, or destroy heavenly bodies, thus 
melding popular beliefs with physics. This new 
approach gave license to those who held that 
material forces created new solar systems and 
the universe evolved according to natural laws. 
If popular beliefs were formative in the 
early development of modern cosmology, 
should we be worried that they continue to 
sully current science? Not at all. We can still 
celebrate the ways our diverse cultural 
heritages have shaped our scientific inquiries. 
Cosmology is ultimately a human endeavour. 
In asking questions about the deep past and 
distant future, it draws from many rich 
traditions and brings us closer together as 
human beings. [|

### 122629: From bang to eternity

 
From bang to eternity 
The big bang is now the accepted scientific account of how the universe 
came into being and started to evolve, but there is still much left 
that characterize how matter and radiation behave— 
the result is something that few scientists a century 
ago would have believed possible: a “physical standard 
model” of cosmology, comprehensive enough to take us 
back to the first few seconds of the universe’ existence, 
when atomic nuclei formed. Less defined and more 
speculative science promises to take us even further, 
possibly back to the very threshold of creation. 
The basic structure of the visible universe on the 
largest scales is now well understood: there are vast 
domains of empty space more or less uniformly 
populated by clusters of galaxies, with each galaxy 
itself being a dynamic configuration of about 100 billion 
stars interspersed with dust and gas. 
Furthermore, the fundamental motion of the 
cosmos is known: a uniform expansion of these clusters 
of galaxies, with distances between them ever-increasing 
equally in all directions. If we extrapolate backwards in 
time, this movement would suggest an ever higher 
density and temperature of matter and radiation, which 
at a certain point in the distant past—in conditions of 
the most extreme heat—coupled tightly together. 
Estimates of an origin to this expansion indicate it 
began around 10 billion years ago.

### 122629: From bang to eternity

THE RIDDLE IN THE SKIES 
  
At the extreme temperatures (over a billion degrees 
centigrade) of this initial phase, matter existed only as the 
most elementary particles in equilibrium with radiation. 
No more complex structures could survive the 
bombardment of the radiation at those temperatures. 
But as the universe expanded and cooled successively 
larger and more complex units could form: first of all, 
within the very first second of the cosmos, protons and 
neutrons from quarks, thus far among the most 
fundamental units of matter yet known to exist. Then,only 
minutes after the universe began, these protons and 
neutrons could combine into light atomic nuclei, a process 
known as nucleosythesis. 
Some 300,000 years later, As the universe for 
Some of the first generation stars ended their lives 
in massive supernova explosions, spreading through 
space the elements of organic life they had been 
forming in their interiors through successive nuclear 
reactions. The resulting clouds of dust then became 
the birthplace of second generation stars surrounded 
by planets, on which the molecules of life could find 
hospitable places to generate the first living cells and so 
provide the origin of complex living beings (see also 
pp- 26-27). 
There are three basic reasons for believing this 
picture of our universe's history. Firstly, estimates of the 
distances of galaxies (obtained 
example from their 
complete atoms were 
constructed from nuclei and expanded and cooled, 
luminosities) can be correlated 
with estimates of the speed at 
electrons—an episode called 
recombination. This event successively larger

basic evidence for the expansion 
of light-years, cooling all the 
while due to the expansion of the universe from a 
temperature of about 3,000 degrees Kelvin at emission 
to 2.75 Kelvin (270 degrees centigrade) today. This 
radiation, known as the cosmic microwave background 
radiation,provides the best map we now have of the 
very early universe. 
Once complete atoms were formed—mainly in the 
shape of hydrogen and helium—gravitation could pull 
matter together to form the first generation of stars, 
which clustered together to form galaxies, which in 
turn bunched together to form clusters of galaxies. 
of the universe. Secondly, the 
very existence of the cosmic background radiation is 
evidence that there was a hot early state of the universe, 
because its precise spectrum—exactly described by a 
theoretical formula deduced by Max Planck 100 years 
ago—shows that matter and radiation were in 
equilibrium at early times. Such equilibrium indicates 
that the early universe was very hot, for only at extreme 
high temperature can this balance come into being. 
A third piece of evidence comes from observation 
of the abundance of light elements in the universe, 
namely hydrogen, helium and lithium. Our theory Pp

hat are the major issues that remain for us to tackle? First,we want 
to know more about the geometry of the universe, both inside and 
outside the limits we can observe. The part of the universe we can see seems 
to be remarkably simple on the largest scales, being spatially homogeneous 
and isotropic (it looks the same in all directions). But the major parameters 
describing this region are only loosely known. Uncertainty in our estimates 
of the universe's age is about 20 percent, and needs to be improved, as do 
our estimates of the dark energy that is causing an accelerated expansion 
of the universe. We also want to know if sections of space close up on 
themselves, and if so, whether the scale of closure is such that we live in a 
“small universe” where we see multiple mirror images of the same galaxies 
(see pp. 24-25). 
Second, we want to know more about what the universe is made of. It is 
disappointing that we don’t know what kind of matter makes up the lion's 
share of the density of the universe, nor the nature of the force that 
presently dominates its expansion. Better understanding of these features 
is intimately tied in to a better understanding of the creation of large-scale 
structure in the universe. 
Third, we want to understand the very early universe better:in particular, 
what caused the mighty cosmic inflation? What came before inflation? What 
was the nature of creation,and what alternatives are there to creation? 
Though there are a wide variety of competing proposals, it proves very 
difficult to test them experimentally. To help resolve these, we need to extend 
our understanding of particle physics as far as we can so as to probe the 
interactions at work at the moment of creation and immediately thereafter. 
However far we extend experiments probing this physics, we will 
nevertheless be unable to attain the energies required to unlock 
experimentally the secrets of quantum gravity. 
There are thus clear limits to the testable laws of physics that underlie the 
cosmological account of creation. The challenge is to develop a coherent and 
convincing physical theory that is supported by tests insofar as they are 
possible. 
Fourth, we must grapple with the question of how to relate theory to 
observation in the exceptional context of a science with only one object of 
study—the single existing Universe. We lack a proper account of the limits 
of scientific proof in this context. One attempt to break this impasse is 
through the idea of an ensemble of universes (a “multiverse”), but it is not 
clear yet if this is a physical or a metaphysical proposal. [|

of how atomic nuclei were formed in the hot early 
universe, based on knowledge of nuclear physics 
together with the hypothesis of an expanding universe, 
fits all these measurements just so long as the density 
of matter lies in a specific limited range—a remarkable 
confirmation of theory by observation. 
As a result, this cosmological history has come to be 
accepted by the scientific community. We have clear 
evidence that the universe emerged at vast speed from 
an initial fireball, though this event’s remoteness—and 
the enormity of space—obviously leaves a host of 
questions waiting to be answered, particularly as we try 
to understand its origins 
Recent observations have nevertheless filled in 
many details of the universe’s structure and history. We 
have been able to obtain estimates of the amount of 
matter in the universe, particularly from studies of the 
motions of galaxies and clusters of 
galaxies. On the basis of these We expected 
galaxies? 
The remarkable concept of inflation—a period 
of extremely rapid accelerating expansion in the very 
first fraction of a second of the universe’s life— 
potentially explains both features. Such an enormous 
expansion might first have smoothed out space, before 
quantum fluctuations? in this early force created areas 
of marginally different densities. Expansion, first 
inflationary and then decelerating, may then have 
spread such tiny variations over regions the size of 
galaxy clusters. From these beginnings, matter could 
then be pulled by gravity over billions of years into the 
stars and galaxies we are now so familiar with. 
Finally, some current studies of distant spectra give 
tantalizing hints that the nature of physics itself may be 
different at great distances, in places whose radiation 
emissions we are receiving billions of years after they 
were emitted. Might it be that 
the constants of nature vary with

deduce the presence of a large the expansion

theories of how matter clustered 
coming from the nucleosynthesis 
calculations mentioned above, we can deduce that 
most of this matter is not composed of protons and 
neutrons: in short, that it has an entirely different make- 
up to that of ordinary matter. 
We have also been able to get much better distance 
estimates than before for faraway galaxies, particularly 
by observing supernovae explosions in them and 
measuring the decaying light from these death throes of 
burnt-out stars. This has led to another unexpected 
discovery. We expected the expansion of the universe to 
be slowing down because of the gravitational pull of all 
matter, but in fact it seems to be accelerating. This must 
be attributed to some form of dark energy which, unlike 
the dark matter referred to above, acts like a negative 
gravitational field, tending to make all matter move 
ever faster apart. Consequently, it now seems clear that 
the universe will expand forever. 
Theories of how galaxies and galaxy clusters arose 
have also been subject to intensive research. By 
connecting data on the gravitational effects and 
distribution of galaxies with minute temperature 
fluctuations across the sky in the cosmic background 
radiation, we have been able to construct broad pictures 
of how large-scale structures emerged from small 
variations in density in the early universe. 
Yet these findings leave a major question begging: 
how can we possibly explain why the universe is so

hosting from very early on in its existence minute 
differences in density that served as the seeds of future

the creation of the universe? What of the possibility that

### 122630: And then there was inflation

1. SCIENCE AT THE LIMITS 
  
And then there was inflation 
The hottest theory of cosmology in the last 20 years is that of cosmic 
“inflation”—a burst of force in the very early universe that expanded a 
dot into almost boundless space. Professor Andrei Linde of Stanford 
University, one of the theory's chief exponents, explains 
INTERVIEW BY IVAN BRISCOE 
Unesco Courier JOURNALIST 
Why do we need a period of inflation in the 
universe's early history? 
Inflation explains several different things: why 
the universe is large, why it is homogeneous, why 
it looks approximately the same in all directions, 
why it started expanding simultaneously. It also 
explains how galaxies have been formed out of 
quantum fluctuations. 
Above all, we need to explain why different 
parts of the universe look approximately the same. 
Imagine that the universe just started. At the very 
earliest time we can consider [10% seconds after 
creation, called the Planck time], our universe was 
a fraction of a centimetre. In this time, light and 
radiation could only have travelled a tiny part of 
this space. So the left side of the universe could not 
know about the right, and the middle about neither 
of them:there was no time for such contact. Then 
all of a sudden we have a universe where 
everything is exactly the same. This looks like a 
miracle—something physicists do not expect. 
This is where inflation comes to the rescue. In 
the simplest version of the theory, inflation starts 
at the Planck time. Until 10% seconds, space would 
blow up by the power of 10 to the thousand billion, 
rather like an elastic membrane stretching in all 
possible directions at a speed faster than light to a 
size much larger than the universe you now see. 
Our universe would then be a tiny spot on a huge 
cosmic balloon. 
Is there any matter inside this expanding space? 
Usually people understand by matter particles 
that move, collide and build solid things that we can 
see. But there are also fields—electromagnetic 
fields for example. We do not see the magnetic 
field of the Earth, but we know that it is there. 
This field is also a kind of matter. 
Our assumption is that in the early universe, 
matter was in a very specific form called a scalar 
field. We do not see this field—it looks like a 
vacuum—but if it exists it may have a lot of 
energy. In a normal expanding universe the 
density of matter decreases, but the scalar field and 
its energy do not decrease, meaning space expands 
faster and for a much longer time. This leads to 
inflation. 
Gradually, however, the scalar field loses 
energy. It decays and produces normal particles, 
and the universe becomes hot as in conventional 
big bang theory. 
But where did these scalar fields come from? 
They could exist in the universe from the very 
beginning, just like any other matter. Those parts 
of the universe where these fields were small did 
not experience inflation and therefore remained 
very small.But regions of the universe with large 
scalar fields have grown up enormously. We live in 
one such region now. 
You have used the expression “cosmic tree” to 
describe the true universe What does this mean? 
Small fluctuations in the field are necessary for 
the later formation of galaxies. But if the 
fluctuations in this field are large, they could lead 
to the creation of new parts of the universe—not 
just galaxies, but places where the fields have 
different values, particles are lighter or heavier, 
and space and time different as compared to our 
part of the universe. These are so far away from us, 
however, that you will never have a chance of 
seeing them. 
You also call this inflation eternal. Does this mean it 
can happen again? 
It may happen at some distance from us now. 
It might also happen here, though you are not 
going to see it because inflation occurs when space 
is expanding from its own resources. If inflation 
happens near you,don’t worry—it’s not going to 
crush you. It’s just going to create a baby universe 
that you will not see. 
Twenty years ago, when inflation was invented, 
it looked like a piece of science fiction.Gradually 
it has become the standard cosmological theory, 
solving many problems and making important 
predictions that can be experimentally confirmed. 
We’ve tried hard doing something without 
inflation,but so far nothing else has worked. =m

everse the film of our universe’s history, 
and things seems to get mighty strange in 
the last reel. What began in physical 
harmony, propitious for planets, humans 
and domestic appliances, has reverted to 
hell: temperatures hotter than the sun’s core, an exotica 
of hysterical matter, forces rupturing asunder. Nudge 
the reel a bit further on, and the image abruptly 
switches from fury to a vague and peaceful nothing. 
It is not an ending—or rather a beginning—that 
satisfies too many people. Though little headway has 
been made exploring this peculiar transformation of 
nothing into hot and very excited everything, the 
issue has not been absent from scientific minds. If 
only to combat the allure of a “God particle” bent on 
generating the cosmos, science has searched for an 
alternative:not just a history of before the big bang, 
but some deeper reason for why, out of unfathomably 
chaotic stuff, should emerge a place where a hair- 
dryer works. 
  The Unesco Courier - May 2001 
Gabriele Veneziano is one of those who believes 
an answer may have been found.According to this 
leading Italian theoretical physicist,a deeper reality 
lies “under” the one we perceive. Superstrings, to be 
precise, vibrating away in 10 or 11 dimensions, creating 
and composing the entire universe from their 
minuscule shudders. 
Deciphering his account of how the universe 
came to be reads like an odyssey through 20th century 
physics. Superstring theory, and its many cousins in the 
domain of elementary particle physics, are offshoots 
of the two great theoretical inventions of the century’s 
first decades—general relativity and quantum 
mechanics. On the basis of the first, a convincing 
picture of the universe could be drawn back to an 
initial point, or “singularity,” of massive, possibly 
infinite density. Through the quantum world, vast 
leaps could be made in penetrating the atom, the 
components of the atom (protons, neutrons and 
electrons),and then,colossal equipment and minds 
permitting, the components of the components of 
the atom. 
Slam and see 
At that point, the two theoretical roots join as one. 
Assuming the universe is created in a blazing, 
primordial soup, then clearly the most basic units of 
matter will be those that prevail. Finding out what 
rules govern them is then the golden bridge towards 
understanding how the universe was made. 
Until the end of last year, a palm-sized pipe 
wrapped in potent magnets and circling beneath the 
Franco-Swiss border was the world capital for such 
investigations. Along this 27-kilometre pipe, a pair of 
electrons would pass 11,000 times a second—close to 
the speed of light—before hurtling to a splintering 
collision. Such is CERN, the European laboratory 
for nuclear research. The principle is simple: slam 
and see. 
Behind the principle lies a very basic formula, 
Einstein’s E=mc?, which establishes an equivalence 
between energy and mass. Accelerate a subatomic 
particle like an electron or proton, crash it into a 
partner, and the energies accumulated in its light- 
speed dash will be scattered into more massive, very 
short-lived particles—exactly the sort of particles 
that reigned in the early universe before gluing 
together as space cooled. 
The appetite of scientists has naturally not abated.

### 122631: What came before

THE RIDDLE IN THE SKIES 
  
By 2005,a new accelerator is due to be operating at 
CERN: the Large Hadron Collider, armed with a 
magnetic field 100,000 times that of the earth, 
interspersed with six-storey high detectors and able to 
take subatomic conditions back to those which held in 
the universe’s first picosecond (101% seconds). “We 
are going to be able to probe distances inside matter 
which are perhaps ten times smaller than we've seen 
before,” explains John Ellis, a senior physicist at the 
laboratory. 
Through theoretical work and experiments at 
this and other accelerators, scientists have already 
disaggregated the atom and the forces that rule its 
movements into a menagerie of over 60 particles A 
story of the universe has emerged:a tale of descent 
from high to low energy, in which primitive forces split 
(creating electricity), and unstable fundaments of 
matter convert their mass into the astonishing 
energies inhabiting every atom. 
The staircase of universes 
But the story is far from complete. It may be very 
well to enumerate and calculate the powers of quarks 
and spins of photons, yet how could such an 
encyclopaedic set of characteristics sprout so level- 
headedly from a meltdown? Perhaps more 
importantly, where does gravity fit in? Its supposed 
force-carrier, the graviton, has never been observed. 
The force itself appears alien to quantum theory. 
And its strength for each atom is derisory compared 
to the belligerence of the nuclear and electromagnetic 
forces:how else could a chair buttress you from the 
entire gravitational attraction of the planet? 
In search of an answer, the scientific community 
has appealed to the notion of unification. The deeper 
one gets into the interstices of matter, they argue, the 
more sweeping and elegant the formulae may become. 
The lust for a unified theory behind nature has 
prime targets in sight. In a last gasp of CERN’s old 
accelerator, the first experimental indications emerged 
of the so-called Higgs field,an arena of force like the 
electromagnetic field with which species of particles 
interact (or do not) and win their very unique masses. 
“Imagine you're cooking pasta,” says Ellis, “and you add 
olive oil. When it cools, the olive oil separates out. 
What we're trying to do in the new collider is boil the 
water so that we can see the differences evaporate.” 
Yet this still leaves the gravitational conundrum 
unresolved. John March Russell, a physicist at CERN, 
enthuses over one mind-bending possibility: that gravity 
is so weak in comparison to other forces because much 
of it is swallowed into other dimensions. Should this be 
the case, he says, the new collider may reveal more 
than just new particles:energy might be sucked away 
into the nether-world, or even more radically, tiny black 
holes may form for a fraction of a second. 
Such extra dimensions would appear to make 
elementary particles that bit more baffling, but the 
opposite is probably true:it may offer the first proof  
that strings exist. “Theoretically, the gravity problem 
and string theory fit together very nicely,” argues 
March Russell. 
But what precisely are these magical strings? For 
around 30 years, theorists have laboured over rival 
sets of formulae explaining how string-like 
phenomena, around 10? cm in length and thus 
invisible to all possible experiments, generate the 
entirety of known particles and forces, including 
gravity. If true, it would be the deepest theory ever 
encountered: the overarching law breathing form 
and function into the universe. 
Unfortunately, their infinitesimal size and 
supplementary dimensions have given the theory an 
air of high abstraction, but Veneziano, also of CERN, 
is undaunted. For him,the epoch of creation might 
have to be rewritten.“I see the big bang as a way to 
put string theory to the test. When you get very close 
to time zero, strings simply cannot fit into space.” 
The results are revolutionary. No infinitely dense 
singularity could exist at the start of the universe 
because of the strings’ irreducible size. Instead, a “pre- 
history” must be sketched in.“This could be a very 
long pre-history starting with an almost trivial, infinite 
universe filled with gravitational waves that barely 
interact at all,” says Veneziano. “The beginning of the 
process ending in the big bang is the occurrence of an 
overdense region leading to the formation of a black 
hole.” Within this hole, trapped waves start to interact 
in the form of strings. An early relative of gravity 
causes a lightning expansion of space, and at some 
critical and obscure moment,the era of strings cedes 
to the big bang, thus begetting the era of particles, 
planets and us. “What we have for most of the time 
before and after the big bang is a classical evolution,” 
he says. 
Major problems remain,above all in explaining 
why the underlying strings (or any other fundamental 
theory for that matter) do not lead to an utterly 
different set of physical laws But the thought is still 
a giddy one—that reality migrates along a staircase of 
universes, each step recumbent on the one before. “In

shape to something as intangible as space. For 
the physicist, the question only has meaning if 
couched in the language of geometry. So then 
the question becomes: how can geometry best 
represent physical space—the space we inhabit? 
The problem is much more complex than it 
first appears. There is no doubt that the space we

we ask what shape or

therefore, modern physics actually gives us a 
variety of answers depending on the level at which 
we are looking, 
Yet what exactly do we mean when we say 
that space is “curved”? The modern science of 
cosmology stems largely from the equations of 
general relativity formulated by Albert Einstein in 
the first two decades of the 20th century. According 
to these equations, all space is deformed, or rather 
curved, by the distribution of matter such as 
galaxies inside it. This curvature manifests itself as 
one of the universe’s most fundamental forces:

which we mean huge scales of over 10%° metres—it 
appears that the virtually uniform distribution of 
galaxies throughout the cosmos must curve space in 
a likewise uniform fashion. Aside from this constant 
curvature, the universe should also have an 
underlying dynamic: in other words, it can either be 
expanding or contracting, 
On the basis of Einstein’s equations, Alexander 
Friedmann and Georges 
Lemaitre discovered in 
the 1920s a set of 
models for such curved 
space. The most simple 
version points to so- 
called positive 
curvature, resembling a 
simple sphere that 
dilates from the big 
bang onwards to reach 
a maximum size before 
contracting back into a 
final “big crunch.” 
Space could also have 
no curvature or a 
negative curvature 
(forming a 
“hyperbolic” shape that 
resembles a saddle).In 
both of these cases, the 
universe expands 
forever, though the rate of expansion slows over 
time. 
Recent observations have suggested that cosmic 
space is in fact close to the “no curvature” model— 
in other words it is flat and almost Euclidean, like 
our normal understanding of space. But the data also 
indicates that the universe is expanding at an 
increasing rate, suggesting that some kind of 
“cosmological constant” is accelerating the 
expansion rate. This constant may be understood as 
the energy of empty space. 
But important questions remain. Can general 
relativity really give us a satisfactory description of 
the shape of space at the largest scales? It is, after all,

THE RIDDLE IN THE SKIES 
  
still unclear whether space is finite or infinite: a 
spherical universe would certainly be finite, but a 
Euclidean or negatively curved universe could be 
either finite or infinite. 
At this stage we need a new approach: that of 
topology, a branch of geometry devoted to exploring 
the properties that define particular spatial objects. 
Where the science of curvature falls shorts, topology 
can step in to tell us about the overall structure of 
space. 
Euclidean space can certainly be a lot more 
complicated than imagined. A surface with no 
curvature, for example, is not necessarily flat. All one 
has to do to prove this is take a rectangular piece of 
paper and stick it together at the edges to make a 
cylinder. Just as with the original flat piece of paper, 
the surface of the cylinder is still Euclidean. The 
cylinder’s surface thus still has no curvature, but 
unlike the flat paper, it is finite in one direction. 
This is the sort of property that topology, not 
curvature, can reveal.Cutting and sticking the flat 
piece of paper into various new shapes does not alter 
the curvature of the paper itself, but radically 
changes it overall shape—its topology. 
The dawn of 
ruffled space 
In space which is flat, any two points can be 
joined only by a single line, or geodesic—meaning 
simply a line in curved space. In what we call multi- 
connected space, on the other hand, an infinite 
number of geodesics join two points together, as can 
be seen in the diagram. It is this very property which 
gives such spaces extraordinary cosmological 
relevance. 
When we look at a faraway galaxy, we normally 
think that we are seeing just one unique object,in 
one particular direction and at one distance. But if 
cosmic space is multi-connected,rays of lights will 
replicate to produce multiple images of the observed 
galaxy. Since our entire perception of space comes 
from analysis of the trajectories of light rays, such a 
multi-connected space would mean we are plunged 
in a massive optical illusion that makes the universe 
appear much larger than it really is. Distant galaxies 
that we believe to be “original” would in fact be 
repeated images of a single galaxy. 
A “ruffled”’space would be just such a cosmos: 
a multi-connected domain of finite volume, whose 
size would be smaller than the observed universe 
(whose radius is around 15 billion light-years). This 
space would create a topological mirage that 
constantly repeated the images from shining 
sources—akin to standing in a hall of mirrors. 
Similar optical illusions are already well known 
by astronomers, and go under the name gravitational 
mirages. These occur when light from a distant 
object such as a quasar is bent by the effect of a 
massive body situated on its sightline. As a result, 
light rays from the star follow the curvature of

space and are scattered (see photo). What the 
observer sees is a group of phantom images 
surrounding the intervening heavy object (known by 
astronomers as a “lentil”). This sort of mirage can be 
directly ascribed to the local curvature of space 
around the lentil. 
In the event of a topological mirage, however, 
there is no single heavy body like a galaxy deforming 
space. Instead, space itself plays the role of a lentil: 
phantom images are distributed in all directions 
and for all their points in history across the entirety 
of space. Such a global mirage allows us to examine 
objects not only from every possible angle, but also 
from every possible phase in their evolution. 
For space to have this ruffled shape, it would 
have to be highly subtle and constructed over very 
large scales. If not, we would have already identified 
phantom images of our own galaxy and other well- 
known structures—a feat we have not yet achieved. 
So how can we then establish the true topology 
of the universe? One method, cosmic 
crystallography, attempts to pinpoint repetitions in 
the distribution of distant objects. Studies of 
fluctuations in the cosmic background radiation— 
a fossil from the big bang—might also indicate that 
space is ruffled by uncovering specific recurrences. 
Experimental projects in both fields are under- 
way, though neither the depth nor the resolution of 
observations are yet good enough to draw 
conclusions about space’s overall topology. The 
next few years, however, promise great things: deep 
surveys of distant galaxies and quasars along with 
new satellites probing background radiation. 
Perhaps we will soon be able to give a form to 
space. u 
A very simple two- 
dimensional universe 
illustrates how an observer 
in galaxy A (red) can see 
multiple images of galaxy B 
(yellow).This model of the 
universe, called a tore (a 
doughnut shape),is 
constructed from a square 
stuck together on two sides. 
Instead of one line linking 
the galaxies, light from 
galaxy B can now reach 
galaxy A by various routes; 
as a result, the observer in 
galaxy A sees images of 
galaxy B from various 
directions.Though the tore is 
finite, the observer is under 
the illusion that space is 
much larger than it really 
it—his or her image of 
space is similar to a grid of 
repeated cells.

all known laws of space and time break down. Speculation,however, has not abated: options 
for the first cause include a fluctuation in a field of quantum “foam,” a growth inside a Black 
Hole or the bounce from a self-annihilating parent universe. Theists prefer the hand of God.

Mysticism, WILL BE PUBLISHED NEXT YEAR. 
s science on the verge of explaining the mystery 
of existence, once and for all? Some prominent 
scientists are suggesting as much. They claim 
that unified theories of physics such as 
superstring theory, when combined with refined 
versions of the big bang model, will soon bequeath us 
a so-called “theory of everything.” As described by 
physicists such as Stephen Hawking, a theory of 
everything will be a kind of mystical revelation, 
which permanently transforms the “Huh?” of wonder 
evoked in us by our contemplation of nature into a 
great “Aha!” 
Those who find this vision of a wonderless world 
chilling rather than exhilarating should be assured 
that it will never be fulfilled. One of the great 
paradoxes of modern science is that the more it 
tells about about existence, the more 
mysterious existence becomes. 
The conundrum 
of reality 
Take the simplest question of 
all: Why is there something rather 
than nothing? The big bang 
theory, for all its power, cannot 
tell us why and how the big 
bang happened in the first 
place. Some physicists note 
that according to quantum 
mechanics, empty space is 
seething with so-called virtual 
particles, which spring into 
existence for an instant before 
vanishing; perhaps, these 
physicists speculate, the entire 
universe began as a kind of virtual 
particle. Honest physicists will 
nevertheless admit that they have 
absolutely no idea why there is 
something rather than nothing. After all, 
what produced the laws of quantum 
mechanics, which supposedly allowed quantum 
creation to occur? 
The next question is: Why does the universe 
look the way it does rather than some other way? 
Why does it adhere to these laws of nature rather 
The Unesco Courier - May 2001 
than some other laws? Altering any of those laws 
would have radically altered reality. If gravity had 
been infinitesimally stronger, the universe would 
have stopped expanding almost immediately after 
the big bang and collapsed into a black hole;a bit 
weaker, and the universe would have flown apart so 
rapidly that stars, galaxies and planets would never 
have formed. The physicist Lawrence Krauss 
compares the odds against gravity

cosmos to exist to the odds against someone guessing 
precisely how many atoms are in the sun. 
Then there is the enigma of life. The biologist 
Richard Dawkins once declared that life “is a 
mystery no longer”because it had been solved by 
Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection. 
Actually, life is still a complete conundrum, in spite 
of all the insights provided by evolutionary theory 
and more modern biological paradigms, such as 
genetics and molecular biology. None of these fields 
can tell us why life appeared on earth in the first 
place, and whether it was a probable event or a 
once-in-eternity fluke. 
Dawkins and others proclaim that life is a robust 
phenomenon that occurs throughout the universe, 
but there is no scientific evidence to support this 
belief. After decades of searching, we have found 
no signs of life elsewhere in 
the universe. As far

as we know, life emerged here on earth only once, 
approximately 3.5 billion years ago. Moreover, 
attempts to replicate the origin of life in the 
laboratory have left researchers more baffled than 
ever at how it occurred. The Nobel prize winner 
Francis Crick once complained that “the origin of 
life appears to be almost a miracle, so many are 
the conditions which would have to be satisfied to 
get it going.” Crick, it should be noted, is an agnostic 
leaning toward atheism. 
Scanning the heavens 
for signals 
Many scientists have contended that once life 
started evolving on the earth, it was only a matter of 
time before it produced a species as complex as we 
are. But the history of life on earth does not support 
such a view. For roughly 80 percent of life’s 3.5- 
billion-year span, it consisted entirely of single- 
celled organisms, such as bacteria and algae. Then 
something happened—biologists will probably 
never know exactly what—and the era of trilobites, 
triceratops, taxi-drivers and other multi-cellular 
creatures commenced. 
The palacontologist Stephen Jay Gould 
has pointed out that contingency—just 
plain luck—has played an enormous 
role in the emergence of Homo 
sapiens. If life on earth started 
from scratch a million times over, 
Gould contends, chances are it 
would never again produce 
mammals, let alone anything 
resembling Homo sapiens. 
Similarly, the biologist 
Ernst Mayr suspects that 
we may be the only life 
forms in the galaxy and 
possibly the entire 
universe capable of 
inventing radios and other 
communications 
technologies. For that reason, 
Mayr believes that SETI—the 
search for extra-terrestrial 
intelligence, which scans the 
heavens for extra-terrestrial radio 
transmissions—is doomed to fail. 
The particle physicist Steven 
Weinberg once wrote: “The more the 
universe seems comprehensible, the more it 
seems pointless.” My analysis of science suggests 
a corollary aphorism:the more the universe seems 
comprehensible, the more it seems improbable. The 
most wildly improbable feature of the universe is the

ince the dawn of civilization, humankind 
has marvelled at the skies and at Nature's 
myriad creations. This sense of wonder was 
deeply interwoven with a sense of fear: 
Nature’s dual role as creator and destroyer 
has puzzled and polarized our perceptions of the 
cosmos. As a way of establishing a degree of control 
over the apparent unpredictability of natural 
phenomena, gods were held responsible for these 
conflicting manifestations. In short, Nature was deified. 
The question of why there is something rather 
than nothing was a crucial part of this process. All 
cultures have attempted to provide an answer to the 
mystery of creation, and our modern scientific 
tradition is no exception. Perhaps more surprisingly, 
there is an intriguing correspondence between 
answers suggested by mythic narratives and those 
suggested by scientific research. The crucial 
difference, of course, is that the 
scientific process is capable of 
weeding out explanations To understand Nature 
created out of nothing, without the interference of 
a god; this is what the Maori people of New Zealand 
have in mind when they sing, “from nothing the 
begetting, from nothing the increase. . ..” A final 
possibility is that the world appeared spontaneously 
from a primordial Chaos, where order coexists with 
disorder, Being with Non-Being. 
The religious nature of the creation event has 
permeated scientific thought since its origins in 
Ancient Greece in the sixth century BC. As the 
Greek philosophers pondered the physical 
mechanisms that created the world and controlled 
its motions, many assumed an organizational 
principle based on rational design, attributed to a 
“Demiurge” by Plato or to the “Unmoved Mover” 
by Aristotle. Plato was a true heir of the Pythagorean 
tradition, which saw the world as a manifestation of 
Number, arranged and combined to create the 
harmonies perceived by the 
senses. The emphasis on a 
creation event was somewhat

kinds: either the cosmos 
appeared at a specific moment 
in time marking the beginning of history, or it has 
always been “there.” Myths with a creation event 
describe time in a linear fashion,with a beginning, 
middle and, as in the Christian narrative, an end. 
Myths without a creation event may consider time 
to be either unimportant or cyclic. Within these 
two sets, we encounter an enormous variety. Starting 
with the “no creation myths,” the two possibilities 
are: an eternal, uncreated cosmos, as in the narrative 
of the Jains of India, or a cyclic cosmos, continuously 
created and destroyed, as beautifully represented in 
the Hindu tradition by the dance of Shiva. 
The first and by far the most common “myth 
with creation” invokes a deity or deities who create 
the world, as in the Judaeo-Christian myth of 
Genesis. A second possibility is that the world was

This tradition reappeared in the West during

The great natural philosophers that spearheaded the 
so-called Copernican Revolution were all, to a 
greater or lesser degree, deeply religious men, who 
saw their scientific work as an integral part of their 
religious beliefs. Thus, Copernicus himself was a 
canon of the cathedral in Frauenberg, a reluctant 
revolutionary who sought to reconcile the 
arrangement of the celestial spheres with the 
Platonic ideal of circular motions with constant 
velocities. His model of the solar system was an 
elegant compromise between the old and the new, 
looking back at Plato and forward at the aesthetic 
principles of his time. His great opus, On the

THE RIDDLE IN THE SKIES 
  
Revolutions of the Heavenly Orbs, was dedicated to 
Pope Paul III, in the hope that the Church would 
recognize the need for a reinterpretation of the 
Scriptures based on the new astronomical thought. 
It was through the work of Giordano Bruno 
and, more importantly, Johannes Kepler and Galileo 
Galilei, that the Copernican Revolution was 
enacted. Kepler was deeply influenced by the 
Pythagorean tradition, a number mystic who 
believed geometry to be the key to the cosmic 
harmony. His three laws of planetary motion are a 
powerful illustration of how the scientific output of 
a great mind can be a byproduct of a belief system 
tempered by the analysis of data. 
No final truths 
Galileo’s now famous tribulations with the 
Church were also a product of his beliefs. A pious 
(and overconfident) man, Galileo took as his 
personal mission to reset the course of Christian 
theology, preaching to the Church leaders the 
importance of accepting the new cosmic design. 
The clash was unavoidable, and in 1633 Galileo 
was forced to abjure his conviction in the 
Copernican system.Not for long, though,for soon 
after Isaac Newton put forward his three laws of 
motion and his universal theory of gravity in 1687, 
the sun-centered cosmos became widely accepted. 
To Newton, the cosmos was a manifestation of 
God’s glory, infinite in extent and sublime in design. 
During the twentieth century, the Newtonian 
universe was substituted by a curved Einsteinian 
universe;Einstein showed how matter and energy 
can bend space and alter the flow of time, endowing 
them with an unprecedented plasticity. Nowhere 
is this more spectacularly displayed than in the 
expansion of the universe itself, discovered by Edwin 
Hubble in 1929. Once again, the question of origins 
came back to haunt scientists: if the universe is 
expanding, there was a moment in time when all 
matter was squeezed into a very small volume. 
Astronomy was proclaiming that the universe did 
have an origin, after all.A cry of dissent emerged 
from Cambridge University via the proposal of the 
“steady-state model,” where the universe never 
had a beginning in time. With the discovery that the 
whole cosmos is immersed in a bath of microwave 
radiation in the 1960s, the steady-state model was 
abandoned by most cosmologists; the “big-bang 
model” has since been accepted as the one which 
best fits the data. 
Can science “explain” the age-old question of 
Creation? Certainly, physical models describing the 
origin of the cosmos can and have been proposed, at 
least since the 1970s. But these models face a serious 
technical obstacle: the lack of a proper theory to 
describe physical processes at the enormous energy 
scales prevalent during the first moments of cosmic 
history. They could be called scientific creation

narratives, at least until they can be placed on more 
solid theoretical ground. We see old themes coming 
back, dressed in scientific jargon. In some models the 
universe was born out of “nothing,” a quantum 
vacuum populated by all sorts of ephemeral energy 
fluctuations;others see the beginning as essentially 
chaotic, with an ordered cosmos emerging 
homogeneously in three dimensions 
Some of these models of creation make 
predictions about measurable properties of the 
universe, which can be used to test and refine them. 
Yet it may be hard to rule out all alternative models, 
which may also be compatible with these 
measurements. The best that we can hope for is a 
Copernicus’ vision of the planets, from a 17th-century illustration. 
workable model of cosmic origins, compatible with 
observations but open to changes. Scientific inquiry 
is after all an ongoing process—there is no final 
truth, only approximations to the truth. 
Furthermore, science, at least as it is formulated at 
present, cannot answer questions concerning its 
own origin: we do not know why the universe 
operates according to the laws we have uncovered 
and not others. This essential incompleteness of 
science suggests a new form of complementarity 
between science and religion; religion does not exist 
to cover the holes of our scientific knowledge, but 
as a driving force behind scientific inspiration. 
Through our search for knowledge we uncover our 
true nature, fuelled by the same sense of mystery 
which filled our ancestors with awe. [|

### 122637: Towards a final theory

Steven Weinberg *: Towards a final theory 
“I'm reasonably sure that we will have a final theory from which all the 
regularities in nature can be deduced, but | am also reasonably sure that 
the final theory will leave us with a mystery: why isn't the theory 
something else, such as a theory with nothing at all, or a theory with just 
two particles endlessly in orbit around each other. The best we can hope to 
do is discover a theory that is logically fragile, in the sense that any small 
change in the theory would lead to logical contradictions. 
On a more mundane level, there are limits to science that are not so 
fundamental but as a practical matter we will probably not be able to 
transcend. For example, the final theory may very well be something like 
string theory, but | cannot conceive of how we will ever directly produce 
structures that are 17 powers of ten smaller than those probed in the 
laboratory today. Likewise there's a wide class of cosmological theories in 
which our big bang is one of many that go off all over the universe, though 
in principle we will never observe the others. In both cases the theory will 
be successful or not depending on whether its predictions for things we 
can observe are correct. 
As for religion, whatever reasons it provides still raise the question of why: 
why should there be deities with certain characteristics? In fact the more 
you learn of physics, the less you see of what may be regarded as 
purpose.”

Physics (1979)

John Leslie*: Inside the divine mind 
“Cosmology can give us speculative stories that are very much worth 
taking seriously. But at the moment science cannot give us any confidence 
that these stories are correct. The stories are all about how this universe 
came into existence against the background of the laws of physics, and 
there's a question of why there are any laws of physics, and why they 
should apply to anything. 
Let's suppose you had a completely empty situation.What would there be 
in that situation which could create a universe? Well, first note that the 
situation couldn't be entirely empty because it would be full of all sorts of 
facts—for example, the fact that 2+2=4. | don't think you can get rid of 
facts like that just by banishing the universe from existence because these 
are facts about possibilities and hold no matter what. There would also be 
ethical facts:for example, it would be a fact that the emptiness was in one 
respect bad because you could have a really good situation instead, a 
wonderful cosmos. 
If Plato was right in thinking that Value itself acts creatively, then the 
cosmos must be the very best possible cosmos. It then consists of an 
infinite number of minds, each knowing everything worth knowing:minds 
we might want to call divine. The structure of the universe is just one of 
the things worth knowing, and all of us exist inside one of those divine 
minds. This is a pantheistic view—that the structure of the cosmos is 
simply the structure of divine thinking.”

THE RIDDLE IN THE SKIES 
  
religion were completely separate and insulated from 
each other. Because they belong to totally different 
areas of knowledge, he added, science and theology not 
only do not overlap, but are so far apart they cannot 
even influence one another. 
This conclusion is not upheld by other supporters 
of dissonance. According to the NOMA (Non- 
Overlapping Magisteria) principle proposed by U.S. 
palacontologist Stephen Jay Gould? andothers, science 
and religion supply magisteria—fields of knowledge— 
that do not encroach on each other, but are not entirely 
separate; an intimate dialogue is possible between 
them.Gould uses the metaphor of oil and water, two 
elements that do not mix but can remain in very close 
contact. The contours of their separation are complex 
and fluid, since both can move back and forth into 
places occupied moments before by the other. Science 
and religion, in short, are inseparable but radically 
different, friends but never partners. 
Transcendental gaps 
Not true say the supporters of “correspondence,” 
who base their viewpoint on the notion that scientific 
data can be directly useful to religion. According to this 
approach,concepts in these two fields can link up or 
even agree, so that theories of the bigbang and Creation 
may interact to their mutual advantage. But this 
position raises a host of questions, particularly over the 
nature of knowledge:is science not impoverished or 
cheapened by confusing all or part of it with religion? 
Does a concept such as Creation not mean very 
different things in different religious traditions and in 
the mouths of scientists, for whom it has a precise 
technical significance?

they are proved true.

Michael Heller*: The limits of scientific understandin g 
“There is a great temptation for the scientist to identify the limits of 
rationality with the limits of scientific method—or, to put it in a more 
picturesque way, to identify the limits of the method with the limits of the 
universe. This temptation is so powerful because the scientific method is 
the easiest kind of rationality and can efficiently distinguish what is 
scientifically valuable information from what is not. 
The nature of the big bang is a purely scientific problem. To “explain”it as 
a result of God's action is like ascribing thunder to the bad temper of Zeus. 
| think the really important question lies elsewhere:namely, where do the 
laws of physics come from? 
There are currently two ways of answering this. One is to show that on a 
fundamental level there reigns complete anarchy and the laws of physics 
are just effects of purely random averaging processes. The other is to 
imagine a set of all possible universes, each of them with different physical 
laws. We then happen to be living in a highly ordered universe because in 
all other universes the life of beings like ourselves is excluded.But can such 
probabilities be an ultimate explanation? Why does the universe—or the 
set of all universes—have this property of probability? Here, | think,we are 
touching the real limits of our understanding of the universe. 
The only way to get rid of such questions is not to ask them. But that 
would go against a criterion of critical rationality:one should not cease to 
look for further arguments as long as something remains to be argued 
for."

### 122640: The Beauty of the world

Tsevi Mazeh*: The beauty of the world 
“Science cannot tell us why and what for, and in a sense science is limited 
to the technical details of how the world works. | think there is no problem 
with saying God was in the beginning, that God set the world rolling and 
decided upon its rules. But as for the question of God interfering during the 
history of the universe—that is something | believe, but which | do not 
fully understand. 
My religion [Orthodox Judaism] does not influence my work as an 
astronomer, but it does make me appreciate God and the beauty of the 
world. | have been teaching a course on binary stars, in which there is a 
mathematical formula describing perfectly the stars" motion.In my eyes it 
is a miracle that the human mind can find such beautiful mathematical 
tools to explain the motion of the world—I see that as one of the miracles 
of the world that God created. 
As for Chapter 1 of Genesis, you have to realize that it has a core and it 
has details. The core is the theological message:there is one unified God. 
When the Bible was written, this was a complete revolution and actually 
doesn’t make sense when you look upon the world and see its forces 
fighting each other. The writer of Genesis had to convey this message in 
some cosmological terms, so he chose the cosmology of his day. He could 
not mention the big bang, the speed of light or atoms. Instead, he spoke 
in terms understandable to the people of that time.”

### 122636: The Highest summit: God meets the big bang

  
scientists have no quantum theory of gravitation to 
describe what happened in the first few moments after 
the big bang—there is a scientific gap to be filled—the 
initial creative impulse is attributed to divine power. But 
God provides no explanation at all. Reduced to a 
simple physical cause within other physical causes, 
God also loses his divinity to become just another 
element in the material world. 
Dissonance avoids this trap by allowing a calm 
dialogue between scientists and theologians that 
respects each other’s independence of thought: they 
agree not to exploit bits of each other’s field of 
knowledge to advance their own. But is this division 
perhaps too radical, depriving each side of elements that 
could be useful for their own thinking? 
Thus the need for a third position that rejects all 
blending of science and theology advocated by 
supporters of correspondence, but establishes an 
indirect dialogue between them via a go-between— 
philosophy in the broadest sense. The dialogue is also 
asymmetrical, since it encourages theological debate on 
the basis of scientific knowledge rather than the other 
way round. 
This perspective begins by recognizing that science 
inevitably raises philosophical questions which it cannot 
answer, such as ones about meaning and ethics. 
Philosophers can then draw on religious traditions 
among other resources to search for answers. These 
answers are of little use to scientists in their everyday 
research, but may help them deal with the kind of 
questions every human being runs up against. And 
theology in turn can benefit from philosophical work 
inspired and fertilized by science. This pathway from 
science towards religion is thus the fruit of work that has 
to be carried out continually as scientific knowledge 
advances: questions are raised, and philosophical 
responses generated that must at some stage take 
account of religion. 
Unravelling 
the beginnings 
Let’s go back to the example of the big bang. A 
scientist from the school of correspondence could 
say it was equivalent to Creation in the theological 
sense. But this assertion would not be scientifically 
legitimate:physics is based on natural causes alone, 
while Creation comes from divine and therefore 
metaphysical intervention. As a result, the issue of the 
purely physical origin of the universe “remains 
entirely separate from any metaphysical or religious 
question,” according to Lemaitre. The theory of the 
big bang hence does not presuppose any special 
religious belief, contrary to what some scientists 
thought in the 1950s. 
Dissonance, which rules out all dialogue between 
cosmology and theology, is no more satisfactory. But an 


### 122641: Cosmological evolution

Lee Smolin*: Cosmological evolution 
“A key issue is understanding the fine-tuning of the universe: how did it 
come to be that the parameters that govern elementary particles and their 
interactions are tuned and balanced in such a way that a universe of such 
variety and complexity arises? The probability that a universe created by 
randomly choosing the parameters will contain stars is one chance in 
107%, 
The universe is improbable, and it is improbable in the sense that it has a 
structure which is much more complex than it would be if its laws and 
initial conditions were chosen more randomly. Thus we seek a kind of 
explanation which is checkable, which is falsifiable, and which is based on 
some hypothesis of natural phenomena. Broadly speaking, biology and 
natural selection are the most successful examples of a theory that 
addresses such questions. 
In the case of the universe, this leads to the hypothesis of cosmological 
natural selection:in other words, that our elementary particles are the way 
we find them because they make the production of black holes, and thus 
the production of new “universes,” much more likely. 
If it is true that the big bang was not the beginning of the universe but an 
event that came from another part of the universe, whether a black hole 
or something else with a prior structure, then it's very possible that 
observations over the next few decades will help us—just as by studying 
the ripples in water, you can measure the shape of the rock that caused 
them.”

### 122642: Be, and there is

    
Seyyed Hossein Nasr*: Be, and there is 
“Science by its very nature can deal only with one level of existence, physical 
existence. Science also relies on the study of events in time and space. The 
scientist therefore pushes towards the beginning, but find its impossible to 
get to the beginning itself since it is beyond material existence and beyond 
the spatial or temporal.In contrast, most religions—with exceptions, such as 
Confucianism—nhave spoken about the origin of the universe. 
Those who accept the religious point of view, such as myself, can say a great 
deal about the origins of the universe. We believe that the reality which 
brought the universe into being has also sent us a revelation in knowledge of 
the origin of that universe. In the case of Islam, this revelation comes first of 
all from the Koran, which describes the creation of the universe as coming 
from the word of God, recounted in the very famous verse of Chapter 36 in 
which God says “Be, and there is.” 
Until the 17th century, science from East to West was aimed at studying the 
traces of God's wisdom in his creation. But the Cartesian philosophy that 
undergirds the scientific revolution created a division between the knowing 
subject and the known object: modern science considered its goal to be the 
study of pure quantity, and tore away all qualitative aspects of nature—all 
its spiritual elements. 
Every ten years there are new cosmological theories and views. But | do not 
really take these to be steps towards understanding the ultimate structure of 
the universe since we are dealing with so many unknowns. It's as if you knew 
one inch of a line and extrapolated it straight to the moon.”

intermediate philosophical discussion about the 
meaning of the big bang as the physical origin of the 
cosmos can help theologians unravel the links and 
differences between notions of physical beginning, 
metaphysical beginning and divine Creation,and see 
more clearly the purely theological meaning of the 
latter. 
Creation in the theological sense can mean the 
sudden physical appearance of the world for divine 
reasons, but it can also mean a relation that God uses 
to keep the universe in existence by giving it physical 
shape. This “sudden appearance” cannot be regarded as 
the start of a process in physical time because it is itself 
the origin of space, time and matter. 
Furthermore, this “Creation link” cannot be seen as 
a physical cause because it is in fact the cause of all 
physical causes. New theological ways of describing 
the relations between time and eternity, between God 
and the world, can flow from this philosophical 
clarification. It also makes for better understanding of 
the range and limits of science. 
For some, science and religion are inseparable but 
very different friends. For others, they are friends only 
linked by a third party. For get others they are friends 
that are in fact true twins. And finally, they are viewed 
as two people who are not friends at all because they 
never meet. In short, a set of bonds running all the 
way from fusion to fission. n

here is no single Hindu myth of origin. There 
are as many myths as there are texts; 
sometimes, the same text has more than one. 
The earliest myths date back to the Rig Veda, 
the first of the four Vedas, composed over a 
period of time, though certainly before 1000 BC, and 
eventually committed to writing many centuries later. 
Contrary to what some believe, the bulk of Rig 
Vedic hymns—all told, there are 1028 of them, spread

### 122643: Out of butter and water: the Hindu creation

Out of butter and water: the 
In the classic myths of Hinduism, there is no primeval emptiness: 
just different stages of gods and the universe, recycling themselves 
consisting mostly of tributes to an entire pantheon of 
anthropomorphic gods. But books one and ten, which 
coincide with the emergence of varna, the four-fold 
hierarchical division of society, which rapidly led to the 
proliferation of hundreds of castes, also contain the 
origin hymns. 
The most celebrated of these is the hymn that 
contains the earliest known reference to varna. 
Creation is the result of the sacrifice of Purusha (Man), 
the primeval being, who is all that exists, including 
“whatever has been and whatever is to be.” When 
Purusha, who had “a thousand heads, a thousand eyes, 
a thousand feet” was sacrificed, the clarified butter 
that resulted was made into the beasts which inhabit

the earth. This same sacrifice produced the gods, Indra 
(the menacing king of gods), Agni (Fire), Vayu (Wind), 
as well as the Sun and the Moon. From Purusha’s 
navel the atmosphere was born; his head produced 
the heaven; his feet produced the earth; his ear the sky. 
The four varnas were born too: the mouth was the 
brahman (priest); the arms the kshatriya (warrior); 
the thigh the vaishya (general populace );the feet the 
shudra (servant). 
Primeval incest is the other method by which 
creation takes place in the Rig Veda, and this idea 
recurs throughout Hinduism. Later mythology claims 
Manu, the first man, gave birth to the human race 
through the act of incest; Manu himself is also born of 
incest that the creator indulges in. By the time we 
come to the texts known as the Puranas (dates between 
300 and 1500 AD), the story of creation becomes more 
complex: the creator of the universe was the god 
Brahma, who came from the primeval waters, and was 
swayambhu (self-existent). Brahma transformed 
himself into a giant boar (varaha) to bring forth the 
earth from the depths of these waters. The first man, 
  
    
Brahma (centre-top) emerges from a lotus flower. 
Manu, was born directly of Brahma. Manu was a 
hermaphrodite, and created two sons and three 
daughters from his female half 
What is striking in all this, of course, is that none of 
these stories actually say how the universe began. 
There is no sense of things being created out of nothing, 
the stuff of the universe only happening to be reused 
and recycled periodically, like in a giant ecofriendly 
enterprise. In a sense, of course, this is a natural 
outcome of the Hindu view of the eternally recycling 
universe, that goes through the four successive periods, 
yugas, forever condemned to the cycle of regeneration 
and destruction. The four yugas are said to be 
respectively 4800, 3600,2400, and 1200 god-years long. 
A god-year, in turn, lasts 360 human years. The quality 
of life, as well as of humans, progressively deteriorates 
The Unesco Courier - May 2001 
in each successive yuga until we reach the present 
dark (kali) yuga, which will end in the great universal 
deluge, followed again by a new golden age and the 
birth of man from Manu. 
This great cosmic cycle, eternally chasing its own 
tail, this depressingly monotonous ebb and flow in 
which all illusion of forward movement is actually 
retrogression, fairly accurately sums up the Indian 
peasant’s life over centuries. The hard summer is 
followed by the great deluge of the monsoon, which 
rekindles the eternal hope that at last hunger, misery, 
and want will come to an end. Thus every agricultural 
cycle is actually the great cosmic cycle in microcosm. 
Practically all festivals in various parts of India coincide 
with the major punctuations in this agricultural cycle; 
for instance, even as I write these lines in late March, 
the traditional Indian new year is being celebrated in 
most regions, now that the crop is ready. 
A visit to the barber 
To the extent that India is still a predominantly 
agricultural society, these festivals, and the various 
rituals that go with them, are an organic part of people’s 
lives, and not just corporate inducements to an urban 
elite to consume more and more in the globalized 
marketplace. Yet, since these festivals and rituals have 
actually evolved over a very long period of time, they 
are now most often taken for granted; like the self- 
existent creator, they just exist, with neither beginning 
nor end. For most practitioners of these rituals, much 
of the original meaning is either unimportant, or simply 
lost under centuries of cultural sedimentation. 
Yet ideas persist over centuries and pop up at you 
when you least expect them. Last week, I needed a 
haircut, and so I went to the barber who has performed 
this service since I was about ten. It is a veritable 
ritual, evolved over two decades or so. It begins with his 
magnanimously offering me tea, and ends with his 
never returning change. In between, he asks about my 
family, I about his;he checks if I am still off smoking, 
Lif he is off drink. Through all this, of course, we discuss 
politics, sports, and anything else of topical interest. This 
time, I asked him how he was told the universe came 
into being. He laughed, snipped off a tuft of hair on my 
forehead, and said: “Who knows how all this was 
created? Who was around to see? Even the gods were 
born after something existed, so who can tell what 
happened when nothing existed?” 
My barber has not read the Rig Veda. But if he 
were to, some day, he will be struck by the following 
hymn: 
Then even nothingness was not,nor existence. 
There was no air then,nor the heavens beyond it. 
Who covered it? Where was it? In whose keeping? 
Was there then cosmic water, in depths unfathomed? 
But,after allwho knows, and who can say, 
Whence it all came, and how creation happened? 
The gods themselves are later than creation, 
So who knows truly whence it has arisen?

EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY 
  
n the day that the blue ones stopped 
transmitting, the caretaker was doing its 
rounds of the Eye, humming and pottering 
among the other, duller maintenance 
robots. 
Then, when the news came in, it stopped humming. 
Near the heart of the Eye—the vast radio telescope 
floating beyond the orbit of Jupiter—was a gigantic 
spherical tank which had once been used to store the 
water the humans had needed during the construction. 
They had lived in it, too—dwelling in pressurized 
cabins surrounded by water, shielded from radiation. 
Now they were gone—long gone—but the 
midnight blue tank remained. 
Like, the caretaker had thought one day, a huge 
blank canvas. 
WOW 
Until the coming of the Eye, no radio telescope 
had been sensitive enough to pick out signals of 
intelligent origin from the mush of cosmic background 
noise. But then the feast had begun: a tsunami of 
knowledge almost beyond human comprehension. Yet 
the messages showed that humanity was still 
fundamentally alone. All the signals had originated in 
other galaxies, often at distances that bordered on the 
cosmological. They had been sent hundreds of millions 
of years ago, when the dinosaurs were still evolution’s 
cool new idea. 
But there was a more disturbing thing even than 
the loneliness. 
At any one time the Eye was picking up the 
messages from about a hundred civilizations, but each 
only stayed active for a few centuries before falling 
silent. The net number stayed roughly constant because 
new species were always popping up and discovering 
radio astronomy, but they too would be doomed to 
spend only a relatively short amount of time among the 
hundred. For a few glorious centuries they would 
broadcast their cultural legacy into the sky;enriching 
the knowledge of the other listening cultures. 
But then—it was often around the time they started 
discovering some of the more interesting things that 
could be done with subatomic particles—they would 
stop sending. 
Usually without much warning.

It shouldn’t have 
bothered the 
caretaker. 
But in tending 
the Eye it found that 
it became quite attached to some of those transmitting 
cultures. It became absorbed in their histories; 
fascinated by their biologies and outlooks. 
It hummed their music and pondered their art. 
And waited with deep, mounting sadness for the 
day it always knew would come; the sudden,roaring 
silence from that part of the sky. 
WOW 
It moved to the part of the Fresco which recorded 
the senders in a distant galaxy in the constellation 
Sculptor. 
The caretaker had marked the tank with faint lines 
of celestial latitude and longitude. At the precise co- 
ordinates of the transmitting civilization, it had painted 
a spiral galaxy much like our own;an impressionistic 
swirl of white and ochre. It was one of the first galaxies 
that the caretaker had painted, and while it had gained 
proficiency since—there were better ones dotted all 
around the Fresco—there was a certain charm to this 
effort which appealed to it. 
Two thirds out from the core, the caretaker had 
marked the location of the transmitting culture’s solar 
system. 
It thought of them:blue, tentacled aquatic beings 
with a reproductive system so intricate it had taken the 
caretaker decades to work out how many sexes they 
had. Their music had been even trickier;sounding at 
first pass like synchronized drowning. But the caretaker 
had persisted, and after a while it had even caught 
itself humming some of the more accessible bits. 
But they were gone now. 
Silent. 
PO% A 
Nothing for it, then. 
With sadness in its heart—but at the same time 
emboldened by the execution of a solemn task it 
knew must be done—the caretaker prepared the 
precise shade of midnight blue it needed. When it 
was ready, it carefully stippled the galaxy into oblivion, 
like a master picture restorer removing a blemish. 
The caretaker was very good at its work,and when it 
was done there was no sign that the galaxy had ever 
existed. 
The Fresco was up-to-date, but it would not be 
long before it had to be changed again. 
Art is long, it thought. And life short. |

system to confront the horrific crimes of a 
prior regime. 
More than 20 such commissions have 
been created over the past two decades, 
mostly in Africa and Latin America (see 
box). As they are more widely used and 
studied, it has become clear that they fill a 
very different role from judicial inquiries 
and trials. They paint a larger picture, 
looking at many thousands of victims, 
whereas trials (which are critically 
important as well) must, by definition, focus 
on specific events of wrongdoing, and 
specific perpetrators. Truth commissions 
can be defined as official, temporary 
mechanisms established to investigate a 
pattern of past human rights abuses or 
violations of international humanitarian 
law. As a transitional tool, they are charged 
with investigating and reporting these 
abuses, and recommending reforms in 
order to prevent further abuses in the 
future. In the process, they serve to 
acknowledge formally past wrongs that 
were silenced and denied. 
Perhaps the most controversial and 
publicised of these was the South African 
Truth and Reconciliation Commission, set 
up in 1995. It is the only commission to 
date which had the power to grant amnesty 
to individual perpetrators. The very public 
nature of the hearings, with both victims 
and perpetrators testifying in front of 
television cameras, resulted in the country 
as a whole reflecting on its history and 
coming to a new understanding of the past.

To be granted amnesty, perpetrators 
were required to make a request in writing 
for specific crimes, tell the full truth about 
the event,and prove that it was politically 
motivated. Thus, it was not a full amnesty: 
if someone killed ten people and applied 
for amnesty for only five, he or she could 
still be prosecuted for killing the other five. 
Also, amnesty could be denied if it was 
found that the applicant did not tell the 
full truth or that the crime was motivated 
out of personal spite or ill-will, rather than 
for political reasons. 
High expectations 
Though the commission had a profound 
effect, it also shed light on the limitations of 
such exercises. Often,the time allotted for 
the commission to complete its work was 
too short, and it was impossible to verify 
and reach conclusions on the thousands of 
cases presented. For many victims, it was 
painful to watch their perpetrators walk 
free after admitting to heinous crimes. The 
expectations from the commission were 
too great from the start. South Africa’s 
testifies before South Africa's truth commission.

experience teaches us that we can’t expect 
the truth process to resolve all issues 
pertaining to past conflict and abuse. 
Reconciliation and recovery is a process 
that can take generations 
There is no one truth commission 
model. Countries respond to legacies of 
massive political violence in different ways. 
Mozambique, for example, is right next to 
South Africa,and its transition took place 
almost exactly at the same time. Yet here, 
there was no interest in digging up the past: 
the victims and general public were 
exhausted from the war and didn’t want to 
talk about it,while the political leadership 
on both sides of the conflict were also 
uninterested in looking closely at the past. 
Each nation must determine what span of 
time to consider, what acts or events to 
investigate, and under what rules. The 
differences will range from whether a 
commission chooses to hold public hearings, 
as in South Africa, or undertakes its 
investigations behind closed doors

whether a commission’s exercise is likely to 
lead to credible results that fairly reflect 
the concerns of all society. Truth 
commissions must have operational 
independence, but at the same time, be 
given the necessary political and 
governmental support for their work, often 
including direct financial support from the 
government. 
We are likely to see stronger 
commissions in the future, as the lessons of 
past experiences are incorporated into new 
and more inventive models. The new 
commission in East Timor, for example, 
makes creative use of local customs to 
promote healing and reconciliation. The 
commission has been set up, in part, to 
help facilitate the return of low-level 
perpetrators who are still in West Timor. 
These include members of the militia who 
were not responsible for killing, raping or 
organizing violence, but who might have 
taken part in the burning or looting. It is 
believed that such persons would be safe 
from acts of revenge once they have 
admitted to their crimes, apologized for 
them and agreed to carry out a community 
service sentence. Likewise in Sierra Leone, 
the Truth and Reconciliation Commission 
that is now being formed is likely to turn to 
traditional and religious leaders to facilitate 
its work on a local level. Where 
appropriate, it may facilitate such practices 
as cleansing ceremonies as a way of 
recognizing and honouring past events. In 
Mozambique, traditional mechanisms were 
in place that allowed people to process 
conflict and pain in their own way. When 
combatants came home, for example, they 
often went through a healing ritual where 
their past sins were seen to be washed 
away. It is important for a country to 
consider the indigenous mechanisms that 
may be in place that can help it to counter 
a painful past, with or without a 
complementary truth commission process.

Children in Bosnia are growing up learning that their neighbours are enemies. Civic groups say that a 
truth commission is the only way to defuse brewing ethnic hatred

Ab he n designed to hide the 
facts. Torture and related abuses were 
committed largely in secret; crimes like 
“disappearances” were intended to erase 
any trace of the victim or the crime. 
Hence the compelling need to uncover 
and acknowledge the truth. 
In Bosnia, such a commission is not 
needed because of a hidden truth, but 
because of multiple “truths,” each with a 
distinct ethnic vein. Nationalists from the 
three ethnic communities involved in the 
recent war propagate a history that 
portrays their group as the one and only 
victim of mass abuses, depicting the other 
two as evil perpetrators and monsters. 
Three separate war crimes commissions, 
dominated respectively by Bosnian, Croat 
and Serb perspectives, have focused on 
the victimization of their own group. 
Owing in no small part to the legacy 
of communism, people in Bosnia 
Herzegovina have long been accustomed 
to a “top-down” approach, by which they 
passively let leadership determine their 
fate. Shedding this mentality has been a 
slow process, but citizens are sending out 
a clear signal that they are ready to 
confront the past with an eye to shaping 
a better future. On no other issue is this 
more obvious than the current effort to 
establish a Truth and Reconciliation 
Commission (TRC). 
In January 2000, an extraordinary 
conference in Sarajevo on the proposed 
TRC brought together a diverse group of

80 civil society leaders from both the 
Moslem-Croat Federation and the Serb 
Republic. Representatives from human 
rights groups, victims’ associations, 
religious orders, political parties, 
academia, youth groups and others 
explained why they thought the TRC was 
vital to reaching durable peace. 
Independent media re-broadcast the 
entire eight-hour discussion. This broad- 
based grassroots citizens’ coalition has 
now established a National Coordinating 
Committee for Establishment of the 
Truth and Reconciliation Commission. 
This is an important step in the processes 
of both democratization and 
reconciliation in Bosnia. To date, over 
100 NGOs, political, religious and civic 
leaders have signed a petition calling for 
such a Commission. 
One of its main goals is to enable 
historians to write one history of the 
country. For now, we have three different 
histories, each teaching our children that 
our neighbours are our enemies. 
Continuing like this, we cannot expect 
anything more than a new war in 20 or 30 
years. 
Finally, some have suggested that the 
TRC should not be established until the 
War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague 
finishes its work. This would only postpone 
for at least another five years a process 
that many believe is essential to 
reconciliation. Five years for the three 
competing nationalistic versions of history 
to become further embedded in the 
collective psyche of each group. A boy 
who was ten years old when the recent 
conflict began has already reached the 
age of military service. With every year 
that children are raised on accounts of 
recent history that demonize other ethnic 
groups and refuse to acknowledge their 
suffering, it becomes more likely that this 
young generation will grow up to fight.It 
is a common belief that if NATO 
peacekeeping troops withdrew tomorrow, 
the country would likely descend anew 
into bloodshed and division. To make the 
departure of these troops possible, it is 
imperative that Bosnia take the TRC

To prevent a new cycle of violence 
and abuse, our society urgently needs to 
confront the legacy of evil committed by 
neighbour against neighbour, to identify 
the shortcomings in its political, legal

such abuses possible, and to begin the

### 122647: Let the victims voice their pain

JEAN HATZFELD*: “LET THE VICTIMS VOICE THEIR PAIN" 
don't have much trust in the effectiveness of international tribunals. 
When trials and hearings are held far from the scene of the crime, it 
doesn’t help reconciliation in the least.In the Rwandan town of Nyamata, 
where | spent six months, people would hear on the radio that “so and so 
has been sentenced to 25 years in prison” in Arusha, Tanzania,where the 
international tribunal for Rwanda sits. But what help is that? The survivors 
of the genocide are neither there to hear the trial nor to point accusations. 
What is said over there, before a foreign judge, leaves them indifferent. 
Obviously, it would be unthinkable for justice not to be done. But after civil 
war or genocide, the first job of justice—precisely because it has come too 
late—is not so much to punish as to tell the truth,to unravel the complex 
nature of responsibilities, and to acknowledge the victims’ suffering. Let 
everything be known,said and recognized! Let the victims voice their pain! 
Only then can the process of mourning begin, that crucial stage on the path 
to reconciliation.And it can only happen before the eyes and ears of those 
who suffered or “participated.” 
In Sarajevo, as in the hills of Rwanda, you hear that “the guilty must be 
tried here, by us.” All the more so as many cannot accept that we 
Westerners, who stood by as the war and genocide went on, are now 
judging its authors. The words of Marie-Louise, featured in my book,come 
back to me: “foreigners usually show a routine pity towards people who 
endured uncomparable hardship, as if the pity was more important than 
the suffering itself.” 
Time cuts two ways. A lot has to be left to survivors. They need it to find a 
new footing in life. Conversely, however, time is running short for the Hutu 
community, which is living in terror. About 125,000 accused people are 
waiting in Rwandan jails. What's being done about them? And what about 
those who've returned home to find themselves at the mercy of 
denunciation and vigilante justice? The page must be turned on an era of 
suspicion, justice must be done so that each charged person can at last 
make their way back into society without fear. 
Are the Rwandans capable of judging their own? Not for the moment,but 
we can help by training their judges and prosecutors. To ask “who will try 
them and how?"and to ensure there are some Hutu among the judges is 
a step towards dialogue. Let's allow the time it takes for the people 
involved to resolve this themselves, rather than turning to symbolic 
international tribunals set up by the West as a warning against more wars 
and genocides, but which don’t help reconciliation at all, except the 
reconciliation of Westerners with their own conscience. 
For now, in the hills, the genocide remains hidden,secret, wrapped in guilt 
and shame. This silence is killing Rwanda. Should there be forgiveness to 
become reconciled? | don't think so. For one, you can’t forgive someone 
who's tried to exterminate you from your land. Second, reconciliation 
does not require forgiveness, but a sense that justice is being done. Deep 
down inside, the survivors know that life must get back on course. 
Because, as Francine told me, “the teachers have to return to their school 
blackboards.” 
* Author of Dans le nu de la vie (Seuil, 2000), a series of poignant 
accounts by survivors of the Rwandan genocide. Orchestrated by the 
“Hutu power,” this genocide claimed hundreds of thousands of lives 
among Tutsi as well as Hutu moderates, from April to July 1994.

alfway through his performance, Diego 
Camargo notices that he’s forgotten one 
of his characters. He asks the audience for

bel c g a tree, crestfallen and 
upset. To convince him to return to the 
story, Diego promotes him to the rank 
of main character, giving him the 
assurance that nobody will ever drop him 
halfway through a tale again. 
To hear stories like this, fans turn up 
in numbers every year to the 
International Congress of Oral 
Storytelling, an event held since 1995 as 
part of the annual Buenos Aires Book 
Fair. Last time round, over 800 people 
flocked from Argentina and neighbouring 
countries, all keen to hear stories old and 
new, but also to learn how to tell them— 
those subtle tricks of timing and voice, of 
gestures and facial expressions 
Many were teachers eager to get 
children to read by adapting stories from 
world-famous authors, such as Isaac 
Bashevis Singer and Ray Bradbury, and 
telling them in the classroom. According 
to Nora Fonollosa, a narrator and 
researcher into children’s literature, pupils 
often go to the nearest library to look 
for copies of a story they have heard, and 
if they can’t find it,ask for another book 
by the same author. 
But this enthusiasm is not confined to 
schools. Juan Moreno, from Argentina, 
stopped teaching literature 17 years ago 
and began a new life telling stories and 
legends from around the world in 
theatres, bars, universities and libraries. If 
they happen to be in French, English,

Portuguese, German, Italian or Hebrew, he 
tells them in the original language. He also 
runs workshops for psychologists, lawyers, 
housewives and grandmothers. What does 
he teach to people from such different 
walks of life? 
“The value of the spoken word,” he 
says. “Words that heal and restore, that 
can give life but also take it away.” 
Learning this is very important for a 
lawyer involved in mediation, he says, 
but also for social workers in 
hospitals and senior 
citizens’ homes. He 
remembers 
what a 
despairing wo- 
man once told Dora 
Pastoriza de Echebarne, the 
pioneer scholar of oral storytelling in 
Argentina:*When I heard you tell the story, 
I didn’t feel sad any more.” 
amd 
Witches and goblins mingle 
with spirits of nature 
On a more material note, storytelling is 
said to have its bonuses. It’s usually better 
paid than acting in a theatre, and even 
more enticingly, has lots of travelling 
thrown in. Cuban storyteller Fatima 
Paterson has already been twice to 
Liverpool, in England, to tell stories 
accompanied by her musicians Every 
year, there are congresses, festivals and 
seminars, such as those in Bucaramanga 
(Colombia),Monterrey (Mexico) and 
Aguimes, in the Canary Islands 
After 15 years of slowly taking 
root, storytelling is now flourishing in 
Latin America. According to 
Argentine anthropologist Adolfo 
Colombres, the wave 1s not so much a 
revival of Latin American narrative 
traditions, but simply an enthusiasm 
for oral communication. In countries 
where few people read, “oral 
narration strangely enough 
encourages people to write,” he says. p>

### 122648: Weaving magic with the spoken word

  
The continent’s storytelling traditions 
are nevertheless very rich,a mingling of 
three historically oral societies: the 
indigenous Indian, the African and to a 
lesser extent, the local Spanish. “The 
European tradition of witches, goblins 
and fairy tales mix in with Indian and 
African traditions of the spirits of water, 
jungles and mountains,” says Bolivian 
writer Victor Montoya. “There are spirits 
that defend nature and severely punish 
those who harm it, such as Marimonda in 
Colombia and Coipora in Brazil. Then 
there are the ships condemned to sail the 
seas forever, never reaching port, such 
as Caleuche in Chile and the Barco Negro 
in Nicaragua. And beautiful women who 
seduce men but when you kiss them, their 
heads turn into frightening skulls” 
Fortunately these 
traditions are still alive. 
Oral storytellers, such 
as the Colombian Nico- 
las Buenaventura (see 
next article) and Mimi 
Barthélemy, from Haiti, 
are spreading them and 
linking up with other 
oral traditions. 
Barthélemy was 
born in Port-au-Prince 
and gave up the 
comfortable life of 
a diplomat’s wife to 
compile traditional 
Haitian folk tales and 
make them better 
known throughout the 
country and beyond,in 
Latin America and Europe. She travelled 
to villages to listen to local storytellers 
and read books on Haitian anthropology 
in Washington libraries. 
Kindling pride 
in oral heritage 
One of the stories she collected was 
about the ogre Bakulu Baka, who 
swallowed the sun and left the country in 
darkness until a benevolent god arrived 
with a machete and liberated it. “When I 
tell stories,” she says, “I mention Haiti 
and how voodoo and Catholicism mingle 
there. In one of my performances, the 
gods of both religions join hands in 
common cause.” 
Telling stories is a political gesture 
for her. “When I'm before an audience, I 
stop being somebody else’s lady. I become 
Mimi, a modern-day woman speaking in 
42 The Unesco Courier - May 2001 
public places.” Does she feel she’s just 
lending her voice and body to a tradition? 
“Certainly not,” she retorts “It’s not just 
folklore. I break with tradition because I 
give my own version of astory. By telling 
them in French, not just in the original 
Creole, I open up these stories to the 
world in a novel way and place them in a 
completely different context.” 
Spreading this tradition is very 
meaningful for Haitians, she believes. 
When they listen to stories, her 
compatriots come into close contact with 
an ancient tradition that is part of their 
heritage. They feel proud of belonging 
to a civilization that has invented such 
characters and stories. For an 
impoverished Haitian minority living in 
French Guiana,for example, listening to 
Haiti's Mimi Barthélemy: telling stories is a political gesture. 
these stories is a mirror that can give 
them a more positive image of 
themselves. 
For each place gives rise to its own 
style. In Colombia, for example, a 
movement of urban storytellers has 
sprung up in several towns, despite a 
tendency to associate the form with 
exaggeration and lies. Most of those 
involved are university students between 
17 and 35 years old. Although they do 
not claim to be inspired by any special 
tradition, they are hardly cultural rookies: 
“We always know something, whether 
it’s about music, film, theatre or literature, 
and we take the story from there,” says 
Carolina Rueda,one of the students. 
The daughter of an impassioned 
bullfighting fan, Rueda studied literature 
and worked as a theatre actress. From 
those experiences, she created a narrative 
about bullfighting based on stories she 
had heard since childhood, with some 
extra help from books about the sport. 
The structure of her show is rather like a 
bullfight,with six parts, like the six bulls 
that traditionally feature in an afternoon 
performance. 
Narrative tricks 
The storytellers have dropped simple, 
linear narration and delved into the 
language of films and advertising. One 
of them tells a half-hour story about a 
30-second TV spot in which a drop of 
tomato sauce falls from the 22nd floor of 
a building and sets off a gun-battle in the 
centre of Bogota. 
Diego Camargo, the storyteller 
mentioned above who lost one of his 
characters in the midst 
of his performance, has 
also written a tale in 174 
two-syllable words. But 
because it is difficult for 
the character to kill 
himself with three- 
syllable “balazos” 
(Spanish for bullets), he 
asks the audience to 
allow him a bit of poetic 
licence and ends the 
story with a loud “pum- 
pum!” (bang-bang!). 
Through such 
narrative tricks, the new 
movement is breaking 
with tradition, culling 
inspiration from post- 
modern authors such as 
Italo Calvino and his If on a Winter's 
Night a Traveller. The Colombian 
storytellers have thus managed to capture 
a media-educated urban audience for 
their art, which is filling public squares 
and theatres. 
Using both ancestral and post- 
modern tales, the storytellers are reviving 
among Latin Americans the ritual of 
listening to stories, those priceless 
moments of communication that begin 
for us all with the first stories we hear 
from our parents and grandparents. They 
are occasions that can spark novel feelings 
and reactions in a world ruled by the 
ever-present screen. A direct one-to-one 
communication, between an audience 
and a real human being who looks you 
straight in the eye and invites you to 
summon up your imagination so you 
don’t miss the only story in the world

### 122649: The World according to Nicolás Buenaventura

WEAVING MAGIC WITH THE SPOKEN WORD 
The world according 
to Nicolas Buenaventura 
Early on, Colombian storyteller Nicolas Buenaventura learned that “you have to invent the truth 
every day.” With several storytellers in his family tree, he treats his gift with reverence and warmth of 
Unesco Courier JOURNALIST 
  
      
fer a ow inutes of introduction, Nicolds 
Buenaventura realized that for the first 
time, he was before an audience that had 
grown up without listening to stories— 
street chi who had never heard of 
The Little Red Riding Hood. It was 
midnight in Bogotd and the faces of these 
youngsters lit up. Once upon a time, 
people referred to them as street urchins, 
but as the country’s situation deteriorated, 
they simply became billed as rejects. 
So he decided to tell his version of 
how the world was created.“There was 
once a God who managed to resist the 
unfortunate temptation of making Man in 
his own image. First he created the Earth, 
and when he saw it was round and 
beautiful, he was left with lots of teeny 
tiny bits and pieces. Then he created time 
and when that started moving forward, he 
was left again with lots of teeny tiny bits 
and pieces.” The children shouted and 
clapped as the storyteller rose to a higher 
emotional pitch to end his tale. “There’s 
always a moment in life when you feel 
you don’t belong in the world,and that’s 
terrible. But if you know the story of Tom 
Thumb, you know that even the tiniest 
living thing has its place in the world.” 
Buenaventura found his own place in 
the world through storytelling. The boys in 
his neighbourhood were quick to discover 
his young talent. Because he did not have 
enough money to go to the cinema, they 
clubbed together to buy him a ticket so 
that he could tell them the film from A to 
Z afterwards. Today he makes a living 
from storytelling and dreams of directing 
his second feature film. 
Like all his family, Nicolas was born 
with a storytellers gift. His father Enrique 
is one of Colombia’s leading playwrights 
and theatre 
directors. His 
grandfather 
Cornelio, a tireless 
conversationalist 
and professional 
storyteller, always 
repeated that “you 
have to invent the 
truth every day.” So 
whenever he walked 
down the street, 
people would call 
out:“Hey, Cornelio, 
make up a little bit of truth for me, will 
you?”

But Nicolas did not get his enthusiasm 
for storytelling from them. His inspiration 
came from Fermin Rios, a black 
storyteller from Colombia’s main Pacific 
port of Buenaventura.“Fermin told me: 
‘I must tell you the story of the boy who 
lost his bomboro [a magical realist term 
that stands for any type of object], but he 
never did. The next year, he said: ‘No, 
you're still not ready to hear it.”” Finally, 
he died and Nicolas had to go searching 
the world for the story himself. So far, he 
has found six versions of it—three in 
Colombia and three in Africa. 
The Colombian ones form the story of 
the origin of the river Timbiqui. On a visit 
to Burkina Faso, he told the story in a 
village. “Because I was a storyteller, I 
wasn’t seen as a foreigner. People realized

have to die, what are we made of?—and 
the answers change from place to place. 
For ethnologists, these oral stories stand 
midway between question and answer. 
After visiting three African countries, 
Nicolas understood how “telling a story is 
like putting bread on the table.” This only 
enhanced his deep respect for all stories. 
Perhaps it explains why he staunchly 
opposes his stories being used for other 
purposes, such as by schools to encourage 
reading. Storytelling, he says, can’t happen 
without an audience. There is no set 
ending in storytelling, and if there was 
one, it would be a story in itself. 
“Storytellers are the cups out of which 
people drink stories,” he says. 
Do stories change people? “In any 
case, they changed me. I'm more sensitive 
now to life’s nuances.” And do stories 
change the world? Nicolas replies by 
telling what happened to him one night in 
Bogota as he was making his way home.

Coming up with alternatives:the World Social Forum, held in Porto Alegre, Brazil,in January 2001.

DIRECTOR OF THE Unesco COURIER 
RRR 
he organizers of the World Social Forum 
inPorto Alegre, Brazil,were expecting 
2,000 people to attend a debate on 
“another possible world” in the last 
ek of January. To their surprise, this 
“anti-Davos” attracted 5,000 fans. So 
how did the organizers of the forum, 
who like to cast themselves as 
visionaries, explain their all too modest 
forecast? Why, the Internet of course: 
they had set up a website one month 
before the Forum. Although very basic, 
it spurred much greater interest than 
anticipated. 
The unexpected turnout was one 
more feather in the cap of the anti- 
globalization movement.Activists had 
already spent much time pleading for 
communication in general—and the 
Internet in particular—to be considered 
a leading “issue in the fight against 
neoliberalism.” As such, it deserved the

same attention as the campaign for the 
Tobin Tax, the cancellation of Third 
World debt or the control of world 
financial organizations. If not, they 
argued, cyberspace would become their 
adversaries’ haven. According to the 
conclusions of a Forum workshop on 
communication and citizenship, the 
Internet has already been instrumental 
in shaping the economic and 
“ideological” revolution that has 
marked the process of globalization. 
An ideological 
machine 
Workshop participants launched a 
stinging indictment: “If the first power is 
economic and financial, the second 
belongs to the media,” declared Ignacio 
Ramonet, director of the monthly Le 
Monde Diplomatique, upon opening 
the workshop. “It is the ideological

Striking media giants 
with news on the Web 
The Internet offers an unparalleled chance to spread an alternative to the news served up by the 
mainstream media, the “second power” of globalization, affirmed the World Social Forum in Porto 
machine of globalization.” Participants 
asserted that mainstream news “is 
essentially transformed into a 
commodity...that does not obey any 
rule except that of the market. It is 
uniform, one-dimensional and based 
on a single source.” Continuing the 
attack, Ramonet asserted that the 
mainstream media strikes a tone that is 
“emotional,” “impressionistic,” 
“sensationalist,” “rhetorical,” 
“simplistic” if not outright “infantile,” 
and which is dominated by a quest for 
“immediacy.” In short, “the supreme 
criteria” of media “mega-groups” is not 
truth but profit. “They're selling 
consumers to their advertisers.” 
The organizations attending Porto 
Alegre decided that it was high time to 
take on this “ideological apparatus,” 
using the Internet as their chief weapon. 
One strategy involves criticizing the 
news produced by the “mega groups” — 
criticism that must not only be 
systematic, but should also be diffused 
as widely as possible. A leading example 
is FAIR, the best known media

watchdog in North America. The 
organization aims to show how the 
structures of media conglomerates 
dictate content: the topics and 
viewpoints developed are those of an 
economic and political elite because 
these media belong to multinationals 
and are financed by others via 
advertising. 
According to Seth Ackerman, one of 
FAIR’s staff members, the Internet 
boasts three advantages over other 
forms of communication, including the 
group’s magazine quarterly 
Extra!. First, it provides 
instant access to a wide 
range of alternative news 
sources, allowing the 
network to pick up on 
important matters ignored 
by North American 
mainstream media or to 
reveal a fine-tuned 
understanding of biased 
coverage. Secondly, FAIR 
can dispatch to-the-minute 
analyses at minimal cost to 
subscribers. Thirdly, it can 
involve subscribers in the 
organization’s campaigns 
by encouraging them to 
email protest messages to 
media in FAIR’s spotlight. 
“Thanks to the Internet, 
our activities made such a 
huge quantitative leap that   
they’ve also changed 
qualitatively,” says 
Ackerman. 
The second front that 
anti-globalization 
organizations are intent on 
opening is far more 
ambitious. The goal is to 
make the Internet the 
vehicle for a stream of “counter 
information” or “alternative 
information” aimed at a mass audience, 
far larger than the narrow circle of 
activists that all other mediums charged 
with the same purpose—the written 
press, radio and television—have 
managed to reach.

Diverse sources, 
grand ambitions 
“What’s really new about the 
Internet—and its chief asset—is that 
the entry ticket is infinitely more 
affordable than for any other more 
traditional media,” says Jean-Pierre 
Marthoz! of Human Rights Watch.“The 
technical and political obstacles, such 
as getting around potential censorship, 
and above all the financial ones, in terms 
of investment and operating costs, bear 
no comparison with those faced by 
someone wishing to start up a 
newspaper or a radio or TV station. 
Internet opens the way for a diversity of 
voices that has been unheard of until 
  
 
now.” Antonio Martins, head of the 
Brazilian edition of the Monde 
Diplomatique, adds that distribution 
channels are nearly unlimited on the 
web, whereas hertzian wavelengths have 
to be shared among a limited number of 
users. 
In short, the Internet radically 
changes the information on offer 
because it can harbour an unrivalled 
number of information sources. Given 
that one of the main criticisms of media 
conglomerates is their “single source” 
character, this makes the Internet all 
the more appealing says Henri Maler, of 
ACRIMED (Action-critique-médias),an 
NGO devoted to media monitoring. 
According to Maler, the rising costs of 
keeping a staff of journalists up and 
running means news is based on an 
increasingly narrow range of sources. 
A first attempt at striking back was 
made last December in Bangalore, 
India, by some 30 journalists and writers. 
Their starting point was twofold: 
throughout the world, they stated, 
“discouraged” or 
“disillusioned” professional 
journalists want to restore 
some “nobility to their job, 
based on a social and 
democratic commitment.” 
They can’t do so, however, 
because employers stand in 
the way of publishing 
“articles that the public 
wants but never sees in 
print.” Their goal is hence 
“to enrich the public 
information space... and 
create a critical mass of 
alternative information” 
through “articles in the 
written press and broadcast 
reports that can contribute 
to a socio-economic, cultural 
and political alternative” to 
globalization. The ambition 
is titanic: to launch a news 
service on the Internet that 
would sell its products and 
succeed in “becoming a 
counterweight to the 
mainstream media’s 
stereotyped information.” 
It would be “a 
complementary channel,” 
rich in professionally 
packaged content. 
Professionals 
or not? 
To “communicate well, you need a 
range of skills,” underlines Ramonet. 
“You can know the truth and have no 
impact because you don’t know how to 
communicate. To think that the truth 
will naturally impose itself is to take an 
arrogant and contemptuous attitude 
towards citizens. The price of this is an 
absolute absence of communication.”

ME DIA  
“A diversity of sources does not 
necessarily lead to an avalanche of 
quality information, something which 
only results from a thorough process 
of checking, selecting and setting in 
context to give meaning,” says Marthoz. 
“The process still requires the hand of 
intermediaries who may not be 
journalists in the classical sense but 
‘para-journalists’.” He points to his 
organization’s site, which has become an 
almost indispensable source of 
information for anyone wanting to keep 
abreast of human rights in the world. 
Some 10,000 cybernauts visit the site 
each day, according to Marthoz, because 
the information placed online is 
collected by reliable experts and edited 
by seasoned experts in communication. 
If this type of alternative service is 
anything to go by, audience rhymes with 
credibility, which in turn calls for some 
form of professional involvement.Not 
true, declares Roberto Savio of the Inter 
Press service, which has been serving 
up alternative news since 1964: this 
strategy risks running a lap behind 
current trends. Although IPS relies on a 
network of journalists in over 100 
countries and counts more than 30,000 
NGO subscribers on its online service, 
Savio, a pioneer of alternative news, is 
getting ready to step down and launch 
other ventures. 
Civil society, he asserts, and youth in 
particular, reject outright all institutions 
or outfits functioning along vertical 
lines. It follows that the attempt to use 
the Internet as a carrier for a news 
counterweight while upholding the key 
position of the journalist—producing 
information from on high for the public 
below—is doomed to fail.It even rests 
on a deep contradiction, reproducing 
via Internet the same vertical model 
characteristic of all other media even 
though the web offers the chance to 
start a “communication society” 
operating horizontally. 
The Brazilian 
model 
Brazil’s Rits (Information network 
for the third sector) is one such new 
communication network that believes 
the Internet’s advent will allow the well- 
worn revolutionary slogan “of giving a 
voice to the people” to come true at 
last.“Let the people who live the story 
tell it,” declares the network. For a start, 
46 The Unesco Courier - May 2001 
you do away with the costs of financing 
a team of journalists. Red’s associates— 
some 200 organizations from the “third 
sector” (neither public nor private)— 
exchange around 10,000 messages a 
week and express themselves without 
any supervision or editorial advice. The 
only protection is an ethical code that 
dictates what can be put on the site. 
With or without professional 
intervention, whether raw or edited, 
can alternative news find its place in 
the limelight simply because it’s 
alternative? Judging from present 
trends, Ramonet is mildly optimistic. 
“As the overall education level rises, 
that of the media is getting worse. There 
will come a time when the two will cross 
over: more and more groups and social 
“Nothing is won 
in advance because 
we'll also have 
to be appealing, 
to win over hearts 
and souls” 
categories are dissatisfied with the 
media’s infantile discourse.” While 
“nothing is won in advance, because 
we'll also have to be appealing, to win 
over hearts and souls,” Martins insists 
that once a site is up and running, the 
Internet gives a chance to take on media 
conglomerates on equal terms, an 
impossible task in the print press or 
broadcasting. Marthoz, however, is more 
sceptical. “There’s no reason for the 
Internet to escape the newstand effect. 
Just as the average reader first buys the 
most prominent publications at a 
newstand, the average cybernaut will 
first go to the best-known portals 
(Yahoo!, Google etc). But the latter 
select what information is posted,just 
like the gatekeepers of the traditional 
media. While Internet offers room for a 
large number of information producers, 
the tunnel effect is well and truly there 
on the receiving end.” 
Marthoz also foresees another 
scenario. “Rather than think that the 
Internet will become an authentic 
information counterweight, its main 
effect will stem from how it influences 
the mainstream media.In this respect, 
there is no comparison with what the 
alternative print press or broadcasting 
can do. An alternative site can 
immediately be seen by the whole 
planet.” Proof of this is how the world’s 
press, including the most prestigious 
publications, consulted the Human 
Rights Watch site to keep up on the 
Chechnya war and even find “stories.” 
The force of 
the alternative 
The “Internet mystique” does not 
convince ACRIMED’s Maler “Making 
the web’s immense democratic 
potential a reality does not depend 
chiefly on the tool itself,” he says. “The 
space given by the public to alternative 
news, as opposed to commodified news, 
will be a reflection of the alternative 
forces carrying it.” In other words, 
between the Internet and anti- 
globalization activists, who’s the chicken 
and who's the egg? [|

In the great metropolises of 
market society, hundreds of 
homeless people die each 
year. 
We don't even know their 
names. For the American 
anthropologist Mark 
Anspach’, the market 
economy has not succeeded 
in ridding us 
of sacrifice. And yet, its 
rationality was supposed to 
distance us from ritual 
violence and those who 
practice it 
ou study exchange 
in primitive societies 
as well as in market 
society. Do 
transactions 
everywhere match 
the description of 
economists? 
No. The 
economists’ myth tells us that exchange 
fulfills a simple instrumental function. 
You live in a community that produces 
yams and I live in a community that 
raises pigs, so we enter into an 
exchange in order to vary our diets. 
One fine day, to facilitate our 
transactions, we invent a system of 
equivalence between our products— 
money—and there you have it. But,as 
anthropologists have shown us, Marcel 
Mauss in particular, the main form of 
exchange in so-called “primitive” 
societies is the gift, which cannot be 
reduced to economic rationality. 
  
 Wearing death masks,workers protest a factory closure in eastern France. 
You mean to say that people did not 
invent exchange in order to satisfy their 
material needs? 
In“primitive”societies, families may 
be quite capable of producing what is 
necessary for their subsistence. And 
yet, they will still enter into exchanges. 
Why? For the sake of exchanging—of 
forging relations with others and 
participating in the circle of positive 
reciprocity on which social life is 
founded. To refuse to exchange, to keep 
what one has for oneself, amounts to a 
kind of incestuous indulgence, as 
Claude Lévi-Strauss observes. He 
quotes a proverb from New Guinea 
that makes this point: “Your own 
mother, your own sister, your own pigs, 
your own yams, you may not eat. Those 
of other people, you may eat.” If you eat 
your own yams, your neighbour is liable 
to think they’re better than his, and 
your relationship could turn 
acrimonious. 
Even if my yams are just like his? 
Even then, there could arise what 
the thinker René Girard (see inset) 
calls a mimetic rivalry, based on 
reciprocal imitation. The neighbour 
who sees you feasting on your yams 
will want to do the same as you, that is,

he will want to eat your yams. What 
seems to be desirable to you becomes 
desirable for him. But if he tries to 
appropriate your yams for himself, you 
won’t want to surrender them. What 
is desirable for him becomes equally 
desirable for you. In this manner 
people can easily come to blows over 
nothing. Ritual prohibitions serve to 
prevent rivalries of this kind. The incest 
taboo, for example, keeps men from 
fighting for the women who are closest 
at hand, those who belong to the same 
family. A crime of passion could trigger 
a general crisis. It is hard for us to 
conceive just how dangerous the 
slightest dispute can be in a community 
with no police or judicial system. As 
with a hemophiliac, any bloodshed 
could prove fatal. If you kill your 
neighbour when he tries to grab your 
yams, his relatives will come after you 
next. Each act of violence must be 
avenged by a new act of violence, and 
the ensuing chain reaction can 
ultimately engulf the entire community. 
Doesn't this approach betray the belief 
that human beings are fundamentally 
violent? 
People are not fundamentally 
violent,they are fundamentally social. 
Once they have satisfied their material 
instincts—eating and reproducing— 
they still sense a lack. They desire 
something more, but what? Since 
Freud, we assume that desire is the most 
individual, most intimate thing there is 
about a person. For René Girard, this is 
a romantic myth. On the contrary, 
people do not know what to desire, it is 
something they must learn.And they 
learn it in the same way they learn all 
the essential things in life: by observing 
and imitating others. Humans are 
incomplete beings who are born 
radically dependent on others. It is no 
wonder they show themselves to be 
fascinated by others But it is precisely 
"We continue to persecute victims but gre 
now ashamed to do so: that is progress 
people’s fascination with each other 
which brings them so easily into conflict, 
and can sometimes embroil them in the 
worst forms of violence. 
All your explanations presuppose a 
universal human nature. 
I believe one should stand firm on 
this point: yes, there is a universal 
human nature. That does not mean 
that people everywhere are identical. 
Since people do not know instinctively 
what they want to do in life, their 
culture must offer them answers. 
Obviously, the range of answers varies 
from one culture to another. It is not 
such and such a model of behaviour 
that is universal,it is the need to have 
models. If people do not know what to 
desire, if each person tends to desire 
what others desire, the culture must 
channel desires in such a way that they 
do not constantly converge on the 
same objects. It must defuse the vicious 
circleof reciprocal desire, where each 
wants what the other wants, or risk 
descending into reciprocal violence. 
The paradoxical law of revenge 
commands the killing of the killer. And 
the killer’s killer? Here one falls into a 
new vicious circle. 
And is there any way out? 
What interests me is precisely to 
see how the shift is made from vicious 
circles to virtuous ones, from the 
negative reciprocity of violence to the 
positive reciprocity of the gift. With 
vengeance, each person responds to an 
offence committed by the other, each 
reacts to what the other has already 
done. This comes down to letting 
oneself be dominated by the past. In 
gift exchange, on the other hand, one 
turns toward the future and anticipates 
the desire of the other. Instead of 
waiting for your neighbour to come 
steal your yams you offer them to him 
today, and it is up to him to do the same 
for you tomorrow. Once you have made 
ON GIVING, TRADING 
AND RITUAL SACRIFICE 
  
Adam Smith (1723-1790) recommended giving free rein to individual rivalries with the idea 
that their combination produced order. To describe this phenomenon, he invented the 
metaphor of the “invisible hand of the market.” 
Marcel Mauss (1872-1950) described, in The Gift, the systems of ritual exchange among 
native Americans or Melanesians. For him, the gift is a “total social fact,” at once religious, 
economic, political, matrimonial, legal.... Today, the Mouvement anti-utilitariste dans les 
sciences sociales (MAUSS) lays claim to his heritage and criticizes economic 
reductionism(www.revuedumauss.com). 
In The Elementary Structures of Kinship, Claude Lévi-Strauss analyzes marriage as a form 
of reciprocity between kin groups, but he does not explain its origin (see Lucien Scubla, Lire 
Lévi-Strauss, Odile Jacob, 1998). 
René Girard has taught in the United States since 1947. His writings take us back to the 
violent origins of exchange. In all human relationships, he discerns the mechanism of mimetic 
rivalry, set forth in his first major work, Deceit, Desire and the Novel. We desire only what 
others desire. When this contagious rivalry seizes hold of a whole community, it is not 
appeased until the “all against all”is transformed into an “all against one.” One antagonist 
is killed and peace returns. The victim then appears all-powerful since he or she was able to 
restore order. His following book, Violence and the Sacred, shows how the sacred arises out of 
sacrifice. In 
The Scapegoat, he develops the idea that the Christian scriptures inaugurated a long process 
of questioning this founding violence. Latest book: | Saw Satan Falling Like Lightning (Orbis, in 
press). The journal Contagion publishes the work of “Girardian” scholars 
(http://theol.uibk.ac.at.cover.index.html).

victim, meaning one 
whose death will not 
trigger further acts of 
vengeance within the 
group: a slave, an 
imprisoned enemy, an 
animal.... In a peace 
ritual described by 
anthropologist 
Raymond Jamous, the 
murderer leads his 
people to the territory 
of his victim. His hands 
bound and a knife in 
his teeth, he offers 
himself as a new 
victim, he anticipates 
the desire for revenge 
of his adversaries. But 
rather than killing the 
murderer as they 
would if the cycle of 
vengeance were to 
continue, they take the 
knife and sacrifice an 
animal in his stead. To 
seal the end of 
hostilities, the 
members of both camps join together 
in eating the animal.Not only will this 
victim not be avenged,but it provides 
the feast which launches a new cycle of 
positive reciprocity. The rite which puts 
an end to a vendetta facilitates the 
transition between the reciprocal 
violence of vengeance and the non-

violent reci- procity of the gift. 
But how does market exchange come 
to take the place of the gift? 
First let’s see what distinguishes 
them. When you offer me so many 
sheep, or shells, or shields, you make a 
display of your prestige, and I must at 
least match your generosity with a 
return gift. On the contrary,a monetary 
payment nips the relationship in the 
bud: it relieves one of any return 
obligation. A market transaction leaves 
the seller and buyer free of any ties. 
Just as the gift breaks the circle of 
vengeance, money breaks the circle of 
the gift. I asked myself how such a 
transaction could arise within a ritual 
context. In Vedic writings from ancient 
India, we see that monetary payment 
begins with the compensation of the 
sacrificial priest, a brahman who carries 
out a dangerous task and whom one 
prefers to keep at arm’s length.In the 
Greek world, money is associated with 
the figure of the tyrant. He is a usurper, 
a king whose legitimacy does not derive 
from traditional structures. To get 
around the system of reciprocal 
obligations which he challenges, he 
must resort to employing mercenaries, 
whom he pays off with money. War, a

violence. 
So you trace market exchange back to 
sacrificial rituals? 
In these examples we already see 
the beginning of an impulse to thrust 
away the operators of sacrifice. Later, 
sacrifice itself will be banished. All our 
history is a long process of awakening 
an anti-sacrificial consciousness. First,an 
animal replaces the human victim, as in 
the story of Abraham and Isaac. Then 
the day comes when people hesitate 
even to butcher the animal. René 
Girard attributes the origin of this 
awakening of consciousness to the 
Biblical texts, the Gospels in particular. 
One may also find anti-sacrificial 
messages in other traditions, in 
Buddhism for example. But one does 
not have to be Christian to 
acknowledge the force of René Girard’s 
analyses, or to follow him in reflecting 
on where the decay of religious myths 
and rituals may lead.If sacrificial rites, 
while producing victims, made it 
"if your neighbour is hungry, you have 
no obligation to feed him" 
possible to avoid even greater violence, 
what will happen in the absence of 
rites? We know that human progress 
has always been fragile, with steps 
backward accompanying every step 
forward. I believe it is important, 
nevertheless, to defend the notion of 
progress. Even if we continue to 
persecute victims, we are now ashamed 
to do so:that is progress. 
We have learned to recognize the victims. 
But our morality adapts quite well to 
the market economy, which also 
produces victims of another sort. 
Monetary transactions sever the 
bond between exchange partners; they 
eliminate all obligations of reciprocity. 
If your neighbour is hungry, you have 
no obligation to feed him; if he is 
evicted from his home and freezes to 
death, you have no obligation to avenge 
him. As Canadian philosopher Paul 
Dumouchel observes, the elimination of 
the obligation of revenge keeps 
violence from spreading from one 
individual to the next.,but at the same 
time it universalizes the category of 
“sacrificeable” victims, those whose 
death will not result in vengeance. In 
this sense, we continue to sacrifice 
anonymous victims. In his book Le 
sacrifice et l’envie (“Sacrifice and 
Envy”), French philosopher Jean-Pierre 
Dupuy shows the extent to which the 
spectre of sacrifice haunts the thinking 
of the major theorists of the market 
economy. 
Why not set ourselves the objective of 
returning to the gift? 
We have not completely left it, 
fortunately. Gifts, including services 
within the household, still hold an 
important place. In France, by the 
conservative estimate of one economist, 
Ahmet Insel, gifts are of a magnitude 
equivalent to about three-quarters of 
GDP. We should aim for a balance 
between the gift sector and the market 
sector. But this balance is threatened 
today by the imperialism of market 
logic. It is that logic therefore which 
must be questioned. Obviously, we will 
not go back to archaic forms of 
exchange. These presuppose a ritual 
framework which has vanished. A new 
religion cannot be made to order. 
But hasn't the market economy taken 
the place of religion? 
The ritual framework of primitive 
exchanges entails the presence of 
invisible mediators. The spirit of the

### 122651: Mark Anspach: global markets, anonymous victims

IT ALKI NG TO ..  
gift obliges the recipient to make a 
return gift, Marcel Mauss tells us. Adam 
Smith, the father of liberal political 
economy, likewise invokes a hidden 
spirit when he talks about the invisible 
hand of the market. Of course, he 
means this as a simple metaphor: the 
market is supposed to be self- 
regulating, functioning best without 
visible intervention on the part of the 
State. But nothing guarantees that, left 
to itself, the market will converge on a 
satisfactory equilibrium. History tends 
rather to prove the opposite. In this 
sense, the doctrine of the invisible hand 
does depend on quasi-religious faith. It 
serves mainly to absolve people of the 
consequences of their actions. 
When a jumbo jet falls to the 
ground, there is an investigation to 
determine who is responsible. But every 
day, the number of people who die of 
hunger in the world is equivalent to 
the number who would perish if several 
hundred jumbo jets crashed. No 
investigation is needed: the market is 
responsible. Which is another way of 
saying nobody. Nobody is individually 
responsible for a violence which is 
collectively accepted, just as the 
violence of sacrifice is collectively 
accepted. 
The opponents of market globalization 
advocate the establishment of “fair 
trade.” Isn't this a contradiction in terms, 
if the market is by nature irresponsible? 
Why not develop fair trade? In 
reality, the partisans of market 
globalization claim that they themselves 
want to promote the interests of poor 
workers. This is a good illustration of the 
ethical progress we were talking about: 
everybody recognizes the central 
importance of the victims. But the alibi 
is pretty flimsy because poor workers 
are perfectly able to determine what is 
in their own interest. Their union 
representatives could organize an 
international summit to negotiate a fair 
framework for trade themselves—at 
Davos, for example. Just as war is too 
serious a matter to be left to the 
generals, trade is too serious to be left 
to the captains of finance. 
Montesquieu said that the natural effect 
of trade is to lead to peace. Your analyses 
do not seem to confirm this adage. 
Globalization means the 
development of market exchange 
among nations. Now, despite the 
existence of the United Nations, the 
international arena still displays one of 
the essential features of primitive 
society: the absence of the State. In true 
primitive societies, where gift exchange 
predominates, one sometimes finds 
transactions quite similar to market 
exchange. These transactions are 
practiced solely with foreigners towards 
whom no duty of solidarity exists. With 
them,one has the right to cheat,steal, 
or wage war. Lévi-Strauss alludes to 
markets of this type where buyers and 
sellers are ready to fight at the slightest 
provocation and goods are offered at 
spear-point. That reminds me of a New 
York Times journalist, an advocate of 
globalization, who explained that the 
invisible hand of the market must be 
accompanied by an iron fist. I am 
skeptical about the idea that an 
expansion of international trade leads 
to peace. The same idea was expressed 
the last time a comparable level of 
economic integration between 
countries was reached, early in the last 
century. 
And? 
And then the First World War came 
along and dispelled this illusion.
