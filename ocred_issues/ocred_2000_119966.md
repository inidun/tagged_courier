THE MAGIC OF THE MIRROR 
  
D Photos by Alex Webb, text by Fabrizio Mejia Madrid 
The uprising in Chiapas has forced Mexican society to look at the Indians straight on, 
perhaps for the first time, and to start weaving with them a truly common future

Children in front of a mural featuring Emiliano Zapata in Polhé, a village located in the Chenalh6é municipality, in the heart of Chiapas. 
  
I seemed to notice a movement from 
beneath her shawl, a kind of sudden 
vibration. I looked down at the 
woman’s feet and was startled: her cal- 
loused heels bore all the dust and dirt of 
years walking barefoot. I placed a coin in the 
woman’s permanently open palm,and ran 
into the Museum of Anthropology. I was 
seven or eight years old. I asked my father 
about the woman to whom I had just been 
told to give some money. “She’s an Indian,”

municipality of Mexico City. A contributor to the daily 
La Jornada, he is the author of three books, including 
“Small Acts of Civil Disobedience”, published in Spanish 
in 1996. 
he replied. “But something was moving 
inside under her clothes,” I insisted. “It 
must have been her child,” my father 
concluded, and we walked on into the 
Mayan room of the museum without saying 
a word. 
The image of that Indian woman in 
Mexico City has haunted me every year 
since. It is not really an image, more like 
fragments of a body—an outstretched 
hand, the soles of her feet, the coppery 
colour of her arm—and the suggestion of 
another being moving beneath her 
clothes. When you come across them in 
the cities, you don’t look at them directly. 
They, the Indians, lower their eyes as if to 
acknowledge that the colour of their skin, 
their “defective” Spanish and their rural 
garments have made them invaders in this 
land of mestizo nationalism. They have 
never had looks or expressions. Nobody 
can remember their faces. 
In contrast, the term “indigenous 
people” — as opposed to “Indians” — is 
part and parcel of Mexican history. Like 
millions of other Mexican children, I 
grew up seeing murals by Diego Rivera, 
where the Aztecs came to represent sym- 
bols and values, but not people. From as 
far back as I recall, “indigenous” has 
meant that under the earth on which we 
walk there are vestiges of women and men 
who erected pyramids to worship the sun, 
dreamt about the number zero, sacrificed 
virgins and predicted eclipses. But bet- 
ween the “Indian” and the “indigenous” »

Revolutionary images on a wall in Polhé express some of the inhabitants’ aspirations. 
there has never been any connection 
beyond the fact that neither had a face. 
For centuries the Indians submissively 
Joined the growing mass of invisible spec- 
tators of a distant country, of an ethereal 
land which changes without the need to 
involve those who are watching it. The 
image of the “Indians” was one of pea- 
sants always waiting for land, justice, edu- 
cation and health. We knew they existed 
because there were millions of them, 
though we stayed deaf to what they were 
trying to tell us. Taken into account 
because of their sheer number, the 
“Indians” ended up being tackled as a 
“problem” in the 1970s: that of migration 
to the cities. The so-called “Marias”— 
“Indians” who asked for charity dressed 
in highly coloured clothes—were the fai- 
thful reflection of the failure of our shared 
life and of the only offer that we made to 
help them belong to Mexico: stop being 
Indians. 
When on January 1, 1994, the Indians 
in Chiapas rebelled once more against 
contempt, they did so covering the whole 
face apart from the eyes. They made the 
country look at them. They knew that 
morality started by looking at someone in 
the eyes. It is the source of empathy, of

son’s gaze was exactly what was denied to

me by the country to which I belong. For 
500 years the Indians were not men and 
women who had to be wiped out, but 
simple non-humans who survived thanks 
to a national evasion: not looking at them 
head-on, in the eyes. Looking in the eyes 
of the Indians made us capture in their 
reflection the very part of ourselves that 
exists in the other,the foreign in each and 
every one of us. 
Four years on, the women from an 
Indian community displaced by a “low- 
intensity war” were the architects of ano- 
ther major change. After the massacre of 
women and children in Acteal on 
December 22, 1997, the women of 
X’oyep decided to rise up against the 
army’s presence. Already forced out of 
their homes, they were not ready to be 
drawn into hostilities once again. They 
pushed the soldiers with their bare hands 
right to the village’s boundaries, while 
one of them carried in her hands X’oyep’s 
last hen. Riled by indignation, she defen - 
ded the bird and together with the other 
women, triumphed over a professional 
army. The moral strength of the Tzeltal 
Indians of X’oyep rested in January 1998 
on their physical weakness and on their 
small number, but also on their opposi- 
tion to war. They are the poor people who 
refuse to be helped by a country which 
allowed the Acteal massacre to take place. 
In their resistance there is a moral stance 
that connects me to them: neither would

that I have not chosen.Their actions have 
made them famous because they entailed 
a nationalism without patriots: they did 
not want any happiness that would des- 
troy them for their own good. In the 
hands that pushed out the army, I saw the 
“Marias” of my childhood disappearing. 
The distance between looking 
and listening 
Although we have become more 
willing to tolerate difference, we are still 
no more ready to listen to and understand 
the voices of difference. The idea of diver- 
sity in Mexican society brings to mind 
divided ghettoes where contact between 
one tradition and another inevitably wea- 
kens one of them.Moving from the ethnic 
to the ethical does not mean we should 
strive to preserve that diversity, but rather 
absorb what it is trying to tell us. It is the 
gap between looking and listening, bet- 
ween accepting that the Other exists and 
experiencing its fragility as one’s own, 
between opening windows and building 
bridges. It is this gap that we have to nar- 
row: to go from living alongside each 
other to experimenting with living toge- 
ther. I know that with the X’oyep women 
we will travel that road. [|

MEXICO'S 
POOREST STATE 
 
long with neighbouring Yucatan and Oaxaca, 
Chiapas, a state in southern Mexico, has the 
country’s highest proportion of indigenous 
people: 42.5 per cent of its three million or so 
inhabitants are Mayans. Nationally, there are 
approximately 10.6 million indigenous people 
out of a population of 92 million, 80 per cent of 
whom are mixed-race. 
Mostly rural, Chiapas breaks Mexico's 
poverty records. In 1995, it was estimated that 
59 per cent of the population were living on less 
than the minimum income necessary for survival 
(then put at $150 a month). That situation is 
partly explained by the fact that Chiapas, so far 
from Mexico City, isthe state where land reform 
was the most weakly implemented. When the 
reform ended in 1992, half the land in Chiapas 
was still in the hands of large landowners. 
That is the context in which the “Zapatista 
Army of National Liberation” (EZLN) led by “sub- 
commandante” Marcos burst upon the scene on 
January 1, 1994, a symbolic date because it mar- 
ked the entry into force of the NAFTA free-trade 
agreement with the United States and Canada. 
EZLN rebels overran seven Chiapas municipali- 
ties, including the city of San Cristobal de las 
Casas, demanding “democracy, freedom and jus- 
tice for all Mexicans.” A ceasefire was declared 
after two weeks of fighting with the army in 
which, according to official sources, 159 people 
wereKkilled, though human rights groups put the 
death toll at over 400. On February 21,1994, the 
EZLN and Mexico's federal government began 
talks for the first time, mediated by the bishop of 
San Cristobal, Mgr Samuel Ruiz. Signed on 
February 16, 1996, the San Andres accords on 
the rights of indigenous peoples were rejected by 
the authorities, on the basis that national sove- 
reignty had to be protected. 
The cost of breaking off the negotiationshas 
been high. For example, 45 alleged EZLN sym- 
pathizers were killed in the village of Acteal on 
December 22,1997. 
In March 1999, 2.5 million Mexicans took 
part in a consulation organized by the EZLN on 
integrating indigenous law into the Constitution. 
The strategy of the guerrillas, whose objective is 
not to seize power, consists of gathering support 
from national and international civil society for a 
democratisation of Mexican society. |

### 119975: The Miracle of the Rhine

THE*MIRACLE’ OF THE RHINE 
  
D Urs Weber 
Fish are once again swimming in the Rhine River but it took an ecological catastrophe 
for the countries it flows through to clean up their act 
For decades, the Rhine was one of 
A Europe’s most repelling waste dum ps. 
Today, concerted efforts by all the 
countries along its banks have restored the 
river’s health. The symbol of that recovery 
is the mighty salmon, which swims once 
more in its waters: over 200 have been 
caught since 1996. But the road to success 
was long and hard. 
Europe’s busiest waterway, the Rhine 
is navigable over a distance of 883 kilo- 
meters stretching from its source near 
Basel to its mouth in the Netherlands. For 
centuries, many cities and major indus- 
trial areas, such as the Ruhr Valley, have 
occupied its banks. One of the world’s 
densest road and railway networks follows 
its course. T he river also irrigates areas of 
intensive agriculture and vineyards pro- 
ducing highly-prized wines. 
Other crops, such as maize, tobacco, 
sugar beet and market garden produce 
(often in greenhouses), which consume 
high amounts of fertiliser, are greater 
threats to the environment. Run-off from 
dairy and pork farms also cause damage. 
Thousands of people drink water drawn 
from the river, while urban waste flows 
into it. A glance at the Rhine’s geography 
(see map and box) shows that civilisation 
puts huge strains on the river, which flows 
through five countries, making it a proto- 
type of co-operation in international 
waters. 
A subject of treaties 
An 1816 treaty, one of Europe’s 
oldest, established the Rhine as a navi- 
gable waterway. The accord was updated 
in Mainz in 1831 and replaced in 1868 by 
the Mannheim Act, which set up the 
Strasbourg-based Central Commission of 
the Rhine, whose purpose was to guaran- 
tee freedom of movement on the “inter- 
national waterway.” Dikes were built 
along its branches and marshland was 
dredged to make it navigable for vessels 
with draughts of up to 3,000 tonnes. 
In 1885, five countries along the river 
D Editor of the regional supplement of the Swiss daily 
newspaper Basler Zeitung, in Basel 
signed an agreement of quite another 
sort,the Salmon Treaty. The International 
Salmon Commission was set up to pro- 
tect the fish, which were vanishing from 
the river as a result of pollution and dams 
that prevented them from migrating. 
Salmon swim out to sea when they are 
about 18 months old and return to the 
place where they were born to spawn at 
the age of four or five years. The countries 
along the Rhine decided to encourage the 
introduction of young salmon into the 
river. 
But during the nineteenth century, 
major civil engineering projects were built 
in and around the river without any prior 
bilateral agreements. Decisions were 
taken and work done which threatened 
neighbouring countries or towns further 
downstream. In 1807, the Grand Duchy

After several unsuccessful attempts, a 
Danube Commission based on the Rhine 
model was set up in Vienna in 1992. An inter- 
national convention on cross-border pollution

Wurtemburg) unilaterally decided to 
canalise part of the river. The German 
hydraulic engineer in charge, Johann 
Tulla, straightened out its course, increa- 
sing the water flow. Those “improve- 
ments” had a disastrous impact on the 
water table of the upper Rhine plain, 
whose level fell. The softwood forests 
were no longer regularly flooded, a featu- 
re of the river’s plain, and dried out. 
Joining forces 
against pollution 
The Grand Canal of Alsace, which 
France began in 1920, was also built 
without consulting neighbouring coun- 
tries. The decision was made by the vic- 
tors of World War I as part of theTreaty of 
Versailles. The canal enabled France to 
build 10 hydroelectric plants and dams 
between Basel and Strasbourg, not to 
mention others on tributary rivers, which 
blocked the movement of migratory fish. 
The waterway, which was widened in 
1950, lowered the level of the Rhine. 
The river did not become Europe’s 
cesspit until the mid-twentieth century. 
Huge amounts of liquid waste, mostly 
from towns, farms and expanding indus- 
tries, were dumped into the river with 
impunity. The level of phosphates from 
fertilisers and household products such as 
detergents reached alarming levels. The 
fish population dwindled and in 1935 sal- 
mon vanished entirely. It was also increa- 
singly difficult to draw drinkable water 
from the river, and it often smelt like car- 
bolic acid and tasted salty. 
After World War II, most European 
states refused to negotiate with Germany. 
But, unlike what happened in 1919, the 
idea of a joint effort to ensure the future 
of the Rhine gained ground. In 1946, the 
Netherlands asked Switzerland to take 
part in a discussion on pollution in the 
river. 
The participants settled for a new 
international conference on salmon in 
Basel in 1948, when it was noted that the 
great fish really had disappeared from the

Rhine. The need to set up a permanent 
intergovernmental body to handle general 
pollution issues then became clear and 
the International Commission for the 
Protection of the Rhine (ICPR) was esta- 
blished on June 11, 1950 at a meeting of 
representatives from the countries along 
the river (plus Luxembourg) that agreed 
to fund it. 
The results were slow in coming. 
Water pollution steadily worsened for 
over 20 years. But at least countries had 
decided to take regular samples of the 
Rhine’s water, which led to a system to 
monitor water quality along the river’s 
entire length. 
The persistence 
of hard metals 
In 1963, the first draft agreement to 
clean up the Rhine was signed in Berne. 
The same year, the ICPR was given a per- 
manent headquarters, first in Lux- 
embourg and from 1964 in Koblenz. 
Since then, a secretariat has collected and 
distributed valuable data on the river’s 
condition and drafted progress reports on 
various ecological problems. 
The Commission operates in a rather 
innovative way, which experience has pro- 
ved to be useful. Environment ministers 
and officials from each member state 
gather at ICPR meetings on a regular 
basis. Decisions are taken jointly and each 
country, Land or regional government 
adopts the ensuing measures. But neither 
the ICPR nor its secretariat has any exe- 
cutive or coercive power to speak of, such 
as the authority to order the construction 
of new facilities. Similarly, the 
Commission draws up environmental 
projects for the Rhine, but if adopted they 
are funded and implemented by each 
member country. The secretariat simply 
monitors their application along the 
river’s entire length. 
In 1976, the European Community 
(later the European Union) joined the 
ICPR, lending it more authority, and sub- 
sequent measures began to show results. 
Between 1970 and 1974, the river’s oxy- 
gen content was still between only two 
and four milligrams per litre—too low to 
support the growth of any organism. 
But between 1970 and 1990, the 
countries along the river spent $38.5 bil- 
lion on building a string of purification 
plants. The oxygen level steadily rose and 
some of the river’s biodiversity returned. 
However, experts noted that the purifica- 
tion plants did their work after the pollu- 
tion had occurred, limiting the effects 
without tackling the causes. Furthermore,

e Rhine flows down from two Alpine springsin 
Switzerland's Grisons region. One of them feeds 
the anterior Rhine (Vorderrhein), the other the pos- 
terior Rhine (Hinterrhein). They converge at the Swiss 
village of Reichenau to become the Alpine Rhine, 
which forms the border between Switzerland and 
Austria before crossing Lake Constance. After the 
famous 25-metre-high Schaffhouse Falls, the river 
becomesthe High Rhine (Hochrhein) and flows west, 
where it demarcates the border between Germany 
and Switzerland. 
Downstream from Basel, the river turns north 
and becomes the Upper Rhine (Oberrhein) for 
the next 300 kilometers or so. Then it briefly 
forms the border between Switzerland and 
France and, for the next 180 kilometers, between 
France and Germany and, finally, between seve- 
ral German states (Ldnder). At Mainz, the river 
turns west again, then north at Bingen. This is the 
Middle Rhine (Mittelrhein), which crosses the 
Rhine mountains for 100 kilometers. 
At Bonn, the river becomes the Lower Rhine 
(Niederrhein), which, upon reaching the Dutch 
border near Emmerich, turns west once more 
and splits up into several waterways to form the 
Rhine Delta, into which the Meuse also flows. 
From Reichenau to the North Sea, the Rhine is 
1,320 kilometers long. The river's hydrographical 
basin stretches out over approximately 250,000 
square kilometers that are home to 51 million 
people and cover parts of Switzerland, Austria, 
Germany, France, Luxembourg and the 
Netherlands. The Rhine’s many branches include 
the Aare in Switzerland, the Ill in France, and the 
Kinzig, Neckar, Main, Lahn, Mosel, Ruhr, Lippe 
and smaller tributaries in Germany. [|

the plants could only eliminate a small 
amount of the heavy metals in the water. 
“The river has some ability to clean 
itself, but this has been over-estimated,” 
says Anne Schulte-Wiilwer-Leidig, a bio- 
logist in Koblenz. So the Rhine still 
contained high amounts of heavy metals, 
such as mercury, cadmium and zinc, and 
harmful substances, including polychlo- 
robiphenyls (PCBs),benzene and atrasine 
(from pesticides). 
In 1976, the ICPR member-countries 
signed a convention on chemicals that 
ranked some as dangerous and put them 
on a “black” or a “grey list.” Maximum 
levels were set for cadmium, mercury and 
other particularly harmful substances. 
Those steps were taken at a time when 
manufacturers were able to acquire tech- 
nology to eliminate or separate out dan- 
gerous toxins during the production 
stage. Previously, they could only be filte- 
red out at the end. 
That same year, the countries along 
the river signed an agreement on chlo- 
rides to reduce the Rhine’s salt content 
from 500 to 200 milligrams per litre along 
the German-Dutch border. The high 
level, which spoiled drinking water, was 
mainly due to waste from potash mines in 
Alsace (slated for closing in 2004) and in 
Lorraine flushing into the Rhine and the 
Moselle,as well as to chemical waste from 
plants along the river Main.T he salt level 
in the river Weser, polluted by potash 
discharges from the Werra, sometimes 
reached 3,000 mg/litre. 
People living along the Rhine were in 
for a terrible shock in November 1986

an ecological catastrophe. Environmental 
awareness rose and the affected population 
and their representatives demanded that

manufacturers take much tougher action 
against pollution. 
“The Basel disaster enabled the ICPR 
to set higher goals in its 1987 Rhine 
Action Programme for Ecological 
Rehabilitation,” says Koos Wieriks, of the 
ICPR secretariat. Commitments were 
made to cut the amounts of the most 
hazardous pollutants in half by 1995. 
Many experts thought this target could 
never be reached, but ICPR samples sho- 
wed that from 1985 to 1992, mercury in 
the river at the German town of Bimmen- 
Lobith, near the Dutch border, fell from 
six to 3.2 tonnes, cadmium from nine to 
5.9 tonnes, zinc from 3,600 to 1,900 
tonnes, atrasine from 10 to 3.7 tonnes 
and PCBs from 390 to 90 kilograms. 
Special chemical purification plants 
were built up- and downstream from 
Schweizerhalle. “The 1987 programme 
won credence for the idea that the Rhine 
was a total ecological system,” says 
Schulte-Wiilwer-Leidig. Under the pro- 
gramme, the Rhine was to become a place 
where salmon, pike, perch, trout and 
other fish could thrive once more. But to 
achieve that goal, the water quality had to 
be further improved,an objective that was 
reached before the 2000 target date. 
Industrial development once transformed the Rhine into a veritable wasteland.

Since 1991, more than a million young 
fish have been released into the Rhine and 
its branches. 
But the troubles of the migrating fish 
were not over. In 1996, the first salmon 
caught in the river for many years was 
hooked just before the Iffezheim dam, 
near Baden-Baden. The fish came from 
the North Sea but because of the dam 
could not reach the branch where it was 
born. Salmon only spawn in the places 
where they started life. 
In 1996, the first salmon 
caught in the river 
for many years was hooked 
just before the Iffezheim dam, 
near Baden-Baden 
With the help of ecology movements, 
the reluctance of power station owners to 
build costly bridges or complex networks 
of passageways for the salmon is gradual- 
ly breaking down. Such facilities are 
already under construction at Iffezheim, 
at the confluence with the river Ill (which 
has no dams on it), at a cost of about $6 
million, and at Gambsheim, in Alsace. 
Basel residents are being consulted about 
planned changes in the landscape that 
would help the salmon migrate. Egon 
Oberacker, a professional fisherman in 
the Swiss town of Nordbaden, is pleased 
that fish will be more plentiful now. But, 
he says, “we still can’t live off fishing 
alone, as we once did.” 
The idea of an integrated ecosystem 
that will enable a rich variety of animal and 
plant life to thrive in the Rhine and its 
branches once more has come a long way. 
In 1998, the ministers of the Commission 
set targets to restore natural areas as part 
of a global ecosystem stretching from the 
mouth of the Rhine to the Jura, the Alps, 
the Rhine mountain range, the old soft- 
wood forests of the floodplains, and 
streams of the Rhineland-Palatinate, the 
Black Forest and the Vosges. 
Meanwhile, not all the pollution pro- 
blems have been solved. One of the most 
serious is in the Rhine delta’s huge basin in 
the Netherlands, where toxin-filled mud 
dredged from the port of Rotterdam has 
been dumped since the 1970s. Contamina- 
tion levels are falling now, but several of the 
old toxins in the river’s sediment are only 
very slowly being eliminated. And all along 
the Rhine, the main source of pollution is 
still farm fertilisers, which seep into the river 
every time it rains. [|

Or of the oldest interstate bodies set up

It was 
New Deal's far-reaching public works program-

have delegated authority to the TVA. The 
hydrological basin of the 1,600-kilometer-long 
Tennessee River, a branch of the Ohio, drains 
sections of Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, 
Alabama, Tennessee and Kentucky. 
Those states and the federal government 
set various priorities when the TVA was set up, 
including bringing the river's erratic water 
levels under control to prevent flooding, buil- 
ding a series of hydroelectric plants and brin- 
ging electricity to remote areas. Twenty-one 
dams and six reservoirs were built. The entire 
system enabled the growth and modernisation 
of farming and the reforestation of some areas. 
Today, the TVA is considered an outstan- 
ding example of regional planning. [|

DOING IT 
THEIR OWN WAY 
  
D ff Archer 
  
WORLD OF LEARNING 
Whether for religious reasons or out of a strong desire to do things differently, a growing 
number of parents in the United States are choosing to educate their children at home 
Twenty years ago, Christopher and 
Eileen Herman would have technically 
been breaking the law. Opting against 
conventional schooling, the parents are tea- 
ching their two children at their home in 
Washington state, where until 19835, the only 
legal way to home school was to hold a state 
teaching license—something they both lack. 
But today, the Hermans not only can 
teach their children at home without fear of 
prosecution, they also have an extensive array 
of resources and supports at their disposal. 
They belong to three local organizations of 
parents who educate their children at home, 
attend state-wide home schoolers’ conven- 
tions, and regularly cull advice from similar 
families on the Internet. “Just about everybody 
knows someone who’shome schooling,” Mrs. 
Herman says. “People may still think 1t’s kind 
of odd, but there 1sn’t as much suspicion or 
hostility anymore.” 
 
Legal recognition 
Indeed, the Hermans are part of one of the 
fastest growing educational trends in the Uni- 
ted States. By some estimates, the number of 
home schooled children 1n the country has 
grown from roughly 50,000 mn the mid-1980s 
to at least one million today. (Others peg the 
population as high as 1.8 million). While that 
still represents at most only three percent of 
the total number of the country’s school-aged 
children, the rapid rise in the popularity of 
home schooling deserves notice. It has quickly 
become the second most popular form of non- 
government sponsored education in the U.S., 
now outranked only by the schools atfilhated 
with the Roman Catholic church. 
“One big accomplishment of the move- 
ment 1s that they've made home schooling a 
viable educational option,” says Mitchell Ste- 
vens, a sociologist at Hamilton College in 
Clinton, N.Y. and the author of an upcoming 
book on home schooling. “It now has a small 
place in the menu of educational choices in 
this country.”

Stress-free learning? By some estimates, at least one million American children are home schooled. 
T he forces behind the movement are com - 
plex, and the bigger 1t gets, the harder it 
becomes to describe a “typical” home schoo- 
ler. Most experts see two very different 
lineages. One was born in the late 1960s from 
the alternative school movement, whose fol- 
lowers believe children learn best when libe- 
rated from the rigid structures of formal 
schooling and allowed to pursue their own 
interests. T he other was largely fueled by the 
concerns of some conservative Protestant 
families who—at about the same time—began 
to worry that the public schools could no lon- 
ger ensure the proper formation of their chil- 
dren’s character. “Both are skeptical of the 
bureaucratic organization of education,” Ste- 
vens says. “It’s a matter of, ‘I don’t want 
someone else taking care of my children.” 
Until the 1980s, home schooling in the 
United States was still largely an underground 
activity, without legal recognition. But as the 
number of practitioners grew, judges and 
prosecutors became more willing to accept 
that home schooling was permitted under 
legal provisions allowing children who weren't 
in school to be ‘otherwise instructed.’ In 1983, 
advocates formed the Home School Legal 
Defense Association to push the issue in state 
legislatures and to provide legal representation 
to individual home schooling families. 
Today, the practice 1s recognized as legal 
in all 50 states, although its regulation varies 
greatly. Idaho, for example, places very few res- 
trictions on home schooling parents, not even 
asking that they inform any state or local offi- 
cials of their intentions. Oregon, meanwhile, 
mandates that such families periodically have 
a ‘qualified neutral person’ test their chil- 
dren. Nowhere mm the U.S. are parents now 
required—as they once were in Washington 
state—to be licensed teachers. A few states call 
for parents to either have some college edu- 
cation or follow a home schooling ‘qualifier’ 
course at a community college. 
State laws often stipulate the number of 
days of instruction and the general content 
areas to be covered by families. But while 
these provisions usually call on parents to 
keep records of their children’s progress, they 
are generally not required to turn these over »

Keeping in tune: taking part in extra-curricular activities outside the home is just one way of interacting with other children. 
to a government body. “Even the most rigo- 
rously regulated states in America have some 
flexibility—a recognition that your child may 
be learning at a different pace,” says Patrick 
Farenga, president of Holt Associates, a Cam- 
bridge (Massachusetts)-based publisher of 
home schooling materials. State and local 
school districts vary in how they accommo- 
date home-schooled children. In some cases, 
they are allowed to participate in field trips or 
sign up for certain classes while in others, 
school officials do not let them join any extra- 
curricular activities. 
Although conservative Protestants appear 
to make up the largest single bloc of home 
schoolers, the movement is diversifying.In 
recent years,Catholic, Muslim, and Jewish 
home schoolers have formed their own orga- 
nizations, and the practice continues to attract 
a substantial number of more secular-min- 
ded families. Surveys by the National Home 
Education Research Institute in Salem (Ore- 
gon) suggest that religion still is the most com- 
mon reason for home schooling, but the 
research centre also has identified five other 
strong motivations:concern about the aca- 
demic quality of local conventional schools; 
a belief that the best education also is the most 
individualized; the desire to enhance rela- 
tionships among family members; an attempt 
to mitigate the negative influences of peer 
pressure; and worries that schools are beco- 
ming increasingly unsafe. Often, these rea- 
1 4 The Ungsco Courier - June 2000 
sons overlap. 
Home schooling techniques vary as much 
as the motivations for doing it. In a country 
with no national curriculum,states are res- 
ponsible for setting educational standards, 
which are generally only loosely applied to 
home schoolers. Parents generally put toge- 
ther their instructional plan themselves. Hun- 
dreds of publishers now produce materials 
geared toward home schoolers, their wares 
sold through the World Wide Web, in specia- 
lized magazines and conventions. T hey reflect 
a wide array of educational approaches and 
philosophies, from non-denominational cor- 
respondence courses to materials “built upon 
the firm foundation of scriptural truth” and 
not the “pseudo-scientific jargon of the secu- 
lar educationists.” 
Trust in public schools 
The few large-scale research projects that 
have been carried out in the United States 
suggest that the home schooled children 
whose families participated in the studies tend 
to perform well above the national average on 
standardized tests. But many researchers are 
hesitant to make too much of such findings, 
because of the obvious self-selection problem. 
Further,many agree that a substantial num- 
ber of home schoolers remain underground, 
refusing to be counted by state or local autho- 
rities, and making it difficult to reach conclu- 
sions. 
Perhaps one of the best indications of 
success is home schooling’s growing reco- 
gnition by American colleges and universi- 
ties. The Home School Legal Defense Asso- 
ciation recently surveyed more than 500 
institutions of higher learning and found 
that all but two had admissions policies for 
evaluating home schooled students who lack 
traditional high school records. Many col- 
leges now accept evidence of student pro- 
gress prepared by parents, portfolios of their 
work, and standardized tests in place of 
transcripts. 
Despite its growing acceptance, parents 
still are sometimes brought before judges in 
disagreements over whether they've correctly 
followed state regulations. In a highly-publi- 
cized case last year, a Vermont home schoo- 
ler was jailed for two weeks for refusing to let 
state examiners evaluate her 15-year-old son. 
State officials argued that they needed to make 
sure the boy—reputed by local school offi- 
cials to have learning deficiencies—was being 
adequately served at home. 
While public approval of home schoo- 
ling has spread, it isn’t universal. A 1997 
survey co-sponsored by the Gallup polling 
organization and the international educa- 
tion organization Phi Delta Kappa showed 
that 57 per cent of Americans think home 
schooling is a ‘bad thing’—though this was 
down from the 73 per cent reported 12 
years earlier. The National Education Asso-

ciation, the country’s largest teachers’ 
union, also maintains a policy statement 
arguing that, “home schooling programs 
cannot provide the student with a compre- 
hensive education experience.” The Natio- 
nal Association of Elementary School Prin- 
cipals has issued a similar warning, adding 
that government authorties should “make 
certain that those who exercise these 
options are held strictly accountable for the 
academic achievement and social/emotio- 
nal growth of children.” A major part of 
their concern is that home schooled stu- 
dents may not learn enough about relating 
to children from other backgrounds. 
Home schoolers themselves disagree 
about how big the movement will grow. 
Some predict a straight-line growth for 
many more years, while others see it soon 
reaching a point of diminishing returns. 


### 119977: European disunity

EUROPEAN DISUNITY 
  
DP Cynthia Guttman 
WORLD OF LEARNING 
Polls suggest that most Americans remain 
satisfied with their local public schools, 
which educate about 90 per cent of the 
country’s students. But most observers 
agree that, however large, home schooling 
has established itself as a lasting feature in 
the landscape of American education. As 
parent and publisher Patrick Farenga puts 
it, “the concept of education is no longer 
held to the schools like monks in a monas- 
tery.” [| 
Parents throughout Europe are becoming bolder about educating their children at home, 
even if it means defending their rights in court 
The continent that has adopted a 
B single currency is a long way from 
unity on home education. Although 
data remains scarce, support groups in seve- 
ral countries claim that they are receiving 
increasing numbers of requests from parents 
looking for alternatives to formal school sys- 
tems, a movement being matched by legis- 
lative attempts to curtail its practice. 
According to Amanda Petrie, one of a 
handful of European researchers on the 
subject,there is an underlying thread run- 
ning through recent legislative changes sug- 
gesting that “if you are not in school, you 
are not learning.” In Ireland, an Education 
(Welfare) Bill put forward for discussion in 
1999 treats home education as a school 
attendance problem,rather than as a right 
guaranteed by the Constitution, which 
declares that the primary educator of the 
child is the family. With the expressed 
intention of cracking down on sects, the 
French parliament voted a new law in 
December 1998 obliging parents to follow 
the national curriculum more closely and 
inspectors to visit their children once a year 
in the home. T he law was passed by a hand- 
ful of deputies without consulting with 
representatives of the home education com- 
munity. For Elyane Delmares of the French 
support group Les Enfants d’Abord, “it’s a 
bogus argument. The state already has a 
whole arsenal of weapons to fight sects. 
This is really about the state having a stron- 
ger hold on education” 
Support groups say these controls cast 
home education in a negative light and 
reflect misconceptions about how learning 
takes place outside school. For Petrie,impo-

pectors into the home are two examples. The 
first assumes that “the state knows what edu- 
cation is, takes a certain formula, and if you 
apply this formula, your child is going to be 
fine.” The second discriminates against 
people who are “not upper middle classes 
with reams of bookcases in the home.” 
The value of 
informal learning 
But even in countries where the prac- 
tice is tightly restricted, ambiguity often 
prevails. In Spain, where schooling is com- 
puslory up to 16 years of age—special cir- 
cumstances aside—a court ruled in 1999 
in favour of parents from Almeria who are 
educating their seven-year-old child. In 
Germany, where home education is illegal, 
several families have gone to court and paid 
fines but they have been allowed to conti- 
nue the practice. After returning from a 
posting in Micronesia, Dorothee Becker 
and her husband found that their two chil- 
dren were unable to adapt to the German 
school system. “It didn’t offer the variety 
we had hoped for, especially in languages 
and science,” says Becker, who has been to 
court once. In the Netherlands, authorities 
have refused 90 per cent of homeschooling 
requests, acccording to Syne Fonk, head of 
the support group Syntax. In response, a 
growing number of parents are starting up 
their own private schools. 
Increasing research on home education 
would be a first step to breaking through 
some of the misconceptions surrounding the 
field, still widely shunned by the academic 
community. Studies are most advanced in 
the UK, which has Europe’s strongest home 
education community, with an estimated 
10,000 children. There can be one hundred 
different reasons for making the commit- 
ment,ranging from a simple question of phi- 
losophy, to concern about bullying and beha- 
vioural problems at school to religious 
convictions. Alan Thomas, a visiting fellow 
at the University of London Institute of Edu- 
cation,carried out in depth-research on 100 
families in Britain and Australia to provide 
one of the first detailed accounts of how 
parents go about the task of teaching their 
children at home. Besides shorter lessons and 
extra individual attention, Thomas noted the 
far-reaching impact of informal and shared 
learning and the importance of conversation 
that is all too often lacking in school. He 
found that children had “high confidence in 
their ability to learn, high self-esteem and are 
socially mature in a way many who have been 
to school are not. They've not experienced 
failure. If you don’t understand something, 
you deal with it there and then.” 
Petrie takes the debate one step further, 
emphasizing that the right to home educa- 
tion should be a principle of democracy. “I 
think it comes down to a question of how 
much confidence the state hasin the parent’s 
ability to know what is right for their own 
children. The debate hinges on that.” [|

Women’s long 
march to 
power 
century of feminism has failed to overturn several millennia of 
patriarchy: proof is the fate of women in many parts of the world today 
(p. 17). But from unrelenting battles to fragile victories (pp. 18-20),by 
the end of the twentieth century women had learned to defend their welfare 
and their interests. The two sexes, they say, are different but have equal 
rights and responsibilities. 
Little by little, women have undermined the old order that sealed their inequi- 
table fate. By standing in the forefront of struggles against apartheid and male 
domination, South African women are considered as role models: the power 
they have won has enabled them to impose laws sanctioning the violence to 
which they are subjected (pp. 20-21).Iranian women have not yet reached that 
point, but they are seizing every opportunity, from education to the ballot box, 
to strengthen their rights (pp.22-23 ). The struggle for equality in the work- 
place (pp. 23-24) and reproductive rights (pp. 24-25) are other aspects of 
women’s emancipation that are still high on the agenda, five years after the 
Beijing women’s conference. 
Despite their massive and henceforth world-wide mobilisation, women still 
encounter obstacles to political participation, where they remain a tiny mino- 
rity (pp. 28-29 and 30-31). Kept back by mentalities and societies that are moving 
ahead at a snail's pace, in the private sphere they are negotiating a new sha- 
ring of time with men (pp. 26-27). Following a path opened up in northem Europe, 
women in countries such as India (pp. 32-33) have obtained quotas that 
ensure more democratic representation. 
In South Korea and elsewhere, they have created political breeding grounds 
to motivate and train the leaders of tomorrow 
(pp. 34-35). 
A genuine renewal of political leadership 
seems to be under way. It promises to be one of 
the more important breakthroughs of the century 
that has just begun (pp. 35-36 and 37).

trafficking, acid-throwing, dowry deaths and 
ther kinds of torture. At the opening of this 
new century, women are still not considered as equal 
human beings in many parts of the world.Religion and 
patriarchy continue to have an all-encroaching hold 
on their lives, maintaining and justifying their age-old 
oppression.In some South Asian societies, this hold 
is even increasing. 
I do not believe that there can be real equality in 
a society dominated by religion. Western countries 
speak repeatedly about the necessity of economic 
development to alleviate poverty. But this is not 
enough.Societies such as Saudi Arabia may be eco- 
nomically developed, but women are deprived of all 
rights. The supremacy of religion is incompatible 
with freedom of expression, women’s rights and 
democracy. This is why I see religion as the main 
enemy of women’s development. 
We have to act on several fronts at once. First of all, 
improving access to education. In a society like Ban- 
gladesh, 80 per cent of women are illiterate. For centu- 
ries women have been taught they are the slaves of men. 
It is very hard to change their minds, to make them aware 
of their oppression, to give them a sense of their inde- 
pendence. T his educational effort has to go hand in 
hand with a secular feminist movement in society. Such 
movements have to start within the country and they 
cannot take hold when people are uneducated and una- 
ware of their oppression. I’m not sure you can accom- 
plish much from the outside, except to expose in the 
media the atrocities women in all too many countries face 
in their day to day lives. 
In Muslim countries, this movement is emerging, 
but very timidly, and it has a slim margin of maneuver. 
It has the uphill task of fighting for the repeal of religious 
laws and the introduction of a uniform civil code. So far, 
it tends to be constituted by a few individual feminists 
who are forced to be diplomatic, to compromise with 
fundamentalists, be they men or women. But they are 
trying to change the system, step by step, and it will take 
a very long time. People are not yet ready to do away 
with religious laws that impact upon every aspect of 
society, from education and health to the workplace and 
the home. 
For women’s status to change, we also need enligh- 
tened leaders who believe in equality. In countries such

as mine, women with a strong voice do not have the 
support of political leaders, whether they be men or 
women. Look at the countries in which women are in 
politics, or even heads of state. Does it follow that 
women in those countries are emancipated? Because 
oflong-standing vested interests, such leaders continue 
to back measures that oppress women. T hey are not 
ideologically committed to changing these condi- 
tions. In South Asia, most of the women who become 
heads of state are religious, and like men, they adhere 
to the religious objectives of the Establishment. I am 
the victim of a country where the prime minister is a 
woman. Because | went one step too far in denoun- 
cing religion and the oppression that it keeps women 
under, I had to leave my country. 
Until a society is not based 
on religion and women 
are considered equal to men 
before the law, | do not think 
that politics will advance 
the cause of women 
I have seen women oppose me when I talked 
about women’s rights. They said straight out that 
God did not believe that women should have so 
many rights. And [ have met men in my country who 
are against what is said in the religious scriptures and 
believe in equality between men and women. It 
does not depend on gender. It depends on one’s 
conscience. Muslim women who are wearing the veil 
and glorifying their subservience are obviously not 
going to better the lives of the oppressed. 
Until a society is not based on religion and women 
are considered equal to men before the law, I do not 
think that politics will advance the cause of women.In 
Western countries, women are educated, they are 
treated equally, they have access to jobs. In these 
conditions, their participation in politics has a meaning. 
Education, a secular feminist movement, and 
leaders—both men and women—com mitted to equa- 
lity and justice. T his is what it will take to change the 
dire conditions which too many women still face 
today. It will take a very long time, but we are here to 
work towards that end. [|

decades, their struggle has truly become global, but all is far from won

e often hear that this will be the century 
W- women, in light of the tremendous 
strides that have been made in the past 
thirty years or so. Although it is far too soon to 
confirm this prediction, it can safely be asserted 
that the twentieth century was marked by their 
struggle to leave the home, where they were confi- 
ned by the ancestral division of roles along gender 
lines. Around the world, women have campaigned 
to win the rights they have been denied and to 
build, side-by-side with men, the future of the 
planet. 
True, such struggles had already been waged 
in the past, although they were deliberately shun- 
ned in official historical accounts. But the brief 
revolts of this special “minority”, which accounts 
for over half of humanity, did not change the 
place of women in their societies. They may have 
ruled the roost, sometimes enjoying undeniable 
respect, but nevertheless they were still born to 
serve men and bring their husbands’ descendants 
into the world. 
Education: 
their first struggle 
Yet, at the start of the twentieth century, the 
traditional distribution of roles, seemingly legiti- 
mised by every religion and frozen in a “natural” 
order, began to crumble under the two-pronged 
assault of modernisation and women’s struggle 
for their collective emancipation. They waged 
many battles to gradually obtain, despite set- 
backs, a change in their status—which is still far 
from achieved. 
The first struggle of the twentieth century was 
for education. In 1861, a young woman gradua- 
ted in France with a baccalaureate, a highschool 
leaving exam, for the first time. In 1900, the first 
female university was founded in Japan.The same 
year, girls won the right to secondary education in 
Egypt and the first girls’school opened in Tunisia. 
Young women who could made the most of these 
new educational opportunities, not only to beco- 
me better household managers and good educa- 
tors for their children, as the main discourse of 
the period suggests, but also to do something 
unprecedented: to enter the forbidden spheres of 
public life, to exercise citizenship and to partici- 
pate in politics. 
Throughout the twentieth century, women 
waged a battle on two fronts: by fighting for their 
own rights and taking part in the major social and 
political emancipation movements. In 1917, the 
Russian Bolshevik Alexandra Kollontai became 
the world’s first woman cabinet minister. African 
American Rosa Parks triggered the civil rights 
movement by refusing to give up her seat to a 
white man on an Alabama bus in 1955. Djamila 
Boupacha was a heroine of Algeria’s war for inde- 
pendence. Women were entirely committed to the 
goals of these movements but seldom received 
anything in return for participating in them.Once 
their countries’ new masters took power, they 
often found themselves sent back to the kitchen. 
But they continued fighting for their own rights, 
and it is on this front that they achieved their 
greatest victories. 
The earliest feminist movements, which first 
appeared in the West in the late nineteenth centu- 
ry, focused on workplace and civil rights issues. 
Industry needed women’s labour, which was 
underpaid in comparison with that of their male 
counterparts. ‘Equal pay for equal work!” deman- 
ded American and European women, who began 
setting up their own trade unions and organizing 
strikes. They made unquestionable strides, but 
after more than one century of struggle, most 
women around the world still earn less pay for 
equal work. 
The right to vote 
The second objective of the twentieth centu- 
ry’s pioneers was participation in public life, 
which hinged first and foremost on having the 
right to vote. The struggle was long and some- 
times violent, as shown by the British “suffra- 
gettes” who demonstrated in the streets or 
Chinese women who made their demands heard

### 119981: One battle after another

by invading their country’s new parliament in 
1912. Everywhere, the fierce resistance of the 
political world progressively yielded to determi- 
ned women’s movements. 
Scandinavia is where women first won the 
right to vote and to run for election, with Finland 
leading the way in 1906. The First World War 
thrust them into the forefront, with most 
European women winning the right to vote in 
1918 and 1919, although French and Italian 
women had to wait until after the Second World 
War to at last be recognized as citizens. Outside 
the West, women also organized to demand their 
rights. Groups were founded in Turkey, Egypt and 
India. In 1930, the first congress of women from 
the Near and Middle East gathered in Damascus 
to demand equality. Throughout this period, 
women everywhere declared that, outside of 
motherhood, they had the right to be just like 
men, and that men could not deny them this 
right. 
Control over their 
own bodies 
For a while, women’s rights movements took a 
back seat to the Second World War and liberation 
struggles in the European colonies. The fight 
against fascism and, after 1945, colonialism, 
mobilized all their energy. Women distinguished 
themselves in these struggles, but that did not suf- 
fice to establish their rights as a gender. However, 
the world continued to change. With independen- 
ce, many women in the South won access to 
schooling, salaried employment and, in a few 
exceptional cases, the closed world of politics. In 
Western countries, the post-war period saw them 
enter the work force on a massive scale. The gap 
between social reality and the discriminatory laws 
defended by exclusively male power structures 
grew wider. 
In the West,the second generation of feminists 
emerged in the wake of the libertarian move- 
ments of 1968. Picking up where their elders left 
off, they broadened the scope of their demands, 
for late-twentieth century feminists no longer 
aspired to the right to be “just like men”. 
Challenging the claim of the “white male” to 
represent universality, their goal was to achieve 
equality while remaining distinct as women.T he 
women’s liberation movement that first emerged 
in the American middle-class claimed the right to 
control one’s own body. Feminists fought for 
contraception and abortion rights in many coun- 
tries where one or both were against the law, and 
for autonomy and equality within the couple. 
“The personal is political,” proclaimed women 
inspired by Marxism and psychoanalysis. 
“Workers of the world, who washes your socks?’ 
chanted demonstrators in the streets of Paris in 
the 1970s. In France, the Veil law legalizing abor- 
tion unleashed emotional debate in 1974. 
Many Third World women could not identify 
with the struggles being waged in the West and

» bodies that until then had decided the world’s 
future without them, struggling against religious 
fundamentalism that jeopardizes their modest 
gains. 
Misogyny of the 
political class 
Of course, the struggle of Kuwaiti women 
against those who have denied them the right to 
vote or Indian women against the forced abortion 
of female feetuses is not the same as American 
women’s battle against their own fundamentalists 
or French women’s campaign against the misogy- 
ny of the political class. Women’s movements take 
different approaches depending on the continent 
and do not necessarily have the same priorities, 
but the struggle has nonetheless become global 
during the past several decades. In the last 
twenty-five years, women have gradually in- 
creased their presence in public life, although it 
can hardly be said that the doors are wide open 
for them. From Africa to Asia, women’s organiza- 
tions have multiplied and acquired experience. 
But their victories remain incomplete and the 
future is uncertain. From the nightmare of 
Afghan women to the ways in which equality is 
resisted in the so-called most advanced countries, 
the obstacles show that there is still a long way to 
go. Will women see the end of the struggle in this 
century that has just begun, the one which sup- 
posedly belongs to them? [|

that gathered some 30,000 participants from 189 coun-

for Action adopted in 1995. Divided into 12 areas of critical 
concern, this set of commitments calls for economic oppor-

care, full political and economic participation and the pro- 
motion of human rights, among others. Meanwhile, women 
are on the march to demand an end to poverty and violence.

2 0 The Unesco Courier - June 2000 
ght after South Africa’s second democratic elec- 
R-- in June 1999, the newly elected President 
Thabo Mbeki appointed eight women to minis- 
terial positions, double the number in the first govern- 
ment. The country ranks seventh in the world in 
terms of women parliamentary representatives (25 per 
cent), while the South African constitution and the 
African National Congress (ANC) government have 
entrenched gender equality as a key political value, 
significant achievements on a continent where women 
are all too often regarded as secondary citizens. 
The moral support of leaders such as Oliver Tambo 
and Nelson Mandela notwithstanding, women’s gains 
result from a well-articulated strategy that took shape 
within the ANC well before its 1994 electoral victory. 
With a transition to democracy in progress in the early 
1990s, this strategy focused sharply on representation 
issues. In 1991, women within the ANC demanded a 
quota of seats on the National Executive Committee. 
They failed, but in 1994, the ANC was the only party 
to adopt a 30 per cent quota of women on its electoral 
lists. When the ANC started drafting the Reconstruc- 
tion and Development Programme, the backbone of 
its electoral manifesto, women’s groups within the party 
lobbied hard for it to address their concerns regarding 
employment, health and land ownership. T his lobbying 
was bolstered by a powerful grassroots movement that 
shared the aim of making South Africa a non-racial, 
but also a non-sexist democracy. Women from all walks 
of life formed a National Coalition in 1992, which tur-

ned gender representation into a multiparty concern. 
Accompanying the drive to get women into power was 
an emphasis on getting them out to vote through tar- 
geted campaigns. 
Opposition from traditional leaders 
Once in government, women were influential 
in drafting the constitution, adopted in 1996.The 
task was not always easy. Even though the coun- 
try touted itself as a non-sexist democracy, in 
pushing for the insertion of an equality clause, 
women ran into strong opposition from several 
traditional leaders, including some within the 
political fold of the ANC, who argued that it 
conflicted with the protection of custom and tra- 
dition.Strong political lobbying efforts by women 
MPs such as Mavivi Manzini, Baleka Mbete and 
Thenjiwe Mtintso undercut the arguments of the 
traditional leaders. Women MPs were also instru- 
mental in getting clauses included on reproducti- 
ve rights as well as socio-economic rights. 
An ANC gathering on the eve of the country’s first democratic elections in April 1994. 
The women were 
courageous, persistent, 
enthusiastic, 
indefatigable, and their 
protest against the pass 
system set 
a standard for anti- 
government protests 
that was never equalled. 
Nelson Mandela, former South 
African president (1918-) 
— 
Most women who entered Parliament in 1994 
were committed to advancing the rights of South 
African women—an inevitable source of tension 
when their positions came into conflit with those of 
their respective parties. Still, a number of routes 
were pursued to break through this ‘loyalty’ dilemma. 
By far the most successful structure for advancing 
women’s rights has been the Joint Committee on the 
Improvement of Quality of Life and Status of Women. 
Grouping women from across party lines, this par- 
liamentary committee consults with women’s orga-

Women’s long march to power 
women would not have been passed. In particular,the 
Termination of Pregnancy Act provides women with 
access to abortion under significantly broader and 
more favourable conditions than in the past. The 
Maintenance Act of 1998 substantially improves the 
position of mothers dependent on child support 
from their former partners. Free health services have 
been provided for pregnant women and children 
under the age of six. T he 1998 Domestic Violence Act 
was important in sensitizing the judiciary to the fact 
that violence within families was a public matter. 
The committee has also stood behind a budget ini- 
tiative which analyzes how different ministries allo- 
cate resources specifically to benefit women. 
These gains are laudable. But despite the 
significant number of women in cabinet—many 
of whom come from an activist background — 
they have been unable to oppose cutbacks in 
social service spending or increases in arms 
expenditure (the deputy minister of defense is a 
Quaker and head of the ANC’s women’s parlia- 
mentary caucus). And although health minister 
Dr Manto Tshabalala is a woman and longtime 
gender activist, she has not supported women’s 
organizations’ demand for the HIV/Aids drug 
AZT to be offered to pregnant women and rape 
survivors.l The government has argued that the 
option is unaffordable, a position not necessarily 
held by women within the ANC, nor, for that 
matter, by the opposition. 
Securing leadership positions 
in political parties 
In the 1999 election campaign, no party ques- 
tioned the principle of gender representation. 
Instead, the focus shifted to specific policy issues 
such as violence against women, unemployment, 
housing and health care, with national television 
and radio allotting air time to debate the positions 
held by the competing parties. Women activists 
pointed out that despite the formal commitments 
to gender equality, political parties failed to outli- 
ne policy positions on key gender issues. For 
example, not one party had a policy with regard 
to dealing with violence against women despite 
the fact that South Africa has one of the highest 
incidence of rape in the world. 
These interventions during elections highlighted 
the need for women to become significantly more 
organized within political parties and to hold lea- 
dership positions within them. This will give women 
MPs the support they need to become even more 
effective within the legislative arena, but also ensure 
that internal party mechanisms exist to hold them 
accountable to women members and not just party 
leadership. Joyce Piliso-Seroke,chairperson of the 
Commission on Gender Equality, has commented 
that a long climb remains. The government, she 
said, “talks the talk of gender equality, without wal- 
king the walk. The Domestic Violence and Main- 
tenance Acts will remain just so many words unless 
infrastructure and human resources are provided to 
make them effective.” [|

campaign, in an overcoat and a head-scarf. No 
way will I put on the chador.” Elaheh Koulai, a 
university professor elected to parliament as a repre- 
sentative of Tehran in the February 18, 2000 legisla- 
tive elections, unleashed a political storm when she 
made this quasi-revolutionary proclamation. Since 
the advent of the Islamic Republic in 1979, all women 
holding official positions have worn the chador, the 
long, black fabric covering that conceals the entire body 
from head to toe. 
Marzieh Dabagh, an outgoing member of parlia- 
ment who was not re-elected, reacted to Koulai’s sta- 
tements by threatening to “box the ears” of any woman 
¢ ll go to parliament dressed as I was during my 
who would dare come to the Majlis (the Iranian par- 
liament) without the traditional chador. The brother 
of the Guide of the Islamic Republic, Hadi Kha- 
menel, a leading member of the reformist camp, had 
to step in and cool tempers down, saying that all 
forms of veils, from the simple head-scarf to the 
chador, are acceptable. 
This debate may seem trite, but it reveals the 
assertiveness of women in Iranian society, including 
outside Tehran, where they are seldom seen without 
the chador. Fatemeh Khatami (no relation to the pre- 
sident) was elected to parliament in Mashhad, not far 
from the Afghan border, even though she does not 
wear the chador, an unprecedented event in the pro- 
vinces. 
An educated generation 
A symbol of the Islamic order, the obligation to wear 
the veil has never prevented women from standing 
up for their rights. At the beginning of the revolution, 
the government tried to send them back into the 
home, primarily with offers of early retirement and 
incentives to work less. But officials soon gave up in the 
face of resistance (women were accustomed to gentler 
treatment under the Shah, especially if they belonged 
to the elite) and the needs of the country, then at war 
with Iraq. Today, women account for 12 per cent of the 
work force. Although the figure is the same asin 1979, 
itis likely to rise as new generations of better-educated 
women enter the labour market. 
For women have taken full advantage of the literacy 
for all campaign launched after the revolution, espe- 
cially in the countryside, which had remained back- 
ward under the Shah. Today the percentage of girls in 
school is almost the same as that of boys (nearly 80 per 
cent). Young women account for 40 per cent of uni- 
versity students and, two years ago, for the first time 
more girls than boys were admitted to the competitive 
national entrance examinations. T his year, they even 
make up 58 per cent of the accepted candidates. 
“Almost all leisure activities are closed to girls,” 
explains lawyer and women’s rights advocate Meh- 
ranguiz Kar. “So they focus on their studies.” 
Women are still overwhelmingly underrepresented 
in political decision-making bodies, but they play a 
decisive role as voters. “Their turn-out has been outs- 
tanding since the May 1997 legislative ballot, which 
helped elect President Khatami,” continues Kar. “The 
women’s vote is a conscious vote. They carefully 
choose candidates who are in favour of their rights.” 
In February 1999, they made use of their power to vote 
some 300 women into municipal councils during the 
first local elections since 1979. In the rather traditional

provincial cities and towns, these results reflect a 
“revolution of mentalities”, says Fatemeh Jalaipour, a 
Tehran municipal council member responsible for 
women’s issues. 
The women’s vote also helped reformers win the 
legislative elections. Some interior ministry officials say 
that women outnumbered men voters: 55 per cent 
compared with 45 per cent. But, as journalist Said 
Leylaz points out, “this time they didn’t vote specifically 
for women candidates,” even though their number 
increased by 70 per cent compared with the last legis- 
lative elections. Like the outgoing M ajlis, the new par- 
liament has only fifteen women deputies (out of 290), 
but they are moderates rather than conservatives. 
A voice in the press 
Women must still settle for a backseat in politics, but 
they hold a growing number of senior civil service 
positions. Since taking office in 1997, President 
Mohammad Khatami has asked his ministers to appoint 
women to head up the various ministerial depart- 
ments. And his brother, Mohammad Reza Khatami, 
who leads the Islamic Iran Participation Front, said after 
that movement won the last elections, “We are in 
favour of women entering the government.” 
The rise of Iranian women is partly due to their 
own mobilization efforts. After the Iran-Iraq war, 
many of them organized all kinds of activities within 
religious organizations, often spurred on by the 
government. Since 1997, they have rushed into the 
liberalization process begun by Mohammad Kha- 
tami to set up more independent non-governmental 
organizations, despite resistance from conservatives, 
who until now have controlled the committee in 
charge of issuing permits. Today, the social fabric is 
partly based on women. “In Tehran,several hundred 
grassroots mutual aid, environmental protection and 
Women’s long march to power 
other groups are headed by women,” says Jalaipour. 
Likewise, the number of young women on student 
councils is steadily on the rise. And, says Kar, women 
head over 40 publishing companies, most of which 
print books on women’s issues or by women authors. 
The press has also played a key role. As early as 
1990, women Muslim intellectuals founded the 
monthly Zanan (Women, in Farsi), where they cam- 
paign for a revision of their legal status and a more 
modern form of Islam. They are demanding the same 
rights as men with regard to inheritance (under sharia, 
they are entitled to only half as much as men), divorce 
(they can be repudiated for no apparent reason) and 
child custody (which is denied them if their daughter 
1s over seven and their son over two). Only a few 
minor touch-ups have been made in the past several 
years to correct these inequalities. For example, a 
woman may now request that her right to ask for a 
divorce be recognized in the marriage contract. 
Widely read by young women, Zanan boasts a cir- 
culation of 30,000, one of the highest runs of any Ira- 
nian monthly. However, there as elsewhere, the 
debate over the interpretation of Islamic rules still 
dominates the issue of gender equality, which limits 
the scope of the feminist movement.“ Advocates of 
secularism still cannot organize as such,” says Kar. 
They have voiced their concerns on several occasions 
within non-governmental groups such as the Orga- 
nization of Women Journalists and through the 
women’s press, in Zanan and the daily Zan, before it 
was shut down less than one year ago. 
“We're going to have new laws passed in favour 
of gender equality,” said Elaheh Koulai after she 
won the election. The deputy’s determination is 
likely to put her on a collision course with irate 
conservatives, who view the “loosening of moral 
standards” as a sign of their political defeat. [|

lower. The former look after hospital apparatus and 
require less education. 
The case has revolved around job evaluations. The 
midwives’employers maintain that there is no salary 
gap between the two work categories since they receive 
compensation for night shifts and work four hours 
less. The medical technicians work days only. T he 
Ombudsman has argued that basic monthly wages 
should be compared, not those taking compensation 
for shift work into account. The Labour Court turned 
to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg, 
which ruled in April that basic salaries should be com- 
pared, taking the case back to the Swedish court. 
“The most significant thing about these cases 
is that they are all focusing on the difference in pay 
between different professions, one dominated by 
women,one by men.How do you prove that work 
is of equal value?T here is no precedent in our court 
about this,” explains Raija Lounavaara, of the Equal 
Opportunities office. 
If the nurses and midwives win their respective 
cases, their employers will be held liable for damages. 
It does not follow that the 400 nurses who filed com- 
plaints in 1995 will benefit. “But rulings stating that 
these persons have been discriminated against will 
send a very important message to trade unions and 
employers,” said Lounavaara. Nevertheless, the 
nurses’ union does not support the court cases which 
break with the Swedish tradition of collective agree- 
ments. It argues that wages are best set through nego- 
tiation and by relying on market forces, given the 
shortage of nurses. Since 1995, the union has streng- 
thened this negotiating process and obtained the 
sharpest wage hikes on the labour market. |

Peru: skewed planning

campaign to reverse coercive family planning policies

window. T he water boils, the dry clothes must be 
brought in, the children woken up. In the humble 
house where Damiana Barrientos lives in one of 
Lima’s southern suburbs, a new day is beginning. 
But for Damiana, thisisno ordinary dawn:today she 
must go to court. 
In February 2000, Damiana won the right to free 
medical care from the Peruvian health ministry until 
she makes a full recovery from an operation per- 
formed against her will. “Everything began in the 
maternity ward of a Lima hospital in 1998 when I gave 
birth to my baby, who died a few days after had a cae- 
sarean,” says Damiana. “There they cut my fallopian 
tubes and forged my signature on a paper saying I had 
consented. But complications emerged afterwards,and 
now I'm suffering from a dropped uterus.” She went 
to the courts, but though the state acknowledged that 
there were “deficiencies in the quality of care,” her case 
was closed. Thanks to lawyers from the Committee for 
the defence of women’s rights in Latin America and 
the Caribbean (CLADEM-Peru) and to the Movi- 
miento Amplio de Mujeres group (MAM), Damiana’s 
case was taken to the Inter-American Commission on 
Human Rights, where it is now awaiting sentence. To 
date, CLADEM has filed legal complaints over 243 
cases of forced sterilisation.! 
Since 1996, when the first evidence emerged of 
T: first rays of morning sun appear through the

collected and detailed in the report Nada personal. Reporte

Tamayo, was awarded Amnesty International’s Ginetta 
Saga prize for her work on behalf of women’s rights. 
serious violations of human rights through the imple- 
mentation of voluntary surgical sterilisation, M AM and 
CLADEM have sought to reform the family planning 
policy embraced by the Peruvian government in 1995, 
and aimed at reducing the birth rate in rural areas from 
5.6 children for each woman to an average of 2.5 
children by the year 2000. “Our goal was to ensure that 
women could freely opt for one of the various methods 
of family planning and get the government to provide 
information on all the alternatives rather than impose 
voluntary sterilisation as the only possible method,” 
says CLADEM’s Giulia Tamayo. 
“Health festivals” 
Accordingto CLADEM, the family planning pro- 
gramme heralded by President Alberto Fujimori as a 
way to make health services more democratic and 
transform women into “masters of their destiny”’has 
been converted since 1996 into a policy of forced 
sterilisation devoted to meeting national quotas, with 
surgical sterilisation as the only option. To make the 
latter more popular, “health festivals” were organized 
in which women were goaded into agreeing to undergo 
the operation. “We decided to have only two chil- 
dren.T hat’s why we chose to have our tubes cut, and 
we are happy!” Messages like this featured prominently 
on the colourful banners hoisted in villages to 
announce the health festivals, which would last bet- 
ween one and three days and include sporting activi- 
ties and public concerts. 
During the festivals, vaccination campaigns, 
tests for breast and uterus cancer and dental check- 
ups were promised, but not all of these services 
were provided.No official information is available 
on the number of festivals held between 1996 and

1998, though according to the health ministry, 
there were 463 “campaigns” in the first half of 
1996, which were attended by 120,000 people in 
remote rural areas. 
“These massive campaigns were preceded by 
home visits carried out by medical workers with the 
aim of winning over fertile women with more than four 
children. People lived in a state of permanent anxiety,” 
declares Tamayo. Reports collected by Tamayo indi- 
cate that couples were explained the benefits of the sur- 
gery, which was presented as the only option, before 
being forced to sign a document. Those who under- 
went the operation were then presented with 15 kilo- 
grammes of food, while the health worker who suc- 
cessfully persuaded the woman in question was 
awarded a bonus.

complaints proving that the poor sanitary conditions 
in which the sterilisations were carried out had caused 
serious complications, sometimes leading to death,

information for women,” she adds. M AM has since 
decided to distribute pamphlets listing the rights of 
health service users, and urging them to contact an 
emergency advice hotline in the event of any abuses 
of those rights. 
Official statistics report that 800,000 couples were 
attended by state family planning services in 1998, but 
that only 3.5 per cent chose voluntary sterilisation,and 
that so far the total number of sterilised men and 
women in Peru stands at 300,000 —in a proportion 
of 10 women to each man. Unofficial figures, in 
contrast, suggest that almost 500,000 people have 
undergone the surgery. 
Following the campaigns mounted by 
CLADEM and M AM, the health ministry has been 
forced to change its methods, and now incorporates 
the MAM pamphlet in the information it distributes, 
as well as offering two advice sessions to would-be 
patients: one on contraceptive methods, and the 
other on the contraceptive method chosen, including 
(if necessary) a briefing on the possible complica- 
ph
 
—
 
part and parcel of a vast systematic practice. In the 
absence of any official answers to its questions, 
CLADEM called on the press at the end of 1997 to 
make the complaints public and put direct pressure 
on the government. 
“Not all of the family planning programme is 
wrong. We don’t oppose it, but we want to point out 
the traumatic results of the coercive implementation 
of voluntary sterilisation,” observes MAM ’s Maria 
Esther Mogollon. In 1998, her organization decided 
to check out reports that had emerged from Lima and 
the country’s interior. “Fifty volunteers visited hospitals 
in 19 out of the 25 districts where the programme had 
been applied to talk with those affected and with doc- 
tors,” says Mogollon. “The two most serious pro- 
tions and irreversible nature of surgical sterilisation. 
A 72 hour-period between signing the consent form 
and the operation has also been granted to allow for 
any second thoughts. 
A year after the introduction of these reforms, 
Peru’s family planning programme now maintains a 
much lower profile. No health festivals have been 
staged this year, while according to authorities,demand 
for voluntary sterilisation has dropped by 30 per cent. 
The main goal of the women’s rights groups has been 
to condemn the devastating effects and psycholo- 
gical damage that have followed the operations, but 
their campaigns have helped ensure that poor rural 
people can plan their family freely, and learn the ways 
of responsible parenting. [|

The political arena 
  
For a fair sharing 
of time 
  
D Rosiska Darcy de Oliveira 
Women may have entered public life on a massive scale, but they are still 
on their own when it comes to running the household. A new balance must 
be struck if there is to be genuine democracy 
  
D President of the Centre for 
Women's Leadership (CELIM),Rio 
de Janeiro, Brazil 
2 6 The Unesco Courier - June 2000 
t the dawn of the 21st century, states and 
A: international community can no longer 
refute the fact that humanity is made up of 
two sexes, not just one.This discovery, a precious 
legacy of the century that just closed, has brought 
women’s existence into the limelight. One of the 
great democratic challenges for societies over the 
next century will be to mature so that both sexes 
are able to live their lives on an equal footing, 
with all their differences, contrasting history and 
culture, but also with equal rights and responsibi- 
lities. 
Women’s rise to power and their participation 
in politics are the vital signs of a healthy demo- 
cracy. If only this vision that emerged from the 
1995 Beijing Women’s Conference could spread 
worldwide! I would call it a radicalisation of 
democracy. When women take part in the public 
arena, contributing to the ongoing, shared effort 
to shape better ways of living together, a qualita- 
tive leap occurs. Their participation fills a gap 
which has until now prevented the emergence of 
a truly democratic culture. 
Archaic attitudes 
Equal sharing of decision-making by men and 
women is a pre-requiste for democracy. In Brazil, 
women hold half the civil service jobs (they are 
more qualified than men), but only 13 per cent of 
supervisory positions. The ultra-modern buil- 
dings in the federal capital, Brasilia, stand in 
sharp contrast with the persistence of intellectual 
and emotional outlooks which hark back to the 
19th century and hinder women’s empowerment. 
But attitudes are not the only obstacle to 
women’s ambitions. The structure of society and 
the way men and women run their daily lives are 
other stumbling blocks. 
The Inter-American Development Bank has 
had the good idea of giving the Institute for 
Cultural Action, an NGO in Rio de Janeiro, the 
task of setting up a pilot programme to train 
Brazilian women for positions of political and 
social power, an experiment which is to be exten- 
ded to the rest of Latin America. Participants 
include trade union and NGO leaders,key figures 
from the black and indigenous communities, 
company executives, civil servants and policyma- 
kers. 
These women of different ages, educational 
backgrounds and ethnic origins are all aware of 
one fact: they are paying a very high price for a 
social contract that was negotiated when women 
were in a position of weakness,and agree that this 
has to change. 
Re-mapping the division between 
public and private life 
Women account for 46 per cent of Brazil’s 
working population and hold 51 per cent of the 
university degrees, but still perform almost all 
tasks at home, in the private sphere. A study of 
300 women in positions of responsibility by the 
Centre for Women’s Leadership (CELIM) in Rio 
de Janeiro revealed the difficulty they had in 
making choices, their temptation to give up and 
the risk of pulling back in the face of increasing 
obstacles. Their difficulties show that there is an 
urgent need to re-organize the use of time,to stri- 
ke a new balance between responsibilities and to 
re-map the division between public and private 
life. Household tasks must be recognised as time- 
consuming, socially and economically vital and a 
serious check on women’s ambitions. 
Women in positions of power must constantly 
prove that they can behave like men. They keep

quiet about having to look after children, run a 
household and care for elderly parents. Bringing 
those issues out into the open would mean admit- 
ting “flaws” that men do not have, for the simple 
reason that they delegate such work to their 
wives. 
By drawing a veil of silence over their home 
life as if it were something illicit, women are allo- 
wing a basic fact to be hidden: the world of work 
relies on a domestic zone run by them. Women 
have changed, but the world of work has not and 
they are reaching the point of exhaustion. Filled 
with a deep sense of injustice, they are asking 
themselves: “Where did I go wrong?” 
Understanding that humanity is composed of 
two different but equal sexes has several implica- 
tions. Society must redefine itself because women 
are turning up in public carrying children in their 
arms and breast-feeding them, and because they 
have their own awareness and language that come 
from life experiences which are different from 
those of men. 
An untenable 
double burden 
Articulating issues affecting public and private 
life is complicated, but that does not mean the 
equation is impossible or that the problems they 
raise should be brushed aside—especially since 
the two worlds of public and private life are inter- 
twined and mutually supportive. The balance bet- 
ween the two has now been upset. Women have 
entered public life on a massive scale, but the 
organization of home life—how time is used and 
who is responsible for what tasks—is still the 
same, as if nothing had changed. And yet such a 
world, where women are expected to soldier 
on just as before, “simply” adding to their lives 
experiences hitherto reserved to men, is called 
egalitarian. 
That misunderstanding is fueled by an age-old 
tradition of dismissing the world of women, even 
by women themselves. Because society does not 
consider what they do in the home as having any 
major social significance, it fails to add this part 
of their lives to the other side of the equation. 
This is why the massive migration of women 
from the home to the public arena is occurring 
without societies having to think seriously about 
how and by whom domestic work will be done in 
the future (and which women still do, but at what 
cost!). The double burden, resulting from an out- 
dated social contract, is putting women under 
mounting pressure by speeding up their lives to 
an untenable pace. We are facing a social problem 
that society as a whole must solve and not, as 
many think, a problem that women must settle by 
working even harder. 
As new areas of power open up to women, 
both sexes must take a fresh look at how they use 
time. Re-arranging it is a challenge to society’s 
imagination. But has this necessity sunk into the 
minds of decision-makers? I do not think so. This

poses a major problem because it is a missing 
building block in the construction of our demo- 
cracies. 
The everyday work of CELIM is proof of this. 
Women must put these issues on the political and 
economic agenda, thereby contributing to a more 
radical definition of democracy. Feminism’s new 
demand for a different sharing of time also opens 
a debate that goes beyond the interests of women 
alone. In the final analysis, time and its 
constraints define the limits of our own lives and 
the range of choices we make, in accordance with 
the meaning we give to our own existence. 
The equality equation is increasingly complex. 
It is not enough to wipe out the last traces of dis- 
crimination in public life. A new definition of 
equality will emerge when both sexes start sharing 
responsibility in the private realm. Otherwise, the 
issue will be distorted and women will lose all 
chance of succeeding in public life. [

that’s a

Unfinished democracy 
The 1980s has seen 
a powerful 
counterassault on 
women’s rights, 
a backlash, 
an attempt to retract the 
handful of small and 
hard-won victories that 
the feminist movement 
did manage to win for 
women. This 
counterassault is largely 
insidious: (...) it stands 
the truth firmly on its 
head and proclaims that

elevated women’s 
position have actually 
led to their downfall.

countries like Kuwait, laws entitle women to 
vote and be elected. But in reality, the propor- 
tion of women in legislative bodies falls far short of 
representing their percentage in the general popula- 
tion. T he Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), a Geneva- 
based organization comprising 139 parliaments, says 
that men still account for 86 per cent of the world’s par- 
liamentarians and that no country—not even in nor- 
thern Europe—has achieved total parity. In the former 
communist countries, which once boasted some of the 
world’s highest rates of female representation in poli- 
tics, the percentages have fallen sharply since 1989. 
Likewise, the IPU says, “there has been no signi- 
ficant increase in the number of women heads of 
government and, above all, ministers throughout the 
world.” The average number of women heads of 
government is around 12 per cent. And, they seldom

of the world’s affairs? The controversy surroun- 
ding various measures intended to encourage 
them will continue for a long time to come. As the 
fierce debate over France’s recent parity law sho- 
wed, the two camps are divided into the advocates 
of practical efficiency and the defenders of a theo- 
retical universalism. 
“Some feminists view the demand for parity in 
decision-making forums as a step towards the 
rebuilding of a dividing wall between the sexes, a 
development conducive to hierarchy-building and 
discrimination,” says the IPU. “Others, on the 
contrary, view it as a means to eliminate barriers 
and as an alternative to strategies that have failed to 
work: entry into parties (in which women regularly 
fail),partial redistribution by means of quotas. . . or 
pious hopes for a change in mentalities.” 
In northern Europe, where the feminist move- 
H- can women—a “minority” that makes ment is very strong, parties set up quotas in the 
1970s and have been raising them periodically to 
the point of achieving near-parity. That policy is 
starting to spread to the rest of Europe, especial- 
ly left-wing parties. But in some countries, such 
as Portugal, bills in favour of such measures have 
recently failed to pass (February 2000). 
The situation in developing countries is more 
varied but seems to be changing. Many parties 
and governments—especially in Angola, Burkina 
Faso, Cape Verde, Chile, Guatemala, India, 
Namibia, the Philippines, South Africa and Sri 
Lanka—have taken steps in favour of quotas or 
announced their intention to do so. [|

A woman in the lion’s den

For years, Moroccan member of parliament Badia Skalli has put her long-standing loyalty 
to the Socialist Party before her feminist beliefs. Now she is at the centre of a tough battle 
  
D Freclance journalist based in 
Casablanca 
a time when the world made sense, and eve- 
rything was linked to some kind of cause. 
First came the struggle for independence, then the 
big push to build a new and freer country. Cold rea- 
lity eventually dashed these hopes, but from the 
outset,there had been that dream. 
Skalli was born in 1944 in El Jadida, about 100 
kilometers south of Casablanca.At 10 she had her 
first taste of political activism. A pro-independence 
demonstration passed her house, and suddenly she 
was marching in step with the protesters. This 
earned her a good hiding when she got home, but 
the seed had been sown. 
When Skalli enrolled at the University of Casa- 
blanca in 1962 to study law, the National Union of 
Moroccan Students (UNEM) was at its height and 
spearheading the left-wing opposition party, the 
National Union of Popular Forces (UNFP). 
“You just had to join in,” she remembers. “You 
just felt it so strongly. T he students were the elite.” 
Women students were few and far between, and only 
B: Skalli had the good fortune to be born at a handful were activists like her. T hey were fussed 
over by the men in the organization, who wanted to 
show they were modern-minded and strongly in 
favour of women’s emancipation. The UNEM exe- 
cutive committee welcomed Skalli and she took 
on her first political responsibilities. 
King Hassan II, who came to the throne in 
1961,so00n called a halt to these “antics.” In 1965, 
a high-school student rebellion grew into a popular 
uprising and a state of emergency was declared. The 
UNEM was decapitated when all its leaders were 
drafted into the army. Except for Skalli, that is, 
who greatly resented being treated differently 
because of her sex. “I had dreams about an army 
truck that would pick me up and take me away 
with my comrades.” 
Skalli acquired her yen for politics during these 
years of activism. But the state of emergency drove 
the UNFP, of which she was a member, under- 
ground. Morocco entered a period of political 
repression. Women party members busied them- 
selves with looking after political prisoners’ families. 
In Casablanca, thousands of Islamic conservatives took to the streets on March 12,2000 to protest a proposed reform 
of the family legal code, which governs the status of women.

EE
The young Skalli married, but her husband was 
killed in aroad accident three years later. It took her 
several years to recover. 
The call of politics was too compelling. When 
the UNFP split in 1975, she sided with the party’s 
“democratic” wing to help found the Socialist Union 
of Popular Forces (USFP), which meant giving up the 
temptingdream of revolution. The battle was now to 
be fought within the institutional bounds defined by 
the law. Skalli was one of the party’s few female can- 
didates in the 1976 local elections, the first to be 
held under the state of emergency. 
She campaigned in a poor, predominantly 
Berber-speaking area, where she found women cut 
off from the world because they were illiterate and 
did not understand Arabic. She had put her finger 
on the plight of Moroccan women. The young can- 
didate also found that voters had no preconceptions 
about women in politics and judged her by what she 
said. But the party asked her not to mention the fact 
that she was a widow—a woman without a hus- 
band—in her nomination papers. 
Skalli’s election bid failed, and she took it badly 
because the party had lost a seat. The issue of 
women’s participation in politics sparked little

public interest. But she was leader of the USFP’s 
women’s organization, founded in 1975 during 
International Women’s Year. Awareness was rising, 
but female party activists still put women’s issues on 
the back burner. 
“Next to the historic figures who had fought for 
independence or spent time in prison, we felt small 
and tended to fade into the background,” she says. 
Though a key figure in the USFP, it was a long time 
before Skalli gained enough self-confidence to assert 
her rightful place in the party. 
After another defeat at the polls, this time in a 
parliamentary election, she won a municipal council 
seat in 1983. Two women Socialist Party candi- 
dates were elected in the same town and the party 
planned to make Skalli the council president. The 
proposal triggered an uproar. Despite being socia- 
lists, some “comrades” were dead-set against the 
idea. “A people who entrust their business to a 
woman are heading for ruination,” the prophet 
Mohammed is supposed to have said. The party lea- 
dership backed down and the job went to a younger 
and less qualified man. Skalli had to settle for being 
the council vice-president. 
The practical experience of sharing power with 
men was highly instructive. “Everything happens 
behind the scenes, in the framework of a male com- 
plicity that shuts out women,” she says. Women’s 
issues rarely interest men, she notes, and because 
Women’s long march to power 
female politicians are so few, they are “like clay 
pots against iron ones.” 
Now that she had entered the fight for political 
power as an equal, Skalli saw repressed machismo 
coming to the surface again.The USFP’s decision 
to put her up as a parliamentary candidate sparked 
rebellion in the ranks and she encountered her first 
sexist attacks, such as “she smokes. . . she’s a widow.” 
But she was pleased to note once more how little her 
gender mattered to the voters. In fact,many people 
believed she was more trustworthy than men 
because of her sex. 
Skalli’s political career continued to prosper 
and she remained a staunch party stalwart. She 
campaigned for women’s rights, but “the party still 
came first.” Until the 1993 parliamentary elec- 
tions, the USFP wanted her to be its only female 
candidate. At that point, she protested and threa- 
tened to withdraw if other women were not allowed 
to stand.The party gave in. 
Two woman entered parliament that year, a 
milestone for Morocco—Skalli and Latifa Bennani 
Smires of the Istiglal (Nationalist) Party. Just two 
women among 300 men. After the 1997 elections, 
there were still only two. But the political scene 
changed. The left-wing opposition, kept out of 
power for nearly 40 years, took over the reins of 
government and USFP secretary-general Abder- 
rahmane Youssoufi became prime minister. In his 
inaugural speech, Youssoufi said he wanted to pro- 
mote women’s rights. The secretary of state for 
protection of the family and children got to work on 
the matter with the help of women’s NGOs. 
Bitter attacks over proposed code 
A year later, a draft programme to “make women 
part of the development process” was presented 
to the prime minister. It included a reform of the 
mudawana, the family legal code based on sharia 
(Islamic law), which governs the status of women. 
The planned reforms include abolishing polygamy, 
raising the marriage age for girls from 15 to 18 
and, in every case, replacing repudiation with court- 
approved divorce. “It was too good to be true,” 
says Skalli. “But we believed in it. We didn’t expect 
such a fuss.” 
The first attack on the project came from a 
member of the government itself, religious affairs 
minister Abdelkebir Alaoui M ’daghri. A broad range 
of conservatives led by Islamic fundamentalists 
took up the cry. They put on a show of force, bitterly 
attacking the reform’s supporters as bad Muslims 
and even atheists. Bogged down by internal divi- 
sions, the government is playing for time. The 
reform is a burning issue,and the government has 
no intention of getting burned. 
The government,says Skalli, bears an important 
responsibility and has clearly displayed a lack of cou- 
rage on the issue of women. She recognizes that 
much is at stake, for women in particular and 
Moroccan society in general, and finds the situation 
distressing. But what can you do when you are “a 
clay pot”? [|

during President Bill Clinton’s visit to India last 
March. In the rural heartland of Rajasthan, a 
dozen village women sat around on plush blue sofas, 
in resplendent dress, to discuss issues of democracy 
and power with the U.S.president. First they intro- 
duced themselves: all are elected representatives of their 
village councils (panchayats). Together they run a 
women’s dairy cooperative and have initiated several 
small credit and loan schemes for poor, landless 
women in their communities. They had discarded 
the age-old custom of hiding their veiled faces behind 
home walls. Now, they explained, they had to go to the 
bank to draw and desposit money, and to their district 
headquarters to attend monthly meetings. 
Even as they spoke in their native tongue, the 
women freely used English words such as ‘loan’, 
‘credit’, ‘Internet’, ‘public’ and ‘no confidence’. They 
complained about the lack of jobs for their educated 
sons, spoke about the need to open a school close by 
for their adolescent daughters, and their ongoing fight 
for drinking water, better roads, seeds and farming 
tools for their villages. 
N othing short of a small revolution occurred 
A lingering debate 
Some might like to dismiss this meeting as a clever 
act of ‘feel-good’ politics on the part of the President 
or as a showcased stunt on the part of the Indian 
government. But the meeting was really about women 
entering politics and staying on. Along with some 
million others across the country, these women are the 
daughters of the 73rd and 74th amendments of the 
Indian Constitution. Passed in 1993, these two amend- 
ments oblige all states to reserve one third of seats in 
the three-tiered system of local government (village, 
block and district levels)—known as panchayati raj— 
to women. Elected directly by and from among the vil- 
lagers, the panchayatscan make decisions concerning 
a wide range of fields, from agriculture to health, 
employment and primary education. 
In a short time, women have shown their potential 
to wield power effectively at the village level and chal- 
lenge feudal traditions. According to some observers, 
this is one of the reasons why the passage of the 
Women’s Reservations Bill, which seeks to reserve 
33 per cent of all seats in the national parliament and 
state assemblies to women, has been repeatedly 
blocked in the parliament. First put forward in 1996, 
the bill was reintroduced in 1998 but lapsed following 
the government’s fall the same year. It was resur- 
rected in December 1999 but has continued to create 
havoc in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the par- 
liament.T here are only 43 women MPs in the current 
Lok Sabha, out of a total figure of 543, and the majo- 
rity are from the elite. 
Opponents of the bill, which include the Rashtriya 
Janata Dal and the Samajwadi Party (both centre-left), 
along with some constituents of the ruling coalition, 
led by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party 
(BJP), claim that the bill should include a sub-quota 
for Other Backward Classes! and Muslim women. 
Otherwise they argue, the quotas will only promote the 
interests of the elite. The debate has been characterized 
by an ugly display of male muscle and lung power: in 
one instance, the Speaker had to adjourn the House, 
in another, opposing lawmakers grabbed the bill off his 
desk.Meanwhile,Congress (I) president Sonia Gandhi 
staged a walkout with her party members protesting 
against the delay in the bill’s passage. 
As the debate lingers, a number of organizations are 
intent on highlighting the success of women in the pan- 
chayats. T hey are also working hard to build up lea- 
dership among the most marginalized groups,namely 
Dalit and Tribal communities, and to give women a 
better understanding of their powers and rights at 
the local level. The Society for Participatory Research 
in Asia (PRIA) for example, helps to groom women 
candidates for elections through education and trai- 
ning and gives panchayat representatives the oppor-

tunity to meet with their counterparts from other 
states. At another level, these organizations are seeking 
to mobilise women to vote, and if need be, stand up 
against election malpractices, such as giving bribes or 
distributing liquor to win votes. 
A recent study prepared by the Multiple Action 
Research Group (MARG), a Delhi-based NGO, 
concluded that the constitutional amendments have 
indeed acted as a catalyst for greater participation by 
women in governance, but the legislation now needs 
to be fine-tuned: women should be given more than 
asingle term in a reserved constituency to make a real 
difference, and every effort should be made to provide

population. They belong to kinship groups that are entitled to 
certain benefits because they are considered disadvantaged, 
although less so than ‘scheduled castes’ (previously referred to 
as untouchables) and ‘scheduled tribes’.

them with literacy training. A separate study conducted 
in three states on the government’s behalf by the 
Centre for Women’s Development Studies also high- 
lighted the fact that the reservations had benefited 
women from the Other Backward Classes. 
Despite this, the barriers to participation remain 
sizeable. Rural areas are plagued by illiteracy and 
poverty, and patriarchy remains deeply entrenched. 
Practices such as wife beating and dowry deaths are still 
prevalent. Furthermore, as Ela Bhatt, the founder of the 
Self-Employed Women’s Association (SEWA) points 
out, rural women do not represent a unified group. 
Caste, clan and family considerations still overshadow 
political and gender-based priorities for large numbers 
of women in rural areas. As such she says, women 
panchayat members are easily manipulated, coerced and 
coopted by their male counterparts. Also, dress,elec- 
tion campaign meetings and strategies for women are 
still often decided by male members of the family. 
Reaching a critical mass 
Feminist economist Devki Jain feels that political 
empowerment through affirmative action is essen- 
tial for women to ‘break this hard-rock of patriarchy.’ 
There has been much debate in the country about 
whether illiterate rural women have the skills to stand 
for elections and take office. T he late Gita Mukherjee, 
a Communist Party of India member and six-time MP 
from West Bengal, who headed the special parlia- 
mentary committee on the Reservations Bill, repea- 
tedly asserted that the first step was to allow women 
to break into politics; their awareness would auto- 
matically rise. The panchayati raj institutions, she said, 
are to be valued as the real nurseries of political lea- 
dership for women. Poverty and violence, she stressed, 
can only be fought against effectively if women form 
a critical mass in all decision-making bodies, from vil- 
lage panchayats to the parliament. 
It may seem ironic that Madhu Kishwar, an activist 
and editor of the Delhi-based feminist journal M anushi, 
is one of the bill’s critics. She argues that party leaders 
will merely flood the reserved constituencies with the 
“Bibi (wife) Beti (daughter) brigade.” With the Forum 
for Democratic Reform, an umbrella organization of 
women’s groups, she has proposed an alternative bill 
that would make it legally binding for political parties 
to present women as one third of their total candidates 
and to give proportionate tickets to those from Dalit and 
Backward Classes. However, Mukherjee’s long time 
associate Bidya Munshi has criticized the proposal, clai- 
ming that women are likely to be relegated to seats 
where political parties are unlikely to win. 
Still, despite entrenched patriarchy, there are 
obvious signs of change, even if they seem anecdotal. 
The chief minister of Madhya Pradesh, Digvijay 
Singh, recently organized a meeting with women in 
Bhopal.Chairs were laid out for the ministers and high 
officials and mats on the floor for elected women 
representatives. As the meeting began, Remmebai, a 
tribal woman stood up and questioned the chief 
minister: “You keep talking about women’s equality

### 119996: South Korea's campaign school

South Korea’s 
campaign school 
  
D Glenn Manarin 
Prejudice and cronyism traditionally bar Korean women from politics but a non-profit training 
centre offers keys to success — from fashion tips to campaign strategies 
  
D Journalist based 
in South Korea 
3 4 The Unesco Courier - June 2000 
represents a rare coup in Korean society, a 
woman in a position of public power. In this tra- 
ditionally male-dominated nation, the 45-year-old 
local assemblywoman is one of the success stories 
of the non-profit Center for Korean Women and 
Politics (CKWP). 
Historically, the public visage of Korea has been a 
male one, while a woman ’s role has been confined lar- 
gely to the private world of the home, a fact rein- 
forced by the still strongly persistent values of Confu- 
cianism and a male-run corporate world. “Korea is not 
really feminized at all,” says Sohn Bong-Scuk, a poli- 
tical scientist and the founder of the CKWP. “The 
value system has prohibited women from getting 
involved in politics,” says Sohn, pointing to the fact that 
municipalities and the National Assembly have seen 
just a handful of female representatives. 
Sohn established the CKWP in 1990 to help 
bridge the gap between the ideal of equal representa- 
tion and reality. Funded largely by foundation grants, 
the center employs a staff of eight and operates on an 
annual budget of $180,000. For Sohn, there are three 
major obstacles to greater female representation:the 
powerful male-oriented political culture, a deep- 
rooted old-boys network and economics. 
“Korean political parties are very much private, 
person-centered parties with many medium-level 
bosses. If you want to be an important person in the 
party you must belong to someone else in the family 
n the industrial city of Ulsan, Lim Myung-sook tree,so it’s not easy for a woman to enter that kind 
of informal inner-circle,” says Sohn. 
Most women also don’t have the large sums of 
money needed to run for office. By law, national 
assembly candidates must have a minimum of 
$210,000 for their campaigns. However Sohn says 
some candidates will spend up to two million dollars. 
Backing with strings attached 
Furthermore,corporations have proved unwilling 
to back female candidates. “When business or indus- 
trial sectors support a candidate, there is a kind of 
string attached. In the case of a woman candidate, 
they don’t feel they’ll get anything back,” says Sohn. 
“As a minority in politics, women are very cautious 
and tend to be less involved in any dirty business. 
They are also usually first-year congresswomen so 
they are not in positions of power yet to help them.” 
Lim Myung-sook struggled to raise the $9,000 
minimum to run for office in her local assembly. But 
with the financial support of the CKWP and another 
local non-profit group, she managed to raise the mini- 
mum but far less than most candidates. However, 
more than money and the expected prejudices stood 
between her and office: Lim was sorely lacking in poli- 
tical experience. In 1994, she was working as an envi- 
ronmental campaign activist when friends suggested 
she run in the upcoming local assembly election. While 
preparing her bid, she received a call from Sohn who 
invited her to attend the center’s “Campaign School.”

Lim attended a three-day session with about 40 
other women, five of whom were also candidates 
in other local assembly races. At the theoretical 
level, the women learned to see female political par- 
ticipation as a means to the ultimate goals of equa- 
lity and true democratic representation. At the prac- 
tical level, they focused on speech-making skills, 
political and campaign strategy as well as making 
voter contact. In Korean election campaigns, image 
is all-important. So the women were advised on 
fashion and hair styles, while those who used regio- 
nal dialects were coached in standard Korean. 
Finally, participants were assigned roles as candi- 
dates, electoral officers and campaign managers 
and a model election was held. 
Different policy 
preferences 
Lim was among three women from her session 
who went on to electoral success. In 1995, she 
became the first woman to be elected to the Ulsan 
Local Assembly, and she was re-elected in 1998. 
Since then, another two women have attained office 
in Ulsan. 
Last April, CKWP also had reason to celebrate. A 
candidate who they had trained in Seoul and also 
sent abroad to Germany and the United States for fur- 
ther preparation was elected to the national assembly. 
In most cases though, the center focuses on the grass- 
roots,urging housewives to run for local rather than 
national office, whose candidates tend to already be 
savvy politicians. 
In addition to the campaign school, the center 
holds annual training sessions for women interested 
in political issues. For three days, university students, 
Women’s long march to power 
housewives and established businesswomen gather 
to discuss a chosen theme, such as sexual harassment 
or affirmative action. After seminars and discussion on 
the topic, they are assigned roles, such as minister of 
labour or minister of foreign affairs, and they are 
divided into two camps: pro-feminist and anti-femi- 
nist. They then hold a mock congress to hone their 
debating skills and get a taste for politics. “I like to give 
them motivation from a young age to be a leader in the 
future,” says Sohn. 
Another major activity is research on political 
gender issues like female voting and governing pat- 
terns. Perhaps most importantly, the CKWP has 
found that “women have different policy preferences 
than men,” says Sohn. “They are more concerned 
about minorities, the marginal, the aged and children.” 
For example, in the blue-collar city of Ulsan, assem- 
blywoman Lim has concentrated on factory pollution 
and recycling, social welfare issues, the rights and 
needs of the disabled, and women’s rights. 
Despite the progress, Korea is still far from the day 
when politicians like Lim will comprise a healthy chunk 
of the political base. In the previous national assem- 
bly there were 11 women among 299 representatives. 
Recent elections in April placed a record 16 women 
into office (11 of whom were elected through affir- 
mative action legislation implemented in 1995 after 
extensive lobbying by CKWP and other groups).Pro- 
gress indeed, but in its 273-seat national assembly, 
Korean society is still represented overwhelmingly by 
men. Sohn says the slow rate of change has been dis- 
couraging but feels the CK WP has contributed to an 
important shift in thinking. “The political conscious- 
ness has been raised,” says Sohn. “Now even men can 
accept the words, women and politics.” [|

> they don’t have as easy access to it as men do. I 
wouldn’t mind running for the Senate but I cer- 
tainly would not want to have to raise the money. 
In addition to the issue of money, women also 
have the main responsibility for [raising their] kids. 
That takes some years off most women’s career life. 
How has your work facilitated women’s entry into 
politics? 
The things I wrote helped women break 
through certain barriers in their own psyche—the 
way they looked upon themselves and their possi- 
bilities. The feminine mystique, that miasma of 
influences, would keep women modest, shy, silent 
and invisible. I told them to shout—don’t whis- 
per. I organized women to break through the 
feminine mystique, to run for office, to get wea- 
pons against sex discrimination enforced. 
You've worked hard for equal rights and affirmative 
action. How effective do you think they’ve been 
and how could they be strengthened? 
Women today in the U.S. are getting the same 
number of professional degrees as men. The dis- 
crepancy lies in the childbearing years and 
women never catch up. We are the only industria- 
lized nation without a national programme of 
childcare. It’s outrageous. 
Turning to equal pay for equal work, the prin- 
ciple is right but there are a lot of ways of sidelining 
it. Too many women are segregated in jobs that may 
be even more valuable than jobs men do, but 
because women do them they are paid less. So we 
began to say equal pay for work of equal value. Why 
should janitors get more than a schoolteacher? Or 
where would doctors be without nurses? 
Do you think women’s issues like economic equality 
and reproductive rights are considered marginal 
and difficult to construct a campaign on? 
These issues affect 52 per cent of the popula- 
tion. Women in this country have far more power 
than they are using. T hey vote in higher proportion 
than men do. The real question is why aren’t we 
using our power to make the issues that are impor- 
tant to us a higher priority and get more women 
elected to office. These issues are not as marginal 
as they might once have been considered. I doubt 
anybody running for office in any metropolitan 
area would dare to have as their slogan, “Women 
Go Back Home.” Although you never know what 
would happen if there were an economic down- 
turn. 
What more could the women’s movement do to 
support female candidates? 
It will be interesting to see what happens with 
Hillary (Rodham Clinton) in New York. Will there 
be a big upsurge of support for her from women 
crossing party lines? One thing didn’t really please 
me: when Hillary became visibly vulnerable to her 
Monica [Lewinsky] problems, her ratings went 
up. It was as if women couldn’t identify with her 
aN Ti 
sd 88 The Unesco Courier - June 2000 
superiority. They were more able to identify with 
her when it became clear that everything wasn’t 
easy than when she was so in control. I want to see 
women really identifying with their own empower- 
ment and getting out of the ‘victim’ state. 
What are some strategies that would facilitate 
women’s entry into politics? 
There are more and more women mayors— 
women who are going through the ranks on their 
way up. It used to be the only women you saw in 
Congress were widows sitting in their husbands’ 
seats. That’s not the way it is anymore. Maybe for 
me or for you the progress isn’t fast enough but 
it’s fair and it will get better as more women study 
political science and head student governments in 
colleges and go to law schools. Up to now, law has 
been the way into politics. More than 40 per cent 
of law students are women. So in another genera- 
tion, the talent pool will be nearly equal. 
  
Any parting thoughts you’d like to share with 
readers? 
Women are not defined any longer as mothers 
or housewives. To the degree I’ve had a hand in 
making that happen, I feel very pleased and very 
proud. I'm impatient for the next step. Now 
women make up only 12 per cent of government. 
What would it be like if they were 50 per cent? | 
think politics would be different. Some research 
done a few years ago found that by adding two 
women to a state legislature the agenda changes. 
And not just in the direction of women’s rights, 
but in all directions having to do with life—chil- 
dren, sickness, old people, health,quality of life— 
and not just highways. [| 
Networking on the Web 
A number of organizations in the U.S are gearing up for the 2000 election. Many have 
experience in supporting women candidates and training campaign staff, others are focu- 
sing on informing women and encouraging them to vote. Here are some of the players. 
Emily’s List (www.emilystist.org) is a major source of early funding for pro-choice, 
Democratic women. 
The Women’s Campaign Fund (www.wcfonline.org),the National Women’sPolitical 
Caucus {www.nwpc.org) and the National Organization for Women (www.now.org) all 
provide support to pro-choice, feminist candidates. 
The Wish List (www .thewishlist.org) supports pro-choice Republican women candidates. 
Village.com, ore of the largest internet sites geared to women, offers on-line registra- 
tion,interviews with candidates and chat rooms to exchange information with them. 
The White House Project (www.thewhitehouseproject.org) is working ta change the 
political climate so that women can be elected to the presidency and other key positions. 
League of Women Voters (www.leagueofwomenvoters.org) runs voter registration 
campaigns to encourage women to vote. 
Lifetime Television (www lifetimetv.com}, has formed a partnership with the National 
Council of Women’s Organizations, (made up of 110 national women’s groups), for a biparti- 
san campaign to educate women about issues that affect them and to underscore the impor- 
tance of their vote. n

### 120000: Gypsies: trapped on the fringes of Europe

D Alain Reyniers 
TRAPPED ON 
THE FRINGES OF EUROPE 
Across Europe, Gypsies live in dire poverty and are frequently the target of violence 
and racism. But some governments are finally taking notice of the continent’s largest minority 
and 80 per cent of Hungary’s working- 
age Roma are estimated to be unem- 
ployed. More than 60 per cent of Romania’s 
Gypsies are said to live below the poverty 
line and 80 per cent have no formal quali- 
fications. In Bulgaria, the same percentage 
of Gypsies living in cities are jobless. The 
figures are believed to be much higher in 
the countryside. 
In some villages of southern and eas- 
tern Slovakia, all Roma of adult age are 
destitute. In Britain, an estimated 10 to 
20 per cent of the “travellers,” as they are 
called, live in absolute poverty. In some 
French cities, between 70 and 80 per cent 
of the Gypsy population are on welfare 
payments paid out to the most destitute. 
Their housing conditions are appal- 
ling, while their bill of health is another 
cause for concern: most Roma have a life 
expectancy of under 50. 
The figures are shocking. Between 60 
Valued skills and masters 
of their own time 
A glaring gap separates Europe’s 
peoples from the continent’s largest 
minority. Why, despite repeated attempts 
to assimilate or exclude the Gypsies over 
the past 600 years, have they remained 
cut off from other peoples and for the 
most part, pushed to the fringes of socie- 
ty? After all, not every group of people 
who came to live in Europe has been sys- 
tematically ostracised. The Hungarians 
were a nomadic people of Asian origin 
but they managed to become a nation. 
And there are others. 
Probably not all the Roma—who first 
came from India—were nomads when 
they arrived in the Byzantine Empire in 
the 12th or 13th century. But as far as we 
can tell from various writings, they had 
talents that enabled them to participate in 
the economies of the regions they cros- 
sed. They had no ambitions to conquer, 
J Ethnologist, lecturer at the Catholic University of 
Louvain and editor of the magazine Etudes Tsiganes 
3 8 The Unesco Courier - dune 2000 
but wherever they went, presented them - 
selves as craftspeople, artists and traders. 
They were independent workers,commit- 
ted to being masters of their own time, 
intent on making an earning from odd, 
on-the-spot jobs and with enough skills to 
meet the requests and needs of a disper- 
sed clientele. 
Many Europeans no doubt frowned 
upon the Gypsies’ working habits: how 
they sought out jobs each day, their trust 
in luck, their spontaneous way of approa- 
ching strangers and their persistence. It 
set them apart from farming communities 
who worked for the long term, in tune 
with the changing seasons. Despite this 
and the inevitable friction between people 
from different backgrounds, nomads and 
farmers needed each other. The nomads 
provided 
tools, baskets, veterinary care, music or 
temporary manpower to the farmers, who 
gave them food and other goods in 
exchange. 
For a long time, the Roma managed 
to make a living in this way, mainly as iti- 
nerants but also by staying in one place 
when there were opportunities. There 
were plenty of such cases in the Ottoman 
Empire and in central Europe, where the 
Roma served in the armies of invaders. 
They were also active in the Iberian 
peninsula, where they took over from the 
Moors and Jews expelled towards the end 
of the 15th century, at the time of the 
Reconquista, until they too were forced 
out. 
These few examples go to show that 
Gypsies were not excluded because of a 
deep-rooted failure to adjust to local 
economic conditions, as it iS too often 
suggested. Rather, it seems clear that 
governments and officials—first in wes- 
tern Europe,especially Spain, and then in 
central and eastern Europe—have, over 
the centuries, gone to great lengths to 
portray the Roma as a foreign and anti- 
social people without a culture of their 
own.

### 120000: Gypsies: trapped on the fringes of Europe

The contrived image of the Gypsies as 
an idle, roaming and dangerous people 
was one of the devices—along with vio- 
lence, coercion and ideology—that was 
used to help forge the national identity of 
peoples belonging to specific territories 
with well-guarded borders. In the 19th 
century, when these peoples rose up 
against foreign rulers, the nationalist 
struggle was always on behalf of a single 
majority people, whose sturdy peasant 
values were often played up, to the detri- 
ment of all other elements in society, 
including the Roma.

cannot be underestimated. The nomads 
of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, for 
example, settled in the 18th century as 
“new peasants,” but were not given any 
land. It contributed to a culture of mis- 
trust and resistance towards gadjes (non- 
Gypsies). 
Even though the Gypsies had been the 
long-time economic and cultural partners 
of European peoples, they were always 
kept out of political decision-making, 
though it can be questioned whether they 
were interested in becoming involved at 
this level. At best they were regarded as

with their environment serving as the 
starting point for learning. 
The tendency to exclude Gypsies 
grew steadily throughout the 20th centu- 
ry. Police in western Europe cracked 
down on them with increasing harshness. 
These days, Gypsies are confined to a 
limited number of parking plots and cam- 
ping grounds that are often ill-equipped 
for the needs of travelling families. 
The growth of market forces and 
changes in consumer tastes, along with 
newer, more sophisticated production 
methods, have helped to drive some 
Gypsy communities deeper into poverty. 
Their trading practices are restricted by 
laws against selling door-to-door, against 
street activities and against recuperating 
objects from dumps. Such legislation 
takes absolutely no account of their skills, 
nor of the stakes at hand for Roma in this 
domain. If they had no access to social 
assistance or credit (although the public 
image of Roma is hardly conducive to res- 
pect), many would find themselves in des- 
perate situations.

A ROMA GHETTO IN FLORENCE 
D Nicola Solimano and Tiziana Mori 
[ores a cosmopolitan city where the world’s 
greatest art and architecture attest to a blen- 
ding of cultures, has for ten years been debating 
the fate of some 200 Roma families—approximately 
1,000 people—iving within its boundaries. Like 
other major Italian cities where Roma have spon- 
taneously settled, Tuscany’s capital has opted for 
the solution of “nomad campgrounds”: in essence, 
reserves where newcomers are herded together. 
Most of the Roma in Florence are from Mace- 
donia and Kosovo. They came during the past fif- 
teen years, driven from their homesby the econo- 
mic crisis and wars that have racked the region, 
where they had almost completely given up their 
wandering ways and settled down in certain neigh- 
bourhoods of large cities. 
At first, the Roma of Florence and the surroun- 
ding area constantly moved around in small family 
groups, driven from one place to the next by pro- 
testing neighbours or by real estate projects laun- 
ched in new, expanding suburbs. In the early 90s, 
the municipality decided to concentrate them in 
two “nomad campgrounds”. One ison the site ofa 
former rubbish dump located in a flood-prone area 
near the river Arno. The other isa strip of land wed- 
ged between the railroad tracks and the highway. 
These unusable spaces were of interest to no one. 
In Florence and elsewhere, the areas chosen for 
“nomad campgrounds’ revealed a widespread atti- 
tude: Gypsies must be kept apart from the general 
population, and the general population would do 
best to keep their distance from them. 
The city’s government considered these camp- 
grounds a temporary solution. In fact, they were the 
first in a series of other “temporary solutions’ and 
have never been called into question. All the classic 
earmarks of ghetto pathology have appeared there; 
the risk of fire is especially high. On several occa- 
D Members of the Michelucci Foundation, Florence   
sions, children have died in blazes when their 
parents were unable to rescue them. Sanitary faci- 
lities are collective. Each is used by several families, 
with obvious consequences on health, mainte- 
nance costs and relations between families. 
The deterioration of facilities, living conditions 
and social relations was inevitable. Scourges such 
as drug abuse, partly due to contact with disad- 
vantaged members of the local community, have 
led to increased control by the authorities. The 
campgrounds are closed spaces; their entrances 
are under surveillance; the comings and goings of 
Roma and non-Roma alike are recorded. All the 
features making up a ghetto are in place. 
In the past few years, Roma organizations and 
volunteers supported by a few rare but well-known 
intellectuals, such as the writer Antonio Tabucchi, 
have pressured the municipality into finding alter- 
native solutions. Under a regional law based on a 
Michelucci Foundation project, the authorities have 
built a small sub-division of six housing units assi- 
gned to Roma from Macedonia. The project was 
so successful that some 30 other families have 
been re-accommodated in city-owned units. These 
experiments show that, when they are taken out of 
the degrading living conditions and exclusion in 
which they had been living for years, Roma families 
seize the opportunity to integrate themselves 
socially and economically. 
However, the building of the sub-division met 
with fierce criticism in Florence, exploited by right- 
wing parties, which dissuaded the municipality from 
undertaking similar projects. Not enough families 
have been relocated to permanently close the 
“nomad campgrounds’, where Roma refugeesfleeing 
the war in Kosovo have arrived in the meantime. 
Florence continues presenting the face of a city 
of art and culture to the world, while at the same 
time it is incapable of striking a dialogue with a 
small minority from a different background. WH

geois” world that would eventually disap- 
pear. The Gypsies were shipped en masse 
to work in menial jobs on collective farms 
and in state enterprises. The lack of poli- 
tical attention to the Roma’s culture— 
their ancestral language, their education 
geared to sharing and their economic 
flexibility stressing income from odd 
jobs—and the crying indifference to the 
xenophobia that developed towards them, 
did not facilitate the assimilation of young 
Gypsies into the socialist societies. 
The collapse of communism in eas- 
tern Europe brought great suffering and 
violence to the Roma, whose neighbou- 
rhoods have been repeatedly attacked by 
skinheads and others. In Bosnia and more 
recently in Kosovo, Gypsy communities 
were even destroyed. Unemployment 
among them has further increased. 
In a sense, this new marginalisation, 
which has produced emigration move- 
ments towards a utopian El Dorado 
(namely western Europe), is simply ano- 
ther consequence of the political and 
nationalist attitudes that have harmed the 
Gypsies time and time again in the past. 
Gypsies often have little lifeline outside 
their communities, which are refused any 
territorial rights by the host societies. 
They are often prevented from settling in 
a region that seems more hospitable 
because they are ill-equipped to cope with 
the demands of today’s economy and lack 
a decent level of education. 
Recognizing 
national minorities 
The Roma have nonetheless made a 
few significant strides in recent years. 
Several international bodies and many 
NGOs have taken up their cause and have 
pushed programmes to foster their inte- 
gration—both economically and socially. 
Governments are finally recognizing them 
as national minorities or are taking mea- 
sures to encourage their development in 
the longer term. 
Not all Roma have had their spirit 
broken by centuries of being shunned. 
Some have adapted, occasionally by assi- 
milating but more often by highlighting 
their traditional know-how and showing a 
willingness to become involved in the host 
society. 
The future of the Roma probably does 
not depend on a single solution. Given 
the problems and obstacles they face, it is 
more than ever linked to a collective 
determination to build a humane and 
democratic society where individuals and 
groups can blossom and flourish. |

### 120004: Diving for dollars

DIVING 
FOR DOLLARS 
  
D Vincent Noce 
New technology means shipwrecks swallowed up by the deepest waters can now be reached. 
But who owns the precious finds? Some countries allow a free-for-all of plundering 
under the sea. Over the centuries 
hundreds, perhaps thousands of 
ships—nobody has even a remote idea 
how many—have sunk in storms or the 
heat of battle, bringing Roman amphorae, 
gold bars, cannons and crates of Chinese 
porcelain with them. 
Maritime trade began booming in the 
sixteenth century: the ships of the Dutch 
East India Company made 8,000 round- 
trip voyages to China in a 200-year period. 
But until the mid-twentieth century, there 
was no way reach this underwater museum, 
and the world’s oceans were like a gigantic 
safe containing civilisation’s treasures. 
The world’s biggest museum lies 
D wurnalist with the French daily newspaper Libération 
Two of the oldest ships found recently 
came to a grim end just over 2,700 years 
ago, when they were probably on their way 
from Tyre to the Pharaohs’ Egypt laden 
with wine-filled amphorae. American 
underwater archaeologists Robert Ballard, 
who discovered the wreck of the Titanic, 
and Lawrence Stager, of Harvard 
University, found the two Phoenician ves- 
sels, each less than 20 metres long, off the 
Israeli coast in June 1999. 
They had been asked to locate an 
Israeli submarine, the Dakar, which sank 
in 1969, taking its 69 crew members 
down with it. Two small underwater 
robots, Jason and Medea, descended to 
300 and 900 metres to film and inspect 
the Phoenician vessels, which led to the 
discovery that they were still in an excel- 
lent state of preservation. 
The deeper the water the less oxygen, 
so wrecks there are much better preserved 
than those closer to the surface, according 
to Ballard. “The great depths, the absen- 
ce of sunlight and the great pressures 
seem to preserve history far more than we 
thought,” he says. A 3,300-year-old ship 
was found off Turkey in more shallow 
waters, and two more Phoenician vessels, 
dating from the seventh century BC, were 
located near Murcia, Spain, but all were 
in much worse condition. 
The discovery of the two wrecks off 
the coast of southern Israel came as a sur- 
prise because historians were unaware 
that the Phoenicians conducted trade »

along that route. A wine decanter (sho- 
wing that wine was decanted in those 
days), stone anchors, food crockery and a 
censer were found among Tyrrhenian 
amphorae typical of the period, which 
allowed researchers to roughly determine 
the date the ships went down as well as 
where they sailed from. 
“More important discoveries should 
come in the near future that could signifi- 
cantly alter our understanding of ancient 
maritime trade,” predicts Ballard. The 
discovery off Sicily of Roman ships dating 
from between 100 BC and 400 AD has 
already confirmed a long-disputed theory 
according to which the Romans were 
quite capable of sailing in deep water a 
long way from the coast. 
A question 
of ownership 
Yet until only half a century ago, when 
the autonomous deep-sea diving suit was 
invented, it was still impossible to go 
anywhere near deep-sea wrecks. In 1952 
Jacques Cousteau led the first underwater 
archaeological expedition off Marseilles, 
which was a very busy Mediterranean 
port in Roman times. His team brought 
up Greek and Roman amphorae, which 
puzzled specialists at first because they 
were at least a century apart in age. Then 
4 2 The Unesco Courier - June 2000 
the divers realized they had been excava- 
ting two wrecks that had sunk one on top 
of the other. 
At that time, no laws or official bodies 
regulated underwater archaeological 
exploration in France or anywhere else.In 
1966 President Charles de Gaulle’s 
minister of culture, André Malraux, set 
up an underwater archaeological explora- 
tion division and made it compulsory to 
declare finds in French territorial waters. 
In 1989, two years after a similar law 
had been passed in the United States, 
France adopted legislation that gave 
the state sole ownership rights to all sun- 
ken treasures found in its territorial 
waters. Until then, it had been possible to 
share them. As a result, the number of 
declarations plummeted from about 250 
a year to under 50. Seven years later, the 
government tried to counter the 
drop by announcing rewards of up to 
200,000 French francs (approximately 
$30,000) for discovering such treasures, 
depending on its scientific value. But 
those rewards are rarely paid: explorers 
risk breaking the law since a single 
amphora can fetch up to 10,000 French 
francs ($1,500) on the market. 
Unaware amateur divers think 
amphorae do not “talk.” That is a big mis- 
take, because they do. They can tell us 
when the wreck occurred, the nationality 
of the crew and how the cargo was ship- 
ped. And the discovery of amphorae is 
what usually indicates that an ancient 
wreck is nearby, concealed in the sand. 
For the 14 centuries between 700 BC 
and 700 AD, these large jars were used to 
transport wine, oil, pickled products, 
spices, tea and other goods. After that, 
hundreds of years went by before vessels 
once again began carrying items—can- 
nons and porcelain this time—that future 
archaeologists and treasure-hunters could 
use as clues to detect the locations of 
shipwrecks. The years in between are a 
blank, either because wrecks disintegrated 
or remain invisible, or because maritime 
trade collapsed. 
Site leasing 
to private investors 
For example, a barnacle-encrusted 
cannon tipped archaeologists off to the 
presence of a wrecked French fleet off 
Venezuela’s Las Aves islands. King 
Louis XIV had dispatched the warships to 
drive the Dutch out of the Caribbean. 
Commanded by Count Jean d’Estrées, 
the French looted Tobago before heading 
to Curacao, where they would have defea- 
ted the Dutch had not half the 13 war- 
ships and 17 privateers sunk in a storm on 
May 11, 1678. Five hundred of the 5,000 
crewmen were drowned and 1,000 died 
of starvation or disease after being stran- 
ded on desert islands. The disaster put an 
end to France’s dream of ruling unchal- 
lenged in the Caribbean, which quickly 
became a haven for pirates. 
Though they no longer fly the skull 
and crossbones, pirates are still there 
today. About 15 years ago, a Venezuelan, 
Charles Brewer-Carias, and an American, 
Barry Clifford, one of the world’s best- 
known shipwreck hunters, found the 
French flagship Le Terrible, which had 70 
cannon and a crew of 500, amid other 
wrecks at the site. 
Clifford says he was shocked by the 
lease of the site to a private investor. “The 
Venezuelan people will someday look 
back in horror at what is being permitted 
to happen to Las Aves,” he says. 
Venezuela, which does not have a public 
archaeological body that could explore 
the site,gave a construction company cal- 
led Mespa exclusive permission to exca- 
vate and sell whatever they could find. 
“We had an archaeologist on board the 
research vessel,” says the firm, which 
admits it wants to make a profit by setting 
up a discovery “industry”. 
“In every single case where countries

have issued permits for treasure hunting, 
they have always ended up the losers,” 
says Florida archaeologist John de Bry. 
“Piracy is alive and well.” Mespa thinks it 
can find Count d’Estrées’ and his officers’ 
personal valuables, but archaeologists 
doubt a war fleet would have been car- 
rying much “treasure.” However, they 
fear the historical and archaeological 
value of items will be lost, as well as the 
wreck’s position. 
The wrecks also cast light on how 
ships were designed and built in the days 
French minister Colbert was creating a 
royal navy and an entire industry around 
it. Recording the exact position of the 
various items on the sea’s floor before 
bringing them up to the surface is an 
extremely delicate, costly and time- 
consuming task. All underwater explora- 
tion is very expensive and comes without 
any guarantee of success. 
Since profit is the treasure-hunters’ 
only motive, and every day of exploration 
costs a small fortune, they are in a hurry 
to bring up whatever can be sold, even if 
it means destroying everything in their 
way. Some even use explosives to reach 
what they want. 
because it was a necessary stopover for 
ships crossing the Atlantic. Portugal’s 
museum of archaeology has listed 850 
sunken Spanish and Portuguese ships 
there, many loaded with gold. 
Eighty-eight of them lie in the Bay of 
Hangra de Heroismo, where the British 
treasure-hunter John Grittan showed up 
in 1972, eventually spending two months 
in jail and being banned from exploring. 
Nearly a quarter of a century later he 
returned—after the law changed to allow 
private firms to explore—as manager of 
Arqueonauticas, chaired by Rear Admiral 
Isaias Gomes Texeira, one of the first 
companies to obtain an exploration and 
excavation permit. 
One of the most famous treasure-hun- 
ters, Florida-based Bob Marx, joined the 
undertaking, lured by a deal giving him 
half of whatever was discovered at a depth 
of up to 50 metres and 70 per cent of 
what was found further down. “This law 
has sacrificed our history to money,” says 
Francisco Alves of the national archaeolo- 
gy museum. Meanwhile, the Spanish are 
frantically poring over legal documents to 
see if they have a right to save galleons 
that are their own heritage. 
   SIGNS OF THE TIMES 
Sometimes treasure-hunters hit the 
jackpot. One of them, the impetuous 
Michael Hatcher, netted about $15 mil- 
lion from the piecemeal sale of Chinese 
porcelain he found in the wreck of the 
Dutch ship Geldermalsen, which sank in 
the China Sea in 1752. Christie’s, the 
world’s biggest auction house, sold the 
pieces off for a while but then quietly 
stopped, probably because of the contro- 
versy and legal problems raised. 
Hatcher claims he found the wreck in 
international waters, but researchers say it 
was lying within Indonesia’s territorial limits. 
Jakarta opened an investigation, and one of 
the investigators drowned in a diving acci- 
dent at the site, adding to the detective novel 
aspect of the case. Eventually the Indone- 
sians dropped the enquiry, but rumours tied 
that move to the corruption of the Suharto 
family then ruling the country. 
“All this money going around just 
makes matters worse because it is recy- 
cled to pay for new explorations,” says 
Lyndel Prott,a legal expert on world heri- 
tage matters with UNEsco. “Countries 
allow the kind of pillage of their underwa- 
ter treasures that they would never tolera- 
te on land.” [| 
Since profit is the treasure- 
hunters’ only motive, 
and every day of exploration 
costs a small fortune, they are 
in a hurry to bring up 
whatever can be sold, even 
if it means destroying 
everything in their way. 
 
They have no interest in items that 
cannot be sold but which may be of ines- 
timable value to historians, such as a pot- 
tery shard bearing an inscription that may 
provide clues about a ship’s route, a piece 
of shoe that can tell much about how the 
sailors dressed or a skeleton showing 
wounds or nutritional deficiencies. The 
hull of the Maurithuis, which sank off 
Guinea on its way back from China in 
1609, was still lined with nearly 20,000 
plates of almost pure zinc, showing that 
Chinese metallurgists were very far ahead 
of their European counterparts. 
The problem of granting exploration 
permits is much greater in Portugal’s 
Azores island chain, which has one of the 
world’s biggest concentrations of wrecks 
FINDERS KEEPERS 
AND MILITARY EXCEPTIONS 
atrick O'Keefe, an Australian lawyer and cul- 
P tural heritage specialist, says the discovery of 
the Titanicwas a turning point. Exploration teams 
now have the technology to go anywhere and to 
excavate at once-unthinkable depths. “Interna- 
tional regulations are urgently needed because no 
wreck is safe anymore,” he says. 
But the international community is lagging far 
behind the technology. Some countries have more or 
less successfully established rules on underwater 
archaeology within their territorial waters (usually 12 
miles, or 22 km., from their coasts). However, few are 
developing the resources to carry out their own 
undersea explorations. In international waters, any- 
thing goes. Individuals are entitled to keep what they 
find, and every ship that is “saved” belongs to who- 
mever discovered it, in keeping with the maritime tra- 
dition of “salvage on the high seas.” 
But UNEsco’s Lyndel Prott says, “the wrecks 
aren’t saved when they're found by a treasure- 
hunter. On the contrary, they're the ones who 
endanger them.” The 1982 Convention on the 
Law of the Sea barely touched on the issue of 
underwater treasure.   
UNESco has drawn up a planned convention 
that would ban all commercial use of underwater 
wrecks. Unfortunately, the world’s major mariti- 
me and technological powers—the United States, 
Britain, France and Japan—want to keep their 
hands free and look askance at any attempt to 
take away their freedom of action. 
Their navies cite the tradition that warships 
forever belong to the country that launched them 
to keep others from touching their wrecks, even 
when they are four centuries old. The United 
States used this argument to win its right to the 
wreck of the Alabama, a Confederate privateer 
sunk by the Union navy off the French port of 
Cherbourg towards the end of the American Civil 
War. And what about a Spanish galleon wrecked 
in the Portuguese Azores? When is a wreck dee- 
med to have been abandoned by its country or 
its owner? 
Two meetings of specialists—a third has been 
set for July 2000—have so far failed to sort out the 
mess, or to obtain a firm political commitment 
from the international community to lay down 
the law in Davy Jones's locker. [|

### 120005: Internet to the rescue of democracy?

INTERNET 
TO THE RESCUE 
OF DEMOCRACY? 
  
D René Lefort 
Advocates of e-democracy profess that the Internet is the only way to bridge the gap 
between disaffected citizens and politicians. “Nonsense” say others 
Richard Askwith, a senior editorial 
writer for the British newspaper The 
Independent on Sunday described his fee- 
lings in a recent article. “Everything our 
government does it does in my name, yet 
what say have I ever had? One vote in five 
years, for a choice of scarcely distingui- 
shable bands of disingenuous careerists. 
What kind of choice is that?” 
Askwith is implacable:“Parliamentary 
democracy, invented in the days of the 
horse and cart and perfected during the 
steam age,” has had its day. “It’s time 
governments found a new way to let the 
people decide.”! 
The solution? The Internet. 
“E-democracy will wake politics up,” says 
French MP André Santini, mayor of the Paris 
suburb of Issy-les-M oulineaux, which he has 
made into a model Internet-connected town. 
“I'm sure it can cure people’s disaffection 
with politics, just as the Internet economy is 
beating unemployment.”?2 
A “dumb rage of impotence” is how 
The Arizona 
experiment 
The clearest sign of this political apa- 
thy is low voter turnout, to the point that 
“these days universal suffrage is now only 
universal in name,” says Santini. The first 
Internet voting experiment was the 
Democratic Party primary election in the 
U.S. state of Arizona that took place from 
March 7 to 11, 2000. Opponents of e- 
voting went to court, arguing that it dis- 
criminated against poor people without 
Internet access (the “digital divide”).

The court threw out the case. Yet the 
system’s technical shortcomings, inclu- 
ding the inability to prove a voter’s identi 
ty and to ensure the secrecy of the ballot, 
were deemed unimportant. Nearly 
86,000 Democrats cast ballots, 40,000 of 
them through the Internet. Three-quar- 
ters of the e-voters were between 18 and 
35, an age group that is usually less inter - 
ested in voting than their elders. Only 
slightly over 12,000 people bothered to 
turn out for the previous such primary 
four years earlier. 
Was the experiment conclusive? A 
local paper, the Tucson Citizen, said many 
voters were drawn more by the method’s

opportunity for our exhausted

novelty than by the candidates. More 
generally, Stephen Hess, of the Brookings 
Institute, thinks that “procedural ques- 
tions are not what prevents people from 
voting.” But Santini believes that e-voting 
1s “an amazing opportunity for our 
exhausted democratic system.” 
The American firm Election.com has 
announced it will provide such voting ser- 
vices for next November’s U.S. presiden- 
tial election. And Steve Case, of the huge 
Internet service provider (ISP) America 
Online (AOL), thinks experiments like 
the one in Arizona are further proof that 
the Internet is “transforming the way 
people interact with their local and natio- 
nal governments.” 
Political parties, new citizens’ move- 
ments and public authorities are increa- 
singly quick to grasp that fact, at least in 
countries wealthy enough to have 
widespread Internet access. Until everyo- 
ne has interactive digital television, the 
Net seems to be the quickest, cheapest 
and only truly interactive way for citizens 
to exchange information and opinions 
between themselves as well as with their 
elected representatives. 
Most political parties now have their 
own websites to present their platforms. 
Numerous public services use them to 
explain their structure, operations and 
aims and to answer people’s questions by 
e-mail. And many municipalities provide 
information and consult citizens by e- 
mail before taking any major decision. 
A chance 
to voice views 
New citizens groups that believe in a 
different kind of globalisation also make 
intensive use of the Internet. In South 
Korea, where nearly half the population is 
on line, 600 community organizations 
recently posted a “black list” on the Web 
of 90 parliamentary candidates with 
murky pasts, including some who had 
been convicted of corruption. Fifty-eight 
of them were defeated in the subsequent 
election, some by virtual unknowns. 
Askwith suggests going one step fur- 
ther. He sharply criticised the way a typi- 
cal British Royal Commission set up to 
study a controversial issue operated. In 
practice, only the views of the panel's 
members and the “experts” who appea- 
red before it carried any weight, he said. 
The citizens who attended the hearing 
were few and unrepresentative. They were 
“mostly the retired and unemployed, 
since the ill-publicised event took place 
on a Thursday afternoon.” They did not 
really understand the issue at hand and 
were asked to speak only at the end of the 
hearing, and even then only briefly and 
for appearance’s sake.

In contrast, he says, stand the poten- 
tial advantages of the Internet, which is 
already used by campaigners who, though 
scattered across the world, are all on-line 
at the same time, sometimes several hun- 
dred of them for days on end, delving 
deeply into an issue and expressing infor- 
med and considered opinions. These 
groups are known as amphinets. It all 
costs very little compared with a face-to- 
face meeting of all the participants. 
Askwith asks, why not use this method 
and open it up to ordinary citizens chosen 
at random? Their views, representing 
public opinion, would reach the “repre- 
sentatives of the people,” who would no 
longer just vaguely hear them but be for- 
ced to take their views seriously. 
Other e-democracy advocates go even 
further. Rather than settling for using elec- 
tronic means merely to improve the flawed 
representativeness of elected officials, why 
not do without them altogether? Marc 
Strassman, executive director of the Cam- 
paign for Digital Democracy,3 suggests an 
electronic system good enough to eliminate

any possibility of fraud. Voters would use it 
to voice their views on every possible and 
imaginable issue, from whether a country 
should undertake a military operation to 
deciding on the content of a proposed law. 
The system would be advanced enough 
to immediately and electronically analyse 
the full range of opinions. Strassman says it 
would correct the “large and growing imba- 
lance in political influence between com- 
mon people and the professional political 
class and its clients who increasingly domi- 
nate the initiative process.” 
The time has gone when parliamentary 
decisions were taken after “consulting 
dozens of people whose opinions and views 
are highly privileged at the expense of mil- 
lions who are disadvantaged by this 
concentration of power,” Strassman says. 
We should switch to “direct electronic 
democracy” where “millions of e-mail votes 
determine the direction of the republic.” In 
short, he argues, “the Net becomes so 
powerful, so ubiquitous and so easy to use” 
that it can “let us govern ourselves.” 
Santini thinks this will be the key to “a 
shift from an occasional democracy to a 
continuous one.” It would be akin to revi- 
ving the agora in ancient Athens, the cradle 
of democracy where the city’s 20,000 citi- 
zens who were entitled to met and debated. 
The Net would make such a forum per- 
manent, instantaneous and, when every 
person on the planet is on line, worldwide. 
Over-reliance 
on technology 
“Nonsense,” says Frenchman Jacques 
Attali, the founder of Planetfinance,# an elec- 
tronic microcredit network. First, the agora 
would not be a democratic ideal: nobody has 
thought of reviving it where that would be 
possible, such as a village of a few hundred 
inhabitants. Why? Because the representa- 
tive system would remain indispensable. 
There is no doubt the system is in 
crisis, says Patrick Viveret, who writes for 
the French magazine Transversales Science 
Culture. He notes a tendency in represen- 
tative systems towards delegating authori- 
ty that could go as far as confiscating it 
altogether. So citizen participation would 
be absolutely vital to genuine 
representation, and the Net would

provide “substantial opportunities” in 
that regard. 
But making e-democracy a “global alter- 
native” would mean giving too much power 
to the “technicism” which is taking over the 
modern economy, the idea that “problems 
can be solved by technology, independently 
of the players involved,” warns Viveret. 
Democracy requires “collective intelli- 
gence”, which is much more than merely the 
sum of different opinions, as they are ins- 
tantly served up by opinion polls today and 
will be by the Internet tomorrow (the 
“democracy of opinions”). There needs to 
be “time for careful reflection,nurtured by 
opinions and counter-opinions bringing 
together mediators who say what they think 
in the public arena,” he says. 


### 120006: Africa: cell phones for citizenship

### 120005: Internet to the rescue of democracy?

AFRICA: CELL PHONES 
FOR CITIZENSHIP 
Ibrahima N’Diaye, the mayor of Mali’s capital Bamako, is banking on the Internet to boost 
democracy in Africa via specially-outfitted cell phones 
Do democracy and the Internet go together in 
Africa? 
They don’t, because the Internet has 
only just started appearing on the continent. 
To become a tool of democracy, the Internet 
must become democratic itself! The Web 
has penetrated every country in the world, 
but only two per cent of the globe’s popu- 
lation have access to it. In most African 
countries, the Internet is used only by an 
elite living mostly in big cities. To make it 
more widespread, we need support from the 
wealthy countries. 
What do you expect from them? 
That they help us develop an infra- 
structure as cheaply as possible while 
taking local conditions into account. 
We're not asking for hand-outs. If they 
decide to invest, they have everything to 
gain, especially in economies of scale. 
Ninety-eight per cent of the world’s 
population is not on line yet—that’s bil- 
lions of people. However poor they are, 
they represent an incredible market. The 
countries of the South will gain too, 
because new technology helps to spread 
information, which is a tremendous asset 
in promoting the growth of democracy. 
Then there’s the issue of solidarity. Rich 
countries invest a lot to foster democracy 
around the world. If the Internet is a means 
of helping to achieve that end, we'd be baf- 
fled if they didn’t help us overcome the 
obstacles in our way. 
What are those obstacles? 
The first major stumbling block is illi- 
teracy, which concerns about half of Mali’s 
population. What’s the point of giving all 
citizens Internet access if they can neither

read nor write? Of course we must teach 
them how, which is a long-term underta- 
king. We can also make use of technology. 
Nowadays, voice-activated computers and 
Braille give blind people access to the 
Internet. It’s easy to imagine similar devices 
for illiterate people. T he energy situation is 
just as bad. Fewer than 10 per cent of 
Malians have access to electricity or tele- 
phones. What can be done? In the short 
term we must settle for equipment that 
runs on batteries,for example. 
Which medium encourages the broadest 
possible participation in the democratic 
process in Mali today? 
There’s no question it’s radio, which 
overcomes the dual problems of illiteracy

Also needed, says Attali, is the “time 
for political initiatives to prove their 
worth.” That might entail a period of 
unpopularity before they eventually gain 
widespread support. The alternative, he 
says, is an “Internet world” that would 
lead to “excessively reversible and contra- 
dictory decisions”, and consequently to a

languages. Transistor radios are small, cheap 
and battery-powered. What the transistor 
radio is today, the mobile phone will be 
tomorrow. Soon the Internet will be acces- 
sible by mobile phone, and I'm sure that will 
help us take a big leap forward. 
Mobile phones with Internet access will be 
tremendously expensive. 
True, but radios were also very expen- 
sive when they first appeared. It might 
seem illusory to picture the spread of mobile 
phones in Africa, but technology is develo- 
ping very quickly, which brings prices down 
just as fast. Political determination and 
the commitment of companies will be cru- 
cial to the future of such technology in 
Africa. 
If the Internet was widespread in Mali today, 
how would it affect democracy? 
It would encourage more citizens to 
take part in the democratic process. It 
would probably be more effective than 
radio in helping them to learn things and 
to voice their opinions. At election time, 
computerised voting would solve major 
problems, such as the participation of 
Malians living abroad (20-25 per cent of 
the population) and of villagers who must 
sometimes travel 20-30 kilometers to 
reach the nearing polling station. But, 
technical problems aside, Malians are not 
exactly flocking to the voting booth. They 
seem to have lost faith in the country’s 
political leaders, and we mustn’t rely on 
the Internet to make up for their lack of 
motivation. |

### 120007: Margarita Salas: knowledge to dispel fear

MARGARITA SALAS 
KNOWLEDGE 
TO DISPEL FEAR 
Margarita Salas, a Spanish pioneer in molecular biology, dismisses alarmist reactions to recent 
scientific advances and stays thoroughly optimistic on all fronts 
Do you think research to decode the human 
genome should be placed in the public 
domain? 
We cannot patent basic knowledge of 
the sequence.What we possess in our own 
organisms, biologically speaking, cannot 
be patented even by law. But applications 
derived from knowledge of our genes can 
be. The U.S. company Celera Genomics 
seems to be leading the race to decode the 
entire human genome sequence. 
According to press reports, the firm has 
already decoded the entire sequence— 
some 50 million “bits” of DN A—though 
they still have to fit the pieces together, 
rather like a jigsaw puzzle. On the other 
side 1s the public consortium, made up of 
teams from a number of countries wor- 
king through their national public health 
institutes, which are proceeding more 
slowly and hope to finish the sequencing 
in two years’ time. But they are progres- 
sing in a more orderly fashion. So that 
when they do finish the sequences, they 
will know exactly where each part goes. At 
first the private company tried to patent 
the sequences, and there were many 
public figures, including some very 
renowned scientists such as the presidents 
of the American Academy of Science and 
of the British Royal Society, who opposed 
the “patentability” of gene sequences. Bill 
Clinton and Tony Blair also protested. 
The company seems to have backed down 
and will make its results public. However, 
what can be patented are the possible 
uses of those sequences in methods to 
cure specific illnesses. 
Are we witnessing the excessive 
commercialisation of science? 
Partly, yes. There might be excessive 
commercialisation if the proper limits are 
not imposed. There is an interesting case in 
connection with cloning: scientists from a 
research institute at the University of 
Wisconsin succeeded in 1998 in deriving

and culturing human embryonic stem cells 
—cells that are the parent cells of all tissues 
in the body. The achievement has profound 
implications for transplant medicine. Only 
private firms currently fund this work, 
because in the United States there is a law 
banning the public funding of research 
based on human embryos. It is very dange- 
rous to let this sort of work remain solely in 
private hands. These firms will be able to 
patent their findings and make people fork 
out presumably large sums of money when 
they have to undergo transplant operations. 
If the funding came from public sources, 
this monopoly wouldn’t exist. 
But are governments investing enough in basic 
research? 
It’s impossible to make generalisations. 
The percentage of gross domestic product 
earmarked for research in places like the 
United States or in some of the most deve- 
loped European countries hovers around 
two to 2.5 per cent, sometimes even more. 
Spain has one of the lowest levels of resear- 
ch funding in Europe, standing at 0.9 per 
cent, one point below the European Union 
average, so there’s a long way for us to go. 
The interesting thing about private fun- 
ding is that it comes not just from busi- 
nesses, but also from foundations and even 
from individuals. In the United States, for 
example, people who contribute to resear- 
ch funding are entitled to deduct it from 
their taxes, which is not the case in coun- 
tries like Spain. It’s vital to promote fiscal 
policies that encourage people to fund 
research. 
What are the potential risks of privately 
funded research? 
It’s dangerous if the results are witheld 
and patented in such a way that licenses 
are required to use the data. 
Scientific research is a highly competitive field. 
Is there room for cooperation? 
In the first place, scientists do not 
work alone. This is no longer the era of 
Ramon y Cajal.l Whether or not they 
share affinities, scientists must work in

teams for the simple reason that it’s 
impossible for an isolated individual to 
gather enough knowledge to have an 
international impact. In the European 
Union, for instance, we are seeing increa- 
sing cooperation, because support and 
funding are granted to teams formed by 
groups from different countries. But in 
the private sector, groups working at the 
cutting edge of science strive to get there 
before their competitors because of the 
huge economic stakes in volved. 
Are scientists doing anything 
to narrow the research gap between 
North and South? 
Researchers from the South take part 
in some collaborative projects and attend 
major international congresses, but in 
general this cooperation has more to do 
with institutional reasons than with any 
political will to narrow the gap. 
Why does cloning frighten people? 
Because they think of human cloning 
and that scientists will run amok with it. 
That’s ridiculous. First, the technology 
we have at the moment falls far short of 
enabling us to produce cloned humans, 
though it’s clear that it will improve until 
4 8 The Unesco Courier - June 2000 
that becomes possible. But then, what is 
the point of making individuals who are 
all alike? Over 20 years ago, when the 
issue of in vitro fertilisation arose, people 
said it was horrific, that it wasn’t natural. 
They wondered what sort of children 
would be born from this technology. 
Would they turn out like monsters? All 
sorts of things were said. The first girl 
born via this technique is now 23 or 24 
years old. She’s perfectly normal and in 
vitro fertilisation has solved many fertility 
problems. So has it been good or bad for 
humanity? 
So do you defend cloning? 
Once again, we have to make a few dis- 
tinctions. I think human cloning to produ- 
ce individual human beings is repellent, 
and in some countries there are laws 
against it. But we can envisage cloning a 
few stem cells to produce useful organ tis- 
sues towards therapeutic ends, or animal 
cloning for the same purpose or to make 
drugs. For example, a given gene can be 
implanted in a sheep. These genetically- 
modified animals can then be cloned to 
produce large quantities of factor IX, which 
is necessary for blood coagulation and is 
used in the treatment of haemophilia. 
Should limits be placed on scientific research 
to prevent abuse? 
Scientists themselves have demanded 
that their discoveries not be used against 
humanity. Furthermore, bioethics com- 
mittees involving scientists have spread all 
over the world in the past ten years and 
are working with the same aims. The main 
purpose of cloning is to obtain useful tis- 
sues which can, for example, mitigate the 
problem of the body rejecting organ 
transplants. There was a proposal to keep 
cells from the umbilical cords of new- 
borns so that in the future stem cells 
could be obtained in order to make tis- 
sues. That way, if someone needed an 
organ transplant, his or her own cells 
would be readily available, and doctors 
would be able to culture new tissue from 
them. That would circumvent the pro- 
blem of rejection and therefore be a very 
positive step forward. 
Another scientific advance which has sparked 
an uproar is genetically modified organisms. 
What is your opinion? 
T hose fears are entirely based on a lack of 
knowledge. Nature changes slowly all the 
time so that it can adapt. In the laboratory, 
those changes are simply accelerated.

S— eC 
Farmers have traditionally modified plants 
through genetic crossbreeding which gene- 
rates seeds that can grow in arid, saline or 
other soils. This was possible after a lot of 
time and work, and nobody thought it was 
wrong, even though it came down to geneti- 
cally modifying the seeds. A skin graft is also 
a genetic modification, though people are not 
afraid of it. And genetically modified plants 
are no different. Among the 50,000 or 
100,000 genes that a plant contains, only one 
or two different ones are added to make them 
resistant to insects, to a virus, or to saline soil. 
This is done through very simple experiments 
that can last days or weeks. Why are people 
afraid? Because they don’t know what’s invol- 
ved. On the other hand, every genetically 
modified plant has been tested before it is put 
on the market. I do think that food which 
comes from genetically modified plants 
should be properly labelled so the consumer 
can decide. But eating products that come 
from genetically modified plants does not 
entail any sort of risk: I myself would have no 
objections to eating them. 
What is the exact motive behind creating 
genetically modified organisms? 
Genetically modified plants can have 
nothing but benefits for the human spe- 
cies. The other day I read about a kind of 
genetically modified rice which produces 
a 35 per cent greater crop yield. The 
importance for countries suffering from 
famines is obvious. It’s true that those 
seeds are patented, but over time the 
patents will fall into the public domain 
and the seeds will be cheaper. Not long 
ago we received a visit from Norman 
Borlaug, an agronomist who won the 
1970 Nobel Prize for his work in adapting 
INTERVIEW 
 
A LIFE FOR SCIENCE 
Se 1901, when the Swedish Academy set 
p Nobel prizes for achievements in various 
scientific disciplines, only 11 women, compared 
with 435 men, have received one of the awards. 
But with the help of programmes to support 
women’s involvement in scientific research 
sponsored by UNEsco and the European 
Commission, the careers and commitment of 
several female pioneers have proved that scien- 
ce is no longer an all-male domain. Margarita 
Salas has faith that “in the not too distant futu- 
re women will achieve a rate of participation in 
the professional world and in society high 
enough for them to believe that they matter at 
all levels and in every situation. And not becau- 
se there are quotas: I'm totally against quotas 
for women. It's up to us to conquer the space 
that we deserve.” She has done just that by 
devoting herself entirely to her profession: “I 
like other things too, like music or art... 1 go to 
concerts and exhibitions, but research is the 
purpose of my life,” she says. 
Born in Canero in Spain’s Asturias in 1938,   
Salas was 16 when the “yearning for discove- 
ry” took her to Madrid to study chemistry. At 
19 she met Severo Ochoa, who won the Nobel 
Prize for Medicine the following year. Ochoa 
encouraged her to write a doctoral thesis in 
Madrid and, later, to work with him in his New 
York laboratory. Today, this molecular biolo- 
gist’s résumé is 24 pages long and includes— 
besides two honoris causa degrees and over 
200 studies and articles in scientific journals— 
UNEsco’s Carlos J. Finley prize (1991) and the 
Jaime | research prize (1994), among others. 
Since 1995, she has headed the Instituto de 
Espafia. On January 10, 2000, UNesco Director- 
General Koichiro Matsuura presented her in 
Paris with the UNEsco-L'Oréal prize for the best 
European scientist of 1999, an honour for 
which 34 candidates were competing. Four

movement against them is ridiculous in 
light of all his work to enable plants to

You seem to have perfect trust in the intrinsic 
goodness of scientists. 
Science in general is moving in the 
right direction, towards helping humani- 
ty, not perverting it. New cloning and tis- 
sue transplant technology is developed for 
the good of human beings. There is no 
reason to be afraid, on the contrary. 
What can scientists do to put that message 
across? 
I believe there are more scientists 
interested in humanism than the other 
way around,because humanists think that 
science is too difficult to understand. That

INTERVIEW 
which I head and which includes the eight 
national academies, offers a series of 
conferences that give scientists the chan- 
ce to discuss and popularise physics, 
mathematics and genetics in a rigorous 
but simple way, using language the public 
can understand. We must work towards 
popularising science more widely. That 
means extra effort by scientists, but it 
ought to be a duty. 
What do you think the most important areas 
of research will be in this century? 
I think one of the most important is the 
brain. It is the essential key yet to be disco- 
vered: why we think, why we speak, what 
the molecular mechanisms are behind our 
thought processes. Many people are wor- 
king in that area. Besides, as John Maddox, 
who was editor of Nature magazine for 
many years has said, the human being’s 
intellectual capacity is so great that at some 
point in the future there will be nothing left 
to discover. 
Will that lead to boredom? 
Well, neither you nor I will be around to 
see it. Take the example we just discussed 
concerning sequencing the human genome, 
which is known as “the beginning of the 
end.” It’s one thing to have the sequence 
and quite another to know what it is worth 
and to understand the function of each one 
of our 100,000 genes. By current estimates, 
that will take another 100 years, so I don’t 
think we’ll have time to get bored. 
You've spent the last 30 years working with 
the phagocytic cell Phi-29. Could you explain 
what this is? 
It’s a virus which infects the Bacillus 
subtilis, a non-pathogenic bacterium 
which is widely used in biotechnology. 
When the virus infects this bacterium it 
destroys it, but causes no damage to other 
organisms. Phi-29 is simple and easy to 
handle; it has only 20 genes, in compari- 
son to the 100,000 which the human 
genome contains. Nevertheless, the 
control mechanism of this virus is pretty 
sophisticated, which makes it something 
of a model system. As a result, what we 
are studying in the virus can be extrapola- 
ted to other virus systems in more com- 
plex animals and organisms. The protein 
that we have studied in this virus also 
exists in a similar form in other viruses 
which are not innocuous, or “bad” shall 
we say, because they cause diseases like 
poliomyelitis, hepatitis B or hepatitis C. 
What professional achievement are you most 
proud of? 
Actually, there are two. One is very per- 
sonal. When I was working in the Severo 
Ochoa laboratory, I found two previously 
unknown proteins necessary to start syn- 
thesising proteins. It was a very important 
breakthrough and very satisfying for me, 
especially since I was just starting out and 
working alone. My second major achieve- 
ment was in Spain. I was part of a team that 
discovered another protein which is closely 
linked to the nucleic acid of the virus on 
which we are working. We proved that it was 
necessary for the replication of viral DNA. 
And your greatest disappointment? 
A scientist cannot expect success 
every day. There are disappointments 
throughout a scientist’s life. There are 
times when experiments don’t work, or 
when you get stuck in a dead-end and 
have to change direction, but they are 
minor setbacks and never too serious. I 
don’t think I’ve ever had a major disap- 
pointment. Besides, I'm an optimist. 
Would you say that there is a feminine and a 
masculine way of conducting research? 
In over 20 years of teaching I’ve had 
male and female doctoral and post-docto- 
ral students,and I don’t think there is any 
single feature that really sets them apart. 
Having said that, women have perhaps 
been less aggressive and more patient, 
while men have tried to be the first to 
come up with results. Nowadays, women 
are beginning to acquire a level of educa- 
tion that is making them bolder about not 
always staying one step behind men and 
always being more patient than they are. 
Apart from that nuance, I don’t see any 
differences. 
What would you say to a female student who 
wants to dedicate her life to scientific 
research? 
My advice would be the same for a 
woman or a man, which is that if they real- 
ly enjoy scientific research, they must 
understand that they will have to dedicate 
themselves 100 per cent to it. There are no 
half measures. You either give your life to it, 
or you don’t. If you are really prepared to 
devote all your time to research, then go 
ahead. And then I tell them it’s for life. WH
