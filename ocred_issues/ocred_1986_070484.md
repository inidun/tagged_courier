47 Spain 
 
The water tribunal 
The Huerta de Valencia, one of Europe’s most 
productive agricultural areas, has a long his- 
tory reaching back to the Arabs of al-Andalus 
(Muslim Spain), who introduced into it a var- 
iety of crops including the orange. Water is 
scarce, and its distribution, today as in the past 
a key to theregion’s prosperity, is governed by 
a set of ancient regulations with which all 
farmers who practise irrigation are bound to 
comply. A special court, the Tribunal de las 
Aguas, exists to make sure that the regulations 
are observed. It is the descendant of an institu- 
tion which, according to a text by the I1th- 
century Andalusian historian Ibn Hayyan, 
performed a similar task at the time of tiie 
Cordoban caliphate. The court, the members 
of which represent all the towns and villages of 
the Huerta, meets beside the Apostles’ Door in 
Valencia Cathedral every Thursday morning 
between 11 o’clock and noon. Following a sim- 
ple oral procedure, it settles lawsuits and im- 
poses fines, which are paid with the ancient 
currency of Valencia, the libra, worth 3.75 
pesetas.

chapter in the history of human culture. It saw the flowering 
of four centuries of the civilization of al-Andalus, Muslim 
Spain, which covered an area essentially that of Andalusia today. It 
also saw the apogee of the even older classical Arab Muslim 
civilization of which al-Andalus was but a part, although a distinc- 
tive part, and which extended from India to north Africa and the 
Iberian peninsula. 
Until the beginning of the thirteenth century, Cérdoba, capital of 
al-Andalus, was the most populous, the wealthiest and the most 
cultured city in Europe. Its Great Mosque, a legacy which has come 
down to us largely intact, provides magnificent testimony to its 
splendour. But the crowning glory of Cérdoba and al-Andalus 
undoubtedly lay in the sphere of intellectual creativity. In this 
region of southern Europe flourished a galaxy of great minds which 
would influence the development of modern thought and liter- 
ature: poets such as Ibn Hazm, al-Mu‘tamid and Ben Quzman; 
mystics such as Ibn ‘Arabi; thinkers such as Ibn Tufayl; geog- 
raphers such as al-Idrist; physicians such as Avenzoar; philosophers 
such as Ibn Gabirol (Avicebron), Ibn Masarra, Ibn Bajja (Avem- 
pace) and, above all, Maimonides and Averroés. 
Moses ben Maymian (Maimonides in Latinized form) and Ibn 
Rushd (the Averroés of the Europeans) were both born in Cérdoba 
within a few years of one another. The former Jewish, the latter 
Muslim, both writers in Arabic, they took the great tradition of 
Classical Antiquity and transmitted it, enriched and modified, to 
medieval Christendom. These two great Cordoban philosophers 
symbolize the cultural universalism of al-Andalus, a tradition 
which made for the fruitful co-existence of cultural traditions that 
sprang from the three great monotheistic religions, Islam, Judaism 
and Christianity, in a spirit of tolerance which, despite religious 
persecution as the period drew to an end, still stands as an example 
and was almost unique in its time. 
This issue of the Unesco Courier, devoted to these two great 
figures of universal learning, is an attempt to throw light on a great 
age of intellectual achievement, the age of classical Arab Muslim 
thought, which deserves to be more widely known and understood. 
Already last December, Unesco organized an international round 
table to mark the 850th anniversary of Maimonides’ birth. Part of 
the November 1986 issue of the magazine will be devoted to 
another major figure in this tradition: al-Ghazali, the Algacel of the 
Latins. In conclusion, it should be recalled that the authors, of all 
shades of opinion, to whom we have given space in this issue, 
express their own point of view which is not necessarily that of 
Unesco or of the editorial staff.

### 70432: Maimonides, a guide for the perplexed

Maimonides, 
a guide tor the perplexed 
by Amadou-Mahtar M’Bow 
In December 1985 Unesco organized at its Paris Headquarters an international symposium to mark the 850th anniversary 
of the birth in Cordoba of the great Jewish thinker Moses ben Maymiin (Maimonides). We publish below salient passages 
from an address given on this occasion by Mr. Amadou-Mahtar M’Bow, Director-General of Unesco. At another 
symposium held at Unesco Headquarters last December, the life and work of the Islamic philosopher al-Ghazali (Algacel) 
were also commemorated. Extracts from the address given by Mr. M’Bow during the al-Ghazali symposium will be 
published in the November issue of the Unesco Courier. 
AIMONIDES was at one and the 
M same time one of the greatest 
exponents of Jewish law, one of 
the authorities of medieval philosophy of 
Greek inspiration and one of the main con- 
tributors to the extraordinary blossoming of 
philosophic and scientific thinking which 
occurred in the Arab world in the eleventh 
and twelfth centuries. 
The Maimonides of The Guide of the Per- 
plexed is a thinker at the height of his 
powers who brings together into a meaning- 
ful whole Arab science, Greek philosophy 
and Jewish theology. In a letter to Samuel 
ibn Tibbon, who in France was embarking 
on the Hebrew translation of his work, 
Maimonides wrote as follows: 
“Take good care to study the works of 
Aristotle only with the help of his com- 
mentators—Alexander of Aphrodisias, 
  
Themistus or Averroés. The writings of 
Aristotle’s master, Plato, are parables and 
difficult to understand, and there is no need 
for recourse to them, as Aristotle's work is 
sufficient; nor, is it necessary to concern 
oneself with works written by his pre- 
decessors, for his intellect represents the 
acme of the human intellect, with the excep- 
tion of those who have received divine 
inspiration. ... As for logic, itis necessary to 
study only the works of Al-Farabi. All his 
writings are excellent. ... as are those of Ibn 
Bajja.” - 
It would be a mistake, however, to see in 
the approach adopted by Maimonides an 
exclusively philosophical orientation. He 
considered philosophy, including, be it 
said, the science of his time, as an essential 
preliminary to defining the ideal society and 
to pondering such fundamental questions 
as: Where do I come from? Where am [ 
going? What meaning can be attributed to 
the order of the world? What can be known 
about its creation? 
In Maimonides’ view the elucidation of- 
these questions should be the goal of all 
intellectual striving. In his own words: “... 
that perfection in which man can truly take 
pride lies in his having acquired, in a degree 
commensurate with his capacity, knowl- 
edge of God.” 
Maimonides was in fact addressing the 
undecided, the “perplexed” throughout the 
ages who are already virtuous in their 
religion and conduct, who are already con- 
versant with the philosophical sciences-and 
who are already inclined to exercise human 
reason and to apply it as widely as possible 
but who are nevertheless troubled in their 
minds, for they are unable to reconcile the

findings of science and philosophy with the 
literal meaning of the Scriptures. The per- 
plexed are, in sum, those who know that 
discursive reason cannot fully account for 
the mysteries of human existence and who, 
at the same time, do not intend to forgo the 
inexhaustible resources of reason. 
Logic and mathematics are tools that help 
the human mind to exercise its faculty of 
demonstration. But can demonstrative dis- 
course exhaust all our questions? Clearly 
not, in Maimonides’ view. He did not claim, 
any more than did his contemporary Ibn 
Rushd, that faith in reason exhausts the 
reasons for faith, even though some theo- 
logians criticized both men for having 
unduly magnified the power of reason. 
Concerning the limits of demonstrative 
science and, concomitantly, the meaning to 
be assigned to the interpretation of the 
Scriptures, one example among others 
throws light on the approach adopted by 
Maimonides. Aristotle is known to have 
distinguished the world of living, corrupt- 
ible beings—the “sublunar world”"—from 
the world of the heavenly spheres, actu- 
ated, so he felt, by a necessary being from

WORLD 
time immemorial. Down the centuries, 
many theologians of the three revealed 
religions have set in opposition to this con- 
ception that of the creation of the entire 
world by a free act of divine will. They 
defied the philosophers to account for the 
doubts concealed by Aristotle’s system. 
Al-Ghazali's famous critique of the “phil- 
osophers” is an example of this attitude. 
What does Maimonides say? “All that 
Aristotle has said regarding that which 
exists beneath the sphere of the moon all 
the way down to the centre of the earth is 
undoubtedly true and no one can claim 
otherwise, save him who has not under- 
stood. ... However, concerning that which 
lies above the sphere of the moon, what 
Aristotle has to say seems little more 
than conjecture.” 
As regards the limits of Aristotelian sci- 
ence—i.e., in his time, science tout court— 
Maimonides adds: “As for all that is in the 
heavens, man knows nothing except this 
small portion of mathematics. ... 1 would 
say, borrowing from poetry: ‘the heavens 
belong to the Lord; but He has given the 
earth to the sons of Adam...”. As for what is 
beneath the heavens, he has given man the 
ability to know it, for it is Man’s world and 
his abode, where he has been placed and of 
which he forms a part...”. 
Maimonides does not, however, dismiss 
out of hand a possible science or knowledge 
of the heavens. He repeats that he is per- 
fectly willing to hear a demonstration on 
this subject, if any such exists. In the mean- 
time, it is best to adopt an attitude which he 
describes as follows: “... To weary men’s 
minds with what they cannot grasp, not 
even possessing the wherewithal to do so, 
  
WORLD

would go against common sense and be a 
kind of madness. Let us confine ourselves to 
what is within our power; let us leave that 
which cannot be grasped by reason to him 
who has been visited by divine inspira- 
tion...”, 
He therefore introduces certain qualifica- 
tions into his interpretation of the Scrip- 
tures. When science has established a truth, 
there is nothing to be gained by setting it in 
opposition to the literal meaning of God's 
word; preference should be given to the 
allegorical meaning, the ta'wil of the Mus- 
lim theologians. However, the wisdom then 
required is even greater than that of the 
scientists although it should include it. 
Of these men, who would need to be at 
one and the same time scientists, lawgivers 
and defenders of a religion both demanding 
and enlightened, Maimonides draws a 
poetic portrait at the end of his “Guide™: 
“Those who have understood the demon- 
stration of all that is demonstrable; who 
have achieved certainty in metaphysical 
matters, wherever this is possible; or who 
have approached certainty, there where it 
can only be approached; they are the ones 
who ‘have attained the innermost abode 
where dwells the Lord’...”. 
Does not this description apply to Mai- 
monides himself, just as much as to the most 
brilliant minds of the great epoch that was 
his? And is it not because he attained such 
heights that he was able to clarify the think- 
ing and guide the faith of so many who came 
after him—from the researchers of Islam, to 
the commentators of the Mishna, from theo- 
logians of Christianity such as St. Thomas 
Aquinas and Meister Eckhart to such mod- 
ern philosophers as Leibniz and Spinoza?

the western Arab world and the most 
important, populous and wealthy city in 
Europe until the twelfth century. 
Its fertile valley and gardens, its rich soil 
and the splendour of its palaces and 
religious buildings, despite the vicissitudes 
of war and other harsh strokes of fate, have 
survived to the present day, as has the repu- 
tation of its people, famed for their knowl- 
edge and culture. 
After the great fitna or civil war which 
destroyed Cordoba at the downfall of the 
Umayyad monarchy, the city was reduced 
to the status of one more “petty kingdom” 
of the Bani *Abbad, the Lords of Seville. 
But the Almoravids and the Almohads 
made it once again the capital of al-Andalus 
and filled it with new leading lights in art, 
science and literature, until its conquest by 
the Christians. The Crusaders, in turn, were 
impressed by the city’s grandeur, thanks to 
which the Great Mosque has survived to 
this day. 
After the Islamic conquest the three great 
monotheistic religions existed side by side 
in Cordoba: the Jewish, Christian and Mus- 
lim faiths. Remarkable tolerance reigned 
between 711 and 1085, apart from isolated 
incidents and the persecution of Christians 
in the time of ‘Abd al-Rahman II. During 
the Almoravid period (1085-1146) there 
was greater intolerance of Christians and 
Jews, aggravated in the former case by the 
support given by the Andalusian 
Mozarabs" to the aceifa (military expedi- 
tion) led by King Alfonso VII of Castile. 
After the Almohad occupation, Jews and 
Christians were obliged to leave the terri- 
The splendour of the Umayyad caliphate 
ofal-Andalus reached its artistic apogee in 
the Great Mosque (today the cathedral) of 
Cordoba. Begun in 786 AD by ‘Abd al- 
Rahman I, “the Immigrant”, an Umayyad 
leader who escaped from ‘Abbasid 
Damascus and founded the emirate of 
Cordoba, it was enlarged and enriched 
over the centuries by his successors.

tory under their sway or to pretend, as did 
the family of Maimonides, that they had 
been converted to Islam. 
Cultural co-existence was a very different 
matter, although it worked to the advantage 
of the dominant social group and was lim- 
ited to certain times and certain categories 
of people. In the ruling classes, peaceful 
co-existence was confined to kings, nobles 
and scholars; where their subjects were con- 
cerned those who lived amicably side by 
side were scholars, artists or craftworkers— 
working as architects, astronomers, ambas- 
sadors, landowners, mathematicians, doe- 
tors, philosophers, tax-collectors, transla- 
tors, etc. In fact throughout the Middle 
Ages two major “established” cultures 
existed in the Iberian peninsula: the Latin- 
Christian and the Islamic. Judaism certainly 
existed also, but Judaeo-llebraic culture 
was fundamentally centred on the syn- 
agogue. Far from diminishing its greatness, 
this represents the greatest claim to glory of 
the Jewish community. Ilaving lost all real 
political power since their exile to Babylon, 
uprooted time and again from their lands, 
the Jewish people not only preserved the 
treasure of their faith and the testimony of 
their customs, but made a home of their 
countries of exile. No country seemed more 
like a “second homeland” to them than 
Sefarad, the name which they gave to the 
Iberian peninsula. But this made it incum- 
bent on them to become integrated with the 
prevailing social pattern, to use the lan- 
guage of their rulers and to assimilate the 
knowledge and wisdom of other peo- 
ples—in this case, to speak and write the 
Arabic language and to master science and 
philosophy as perfectly as Maimonides 
did. 
The importance of this great period of 
cultural co-existence, which later (in the 
second half of the twelfth century and in the 
thirteenth century) bequeathed its benefits 
to the medieval Christian world, is apparent 
in the work of two outstanding men of 
learning, both of whom were born in Cor- 
doba and wrote in Arabic: Averroés, a 
Muslim, and Maimonides, a Jew.

Centre of political power and of cultural 
and artistic development, the Cordoba of 
the Umayyad caliphate was for centuries a 
great focus of civilization. The caliphs 
took pleasure in welcoming to their court 
musicians, poets, architects and philo- 
sophers, who came sometimes from dis- 
tant countries, such as the great Persian 
  
musician Ziryab. Above, a painting which

a » Averroés: a universal Andalusian. The 
Bani Rushd family can be traced back for 
six or more generations. Averroés’ grand- 
father (450-520 AH/1058-1126 AD) known 
as Abid 1-Walid Muhammad b. Ahmad b. 
Muhammad al-gidd, “the grandfather”, to 
distinguish him from his famous grandson, 
was an outstanding jurist, chief gadi (gadi 
al-gama’‘) of Cordoba and adviser to the 
Almoravid and Almohad rulers. Thanks to 
his advice, the Mozarabs who lent their 
assistance to the Christian aceifa of Alfonso 
VII were only exiled, instead of being 
executed according to custom. Several of 
his works are still extant, including two 
monumental legal encyclopaedias: The 
Mugaddamat al mumalhhadat and the Kitab 
al-Talisil, 
Averroés’ father was called Abi I-Qasim 
Ahmad [bn Rushd (487-564 AH/1094-1168 
AD) and he too was a jurist and chief gadr 
of Cordoba. He took part in the educational 
reform ordered by the Almohad rulers. His 
son, Abi I-Walild Muhammad b. Ahmad b. 
Muhammad al-hafid, “the grandson”, to 
distinguish him from his grandfather, was 
born in Cérdoba in 520 AH/1126 AD, and 
in due course was to become the greatest of 
the Islamic philosophers and the most uni- 
versal of those born in the Iberian penin- 
sula. 
From a very early age Averroés studied 
the Arab humanities, Islamic law, medicine 
and philosophy. He was so industrious that, 
according to his biographers, he rested only 
twice in his lifetime: on the day of his 
father's death and on his own wedding day.

### 70436: Averroës and Maimonides, philosophers of al-Andalus

The igaza or licentia docendi, the equivalent 
of a lecturer’s diploma today, was probably 
awarded to him between 1141 and 1146, and 
he must have married between 1146 and 
1153. 
Towards the end of 1168, 1bn Tufayl, the 
author of the famous work Risala Hayy ibn 
Yagzan (“The Improvement of Human 
Reason”), introduced Averroés to the 
Almohad sultan Aba Ya‘qib Yisuf, to 
whom he was vizier and personal physician. 
The sultan reassured Averroés concerning 
his dedication to philosophy and even urged 
him to write a commentary on Aristotle. 
The monarch’s protection was very impor- 
tant, as acknowledged by Averroés in dedi- 
cating his “Commentary on Plato's 
Republic” to his successor. In 565 AH/1169 
AD he was appointed gddi of Seville, where 
he performed his duties to the satisfaction 
of the Sevillians, who showed their 
approval by interceding on his behalf when 
he fell from favour. In 578 AH/1182 AD 
Averroés was appointed chief gadi of Cor- 
doba and chief physician at the Almohad 
court, positions in which he was confirmed 
by the new sultan, AbG Yasuf Ya‘qub 
al-Mansur, in 580 AH/1184 AD. 
After the battle of Alarcos (18 June 
1195), at which the Almohad army crushed 
their Christian opponents, the intolerant 
alfaquies and ulemas (doctors of law and 
Islamic theologians) of Cérdoba denounced 
Averroés, with the result that his works 
were banned and he was exiled to Lucena 
for some twenty months. In 595 AH/1198 
AD the sultan pardoned him, restored his 
position at court and took him with his reti- 
nue to Marrakesh, perhaps in order to pro- 
tect him from his Andalusian enemies. On 
Thursday 9 safar of the year 595 AH (10 
December 1198), at the age of seventy-two, 
Averroés died in that Moroccan city. His 
body was transported three months later to 
Cérdoba and buried in the cemetery of the 
Bani ‘Abbad. The funeral must have been 
aremarkable occasion, since the great mys- 
tic Ibn ‘Arabi of Murcia tells us that he was 
present; the mule which carried Averroés’ 
mortal remains was laden with the corpse 
on one side and his books on the other as a 
counterweight. Thanks to an extract from 
the Kulliyat, we are able to deduce that he 
died of the complications of arthritis, from 
which he had suffered since his youth fol- 
lowing an attack of rheumatic fever which 
had not been properly treated when he was 
a child. 
Averroés is thought to have had more 
than five children. We know the names of 
only two of them: Abii Muhammad ‘Abd 
Allah ibn Rushd, a doctor, philosopher and 
gadr, like his father; and Abi al-Qasim 
Muhammad ibn Rushd, who died in 612 
AH/1215 AD and who also held the post of 
gdadi. The names of the other sons are lost, 
Because of his unorthodox ideas, towards 
the end of his life Averroés was exiled to 
Lucena, to the south of Cordoba. The fami- 
ly of Maimonides also was linked with this 
town, with its strong Jewish roots. Right,

but we know that they also held the position 
of gadi in al-Andalus. Of his grandchildren 
we have information about only one, Abi 
1-*‘Abbds Yahya b. Qasim ibn Rushd, who 
was likewise a judge. 
The writings of Averroés form an impres- 
sive corpus. As many as 127 works are 
attributed to him, but he cannot have writ- 
ten more than 84; of these 55 are still fully 
extant and parts of another eight have been 
preserved. These works constitute a com- 
plete scientific, legal, medical, philosophi- 
cal and theoretical encyclopaedia. In accor- 
dance with a convention of medieval 
scholarship, part of these works consists of 
an exegesis of the body of doctrine inherited 
from Antiquity (the Corpus aristotelicum in 
philosophy, the Corpus galenicum in medi- 
cine, etc.). For this reason, the Christian 
Schoolmen claimed that Averroés had writ- 
ten three types of commentaries on Aristo- 
tle (whereas in reality they are three exposi- 
tions of his philosophy), and called him 
“The Commentator”. 
Besides such expositions of Aristotle, 
Plato, Euclid and Galen, Averroés also 
wrote many works from a more personal 
approach, such as the Kitab al-Kulliyat 
(“Book of the General Principles of Medi- 
cine”); the great legal encyclopaedia Kitab 
al-Bidaya; the famous defence of philoso- 
phy against more traditional theologians, 
Tahafut al-Tahafur (“The Incoherence of 
the Incoherence™), which was an attack on 
The Incoherence of the Philosophers by 
al-Ghazali; and the theological works Fas! 
al-Magqal (“Decisive Treatise on the Har- 
mony of Religion and Philosophy”); and 
 
Kashf ‘an mandhij (on the interpretation of 
the revealed Scriptures). 
Beneath the scholastic appearance typi- 
cal of the forms and method of medieval 
scholarship lurks the distinction between 
scientific and philosophical knowledge on 
the one hand, and theology on the other, 
together with the idea of human wisdom as 
something which can exist independently, 
and even the concept of an altogether secu- 
lar society. It is not surprising that when 
Averroés’ ideas were encountered by the 
medieval Christians they caused real intel- 
lectual turmoil, and he was branded as an 
atheist and a blasphemer. 
At the same time, his writings on the 
natural world and medicine contain numer- 
ous empirical observations concerning 
astronomy, earthquakes, the growth of 
plants, the meat and wool of sheep, and 
even the food eaten in his time, for which he 
gives some recipes—for refiogo (a sim- 
mered meat dish), for humble fried eggs, 
for a dish of aubergines and for barley 
water, which are still typical of Spanish 
cooking. 
Averroés’ great human qualities were 
augmented by a strong affection for his 
native Cérdoba, which he regarded as the 
most beautiful of places, and for his com- 
patriots, whom he held to be the most intel- 
ligent people of their time. By contrast, he 
wrote with particular severity against 
tyrants of all periods, especially his own. 
“There is nothing worse than to be a 
tyrant,” he repeatedly wrote, and in his 
social theory he gave prominence to the 
analysis of the well-known dialogue p

Pp between master and slave, of Platonic 
origin, which Hegel was to make famous. 
He was the first, and perhaps the only, 
medieval thinker to criticize the status of 
women in society, which “turned them into 
cabbages” since it was impossible for them 
to achieve complete personal and social 
fulfilment. In his model society, the neces- 
sary order would come into being freely, 
there would be no distinction between 
“mine and thine”, and no-one would be 
treated as an outcast from the community of 
all human beings. 
Maimonides, “the Andalusian”, the uni- 
versal Jew. Averroés’ twenty-month exile to 
Lucena, a Cordoban town famous in the 
past for its distinguished Jewish com- 
munity, gave rise to the legend that he and 
Maimonides knew one another. Unfor- 
tunately this was not the case. The family of 
Moses ben Maymun, who was known as 
Maimonides and also as “Rambam™ (an 
anagram of Rabbi Moses ben Maymaun), 
had long been living in Cordoba. But when 
Averroés arrived in Lucena, Maimonides 
had been living in Cairo for thirty years. 
The Bani Maymiun held two unshake- 
able convictions: that they were descended 
from the line of King David and that they 
had Andalusian roots. They were estab- 
lished in Cordoba, well known and 
respected by the Cordoban Jewish com- 
munity, Rabbi Isaac ben Maymin, father of 
Maimonides, begat him in that city where, 
according to tradition, he was born in the 
siesta hour on Saturday 14 nisdn of the year 
4896 of the Jewish calendar (30 March 1135). 
There he received instruction in the Arab and 
Hebrew humanities and in the religion of 
Abraham and Moses. But in 542 AH/1147 
AD, as the Almohad army was marching 
towards Cordoba, Rabbi Isaac and his fam- 
ily, including his two sons David and Moses, 
left the city and took refuge in Granada, 
where they lived until 1150. Their next 
move was to Almeria, where Moses ben 
Maymin continued his education. But 
when this city in its turn was menaced by the 
Almoravids, Rabbi Isaac and his family 
were obliged to leave it, at the beginning of 
1160. They settled in Fez, where they had 
outwardly to dissemble (‘amiisim) the faith 
of Abraham and Moses, although in private 
they strictly adhered to it, In Almeria and 
In the year 1198 AD, Averroés, his position 
restored at the Almohad court in Cordoba, 
accompanied the sultan to Marrakesh, 
where he died on the 10th of December 
that same year. His body was taken back 
and buried in Cérdoba, his native city. 
Above, the Place Djemaa El-Fna and its 
famous market in Marrakesh. 
The Moroccan city of Fez was an important 
stage in the long, forced wanderings of 
Maimonides and his family. During five 
years there he completed his scientific 
and philosophical education and began to 
write his books. Right, this old blocked-up 
window in Maimonides’ family house at 
Fez was perhaps that of his study. Still 
preserved in the fagade are eight of the 
twelve bronze bowls which embellished it 
in the 12th century, which were apparently 
used by the philosopher scientist for his 
solar astronomical calculations. Above 
right, library of the al-Qarawiyyin mosque

Fez, Maimonides finished his scientific, po the city.

it was in Fez that he began to write the first 
of his books. 
Still fearing for their safety, Rabbi Isaac 
and his family decided to emigrate to the 
East, and on Saturday 4 iyar of the year 
4927 (18 April 1165) they took ship for Pal- 
estine, reaching Akko (St. Jean d’Acre) on 
3 jivdn (16 May) after a stormy voyage dur- 
ing which they almost lost their lives. They 
spent six months in Akko, then visited 
Jerusalem and Hebron in order to pray in 
the ruins of the temple and at the tomb of 
the patriarchs. According to tradition, 
there were only four Jewish families living 
in Jerusalem; the city was in ruins, to which 
Maimonides seems to have been referring 
when he said that such ruination was 
brought about by men and their strife: 
“May God give me strength in everything I 
do and help me to keep my promises, and 
may that for which I prayed, there in the 
ruins, be granted to me, and may all Israel 
soon see the Holy Land restored and res- 
cued from its decline.” 
The family of Rabbi Isaac left for Egypt, 
where they lived for a time in Alexandria. 
Maimonides was then thirty-one, and sor- 
row came to him again with the death of his 
father, which raised the problem of his own 
livelihood. Grief at his father’s death was 
eased by the countless testimonies of 
respect which he received, even from lands 
far distant from Egypt. The problem of 
keeping body and soul together was solved 
by his younger brother David, who used the

money inherited from his father to set him- 
self up as a merchant trading in precious 
stones. It may have been the intransigence 
of the Jewish “literalists” of Alexandria 
which compelled Maimonides to leave that 
city and travel to Fostat, or Old Cairo, 
where he completed his great commentary 
on the Mishra, in 1168. 
But misfortune again befell Maimonides 
with the death of his brother David, to 
whom he had always been very close and 
whom he would remember all his life, and 
that of his wife which occurred shortly after- 
wards. Thus he was faced with the problem 
of earning a living. Since he did not wish to 
be a burden on the community, he decided 
to support himself by working as a doctor. 
He communicated this plan to al-Fadil, 
vizier and royal secretary to the famous Sal- 
adin (Salah al-Din), who appointed him 
Court Physician, a position which added 
lustre to his reputation. It may have been 
around this time that Maimonides married 
again, this time a sister of another royal 
secretary, al-Mati, who himself married one 
of Maimonides’ sisters, with whom he had a 
son called Ibrahim. . 
In 1177 Maimonides was appointed nag- 
gib (ruler) of the Jewish community, which 
meant personal recognition within that 
community but was also an honour 
bestowed by Saladin on the Jews, since the 
post had been vacant for several years 
owing to the irregular conduct of the last 
incumbent. Maimonides never allowed the 
Jews to call him by the title of naggib, but 
the Arabs, undeterred by such modesty, 
repeatedly mentioned his title when writing 
of him. In carrying out his official duties, 
Maimonides distinguished himself by his 
integrity and his liberal attitudes. Despite 
these heavy responsibilities and his unre- 
mitting work as a doctor, in 1180 he suc- 
ceeded in completing the Mishne Torah 
(“The Torah Reviewed”), begun twelve 
years previously. 
Maimonides’ biographers describe his 
long working day. He would rise at first 
light and ride on horseback to the court, 
which in those days was in Cairo, several 
kilometres north of Fostat. He lectured on 
philosophy and medicine and attended to 
his patients at court. In the early afternoon 
he returned home, dealt with official mat- 
ters and treated his many other patients, 
most of whom were poor and needy. More 
In 1165 Maimonides and his family took 
ship at Ceuta for Palestine. After dis- 
embarking at St. Jean d’Acre, where they 
stayed for a time, they visited Jerusalem 
and other holy places of Judaism. Later 
they left for Egypt, settling in Fostat (Old 
Cairo). Here Maimonides wrote the major 
part of his work and held important posts, 
notably that of physician to Saladin and 
his court. Opposite below, the Ben Ezra

than once there were so many of them, and 
so great was his fatigue, that he was obliged 
to lie down on his bed to conduct his medi- 
cal consultations. 
Yet it was during this period of his life 
(1185-1200) that he wrote the most univer- 
sal and grandiose of his works, The Guide of 
the Perplexed (Daldlat al-hd’irin), written in 
Arabic as were virtually all his books and all 
his letters. During this period (in 1190) the 
writings of Averroés reached Egypt, as 
Maimonides himself testifies. He took the 
view that the Cordoban Muslim thinker 
“interpreted Aristotle according to an 
appropriate and reliable method”. Never- 
theless, the Arab thinkers who really 
influenced Maimonides were Mu‘tazila, 
al-Farabi and Avempace (Ibn Bajja), and 
possibly also the Andalusian Ibn Tufayl, in 
view of the parallel approach adopted by 
both philosophers in the introductions to 
their most important works. 
The fame of Maimonides, both for his 
work and writings in the field of medicine 
and for his Guide of the Perplexed, spread 
throughout the Arab world and the Jewish 
communities. In 1195, for example, a letter 
arrived in Cairo from the Jewish community 
of Lunel, in Provence, hailing his supreme 
authority in rabbinics. It came at a time of 
affliction, for Maimonides was ill and had 
been the butt of accusations by the most 
intransigent of his critics. But letters such as 
this, and the high opinion of the sultan 
al-Afdal, Saladin’s elder son and successor, 
brought him consolation for his mental and

physical sufferings. When the scholars of 
Lunel received the copy of the Guide of the 
Perplexed which they had requested, they 
entrusted the Sephardic Jew Samuel ben 
Tibbon with the task of translating it into 
Hebrew. The task was an arduous one, but 
on 30 November 1204 Samuel ben Tibbon 
finished the translation, which in Hebrew 
bore the title Moré Nebitkhin. Samuel ben 
Tibbon had hoped to deliver the translation 
personally into Maimonides’ hands, but 
during the night of 20 tebe of the year 4965 
(13 December 1204), Moses ben Maymiin 
departed this life. According to his wishes, 
his body was taken to Tiberias (Israel), 
where he was buried. 
The written works of Maimonides are 
very extensive, chief among them being the 
many medical writings (some of which have 
been published for the first time in recent 
years), the scientific learning of which is 
proof of considerable advances in the care 
of the sick comparable to the practices of 
those Averroés called the “new Andalusian 
doctors”, in other words those of the Bani 
Zuhr (Latin Avenzoar) family. Also of 
great importance are his Commentary on 
the Mishna, the impressive Mishne Torah, 
and, above all, The Guide of the Perplexed, 
the greatest landmark in Jewish writing 
since the Scriptures. Soon after Mai- 
monides’ death it was being said in Jewish 
communities that “between Moses and 
Moses, there is no one to choose but 
Moses”; in other words, Maimonides is the 
second Moses of the Jewish people. =

thought 
by Mohammed Arkoun 
Maymiin(1135-1204), more commonly 
known in the West as Averroés and 
Maimonides, dominated the twelfth cen- 
tury by the power of their thought, the vol- 
ume and the variety of their writings, their 
intellectual commitment to the service of 
their respective communities and, not least, 
their wide influence in the Western 
world. 
Both were born in Cordoba, the brilliant 
capital of what was then Muslim Andalusia, 
into families of jurists (of gadis, for the 
Muslim Averroés, of rabbis, for the Jewish 
Maimonides). Both lived for a time in 
Morocco—Averroés at Marrakesh (where 
he died in 1198), under the patronage of the 
Almohad ruler Abit Ya‘qub (1163-1184) 
and of his successor Ya'qub al-Mansur 
(1184-1199), and Maimonides at Fez, where 
he took refuge in 1160. In 1165 Maimonides 
was obliged to seek refuge again, this time 
in Cairo, where he became head of the Jew- 
ish community and physician to al-Fadil, 
vizier of the Sultan Saladin, and where he 
died in 1204, just six years after Averroés. 
To be born into a family of magistrates 
whose task it was to apply the standards of 
religious law within a society totally subject 
to the dogmas of revealed religions, to be 
oneself a judge or doctor of religious law 
and yet at the same time to devote one’s 
energies to the secular sciences grouped 
together under the name of philosophy— 
this was the mark of a certain society and a 
certain age. Confrontation between the 
revealed religions and the Greek philosophi- 
cal tradition went back to Philo of Alex- 
andria and the Fathers of the Church. In the 
Islamic context, it became more intense 
from the third century of the Hegira (ninth 
century AD). Maimonides claimed intellec- 
tual kinship with the Muslim philosopher 
al-Farabi (878-950) and held the philos- 
opher-scientist Ibn Sina (Avicenna, 980- 
1037) in great respect, whilst expressing 
some reservations on his teachings. He also 
acknowledged his debt to Averroés who, 
with his critical re-examination of four cen- 
turies of Arab Muslim research, endowed 
the twelfth century with the most faithful 
expression of Aristotelian philosophy. 
[tis in this historical context that the work 
of these two mediators should be consid- 
ered. I call them “mediators™ because they 
did much to reconcile rational philosophy 
with revealed religion and also because they 
I: Rushd (1126-1198) and Musa lbn created a meta-theological language which 
made possible enduring communication 
between the three great religious commu- 
nities stemming from the same initial phe- 
nomenon of revelation yet irremediably 
opposed and divided by mutually exclusive 
theological systems. 
Even today, Christians and Jews are 
reluctant to admit an intellectual and 
cultural debt to classical Arab Islamic 
thought. Certain Jewish thinkers take this 
reluctance so far as failing to mention that a 
large number of Maimonides’ works were 
conceived and written in Arabie. Some 
biographers maintain that Maimonides may 
even have been converted to Islam; even if 
such a conversion was forced, it throws 
some light on the possibilities of cultural 
communication and the differences of rites 
and dogma between the religious commu- 
nities of the Middle Ages. 
Atall events, it is important to stress that 
the works of these two sages are concerned 
both with philosophy and religion. In exam- 
ining Aristotle's rationalism in depth in his 
closely-argued commentaries, Averroés 
created a new intellectual climate which 
Maimonides, for the Jews, and St. Thomas 
Aquinas, for the Catholics, took advantage 
of to elaborate theological theories which 
are not wholly outdated even today. 
To the Neoplatonism of the “oriental” 
philosophers, the dialectical weakness of 
the Ash‘arite school and the simplistic, 
legalistic dogmatism of the jurists, Aver- 
roés opposed the demonstrative (Analyti- 
cal) method, dialectical (Topical) reasoning 
and persuasive (Rhetorical) argumenta- 
tion, the categories of logic (Organon) 
which reflect Aristotle’s philosophical prac- 
tice and approach. In this attempt at the 
rationalization of knowledge Averroés does 
not seem to have been aware of the contri- 
bution of the Mu'tazilites®). The teachings 
of this important Islamic school, which, as 
early as the second to the fourth century of 
the Hegira (eighth to tenth century AD), 
did so much to restore confidence in 
rationalism, did not spread to the Muslim 
West (Andalusia, the Maghreb) owing to 
the opposition of the Malekite juristst), It 
was these same Malekites who succeeded in 
obtaining the banishment of Averroés him- 
self towards the end of his life. 
The political and social position of the 
jurists (fugahds) was an abiding factor in the 
history of the intellectual activity and

### 70437: Two mediators of medieval thought

Parchment manuscript page of the second 
part of Maimonides’ Guide of the Per- 
plexed, in the Hebrew translation com- 
pleted by Samuel ben Tibbon, a Jew from 
Provence, in the lifetime of the author. 
Maimonides, in a letter to his coreligionist, 
advised him on the best way to translate. 
This manuscript is earlier than 1356 AD, 
the date when it is known that the manu- 
script was used as security for a loan 
(perhaps in the Spanish town of Huesca). 
The title of the work here stands out 
against a floral background, with an ani- 
mal motif on the lower part of the page. 
religious thought of the Muslim West. 
Strong ideological pressure had everywhere 
established the teachings of the Malekite 
school as the exclusive expression of Islam. 
With the fall of the Caliphate of Cérdoba 
(1031), the break-up of Muslim Spain into 
petty kingdoms and the growing pressure of 
the Christian reconquest, the Reconquista, 
Islam fostered an ideology of combat 
(jihad) so as to mobilize its forces; this gave 
added importance to the role of the jurists 
and, even more, of the popular preachers. 
Thus, rather than deplore the fanaticism 
of the Almoravids and the Almohads, the 
historian would do better to examine the 
social and ideological context of intellectual 
activity in the Muslim West. 
The difficulties Averroés encountered 
and the conversion of Maimonides, 
whether feigned or sincere, are indicative of 
the general climate of the time and also, 
going beyond the specific situation in 
Andalusia, of the tension between the 
“rational” or “intrusive” sciences (‘agliyya- 
dakhila) and the “religious” or “traditional” 
sciences (duniyya-nagliyya) throughout 
Islam. The struggle between the Mu'taz- 
ilites and the Hanbalites® in Baghdad in the 
third century of the Hegira/ninth century 
AD reflected both a socio-cultural split and 
a philosophical difference regarding the 
faculties, the paths and the seats of 
knowledge. 
Ghazali® (1058-1111 AD) had added a 
speculative dimension to the argument 
which, nearly a century later, captured the 
attention of Averroés. In his Thya ‘Ulum 
al-din (“The Revival of the Religious Sci- 
ences”), Ghazali inveighed against the stul- 
tifying literalism of the jurists, the gnostic 
constructs of the esotericists (al-Batiniyya) 
and the heretical deviations of the philos- 
ophers (falasifa)—all this in the name of a 
spiritual religion open to rational knowl- 
edge but nevertheless with the strict limita- 
tion that the body of revealed knowledge 
was not susceptible to critical investiga- 
tion. 
Averroés chose to contest the views of 
Ghazali as a means of furthering philosophi- 
cally (today we would say scientifically) the 
crucial debate on the relationship between 
philosophy and religion. In his Fas! 
al-magal fima bayn al shart'a wal-hikma 
min al itisal (“Decisive Treatise on the Har- 
mony of Religion and Philosophy™) Aver- 
roés replied to Ghazali's Faysal al-tafriga p

read this phrase in his own hand: “Fair 
copy of my book made by myself, Moses, 
son of Rabbi Maymin—blessed be the 
memory of this just man.” This is the old- 
est known signature of Maimonides. The 
Mishne Torah, Maimonides’ major rabbi- 
nical work, is a vast and detailed codifica- 
tion, with an Aristotelian philosophical 
base, of all the laws and rules characteriz- 
ing post-Biblical Judaism. It is the only 
one of his master works that he wrote in 
Hebrew.

“In examining Aristotle's rationalism in 
depth in his closely-argued commentar- 
ies, Averroés created a new intellectual 
climate which Maimonides, for the Jews, 
and St. Thomas Aquinas, for the Catholics, 
took advantage of to elaborate their theo- 
logical theories” (M. Arkoun). Mediator in 
the fullest sense of the word, Ibn Rushd 
made possible the attempt to reconcile 
rational philosophy and revealed faith 
which would characterize all Western 
scholasticism, in particular that of St. Tho- 
mas Aquinas. Thus he exerted a consider- 
able influence on European philosophy of 
the Middle Ages and succeeding centur- 
ies, even though the novelty and audacity 
of his ideas often shocked the defenders 
of Christian, as well as Islamic, tradition. 
Below, Averroés is depicted at right in this 
detail of The Triumph of St. Thomas 
Aquinas, fresco by the 15th century Italian 
painter Andrea de Firenze, in the “Spanish 
Chapel” of the Church of Santa Maria 
Novella, Florence. Part of this portrait of 
the philosopher is reproduced on the front 
cover of this issue.

j : 
Pp bayn al-islam wal zandaqa (“Distinction 
Between [slam and Impiety”); and in Taha- 
fut al-tahafut (“The Incoherence of the 
Incoherence™) he also refuted another work 
of Ghazali entitled Tahafut al falasifa (“The 
Incoherence of the Philosophers™). In more 
general terms he exposed the weaknesses of 
the methodology of the theologians (the 
Mutakallimin) in his Kashf ‘an manahij 
al-adilla (“Examination of the Methods of 
Proof Concerning the Doctrines of 
Religion”), as well as writing an important 
treatise on the basic sources of law (Bidayat 
al-Mujtahid). 
All these works go to show how deeply 
Averroés wanted to remain a Muslim 
thinker and, with all his philosophical cul- 
ture (the scientific knowledge of his age), to 
face up intellectually to all the problems 
arising from the confrontation between the 
Quranic revelation and the strictest philo- 
sophical standpoint. Latin commentators, 
and later the French writer Ernest Renan, 
distorted Averroés’ thought by thinking of 
him only in terms of his commentaries on 
Aristotle. For their part, Muslims so dis- 
trusted him as a philosopher that they for- 
got that he was also a Muslim thinker. 
Maimonides, for the Jews, and St. 
Thomas Aquinas, for the Christians (the 
Catholic Church of pre-Reformation days), 
adopted Averroés’ intellectual scheme for 
the purposes of their own communities, 
using the same philosophical approach, the 
same conceptual guidelines and methodol- 
ogy to systematize the received corpus of 
revealed knowledge of their different tradi- 
tions. For all three revealed religions the 
great problem remained the harmonization 
of faith and reason, the reconciliation of 
religious law and the essential tenets or uni- 
versals of religion with Aristotle's logical 
processes and categories. The Torah, 
Canon Law and the Shari‘a, which express 
God's commandments as interpreted by 
learned experts in the Law trained in the 
exegesis of the Word of God, retain their 
supremacy. The difficulties that arise are 
not concerned with the norms thus deduced 
from the revealed word, but with the dogma 
on which the Law itself is based. Three 
essential points are at the heart of the con- 
frontation with philosophy: the creation of 
the world, causality, and the destiny of the 
soul (immortality and the body/soul 
duality). 
This is not the place to enter into the 
subtle discussions of these questions, which 
modern science has shifted towards new 
fields of research; of greater interest, it 
seems to me, is to examine to what extent 
Averroés and Maimonides were, and 
remain today, mediators between three 
communities and three historic destinies.

### 70437: Two mediators of medieval thought

Thought and culture as expressed in Ara- 
bic reached full flower in the sixth century 
of the Hegira/twelfth century AD thanks to 
the great works written in the East and the 
Muslim West from the second century of 
the Hegira/eighth century AD onwards. 
The intellectual and scientific supremacy of 
the Arab world of that time is confirmed by 
the many translations into Hebrew and 
Latin of studies on philosophy, medicine 
and the natural sciences written in Arabic 
by authors not all of whom were Muslims. 
Jews and Christians who lived in an Arab 
cultural setting thought and wrote in Ara- 
bic, thus enriching a body of knowledge and 
a range of intellectual activity that went 
beyond the limits set by the creeds of each 
of the three communities, Maimonides 
ranks among the greatest Jewish thinkers 
who conceived and wrote their works in 
Arabic in that area of intellectual and 
cultural convergence of which philosophy, 
as understood and practised in the Middle 
Ages, was largely representative. 
His works were, however, very soon 
translated into Hebrew. As early as 1204 
AD, his Guide of the Perplexed had been 
translated by Samuel ibn Tibbon, and this 
led the Jews to forget the cultural values and 
intellectual climate in which Maimonides 
had lived, worked and written. Today, the 
ideological tensions between Arabs and 
Israelis ts such that many Jews are unwilling 
to take into account the great thinker’s deep 
links with the corpus of learned writing in 
Arabic. Yet it was precisely the existence of 
these links that made even more precious 
Maimonides’ historic role as a mediator. 
The same could be said of St. Thomas 
Aquinas, even though he wrote all his 
works in Latin. His intellectual debt to 
Averroé€s in particular marks him out also as 
a leading light of a world of thought and 
human existence based on an axiological 
system common to that medieval intellec- 
tual milieu that I have elsewhere!® referred 
to as the “Societies of the Book™. I call 
“Societies of the Book” all those commu- 
nities whose existence, order and culture 
are based on the phenomenon of Revela- 
tion (a unique living God, revealing himself 
to men at a moment in history so as to 
communicate to them his commandments 
which then become the source of the Law) 
and on a philosophical culture which 
favours the search for a rational order of 
things. These two great lines of approach— 
Revelation and scientific and philosophical 
rationality—imposed an educative tension 
on all medieval thought, whatever its par- 
ticular religious attachment, in which at 
times religion and the “orthodox” tradition, 
at times reason, held sway. The whole of 
medieval thought bore the mark of this 
duality. The question remained: how could 
revealed knowledge be reconciled and 
brought into harmony with the necessary 
constraints of reason? 
Both Averroés and Maimonides suc- 
ceeded in achieving a real, personally satis- 
fying balance which they attempted to 
express in elaborately thought out systems 
in which they integrated rational knowledge 
(philosophy) and religious Law, the Sharia 
with all its developments and the Torah and 
the whole rabbinical tradition—Mai- 
monides’ Mishne Torah (“The Torah 
Reviewed”), was a systematization of the 
oral Law, Mishna, and the Talmud. 
Rationalist commentators on the two 
thinkers have attempted to claim them both 
as supporters of “pure” reason and a phil- 
osophy which, if not entirely secular, was at 
least distinct from religious ideas. 
However, the functions they fulfilled as 
judges in their respective religious commu- 
nities have to be disregarded and their writ- 
ings concerning the “religious sciences” of 
their time have to be ignored, if they are to 
be considered as “philosophers in dis- 
guise”. 
Like all the sages of his time, Maimonides 
had a lofty view of his responsibility as an 
intellectual capable of explaining to the 
faithful the teachings of religious Law whilst 
taking into account the fact that men had 
not all attained the same level of learning. 
In Book IIT of The Guide of the Perplexed, 
with the aid of a rich parable, he explains 
clearly the various stages and levels in any 
true search for God. I quote this entire pas-

MATMONIDES 
Maimonides tells how he spends his working 
day at Cairo 
[live at Fostat whereas the king resides in 
Cairo; the two towns are two sabbatical 
days apart [each equivalent to a league]. My 
obligations towards the king are very time 
consuming. I must pay him a visit each 
morning; when he is not well, or if his chil- 
dren and his wives fall ill, I dare not nor- 
mally go far from Cairo, being constrained 
to stay at the palace almost all day. It is also 
usual for me to have to look after one or 
another of his offieials. Thus, I go to Cairo 
every day at dawn and do not return to 
Fostat, even if something unexpected does 
not arise which forces me to stay in Cairo, 
until the early hours of the afternoon at 
best, racked by hunger. 
I find the waiting rooms of my home full 
of people: Jews and Gentiles, dignitaries 
and ordinary people, judges and officials, 
friends and enemies, a whole multitude who 
are impatiently waiting for me. I get down 
from my mount, wash my hands and go into 
the antechamber, praying to God that they 
will not be impatient while I quickly take a 
light refreshment: the sole meal worthy of 
the name which I have throughout the day. 
Then I receive them, I write prescriptions 
and advise them on the treatment corre- 
sponding to their ailments, and the people 
do not cease coming in and going out of the 
house until dusk, indeed until two hours 
after nightfall, I swear on the Law, and it 
may be that I have eaten or drunk nothing. 
When itis pitch dark, I am so weary that go 
to bed without even having been able to say 
goodnight. 
Only on Saturdays can I speak in private 
with a Jew, or meditate alone. Then, the 
whole community or at least a substantial 
number of its members, gathers in my house 
after the morning religious service; so I 
advise them on the best thing to do the 
following week, and we meditate together 
for a while until noon, the hour at which 
they leave. Some of them come back [in the 
afternoon] to study with me until the eve- 
ning prayer. Thus I pass my days.

Man is naturally a social being 
It has already been fully explained that 
man is naturally a social being, that by vir- 
tue of his nature he seeks to form commu- 
nities; man is therefore different from other 
living beings that are not compelled to com- 
bine into communities. He is, as you know, 
the highest form in the creation, and he 
therefore includes the largest number of 
constituent elements; this is the reason why 
the human race contains such a great variety 
of individuals, that we cannot discover two 
persons exactly alike in any moral quality, 
or in external appearance. The cause of this 
is the variety in man’s temperament ... Such 
a variety among the individuals of a class 
does not exist in any other class of living 
beings; for the variety in any other species is, 
limited; only man forms an exception; two 
persons may be so different from each other 
in every respect that they appear to belong 
to two different classes. ... This great vari- 
ety and the necessity of social life are essen- 
tial elements in man’s nature, But the well- 
being of society demands that there should 
be a leader able to regulate the actions of 
man. 
The Guide for the Perplexed, translated by 
M. Friedlander, Dover Publications, New York, 
1956, Part II, Chapter XL, pp. 232-3 
Ignorance is the cause of all evils 
All the great evils which men cause to 
each other because of certain intentions, 
desires, opinions, or religious principles, 
are likewise due to non-existence, because 
they originate in ignorance, which is 
absence of wisdom. ... In the same manner 
various classes of men, each man in propor- 
tion to his ignorance, bring great evils upon 
themselves and upon other individual mem- 
bers of the species. If men possessed 
wisdom ... they would not cause any injury 
to themselves or to others. 
The Guide for the Perplexed, idem, Part III, 
Chapter XL, p. 267 
Intellectual perfection is the highest level of 
true human perfection 
The ancient and the modern philosophers 
have shown that man can acquire four kinds 
of perfection. The first kind, the lowest, in 
the acquisition of which people spend their 
days, is perfection as regards property; the 
possession of money, garments, furniture, 
servants, land and the like; ... The second 
kind is more closely related to man’s body 
than the first. It includes the perfection of 
the shape, constitution and form of man’s 
body; ... The third kind of perfection is 
more closely connected with man himself 
than the second perfection. It includes 
moral perfection, the highest degree of 
excellency in man’s character. ... The 
fourth kind of perfection is the true perfec- 
tion of man; the possession of the highest 
intellectual faculties ... With this perfection 
man has obtained his final object; it gives 
him true human perfection; it remains to 
him alone; it gives him immortality, and on 
its account he is called man. 
The Guide for the Perplexed, idem, Part III, 
Chapter LIV, pp; 394-5 
The difficulties encountered in writing “The 
Commentary on the Mishna” 
I have finished this work in accordance 
with what I promised [when I began it], 
praying fervently to the All-Powerful that 
he should preserve me from error. But if 
anyone were to discover some error in this 
commentary or to know of some better 
explanation, I will readily accept them, and 
my only excuse will be that I have done my 
best to apply myself much more than some- 
one who writes expecting a reward or who is 
moved by self-interest. I have worked in 
very difficult conditions, as heaven desired 
that I live in exile and wandering from place 
to place; thus I have been obliged to do this 
work while I was travelling on land or sea. 
Suffice it to recall that during all this period 
other tasks also occupied my time, but I 
prefer the former explanation, in order to 
stimulate those who wish to criticize or gloss 
over this commentary, and supply at the 
same time [the reason] for the long process 
of compiling this work. I, Moses ben May- 
min, began this work when I was twenty- 
three years old, and I have finished it in 
Egypt at the age of thirty-three, in the year 
1479 of the Seleucid era (1168 AD).

A miniature 
anthology 
On the condition of women in medieval 
Islamic society 
And we say that women, in so far as they 
are of one kind with men, necessarily share 
in the end of man. They will differ only in 
less or more ... If the nature of men and 
women is of one kind, and the [nature] that 
is of one kind [turns] to only one activity in 
the city, then it is evident that the women in 
this city will practice the [same] activities as 
the men ... Similarly, too, since some 
women are formed with eminence and a 
praiseworthy disposition, it is not imposs- 
ible that there be philosophers and rulers 
among them. ... The competence of women 
is unknown, however, in these cities since 
they are only taken [in them] for procrea- 
tion and hence are placed at the service of 
their husbands and confined to procreation, 
upbringing, and suckling. Since women in 
these cities are not prepared with respect to 
any of the human virtues, they frequently 
resemble plants in these cities. Their being a 
burden upon the men {in these cities] is one 
of the causes of the poverty of these cities. 
This is because they are to be found there in 
double the number of men, while not 
understanding through [their] upbringing 
any of the necessary actions except for the 
few actions—like the art of spinning and 
weaving—that they undertake mostly at a 
time when they have need of them to make 
up for their lack of spending [power]. 
Averroés on Plato’s “Republic”, translated 
by Ralph Lerner © Cornell University Press, 
New York, 1974. The First Treatise, pp. 57-9 
Necessity for social cohesion 
Now there is no greater evil in the gov- 
ernance of the city than that governance 
which converts a single city into many cities, 
just as there is no greater good in cities than 
that which joins them together and makes 
them one. This being so, it is clear that 
community in advantages and damages will 
lead them to be bound to the city and 
befriend it. ... That is why it is said that 
people’s being near other people is advan- 
tageous. In general, there is nothing more 
productive of evil and confusion to the city 
than its citizens saying of some particular 
thing: “This is mine and this is not mine.” 
Averroés on Plato's “Republic”, idem 
The First Treatise, p. 64

The psychology of sight 
Sight has the property of capturing the col- 
ours of material reality, and so it must adapt 
itself adequately to matter. Thanks to this 
adequation, it can be abstracted by cogita- 
tion and understanding. ... The sense of 
sight [also] receives the forms of objects in 
the following manner: first, the air receives 
the [sensible] forms by means of light, con- 
ducting them straight to the tissue; then, the 
common sense receives the forms of the 
objects. The tissue contains the vitreous 
humour, which resembles a mirror the 
nature of which is between air and water, 
thanks to which it can capture the image 
from the air, which functions [also] as a 
mirror, and transmits it to the aqueous 
humour which, through its very condition, 
can communicate with the two natures. ... 
From this the common sense receives the 
forms which it transmits to the imaginative 
faculty where their reception, totally 
dematerialized, takes place. And so it is 
said that the received form shows three 
degrees: the first is the sensible [in the eye], 
the second is dematerialized in the common 
sense, and the third is immaterial in the 
imaginative faculty. From these degrees, 
one then passes to others, more elevated 
and more noble {in the memory and in the 
understanding]. 
Book of the General Principles of Medicine 
The prime mover is devoid of movement and 
eternal 
If a prime mover exists, which precedes 
all movements, whether temporally or 
essentially, then that movement will take 
place either in a generable and corruptible 
moving body, or in an eternal moving body. 
Thus [Aristotle] says that if it were a gener- 
able moving body, it would not be the prime 
mover, either by nature or temporally, 
because it cannot be asserted that the prime 
mover is a form generated in a moving 
body. 
Treatise on Physics 
AVERROES 
The most elevated knowledge alone brings 
happiness 
Just as hunger and thirst are an emptying 
of the body and an emptiness that befalls it, 
so are ignorance and absence of knowledge 
an emptying of the soul and an emptiness 
for it. This being so, there are two people 
who are filled—i.e., he who takes food and 
he who acquires knowledge. But the true 
fullness is only through the thing that has 
the noblest existence. ... Now if, in general, 
fullness in what one apprehends is pleasant, 
whatever [he apprehends of what] is essen- 
tially nobler and [participates] more in truth 
and is more enduring, is necessarily a more 
choiceworthy pleasure. Such is the case of 
the pleasure of the intellect relative to the 
other pleasures. 
Averroés on Plato’s “Republic”, idem 
The Third Treatise, pp. 146-7 
The virtues of the use of olive oil 
When it is derived from ripe and healthy 
olives and if its properties have not been 
adulterated in an artificial manner, the oil 
can be assimilated [perfectly] by the human 
organism. ... Foodstuffs seasoned with the 
oil are nourishing, so long as the oil is fresh 
and not very acidic. ... Generally, the entire 
substance of the oil agrees with man, and so 
at home [in al-Andalus] meat is seasoned 
only with this oil, because it is the best way 
to prepare it, while cooking it slowly. This is 
how it is done: place the meat in a casserole 
into which some oil has been poured, then 
add water and heat it on a low flame, with- 
out allowing it to boil. 
Book of the General Principles of Medicine 
The base condition of the tyrant 
This is necessarily the situation of the 
tyrant: he is detained among a class such as 
this, filled with hunger and fear. Moreover, 
he has great hunger [within] himself and 
cannot rule himself. Hence he cannot go 
wherever he wishes nor look at whatever he 
wishes. ... One of the worst dispositions of 
such an individual is that he is unable to 
restrain and overcome himself, yet he 
attempts to lead other people at some level. 
... The tyrant is the most enslaved of people 
and has no device by which to put an end to 
his desires, but rather is forever in continual 
sorrow and mourning. The soul of one who 
is of this description is an impoverished 
soul; hence he is envious, violent and 
friendless. ... Without any doubt, he is of 
necessity troubled and unlucky. 
Averroés on Plato’s “Republic”, idem

not yet seen even the face of the wall of the 
house. Of those that desire to go to the 
palace, some reachit, and go round about in 
scarch of the entrance gate; others have 
passcd through the gate, and walk about in 
the ante-chamber; and others have suc- 
cecded in entering into the inner part of the 
palace, and being in the same room with the 
king in the royal palace. But even the latter 
do not immediately on entering the palace 
see the king, or speak to him; for, after 
having entered the inner part of the palace, 
another effort is required before they can 
stand before the king—at a distance or close 
by—hear his words or speak to him. I will 
now explain the simile which I have made. 
The people who are abroad are all those 
that have no religion, neither one based on 
speculation nor one received by tradition. 
Such are the extreme Turks that wander 
about in the north, the Kushites who live in 
the south, and those in our country who are 
like these. I consider these as irrational 
beings and not as human beings; they are 
below mankind, but above monkeys, since 
they have the form and shape of man, and a 
mental faculty above that of the monkey. 
“Those who are in the country, but have 
their backs turned towards the king's pal- 
ace, are those who possess religion, belief, 
and thought, but happen to hold false doc- 
trines, which they either adopted in con- 
sequence of great mistakes made in their 
own speculations, or received from others 
who misled them. Because of these doc- 
trines they recede more and more from the 
royal palace the more they seem to proceed. 
These are worse than the first class, and 
under certain circumstances it may become 
necessary to slay them, and to extirpate 
their doctrines, in order that others should 
not be misled. 
“Those who desire to arrive at the palace, 
and to enter it, but have never yet seen it, 
are the mass of religious people; the multi- 
tude that observe the divine command- 
ments, but are ignorant. Those who arrive 
at the palace, but go round about it, are 
those who devote themselves exclusively to 
the study of the practical law; they believe 
traditionally in true principles of faith, and 
learn the practical worship of God, but are 
not trained in philosophical treatment of 
the principles of the Law, and do not 
endeavour to establish the truth of their 
faith by proof. Those who undertake to 
investigate the principles of religion, have 
come into the ante-chamber; and there is no 
doubt that these can also be divided into 
different grades. But those who have suc- 
ceeded in finding a proof for everything that 
can be proved, who have a true knowlcdge 
of God, so far as a true knowledge can be 
attained, and are near the truth, wherever 
an approach to the truth is possible, they 
have reached the goal, and are in the palace 
in which the king lives. 
“My son, so long as you are engaged in 
studying the Mathematical Sciences and 
Logic, you belong to those who go round 
about the palace in search of the gate. Thus 
our Sages figuratively use the phrase: ‘Ben- 
zoma is still outside’. When you understand 
Physics, you have entered the hall; and 
when, after completing the study of Natural 
Philosophy, you master Metaphysics, you 
have entered the innermost court, and are 
with the king in the same palace. You have 
attained the degree of the wise men, who 
include men of different grades of perfec- 
tion.” (The Guide of the Perplexed, 111, 
51) 
Averroés was even more insistent than 
Maimonides on the importance of not 
revealing “philosophical interpretations to 
those who are not able to comprehend 
them”. This was not because he had an aris- 
tocratic or elitist attitude towards philos- 
ophy or because he wanted to protect his 
reputation as a good Muslim; the fact is that 
he shared with other experts of the Law— 
Ghazall held the same view with regard to 
Kalam (Muslim scholastic theology)—the 
specifically religious conviction that great 
caution should be exercised by teachers so 
as not “to lead the faithful away from the 
divine Law”, following in this the example 
of “the divine legislator [who] cares for the 
well-being of the soul as a doctor cares for 
the health of the body”. 
It is true that Maimonides was much bet- 
ter received and respected within his com- 
munity than Averroés ever was by the Mus- 
lims. This is no doubt due to the fact that 
Maimonides compiled “guides™ to the 
orthodox faith to help the faithful avoid 
perdition and the loss of eternal salvation. 
Thus, in his “Commentary on the Mishna”, 
he summarized the thirteen articles of faith 
which every Jew must accept and which 
have been used, in verse form, since the 
fourteenth century in the daily ritual of 
Sephardic communities. Religious commu- 
nities, especially when they are minorities, 
need the cohesion provided by beliefs and 
rituals that are valid for all and act as a 
“safety net” for believers. Maimonides was 
well aware of this need, whereas it was not 
so vital a matter of concern for Averroés 
who was a member of a broader and more 
dominant Umma (community), especially 
during the time of the Almohads. 
At all events, the century of Averroés 
and Maimonides, succeeded shortly by that 
of St. Thomas Aquinas, is worthy of study 
with a view to a rcassessment of medieval 
thought which goes beyond the claims of 
supremacy of militant theologies or a his- 
tory of philosophy deprived of its medieval 
dimension, such as the secularized, positiv- 
ist, anti-clerical West has long imposed. 
In university courses as conceived and 
followed in the West, Arab philosophy is 
generally left to departments of Oriental 
studies which themselves are considered of 
only marginal importance within the uni- 
versities. If this state of affairs is to be rec- 
tified, a scientific revision must be under- 
taken of the overall history of the cultural 
climate of the Mediterranean during the 
Middle Ages, involving philosophy, theol- 
ogy and the history of the sciences. This is 
the lesson that emerges from the works of 
the two great mediators whom I have all too 
briefly presented here. =

### 70445: A Voice that speaks across the centuries

A voice that speaks 
across the centuries 
IGHT hundred and fifty years after 
his birth, Maimonides is still in 
some ways an enigmatic figure, and 
research into his writings is a detective story 
that passionately divides scholars and scien- 
tists. 
There are various reasons for this, some 
of them subjective. In the Jewish tradition, 
for example, Maimonides has become a 
“Rorschach ink blot” onto which people 
project their ideals, and sometimes— 
though very seldom—their enmity. 
On the one hand, Maimonides’ profound 
and encyclopaedic knowledge, the depth 
and scope of his writings, have made him a 
central authority for experts in many dif- 
ferent fields. On the other hand, his per- 
sonal integrity and dedication, his commit- 
ment to the future of his people, have given 
him a great significance to large numbers of 
men and women, not only as a focus of 
identification but as a caring teacher. He 
has certainly become, as the name of his 
main philosophical work implies, the 
“Guide”, but not only of the perplexed. 
Indeed, everyone who has studied his works 
has interpreted them in his own image and 
according to his own level of understanding. 
by Shalom Rosenberg 
This subjective picture is, however, only 
a partial representation of the whole truth. 
Great controversy. between even the most 
dispassionate modern scholars, is caused by 
the fact that Maimonides wrote in a special 
way. [He saw himsclf continuing the Biblical 
and Talmudic tradition of writing on two 
levels. The Bible and the Talmud are, 
according to him, books written for the 
masses, yet they have an inner level that 
speaks to the philosophers and those who 
havc advanced beyond the masses. 
The principal idea characterizing Mai- 
monides’ interpretation of the Scriptures is 
that the texts are relevant to all people at all 
times. His Biblical-philosophical exegesis 
took four variables into consideration. 
First, the linguistic component, whereby 
Detail of a miniature from a manuscript 
of Maimonides’ Mishne Torah, copied in 
Portugal in 1472, today preserved in the 
Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Mai- 
monides is represented clutching a roll of 
parchment, possibly the Mishne Torah 
tself. 
  
revelation is transmitted through a lan- 
guage, the semantic and syntactic charac- 
teristics of which cannot be ignored. 
Second, the historical perspective, by 
which Biblical issues and stories can only be 
understood in the light of their particular 
historical situations; taking into account, 
for example, the nature of a society that 
practises idolatry, or one that is not scien- 
tifically advanced. 
Philosophy may therefore be taught using 
one of two methods: the Greek way, in 
technical language and by construeting sys- 
tems that can only be understood after a 
lengthy initiation; or the Hebrew way, by 
encoding philosophy in a symbolic text and 
transmitting the key of interpretation from 
teacher to disciple. 
The third variable in Maimonides’ inter- 
pretation of the Seriptures is the psychologi- 
cal dimension—prophecy and revelation 
take place through the mediation of human 
beings. Anthropological and psychological 
characteristics are reflected in the very con- 
tent of revelation. 
A fourth variable, Sod (secret), is the use 
of esotericism as a teaching aid. The sacred 
texts must take into consideration the exis- pp

Pp tence of many people who are incapable of 
attaining philosophical perfection and 
whose exposure to metaphysical truths may 
be dangerous for them and for society. 
Maimonides applied this method to his 
own writings. In the introduction to his 
major work, The Guide of the Perplexed, he 
deliberately warns the reader that esoteric 
views are concealed in his book in such a 
way that only those who study the whole 
text will be able to find them. Ie sees this as 
the inner meaning of the Sage’s saying: 
~...apples of gold in settings of silver” 
(Proverbs, chapter XXV, verse 11). The 
“silver” structure of the Guide was imme- 
diately obvious and admired, but the nature 
of the inner “golden™ content is still being 
debated. 
As a result of its author's method, Mai- 
monides’ book has an impressive architec- 
tonic structure which connects all its parts. 
One constantly finds new secret doors lead- 
ing to an unmapped labyrinth of cross-refer- 
ences and varied hints, a guide to the hidden 
philosophical treasure—sometimes dif- 
ferent treasures for different readers. 
Maimonides was a great philosopher. To 
fully understand his system the reader 
would be obliged to abandon his contempo- 
rary world-view and adopt the medieval 
scientific and philosophic mentality. It is

important to note, however, that his teach- 
ings nevertheless still have relevance today. 
They are undoubtedly controversial; Mai- 
monides never intended to be “popular”. A 
meaningful presentation of Maimonidean 
thought would entail translating more of his 
ideas into our modern vocabulary. 
In an attempt to summarize his ideals of 
human behaviour, I would present them as 
a scale of four values which need to be 
attained sequentially: Society, Self-realiz- 
ation, Transcendence and Politics. Such a 
sequence will allow better understanding of 
each stage. 
Further clarification can also be achieved 
by using a theatrical analogy. We can con- 
sider a play from three different angles. It 
can be understood as the realization of the 
instructions of the script; or, from the stand- 
point of the director, as the realization of a 
certain situation on the stage; or as psycho- 
drama, wherein the play’s central function 
fies in the influence it has on the actors. In 
the same way, ethics can be understood 
either as deontological, as the fulfilment of 
the ethical categorical imperatives; or as 
utilitarian, fulfilling a social function; orasa 
means of self-transformation. 
Society. The first condition of human 
development is the existence of a healthy 
society that assures the basic freedoms of 
ors v

the individual. Maimonides thought that 
human beings are, as Aristotle wrote, 
“social by nature”. But people are individ- 
uals, distinct and different from one 
another. This is a divine blessing but also an 
imminent danger. The political structure is 
the instrument through which society gov- 
erns itself and provides a possibility for the 
individual to develop. 
Maimonides severely criticized the 
authoritarian and fanatical regimes of his 
time, and yearned forareturn to the ancient 
Biblical and Greek systems in which true 
religion, science and philosophy could 
flourish. His own experiences of wander- 
ings and persecution bear witness to his sin- 
cerity. 
This is the first version of ethics: social 
cthics, our duties in society. 
Self-realization. Society is not an end in 
itself. There is no such entity as a “people- 
by-itself”. A people, a nation, is above all a 
construction in which the real elements are 
the individuals. Society has to enable the 
development and full self-realization of 
each of its members. However, Mai- 
monides did not believe that this self- 
realization involves an arbitrary choice. A 
“human essence” exists, and people have to 
find it. The central imperative is “Grow!™, 
and society has to make this possible.

### 70445: A Voice that speaks across the centuries

Here we find Maimonides’ version of eth- 
ics as self-transformation, the idea of indi- 
vidual ethics moulded on the model of the 
psychodrama. Ethics must enable people to 
grow, to develop all their faculties, 
especially their intellectual faculties. Only 
then can the individual attain the central 
human aim, the knowledge of truth. Rea- 
son is the divine image that resides in every 
one of us. 
The ideas presented up to this point can 
be illustrated with Maimonides’ exposition 
of the Paradise story. The Biblical story 
seems to present a fools’ paradise in which 
suffering came to the world when Adam ate 
the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge. This, 
however, isan incorrect interpretation. The 
Paradise story is an archetypical representa- 
tion of the human condition. True knowl- 
edge and, as we shall see later, the pos- 
sibility of transcending the human condition 
are represented by the Tree of Life. The 
knowledge of the Tree of Knowledge is not 
the knowledge of true and false, but of good 
and evil, 
Without going too deeply into the 
ramifications of Maimonides’ explanation, 
it is clear that two types of knowledge are 
presented here: objective, rational knowl- 
edge as opposed to subjectively distorted 
systems constructed by rampant, uncon- 
trolled imagination. The Paradise story is 
not set inthe outside world, and in historical 
time, but in our own souls. A continuous 
struggle takes place between Adam and the 
serpent—the representation of irrational 
forces in man. As Goya masterfully por- 
trayed it, dreams of reason engender 
monsters. 
Accordingly, the Messianic age does not 
mean changes in the laws of nature, but 
according to Maimonides represents the 
age when people will be cured from their 
spiritual blindness which makes them harm- 
ful to their fellow men as well as to them- 
selves. 
Transcendence. Had Maimonides 
remained at this stage in his thought, his 
teachings would be very similar to those of 
other rationalistic systems in the history of 
philosophy. However, he used the philo- 
sophical background of his time which 
treated the possibility of conjunction with a 
supra-human reality, the “Active Intellect” 
of medieval tradition. The implication of 
this philosophy is that beyond natural dis- 
cursive rational activity there is an addi- 
tional epistemological category, the intui- 
tive way of prophecy, and the ultimate 
possibility of conjunction with what tran- 
scends common human experience. 
We cannot say whether or not Mai- 
monides accepted the reality of mystical ex- 
perience, and I would instead prefer to 
speak of some form of meta-intellectual 
experience, modelled on Biblical prophecy 
and attaining its highest level with Moses. 
According to the rabbis, Moses died the 
“death by a kiss”. This kiss, as in the alle- 
gory of the Song of Songs, is the true 
immortality, the union of the soul with tran- 
scendence. 
Politics. “In the Ways of the Lord.” At this 
stage, Maimonides’ thought resembles that 
of many mystical thinkers, and he might 
have succumbed to the temptation of those

who achieve perfection and bliss and forget 
society. However he goes on to close the 
circle, with the symbol of Jacob's ladder, by 
which God's envoys go up and down. We 
have seen him so far on his way up, but he 
speaks also of a return to society. The 
prophet is not only interested in his own 
personal experience; he has a duty to return 
and bring redemption to society. This is not 
because he needs society but because, now 
that he has reached the highest level of 
morality, he must go in the ways of the 
Lord. God had left His own perfect solitude 
and, in an act of grace, created the world. In 
his imitation we find the real meaning of 
politics, and we are able to return to the first 
stage, that of society. These are the roots of 
the Bible, the message of prophecy, that a 
new cycle begins at the point when the 
prophet returns to the people and presents 
them with a deontological system. 
Every summary is necessarily a distortion 
of the whole, and this is no exception. 
However if something may be added to 
soften the sharp edges of misunderstanding, 
it would be the idea of the absolute respon- 
sibility of the elite. 
There are pseudo-elites in the same way 
as idolatry is a pseudo-religion. Continuing 
Maimonides’ exegesis of the Paradise story, 
we could say that stationed in front of the 
Tree of Life there are angels with whirling 
swords; and that there are always people 
who mistake the flash of the sword for the 
shine of the Tree itself, as do those who 
confuse drugs with mystical experience. 
There will always be false prophets of whom 
humanity should beware. 
Intellectuals, scientists and scholars are 
not prophets, but according to Maimonides 
they are an elite and they influence the 
future development of the world. The true 
political, cultural and spiritual leader must 
obviously act neither in his own interests, 
nor as the representative of a single faction 
or group. He is bound to the general inter- 
ests of the community. Maimonides’ mes- 
sianic ideals were, however, not restricted 
to one community. In the “end of days” the 
whole world will be free from the curse of 
war, and, as the prophet said, the earth will 
be as full of understanding as the oceans are 
fuil of water. : =

### 70448: Averroës, reason and tolerance

Averroés, by M.A. Sinaceur 
reason and tolerance 
wish to evoke the man whom Latin 
Schoolmen held in boundless admira- 
tion or the researcher whose commentaries 
on Aristotle rivalled in power of thought the 
works he was analysing. Nor shall I dwell 
here on his life as a sober, pious judge or on 
the affinity of his approach with that 
developed by the great Islamic jurists, an 
approach characterized by a spirit of frank 
self-questioning. Instead I shall concentrate 
on two ideas, two notions which bring us 
abruptly face to face with: real problems, 
real questions, eternally posed. 
The first of these is the notion of the unity 
of reason. To know, it is postulated, is to 
acknowledge participation in universal 
knowledge. I use the word reason instead of 
the term intellect which Averroés used, true 
to the terminology of the philosophers of 
Alexandria and Baghdad. To transpose in 
this way is not to yield to lack of rigour and 
precision; it is simply a refusal to succumb 
to pettifogging and indecision or to bend the 
knee to a form of erudition for erudition’s 
sake. 
The unity of reason, then, was what 
Averroés propounded, an overriding con- 
cept which inspired audacious develop- 
ments. For the French philosopher/writer 
Ernest Renan (1823-1892) it was human 
thought taken as a whole, “a universal phe- 
nomenon stemming from superior powers”. 
Unity of reason encompasses the principles 
on which we base the demonstration that 
takes us a step further, the proof that suc- 
ceeds, the experiment which achieves its 
end. It is the unity of the psychological 
make-up of mankind—the hardships and 
vices that engender evil and suffering, and 
the faculties that enable us to construct the 
city of harmony and peace. It is humanity 
one and indivisible, living and permanent, 
as essential to itself as is personal dignity to 
the most individualistic of individuals, 
which the most intimate, innermost truth 
affords to him who recognizes and acknowl- 
edges it. Thus he who knows and is, is no 
more, as individual, than a splendid speci- 
men of the Universal. 
The second idea is not unconnected with 
the first. Reason cannot destroy faith. Both 
express the same truth. Now this was a 
notion that was as bound to displease the 
Schoolmen of old as it does the ideologists 
of today. Two truths, it should be remem- 
bered, cannot contradict each other. But, a 
word of caution, this is a truth that no single 
statement can exhaust, not inert truths that 
one can take hold of and possess. The real 
Averroés was a practitioner of rational tol- 
erance, a tolerance which was neither com- 
plaisant, sceptical nor moralistic: 
1. Reason should seek neither purposeless 
confrontation with nor the destruction of 
I reflecting on Averroés, it is not my the faith of those for whom it is a necessity. 
Among men there are many kinds of 
exchanges, undertakings and beliefs. Yet 
men can live together quite happily in a 
world in which opinions are varied and 
diverse. This is because there are opinions 
that merit respect; and to respect implies to 
explain and to understand. 
2. Reason demands that we examine other 
cultures in a spirit of understanding and 
objectivity: “We accept with joy whatever is 
in conformity with truth—truth, that is, 
which is the outcome of research; ... that 
which is not in conformity with truth we 
shall point out and excuse...” No matter 
whence it comes or where it originates, 
validity is the only condition knowledge has 
to fulfil. Knowledge is not the sole constitu- 
ent of the heritages of the different cultures; 
each of them also encompasses conceptions 
that comfort or disturb. 
3. Finally—although Averroés did not state 
this explicitly it is implicit in the whole 
thrust of his argument—what applies to 
religion and to philosophy applies also to 
any body of beliefs: concealed behind two 
apparently opposed truths lies an identity 
waiting to be discovered. Such an opposi- 
tion is an invitation to research, to medita- 
tion, to the elaboration of a unity which 
goes beyond the apparently contradictory 
expressions of diversity. 
By dint of excessive study, philological 
examination and pointless and laborious 
annotation it is possible to obscure the 
clearest lines of thought — such as those 
most dear to Averroés, and the most mean- 
ingful of his life. And it is these latter that 
have the power to move us. At a time when 
people are wondering anxiously whether 
there is today a place for such a thing as 
“modern humanism”, the least we can hope 
is that in recalling his ideas we shall ensure 
the continuance of the essential principles 
he stated so strongly. 
One day Averroés was informed of a holy 
man’s method of curing men and women by 
making them pay out sums of money equiv- 
alent to the supposed value, as determined 
by him, of their affected organs. Instead of 
launching into a diatribe against supersti- 
tion, Averroés declared: “There goes a man 
who believes that a human being can be 
moved by the act of giving.” It is to be 
hoped that evocation of the path followed 
by Averroés, the path of totally frank and 
open thought, has power to move the hearts 
of men today. n

Averroés was the greatest medieval inter- 
preter of Classical Greco-Latin thought. In 
his turn he passed on this heritage to other 
important thinkers, such as his compatriot 
Maimonides, and to Christian philo- 
sophers and theologians like St. Thomas 
Aquinas, St. Albertus Magnus and Duns 
Scotus, who regarded him as “The Com- 
mentator” on Aristotle. Below, a bust of

» opinions are based on “generally accep- 
ted”, plausible premises, unsuitable for 
procuring true knowledge. Members of the 
third category reach their convictions 
through demonstrations based on sound 
premises. 
Ibn Rushd identifies the rhetoricians with 
the “overwhelming mass”, with the 
“crowd”, that is, the body of faithful who do 
not aspire to the subtleties of theology, and 
even less to those of philosophy. The di- 
alecticians are the representatives of spe- 
culative (theoretical) theology, and those 
who belongto the “demonstrative class” are 
the philosophers who, in all societies, con- 
stitute a small intellectual elite which is 
-alone capable of acquiring true knowledge. 
Ibn Rushd was not the originator of this 
theory; it was expounded in detail by Ibn 
Sina, and before him by al-Farabi. Eastern 
“

§ 
Muslim philosophers were already classify- 
ing arguments into “apodictic” (demonstra- 
tive), “dialectical”, “rhetorical”, “sophisti- 
cal” and “poetical”, in decreasing order of 
cognitive value, ranging from “absolutely 
true” apodictic arguments to “absolutely 
false” poetical arguments. 
Poetical arguments occupy the lowest 
step on the ladder because they take into 
consideration, not the objective existence 
of objects, but their images, which are the 
tesult of the purest subjectivity. These argu- 
ments act on people’s imagination, not their 
reason, inciting positive or negative emo- 
tions. “Poetical” and “rhetorical” argu- 
ments were identified with religion; 
“sophistical” and “dialectical” arguments 
with speculative theology.

### 70467: Ibn Rushd and the Islamic philosophical tradition

Sina and al-Farabi al] share the basic convic- 
tion that religion is a “political art” which is 
only necessary to society insofar as society 
consists of an overwhelming majority of 
people incapable of assimilating abstract, 
theoretical truths, and for whom religion is 
the only means of providing their rela- 
tionships with a moral and legal framework. 
They teach that philosophy and religion 
are related to the extent that they are both 
concerned with the foundations of ex- 
istence. But this link is no more than nomi- 
nal. Al-Farabi prefers to regard religion as 
the daughter-in-law, not the daughter, of 
philosophy; and Ibn Rushd sees them as 
sisters by upbringing, but not by blood. For 
as far as knowledge is concerned, science 
and religion are strangers, insofar as reason 
works through rigorous demonstration, 
while faith is based on rhetoric and mythi- 
cal, poetical images. 
As for the assertion that Ibn Rushd’s 
predecessors had made concessions to 
theology and mysticism, it is simply the 
result of a widespread but radically mis- 
taken view of the history of medieval Ara- 
bic Muslim philosophy, according to which 
this philosophy owes its specific features to 
a blind take-over, by the Muslim world, of 
the legacy of Antiquity, integrating into 
Aristotelian metaphysics ideas borrowed 
from Neoplatonic works wrongly attributed 
to Aristotle. 
Ibn Rushd’s great merit is thus consi- 
dered to be that of refining the Aristotelian 
ideas from this Neoplatonic “dross”. The 
falsity of such an interpretation is shown 
solely by the fact that neither al-Kindi (c. 
800-870), who laid the foundations of East- 
ern Aristotelianism, nor al-Farabi who sys- 
tematized it, confused Aristotelian and 
Neoplatonic works, as can be seen from 
their own treatises which review the com- 
plete works of the great thinker of Anti- 
quity. 
An analysis of the work of al-Farabi, held 
responsible for this “original sin” of Arabic 
philosophy, clearly shows that the Neopla- 
tonic theory of emanationism (extra-tem- 
poral emission of existence from a single 
point of origin) has been incorporated into 
it quite deliberately, as a doctrine capable 
of formally reconciling the Aristotelian 
thesis of the eternal existence of the world 
and the religious dogma of its creation. 
This reconciliation was essential, con- 
sidering the social and political situation of 
the Muslim East in the tenth century, while 
philosophers were faced with the prospect 
of the foundation of a type of “ideal State” 
along the lines of the “ideal city” of Plato’s 
Republic. As in Plato, philosophers would 
be at the head of such a State, the ideologic- 
al foundations of which would be a religion, 
also ideal, modelled on philosophy. The 
 
In his works Averroés takes up the basic 
contribution of the Classical Greek philo- 
sophers, which does not imply that he was 
merely a follower who continued their 
work. On the contrary, the Cordoban philo- 
sopher marks the apogee of a great cur- 
rent of Islamic philosophy originating in 
Eastern Muslim thinkers of the standing of 
al-Kindi, al-Farabi and Avicenna (Ibn Sina) 
and culminating in the thinkers and philo- 
sophers of al-Andalus. Above, imaginary 
portrait of Ibn Sina from Authentic Por- 
traits and Lives of Illustrious Men, Greek, 
Latin and Pagan (1581) by the French 
monk and traveller André Thévet. It is now 
in the Museum of the History of Medicine, 
Paris. 
theory of emanationism would be at the 
centre of such a religion. 
The great success in the eastern Muslim 
world of Ismailian Shi'ite movements, 
heralding the imminent collapse of the ‘Ab- 
basid caliphate, an “empire of evil” found- 
ed on a “false religion”, made possible the 
existence of doctrines of the “ideal city”. 
The situation in the western Muslim world 
-was very different. Neither in al-Andalus 
nor in the Maghreb were there any objec- 
tive presuppositions allowing for the dream 
of a State based on any ideology other than 
that of the existing religious doctrine. 
This explains why the ideal situation for 
Ibn Bajja (died 1139), the first great Aris- 
totelian philosopher of these regions, is that 
of isolated individuals who, by way of intel- 
lectual and moral perfection, achieve 
happiness while continuing to live in an 
imperfect State. In exactly the same way, 
Ibn Tufayl (died 1185), an older contem- 
porary and friend of Ibn Rushd, thought 
that such a situation is the prerogative of 
individuals, but not of society as a whole. 
Finally Ibn Rushd himself explicitly stresses 
the futility of attempts to elaborate “ra- 
tionalized” forms of religion. 
Like his Eastern predecessors, Ibn Rushd 
considered it essential to interpret alleger- 
ically those passages in the Qur'an which 
contradict philosophical principles of 
understanding the world, but he favoured 
an even sharper dividing-line between the 
realm of knowledge and that of faith, be- 
tween science and religion. Al-Farabi toler- 
ated the activity of speculative theologians 
in the ideal State, while reducing the role of p

p theology to that of a servant of philosophy, 
28 
content to underpin the positions taken by 
the ruling philosophers. On the other hand 
Ibn Rushd, in his Commentary on Plato’s 
Republic, excludes theologians from the 
affairs of State. Moreover, he recommends 
that Muslim leaders should ban the works of 
theologians because they contain within 
them the seeds of dissidence, and may en- 
courage the appearance of all kinds of sects, 
which could plunge society into the abyss of 
civil war. 
The above remarks systematically con- 
tradict the idea, still too often put forward, 
that Arab philosophers were mere com- 
mentators, just capable of repeating, with 
greater or lesser degrees of success, the 
doctrines of their Greek masters from the 
Classical or Hellenistic periods. In fact, 
their relationship with the philosophical 
tradition of Antiquity was infinitely more 
selective, critical and creative. Arabic phi- 
losophy, as exemplified by Ibn Rushd and 
his Eastern predecessors, was a philosophy 
which responded to the demands of prog- 
ressive forces in “theologized” societies, 
which were qualitatively a far cry from the 
society of Antiquity. The ground was there- 
by preparcd for a philosophical thought 
freed from the grip of the Church—that of 
medieval Western Europe, the Renaissance 
and modern times. The legacy of the East- 
ern and Western traditions of the Muslim 
world thus blended into the creative philo- 
sophical thought of all mankind.

### 70471: Maimonides the humanist

Bical circumstances, and may thus overlook a 
much deeper dimension. It seldom happens 
that great thinkers radically overturn the 
categories of their time; instead they usually 
take such categories as their starting point 
and go on to open up new possibilities and 
directions for human thought and conduct 
to explore, so that giant strides forward may 
be made, untrammelled by the spider web 
of current ideas. This attitude of transcend- 
ing time, of standing poised at a turning 
point, distinguishes the great thinkers of the 
past. We would venture to suggest that 
Maimonides was undoubtedly one of the 
great medieval thinkers and one of those 
who most successfully broke new ground. 
While most of his fellow Jews saw a radi- 
cal opposition between the universe of their 
faith, the Torah or Law of Moses, and the 
universe of human knowledge, science and 
philosophy inherited from the Greeks, 
Maimonides was one of the masters of 
Judaic learning who clearly understood that 
such a dichotomy was spurious. In his view, 
the human sciences cannot be diametrically 
opposed to faith; instead, they must com- 
plement it and help to make it more pro- 
found. 
Ultimately, the contents of Aristotelian 
philosophy and those of the Jewish faith 
share the same essence. For Maimonides, 
the religious ideal is attainable only by 
someone who is capable of assimilating 
knowledge of both the human and the 
divine. Moses and Aristotle join hands to 
help humanity to the summit of perfection, 
namely the knowledge and love of God. We 
should remember that the society in which 
he lived, and especially his own Jewish com- 
munity, held a totally religious and God- 
centred view of the universe. Maimonides 
did not break with this position, but he insis- 
ted that room must be made for another, 
more specifically human, component: rea- 
son or philosophy. Few medieval thinkers 
did more than he to end the conflict 
between faith and reason. 
Maimonides’ rationalism is a facet of his 
humanism. To be a rationalist in the Middle 
Ages meant casting out ontological horror 
of the supernatural and the unknown, put- 
ting an end to irrational human fears, com- 
bating all kinds of alienation and refusing to 
accept any of the moral imperatives 
imposed on humanity by some arbitrary 
Will: in other words, it meant humanizing 
the faith of the believer, Medieval man was 
fundamentally a believer, as was Mai- 
monides. His efforts, however, were 
directed towards building a much more 
huinan universe, albeit still with God at its 
centre. Man, the being who aspires to a 
loving union with God, will attain this ulti- 
mate aim only by fully realizing his human 
potential, by leading a more worthy life and 
by casting outignorance in order to improve 
his conduct. 
Maimonides wished to help his contem- 
poraries to free themselves from their per- 
plexities, from all kinds of superstitions 
which enslaved them and even from the 
passions which dragged them down and pre- 
vented them from becoming fully human. 
To emphasize the rational aspect was not, 
as he saw it, to reject the theocentric pattern 
of his universe, but to readjust the focus on   
Twelfth century miniature depicting Mai- 
monides examining a flask of urine. As 
well as a philosopher and religious think- 
er, Moses ben Maymin was, like Ibn 
Rushd, one of the greatest physicians of 
his time, and in his numerous medical 
works (Commentary on the Aphorisms of 
Hippocrates, Compendium of the Books of 
Galen, Treatise on Asthma, Guide to Good 
Health ...) he summarized and developed 
contemporary knowledge in this field. 
reality so that everything was in its proper 
place. Man does not accede to divine love 
through false mysticism, on the paths of 
irrationality where he can disguise his igno- 
rance, but on the highroad to knowledge, 
wisdom and learning in the human sciences, 
complemented by theology. As man 
advances along this highroad, he must 
never renounce the use of his own intel- 
ligence or be lured away by the irrational 
and unknown. Likewise in the field of eth- 
ics, man is not the plaything of an arbitrary 
Supreme Being; the commandments con- 
tained in the Law of Moses all have a reason 
for their existence and are not obligations 
capriciously imposed on the human will. 
Maimonides thus constructed a style of 
humanism which was still religious, but 
which was primarily human. 
This humanism led him to combat the 
alienation of man and everything which 
diverted him from his true purpose in the 
universe. Maimonides opposed all kinds of 
idolatry, because he considered it to be one 
of the most dangerous forms of alienation: 
to worship the spheres, the stars or graven 
images, to become a slave to superstition, to 
believe in astrology or to practise any kind 
of primitive religious rites, prevents man 
from realizing his full potential. Even fever- 
ish involvement in an economic activity that 
is not necessary for the fulfilment of one’s 
own needs he regarded as another form of 
alienation, comparable to becoming a slave 
to the basest passions. For Maimonides, 
reason and knowledge represent true liber- 
ation for humanity.

The evil that exists in the universe is not 
the work of God, but the consequence of 
what some human beings do to others, or 
the harm that man does to himself. And 
nearly always, it is a consequence of ig- 
norance. Only knowledge, which for the 
human being is akin to the gift of sight, is 
capable of driving out enmity and hatred. 
Someone without knowledge is like a blind 
man stumbling against walls and blundering 
into other people. One of the evils that 
people can inflict on one another is tyranny. 
True knowledge is the necessary 
condition for the historical redemption of 
humanity. 
Such is Maimonides’ breadth of spirit that 
it transcends the narrow bounds of the 
majority of his fellow worshippers, and he 
thinks not so much in Jewish categories as in 
a new and universal dimension. The way to 
God is not reserved for the chosen people, 
but is open to all humankind. The great 
Greek philosophers had travelled far along 
the road to true knowledge, just as the 
promises in the Bible were made not only to 
Jewish people but to all humanity. 
Thus Maimonides remains loyal to the 
faith of his ancestors, but at the same tine 
he embraces all peoples with his genuinely 
universal outlook. Despite having suffered 
from it personally, he ncver gives way to the 
temptation of fanaticism. He believes that 
the other monotheistic religions have 
played a positive role in preparing the world 
for knowledge of the one true God and his 
Law. And although he sees all problems 
from the point of view of a devout Jew, his 
interpretation of the Law of Moses points 
the way towards better human understand- 
ing and a greater sense of the brotherhood 
of man. In this respect he was ahead of his 
time. 
Maimonides has been criticized for fail- 
ing to condemn slavery, for speaking con- 
temptuously of half-savage peoples and for 
taking a very negative view of women and 
their role in society. Itis true that he did not 
radically break out of the categories of his 
time on these issues, but he did succeed in 
pointing out new directions through his con- 
ception of human dignity. 
le saw the individual hidden behind the 
outward facade of the slave, he pleaded for 
the redemption of the oppressed through 
education and fairer working conditions, 
and he placed women on an equal spiritual 
footing with men. He did not break with the 
past, but endeavoured to change the system 
of values and the attitudes of his day in 
order to build a more truly humane society. 
FHerein, I believe, lies the source of his rele- 
vance to the present and his ability to influ- 
ence modern thought. n

### 70473: The Prophet, the scholar and the statesman

32 
  
The prophet, the scholar 
and the statesman 
by Roland Goetschel 
HE philosophy of Moses Mai- 
T monides lies at the convergence of 
Jewish and Arab-Islamic thought; 
this explains the considerable importance 
accorded to political activity in his thinking 
and practice. This article is an attempt to 
rediscover the coherence of this philosophy 
through a discussion of his major work, The 
Guide of the Perplexed. 
The need for political order. The starting 
point of Maimonides’ thought is the nature 
of man whom, like Aristotle, he considers 
to be naturally a political animal. While 
other living creatures can very well look 
after themselves without help from other 
members of their species, thisis not the case 
with the individual isolated human, who 
outside society would in the normal course 
of events be doomed to perish before very 
long. Man's food requirements alone neces- 
sitate the existence of an elaborate technol- 
ogy and a multiple division of labour, which 
would be inconceivable outside a political 
system: “This is why men need someone to 
guide and unite them, so that their society 
can be organized and perpetuated and so 
that they can give one another mutual assis- 
tance.” 
For Maimonides the need for govern- 
ment also emerges from the great diversity 
which exists between different members of 
the human species. There is need for a guide 
who can remedy what is defective and mod- 
erate what is excessive, who can impose a 
common and permanent law on the mem- 
bers of a society. 
He distinguishes three kinds of political 
regimes. First, conventional legal regimes 
in which the aim of the legislator is simply to 
ensure that the affairs of the community are 
transacted in an orderly fashion, without 
insisting on the improvement of man and his 
rational faculty. The regime of Divine Law 
is different in the sense that it is concerned 
not only with material and social improve- 
ment but also with man’s spiritual welfare, 
leading him to eternal happiness. There are 
also regimes which claim to be prophetic 
For Maimonides, “the regime of Divine 
Law ... is concerned not only with material 
and social improvement but also with 
man’s spiritual welfare” (R. Goetschel).

code which Moses, the great legislator, 
gave to the Jewish people during the Ex- 
odus) from the Ben Ezra synagogue, Fos-

and which have in fact borrowed all or part 
of their content from the true prophetic 
regime. 
The prophet, the scholar and the states- 
man. Although all men possess the faculty 
of governing, this faculty will not be fully 
developed unless a man has brought his 
rational and his imaginative faculties to a 
state of perfection. If such is the case, he 
will be able to become a prophet when a 
divine emanation flows first of all into his 
intellect, then into his imagination. If this 
divine influence flows only into the man’s 
intellect without being received by his imag- 
ination, he becomes a scholar who devotes 
himself to speculation. Conversely, if the 
divine emanation touches only his imagina- 
tion without influeneing his intellect, he will 
join the ranks of statesmen who make laws, 
or those of soothsayers or interpreters of 
omens. 
It is clear from the above that con- 
ventional legal regimes are set up by politi- 
cians who draw substance from their imag- 
ination alone, while the regime of Divine 
Law is based on a prophetic gift, necessitat- 
ing the two-fold perfection of the rational 
and the imaginative faculties. The true 
prophet combines the capacities of the pol- 
itician and the scholar, while surpassing 
them both. The influence working on his 
intellect brings him the speculative insights 
which enable him to grasp the essential 
nature of things and makes him a superior 
philosopher. 
The prophecy of Moses. The divine ema- 
nation sometimes comes to the prophet 
with a force sufficient for him to attain per- 
fection for himself, and sometimes with a 
superabundance that allows him to strive to 
transform others. There are many degrees 
of prophets as there are many degrees of 
scholars. Maimonides also makes a major 
distinction between Moses and the other 
prophets. All prophets except Moses 
received the prophecy through an angel, 
whereas to Moses God spoke directly. 
In hiscommentary on Chapter XXXII of 
the Book of Exodus, Maimonides returns to 
the subject of Moses as legislator. If God 
would not reveal his essence to Moses, he 
nevertheless made known to him the thir- 
teen attributes of God which allowed Moses 
to understand the nature of living beings 
and the links between them, thus teaching 
him how to govern over them, The ultimate 
aim of this revelation is therefore to estab- 
lish political order: “And that was the final 
aim of his demand, for he ended by saying: 
that I may know thee, that I may find favour 
in thy sight and consider that this nation is 
thy people, which I must govern by means 
similar to thine.” The ruler of the ideal city 
will therefore govern his State as far as pos- 
sible according to the model furnished by 
God as ruler of the world. 
The finality of the Divine Law. The object 
of the Law is to bring man to a full realiza- 
tion of both his spiritual and his bodily exis- 
tence. This is achieved by the institution of 
civil peace as well as through the individual 
acquisition of virtues useful to society. The 
Law of Moses therefore carries within it a 
two-fold perfection: it establishes a perfect 
community, and it produces in man right- 
eous ideas which will lead to happiness.

True human perfection is not found 
where it is commonly supposed. Most peo- 
ple think that perfection lies in assets which 
include the possession of power. As Mai- 
monides wrote, “the possession of the title 
of a great king belongs to this class.” But 
such perfection is external to the human 
essence, The two other perfections, that of 
the body and even moral perfection, are 
themselves only a means to intellectual per- 
fection, which reaches its highest degree in 
the knowledge of God. 
However, as Maimonides points out in a 
reference to The Book of Jeremiah, on the 
last page of the Guide, knowledge of God 
must not remain speculative, it should lead 
mankind to ensure that solidarity, law and 
justice prevail on earth. To know God is 
therefore to submit to ethical restraints, and 
this ultimate requirement should be the pri- 
ority of the ideal ruler, for he more than all 
other men created in the image of God must 
accomplish “the imitation of God™, the sov- 
ereign ruler of the universe. =

### 70479: 1986: Year of Peace, 9

1986: Year of Peace / 9 
In this article, Professor Jean Dausset 
(Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine, 
1980) highlights the benefits of bio- 
logical diversity, and stresses the 
unavoidable incompatibility between 
science and racism as an important fac- 
tor in efforts to establish peace. 
as rejection, is a widespread reflex. Chil- 
dren are afraid of being different from 
their peers. Adolescents are the first to follow 
fashions. But, much more seriously, adults are 
almost instinctively wary of all those who do not 
belong to their group or community; this leads to 
neighbourhood rivalry, argument between 
administrative bodies, conflict between nations, 
religious or racial hatred. 
This reflex is however both a biological ab- 
surdity and a basic error where cultural life is 
concerned. Three concepts from biclogy may 
help to clarify the issue: 
First, each living being is different, even 
unique, since there are so many possible varia- 
tions in its chemical composition. It is the product 
of a combinaticn of paternal and maternal 
characters, which themselves came from a mix- 
ture of the characters of four grandparents, 
Moreover, these characters, or genes, show 
multiple variations within populations. In man, 
the number of possible combinations exceeds, it 
has been said, the number of atoms in the known 
universe. In each generation new beings thus 
appear, fruits of the genetic lottery, unique 
because formed from an entirely new combina- 
tion of genetic characters. Nature has taken 
good care to ensure that this mixing happens at 
regular intervals: sexual reproduction and death 
repeat it for each generation. 
Second, according to Darwinian natural selec- 
tion, those individuals which fortuitously receive 
the combinations which render them best 
adapted to live in a certain environment, survive 
and produce most descendants, whereas the 
least well adapted produce fewer descendants. 
Thus, thanks to the diversity of the individuals of 
which it is composed, a species will be able to 
adapt to changes that may occur in the environ- 
ment or climate, or to the appearance of new 
parasites or pathogenic agents. Difference 
between individuals is thus an absolute neces- 
sity for the perpetuation of a species. Itis basic to 
all animal and plant life. 
F of difference, sometimes going so far 
Third, the environment shapes varieties within 
species: the North African swallow is not identi- 
cal to the Norwegian swallow; the Italian poplar 
differs from that of northern Europe; the Mediter- 
ranean human type is not the same as the Nordic 
type. The influence of the environment on mod- 
ern man is perhaps less than it was, but it 
remains a determining factor on his psychology. 
Two identical twins, who do not differ genetically, 
are subjected to different external influences, 
especially if they are separated, and thus 
become two different beings. Only man moves 
from individuality to personality, because only 
man appropriates a cultural heritage from his 
social environment. A 
It is thus clear that the uniqueness of each 
person confers on him or her an individual dignity 
which is an additional reascn, if any were neces- 
sary, for respecting that person; that this unique- 
ness should not make us forget that each person 
belongs to the great human family, which is also 
unique; that the concept of “racial purity” is 
totally meaningless, since all standardization 
leads to death. Thus, without losing its identity, a 
people must encourage the introduction of new 
genes from elsewhere. Finally, experience plays 
a paramount role in the mental and spiritual 
development of mankind. 
In the melting pot of Western Europe, a human 
community with a number of common genetic 
traits has developed. The relative isolation of the 
provinces over a long period, inter-village mar- 
riages, diversity of climate and origins have 
favoured differences which modern means of 
communication are tending to obliterate. 
These biclogical truths can easily be trans- 
posed by analogy to the cultural level. 
The diversity of living, authentic cultures, 
which were even more plentiful in the last cen- 
tury, is a treasure of inestimable value. The dis- 
appearance of a culture is an irreparable loss, 
comparable to the extinction of an animal or plant 
species. 
Each culture is characterized by its customs, 
its conception of the place of mankind in the 
universe, its beliefs. Each has its rituals, its 
modes of dress, each contributes to the incredi- 
ble range of plastic arts or architecture, music, 
song, dance and all the other manifestations of 
mankind's creative imagination. Each has given 
humanity scientific discoveries or new technol- 
ogies to ease the workload or relieve suffering. 
These ideas, these dances, these techniques 
are, as in the field of biology, the fruit of multiple 
interactions between man and his surroundings. 
This deep-seated adaptation of cultures to their 
environment was striking before the intrusion of 
western technology; it takes a long time for such 
a symbiosis to develop. 
Differences between cultures alone allow 
comparisons, the confrontation of ideas, ideol- 
ogies and aspirations. They allow concepts to be 
enlarged and enriched. They allow discoveries 
and technologies to spread through the whole 
body of humanity, in a word they allow evolution 
through the choice of the highest values. In this 
way, by stages, the cultural evolution of human- 
ity has progressed for thousands of years. No 
animal has profited like man from the experience 
of other groups; this is a unique feature of the 
history of the evolution of life. 
Diversity of cultures is thus a priceless trea- 
sure which must be jealously preserved. If diver- 
sity is to persist, cultures must remain alive, that 
is, be capable of evolving through contact with 
others. Folklore is fossilized culture. 
Most important of all, there should be harmo- 
nious co-existence between these diverse cul- 
tures, cohabitation accepted without discrimina- 
tion, without reservations, without preconceived 
ideas. The most pernicious of the latter is the 
establishment of a cultural hierarchy in which 
one's own culture is of course high on the list. 
Just as there is no hierarchy between men and 
women—they are simply different—so there is 
no hierarchy between cultures: they are for- 
tunately different. } oo 
We are today faced with two major risks: stan- 
dardization and intolerance. 
The standardization of cultures, as in biology, 
leads to the cessation of evolution, therefore to 
death. We already have a bitter foretaste of 
this. 
Intolerance, more than indifference, secretes 
internecine conflicts and leads ultimately 
through incomprehension and the closing of 
minds and frontiers, to the same result as stan- 
dardization: the end of evolution. 
Wisdom lies in open-mindedness, in listening 
to others, in a spirit of total equality. 
The French writer Antoine de Saint-Exupéry 
(1900-1944) magnificently encapsulated this 
mental attitude when he wrote, “If you are dif- 
ferent from me, brother, tar from harming me, 
you enrich me.” =

Just published... 
Much has happened to the notion of human rights 
since the Universal Declaration was proclaimed 
by the United Nations in 1948. Philosophical 
Foundations of Human Riglis, a collection of 
cssays prepared by Unesco and the International 
Institute of Philosophy, with an introduction by 
Paul Ricoeur, represents Uneseo’s contribution 
to the conviction that in this ficld there exist in 
different communities differing philosophical 
traditions that call for clear assessment. 
Eighteen authors from every geocultural region 
of the world examine the origins of the Declar- 
ation, Western perspectives on individual and 
collective rights, non-Western perspectives on 
human rights and human duties, and post-colo- 
nial perspectives, notably from Africa and Latin 
America, on rights in relation to unjust suffering. 
The analyses presented by Western contributors 
on enlarging the 17th- and 18th-century Curo- 
pcan and American philosophical base of both 
individual and social rights dovetail with the 
observations of non-Western thinkers who find in 
their own intellectual and spiritual traditions a 
foundation for reformulating many of these

Cordoba the splendid 
In 923 AD the Umayyad caliph of Cordoba *Abd al-Rahman began 
to build a “royal seat" for his court outside the city. Work on the new 
royal residence, named Madinat al-Zahra or city of the flower, was 
completed 50 years later by his successor al-Hakam II al-Mustansir. 
Sadly. the paiace-city fell into almost immediate decline, and by the 
12th century it already lay in ruins. Only in the present century have 
its edifices been partially excavated and restored. With the Great 
Mosque of Cordoba, Madinat al-Zahra illustrates the full flowering 
of the art of al-Andalus, in which a variety of Oriental and Greco- 
Roman influences blended into a style of great originality. Some idea 
of the splendour of this Cordoban Versailles can be gauged from this 
detail of the Salon Rico or Royal Palace (Dar al-Mulk), which was 
used as lodgings for visitors of royal stock.
