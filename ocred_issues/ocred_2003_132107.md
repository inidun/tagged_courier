UNESCO | the new Courier | October 2003 
| | all the social and natural crises we 
humans face, the water crisis is the one 
that lies at the heart of our survival 
and that of our planet earth.” So said UNESCO Director 
General Koichiro Matsuura on the occasion of the launch 
earlier this year of the World Water Development Report*, 
a comprehensive state-of-the-resource document jointly 
compiled by the 23 United Nations agencies, programmes 
and commissions dealing with water. 
Depending on factors like population growth and policy 
choices, between two and seven billion people, in as many 
as 60 countries, will face water scarcity by the middle of 
this century. And while 6,000 children are now killed each 
day by water-borne diseases, water quality will steadily 
worsen in the years ahead as a result of the two million tons 
of waste currently dumped into rivers and lakes every day. 
Presented on the eve of the third World Water Forum 
(Kyoto, Japan, March 2003), the World Water Development 
Report stigmatized the political inertia surrounding the 
looming crisis. Of all the targets set to improve water 
management by a long list of international conferences 
“hardly any,” says the report, “have been met.” 
UNESCO, which together with the UN Department of 
Economic and Social Affairs is leading system-wide efforts 
in this the International Year of Freshwater, sent a strong 
signal of its determination to help developing countries 
to strengthen their capacity to address critical water 
issues with the creation last March of the UNESCO-IHE 
Institute for Water Education in Delft, the Netherlands. 
Long established as a world-class scientific institution, 
the Institute will become the hub of a global network of 
UNESCO-related regional centres, UNESCO Chairs, networks 
and partnerships in water education and capacity building 
serving the Organization’s 190 member-States. 
Inform, educate, train professionals, build up capacity: 
It’s a question of survival.

Beating SARS 
virtually 
School-children and 
university students 
on mainland China 
and in Hong Kong 
continued their 
lessons online from 
their homes after 
schools were closed 
at the height of the 
SARS outbreak earlier 
this year. University 
teachers in Hong 
Kong were even able 
to administer exams 
online, allowing 
students to finish 
their semester 
despite the extreme 
disruption to classes 
caused by the 
epidemic. 
Less fortunate 
were some 500 
students from China, 
Taiwan, Hong Kong 
and Singapore who 
had enrolled in 
summer courses at 
the University of 
California in Berkley. 
The university told 
them not to come 
because it did not 
have the capacity 
to deal with the 
“labour intensive 
measures” that would 
  
be necessary if any 
summer students 
became ill and needed 
to be quarantined. 
Other US universities 
did not follow suit. 
UC Berkeley has since 
created a prevention 
and response plan to 
help the campus - 
and other institutions 
- cope with public 
health threats such as 
SARS. 
Vienna's "Mona Lisa of 
sculptures” stolen 
The Saliera, or ‘salt cellar’, a gold, 
enamel, ebony and wax sculpture 
by Italian Renaissance goldsmith, 
Benvenuto Cellini (1500-1571), 
was stolen from Vienna's Art 
History Museum in May this year. 
Valued at an estimated US$57 
million, the Saliera depicts two gold 
figures — a goddess representing 
Earth, and bearded Neptune, with 
his trident and shell. The salt was 
served in a miniature ship, and 
pepper in an ionic temple, on either 
side of the figures. Commissioned 
by King Francois I of France, the 
Saliera is arguably the most beautiful 
work produced by the Florentine 
master. It was later offered to 
Archduke Ferdinand of Austria. 
The Viennese authorities have asked 
Interpol to help recover the stolen 
masterpiece.

July 1, 2003, 
the International Convention on the 
Protection of the Rights of all Migrant 
Workers and Members of their Families came 
into force. Its main objective is to act as an 
instrument in the fight against violations 
of the human rights of migrants, one of the 
most vulnerable groups of any population, 
especially if they have no official papers. 
There are an estimated 175 million migrants, 
60 percent of them living in Europe and 
North America. Of the 22 countries so far 
to have ratified the Convention, most are 
countries of emigration. None of the major 
countries of immigration have ratified to 
date.

Play power 
A US research centre has 
succeeded in building a 
supercomputer by hooking 
70 Sony Playstation 2 game 
consoles together in a fast 
network. For a $50,000 
outlay, the unit delivers some 
500,000 million operations 
per second (or 0.5 teraflops). 
The world’s fastest computer, 
NEC’s Earth Simulator, can 
perform about 40 trillion 
operations per second (40 
teraflops), but cost more like 
$400 million. The Playstation- 
based supercomputer was built 
by the National Center for 
Supercomputing Applications 
(NCSA) at the University of 
Illinois (USA). It uses the 
so-called ‘open source’ Linux 
operating system, which is 
constantly being updated for 
free by the scientific community 
worldwide.   ©

Kissing Prince Charming 
goodbye 
Prince Charming is a myth, 
and “happy ever after” often 
is not. So say private girls’ 
schools in the US, which 
have declared “financial 
literacy” an educational 
priority. The aim is 
empowerment, says the 103- 
member National Coalition 
of Girls’ Schools, stressing 
that (American) women 
today earn 25 percent less 
than men, spend about one 
third of their lives alone and, 
too often, in poverty. 
The playing field will only 
be level, says the Coalition, 
when girls and women are 
able to control their 
financial destinies. 
To get there, 
students in Coalition 
schools are 
following courses 
that teach them 
about compound 
interest and credit 
card debt, retirement 
planning and refinancing 
mortgages. They're learning 
how to write a business plan 
or uncover the mysteries of 
stocks, bonds and mutual 
funds. 
“We’d rather give (girls) a 
heads-up earlier in life; make 
sure they understand that 
part of their responsibility is 
to be a player and not just 
a bystander” said Coalition 
Executive Director Whitney 
Ransome. “But it’s a seismic 
shift - bit by bit, school by 
school, almost girl by girl.”

Since 1970 there have been 30

entitled “Peace in Construction”* 
published by Rencontre Africaine 
Pour la Défense des Droits de 
U’Homme (RADDHO), a civil rights 
NGO based in Dakar (Senegal), 
set up in 1990. According to the 
report, 19 countries in sub- 
Saharan Africa are showing 
“warning signs” of a crisis, or are 
in the fragile process of rebuilding 
peace on this continent “ruined 
by wars.” West Africa remains

Africa takes second place, with 
seven countries identified as at 
risk, while Eastern and Southern 
Africa have only one “bad” 
example each. 
With Peace in Construction, 
RADDHO hopes to alert the 
international public to the 
risks of conflict and thus to 
encourage their prevention. The 
NGO is proposing to organize 
an international conference 
on the issue and recommends 
the adoption of a “Universal 
Declaration of Peace.”

Works of art must not 
be interfered with. But 
who says so? Two recent 
incidents have put this 
unwritten axiom into 
question. The Egyptian 
Museum in Berlin recently 
exhibited the famous 
polychrome bust of 
Nefertiti (1372 B.C.} with 
the “addition” of a naked 
bronze body, provoking 
widespread indignation. The 
Egyptian authorities have 
now asked for the work of 
art to be returned. 
And at the Modern Art 
Oxford museum (UK) 
Britpop brothers, Jake 
and Dinos Chapman have 
“rectified” a complete series 
of etchings by Francisco 
de Goya (1746-1828). The 
artists replaced the faces in 
the 83 prints of the Disasters 
of War series with the heads 
of clowns and animals. The 
edition the artists used was 
printed in 1937, from the 
original plates, at the height 
of the Spanish Civil war. 
The question these acts 
raise is, is it illegal for the 
owner of a work of art 
to deface it, even if for a 
limited period? There is 
no clear-cut answer. Some 
consider such actions as 
avant-garde art, others as 
straightforward vandalism.

### 132170: Talking to Abdelwahab Meddeb: sweeping our own backyard

  
This movement began with the 
anarchists in the 19th century. It 
was described by Dostoyevsky in 
The Possessed. It drew its followers 
from the ranks of the frustrated. 
The Italian writer Solmi showed 
that the typical revolutionary comes 
from semi-intellectual circles, often 
school teachers, in other words 
aspiring intellectuals, who lack what it takes to be recognised 
as such. In the same way, the Muslim terrorists recruit semi- 
literate people. Given the demographic circumstances and the 
spread of mediocre education, these semi-literates constitute 
an immense mass of people gnawed away by resentment. 
Many Muslims cannot bear the position of weakness that 
they have occupied since Bonaparte. Since the end of the 18th 
century, Islam has not found ways to face up to the Western 
hegemony. Many people currently feel so powerless in the 
face of the American hyper-power that sacrificial violence 
seems to them to be the only response. 
It is true that the form of radicalism that preaches takfir 
(excommunication) sprang from the first sect of Islam, 
the kharijites, beginning in the 7th century. It is also true that 
a debate began raging with the second generation of Muslims, 
often ending in armed clashes between literalists and 
allegorists, in other words those who held that the Koran has 
only one meaning and those who believed its message was 
ambivalent and therefore open to interpretation. However this 
debate is not unique to Islam, it runs through all religions. 
All systems generate a sickness, a malady. If Christians are 
doing better than others these days, it is because they have 
spent centuries denouncing the malady of Christianity. 
All that is new in the Western tradition after the Middle 
Ages has been built on the criticism of religion, against 
itself. Thinkers from Erasmus to Schopenhauer, including 
Voltaire, Nietzsche and Kierkegaard, have all denounced 
the evils of Christianity. They attacked both its driving force 
and its illusions. 
The problem is that in Islam, this kind of criticism has hardly 
even begun. Even enlightened Muslims cannot bear to have 
 
the metaphor of a malady applied to their beliefs, which is 9 
— 
why the title of my book in Arabic had to be changed (see 
box). However, since the terrorist attacks in Riyadh and 
Casablanca, this metaphor has started to appear, even among 
theologians. Of course, I am not saying that other religions 
do not also need to examine their conscience. But it is not 
my job to write about the malady of Judaism or Protestant 
Puritanism. I prefer to sweep my own backyard. 
This ideology originates from a combination of three 
things. For the first, you have to look at the text of the 
Koran itself. There is, for example, the infamous “verse 
of the sword” which gives the order to pursue and kill 
all polytheists. The fundamentalists argue that this verse 
cancels out all the nuances of tolerance found in the Koran. 
The second element refers to the literalist thinking that 
developed over the centuries, and which found a spectacular 
incarnation in Ibn Hanbal (780-855), the founder of one 
of the four schools of orthodox Islam. This theologian 
fought against the mu’tazilites, the rationalist current 
supported by the Baghdad authorities in the 9th century. 
He was imprisoned and persecuted for his hard-line beliefs. 
After his death, his disciples radicalized his thinking. For 
example, fundamentalists today, who claim to have their 
roots in Hanbalism, often evoke takfir, even though Ibn 
Hanbal challenged this notion.The second key figure in this 
traditionalist trend is the Hanbalist thinker Ibn Taymiyya 
(1263-1328). Within his monumental body of work is a little 
book entitled As-siyassa ash-Shar’ia (“Politics in the name 
of divine law”), which is like a bible for the fundamentalist. 
In his time, Ibn Taymiyya was criticized, even from within 
the Hanbalist school, and spent part of his life in prison. But 
today, he is a central reference point for fundamentalists.

The third pillar of fundamentalist ideology is a figure called 
Ibn Abd Al Wahhab, who called for a radical return to the 
most literal interpretation. Taking up the theory of Ibn 
Taymiyya, he refused any form of intercession between God 
and man. He was responsible for the disappearance of all the 
tombs of saints on the Arabian Peninsula and the destruction 
of the rites of popular Sufism, which were very rich from an 
anthropological point of view. The ideas of Abd Al Wahhab 
(1703-1792) were decried while he was alive, but later 
became the official doctrine of Saudi Arabia. 
They go back to Bonaparte’s expedition to Egypt, and 
the momentous encounter with the West. The people of 
the Middle East discovered that Europe was powerful and 
that henceforth they themselves would occupy a position of 
weakness. The first reaction, around 1830, was Muhammad 
Ali’s plan to modernize Egypt. The intellectual Rifaa Al- 
Tahtawi (1801-1874) represented this school of thought. He 
undertook the huge job of translating scientific manuals. In 
the politico-theological sphere, sheikhs Al-Afghani (1838- 
1897) and Muhammad Abduh (1849-1905) then created 
what we call the salafiyya, a form of fundamentalism, not to 
be confused with Muslim fundamentalism. 
Afghani and Abduh were defeated historically but their 
approach was wider. What were they searching for? They 
wanted to return to the foundations of Islam and adapt them 
so that Muslim societies could rebuild themselves, taking 
Western contributions into account, particularly democracy 
and parliamentary government. Their plan was to use these 
concepts to fight against the hold of colonialism and local 
despotism. In fact, they used to meet in a cafe in Cairo called 
Al-Barlaman (the Parliament). 
It was a gradual process. Rashid Ridha (1865-1935) 
served as an intermediary link in the ancestry of this form of 
fundamentalism. He began by taking up the ideas of Abduh 
and criticising Wahhabism, making a name for himself in 
the early 20th century, and eventually taking power on the 
Arabian Peninsula in 1932. But towards the end of his life, 
Ridha changed his opinions and wrote a text supporting 
Wahhabism, which was not as opportunist as it sounds. 
He pointed to the evolution of man at a time of colonial 
conquest which sparked the rise of anti-Western feeling. 
Yes, with Rashid Ridha’s pupil, Hassan Al-Banna 
(1906-1949), who remains famous for creating the Muslim 
Brotherhood (Al-Ikhwan Al-Muslimun) in Egypt in 1928.

Next came a virulent wave of anti-Western sentiment, 
with democracy portrayed as trickery and an ideology of 
domination. If democracy existed, Hassan Al-Banna asked, 
how could there be colonialism? He concluded that Muslim 
countries do not need the West but instead need to renew 
their political systems in their own way. You could say that 
there was a move from a watchword of modernizing Islam 
to another, which preaches an Islamization of modernity. 
For example, instead of defending the parliamentary system, 
we turn to the Koran and substitute the word choura for 
the word barlaman. But choura has nothing to do with 
parliamentarianism. It is not founded on elections or 
equality, but is simply a matter of consultation, to guide the 
prince in making decisions. 
At first, the Muslim Brotherhood experienced repression, 
nationalist tyranny and the emergence of the post-colonial 
totalitarian State. Despotism has traditionally taken place 
where there is little State intervention. But in an age of 
technical progress, all Arab countries have moved towards 
maximum state intervention. The model of the party-State 
has triumphed. And the fundamentalists have gained ground 
as this model has reached its limits. They benefited from

the failure of Arab nationalism, the defeat by Israel in 1967, 
the failure to develop and from the elimination of any form 
of political expression. The rise in power of the Saudi rulers 
after the 1973 oil crisis added a new element. Petrodollars 
helped the spectacular spread of a hard-line form of Islam, 
founded on a single orthopraxy: the strict observance of 
prayer became the basis of social censure and wiped out 
local practices in favour of a uniform Islam. 
The end of Nasserism and the arrival in power of Sadat 
in Egypt saw a migration of semi-literate Egyptians to Saudi 
Arabia, where the Muslim Brotherhood had married their 
ideas with those of Wahhabism. Then there was a second, 
explosive, encounter in Afghanistan. Egyptians, Saudis and 
Pakistanis joined together in the jihad, orchestrated and 
supervised by the United States to fight against the Soviet 
invasion. You know what happened next. 
Today, the Muslim world is in a state of civil war. But 
internal criticism is growing. The French revolution of 1789 
was preceded by two centuries of intellectual effort. Faced 
with violence, critical thought is spreading, particularly in the

Shi’ite world. In Iran, the concept of vilayat e-fagih introduced 
by Khomenei has been criticised by theologians. In Iraq, the 
idea of spiritual caliphate, which presupposes a separation of 
religion from politics, seems to be gaining ground among the 
Shi’ite majority. As for Saudi Arabia, if it does not want to 
implode it must resolve the contradiction between its religious 
discourse, which leads to anti-Western sentiment, and its geo- 
political alliance with the United States. 
Since the 1970s, a diffuse fundamentalism has developed 
in Arab-Muslim societies. But that may be beginning to ebb 
away. The terrorist attacks in several Muslim countries have 
shocked the public. The challenge now is to separate Islam 
from Islamism. We must make sure that Islam plays a role in 
the war against fundamentalism.

DISCRIMINATION FOR INSURANCE

environment). The whole system depends on the 
good faith of the contracting parties. If a large 
number of people ask for life insurance because 
they have found out that they have a higher 
than normal risk of getting cancer, it skews the 
mechanism. Insurance companies fear these 
‘fraudulent’ clients, but they are not at their 
mercy. They can try to prove that the insured 
person cheated by neglecting to inform them of 
his or her condition. 
The balance can also be tilted in the other 
direction, posing a different threat. Insurance 
companies can be tempted to use the increase in 
genetic testing to their own advantage. Without 
going as far as to impose the tests on their clients, 
they can persuade them to get tested by offering 
lower rates. We could then end up with two-or 
even three-speed insurance: clients at risk (those 
with a known predisposition to a serious disease 
or refusing to take the test) who would pay the 
highest premium, and clients lucky enough to 
draw a winning number in the genetic lottery who 
would get the best rates.

to giving cells or tissues, they considered 
themselves free to use them in their research. But 
the problem is more crucial today. Using human 
cells or tissues, or by analysing data derived from 
them, hundreds of biotechnological companies 
are competing in the race to produce all kinds of 
  
tests or treatments. Millions of dollars are at stake, 
which explains the multiplication of the number 
of genetic data banks. This is a market that can 
only expand so it would be advisable to establish 
more precise rules. 
Send us some of your saliva, you’ll be helping 
science and we’ll give you shares in our 
company! This intriguing message circulated 
on the internet. A company based in Brussels 
“(Belgium ), called Spitters, planned to create a 
genetic data bank available to both state and 
private researchers. Its earnings would come 
from the pharmaceutical industry that would 
have to pay for access to the data collected. 
The DNA would come from millions of samples 
of saliva the company hoped to stock. The 
“donors” who wanted to receive shares in 
the company also had to fill out a medical 
questionnaire via the internet. The company 
guaranteed anonymity. The start-up failed, as 
did the corporation behind it, Starlab NV/SA. 
After it filed for bankruptcy, 500 saliva samples 
were put up for auction, along with the office 
furniture, although the sale never took place. 
SAMPLES 
They are often insignificant: a drop of blood, a 
smear on a coffee cup, a paper napkin left on a 
table, a cigarette butt, wax scraped from a hearing 
aid etc. But in the hands of a laboratory, these 
little scraps are sufficient to draw up a DNA code. 
UNESCO | the new Courier | October 2003 
Police searching for evidence obviously appreciate 
the benefits. The situation is more troubling, 
however, when you can find ads on the internet 
for genetic tests, notably paternity tests, which are 
carried out in dubious conditions. When certain 
laboratories guarantee anonymity, they mean for 
the person who supplied the sample, but not the 
person from whom the sample was actually taken. 
That person has not given his consent, and his 
anonymity is at risk. The problem is serious when 
we consider that when someone is trying to find 
their biological father, their real aim is often a 
legal one. 
CONSENT 
Spitter and Starlab had everything going for 
them. Well-known scientists were involved and 
the companies, though unusual, could prove 
their reliability. Yet people who gave samples 
of saliva thinking they were contributing to 
scientific research came close to seeing their 
‘donation’ sold at auction, possibly to be used to 
a completely different end. The case illustrates the 
problem concerning the link between consent and 
ultimate objectives. 
If someone agrees that genetic data from his or 
her sample can be used for a certain purpose, it 
is disturbing to see the data being put to another 
use unless he or she has again been asked for 
consent. The issue is rarely raised, but a lot of 
genetic data collected for a specific temporary 
use are later ‘recycled’ for other purposes. 
When a husband gives a sperm sample to help 
police investigate his wife’s rape, he believes that 
the sample, once it has been used in a process 
of elimination in order to isolate the sperm of 
the rapist, will be destroyed, along with the 
genetic data extracted from it. In many cases, 
he is wrong: the data end up in police files 
where samples from suspects, innocent people 
and even victims, are stored together, if only 
for simplicity’s sake. To take another example, 
when a fireman, knowing he could die in the line 
of duty, gives a blood sample to help with the 
identification of his remains and spare his family 
further suffering, he does not know that the 
companies running the DNA banks sometimes 
sell data to laboratories.

Lenny was different,” remembers Gillian Cambers, 
a beach erosion specialist who lives in Puerto 
Rico. “It started off the coast of Colombia in 
the western Caribbean, and instead of moving 
north or west, as the forecasters predicted, began 
moving east. It got stronger as it went, building 
up bigger and bigger waves.” In a couple of days 
in mid-November 1999 it had caused physical 
damage to the islands estimated at around US$269 
million, without counting loss of revenue. For 
Grenada alone, one of the worst hit, the damage 
was over US$94 million, or 27 percent of its GDP?. 
“No warnings had been given, no boats had 
been pulled up,” recalls Cambers. “And, strangest

of all for many islanders, there was no wind. It 
was the waves that wreaked havoc. Most of the 
tourism infrastructure is concentrated on the west 
coasts of the Caribbean islands, because they are 
sheltered from the prevailing easterly winds. But 
they were not sheltered from Hurricane Lenny. 
Houses disappeared, hotels and roads were 
damaged and flooded, fishing boats were lost, 
and the west coast beaches in every island in 
the chain from Tobago in the south to the Virgin 
Islands in the north were eroded, just one month 
before the start of the tourism high season. The 
economic impact was huge. Hotels had to close 
for months, in some cases more than a year, to try 
to repair the damage and put back their beaches.” 
Lenny caught the islanders out, but they are 
used to hurricanes. In the Caribbean, there is a 
hurricane ‘season’ that runs roughly from June 
to November. And, before tourism became a 
significant money-earner, experience led islanders

to build either inland, or a reasonable distance 
from the coast. “Lenny didn’t do much to the 
inland infrastructure,” says Arlington James, of 
Dominica’s Forestry, Wildlife and Parks Division, 
“but the waves from Lenny did affect the coast. 
Some beaches were only just recovering from 
tropical storm Iris, Hurricane Marilyn and then 
Hurricane Luis that hit us in the space of two 
weeks in 1995. And before that, we’d been hit by 
Hurricane Hugo in 1989. Belle Hall, a very wide 
and popular beach up north is now just a strip of 
boulders.” 
PREVENTION IS CHEAPER 
THAN REPAIR 
| 1 | But Dominica has little tourism, unlike most other 
Caribbean islands. And tourism often means 
beachside hotels and refreshment stalls. When 
8 a beach disappears after a hurricane, not only 
is the main tourist attraction lost, but ill-placed 
hotels, roads, water supplies and shops often go 
with it. And, increasingly, some islands depend 
on tourism. In 2000, for example, visitors spent 
some $277 million in Saint Lucia, accounting for 
over 40 percent of its Gross National Product.? Yet 
much of the damage could be avoided. “People 
often feel they must build right on the beach, and 
it is hard for planning authorities to convince 
them otherwise,” explains Gillian Cambers. “But 
beaches are dynamic features, always moving 
and changing shape. We draw a line on a map, 
a solid, permanent line, and this represents the 
coastline. In fact, the coastline, or the area where 
the sea meets the land, is a moving zone, varying 
in position according to the tides, waves and 
storm conditions, the time of year, sediment and 
other factors.” 
“By allowing beaches the space to move, there 
is a good likelihood that they will be conserved 
in the long term,” she adds. Instead, out of 
ignorance, or an attitude of ‘it won’t happen here’, 
developers still build too close to the water. And 
in often-misguided efforts to protect the beach or 
the infrastructure, they, or local municipalities, 
build protective sea walls or erect groynes into 
the sea to lessen the impact of waves. But both 
measures are often counterproductive. Sea walls 
invariably increase beach erosion, while sand 
tends to build up on one side of a groyne and 
disappear on the other. 
“Beach erosion is very complex,” says Gillian 
Cambers. “And, while every beach is different, 
there is also no single erosion mitigation method

that works everywhere.” A UNESCO project 
monitoring changes in beaches over time® has 
shown that, over a ten-year period, two-thirds 
of the beaches monitored showed erosion, while 
the remaining third were either building up or 
showed no change. This uniqueness of beaches 
and preventive measures is one reason UNESCO 
has been working with ten island authorities in 
the Caribbean to produce a series of tailor-made 
brochures aimed to raise awareness and to give 
very specific guidance on building precautions on 
a beach-by-beach basis. 
“We use the brochures with our students, non 
governmental organizations and environment 
groups,” says Benjie Farrell, of the Environment 
Department, St Kitts. 
“Most of our population are familiar with the 
issues, but we still need to emphasise attitude 
change in the coastal zone.” And, to prove his 
point, he says that, in a recent development, 
“twenty acres of harbour were reclaimed from 
the sea, and filled in with boulders. Now it’s a 
shopping mall. It’s affecting the wave patterns 
in the area and these are affecting the adjacent 
beaches.” And the added irony of this is that 
offshore sand is often used to make the concrete 
for the buildings. But, in time, they will probably 
all return to the sea - and end up as beaches 
again.

world population (some 
1,147 million people) live 
within 30 km of the nearest 
coastline. In small island 
developing states, like 
the Seychelles, and some 
Caribbean islands, this 
figure can be more like 90 
percent. The coastal zone 
has the highest diversity of 
plant and animal species 
and many small islands are 
almost entirely dependent 
on their coastal resources 
(e.g. fishing, tourism, etc).

under threat from various 
aggressions, such as sea 
level rise as a result of global 
warming, destruction of 
protective coral reefs and 
mangrove forests (which 
act as natural wave-breaks),

and being replenished. They 
absorb the shock of large 
waves and storms and, 
unimpeded, can ‘retreat’ 
inland, reverting to their 
earlier position months 
or years later. But solid 
structures, like roads, sea 
walls and the foundations 
of buildings, when too 
close to the beach, prevent 
this natural process and 
inevitably lead to erosion. 
In some African states, like 
Nigeria, parts of the coastline 
are disappearing at as much 
as 20-30 metres a year.

protective barrier against 
waves. When dunes are

picket fences to trap sand. 
But these take time to work.

can be replenished artificially

### 132173: World heritage: the new jewels

World Heritage List now numbers 
The 754 sites of “outstanding universal 
value”, including 582 cultural, 149 natural and 
23 mixed sites. 
Five natural sites were added to the List at 
the latest session (June 30-July 3) of the World 
Heritage Committee: Purnululu National Park 
(Australia), Three Parallel Rivers of Yunnan 
Protected Areas (China), Uvs Nuur Basin 
(Russian Federation / Mongolia), Monte San 
Giorgio (Switzerland), and Phong Nha - Ke 
Bang National Park (Vietnam). Nineteen new 
cultural sites also received the “world heritage” 
label this year: the cultural landscape and 
archaeological remains of the Bamiyan Valley 
(Afghanistan), Quebrada de Humahuaca 
(Argentina), Historic Quarter of the Seaport City 
of Valparaiso (Chile), Jewish Quarter and St 
Procopius’ Basilica in Trebic (Czech Republic), 
James Island and Related Sites (Gambia), 
Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka (India), Takht-e 
Soleyman (Iran), Ashur/Quala’at at Shergat 
(Iraq), the White City of Tel-Aviv —- the Modern 
Movement (Israel), Sacri Monti of Piedmont 
and Lombardy (Italy), the Mausoleum of 
Khoja Ahmed Yasawi (Kazakhstan), Franciscan 
Missions in the Sierra Gorda of Querétaro 
(Mexico), Wooden Churches of Southern 
Little Poland (Poland), Citadel, Ancient City 
and Fortress Buildings of Derbent (Russian 
Federation), Mapungubwe Cultural Landscape 
(South Africa), Renaissance Monumental 
Ensembles of Ubeda and Baeza (Spain), Gebel 
Barkal and the Sites of the Napatan Region 
(Sudan), Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew (United 
Kingdom); Matobo Hills (Zimbabwe). 
IN HONOUR OF BAMIYAN 
The chilling images of the Buddhas of Bamiyan 
exploding in March 2001 are still fresh in our 
minds. Two years on, the cultural landscape and 
archaeological remains of the Bamiyan Valley 
have become part of the heritage of humanity, 
symbolizing the international community’s hope 
that intolerance will never again lead to such 
crimes against culture. 
Located in Afghanistan some 250 km west 
of Kabul, the site showcases the artistic and 
religious developments which characterized 
ancient Bakhtria from the 1% to the 13" centuries. 
© UNESCO 
In the first centuries of our era, the artistic 
expression of Gandhara Buddhist art was born 
of the meeting of Greco-Roman, Indian and 
Parthian influences. For the first time, sculptors 
carved the Buddha in human form. From the 8™ 
century, Islam spread through the Bamiyan Valley, 
gradually replacing Buddhism. The presence of 
Buddhist monasteries and sanctuaries alongside 
ancient fortified edifices from the Islamic period 
reflect this legacy. 
Because of its vulnerability, the site was 
simultaneously inscribed on the World Heritage 
List and on the World Heritage List in Danger. 
Abandoned for many years, it has been the 
target of military action, and antipersonnel 
mines have rendered parts of the valley 
inaccessible. The niches containing fragments of 
the decimated statues are at risk of collapsing. 
The explosions opened cracks in the cliff and 
destroyed mural decorations. The paintings 
adorning some of the 600 caves hewn in 
sandstone are also in poor condition. Finally, 
the battle against looting and illicit excavation 
is far from being won. 
ASHUR, CRADLE OF THE 
ASSYRIAN EMPIRE 
The ancient city of Ashur (Qala’at at Shergat) 
stands on the shores of the Tigris River, in the 
Iraqi part of northern Mesopotamia. Founded by 
the Sumerians in the 3" millennium BC, the city 
was progressively occupied by the Assyrians, 
who appear to have left their nomadic lifestyle to 
settle there. In the 2° millennium BC, it became 
the first capital of the Assyrian empire, eventually 
stretching over a territory of a size unprecedented 
in the Middle East.

A city-state and trading crossroads, the city is 
also the religious capital of the empire, associated 
with the god Ashur. Over the centuries, all 
of Assyria identified with this universal god, 
creator of paradise and the underworld. The city, 
destroyed by the Babylonians in 612 BC, rose 
from its ashes in the Parthian period in the 1% and 
21d centuries AD. 
Ashur has kept many traces of its glorious past, 
including the ziggurat - a colossal temple-tower; 
the great temple of the god Ashur; the double 
temple of Ashur and Adad, the storm god; the 
temple of Ishtar, Sumerian goddess of love and 
war; the old palace with its royal tombs and 
several residential districts. 
When Ashur was proposed for inscription, 
before the war, the property was threatened by 
a project to build a large dam that would have 
partially flooded it. Although the project has been 
suspended by the current administration, there is 
always risk of a turnaround. 
This threat, compounded by a crying lack of 
protection, lay behind the site’s simultaneous 
inscription on the World Heritage List in Danger. 
According to observers who recently visited 
Ashur, the 20-odd guards in charge of supervising 
the roughly 65-hectare site no longer have arms 
and fear attacks by looters, who have proved very 
active on many other Iraqi sites.

KEW, PARADISE WITH 
A PURPOSE 
Of a weekend Londoners flock to the immaculate 
lawns and treelined walks of the Royal Botanic 
Gardens, Kew, outside London, to picnic, stroll 
and admire the exceptional vegetation — Chinese 
rhododendrons, tropical palm trees and an infinite 
variety of flowers. Their itinerary includes two 
further landmarks: the Chinese pagoda and a 
stunning Victorian glass house. 
Herein undoubtedly lies the secret of Kew’s 
reputation: since their creation in 1759, these 
gardens have allied charm and elegance with 
scientific excellence. Inscription on the World 
Heritage List was justified on both counts. The 
gardens harbour botanic collections (conserved 
plants, living plants and documents), which 
have been considerably enriched through the 
centuries. They have made a significant and 
uninterrupted contribution to the study of plant 
diversity and botanic economics. As the World 
Conservation Union states, Kew is no ordinary 
garden because “it has truly blazed a trail by 
creating a world movement in favour of flora 
Its scientific work has had “a 
formidable cultural effect” because the botanical 
knowledge and skills acquired at Kew have been 
spread throughout the world. More recently, Kew 
set up the largest seed bank in the world. Located

VALPARAISO, A LEGENDARY PORT 
Visitors rarely fall in love with Valparaiso at first 
site. The legislative capital of Chile (300,000 
inhabitants), also the country’s largest port, does 
not immediately reveal the magic that turned 
the city into a myth once sung by sailors from 
near and far. By inscribing the Historic Quarter 
of the Seaport City of Valparaiso on the World 
Heritage List, the Committee sought to honour 
this legendary port. 
The perimeter that was inscribed, located 
between the sea and the first line of hills, presents 
an interesting example of late 19'" century 
architecture and town-planning in Latin America. 
  
The Valparaiso port was founded by the Spaniards 
in the 16™ century on a narrow coastal plain then 
occupied by Chango Indians. Stretching along a 
natural bay on the Pacific coast that is shaped like 
an amphitheatre, the city expanded by climbing 
up the hillside. 
The port flourished in the 19" century, 
  
becoming a vital halt for sailors travelling from 
Europe to the west coast of the United States. 
      Before the construction of the Panama Canal in   the early 20™ century, ships were obliged to circle 
Cape Horn and travel up the Pacific coast. It was a 
perilous journey, which often ended in shipwreck   and death. Only the most fortunate set foot in 
Valparaiso, the first port on their route. The 
city’s legend has been woven with the dreams of  
sailors: of surviving and finding amusement in the © unesco 
alleys and taverns of the port city. 
Today the historic quarter has kept an attractive For European

THE LOST WORLD OF BUNGLE 
BUNGLE 
Located in the state of Western Australia, 
Purnululu National Park (239,723 hectares) 
harbours the rugged, beehive shaped Bungle 
Bungle mountain range, a prized destination 
for lovers of nature and wild spaces. The name 
probably stems from the Aborigine word “bundle 
bundle”, which designates a common local grass. 
“Purnululu” means “piles of sand” in the same 
language. These sandstone mounds formed 
over 350 million years ago make the region 
of Kimberley — one of the most remote in the 
country - so distinctive. 
Rivers and streams flowing from mountains 
in the south and east carried a mixture of sand 
and boulders that gradually consolidated to form 
sandstone. Uplift and erosion during the last 20 
million years created the deep gorges, spectacular 
towers, steep beehive-shaped cones and a surface 
marked by regular horizontal bands of silica and 
lichen. 
The park, inhabited by indigenous populations 
for over 20,000 years, is rich in Aboriginal art 
and harbours several burial sites. There are also 
numerous plant species of which some were 
discovered so recently they have not yet been 
given scientific names. Surprising fan palm 
trees grip precariously to walls and crevices in 
the rocks. The rest of the park is covered by a 
blanket of red and yellow sand where a wide 
array of trees and shrubs grow. Bird lovers can 
also observe over 130 species, including flocks of 
vividly coloured budgerigars.

Aung San Suu Kyi on May 30 the government had 
simply closed the University of Myanmar, in order

This surprise attack left 50 students injured,

Professors are also targeted. In March this year, 
an Egyptian court finally acquitted Dr. Saad Eddin 
Ibrahim, a human rights activist and professor 
of sociology at the American University in Cairo. 
In May 2001 he had been sentenced to seven 
years in prison on charges of illegal financing and 
divulging false information abroad. 
All these cases, and many others like it, have 
been recorded by NEAR (Network for Education 
and Academic Rights) and can be found on 
their website (www.nearinternational.org). 
This monitoring network, set up in 2001 with 
assistance from UNESCO, brings together over 
40 NGOs involved in the fight for academic 
freedom. Using information that appears in the 
press or which is collected on the ground by 
the member organizations, it sounds the alarm 
when necessary. The aim is to draw attention 
to countries that abuse academic freedoms 
affecting both teachers and students and ranging 
from interference with freedom of speech to 
imprisonment and disappearances. 
DEFENDING THE RIGHTS 
OF TEACHERS 
While there are no specific texts on the rights 
of students, professors can refer to the UNESCO 
Recommendations of 1997 on the status of 
teachers in higher education (see box p. 28). This 
text stresses that teachers must be able to enjoy 
the freedom to teach and to discuss, to carry out 
research and to publish the results. And they must 
also be allowed to freely express their opinions 
about the institution for which they work. 
“These are very important points because a 
teacher or a university must be able to question 
what is accepted and known about a certain era. 
The progress of knowledge answers to a higher 
calling than the interests of the State,” says 
Andris Barblan, special advisor to the European 
University of Geneva.

Academic freedom 
was high on the agenda 
of the World Conference 
on Higher Education + 
b, which took place at 
UNESCO headquarters 
last June 23-25. More than 
400 participants from 120 
countries attended the 
conference, which took 
stock of progress made 
towards the goals set at the 
World Conference on Higher 
Education held in Paris in 
1998. 
All agreed that at no 
time in human history 
has the welfare of nations 
depended so directly on the 
quality and outreach of their 
higher education systems 
and institutions, and that, 
to a large extent, the quality 
and outreach required 
could only be achieved if 
academic freedom - of both 
staff and students - was 
respected. 
“The changes sweeping 
through higher education 
may, in some circumstances, 
threaten the very practice 
of academic freedom, 
university autonomy, 
and the independence of 
research,” warned UNESCO 
Director-General Koichiro 
Matsuura in his opening 
speech. “And please note 
that, while these principles 
and values are important in 
their own right, there may 
be other considerations 
to bear in mind too. For 
example, curtailments of 
academic freedom may 
induce brain drain or cause 
an exodus from certain 
fields of inquiry.” 
fie

However, many countries pay these freedoms 
lip service only. Since the start of the year, NEAR 
has recorded 37 cases of violations. The figures 
show a slight increase on previous years. “But 
that is probably because the network is better 
established and more cases are being reported,” 
says John Akker, NEAR’s Executive Director. 
“All these examples show that many regimes 
still consider universities as potential centres of 
unrest,” he adds. 
This is especially the case in Africa, where 
controls over the content of the syllabus.” 
There are also less direct methods of repressing 
lecturers whose opinions are considered too 
‘independent’. Lectures can be cancelled 
arbitrarily, promotions can be systematically 
refused and staff excluded from decision-making 
UNESCO | the new Courier | October 2003 
pressure is often put on teachers and students. 
“Most countries do this,” says Adebayo Olukoshi, 
the Executive Secretary of the Council for the 
Development of Social Science Research in Africa 
(CODESRIA). “It is easier to gag the press than 
teachers and students. Universities therefore 
often seem to be the last bastion of freedom of 
expression, which is why they are so closely 
observed. In extreme cases, this can even go as 
far as teachers being detained or extremely strict

. ) “Higher-education teaching personnel 
should not be forced to instruct against their 
own best knowledge and conscience,” states 
the UNESCO Recommendation Concerning 
the Status of Higher-Education Teaching 
Personnel, adopted in 1997". In its articles 
25 to 32, the Recommendation gives a fairly 
broad definition of academic freedom. Higher- 
education personnel, it says, “should enjoy those 
internationally recognized civil, political, social 
and cultural rights applicable to all citizens.” 
D But it also recognizes rights specific 
to the profession. These include the freedom 
to teach “without any interference,” to carry 
out research and to publish the results, 
freedom from institutional censorship and 
the “freedom to participate in professional or 
representative academic bodies.” The UNESCO 
Recommendation also recognizes the freedom 
“to express freely their opinion about the 
institution or system in which they work.” All 
higher-education teaching personnel, it says, 
“should have the right to fulfil their functions 
without discrimination of any kind and without 
fear of repression by the state or any other 
source.” In cases “of gross violation of their 
rights,” the text goes on, “higher-education 
teaching personnel should have the right to 
appeal to the relevant national, regional or 
international bodies such as the agencies of the 
United Nations, and organizations representing 
higher-education teaching personnel should 
extend full support in such cases.”

Cairo, January 2001 - Egyptian -US 
human rights activist Saad Eddin 
Ibrahim (left) speaks to one of his 
lawyers at Cairo’s High Court 
bodies. On a continent where universities 
are financed mainly from public funds, 
money is another effective way of applying 
pressure. “Reducing a university’s funding 
by 25 percent is enough to prevent it from 
functioning normally,” explains Olukoshi. 
This is all the more true when the position of 
teachers, whose salaries — when they are paid 
at all - rarely exceed $500 a month, is already 
precarious enough. 
MONEY TALKS 
Universities in industralized countries can 
face a completely different kind of pressure. 
Private companies increasingly play a role on 
campus, financing at least part of the applied 
research. In November 1998, for example, the 
University of California at Berkeley (USA), 
struck a $25m deal with the Swiss company 
Novartis. Under the alliance, the university’s 
department of Plant and Microbial Biology 
receives grants of $5m annually for five years. 
In exchange, the Swiss pharmaceuticals giant 
obtained the rights to patent discoveries 
made by the department’s researchers. Such 
agreements contribute to financing research 
and, according to the University, Novartis 
was selected as a partner “because of the 
company’s interest in safeguarding academic 
freedom”. But the aims of the companies are 
not always compatible with a university’s 
mission. “Some big companies understand 
that free research must be supported,” says 
Barblan. “But that is certainly not true in 
every case.” Students working within the 
university, but financed by private companies 
can face conflicts of loyalty. Former French 
education minister Claude Allegre! observed 
this during a visit to the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology in Boston (USA): 
“In the same research laboratory a student 
financed by a company, a pharmaceuticals 
group for example, can be working alongside a 
student financed by a rival company,” he said. 
“And they are not allowed to discuss their 
work even if (and especially if) their research 
touches on the same subjects.” Says Andris 
Barblan, “In situations like this, academic 
freedom is undeniably affected.”

### 132177: From information society to knowledge societies

  
history education has been constrained within 
an eternal triangle of quality, access and cost. 
With conventional methods quality tends to go 
down when you increase access or cut costs. 
Open universities demonstrate that you can have 
wider access, higher quality and lower costs — all 
at the same time.” Distance education is less 
expensive than traditional education, explains 
Daniel, as shown in a study commissioned by the 
government of the United Kingdom, which reveals 
that the total cost of a degree at the UK Open 
University was between 60 and 80 percent of the 
cost of a traditional degree. 
ICT — WHAT FOR? 
But ICTs has still had little impact on primary 
and secondary education, especially in developing 
countries. It can be argued that the existence 
of 862 million illiterate people in the world and 
211 million child labourers belies the very notion 
of an information society. They are not players in 
the knowledge-based post-industrial era. 
The development of satellite connections and 
broadband (fast internet connections) in the South, 
and the creation of multimedia centres providing 
communities with access to connected computers, 
are two indispensable conditions to expand the 
reach of the new technologies and the knowledge 
they can disseminate. But this is not enough.

ICT, especially internet, is a two-way vehicle, 
optimally providing a platform for expression as 
well as access to information. And freedom of 
expression is essential if the internet is to serve 
individuals and communities. As people seek 
answers to their problems, they must be free to 
express their views and share their experiences 
without fearing reprisals for voicing opinions or 
making observations that are not in line with the 
official representation of facts concerning social, 
economic, political, sanitary or cultural issues. 
Amidst concerns for security, notably the 
fight against terrorism, and respect for national 
legislation - paedophilia, drug trafficking and hate 
speech - professional journalist organizations 
such as the International Federation of Journalists 
and the World Association of Newspapers warn 
that freedom of expression, a human right 
enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights, must be respected. UNESCO supports 
this view, arguing that online information and 
communication must enjoy the same rights as 
traditional print and broadcast media. 
UNESCO is concerned both about the traditional 
harassment of journalists practiced in some 
countries, and about more invisible restrictions on 
freedom of expression, including financial measures 
(i.e. high taxes on necessary equipment and high 
communication tariffs); technical measures (slow

Religious teaching 
on the rise? 
Religious education 
appears to be on the 
rise in public school 
systems around the 
world according 
to an analysis of 
school timetables in 
some 140 countries 
by UNESCO’s 
International 
Bureau of Education 
(IBE, Geneva, 
Switzerland). 
It appears as a 
compulsory subject 
in the timetables of 
73 of those countries 
at least once during 
the first nine years 
of schooling. And 
in 54 of them, the 
time devoted to 
the subject during 
the first six years 
amounted to 
approximately 8.1 
percent of total 
teaching time. 
Previous research 
published a decade 
ago showed a clear 
decline in religious 
teaching over most 
of the last century. 
In a comparison of 
the years spanning 
1945-69 and 1970- 
86, for example, 
the average time 
dedicated to 
religious education 
fell from 5.2 percent 
to 4.2 percent.

countries account for

whereas the more developed 
nations generally spend

According to the Institute, 
three out of every 1,000 
inhabitants in developed 
countries are researchers; 
while only three out of 
every 10,000 inhabitants 
are researchers in the less 
developed nations. In terms

less than one percent (0.9 
percent) of their GDP to

t they know they cannot possibly keep. The UN Millennium 
summit meeting in New York, in September 2000, aimed 
to halve the proportion of people without access to safe water by 2015. 
Last year’s World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) in 
Johannesburg (South Africa) added a similar target for sewers. 
To meet those targets would mean connecting nearly 300,000 people 
every day to a supply of clean water and 500,000 to a sanitation system. 
“This is simply not going to happen under anything remotely like 
current conditions,” says Margaret Catley-Carlson, chairwoman of the 
Global Water Partnership, a body set up in 1996 by the World Bank, the 
UN Development Programme and the Swedish International Development 
Agency. 
By 2015, nearly three billion people — 40 percent of the projected world 
population — are expected to live in countries that find it difficult or 
impossible to mobilize enough water to satisfy the food, industrial and 
domestic needs of their citizens. 
And by then, tens of millions of people will have died from water-borne 
diseases, including an average of 6,000 children every day, according to 
the inter-agency working group set up by the UN to prepare for last year’s 
summit in Johannesburg, at which water was defined as a priority field 
for action.

> report by the International Food Policy Research Institute 
and the International Water Management Institute. That 
is the equivalent of annually losing the entire cereal crop 
of India, or the combined annual harvest of sub-Saharan 
Africa, West Asia and North Africa. 
It is not that governments do not know about these 
dangers. A string of international conferences over the 
past 25 years has focused on water issues and set targets 
but “hardly any” have been met, according to the recently 
published United Nations World Water Development Report 
- Water for People, Water for Life. 
“Attitude and behaviour problems lie at the heart of the 
crisis,” says the report, published as a key contribution to 
the International Year of Freshwater, which is being led by 
UNESCO and the UN Department of Economic and Social 
Affairs. 
Following the publication of the report, an initiative of the 
UN'’s World Water Assessment Programme, no government 
leader should be able to claim ignorance of the crisis. 
Twenty-three UN agencies contributed to the report, which 
is packed with sobering statistics and is full of suggestions 
about how to deal with the crisis. 
Lack of access to clean water and sanitation are widely 
seen as a violation of human rights and an affront to human 
dignity. The report emphasises the tragic impact the crisis 
has on “the everyday lives of poor people, who are blighted 
by the burden of water-related disease, living in degraded 
and often dangerous environments, struggling to get an 
education for their children and to earn a living, and get 
enough to eat.” It is also a question of equity. A child born 
in the developed world consumes 30 to 50 times the water 
resources consumed by a child in the poor countries. 
“The crisis is experienced also by the natural 
environment,” it says, “which is groaning under the 
mountain of wastes dumped on it daily, and from overuse 
and misuse, with seemingly little care for the future 
consequences and future generations.” 
This special feature examines some of the key issues related 
to the crisis.

### 132178: Water: a flood of promises, a trickle of progress

UNESCO | the new Courier | October 2003 
P business is likely to expand quickly if services are 
brought under world trade rules, and much of the 
noise about privatization comes not so much from 
the developing countries as from the United States, 
whose municipally run water systems would risk 
takeover by foreign corporations. 
Few issues stir such passionate debate as the 
commercialization of water services — of making 
people pay sometimes far more than they can afford 
for one of the essentials of life. Many consider it 
wrong to allow private corporations, whose primary 
obligation is toward their shareholders rather than 
the common good, to profit from a basic human 
need. 
Islamic societies consider water is a God-given 
good, which Joachim von Braun, director-general 
of IFPRI, says “makes it so difficult to introduce 
efficiency and cost recovery.” 
“In some countries,” he says, “the words ‘water 
price’ are forbidden. In Egypt, until fairly recently, 
these were words not to be used in government 
reports.” 
The UN now says explicitly that access to safe 
water is a fundamental human right, and most 
people doubtlessly see it that way. But does a right 
have to be free? Ismail Serageldin, chairman of the 
World Commission on Water for the 21st Century, 
has pointed out that food is also a human right, but 
few argue that food should be provided for nothing. 
In fact the subsidizing of water may be one of 
the reasons it is becoming so scarce in parts of 
the world, because unless people value something 
properly, they tend to waste it. Some experts say 
a sharper distinction should be made between 
water for drinking and hygiene and water used in

agriculture and industry, over 90 percent of the total. 
The member States of the United Nations have 
committed themselves to halving the proportion 
of people without access to safe water or basic 
sanitation within the next 12 years, a daunting 
if not fanciful target that will require hundreds 
of billions of dollars of new investments on top 
of the money needed to maintain and repair the 
crumbling infrastructure of existing water systems. 
But water aid has declined in recent years and in 
any case does not go to the countries that most 
need it. Neither does private investment. The 2002 
Human Development Report of the UN Development 
Programme lists 60 countries in which more than 
one fifth of the population, sometimes substantially 
more than a fifth, has no access even to a public tap 
or safe well. Many of these are places in which no 
company in its right mind would consider investing. 
SECTOR CALLED DISASTROUS 
According to the Organisation for Economic 
Co-operation and Development (OECD), 
the least-developed countries, in which a very large 
proportion of the population lacks access to safe 
water, receive only a small part, about 12 percent, 
of foreign aid in the water sector. About half of the 
aid goes to relatively advanced countries, including 
Egypt, Mexico, Malaysia, China and India. 
“It is impossible,” says the Camdessus report, 
“to escape the conclusion that the global water 
sector in its many forms is in disastrous condition. 
Water is not being sufficiently developed and 
conserved. Physical infrastructure is lagging behind 
need. Sector management is deficient, services are 
deteriorating and deficits growing. Allied to this is a

shortage of financial services going into the sector. 
Indeed, the financial situation has been getting 
worse in the last few years, and the sector shows no 
sign of generating the funds to meet future service 
standards.” 
Given this situation, it is understandable that 
governments and international lending organizations 
see private companies, with their access both to 
expertise and to capital markets and their ability 
to transcend national boundaries, as part of the 
mix. The World Bank has made private sector 
involvement a condition for many of its loans. But 
this largely reflects frustration with the inability of 
public bodies to do the job and the realization by all 
lending institutions, including private banks, that 
the success of virtually all industrial and agricultural 
investments depend on the certainty of a safe supply 
of water. 
However, the water sector is rife with corruption, 
and as the Camdessus report points out, many 
irrigation agencies and water departments are 
“grossly over-manned, in a misguided attempt to 
create employment.” 
In its latest State of the World Report, the 
Worldwatch Institute says that following last year’s 
World Summit on Sustainable Development in 
Johannesburg, “it seems more likely that sustainable 
economic growth will emerge from the combined 
efforts of businesses, citizens’ groups and local 
governments.” 
The industry, as represented by the World 
Business Council for Sustainable Development, says 
it is ready for talks with all the parties involved “to 
find areas of agreement and test the application of 
these ideas on the ground.” At the moment, it says

but soon it will build “partnerships of the willing

and “create a roadmap on how to create appropriate 
local governance.” 
Private participation can take many forms, 
including financial arrangements among 
corporations, governments and local authorities to 
achieve development where development aid has 
failed. In Britain, water utilities are fully owned 
by private corporations. In France, corporations 
run utilities under long-term concessions. Many 
municipalities prefer to retain full ownership and 
control, but bring in private companies to manage 
water supplies for a fee. 
“Whether water services are provided by the 
public or private sector (or both), it is important 
that social and environmental objectives continue 
to be met,” according to a new OECD study, which pp

D> says that poor consumers “should not have to pay 
a disproportionately larger part of their disposable 
income for water services than better-off water 
consumers do.” 
It is increasingly apparent that the success of 
any water project depends on the participation 
of citizens. “Local communities must be actively 
involved in decisions about the trade-offs between 
standards, cost and affordability,” says a report 
on funding the Johannesburg targets written by 
Cambridge Economic Policy Associates. 
For Mr. Von Braun of IFPRI, “the answer to water 
pricing is efficient institutions of user associations 
that can negotiate with higher-level bodies. 
“What is driving demand for drinking water is 
not so much price, but the capacity to politically 
articulate,” he adds. “In some parts of the world 
the poor have become more articulate through 
decentralisation, devolution and more democracy, 
and what is on the top of their agenda as citizens is 
clean water and, as farmers, access to irrigation.” 
The world is full of places where large dam and 
infrastructure projects have displaced populations, 
where the concept of water markets has been 
© Caroline Penn/Panos Pictures, London 
introduced against the will of the people and 
where sites of cultural or religious importance 
have been destroyed. All this points to the need to 
involve the civil population and non-governmental 
organizations in the planning process. 
Lack of public participation is at the root of 
the dissatisfaction with many of the private deals 
and public-private partnerships in the water 
business. If the companies are often seen as remote 
and arrogant, they have often brought it upon 
themselves by signing opaque deals with corrupt 
or undemocratic governments, by spending huge 
sums on lobbying, lavishing grotesque salaries on 
their executives, cutting standards, promising more 
than they could deliver, hiking charges beyond the 
level that poor people could afford to pay and by 
laying off workers. The 1999 Gallup International 
Millennium Survey showed enormous suspicion of 
corporate conduct and scorn about the companies’ 
perceived lack of social responsibility.

out the voices of workers, consumers, women, 
environmentalists and other interest and citizen 
groups,” the 2002 UNDP Human Development

Report says. Cases such as that of the privatization 
of the water supply in Cochabamba, Bolivia, which 
led to a general strike, riots and the imposition 
of martial law before the American-owned 
company was expelled, it adds, are examples of 
“how the concerns of local people, intellectuals, 
environmentalists and other groups are often 
ignored until they develop into protests and major 
confrontations.” 
Enron was investing heavily in the international 
water business until hidden debts forced its 
collapse. Vivendi, the French-owned largest player 
in the sector, which recently renamed its water 
and waste business Veolia Environment, has often 
seemed more preoccupied with its far-flung media 
and entertainment empire than the less glamorous 
business of delivering clean water to slums. 
CONTROLLING THE CORPORATIONS 
Some of the corporate failings are examined in detail 
in “The Water Barons,” a year-long investigation 
by the International Consortium of Investigative 
Journalists into the private water business. Sober 
reading though this is, the Camdessus report, 
without overlooking the problem of corruption, says 
that most private operations “have achieved real 
progress in efficiency and, when required by the 
authorities and as part of their contracts, affordably 
served poor suburbs.” These, of course, are the 
cases that do not make it into the headlines. 
The mistake seems to be in expecting capitalist 
corporations to act in anything other than a 
capitalist way. No matter how responsibly the 
companies conduct their business, it is up to 
public authorities to ensure that public services are 
provided to everyone on an equitable basis rather 
than on their ability to pay, and to ensure that 
natural resources are respected. 
That is why many of the organizations 
representing the interests of the developing world 
have called for the formal international regulation 
of trans-national corporations - an idea that was 
vigorously and successfully opposed by the business 
lobby at the Johannesburg summit meeting. It 
argued that self-regulation was sufficient. 
Nevertheless, the Camdessus report stresses the 
necessity for regulation at the national level, to keep 
water agencies at arms’ length from governments 
and make them accountable to the public. 
“Unfortunately,” it goes on, “there are very 
few examples of good, experienced regulators in 
the water sector in developing countries. Most 
are recent, weak and subject to government

Tanzania investment suffers.” 
Because regulators are so weak, conditions 
of injustice and inequality for which the private 
operators often get the blame, are allowed to 
perpetuate themselves. “In country after country,” 
notes the report by Cambridge Economic Policy 
Associates, “water services are provided to the 
better-off at deeply subsidized prices while the poor 
receive no service at all. Despite repeated urging by 
donors to raise tariffs on the better off - to generate 
additional resources that can be used to finance 
basic service access by the poor - this regressive 
situation remains in most developing countries.” 
The reason is obvious. The poor have no clout 
and the politicians who make decisions about 
charging are reluctant to raise prices or taxes on 
their more influential supporters. In fact, it is often 
the wealthier and more powerful, rather than the 
poor, who have been most adamantly opposed 
to private sector involvement, if this resulted in a 
weakening of their patronage. Ismail Serageldin says 
it was “perverse” to defend price subsidies in the 
name of the poor when they had no access to public 
services and had to buy water of dubious quality 
from street vendors at ten or 20 times the price they 
would have to pay if they were connected to the 
water system. 
Carrying water on trucks and on peoples’ backs is 
a very inefficient way of providing a water service, 
but in slum areas in the developing world that 
don’t have a hope of a connection to a piped water 
supply, it is the only way. Contrary to the common 
perception, the Asian Development Bank, in a 
study of small-scale private water providers in eight p>

Pp cities, found these to be often family businesses, 
well integrated in the community, providing good 
services to the poor at competitive prices. 
Given the current slow expansion rate of water 
utilities, the study recommended legitimizing and 
improving the business environment for these 
providers to enable them to expand their capacity 
and offer lower tariffs. 
Anti-globalization campaigners fear that opening 
the market for water services at a time when water 
is becoming an increasingly scarce commodity will 
touch off the modern equivalent of a gold rush. 
They say it will be hoarded and shipped around the 
world as oil is today. 
If such an open bidding system for water comes 
to pass, the environment and the future will be the 
big losers, says Maude Barlow, a Canadian anti- 
globalization activist. In her book “Blue Gold,” she 
observes: 
“In all of this privatization, pricing debate, there is 
precious little said about the natural world and other 
species. That is because the environment is not 
factored in to the commercial equation. If we lose 
public control of our water systems, there will be 
no one left with the ability to claim this life-giving 
source for the earth.”

1989, he received a country in 
economic shambles. Raging 
hyperinflation reached five 
thousand percent a year and 
the entire public services 
and utility network was near 
breakdown. In 1993, Menem 
privatized the Buenos Aires 
water utility under pressure 
from the World Bank, the 
International Monetary Fund 
and the United States. 
The government granted a 
  
30-year concession to Aguas 
Argentinas, a consortium 
led by Lyonnaise des Eaux 
(later Vivendi, and now 
Veolia Environment), to run 
17 districts in the capital. 
The consortium received the 
concession for nothing, but 
promised to reduce water 
rates and expand services. 
The same group also runs the 
water services in Santa Fe. 
Water was one of the last of the utilities to be sold 
off to private concession and, despite the allegations 
of corruption, the call for tenders for water is still 
regarded as reasonably managed. The World Bank 
promoted Argentine water privatization as a model 
for the rest of the world. 
Aguas Argentinas set up a billing system that 
reached most users for the first time, and provided 
water to an additional two million people, although 
it was slower to install sewers. Now economic 
crisis has halted further expansion plans for the 
foreseeable future. 
The consortium dropped water rates on taking 
over the concession, but has repeatedly raised them 
since. And the business has been highly profitable. 
Under the original concession, the peso was pegged 
one to one to the US dollar. But it now takes more 
than three pesos to buy a dollar, and the privatized 
services all want to increase their charges again. The 
new president, Nestor Kirchner, is resisting as many 
Argentines struggle to survive in the grim post- 
collapse economy. 
The companies say they do not have enough 
income for anything more than paying wages and 
keeping up basic investment, while the public 
accuses Aguas Argentinas of falling down on water 
treatment and environmental conservation. 
Meanwhile, Marfa Julia Alsogaray, who had been 
appointed to lead an environmental cleanup in the 
rivers flowing into and around Buenos Aires, and 
who awarded Aguas Argentinas numerous rate 
increases, is currently on trial on charges of illicit 
enrichment while in public office. 
But the problems in Buenos Aires pale in 
comparison with those in other parts of the country. 
What is referred to as a “scandalous contract” 
involved the province of Buenos Aires and Azurix de 
Buenos Aires, an Enron subsidiary. Azurix offered 
over $300 million for the concession, $100 million 
more than any of its rivals, but failed so badly to 
provide an adequate service to major centres such 
as Bahia Blanca that the provincial government took 
over the operation. 
As in Cochabamba, in neighbouring Bolivia, 
residents of Argentina’s smallest province, Tucumadn, 
rebelled at the takeover of their water utility by a 
foreign company and the massive rate increases that 
followed. The French-owned Aguas del Aconquija 
pulled out of the deal after customers stopped 
paying their bills, leaving the utility facing an 
international dispute procedure and an uncertain 
future. 
While these disputes have been going on, the 
government has been meeting with fellow members 
of the Mercosur economic alliance - Uruguay, 
Paraguay and Brazil - to conserve one of the world’s 
largest aquifers — an enormous reservoir that covers 
an area equal to the size of France, Spain and 
Portugal combined, and is said to contain enough 
water to supply the needs of the entire world for 
200 years.

Averting conflict in

is — apart from any

climate change - not a 
drop more water in the Nile River basin today than 
there was when Moses was found in the bulrushes. 
And there will not be a drop more in 25 years’ time, 
when the population living along the banks of the 
world’s longest river system is expected to have 
doubled to more than 300 million people. 
But population and economic pressures are 
mounting faster than the Nile’s capacity to sustain 
civilization, and as a result the choice is becoming 
more and more stark between conflict over an

increasingly scarce resource or co-operation to 
manage that resource more equitably. 
Fortunately, it seems that at last the ten nations 
that share the Nile basin are turning to co-operation. 
This could be an encouraging example for dozens 
of countries that face conflict unless they can reach 
agreement on how to share rivers that flow across 
international boundaries. 
“Water has been a major factor in the rise and fall 
of civilizations,” says Kofi Annan, Secretary General 
of the United Nations, in the foreword to the UN 
World Water Development Report. Nowhere is this 
more true than in the Nile Delta, where the water 
and silt washed down from the heart of Africa has 
formed the matrix of organized farming for 5,000 
years. Yet, adds Annan, water “has been a source 
of tensions and fierce competition between nations 
that could become even worse if present trends 
continue.” 
As the example of the Nile basin illustrates, the 
tendency among nations has been to seek means of 
co-operating rather than fighting over water. Sharp 
and often historically irreconcilable differences 
divide many of the countries sharing 261 river 
basins around the world. But “the number of cases 
where there has been co-operation related to water 
is much greater than the number of cases where 
there was conflict related to water,” says Léna 
Salamé of UNESCO’s World Water Assessment 
Programme. 
“I think human-kind has come to respect water as 
something culturally very important,” says Joaquim 
von Braun, director-general of the International 
Food Policy Research Institute in Washington. 
“The poisoned well is something that is perceived 
as disgusting in any society and there is a lot of 
tradition and culture against taking away someone

else’s source of water, especially in water-scarce 
regions.” 
In fact, Aaron Wolf and Sandra Postel, two 
American academics who have studied this issue in 
great detail, have found only one outright war over 
water in the past 4,500 years. That was between 
two city states, Lagash and Umma, in the region 
now called southern Iraq. There have been many 
skirmishes and conflicts in which water was a factor, 
but the authors have identified more than 3,600 
water treaties signed in the past 12 centuries, many 
of which have survived wars over other issues. 
In other words, water is a vexing and potentially 
dangerous problem in many areas, but not yet a 
murderous one. Will this continue to hold true in 
future as the pressure on finite water resources 
increases and nations come to fear that their vital 
interests or their survival are at stake? 
In the past, Egypt has not hesitated to threaten 
the use of force to keep its overwhelming share 
of the Nile’s waters. Some of its armed forces are 
trained in jungle warfare, clearly intended for action 
in countries far to the south, where the White Nile 
originates. 
Pointing at a map of the Ethiopian highlands, 
from which 85 percent of the water flowing to Egypt 
comes via the Blue Nile, Jan Luijendijk, a Dutch 
water engineer and expert on knowledge systems 
at the UNESCO-IHE Institute for Water Education 
at Delft (Netherlands), says, “if Ethiopia decided to 
build a dam on one of these river branches, then 
that would mean war with Egypt immediately. There 
is no other choice for Egypt.” He says an attempt 
by any of the nine countries in the Nile basin to 
use water in a way that would reduce the flow into 
Egypt could precipitate war. 
To avert that possibility, the nations living along 
the river have established what is known as the 
Nile Basin Initiative (see box), which is designed 
to replace the threat of conflict with the spirit of 
co-operation. Professor Luijendijk has been helping 
to bring together engineers from all ten Nile basin 
countries, under the assumption that the experts 
are more capable of solving water problems than 
politicians. 
At the same time, UNESCO, the lead UN agency 
on freshwater issues, has established a global 
programme called PC-CP - “From Potential Conflict 
to Co-operation Potential” - in collaboration with 
the non-profit environmental organization Green 
Cross International to examine “the potential for 
shared water resources to become a catalyst for 
regional peace and development through dialogue,

### 132181: Averting conflict in the Nile Basin

GANDA KENYA 
The Nile Basin 
In 1999 six nations 
of the Great Lakes 
-- Burundi, the 
Democratic Republic 
of the Congo, 
Kenya, Rwanda, 
Tanzania and 
Uganda -- as well as 
Egypt, Sudan and 
Ethiopia, formed the 
Nile Basin Initiative. 
Eritrea joined later. 
The aim: to resolve 
peacefully some of 
the big questions 
over shared water 
resources facing 
these countries. 
The most 
compelling issues: 
Would Egypt be 
willing to accept a 
lesser flow of the 
Nile in favour of 
economic projects 
upstream? And 
would Ethiopia be 
allowed to use part 
of the resources 
of the Blue Nile to 
develop its own 
agriculture? 
[nitintive 
Through this 
Initiative, the 
Nile nations have 
embarked on a 
process that may 
lead to a revision 
of the inequitable 
1959 agreement that 
gives nearly all the 
waters of the Nile 
to Egypt and, to a 
lesser extent, to 
Sudan.

p> co-operation and participative management of river 
basins.” 
This is still largely uncharted territory, since 
there is no international law on the management 
of water systems, apart from three non-enforceable 
framework documents that provide guidance for 
states in drawing up water agreements. Nor is there 
any mechanism to monitor or enforce the numerous 
bilateral water treaties between states. 
In the 1950s, Egypt took advantage of its status 
as the regional military and political power to 
reinforce a colonial era agreement that gave it 
almost complete control of the rivers snaking 6,700 
kilometres south into the heart of Africa and into the 
highlands of Ethiopia and Eritrea. 
In 1959, Egypt signed a complex agreement with 
the military rulers of newly independent Sudan for 
“the full utilisation of the Nile waters” -- and it 
meant full! 
Of the average yearly annual flow of 84 billion 
cubic metres passing through Khartoum, Egypt has 
been receiving 55.5 billion and Sudan 18.5 million 
cubic metres since the 1959 agreement came into 
force, with the remaining 10 billion cubic metres 
draining away as seepage or evaporating from Lake 
Nasser. Given Ethiopia’s importance as the source of 
most of this water, it is curious that the agreement 
was only bilateral and excluded all the other riparian 
states. 
However, the end of Communism and of the 
civil war in Ethiopia, a nation of more than 60 
million people, has opened the way to economic 
development and rapid population growth. And 
a series of devastating droughts has underlined 
the need to achieve food security, which could be 
achieved by irrigating the Ethiopian highlands and 
preventing millions of tons of topsoil being carried 
off by heavy rains every year. 
Ethiopia insists that it has every right to develop 
its natural resources. It has bitterly reproached Egypt 
for building the Aswan dam without even consulting 
it, as well as for appropriating the lion’s share of the 
river resources. An Ethiopian policy paper in 1997 
stated, “the stark inequality prevailing in the Nile 
basin cannot remain.” The one thing holding back 
Ethiopia from developing irrigated agriculture on 
a large scale is the threat of military action, which 
Egypt would regard as an act of self-defence. When 
Ethiopia brought in Israeli water engineers in 1989 
to survey its water resources, it received a stern 
warning from Cairo. 
Ethiopia’s claim to use the water arising in its 
territory has historical and international precedents. 
UNESCO | the new Courier | October 2003   
During the dispute over water that sprang up 
between the United States and Mexico at the end 
of the 19th century, U.S. Attorney General Judson 
Harmon stated that his country had absolute 
sovereignty over that part of the Rio Grande river 
that flowed within its territory and had no obligation 
to share it. 
More recently, Turkey has used a variation of the 
so-called Harmon Doctrine to justify damming the 
Euphrates River to the detriment of its downstream 
neighbours, Syria and Iraq. The former Turkish 
president, Suleyman Demirel, said those countries 
had no more right to claim Turkey’s water than 
Turkey had to claim their oil. 
But if this law of finders-keepers were applied to 
the Nile basin, “you would have to ask, why did 
God create Egypt?” says Prof. Luijendijk. “It cannot 
have more water unless it takes it from somewhere 
else, and there is nowhere else.” 
NEW DESERT COLONIES 
With the exception of a small amount of rainfall 
and ground water, Egypt gets all of its fresh water 
supplies for agriculture, industry and domestic use 
from the Nile. It uses its entire allocation of 55.5 
billion cubic meters and frequently dips into Sudan’s 
share as well. By diverting part of its supplies 
and by recycling waste water more efficiently, it is 
building new desert colonies to house people for 
whom there is diminishing room along the Nile. 
One Egyptian idea to capture more water was to 
help Sudan build the 360-kilometre Jonglei canal 
through the southern Sudd region, the largest area 
of wetlands in the world. The White Nile meanders 
for about a year through the Sudd, losing half its 
flow through evaporation. Egyptian engineers say 
that creating the Canal would recuperate much of 
the evaporated water and liberate nearly five billion 
cubic metres that would be shared equally between 
Sudan and Egypt. 
That was before much was understood about the 
environmental value of wetlands (see following

page). The canal project, originally designed by the 
British colonial rulers, has been halted since 1983 
as a result of the Sudanese civil war, itself partly 
caused by the population upheavals needed to build 
the canal. The secession of the south would create 
another state with claims on the Nile’s resources, 
something that Egypt does not want to happen. 
Cairo has therefore strongly supported the Sudanese 
government’s efforts to preserve national unity. 
The Jonglei Canal project emerges from the 
same kind of hegemonic thinking that produced 
the Aswan High Dam, which has brought mixed 
blessings to Egypt since it began operating in 1970. 
On the one hand, it has increased the amount of 
cultivable land and improved navigation in the Nile. 
On the other, it traps the millions of tons of silt 
washed down from the Ethiopian highlands every 
year. This used to enrich the Nile delta, but is now 
increasingly clogging the dam. As a result, the delta 
is sinking and becoming more saline because of the 
intrusion of sea water. Egypt has to compensate the 
loss of silt with heavy use of fertilisers. The dam has 
made Egypt even more dependent on the countries 
upstream, since any major shortfall into Lake Nasser 
would mean an interruption of half its electric power 
generation. 
Professor Luijendijk remembers a tense meeting in 
Addis Ababa a few years ago at which an Ethiopian 
delegate accused the Egyptians of stealing not only 
his country’s water but also its soil. “An Egyptian 
professor stood up,” he recalls, “and said, ‘thank 
you so much for the water. But keep the soil, please’. 
That is when I started to realize these people were 
talking nonsense. They were talking like politicians. 
If you put two Egyptian and two Ethiopian water 
engineers in a room for a week and told them to 
come up with a solution satisfactory to both sides, I 
am sure they could do it.” 
Even Egypt is starting to realize the instability of 
a situation in which five of the Nile river nations 
count among the poorest in the world, and in 
which a large nation subject to repeated droughts is 
expected to stand by, while the Egyptians and the 
Sudanese undertake massive irrigation. 
Egypt is making a big effort to optimize the use of 
its limited resources by improving the efficiency of 
irrigation, changing crop patterns, lining irrigation 
canals and reusing drainage water. Despite all these 
measures, it still imports about seven million tons of 
wheat a year. 
For Professor Luijendijk, it might also make 
more sense for Egypt to import some of its water 
“virtually” by letting Ethiopia grow some of its food. 
According to the Worldwatch Institute, importing 
one ton of grain is equivalent to importing 1,000 
tons of water. 
This would be an interesting reversal of history, 
since Egypt was once the granary of the Roman 
Empire.

in river engineering in Egypt, and building up an

p> internet-based network to enable water experts to 
share information and construct the intellectual 
framework to solve the problems. The countries 
are still essentially in a confidence-building phase 
-- helped by the fact that the availability of satellite 
pictures makes it difficult for them to have secrets 
from one another. 
Some of the countries in the basin have very 
few trained engineers, but the network means that 
they can be part of a large circle of like-minded 
colleagues. At the same time, the ten nations are 
developing regional centres that specialize in various 
aspects of research. 
Professor Luijendijk recalls that his own country, 
the Netherlands, is in a similar position to Egypt, 
at the end of a long river system, and took decades 
to overcome suspicion of its neighbours. This 
was achieved by exchanging data, working with 
other countries to resolve problems and building 
confidence little by little. He thinks the Nile 
countries can achieve the same degree of co- 
operation. 
“The whole environment is changing, and I don’t 
believe any more in the scenario of war,” he says. “I 
think that the work that has been done by the Nile 
Basin Initiative in creating the right environment, 
and maybe by us in introducing knowledge, is 
enabling people to talk about the problems. Once 
you have reached that stage, nobody is talking 
about conflicts, but about how to achieve the best 
solutions.”

### 132182: Save that swamp!

Save that 
swamp! 
To create more agricultural land, governments 
have drained marshes and swamps — 
thus losing a key element in water recycling 
and bio-diversity 
etlands have often been seen as 
wastelands, with governments seeking to 
drain them, whether to eliminate malaria 
and other water-borne diseases or to create more 
land for agriculture or development. 
But now the world’s swamps, bogs and marshes 
are coming back into their own as scientists discover 
the vital role they play in regulating water quality 
and quantity, providing a critical habitat for plants 
and animals and influencing the local climate. 
Wetlands capture and retain rainfall, and prevent 
valuable sediments from being washed into lakes 
and rivers. They add moisture to the atmosphere, 
which falls as rain and cools the environment. They 
can even be used as sewage-treatment plants that 
require little technology or maintenance. 
About half of the world’s wetlands, ranging from 
the fast-disappearing mangrove swamps in East 
Asia to the environmentally challenged Jamaica Bay 
marshes, a few miles from downtown New York, 
have disappeared in the last 100 years. Many of 
those that remain have been fragmented with dams, 
sluices and canals. 
Mostly the wetlands have receded under pressure 
from growing populations and urban sprawl. But 
sometimes they have been deliberately eradicated 
as in Iraq, where Saddam Hussein’s regime drained 
most of the vast marshlands that have stood between 
the Euphrates and Tigris rivers since the dawn of 
history, and turned much of its population into 
refugees. 
Patrick Denny, a wetlands scientist at the IHE-Delft 
Institute for Water Education (Netherlands), has spent 
much of his career in Uganda, the second country in 
the world after Canada to grant official protection to 
its extensive wetlands by constitutional law. 
For Professor Denny a good wetland acts both as a 
sponge and a filter. 
“It holds water, and allows a river to be released 
more slowly,” he says. “It keeps the rivers flowing.

In the dry season it keeps the streams trickling. It 
gives time for the water to recharge the aquifer and 
keeps the water table up.” 
Without this sponge function, rivers flow faster 
and carry off valuable nutrients, soil and organic 
matter from up-stream. Not only is this an economic 
waste, but the nutrients can damage lakes and kill 
fish by promoting an explosive growth of algae and 
reducing the oxygen at deeper levels - a process 
known as eutrophication. 
The effects of neglecting wetlands can be seen 
in the world’s largest tropical lake, Lake Victoria, 
which is bordered by Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya, 
and is a source of livelihood, food and employment 
for more than 30 million people. 
The once astonishing diversity of fish species 
in the lake has been depleted not only by the 
introduction of aggressive non-native species but 
also because of the runoff of pollution and silt from 
the catchment. 
Protection of the lake’s environment was 
one of the reasons that prompted the Ugandan

Professor Denny. “I can

and wetland systems are 
well managed, then health 
issues are not as serious 
as one might believe. 
Disease usually comes 
from poorly managed systems in which human 
beings themselves have changed the balance of 
nature. In a naturally functioning system with good 
biological diversity, you are not likely to have many 
mosquitoes because of the amount of fish, insects 
and birds that eat the larvae.” 
Wetlands act as a natural purification. It is also 
possible to create small artificial wetlands to treat 
the sewage output of a village or clean the effluent 
from conventional sewage plants, which in Africa 
frequently fail to function because of electricity cuts 
and poor maintenance. 
Seeded with fast-growing papyrus, which has 
many economic applications, the marshes not only 
filter out the impurities but recycle nutrients as well. 
This produces food for the invertebrates, which in 
turn provide nourishment for fish and birds. 
“If you have more diversity, there is a greater 
chance that the people who live in those systems 
can have a sustainable way of life,” says Professor 
Denny. “Riparian people can ensure a supply of 
fish by helping nature by digging ponds where fish 
collect. The ponds remain flooded in the dry season: 
the fish are fed on domestic waste and can grow fat.” 
Even industrialized nations, he says, are starting 
to undo some of the hard engineering of rivers 
and lakes and allow water to occupy natural flood 
plains with beneficial effects for the people, the 
environment, for biological diversity and for the 
aquifers.

In Kazakhstan, where the once immense Aral Sea is 
fast shrinking, citizens lack fresh water even as the country 
becomes relatively rich 
JNESCO | the new Courier | October 2003 
Aktau, on Kazakhstan’s Caspian shore, 
tap water is so heavy with chemicals that 
foreign-built washing machines last just a 
few months. Understandably, the residents of Aktau 
who can afford it prefer to buy mineral water from 
a shop rather than risk the yellow, smelly water in 
their sinks. 
The problem is a national one; Kazakhstan has 
the worst provision of clean drinking water in the 
Confederation of Independent States. In rural areas, 
instances of hepatitis and other water-borne diseases 
are high. All around the country, almost half the 
pumps and public taps are turned off permanently 
because they are worn out or sub-standard. 
Svetlana Voitova, who lives just shy of the 
Chinese border, in a large village called Narynkol, 
says: “We do not have water in our homes, so we 
use the village pumps. But often even the supply to 
the pumps is turned off because people do not have 
enough money to pay the local authorities for it. 
Then we have to use the river.” Even in the newly- 
constructed capital city, Astana, stories of water 
running brown are legion. 
But the problems do not stop there: Kazakhstan is 
also home to one of the worst water-related natural 
disasters on the planet. 
The Aral Sea used to be the fourth largest inland 
lake in the world. Since the fifties, botched Soviet- 
era planning has caused the water-surface area to 
shrink to a third of its original size and the shoreline 
has receded by 100 kilometres, leaving rusting hulks 
of fishing boats stranded on the land. Salt from the 
exposed water bed blows into the eyes and throats 
of those who continue to live there, and few crops

will grow. The local fishing industry, which once 
produced 30,000 tons of fish a year, has almost 
entirely disappeared. 
Severe environmental degradation, unabated 
pollution, undrinkable water and infectious 
diseases are usually the by-products of poverty. But 
Kazakhstan is rich. Thanks to its oil, the government 
earns billions of dollars in foreign exchange from 
its joint-venture operations with multi-national oil 
consortia, who pay huge, but undisclosed, signature 
bonuses for extraction rights. 
The country runs an oil savings account, called 
the National Oil Fund. It is widely predicted that this 
will bulge with US$100bn by 2020. 
Ironically it is the areas richest in oil which 
have some of the worst water problems. While the 
pristine compound built to house the international 
oil executives of Atyrau - the city in western 
Kazakhstan know as the ‘oil capital’- has its own 
filtration system, local people do not drink tap water 
even after boiling. 
The oil money seems to be exacerbating this 
kind of inequality rather than healing it. There are 
no known immediate plans to spend any of the 
fund on social or environmental concerns. Aktau 
has a water filtration system, but it is broken, and 
the political will to fix it does not seem to be there. 
Adding to this, the change from central planning 
to independence was almost cataclysmic. After 1991, 
the country’s economy all but collapsed, taking 
Left: A former fishing 
services with it. By 1994, inflation was 1975 percent port on the Aral Sea 
(Kazakhstan). The 
sea is now 64 km 
and there was no food in the shops. Little wonder, 
then, that the Communist system of free drinking 
water provision fell apart. away

Now, although it is still a transition economy with 
all the difficulties that entails, there is some hope

DISASTER OF THE ARAL SEA 
UNLIKELY TO BE REVERSED 
The Aral situation is also rooted in the past. Under 
the Soviet regime, the environment was seen as a 
testing or dumping ground, a resource to exploit to 
meet production quotas, or an irrelevance. Swathes of 
the country were used to explode nuclear weapons, 
and are now contaminated with noxious waste. 
The same thinking advocated that the Aral Sea be 
slowly drained to irrigate cotton fields. This area 
had been designated as the USSR’s centre for cotton 
production, and quotas had to be met at all cost. 
Post-independence, the same chaos that nearly 
caused the economic meltdown left the state 
unprepared to cope with large-scale environmental 
problems. 
Now, although international and non- 
governmental organizations are collaborating to stop 
the Aral Sea from shrinking further, the best-case 
scenario is that the recession be halted. It is highly ~~ p>

Versions of Kazakhstan’s water problems are 
replicated throughout the former Soviet states. 
The Aral Sea disaster is affecting neighbouring 
Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan and 
Krygyzstan, which are all linked to it by the rivers 
Amu Darya and Syr Darya. 
In Russia, recent studies have shown that 
around one in three drinking water samples fail 
statutory tests for pollution, while there are frequent 
outbreaks of hepatitis and tuberculosis (TB). In 
Uzbekistan the water has a high lead content and, 
as in Russia, TB is common. 
In Siberia, it is the oil exploitation itself that is 
polluting the water. Although production levels 
are declining, the region is still the major source 
of Russia’s oil output. An Alaska-sized region 
in western Siberia, called the Tyumen oblast, 
or district, produces nearly two-thirds of the 
country’s oil. 
Bad practice and the mis-management of 
infrastructure - it is difficult and expensive to 
maintain pipelines in Siberia’s harsh climatic 
conditions - have led to severe contamination 
of surface and ground water supplies. Spills are 
frequent and the shiny gleam of oil can be seen 
on rivers and lakes. But, as production declines, it 
becomes less likely that there will be any tightening 
of environmental standards. 
As with Kazakhstan, clean drinking water may 
come only after a long wait, and even then, the 
worst of the environmental damage inflicted on the 
sources of that water may be irredeemable.

### 132184: Europe's thirsty desert

Europe’s thirsty desert 
The Spanish government strongly defends its decision 
to shift water from the Ebro basin to the parched southern 
province of Almeria — but environmentalists disagree 
A sea of plastic 
greenhouses at la 
Mojonera near El 
Ejido (Spain) 
1 the craggy sierra overlooking 
the blue Mediterranean 
+ YO mM across Spain’s southeastern 
province of Almeria, the view on a blazing summer’s 
day is like that of Siberia in winter. 
Every scrap of ground is covered with 
whitewashed plastic greenhouses that glisten like 
snow under the sun, producing much of northern 
Europe’s fruit and vegetables. Almeria is the world’s 
most intensive greenhouse culture, with hundreds 
of trucks every day taking produce directly to 
supermarkets in Germany, Scandinavia or Britain. 
But the greenhouses - and the golf courses, hotels 
and housing developments along the coast - are 
using far more water than the underground sources 
can provide. 
Sea-water intrusion is turning the aquifers saline, 
while the rivers have all completely dried up, 
greenhouses now covering their parched beds. 
The government thinks it can solve the water 
problem by pumping supplies from the Ebro basin in 
northern Spain. The national water plan, envisaged 
to cost nearly 23 billion euros, will include a 1,000- 
kilometre pipeline and 70 dams. 
Many citizens in the north and Spanish 
environmental groups oppose the project, which 
they say has been designed by and for the 
construction industry - a technical fix that will carry 
a heavy environmental as well as economic cost. 
The plan also is being critically reviewed by the 
European Commission and Parliament, since roughly 
a third of the funding will come from EU taxpayers. p>

p The government insists that the project is 
needed as a symbol of national unity as well as 
for economic and practical reasons. But, rather 
than unite the country, the plan has created deep 
divisions, since many valleys in the north will have 
to be flooded to hold the water. At the same time, 
the project has angered the region of Aragén, which 
depends on the Ebro. You can now drive for hours 
past abandoned towns in its dried-up landscape. 
Meanwhile, the prospect of a fresh supply of 
water is spurring growth in the hothouse industry. 
The sea of plastic is rapidly spreading eastward, 
where land is cheaper, to the fringes of the Cabo de 
Gata natural park, Europe’s driest spot. 
Trucks bring clean water down from the high 
sierra for restaurants, and most people drink bottled 
mineral water because what comes out of the taps is 
contaminated with salt and pesticides.

world has a finite supply of

population growth but also by the 
demands placed on it by so-called progress. 
Far from dissolving into nothingness, many of 
the products of modern civilization that are being 
dumped into ground water supplies are proving 
surprisingly persistent. 
Pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers and the 
hormones and antibiotics used in animal production 
sink into the water table. Household cleaning and 
personal care products, disinfectants and other 
commonly used chemicals end up in sewage. 
In the industrialized world, the great majority of 
sewage plants are able to remove infectious agents, 
but this still leaves the problem of hormonally active 
products such as contraceptive pills that have the 
potential to affect the reproductive organs and alter 
the development of animals. 
Developing countries don’t have a chance.

Hydrological Sciences, 90 percent of wastewater 
treatment plants are not operative in Mexico. In 
Latin America as a whole, only two percent of 
sewage is treated. This is having a serious impact on 
ecosystems and bio-diversity. ‘ 
HAZARDS ARE UNKNOWN 
Every litre of wastewater contaminates on average 
eight litres of fresh water. The UN World Water 
Development Report estimates that the total of 
polluted water in the world is more than the amount 
contained in the world’s largest river basins. 
Yet the aquifers that store about 97 percent of the 
earth’s liquid fresh water, take thousands of years 
to accumulate, and their depletion or contamination 
can to all intents and purposes be considered final. 
Because this pollution is out of sight, some policy- 
makers believe they can ignore it. Others apply what 
is known as the precautionary principle. 
Although the tools to detect and measure 
polluting chemicals are improving, researchers and 
regulators do not know how quickly chemicals 
degrade, what impact they have on the environment, 
how they accumulate through the food chain or the 
magnitude of the human health problems they may 
be storing up. 
In addition, the chemicals being poured into 
the water supplies are likely to interact, exposing 
wildlife and humans to unpredictable additive and 
synergistic effects. 
The compounds ending up in the water supply 
are playing an increasingly important role in the 
life cycle of all creatures, including the writers 
and readers of this article. Therefore, everyone in 
developed and developing countries alike has a 
vested interest in ensuring that water remains the 
source of life, and not the engine of its eventual 
destruction.

Patricia Velasquez 
became a UNESCO Artist 
for Peace in recognition 
of her work in favour of 
the indigenous people 
of the La Guajira region, 
one of the poorest in 
Venezuela, situated 
along the border with 
Colombia. 
The top model was 
born in La Guajira in 
1971. While pursuing 
her modelling career, 
she has acted in films 
such as The Jaguar, 
The Mummy, and The 
Return of the Mummy. 
She took advantage of 
her success to found the

their collaboration in the fight 
against the illicit trafficking of Iraqi 
cultural goods. On July 8 they 
amended a cooperation agreement 
that has linked the two bodies 
since 1999, laying the ground 
for the establishment of a data 
base on cultural properties stolen 
in Iraq. The resulting inventory 
will provide customs officials, 
police and other players in the 
international art market with 
regularly updated information on 
Iraq’s stolen cultural heritage.

They helped each

looking intimidated

Courier | October 2003 
The View from Afghan 
Women. Mihreya Aziz 
and Shakiba Mohd- 
Alam, both 20, came to 
UNESCO Headquarters 
on April 1, 2003, with 
their instructor, French 
journalist Brigitte 
Brault, to present their 
documentary. They are 
among 20 film-makers 
trained by Aina, an 
association for media 
development which 
was set up in Kabul in 
2001 with UNESCO’s 
support. 
For their first film, 
the young women 
from Kabul decided 
to go out and meet 
women in other parts 
of Afghanistan and to 
film themselves as they 
worked. The contrast 
between the two groups 
of women is striking: 
the energy of the Kabul 
women, galvanized 
by freedom and the 
possibilities afforded 
to them by education; 
and the stagnating lives 
of the other women. 
The Hazara women, for 
example, have lost their 
homes and husbands. 
Forgotten by everyone, 
they have taken refuge 
in the caves of Bamiyan 
where they look after 
orphans. The film- 
makers recorded the 
preparation of the 
daily gruel, which is 
supposed to feed an 
army of children who 
fill the screen while one 
courageous woman, 
pleads: “Give us 
weaving looms, so we 
can earn a living!” 
The oppression 
weighing down 
Afghanistan’s women 
is ever-present, from the 
Kuchies in Nangarhar   
Province, who take the 
risk of speaking out, to 
the women of Herat, 
who refuse to do so. 
One desperate young 
woman in Badakhshan 
explains that she cannot 
leave her house because 
a local commander has 
vowed to kidnap her 
as soon as he gets a 
chance. Some men even 
attack the young film- 
makers. But we also 
see a mullah, the father 
of one of the film- 
makers, talking about 
his daughter’s ambition 
to become a journalist. 
“At first I was opposed 
to the idea,” he says. 
“Then I thought 
about it. I trusted the 
association and, well, if 
we want Afghanistan to 
modernize...”

tonnes of travertino

in length, this female form 
- entitled Reclining Figure

Henry Moore as an enigma. 
After careful consideration, the 
sculptor did not want the statue, 
which is situated at UNESCO 
Headquarters, to express a 
precise theme or literal intention. 
“People should ask themselves 
what its meaning is,” he said. 
They should project their 
interpretation on it and use it 
as a sounding board for their 
thinking. In any case, a serene 
protectiveness emanates from the 
sculpture, whose stone comes 
from the quarries of Carrara

Michelangelo.

An Open-Air 
Sculpture 
influenced by primitive art and 
quickly built an international 
reputation. His first reclining 
figures, in powerful shapes 
inspired by nature, date from 
the 1920s. “From the start, the 
reclining figure was my main 
theme. I created the first around 
1924 and I think that after that 
more than half my sculptures 
were reclining figures. This 
obsession is particular to me.” 
As twisted, hollowed-out, 
abstract and monumental as they 
are, Moore’s reclining figures 
are also deeply human, at once 
intense and intimate. 
Moore was also a great 
draughtsman and produced a 
poignant series of remarkable 
drawings of people in the London 
Underground, sheltering from 
the bombs during the Blitz. 
“I had never seen so many sitting 
figures and even the tunnels 
reminded me of the holes in my 
sculptures,” Moore said.

Muc 
cultures of Laos can be qualified 
f the minority 
as intangible (rare languages, 
oral literature, un-written 
music, myths, rituals, social 
behaviour patterns etc.). Some 
is ephemeral or vulnerable: 
garments and textiles, musical 
instruments, traditional habitat 
largely built of bamboo etc. This 
work bring to the public eye the 
contribution of 36 experts who 
took part in an international 
experts’ meeting on the 
“Safeguarding and Promotion of 
the Intangible Cultural Heritage 
of the Ethnic Minority Groups 
of the Lao People’s Democratic 
Republic”, in Vientiane in 
October 1996. 
€® While some chapters will be 
of particular interest to linguists, 
other will delight lay readers, 
enabling them to discover, for 
example, the important role of 
weaving. The authors examine 
every aspect of the craft in 
detail: fibres, dyes, equipment, 
techniques, motifs, types 
of garment, and the beliefs 
associated with this activity. 
They stress the role of women 
who are alone to practice 
weaving and describe their 
special status as custodians of 
particular skills. 
¢¢ A similar wealth of 
information is to be found in the 
chapters devoted to music and 
architecture. Houses, whether 
on stilts or built directly on 
the ground, express ethnic 
belonging, impact life styles, 
reflect fundamental myths, 
symbolic representation of 
the world, and of the high 
points in a community’s social 
organization. Thus, in the south 
of the country, the expression for 
getting married is “to climb into 
the house”. The creative wealth 
of each minority unfolds through 
transversal studies.

main characteristics of a given 
group in an attempt to describe 
the particularities of its identity. 
We discover, for example, the 
cosmogony of the Katu, their 
beliefs, taboos, and their values, 
which are based on the quest 
for harmony. Another entry 
describes the lives of the Ko, 
their mores, social organization,

questions such as, how to 
reconcile the preservation of

Private Linkages, 
Public Trust 
D The effects of globalization 
are increasingly making 
themselves felt throughout 
higher education as in all areas 
of human endeavour and they 
pose a number of challenges 
to universities in both rich and 
poor countries. 
The state is no longer 
the sole reference point 
for the development of 
universities. By opening up 
to a new global space, higher 
education witnesses the 
emergence of new players: 
regions, provinces, Lander, 
international organizations, 
NGOs, enterprises, enterprise- 
universities and virtual 
universities. As their orbits 
intersect and are subject to the 
gravitational pull of these new 
systems, universities are forced 
to change their own trajectories. 
This panorama, result of the 
contributions of seventeen 
higher education specialists, 
raises the question of both the 
place of universities on the 
international scene and their 
social relevance in a knowledge- 
based world where innovation 
has become the driving force.

Manual on Harmful 
Marine Microalgae 
D Proliferations of microalgae 
in marine, brackish or fresh 
waters can cause massive fish 
kills, contaminate seafood with 
toxins and alter ecosystems in 
ways that humans perceive as 
harmful. Some 300 species of 
microalgae are known to form 
mass occurrences, or so-called 
blooms, and nearly one-quarter 
of these species produce toxins. 
This book provides guidelines to 
modern methods of sampling, 
identification, culturing, toxin 
analysis, monitoring and 
management of harmful marine 
microalgae. Prepared by 46 
leading scientists under the 
aegis of the Intergovernmental 
Oceanographic Commission 
(IOC) of UNESCO, it is a 
comprehensive source book of 
protocols for studying harmful 
marine microalgae and the 
main reference in its field. It 
serves as a useful tool not only 
for research laboratories and 
environmental or food safety 
monitioring authorities, but 
also for teaching and training 
purposes.
