UNESCO | the new Courier | April 2004 
_ statistics on HIV/AIDS are heartbreaking, the 
human distress each case represents even more 
so. Two decades after the start of the pandemic, 
the New Courier takes stock and devotes its “Focus” dossier 
to shedding new light on this devastating topic. 
We know more and more about the progression of the 
pandemic. Decision-makers’ lack of determination to see 
and tackle the problem is compounded with all the factors of 
precariousness: poverty, social isolation, low level of education, 
difficulty in accessing medical care, etc. The results are tragic: 
the huge vulnerability of so many young African women or other 
high-risk groups, such as drug addicts in certain countries. In 
the face of such destruction, as deadly as the worst of wars, the 
international community has progressively organized to fight 
on all fronts, under the banner of UNAIDS, which UNESCO co- 
sponsors. Here and there, we can see sparks of hope. 
Improving medical treatment is crucial to limit damages, 
but the principal keys to checking the spread of the disease 
remain preventive action and education, relayed by mobilization 
at all levels. The numbers and the stories reported from 
Thailand, Brazil, South Africa or Uganda are eloquent. The 
results — victories large and small - depend mainly on partners 
joining forces. Brazilian authorities, for instance, were able 
to put together the NGOs’ capacities to contact marginalized 
populations, rely on the competence of UNESCO's office in 
Brasilia, and involve the media, including directors and producers 
of extremely popular television series. 
The articles in this issue of the New Courier testify, each from 
a different angle, to UNESCO in action, illustrating its multitude 
of links to organizations of all kinds, corporations or individuals 
who want to act with it. We go to Kazakhstan, where innovative 
solutions using distance education are needed to alleviate the 
side-effects of nuclear testing. Then to Barcelona, where the first 
Universal Forum of Cultures mixed and mingled multiple forms of 
cultural expression for four months. Then to the 34 new sites just 
inscribed on the World Heritage List. We will meet Navarre Scott 
Momaday, Manu Dibango and Miyako Yoshida, recently appointed 
“Artists for Peace”. Everywhere, UNESCO pursues its ideals, 
seeking to build step by step the defenses of peace in people’s 
minds.

are bright and alert. If they are not fed, they pass out at school 
and vitality in the classroom is substantially diminished. 
What is the scale of hunger? 
JM: We believe there are 840m hungry people in the world, at 
least 300m of them children. It’s likely half of hungry children 
don’t go to school -- and most of them are girls. If a girl can go 
to school and be fed, her life changes for the better in many 
ways. She will delay her child-bearing years until she is 20, 
instead of 12 or 13; she will have two or three children instead 
of seven or eight, and different expectations, aspirations for 
them. She will be a better mother, better citizen, teacher, 
entrepreneur, farmer -- whatever she chooses she will do it 
better, be more successful as a human being and economically. 
A very small investment in a child, especially a girl, has an 
enormous future payoff. 
Where are children hungriest? 
JM:. In Africa there are a couple of hundred million. There 
are 50-60 million in Latin America, 150 million in South-East 
Asia. Many countries have intense pockets of poverty and often 
when that is the case children are most affected. In Guatemala 
46% of children under five are chronically malnourished; and 
39% in Honduras. There are School Feeding programmes in 69 
countries, and the schools are everywhere - though more likely 
in rural communities. 
How does the School Feeding Programme work? 
JM: Where the WFP is working, UNESCO and other UN 
agencies will be present, so we can bring all services together 
through the schools. We often work with [international] NGOs 
such as World Vision, Save the Children, Care, Oxfam, Mercy 
Corps, and with local government and community leaders, 
NGOs, parents’ groups. Our job is generally to see the money 
is available to procure the food, transport it in or buy it locally, 
and then it is often prepared and distributed by NGOs, parents’ 
or local school groups. I have seen places where parents rapidly 
learn to prepare highly nourishing meals. In Afghanistan we 
supported 280 bakeries to produce loaves for children. Clearly, 
education and health ministries are critically important. About 
20 countries have “graduated” from the programme, but we 
will always be there to help if needed. Often we try to deliver 
emergency food assistance through schools; in a crisis kids 
often stop going to school. 
Do teachers also receive food? 
JM: These are decisions made by local school boards, but 
clearly teachers are key to the success of this programme and 
there are places where we provide food as interim short-term 
compensation for teachers. When Afghanistan didn’t have cash 
to pay for teachers, we paid them in food. 
What results have the programmes had? 
JM: We know school feeding has a powerful impact on 
the percentage of children going to school, and going on to 
secondary school. In Pakistan it has tripled the number of 
girls attending school. We have seen substantial progress in 
Bangladesh and Honduras. 
One of the first places I visited was Dodoma in Tanzania where 
the number of children going to school rose from 400 to 800 
and the percentage of kids going on to secondary school rose 
from 8% to 22%. There was a Kabul school with 1,500 boys 
and no girls; after the Taliban, and with introduction of the 
  
School Food Programme, there were 3,200 pupils -- 1,700 boys 
and 1,500 girls. 
In North Korea the results are remarkable. These are not 
necessarily related to school feeding, but between 1998 and 
2002 we were feeding millions of children and our nutritional 
survey shows the percentage of underweight children fell from 5 
60% to 20%. The acutely malnourished went down from 16% 
to 9%; and chronically malnourished from 60% to 40%. It’s 
still way too high, but it is an extraordinary example of the 
impact of therapeutic feeding on children’s lives. >

hi 
What are UNESCO and other agencies doing? 
JM: Development in humanitarian work is guided by the 
commitment to Millennium Development goals: reducing 
hunger and poverty, infant mortality, HIV/AIDS; improving 
maternal health, gender equality, universal primary education, 
the environment; strengthening democratic institutions. I 
believe hunger, food security and nutrition are at the basis 
of all these -- there will be no progress if people are not well 
nourished. If you address hunger and malnutrition, lives can 
turn around overnight. 
Who funds the programme? How much does it cost to feed 
children? 
JM: We have donor countries and private individuals, 
companies and NGOs who have contributed specifically to the 
School Feeding Programme. Thirty euros a year can provide a 
meal for a child every school day - about 200 days a year. We 
aspire to feed 50 million children. 
What are the difficulties? 
JM: There are challenges. We often have to provide kitchen 
facilities and utensils, get the programme started and make 
sure it has nutritional strength to benefit a child, and over the 
    
long term to see the government and local community take 
over the programme. We have a special effort now in nine

School Feeding is very 
relevant to EFA because 
the last children to attend 
school are those with 
serious problems that 
prevent them attending, 
such as hunger, lack of 
food at home and poverty. 
Other issues it addresses 
include HIV/AIDS 
prevention, early marriage, 
child labour. 
School feeding has much 
support among members 
of the EFA working group

governments — as a way 
to help poor children,

educational problems] where we have been working with the 
education and health ministries to bring in school feeding. 
Then there are children orphaned by HIV/AIDS. In sub- 
Saharan Africa 11-14 million children orphaned by AIDS are 
in care of grandparents, or other children; these kids are less 
likely to go to school, will have poor health care and less 
adequate nutrition. Their number will rise to 20 million over 
the next few years. 
But the good news is that the WFP, UNESCO, UNICEF, UNAIDS 
and WHO are working hard to address these issues. We have 
rethought our programming, how to help governments and 
community organisations. UNAIDS says most important is to 
educate 5-to-15-year-olds; second, to prolong parents’ lives 
so they have more time with their children; third, addressing 
orphans’ needs. There are places that have lost teachers, health 
professionals, agricultural workers. All the antiretroviral drugs 
won’t make any difference without good food and clean water 
and people who can administer the programmes. 
How are results monitored? 
JM: Our work is monitored and evaluated every day, in every 
place in the world, so we know the benefits. We have our own 
staff and outside people, including local governments in the 
community. Teachers, principals and parents have a good idea 
of our practices. (See Standardized Feeding Survey box.) 
What next? 
JM: We are heavily focused on investigating where we are 
most needed, so we can target resources on the hungriest, 
poorest people There is nothing more important than feeding 
schoolchildren; food and education are the keys to their future.

### 137747: Just a mouse click away: school for Kazakh children

Decades of Soviet 
nuclear testing have 
poisoned large areas 
of Kazakhstan. Result: 
Qualified teachers 
refuse to work there. 
To bridge the gap, 
UNESCO is launching 
an ICT distance learning 
programme. 
Massive 
Soviet-era atomic testing has left the children of 
vast areas of Kazakhstan a lethal legacy, which 
extends beyond the obvious health issues posed 
by exposure to radioactivity. Coupled with 
economic hardship, contamination renders these 
zones unattractive to qualified teachers, who 
refuse to be posted there, thereby dampening 
hopes for the future entertained by the area’s 
children. 
A recent UNESCO-sponsored study shows that 
the schools that do exist are inadequate. One 
teacher often teaches all subjects to all grades 
from 1 to 11 in a decrepit building and higher 
education is unavailable. UNESCO is launching 
a pilot project aimed at using Information and 
Communications Technology (ICT) to develop 
distance learning software that will fill the void 
left by the shortage of teachers and ensure that 
the children in the contaminated areas are not 
denied their educational rights. 
The most devastated zone is around 
Semipalatinsk, in eastern Kazakhstan, which 
was a huge nuclear testing range. From 1959 
until 1989, the Soviet military nearly succeeded 
in blasting the region off the map, conducting 
456 nuclear tests on the 18,000 km sq. site, 
called the Polygon. For 50 years, the radioactive 
contamination was carried by winds across the 
steppes far beyond the confines of the range. The 
contaminated area now covers some 550,000 km 
sq., about 1/5 of Kazakhstan, or an area “roughly 
the size of France, but without the Louvre or 
Montmartre,” wryly observes renowned Kazakh 
poet Olzhas Suleimenov, his country’s Permanent 
Delegate to UNESCO. 
LETHAL 
LONG-TERM EFFECTS 
All information regarding the tests was cloaked 
in the deepest secrecy, including their impact on 
  
health. The only hospital in the region, military 
run, denied the existence of the numerous strange 
and disturbingly debilitating diseases appearing 9 
in the region, including leukaemia, other types 
of cancer and genetic mutations causing physical 
and mental defects. It’s impossible to know how 
many people have been affected since 1959 but 
Kazakh government estimates run as high as 1.7 
million with about 350,000 still afflicted today. 
Semipalatinsk was renamed Semei after 
Kazakhstan became independent in 1991 and the 
Polygon was officially closed down. But the effects 
Schools pithout boundavies 
UNESCO is launching 
pilot comprehensive 
and public partners, including 
the Ministry of Education 
distance education projects 
at secondary level in both 
Kazakhstan and Namibia. 
The Kazakh project will be 
extended to other countries 
in Central Asia, while the 
Namibia scheme will serve 
isolated regions in Africa. 
In the Kazakh project, the 
University of Erlangen 
Psychology Department in 
Germany will develop 
teaching software for student 
classes and teacher training. 
A kick-off meeting of all private 
and Katelco, a satellite 
television channel, was to be 
held in late summer in Almaty. 
The Namibia project is still 
being defined but will focus 
on math and science. While 
the country has a relatively 
well-developed primary 
school system, it has few 
secondary schools. Start-up 
dates for the projects are set 
for the 2004-05 school year.

v 
of radiation last thousands of years, sometimes 
with dramatic consequences. Even now, children 
are born without arms, hands growing directly 
from their shoulders, a result of radiation-caused 
genetic mutations. Parts of the area are 1,000 
times more polluted than Chernobyl. Some 
ground water is radioactive and, because so vast 
an area cannot be closed off, livestock are free to 
graze on contaminated grasslands. 
Cleaning up has begun and serious efforts 
are being made to address the health needs of 
populations in these areas. But this is only one 
of many problems the country faces. There are 
a dozen other former nuclear sites to deal with 
along with the disaster of the drying up of the 
Aral Sea, causing desertification of arable land. 
With so many pressing needs, Kazakhstan is 
hard put to find funds for education. 
FUNDS SCARCE FOR 
EDUCATION 
The schools that do exist in the area are 
isolated and remote. The shortage of teachers 
for the country is estimated at 3,700, but since 
independence, priorities have shifted along 
with the demands of the burgeoning market 
economy leading to a fall in public spending, 
including in education. Public sector teachers 
earn less than those in the highly popular private 
schools and are often forced to take a second job 
making them less available for their students. 
Teaching materials in Kazakhstan are generally 
outdated and of poor quality, 
and supplies are insufficient 
to meet the demands of 
the country’s 3,004,900 
schoolchildren. 
Programmes in Asia, Africa 
and Brazil show that ICT can 
provide innovative solutions 
to a dearth of teachers. 
UNESCO is developing an ICT 
education programme that will 
draw on previous UNESCO 
experiences in other regions 
to produce a comprehensive 
system, says Team Leader Dana 
Ziyasheva. The project will 
adapt free software available 
in Europe aimed at education 
management and course 
production. It will also provide teacher training 
on how to use the software and strengthen 
infrastructure in selected pilot sites. “Relying on 
the educational expertise of Kazakh specialists 
and the transfer of know-how are the key to a 
sustainable project,” says Ziyasheva. A first step 
is training teachers to use both ICT and traditional 
methods efficiently to reach students. The steppes 
lack computers and remain mostly internet- 
free. At present only 700 of Kazakhstan’s 5,400 
secondary schools are linked to the internet, but 
the government aims to have them all connected 
by the end of 2007. 
Decontamination is the best way to solve 
the health problems and entice teachers back, 
but this is a long-term and costly undertaking. 
So far only $15 million of $43 million pledged by 
international donors in 1999 has trickled to the 
region. “We are not holding out a begging bowl,” 
Suleimenov says, but adds that the magnitude of 
the task is too daunting for any single country.

Considered boring and badly-paid,

fewer vocations. Yet the world needs 
more and more Scientists. 
young people fed up with 
science? How can their curiosity 
YE and taste for scientific 
adventure be stimulated? Many observers fear 
a shortage of scientists in the near future. This 
fear, repeated again and again in developed 
countries in recent years, is replicated in emerging 
and developed countries, where the training of 
young people to work in research is a vital issue, 
as much for the development of democracy as 
for their economic future. In this respect, the

international Conference on the teaching of 
sciences and technology which was held at 
UNESCO Headquarters in June 2004 represented 
a new step in the collective approach to the 
problem. Several recommendations were made 
during this meeting (see box 1), which was 
organised by the American Association for the 
Advancement of Science (AAAS) with the support 
of the National Science Foundation (NSF). 
More than ever before, research appears to 
be one of the major driving forces of economic 
development. In OECD member countries alone, 
the number of researchers rose from 2.4 million 
in 1990 to 3.4 million in 2000, and the demand 
continues to rise'. In early April 2004, the High- 
Level Group on Human Resources for Science 
and Technology in Europe called on the members

The international

the need to improve 
teaching methods and 
syllabuses, in both the 
primary and secondary 
sector, and to evaluate 
the impact of new 
educational practices. 
They proposed to hold 
an international forum 
on the teaching of 
science and technology 
in about two years. 
p of the European Union to take action to reach 
the target of recruiting 500,000 new researchers 
by 2010%. The NSF meanwhile estimates that 
2.2 million scientific and engineering jobs need 
to be created in the decade 2000-2010. In such a 
context, it is easy to see why there are concerns 
when certain scientific disciplines are being 
deserted, the population is aging, especially in 
Europe, and there are the risks of relying on 
foreign “human capital”. 
In emerging or developing countries, science’s 
lack of appeal can largely be attributed to the lack 
of infrastructure and a policy on science. This is 
certainly the case on the African continent, as 
Professor Nyiira Zerubabel, executive director of 
the Ugandan National Council for Science and 
Technology, told the conference: either young 
people go abroad, or they choose another training 
path which offers more promising employment 
terms and salary. The brain drain hits these 
countries hard. In order to resolve this situation, 
Pakistan has put financial incentives in place, as 
Syeda T.K. Naim, a consultant on the Ministerial 
Committee on scientific and technological 
policy of the Organization of Islamic Conference, 
explained. These include a raise in salaries for 
those researchers who publish in an international 
journal and for holders of a PhD. In India, Amitabh 
Mukherjee, director of the Centre for Science 
Education and Communication at the University of 
Delhi told the conference that the number of staff 
in the scientific streams had been rising since 2001. 
The relative lack of interest in science is part 
of a complex picture in which the global migration 
oy | 
of students plays an essential role. For example, 
more and more Chinese and Indian students 
choose other OECD countries over the United 
States, or they stay in their own countries®. Less 
is known about why certain streams are losing 
their appeal. The French physicist and academic 
Yves Quéré believes there are three reasons for 
this: “Science (in the way it is taught these days) 
is boring, it is considered dangerous and people 
believe they will never earn much by working in 
it.” Everyone seems to agree with this analysis 
of the problem and on the necessity to begin 
teaching science from primary school level. This 
aim currently has even greater support because 
the InterAcademy Panel (IAP) backs it, according 
to Yves Quéré, who co-chairs this international 
federation of science academies. 
INTRODUCING SCIENCE 
IN PRIMARY SCHOOL 
It is precisely on this subject that most 
experiments have been done thanks to several 
high-level pioneers. 
First there was the remarkable work of the 
American physicist and 1988 Nobel Prix Prize 
winner Leon Lederman in schools in under- 
privileged suburbs of Chicago, of which Yves 
Quéré spoke with admiration: “Everyone was 
leaving these schools and violence reigned. 
Leon Lederman introduced an initiation to 
science using active methods and he educated 
the teachers at the same time as the pupils. He 
completely turned the situation around. It was 
very impressive.” In the mid-1990s, Yves Quéré 
and astrophysicist Pierre Léna discovered this 
work with Georges Charpak, winner of the 1992 
Nobel Prize for Physics, who had been invited 
to see it by his colleague and friend Lederman. 
Once they returned to France, the three academics 
created the “La Main a la Pate” association 
(see box 2). Their objective was to reintroduce 
the teaching of science to primary schools, by 
putting the emphasis on experimentation and 
investigation. The experiment was sufficiently 
successful for it to be repeated around the world. 
In her speech to the international conference 
in June 2004, Shirley Malcom proposed that this 
approach be considered for use at higher levels. 
Malcom, the director of the education section of 
human resources at AAAS, said access to science 
for everyone was similar to UNESCO’s promotion 
of Education for All. She was also echoing the

LA Main 4 la Pate 
Mao la Massa in Brazil, Learning 
by doing in China, Penser avec les 
mains in Switzerland..., La Main 
a la Pate has spread around the 
world. The educational technique 
advocated by this association is 
simple. “It is all about starting by 
questioning children,” says Marc 
Jamous, one of the association's 
leaders. “Then the teacher helps 
the children to express what they 
think, to show them what happens 
in reality and to reformulate their 
original ideas.” The children are 
following essentially the same 
path as a real researcher; the 
process finishes with a statement 
and a conclusion, which the pupils 
write. “Not only do children 
discover science, they make 
enormous progress in their oral 
and written expression,” says 
Yves Quéré. In 1996, Georges 
Charpak, Pierre Léna and Yves 
Quéré created La Main a la 
Pate, after making a surprising 
discovery: barely 3% of French 
primary schools give their pupils 
an introduction to science. 
With the support of the French 
Education Ministry and the French 
Academy of Science, the three 
academics launched their scheme. 
They began by experimenting 
with 400 primary school teachers 
who volunteered. Today, this 
approach, supported by teachers 
and scientists, has spawned 
imitations in Mexico, Brazil, 
Chile, China, Malaysia, Senegal, 
Morocco, Afghanistan, Cambodia, 
Colombia, Slovakia and Serbia. 
Almost a century after the book by 
Frenchman Célestin Freinet, who 
introduced printing to schools in 
the 1920s, these new practitioners 
of pedagogy founded on freedom 
of expression and the joys of 
discovery and experimentation 
share their experiences via 
internet, on national websites and 
an international one: (http://inrp. 
fr/lamap/reseau/interna/accueil. 
html). As Yves Quéré points out, 
Marie Curie invented an early 
version of La Main a la Pate at the 
beginning of the 20th century. An 
account of what happened when 
she taught elementary physics to 
her daughter Irene and several of 
her colleagues’ children has just 
been published.

### 137749: The Price of school fees

UNESCO in action education 
THE PRICE 
OF SCHOOL FEES 
As countries abolish school fees, millions more 
children are entering primary school. But 
nm mw how much are they learning in overcrowded 
| al classrooms with no textbooks? 
The challenge: ensure access while maintaining 
14 quality of schooling. 
( 
surged across 
Emo t ( O nN Kenya when 
President Mwai Kibaki kept his campaign promise 
to abolish school fees in 2003. Propelled by pent- 
up hope, parents swarmed overnight to enrol 
their children in school. But as principals turned 
away pupils, the rosy picture was dimmed by the 
spectre of “the masses” swamping an already 
fragile education system. 
Today, the good news is that more than a 
million new pupils are squeezing into classrooms. 
But unfortunately, the expected foreign assistance 
has not fully materialized. In short, “School fees 
were abolished with great euphoria but little 
planning,” according to Andiwo Obondoh of the 
Global Campaign for Education. 
THE AFRICAN MOVEMENT 
The confusion is a rite of passage in the bold 
move towards free primary education made 
first by Malawi in 1994, followed by Uganda 
(1997), Cameroon (1999), the United Republic of 
Tanzania (2001) and Zambia (2002). Today any 
debate on free primary education must inevitably 
focus on these African countries, which offer 
valuable insight for Africa and for countries with 
high tuition fees such as Bhutan, Cambodia, 
India, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Nepal, 
Pakistan and Papua New Guinea. 
UNESCO | the new Courier | October 2004 
  
- 
In Sri Lanka, the 
law guarantees free 
primary school. But 
parents have to deal 
with indirect costs of 
schooling. 
Steve Packer of the EFA Global Monitoring 
Report was in Malawi when the government 
removed all school fees. “Enrolment surged from 
1.9 to 3.2 million in just three months. Some 
said it was crazy - the quality of the system 
was already appalling. But from a human rights 
perspective, can you deny millions of children 
ANY education, even if it is poor quality?” he 
says. 
No is UNESCO’s resounding answer. 
“UNESCO believes that it is better to uphold 
the principle of free primary education and to 
address energetically the quality challenge 
posed by an enrolment surge than to ration

access to school through fees,” according to 
John Daniel, the former Assistant Director- 
General for Education. 
A POLICY SHIFT 
While UNESCO focuses on the normative and 
policy front, UNICEF has launched a hands-on 
campaign to eliminate all primary education user 
fees in Africa. Cream Wright, UNICEF's Chief 
of Education, explains why: “First, we have 
repeatedly seen that once you remove school fees, 
the demand for education soars. On the negative 
side, AIDS is leaving a wake of orphans while 
devastating the community and family networks 
that used to help poor kids go to school. Without 
drastic action, more and more children will have 
no chance.” 
Even the World Bank has come around to 
encouraging countries to remove school fees. 
According to the Bank’s lead education specialist, 
Bob Prouty, Bank officials watched the African 
movement to abolish fees with skepticism that

gave way to amazement. “These countries have 
achieved the biggest success in Education for All 
overnight,” comments Prouty. 
UNEXPECTED COSTS 
According to a 2001 World Bank survey in 
79 countries, only Algeria and Uruguay have 
no fees. In the rest, about one third of fees are 
“unofficial” or illegal (see box). Not included are 
indirect costs, like transportation (in Cambodia, 
21 percent of household spending goes on 
education) or opportunity costs that hit the 
poorest families sending their children to school 
instead of work. 
There are also the “unexpected” costs, detailed 
in a recent report! by the United Kingdom aid 
agency DFID comparing how very poor families 
cope with primary school costs in Bangladesh, 
Kenya, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Uganda and Zambia. 
Officially, primary school tuition fees are illegal in 
all six countries.

P free education, is most striking, as parents 
continue to pay a range of official fees as well as 
“unexpected” costs - teachers’ funerals, year- 
end celebrations, classroom construction and 
telephone connections. Asked why pupils left 
primary school, 48% of parents cited inability 
to pay expenses. After food, education was the 
largest household expenditure in Uganda (and 
other countries, except for Nepal?). 
ENSURING QUALITY 
The authors don’t recommend fees, but 
conclude that “It is important for governments 
to recognize that the removal of tuition fees 
may result in schools having to insist on other 
charges.” In all countries surveyed, households 
routinely make sacrifices to continue paying for 
their children’s education. In Kenya, parents 
tend to skip meals, while in Sri Lanka, they defer 
medical treatment. But while cost is a major 
barrier, it is not alone in determining the demand 
for education. 
In the decision to send children to school 
or not, parents also consider the question of 
UNESCO | the new Courier | October 2004 
In Nepal, as well as 
school fees, parents 
often have to pay for 
quality. A World Bank survey of school fees in 79 books and uniforms 
countries (see box p.17) found that poor families 
are theoretically willing to pay slightly more for 
education seen as “good”. But when standards 
are not up to expectations, parents stop making 
sacrifices to cover costs. 
When Uganda abolished school fees in 1997, 
total net enrolment reached 84% but fell to 
76% by 2000. While it is too soon to draw firm 
conclusions, some experts argue that quality of 
education is to blame for dropout rates. 
Mary Pigozzi, Director of UNESCO’s Division 
for the Promotion of Quality Education, is 
concerned that countries are focusing exclusively 
on getting children into school without policies 
designed to keep them there. “There is a common 
misunderstanding that access to education must 
always precede attention to quality,” she says. 
“Quality clearly costs money but can we afford 
NOT to address it?”

34 NEW SITES ON THE WORLD HERITAGE LIST 
The Iranian city of Bam, where 26,000 people died in a 
brutal earthquake in December 2003, was among the new sites 
inscribed on UNESCO’s World Heritage List. Twenty-nine 
cultural and five natural sites were inscribed at the 28th session 
of the World Heritage Committee, held from June 28 to 
July 7 in Suzhou, China.

during the session, which was chaired by Zhang 
Xinsheng, Vice-Minister of Education of China 
and Chairperson of China’s National Commission 
for UNESCO. 
The new inscriptions brought to 788 the 
number of listed sites (611 cultural, 154 natural 
and 23 mixed). The 21-member Committee also 
added three properties requiring urgent attention 
to the List of World Heritage in Danger: the City 
of Bam, the Cathedral of Cologne (Germany) 
and the Ruins of Kilwa Kisiwani and Ruins of 
Songo Mnara (Tanzania). At the same time 
the Committee decided to strike three sites

coordinated efforts to improve their preservation. 
The List of World Heritage in Danger numbers

The World Heritage Committee examined ways 
to improve its work and the implementation of

to encourage the growth of under-represented 
categories of sites and improve geographic

Convention, adopted with its First 
fe Protocol on May 14, 1954, at The 
Hague (Netherlands), was the 
first international treaty to focus 
exclusively on the protection of 
cultural property in the event of 
armed conflict. It was reinforced 
by a Second Protocol, which was 
adopted in 1999 and entered into 
force on March 9, 2004. 
Since its Adoption, 109 countries 
have become party to the 1954 
Convention. To date, 88 of them 
have joined the First Protocol, and

Conference 
“Quality education for all

theme of the 47® Session of 
the International Conference 
on Education, organized by 
UNESCO’s International Bureau 
of Education in Geneva last 
September. Delegates from more 
than 135 countries attended 
the meeting and identified a 
range of priorities to improve 
the quality of education for all 
young people, including: the 
increased use of information 
and communication technology 
to improve access and equity 
for all young people to 
quality education; emphasis 
on innovating and creating, 
including the reform of 
educational delivery; affirmative 
action to compensate gender 
imbalance; recognition of the 
importance of teachers and 
trainers; increased research; 
and improved use of resources 
and better partnerships. The 
delegates also appealed for the 
mobilization of all partners in 
order to achieve this goal. 
Saving the PRC's Unique 
Ecosystems 
Donors gathered at a conference 
held at UNESCO headquarters 
last September pledged over 
40 million dollars to safeguard 
five sites in the Democratic 
Republic of Congo that are 
on the List of World Heritage 
in Danger. The conflicts that 
have ravaged the region and 
killed three million people have 
also inflicted serious damage 
on the unique ecosystems of 
these natural sites. They have 
also decimated certain animal 
species with commercial value, 
  
such as elephants and rhinos. 
Until now, efforts allocated to 
reinforce the protection of the 
sites have been thwarted by 
armed militia who attack park 
guards. Funds promised are 
designated to help Congolese 
institutions in charge of 
conservation. Donors attending 
the conference, however, 
stressed that the project’s 
success depends on greater 
involvement by local authorities 
and an end to the war in DRC.

MB The figures are staggering. Every day 8000 people die 
of AIDS and another 14000 are infected. With nearly 70 
percent of the world’s 40 million people living with HIV, 
Africa is hardest-hit by the disease, and the continent’s 
women and children are most vulnerable. In sub-Saharan 
Africa almost six out of every ten people infected are 
women [p. 33]. 
And the virus continues its deadly progression almost 
everywhere, ignoring all borders and taking hold in areas 
which, until now, have been relatively untouched. In 
Eastern Europe for example, and notably in Russia, HIV/ 
AIDS is rapidly gaining ground, especially amongst drug 
users [p. 35]. 
Considerable efforts have been made to prevent its spread, 
but have often proved ineffective. Despite being well 
informed of the dangers of AIDS, Kenyan truck drivers, 
caught in the trap of poverty and insecurity, are among 
those considered most at risk [p. 38].

However, there are signs of hope. Following the example 
set by Thailand [p. 40] several countries have introduced 
policies that have served to brake the spread of the disease. 
The diversification of prevention techniques has also 
paid dividends. From Delhi to Rio and Abidjan, popular 
television series based on AIDS help to relay information 
about the virus and the different problems it raises [p. 43]. 
Antiretroviral treatments are also giving new momentum 
to prevention efforts, in that they offer a new perspective 
to AIDS sufferers and encourage people to get tested. 
Eight years ago, Brazil implemented a policy of universal 
access to treatments, and the rate of new infections is now 
falling [p. 46]. 
But the battle is far from won. The World Health 
Organization and UNAIDS predict that unless prevention 
efforts are not dramatically increased, the number 
of or AIDS-infected people around the world will reach 
45 million by 2010.

VACCINE FOR HIV/AIDS 
Conceived and prepared by Agnes Bardon 
 
    
A SOCIAL DISEASE 
Unknown 20 years ago, AIDS is now the number one 
cause of death among young adults in the world. The 
evolution of the epidemic has consistently exceeded the most f ous 
pessimistic predictions. Today almost 40 million people are 
infected and AIDS orphans number more than 13 million. 
In the absence of a vaccine or a treatment that can 29 
cure the disease, prevention remains the best antidote. 
WHO estimates that two-thirds of infections likely to 
occur between now and 2010 can be avoided if prevention 
strategies are reinforced. Much has already been done. Many 
countries have integrated AIDS education in school curricula.   Millions of dollars have been invested in projects aimed at 
high-risk populations and campaigns for the general public. 
According to WHO, The city of Paris recently put up posters showing a tourist 
- Y nearly two-thirds on a beach, surrounded by exotic beauties. Almost a banal 
“ - of new infections souvenir postcard, except that the floral wreath he wears 
\ . likely between now around his neck is a funeral wreath. 
Mis, \ and 2010 could be Despite all these efforts, ignorance about HIV/AIDS and 
’ Bs . . avoided with better its means of transmission remains daunting. In Mali, Benin 
- WIE prevention and Haiti, 40% of young girls do not know how to protect 
themselves. (DHS, 1998-2002). Even people who are the 
most exposed often continue to deny the gravity of the 
disease. More than 90% of Haitian adolescents, for instance, 
think that the risk of their contracting the virus is low or 
even non-existent, when the country has one of the highest 
rates of the disease after sub-Saharan Africa (UNAIDS). 
MISINFORMATION 
Furthermore, inaccurate ideas about the virus and 
stigmatization of patients continue to flourish, even in 
developed countries. A study carried out in the US in 2000 
shows that 40% of those questioned think they can be 
contaminated by sharing a glass of water with someone who 
has AIDS, or by his cough (UNAIDS). In these conditions, 
the recommendations adopted by the United Nations General 
Assembly in June 2001 in the wake of the Millennium 
Summit seem practically unattainable. It is difficult to see 
how 90% of young people aged 15 to 24 will gain access, 
between now and 2005, to information and education and 
reduce their vulnerability to the virus. >

UNESCO | the new Courier | October 2004 
> To explain the failure to halt the spread of the 
epidemic, many have criticized the approach 
taken thus far as too moralistic, too simplistic, 
and not taking into account the pathology’s 
singular aspects. Experience has proved that mere 
information is not sufficient to change sexual 
behaviour. “We reacted to AIDS as we did to any 
public health problem, with the same rational 
information campaigns,” regrets Mary Crewe, 
director of the Centre for the Study of AIDS at the 
University of Pretoria (South Africa). “It’s not a 
disease like other diseases. We should have tried 
to better understand what governs sexuality and 
desire.” 
Others also deplore the fact that emphasis 
was systematically put on changing individual 
behaviour rather than focusing on the disease’s 
social ramifications. “AIDS was long considered 
from a simply medical angle, without taking 
into account the social context in which it 
was developing,” analyzes Michael J. Kelly, 
former professor at the University of Zambia 
and a specialist on the relationship between 
HIV/AIDS and education. The virus, which is 
now primarily transmitted through heterosexual 
contact, infiltrates society through its weaknesses,

striking the most vulnerable: the poor, women, 
ethnic minorities, migrants, youths. “AIDS takes 
advantage of war, lack of education, gender 
inequality. It is truly a social disease,” stresses 
Alexandra Draxler, programme specialist at the 
International Institute for Educational Planning 
(IEP). 
NO MAGIC BULLET 
FOR PREVENTION 
Experience does prove that prevention can work, 
but only under certain conditions. “There’s no 
magic bullet. We know that in order to get results, 
a policy of prevention has to work in several 
directions at the same time and be advocated 
by political leaders, health services, school and 
civil society,” explains Peter Aggleton, Dean of 
Research and Consultancy at London University’s 
Institute of Education and HIV/AIDS specialist. 
If a country as highly affected as Uganda has 
succeeded in significantly reducing the epidemic, 
it is because efforts were supported by political 
will at the highest level. The instituting of 
rigorous epidemiological controls, the mass 
distribution of condoms, the absence of taboo 
about the disease, and the commitment of

political, community and religious leaders all 
contributed to the policy’s success. 
School also emerges as a key factor in the 
fight against the virus, among other reasons 
because the 15-24 age group is the first to be 
hit. According to estimates, nearly half of new 
infections occur among young people under the 
age of 24, while statistics indicate that attending 
school decreases the risk of infection. A study 
conducted in Africa and Latin America shows 
that girls who have had schooling have their first 
sexual relations later and are more likely to insist 
that their partner use condoms (UNAIDS). In 
contrast, young people who have had little of no 
education are 2.2 times more likely to contract 
the virus than those who have finished primary 
school (World Bank). 
The influence of school is such that experts 
often refer to the “education vaccine”. It is not 
only because AIDS information is available in 
schools. In a more general way, education gives 
young adults greater self-confidence and control 
over their lives. “School is a very effective 
social protection. It gives students the ability 
to process information they receive but also to 
become more empowered and independent,

knowledge and attitudes necessary to limit the 
impact of the virus, by working with ministries, 
NGOs and experts as well as teachers. The idea 
is to make sure that the message fits the targeted 
audience as closely as possible. “Social values, 
religion, family relationships all determine how a 
message will be interpreted. A campaign based on 
the idea of death will not have the same impact 
in a Christian country and a society that believes 
in reincarnation,” underlines Helena Drobna, 
assistant specialist for UNESCO’s Programme on 
Cultural Approach to HIV/AIDS. 
Access to the new antiretroviral treatments is 
also an essential factor in prevention. Accordingly, 
one part of UNESCO’s strategy is devoted to 
access to care and education about treatment.

» While no cure is available at present, existing 
drugs do increase life expectancy and quality of 
life for people infected with HIV/AIDS, and can 
incite those who have doubts about their HIV 
status to get tested. When treatment exists, an 
increase in consultations and voluntary testing is 
noted in many regions, according to WHO’s most 
recent World Health Report. 
Nearly 6 million people currently need 
antiretroviral drugs. In 2003, only 400,000 of them 
received them. The “3 million by 2005” initiative 
launched by WHO to increase the number of 
patients receiving treatment is a tough challenge 
for the finances of countries and the international

Mary Joy Pigozzi is director of the Division for the Promotion of Quality Education. 
To what extent does HIV/AIDS affect the goals of 
Education for All? 
HIV/AIDS is perhaps the biggest challenge in the 
face of EFA goals. The impact of the pandemic on 
schools is certainly much more extensive than we 
ever imagined. It affects the supply, the demand 
and the quality of education. In the most afflicted 
countries, teachers are often in the high-risk social 
groups. And as for the pupils, the regularity of their 
school attendance is notably reduced if they are 
infected by the virus, or if someone in their family is. 
Because then they have to work to help support their 
families. And on top of that, schools are not free from 
the discrimination exercised against people who are 
affected by HIV/AIDS. 
At the same time, education remains the most 
effective means of preventing the disease. We can 
hope that this crisis situation the epidemic has 
caused, which is having disastrous effects on the 
institution, can also serve in the long run to bring 
UNESCO | the new Courier | October 2004 
about a reform of schools, for instance by promoting 
peer teaching, better adaptation of schedules to the 
rhythm of children’s lives, particularly in rural zones, 
or by acting to prevent discrimination. 
The last UNAIDS report shows that the epidemic, 
instead of decreasing, is continually growing. In this 
context, what action should UNESCO take? 
To eliminate the disease, it is not enough to advise 
people not to have sexual relations, or to use 
condoms. More in-depth work is needed. That is 
why UNESCO is pursuing its strategy of prevention 
education. And that means not only delivering a 
prevention message, but also inciting people to think 
about their lives and to make the right decisions. It 
involves teacher training, integration of HIV/AIDS- 
related issues in school curricula, and consideration 
of the social context in which the epidemic develops. 
Human rights, gender and poverty issues are crucial 
in understanding the disease. UNESCO also has a

role to play in treatment education. 
Furthermore, as part of its cooperation with UNAIDS, UNESCO 
has launched a new initiative that consists of providing 
education ministries with a “tool kit” of methods that have been 
tested and can be adapted to different contexts and countries. 
This presupposes, however, political will at the highest level. 
What can be done when the political will is lacking? 
When political leaders are elected, voters have a chance to act. 
What is essential, in all cases, is to succeed in breaking the 
silence. The Ugandan government has done this very effectively. 
It is an example to countries most affected by the virus. The 
media also has an important role to play. Everyone has to be 
made aware that HIV/AIDS is not somebody else’s problem. Very 
often, people start to feel concerned only when the disease hits 
those close to them. We have to get the message across before 
the situation becomes that dire.

Women are not only 
more vulnerable 33 
to the disease

( any of my friends would be 
alive today if they’d been 
as lucky as me,” Angeline 
Mugwendere states bluntly. A 24-year-old woman 
from Zimbabwe, now head of an organization that 
assists young women in rural areas, she knows she 
is privileged. An NGO paid her school fees, giving 
her access to secondary education. Some of her 
friends had no other choice but to give in to the 
advances of “sugar daddies”, older and wealthier, to 
finance their studies. That was how several of them 
contracted the virus. 
Such stories are tragically commonplace. Ten 
years ago, women were less affected by the 
disease than men, but the trend has reversed 
in certain regions. In sub-Saharan Africa, 58% 
of the 29.4 million people now living with 
HIV/AIDS are women. The risk of infection for 
young African women is 2.5% per cent higher >

than for men. More vulnerable biologically - the 
risk of contamination from a man to a woman 
is estimated at twice that of a woman to a man 
- they are also more vulnerable socially. 
The reason: in societies where men are 
dominant, women have little freedom of choice. 
“Young women like me who grow up in rural 
areas learn to be quiet and obedient, to work on 
the farm and around the house, to get married 
early and have children. That kind of education 
considerably reduces their capacity to negotiate 
with men,” confirms Angeline Mungwendere. 
Marriage does not protect them. Many women are 
infected by their husbands or steady boyfriends. 
A recent study conducted in Zimbabwe shows 
that only 11 % of the women questioned thought 
they had the right to ask their husband to use a 
condom, even when the husband was unfaithful 
and HIV-positive. 
PROGRAMMES NEED TO ADAPT 
TO WOMEN'S SITUATION 
Yet prevention programmes have taken a long 
time to address women’s specific problems. “Most 
of them are based on abstinence, fidelity and use 
of condoms. These are not realistic options for 
women,” says Sally Smith of the Global Coalition 
on Women and AIDS, an initiative launched last 
February by UNAIDS. The result is that rumours 
and myths about how the virus is transmitted 
persist. In Cambodia and Vietnam, 50% of 
women between the ages of 15 and 24 believe 
that a mosquito bite can cause infection. 
UNESCO | the new Courier | October 2004 
 
Most prevention 
programmes 
In that context, education remains the best aimed at women 
antidote. Women who know how to read and recommend 
write are three times more likely than illiterate abstinence, fidelity 
women to know that a healthy-looking person can and using condoms 
be carrying the virus, and four times more likely 
to know how to protect themselves from AIDS 
(UNAIDS, World Bank, 2002). 
Science may also provide another part of the 
solution. For the last several years, scientists 
have been working on developing vaginal 
microbicides. In the form of gel, lubricant or 
suppositories, these products could give women 
more control of their sexuality, despite the fact 
that they are apparently only 60% effective. But 
funds are lacking. “Research in this area is cruelly 
underfinanced,” says Sally Smith. US $775 million 
are needed to test existing products, and only US 
$343 million have been allocated. 
Such an investment, however, seems crucial. 
In its 2004 report “Changing History” the 
World Health Organization warns that women’s 
disproportionate mortality rate is leading to an 
imbalance in the adult population, with as-yet 
unforeseen consequences. |i

According to the 2004 UNAIDS report, Russia 
is one of the countries where the epidemic 
is spreading the fastest. The number of new

of the disease continues to be widely 
underestimated.

Maria’s attitude is by no means unusual.

workers and prisoners. The picture, however, is 
changing, and faster than officials can cope with.

» quadrupled from 5% in 2001 to 20% in 2003. The 
overcrowded conditions many city people live in, 
added to poverty and a prevailing sense of despair 
among the poorest, explain the progression to a 
certain degree. Fatal ignorance about the infection 
also contributes. According to certain studies, 
fewer than 60% of sexually active people think 
Y that condoms provide protection from the virus. 
f GeCUS More women are becoming infected and as a 
result the number of mother-to-child infections 
has sharply escalated. And with a dire working 
class economic problem still predominant, 
prostitution is increasing almost as rapidly as the 
infection. Encouraging men to wear condoms 
doesn’t appear to be a major priority either in a 
nation where condom use has traditionally been 
low and sex education frowned upon by both the 
Orthodox Church and parents. 
HIGHEST RATE OF NEW INFECTIONS 
CURRENTLY IN RUSSIA 
Still, it is infection rates amongst intravenous 
drug users which remains most worrisome: the 
annual growth rate of drug users is 5% and 
their number is currently estimated at between 
2 and 2 and a half million people. Meanwhile, 
substitute drugs such as Methadone are illegal in 
Russia, and doctors are often quoted saying that 
installing dispensers for sterile syringes would 
only encourage drug abuse. 
It is hardly surprising, therefore, that UNAIDS 
claims the former Soviet republics have the 
highest growth of HIV infections in any part of the 
world today. Indeed, the US National Intelligence 
Council, which advises the US President, believes 
that Russia could have 8 million new HIV 
infections in the next decade. That would equal 
10% of the Russian workforce. 
Yet only 280,000 HIV and AIDS cases are 
registered officially in Russia, though the figure 
is probably much, much higher. According to 
Vadim Pokrovsky, Federal AIDS Centre official 
and a long-time AIDS activist, it is close to 1 
million. With negative population growth in 
Russia since the collapse of the Soviet state, the 
economic impact of the AIDS epidemic will be 
UNESCO | the new Courier | October 2004 
 
acutely felt. Not only will the virus cause loss in 
human capital and productivity: the annual cost 
of retrovirals will impact heavily on the health 
budget. The World Bank estimates that treatment 
costs are unsustainable at current prices (World 
Bank, Russia Office, 2002). 
The key to lowering infection rates is education. 
But as Pokrovsky notes: “We spend $1 million 
per year on awareness programs. We should be 
spending $70 million.” 
A Russian doctor, trained in epidemiology, 
told me anonymously that there is virtually no 
information on the virus available to the medical 
profession. “People walk through the door every 
day with AIDS-like symptoms and a lot of the 
time doctors at my polyclinic don’t recognize that 
the person they are looking at is HIV positive. 
They just treat the symptoms. Anyway, even if 
they knew, what could they prescribe?” said this 
dispirited doctor.

Although pessimism is never in short supply in 
Russia, what is called for in the fight against AIDS

Few would disagree. Not even office worker 
Maria. But harnessing minds - and with them,

close to the shops and the bars with the garish 
signs, women aged 16 to 35 hang around, on the 
lookout for a potential client. 
In Kenya, on the only road that links Mombasa 
to Busia, there are no less than a dozen towns 
like Naivasha. For the drivers, far from home 
for weeks on end, the street women are a great 
temptation. With dire epidemiological results. 
UNAIDS considers truck drivers a high-risk 
population and a significant vector for the spread 
of the virus. Kenya fits the pattern. The rate of 
infection is estimated at 40% among the drivers, 
compared to 12% in the general population. 
PREVENTION ON THE ROAD 
In Naivasha, nearly everyone is aware of the 
reality of AIDS. But they place the responsibility 
elsewhere. Drivers tend to blame the promiscuity 
of the prostitutes. “For three beers, you can buy 
a girl for half an hour. In one night, she might 
go with five drivers, so if she’s infected, it’s a 
disaster,” Joseph Marenya, a seasonal driver, calls 
out from the cab of his truck. 
As for the women, they talk about the drivers’ 
reluctance to use condoms. “After all those hours 
taking risks on the road, it’s another gamble for 
the Mambuyus (drivers). They don’t want to 
put on condoms. Some of them flatly refuse,” 
says Joyce Njambi, an adolescent who works in 
a beauty salon during the day and at night as a 
prostitute. “We know about prostitution and AIDS 
being dangerous,” adds another young girl, barely 
20, who calls herself Lucy. “But what does that 
mean compared to an empty stomach?” 
Initiatives have been launched to combat 
the problem. All along the truck routes, large 
billboards warn against the risk of AIDS and 
recall the means of protection. The government’s 
programme to fight against AIDS and control 
sexually transmissible diseases, NASCOP, has 
conducted several information campaigns aimed 
at truckers. The Kenya Long Distance Truck 
Drivers’ Union has also tried to draw its members’ 
attention to the risks of unprotected sex with 
prostitutes. It cooperates with an American NGO, 
Africans United Against Aids Globally (AUAAG), 
to set up prevention centres all along Kenya's key 
highways. Four reception centres have already 
opened on the Nairobi-Mombasa route. Drivers 
can pick up information brochures, advice and 
free condoms. 
The campaigns, however, are slow in achieving 
results. Though drivers are generally informed 
about the disease, a number of them continue to 
ignore it. Besides, the miserable pay and dreadful 
working conditions inflicted by the trucking 
companies keep drivers in a precarious state 
that also nurtures the epidemic. “It’s a long- 
term campaign,” admits the head of NASCOP, 
Dr Kenneth Chebet, “but it will pay off in the 
long run.” 
Hands covered in cement dust, Rashid Ahmed 
is ready to take to the road again with his load. 
“You can’t prevent men in their prime from 
having sex on the road,” he says. “You have to 
give them condoms, force information on them, 
make them realize the part they play in spreading 
AIDS. It’s the only way.”

Using draconian methods, Thai 
authorities managed to reduce the 
epidemic in rather spectacular 
fashion. But warning signals seem 
to be flashing again. 
orting a perpetual grin, Khun likes to make 
conversation as he drives his songthaew, 
a collective taxi that cruises the streets of 
Chiang Mai, second largest city in the country 
about 800 kilometres from Bangkok. A cheerful 
man, unfazed by the suffocating heat that weighs 
on the city at the start of the rainy season or by the 
uninterrupted roar of traffic, Khun is telling the story 
of his life. His life before, when he was a dishwasher 
in a London hotel, or his life now, with his wife, two 
daughters...and his mistresses. Khun confides that 
sometimes he has adventures. What about AIDS? In 
response he opens the glove compartment and takes 
out a box of condoms, hidden behind a jumble of 
music tapes and old papers. “I never go out without 
them,” he says, holding up the box. 
Khun, 43, is part of that generation of Thais

1980s and the beginning of the 1990s, the virus 
spread throughout the country at devastating 
speed, particularly in the northern region, which 
remains the most affected by the disease. In 1988, 
the percentage of drug addicts infected with the 
virus went from 0 to 30% in six months. Just in 
Chiang Mai, a 1989 study showed that 44% of 
the prostitutes were HIV-positive. In 1991, at the 
height of the epidemic, 143,000 new infections 
were counted in the country’s population of 
62 million. 
TOUGH TACTICS TO HALT 
INFECTION 
Starting in 1991, Thai authorities reacted 
vigorously to the crisis. Owners of brothels, 
nightclubs, hotels used by prostitutes and 
massage parlours were ordered to impose the use 
of condoms, or risk having their businesses closed 
down. At the same time, ads about the dangers of 
the virus and how to be protected against it were 
aired constantly on radio and TV. “If the strategy 
worked, it was because commitment at the 
highest level of government was behind it, relayed

in the community by numerous actors, from 
policemen to military to NGOs,” adds Sompong 
Charoensuk, country programme adviser of 
UNAIDS in Bangkok. 
Consequently, the number of new infections 
was divided by six, reaching 23,673 in 2002. And 
people’s behavior evolved, in a country where 
men tend to have extramarital affairs. The use of 
condoms during paid sexual relations rose from 
14% in 1989 to more than 90% five years later. 
Another example, the percentage of enlisted men 
patronizing prostitutes dropped from 60% in 1991 
to 25% in 1995. For all these reasons, Thailand 
was held up as a model in the region, particularly 
in comparison with some of its neighbours, like 
India, where the virus is spreading at an explosive 
rate. UNAIDS considers Thailand as one of the 
few success stories in the fight against the disease. 
BUDGET CUTS 
Yet while the statistics are undeniable, the 
practical reality is more ambiguous. First because 
the economic crisis that struck Asia in 1997 
provoked serious cuts in the budget allocated to 
In ten years, the 
number of new 
infections has been

Left: in the early 
1990s, owners 
of prostitution 
establishments were 
ordered to require 
the use of condoms 
fighting AIDS. Many organizations had to close 
down for lack of funding. The distribution of free 
condoms in places of prostitution was suspended. 
And the effects of slackened effort in prevention 
are being keenly felt. The Ministry of Education, 
despite its crucial role in prevention, has limited 
involvement. “Teachers are expected to teach 
prevention in the classroom, but either because 
they are shy or they lack training, they often 
don’t,” explains Alice Schmidt, from the UNESCO 
office in Bangkok. “And if they’ve all heard of the 
virus, some very high-level education officials 
know very little about the disease.”

exemplary case is being called into question by 
some. “The numbers concerning new infections 
are seriously underestimated,” according to 
the head of an NGO who prefers to remain 
anonymous. “And men around here continue to 
think that using a condom is an insult to their 
manhood.” 
Now considered among the new high-risk 
categories are young people, homosexuals and 
drug addicts, as well as ethnic minorities and 
migrants. “In my country, Myanmar, many 
villagers go seek their fortune in the big cities of 
Thailand,” says Muang, a young Buddhist monk 
from the state of Shan. “When some of them 
return, they die of malaria or tuberculosis. They 
don’t know they are carrying the virus.” 
DISCRIMINATION AGAINST 
AIDS PATIENTS 
Muang is in Chang Mai to attend a three-day 
workshop on AIDS. In the old Wat Pa Pao temple, 
sheltered from the noise and incessant bustle of 
the city, some 30 monks and novices are silently 
taking notes. On the blackboard is a drawing of 
a ship. Aboard are pregnant women, workers, 
prostitutes, drug addicts, migrants and children. 
The question the monks are given to ponder: if 
there is a storm, who should be the first to be 
thrown overboard? The prevention work done by 
the Sangha Metta project, the NGO organizing

chronic. Cases of employees fired or students 
expelled because they are HIV-positive are not 
rare. “Stigmatization is less pronounced in rural 
areas that are heavily affected by the disease, 
simply because it’s become a daily reality,” 
explains Gareth Lavell, director of the Rejoice 
Urban Development Projects, an organization 
that distributes drugs to people who are ill. “But 
in cities, the number of schools that will take 
an HIV-positive child can be counted on one 
hand.” On the eve of the 15th International AIDS 
Conference in Bangkok last July, a 4-star hotel in

positive were asked to take their meals separately. 
Yet with the support of the statistics, Thai 
authorities continue to defend their country’s 
success. “Thailand is still today a very good 
example of what can be done to stop the 
epidemic,” insists Sompong Charoensuk. Only 
as long, however, as prevention efforts continue, 
particularly in regard to young people. Otherwise, 
Thailand may cease to be a good example.

Young and seductive, members of the post-apartheid 
society, the characters of the series “Soul City” know 
the pitfalls of love and betrayal. But what really 
sets this soap opera apart is that on the fringes of 
the usual romance novel plot, it brings up serious 
issues, the most prominent being AIDS. In this case,

she is HIV-positive. Initially, he is shocked by the

Since it was first aired in 1994, “Soul City” has 
known unflagging popularity. Every week more 
than 13 million viewers, most of them black, are 
glued to their screens. And yet the series was 
invented not by a screenwriter or a network, but 
by an NGO. The production and creative aspects 
are the work of a private television company, 
but the content is defined by the eminently 
serious Institute for Health and Development 
Communication (IHDC). 
“Every episode takes a great deal of 
preparation,” explains Sue Goldstein, director 
of research at IHDC. “We organize outside 
discussion groups on a regular basis, preferably in 
underprivileged areas. That’s where we identify 
issues. Then we work with the producers and

Once the script has been written, it is presented 
to discussion groups, community activists and 
people living with HIV for further assessment. 
The result is a high level of realism that mixed 
with a skilfully concocted romantic intrigue 
has succeeded in attracting millions of regular 
viewers. 
A HIT WITH VIEWERS 
“Soul City ”is not the only TV series to blend 
education and entertainment. In the last several 
years, fiction has increasingly been used to 
communicate messages about prevention, with 
unexpected ratings success. In India, the series 
“Jasoos Vijay”, aired every Sunday night for the 
last two years, is now one of the most watched 
TV shows in the country. The detective Jasoos 
Vijay is typically brave, he likes action, he flirts 
with his pretty female partner and he always 
gets the bad guy. This hero, who is very popular 
in India’s rural areas, does have one unusual 
characteristic for the genre: he is HIV-positive. 
In Brazil, homeland of the telenovela, AIDS has 
also made its appearance in certain soap operas. 
“Malhacao”, show for young audiences, increased 
UNESCO | the new Courier | October 2004 
its ratings after one of the adolescents in the 
series found out that he was HIV-positive. 
Popular as they are, television series are an 
excellent means of conveying information, 
particularly because they do not address the 
rational part of our personalities. “Issues that have 
to do with love and sex depend on very complex 
emotional processes,” explains Sue Goldstein. 
“It is not enough to tell people ‘you have to use 
condoms’ to make them do it. But a series can 
explore sexual questions in all their emotional 
complexity.” Programs of this kind elicit strong 
feelings of identification with the characters 
and situations, adds Mary Myers, independent 
consultant in communication development and 
author of a study on the topic. “This identification 
facilitates discussion and can help bring about 
changes in behaviour.” 
There is evidence that these shows have 
impact. In Japan, while the series “Kamisama Mo 
Sukoshidake” was on the air, portraying a female 
student who becomes infected with the virus 
after prostituting herself, the number of HIV tests 
doubled. Another example: a poll of TV viewers in 
Cote d’Ivoire showed that those who had watched 
at least ten episodes of the series “Sida dans la

xplosive. That was the word to describe the 
Eo epidemic in Brazil. In 1992, the World 
Bank predicted that the number of cases 
would exceed one million in the year 2000. The 
demographic growth of Brazil, a country of nearly 
170 million people, heightened fears of an epidemic 
comparable to that sweeping Africa. But while 
Brazil is one of the countries in Latin America that 
has been hardest hit by the disease, with more than 
600,000 people living with HIV, the numbers are far 
below the catastrophic forecasts made 10 years ago. 
The country has even become a point of reference 
for numerous developing countries in the throes 
of the epidemic. The daring policy adopted by the 
authorities in Brasilia - based on active prevention 
campaigns and, since 1996, the free distribution

of anti-retroviral drugs to those who are sick - has 
turned out to be particularly effective. 
Currently, 140,000 Brazilians, or nearly all of 
those who are aware that they have the disease, 
are receiving free medication. Result: the AIDS- 
related death rate has been cut in half since 1997. 
And contrary to what some people feared, the 
widespread access to treatment has not had an 
adverse effect on prevention. The number of new 
HIV infections stood at 22,000 in 2003, down from 
25,000 in the 1990s. In addition, the incidence of 
high-risk behavior has dropped. For example, the 
percentage of soldiers who use a condom when 
having sex with a paid partner increased from 69 
percent in 1999 to 77 percent in 2002.

### 137756: Shock therapy in Brazil

Since 1997, Brazil 
has been producing 
generic versions of 
anti-retroviral drugs 
that are not, or no 
longer, patented 
today and not pay attention to treatment issues. 
It makes no sense to convince people to be 
careful if you don’t treat those who are sick,” says 
Alexandre Granjeiro, the national coordinator 
of Brazil's program to fight AIDS and sexually 
transmitted diseases (STDs), which is overseen 
by the country’s health ministry. However, 
implementing such an innovative policy did not 
come easily. From 1997, Brazil began producing 
generic versions of anti-retroviral drugs that were 
not, or were no longer, protected by patents. For 
the treatments still under patent protection, the 
government battled it out with the world’s major 
pharmaceutical groups to obtain price cuts of 40 
to 70 percent. 
400 MILLION CONDOMS 
Meanwhile, prevention efforts were not neglected. 
Brazil distributes the most free condoms of any 
country in the world. Each year, the government 
offers some 400 million condoms to prison 
inmates, drug addicts, young people and military 
recruits. Beyond efforts targeting transsexuals, 
prostitutes, homosexuals and truck drivers, 
the health ministry runs a major nationwide 
awareness campaign three times a year. Two years 
ago, one television ad showed a guardian angel 
waiting for a young man to come home from a 
night out at Carnaval. Annoyed, the guardian 
angel told the young partygoer that he could not 
protect him from all his mistakes, and that he 
could certainly do nothing for him if he failed 
to use a condom. “Our policy is based on two 
ideas. The first aims to make information about 
HIV/AIDS widely available, the second aims to 
drive home the idea that using a condom is the 
most effective way to prevent infection,” explains 
Alexandre Granjeiro. 
But Brazil's success is also due to the 
mobilization of non-governmental organizations 
(NGOs). “This dynamic approach was a deciding 
factor because civil society can reach people that 
the government is not used to dealing with. And it 
so happens that in Brazil, as opposed to in other 
countries where they have to fight for their rights, 
transsexuals, prostitutes and homosexuals are 
very organized,” explains Cristina Raposo, who 
runs the AIDS programs at the UNESCO office in 
Brasilia. 
The lack of taboos about sex in Brazilian society 
was also a definite plus. With UNESCO’s help, 
the government recently launched a pilot program 
to hand out condoms in high schools. The goal 
is that by 2006, some 2.5 million teenagers will 
have access to them. Elsewhere, such an initiative 
would have caused a major stir. In Brazil, no one 
said anything at all.

« we hold to 
nN the vision of a 
universal project compatible 
with the multiplicity of our 
heritages and enriched by their 
interwoven histories?” This 
is one of the key questions 
addressed in this second 
anthology originating from 
UNESCOQ’s “21st century Talks”, 
orchestrated by Jérome Bindé, 
Director of UNESCO's Division 
of Foresight, Philosophy and 
Human Sciences and Deputy 
Assistant Director-General for 
the Social Sciences Sector. 
It brings together about 50 
renowned scientists, researchers 
and thinkers from a range of 
disciplines - legal experts, 
anthropologists, astrophysicists, 
historians, sociologists, biologist, 
geneticists, linguists, writers, 
psychoanalysts and philosophers 
- who set out to redefine and 
anticipate tomorrow’s values, 
and reflect on the direction these 
values may lead humanity. 
The volume is divided into 
four chapters: The Future of 
Values, Globalization, New 
technologies and Culture; 
Towards New Social Contracts?; 
and Science, Knowledge 
and Foresight: Each section 
THE FUTURE OF VALUES 
comprises a series of articles that 
can be read separately. But the 
publication is more than a series 
of brilliant presentations. It has 
its own logic and structure, 
which only reveals itself when 
the book is taken as a whole. 
The Future of Values is also 
an example, par excellence, of 
UNESCO's role to serve as a 
forum for ethical discussion. 
“At the dawn of the twenty-first 
century,” writes Jérdme Bindé 
in his introduction, “at a time 
when attempts to reappropriate 
values seem to have foundered 
— whether in relation to 
revolutionary schemes of 
political emancipation or 
ventures into the realm of 
philosophical, spiritual, 
ideological or political renewal; 
when certain prophets of doom 
are proclaiming the advent of 
‘post-humanity’, not to say 
of the inhuman; when tragic 
events leave us disoriented 
and discredit the hypothesis 
of the ‘end of History’; and 
when societies are mobilized 
in the search for new ethical 
codes, UNESCO could not 
fail to address the question 
of the future of values from a 
forward-looking philosophical 
standpoint.”

THE CHALLENGE OF 
INDIGENOUS EDUCATION: 
PRACTICE AND 
PERSPECTIVES 
This book describes the 
challenges facing both the 
providers of education for 
indigenous peoples and 
indigenous communities 
themselves. 
Part I of this study reflects 
upon the challenges and 
obstacles facing indigenous 
education, the situation of 
indigenous peoples with 
regard to education, aspects 
of the political and legal 
context, prospects and general 
objectives. Part II develops a set 
of criteria for the identification 
of successful examples 
of quality education for 
indigenous peoples, illustrated 
by some relevant experiences. 
Part III presents case studies 
of programmes and initiatives 
of quality education from 
different regions of the world. 
This book offers insights for 
policy makers, researchers 
and all those concerned with 
educational provision.

UNESCO TOOLKIT OF LEARNING 
AND TEACHING MATERIALS 
The toolkit consists of two companion volumes — Solar 
Photovoltaic Systems: Technical Training Manual and Solar 
Photovoltaic Project Development. 
The overall objective of this toolkit is to provide 
comprehensive training material on the innovation, 
application, installation, operation, monitoring and 
evaluation, management maintenance and rehabilitation 
of PV systems as well as providing useful information for 
advocacy, awareness raising, innovation, policy and planning. 
It contains comprehensive technical, educational and 
geographical coverage. It provides a complete course in PV 
applications for rural electrification at three levels: instructor, 
senior technician and field technician. 
This toolkit is based on experience gained in the Pacific, 
where solar photovoltaics and rural electrification were 
pioneered in the 1970s and 1980s.
