The Taino indians, a peaceful farming people whose culture flourished in 
the Greater Antilles between the 10th and 15th century AD, created an art 
which is today recognized as one of the richest and earliest forms of pre- 
Columbian expression. This stone head (22 cm high) from Macorix, in 
what is today the Dominican Republic, is a zem/, a representation of one 
of the ancestral spirits or magical forces which, the Taino believed, con- 
trolled different aspects of nature. These spirits were invoked by the chief 
or shaman to provide such benefits as health, rain, or fertility. Unable to 
defend themselves and vulnerable to new diseases, the Taino scon 
became extinct after the European conquest, but some vestiges of their 
art still persist today.

I. ‘IT GROWS BUT DOES 
NOT GROW OLD’ 
of the city of Sofia, capital of 
Bulgaria, "It grows but does not 
grow old”, seems an apt summary of the 
history of a vigorous modern State which 
this year celebrates the 1300th anniversary 
of its foundation by khan Asparukh in the 
year 681, 
Between the 6th and 9th centuries of our 
era, when the mix of populations brought 
about by the great migrations from east to 
west and north to south was reshaping 
Europe (as well as Asia and North Africa), 
giving it the ethnic, linguistic and cultural 
features it has to this day, the fertile lands 
between the Danube and the Aegean and 
between the Black Sea and the Adriatic 
were undergoing fundamental changes. The 
former Roman provinces of Thrace and II- 
lyria were breaking away from the Eastern 
Roman or Byzantine empire, and thereafter 
Byzantium'’s influence in these lands was to 
be mainly cultural. 
After successive waves of invasions, Slav 
tribes settled in the region in increasing 
numbers during the 6th and 7th centuries. 
Then came warriors of Turanian origin—the 
Proto-Bulgarians—from the plains of the 
Dnieper and the Volga. Bulgaria's cha- 
racteristic personality and culture stem from 
T: motto inscribed in the coat of arms 
  
In modern Bulgaria the ancient past is 
seldom more than a step away. In 
Varna, formerly Odessos, a flourishing 
port and holiday resort on the Black 
Sea, many features of the ancient 
Graeco-Roman city have been 
integrated into the streets and squares 
of the modern city, left. In Sofia, 
above, children on their way to school 
have living contact with history in this 
small exhibition room arranged by the 
City of Sofia History Museum in one of 
the capital's pedestrian subways, which 
is itself part of an old Roman road. 
the fusion of these two peoples: the first 
gave the country its language, the 
second its name. 
But though these events played a decisive 
role in the history of the country and in the 
development of its culture, the modern 
Bulgarians do not forget their more distant 
Thracian past to which they consider 
themselves heirs, This past is so rich and 
monuments from all periods are so 
numerous—more than 31,000 have been 
listed and protected in the 110,911 square 
kilometres of the national territory — that at 
the same time as the country builds for the 
future it is in daily contact with the relics of 
its earliest ancestors. History is part of con- 
temporary life and prehistory is more in 
evidence here than in most other parts of 
the world. 
Cereal cultivation began in these ter- 
ritories more than eight thousand years ago 
and the remains of early farming com- 
munities are numerous and conspicuous, 
Mounds or tells formed by the remains of 
successive building levels testify to the 
lasting nature of the settlements. Most 
Bulgarian towns are built on superimposed 
layers of ruins and archaeological deposits. 
One of the most famous of these tells, 
discovered near the village of Karanovo in 
the southern department of Nova Zagora, 
has attracted considerable interest in scien- 
tific circles: it is twelve metres high and its 
deepest layer dates from the early Neolithic 
period in the sixth millennium before our 
era, while the top layer belongs to the Iron 
Age. An archaeological cross-section shows 
that generation followed generation on this 
site—one above the other down the ages. 
The Karanovo excavations have yielded a 
rich crop of relics: tools, weapons and uten- 
sils of various kinds which today fill rooms in 
several museums. 
Another remarkable find is the Copper 
Age or Chalcolithic necropolis of Varna on 
the Black Sea coast. There archaeologists 
have uncovered a series of tombs built at the 
end of the fourth millennium and containing 
hundreds of gold objects, from tiny beads to 
bracelets weighing 200 to 300 grammes. A 
particularly interesting feature is the 
presence of gold sceptres in two of the 
tombs. These symbols of established power 
show that even in those far-off times this 
corner of south-eastern Europe already had 
a firmly-founded tradition of sovereignty 
and a fairly complex social structure. 
How this happened is still a mystery. One 
possible explanation is that copper, which 
was mined in the area at that time, probably 
gave rise to extensive exchanges with the 
countries of nearby Asia Minor. Trade, 
therefore, may well have been a source of 
progress and prosperity for these miners 
who buried so much gold with their dead 
and whom archaeologists today regard as 
the ancestors of the Thracians. 
The Thracians are the oldest people 
whose name is known in south-eastern 
Europe. Remnants of their language—which 
belonged to the same branch of Indo- 
European as Greek and Latin—are to be 
found in inscriptions and the names of 
towns, mountains and rivers. The Thracians 
occupied an important place in the literature 
of neighbouring peoples. During the 
classical period, from the 6th century BC on- 
wards, the Greeks often referred to Thracian 
influences on their mythology, religion and 
arts, especially music, It is only recently, 
however, that the general public has 
become acquainted with the Thracians, 
thanks to a fabulous exhibition of gold 
jewels, vessels and weapons which has 
toured several countries. Most of these ob- 
jects, some discovered by chance and some 
during systematic excavations, were found 
in the great tombs that testify to highly 
developed beliefs: faith in after-life, and 
perhaps the hope of union with the divine 
rather than of material survival, 
The dead were buried with their most 
precious possessions and the funerary 
chamber was covered with a mound of earth 
the size of which varied according to the 
rank and wealth of the deceased. Thus the 
Thracian lands were dotted with tumuli, 
most of which disappeared down the ages, 
though more than ten thousand still remain 
and are today protected against unauthoriz- 
ed excavations. They are the most 
characteristic features of the landscape in 
certain regions, as in the area of Plovdiv, for 
example, along the international motorway 
leading to Istanbul. 
One of these tumuli, in the department of 
Stara Zagora, contained the famous 
Kazanlak tomb whose wall-paintings dating 
from the 4th century before our era are of 
paramount importance to the history of art. 
The main mural depicts a funeral banquet 
and is characterized by the extreme finesse 
of the central figures, the prince and his 
wife, and especially by the tenderness and 
elegance of their parting gesture. No less 
remarkable are the figures of the parents and 
relatives of the deceased who are shown 
leading horses or bearing offerings. 
The Kazanlak tomb is among the 
monuments of exceptional importance 
which Unesco has included in its World 
Heritage List {see Unesco Courier, August 
1980). To avoid damage a replica of the 
tomb has been built nearby for the benefit of 
the thousands of tourists who visit the area 
every year. For Kazanlak is in the famous 
“Rose Valley” where field upon field of 
flowers flourishes in an exceptionally 
temperate climate, producing the attar or 
essential oil used in the manufacture of 
perfume. |

### 44690: Bulgaria: a modern nation salutes its past

Bulgaria 
II. 5,000 YEARS 
OF TOWN-PLANNING 
has brought to light the remains of the 
first sea-ports and relics of early naviga- 
tion on the Black Sea, including a number of 
stone anchors used in the late Bronze Age 
about twelve hundred years before our era. 
On their outward journeys, the Thracian 
ships carried cargoes of sheet copper; the 
goods they brought back enabled the 
coastal cities to become the country's 
earliest centres of maritime trade. 
I coastal districts underwater research 
So when Greek colonists settled on the 
Black Sea coast in the 6th century BC they 
found a string of flourishing Thracian cities. 
Before long they had imposed their own 
language, built theatres and introduced their 
own sculptors and potters; the towns in 
which they worked long continued to bear 
Greek names. The close relations the Greeks 
maintained with the Thracians were not only 
commercial. The two peoples exchanged 
customs and divinities and shared common 
festivals. Such cultural exchanges were 
often repeated down the centuries and have 
given Bulgaria its particular character. 
But cultural interchange and the legacy of 
antiquity were not limited to the coastal 
cities. More than half the Bulgarian towns 
are at least five thousand years old. Cities 
like Sofia, Plovdiv, Varna, Nessebur and 
Stara Zagora are in themselves monuments 
to the history of town-planning, and in many 
cases it has been possible to explore their ar- 
chaeological heritage deep down in the 
earth beneath the modern cities. 
In Sofia, for example, several acres of the 
city centre are built over cultural layers that 
are ten metres deep. This area was severely 
damaged by air raids in the Second World 
War and its replanning has brought to the 
fore the controversial problem of preserving 
archaeological remains in an urban setting. 
In Bulgaria the question has been settled 
once and for all. Every archaeological monu- 
ment that is brought to light is integrated in- 
to the modern environment in the most ap- 
propriate way. In Sofia, an underpass built 
between the new headquarters of the State 
Council and the Council of Ministers skirts 
the ancient city wall before passing through 
the eastern gate and following a 6th century 
street with marble flagstones bearing 
Roman inscriptions some four hundred 
years older. 
Further up the avenue, in the centre of 
another underpass, one can enjoy a cup of 
coffee opposite a tiny medieval church. 
Elsewhere the tram-lines skirt the corner 
tower of the city wall, and remains of 
another tower can be seen in the basement 
“of a department store. A new bank under 
construction has had to relinquish half of its 
basement to another section of the city wall, 
part of two 4th-century streets and the foun- 
dations of a 14th-century church. Opposite 
this bank, a big open space has been made 
over to the archaeologists pending the time 
when the architects draw up plans for 
safeguarding the remains. 
All these towns have found original ways 
of preserving their archaeological heritage.

a 
phitheatre discovered in an excellent state of 
preservation is to be used for dramatic per- 
formances; the ancient forum, naturally, is 
reserved for pedestrians and the ramparts 
circling the hills serve as supporting walls for 
houses of the 19th-century districts. At 
Stara Zagora (the ancient Augusta Trajana) 
Neolithic dwellings have been enclosed 
within the walls of a new museum; and a 
section of a district, including an am- 
phitheatre, baths and ancient streets, is to 
be preserved in its original state as an open- 
air museum, while other parts will be 
covered over or indicated by markings on 
the floor in the new buildings. Varna 
{Odessos) maintains "‘archaeological sec- 
tions’ within its new districts, and many 
features of the Graeco-Roman city plan are 
to be integrated into the modern streets and 
squares. 
There is only one way into Nessebur and 
that is through the ancient gate in the ram- 
parts. This small town on the Black Sea 
which still bears a Thracian name, Messem- 
bria, deserves more than any other the 
somewhat misused title of ‘living museum”. 
It is built on a tiny peninsula linked to the 
coast by a narrow neck of land, and was one 
of the main Thracian ports, A Dorian colony 
was established there in the 6th century and 
grew rich through maritime trade and farm- 
ing the fertile hinterland. Under. Roman 
domination Nessebur remained prosperous 
and subsequently became one of the Byzan- 
tine empire's chief ports. 
For centuries Bulgaria and Byzantium 
fought over this tiny strip of land surrounded 
by sea on all sides, and every time the penin- 
sula changed hands it was endowed with 
new monuments. The Italian republics, 
especially Genoa, also asserted their in- 
fluence at Nessebur, even after the Ottoman 
invasion. In spite of changing fortunes and 
the slow decline of its trade the city main- 
tained its vitality with the passing centuries 
and its inhabitants have kept the customs 
and independent spirit of a seafaring people. 
Today this ancient city in the heart of 
Bulgaria's most famous resort areas draws 
tens of thousands of tourists attracted by its 
monuments and its picturesque site, 
Among the masterpieces left here by 
three thousand years of civilization, the 
most impressive are the churches. The 
dozen that remain represent almost every 
stage of Christianity in this area, from the 
oldest built in the 5th century to the most re- 
cent at the end of the last century. Most of 
them, however, date from the 13th and 14th 
centuries and these are also the most in- 
teresting, both for their style and for the 
originality of the building techniques used in 
their construction. Small blocks of tufa 
alternate with rows of bricks to form an 
unusual kind of decoration. Details such as 
cornices, arches and niches are embellished 
with inlaid ceramic circles and four-leaved 
clover, so that the facades of the buildings 
shine in the sun like so many pieces of 
multicoloured embroidery. These vivid 
patches of colour contrast with the 
plain facades of the houses, whose wooden 
facing is weathered by sun and salt. 
In Nessebur as elsewhere in Bulgaria, 
modern life goes hand in hand both with dis- 
tant antiquity and with the Middle Ages. 
Workmen digging the foundations of a 
youth centre some years ago discovered the 
altar of a church which has long since disap- 
peared. It has been carefully preserved and 
incorporated into the new building where it 
is protected by a cement column and can be 
seen through a glass panel, In summer 
tourists attend concerts organized in the 
great 6th-century basilica. But the most 
persevering visitors are the archaeologists, 
historians and restorers whose patient work 
continues season after season. |

Washed over by successive tides of

more than half of which are over 5,000 
years old. constitute veritable chronicles in

comes face to face with past Roman 
glories, such as the fine amphitheatre and 
the ancient stadium (right), as well as the 
cobbled streets and 18th-century, timber- 
framed houses of the National Revival 
period (centre right) all carefully preserved

Nessebur. Its churches, the earliest dating 4 J — 
from the 5th century, are representative of or oy 
hi . ; : —— ou 
almost every stage in the history of a . 
Christianity in this region. Among the most’ 
outstanding examples are the great 6th- | 
century Basilica and the remarkable 13th

and tufa, their arches and cornices 
decorated with inlaid ceramics (photo

Many Bulgarian towns and villages have 
been protected and restored as part of a 
nation-wide campaign to safeguard the 
country’s cultural heritage. One such town 
is Koprivchtitza (right). Famed as the scene 
of the start of the ill-fated insurrection of 
April 1876 against the Ottoman Turks, it is 
noted for its well-preserved 19th-century 
houses with their richly ornamented fronts 
and sculpted wood ceilings. The museum- 
village of Etara (above), near Gabrovo, a 
town renowned as Bulgaria's “capital of 
humour”, is now a centre for traditional 
crafts where potters, leatherworkers and 
wheelwrights can be seen at work in 
carefully restored workshops.

### 44690: Bulgaria: a modern nation salutes its past

  
Bulgaria 
III. A TALE OF THREE CITIES 
towns have a special significance 
because of their national and cultural 
associations. They are those of the capitals 
which the Bulgarian princes established dur- 
ing the Middle Ages: first Pliska, metropolis 
of the first Bulgarian State from its founda- 
tion in 681, through the periods of its con- 
solidation, its conversion to Christianity and 
the introduction of the Cyrillic alphabet. 
Then comes Preslav which was the 
country’s capital during the “Golden Age” 
of Bulgarian culture when the arts and let- 
ters flourished at the court of king Simeon. 
Finally, Turnovo was the centre of Bulgarian 
civilization in the 13th and 14th centuries up 
to the time of the Ottoman invasion and 
conquest. ‘ 
Each city still seems imbued with the spirit 
of the age in which it flourished. Pliska, con- 
ceived like a huge fortified camp with the 
palace of the khan and the temple of his god 
in the centre, is massive, austere and ma- 
_—t han 
. ———— 
I the history of Bulgaria three names of 
    
jestic. The huge limestone blocks of its sur- 
rounding walls and palaces recall the power 
and might of its founding princes. Their 
determination to live and last is expressed in 
the remains of the fortress and the palace, 
and in the inscriptions engraved on columns 
by order of the khans. That memory must 
conquer death was the message left by khan 
Omurtag (814-831): “Man, even if he lives 
well, dies, and another sees the light. Let 
him who has been born later remember...” 
Very different is Preslav, built by young 
king Simeon (893-927) among the softly 
rounded hills bordering on the Ticha river. 
Preslav was also an imposing city, but here, 
instead of uncovering fortresses, ar- 
chaeologists are intent on bringing to light a 
town of builders, stone-carvers and 
sculptors, painters, potters, goldsmiths and 
writers, for discoveries have shown that 
these artists and craftsmen were extra- 
ordinarily creative and original. It has been 
established, for example, that a kind of

Above, ruins of the 9th-century palace of the khan 
at Pliska, the first capital of the Bulgarian State. 
Founded in 681 by khan Asparukh, Pliska remained 
the capital for a little over two centuries and 
towards the end of this period two major events 
occurred which were to have a profound influence 
on the country’s future—its conversion to 
Christianity and the introduction of the Cyrillic

faience used chiefly in mural decoration but 
also for making dishes was probably 
manufactured for the first time in Europe at 
Preslav in the 10th century. The painters 
even made ikons in ceramic, and faience 
served as a medium for writing. An earthen- 
ware spindle-whorl decorated with enamel 
has been discovered, on which the crafts- 
man or donor has inscribed the name of the 
young spinster for whom it was intended. 
“Lola's spindle-whorl”’ indicates the ex- 
tent to which literacy was then developed in 
Bulgaria. Preslav is famous in the history of 
Slav culture for its literary school, 
represented by a constellation of writers 
such as Chernorizetz Khrabar, John the Ex- 
arch, Constantine of Preslav and king Si- 
meon himself, who is said to have filled his 
palace with books. Most of the books com- 
piled or written in Preslav during this period 
were religious works, in particular sermons 
and commentaries on the Bible. But they 
also contain interesting discourses on lay 
subjects and sometimes inspired texts like 
Constantine's ‘‘alphabetic prayer” extolling 
the historical importance of the Bulgarians’ 
conversion to Christianity. 
During the 12th century, after several 
decades of Byzantine domination, Turnovo 
became the capital of the Second Bulgarian 
Kingdom, and so it remained until 1393, 
when the city was burnt to the ground after 
the Ottoman conquest. In a fantastic site of 
steep hills separated by the deep gorges of 
the Yantra river, a great city was built in a 
highly complex style which was hierarchical 
even in its architecture. 
Religious and political conflicts were fre- 
quent at that time. But enlightened rulers 
protected the arts and encouraged the 
development of literature. Among the rare 
manuscripts from Turnovo which have 
escaped destruction is the Chronicle of Con- 
stantine Manassés now in the Vatican, 
which contains 69 magnificent miniatures 
including 21 on Bulgarian subjects. Other 
masterpieces of illustrative painting are to be 
found in a few 14th-century manu- 
scripts—the famous Tetraevangelicum of 
king lvan-Alexander now in the British 
Museum, and the Moscow Psalter. 
But hardly any examples of monumental 
painting are still extant in Turnovo. For- 
tunately the frescoes of the little church of 
Boyana (1259), near Sofia, said to be works 
of the Turnovo school, are there to 
demonstrate the splendour and refinement 
of the art of the time. The unknown artist 
who painted portraits full of charm and 
dignity of the donors of Boyana, prince 
Kaloyan and his wife Dessislava, showed by 
the life he injected into the traditional im- 
ages of saints a dramatic sense and a 
humanism unsurpassed in 13th century 
Europe. B

A national festival of culture 
In the second half of the 9th century, Cyril and his brother Methodius 
created an alphabet for translating the liturgical texts into Slavonic, 
thus bringing learning "to all men through the medium of their native 
tongue”. For Bulgarians, this achievement by the “apostles of the 
Slavs’, as Cyril and Methodius are often called, became a symbol of 
their cultural identity which was preserved during five centuries of 
foreign oppression and domination. The two saints are com- 
memorated each year on 24 May, the day of Bulgaria's national 
festival of culture. This annual “festival of the alphabet and culture”

the presentation of literary and scientific prizes, and cultural events 
organized by students. Past and present also meet in the ornamental 
ceramic tiles which began to be manufactured in Bulgaria around the 
time when the Cyrillic alphabet was being adopted in the Slav coun- 
tries. These tiles, so lavishly covered with inscriptions as to be virtual 
books, were used to adorn the floors and walls of monasteries and 
palaces which were thus transformed into “public libraries” —the 
ancestors of the book centres and libraries of modern Bulgaria.

Bulgaria 
IV. FROM SAINT CYRIL 
TO THE NATIONAL REVIVAL 
as the nation itself. The first monastery 
was founded at Pliska by Boris | 
{852-889), who retired there at the end of his 
life. The disciples of Cyril and Methodius 
came to work in this monastery, teaching 
and spreading the Slav alphabet invented by 
their masters. 
Thus the monasteries early became 
cultural centres, a tradition which continued 
at Preslav and became widespread under Ot- 
toman domination when every monastery 
became a centre and refuge for the national 
spirit. On the feast days of the great 
monasteries pilgrims came from far and 
wide travelling across the country on foot or 
horseback or by cart. The inhabitants of 
towns and villages sent offerings of all kinds 
to contribute to the decoration of the 
building. 
This is still the case at Rila monastery 
where the monks celebrate divine service in 
the church and chapels maintaining the 
tradition of Bulgarian religious chant. This 
monastery built in the mountains to the 
south of Sofia is also a national museum 
with exhibition rooms devoted to a variety 
of subjects: history, economic activity, 
ethnography and ikon collections. 
Seen from the outside, the monastery is 
like a powerful fortress. Inside, the huge 
courtyard is bordered by facades rising up 
for several storeys and ringed with carved 
wooden balconies. In the centre stand a big 
church and a tower dating from the 14th 
century. On the floors above are small 
chapels, set between the visitors’ dor- 
mitories and the monks’ cells, where mass is 
celebrated on certain feast days. 
After Rila, the most important monastery 
is Bachkovo, which was founded in 1083 in 
a valley of the Rhodope mountains by a

high-ranking Georgian officer, Grigori 
Bakuriani, who was governor of the area 
during the period of Byzantine domination. 
The monastery at Bachkovo has had an 
eventful history. On several occasions it has 
been destroyed, rebuilt, restored and 
enlarged. 
During one of these alterations, in the 
17th century, an unusual masterpiece was 
added to Bachkovo. The mural paintings 
that decorate the walls and vault of the 
refectory form an overall composition in 
which Biblical scenes framed by garlands of 
foliage stand out against a starlit sky 
together with some of the great figures of 
Antiquity. Socrates, Plato and Aristotle, for 
example, are represented in medieval dress, 
which in no way detracts from the solemnity 
of their bearing and the nobility of their ex- 
pression. 
In the centre of this magnificent hall 
stands a long narrow marble table around 
which the monks used to gather. The ar- 
chitect’s remarkable use of space combines 
with the power of the painter's brush to 
achieve a remarkably persuasive effect: 
under a vault studded with golden stars, 
surrounded by the philosophers of antiqui- 
ty, the human spirit seems to soar above 
terrestrial life. 
Outside in the monastery courtyard one 
of the walls is decorated with a much more 
recent composition recalling the 
monastery’s main feast which is celebrated 
in August on the name-day of the Virgin 
Mary. It is a narrative scene that contains a 
wealth of information: the monastery is 
depicted surrounded by the foothills of the 
mountain. On the hilltops all around are little 
churches and chapels dedicated to various 
saints. A solemn procession is advancing 
through the main entrance headed by pro- 
minent citizens bearing the miraculous ikon 
of the Virgin. The procession goes round 
each church in turn. After the priests, led by 
the bishop of Plovdiv, come the monks and, 
finally, the laity, townsfolk and peasants. 
The artist has depicted the geographical 
details of the site with meticulous accuracy: 
the river, the bridges and the path on which 
laggards are still lingering. The ethno- 
graphical detail and social characteristics of 
the figures, many of which are undoubt- 
edly portraits of real people, are typical of 
the art of Zahari Zograph, self-taught author 
of this composition and one of the most 
gifted painters of the mid-19th century. 
Zahari Zograph also decorated the two 
monastery churches. All his compositions 
show a concern for social criticism. Thus, in 
the scene of the Last Judgement, he 
painted the portraits of Plovdiv 
moneylenders and their haughty wives 
bound for the ovens of hell. 
However, the art of the painters of this 
period is rarely limited to social themes, The 
artists delighted in covering the walls of 
monasteries and churches with roses and 
leafy branches. Their saints are clad in 
bright colours and their open faces are lit 
with a vitality and cheerful optimism 
characteristic of the period which has been 
called that of Bulgaria's National Revival. 
After the Ottoman invasion at the end of 
the 14th century the Bulgarians lost their in- 
dependence and, for more than five hun- 
dred years, experienced ordeals which few 
peoples have had to endure. But they 
preserved their national consciousness, 
traditions, faith and life-styles and were to 
show a fierce determination in the liberation 
struggle of the 19th century. 
But before the successful outcome of the 
Russo-Turkish war of 1877-1878 which 
brought about their liberation, the 
Bulgarians were to live through a very dif- 
ficult period, particularly after the April 1876 
uprising. The uprising failed despite the 
heroism of the freedom fighters and the 
revolt was crushed. The wave of indignation 
and sympathy which this cruel repression 
caused throughout Europe certainly hasten- 
ed the advent of freedom. But the founda- 
tions of Bulgaria’s liberation had been laid 
long before by the leaders of the Revival 
movement, and the country’s aspiration to 
freedom was foreshadowed by the architec- 
ture of the same period. 
For centuries the Bulgarians had only 
been allowed to build humble churches, as 
low and as dark as possible. But in the se- 
cond half of the 18th century, as the power 
of the Ottoman empire gradually weakened, 
spacious, well-lit churches began to be con- 
structed with beautiful decorated facades 
and magnificently carved iconostases inside. 
The figures of Adam and Eve are often 
represented on these big wooden screens 
surrounded by birds and acanthus leaves. 
Clad in Bulgarian peasant costume, Adam is 
tilling the land, while Eve is busy spinning. 
And naturally, among the images of the 
saints, Cyril and Methodius, inventors of the 
Slavonic alphabet, take pride of place. 
After the liberation of Bulgaria, for various 
social, economic and political reasons, the 
towns developed very slowly and without 
major upheavals. This stability has made it 
possible to preserve the architecture of the 
Revival period which, today, is the object of 
great attention. In Plovdiv, for example, one 
of the hills on which this picturesque city is 
built has kept whole districts of Revival 
period architecture. Corbelled houses with 
ingeniously articulated facades seem to vie 
in exhibiting their brilliant colours, but the 
general effect is one of harmony and propor- 
tion. The graceful lines, the many windows, 
the arches over the doorways, the skilful 
combination of wood and metal and the 
flowers decorating every window-sill—all 
express the spirit of hope characteristic of 
Bulgaria when they were built. 
These ancient streets and dwellings are as 
busy and as lively today as the new building 
sites, towns and villages in other parts of the 
country. The historic legacy is so full of 
vitality and enterprise that it can easily be in- 
corporated into the most modern aspects of 
the country’s culture. The youthful spirit of 
modern Bulgaria can draw upon knowledge 
and respect for the past.

From the earliest days of the 
Bulgarian State onwards, and 
especially during the period of 
Ottoman domination, the 
monasteries of Bulgaria have at 
times provided a refuge where 
the national spirit could survive 
by keeping its forms of cultural 
expression alive. The monks 
taught in the Bulgarian 
language, translated Greek and 
Oriental philosophers, and laid 
the foundations of a national 
literature. It was in the 
monasteries, too, that the 
heyday of Bulgarian 
monumental painting began in 
the 15th century. The frescoes 
on the walls and vaulting of the 
refectory in the monastery of 
Bachkovo are an outstanding 
example of this religious art. 
Their wide range of themes 
includes scenes from the Old 
and New Testaments, portraits 
of monotheist philosophers of 
Antiquity, and pictures showing 
councils of the church (a rare 
subject in Bulgarian religious 
painting). Left, parts of The Rod 
of Jesse, painted on the 
vaulting, and of The Last 
Judgement, on the east wall of 
the refectory at Bachkovo.

BUILDING THE FUTURE TODAY 
In the classrooms and lecture halls of univer- 
sities and technical institutes throughout 
Bulgaria today, young people, like these 
students at the Institute of Electro- 
Mechanics, Sofia (above), are preparing 
themselves to guide their country into the 
21st century. Transformed over the past 
three and a half decades into a modern 
industrial-agrarian nation, Bulgaria entered 
the space age on 10 April 1979 when 
cosmonaut Gueorgui Ivanov (below) step- 
ped aboard the spacecraft Soyuz 33 and, 
with his Soviet partner Nikolai 
Roukovischnikov flew off on a mission plan- 
  
ned within the framework of the Inter- 
cosmos Space Programme. With a territory 
of 110,911 square kilometres, Bulgaria ranks 
in size among the smaller European nations, 
yet its scientists and research workers have 
at their disposal the latest scientific equip- 
ment, including this experimental nuclear 
reactor (above right) at the Institute of 
Nuclear Research, Sofia. The late Bulgarian 
statesman George Dimitrov once said that 
in the field of culture there are neither small 
nor great nations, and the dynamism of 
—modern Bulgaria is firmly rooted in a cultural 
heritage spanning 13 centuries.

The banner of peace 
Just south of Sofia, Bulgaria's capital, rises 
an imposing concrete edifice hung with 
bells. Its name, the “Banner of Peace” 
monument, commemorates an international 
gathering with a difference— an assembly at 
which the youngsters of Bulgaria were hosts 
to 1,300 children from 76 countries. The aim 
of the meeting, one of the most memorable 
events marking International Year of the 
Child in 1979, was to bring together budding 
writers, musicians and painters from all over 
the world (below) under the flag of peace 
and friendship between peoples. Patrons of 
the Assembly, during which the youthful 
delegates drew up an appeal for world peace 
which was later presented to the Secretary- 
      
        
General of the United Nations, were the 
Chairman of the State Council of the 
People’s Republic of Bulgaria, Mr. Todor 
Zhivkov, and the Director-General of 
Unesco, Mr. Amadou-Mahtar M'Bow. One 
of the highlights of the assembly was the 
inauguration of the Banner of .Peace Monu- 
ment, which consists of a central tower sur- 
rounded by two semi-circular walls. At the 
top of the 37-metre-high tower hang seven 
bells representing the world continents 
(below right). Hanging from stanchions in 
the walls below are bells sent from many 
countries, each accompanied by an appeal 
for peace on earth. A symbolic “sun” bell 
dedicated to the children’s assembly is also

incorporated in the monument. The bells 
vary widely in shape and size (see photos); 
that of Bulgaria weighs 1,300 kilos, the num- 
ber of kilos corresponding to the age of the 
Bulgarian State. Bottom right, commemora-

gathering of children, “Sofia 81”, is schedu- 
led to take place this August, the second 
anniversary of the Banner of Peace 
Assembly. Its programme will be a prelude 
to the Second International Assembly of 
Children under the banner of peace, which 
will take place in Sofia in 1982.

### 44733: The Plight of Africa's five million refugees

The 
plight 
of 
Africa’s 
refugees in the world, the casualties 
of wars and various forms of oppres- 
sion and persecution. 
In the aftermath of the Second World 
War, it was Europe which faced a massive 
refugee problem, setting up transit camps to 
house the hundreds of thousands of 
uprooted and displaced persons who had 
survived the holocaust. There were still 
many European refugees in 1951, when the 
United Nations established the Office of the 
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), 
with headquarters in Geneva. This year, the 
thirtieth anniversary of UNHCR's creation 
provides an unwelcome reminder that its 
work is still as necessary as ever, for year in 
year out events continue to swell the ranks 
of the world’s refugee multitude.

### 44733: The Plight of Africa's five million refugees

> Today the problem has moved away from 
Europe and, as United Nations Secretary- 
General Kurt Waldheim has urged, world 
attention is being focussed on the plight of 
refugees in Africa. What is more, the num- 
ber of Africa's uprooted has soared alarm- 
ingly in the last few years: in 1975 there were 
a million; in 1977, 3,700,000. Last year the 
figure reached a staggering five million. 
In response to this crisis, the General 
Assembly of the United Nations last Novem- 
ber called for an international conference to 
be held in order to mobilize the community 
of nations and to appeal for aid, and on 9 
and 10 April, the “International Conference 
on Assistance to Refugees in Africa’, was 
held in Geneva. Invited to it were Member 
States of the Organization of African Unity 
(OAU) and of the United Nations, as well as 
national liberation movements recognized 
by the two organizations. The main objec- 
tive of the Conference was to obtain additio- 
nal resources for programmes to aid those in 
16 
the greatest need and, perhaps even more 
important, to provide assistance for the Afri- 
can host countries which would enable 
them to shoulder the heavy burden which 
the massive influx of refugees imposes on 
their personnel and their economies. 
International action in this field is not 
new. UNHCR has a long record of efforts to 
improve the conditions of African refugees, 
and their plight is clearly a matter of the 
highest priority for the Organization of Afri- 
can Unity. The Conference on the Legal, 
Economic and Social Aspects of African 
Refugee Problems, held at Addis Ababa in 
1967, was one milestone in the co-operation 
between the two institutions. This Confe- 
rence, the first occasion on which matters 
exclusively concerning refugees in Africa 
were considered in an international forum, 
adopted a series of recommendations aimed 
at alleviating the burden of asylum coun- 
tries. Another result of the Conference was 
the OAU’s creation of the Addis Ababa- 
based Bureau for the Placement and Educa- 
tion of African Refugees, and the adoption 
of the OAU Convention governing the Spe- 
cific Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa. 
The Convention incorporated the defini- 
tion of a refugee which has been adopted by 
most governments, in line with the formula 
established by the United Nations, as any 
person who, "owing to well-founded fear of 
being persecuted for reasons of race, reli- 
gion, nationality, membership of a particular 
social group or political opinion, is outside 
the country of his nationality...” But the 
Convention goes further than this, in stating 
that the word refugee also applies to “every 
person who, owing to external aggression, 
occupation, foreign domination or events 
seriously disturbing public order in either 
part or the whole of his country of origin or 
nationality, is compelled to leave his place of 
residence in order to seek refuge in another 
place outside his country of origin or natio- 
nality”. The African States, in line with

## [Page 17](074739engo.pdf#page=17) 0

### 44733: The Plight of Africa's five million refugees

be i 
  
these provisions, had also recognized that 
the granting of asylum to refugees is a 
peaceful and humanitarian act and not an 
unfriendly act committed by the country of 
asylum against the country of origin. 
Unfortunately, these texts, despite their 
generosity and the efforts they encouraged, 
proved inadequate to solve the refugee 
problem at a time when there was an inten- 
sification of liberation struggles, especially 
in southern Africa, internal conflicts, and 
inter-territorial disputes. A single figure 
highlights the dimensions of the problem: in 
the mid-1970s about 2,000 Africans became 
refugees or displaced persons each day. 
This was well over twice the world average 
of 800 new refugees per day. 
Consequently, another conference was 
held at Arusha (Tanzania) in 1979 in order to 
define a strategy for the repatriation of 
refugees to their countries of origin or for 
their integration into the economic struc- 
tures of the host countries. The Arusha con- 
This sea of improvised tents stretching far into the distance is an 
emergency refugee camp somewhere in Africa. Half the world's 
e refugees are today in Africa, and their total number exceeds the 
population of many African countries. The Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is collaborating with 
the Organization of African Unity and voluntary relief agencies 
on a massive effort to help some of the world’s poorest countries

ference, organized by the OAU, the United 
Nations Economic Commission for Africa 
and the UNHCR, also reaffirmed the prin- 
ciples of solidarity and “burden-sharing”, 
and outlined a list of existing and forseeable 
needs. These needs have been identified 
and costed for each country by UNHCR. 
African governments have shown extraor- 
dinary hospitality by accepting refugees by 
hundreds of thousands. They have set an 
example by scrupulously respecting the 
principles of the right of asylum and the 
non-refoulement of refugees. But it must 
not be forgotten that these countries— some 
of them among the world's poorest—are 
facing very serious economic difficulties. 
Not only are they hardest hit by international 
market forces and mounting energy costs, 
they are also a prey to natural catastrophes. 
Somalia, for instance, is a country virtually 
without resources, but in addition to its own 
population of 3,600,000 it now has over a 
million and a half refugees. 
provide food, shelter and medical aid for these millions of } 
refugees and displaced persons. Below, women and children wait 
for food to be distributed at a refugee camp. 
Ensuring the survival of the neediest 
refugees in the poorest countries is the 
prime target of the aid programmes for 
which UNHCR is responsible and which it is 
carrying out in co-operation with the World 
Food Programme, the World Health 
Organization, UNICEF, and other govern- 
mental and non-governmental voluntary 
agencies, whose work is absolutely in- 
dispensable. But existing resources are 
barely sufficient to prevent men, women 
and above all children from dying of hunger 
in their hundreds of thousands. 
Providing for the future needs and lives of 
the refugees, and bringing them into the 
African economy, are scarcely less urgent 
problems which may turn out to be more 
lasting and more costly, Whether they stay 
in asylum countries or whether after a few 
years they wish and are able to return to 
their own lands, displaced populations do 
not ask to be helped indefinitely. On the 
contrary, they want to work. But before

is beyond the capacities of the host coun-

that the United Nations’ appeal has been ad- 
dressed. UNHCR announced to the ninety- 
nine governments represented at the 
Geneva Conference, which was chaired by 
Mr. Waldheim, that the urgent measures 
which need to be taken in the next eighteen 
months will cost $450 million. In other cir- 
cumstances, such a figure might have 
alarmed donor countries who are often at 
the receiving end of requests for aid. On the 
second day of the Geneva conference, 
however, the participants pledged to pro- 
vide $560 million, perhaps more than had 
been hoped for. Then, on the evening of 
10 April, the Assistant Secretary-General of 
the Organization of African Unity announc- 
ed that other promises, which it had been 
impossible to make formally, had boosted 
the sum by at least $100 million.

Thus the appeal! has not fallen on deaf 
ears. It would be hard to find a better note 
on which to conclude than these words by 
Mr. Poul Hartling, United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees: “The suffering 
of the refugees has been understood; inter- 
national solidarity exists’.

Organized by Unesco at the invitation of the Foundation for 
Human Rights of Athens, a symposium devoted to a critical 
review of the pseudo-scientific theories invoked to justify 
racism and racial discrimination was held in the Greek 
capital from 30 March to 3 April 1981. 
Since those who attempt to impose the notion that some 
kind of “natural hierarchy” exists between different 
populations or between different individuals often invoke 
science in support of their theories, it was necessary for 
Unesco to clarify the situation by making the true stand- 
point of scientists widely known. Twenty-three 
distinguished personalities from eighteen countries, 
representing the various disciplines involved — geneticists, 
biologists, anthropologists, sociologists, psychologists, 
historians, etc.—spent a week analysing the most up-to- 
date findings of science and drawing from them the 
arguments with which to counter the affirmations of the 
neo-racists. 
The collective statement of their conclusions drawn up by 
the scientists gathered at Athens and addressed to all the 
peoples of the world is published on page 28 of this issue of 
the Unesco Courier. The article below, by French geneticist 
Albert Jacquard, rapporteur at the Athens symposium, 
highlights the main themes of the debate.

Science, 
| pseudo-science and racism 
AN’S spontaneous and apparently 
M natural reaction to a setback is to 
find the culprit, who necessarily 
has to be someone else, or “other” people. 
In a similar situation a group will react by at- 
tributing its misfortunes to some other 
group or, preferably, to a sub-group of its 
own kind." 
These instinctive, infantile, cowardly reac- 
tions bear no relation to a reasoned analysis 
of events in the real world and their causes, 
but they seem to be so widespread and so 
persistent that there are few grounds to 
hope that they can be made to disappear. If, 
in spite of everything, we must keep this 
hope alive, we can only to do so through 
science’, a somewhat solemn name for the 
by Albert Jacquard 
efforts of the human mind to understand the 
real world. 
Strangely, it is in the name of science that 
overtly racist attitudes are beginning to re- 
emerge in certain Western societies. People 
refer to "recent biological discoveries’ or to 
"the latest genetic research’ as justification 
for their attempts to classify men in certain 
categories or ‘“races’’, and above all to com- 
pare these races according to various criteria 
and to rank them in hierarchies. 
However, what scientists are actually say- 
ing, especially those working in genetics, 
the discipline most directly concerned, runs 
counter to any such claim. Any attempt to 
make biology serve as a basis for elitist 
theories is rooted in a fundamental 
misconception, whether the ““elite’’ consists 
of certain individuals within each group, or 
of certain groups in themselves. 
It is essential, therefore, that scientists 
should in the present circumstances speak 
out, for it is their duty to describe clearly and p

The Arabic word for dice, az-zahr, gave its name to a once-popular 
game called Hazard. As its name implies, Hazard is a game of 
chance, like all dice-games, since it is impossible to know exactly 
how the dice will fall. Or is it? If only we knew much more about the 
phenomena involved in throwing a dice then perhaps if would be 
possible to predict the result of each throw, thus removing the ele- 
ment of chance from the game. This may seem a far-fetched idea but 
it serves to highlight the infinitely more complex processes involved 
when we “dice with life”. According to Albert Jacquard the number 
of potential variations involved in the transmission of genes by 
parents to their children is so immense that we may never know 
enough to exclude the element of chance from our understanding of 
the process, and must predict its outcome on the basis of probability.

Pp publicize the discoveries made in their 
disciplines. Reasoned arguments, unswayed 
by sentiment, are needed to combat the dif- 
ferent forms of racism. For this, clarity is 
vitally important,. so we must carefully 
define the terms we use. 
To be "racist is to despise someone else 
simply because he belongs to a group. This 
group may be defined by many different 
criteria: colour of skin, language, religion, 
genetic inheritance or cultural heritage. And 
$0 it is more realistic to talk of racisms rather 
than racism. The first requisite of each form 
of racism is a definition, firstly of how to 
classify people into relatively homogeneous 
and distinct categories, and secondly, of 
how to establish a scale of values applicable 
24 
to these categories. In other words, the dif- 
ferent “races” must first be defined, and 
then ranked in a hierarchy. 
In the case of a species which has 
gradually become differentiated into 
definitively and strictly separate populations 
as a result of a series of separations, the gap 
between the genetic or cultural structures of 
two populations widens as they move fur- 
ther in time from the initial split. It is thus 
possible to attempt to reconstitute the 
genealogy of these successive separations, 
taking as a starting point the structures 
which can be observed today. 
Cn the other hand, when the history of a 
species does not take the form of a tree 
which has become progressively differen- 
tiated, resembling instead a network of 
amalgamations and exchanges between 
distinct populations (i.e. migrations), this at- 
tempted reconstitution is doomed to failure, 
save in exceptional cases. Our knowledge of 
the present state of the groups does not 
allow the steps which have led to this state 
to be retraced. In the case of the human 
species, which is remarkable for its 
nomadism, this difficulty is particularly 
great. 
To be sure, geographical distance has 
prevented exchanges between populations 
hving on opposite sides of the globe; migra- . 
tions have come up against sometimes in- 
superable natural obstacles; cultural dif-

ferences have raised barriers and isolated 
certain groups genetically. But the history of 
human populations is so intertwined that 
none can be described without reference to 
its exchanges with many others. Little by lit- 
tle, each has come to be related to the 
others. At the same time, natural processes 
{the foremost being that of sexual reproduc- 
tion) have given. rise to and sustained a 
remarkable degree of diversity within each 
population. 
Mankind is an aggregate of persons, 
families, ethnic groups, and nations, all of 
them different. But these differences can 
only be classified at the cost of an arbitrary 
impoverishment of our view of individuals 
and groups. The most rigorous form of 
classification concerns genetic inheritances: 
the degree of frequency with which various 
genes occur in each of two populations be- 
ing seen as a token of the degree of 
dissimilarity between these populations. 
If confined to a small number of genes, 
the attempt at classification will soon pro- 
duce results, but they will vary from one 
group of genes to another. If, for example, 
we take the genes responsible for the syn- 
thesis of melanin, a pigment which ac- 
cumulates in the skin and gives it a dark col- 
ouring, we find that, where these genes are 
concerned, blacks differ very greatly from 
yellow or white people. 
As for the genes responsible for the activi- 
ty of lactase, the enzyme which makes it 
possible to digest milk, they are very fre- 
quent among North European populations, 
slightly less so in the Mediterranean region, 
but very rare in Asia and Africa. The 
classification of people into two groups, 
based on the frequency of these genes, 
would set the Europeans apart from people 
from the other continents. 
In the case of two biological charac- 
teristics whose genetic mechanism is well 
known, the Rhesus blood system and the 
HL-A immunological system, both result in a 
classification of people into two groups, 
with Asiatics and Eskimos on one side, and 
indo-Europeans and Black Africans on the 
other. 
Depending upon the criteria selected — 
skin colour, persistence of lactase, or im- 
munological “systems” —our view of the 
relations between the three major human 
groups classically referred to alters com- 
pletely: it may arbitrarily be claimed that the 
populations of Europe resemble those of 
Africa more closely than those of Asia, or 
the reverse, 
This is because the history of humanity 
cannot be expressed in the form of a pro- 
gressively ramified tree. Instead, it consists 
in a network of exchanges, mergers and 
separations. It is therefore a mistake to try to 
devise a classification that can have no 
global validity. 
The impossibility of devising such a 
classification is confirmed by research which 
is not based on some arbitrarily selected 
characteristics, but on a synthesis of infor- 
mation concerning all the different 
characteristics studied. 
Where many sets of genes are involved, it 
is possible to express the various 
resemblances and differences between the 
genetic structures of two populations in 
terms of “distance”. The definition of race 
here means attributing populations with 
small distances between them to the same 
group, and populations separated by a large p

Biologists investigating the way in which characteristics are 
transmitted from parents to children make a fundamental distinction 
between what they call the genotype (the total of the genes that an 
individual inherits from its parents) and the phenotype (what an in- 
dividual is: its appearance, bodily structures, etc.) Whatever happens 
to an individual, its genotype does not change, whereas the 
phenotype is the outcome of interaction with the environment during 
the individual's growth and development. Drawing above is a 
schematic representation of this process. Circles in lower part of 
drawing (A) represent the genotypes of a father, mother and child. In 
middle layer (B) the three are shown by silhouettes depicting their 
“characters” (i.e., their phenotypes). Columns joining the circles to 
the silhouettes (C) illustrate the way in which the changing 
phenotype is “governed” by the unchanging genotype. Top layer (D) 
symbolizes all the physical, cultural and other influences to which 
the phenotype is subject from its external environment.

### 44767: Science, pseudo-science and racism

“The only value judgement 
with any scientific backing 
concerns the importance of 
differences for their own 
sake... The more different we 
are the more | give to my 
neighbour and the more | 
receive from him in return”. 
A Neolithic artist carved a 
human face in this sea-shell 
from Tongsamtong (Republic 
of Korea). 
p distance to two distinct groups. In the case 
of human populations, this method cannot 
be conclusive. 
Basing his research on the best-known 
blood systems, the Harvard geneticist R. 
Lewoutin has shown that the distance bet- 
ween two populations belonging to different 
“races’’ is, on average, not more than 7 or 8 
per cent higher than the distance between 
two populations of the same race. 
In other words, if belonging to a given 
race or a given nation is not without 
significance as regards genetic structure, its 
consequences are very limited; an Eskimo or 
an African could well be closer to me 
genetically than the policeman in my village. 
This is not to deny the differences between 
the various human groups. But the web of 
similarities and dissimilarities is so intricate 
that the picture becomes blurred as soon as 
an attempt is made to incorporate all the 
available data. ' 
— So the geneticist’'s answer, when asked 
about the meaning of the word ‘race’, is 
categorical; insofar as the human species is 
concerned, there can be no objective and 
stable definition of this concept. 
Experience shows that the classifica- 
tion of humanity into more or less distinct 
groups usually goes hand in hand with a 
value judgement distinguishing the ‘‘good" 
from the bad’. Thousands of ‘examples 
could be cited of writers who are convinced 
that they are not racists and yet take it for 
granted that their own group is the best. A 
book read by several generations of French 
children, Le Tour de la France par Deux En- 
fants, presents stereotyped portraits of 
Whites, Blacks, Yellow people and redskins, 
and affirms that “the white race is the most 
perfect.” 
Current attempts to establish a hierarchy 
of races seek to envelop themselves with an 
aura of scientific respectability by making 
reference to research in a variety of 
disciplines, notably those concerned with 
explaining the evolution of species and 
those that study the various manifestations 
of intellectual activity. 
For over a century, explanations of evolu- 
tion have been dominated by Darwinism. 
The key concept of this theory is that of the 
survival of the fittest; those individuals best

fitted for the “struggle for life’* have the best 
chances of surviving and transmitting their 
genetic inheritance to the next generation. 
According to this theory, the biological 
structure of the population undergoes 
transformation as a result of this inequality 
of individual capacities, desirable 
characteristics spread, and undesirable ones 
gradually die out. 
When, thanks to the Austrian botanist 
Gregor Mendel, it was understood that sex- 
ed beings transmit not their characteristics 
but the genes governing these charac- 
teristics, it became necessary to modify this 
theory and to attribute a “'selective value” 
not to the individuals or to their 
characteristics but to the genes they 
possess. Darwinism was supplanted by neo- 
Darwinism whose approach is basically the 
same. 
However, the attribution of a "value" to 
people or to genes can be highly misleading. 
By definition, this value corresponds ex- 
clusively to the gene's ability to transmit its 
biological inheritance, i.e. to procreate 
children. Individuals who die without off- 
spring are thus “of no selective value”. To 
classify them as “inferior beings” is to con- 
fuse their selective value and their value as 
human beings. 
This blunder has been made many times 
by those who have extrapolated a social 
Darwinism from the original biological Dar- 
winism, and have advocated a type of soci- 
ety in which the powerful must “'naturally” 
prevail over the weak. Contemporary 
Western thought has been deeply influenc- 
ed by this kind of reasoning, which many 
regard as dictated by “the laws of nature”. 
The fact is, however, that nature really 
teaches us the exact opposite of this hierar- 
chical vision. 
One of the consequences of natural selec- 
tion ought apparently to be the gradual stan- 
dardization of populations. Since the 
“good” drive out the “bad”, in due course 
only the best genes remain, and there is less 
diversity. Now, analysis of the genetic in- 
heritance of various species shows, on the 
the contrary, that this diversity is maintain- 
ed. One unexpected discovery made by 
biologists, which has gradually been con- 
firmed over the last ten or fifteen years, is 
the extent of “polymorphism”, the ex- 
istence of a wide field of variation within a 
given population. 
This discovery has led to a fundamental 
revision of neo-Darwinism. This revision has 
taken two directions: certain scientists are 
developing a ‘neutralist’” theory, from 
which the concept of selective value has 
been eliminated; others retain the concept 
but give it a much more complex definition, 
giving weight to the interaction of several 
genes on a single characteristic. In either 
case, this revision renders obsolete all 
reasoning based on the existence of a scale 
of values according to which individuals, 
characteristics or genes may be set in a 
hierarchy. 
The mechanisms at work in nature do not 
select the best and weed out the less good: 
they preserve the sustained coexistence of a 
wide variety of characteristics. If we are to 
learn from nature, then we ought to rank . 
groups not according to the quality of their 
characteristics, but according to the variety 
of these characteristics. The best’ group is 
the one that has managed to preserve the 
greatest diversity, whatever the content of 
this diversity. 
Our judgements on our fellow men often 
concern their psychological rather than their 
physical characteristics. It is the role of the 
psychologist to define with greater precision 
the various traits of the personality, and for 
nearly a century now, Western 
psychologists have sought to turn their 
discipline, with all its nuances and subtle 
distinctions, into a ‘scientific’ discipline. 
For this, they have introduced quan- 
titative criteria. In particular, they have 
popularized the intelligence quotient, or 1 Q, 
a parameter that supposedly measures the 
activity of our intelligence. Admittedly, 
psychologists themselves denounce the 
abuses that have arisen in connexion with 
the cult of | Q. Even so, this quotient figures 
prominently in many misconceived 
arguments; it serves to justify often harsh 
decisions concerning children’s school 
careers, and it has been the crux of the con- 
troversy provoked in the United States by 
the revival of a certain kind of racism. 
This is not to deny the usefulness of the 
concept of | Q. But it is necessary to define 
the limits of its significance: | Q indicates the 
position of an an individual on an arbitrarily 
defined scale of reference within a given 
population, at a specific moment in time. 
This indicator is extremely imprecise, and its 
stability is little-known and probably low. 
Despite these limitations, certain scien- 
tists have used | Q to compare human 
populations. The most famous study is the 
one conducted by the American 
psychologist Arthur Jensen, who in 1969 
compared Blacks and Whites in the United 
States and concluded that there was a 
15-point differential in favour of the latter. 
This conclusion depends upon the factors 
to which the observed difference is at- 
tributed. This involves a delicate genetic 
concept known as inheritability. Certain 
psychologists have totally misunderstood 
this concept: they have forgotten that the 
inheritability of 1 Q merely measures a 
resemblance and have used it to attribute 
| Q differentials between populations to 
genetic factors. 
This is not to deny the influence of 
genetic inheritance on a characteristic such 
as intellectual activity. Clearly, the medium 
for this activity, namely the central nervous

## [Page 27](074739engo.pdf#page=27) 0

system, is produced from the genetic in- 
heritance, but its ontogenesis also requires 
the intervention of the environment. The 
outcome will depend upon the way they in- 
teract. But to try to measure the relative in- 
fluence of each is meaningless. 
Thus it is impossible to base a classifica- 
tion of the “intellectual potential” of dif- 
. ferent human groups on observable intellec- 
tual performance, or even to ascribe observ- 
ed variations, as certain doctrinaire thinkers 
have tried to do, to genetic differences. 
The very concept of intellectual potential 
is indefinable. Attempts to establish a hierar- 
chy of races on the basis of this criterion are 
not just mistaken: they are absurd, Ex-- 
perience unfortunately shows that it is 
harder to combat an absurdity than to clear 
up a mistake. 
The chief lesson to be learned from 
genetics is that the groups to which we 
belong do indeed differ from each other, but 
that the individuals within each of these 
groups are even more different still. 
The only value judgement with any scien- 
tific backing concerns the importance of dif- 
ferences for their own sake, without at- 
taching a plus or a minus sign to these dif- 
ferences. | am neither superior nor inferior to 
anybody else; | am different from 
everybody; the more different we are, the 
more {| give to my neighbour and the more | 
receive from him in return. 
This is not an assertion dictated by a 
moral system; it is the central lesson of 
genetics. It is a serious matter that this 
lesson should have been distorted to justify 
racist doctrines. It would be easier to com- 
bat this kind of perversion of the truth if 
communication between scientists and 
public opinion were better organized. In this 
field, the activities of Unesco could prove 
decisive for the future of us all.

ing conclusions, which represent the present state of scientific 
knowledge on the racial question. 
. The latest anthropological discoveries 
confirm the unity of the human species. 
. The geographical dispersion of the 
human species has favoured its racial 
differentiation but has not affected its 
basic biological unity. 
. All attempts to classify the human

to the concept of race have been based 
on visible physical characteristics. In 
fact, the concept of race can only be 
based on transmissible characteristics, 
that is to say, not on visible physical 
features but on the genetic factors that 
govern them. 
. Modern biological techniques have 
made it possible to study these factors. 
They reveal a far greater genetic diversi- 
ty than had been imagined. 
. It has been found that the difference 
“between the genetic structures of two 
individuals belonging to the same 
population group can be far greater than 
the differences between the average 
genetic structures of two population 
groups. This finding makes it impossible 
to arrive at any objective and .stable 
definition of the different races and con- 
sequently deprives the word ‘race’ of 
much of its biological meaning. 
. Whatever the differences observed, 
biology can in no way serve as the basis 
for a hierarchy between individuals or 
population groups, since no human 
group possesses a consistent genetic in- 
heritance. In any event, one is never 
justified in proceeding from observation 
of a difference to the affirmation of a 
superiority-inferiority relationship. 
. In fact, each human being possesses a 
genetic combination that is unique 
among the countless possible combina- 
tions. 
. Man has developed culture, which has 
enabled the human race to adapt itself 
to different ecological environments and 
to transform them according to its 
needs.

The pre-eminence of culture makes the 
human species unique and invalidates 
any explanations of human behaviour 
based solely on the study of animal 
behaviour. There are no grounds for ex- 
plaining variations in group behaviour in 
terms of genetic differences. 
Intellectual activity constitutes one of 
the most striking characteristics of man. 
Certain disciplines have developed 
techniques for measuring this activity. 
These techniques are designed to com- 
pare individuals within a given popula- 
tion group and cannot, by definition, be 
used for the purpose of comparing dif- 
ferent population groups. 
it follows, a fortiori, that any value 
judgement on the intellectual capacities 
of a given group based on such 
measurements is completely without 
foundation. 
Indeed, the complexity of the inter- 
action between biological and cultural 
factors makes any attempts to establish 
the relative importance of innate and 
acquired characteristics completely 
meaningless. 
It is unacceptable and scientifically un- 
justifiable to use the results of 
psychological tests and the intelligence 
quotient in particular to promote social 
ostracism and racial discrimination. 
The social sciences provide no support 
for the view that racism is a collective 
form of behaviour that inevitably arises 
when certain kinds of social relationship 
predominate between different ethnic 
groups. On the other hand, the plurality 
and coexistence of cultures and races 
that characterize many societies con- 
stitute the most felicitous form of 
mutual enrichment between peoples. 
Racism, which takes a number of forms, 
is in reality a complex phenomenon in- 
volving a whole range of economic, 
political, historical, cultural, social and 
psychological factors. Effective action 
to combat racism must necessarily ad- 
dress itself to all these factors.

Racism is generally a tool used by cer- 
tain groups to reinforce their political 
and economic power, the most serious 
cases being those involving apartheid 
and genocide. 
Racism also takes the form of denying 
that certain peoples have a history and 
of underrating their contribution to the 
progress of mankind. 
While the quantitative analysis of social 
phenomena can help to elucidate 
sociological and economic issues, it can 
also be used to promote exclusion and 
segregation. The application of quotas, 
tolerance thresholds and numerical 
stipulations for educational purposes 
based on ethnic or racial criteria should 
be denounced when it violates the basic 
principles of human rights. However, 
legitimate measures can be taken to 
redress the wrongs inflicted on certain 
underprivileged groups. 
Those engaged in scientific activity bear 
a major responsibility for the social 
future of their contemporaries. Where 
racism is concerned, this responsibility 
involves political and ethical choices. 
Scientific research, particularly in the 
field of the human and social sciences, 
should always be based on respect for 
human dignity. 
Recognition of the risks to mankind im- 
plicit in certain applications of science 
should lead not to a rejection of science 
but rather to the fostering among the 
public at large of a genuinely scientific 
attitude, that is, an attitude based not 
“on an accumulation of certainties but on 
the cultivation of a critical spirit and the 
continual challenging of accepted 
views. The struggle against racism in all 
its forms calls for the extensive involve- 
ment of scientists in the fostering of 
these attitudes, making use in particular 
of education systems and the media. 
. There is a need therefore for scientists, 
whatever their differences or divergen- 
cies of viewpoint, to strive to maintain 
the objectivity that will ensure that their 
work and conclusions cannot be used as 
the basis for falsifications and inter- 
pretations detrimental to mankind.

### 44771: The Man who vanquished yellow fever

century ago relatively little was 
A known about the tropical diseases 
which brought suffering and death 
to the peoples living in the hottest regions of 
the globe. . 
Today, although not all tropical diseases 
have been eradicated, some of them are on 
the way to being completely wiped out, or 
else their incidence has dropped. 
Yellow fever was the first tropical disease 
to be eradicated from the regions where it 
was considered to be endemic. Coastal 
cities such as Havana, Veracruz, Rio de 
Janeiro and other ports of Central and 
South America were the front-line targets of 
yellow fever epidemics, as well as relatively 
large areas of West Africa. The disease 
sometimes affected regions with a more 
temperate climate such as the Mississippi 
valley, where it caused over 13,000 deaths in 
1878, and other parts of North America and 
even Europe. 
Two big questions emerged from analysis 
of the causes of yellow fever. One had to do 
with the nature of the pathogenic agent 
which caused the disease; the other with the 
specific way in which it was transmitted. It 
was known that it could be propagated over 
relatively large distances without there 
necessarily being a carrier in the vicinity of 
each new infected centre. 
The Cuban physician Carlos Finlay 
{1833-1915) knew that the pathogenic agent 
responsible for yellow fever could be “an 
amorphous virus’, an animal or plant germ 
or a bacteria, but he was more interested in 
discovering how the disease was pro- 
pagated than in isolating the micro- 
organism which caused it. Between 1879 
and 1880, Finlay concentrated all his efforts 
on discovering in which organs of the 
human body the first symptoms of the 
disease appeared. His studies convinced him 
that the germ which caused the disease was 
by Pedro M. Pruna 
  
and Rafael O. Pedraza

first of all lodged in the walls of the blood 
vessels. It could thus be supposed that it 
was introduced into the blood by a medium 
of transmission which was still unknown. 
In the history of science it sometimes hap- 
pens that a fact which apparently has little 
connexion with the matter being investi- 
gated provides the inspiration for a scientific 
discovery. Finlay's discovery was one of 
these occasions. The inspiration came from 
an article describing wheat-rust, a disease 
caused by a fungus part of whose life-cycle 
is spent as a parasite on an intermediary 
plant. Finlay immediately realized that the 
epidemiological characteristics of yellow 
fever could be explained by. the existence of 
an active intermediary agent capable of in- 
oculating healthy persons with diseased 
bicod and thus with the germ causing the 
disease. 
In February 1881 Finlay expounded the 
hypothesis of the existence of a transmitting 
agent in an address to the International 
Sanitary Conference at Washington, D.C. 
By August of the same year he had made so 
much progress that, in a lecture to the 
Havana Academy of Medical, Physical and 
Natural Sciences, he was able to describe 
this agent with amazing precision. The vec- 
tor of yellow fever, Finlay declared, was a 
mosquito whose description corresponded 
to the species which is today known as 
Aedes aegypti. For the first time it was 
claimed that a pathogenic micro-organism 
was transmitted from one person to another 
by a biological vector. 
Before Finlay’'s discovery, the theories put 
forward to explain the transmission of 
yellow fever from an infected to a healthy 
subject had given rise to a confused debate 
which brought into confrontation two main 
schools: the contagionists, who claimed 
that the disease was transmitted through 
secretions, through clothing and direct con- >

against yellow fever

A century ago, when Carlos Finlay discovered that it was transmitted by a mosquito, 
yellow fever was an endemic disease in much of tropical America and Africa. Today its 
ravages have been greatly reduced. Shaded areas on maps (top) show the incidence of 
jungle yellow fever in South America between 1965 and 1979. The four maps showing part 
of Africa also illustrate the evolution of yellow fever during the same period. Localized out 
breaks in three countries spread rapidly before becoming concentrated in two countries by 
1979. Generalized vaccination is the main weapon used by national health authorities 
  
  
Pp tact, and the miasmatics, who maintained 
that foul-smelling marsh gas was the culprit. 
Seen from a historical perspective, the 
major contribution of Finlay’s work was not 
only the identification of the transmitting 
agent of yellow fever, but his realization that 
certain diseases were transmitted not so 
much through person-to-person contagion 
as through a biological vector. 
It is today widely recognized that the 
theory of biological vectors has a double 
paternity, since it was set forth and demons- 
trated almost simultaneously by Carlos J. 
Finlay for yellow fever, and Patrick Manson 
for filariasis. However, Finlay was the first to 
put forward the theory in the case of a 
micro-organism. 
Finlay also distinguished himself by 
explaining why the indigenous population of 
Cuba suffered less from yellow fever than 
foreigners who had recently arrived in the 
country. He supposed, correctly, that the 
Cubans had developed a certain immunity to 
the disease, and that for them the mosquito 
acted as a kind of vaccine. This was an 
explanation ahead of its time. 
In 1898, Finlay put forward the method of 
combatting yellow fever which four years 
later would be applied to eradicate the 
disease from Cuba. This was the destruction 
of the larva of the mosquito in the water 
where it lived, using chemicals. 
Before the year 1900, Finlay carried out 
over a hundred inoculations using the mos- 
quito as a vector, and although most of the 
results obtained corroborated his theory, the 
| latter had been confirmed by no other scien- 
tist. An opportunity to carry out an impartial 
test arose in 1900 when a commission of 
physicians from the United States, led by 
Walter Reed, arrived in Cuba. Their aim was 
to investigate the causes of yellow fever, but 
they were more interested in isolating the 
pathogenic micro-organism which caused 
the disease (through a process of elimina- 
tion they reached the conclusion that it was 
a "filtrable virus’) than in studying how the 
disease was propagated. 
It was only when Finlay took up the mat- 
ter strongly with the supervisory authorities 
of the United States in Cuba that the Com- 
R

mission agreed, with considerable scepti- 
cism, to examine the theses he put forward 
and to repeat, in controlled conditions, the 
experiments he had performed. In so doing 
they confirmed the fundamental results he 
had obtained. It should be added that the 
only member of the Commission who be- 
lieved in Finlay’s theory, the young doctor 
Jesse Lazear, died in the course of an expe- 
riment designed to test it and carried out on 
his own initiative. 
Years later, William Gorgas, who headed 
the campaign to wipe out yellow fever in 
Cuba and Panama, wrote to Finlay: 
“If we had followed your advice during 
our stay in Cuba, we should have obtained 
in 1899 the results we obtained later, in 
1901. For myself, | would even go so far as 
to assert that it is thanks to your work and to 
the way in which you defended your mos- 
quito theory that the American Commission 
of which Reed was president was induced to 
investigate the theory. Were it not for the 
work you had already carried out in 1900, 
the American Commission would never have 
embarked on research into the mosquito 
theory.” 
The first scientist of international reputa- 
tion to recognize the outstanding merits of 
Finlay's work was the British bacteriologist 
Sir Ronald Ross, who was noted for his 
investigations of malaria and was awarded 
the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1902. Two 
years later he proposed Finlay for the same 
award, But although Finlay never received 
this prize which he so richly deserved, he 
was privileged to receive in person many 
tokens of universal gratitude for his work. 
He won the Breant Prize of the French Aca- 
demy of Medicine, of which he became a 
member, and the Mary Kingsley Medal be- 
stowed on him by the University of Liver-. 
pool. He was also awarded the French 
Legion of Honour. 
At the Panamerican Medical Congress of 
1933 it was decided that Finlay’s birthday, 3 
December, should be celebrated each year 
as American Medicine Day. Several interna- 
tional congresses on the history of medicine 
have underlined the importance of Finlay's 
discovery, and some years ago Unesco 
created a prize bearing his name. But 
perhaps the finest tribute that could be paid 
to Finlay’s work and to Finlay himself would 
be for its significance never to be forgotten. 
In Cuba there has not heen a single case 
of yellow fever since the first decade of this 
century, and the disease has been wiped out 
in many other Latin American countries, in 
the United States, and wherever the princi- 
ples established by Finlay have been applied.

The only authority for the facts of St. Benedict's life is book 2 of the 
Dialogues of Pope Gregory the Great, which was written around 593-594, 
almost fifty years after the saint's death. This medieval miniature from the 
Miracles of St. Benedict by St. Gregory, Adrevaldus and Aimoin (1437) 
shows Gregory listening to testimony about the life of St. Benedict.

the Master and lend him thine 
heart's ear. Receive with 
gladness the teaching of a good father, that 
in its practice and in the exercise of obe- 
dience, thou shalt return again to him from 
whom base contumacy hath led thee 
away"’. 
Thus begins the ‘Rule of Saint 
Benedict’, a document written some 1500 
years ago that was to become one of the 
yy | H EAR, my son, the precepts of 
‘foundation stones of monasticism in 
western Christendom. 
All that we know about the life of Saint 
Benedict, the author of this document, is 
contained in Book Il of the Dialogues of 
Saint Gregory the Great (Pope Gregory 1). 
Benedict was born in the year 480, of good 
family, at Nursia, Umbria, Italy. After a brief 
period of schooling in Rome, impelled by a 
desire for a closer union with God and by a 
strong sense of vocation, he withdrew to 
the solitude of a cave near Subiaco, while 
still a young man, where he devoted his life 
to prayer and penitence. 
There he lived for three years, attracting 
by his devoutness so many disciples that he 
was obliged to found thirteen communities 
in the region. Later, he left the area, moving 
south to found the famous monastery (in its 
chequered history it has been destroyed and 
rebuilt four times) at Monte Cassino where, 
in 547, he was to die. 
GREGORIO PENCO, of /taly, is a Benedictine 
monk at the monastery of Agrano, near Novara, 
italy. A noted theologian, he is a specialist in 
monastic history. .

Works of art inspired by St. Benedict, many of them painted by great masters, would 
have a prominent place in any portrait gallery of Christian saints. In the 15th-century 
fresco, above, left, by the Italian painter Mariano di Matteo da Roma, St. Benedict is 
shown deep in meditation. Fingers to his lips, he enjoins his monks to silence. Quite 
different in spirit is the drawing of the “patriarch of Western monks" by the great 
Flemish painter Peter Paul Rubens, above right. It was executed around 1605 after an 
earlier portrait by Giovanni Bellini. St. Benedict, shown holding a crook in one hand 
and an open Bible in the other, is accompanied by St. Mark. The authority of his gaze 
and bearing reflects the decisive role played by St. Benedict in European history.

### 44778: Saint Benedict of Nursia: a voice across the centuries

This miniature from the Miracles of St. Benedict by the medieval Flemish chronicler 
Jean de Stavelot shows a famous episode in the life of St. Benedict as recorded by 
Gregory the Great. St. Benedict is admonishing the Gothic king Totila, who then 
dominated much of Italy, with the words: “You commit acts of great evil, you have 
done many wrongs. Put an end to your cruelty!” This appeal for peace and justice, 
courageously addressed by the sequestered monk to one of the mighty figures of his 
age, here appears as a symbol of the superiority of the word over the sword.

p> Saint Benedict was, above all, an ascetic, 
a contemplative, a ‘man of God” as his 
biographer called him. Yet he was also a 
legislator who expressed and codified his ex- 
perience of monastic life in his famous Rule 
which was destined primarily for application 
in the monastery at Monte Cassino, but also 
in other monasteries that little by little came 
to adopt it. 
The monastic movement had, indeed, 
been in existence in the West for some two 
centuries before Saint Benedict's time and 
had already produced a number of notable 
figures, such as Saint Martin of Tours, as 
well as various monastic rules. What it lack- 
ed, however, was a balanced, reasonable, 
harmonious code which would make the 
monastic life accessible to people not en- 
dowed with exceptional physical and 
spiritual qualities and which, above all, 
would provide monastic communities with a 
solid, wisely-conceived organizational 
framework capable of withstanding the 
vicissitudes of time.

Saint Benedict was inspired by a pro- 
found faith, and it was upon this faith that 
he based his entire spiritual edifice. In this 
respect, the Benedictine Rule has been 
described as being ““Christ-centred’’, since, 
to the eye of the faithful, the presence of 
Christ can be discerned in everyone, 
whether abbot or monk, sick person or pass- 
ing guest, 
Since the community for which it was 
drawn up was formed and exists above all 
for religious purposes {seeking after God), 
the Rule gives pride of place to prayer, 
which Saint Benedict called Opus Dei, the 
supreme work of God. Periods of prayer are 
allowed for at fixed times of the day, con- 
sisting of readings of psalms and lessons. 
The Bible, accompanied by the commen- 
taries of the Church Fathers, is thus the 
basic text of prayer. By means of prayer the 
monk can express the renewed gift of 
fellowship with God both in personal collo- 
quy and in a collective act of praise in which 
all creation is united in celebration of the

greatness of God in the world and 
throughout time. Linked in this manner to 
the Bible and the liturgy, monastic prayer 
has an essentially objective character quite 
distinct from that of other spiritual schools 
which tend rather towards the introspective, 
contemplative approach. 
Work is another fundamental component 
of the Rule. Indeed, so essential was it con- 
sidered to be that later tradition coupled it 
with prayer in the formula Ora et Labora 
{pray and work), although these words do 
not actually appear in the text of the Rule. 
Previously left almost entirely to slaves, 
work not only offered an escape from 
idleness, so harmful to the spirit, it also pro- 
vided a means of subsistence and of helping 
pilgrims and succouring the poor. The Rule 
speaks explicitly of Arti, thats to say, of the 
activities undertaken by the monks within 
the monastery. Work in the fields was left to 
the peasants, although the Rule provides for 
the monks to take part in this work when 
necessary. It also gives instructions on what p»

“Slave or free man, we are all one in Christ, and we are militant under 
one Lord, bearing an equal yoke of servitude’, wrote St. Benedict in his 
Rule. The abbot, leader and father of the monks, takes no important 
decision withour consulting the community or the council of seniors, 
and some writers who have described the organization of the 
Benedictine life have even spoken of “monastic democracy”. This detail 
from a fresco in the Benedictine monastery of Monte Oliveto Maggiore 
near Siena in Italy shows the Benedictine community eating in silence 
which is broken only by the monk reading aloud. It forms part of a 
series of scenes from the life of St. Benedict painted by the Italian artist 
Sodoma between 1505 and 1508. 
Pp constitutes a suitable ration of food and the 
time to be allotted to sleep and rest, the 
Abbot being allowed a wide margin of dis- 
cretion in these matters. 
These apparently simple regulations, des- 
tined for the closed world of the monastery, 
cut off from society, were to prove extre- 
mely fruitful during the succeeding centu- 
ries. Born just after the fall of the Western 
Roman Empire, in 476, Saint Benedict lived 
in a period of profound change, of crises 
and upheavals whose effects were felt as 
much by ecclesiastical as by other institu- 
tions. 
It was a period marked by intensified 
transmigrations of peoples which were to 
give birth to the Europe of the Middle Ages. 
And, although there are no grounds for sup- 
posing either that the Popes gave any expli- 
cit instructions concerning the formulation 
of the Benedictine Rule, with a view to the 
conversion of these people to Christianity, 
or that this was in the mind of the Saint 
himself— he had no wish to deviate from his 
ideal of solitude and detachment from the 
world —the regulations he had drawn up 
were to be decisive for the future. 
With the foundation of the Holy Roman 
Empire under Charlemagne, in the 9th cen- 
tury, and under his successors, the Benedic- 
tine Rule was more and more widely adop- 
ted until it became virtually the sole body of 
monastic regulations of the period. This 
meant that innumerable monasteries had the 
good fortune to find themselves governed 
on the basis of a wise and compassionate 
Rule, while at the same time retaining vir- 
tually complete autonomy. 
At the end of the 6th century, Pope Gre- 
gory the Great had sent some forty monks 
under Saint Augustine to convert England 
to Christianity. Later, from the 8th to the 9th 
century, Anglo-Saxon monks, under the 
leadership of Saint Boniface, were in their 
turn to land on the continent, penetrating 
into the heart of Europe to regions un- 
touched by Roman civilization, to convert 
the Germanic peoples to Christianity. They 
then took their message to the Scandina- 
vians and the Slavs, and in this way, over 
the centuries, the spread of Christianity and 
the expansion of monasticism went hand in 
hand. 
The time came, however, when the 
monasteries felt the need to emerge from 
their isolation and to band together into lar- 
ger associations to defend themselves from 
external threats. The first of these associa- 
tions, the precursors of the great religious 
orders, was centred on the famous monas- 
tery founded at Cluny, in Burgundy, France, 
in 910. Many others followed suit, notable 
among them being Citeaux, the monastery 
which Saint Bernard and some thirty of his 
relatives and friends were to enter two cen- 
turies later. 
As it expanded, Benedictine monasticism 
followed fairly closely the evolution of both 
Church and society, associating itself with 
the Church in the task of spiritual reform to 
counter interference from the outside world, 
but acting in concert with society in the 
introduction of new craft techniques and in 
the development of agricultural production 
and trade. ) 
Situated, in many cases, beside the main 
communication routes, whose upkeep they

By the end of the 12th century there were over 100,000 Benedictine 
monasteries in Europe. Their impact on European culture and civilization 
was far-reaching: their scribes and copyists helped to transmit the literature 
, and learning of Antiquity to the modern world, and their schools were the 
leading educational institutions. Above, 15th-century miniature showing 
Constant the African, an 11th-century monk in the great Benedictine 
monastery of Monte Cassino in Italy, diagnosing an illness through 
uroscopy. Constant was instrumental in transmitting elements of the Arab 
pharmacopeia to Europe. Below, the scriptorium, or scribes’ copying-room,

“Pray and work" 
An original feature of St. Benedict's Rule is 
the stress it lays on the importance of 
manual work in the spiritual life, the 
monk's day being divided between prayer 
and work, and governed by a strict 
timetable. Bells were rung when it was 
time to pass from one activity to another. 
Top. the ringing of bells is depicted in the 
initial “E” in an illuminated Bible (c. 1250) 
from the abbey of Saint-Eloi in northern 
France. Above, preaching monk carved on 
a stall from the abbey of Saint-Lucien, 
Beauvais (France). Carving on another stall 
from the same abbey (below) shows a 
monk working a butter churn. As a result 
of their “work ethic” the Benedictines 
made a decisive contribution to the 
economic and social life of medieval 
Europe. Manual work is still coupled with 
prayer in the daily activities of the monk,

### 44778: Saint Benedict of Nursia: a voice across the centuries

  
  
  
While St. Benedict was living as a hermit, the fame of his sanctity 
spread and disciples flocked to hear him preach. Tiny painting 
{above} in the margin of a mid-15th-century breviary from the abbey 
of Grammont (France), shows the monks of Vicovaro beseeching 
him to become their abbot. Later his followers would preach the 
length and breadth of Europe. In 529 Benedict founded the 
monastery of Monte Cassino on the site of an ancient temple to 
Apollo halfway between Rome and Naples. The monastery (below) 
was an important cultural centre in the Middle Ages when its monks 
produced outstanding manuscripts and paintings. It has been 
destroyed and rebuilt several times, most recently after the Second 
World War.

to the life of the mind at a time when there 
existed very few other institutions in a posi- 
tion to do so, 
Each monastery had a library and a writ- 
ting room for the transcription of manu- 
scripts required both for the religious offices 
and for the cultural education of the monks. 
At a time when the outside world was ex- 
periencing a disturbing cultural decline, the 
monastic libraries represented virtually the 
sole repositories of knowledge. In tran- 
scribing and preserving not only sacred 
Christian texts but also classical Greek and 
Latin literature, the Benedictine copyists 
rendered an invaluable service to civilization, 
maintaining its continuity in face of the 
threat of irreparable rupture. 
Nevertheless, Saint Benedict and his suc- 
cessors will be remembered primarily for the 
spiritual values which they kept alive and . 
spread throughout Western Europe up to 
the start of the modern era. Then the chang- 
ing conditions of the times made necessary 
the development of new religious orders 
with more clearly defined aims and that were 
better prepared for the apostolic mission. In 
the organization of work, in the sense of 
prayer and in the collective life of the 
monastery were to be found the specific ac- 
tivities and conditions of life that together 
constituted the values that Benedictine 
monasticism sustained and propagated in 
medieval society. The very soul of Europe 
was moulded by Saint Benedict and his suc- 
cessors who created a culture which, 
despite the diversity of its national and local 
forms, was profoundly unitary because it 
drew inspiration from a single source, hav- 
ing a single faith based on the Bible and the 
tradition of the Church. 
For centuries, the ideal of saintliness re- 
mained that formed by the monastic life, 
and Benedictine saints, whether canonized 
or not, can be counted in their thousands, 
among whom were spiritual leaders, ad- 
visers to popes and emperors, founders of 
monasteries and of cities, and evangelists 
who carried the word to the people. They in- 
cluded many great thinkers, Doctors of the 
Church such as the Venerable Bede, Saint 
Damien, Saint Anselm and Saint Bernard, 
who contributed to the emergence of a par- 
ticular kind of theology known as ‘'monastic 
theology” because it was appropriate to a 
life of prayer and the quest for union with 
God. Their writings, highly esteemed by the 
student of today, are of lasting value 
because they stress the unity of prayer and 
life, of faith and charity, of religion and 
culture. Thus the influence of Saint 
Benedict's spiritual legacy still makes itself 
felt across the centuries, and from the past 
his voice still brings enlightenment to 
modern man.

niversary of the foundation of the Food and 
Agriculture Organization of the United Na-

event. World Food Day will be an opportuni- 
ty to do something about world hunger 
through renewed commitment and 
resources for food and development pro- 
grammes, internationally co-ordinated ac- 
tion to tackle food problems, sponsorship of 
activities such as seminars, debates, essay 
competitions for schoolchildren, etc. Most 
governments and many non-governmental 
organizations are planning World Food Day 
events, For further information write to: the

International effort 
to save the panda 
The World Wildlife Fund has lauched a ma- 
jor international fund-raising campaign on 
5 continents in support of efforts by the 
People’s Republic of China to save one of 
the world's best-loved animals, the giant 
panda. This is the first joint conservation 
project between the Chinese Government 
and a non-governmental conservation 
organization. Field work is already underway 
on the save-the-panda operation, which was 
inaugurated last year in Wolong Natural 
Reserve, Sichuan Province. The initial 
agreement which the World Wildlife Fund 
and China signed in preparation for their 
scientific collaboration acknowledged the 
panda as ‘‘not only the precious property of 
the Chinese people but also a precious 
natural heritage of concern to people all over 
the world.” 
The threat of military research 
and development 
Some 400,000 highly qualified scientists and 
engineers around the world are engaged in 
military research and development (R&D). 
Their activities, which account for about 
40% af all R&D, constitute the major ele- 
ment fuelling the arms race and thus 
threaten the future existence of humanity. 
These are two of the grim conclusions 
reached by contributors to the latest issue of 
Unesco’s quarterly /mpact of Science on 
Society (vol. 31, No. 1, Jan.-March 1981). 
Articles in the issue, which is entitled 
“Weapons from science: civilization's 
pitfall”, include: “Arms control, disarma- 
ment and small nations”, “What the arms 
race means”, and “The influence of arms 
development on new research”,

Satellite send-off 
for Bulgarian anniversary 
Two “Intercosmos Bulgaria-1300"" space 
satellites equipped with Bulgarian equip- 
ment will be launched from USSR territory 
to commemorate the 1300th anniversary of 
the foundation of the Bulgarian State. Their 
mission will be to study the interaction of 
the ionosphere and the magnetosphere. 
Since the first Bulgarian satellite went into | 
1972, Bulgaria has : orbit in December 
become a veteran of space exploration. 
New creatures.found 
in Pacific geysers 
A research ship off South America has 
reported discovering sea creatures which 
may never have been seen before, living at 
the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. The sea 
floor was known only as a pitch black ter- 
rain, nearly barren of life, until 1977 when 
hot water geysers gushing up through small 
smokestacks’ were discovered off the 
Galapagos Islands and were found to sus- 
tain communities of species, genuses and 
families unlike any evolved elsewhere on 
earth. The latest discovery, by the U.S. 
vessel Melvifle, may be the largest of these 
“ocean vent communities’. The vent sites 
are on the crest of an underwater mountain 
range called the East Pacific Ridge, where 
two great plates of the Earth's crust are 
slowly pulling apart. ' 
Unesco group votes 
to launch sports week 
A Unesco-sponsored intergovernmental 
committee has unanimously recommended 
that all Member States support the 
organization of a World Physical Education 
and Sports Week. The 30-member Inter- 
governmental Committee for Physical 
Education and Sport also appealed for in- 
creased contributions to the international 
fund for the development of these activities, 
stressed the need to democratize sport, and 
called for large scale programmes to provide 
sports opportunities for everyone.
