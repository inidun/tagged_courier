Smiles of satisfaction light up the faces of these Egyptian village women 
as they complete the time-honoured ritual of baking bread. In many parts 
of the world bread has been a staple of human diet for some twelve 
thousand years. The first bread, made in Neolithic times, probably 
consisted of crushed grain, moistened with water and baked by being laid 
on heated stones and covered with hot ashes. It is to the ancient Egyp- 
tians that we owe the invention of the bread oven and the discovery of the 
fermentation process in wheat dough that makes possible the baking of 
light aerated bread.

Editorial Im 
One of the highlights of 1987 has been the publication of Our Common 
Future, the report of the independent World Commission on Environment and 
Development, commissioned by the United Nations. “The environment,” says 
the report, “is where we all live; and development is what we all do in 
attempting to improve our lot within that abode. The two are inseparable.” 
The report goes on to say that “the changes in human attitudes that we 
call for depend on a vast campaign of education, debate and public 
participation. This campaign must start now if sustainable human progress is 
to be achieved.” 
In this issue of the Unesco Courier we hope to further that campaign by 
publishing extracts from a forthcoming report on Unesco’s Man and the 
Biosphere (MAB) Programme, entitled Man Belongs to the Earth, in which a 
serious attempt has been made to marry strict scientific accuracy with a style 
accessible to the general reader. 
The extracts published here do not by any means cover the entire range of 
MAB activities. In particular, forests are deliberately not mentioned since we 
shall be devoting a future issue of the Unesco Courier to this subject. 
The extracts do, however, underline the message of the World 
Commission on Environment and Development that development and 
conservation of the environment, far from being incompatible, are inextricably 
linked. 
The year 1987 also marks the 150th anniversary of the birth of the 
Georgian writer and poet llya Chavchavadze and the 100th anniversary of 
the birth of Les Kurbas, founder of Soviet Ukrainian theatre. To conclude this 
issue, we publish articles on the life and work of these two men, each of 
whom played their part in the enrichment of world culture.

sustainable development are symbolized by this view of farmland near Ruijin, in the grain- 
rich province of Kiangsi, in the middle Yangtze region of China.

### 76518: Sustainable development; conservation and development are two sides of the same coin

ustainable development 
by Bernd von Droste 
Conservation and development are 
two sides of the same coin 
quarter of a century has passed 
A since American biologist Rachel 
Carson sat down to write The Silent 
Spring, a book which was to become a 
watershed in the brief history of ecology. 
The graphic picture she drew of aworld in 
which, as a result of the indiscriminate use 
of pesticides, the song of birds at spring- 
time would be lost for ever, captured the 
‘imagination of the public. Suddenly there 
was a new awareness of the intricate rela- 
tionships that link living organisms and their 
environment, of man’s oneness with nature 
and the extent of his influence over it. 
More importantly, perhaps, The Silent 
Spring drew attention to the fact that there 
were limits to the absorptive and regenera- 
tive powers of nature; whilst man had 
always manipulated his environment, he 
could no longer use it as an unfailing, 
bottomless sink for pollutants and man- 
generated wastes. 
It is difficult today to believe that we 
should still have needed to be reminded of 
these seemingly self-evident facts. After all, 
as far back as Aristotle's day, Theo- 
phrastus, his disciple and successor as 
head of the Lyceum in Athens, had written 
at length about the inter-relationships 
between organisms and their non-living 
environment, and the idea of the unity of 
organisms and environment has long been 
a part of many religions. 
For centuries, however, botanists and 
biologists, geologists and demographers, 
went their separate ways, and it was not 
until the latter part of the nineteenth century 
that the German zoologist Ernst Haeckel,

### 76518: Sustainable development; conservation and development are two sides of the same coin

The Simen National Park and World Heritage 
site, Ethiopia 
the man who coined the term oekologie, 
once again stressed the importance of “the 
relation of the animal both to its organic as 
well-as to its inorganic environment”. 
Strangely enough, Haeckelian oekologie 
was overshadowed rather than enhanced 
by the Darwinian revolution and, 
throughout the early part of this century, 
ecological research was based on the 
scantiest of theoretical foundations. It was 
not until 1942, when R.L. Lindeman 
developed his theory of the hierarchical 
trophic (food chain) structure of eco- 
systems, which laid emphasis on the flow of 
energy through ecosystems, that ecology 
started to become an organized modern 
science. 
The subsequent development of compu- 
ters and of new techniques, such as label- 
ling with radio-isotopes, stimulated studies 
of both energy and nutrient cycling through 
ecosystems, and, as a result, the eco- 
system, as a functional unit made up of 
interacting biotic (living) and abiotic (non- 
living) components through which energy 
flows, became one of the unifying concepts 
of ecology and the focus of much ecological 
research. 
This was a great step forward, but it was 
not enough. The multidisciplinary approach 
to research came up against serious diffi- 
culties. The research time span for a bota- 
nist studying crop succession, for example, 
could be a matter of months, whereas that 
required for, say, a forester, or a biologist 
concerned with population dynamics, could 
run into decades. Similar problems arose 
over the size of the ecosystem under study. 
Furthermore, despite Rachel Carson's 
warning, there remained a tendency to look 
at ecosystems from the “outside” and thus 
to overlook the vital feature of man’s impact 
on ecosystems. 
Two events were to help change all this: 
the launching, in 1971, of Unesco’s Man 
and the Biosphere (MAB) Programme, and 
the United Nations Conference on the 
Human Environment, held in Stockholm in 
1972, both of which stressed the role of 
man as a major environmental force. 
The MAB Programme went further; it 
stressed the need for an integrated, inter- 
disciplinary rather than muiti-disciplinary 
approach and brought the social sciences 
into ecological research as an equal part- 
“ner with the natural sciences. As a result, 
the past fifteen years have seen the imple-

mentation of a wide range of pilot projects 
throughout the world, the building up of 
research facilities in the developing world, 
the accumulation of an impressive quantity 
of environmental data and the forging of an 
exciting new research tool—an interna- 
tional network of biosphere reserves. 
Underlying all this work was a new con- 
cept of fundamental importance—the con- 
cept of “conservation for sustainable 
development”. In other words, ecologists in 
MAB were no longer saying “Stop doing 
~ that or you will destroy the environment”.

Rather they were saying “Try doing this and 
you can enjoy the benefits of development 
and conserve the environment”. 
Nevertheless, as a Scientific Advisory 
Panel pointed out to the International 
Co-ordinating Council of MAB at its ninth 
session held in Paris in October 1986, a 
number of theoretical and practical prob- 
lems remain. 
One major problem has been the tend- 
ency to disregard the evolving nature of 
ecosystems. We have tended to look at 
ecosystems as the outcome of evolution 
rather than as being constantly subject to 
evolutionary processes. Disturbance in an 
ecosystem may well be a moulding, driving 
force in an evolutionary sense ratherthan a 
destructive force. 
In turn this attitude tends to colour our 
approach to environmental “conservation” 
or “restoration”, words which seem to imply 
a return to a pre-existing state, when we 
should perhaps be thinking in terms of 
achieving a new equilibrium equally if not 
more beneficial to man. 
On the more practical side, the Panel 
proposed to build on past achievements in 
a number of ways. It suggested that: 
e fuller use should be made of data from 
the biosphere reserve network in the 
development of comparative studies of 
ecosystem functioning, such as the com- 
parative study now being undertaken on 
the improvement of tropical soil fertility 
through biological processes.

® increased emphasis should be given to 
approaches for handling the management 
and re-development of ecological 
resources degraded by man. 
® research on the changing relationships 
between economic driving forces and ecol- 
ogical systems should be intensified. 
e greater use should be made of sophisti- 
cated modern risk assessment methods to 
provide guidance for policy-makers con- 
cerning investment and resource use. 
® expert systems should be established 
which could offer decision-makers rapid, 
easy access to relevant information from 
the vast wealth of ecological research data 
already accumulated. 
Finally, the Panel emphasized the com- 
plexity and increasingly global extent of 
man’s impact on the environment, in par- 
ticular where environmental disturbance is 
concerned. What once were local incidents 
of pollution confined to one watershed or air 
basin now tend to involve many nations, as 
witness the Chernobyl incident and the 
growing problem of acid rain. 
All this underlines the fact that the MAB 
Programme itself is an evolving system, 
and this implies not simply change, but also 
the selection of successful trends and the 
elimination of undesirable or ineffective 
components. 
The opening chapter of Our Common 
Future, the recently published report of the 
World Commission on Environment and 
Development (often referred to as The 
Brundtland Report, after its Chairman, Gro 
Harlem Brundtland, Prime Minister of Nor- 
way) contains these words: 
“Humanity has the ability to make 
development sustainable—to ensure that it 
meets the needs of the present without 
compromising the ability of future genera- 
tions to meet their own needs. ... Technol- 
ogy and social organization can both be 
managed and improved to make way for a 
new era of economic growth. The Commis- 
sion believes that widespread poverty is no 
longer inevitable. Poverty is not only an evil

in itself, but sustainable development 
requires meeting the basic needs of all and 
extending to all the opportunity to fulfil their 
aspirations for a better life. A world in which 
poverty is endemic will always be prone to 
ecological and other catastrophes.” 
It is the proud aim of Unesco’s Man and 
the Biosphere (MAB) Programme to do all 
in its power to ensure that such catastro- 
phes do not occur. u

can guide us through the tortuous labyrinth of the city 
rapher James Boswell, that peerless 
eighteenth-century man of letters Sam- 
uel Johnson once declared that “when a 
man is tired of London, he is tired of life, for 
there is in London all that life can afford”. 
This was less a panegyric of London per 
se than an affirmation of the fact that cities 
are the melting-pot of ideas and invention, 
market-places for the exchange of informa- 
tion and centres of learning, the fount of 
human culture and creativity—in short, that 
cities are the sine qua non of civilization. 
For the medieval peasant, city life held an 
additional attraction—residence in a city for 
a year and a day brought emancipation 
from serfdom. “Stadtiuft macht frei” (City 
air brings freedom), declared Emperor 
Henry the Fifth in drawing up the charters of 
the cities of Speyer and Worms. And even 
today, this same desire to escape the pov- 
erty and servitudes of rural life remains the 
major driving force behind the explosive 
expansion of many cities in the developing 
world.

To the ecologist, however, a city may 
appear to be a very artificial system. It is 
true that the sites of man’s earliest fixed 
settlements, such as the rich valleys of the 
Fertile Crescent, were chosen for their 
favourable environmental conditions, but 
with each new technological advance the 
city-dweller became increasingly divorced 
from his “natural” environment until, today, 
man is able to use almost any environment 
for town living. Indeed, as Soviet space 
experiments have shown, man can now live 
for months on end in a totally artificial, 
wholly man-made environment. 
What is a city? 
Inthese circumstances, the question arises 
as to whether the ecological approach is 
applicable to urban systems. What, indeed, 
is a city? Is it an organism, and, if so, isit a 
“parasite” with the natural environment as 
its host? Is a city an organism within an 
environment, or itself an entire ecosystem? 
Urban ecologists are thus still seeking to

swamped with demands for advice from 
politicians and city bosses on how to handle 
the horrific problems resulting from the 
urban explosion. 
The threat of massive failure of cities, 
through resource depletion, disease and 
famine, which has always existed, seems 
more menacing than ever. In the general 
confusion about the nature of the urban 
phenomenon, ecologists have perforce 
adopted an ad hoc approach. 
As a result, urban ecology has come to 
include a heterogeneous ragbag of study 
topics. These range from studies of energy 
and materials flows and the use of ecologi- 
cal indicators to measure urban environ- 
mental quality, to traditional and experi- 
mental building forms and the carrying 
capacity of urban systems and ecological 
support systems. 
In practice, most urban studies under- 
taken within the MAB framework have 
focused on one aspect only, such as the

distribution of flora and fauna within urban 
areas, or the human ecology of children in 
the city. 
One study, which explicitly aimed to inte- 
grate city-wide studies of energy, food and 
water flows with a bio-social survey of indi- 
vidual quality of life and human adaptation 
(Hong Kong), was unable to demonstrate 
how a change in one level affected the 
other, eventhough it seemed reasonable to 
suppose they must be interlinked. 
Although many of these case studies 
have succeeded in providing a valuable 
scientific basis for handling urban planning 
problems specific to particular cities, the 
original objective, of setting up an interna- 
tionally agreed comparative data set for 
urban systems so that case studies could 
be contrasted and compared so as to 
provide answers to common, process- 
oriented questions, has been virtually 
abandoned. 
This is because, owing to the sheer 
speed and magnitude of the urban explo- 
sion, the problems themselves are chang- 
ing, both in scale and in nature, almost as 
fast as the necessary data can be collected 
and collated. 
Under these circumstances it has been 
well-nigh impossible to establish agreed 
data collection standards, and without stan- 
dardized units of measure and similar 
descriptive parameters the jndividual stud- 
ies are doomed to remain no more than 
isolated case studies. 
The way ahead 
Today, a critical point has been reached in 
we 
the development of ecological approaches 
to urban systems. No single thread has yet 
been found that can guide us through the 
tortuous labyrinth of the city. 
The auguries, however, are good. In the 
fifteen or so years since MAB was launched 
a wealth of experience has been gained 
and an impressive store of research data 
acquired. The advent of the new generation 
of micro-computers means that it is now 
possible to make speedy and effective use 
of these data to make comparative analysis 
a reality and to realize the full potential of 
systems analysis. Furthermore, introduc- 
tion of the technique of risk assessment 
offers new horizons for urban ecology. 
Comparative analysis 
The option here is, in part, to go back to 
basics and take up the work begun a 
decade ago in setting up a comparative 
data set for urban systems, The time is now 
ripe to develop and agree a detailed, inter- 
national framework for data collection 
which will include: (a) common parameters 
for describing urban systems, and (b) the 
variables required for specifying key sys- 
tem relationships. This is a prerequisite for 
development of valid comparative analysis 
of urban systems. 
There remain considerable difficulties. It 
may not be easy to formulate common 
parameters that will encompass the older 
cities with their history of slow, organic 
growth and many modern cities which are 
rapid, ad hoc, one might almost be tempted 
to say “artificial” creations.

### 76529: The Urban maze

Systems analysis 
With the arrival of the latest generation of 
micro-computers, the full potential of sys- 
tems analysis as applied to urban systems 
can now be realized. The work done in con- 
structing input-output matrices and plotting 
metabolic city flows can now be incorpo- 
rated into policy-oriented decision models. 
These models will allow policy-makers to 
assess the consequences for an eco- 
system of proposed actions, whether the 
specific proposals be about green spaces, 
housing or transport. 
In this connection, a state-of-knowledge 
report is at present being prepared by a 
joint working group* to assess the status 
and potential of integrated economic ecolo- 
gical models for understanding urban sys- 
tems. These models provide rapid, graphic 
feedback and are one important way of put- 
ting existing results into the policy arena.

chemical risks, such as nuclear power and 
heavy metals, risk assessment is essen- 
tially an application of the ecosystem 
approach. It translates information about 
ecosystem relationships into probability 
statements about likely harm and inte- 
grates these with social value judgments 
about the acceptability of risk to provide a 
basis for policy-making. 
Risk assessment, then, whilst not a pan- 
acea, provides a general paradigm for look- 
ing at urban vulnerability and resilience 
from the perspective of decision-making 
under conditions of uncertainty. It is eco- 
system thinking within a management 
framework. 
The balance sheet 
The biennium 1985-1986 saw a re-exam- 
ination of basic principles and a subtle 
re-shaping of the practical approach to 
problems of urban ecology along the lines 
suggested above. These trends are 
reflected in the practical achievements of 
the period. 
The next milestone in the evolution of an 
integrated ecological approach to cities 
may well be the development and use of 
“expert systems” and inclusion of the 
decision-making process as part of the 
ecological system to be studied. [|

The role of MAB 
in urban systems 
research 
¢ Concern about urban development centres 
on the sustainability of urban systems, both as 
suitable habitats for mankind and in terms of 
their ecological and support systems. 
¢ With its worldwide research network, MAB 
is uniquely well placed to carry out compara- 
tive studies of the environmental and social 
effects of rapid urban expansion. The data 
already acquired from case studies of such 
widely differing cities as Kuala Lumpur, 
Rome, Barcelona, Sao Paulo, Mexico City, 
Beijing, Frankfurt-am-Main, Dakar, Khar- 
tou and Lae (Papua-New Guinea) provide a 
firm scientific basis for the development of 
guidelines for planners and decision-makers 
faced with problems of rapid urban growth in 
other parts of the world, 
® The change from a mainly rural to a pre- 
dominantly urban habitat for the majority of 
the world population demands major 
psychological and physiological adjustments 
at both the individual and the community 
levels. 
© Many MAB projects contain a strong social 
science input to ensure that the vital social, 
psychological and physiological aspects of 
“total environment” are not overlooked. 
® Involvement of all sections of local popula- 
tions—local personalities, women’s and youth 
groups, decision-makers, etc.—as well as 
on-the-spot training of local technicians, is also 
an integral part of most MAB projects. 
¢ (ities are in many ways dangerous and 
“unnatural” biological habitats for mankind, 
yet they are the “natural” homes of human 
culture and creativity. } 
® Conservation in itself is not enough; it must 
also contribute to the development and the 
improvement of man’s relationship with his 
environment. In seeking to ensure a viable 
future for cities as the major human habitat, 
MAB is fulfilling one of its most fundamental 
objectives. [| 


### 76531: Food for thought

Food for thought 
Is one answer to hunger, under-employment 
and poor quality of life among the urban poor 
to be found in our own backyards? 
Candide, the French philosopher and 
writer Voltaire declared “If faut cultiver 
notre jardin” (We must cultivate our 
garden), a phrase that might well have 
been adopted as the motto of a remarkable 
research project undertaken by the Centro 
de Estudios Urbanos y Regionales 
(CEUR), Argentina, and backed by the 
United Nations University and Unesco/ 
MAB. 
Voltaire, of course, was referring to the 
individual, spiritual garden which each of us 
must cultivate if we are to become selt- 
reliant and realize our full potential. A report 
on the first stage of the project, published in 
1986 under the title Agricultura Urbana y 
Periurbana en el Gran Buenos Aires 
(Urban and Peri-urban Agriculture in 
Greater Buenos Aires), goes a step further 
than Voltaire. After detailing the results of a 
thorough evaluation of the economic, social 
and environmental consequences of urban 
and peri-urban agriculture for self-con- 
sumption in the Greater Buenos Aires 
region, it comes to the conclusion that the 
| N a notable passage in his satirical work 
literal cultivation of back gardens, unused 
building lots and green spaces on the out- 
skirts of our great cities might offer some of 
the urban poor a way of escape from the 
trap of hunger, under-employment and 
wretched living conditions. 
The report points out that, at com- 
paratively low cost, urban gardening for 
self-consumption could have the following 
desirable effects: 
e Make quickly available to the section of 
the population in greatest need a supply of 
highly nutritive food which the normal work- 
ings of the food market denies them. 
A cultivated backyard plot in a workers’ barrio in Greater Buenos Aires 
 
® Increase the real incomes of poor urban 
families. 
® Make use of urban resources now lying 
idle (vacant land, some household wastes, 
the unused working capacity of the under- 
employed). 
® Provide opportunities for re-cycling 
urban wastes in soil reclamation projects 
for the provision of new gardens. 
e Improve the quality’ of life in the most 
deprived urban areas. 
e [nculcate a sense of pride, self-reliance, 
community spirit and liberty by offering the 
urban poor an opportunity to act positively 
on their own behalf. 
® For local authorities faced with the huge 
expenditures - required by traditional 
improvement schemes, the urban garden 
proposal offers an effective, low-cost 
opportunity to improve rapidly the lot of the 
urban poor for whom they are responsible. 
It has been estimated that, on average, a 
plot of land of 40 or 50 square metres would 
be sufficient to provide a family of, say, two 
adults and four children with all their needs 
in fresh vegetables and other green 
foodstuffs. The labour input needed to 
achieve this would amount to the equiv- 
alent of one and a half days work a week 
which could be shared by all the members 
of the family. 
It might be objected that, as has some- 
times been the case with imports of food tor 
famine relief in Africa, the introduction of 
new sources of food supply would distort 
food markets to the detriment of rural 
farmers. 
This objection melts away under closer 
scrutiny. Standard methods of stimulating 
food production rarely benefit the hard core 
urban poor, who remain outside the normal 
food market chain because they simply 
have not the resources to enter the market 
as buyers. 
Brazil, for example, has become the 
world’s third largest exporter of meat, after 
the United States of America and the Euro- 
pean Community, yet 25 per cent of its pop- 
ulation still lives at the poverty line and does 
not benefit from the country’s increased 
meat production. India and China have 
recently become net exporters of cereals, 
yet it is far from being the case that every- 
one living in those countries is adequately 
nourished. 
Clearly, urban gardening for self-con- 
sumption is not a panacea for all the ills of 
modern urban life. However, if combined 
with other initiatives being studied within 
the larger framework of the CEUR project 
on Alternative Strategies for Improving 
Food and Energy Availability in Cities, it 
offers more than a glimmer of hope for the 
millions of urban poor now held in the icy 
grip of poverty. []

### 76533: Return of the griffon

The griffon vulture is one of several species 
being re-introduced into the Cévennes Biosphere Reserve 
in southern France 
quarters of the Cévennes Biosphere 
Reserve, winds into the southern 
highlands of the French central mountains. 
Skirting terraced hillsides and deep 
ravines, with jagged mountains looming 
above, it seems to be leading the visitor 
back into another age, when life was harsh 
yet man was still in close communion with 
nature. 
Geologically and ecologically diverse, 
the Cévennes region is an ideal site for a 
biosphere reserve. Spread over some 
300,000 hectares, it includes a granitic 
massif to the north, a schist zone in the 
centre, a schist and granite mountain to the 
south and a limestone plateau to the 
west. 
Mont Lozére, the northern granitic mas- 
sif, is 40 kilometres long and 15 kilometres 
wide, reaching 1,700 metres at its highest 
point. The central schist valley is slashed by 
valleys opening towards the Mediterranean 
T: road from Nimes to Florac, head- basin. Aigoual, the composite mountain to 
the south, is a high zone cut by an important 
hydrographic network. The sedimentary 
plateaux of Causse de Sauveterre, Causse 
Mejean and Causse Noir, to the west, are 
rolling regions bounded by deep canyons. 
The geology, geographic location and 
great range of elevations mean that many 
kinds of vegetation are present, including 
sub-Mediterranean and Mediterranean for- 
est, Atlantic forest, middle European moun- 
tain forest, shrub and grass moors and rock 
vegetation. In general, the flora is sub- 
Mediterranean. 
The Cévennes contains 50 species of 
mammals, 150 species of birds, 30 species 
of reptiles and amphibians and 20 species 
of fish. Rare or threatened species include 
the golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), the 
peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), and 
the eagle owl (Bubo bubo). Attempts are 
being made to re-introduce some species, 
including griffon, beaver and capercaillie. 
Already a dozen or more great griffon vul- 
tures can, from time to time, be seen in 
majestic flight against the dramatic back- 
drop of the mountain slopes. 
The interest of the Cévennes as a bio- 
sphere reserve lies not only in its rich flora 
and fauna but also in the character of its 
diverse landscapes, where the natural and 
the cultural heritages are intricately mixed. 
The region shows many signs of human 
occupation dating back centuries. The orig- 
inal forest was destroyed in Roman timesto 
provide firewood for the great pottery kilns 
of Banassac and La Graufesenque. This 
deforestation led to the development of an 
architecture of superimposed vaulting 
capable of supporting heavy roofs of lime- 
stone tiles. 
Traditional rural architecture, dating back 
to the seventeenth century, is based mainly 
on local geological materials (schist, gra- 
nite, limestone) which are still the basis of 
today’s buildings, such as the clédes, used

biosphere reserve functions 
including such activities 
as experimental research, 
traditional use, and re- 
habilitation.

where silkworms were once raised. 
The schistose area of the Cévennes is a 
difficult area for human settlement because 
of its steep slopes. For centuries people 
have climbed these slopes carrying the soil 
that each Mediterranean storm washed 
/ GAY down into the valleys. Patiently and with 
—— Be J diy great effort they built terracing and hamlets 
al / | A on the mountain sides. 
This long and extraordinary interplay 
between man and nature was recognized 
by the French authorities and led, in 1970, 
to the creation of the Cévennes National 
Park. Like other French National Parks, the 
Cévennes Park has a central zone, in which 
some 600 people live, where Park officials 
have extensive statutory powers (supervi- 
sion of hunting, building licences, traffic, 
— etc.), and a peripheral zone in which they 
Comte rt me he Tn. can advise and attempt to influence the 
 
rag ——— communities within the zone to conserve 
Diagrams source: M. Balisse, 1986 natural features. 
In the field of architecture, for example, 
the park administration asks farmers to 
respect traditional building methods and 
pays the difference between the cost of a 
contemporary construction and a tradi- 
tional one. 
As far as agriculture is concerned, 
environmental planning helps farmers to 
improve their profits without damaging the 
environment. Farmers also sometimes 
work directly forthe Park under special con- 
tract, at times when they are not too busy 
in their own fields, on such projects as 
clearing undergrowth to prevent forest 
fires and restoring communal buildings in 
the villages. 
The similarities between the objectives of 
the Cévennes National Park and those of 
the MAB international biosphere reserve 
network are evident, and in 1984 the Park 
was designated a biosphere reserve.

### 76533: Return of the griffon

  
A rocky landscape typical of parts of the 
Cévennes 
This has enabled it to deal more effec- 
tively with a number of ecological problems. 
For example, the boundaries of the Park 
had been established on the basis of 
administrative and political demarcations, 
which rarely coincide with ecological limits. 
As a biosphere reserve, its new boundaries 
have been drawn up according to such cri- 
teria as geological patterns and vegetation 
distribution. 
Furthermore, scientific objectives are 
often better defined in a biosphere reserve 
and are related directly to human uses. In 
addition, the Park now has access to the 
vast MAB data base compiled from 
research undertaken in biosphere reserves 
all over the world. 
Within the framework of the MAB interna- 
tional network of biosphere reserves, a suit- 
able policy is being developed for the 
environment outside the central zone of the 
National Park. 
The objectives of the Action Plan for Bio- 
sphere Reserves have been enthusi- 
astically adopted and this was reflected in a 
workshop on the Implementation of the 
Action Plan for Biosphere Reserves in the 
Mediterranean Region, organized by the 
French MAB Committee and held at Florac 
in September 1986. Some fifty specialists 
from eight countries (Algeria, Egypt, 
France, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Turkey and 
Tunisia) attended, including representa- 
tives from two other French biosphere 
reserves: Fango, in Corsica, and the 
Camargue. 
A recurrent theme of the Florac work- 
shop was that consideration of the human 
element was vital to the understanding and 
better conservation of Mediterranean land- 
scapes. Biosphere reserves like the 
Cévennes can give a lead in testing ways of 
conserving landscapes that have long been 
shaped by the hand of man. [] 
Arid and semi-arid zones 
® Arid and semi-arid zones, lands of highly 
variable and sparse rainfall, cover one-third of 
the surface of the globe. 
® The boundary between “arid” and “semi- 
arid” may—at the risk of over-simplifica- 
tion—Dbe taken as the division between places 
where rainfall farming is possible, even though 
with great variance from year to year, and 
those where it is impossible to be certain of a 
crop in most years. 
® The transition from extremely arid to sub- 
humid regions is gradual and, except where it 
coincides with a distinctive feature such as a 
mountain range, is best delimited by a band of 
varying width. Within this variable band the 
rainfall is highly irregular, falls in contrasting 
dry and humid periods, and on average is less 
than 600 mm in summer or less than 400 mm in 
winter humid periods. 
® Climatic conditions give rise to very dif- 
ferent situations. It is possible to distinguish 
between arid and semi-arid regions on the basis 
of rainfall, but it is also very important to con- 
sider the duration of the rainfall and the dura- 
tion and timing of the dry season. It is evident, 
for example, that the problems of irrigation, of 
dry farming and of the movement of livestock 
differ greatly as between the northern fringes 
of the Sahara (where the rain falls in winter and 
is connected with the fronts and depressions of 
the temperate zone) and the southern fringes 
(where the rain falls in summer and is linked to 
the shifting of the inter-tropical convergence 
zone). 
® Not only precipitation registered by rain- 
gauges has to be taken into consideration. 
There are many coastal arid and semi-arid 
regions (in Chile, Mauritania, Morocco, etc.) 
which benefit from the condensation of dew 
(attributable to greater humidity of the air in 
these parts). And while evaporation is always 
difficult to measure and calculate, it is evident 
that thermic conditions vary widely from one 
arid region to another (with all the resulting 
repercussions on the life of human populations 
and on vegetation). 
® The presence of allogenic rivers (rising in 
non-arid regions) may radically modify the 
hydrological conditions which largely deter- 
mine the development of a region. They have 
often made it possible to extend irrigated areas 
considerably. 
® The nature of the flow of these rivers (degree 
of irregularity, high-water period, etc.) exer- 
cises a considerable effect. The flow of the Nile, 
for example, which is governed mainly by trop- 
ical precipitation, is very different from that of 
mountain rivers of higher latitudes, which are 
affected by the phenomena of snow retention 
combined, sometimes, with karst retention. 
Furthermore, conditions for the use of surface 
and underground water resources differ as 
a function of topography and of geological 
features. i 
® Soil conditions are very variable, depending 
upon the distribution of the parent rocks. Silty 
soils are more propitious in certain respects 
than sandy soils, yet like sandy soils they are 
vulnerable to erosion, hence the importance of 
soil fixation, conservation and restoration. 
® The position occupied by the arid and semi- 
arid regions in the countries concerned 
(whether they form a marginal, an important 
or an essential element in the national econ- 
omy) obviously affects the attention govern- 
ments pay to them and the investment, private 
or public, that is available for their develop- 
ment. 
® The approach to development problems will 
differ greatly according to whether or not tra- 
ditional populations and civilizations exist, and 
also to what part nomads, semi-nomads and 
sedentary peoples play in a country. The avail- 
ability of mineral or power resources is another 
decisive factor. 
® Thus the great variety of natural parameters 
and the diversity of socio-cultural and histor- 
ical backgrounds makes it extremely difficult 
to elaborate general models for development.

Nature and culture 
the World's Natural and Cultural 
Heritage, more commonly known as 
The World Heritage Convention, was 
adopted by Unesco’s General Conference 
in November 1972 and came into force in 
December 1975 after ratification by twenty 
nations. As of mid-1987 there are 247 
natural and cultural sites on the World 
Heritage List and the Convention has been 
ratified or accepted by 95 States. 
The Convention marks a new departure 
in international co-operation, setting up a 
system whereby the international com- 
munity can participate actively in protecting 
those parts of the natural and cultural 
heritage that are agreed to be of great uni- 
versal value. 
Traditionally, the preservation of cultural 
heritage and the conservation of nature 
have been regarded as two quite different 
problems, with responsibility for the protec- 
tion of important cultural or natural sites 
being considered as lying exclusively with 
the country in which they are located. 
The Convention breaks new ground by 
linking together the protection of the 
T: Convention for the Protection of cultural heritage and the natural heritage 
and in providing a permanent legal, finan- 
cial and administrative framework for inter- 
national co-operation in ensuring this pro- 
tection. It also introduces the new concept 
of a “World Heritage” of natural and 
cultural properties of universal value which 
transcends all political or geographical 
boundaries. 
The underlying philosophy which 
brought the Convention into being is that 
there are some parts of the world’s natural 
and cultural heritage that are so excep- 
tional and of such scientific importance to 
the world that their conservation and pro- 
tection for present and future generations is 
a matter of concern not only to individual 
nations but to the international community 
as a whole. 
Countries that are most richly endowed 
with artistic, archaeological, palaeontologi- 
cal, biological or ecological “treasures” are 
not, however, always the most prosperous 
and may have difficulty in providing ade- 
quate protection to this endowment.

lished under the Convention, any nation,

### 76536: Nature and culture: a priceless heritage of universal value

Inclusion of natural properties of 
universal value on the World Heritage List 
Under the World Heritage Convention, the 
natural heritage is defined as: 
® Natural features consisting of physical and 
biological formations or groups of such forma- 
tions which are of outstanding universal value 
from the aesthetic or scientific point of view; 
® Geological and physiological formations and 
precisely delineated areas which constitute the 
habitat of threatened species of animals and 
plants of outstanding universal value from the 
point of view of science or conservation; 
® Natural sites or precisely delineated natural 
areas of outstanding universal value from the 
point of view of science, conservation or natural 
beauty. 
Criteria 
A natural heritage site, following the definition 
above, which is submitted for inclusion in the 
World Heritage List, will be considered to be of 
outstanding universal value for the purposes of 
the Convention when the Committee finds that 
it meets one or more of the following criteria 
and fulfils the conditions of integrity set out 
below. Sites nominated should therefore: 
1. be outstanding examples representing the 
major stages of the Earth’s evolutionary 
history; 
2. be outstanding examples representing sig- 
nificant on-going geological processes, biolog- 
ical evolution and man’s interaction with his 
natural environment; as distinct from the 
periods of the Earth’s development, this 
institution or individual can contribute to the 
protection of the heritage in countries 
where national resources are insufficient. 
Signatories to the Convention undertake 
to help in the identification, protection, con- 
servation and preservation of world 
heritage properties. They recognize that 
the identification and safeguarding of those 
parts of the heritage which are located on 
their own territories is primarily their own 
responsibility and agree to do all they can, 
with their own resources and with any inter- 
national assistance they can obtain, to 
ensure adequate protection. They agree, 
amongst other things, to “adopt a general 
policy which aims to give the cultural and 
natural heritage a function in the life of the 
community and to integrate protection of 
the heritage into comprehensive planning 
programmes”. 
The Convention is administered by the 
World Heritage Committee, composed of

focuses upon on-going processes in the develop- 
ment of communities, of plants and animals, 
land-forms and marine and freshwater bodies; 
3. contain superlative natural phenomena, for- 
mations or features, such as outstanding exam- 
ples of the most important ecosystems, areas of 
exceptional natural beauty, or exceptional 
combinations of natural and cultural elements; 
4. contain the most important and significant 
natural habitats where threatened species of 
animals or plants of outstanding universal 
value from the point of view of science or con- 
servation still survive. 
In addition to the above criteria, the sites 
should also fulfil the following conditions of 
integrity: 
(a) The sites described in 1. should contain all 
or most of the key interrelated and inter- 
dependent elements in their natural relation- 
ships; for example, an “Ice Age” area would be 
expected to include the snow field, the glacier 
itself and samples of cutting patterns, depo- 
sition and colonization (striations, moraines, 
pioneer stages of plant succession, etc.). 
(b) The sites described in 2. should have suffi- 
cient size and contain the necessary elements to 
demonstrate the key aspects of the process and 
to be self-perpetuating. For example, an area 
of “tropical rain forest” may be expected to 
include some variation in elevation above sea 
level, changes in topography and soil types, 
river banks or ox-bow lakes, to demonstrate 
the diversity and complexity of the system,

Unesco and a number of its officials are 
also members of the Man and the Bio- 
sphere (MAB) Secretariat, in particular 
those concerned with biosphere reserves.

(¢) The sites described in 3. should contain 
those ecosystem components required for the 
continuity of the species or of the objects to be 
conserved. This will vary according to the indi- 
vidual cases; for example, the protected area of 
a waterfall would include all, or as much as 
possible, of the supporting upstream water- 
shed; or a coral reef area would be provided 
with control over siltation or pollution through 
the stream flow or ocean currents which 
provide its nutrients. 
(d) The area containing threatened species as 
described in 4. should be of sufficient size and 
contain the necessary habitat requirements for 
the survival of the species. 
(e) In the case of migratory species, seasonal 
sites necessary for their survival, wherever 
they are located, should be adequately pro- 
tected. The Committee must receive 
assurances that the necessary measures will be 
taken to ensure that the species are adequately 
protected throughout their full life cycle. 
Agreements made in this connection, either 
through adherence to international con- 
ventions or in the form of other multilateral or 
bilateral arrangements, would provide this 
assurance, 
Each site should be evaluated relatively, that is, 
it should be compared with other sites of the 
same type, both inside and outside the State 
Party’s borders, within a biogeographic 
province or migratory pattern. . 
tion of World Heritage sites (see above) 
and biosphere reserves are different, far 
from being incompatible they are comple- 
mentary. Indeed, twenty-five World 
Heritage natural sites also form part of the

OWARDS the end of 1986, the 
| Riksdag, the Swedish Parliament, 
was the setting for an art exhibition 
with a difference. 
Consisting of a series of attractive water- 
colour landscapes, the exhibition was 
designed to bring home to the nation’s 
leaders the visual impact that their deci- 
sions could have upon the Swedish land- 
scape. 
The watercolours were, however, much 
more than an artist's personal impression 
of what might lie ahead. They were the fruit 
of a serious scientific research project 
which started in 1978 under the aegis of the 
Swedish National MAB Committee and the 
Committee of Future-oriented Research 
(both under the Swedish Council for Plan- 
ning and Co-ordination of Research). 
The Swedish landscape has undergone 
major changes since 1940. Approximately 
a quarter of all agricultural land has been 
taken out of production and has reverted 
naturally to forest or been planted with con 
ifers. Rapid urbanization, road building, the 
construction of recreational housing and 
the development of industrial sites along

the coast have also contributed to this 
transformation. 
The object of the Swedish MAB study 
was to develop a method of Visual Impact 
Analysis and to test it on a number of 
localities in Sweden, using scenarios pro- 
duced by others, so that it could be incor- 
porated into the planning and decision- 
making process. 
The first step was to select from a num- 
ber of previously completed future studies 
dealing with forestry, energy and agricul- 
ture those scenarios that were sufficiently 
detailed to enable their visual impacts to be 
deduced with reasonable precision. 
Four such future studies were deemed to 
fulfil these conditions: two alternative 
energy scenarios, “Nuclear Sweden” and 
“Solar Sweden”, presented by a project 
group of the Secretariat for Future Studies; 
a “High-Yield Alternative” for Swedish for- 
estry, produced by a government commis- 
sion on the future of Swedish forestry; 
and an alternative agricultural scenario 
produced by the Swedish Agricultural 
University. 
The Visual Impact Analysis method is

divided into three basic stages: (a) the 
analysis of a scenario and its application to 
a given locality; (b) the integration of 
information into instructions for the pro- 
duction of pictures; (c) the production and 
successive modification of a series of visual 
impact pictures. 
Once a locality has been chosen, a thor- 
ough study of all the background material is 
made including a historical reconstruction 
of the development of the landscape. Infor- 
mation on the geology, hydrology, past and 
present vegetation and land use of the area 
is gathered and a search is made in local, 
regional and national archives for maps 
and other documentary evidence. 
Specialists from a wide range of disci- 
plines are consulted concerning the back- 
ground material and reconstructions and a 
series of aerial and ground photographs 
are taken and drawings made at different 
times of the year. 
Field studies are made and checked 
against maps and other documentary evi- 
dence and all this background material is 
integrated into a series of maps and trans- 
parencies and superimposed on the aerial

photographs. Similar methods are used in 
elaborating the “portraits of the future”. 
The degree of confidence that can be 
placed in these reconstructions varies, of 
course, with the type of evidence available. 
With regard to the future projections and 
Visual Impact Analyses, the assumptions 
of the respective scenarios are followed 
whenever these are explicit. 
None of them involves technology or 
practices that are not now current and they 
all assume a “surprise-free” future. In the 
forestry alternatives, for example, normal 
and orderly forest development after plant- 
ing is assumed. 
A master perspective is used for each 
locality for the production of a complete 
series of pictures. The time of the year is 
also held constant, 
The artist draws preliminary pictures 
from the background material and the mas- 
ter perspective is produced by watercolour 
on a drawing. In fact, acrylic paint is used 
for these “watercolours” so that changes 
can be made later if necessary. 
The pictures are then reviewed by a num- 
ber of the experts who were consulted on 
the background material as weli as by other 
independent experts. On the basis of their 
assessments the original pictures may be 
modified or new ones made. [|

Born at 7.00 am on Saturday 11 July, 
1987, Matej Gaspar was the symbolic 
focus of worldwide celebration of the 
day the world population reached a 
total of five billion (5,000,000,000). 
The date, too, is symbolic since nobody 
knows exactly when the five billion total 
was actually reached. What we do 
know is that the number of human 
beings is now growing at a rate of 150 
every minute, 220,000 a day, 80 million 
a year. At this rate, according to the 
1987 State of World Population 
Report, published by the United 
Nations Fund for Population Activities 
(UNFPA), we will reach six billion by 
the end of the century, seven billion by 
the year 2010, and eight billion by the 
year 2022. Most of this growth will take 
place in the developing countries. It is 
estimated that world population will 
finally stabilize at around ten billion in 
. about a century from now. 


### 76539: Islands at risk

? 
Islands 
Greeks believed that the spirits of their 
dead heroes inhabited the Elysian 
Fields in the Isles of the Blest, far away to 
the west beyond Calpe and Abyla, the Pil- 
lars of Hercules. 
Centuries later, searching for Paradise, 
the Irish monk Saint Brendan (484-578) 
sailed far into the Atlantic Ocean, where he 
came upon an island of unsurpassed 
beauty and fertility which he believed to be 
the “Promised Land of the Saints”. Saint 
Brendan's sacred island remained clearly 
marked upon most maps for over a thou- 
sand years. Even today most travel agents 
have at least one “island paradise” on their 
books with which to tempt clients anxious 
“to get away from it all”. 
Is Hell an island? For millions of Africans 
sold into slavery, the Island of Gorée off the 
coast of Senegal, near Dakar, where they 
were held before being transported across 
the Atlantic, was the gateway to Hell, and 
few names so readily evoke the notion of 
Hell on earth as that of Devil's Island. 
Paradise or Purgatory, Heaven or Hell, 
islands leave no one indifferent, least of all 
scientists. It was no accident that Darwin's 
momentous The Origin of Species was the 
outcome of a voyage to the Galapagos, the 
Islas Encantadas, the “Enchanted Isles” as 
X Paradise an island? The ancient 
they were also called, for by their nature 
islands offer the scientist special oppor- 
tunities for research. As Darwin wrote of the 
Galapagos in his Journal on 8 October 
1835, “The archipelago is a little world 
within itself...”, and “The natural history of 
these islands is eminently curious and well 
deserves attention”. 
Echoes of these words can be heard | in 
those written almost a hundred and forty 
years later by a group of experts gathered 
in Paris, in 1973, to outline the scientific 
content of the MAB project on The Ecology 
and Rational Use of Island Ecosystems: 
“Islands offer an exceptional opportunity to 
study, under relatively controlled condi- 
tions, the entire spectrum of ecological, 
demographic, economic and social factors 
that influence population/environment rela- 
tionships. This is particularly true as popu- 
lation/environment systems on islands are 
small and easily modelled, and can at the 
same time be representative of larger sys- 
tems.” The final sentence of the above dec- 
laration not only re-introduced the notion of 
the island as a microcosm, Darwin's “little 
world within itself”, it also explains why 
MAB island research is concentrated on 
small islands. The 1973 meeting of experts 
defined “small” as meaning having a sur- 
face area of 10,000 square kilometres or 
less. 
Briefly stated, the objective of MAB 
island research is to promote sustainable

at risk 
development of small islands and rational 
management of their natural resources. 
A number of primary research themes 
have been selected as being necessary for 
the achievement of this objective: 
® the management of environmental 
resources by island populations; 
® the impact of external forces on islands, 
in particular the effects of tourism; 
® the impact of the introduction of alien 
plants and animals on island ecosystems; 
® the impact of migration; 
® the impact of agrochemicals on island 
environments and societies; 
e the islander's perception of his or her 
special social and natural environment. 
Implementation of these general lines of 
island research within MAB has been 
largely shaped by the situation and prob- 
lems of each specific island or island group. 
The South Pacific was the focus of initial 
island research work in MAB, followed by

studies in the Caribbean, Mediterranean 
and other regions. 
Experience from a selection of these 
projects provided one of the basic inputs to 
an inter-oceanic workshop on sustainable 
development and management of small 
islands, held in Puerto Rico in November 
1986. 
Organized by the US-MAB Directorate 
on Caribbean Islands, the workshop was 
sponsored by the MAB Committees of the 
United States and Canada, Unesco, UNEP 
and UNCTAD. 
The thirty invited specialists who took 
part came from five ocean basins and nine- 
teen countries, from cultures as diverse as 
those of Australia, Barbados, China, Fiji, 
France, Hawaii, Japan, Malta, St. Lucia and 
Yugoslavia, and from disciplinary back- 
grounds ranging from anthropology, ecol- 
ogy and economics to geography and 
sociology. 
This diversity among the participants 
attending the workshop mirrored the very 
wide diversity to be found amongst islands. 
Quite apart from the major division between 
continental islands (those that are unsub- 
merged parts of the continental shelf) and 
‘oceanic islands (those that rise from the 
floors of the ocean basins), there is a world 
of difference between the very small 
islands of the eastern Caribbean, the 
Pacific and the Atlantic, and, for example, 
Puerto Rico (8,887 square kilometres), 
Jamaica and Fiji. 
Islands are to be found in every latitude 
and in all climates. They occur singly, in 
groups, in archipelagos and in island arcs. 
There are high islands of continental rock, 
high. volcanic islands, raised limestone 
islands, coral atolls and sand cays. They 
may be populous or uninhabited, indepen- 
dent States or politically part of a conti- 
nental State, richly or poorly endowed by 
nature. 
Underlying this diversity, however, is the 
fundamental fact that small islands are in 
several respects specialized and rather 
fragile environments. They have a much 
higher proportion of endemic species than 
most continental regions, are subject to the 
action of the sea on all sides, and have only 
small fresh water catchments so that rain- 
fall and eroded material are constantly 
being lost to the sea. 
Island peoples have often evolved cul- 
tures that are distinct from those of conti- 
nental peoples and to which they feel a

### 76539: Islands at risk

strong allegiance. At the same time they 
are very vulnerable to the effects of outside 
economic, technological and social forces 
which can disrupt both their natural and 
cultural environment. 
Because small islands have only a lim- 
ited range of exploitable resources, the 
options for ecologically and economically 
sustainable development are restricted. 
Ultimately an island's natural 
resources—its water supply, soil, wildlife, 
forests and fisheries—will determine its 
capacity to accept and sustain develop- 
ment. 
Moreover, on a small island the margin 
for error is small. Even a comparatively 
minor miscalculation over the acceptable 
level of forest exploitation, for example, 
could seriously endanger the water supply, 
diminish animal wildlife, and result in 
excessive soil erosion and sedimentation 
" with .consequent adverse impacts on 
estuarine and marine resources. Even 
quite a small upswing in population can 
have devastating ecological and social 
effects. 
Much is still unknown or unclear regard- 
ing the mechanisms that regulate the rela- 
tionships between man and a limited 
environment, yet without a thorough under- 
standing of the resources available for 
development and the vulnerability of island 
resource systems to human activities, sus- 
tainable development will remain a hit- 
or-miss affair. 
Furthermore, ecological change can 
both cause and result from economic and 
. cultural changes. Effective resource man- 
agement must therefore strive to establish 
an equilibrium between economic con- 
straints, ecological imperatives and the 
social and cultural dimensions of each 
island society. u

Twenty key issues in island 
Islands have many problems in common with 
certain continental areas. Yet at the same time 
they provide a special case in development, 
largely owing to specific characteristics of their 
natural resources, their economies and their 
cultures. The developmental opportunities and 
constraints with which small islands (10,000 
square kilometres or less, population 500,000 
or less) are faced were thrown into relief at a 
MAB inter-oceanic workshop on small islands, 
held in Puerto Rico in November 1986, at 
which twenty key issues, briefly stated below, 
were determined and discussed: 
I. Sustainable development. Islands have a 
smaller capacity to absorb environmental 
impacts than larger areas. It is essential for 
islanders to understand and implement strat- 
egies of sustainable development. 
2. Diversity of islands. Found in every latitude 
and clime, islands vary from quite large popu- 
lous areas to tiny sand cays. With their small 
size, limited resource base, susceptibility to 
storm damage and drought, atolls exhibit 
many of the problems of small islands in their 
most extreme form. 
3. Open, specialized economies. Openness and 
specialization are the hallmarks of an island 
economy. In many cases dependent upon the 
export of one or two specialized crops, small 
islands are often obliged to import many con- 
sumer goods, including food. 
4. Private sector involvement. The private sec- 
tor has much to contribute to development pol- 
icy. Transnational and local companies have a 
major responsibility with regard to waste man- 
agement, toxic materials control and energy 
conservation. 
5. Distortions in island economies. Island econ- 
omies are subject to distortions due to socially 
or politically motivated transfer payments of 
various Kinds. The significance and effects of 
these distortions have not always been fully 
recognized. 
6. Transport. Many small islands have serious 
external transportation problems. For island 
groups there is often a problem of maintaining 
an adequate outer-island transport service. 
7. Demographic issues. Small islands are sub- 
ject to cycles of rapid demographic change 
that go far beyond those related to natural 
birth and death rate balances (see Salipa case 
study, opposite page). 
8. Employment. Small population size and 
migration mean that the fine balance between 
manpower supply and demand is easily 
upset. 
9. Decision-making. Integration of scientific 
concepts into managing island environments is 
often given low political priority. This stems 
partly from a lack of information available to 
decision-makers. 
10. Natural resources. Natural resources, on 
which sustainable development ultimately 
depends, are among the most vulnerable sec- 
tors of island economies. 
11. Forestry. Conservation of forest cover is 
essential for small islands for watershed pro- 
tection and as a guarantee against soil 
erosion. 
12. Land management. Land-use problems on 
islands largely result from the conflict between 
change and development and traditional sys- 
tems. In many cases loss of traditional forms of 
land ownership is increasing the fragmentation 
of landholdings. 
13. Water. Only the largest and wettest high 
islands have ample resources of water, and 
even on some of these there are seasonal 
shortages. 
14. Energy. Many islands depend almost 
totally on imported fossil fuels, although use of 
wood and charcoal continues. Solar energy is 
already important on some islands and biogas 
digesters are in use in a few areas. 
15. Conservation. Small islands are often the 
site of rare but fragile ecosytems, many of

development 
which are in danger of disappearing through 
lack of conservation policies. The introduction 
of exotic species represents an additional threat 
to native wildlife species. 
16. Coastal and marine ecosystems. An island’s 
coastline is often its most valuable region, but 
unregulated industrial and tourist develop- 
ment projects are liable to cause irreparable 
damage. Pollution from mining and forest 
activities are causing extensive damage to 
coastal areas and marine life in some high 
islands of the western Pacific. 
17. Fisheries. Island fisheries in the tropics and 
the Mediterranean are mainly small-scale and 
conducted on artisanal lines. In tropical 
islands, fishing for export is often hampered by 
problems of storage and marketing. 
18. Agriculture. Island agriculture systems 
range from subsistence farming to the produc- 
tion of export cash crops. The fall in demand 
for sugarcane and copra has been a serious 
blow to certain island economies. 
19. Industry. The smallness of islands is a 
severe constraint on industrial development. 
There is, however, some scope for value- 
adding semi-manufacture. 
20. Tourism and allied services. Climate and 
beaches are islands’ main tourist attractions, 
but tourism as a major industry requires 
investment in infrastructure. Military use of 
strategically placed islands is comparable with 
tourism in its economic effects. x 
Above, the Greek island of Halki, to the west 
of Rhodes, is one of a dozen small islands in 
the Mediterranean that are working together 
to solve their environmental problems with a 
helping hand from Unesco’s Man and the 
Biosphere Programme. Right, the island of 
Salina, in the Aeolian Archipelago, is one of 
the sites studied as part of MAB research on 
the ecology and use of small islands.

### 76541: Pirates, parasites and population, a case study

A CASE STUDY 
Pirates, parasites 
and population 
have experienced cycles of rapid 
demographic change. This may be 
due to the impact of outside forces beyond 
their control or to the fact that their econo- 
mies are based on a single specialized crop 
at the mercy of disease and the caprices of 
the market. 
"Pirates and parasites were the cause of 
the vicissitudes of Salina, a small island 
lying to the north of Sicily in the Aedlian 
Archipelago. 
For centuries, fear of pirates in the Archi- 
pelago was such that only Lipari, with its 
powerful fortifications, had a stable popula- 
tion, while Salina and the other Aeolian 
islands remained virtually uninhabited. 
Even Lipari finally succumbed. In the 
Aeolian islands they still commemorate the 
terrible siege of July 1544, when Khayr- 
ad-Din, the Barbary pirate better known as 
Barbarossa (Red-beard), seized the for- 
tress and carried off into slavery some 
9,000 inhabitants, almost the entire popula- 
tion of the island. 
Salina remained largely unsettled until 
the arrival of the French and British fleets in 
the Mediterranean, and a campaign by 
Admiral Nelson, finally eliminated the pirate 
scourge. 
Already in the mid-eighteenth century, as 
pirate power started to decline, the Bene- 
dictine order, a considerable landowner in 
the area, had begun leasing its lands on 
Salina on favourable terms to a number of 
private entrepreneurs. The latter broughtin 
landless immigrants from other islands of 
the archipelago, as well as from Genoa, 
Naples and Sicily, to work the vineyards 
that had been established on terraces on 
the volcanic formation, about 900 metres 
above sea level. 
Sh islands throughout the world 
  
The vineyards of Salina specialized in 
Malmsey, a wine much in demand in 
England. Trade prospered and the farmers 
were able to buy their lands. By 1860, 
Salina boasted 8,000 inhabitants, most of 
them engaged in the cultivation of grapes 
and the production and shipping of wine. 
At the end of the century, however, an 
infestation of the Phylloxera parasite des- 
troyed the vineyards on Salina. Earnings on 
the island dropped sharply and, lacking the 
capital to survive during the period required 
to restore the vineyards, local families 
began to emigrate in large numbers to 
Argentina, the United States and, later, to 
Australia. In a relatively short time, the 
population fell to under 2,000. 
Although the vineyards were rehabilita- 
ted prior to the Second World War, the 
population has only recently risen to a total 
of 2,300. 
Salina’s period of economic develop- 
ment lasted only about sixty years. Its rapid 
settlement was based on a specific oppor- 
tunity to take advantage of an existing mar- 
ket to earn a good living. 
Rapid emigration followed the Phylloxera 
infestation. Inthe absence of long-term cre- 
dit with which to restore their vineyards, and 
in view of inducements offered to emigrate 
to other areas where land was made availa- 
ble at low cost, many farmers took the easy 
way out, even though it meant leaving their 
native island and, in some cases, their fami- 
lies as well. 
For Salina, dependence upon a single 
product led first to rapid population growth 
and then, following a natural disaster, to 
rapid emigration—a clear example of the 
risk involved for a small island of basing its 
economy on a single specialized crop. ®

### 76542: Information please

24 
The most accurate, up-to-date 
research data will be worthless 
unless they are presented with 
the end user’s objectives in 
mind 
Information please 
seventeenth century, Alexander Pope 
wrote: 
Nature and Nature's laws lay hid in night; 
God said, “Let Newton be!” and all 
was light. 
Somewhat more than two centuries later, 
in a light-hearted pastiche of Pope, Sir John 
Collings Squire paid his own wry tribute to 
the greatest scientist of the twentieth 
century: 
It did not last: the Devil howling “Ho! 
Let Einstein be!” restored the status quo. 
The two couplets are of more than merely 
anecdotal interest. They highlight the tre- 
mendous volume and complexity of scien- 
tific advance in the 229 years between the 
publication of Newton’s Principia Mathe- 
matica (1687) and of Einstein's The Foun- 
dation of the General Theory of Relativity 
N a tribute to the greatest scientist of the 
(1916). 
Publication of scientific information 
increased in parallel with scientific 
advance. Beginning with two journals that 
started publication in 1665 (the Journal des 
Scavans and the Philosophical Transac- 
tions of the Royal Society of London), the 
number of scientific periodicals has grown 
enormously. Estimates of the present num- 
ber of such journals vary from 25,000 to 
100,000 (the wide variation being due to 
differing opinions as to which publications 
qualify as scientific journals). 
To publications such as these must now 
be added an overwhelming mass of report 
literature (the periodic reports often 
required by organizations sponsoring 
research), papers published by informa- 
tion-exchange groups, newsletters, 
reviews and abstracting services, 
reference books, handbooks and manuals. 
For the scientist struggling to cope with 
this rising flood of information, with which 
he must contend if he is to keep abreast of 
his subject, the immediate solution has 
been to narrow his field of interest by 
increasing his degree of specialization. 
This in turn has contributed to the fragmen- 
tation of the major disciplines into ever 
smaller subject areas, each with its own 
specialized data bases, newsletters, 
periodicals, and so on. The net result has 
been a greater and greater amount of in- 
formation accessible to fewer and fewer 
specialists. 
Thisisnotto suggest thatthereis, orever 
will be, too much scientific information 
available. There is a striking parallel to be 
made between an apparent information 
glut and the “food mountains” that have 
grown in the West at a time when two-thirds 
of the world population is either mal- 
nourished or under-nourished. 
Part of the food problem is that in many 
cases the surpluses produced in the West 
are unsuitable, if not indigestible, to those in 
need of food elsewhere. 
The problem is somewhat similar with 
scientific research data. Decisions are 
made every day throughout the world which 
will affect the lives of millions of people, in 
complete disregard of scientific facts, sim- 
ply because those facts are not available to 
decision-makers in a form which they can 
apply, or to the people who will be affected 
in a form they can understand. 
To go back for a moment to Newton; the 
apocryphal story that his theory of gravity 
came to him when he was hit on the head by 
a falling apple while resting under ah apple 
tree was related to the everyday experi- 
ence of ordinary people. Because of this 
they gave credence to his assertion that the 
Universe was regulated by simple mathe- 
matical laws. 
Einstein, whose theory of relativity rel- 
ated to events outside the direct experience 
of almost the entire population of the globe, 
was less well served by a limerick 
published in the magazine Punch in 
December 1923: 
There was a young lady named Bright, 
Whose speed was far faster than light; 
She set out one day 
In a relative way, 
And got home the previous night. 
Fortunately, two events have occurred 
which have gone a long way towards 
resolving the information dilemma. 
The first, paradoxically, was the emer- 
gence of yet another scientific specializa- 
tion—ecology, which originated as an off- 
shoot of biology. By definition ecology is 
basically the study of relationships, of eco- 
systems, and, although it took some time to 
break their ingrained habits, ecologists 
found themselves working in teams made 
up of scientists from different specialities 
and therefore obliged to communicate 
between each other, to think in terms of 
other disciplines, other time scales, other 
objectives than their own. Horror of hor- 
rors—they even had to work with special- 
ists from the social sciences, which many of 
them did not consider to be “real” sciences 
at all. 
The second event was the arrival en 
masse of cheap, readily available compu- 
ters capable of handling huge quantities of 
data flexibly and at great speed. 
Suddenly the sum of human knowledge 
as related to a particular problem has 
become available at the price of a few 
strokes of the keyboard instead of hours, 
months or years of painstaking sifting 
through reams of paper. 
Suddenly the prospect is in sight of being 
able to ask such questions as: “What would 
happen if we were to cutdown 100 hectares 
of forest in West Africa?” and to get areply 
which covers not only the forestry aspects 
of such an action but the economic, social, 
human, wildlife and public health effects 
as well, 
As one of the world’s major international 
ecology programmes, Unesco’s Man and 
the Biosphere (MAB) Programme has 
played its part in this evolution. A com- 
puterized documentation system for MAB 
has been set up through an agreement with 
the Centre International de Documentation 
Agronomique pour les Regions Chaudes 
(CIDARC), at Montpellier, France. 
Research data on all of the 250 or so bio- 
sphere reserves are available on computer 
at the Conservation Monitoring Centre, in 
Cambridge, England, and a Biological 
Diversity Program to develop detailed com- 
puterized inventories of the biological 
resources of biosphere reserves following 
a standard protocol is being developed in 
co-operation with the Smithsonian Institu- 
tion, in Washington, D.C. 
More importantly, perhaps, MAB has 
tried to convince scientists that, to be effec- 
tive, information must be presented in a 
usable form that takes into account the tra- 
ditional knowledge, skills, and cultural, 
social and economic imperatives of those 
to whom it is being imparted. =

### 76543: The Canopy raft

  
ATELLITES, aircraft, ultra-light air- 
craft and tethered balloons all 
enable photographs and measure- 
ments to be taken from above the forest 
canopy. Something else is needed, 
however, for taking measurements and 
samples from within the canopy, hence the 
use of walkways and vertical towers at MAB 
research stations such as Sakaerat (Thai- 
land), Tai (Ivory Coast), and Dimonika- 
Mayombe (Congo). 
Another approach is to climb up into the 
canopy, either using the trunk as a means 
of support or directly into the branches from 
the ground or from a neighbouring tree. 
Abseiling is among the devices borrowed 
from rock-climbing that have been used in. 
scaling up and down the forest profile, but 
this is definitely not a technique to be 
recommended to the uninitiated or the faint- 
hearted. 
Recognition of the shortcomings of these 
methods led to the idea of using a hot air 
balloon as a method for studying the forest 
canopy. The idea was the brain-child of 
Francis Hallé, a botanist who has long been 
interested in the architecture of tropical for- 
est ecosystems, Dany Cleyet-Marrel, an 
  
  
aeronautic designer and owner of the bal- 
loon, and Gilles Ebersolt, a young balloon 
enthusiast and constructor. 
The Radeau des Cimes (canopy raft), as 
it was baptized by its French inventors, is 
31 metres long by 22 metres wide and con- 
sists of inflatable rubber cylinders con- 
nected by a sort of net trampoline made of 
PVC-covered Keviar. Weighing 750 Kilo- 
grams, the raft serves as the nacelle for the 
hot air balloon of 3,000 cubic metres to 
which it is attached by twelve cables. 
Once airborne, the raft skims downwind, 
just a few metres above the forest canopy. 
The two-man crew of pilot and scientist use 
a guide-rope to orient the raft and to land it 
on top of the canopy. Once the raftis landed 
and secured, the balloon is deflated and 
folded away and the scientific work can 
begin. Liaison with a ground team is estab- 
lished by means of a caving cable, which 
enables other scientists to have access to 
the canopy. 
Initial results have been promising. After 
trials with a helicopter-landed, 12 by 12 
metre prototype raft in the Forest of Pilat, in 
France, in October 1985, the first field trials 
in the tropics took place in October 1986 in

French Guyana, in the region of Montsin- 
ery. Samples were taken of trees, lianas 
and parasitic plants, which were then con- 
served using a method perfected by the 
British Museum of Natural History in 
London, Ultra-violet lamps and interception 
nets were among the methods used for col- 
lecting insects, particular emphasis being 
given to two groups of beetles. Other obser- 
vations and sampling concerned epiphytic 
plants, ant gardens and atmospheric 
pollen. 
If all goes well, a second set of trials, to be 
held in late 1987 at the MAB project site of 
Makokou, in Gabon, will seek to associate 
other scientific disciplines in addition to 
those that took part in the first series—med- 
ical entomology and parasitology, bio- 
climatology and mammalogy, ornithology 
and floral biology. 
First, however, a number of improve- 
ments need to be made in the basic opera- 
 
tion of the canopy raft. These include an 
increase in upward force, improvement of 
visibility through the nets, improvement of 
access from the soil, improvement of night 
use and the addition of a directional move- 
ment capability. At a post-trial meeting held 
in Paris in December 1986, the feeling was 
that these various improvements shouid all 
be technically feasible, although a fair 
amount of financial sponsorship would be 
required. 
It might well be asked what was the role 
of Unesco/MAB in all this. In truth, it was 
very modest—moral support plus a few 
thousand dollars. But, as in other similar 
instances, the small amount of financial 
support from Unesco (in this case a joint 
effort with UNEP, the United Nations 
Environment Programme) was “put up 
front”. It was made available at the very 
early risk-taking stage of the project. This 
“pump-priming” support was useful to the 
Fie. 
leader of the project, Francis Hallé, in 
attracting more substantive funding from 
public and private sources such as the 
French Ministry of the Environment and 
National Research Council, the Office for 
Scientific Co-operation Overseas 
(ORSTOM), the national petroleum com- 
pany (Elf/Antargaz), and a national televi- 
sion channel, Antenne 2. 
Already the initial success of the canopy 
raft has had considerable coverage in 
newspapers and magazines, both in 
France and abroad. In addition, one film, for 
the scientific audience, has just been com- 
pleted and another, for a more general 
public, is in the making. Francis Hallé and 
his team hope that this publicity will help to 
attract further support for this novel way of 
entering the enchanted, unknown world of 
the forest canopy. = 
African Mountains Association created 
at Addis Ababa Mountains and Highlands Workshop 
The need for research and development strat- 
egies, resource management and food security; 
. man’s role in changing the mountain environ- 
ment in Africa; processes and consequences of 
change until the end of the century—these were 
among the issues taken up at an international 
workshop held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, from 
18 to 27 October, 1986. 
The workshop was attended by scholars 
from ten African and seven non-African coun- 
tries. Some thirty-six papers were presented on 
a range of topics covering the characteristics of 
African mountain ecosystems, land use, 
environmental problems in general and soil 
erosion and conservation in particular. Both 
in the papers and during an extensive four- 
day field excursion, practical responses to 
solving environmental problems were 
demonstrated. 
The close inter-relationship between 
environmental degradation and rural poverty 
was a central theme for discussion. The general 
feeling of the workshop was that while the sit- 
uation was critical in many regions there was 
also room for optimism. 
Reflecting both this optimism and also the 
feeling that there was a serious need for 
remedial action, the workshop concluded with 
the creation of an African Mountains Associa- 
tion. The new Association intends to maintain 
close working contacts between the partici- 
pants and to enlarge progressively into an 
effective force for research and action, and will 
work closely with international programmes 
such as MAB. 
A first step will be the publication of the 
proceedings of the workshop. Participants felt 
that the collated papers and field demonstra- 
tions would constitute the most important body 
of literature now available on African moun- 
tain and highland ecosystems. 
The participants also unanimously adopted a 
series of resolutions which address issues of 
resource development in African mountain and 
highland regions. =

  centre of the universe and the axis of 
the world. This mythical golden moun- 
tain, Mount Meru, is the abode of the gods 
and the Himalayas are its foothills. It 
extends down into the nether regions of the 
Earth as far as it reaches up into the heav- 
ens. On Mount Meru, say the Hindu scrip- 
tures, “there are rivers of sweet water run- 
ning, and beautiful golden houses in which 
live the spiritual beings, the Deva". 
From Fujiyama to Olympus to Sinai, 
every high mountain has been looked upon 
with awe and reverence by those who live 
within its shadow. Indeed, so strong has 
been this instinctive sense of the sacred 
nature of mountains that even the plains- 
men of Mesopotamia felt the need to con- 
struct artificial mountains, the “ziggurats”, 
in an attempt to reach upwards to the 
gods. 
Perhaps this is because each one of us 
has his own interior mountain to climb, to 
enjoy and to revere. Even today, when men 
have stood upon the summit of Mount Ever- 
est, the challenge and the reverence 
remain. A mountain must be climbed, 
revered and preserved, in the famous 
mountaineering phrase, “because it's 
there”. 
Strangely enough, for all our natural 
interest in mountains, there is no standard 
geological definition of a mountain. The 
most we seem able to say of them is that 
mountains are landforms that rise promi- 
nently above their surroundings, generally 
having steep slopes, a relatively confined 
summit area and considerable local 
relief.

thought to have given rise to the story of the 
Tower of Babel.  Ph

A Nepalese village in the Himalayas Yet even if only areas above 1,000 
metres in altitude are considered to be 
mountainous, the mountain regions of the 
world are vast in extent. 
“ Some 10 per cent of the world’s popula- 
tion actually live in mountainous areas and 
approximately 40 per cent or more depend 
on mountain resources, whether for miner- 
als, timber, agriculture, water, energy or 
recreation. 
Because man's impact on mountains is 
mainly in rather than above the vegetation 
belt, the mountain ecologist tends to think 
of mountains as areas, at all elevations, 
where there is significant ecological dif- 
ferentiation inthe vertical sense, and where 
there are continuous interactions between 
the ecological belts at different altitudes, 
including, in particular, interactions associ- 
ated with human activities, since mans the 
most important factor for change in most 
mountain ecosystems. 
How great is man’s impact on the moun- 
tain regions of the world? For centuries 
highlanders have lived in partnership and 
equilibrium with nature, creating some of 
the most harmonious landscapes in the 
world. Today, however, the world is shrink- 
ing, and from the Alps to the Andes the 
pressures of population growth and move- 
ment and the demands of development are 
placing this equilibrium in danger. Two 
MAB research studies have shown how this 
has come about. 
For many centuries, human habitation in 
the central Andes was concentrated mainly 
in the altiplanos, or high plateaux, with set- 
tlements spanning the range from isolated 
rural communities to large urban centres. 
The adjacent downslope areas were more 
sparsely settled, particularly the tropical 
forest areas in the lowlands adjoining the 
Andes. During this century, and especially 
since the 1950s, there have been great 
movements of population to the urban 
areas in the mountains, to the lower altitude 
areas and, above all, to the coastal towns 
and cities. 
Emigration from the highland areas 
results in part from growing population 
pressure on a limited resource base and in 
part from areal or expected better quality of 
life in other areas. For a variety of social and 
political reasons the patterns of land exploi- 
tation established in the altiplanos after the 
Spanish conquest remained static and,

### 76544: Mountain challenge

  
when faced with rapid population growth, 
the capacity of the highland areas to sup- 
port ever-increasing numbers was soon 
stretched to the limit. The result was over- 
use of land, particularly over-grazing, a 
decline in productivity and a consequent 
increase in emigration, especially among 
the younger and more dynamic people. 
Migration on the scale experienced in the 
Andes over the past two decades has 
affected the environment through over-use 
in some areas and under-use in others. 
Today, for the first time, the down-slope 
areas below the altiplanos are being mas- 
sively exploited. Unfortunately, lack of 
sound agricultural practice is leading to 
accelerated erosion of the soil which not 
only affects the productivity of these areas 
directly but also has a negative effect on 
lowland areas. 
Migration is putting serious pressure on 
the housing and health services and other 
amenities in the urban areas, especially in 
the coastal towns and cities to which the 
population flow is greatest. The health 
problems are enormous since the altiplano 
populations arriving in the humid low alti- 
tude areas are especially vulnerable to

bacterial, viral, parasitic and microbial 
infections against which they have no 
natural immunity. 
In the Alps, population movement has 
been in two directions. The traditional 
mountain populations are abandoning 
some of the higher altitude areas, while 
adjacent lower areas are becoming com- 
paratively crowded. But the main cause for 
concern is the transformation of what was 
formerly a relatively stable agricultural and 
pastoral system, due to seasonal inflows of 
people from outside the area on such avast 
scale that the carrying capacity of these 
areas may well be exceeded. 
These inflows are made up of summer 
and winter tourists and weekend visitors 
from the densely populated neighbouring 
regions. To these must be added owners 
of second homes, who often become per- 
manent residents upon retirement, Many 
traditional villages, Alpine pasturelands 
and, indeed, whole valleys can no longer 
meet the demands of this additional popu- 
lation for avalanche-safe building land, 
water, roads, energy supplies, ski-lifts 
and ski-runs. 
Agriculture, too, is very much affected— 
not only in tourist areas but throughout the 
Alpine region. New attitudes towards agri- 
cultural work and rural life are as important 
as the increasingly marginal profitability of 
agricultural and pastoral use of steep and 
isolated mountain lands in provoking the 
abandonment of certain areas or the 
appearance of such phenomena as under- 
grazing. As fewer and fewer pathways for 
the herds remain available, the old practice 
of transhumance (the moving of livestock 
from winter to summer pastures) is disap- 
pearing in the western Alps. One side effect 
of this abandonment of grazing land is that 
changes in the vegetation cover create sur- 
faces more conducive to avalanches. 
The direct effects of the massive 
increase in the number of skiers over the 
past fifteen years must also be taken into 
account. Aerial photographic surveys have 
shown how much the impacting of snow by 
thousands of ski descents every winter hin- 
ders the run-off of water inthe spring. Vege- 
tation is destroyed by the cutting edges of 
skis and it has been found that along the ski 
runs the insect population is decimated and 
the number of earthworms per square 
metre along some trails has been reduced 
from 130 to ten. 
These are but two examples of the prob- 
lems facing mountain regions throughout 
the world as a result of population pressure, 
social change and the needs of develop- 
ment. Even the mighty Himalayas are not 
untouched. In Nepal, for example, 
deforestation and erosion, coupled with an 
influx of adventure-seeking tourist- 
trekkers, are taking their toll. 
To Edward Whymper (1840-1911), the 
artist and mountaineer who was the first 
man to climb the Matterhorn, an unclimbed 
mountain was “an affront to man’s con- 
quest of nature”. Today, man’s spoliation of 
the mountains he has revered for centuries 
will, if left unchecked, become the ultimate 
affront to nature. =

### 76546: Lake Baikal; the world's deepest lake holds one-fifth of the fresh water on the surface of the Earth

Lake Baikal 
 
The world’s deepest lake holds one-fifth of the fresh water 
on the surface of the Earth 
EY 4 
contains in its basin more than 
23,000 cubic kilometres of fresh 
water. This represents about 20 per cent of 
the world's fresh water reserves and 80 per 
cent of the total surface fresh water 
reserves of the USSR. This is about the 
same amount as is contained in all the five 
North American Great Lakes put together. 
The lake, into which 336 rivers and 
| AKE Baikal, the world's deepest lake, 
streams flow, is home to some 2,600 spe- 
cies of plants and animals. Three-quarters 
of these species—as well as eleven 
families and sub-families and ninety-six 
genera—are endemic to the lake. 
Scientists at the Siberian branch of the 
USSR Academy of Sciences, based at the 
Limnological Institute at Irkutsk, have been 
studying Lake Baikal for many years and 
have obtained a wealth of data on such 
aspects as water inputs, nutrient flows, 
sedimentation rates, trophic relationships, 
benthic and littoral fish communities, prod- 
uctivity of phytoplankton and zooplankton, 
and the effect of vertical stratification of the 
water column on the distribution of organ- 
isms of all trophic groups. Quantitative 
measures of biomass and productivity 
include an estimated average total net 
weight biomass of invertebrates of 750,000 
tons, of which 40 per cent is comprised of 
300 benthos. 
Research has highlighted the dynamic 
nature of the Baikal ecosystem and the 
intricacy of the interactions between the 
lake and its surroundings. Pollution through 
water recycled by industrial (particularly 
cellulose) plants is a major threat to water 
quality, which in turn is crucial to the plant 
and animal communities living in the lake. 
One cubic metre of re-circulated water from 
a cellulose plant, normally diluted in more 
than 1,000 cubic metres of lake water, is not 
capable of supporting life. When it is con-

plants are re-circulating more than 300,000 
cubic metres of water per day (water con- 
taining highly toxic components which, 
even at low concentrations, may affect the 
life and behaviour of living organisms), the 
importance of the threat to the Lake Baikal 
ecosystem can readily be appreciated. 
It is in this context that Dr. G.I. Galazy 
and fellow scientists from the Irkutsk 
Institute have mounted a sustained public 
education campaign to inform the Soviet 
people about the uniqueness of Lake 
Baikal, of the importance of its biota and of 
-the present and projected effects of human 
activities on the lake. 
Public awareness about these issues 
has been raised throughout the Soviet 
Union by a concerted programme involving 
the press, television and radio and calling

on the skills of journalists, science writers 
and other communications specialists. 
At the same time, government officials 
have been regularly informed about the sit- 
uation, and this whole process has trig- 
gered a change in attitudes towards the 
economic policy in the Baikal drainage 
basin and the conservation status of the 
lake ecosystem. 
In April 1986, as a result of these efforts 
to change public opinion and policy, the 
Lake Baikal Region Biosphere Reserve 
was approved by the MAB Bureau as a new 
addition to the international network of bio- 
sphere reserves. And on 2 April 1987, the 
Government of the USSR issued a new law 
concerning the protection and redevelop- 
ment of Lake Baikal and its surroundings, 
. as well as plans to close the cellulose 
industry in the area within the next five 
years. The whole process is instructive of 
how scientists’ observations and under- 
standing can be put to good use in chang- 
ing policy, and underscores the role of 
scientists in initiating and providing the 
basic information for educational pro- 
grammes for the public at large. » 


### 76547: The Poetry of Ilya Chavchavadze

The poetry 
of Ilya Chavchavadze 
by Gaston Bouatchidzé and Edouard Glissant 
Gaston Bouatchidzé: The work of Ilya 
Chavchavadze (1837-1907) fits naturally 
into the literary tradition of Georgia, the 
origins of which can be traced back to the 
fifth century. The poetical works which pre- 
ceded and paved the way for his own 
include, first and foremost, The Knight in 
the Panther’s Skin by Shota Rustaveli 
(twelfth century), the Davitiani by David 
Guramishvili (eighteenth century) and the 
poetry of the romantic Nikoloz Baratashvili 
(first half of the nineteenth century). 
However, the period spanned by the life of 
Ilya Chavchavadze coincides with a unique 
chapter in the history of the country. The 
poet sets out to be its chronicler, and both 
his poetic inspiration and his craft are influ- 
enced by this, being shaped by the dictates 
of the author’s views. If Rustaveli is the 
master of epic and philosophical poetry, a 
virtuoso of richly musical and varied verse, 
Guramishvili the craftsman of the most 
wide-ranging poetic metre and of con- 
structions that are both brilliant and strik- 
ing, and Baratashvili the lyricist of suffering 
and melancholy, the poetry of Ilya 
Chavchavadze is outstanding in its deliber- 
Ph

s 
ate purity of form and transparency, in 
keeping with his generous breadth of vision. 
Clarity and directness of impact are the 
essential characteristics of his work. 
Edouard Glissant: The poetry of 
Chavchavadze does, indeed, have the 
power and refinement to be found in all 
literature which strikes a strong popular 
chord and marks a new departure. In this 
respect it is reminiscent of the French six- 
teenth-century poets such as Jean de 
Sponde or Jean-Baptiste Chassignet. At the 
same time, it is almost symbolist in its musi- 
cal qualities, and speaks, besides, with the 
perfectly controlled voice of modernity. 
Here we find a lyrical encounter between 
personal feeling and collective destiny. 
G.B.: I should like, in this connection, to 
Still from the 1958 Soviet film “The Widow 
Otarova”, which was adapted for the screen 
from Ilya Chavchavadze’s 1887 novel describ- 
ing the misery of serfdom and the decline of 
the feudal system.

### 76547: The Poetry of Ilya Chavchavadze

recall the variety of Ilya Chavchavadze’s 
writings: the poet in him is closely seconded 
by the prose writer, and the publicist goes 
hand in hand with the militant humanist and 
organizer of various aspects of community 
life. This means that the same, or similar, 
themes run through his work, and, as it 
were, resonate in sympathy with the preoc- 
cupations of the century, and in particular 
those of writers such as Pushkin, Victor 
Hugo and Tolstoy. Those themes include, 
for example, humanism (including the 
demand to abolish the death penalty), 
social justice, truth at all costs, fervent 
patriotism and the need to educate and 
enlighten the people. : 
E.G.: Such poetry is remarkably relevant 
today. I am thinking of the quotation from 
Leibniz that Chavchavadze chose as an 
introduction to his poem Mother Georgia: 
“The present, born of the past, in turn 
begets the future.” Historical memory, with 
all its light and shade, is the background to 
all identity, particularly in the present age, 
when different cultures and civilizations 
impinge on one another. Poetry throughout 
the world needs both the universal and the 
particular. Here again, I think that 
Chavchavadze affords an instructive exam- 
ple. Moreover, the “tone” of the language is 
The Poet 
I do not sing for singing’s sake, 
As does the bird upon the tree; 
Nor was it for sweet sounds alone 
That God created me. 
God chooses me; the people shape 
And temper me for my vocation, 
And I commune with God, that I 
May rise and lead my nation. 
My heart burns with a holy flame 
That all my strength I may employ 
To serve my people faithfully 
In sorrow and in joy. 
O let my people’s suffering 
Be branded on my soul, I ask— 
And let my heart, through good and ill, 
Be equal to its task! 
If in my heart the spark divine 
Will kindle fire to banish fears, 
Then I will raise my people up, 
And I will dry their tears! 
Pavlovsk, 
23 July 1860 
Poem 
The soulless life is not 
A gift that falls like rain: 
What merely lives and dies 
Returns to dust again. 
A soul that yearns to act 
Lights up our path, our goals, 
And makes them Infinite 
Like He who gives us souls. 
Blest is the man whose life 
With noble deeds doth shine, 
For, mortal, he shall drink 
Of the immortal wine. 
St. Petersburg, 
audible through the translation. But I sup- 
pose that, asin the case of Pushkin, much of 
the melody is necessarily lost? 
G.B.: In this respect I might offer for com- 
parison my previous experience as a transla- 
tor of Georgian poetry into French. In 
translating Rustaveli’s The Knight in the 
Panther’s Skin (to be co-published by 
Publications Orientalistes de France and 
Raduga of Moscow in 1988), I kept to the 
single rhyme of the quatrains and tried, as 
far as possible, to transpose the music of the 
verses. On the other hand, in the case of a 
modern poet, Galaktion Tabidze, whose 
“Skull with Artistic Flowers” will be 
published this year in Tbilisi in a bilingual 
(Georgian-French) edition, I dispensed 
with rhyme in order to keep more closely to 
the poet’s variations of rhythm. With Ilya 
Chavchavadze the problem was primarily 
one of maintaining the structures suited to 
his form of poetic expression, and rendering 
his tone, which is both sober and vigorous. 
E.G.: That sobriety reveals both the grace 
of a language and the charm of the poet. I 
hope that the translations which will appear 
in the different language editions of the 
Courier will make our readers want to 
become better acquainted with the poetry 
of Chavchavadze. | 
Night 
When the feverish din of the busy day is 
hushed, 
And the droning voices of Evil at last are 
still, 
And, cradled beneath the sky, the village 
sleeps, 
Then, southern night! on you I gaze my fill. 
(1857-1861) 
Poem 
My hopes are crushed and all my dreams are 
fled 
All lost, all gone. I am alone again. 
The arrow loosed from love's despairing 
bow, 
Piercing my heart, surrendered me to pain. 
Cursed by our meeting, in an ill-starred 
hour. 
Where was this paragon of virtue bred? 
And you, my heart, erstwhile subdued and 
calm, 
What force was this that made you raise the 
dead? 
All that I am is hers—she is not mine. 
And she holds out, adoringly, to sate 
Another's thirst, her heady cup of love, 
While I can only rail against my fate. 
To whom shall 1 confide my tale of woe? 
The door is barred, and I am left outside. 
My sickness has no cure, and there can be 
No words to comfort me, when hope has 
died.

### 76548: Les Kurbas, founder of Ukrainian theatre

by Nelly Nicolaevna 
Kornienko 
HE worldwide interest currently 
} being shown in Les Kurbas (1887- 
1942) is by no means fortuitous. As 
the end of the twentieth century 
approaches, people are beginning to feel 
the need for a “Renaissance personality”, a 
leader in the arts and a philosopher. Kurbas 
was such a personality. He was an actor, 
playwright, translator, stage and cinema 
director with original ideas about the func- 
tion of the theatre. A disciple of 
Melpomene, the Muse of Tragedy, his 
greatest claim to fame is that he evolved a 
strategy of culture. That is why his ideas on 
aesthetics continue to interest people nearly 
half a century after his death. 
The name of Les Kurbas, founder of 
Soviet Ukrainian theatre, figures among 
the greatest in the history of dramatic art— 
Konstantin ~~ Stanislavsky,  Vsevolod 
Meyerhold and Yevgeny Vakhtangov, 
Max Reinhardt, Edward Gordon Craig 
and Bertolt Brecht. 
Kurbas was born in Galicia (then part of 
the Austro-Hungarian empire), into a fam- 
ily of well-known Ukrainian actors, the 
Yanovichs. Educated at the universities of 
Vienna and Lvov, he studied several lan- 
guages, including English, so that he could 
read Shakespeare in the original; Nor- 
wegian, in order to understand Ibsen; and 
Sanskrit, because he was particularly inter- 
ested in the East. Thus he came to his 
national culture "in the spirit of a 
‘reformer. 
He established a Youth Theatre in 1917, 
with the intention of producing plays drawn 
from different cultures throughout the 
world. This quite exceptional and successful 
experiment in theatre work lasted until 
1919. Enthusiastic audiences wearing 
sweaters and leg-warmers (it was the time of 
the Civil War and the country was in a state 
of economic dislocation) saw various 
plays—a brilliant production of Oedipus 
Rex, the first of Sophocles’ works to be 
performed on the Soviet stage; Zhulavsky’s 
fanciful, impressionistic Yola; Shev- 
chenko’s expressionistic masterpiece Jan 
Huss; intellectual plays such as Lesya 
Ukrainka’s In the Thicket; one of the 
national folklore theatre’s colourful Christ- 
mas productions; and, later on, plays by 
Shakespeare, Moliére, Schiller, Hugo, 
Crommelynck and Grillparzer. 
Kurbas brought Ukrainian theatre to the 
forefront of Soviet and European cultural 
life. As early as 1925, at the World Fair in 
Paris, the design for one of his productions 
won a gold medal for the Soviet Union. 
Osip Mandelstam, major Soviet poet and 
literary critic, who was anything but compli- 
mentary about the theatre, showed great 
insight when he said that Kurbas would be 
renowned as the founder of Ukrainian 
theatre. 
Much of Kurbas’ work in the theatre was Ph

s 
based on the idea that “man is a micro- 
cosm”, as postulated by the eighteenth-cen- 
tury Ukrainian philosopher Grigori 
Skovoroda. Skovoroda’s teaching on the 
“inner man”, the value of the spirit and the 
worth of the human personality, had a 
marked influence on productions at the 
Berezil Theatre in Kharkov, where Kurbas 
did most of his work. In many of his produc- 
tions, images inspired by Skovoroda were 
used to symbolize the unending search for 
spiritual truth. 
Kurbas, like Vakhtangov, was an artist of 
the Revolution. He regarded the theatre as 
a model of society and a forum for the dis- 
cussion of public questions. His vision of a 
theatre of “transfiguration”, in which the 
world could be, as it were, re-created, was 
profound and idealistic. A firm believer in 
the ethical power of art and the insight it 
provides, he thought it was possible to 
change society through the artistic and 
moral life of the theatre. 
Butitisunorthodox ideas of this kind that 
leave their mark on history, especially when 
they are put forward by someone who is 
completely disinterested. Thanks to Kur- 
bas, something of Craig’s dream about a 
school to study the art of the theatre was 
realized. He established the Berezil Artists’ 
Society comprising an extensive network of 
theatrical workshops, the prototype of the 
new Soviet Ukrainian theatre—which pro- 
duced shows ranging from drama and opera 
to variety, circus, reviews and musicals—as 
well of the many theatre research institutes. 
The political plays produced by Kurbas at 
the Berezil Theatre between 1922 and 1926 
included Keiser’s Gas, Shevchenko’s Haid- 
amaks (“Ukrainian Soldiers”), Sinclair’s 
Jimmy Higgins and Shakespeare’s Mac- 
beth. These performances were vivid, 
striking studies of extreme psychological 
and social experiences, very avant-garde 
compared with other contemporary 
productions. 
Much can be learned from Kurbas’ con- 
ception of the theatre. What was true in his 
time is true today. The Polish experimental 
theatre director Jerzy. Grotowski’s search 
for the “sacral life of the human spirit”, the 
British director Peter Brook’s vision of a 
new kind of culture, the subtle combination 
of irony, farce and insight found in the films 
of the Italian director Federico Fellini, the 
tragic symbolism of the Swedish director 
Ingmar Bergman—all these recall the 
Soviet experiments and, in particular, Kur- 
bas’ theatre of “transfiguration”. The mys- 
terious nature of his productions gives a 
feeling of timelessness to his conception of 
humanity. Their interplay of the serious and 
the farcical, the eternal and the mortal, the 
lofty and the base, is reminiscent of baroque 
art; everyday life is interpreted by reference 
to the fantastic.” Kurbas’ aesthetic ideas 
brought to theatre a new and dynamic form 
of realism based on fantasy, with an infinite 
capacity to reveal the complexities of the 
world and the absurdities of daily life. ®

In the May 1987 issue of the Unesco Courier reference was made 
to a proposal by the Greek poet and politician Yannis 
Coutsocheras, that the basic food products necessary to humanity 
" should not be subject to market forces. In view of the importance 
of the question, we publish the following text by Mr. Coutsocheras. 


### 76549: Food for all: the 'Paris Appeal'

Food for all — 
The ‘Paris Appeal’ 
by Yannis Coutsocheras 
also an age of paradox. The mounting 
wave of individuals and peoples driven 
to despair by famine is reaching alarming pro- 
portions. 
The brunt of this unacceptable state of 
affairs is borne primarily by the children of 
developing countries, where 15 million people 
starve to death every year and 50 million more 
are undernourished and suffer from the 
serious physical and psychological con- 
sequences of malnutrition, such as inability to 
attend school or to work. 
Dire poverty is the rule in the population 
groups and peoples devastated by famine. 
T wow so-called age of affluence is 
Meanwhile quantities of foodstuffs that the. 
market cannot absorb are being destroyed. 
The scientific advances that would make it 
possible to produce enough food to feed a 
population much larger than that of the world 
today are not being applied for fear of adrop in 
prices. Moreover, astronomical sums are 
being wasted on the arms race in order to 
prepare for a war which will never take place, 
since it is acknowledged that total war would 
mean universal suicide. Such poverty is 
a source of ever-growing despair, where 
bitterness breeds hatred, revolt, violence 
and war. 
Free accessto staple foods in order to guar- 
antee the right to life is a fundamental require- 
ment. The conception of human rights which 
has evolved over the years to include the right 
to health, the right to education and the right to 
work, seems to be lagging behind with respect 
to the basic right to life. 
In 1975, as a member of the Parliamentary 
Assembly of the Council of Europe, I pre- 
sented a proposal calling for universal free 
access to basic foodstuffs; subsequently, so 
that this ideal might be achieved by degrees, | 
restricted my proposal to children, wording it 
as follows: “In order to safeguard the lives of 
all children, certain basic food products 
should not be subject to market forces, and 
each child should be entitled to a free 
ration.” 
This proposal has been adopted by various 
organizations—the Council of Europe (1980), 
the Greek Parliament (1984), Unesco (1985), 
the International Association of Democratic 
Lawyers (1986) and by many distinguished 
figures. It meets with approval and support 
wherever it is put forward, since it is consid- 
ered to be effective and capable of implemen- 
tation without delay. 
The onus is on intellectuals to take the first 
step and, unswayed by religion, culture, 
 
Threshing grain in Lebanon 
nationality, political convictions, race or 
colour, to rise up against injustice and make a 
joint effort to bring this shameful situation to an 
end; so that we may never again read such 
headlines as “Rampant famine” or “Rising 
world toll of famine and malnutrition”, and 
never again be told that hunger now afflicts 
730 million people. 
With this end in view, a group of dis- 
tinguished persons from various countries 
has recently set up a Provisional Committee in 
Paris to make preparations for 16 October 
1987, World Food Day, when a meeting will be 
held at Unesco Headquarters to launch the 
“Paris Appeal” for the early withdrawal of sta- 
ple foods, in particular children’s foods, from 
the arena of market forces. The appeal will go 
out to all governments and will he taken up by 
news agencies and the media to bring the 
campaign to the attention of the world. Subse- 
quently, political will must come to the fore, 
since without it nothing can be done. =
