The United Nations General 
Assembly designated 1971 as 
International Year for Action to 
~ Combat Racism and Racial 
Discrimination, to be observed 
in the name of the ever 
growing struggle against so- 
cial discrimination in all its : 
forms and in the name of 
international solidarity with 
those combatting racism. It 
called on all States to co- 
operate in every possible way 
in implementing this interna- 
tional campaign and to in- 
 tensify and expand their ef- 
forts, at the national and inter- 
national levels, towards ensur- 
ing the rapid and total eradica- 
tion of racial discrimination, 
including the policy of apart- 
heid, nazism and all of its 
contemporary forms, as well 
as other manifestations of 
~ racism. U.N. Secretary-General 
U Thant has expressed the hope 
~ that the International Year 
Against Racism will bring “a 
~ general recognition that the 
theories, ideas and prejudices 
which lead to racism and racial 
discrimination are unjust and 
“abhorrent, and that a great 
responsibility rests upon all 
to eradicate the shameful prac- 
tices which they encourage.”   Ph

### 54302: Race and I.Q.

RACE 
AND 1.Q. 
Sou 20 years ago there 
was good reason to believe that the 
notion of a genetic or inborn racial 
hierarchy had practically disappeared 
from the thinking of social and bio- 
logical scientists concerned with this 
issue. The general position could per- 
haps best be stated in negative terms, 
namely that there was no acceptable 
scientific evidence in favour of such a 
hierarchy, and that consequently any 
political or educational programme 
based on the alleged innate inferiority 
of any racial or ethnic group had no 
scientific validity. 
Some years earlier (1944) Gunnar 
Myrdal and his associates in An 
American Dilemma had called for an 
educational offensive to reduce the 
gap between this position of the social 
scientists on the one hand, and that of 
the general public on the other. In 
the years that followed, it began to 
appear that at least in the United 
States a real change in this respect 
had occurred in the general public. 
When a representative sample of 
white Americans were asked the ques- 
tion: “In general, do you think that 
  
OTTO KLINEBERG, of Canada, is one of the 
world's leading psychologists and authorities 
on race relaticns. He is at present visiting 
professor at the Ecole Pratique des Hautes 
Etudes at the Sorbonne and director of the 
International Centre for Intergroup Relations, 
in Paris. Among his long hist of publications 
are: “Race Differences™ (1935), “Negro Intel- 
ligence and Selective Migration” (1935), 
“Tensions Affecting International Under- 
standing: A Survey of Research” (1950), and 
“The Human Dimension in International Rela- 
tions” (1964). His study, “Race and Psycho- 
logy", first published in 1951, also appeared 
in Unesco's “The Race Question in Modern 
Science” in 1956. A revised edition of this 
book is scheduled to be published next year. 
We are happy to publish here passages from 
a new chapter [n this forthcoming new edition. 
  
by Otto Klineberg 
Negroes are as intelligent as white 
people—that is, can they learn things 
just as well if they are given the same 
education and training"—the propor- 
tion answering in the affirmative rose 
from 50 per cent in 1942 to almost 80 
per cent in 1964 (Hyman & Sheatsley). 
It looked as if this particular issue 
was dead, or at least dying. Myrdal 
went so far as to say in a Nobel 
Symposium published in 1970: “The 
racial inferiority doctrine has dis- 
appeared, which is an undivided 
advance, since it has no scientific 
basis.” 
This “disappearance” is far from 
complete, however, and the question of 
innate psychological differences con- 
tinues to attract considerable attention, 
not only in the United States but else- 
where as well, and not only in the 
general public but also among scholars. 
In 1962, Carleton S. Coon present- 
ed the theory that human evolution 
had occurred more rapidly in Europe 
than in Africa, and that as a con- 
sequence modern man emerged in 
Europe earlier. With some caution, he 
added that though dead men cannot 
take intelligence tests, it may be infer- 
red that “the subspecies which first 
crossed the evolutionary threshold 
into the category of homo sapiens 
have evolved the most... and the levels 
of civilization attained by some of its 
populations may be related pheno- 
mena”. 
In a comment on this theory, Weyl 
and Possony (1963) conclude that 
“differences in structure, physique and 
mentality among the racial divisions of 
mankind can be derived”. The context 
makes it clear that the innate infer- 
jority of the African is indicated by 
his evolution at a later date. 
One is struck by the versatility of

### 54302: Race and I.Q.

RACE AND 1. Q. (Continued) 
Inactivating the ‘Jensen bombshell’ 
those who insist that there must be 
innate psychological differences bet- 
ween racial groups. In many of the 
earlier writings of the origin of races, 
for example, and also in some mu- 
seums of natural history, one may find 
an evolutionary genealogical tree, in 
which whites are presented as having 
evolved most recently. There the 
inference was that Africans were 
more primitive and therefore inferior. 
In other words, if the African evolved 
earlier he is more primitive; if later, 
he is inferior because he has had less 
time in which to develop. 
A second example of this versatility 
is found in the interpretation of certain 
test results. In 1931, Myrtle McGraw 
applied the Buhler Babytests to black 
and white infants in the south of the 
U.S.A. and found the latter to be su- 
perior. This was interpreted (by others) 
as proving that even before culture had 
the opportunity to exercise its in- 
fluence, inborn group differences could 
still be demonstrated. (McGraw her- 
self in a letter to the American Psy- 
chologist repudiated this interpretation 
of her results.) 
More recently, Géber and her asso- 
ciates (Géber & Dean, 1957) used the 
tests of the Gesell Institute, in New 
Haven, U.S.A. on infants in Uganda, 
and found them to be definitely in ad- 
vance of the norms established in New 
Haven. Weyl and Possony (1963) com- 
ment: “A superficial conclusion from 
this might be the mental superiority 
at birth of Negro children. Actually, 
the reverse is indicated.” 
Obviously, early rapid development 
signifies an inferior brain, more like 
that of an animal which quickly rea- 
ches full maturity. Again, if black in- 
fants do poorly on tests, they must be 
inferior; if they do well, this indicates 
that they will be inferior later. 
By far the most striking recent dev- 
elopment in this field—striking because 
of its identification with a reputable 
psychologist at a great university (Uni- 
versity of California at Berkeley) and 
also because of the intense public 
reaction with which it was received— 
is represented by the publication in 
1969 of a monograph by A.R. Jensen 
in the Harvard Educational Review. 
In answer to his own question, "How 
far can we boost IQ and scholastic 
achievement?” Jensen developed the 
thesis that genetic factors “may play a 
part” in intelligence differences be- 
tween black and white children. 
The Harvard Educational Review de- 
voted three whole issues to the views 
of Jensen and of his critics, the latter 
ranging all the way from temperate dis- 
cussion of his genetic assumptions to 
vituperative attacks on his “racist” and 
reactionary viewpoint. 
The popular press, throughout the 
United States and a number of other 
countries, seized upon Jensen's thesis 
with enthusiasm, and gave it a truly 
remarkable amount of publicity. It 
seems highly probable that opposition 
to the notion of innate psychological 
differences between blacks and whites 
is not very firmly rooted in the popular 
mind. 
Another move in a direction similar 
to that of Jensen has been made by 
William Shockley, Nobel! Prize-winning 
physicist at Stanford University, also 
in California, who urged the National 
(U.S.) Academy of Sciences to conduct 
extensive research into the problem of 
genetic (including racial} intelligence. 
Basing his argument in part on the re- 
sults obtained by blacks and whites on 
intelligence tests, Shockley insists that 
the failure to study the nature of the 
genetic potential of the blacks repre- 
sents a profound degree of moral irres- 
ponsibility. 
The issue of racial differences in 
innate intellectual capacities may not, 
therefore, be regarded as entirely re- 
solved. In a series of statements 
issued by experts convened by Unesco, 
the position taken is that there is no 
adequate scientific evidence, based 
either on tests or on other varieties 
of data, which justifies the conclusion 
that such differences exist. 
To take only the most recent of 
these, dated September 1967, the con- 
clusion is reached that: “The peoples 
of the world appear to possess equal 
biological potentialities for attaining 
any level of civilization”, and further 
that: “Racism falsely claims that there 
is a scientific basis for arranging 
groups hierarchically in terms of psy- 
chological and cultural characteristics 
that are immutable and innate.” 
In what follows the attempt will be 
made to present and assess the varie- 
ties of evidence related to this thesis, 
with particular reference to the results 
obtained through the application of 
psychological tests. 
Article [I of the Universal Declara- 
tion of Human Rights affirms: 
Everyone is entitled to all the 
rights and freedoms set forth in 
this Declaration, without distinc- 
tion of any kind, such as race, 
colour, sex, language, religion, 
political or other opinion, national 
or social origin, property, birth or 
other status. 
One of the obstacles to the realiza- 
tion of this part of the Declaration is 
the belief, widely and stubbornly held, 
that some races and peoples are in- 
ferior, and that they therefore do not 
have the same “rights” as others. 
As already noted, scholars and 
scientists have in some cases attempt- 
ed to support the argument in favour 
of a racial hierarchy. It is curious, 
although perhaps understandable, that 
those scientists who have expressed

themselves in this manner, have usually 
arrived at the conclusion that their own 
people are superior to all others. 
Some of the German scholars, for 
example, were convinced that the peo- 
ple of Northern Europe excelled the 
rest of mankind in intellectual endow- 
ment as well as in character and mora- 
lity. An Italian anthropologist was 
equally certain that the peoples of the 
Mediterranean were responsible for 
most of the great contributions to our 
civilization. For some black scholars, 
everything good in contemporary civi- 
lization has come out of Africa. 
These rival claims do not help us 
to arrive at the truth concerning the 
relation of race to psychology. We 
need a more objective method, a more 
certain technique; one that is not so 
dependent on purely subjective judg- 
ments as to who has superior intellec- 
tual endowment, or what is a greater

A report of the U.N. Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities, of 
the Commission on Human Rights, is devoted to racial discrimination in South Africa and other territories 
in southern Africa. 
“black prisoners are subject to discriminatory treatment. 
According to witnesses there is a severe lack of medical services and there are instances where small. 
In territories under Portuguese administration, it writes, evidence shows that

contribution to civilization. We need 
proof that is scientifically sound; evi- 
dence that is scientifically acceptable, 
Psychologists have developed a 
method which, with all its faults, 
appears at first glance to have consi- 
derable advantages for this purpose— 
the psychological test. Instead of hav- 
ing to decide whether a German 
scientific discovery represents a high- 
er intellectual achievement than an 
Italian painting, the test permits us to 
present to a group of Germans and 
Italians a series of problems to solve, 
and we can then determine who solves 
them more quickly and more effec- 
tively. 
If someone else doubts our results 
he may repeat the study, using the 
same or other subjects, and the same 
or other tests. If his results agree 
with ours, our confidence in them is 
increased; if not, we must suspend 
judgment until other investigations help 
to determine who is right. 
This is all that would be necessary 
to settle the question of superior and 
inferior races if psychological tests 
were perfect instruments for the 
measurement of native or innate 
differences in ability. It is true that 
they were accepted as such for 
a long time, at least by some psy- 
chologists and educators, as well as 
by many laymen. We now know, 
however, that they are far from perfect. 
The successful solution of the prob- 
lems presented by the tests depends 
on many factors—the previous experi- 
ence and education of the person 
tested, his degree of familiarity with 
the subject matter of the test, his 
motivation or desire to obtain a good 
score, his emotional state, his rapport 
with the experimenter, his knowledge 
of the language in which the test is 
administered and also his physical 
health and well-being, as well as on 
the native capacity of the person test- 
ed. 
It is only when such factors are 
“held constant”, that is to say, when 
they are in essential respects similar 
for all subjects tested, that we have 
the right to conclude that those who 
obtain higher scores on the test are 
innately superior to those whose 
scores are lower. 
This makes it immediately obvious 
that we must use great caution in 
interpreting the results when a psycho- 
logical test is administered to two 
different racial or national groups. 
Living under different conditions, dis- 
similar in culture, education and point 
of view, such groups may differ widely 
in the test results not because they 
have an unequal heredity but because 
of their unequal social environment.

RACE AND I. Q. (Continued) 
 
Unjustified conclusions from intelligence tests 
The great French psychologist 
Alfred Binet, who was responsible for 
developing the first scale of intelli- 
gence tests in 1905, was aware of this 
limitation in the application of his 
method. He pointed out that his tests 
could safely be used in order to arrive 
at inborn differences only if the 
various individuals or groups tested 
had had substantially the same oppor- 
tunities. Many psychologists neglect- 
ed or forgot Binet's wise counsel, and 
drew unjustified conclusions from their 
data. 
In view of the many ways in which 
culture and previous experience may 
affect test scores, it is not surprising 
to find that the British psychologist 
Philip E. Vernon, who has had long 
experience in research and teaching in 
this field, concludes: “There is no such 
thing as a culture-fair test, and never 
can be" (1968). 
Attitudes toward 
the test 
One of the major arguments against 
the notion of a “culture-fair™ or “cul- 
ture-free” test is the fact that groups, 
and even individuals, vary greatly in 
their attitude toward the test. The 
very act of competing against others 
in a test situation is itself influenced 
by the values and attitudes develop- 
ed in a particular society. 
+ Professor S.D. Porteus in The Psy- 
chology of a Primitive People (1931) 
tells of an interesting experience in 
administering psychological tests to a 
group of Australian aborigines. The 
tests were made up of a series of 
mazes, the problem consisting of trac- 
ing a pathway through the maze until 
the exit was successfully reached. 
Each subject was expected to per- 
form the task by himself. This situa- 
tion turned out to be a strange one for 
these Australian natives. They are 
accustomed to solving their problems 
together, in groups. “Not only is every 
problem in tribal life debated and set- 
tled by the. council of elders but it is 
always discussed until a unanimous 
decision is reached.” 
The subjects were frequently puzzled 
by the fact that the examiner would 
give them no assistance when they 
experienced some difficulty in solving 
the problem of the maze. This was 
particularly true in the case of one 
group of natives who had recently 
made the psychologist a “blood bro- 
ther” of their own tribe, and they could 
not understand why he refused to help 
them. 
A similar indifference to the kind of 
competition taken for granted in Wes- 
tern society was noted by the present 
writer in an investigation undertaken 
among the Yakima, a tribe of American 
Indians living in the state of Washing- 
ton on the U.S. west coast. 
The tests used were a group of 
performance tests, in which no know- 
ledge of language is necessary, and 
the task consists of placing pieces of 
wood of various shape into the appro- 
priate areas of a wooden frame “as 
quickly as possible”. The scores ob- 
tained depend on the speed with which 
the task is completed and the num- 
ber of errors made in the process. 
These Indian children, however, 
never hurried. They saw no reason to 
work quickly. Western culture places 
a premium on speed, on getting things 
done in as short a time as possible; 
the Indian children had not acquired 
this attitude. They went at their task 
slowly and deliberately, with none of 
that scrambling impatience that is so 
often found among American children. 
The Indians, as a consequence, took 
much longer to finish the tests, though 
they made somewhat fewer errors than 
the white Americans with whom they 
were compared, 
The writer made an analogous 
observation among the Dakota (Sioux) 
Indians in the state of South Dakota. 
There it is regarded as incorrect to 
answer a question in the presence of 
others who do not know the answer: 
this might be interpreted as showing 
off, or as bringing shame to’ others, 
and Is consequently condemned by the 
whole group. 
These Indian children also have de- 
veloped the conviction that it is wrong 
to reply to a question unless one is 
absolutely certain of the answer. Psy- 
chologists who have given the Binet 
test to these children have observed 
that they never guess at the answer: 
if they are not sure, they keep quiet 
indefinitely. This, too, reduces their 
scores to a certain extent, since a 
guess may succeed, and since credit is 
given for an answer that is even partly 
correct. 
As a final example in this context 
may be noted the experience of the 
anthropologist Margaret Mead with 
Samoan children, and reported in her 
Coming-of-Age in Samoa. She was 
administering the Binet test, which has 
as one of its items the Ball-and-Field 
problem. A ball is lost in a circular 
field, and the task of the subject is to 
trace a pathway along which he would 
walk in order to find the ball. 
These Samoan children, instead of 
tracing the most efficient pathway, 
used the occasion to make a pretty 
design. Their aesthetic interest was 
evidently stronger than their desire to 
solve the problem. 
These examples all indicate the pos- 
sibility that the cultural background of 
the individual may determine his gen- 
eral approach to the test situation in 
such a manner as markedly to influ- 
ence his test score. 
Even in the case of minority groups 
within the same society, such as 
American blacks, evidence indicates 
that their attitude toward the test, their 
motivation to do their best, may not be 
similar to what is found in the white 
children with whom they are compared. 
They are often suspicious of the test 
and what it means, and they lack con- 
fidence in their ability to do well. 
Attitudes toward the 
children tested 
Expectations regarding performance 
may be important not only for those 
who are tested, but also for those who 
do the testing—and teaching. Clark 
* (1963) has presented the view that 
culturally disadvantaged (one might 
add also culturally different) children 
are the unfortunate victims of teachers’ 
educational self-fulfilling prophecies; 
in other words, if children are expect- 
ed to do poorly, they will do poorly. 
This hypothesis was tested experi- 
mentally by Rosenthal and Jacobson 
and published in Pygmalion in the 
Classroom (1968); they gave to tea- 
chers the names of children who alle- 
gedly had done well on a “test for 
intellectual blooming” which indicated 
that they would show striking gains in 
intellectual competence during the next 
eight months of school. 
Eight months later this experimen- 
tal group, together with a control group 
of equal competence whose names 
had not been given to the teachers, 
were re-tested on the same intelligence 
test. 
The experimental group—those 
whom the teachers expected to do 
well—gained 4 more points in 1.Q. 
than did the control group; on a 
reasoning test, the difference was 
7 points. As the authors point out, 
the difference between the two groups 
was in the mind of the teachers. This 
finding appears to be of very real im- 
portance in the comparisons that have 
been made, and continue to be made, 
between ethnic groups. 
The effect of language 
One of the clearest and most ob- 
vious ways in which social and edu- 
cational background may influence test 
results, is through its effect on lan- 
guage. Most of the psychological tests 
in general use, including those devis- 
ed by Binet, are verbal in character. 
For the successful solution of the 
problems presented, not only must the 
subject have an adequate compre- 
hension of the questions asked; not 
only must he be able to answer intel- 
ligibly once the solution has been 
reached; he must also be able to mani- 
pulate words successfully in order to 
reach a solution. 
So important Is language facility in 
many of these tests that psychologists

can often reach quite an accurate 
estimate of a subject's mental level 
merely by knowing the extent of his 
vocabulary. This early led to the con- 
clusion that these intelligence tests 
were unfair to the foreign-born, or to 
others (like the American Indians in 
the United States, for example) who 
had inadequate knowledge of the lan- 
guage in which the test was adminis- 
tered. Even if they spoke and used 
that language with relative ease, they 
were still handicapped if that were 
not their native language, or if they 
were bilingual. 
This was demonstrated years ago. 
‘Welsh children speaking only English 
obtained better scores on the Binet 
scale than those who spoke both 
Welsh and English. In Belgium, the 
Walloon children who spoke only 
French, were superior to Flemish chil- 
dren speaking both French and Fle- 
mish. 
This should not to be interpreted to 
mean that bilingualism causes a defi- 
nite or permanent intellectual inferio- 
rity; it more probably is due to the 
simple fact that the vocabulary of a 
young child is so limited that if he 
learns words in two languages, he will 
not know so many in either one. With 
the passage of time, the handicap due 
to bilingualism will be more than com- 
pensated by its undoubted advantages. 
The effect of poverty 
The influence of poverty or of 
socio-economic class on test perfor- 
mance cannot be kept separate from 
the issues already raised. Low expect- 
ations as to pupil performance may 
affect the poor white as well as black; 
differences in language patterns have 
been demonstrated in the case of the 
poor in England (by Bernstein, 1960) 
and in the United States (John, 1963). 
The fact of poverty and its conse- 
quences acquires importance in this 
context because of the proportionately 
greater frequency of poverty among 
minority groups, and particularly 
among the blacks in the United States. 
This consideration alone should im- 
pose considerable caution in arguing 
from the inferior test results obtained 
by black children (an average I.Q. of 
85 as compared with the “normal” 
100). Research conducted in many 
countries and by many psychologists 
indicates beyond a shadow of a doubt 
that the test performance of poor white 
children is markedly inferior to that of 
the well-to-do; the difference between 
groups at the extremes of the econo- 
mic range is in the neighbourhood of 
20 points in 1.Q., that is to say, greater 
than that between American blacks 
and whites. 
To this it is retorted that even when 
the comparison is between blacks and 
whites of the same economic level the 
difference, though smaller, still per- 
sists. All that this really means, how- 
ever, is that poverty, although of great 
importance, is not the only factor res- 
ponsible. 
In a critical review of the research 
on ethnic differences in the United 
States, Dreger & Miller (1960) correct- 
ly point out that it is not enough to 
equate ethnic groups in terms of social 
class and economic variables; the dif- 
ference is not solely socio-economic. 
They add that even those blacks 
whose economic status is higher than 
that of most white persons will still in 
the majority of cases be prevented 
from living the same kind of life in all 
respects; many other factors may also 
be important. 
To return to the effect of poverty, 
psychologists have so far not suffi- 
ciently emphasized its role in causing 
fundamental impairment to mental de- 
velopment as a consequence of malnu- 
trition. 
In a survey of the relation between 
nutrition and learning, Eichenwald and 
Fry (1969) bring together an impres- 
sive mass of data in this connexion, 
based partly on animal experimentation 
and partly on observations of the 
effects of nutritional deficiencies on 
human beings in many parts of the 
world, including Africa and Latin 
America. 
They conclude that malnutrition dur- 
ing a critical period of early life may 
“permanently and profoundly affect 
the future intellectual and emotional 
development of the individual”, The 
factor of malnutrition appears to be of 
fundamental importance in assessing 
the intellectual potentialities of poor, 
including poor black, people. 
The effect of previous 
learning and experience 
In the early days of testing, 
many psychologists believed that the 
elimination of the handicap due to 
language was equivalent to eliminating 
the influence of culture and experience 
in general, One psychologist, Profes- 
sor Florence L. Goodenough of the 
University of Minnesota, devised a per- 
formance test consisting in “Drawing a 
Man”; scores were determined not by 
the aesthetic quality of the drawing, 
but by the inclusion of the largest pos- 
sible number of essential aspects, by 
proper attention to bodily proportions. 
She regarded this test as “culture- 
free” that is, independent of the pre- 
vious background and experience of 
the subjects, and therefore capable of 
measuring native differences in intelli- 
gence. In 1926, she conducted a study 
by means of this test, and reported 
definite differences in the “intelli- 
gence” of various immigrant groups in 
the United States, as well as between 
whites and Negroes. 
Since then, many investigators have 
made use of this test, and they have 
been able to demonstrate that, contra- 
ry to the earlier view, the results are 
indeed affected by many aspects of 
previous experience. Professor Good- 
enough herself later recognized this 
fact, and very honestly and courage- 
ously pointed out her former error. 
Writing with Dale B. Harris on “Stu- 
dies in the psychology of children's 
drawings” in the Psychological Bulle- 
tin (Sept. 1950) she expresses the 
opinion that the search for a culture- 
free test, whether of intelligence, ar- 
tistic ability, personal-social characte- 
ristics, or any other measurable trait 
is illusory, and ... the naive assumption 
that the mere freedom from verbal 
requirements renders a test equally 
suitable for all groups is no longer 
tenable. 
More recent evidence along the 
same lines comes from a study by 
Wayne Dennis (1966) who gave the 
Draw-a-Man test to samples of chil- 
dren in approximately fifty different 
cultures. Averages ranged from an 
LQ. of 124 for children in American 
and English suburbs, in a lapanese 
fishing village, and among the Hopi 
Indians. The lowest average, 52, was 
found in children of a nomadic Bed- 
ouin tribe in Syria; this is explained 
by their limited experience in graphic 
art. Children of Lebanese Arabs, on 
the other hand, with considerable 
exposure to Western culture obtained 
an average 1.Q. of 94. 
Qualitative differences 
in test performance 
Factors related to cultural back- 
ground and previous experience may 
also determine qualitative differ- 
ences in the nature of test perfor- 
mance. Strauss (1954), for example, 
found that university students in Cey- 
lon obtained better scores than Ame- 
ricans on verbal tests, but were mark- 
edly inferior on non-verbal or perfor- 
mance tests. He suggests that their 
culture “has the effect of defining a 
set of role behaviours that on the one 
hand tends to deprecate manuai and 
technical ability, and on the other tends 
to emphasize and reward the verbal 
type of scholarly excellence”. 
A" number of other investigators 
have been concerned with qualitative 
differences in test scores obtained by 
various ethnic groups. Vernon (1969), 
found an entirely different pattern of 
abilities in the case of Jamaican and 
Eskimo boys, respectively; the former 
were better in Arithmetic and Word- 
learning, the latter in tests dependent 
on Induction and on Drawing. 
Lesser et al (1965) also found qua- 
litative (as well as quantitative) dif- 
ferences in the abilities of young Chi- 
nese, Jewish, Negro and Puerto Rican 
children in the United States; Iscoe 
and Pierce Jones (1964) showed that 
although Negro children were inferior 
to whites in general test scores, -they 
were superior in measures of what the 
authors call “divergent thinking”, bas- 
ed on the ability to suggest a number 
of different uses for familiar objects. 
Clearly differences in the measured 
capacity of ethnic groups may be a 
function of the particular test applied.

WHAT 
PRICE 
. Q. TESTS? 
Drawing on the results of psycho- 
logical tests given to children of varied 
origins, certain psychologists, even 
recently, have argued in favour of 
the notion of a genetic or inborn 
racial hierarchy. Many other experi- 
ments, however, have shown over- 
whelmingly that the theory has no 
scientific validity. Groups of dist- 
inguished scientists convened by 
Unesco have issued a series of 
statements on race. The most recent 
of these affirmed, in 1967, that 
“Racism falsely claims that there is 
a scientific basis for arranging groups 
hierarchically in terms of psychologi- 
cal and cultural characteristics that 
are immutable and innate”. As Instru- 
ments for measuring and comparing 
innate differences in ability among 
different ethnic groups, intelligence 
tests are far from perfect. Previous 
experience and education, living 
conditions, background and emotional 
factors can influence the results. 
Thus, faced with one test or another 
designed to measure the Intelligence 
Quotient (above, a test in which 
various shaped blocks are used to 
form a specific design In a given 
time) the reaction of this woman from 
northeastern Siberia (left) or that of 
the Brazilian Indian, who seems to 
be playing at “cat's cradle” (top right) 
may differ completely from those of 
a European or an African. Research 
shows that as environmental opportu- 
nities of different groups become 
more alike, as in the case of the 
black and white children in the class- 
room, right, differences in test results 
also tend to disappear.

RACE AND 1. Q. (Continued from page 9) 
Objections to Jensen-—continued 
If every test is “culture-bound” that 
is to say, affected by the whole com- 
plex of previous education, training 
and experience, can the use of tests 
give us any information at all about 
racial differences, or similarities, in 
intelligence? If we cannot disentangle 
hereditary from environmental influen- 
ces in the results, has the testing me- 
thod any relevance at all to our 
problem? 
We can of course legitimately say 
that racial differences in intelligence 
cannot be demonstrated by means of 
the tests, for the reasons given; we 
can at least say: “Not proven!” Is 
that all we can say? Or is there some 
more positive manner in which the 
tests may be used to answer the ques- 
tions we are raising? 
Lo us look at the problem 
a little differently. It is true that the 
test scores obtained by two different 
groups are due to the interaction of 
hereditary and environmental factors 
which cannot be disentangled. The 
inferiority of one of these groups to 
the other may then be due to an 
inferior heredity, or to a poorer 
environment, or both. 
Suppose now we make the two en- 
. vironments more similar; equalize them 
as far as possible. If as the environ- 
ments become more alike, the differ- 
ence in test scores tends to disap- 
pear; if when the environments are to 
all practical purposes equalized, the 
difference in test scores disappears 
completely; we then have a strong arg- 
ument in favour of the environmental 
rather than the hereditary explana- 
tion of the observed differences. What 
do the results show? 
If a test which has been found to be 
useful in establishing differences 
among children in Paris or New York 
is administered to children in Mozam- 
bique or New Guinea, we could hardly 
expect the latter groups to do as well 
as the former, That should be obvious, 
though unfortunately it has not always 
been recognized. 
There are, however, a number of 
countries in which groups of different 
ethnic or racial origin live side by side, 
and it would seem a simple matter to 
use such groups as a basis for com- 
parison. 
If in the United States, for example, 
we find Americans of Scandinavian, 
Italian, Chinese, Negro and American 
Indian origin, all living in an “Ameri- 
can” environment, can we not assume 
that they all have the same cultural 
background, the same educational and 
economic opportunities so that any 
differences in test results could with 
scientific safety be attributed to differ- 
ences in hereditary capacity? 
Unfortunately, this is not so. The 
American Indian, for example, usually 
lives on reservations separate from the 
surrounding community; he usually 
goes to different schools; he lives a 
different life; he speaks English, but 
frequently not too well; his economic 
status is on the avérage inferior, 
The Negro, although his position in 
American life has improved markedly 
in recent years, is still in most cases 
subject to very definite handicaps; his 
economic status is also on the average 
very much below that of the whites; 
the schools which he attends have 
certainly been inferior in the past, and 
to a certain extent are still inferior 
to-day; he finds it more difficult to 
obtain certain types of employment, 
or to participate fully in American life. 
Once that is understood, it should 
not be surprising to find that American 
Indians and Negroes, adults as well as 
children, do on the average obtain test 
scores inferior to those of whites. But, 
it must be noted, this is a difference on 
the average. There are many indivi- 
dual Negroes who obtain scores high- 
er than those of a great many indi- 
vidual whites. What is more impor- 
tant, there are sometimes whole groups 
of Negroes who do better on the tests 
than groups of whites with whom they 
have been compared. 
This 
widespread interest during the First 
World War, when over a million re- 
cruits in the American Army, including 
many Negroes, were given psycho- 
logical tests. The results showed that 
Negroes from the south (where educa- 
tional and economic handicaps were 
greater) obtained scores which on the 
average were definitely inferior to 
those of Negroes from the north 
(where such handicaps, though they 
existed, were much less severe). 
Even more strikingly, the Negroes 
from some of the northern states turn- 
ed out to be superior to the whites 
from some of the southern states. This 
was true in the case of both types of 
intelligence tests used, one depend- 
ing on language, the other a perfor- 
mance or non-language test. 
It began to appear, at least to some 
psychologists, as if the colour of the 
skin were less important in determining 
success with the tests, than the oppor- 
tunities given to the individual to ac- 
quire the needed abilities. 
As an indication of the wide differ- 
ences in test scores, within the same 
racial group, which accompany diffe- 
rences in the environment, one finds 
at one extreme, a group of Negro chil- 
dren in rural Tennessee obtaining an 
average Intelligence Quotient of 58, 
and at the other extreme, Negro chil- 
dren in Los Angeles, California, with 
an average Intelligence Quotient of 
105. 
For the white population as a whole, 
important fact first aroused 
an 1.Q. of 100 is to be expected; that 
is by definition the standard or norm 
with which these results are to be 
compared. In the inferior environment 
of rural Tennessee, the Negro score 
goes far below this standard; in the 
more favourable environment of a big 
city like Los Angeles, the Negro score 
reaches and even exceeds by a small 
amount the “normal” Intelligence Quo- 
tient. This is an important result and 
its implications for so-called racial dif- 
ferences in innate capacity appear to 
be obvious. 
Another ethnic group which has 
been studied in considerable detail, 
and with a large variety of tests, is the 
American Indian. In general, their test 
scores are the lowest of all groups 
examined in the United States; their 
average Intelligence Quotient is in the 
neighbourhood of 81, instead of the 
“normal” 100. This result is not at 
all surprising, in the light of the “cultu- 
ral” factors discussed above. 
The late Professor T. BR. Garth of the 
University of Denver, Colorado, tried 
to discover what would happen if 
American Indian children were given the 
opportunity to live in a social environ- 
ment similar to that of other American 
children. He made a study of Indian 
children who had been placed in white 
foster homes, cared for by white fos- 
ter parents. These Indian foster child- 
ren obtained an average Intelligence 
Quotient of 102. 
M ORE recently evidence has 
accumulated to indicate that training 
may markedly raise the level of perfor- 
mance. McFie (1961) was able to 
produce a substantial improvement in 
the test scores of his African subjects 
as a result of education which placed 
emphasis on drawing and construction; 
there was a significant increase in 
both speed and accuracy of per- 
formance. 
Lloyd and Pidgeon (1961) also report 
that in testing school children in Natal, 
they were able to produce a marked 
rise in the test scores of African 
children after two short sessions of 
coaching. The authors warn against 
any assumptions about the innate 
abilities of children from different 
cultures on the basis of these tests. 
A significant review by Hunt (1971) 
of a number of educational pro- 
grammes, directed not only to the 
children of the poor but also to the 
mothers of such children, has shown 
how much can be done to improve 
performance. He writes: “These 
findings of substantial gains in the 
1.Q.s. of children of mothers so 
taught... provides a substantial hope 
of developing a method of preventing 
the development of incompetence in 
children of poverty...” Hunt adds that

## [Page 13](078447engo.pdf#page=13) 0

### 54302: Race and I.Q.

this perspective is applicable to both 
the black and the white poor. 
With these findings in mind, it is 
difficult to understand why Jensen 
answers his own question, “How much 
can we boost 1.Q. and scholastic 
achievement?”, with the conclusion 
that the gains are small. Many of his 
critics have pointed out that gains have 
indeed been obtained, and that they 
would be much more substantial if the 
relevant programmes were maintained 
over a sufficiently long period, and 
affected a wider range of the child's 
experience. 
A statement by the Council of the 
Society for the Psychological Study of 
Social Issues, a division of the 
American Psychological Association, 
includes these words: 
“One of our most serious 
objections to Jensen's article is 
to his vigorous assertion that 
compensatory education has appa- 
rently failed. The major failure in 
so-called compensatory education 
has been in the planning, size, and 
scope of the programme. We 
maintain that a variety of pro- 
_grammes planned to teach specific 
skills have been effective and that 
a few well-designed programmes 
which teach problem-solving and 
thinking have also been success- 
ful. The results from these pro- 
grammes strongly suggest that 
continuous and carefully planned 
intervention procedures can have 
a substantially positive influence 
on the performance of dis- 
advantaged children.” 
Jensen has been severely criticized 
on a number of counts, including the 
neglect of many of the research 
findings that throw doubt on his thesis, 
and the fact that a good deal of his 
argument is really irrelevant to the 
* 
subject of race differences. He makes . 
a strong case, for example, in favour 
of the role of genetics in determining 
variations among individuals and 
families; most psychologists would 
agree that heredity does play an 
important part in connexion with such 
individual variations, without, however, 
accepting his inference that this 
implies ethnic differences as well. 
On this latter point the conclusion is 
still “Not proven”. It should also be 
emphasized that Jensen is not nearly 
so dogmatic in his assertions as some 
newspapers reported. His actual 
words are that it is a “reasonable 
hypothesis” that genetic factors“may 
play a part” in intelligence differences 
between black and white children. - 
The many factors that enter into 
test performance, and that have been 
reviewed above, indicate, however, 
that even this relatively temperate 
position rests on no solid evidence, 
and that his hypothesis is far from 
“reasonable” in the light of the various 
considerations. 
One further important environmental 
factor emerges from the report prepar- 
ed by J. S. Coleman and his colleagues

NEW ZEALAND 
‘OUTLAWS RACIAL DISCRIMINATION 
New Zealand, a country which has always prided itself on its race relations, 
today seeks to maintain this situation through a law that will make racial 
discrimination illegal from January 1, 1972. With the country’s growing 
Maori population moving increasingly to the cities and an influx of Polyne- 
sians from the South Pacific islands, the government sees the need for 
safeguards against the possibility of racial tensions. New Zealanders have 
also become aware of changes in world opinion regarding racialism, and this 
has influenced the government to clarify the country’s position concerning 
racial equality. In recent years a greater awareness of the minority Maori 
group has developed in New Zealand. Intermarriage has contributed to 
the change, but so has an upsurge in interest in Maori arts and crafts 
and in the Maori language. Here, a young Maori woman—a former 
"Miss New Zealand"—greets a former president of the New Zealand 
Travel and Holidays Association with a “hongi"—traditional Maori 
greeting in which noses are touched together during the handshake.

before

in S. Africa 
Like other modern States. the 
Republic of South Africa is a 
country governed by laws. And 
the laws by which a country 
chooses to live are normally 
matters with which the United 
Nations not only does not concern 
itself, but which, in fact, it is 
expressly forbidden from inter- 
fering with by its own Charter. 
However, a feature that gives to 
the laws of South Africa the 
character and dimension which 
have caused concern throughout 
the world and which have made 
~ them the subject of formal denun- 
ciation by the United Nations 
can be simply stated : while these 
laws apply to all the people of 
South Africa—white and non- 
white alike—they are laws of 
the white man alone, enacted by 
the white man alone, for the 
benefit of the white man alone. 
Neither in the formulation nor 
in the execution of these “laws” 
do the Africans, who form 70 
per cent of the population, nor 
the Asians and the Coloured, 
have any voice or influence. 
It is this character which makes 
many of the “laws” of South 
Africa, in effect and in reality, 
instruments iniquity and 
oppression. i oF 
The following examples are dra 
from a study prepared by Pro- 
fessor Leslie Rubin of Howard 
University, Washington, D.C., a 
former Senator in South Africa, 
representing Africans, for the 
United Nations Secretariat's Unit 
on Apartheid, showing how legis- 
lation described by the South 
African Government as being 
designed to promote “separate 
development”, amounts to a 
legalized contempt for all human 
beings of the non-white races.

### 54304: Inequality before the law in South Africa

RACE AND COLOUR 
A person who is “obviously in appearance white” 
and is “generally accepted as a white person” may not be 
classified as a white person if one of his natural parents 
has been classified as a coloured person. 
AN African is “a person who in fact is or is 
generally accepted as a member of any aboriginal race or 
tribe of Africa”. 
A coloured person is “a person who is not a 
white person or an African”. 
A person who is not in fact an African, but “in 
appearance obviously is an African” will be classified as 
such in the population register, unless he discharges the 
onus of proving that he is not in fact and is not generally 
accepted as African. 
A man who “in appearance obviously is a white 
person” must be classified as a coloured person, if one of 
his natural parents has been classified as a white person 
and the other as a coloured person. 
IN deciding whether or not a person is “in 
appearance obviously a white person” the official concerned 
must take into account such person's “habits, education, 
speech, deportment and demeanour in general”. 
IF a person “in appearance obviously not a 
white person” is “generally accepted as a white person” 
in the area where he is employed, but is not so accepted 
in the area where he lives, he may not be classified as 
a white person. 
EVEN twenty-five years after a person has 
been classified in the population register as a white person 
and issued with the corresponding identity card, the Secre- 
tary of the Interior has the right to seek such person's 
reclassification. 
. MOVEMENT 
A proclamation in the Government Gazette 
may, at any time, prohibit any African from being in any 
town during such hours of the night as are specified, 
unless he is in possession of a written permit signed by 
his employer or by an authorized official. 
EE VERY African who has attained the age of six- 
teen years must be in possession of a Reference Book. 
Any policeman may call at any time on any African to 
produce his Reference Book. An African unable to do so 
because he has left it at home is guilty of a criminal offence. 
HOME, FAMILY AND RESIDENCE 
  
AN African who was born in a town and lived 
there continously for fifty years, but then left to reside 
elsewhere for any period, even two weeks, is not entitled 
as of right to return to the town where he was born and to 
remain there for more than seventy-two hours, unless 
he has obtained a permit. 
AN African who has, since birth, resided conti- 
nuously in a town is not entitled as of right to have living 
with him in that town for more than seventy-two hours a 
married daughter, a son who has reached the age of eigh- 
teen, a niece, a nephew or a grandchild. 
RF an African woman, having contracted a 
marriage, takes up permanent residence with her husband 
in accommodation provided by his employer in a town where 
her husband has lived and worked continuously for 
25 years, she is guilty of a criminal offence. 
A policeman is entitled to enter and search pre- 
mises on which he has reason to suspect that any Afri- 
can youth (eighteen years of age) is committing the crimi- 
nal offence of residing with his father without having been 
issued with the necessary permit to do so. 
AN African boy, aged sixteen, who has left 
school and lives at home with his parents (who maintain 
him) but does not work may, at any time, be arrested with- 
out warrant by a policeman who “has reason to believe 
that he is an idle person”, 
AN African who was born in a town and has 
worked and lived there for five years may be required 
at any time to leave that town and take up residence in 
a Bantu area where he has never lived and has no relatives 
or friends. If he remains in the town more than three days 
after he has received written notice to leave, he is guilty 
of a criminal offence. 
THE law of South Africa provides for the divi- 
sion of all towns into separate “group areas” in which only 
members of the white and the coloured “groups”, may 
own land or premises. 
INO “obviously white” person who is married to 
or cohabits with an African or a coloured person may be 
included in the white group. 
THE State President may, “whenever it is deem- 
ed expedient”, by proclamation in the “Government 
Gazette”, declare that a defined area which has been occu- 
pied by coloured persons who own land there (no matter 
how long such occupation and ownership have continued) 
shall be a white group area as from a specified date. 
When such white group area has been declared, a coloured 
person living in the area (even though he has lived there 
continuously for fifty years in a house which he owns) may 
not remain there longer than such period of grace, of not 
less than twelve months, as the Minister of the Interior, in 
his discretion, decides to grant. 
INO white person living in a town may (unless he 
has received a licence from the city council) accommodate 
on the premises which he owns the son of his African ser- 
vant who lives there, if such son has reached the age of 
ten years. 
A labour officer may, at any time, cancel the em- 
ployment of an African who works in a town, no matter 
how long he has been employed, even though his employer 
opposes the cancellation. An African whose employment 
has been cancelled, may be removed from the town where 
he worked and prohibited from returning to that town for 
such period as the labour officer specifies. 
A white person living in a town who employs 
an African to do any carpentry, bricklaying, electrical fitting 
or other skilled work without special exemption granted 
by the Minister of Labour commits a criminal offence. A 
white person living in a town commits a criminal offence 
if he employs an African as a waiter at a party in his 
home, unless such African has been granted the necessary 
permit by a labour bureau officer. 
BT is unlawful for an African worker to take 
part in a strike for any reason whatsoever. If he does, he 
is guilty of a criminal offence punishable by a fine not 
exceeding $1,400 or imprisonment for not longer than 
three years, or both such fine and imprisonment. 
AN African factory worker who calls on other 
workers to strike for an increase in pay commits a criminal 
offence.

OPINION AND EXPRESSION 
"THE South Affican Publications Control Board 
consists of nine persons (all of them white) appointed and 
paid by the Government. One of the functions of the 
Board is to prevent the showing of any film which depicts 
white and non-white children sharing the same class- 
room or white and non-white adults dancing with one 
another or white and non-white men and women embracing 
and kissing one another. 
ANOTHER function of the South African Publi- 
cations Control Board is to prevent the showing of any 
educational documentary film which expresses approval 
of racial integration or disapproval of discrimination based 
on race and colour. 
BT is a criminal offence for a newspaper to 
publish an article which is held by the court to have harmed 
relations between whites and Africans because it used 
strong language to assert that apartheid is unjust to the 
African people. 
"THE South African Publications Control Board 
may, by notice in the Government Gazette prohibit the 
importation into South Africa of all books (other than those 
for which it chooses to issue a special permit) published 
by a specified publisher, if it is of the opinion that such 
books are likely to create the impression that apartheid 
is unjust to the non-white people of South Africa. 
BF an African has received a letter from another 
African asking him to join in a peaceful demonstration 
against unjust apartheid laws, his premises may be 
searched at any time on a warrant issued by a magistrate 
for evidence that an offence has been committed. 
BF such letter was typed, the typewriter may be 
seized and delivered to a magistrate who may order that it 
be destroyed. 
ANY African born outside South Africa (even 
though he has lived in South Africa for 50 years and has 
not committed an offence) may be declared to be an unde- 
sirable inhabitant. 
AN African who writes “Down with Apartheid” 
on the wall of the house of any person, is guilty of a cri- 
minal offence. 
IF one issue of a weekly magazine published 
in South Africa has been held to be undesirable, and the 
Publications Control Board is of the opinion that every 
subsequent issue is likely to be undesirable, all future 
issues of the magazine may be prohibited as undesirable, 
by notice in the Government Gazette. 
THE RULE OF LAW 
AN African who has been required by an order 
of Court to leave a certain area must do so, and no 
Court of law may grant an injunction preventing such 
removal, nor may appeal or review proceedings stay or 
suspend such removal, even when it has been established 
beyond all doubt that the order of Court was intended for 
some other person and was served upon him in error. 
    
A NY person who breaks the window of a 
building (including a private residence) in the course of a 
demonstration calling for the grant of increased rights to 
the African people, is guilty of the offence of sabotage, 
unless he proves that his act was not calculated or 
intended to encourage feelings of hostility between white 
persons and Africans. The offence is punishable by sen- 
tence of death. 
ANY person who advocates military intervention 
by the United Nations in Namibia (South West Africa) is 
guilty of a criminal offence punishable by imprisonment

has been taken against him. 
A N African living in a Bantu area may not, 
without special permission to do so, carry a knife whose 
blade is more than 3} inches long, while outside the 
allotment on which he resides. If he does he is guilty of 
a criminal offence punishable by a fine of not more than

BALLET OF UMBRELLAS 
These photographs were taken by a French school- 
teacher, Marc Paygnard, of Longwy, in Lorraine. 
They hang on the walls of his classroom so that the 
children of his various classes can see the “ballet of 
umbrellas”, with its message of racial equality. One 
of the leading geneticists of the USSR, Nikolai Dubi- 
nin, recently wrote: “It can be said that today half 
of mankind is a product of racial mixture. In a few 
centuries whole populations of mixed races have 
been born on every continent. Ever since the disco- 
very of the New World by Columbus, a process of 
racial mixture has been going on that has been 
growing and expanding steadily, with the result that 
an amalgamation of races has taken place, tending 
to create one single, gigantic population. The rate 
of racial mixture of whites and blacks in North Amer- 
ica, for instance, was studied by two American scien- 
tists, B. Glass and C. Li, in 1966. They found that 
today, three and a half centuries after the. arrival 
of the Negroes in the New World, one third (30 9) 
of their genotype is made up of white genes. The 
speed with which this process is going on indicates 
that, even if we assume that prejudice against inter- 
racial marriages will not have totally disappeared, 
whites and blacks will be united as one single popu- 
lation in 75 generations or 2,000 years from today. 
That is, complete genetic equilibrium will have been 
achieved by then.”

THE 
OTHER 
PERSON'S 
SKIN 
by Mohamed Awad 
A well-known Arab poet, 
Mutanabbi by name, was fond of 
mixing his poetry with a dash of 
philosophy; and in one of his poems, 
it occurred to him to touch on the 
question of the colour of the skin. 
He asks: 
How is it that the sun darkens our 
[complexion 
And yet fails to darken our white 
[hair? 
Surely the two cases are one and 
[the same, 
If there is any justice in the world] 
Mutanabbi's subject in this poem is 
not the colour of the human skin and 
the factors that influence it. He is 
MOHAMED AWAD, of the Arab Republic of 
Egypt, Is a distinguished educator, authority 
on social questions, geographer, poet and 
translator of literature. He was a member of 
the U.N. Sub-Commission on the Prevention 
of Discrimination and Protection of Minori- 
ties (chairman in 1957 and 1958) and as 
Special Rapporteur, prepared the U.N. Report 
on Slavery published in 1966. Dr. Awad was 
Egypt's Minister of National Education in 1355 
and President of Alexandria University. In 
1960-62, he was president of the Unesco 
Executive Board and in 1964 Vice-Chairman 
of the Unesco General Conference. 
merely telling us about his flight from 
Egypt to Iraq, across the wilderness 
of Sinai and the deserts of northern 
Arabia. It was by no means a 
comfortable trip, for the rays of the 
sun are extremely strong at all times 
of the year. 
Mutanabbi employed good camels, 
brought specially from the land of the 
Beja in the Sudan. He travelled fast, 
because he wanted to reach Baghdad 
as soon as possible, and this obliged 
him to travel both by night and by day, 
exposing his skin to the scorching and 
merciless rays of the sun, 
Once settled in Baghdad he could 
see that his skin was considerably 
darker, while the hair of his head and 
beard had become whiter. We should 
note that white hair was a favourite 
theme in Arabic poetry, so it would 
be perfectly natural for Mutanabbi to 
refer in his poem to the contrast bet- 
ween the two phenomena: the skin 
that darkens and the white hair that 
fails to get dark. 
Mutanabbi lived over a thousand 
years ago. Had he been living these 
days, his philosophy touching the 
human skin would have been of 
a different kind. He would have

wondered how it came about that fair 
complexions should now, at great pain 
and expense, be exposed quite un- 
necessarily to the rays of the sun, in 
order that they might acquire the 
darkest possible shade. 
And not only do those fair com- 
plexions migrate to the sea-shore, to 
the high mountains, to the desert 
retreats of Arizona and Mexico, in 
search of the dark tinge; in addition, 
great factories are built for the pro- 
duction of liquids and oils and creams, 
which can be bought from chemists 
and drugstores all over the world, 
to help promote the process of 
soothing and darkening and browning 
the fair skin. It should then be a 
source of happiness to admire a 
beautiful dark-complexion, especially 
in these days when fashion dictates 
that considerable anatomy must be 
publicly displayed. 
Mutanabbi would surely have ex- 
pressed himself in a rather different 
philosophical vein regarding dark skin 
nowadays, when both Physics and 
Chemistry have combined to produce 
dark-brown shades, against which 
nobody has any colour prejudice.

### 54306: The Other person's skin

  
that the present writer faced the ques- 
tion of skin-colour, when, in April, 
1945, he came to the United States 
of America with the Egyptian Delega- 
tion, on its way to the San Francisco 
Conference. This was the famous 
conference which was to draw up the 
Charter of the United Nations, the 
charter that was to declare in its 
opening articles that there should be 
no differentiation of treatment, based 
on language, race, colour, religion, etc. 
While we were still in our plane, 
approaching the United States, we 
were each handed by the US Immigra- 
tion Administration a large sheet of 
paper, which carried a number of 
questions which we were required to 
answer faithfully and truthfully. While 
most of the questions were easily dis- 
posed of, there was one that really 
stumped me: it asked what was one's 
race. 
Although | was once told that in the 
U.S.A. | should be asked about my 
race, | did not take the remark seri- 
ously. Now on entering the States | 
realized that this was no joke; and | 
had to give an honest answer to an 
official question. 
It must be admitted that in spite my 
» £ 
geographical studies, which included 
a lot of anthropology, it was by no 
means easy for me to say to what race 
| belonged. The human species to 
which | presumably belong, was evol- 
ved on the face of this planet, probably 
somewhere in the south west of Asia. 
There, according to the most accepted 
theory, Adam and Eve got married, 
and began to produce an enormous lot 
of offspring. 
These offspring did not remain in 
their original home, but kept on wan- 
dering and multiplying and migrating 
from place to place. The wanderings 
must have lasted approximately a 
million years, in the course of which 
the human species was busy making 
new races, either by intermarriage or 
by other means. 
The number of these races must be 
very large. The U.S. Immigration Office 
wanted to know to which of them | 
belonged; or else, presumably, | would 
be refused participation in writing 
the Charter of the United Nations. 
Obviously | was in a predicament from 
which [| must try to extricate myself. 
The "U.S. Immigration Office prob- 
ably knew that | should not find the 
question an easy one to answer. So 
they tried to help the candidate to 
supply the required information, by 
suggesting that one should write that 
one's race was either white or col- 
oured. But this did not make the 
question any easier. | did not know 
how coloured | was. In the end | 
decided to try to be scientific and | 
wrote against race: “Mediterranean”, 
and handed the form to the represen- 
tative of the U.S. Immigration Office. 
He did not even look at it. 
| must inform the prospective visitor 
to the U.S.A. that this difficulty no 
longer exists, and one is not now 
asked that difficult question. 
The reason why | relate my early 
experience at some length is that 
it included a profound error, in stipu- 
lating that one’s race can be only 
described as either white or coloured. 
Scientifically speaking there is no 
human being who is not coloured to 
some extent. Even the fairest skin in 
the northern latitudes cannot be 
described as without colour. 
Skin colour differs in quantity but 
not in quality. It is the result of the 
presence of a huge number of micro- 
scopic glands under the skin, which 
produce a pigment, that protects the

22 
THE OTHER PERSON'S SKIN (Continued) 
The right to be different 
sensitive parts under the skin from 
injurious rays. In countries where the 
sun shines with great vigour, those 
glands become more active; the pig- 
ment produced is more substantial 
and the colour of the skin appears 
much darker. The environment is thus 
the decisive factor in giving the skin 
the colour it needs. 
In the northern climates, in the 
lands surrounding the Baltic and the 
North Sea, the rays of the sun are 
seldom strong, and the production of 
pigment is minimal. Here is the home 
of the Nordic Race, with its clear skin, 
blue eyes, and fair hair. Their glands 
produce all the pigment that is neces- 
sary for the climate; and should they 
emigrate to a much more sunny and 
warm climate, their skin hurts, and they 
have to apply more creams and oint- 
ments and wear dark glasses for addi- 
tional protection. As we move from 
the northern latitudes towards the 
Equator we begin to encounter darker 
skin and eyes and hair. 
It may be asked what happens to 
the person who cannot produce any 
protective pigment. This does occur 
in some persons whose glands do 
not function. Their skin has usually 
a sickly white appearence. They are 
known as Albinos; and their condition 
is lamentable. Albinism is the name 
of their disease and it may occur 
among animals as well as among 
humans. Fortunately, it is not very 
common, 
To distinguish people according to 
their colour is an old custom. One 
of the painted pictures left by the 
Ancient Egyptians denotes the kind of 
people known to them about three 
or four thousand years ago, and 
shows four different faces. One 
depicts an Egyptian, whose colour 
is reddish; another has a rather 
dark skin-colour and is meant to be a 
Nubian; a third has yellowish skin to 
denote a Syrian, and the fourth, repre- 
senting a Libyan, has a fair skin and 
blue eyes. There is no indication that 
one colour is superior to another. The 
picture simply represented the peoples 
with whom the Egyptians were most 
familiar. In other words, there was 
no idea of what we now call colour 
prejudice. 
Similar pictures of classical times 
represent the captured slaves from the 
Northern plains; their colour was much 
fairer than that of their Roman masters. 
When we come to modern times 
we witness examples of what must 
be considered colour prejudice. It is 
not necessary to trace the history of 
the phenomenon. The essential thing 
to note is that it exists in several 
parts of the. world, assumes different 
forms, and has produced different 
results. 
Colour prejudice consists essentially 
of a feeling that individuals with a 
certain skin colour are inferior. Usu- 
ally the persons considered inferior 
are those with a dark or deep brown 
skin, and they are considered inferior 
by individuals whose skin is fair. In 
other - words persons with little skin 
pigment consider themselves superior 
to those whose skin carries a lot of 
pigment. For the sake of easy expres- 
sion, we mostly call the former 
“white” and the latter “black”. 
The blacks living in a certain neigh- 
bourhood would not quit their homes if 
a white family came to settle there, nor 
would they leave a hotel, if a white man 
came to stay there for a night or two. 
Both cases are fairly common where 
the newcomer is black. 
Many urban districts have been 
abandoned by their white occupants as 
soon as a few black families came to 
live there. These black families may be 
culturally or materially well off; but 
this will not affect the result. The 
neighbourhood soon becomes a black 
man’s environment. 
Sou countries have at- 
tempted, with a certain measure of 
success, to combat this segregation, 
particularly in the schools maintained 
by the State, and even in some insti- 
tutes of higher learning. In social 
circumstances, however, little progress 
has been achieved. People will still 
live in districts whose inhabitants carry 
the same amount of pigment, and 
intermarriage is usually frowned upon. 
One may be permitted to say, in 
passing, that the policy of desegrega- 
tion deliberately followed by the U.S. 
Government is still in its early stages, 
and is bound to achieve greater results 
in course of time. Already the U.S. has 
Negro millionaires, and there are a 
particularly large number of sports 
champions and Negro artists who are 
held in the greatest esteem at home 
and abroad, irrespective of the amount 
of pigment in their skin. 
There are, unfortunately, communi- 
ties which have carried colour pre- 
judice to the extreme limit. No account 
of racial prejudice is complete without 
reference to the miserable conditions 
which obtain in the Republic of South 
Africa, where colour prejudice has 
been responsible for the misery of 
about fifteen million people, and where 
it has been designated by a special 
name: Apartheid. 
South Africa is the only country in 
the world that proclaims the inequality 
of its citizens in its laws. The South 
Africa Act, 1961, declares that only 
white persons may become members 
of the all-powerful parliament. Though 
an Afrikaans word, meaning separa- 
teness, apartheid has come to mean 
a policy of the State, based on racial 
segregation and racial discrimination 
and pursued in a most rigorous and 
brutal manner by a minority of whites 
against the large majority of Africans, 
coloureds and Asians. In order to 
pursue such a policy, a cruel regime 
has been established, supported by a 
police state and the most cruel “legal” 
machinery imaginable. 
For the public, the literature is fairly 
simple: Signs reading “Whites only” 
“Non-whites only." These signs are 
on poles standing in playgrounds, 
parks and beaches; they are painted 
on benches, stencilled on telephone 
boxes and nailed over sports fields, 
concert halls, post offices and rail- 
way stations. 
No place is too lowly for them 
—the urinals are strictly segregated— 
and no complication is too great: at 
new stations separate counters are 
provided for white luggage, for non- 
white luggage, and for white luggage 
to be fetched by non-white persons. 
The colour bar applies to sex, with 
policemen shining their torches 
through windows to catch white and 
black in forbidden embraces (Immora- 
lity Act). It applies to disaster, with 
white ambulances being prevented 
from carrying non-white casualties 
(Hospital Board Regulations); and it 
applies to death, with burial grounds 
racially zoned to ensure that the 
bodies remain as divided in death as 
they were in life (Group Areas Act). 
Such are the conditions in the 
Republic of South Africa, where colour 
prejudice exists at its worst. Little 
wonder that the regime in South Africa 
is only recognized by some twenty 
countries, and it is difficult to imagine 
that such a regime can survive for 
very long. 
In conclusion, | would hope that the 
different examples of the problem of 
skin colour have helped to show that 
while the properties of colour are 
mostly the result_of natural factors, 
colour prejudice is definitely no 
natural. |

- Exactly 100 years ago, a young Russian scientist, Nikolai Miklukho- 
Maklai (above), landed on the coast of north-eastern New Guinea, the 
world’s second largest island. He was to make five expeditions in all 
to this “terra incognita’, where he pioneered anthropological studies 
and became an active defender of the Papuans and their independence 
(see article opposite). In his thinking on racial questions, particu- 
larly his rejection of the myth of racial superiority, he was ahead of 
his times. Below and on the following pages we publish passages from 
his diaries, correspondence and other papers.

### 54308: A 19th century champion of anti-racism in New Guinea

1. September 1871, the 
Russian corvette “Vityaz™ dropped 
anchor in Astrolabe Bay in New Gui- 
nea, and a young Russian natural 
scientist by the name of Nikolai N. 
Miklukho-Maklai went ashore. To this 
day, the place carries the name Maklai 
Shore. 
| ask the reader to take himself 
back 100 years, when many scientists 
were devoting their efforts to finding 
evidence to substantiate Darwin's 
theory of the evolution of man from 
the ape-like predecessors. Scientists 
travelled to the deepest, darkest 
corners of the earth in an attempt to 
find a living, rather than fossilized, 
specimen intermediate between man 
and his predecessors. 
The “Jena heretic”, Ernst Haeckel, 
one of Darwin's most ardent followers, 
felt the Papuans of New Guinea 
represented this missing link. Guided 
by superficial observations made by 
navigators from aboard ship that the 
body hair of the Papuans grew in 
tufts, he categorized them as a “tuft- 
haired” race. 
After attending his lectures at Jena 
University, Nikolai Miklukho-Maklai 
found himself in disagreement with 
Haeckel on this question. He saw the 
danger of the possible racialist 
conclusions that could be drawn from 
the allegations about a “tuft-haired” 
race. This played no small role in his 
deciding to devote several years to 
studying the life of primitive peoples. 
the “tuft-haired” people and began 
conducting anthropological research. 
This is all now part of history, but 
100 years ago it was a major achieve- 
ment. Every day among the Papuans 
brought new discoveries, but many 
were the days when his life hung upon 
a thread. 
To avoid the loss of the results of 
his research he showed the Russian 
officers who escorted him to the 
island, where he would bury his notes 
“so that if | should not survive, my 
manuscripts, in cylinders, would be 
unearthed and sent to the Russian 
Geographical Society.” 
Fortunately, Miklukho-Maklai did 
survive, although his health was 
seriously impaired because of the 
climatic conditions, so difficult for him, 
a European, to adjust to. He was able 
to win the confidence of thé Papuans, 
learn the Bongu language, collect 
unique ethnographic and anthropolo- 
gical specimens, and make important 
advances in scientific research, 
Miklukho-Maklai made five separate 
voyages to New Guinea: three to 
Maklai Shore, where he lived a total 
of two years and eight months, one 
to the northwest shore and one to the 
southeast shore of the peninsula. He 
travelled twice to the islands of 
Melanesia and Micronesia, visited 
some Polynesian islands, made two 
difficult and dangerous expeditions 
into the depths of the Malacca penin- 
sula, visited the Philippine islands, and 
lived a long while in Australia. 
The 
diaries, 
Convinced that an adequate study of 
the Papuans could be made only at 
first hand, Miklukho-Maklai set sail for 
New Guinea. He settled among 
scientist's articles, 
and collections,

From a report of his travels 
to the Russian Geographical Society 
St. Petersburg, 1882 
W HEN, in November 1877, | finally decided to return to Singapore on an 
English schooner that chanced to pass by, | sent a message to all villages that 
two people from each should appear before me—the oldest and the youngest. 
However, more than two persons from each village came to me, so it was a large 
crowd that gathered near my hut. | told them that | was leaving them, probably 
for a long time. They very much regretted my departing. 
| then explained to them that there would probably be other people, also white 
like myself, with the same kind of hair and in the same kind of clothing, coming 
to them on the same kind of ships as | arrived on, but that it was most likely that 
they would be people completely different from Maklai. | considered it my duty 
to warn the natives about that class of traders who to this day make the islands 
of the Pacific Ocean a place of very sad events. 
To this day, you meet with so-called “kidnappings”, that is, the abduction of 
people into slavery by various means... | anticipated that the same thing could 
happen on New Guinea that happened on the Melanesian Islands (the Solomons, 
New Hebrides, etc.), where the populations decreased markedly due to slavery. 
Therefore, feeling that Maklai Shore would also in time be visited by the slave 
traders, | considered it my duty to warn the Papuans and explain to them that 
although they might see the same kind of ships and the same kind of people as 
Maklai, these people could carry them away into bondage. This warning filled 
them with consternation, and they tried to persuade me to stay. 
especially those connected with his 
stay on Maklai Shore, constitute a 
golden treasure of world ethnographic 
science. Modern researchers studying 
the culture and life of the Papuans of 
New Guinea still refer to the works 
of Miklukho-Maklai. “How rich the 
culture of the tribes of Tangu may 
have been can be imagined from the 
drawings and sketches of Miklukho- 
Maklai,” wrote, for instance, the well- 
known English scholar, K.O.L. Burridge. 
Miklukho-Maklai pioneered the 
ethnographic and anthropological study 
of New Guinea. He staunchly de- 
fended the concept of mankind as a 
single species: the Oceanians were 
retarded in their cultural development 
by virtue of a number of historical 
causes, but in their intellectual and 
moral qualities they were not at all 
inferior to Europeans. Miklukho- 
Maklai not only subjected racialism to 
scientifically valid criticism, but became 
an active fighter for the freedom and 
independence of those peoples. 
His feat is a brilliant example of 
selfless service to science. But 
besides the purely scientific side of 
Miklukho-Maklai's feat, there is yet 
another—the humanitarian side—which 
the great Russian novelist Leo Tolstoy 
noted and considered of primary 
importance. 
He wrote to Miklukho-Maklai “As 
far as | know, you are the first to 
prove indubitably by experience that 
man is the same everywhere, that is, 
a decent, social being, with whom 
intercourse should be entered into 
with kindness and truth, and not with 
cannons and vodka...” |

The 'tuft-hair’ of the Papuans 
From his diary (January 3, 1872) 
Maklai Shore, New Guinae 
For a long time now, it has seemed to me an incorrect pro- 
position that the hair of the Papuans grows in tufts or “bunches”. 
But the huge “wigs” of my neighbours have not permitted me to 
clearly ascertain just how the hair is distributed. In observing the 
distribution of hair on the temples, crown and nape of the neck of 
adults, | was able to note that there was no special grouping of 
the hairs in tufts, but so far | have not had occasion to see a 
shortly-cropped head of hair among the natives. 
«. | soon fell asleep.., Through my sleep, | heard voices calling 
me and, seeing the callers, | immediately jumped up. It was Kolle 
from Bongu with a nine year-old boy who was very closely cropped. 
| examined his head with great interest and attention and even made 
drawings of what seemed to be the most important. | was convinc- 
ed of the fact that the hair of the Papuans grows not in bunches or 
tufts as is written in many anthropological textbooks, but exactly the 
same as ours. -

Reflections on the fate 
of the aborigines 
From a letter to his friend A.A. Meschersky 
(later Secretary of the 
Russian Geographical Society) 
- Maklai Shore, New Guinea, October-November 1877 
ReriecTions about the fate of the aborigines to whom | have 
become so attached often occurred and always led to the same 
question: would | be doing the natives a service if | facilitated access 
to their country by Europeans through my knowledge of this country, 
its customs and language. 
The more | thought about it, the more | was inclined to a negative 
answer. Sometimes | put the question the other way: looking at the 
incursion of the whites as an unavoidable eventuality, | then asked 
myself: whom should | help—to whom should | give the advan- 
tage—the missionaries or the traders? 
The answer was always—neither one nor the other, since the 
former, unfortunately often and under disguise, actually engage in 
the activities of the latter, paving the way for them. | therefore 
decided that in no way, either directly or indirectly, will 1 promote 
the establishment of relations between the whites and the Papuans. 
Arguments that the dark races, being lower ard weaker, must give 
way to the higher and stronger white variety, seem to me to constantly 
demand more and more proof. In accepting this proposition and 
advocating the destruction of the dark races by arms and disease, 
the next logical step is to suggest that those among the whites 
who do not fit a given ideal of a member of the chosen white race 
should also be picked out and destroyed. 
Logically, a further conclusion would be to consider various hospi- 
tals, orphanages and alms-houses to be unnecessary and even 
harmful, and to advocate a law that every newborn baby who does 
not reach a certain length and weight should be removed, etc. 
When, on the other hand, with the aid of impartial observation, 
one arrives at the conclusion that the different parts of the earth 
with their various conditions of living cannot be populated by a 
single group of the species homo with identical organizations, quali- 
ties and abilities, and when one realizes therefore that the existence 
of various races is completely consistent with the laws of nature, 
one must then recognize that the members of these races are 
entitled to universal human rights, and must agree that the des- 
truction of the dark races is nothing other than the use of brute 
force, which every honest person should oppose... 
 
     
‘I have decided to 
defend their just cause’ 
From a letter to A.A. Meschersky 
The Pacific Ocean (March 17, 1876) 
H LEFT New Guinea in December 1872, despite the 
persistent appeals of the natives that | remain with them; 
but | promised them | would return when | knew that 
my coming could be of benefit to them. 
Recently, because an incursion of European coloni- 
zation, with ail its dangers to the natives, has been 
threatening my black friends, | have felt that the time 
has come for me to fulfil my promise, which | must 
and want to keep, despite the fact that this decision 
will tear me away for a time from purely scientific work. 
At the present moment | am en route to Maklai Shore, 
where | plan to settle with the aim, in accordance with 
my promise, of trying as best | can to be of help to 
the natives, that is, to do as much as possible to prevent 
the collision between European colonization and the black 
population from having any disastrous consequences for 
the latter (as happened in Tasmania, continues in Austra- 
lia, and will most likely happen on the Fiji Islands). 
| hope that the opinion of all honest and fair people 
will prove sufficient patronage and protection for my 
cause against the illegal claims of governments and 
against the unjust and violent deeds of various European 
exploiters and those who seek enrichment and personal 
profit by any and all possible ways and means. 
If, despite all my endeavours, my efforts turn out to 
be in vain, then perhaps the scientific research and study 
in this already familiar country will compensate for my 
sacrifices of time, health and money; if not, the know- 
ledge that | kept my word will be sufficient reward. 
| would hope that my friends know me well enough 
not to consider my decision to be a frivolous act and 
will maintain their former friendship and sympathy for 
me, knowing that regardless of anything, | am keeping 
my word and returning to New Guinea, not only as a 
naturalist, but also as a “protector” of my black friends 
of Maklai Shore, and that | have decided to defend as 
much as | am able their just cause: their independence 
in the event of European incursion (which would have 
inevitable fatal consequences for the natives), although 
| realize that their cause is a matter of the weak against 
the strong!

### 54308: A 19th century champion of anti-racism in New Guinea

Might is not right 
From a letter to Sir Arthur Hamilton 
Governor of Fiji and High Commissioner 
of the Western Pacific 
Sydney, Australia, (January 23, 1879) 
B Y the exercise of patience and by dint of fair and very friendly behaviour, 
| have finally succeeded in gaining the full confidence of the natives, 
who at first, and for several months, were far from friendly. 
After learning the Papuan language, | have been able to study their ways 
and customs. Having spent nearly three years among these people and having 
had the time to assess their character and capabilities, | feel a deep and 
disinterested concern for their future, especially since | foresee that an invasion 
of New Guinea by white men could easily, indeed almost certainly would 
spark off a chain of catastrophic and regrettable events. 
However, | am sure that many of these repugnant injustices committed by 
the strong upon the weak could be avoided if the governments of the civilized 
world, respecting the precepts of justice, would confirm and enforce the elemen- 
tary principles of the law of nations and of international law.

THE NATIVES OF MAKLAI SHORE REJECT GERMAN ANNEXATION 
— MAKLAI 
Letter from Tolstoy 
September 25, 1886 
ID EAR Nikolai Nikolayevich, thank 
you very much for sending your 
brochures. | was very pleased to read 
them and found in them much of 
interest. What moves me and arouses 
my admiration is that, as far as | know, 
you are the first to prove indubitably 
by experience that man is the same 
everywhere, that is, a decent social 
being, with whom intercourse should 
be entered into with kindness and 
truth, and not with cannons and vodka. 
And you proved this by a feat of 
genuine courage which is so rarely met 
with in our society that the people of 
our society do not even understand it. 
Your case seems to be as follows: 
people have lived for so long under 
the deception of violence that both the 
oppressors and the oppressed have 
come to believe that this abnormal 
relationship among peoples, not only 
among cannibals and non-Christians, 
but even among Christians, is actually 
normal. 
Then, suddenly, one man, under the 
pretext of scientific investigation 
(please excuse me for this frank 
expression of my belief) goes alone 
among the most fearsome savages 
with neither gun nor bayonet, but 
armed with reason alone, and proves 
that all the outrageous violence by 
which we live in this world is only old, 
outlived humbug, from which people 
who wish to live rationally should 
have been freed long ago. 
This is what is so touching and 
admirable to me in your work, and 
why | so desire to see you and enter 
into communication with you. 
Please let me tell you the following: 
even if your collections are very 
important, more important than any- 
thing that had been thus far collected 
from anywhere in the world, then, even 
in that case, all of your collections 
and all your scientific observations are 
as nothing compared with those 
observations of human characteristics 
which you made while you lived among 
the natives, communicated with them, 
and influenced them by reason alone. 
And, therefore, for the love of all 
that is holy, set down in the greatest 
detail and with the strict adherence 
to truth which is characteristic of you, 
all of the person-to-person relation- 
ships you established among those 
people. 
| do not know what contribution 
your collections and discoveries will 
make to the branch of science which 
you serve, but your experience 
among the natives is epoch-making in 
the science which | serve, namely the 
science of how people should live 
with one another. Write that story 
and you will perform a great and good 
service to all mankind.

by Ali. A. Mazrui 
Coron with a world 
of tense relations between racial and 
ethnic groups, what can the school do 
to reduce and eliminate such tensions? 
How can societies use their educa- 
tional systems to improve the quality 
of inter-group relations among the 
coming generations? 
Inter-group relations vary signifi- 
cantly from one country to another, 
and techniques for resolving group 
tensions have, to some extent, to be 
related to the special features of the 
country concerned, 
The division which cannot, for the 
time being, be escaped is the one 
between the white world and the 
coloured world, between white children 
and coloured children and the parti- 
cular problems which have to be 
faced if the quality of their mental 
images of each other is to be 
improved. 
If we were considering education 
in an exclusively white country, the 
emphasis in educational reform might 
have to be towards promoting greater 
tolerance of alien cultures and alien 
groups. But if we were concerned 
with education in an exclusively black 
country, we’ might have to contend 
not with the problem of intolerance, 
but with the problem of the depen- 
dency complex. 
The educational system in an African 
country might need to handle the 
crisis of a sense of psychological 
inadequacy, sometimes seen in the 
indiscriminate imitation of western 
culture, and sometimes in aggressive 
hostility towards that culture. Both 
cultural aggression in the black man 
and cultural imitation could be symp- 
toms of an inner dependency complex, 
still struggling to find ways of self- 
liquidation. 
  
AL! A. MAZRUI, of Uganda, is head of the 
Dept. of Political Science and Public Admi- 
nistration at Makerere University, in Kampala. 
He is the author of “Violence and Thought: 
Essays on Social Tensions in Africa® (Long- 
mans, London) and “Towards a Pax Afn- 
cana” (Weidenfeld, London). 


### 54310: Learning the three T's in school

Learning 
the three T's 
in school 
But what about a country which is 
racially mixed? There are times when 
equal attention might need to be paid 
both to promoting greater tolerance 
in white children and to overcoming 
dependency in coloured children. But 
since racially mixed societies are not 
all at the same stage of integration, 
the relative sizes of the problems 
might vary considerably. 
As a generalization, we might say 
that the central problem in South 
Africa for the time being is not so 
much black dependence, as white 
arrogance. If we were hoping to see 
educational reforms in South Africa, 
the first emphasis might be towards 
transforming the attitudes of the white 
children in the direction of greater 
tolerance and understanding of groups 
other than their own. The problem 
of the dependency complex in black 
children, though certainly very much 
there, is for the time being secondary 
in a society whose stratification arises 
purely from the racial assertiveness 
of the whites. 
But a look at American society re- 
veals a different emphasis. There is 
indeed still the lingering problem of 
white arrogance as an aspect of the 
American racial scene. On the black 
side there are two problems—the 
residual dependency problem and the 
problem of loss of identity. 
The residual dependency problem 
may be manifested in “Uncle Toms”, 
people who are taken or mistaken to 
be blind imitators of western or Anglo- 
Saxon norms, and who feel uneasy 
about being abandoned by the Anglo- 
Saxon world. But the dependency 
phenomenon in the United States may 
take more subtle forms than that of 
blatant imitation, it may sometimes 
lead to aggressive reaction to what is 
taken to be white abandonment of the 
black man. 
What challenges do these inter- 
ethnic and inter-racial problems pose 
for educational systems? One point 
which needs to be grasped immediately 
is that the problem of relations bet- 
ween races has points in common 
with problems of relations between 
religious denominations, as in Ireland 
or between tribal groups, as in Kenya 
and Uganda. The educational impli- 
cations of plural societies may be 
strikingly similar, regardless of whe- 
ther the plurality derives from racial, 
religious, or ethno-cultural differences 
On close examination it may well 
turn out that there are at least three 
politically significant values which can 
be inculcated by the educational 
system, regardless of the nature of the 
society, and indeed regardless of the 
regime in power. We might call these 
values “The Three T's of Training in 
Nationhood”. The T's | have in mind 
are first, Tolerance, second, Toil, and 
third, Teamwork. They are themselves 
to be seen as supplementary perhaps 
to the three R's of basic education 
—Reading, Writing and Arithmetic. 
B. “Tolerance” 1 do not 
mean the promotion of a sense of 
“brotherhood”. The idea of human 
brotherhood is a religious idea, and 
people respond to it more positively 
when they are listening to a sermon 
in a church than in their day-to-day 
lives. It is just not realistic enough 
to expect people who are otherwise 
rivals and strongly in competition, and 
have no connexion of any kind with 
each other in blood or cultural affinity, 
to regard each other as brothers 
nevertheless. : 
Even the Christian imperative of 
“love thy neighbour” is a tall order. 
Even a literal neighbour may be quite 
demanding—if he plays his gramo- 
phone too loud at night, or if his 
children are noisy and boisterous. 
The critical issue for a society is 
not how much brotherhood there is, 
but how much tolerance. There is no 
special credit in being favourably dis- 
posed towards your own brother. The 
real test comes when, in spite of 
being unable to regard a stranger as

The Masai, a pastoral people who range along the great Rift Valley of Kenya and Tanganyika 
(Tanzania), have preserved many ancient customs including that of blood brotherhood. Above, 
a young Masai girl prepares a white boy for a "brotherhood" ceremony. She took a liking to him 
because his hair is cut as short as that of Masai girls. Children are not born with racial prejudice; 
they learn it as they grow up. And ignorance of other peoples and their cultures creates the false 
beliefs and stereotypes from which racial prejudice develops.

LEARNING THE THREE T's (Continued) 
 
Tolerance, toil and teamwork 
your brother, you still tolerate his un- 
usual and idiosyncratic ways. 
Our societies need, above all, the 
capacity to tolerate people of. differ- 
ent cultural backgrounds, or differ- 
ent regions or identities, or different 
political views. Our societies need to 
be guided not necessarily by the 
values of liberalism in their totality, 
such as individualism, nor indeed by 
the institutions of liberalism, such 
as certain types of parliaments and 
certain types of multi-party systems. 
But our societies do need to be 
governed by the liberal rules of the 
game—the rules which simply say 
“Live and let live". The liberal rules 
of the game permit competing view- 
points and competing interpretations 
of reality to survive together. The 
liberal rules of the game prescribe 
toleration of differences and of plura- 
lism. 
Tolerance is, in fact, the most diffi- 
cult of these three values to inculcate 
in children. Children are notoriously 
intolerant at times, and can be pain- 
fully and brutally cruel. The question 
of what kind of approach should be 
adopted to foster and build-up their 
capacity to tolerate others is perhaps 
one of the most important and yet in- 
tractable problems in the whole field 
of child education. 
But, at the level of intellectual toler- 
ance, there is a good deal to be said 
for a system of education which puts 
a special premium on debating as an 
activity. The idea of getting school- 
children to debate amongst themselves 
on a variety of fundamental issues 
has great potential as a teaching 
device to promote tolerance of differ- 
ing viewpoints. The training here 
springs from exposure to radically 
polarized viewpoints. 
The debates should take place 
several times a term, instead of once 
or twice a year. By all means combine 
these debates with the idea of invit- 
ing controversial speakers to address 
current affairs societies, and answer 
student challenges and expostulations, 
but controversial speakers should 
supplement confrontations between 
students themselves over intellectual 
issues. 
Debating becomes a useful tech- 
nique in a situation of fluid values, 
partly because it helps to sharpen the 
faculties of deciding between different 
values, and gradually developing a 
sophisticated evaluation of different 
alternatives. Debating is also a criti- 
cal training in the art of toleration. 
The imperative of Toil, like the other 
two T's, is subject to cultural varia- 
tions. Attitude to work is conditioned 
by those cultural factors. President 
Nyerere in Tanzania has claimed that 
in traditional Africa everyone was a 
worker—"a worker” not just as distinct 
from “employer” but also as distinct 
from “loiterer™ or “idler”. 
Nyerere sees work in traditional 
Africa as a factor balancing African 
hospitality. The tradition of hospitality 
and support for one's kinsmen could 
all too easily result in parasitism. The 
obligation to work is the safety valve 
against excessive hospitality. As 
Nyerere put it: 
“Those who talk about the African 
way of life, and quite rightly take 
pride in maintaining a tradition of hos- 
pitality which is so great a part of it, 
might do well to remember the Swa- 
hili saying “Mgeni siku mbili; siku ya 
tatu mpe jembe” or in English: “Treat 
your guest as a guest for two days; 
on the third day, give him a hoe.” 
The incentives to work in traditional 
Africa were often in the following 
order: first, the need to meet the indi- 
vidual's own basic needs and those 
of his immediate family; secondly, the 
individual's contribution to the welfare 
of neighbours and kinsmen if this is 
customarily expected; and only thirdly, 
the individual's interest in accumulating 
more things for himself and aspiring 
to self-improvement as distinct from 
self-maintenance. 
Te ordering of priorities is 
quite significant. It is not correct that 
the traditional African subordinated his 
own basic needs to those of his com- 
munity. His own basic needs came 
first, the needs of his community and 
kinsmen came second, and the need 
for personal improvement came third. 
The incentive to hard work varied 
accordingly. Working for personal 
maintenance made good sense; 
working hard to meet one's normal 
or customary obligations to one's 
kinsmen also made sense; but working 
hard for some undefined target of 
self-improvement was, in many cases, 
less clearly understood. 
Perhaps educators could investigate 
ways of transmitting the ethic of work 
in a manner which attempts to recon- 
cile working for society with working 
for one's own improvement. The very 
process of acquiring an education 
poses the dilemma as between educa- 
tion for effective citizenship as against 
education for personal ambition. 
What should be remembered is 
that the harder it is to acquire an edu- 
cation, the more it will be regarded 
as a passport to a future life of 
leisure. Many African children walk 
long distances every day, and take 
heavy part-time work, in an endeavour 
to acquire an education. Because they 
have acquired their education the hard 
way, they tend to feel at the end of it 
that they have now “arrived” and 
deserve to rest. Thus the educated 
become, alas, an élite of leisure. 
The third “T" of Training in Nation- 
hood is the imperative of Teamwork. 
It is important that, at all levels of 
education, there should be opporiu- 
nities for teamwork. These should 
range from encouragement of basket- 
ball and soccer to encouragement of 
student political societies and social 
organizations. The aim should be the 
promotion of national integration, 
Africa is confronted with ethnic 
pluralism and cultural diversity. The 
interaction between different tribes 
could generate considerable stress 
and tension. The quest is for a system 
which would permit these groups not 
only to tolerate each other—which 
is the first pre-condition—but also to 
work with each other in pursuit of 
shared goals. And even when the 
groups are in competition, the com- 
petition itself should be subject to rules 
of fair play. 
Some school games may be better 
suited for training in tolerance and 
teamwork than others. [If so, which 
are which? Educational research could 
pay renewed attention to the study 
of sports and games, and their com- 
parative efficacy as media of sociali- 
zation and promotion of national 
values. 
If certain games, as yet untried in 
African schools, are better for citi- 
zenship-training than those which are 
already popular, there is a compelling 
case for experimenting with the new 
games. In some situations the gym- 
nasium may be a more effective school 
of values than an ideological insti- 
tute can hope to be. 
In countries which are hoth multi- 
ethic and multi-religious, there should 
be a purposeful policy to ensure that 
each school not only mixes races and 
tribes but also mixes religions. The 
theory of cross-cutting loyalties as a 
mechanism for integration provides 
the basis for this recommendation. 
If some black families are Catholic 
and some are Protestant, and some 
white families are Catholic and some 
are Protestant, integration in schools 
should not only aim to mix blacks 
with whites but also to mix, at the 
same time and in the same school, 
black Catholics with white Catholics 
and black Protestants with white 
Protestants. 
The fact that these categories in 
such a school overlap and cut across 
each other would itself reduce the 
dangers of a neatly reinforced confron- 
tation. On some issues white would 
gang up with white against a black 
opposition, but on others white Pro- 
testants would gang up with black 
Protestants against Catholic opposi- 
tion. The fluidity of alliances afforded 
by criss-crossing pulls of this kind

J 
LEARNING THE THREE T's (Continued from page 30) 
would themselves be a step away from 
a petrified and rigid ethnic confron- 
tation. 
Another pre-condition for the pro- 
motion of inter-ethnic harmony is the 
application of the principle of cultural 
parity to the curriculum. Where 
groups have different cultural back- 
grounds it is imperative that the educ- 
ational system should not betray too 
sharp an evaluation in favour of one 
cultural heritage as against another. 
The eruption of black studies in the 
United States is itself one indication 
of the quest for cultural panty in the 
educational system of that country. 
But black studies have to be an 
intermediate measure, to restore 
balance, rather than a permanent 
innovation. After all, there are no 
“white studies” as a distinct area of 
academic pursuit in the United States. 
To single out black studies as a 
separate entity itself implies an 
absence of cultural parity. Full cul- 
tural parity would only be achieved 
when the educational system has 
integrated more coherently a respect 
for the black heritage fully integrated 
into one curriculum, instead of isolated 
as a separate esoteric preoccupation, 
In Africa, cultural parity also 
requires important reforms in curricula 
and syllabuses. The inherited assump- 
tion that not enough African history 
has been recorded to be usable in 
school syllabuses has already been 
vigorously challenged. Courses in 
African history are provided increas- 
ingly, though the pace of Africanization 
of syllabuses has been considerably 
slower in former French Africa than in 
former British Africa. 
The introduction of creative writing 
by Africans as part of the courses in 
literature is another innovation of the 
last few years. Books by African 
writers are being introduced with 
increasing emphasis in African schools. 
Basically, in much of English-speak- 
ing Africa, there is a vigorous pursuit 
of cultural parity, though many educ- 
ational reformers among Africans 
would argue that not enough has been 
achieved. Francophone Africa, in 
submissive dependency within the 
educational system, continues to be 
decisively Franco-centric. 
Finally, there is the problem of the 
staffing of schools. 
A situation where a disproportionate 
number of teachers belong to a differ- 
ent community from the students they 
teach has potentialities for creating 
either submissive dependency or 
aggressive dependency. In the United 
States, aggressive dependency among 
black children in schools has, from all 
accounts, been rising. In much of 
Africa the massive use of imported 
teachers continues to consolidate 
more submissive dependency rather 
than aggressive. 
Two policy recommendations are 
particularly urgent. One concerns 
the headmaster. As rapidly as poss- 
ible African secondary schools should 
have African headmasters. The case 
for African headmasters is particularly 
strong in those schools which have a 
disproportionate number of white 
teachers. A black headmaster, clearly 
active and in authority, helps to 
reduce the dangers of socializing the 
children into a persistent dependency 
orientation towards the white man. 
As regards primary schools, unless 
it is desperately necessary, there 
should be no white teachers working 
in black primary schools. 
One reason is that the primary age 
is a particularly impressionable stage 
in the socialization process. It is 
important that at this stage the child 
should be spared conditioning influ- 
ences which would adversely affect 
his orientation towards the Western 
world. 
But another reason why it is imper- 
ative for primary schools to have 
African teachers concerns the very 
structure of primary education. At 
the primary level the child normally 
has one teacher in any particular year, 
or at any rate one main teacher. 
There are continuities here with the 
role of the parents, emphasized by 
the very fact that the teacher remains 
the same. 
In conditions like those of the United 
States a modification of policy is in 
order. Black schools should, as far 
as possible, aim for mixed staffing, 
with a black headmaster, conspicu- 
ously authoritative and active. It 
would not do to have a black head- 
master mistaken for just a figurehead, 
an Uncle Tom placed there for appear- 
ances. His authority over his staff 
should not be too subtle. 
White schools should attempt to 
have at least one or two black 
teachers and, where realistic, a black 
headmaster. The images which have 
to be transformed in black children 
are fundamentally different from those 
which need to be transformed in white 
children. It therefore makes sense 
in white schools to appoint a black 
headmaster where one is available 
and suitable; but to have a white 
headmaster in a black school should, 
for the time being, be avoided. 
While the introduction of such 
educational techniques should be 
seriously considered, it ought always 
to be remembered that the school is, 
in the final analysis, only one agency 
of socialization, only one factor in 
helping young people to find an 
identity. Society as a whole must 
engage in similar self-analysis for 
reform if the positive effects of a 
rational educational system are not to 
be neutralised by countervailing 
influences from the social world 
beyond the classroom. un 


### 54302: Race and I.Q.

RACE AND [L.Q. 
for the U.S. Office of Education, and 
published under the title Equality of 
Educational Opportunity in 1966. 
When a pupil from a minority group 
living in “a home without much educa- 
tional strength is put with schoolmates 
with strong educational backgrounds, 
his achievement is likely to increase”. 
The effect is similar when those with 
“strong educational backgrounds” are 
black rather than white, but it is not 
surprising, in view of the whole history 
of the United States, that such favour- 
able home backgrounds are found 
more often in the case of white chil- 
dren. 
For this reason, one of Coleman's 
findings is of great significance, 
namely that “the avérage Negro ele- 
mentary child is in schools where 
(Continued from page 13) 
16 per cent of the students are 
whites”; the proportion rises in sec- 
ondary schools, but in 1966, it was 
still only 24 per cent. 
In this connexion it should be point- 
ed out that the U.S, Government and 
the law courts are strongly committed 
to reducing this disproportion, and are 
insisting on a much more significant 
degree of school desegration, but the 
actual changes in the schools take 
place very slowly. 
The net result of all the research 
that has been conducted in this field 
is to the effect that innate racial 
differences in intelligence have not 
been demonstrated; that the obtained 
differences in test results are best 
explained in terms of the social and 
educational environment; that as the 
environmental opportunities of dif- 
ferent racial or ethnic groups become 
more alike, the observed differences 
in test results also tend to disappear. 
The evidence is overwhelmingly against 
the view that race is a factor which 
determines level of intelligence. 
As formulated in the Unesco 
“Statement on Race”: “lt is now 
generally recognized that the intelli- 
gence tests do not in themselves 
enable us to differentiate safely 
between what is due to innate capacity 
and what is the result of environmental 
influences, training and education. 
Wherever it has been possible to 
make allowances for differences in 
environmental opportunities, the tests 
have shown essential similarity in 
mental characteristics among human 
groups.” |

This is Little Blue. Little Yellow is Little 
Blue's best friend. 
  
  
One day Mama Blue says to 
Little Blue, "Wait for 
me at home." 
But Little Blue wants 
to play with Little Yellow. 
“Where is Little Yellow?” 
he asks. 
  
Here he is. They hug each other 
so hard that... 
...they both turn green. 
Little Blue and Little 
Yellow, now both green 
as could be, return home. 
But Papa and Mama Blue 
say, "You are not our Little 
Blue, you are green.” 
Papa and Mama Yellow say, 
“You are not our Little 
Yellow, you are green.” 
Little Blue and Little 
Yellow are very sad. 
They burst into tears, 
yellow and blue tears. 
Suddenly they turn blue 
and yellow again. "Now 
they will recognize us,” 
they exclaim. 
i. 
Papa and Mama Biue are 
overjoyed to see their Little 
Blue again. 
  
  
  
They kiss him and hug 
him tight. 
They also kiss and hug 
Little Yellow. As they 
do so, both turn green. 
Now it dawns on them what 
has happened.   They rush to Papa and 
Mama Yellow to tell them 
the good news.   ol They all kiss and hug each 
other with joy.   All become green— 
without envy.
