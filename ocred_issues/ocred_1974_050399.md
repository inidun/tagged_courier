### 188406: Lost treasures of the cinema, a call to halt the negligence (and even vandalism) through which many thousands of films have perished since the birth of the cinema industry

A call to halt the negligence 
(and even vandalism) through which 
many thousands of films 
have perished since the birth 
of the cinema industry 
by Bhagwan D. Garga 
I. is a fair assumption that 
more movies (of the silent era, at least) 
have disappeared than have survived. 
How much of the work of Lumiére, 
Méliés, Feuillade, Ince, Griffith, Sjos- 
trom, Dupont, Pabst, Chaplin, Max 
Linder, Clair and other great pioneers 
of the cinema has been lost to pos- 
terity through wilful destruction or plain 
neglect? How many millions of metres 
of priceless documentary material, that 
could bring alive a whole era, have 
vanished? 
Some years ago, | was engaged 
in making a film anthology of the 
Indian cinema.  Enthusiastically, | 
drew up a list of significant films and 
proceeded to search for them. In 
Calcutta, 1 went to see the proprietor 
of a well-known film production com- 
pany and asked him to let me use 
excerpts from them. These included 
both silent and sound films. He took 
one look at the list and handed it back 
to me, saying, “I don't have any of 
them”, 
“What happened to them?” 
“They were lying around for quite 
a while, then we decided to send 
them to Madras.” 
“Why Madras?” 
“Because the junkmen there, for 
some reason, paid a better price than 
in Calcutta.” 
To my horror, 1 was to discover 
later that of the total production of 
  
BHAGWAN D. GARGA of India is a well 
known film-maker, cinema historian and film 
critic. He has written on many aspects of 
the Indian cinema and has produced a num- 
ber of documentary films on Indian film-mak- 
ing and Indian art. He was a member of 
the Unesco committee of experts on Anthol- 
ogies of the History of the Cinema, and in 
1971 won the Grand Prix at the 4th Interna- 
tional Film Review, Colombo (Sri Lanka). 
some 1,300 silent films, not even half 
a dozen had survived. Of these, two 
—The Light of Asia and A Throw of 
Dice—were Indo-German co-produc- 
tions, copies of which had somehow 
found their way to the Cinémathéque 
Frangaise and the National Film Ar- 
chive of Great Britain. 
The lost films included such well- 
known works as Balidan (Sacrifice) 
based on a play by Rabindranath Ta- 
gore; Mrichakatika (The Little Clay 
Cart) an adaptation of Sudaraka's 
Sanskrit classical play of that name 
(3rd-4th century AD), and a film on 
non-violence called The Wrath in which 
the protagonist was a Gandhi-like char- 
acter. There were numerous mytho- 
logy films done in the style and on the 
scale of the Italian super-production 
Cabiria, and our own variations on 
Pearl White's The Perils of Pauline. 
Vandalism was not confined only to 
the silent cinema. Hundreds of well- 
known sound films had been made 
over to junk dealers as a matter of 
routine. There was no trace, for ins- 
tance, of the first Indian sound film, 
Alam Ara. Consequently, the history 
of Indian cinema has yawning gaps 
that no amount of academic research 
can now close. 
India is not the only case. The 
destruction of films has continued 
unabated all over the world. The great 
director Fritz Lang, in a foreword to 
Herman G. Weinberg's nostalgic book, 
Saint Cinema, recalls the lost films 
of H. d'Abbadie d'Arrast, who died in 
1968, the creator of “eight of the love- 
liest films ever made by anyone". 
Lang says: “His films are lost for 
ever, like many other films important 
for the art of the cinema and for its 
historians, because studio policies 
aimed at the destruction of old films 
printed on inflammable nitrate stock. 
These same studios, as Erich von Stro- 
heim has pointed out, ‘were not above 
salvaging the few cents worth of silver 
which formed part of the cellulose 
base’. 
In 1956, on the occasion of the 
twentieth anniversary of the founding 
of the Cinémathéque Frangaise, its di- 
rector, Henri Langlois, gave an alarm- 
ing recital of films lost or destroyed 
through neglect or wanton callousness. 
The answers | received in response . 
to a questionnaire | recently sent to 
several film archives, are enlightening. 
Eileen Bowser, Associate Curator of 
the Department of Film in the Museum 
of Modern Art, New York: 
“There is no law against the des- 
truction of films in this country. | wish 
there was, but it is unlikely we could 
achieve such a law under our system. 
There is a form of legal deposit in 
that if you wish your film to be protect- 
ed by copyright, you must eventually 
deposit a copy of it in the Library 
of Congress.” 
Of the lost films in the United States, 
she added, “There are hundreds of 
significant American films that have 
been lost over the years, not neces- 
sarily because of destruction, but be- 
cause nitrate films have been allowed 
to deteriorate. A few years ago, we 
did an exhibition of still photographs 
and brought out a publication called 
‘Lost Films’, to call attention to some 
of the important films which had 
disappeared, which had the result of 
finding a few of them.” 
Ib Monty, Director of the Danish 
Film Museum: 
“We could draw up an enormous 
list of Danish silent films that have 
been lost. Out of a production of 
around 1,700 silent films only around 
225 have been preserved.” 
Jorn Donner of the Svenska Film 
Institute, Stockholm: 
“Many of the significant films from 
the silent period have disappeared; 
according to our estimates about two- 
thirds of all films and about half the 
valuable films.” 
Kevin Gough-Yates, Deputy Curator 
of the National Film Archive, London: 
“There is no law in England against 
the destruction of films... There are 
many significant films that seem to 
have been lost, not only British ones. 
Merton of the Movies, for example, is 
one that cannot be found, but there 
are many others.” He further added: 
“My own view is that unless the

### 188406: Lost treasures of the cinema, a call to halt the negligence (and even vandalism) through which many thousands of films have perished since the birth of the cinema industry

  
    
   
    
Some of the world's great films are now no 
more than names in the history of the cinema. 
Fragile, an easy prey to neglect, indifference 
and outright vandalism, they are lost forever, 
except for a few stills which have survived in 
archives. Here we show scenes from three of 
these films: (1) Broken Blossoms, made in 1919 
by the great American director D.W. Griffith 
(1875-1948); (2) L'Atlantide, directed by the 
French film-maker Jacques Feyder (1885-1948); 
(3) The Wrath, an Indian film whose hero is a 
Gandhi-like character. Others, which were once 
thought to have disappeared, have in fact sur- 
vived, a single copy having narrowly escaped 
destruction. An example is Jean Renoir's, The 
River (4), made in India in 1951. Other films 
have been preserved because they were bought 
by their stars or their directors. Here are 
scenes from two of them, starring famous 
American comics: (5) Safety Last, made in 
1923, with Harold Lloyd; and (6) Go West, 
1926, starring Buster Keaton (1896-1966), who 
was also its director.

4 government introduces legislation to 
enforce producers to deposit material 
with the national archive much material 
will be lost.” 
What about the socialist countries 
where production is state-sponsored 
and controlled? It came as a reve- 
lation to me when Jan Zbigniw Pas- 
tuszko, Director of the Polish Film 
Archive, wrote to say that there was 
no law against the destruction of films 
in his country. Poland, he said, aimed 
at preserving films produced before 
1945, but present-day films were left 
to fend for themselves. 
Dr. Sandor Papp, Director of the 
Hungarian Institute of Film Science and 
Archives, informed me that the Hun- 
garian Film Archive “has been func- 
tioning since 1948, and from 1957 as 
an independent organization. Most of 
the films before this period, including 
about 50 per cent of those made 
between 1930 and 1944, have been 
lost.” 
In India, the largest producer of 
films in the world, the situation is even 
more dismal. The National Film Ar- 
chive of India was established in 1964, 
although a recommendation that one 
should be created was contained in 
an Enquiry Committee report published 
as far back as 1927-28. The proposal 
was revived in 1951 with much greater 
emphasis by another committee ap- 
pointed by the Indian government. 
The National Film Archive finally came 
into being 13 years later. 
According to an official publication 
(Reference Annual, 1974), the “Ar- 
chive's collection, as of December 31, 
1972, totalled 835 films, consisting of 
~ 624 Indian and 211 foreign films"—a 
far from impressive figure considering 
that in the same year, India produced 
414 feature films, not counting the vast 
number of documentary and reportage 
films. Since the advent of sound (in 
1931) India has produced well over 
11,000 feature films and perhaps an 
equal number of short films. It is 
apparent that most of these have 
either perished or are in various stages 
of deterioration. 
Indian laboratories in all the major 
centres of film production—Bombay, 
Calcutta and Madras—still hold hun- 
dreds of nitrate base films which no- 
body claims, yet in the absence of a 
legal fiat to do so, the laboratories 
are unable to make them over to an 
archive. To the trade wing of the 
industry, the moment a “property” 
ceases to be “productive”, it is best 
forgotten. 
The researcher and the historian 
apart, the man who really feels con- 
cerned about it is the creator of the 
film. But not having any commercial

The first well-known film library, the Cinémathéque Francaise, 
was founded in Paris in 1936 by an ardent “cinema buff”, Henri 
Langlois. Langlois already had a small collection of old films, 
which he had been buying for four or five years. It was then 
relatively easy to get hold of “antique” films, dating from before 
the introduction of the rental system, because the original 
owners eventually got rid of them and they ended up in flea- 
markets and junkshops. At that time, of course, people did 
not realize all the precautions that were needed to preserve 
old film stock. 
Furthermore, a number of the major studios kept extensive 
film archives; as a result, it has been possible to re-issue many 
interesting films in recent years and to put together documen- 
taries and comedy films from old newsreels and shorts. 
But at the time, no-one bothered to keep old films: once their 
commercial career was over, producers lost interest in them, 
Even before film libraries started to become more numerous, 
however, private collectors were at work, and film stars and 
directors in particular, had already begun to save copies of 
their films. Mary Pickford, for instance, is said to own copies of 
nearly all the films in which she and her husband, Douglas 
Fairbanks Sr., appeared, 
Perhaps the most interesting story, however, is that of the 
three great stars of early American film comedy: Harold Lloyd, 
Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton. Comedy films, whether 
shorts or feature-length, date less and are often a better 
reflection of the vitality of cinematic art than straight films. 
The first comedies were made around 1905-1906, in France 
and Italy, with Max Linder, André Deed, Charles Prince (Riga- 
din), etc. It was not until 1910 that Mack Sennett in the 
United States set out to emulate the French and Italians, imme- 
diately achieving immense popularity. The next few years saw 
the débuts of the great stars of comic films: Lloyd (the most 
popular in the U.S.A.) and Chaplin in 1913, Keaton in 1917. 
According to the histories of the cinema, Lloyd made 180 
shorts, Chaplin 66 and Keaton 67. Between 1921 and 1923, a

NICK OF TIME 
T bree dates stand out in the dramatic story of old 
films and their preservation: 1895, when the cinematograph 
was invented; 1914, when films first began to be hired out; 
and the mid-1930s, when the first film libraries were founded. 
In all the arts, there are works which have been lost to 
posterity. All trace of them has disappeared forever. This is 
hardly surprising in the case of pre-medieval music and musical 
notation for dancing. But it has taken only a few decades for 
similar havoc to be wrought on works of the cinema, the 
youngest of the arts, although films are relatively easy to 
preserve. 
One could draw up a long list of fine films which today 
only exist in histories of the cinema, beginning with the often- 
quoted examples of Broken Blossoms (1919), by D.W. Griffith, 
the first great American director, and Jacques Feyder's L'Atlan- 
tide (1921), of which only stills remain, 
turning-point in the history of the cinema, all three of them 
began to make full-length films: Keaton made most—63 films 
of more than four reels (1,200 metres), Lloyd 18 and Chap- 
lin 14, 
As they approached the height of their popularity, they tried 
to collect copies of their own films. Apparently, Keaton was 
the least successful; he was the least wealthy of the three, and 
retrieving 63 feature films is no mean task. Harold Lloyd, who 
left the cinema in 1947 and became a successful businessman 
and President of the Beverley Hills Chamber of Commerce, 
was more or less successful, and his collection is famous 
throughout the United States. As for Chaplin, he owns and 
markets all his feature-length films. It is to be hoped that 
sooner or later all these treasures of the U.S. cinema will end 
up in America’s greatest film collection, that of the New York 
Museum of Modern Art,     
control over it, he is a helpless spec- 
tator of the destruction of what is 
really part of himself. 
A few years ago, Jean Renoir, the 
famous French director, was desper- 
ately looking for a copy of his film 
The River, which he had shot in India 
and which he so dearly loved. The 
negative of the film was fast deteriorat- 
ing but the producer (a Hollywood 
florist) was in no hurry to do anything 
about it. In the absence of an ade- 
quate authorization, the laboratory was 
reluctant to take out a print. One can 
imagine Renoir's agony. As it hap- 
pens, the film has since been revived 
commercially, but a master's work 
could have been lost forever. 
Not every film-maker, however, has 
the means and the foresight of a 
Renoir or a Chaplin (see box above). 
Nor are the archives over-anxious to 
save all the films. Most curators >

select films for preservation according : 
to their pet preferences. 
Are these preferences and preju- he 
dices justified? Do we know which 
of the current films will interest scho- 
lars 30 or a hundred years from now? 
Doesn't this indifference towards some y 
and preference for others constitute 
a kind of vandalism? | had better : | 
leave the answer to the man most 
qualified to give it, and who, more 
than anyone else, has put the world 
cinema in his debt: Henri Langlois. by Henri Dieuzeide 
- In an interview with Rudolph Chel- 
minski of Life, Langlois said: “The most 
important role of a cinémathéque, is 
to preserve. There are many things 
which seem to be without value, to 
which time gives style invisible today. 
Baudelaire and the Eiffel Tower are 
examples. Other cinémathéques be- 
fore the war had plenty of money and 
could have saved many films. Why 
didn't they succeed? Because they 
thought of choosing, while they really 
ought to have been thinking of saving 
everything. 
“Judging, like criticism, is a game. 
It is gambling with the future. So | 
take all films—| have no reason to 
refuse any of them. | even have films 
| detest. 
“| never accepted that films couldn't 
be saved. Once | got a bunch of the 
old films and sent them out to a lab 
to be cleaned and put on new reels. 
They sent them right back. They're 
all stuck together, they said. You 
might as well chuck them in the gar- 
bage can. 
“Well, I'm just a poor dope, not a 
chemist. So | sat down and unstuck 
them image by image, washed off the 
sections and hung them out to dry on 
clothespins. 
“After that | got stubborn and read 
up on how to recondition films—it's 
all there in the books, you know, but 
no one had ever bothered to look. 
Everyone told me that films would 
only last 20 or 30 years at the most. 
so what was the use of trying to keep 
them? Well, we have some of the 
very earliest silent films in our collec- 
tion and we're still waiting for them 
to deteriorate.” 
Perhaps, this is a film lover's ap- 
proach. Certainly there aren't many 
around. What is of paramount impor- 
tance is the preservation of films, all 
films, no matter where produced. They 
should be treated on a par with the 
rest of our artistic heritage—a heritage 
in which all of us have a stake. n

Portable videotape equipment now permits 
people all over the world 
to master the art of television 
instead of being passively exposed to it 
Eon Ministers of 
Culture, meeting under Unesco's 
auspices in Helsinki, in June 1972, 
noted with concern that the mass 
media, while helping to extend access 
to culture, also “fragment society and 
induce a sense of alienation.” They 
consequently invited “the anonymous, 
solitary and helpless spectator” to do 
all he could to “break out of the pas- 
sive role to which he may be led.” 
But at a time when radio and tele- 
vision systems were expanding every- 
where—a development strongly sup- 
ported by Unesco—by what means 
and at what cost could the television- 
viewer, alone or in a group, be ensured 
of effective participation in the pro- 
duction of information whose output 
had hitherto been a one-way process? 
To these questions a group of 
experts meeting _in Vichy about this 
time under the auspices of the French 
National Commission for Unesco, 
proposed this tentative answer: por- 
table video. : 
This was the period when electronic 
videotape recorders of an easy-to- 
handle type, such as the “Portapack”, 
were beginning to .appear. These 
combine cameras and recorders, 
weigh less than twenty pounds, are 
battery-operated, give half an hour's 
continuous shooting and record 
extremely precise images of 300 to 
400 lines on half-inch or 2/3 inch video- 
tape. Their price is less than that of a 
low-powered car. 
Some might have thought that this 
possibility of being recorded on tape 
and viewing oneself immediately on a 
screen was at most a technical 
gimmick, a sort of electronic polaroid 
camera. 
Others saw portable video as a 
useful instrument for making in-depth 
analyses of individual performances, 
suited, for instance, to helping 
Olympic champions perfect their

swimming-stroke or their sprint, or for 
door-to-door salesmen to improve the 
technique of “putting their foot in the 
door.” 
But even at this early stage, in a 
few industrialized countries this new 
technique began to be used for social 
action, and it has continued to be 
developed along these lines ever 
since. 
In New York, the People’s Video 
Theater started up, along with the Rain- 
dance Corporation, Global Village 
(named for the expression coined by 
Marshall McLuhan), Videofreex and 
Urban Video; in California, the Mafundi 
Institute, Videofree America and the 
Media Access Center. In Canada 
there was Matrix Video in Vancouver, 
and in Great Britain, the VTX Londdn 
Video Co-op. In France, Collectif 
Vidéo and Video Out were founded in 
Paris and Vidéo Gazette in Grenoble. 
The groups which survived this 
period were those which were able 
to obtain political and financial support. 
Some became connected with uni- 
versities or television organizations. 
In Canada, a “social action group” 
called Société Nouvelle in Quebec and 
Challenge for Change in the other 
provinces has been financed since 
1971 by the National Film Board. 
Challenge for Change is designed “to 
improve communication, create greater 
understanding, promote new ideas 
and provoke social change.” 
In France, since 1972, the Centre 
National d'Animation Audio-Visuelle 
(National Audio-Visua] Centre) created 
by the Fonds d'Intervention Culturelle 
(Fund for Cultural Action) has been 
supporting some video groups. 
In the United States, despite their 
precarious institutional footing, most 
of these groups are going concerns: 
some have contracts with foundations 
or federal bodies and hire out video 
equipment by the day, hold seminars 
and even courses counting as credits 
at university and provide training 
sessions for adult organizations and 
for industry. Some have opened up 
“video theatres” to which admission 
is charged, or produce documentaries 
to order on local or family celebrations. 
All in all, there are around a hundred 
active “alternative video” groups 
scattered through the United States 
and Canada, Japan and Western 
Europe, and Unesco is currently 
studying their activities. 
Most of these groups still show 
signs of their origins in the under- 
ground and in protest movements. 
Although they obviously take their 
inspiration from the underground 
press, which is written, distributed and 
revamped by its readers, they are 
more concerned with fulfilling an 
“ecological” role: while opposed to 
“visual pollution”, they consider that 
the biological equilibrium of the indi- 
vidual depends on his being fed 
information. “An image-addict loses 
the ability to evolve”, they say. “To 
survive in a communicational environ- 
ment, one needs to have and to master 
the tools of communication.” 
For this reason they reject tele- 
vision, which they regard as an 
industrial, prefabricated product, and 
have come to spearhead the major 
critical movement which sees mass 
communication as an archaic instru- 
ment and a source of alienation. 
U. covereony more in- 
fluenced by cybernetics than its Euro- 
pean counterpart, the new American 
generation is indeed particularly con- 
scious of the one-sided, non-reversible 
character of television and of the 
passive role of the viewer on whom an 
image is imposed without his being 
able to project anything back in return. 
They are also aware of the social 
tensions and psychological deviations 
which may result from this. A case in 
point is that of the demonstrators in 
Great Britain who suddenly brought 
their demonstration to an end so as 
to be able to get home in time to see 
themselves on the news. One of the 
aims of the video revolution is to give 
back to the passive viewer, who has 
become an object, his essential 
dignity as a subject. 
With the “Portapack”, which makes 
it possible instantaneously to repro- 
duce from life any event as it occurs 
(an “electronic ball-point pen” they 
call it in Quebec), the video groups 
see an opportunity of removing the 
barrier which exists between the 
producer and the consumer, 
Unlike conventional television, what 
is recorded can immediately be seen 
and discussed. Each individual viewer 
can participate in the process. What 
counts is no longer mass response 
but individual exchanges and inter- 4

TELEVISION IN THE STREET 
Portable video equipment is today being widely used as a tool for 
community development. In the province of Emilia-Romagna, in 
Italy, for example, the provincial authorities have provided various 
groups (workers, teachers, lawyers, students, etc.) with video 
sets to record TV films for broadcasting throughout the region. 
Right, one of these groups interviews a passer-by on Piazza Verdi 
in Bologna. 
In Africa, video tape recording is being used in the countryside 
of Tanzania experimentally to open a dialogue between village 
groups and local and central government as part of the country’s 
creation of the Ujamaa community villages. Unesco is studying 
the setting up in Tanzania of a video centre to train the villagers 
to use this new type of communication for development. 
actions, creating via the image a two- 
way traffic. Video provides a com- 
munication process and not consumer 
products: it is a tool for bringing 
people together, not a means of 
isolating them. 
What these groups are trying to do, 
for instance, is to arrange for every 
recording to be seen and discussed 
by people in a group, at the same time 
recording the discussion so that the 
viewers become participants in the 
first recording, at one remove. In this 
way, instead of there being one-way 
communication, there is multi-direc- 
tional communication which, like 
mirror-play, can go on indefinitely and 
is both creative and liberating. 
Despite the few attempts that have’ 
been made by American groups to 
create a “video art”, most of these 
groups deliberately seek not to create 
finished works. Of course, sometimes 
they do not have the means or the 
technical skill, but on the whole what 
they are out to obtain is a totally un- 
contrived and even stark visual effect. 
Their messages are “open-ended”, 
capable of being constantly modified— 
close-ups of faces in the street, people 
casually . or vigorously exchanging 
words, slices of life, visual fantasies. 
The image recorded on the tape is 
ephemeral by nature: it can be erased, 
in time it fades. A work which is 
unfinished bears the mark of authen- 
ticity: what is produced is an un- 
embellished image and not the 
finished result of an elaborate organ- 
izational process. Video is to tele- 
vision what the “happening” is to 
traditional theatre. 
Although politically, aesthetically 
and morally opposed to traditional 
television, these groups do not seem 
to be really concerned about forming 
pressure-groups aimed at influencing 
the mass media. Their concept of 
alternative television does not hinge 
on a desire to programme the system 
differently but rather on the desire 
for a different system or even for a 
complete absence of system in which 
everyone would be both a spectator 
and an actor. 
Although they often take as their 
slogan “guerrilla television”, these 
groups generally appear to be pro- 
foundly “non-violent”. They want 
neither to take over nor to destroy 
existing television organizations, but to 
deprofessionalize and de-institution- 
alize them. They are tired of “public . 
writers” holding a monopoly on 
writing for a people of illiterates. 
From this ferment of activity, which 
is leading people to speak out, or 
rather to attempt the difficult task of 
mastering the still relatively undevelop- 
ed medium of visual communication, 
a certain number of trends seem to 
be emerging. 
First of all, video is used in social 
therapy by bringing people into 
contact with images of themselves 
recorded in conditions of complete 
freedom and spontaneity,. and in this 
way, relations between them are 
transformed: the camera does not lie 
and one's own image becomes a 
source of self revelation. 
In America, psychiatrists have begun 
treating problem-families using re- 
cordings made in their homes. At the 
psychiatric hospital of La Chesnaye 
in France, patients have been produc- 
ing their own programmes since 1971. 
More generally, the image serves to 
bring people into relationship with 
each other, providing a way out of 
situations of conflict by making them 
talk about problems which directly 
concern them. The free image spells 
free communication. 
It has become common practice in 
America to establish “visual records” 
for the authorities on the basis of 
recordings of protests, grievances, 
proposals and discussions within a 
community. [n France, a team travel- 
ling in a videobus through villages 
in the Landes, carried out an exper- 
iment aimed at getting communities to 
express their views on the develop- 
ment of the Aquitaine region. 
The most significant advances have 
been made in Quebec with “Vidéo- 
graphe”, a combined video work- 
shop, theatre, public forum and dis- 
tribution centre. As early as 1971 for 
the first time a professional television 
crew was placed, twenty-four hours a 
day, at the service of all citizens 
wishing to produce and present to a 
public of their choice a programme 
over which they had total control. 
Today, after using video to pioneer 
community TV and help revitalize the 
economically failing rural areas of the 
Saint-Jean Lake region and the poor 
districts of Montreal, the Quebec 
video-operators plan to take a video- 
bus to the Indians of Abitibi and to 
thirty or so deprived parishes in the

remote area of Gaspésie so as to give 
the people there the chance to air 
their views. 
In the province of Emilia-Romagna 
in Italy, efforts have been made to 
“reverse the flow of information 
between leadership and the grass 
roots” by providing groups (factories, 
schools, housing estates, hospitals) 
with portable equipment to enable 
them freely to express their points of 
view. Here, in contrast with the 
“Vidéographe™ project, it is the 
organized group and not the indi- 
vidual citizen that is given the chance 
to speak. 
In New York, the black communities 
of Harlem and the Puerto Ricans of 
East Side have taken part in re- 
cordings in which group spokesmen 
were invited to express their opinions 
about “those on the other side” and 
then to examine these opinions 
together, the discussions being re- 
corded in their turn, 
In the Bronx, a vast campaign 
organized by Hunter College provided 
a large number of the inhabitants 
with the opportunity to speak about

the various possible futures that they 
wanted for their district. In various 
instances in the United States the use 
of video at key-moments in situations 
of racial conflict in communities seems 
to have acted as a safety-valve, 
There is no escaping the fact, 
however, that these attempts to stimu- 
late social communication have a 
tendency to bring out latent conflicts 
and that, here and there, they have 
presented the authorities with a few 
problems. After agreeing to give their 
support to community relations activi- 
ties based on the use of video, some 
mayors have been criticized by their 
own electors, to the surprise of 
everyone. 
Education itself has been affected. 
It has been observed that young 
people born around 1960, those who 
in the United States are called the “VT 
generation” (videotape) in contrast 
with the earlier, "TV generation”, 
display considerable expertise in the 
use ‘of portable videotape recorders 
and that they readily make use of them 
to express their views on society and 
on the future. This generation is out 
to master the image for itself instead 
of being passively exposed to it. 
In Washington, an experiment is 
currently being carried out in which 
a group of a hundred or so children 
is being provided with video equip- 
ment and being given the task of 
preparing a series of visual projects 
aimed at bringing improvements to the 
city. 
In Philadelphia, the Clinton Project 
represents a very enterprising effort to 
get young school-children to use 
mobile video so as to improve their 
perceptive awareness and personal 
interaction. 
Video is also beginning to be used 
by teachers for their own professional, 
and especially in-service, training at 
most training colleges in the United 
States. This is true to an even greater 
extent in Great Britain, where portable 
equipment belonging to the Inner 
London Education Authority is used to 
record what is known as micro- 
teaching, i.e. schoolwork performed in 
small groups. The recording is sub- 
sequently subjected to detailed critical 
analysis by the teacher concerned, by 
other teachers and by the pupils, so 
as gradually to define an ideal refer- 
ence model for improving interactions 
between teachers and pupils and 
between videotape-operators and 
groups. 
Recent studies carried out at the 
University of Lausanne show that the 
industrial applications of video should 
help to establish new relations between 
management and workers, Within the 
factory or company, video makes it 
possible to provide an overall view 
of the organization and to simplify 
descriptions of its activities, thanks 
for instance to the visual analysis of 
jobs. It enables viewpoints to be 
compared and brings out the con- 
tradictions between real-life situations 
and the formal reality of regulations. 
Lastly, mention should be made of 
the temptation to turn video into a 
new political weapon. The American 
groups that have moved on from a 
very militant conception of the use 
of video to more pragmatic views, 
often express their surprise in face of 
the tendency of most European video 
groups to broadcast a traditional 
political speech.~

by Gerald Oster 
F ROM microscopic marine 
shells to the celestial galaxies, spirals 
abound in Nature. In geometric terms, 
a spiral is a plane curve that winds 
around a central point while moving 
ever farther from or closer to it. The 
figure is thus produced by the com- 
bined operations of rotation and ex- 
pansion or contraction. 
The essential feature of a spiral is 
that a straight line drawn from the 
centre to the curve, known as the 
radius vector, changes in length with 
the rotation. A tight spiral has a small 
change in its radius vector for a given 
amount of turning, an open spiral has 
a large change. 
The extreme example of a tight 
spiral is a circle, a figure produced 
by pure rotation in which the radius 
remains constant. The extreme case 
of an open spiral is a straight line. 
Here the figure is produced by pure 
expansion without any rotation and 
the radius is infinite. 
The ancient Greeks were evidently 
fascinated by the spiral. They in- 
corporated it in the capitals of their 
lonic , columns and based many of 
their vases, such as the amphoras, - 
on whole or partial spirals. Typically 
for the Greeks, all of these man-made

### 50402: From the snail to the galaxy, nature has evolved an infinity of spirals

From. the snail to the galaxy 
Nature has evolved an infinity of 
curves followed strict mathematical 
rules. 
There are many kinds of spirals; 
their differences depend on the 
manner In which the length of the 
radius vector changes with angle of 
turning. Perhaps the simplest spiral 
to conceive of is the one discovered 
by Archimedes in the 3rd century B.C. 
and described in some detail in his 
book On Spirals. 
The Archimedes spiral is the figure 
produced by a sailor when he coils 
While each turn moves the 
curve uniformly farther and farther 
from its centre, the distance between 
adjacent coils remains constant. In 
other words, the length of the radius 
vector is proportional to the angle of 
rotation. 
Some other examples of this type 
of spiral can be illustrated by the 
movements of an imaginary ant. If an 
ant was to move outward from the 
centre of a rotating turntable at a 
constant velocity in what it presumed 
to be a straight line, it would actually 
be moving in an Archimedes spiral. 
The functioning of the common 
record player is the ant trick in 
reverse. The pickup arm, guided by 
the needle, is constrained to follow 
the Archimedes spiral groove of the 
record and hence moves from the 
outside inward at a uniform velocity. 
If an ant was trained to climb up

### 50402: From the snail to the galaxy, nature has evolved an infinity of spirals

From the galaxy to the atom, spi- 
rals abound in Nature, appearing 
whenever there is outward growth 
combined with rotation. Here we 
show four examples: (1) A nautilus 
shell, the perfect exampie of an 
equianguiar spiral, its structure here 
revealed by X-ray; (2) A spiral galaxy 
seen in the heavens as a diffused 
luminous mass and similar in form 
to our own galaxy; (3) Nuclear part- 
icles visible as a spirai in a nuclear 
research bubble chamber; (4) A 
spirai formed by a drop of oil on a 
giass plate turning at constant speed. 
a cone at a constant slant, its course 
—a conical helix—when viewed from 
above, would be seen to be an Archi- 
medes spiral. Similarly, mountain 
roads that ascend at a constant incli- 
nation appear in aerial views as such 
spirals. 
Crystals that grow around imperfec- 
tions, called screw dislocations, in the 
orderly arrangement of their atoms 
exhibit the Archimedes spiral. 
Electron micrographs of a cross 
section of developing nerve fibres in 
prenatal human life and in infants up 
to about a year old also show an 
Archimedes spiral. This suggests that 
the nerve covering, or the myelin 
sheath, is laid down like the insulation 
wrapped around an electrical wire. 
Another wrapped spiral structure in 
the body is the organ of hearing with- 
in the ear, the cochlea, which gets its 
name from the Greek word for snail. 
Let us return to the ant climbing 
up the cone. If, as it nears the top, 
it becomes progressively more tired 
and takes a path of diminished slope, 
the spiral it describes will become 
tighter and tighter. If the ant's degree 
of tiredness follows a geometric 
progression, the spiral will be of the 
type known as equiangular.   The equiangular spiral has been the 
subject of considerable study since 
the French philosopher and mathema- 
tician René Descartes first correctly 
defined it in 1638, In this figure, as 
the name implies, the spiral cuts all 
its radii at the same angle. The 
smaller that angle, the more open the 
spiral; conversely, the larger the angle, 
the tighter the spiral, >

) If a sea captain should stubbornly 
order his ship to follow a fixed com- 
pass course, the vessel would cut the 
meridians at a constant angle and the 
projected curve it would follow would 
thus be an equiangular spiral. In 
theory, such a course would cause 
the ship to spiral into either the North 
or South Pole. 
Flying ants follow an equiangular 
trajectory when moving toward a 
source of light; a peculiarity of the 
insect's eye causes it to maintain a 
fixed angle of approach. A pilot will 
also often follow an equiangular 
trajectory when homing toward an 
airport. 
Strictly speaking, if the climbing and 
flying ants, the sea captain, and the 
pilot followed a true equiangular spiral, 
they would never reach their destina- 
tions. Destinations sought by such a 
course are called asymptotic poles; 
they can be approached but never 
reached. 
Among the special properties of 
the equiangular spiral is the fact that 
the radii increase exponentially in 
length as the curve moves away from 
the centre, It was the Swiss mathema- 
tician Jacob Bernoulli who demon- 
strated in 1698 that the logarithm of 
the radius is proportional to the angle 
of rotation.

Because of its logarithmic character, TURRIS BARES 
the equiangular spiral is also called 
the logarithmic spiral. In his investiga- 
tion of this spiral Bernoulli noted 
that if any part of the curve is en- 
larged, thereby tending to flatten it, 
the segment will exactly match some 
other part of the same spiral. 
This invariant property so impressed 
him that he ordered that his tomb- ett 
stone be inscribed with a logarithmic 
spiral and the motto “although changed 
| always come back the same”, The 
stonecutter got the motto right but 
unfortunately chiselled an Archimedes 
spiral by mistake. 
  
The equiangular spiral expands 
rapidly with the rotation of the figure. 
With its swirling arm and exponentially 
expanding radius, it seems a more 
dynamic form than the plodding, slowly 
changing Archimedes spiral. 
There are many examples of equi- 
angular spirals in nature: the web of 
the spider Epeira, the scales of the 
pine cone, the florets of the daisy 
and the giant sunflower, the shoots 
of flowering cymose plants, the struc- 
ture of hurricanes. 
Perhaps the most nearly perfect 
equiangular spiral to be found is the 
shell of the chambered nautilus. The 
chambers of this mollusc shell grow

SPIRALLING FLOWERS 
CITIES AND HERDS 
From pine-cones to cauliflowers, from pineapples to 
sunflowers, the seeds, petals and leaves of the plant 
world are often arranged in spiral form. This was per- 
ceptively observed by the famous Japanese painter 
Hokusai (1760-1849), as this flower painting shows 
(below). The plan of Auroville in India (left) shows how 
urban growth may take spiral form; its whorls are 
similar to those of Hokusai’s Japanese flower. Right, 
a herd of reindeer takes fright, turning in on itself in 
a tight spiral formation as it stampedes.

s in size in a geometric progression; 
the curve cuts the radius vector at 
an angle of 85 degrees. The shell 
grows larger within a fixed form, that 
is, it grows without a change in mor- 
phology. Given these conditions, the 
only shape it can take is a spiral. 
As with all true equiangular spirals, 
a magnified view of a horizontal 
section through the pole, or centre, 
looks identical to the whole curve. 
The nautilus shell grows at one end 
only and in this respect it resembles 
the horns of the rhinoceros or moun- 
tain goat, which also have some spiral 
character. 
Tiny marine organisms called for- 
aminfera, which inhabit all marine 
waters, also have shells shaped like 
crude equiangular spirals. In fossil- 
ized form, these shells make up the 
material of chalk cliffs and much of 
the coze on the ocean bottom. 
Some foraminfera shells turn clock- 
ART, LIKE NATURE, has adopted the 
spiral as the form which lends itself most 
readily to regular and simultaneous expan- 
sion in length and width and also height 
in forms evolving around a central point. 
One example is the helicoidal form of this 
17th-century portrayal of the tower of 
Babel (opposite page), rising upwards like 
the shell of the fossilized gasteropod (left), 
whose whorls coil around a hollow axis. 
wise, others turn counterclockwise, 
from the apex of the shell. The 
direction of rotation depends on the 
temperature of the water at the time 
of the shell's growth. 
By studying the ratio of clockwise 
to counterclockwise shells in ocean 
bottoms, it is possible to ascertain the 
relative temperatures that probably 
pertained during the Ice Age some 
600,000 to 1,000,000 years ago, when 
these shells originally grew. 
Geologists have utilized the direc- 
tion of coiling of foraminfera shells in 
petroleum exploration to make stratifi- 
cation correlations between various oil 
wells and determine whether they are 
part of the same bed. 
How spiral growth commences is 
something of a mystery. In all em- 
bryonic structures, cells are ordin- 
arily laid down radially in the first 
few cleavages. The spiral character of 
spiral organisms is visible after the 
third cleavage, when 23 or eight cells 
have been formed. The spiraling 
characteristic is apparently a property 
of the original starting cell. 
In that connexion, it is of interest 
that the majority of identical twins 
have hair whorls that turn in opposite 
directions and the same pairs of 
identical twins that have that form of

In his painting “Dialectic” (detail 
shown here), the Italian Renalssance 
artist Paolo Veronese depicts the 
Greek myth of Arachne the weaver, 
who enraged the goddess Athena 
and was changed into a spider. In 
spinning their webs, spiders follow 
a spiral movement (see “Unesco 
Courier”, December 1969). This fact 
escaped Veronese, who incorrectly 
showed a web consisting of parallel 
polygons, 
mirror imagery also often exhibit 
differences in right- and left-handed- 
ness and reversed dental asymmetry. 
The grandest of all spirals are the 
spiral galaxies, which measure thou- 
sands of light years in diameter. They 
are clusters of stars in the form of 
multi-armed crude equiangular spirals 
with centres at a common pole. About 
50 per cent of all galaxies are spirals. 
The form of the majority of these is 
the same; they are double 73 degree, 
equiangular spirals. 
Our own galaxy, usually called the 
Milky Way galaxy, is a spiral. The 
earth is about 25,000 light years, or 
approximately halfway, from the centre, 
and, along with neighbouring stars, 
rotates around it at the rate of about 
150 miles per second. 
It was once thought that a spiral 
galaxy was like a rotating pinwheel 
firecracker with stars being thrown out 
from the centre. Recent observations 
show this interpretation to be incorrect, 
although at present astrophysicists 
are generally at a loss to explain the 
origin of spiral galaxies. 
Such is not the case with the spiral 
form of hurricanes, which can be clear- 
ly seen in aerial photographs. Warm 
moist air rising in the storm system 
and subject to the earth's rotation 
produces a vortex motion, which cre- 
ates the spiral cloud formation. The 
rotation of the vortex of a hurricane 
is clockwise in the southern hemi- 
sphere and counterclockwise in the 
northern hemisphere. 
Counter spirals, those whose direc- 
tion has been reversed, appear in the 
seed patterns of many plants. The 
florets of the daisy and the sunflower 
are arranged along sets of intersecting 
equiangular spirals, one of which 
rotates clockwise, the other counter- 
clockwise, from the plant's head. 
The florets increase in age, and 
hence in size, as the curves move 
out from the centre. In the daisy 
there are 21 clockwise spirals and 34 
counterclockwise ones. In the giant 
sunflower there are usually 34 clock- 
wise and 55 counterclockwise spirals, 
but the largest of these flowers may 
contain 89 clockwise and 144 counter- 
clockwise spirals. 
The seeds of the pine cone and of 
the pineapple are likewise laid down 
as spirals; five clockwise and eight 
counterclockwise in the pine cone; 
eight clockwise and thirteen counter- 
clockwise in the pineapple. 
The numbers of spirals in these 
plants are successive terms of a 
series called the Fibonacci sequence, 
named for the twelfth-century Italian 
mathematician credited with devising 
it. The Fibonacci series is 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 
8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144 and so forth, 
each number being the sum of the 
two previous numbers. 
So far, we have described spirals 
.in terms of how the length of the 
radius vector, or the distance from 
the centre, changes with the angle of 
turning. Spirals can be equally well 
defined in terms of the manner in 
which the amount of curvature changes 
as one moves along the figure, 
Thus, in an equiangular spiral, an 
arc along the curve tends to flatten 
out as one moves away from the 
centre. In the circle, of course, an 
arc taken anywhere along the figure 
has the same amount of curvature as 
any other arc. 
There is yet another kind of spiral, 
called a clothoid, from the Greek word 
for spin, which has two poles, or 
centres, and two arms that curve in 
reversed directions. In this figure, the 
curvature becomes tighter the farther 
one moves from a point midway bet- 
ween the poles. Each arm of the 
clothoid, known also as Euler's spiral 
for the Swiss mathematician who dis- 
covered it in 1744, resembles the 
mainspring of a watch whose torque 
on a shaft remains constant regardless 
of how tightly the spring is wound. 
Many individuals have hair that 
curves in the form of one arm of a 
clothoid. Hair like that is flatter in 
cross section than straight hair. Micro- 
scopic examination shows that one side 
of such hair expands more with 
moisture than the other side. The 
expansion of the moisture-sensitive 
side forces hair to curl over. Develop- 
ing ferns similarly often take on the 
appearance of a clothoid arm due to 
the unequal growth rate of the cells 
at the tip of the plant. 
In pondering on spirals, can we 
find an underlying generality to 
account for their existence from atoms 
to galaxies? The most we can safely 
say without blundering into anthropo- 
morphic or teleological philosophizing 
is that wherever there is outward 
growth, or a radial force, combined 
with rotation,”a spiral is created. NW

### IGNORE

Carved and painted in 1867, this 
tombstone at Bogojevic (Yugoslavia) 
depicts a villager, Uros Simeunovic, 
holding his son by the hand and his 
horse by the reins. Everyday objects, 
ornaments, animals and birds are 
often portrayed alongside human 
figures in this Serbian gravestone 
art (see also back cover).

T.- Southern Slavs are 
known to have practised a funerary 
art in the days when as nomads they 
first came to the Balkans and began 
peopling regions which bore the stamp 
of a strong Hellenistic influence and 
of Roman occupation. Traces of this 
art have survived in the form of carved 
and decorated wooden tombs, a few 
of which can still be seen in the 
Belgrade Ethnographical Museum. 
Then, in the course of time, stone 
was substituted for wood. Perhaps 
the transformation of a nomadic civi- 
lization into a sedentary one imposed 
the choice of stone because of its 
permanent quality. Or perhaps it 
followed naturally from contact with 
builders and hewers of stone. Stone 
was already dominant in the 14th and 
15th centuries, especially in Bosnia, 
with its funeral monuments of the 
Bogomil religious sect, and to a lesser 
extent in Serbia. These gravestones 
were sculpted and in most cases in- 
cluded a representation of the human 
figure. 
Whatever the case may be, the 
beginning of the 19th century saw a 
sudden and remarkable development 
of a specific tombstone art, which 
flourished and reached its peak during 
that century. It was still in evidence 
at the beginning of the 20th century,

POSTHUMOUS 
PORTRAITS 
An unusual form of popular art—the carving 
and decoration of tombstones—grew up 
and flourished in central Serbia during the 
19th century. The artists depicted human 
figures with surprising realism and a sharp 
eye for detail as these examples show. 
(1) Soldier from the village of Mrcajevci, 
carrying a pistol thrust through his belt 
(2) Young woman of Tresnjevica, wearing 
earrings and a flowered headdress. (5) Old 
lady of Pogled carrying her gloves and 
umbrella. (3) Traces of paint that survive 
show how it was used to accentuate such 
details as the moustache and eyebrows of 
this soldier. (4) Rain and wind have effac- 
ed all traces of paint from this head, giv- 
ing its features an expression of power 
and serenity.

TOMBSTONE ART (Continued from page 17) 
‘but apart from a few exceptions, it 
has virtually disappeared today. 
Originating in central Serbia, this 
form of art is mainly concentrated in 
the Sumadija region south of Belgrade, 
where the towns of Kragujevac, Cacak, 
Ivanica and Titovo Uzice are situated. 
Its emergence was not an isolated 
phenomenon, and it is not confined to 
a few scattered places. The art was 
practised in all the villages and small 
towns of Sumadija and sometimes 
beyond the bounds of that artistically 
well-endowed region. It consisted 
essentially of representing the dead 
and perpetuating their memory by 
detailing who and what they were and 
what they did in carved and painted 
stone. 
Here we see everyday people, the 
objects they used, the emblems of 
their craft or profession, and very 
often to one side of the slab, a tree 
of life ending in a flourish of leaves 
. pecked by a dove, representing the 
. dead person's soul. 
The mere depiction of a person's 
life, however, sometimes takes second 
place to portrayal of character. A 
coquettish woman gives you a flirta- 
tious glance; a pessimist with down- 
turned mouth evokes eternal dis- 
appointment; elsewhere the radiance 
of contemplation and the inner life is 
suggested by lowered eyes. And 
everywhere there are soldiers, single 
or in groups, frozen to eternal atten- 
tion, witnesses to lost battles and 
vanquished illusions. 
A whole motionless world of people 
"is represented, for whom the salvation 
20 
of the sou! or the satisfaction of bodily 
desires are cares of the past. 
The originality of this art is beyond 
question, and its variety amazing. It 
is obviously related to an authentic 
popular peasant art, and an attentive 
and curious mind could today form an 
idea of the evolution of Serbian society 
from peasant to urban life, using 
only these gravestones as a guide. 
What explains the extraordinary and 
unexpected quality of what one would 
a priori be tempted to consider a minor 
art? The answer is that these artists 
are true masters, and that their work 
shows great originality and spontaneity. 
It contains a real emotional element 
which, though sometimes subtly 
restrained, is invariably present, and is 
often humorous. 
This should really come as no sur- 
prise, for the Serbian people have 
always felt an innate need both to 
endure and to express their desire 
for permanence. Even in a peasant 
society with extremely limited possi- 
bilities the gifted found a natural outlet 
for their creative talent in this humble 
form of painted sculpture rooted in 
the earth and the customs of daily life. 
This is the explanation of its richness 
and variety. 
However, the development of urban 
civilization changed the sources of 
inspiration of these artists, whose 
vocational talent was gradually super- 
seded by purely professional skill. The 
very few craftsmen who still cut these 
tombstones today possess neither the 
technical mastery, nor the freshness 
of inspiration, nor the spontaneity of 
execution of the old masters. 
Most of these tombstones were 
worked in bas-relief and in some cases 
there is no more than a simple outline 
cut into the stone, with no relief at 
all. Some were sculpted in the round, 
but these are extremely rare. 
It is highly probable that at first the 
sculptors used white marble from the 
quarries of Studenica, whose stone- 
cutters had been famous throughout 
the country from time immemorial. 
Although close examination reveals a 
few traces of paint on these marble 
tombstones, the very fine grain of the 
marble prevented colour from holding 
firmly. 
Later on a highly porous stone was 
used which was a conglomerate of 
very fine particles; this had the advan- 
tage of being more easily worked than 
marble and of absorbing the paint, 
thus preserving the colours. In other 
cases the porous stone has an overlay 
of finer porosity which acted as a 
support for the colour. 
Some tombstones are engraved with 
phrases and maxims describing how 
the person died or his or her quirks of 
character. Here are some examples: 
—"Alas! | am like a drooping flower 
which has bloomed too soon and 
withered fast, like a rose in the 
burning sun.” 
—"“Far from home,. the flowers of 
Serbia will never bloom upon my 
grave. Tell my loved ones that | 
shall never more return.” 
—"“He died against his will, struck 
down by the hand of the guard in 
the presence of the authorities.” 
(This is an elliptical way of saying 
that he was executed.) 
—“Come closer, beloved brother and 
traveller, | have nothing against you. 
See where my youth is laid to rest.” 
—"“Here in calm repose lies Kruna, 
first wife of Ljubomir Tadic. She 
was weary and wanted rest. May 
she forgive us for having sinned. 
Her bereaved husband Ljubomir and 
his second wife Ljubovanka.” 
—“Here | lie at rest while you look 
at me. | wish you were in my place 
and | could be looking at you.” 
These gravestones give no impres- 
sion of despair, but rather a certain 
melancholy, great serenity, resigned 
acceptance of a fate which was some- 
times unjust, a simple philosophy of 
life and a sense of humour. 
In their turn the works are slowly 
dying under the assault of wind and 
‘weather, time and neglect. n

1. goes without saying that 
urbanism can have some influence on 
the development of new and expanding 
cities. lt can reconcile the imperatives 
of growth with the need to insert 
buildings elegantly and rationally into 
the environment. 
In great old cities this is not the 
case. They took shape slowly and 
often capriciously in the course of 
centuries, and in most of them— 
especially in their “historic centres” —
only limited changes and sanitary 
improvements are possible. 
In these cities, everything flows 
towards and converges on a densely 
populated centre, where there is heavy 
traffic, office buildings predominate,

and the vestiges of the past have 
accumulated. Here dwellings are 
overcrowded and dilapidated. At the 
heart of old cities there are often 
vast insalubrious areas where city 
planners come up against a great 
many largely insoluble problems. 
We must renovate our surroundings 
and adapt them to the future. But at 
the same time there is nothing we 
can do with these city centres where 
for centuries life has gone on in a 
concentrated welter of activity, creat- 
ing a situation of virtually inextricable 
complexity. Experts’ dreams of re- 
creating these city centres or of 
infusing new life into them can only 
come true in the unlikely event of a 
cataclysm, 
In Paris this cataclysm has happened 
and the urbanists’ dreams have come 
true, Of course, the vast redevelop- 
ment operation now going on in the 
heart of the city is exceptional. But 
it is also instructive and fit to serve 
as a model. Not surprisingly it is 
attracting international interest. An

additional and stronger reason for this 
is that the French architects and 
urbanists engaged on the project are, 
in accordance with the wishes of the 
authorities, working closely with 
experts from other countries. 
This bold. enterprise is underway 
virtually at the geometric centre of 
Paris, in the quarter which for cen- 
turies contained Paris's great central 
markets—Les Halles Centrales— 
among streets which formed part of 
the great road, dating from the early 
Middle Ages, which led from Flanders 
to the Mediterranean and crossed 
Paris from north to south. Later, 
another great highway led from the 
Marais quarter in the east, the centre 
of Paris at the time of the Valois kings, 
to the wooded suburbs in the west. 
At the intersection of these two great 
roads, Les Halles were built. 
In the course of time the quarter 
became cluttered and dilapidated 
through the volume of traffic which 
met there. This deterioration took 
place in two separate areas which 
circumstances have now combined to 
join together. 
To the west of the north-south axis 
lay the Halles, with their bustling 
nocturnal activity, their convoys of 
lorries bringing loads of produce in 
from the countryside, and their great 
piles of refuse. The great French 
novelist Emile Zola was inspired to 
name one of his novels after this 
teeming quarter, which he called “Le 
ventre de Paris"—the belly of Paris. 
To the east is one of the oldest 
quarters in the city, known as Beau- 
bourg because it was once a suburb 
(“faubourg™) called beautiful (“beau”) 
because of the allure of the ladies who 
lived in it. From the end of the Middle 
Ages, when the great Lombard finan- 
ciers did business there, until the time 
_of the Scottish financier John Law 
and his spectacular bankruptcy in the 
18th century, the neighbourhood was 
a great banking district. Then it de- 
teriorated and in time became the most 
decrepit and noisome part of Paris. 
Photo Centre Beaubourg, Paris 
About 40 years ago, the narrow 
alleys of Beaubourg had become 
sordid slums. Its tottering buildings 
were condemned and razed to the 
ground. The resulting big patch of 
waste ground soon fell into the tenta- 
cular clutches of Les Halles, for which 
it became a much-needed parking lot. 
And this is how it would have stayed 
had not the Halles themselves, too 
sprawling and too inadequate for their 
task, been condemned after the 
Second World War. 
On 4 and 5 March, 1969, there took 
place what has been called Paris's 
removal operation of the century. The 
markets left the famous metal pavilions 
built by the architect Baltard during 
the Second Empire and moved out to 
the suburbs. In this way, they returned 
to their original extra-mural state, for 
back in the 12th century their site lay 
outside the city walls. 
This colossal transfer freed 15 hec- 
tares of land, ten of them where the 
Halles had been, five at Beaubourg. 
This was the golden opportunity for 
the urbanists; now they could, not so 
much improve, as recreate entirely the 
centre of a great city. 
Of course, plans to fill these empty 
spaces with massive buildings soon 
began to appear in a steady stream. 
It was proposed to install ministries on 
them, or to make them the site of the 
University of Paris. But this would 
have meant that one problem would 
have been replaced by another. In- 
stead of congestion at night there 
would have been even worse con- 
gestion by day. lt was at this point, 
fortunately, that other ideas prevailed. 
Why, it was asked, not turn these 
15 hectares into an oasis in the heart 
of the city, a resting place from the 
daily. turmoil? And why not restore 
to each site its own autonomous 
personality? Why not create a com- 
. mercial centre—thus respecting one 
of the quarter's traditional activities— 
and a leisure centre on the site of 
the Halles?

Why not turn the Beaubourg site 
into a cultural meeting place, espe- 
cially by transferring to it Paris's 
modern art museums? 
A fundamental stipulation of this 
project was that the ground level of 
each area should be a pedestrian 
precinct where people will be able to 
stroll at their ease. 
Work on this vast project has been 
going on for some time, and immense 
gaping craters have been excavated 
on each site. So vast and deep are 
they that scenes for a film were shot 
in ohe of them during a halt in the 
work. 
The operation is instructive for 
several reasons, and the way in which 
the architects have solved the prob- 
lems facing them is particularly 
admirable. 
The redevelopment of the larger site, 
the former Halles, will be a long job. 
If everything goes according to plan, 
work will be completed by 1982 or 
1983. There will be several buildings 
above the surface, and also an ex-

FROM CAR PARK 
TO PALACE 
OF CULTURE 
A great cultural centre Is to rise 
in the heart of Paris on the Place 
Beaubourg, for many years used as a 
car park (1). In the words of its director, 
Robert Bordaz, the Beaubourg Centre 
“will bring to the public the living and 
immediate image of art in process of 
creation”. Architect's model (3) re- 
veals the original features of the 
metal-ribbed structure with its immense 
glass windows. Visitors will move 
from floor to floor on escalators (2 
and 4) set in transparent tubes and 
attached to the facade so as to leave 
the maximum of free space within 
the building itself. 
traordinary five-storey underground 
structure, extending 25 metres below 
ground level and covering 50,000 
square metres in the form of a hol- 
lowed-out inverted pyramid. This is 
the “forum”, which will be an area to 
walk and relax in. It will have shops, 
restaurants and cinemas, and the 
whole area will be open to daylight 
through a set of terraces. 
Another feature of the project will 
endow the commercial centre and the 
forum with a unique and delightful 
atmosphere. There will be almost five 
hectares of park around them: a riot 
of vegetation and trees. 
The English landscape architect 
Russell Page, who is preparing the 
plans for this park, wants it to be 
planted not only with traditional city 
trees, such as chestnuts and limes, but 
with exotic ones, such as cedars from 
the Himalayas, maples from Canada, 
tulip trees from Virginia, and rowans 
from Tibet, so that passersby can 
look at trees in bloom all the year 
round. In addition—wonder of won- 
ders in Paris—there will also be lawns, 
where in fine weather people will be 
allowed to walk or lie down, a stream, 
and ponds at ground level where they 
will be free to take a paddle. 
One of these tree-lined walks (as 
well as underground corridors for 
those who want to avoid the traffic 
in the streets above) will lead to the 
other area being developed, where 
the visitor will be in a totally different 
world. Here, if there is any commerce 
at all, it will be a commerce in new 
ideas and new inventions in art and 
culture. Here, in 1976 the Beaubourg 
Centre will open its doors, under the 
direction of M. Robert Bordaz, 
former director-general of the French 
national radio and television network. 
It will be a remarkable building: resem- 
bling a kind of light, transparent, lumi- 
nous ship—a ship whose superstruc- 
ture is now rising from the earth. 
In the area is the Fountain of the 
Innocents, the work of the great 16th- 
century French sculptor Jean Goujon. 
It brings to mind the medieval charnel- 
house where, in the previous century, 
the great poet of France's highways 
and by-ways, Frangois Villon, would 
go and dream in front of a Danse 
Macabre painted on the walls. 
Also nearby was a cabaret which 
during the reign of Louis XIV was the 
meeting place of a corporation of 
dancing masters led by a man known 
as the King of the Violins. In 1661 
this corporation was awarded the pri- 
vilege of a title: the Royal Academy 
of Dance. Later it merged with the 
Royal Academy of Music. These were 
the beginnings of the Paris Opéra, 
which still has these titles today. 
In short, culture is no stranger here. 
(International culture too, since the 
story goes that Giovanni Boccaccio, 
the 13th-century Italian author of the 
Decameron, was born not far away.) 
President Georges Pompidou an- 
nounced the foundation of the Beau- 
bourg Centre in 1969, and after his 
death last April, it was decided that it 
should bear his name. In a speech 
made in 1972, President Pompidou

### 50404: Paris gets a new heart, a bold project is changing the appearance and cultural life of the French capital

4 expressed his feelings as follows: “I 
passionately want Paris to have a 
cultural centre which will be both a 
museum and a centre for creativity, a 
place where the plastic arts may take 
their place beside music, the cinema, 
books, and audiovisual research. And 
of course, creativity can only mean 
modern art, in constant evolution.” 
And so the original idea of a 
museum to which the state-owned 
. modern art collections should be 
24 
transferred and then enriched has 
broadened to embrace a whole concept 
of living culture. The building itself 
will be as spacious as a cathedral, 
but above all it will have the non-stop 
animation of life on board ship, as 
Renzo Piano, one of the architects in 
charge of the project, has pointed out. 
“The analogy with a ship is accurate 
in several respects: concerning the 
structure, concerning its scale, and 
above all concerning its relationship 
with a moving environment.” One 
cannot help thinking of the motto on 
Paris's coat of arms: ‘Fluctuat nec 
mergitur' (It floats and does not sink.) 
In 1970 a competition was held for 
this great development project. In 
order to stress the international charac- 
ter of the undertaking, it was thrown 
open to architects all over the world. 
This was unprecedented for such an 
operation in France. 681 sets of plans 
were submitted, 491 of them from 
countries other than France. 
An initial choice of 31 was made by 
the international jury, which included 
Oscar Niemeyer (Brazil) and Philip 
Johnson (U.S.A). The final choice 
was a project submitted by architects 
Renzo Piano and Gianfranco Franchini 
(Italy), and Richard Rogers (U.K.) 
assisted by engineering consultants of 
Ove Arup and Partners (UXK.). The 
project combined extreme technical 
audacity with purity and simplicity of 
ine. : 
As revealed by the mock-ups, the 
Beaubourg Centre will be an immense 
cage of light, 42 metres high, 60 metres 
wide, and 166 metres long. There will 
be five storeys, each with an area of 
7,500 square metres—"enough for two 
football pitches on each floor”, as the 
architects point out. There will be no 
partitions nor pillars, and all machinery 
—air conditioning, electricity, etc.—will . 
be at the top of the building. 
Thus each floor will be totally free. 
People will move between storeys on 
escalators covered by transparent 
screens. These escalators will be at 
the side of the building, and it will 
be an impressive experience to make 
this diagonal climb. On one side the 
visitor will be able to see what is 
going on inside the building; on the 
other, as he climbs, he will have 
Paris stretched out at his feet—from 
the towers of Notre-Dame, the Seine, 
and the dome of the Pantheon to the 
green countryside beyond. The visi- 
tor's first impression as he approaches 
the Beaubourg Centre will be this mov- 
ing tide of people, rising and falling. 
Inside the building, forming a 
counterpoint to this decor, there will 
be, first of all, the vast department 
of the plastic arts for which the Beau- 
bourg Centre was originally con- 
ceived. This will cover a considerable 
area, since it will house two institu- 
tions which already exist elsewhere in 
Paris: the Paris Museum of Modern 
Art, whose collections will take up 
three floors of the vast glass palace, 
and the National Centre of Contem- 
porary Art, which was created to 
promote avant-garde art. There will 
also be rooms for temporary exhibi- 
tions and an extensive documentation 
service, 
For the first five years, the Swedish 
museologist Pontus Hulten will be in 
charge of this department. In 1956 he 
created the Moderna Museet in 
Stockholm, and has since won a 
world-wide reputation for his depar- 
tures from the conventions of tradi- 
tional museum presentation—i.e., sim- 
ply exhibiting famous works and letting 
them speak for themselves—and for 
his conception of “art in movement”. 
For it is not enough simply to exhibit 
a picture or the entire work of artists 
such as Chirico, Picasso or Hartung. 
To understand art forms with which 
it is unfamiliar, the public needs to 
appreciate the techniques, the thinking 
and the feeling which go into their 
creation. To understand an artist's 
work, it is indispensable to have a

grasp, not only of the social and his- 
torical conditions in which he lived but 
of the total artistic context in which he 
worked—music, literature, and films, 
for example. Thus one might present 
a Cubist painting by Picasso, for 
example, by also showing an African 
mask against the background of a 
Spanish landscape, in an atmosphere 
created by readings of Apollinaire’s 
poems and the performance of music 
composed by Erik Satie for the Bal- 
lets Russes. “People must have the 
chance to be surprised”, says Pontus 
Hulten, “We must give them an oppor- 
- tunity to react, to accept or to reject.” 
Books, films, microfilms, recordings 
and manuscripts will be available in 
a Documentation Centre, where there 
will also be exhibition rooms and ex- 
perimental galleries. Artists will be 
able to work in studios forming part 
of the Centre. 
Another important section of the 
Beaubourg Centre will be an industrial 
design centre, concerned with every- 
thing—from objects to urbanism on a 
large scale—which contributes to the 
forming and- transforming of the 
environment. A computer-controlled 
filing system, extending over 2,000 
square metres, will answer questions 
put by experts and the public. Tem- 
porary exhibitions will be held, and 
there will be a retrospective gallery 
devoted to the historical development 
of industrial design, throughout the 
world. 
But culture also—and primarily— 
means reading. Thus the Beaubourg 
Centre will house a great and unique 
library, where it is planned to store 
no less than a million documents, to 
which visitors will have free and imme- 
diate access. This new-style library 
will specialize in current events and 
will be a kind of university without 
walls. It will also include a big chil- 
dren's section. It will be on three 
floors, extending over a total surface 
area of 15,000 square metres. 
The various forms of audiovisual 
activity will also have a prominent 
place at the Beaubourg Centre. First 
of all there will be a film museum, a 
cinémathéque, an offshoot of the world- 
famous Cinémathéque Francaise,

whose founder, Henri Langlois, will 
direct it. 
Up-to-date audiovisual equipment 
will be installed throughout the build- 
ing. It will include a closed-circuit 
television network capable of being 
linked to outside television channels, 
as well as recording studios, audition 
rooms, seven cinemas (with a seating 
capacity ranging from 40 to 800 per- 
sons), theatres, music rooms, and a 
television network, broadcasting pro- 
grammes throughout the Centre. There 
will also be film studios with editing 
rooms, and television studios where 
portable video equipment will be avail- 
able (see article on page 9). 
Another feature of this vast complex 
will be a “Mediathéque”, containing all 
the tools of modern mass communica- 
tions, from slides and printed matter 
to video-cassettes and video-discs, 
small format films and videotape 
recorders. 
A “Piazza” stretching over some 
10,000 square metres—the same area 
as the building itself—will be created 
in front of the main facade of the 
Beaubourg Centre. Here people will 
be able to relax, stroll, and play games. 
Improvised activities will take place 
around inflatable domes in this leafy, 
verdant setting. 
Across the Piazza will stand an 
important annex to/ the Centre, a five- 
storey building which will house an 
accoustical-musical research and co- 
ordination institute. This is sure to be 
one of the Centre's most interesting 
and attractive features. 
The institute is an entirely new idea. 
Directed by the famous French con- 
ductor and composer Pierre Boulez, 
it will be a laboratory for avant-garde 
music. In it composers and research- 
ers, working closely with specialists 
in accoustics and computer science, 
will carry out research into music and 
sound. Perhaps—who knows?—they 
may one day launch a revolution in 
music. The institute will not be for 
professionals only. There will be con- 
certs for the public, and visitors will 
also have the opportunity to come and 
see on television screens musicians 
and scientists at work in their studios. 
All this vast complex is now about 
to rise from the earth. But, on an 
outlying part of the site, one feature 
of the Beaubourg Centre can already 
be seen. This is the Saint Merri 
school, which takes its name from the 
patron saint of the fine church nearby. 
One of the first of its kind in a city, 
this school is dedicated to the idea 
of freedom of expression: there are 
no partitions, neither in the teaching 
areas nor in the teaching itself. During 
the day about 1,000 children will attend 
the school, and in the evening it will 
be open to adults. Six studios, direct- 
ed by experts, will provide facilities for 
modelling, cinema, Photography, video, 
and comic strips. 
it is estimated that up to 10,000 
people a day from all over the world 
will visit this vast complex now being 
built in the heart of Paris. 
The architectural concept of this 
“school without walls” reflects the 
determination of the Beaubourg Centre 
to break down the barriers within cul- 
ture itself. For the underlying con- 
ception of the Centre is that it shall 
not simply be a place where separate, 
autonomous activities go on. It is 
to be a place where the spirit of 
enquiry in its various forms can move 
freely from one centre of interest to 
another, a cross-roads where people 
and ideas can meet and interact. NW

DISMEMBERED 
  
WORKS OF ART 
. Reconstituting works of art which have been dismembered is a delicate 
operation, especially when the fragments have been widely dispersed 
and now belong to museums and collectors in different countries. 
It calls for a combination of historical research, detective work, 
diplomacy, goodwill, taste and cultural appreciation. This complex 
international problem is examined in an outstanding book just pub- 
26 
lished by Unesco: An [llustrated Inventory of Famous Dismembered 
Works of Art — European Painting (223 pages, 340 illustrations, 54 F.). 
Its publication marks an important step in Unesco’s efforts to encourage 
the reconstitution of dismantled works of art throughout the world, 
the salient features of which are described in the following article. 
by Selim Abdul Hak 
F-. time immemorial, 
war, invasion and conquest have led 
to the loss of countless works of art. 
Because of the values they symbolize, 
conquerors have set out to obliterate 
them, since the destruction of a 
nation's treasures or the relics of its 
past was one way of eroding or 
annihilating the personality of a 
vanquished people. 
Armed conflict is also responsible 
for the deplorable practice of removing 
works of art from the settings for 
which they had been created, dismem- 
bering them and transporting the 
fragments elsewhere for profit or 
enjoyment or for reasons of prestige. 
The ostentatiousness of famous 
people, the passion of art-lovers and 
the rich for collecting and the profit 
motive of art dealers have also 
contributed throughout the ages to the 
dismemberment of works of art. Even 
the owners of such works, unaware of

Moreover, artists have turned their 
hands to rectifying or transforming 
works of art regarded as out of date 
or immoral, and museum curators have 
often succumbed to the temptation to 
enrich their collections by acquiring 
fragments of dismembered works. 
It is, of course, some consolation 
to reflect that the dispersion of these 
fragments has helped to build up

La Goulue and Valentin le Désossé at the Moulin Rouge, painted in 
1895 by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec (1864-1901), was acquired by a 
collector who had no scruples about cutting it up and selling it in 
pieces to increase his profit. It was one of a series of paintings 
depicting two of the artist's favourite models, La Goulue (Louise 
Weber) and Valentin le Désossé (Jacques Renaudin), dancers who 
delighted revellers at the famous Moulin Rouge cabaret in Paris and 
  
  
  
other Montmartre haunts at the turn of the century. The painting 
was cut Into five pieces, and in the process Valentin le Désossé 
(Valentin the India-rubberman) lost a foot, his right hand, and two 
fingers of his left hand. In 1929 the painting was acquired by the 
French National Museums and painstakingly reassembled (opposite 
page). Today it hangs in the Louvre. Above centre, La Goulue

p promote a deeper knowledge of the 
  
arts and enriching the cultural life of 
the world as a whole. So there would 
be no point in re-examining the rights 
and wrongs of the historical events 
which led to such dismemberment nor 
in condemning too harshly the methods 
employed. Any attempt to do so could 
only impair international .under- 
standing. 
Although research on these prob- 
lems has not hitherto enabled many 
works of art to be reconstructed; it 
has at least produced a great deal of 
information about the nature, history 
and original form of masterpieces 
which have been fragmented and dis- 
persed. As a result, the value of 
these fragments has increased, since 
the fact that they form part of a well 
THE PRINCE 
WHO LOST 
HIS HEAD 
In 1924 the Louvre Mu- 
seum in Paris acquired 
a headless Sumerian 
statuette. According to 
. its inscription, it depict-

prince of Lagash, who 
had lived around 2100 
B.C. The mutilated sta- 
tuette had been found 
at Tello in Iraq, in a 
region where archaeo- 
logical sites have long 
been pillaged by loot- 
ers. In 1934 the head 
was located in a pri- 
vate collection, and in 
1947 it was bought by 
the New York Metro- 
politan Museum of Art. 
It has now been agreed

known original has given them a new 
and hitherto unsuspected worth. 
Co-operation between curators and 
restorers has enabled several Europ- 
ean countries to reconstitute dismem- 
bered works from fragments in their. 
own museums and private collections. 
Reconstitution is much more difficult 
when fragments of world famous works 
belong to two or more museums ‘in 
different countries, especially when 
each fragment is a masterpiece in itself 
and has over the years acquired a 
value of its own. In these cases, the 
problem can only be solved by co- 
operation between the countries con- 
cerned. 
At a meeting held in Unesco’s head- 
quarters in Paris, in 1966, specialists 
studied such problems as the exchange 
of works between museums, the re- 
constitution of dismembered works on 
a national and international basis, and 
the role of international organizations 
in this field. : 
The specialists considered that in 
most cases it would be a mistake to 
envisage the extremely costly oper- 
ation of attempting to reconstitute dis- 
membered architectural monuments 
from dispersed ornamental fragments. 
On the other hand, sculpture, painting 
and other decorative features forming 
part of these monuments should ob- 
viously be considered as having 
acquired independent status and be 
treated separately, an appropriate 
solution being sought in each case. 
As for the problem of reassembling 
dismembered paintings, sculpture, en- 
gravings, etc., the specialists consider 
that it should be dealt with through: - 
exchanges between museums. In their . 
view, every effort at reconstitution 
should take account of the same legal 
and psychological issues as are posed 
by exchanges. 
In response to an international in- 
quiry carried out by Unesco in 1967 
and 1968, 37 countries and three inter- 
governmental organizations stated 
their views on the problems of ex- 
changing objects and reconstituting 
dismembered works. 
Several countries felt that fragments 
of dispersed works should be as- 
sembled so that their reconstitution 
benefits the country which is the real 
owner, especially where such frag- 
ments either form part of an architec- 
tural monument or would complete a 
collection. 
This view was naturally opposed by 
those who had come by such frag- 
ments legally, Several countries tried 
to “cool down" the discussion by 
pressing for a more cautious approach. 
They proposed that exchanges should 
be made only on the basis of free 
consent, and that the problem should 
be solved by the parties concerned, 
and should never be considered as 
a simple act of restitution. 
The question of the counterpart to 
be provided was considered to be of 
vital importance. Since it raises legal 
and psychological issues, it should be 
settled by agreement between the 
parties involved. It is essential that 
objects to be exchanged should be of 
equal value, especially when these are 
unique objects of great worth. In this 
connexion, a system of national, re- 
gional or international arbitration might 
be of great assistance. 
Despite these reservations, the 
countries consulted were not opposed

No one knows what motivated the muti- 
lation of this work (right) by the Flemish 
painter Hans Memling (1433-1494) of 
Bathsheba, wife of King David and mother 
of Solomon, at her bath. The original 
upper left-hand corner of the painting 
(above), a half-length representation of 
King David showing his ring to a youth 
_who may be a messenger, was removed, 
possibly in the 17th century. It was 
replaced by an architectural perspective 
showing a man and a child standing on 
the gallery of a palace. Today, Mem- 
ling’s painting, incorporating this curious 
“improvement”, hangs in the Staatsgale- 
rie, Stuttgart (Fed. Germ. Rep.), while 
the fragment portraying King David, 
since rediscovered, is in the Chicago Art 
Institute, U.S.A,   
to the idea that the problem of recons- 
titution might be considered within the 
framework of new international regul- 
ations and solved by exchanges bet- 
ween museums, provided that the aim 
was to restore the true value of dis- 
membered works, and that all the 
necessary scientific, technical and 
administrative measures were taken. 
In 1968 Unesco organized a pilot 
exhibition of dismembered works at 
its Paris headquarters. Unesco’s pur- 
pose was to set an example, which it 
was hoped would stimulate thought on 
the subject and lead to the reconsti- 
tution of other dismembered works of 
art. The works displayed came from 
several museums. 
The Louvre Museum, in Paris, the 
Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, the Musée 
des Arts Décoratifs in Paris and the 
Museum of the Wawel Royal Castle 
in Cracow (Poland) lent Unesco three 
“works, two of which had been perma- 
nently reconstituted, while the third 
was reconstituted for the duration of 
the exhibition only.

### 50405: Dismembered works of art

  
This temporarily reconstituted work 
was the Persian carpet, known as the 
“Paris-Cracow” carpet, the two halves 
of which belong to the Musée des 
Arts Décoratifs in Paris and the Mu- 
seum of the Wawel Royal Castle in 
Cracow respectively. Thanks to 
Unesco, these two halves were put 
together again after being separated 
for a long period of time; and they were 
displayed first at Cracow, from 27 
April to 13 May 1968, and then at the 
pilot exhibition in Paris the following 
month. 
This carpet, the only one of its kind 
in the world, dates from the second 
quarter of the 16th century and is the 
work of the Tabriz school. It was 
intended to cover the steps of the altar 
of Cracow cathedral, but it was found 
to be too large, and was therefore cut 
in two. 
The temporary reconstitution of this 
carpet gave art historians an opport- 
unity to compare the two halves and 
make scientific studies. 
One of the two permanently recons- 
tituted works was the picture repre- 
senting “The Battle of Bergen (1665)", 
painted by Willem Van de Velde the 
der. 
In 1877, the Nederlandse Museum 
at The Hague purchased the right- 
hand part, and the left-hand part was 
acquired by the National Maritime 
Museum at Greenwich (Great Britain). 
After the exhibition, the Greenwich 
Museum generously offered its half of 
the picture to the Netherlands, thus 
enabling the work to be reconstituted 
in its original form. 
The other reconstituted work on 
display was a polyptych by Paolo Vene- 
ziano. Dismembered after the disper- 
sion of the Campana collection, it has 
been completely reassembled and 
since 1956 has been in the collection 
of the Louvre Museum, in Paris. 
To provide material for systematic 
exchanges of information and docu- 
mentation of dismembered works in the 
various arts, Unesco decided in 1969 
to prepare an inventory of major works 
that have been fragmented or dis- 
persed. Since the dismemberment of 
works of art is a prominent feature of 
the history of European painting, it 
was decided to begin with an inven- 
tory of European works of art, and par- 
ticularly of paintings from the Renais- 
sance to the present time. Inventories 
covering other cultural regions of the 
world will follow. 
Unesco has just published this first 
inventory, which is entitled An Illus- 
trated Inventory of Famous Dismemb- 
ered Works of Art—European Painting. 
It contains chapters on dismembered 
works of Italian, Flemish, French, 
Spanish, Russian and German painting. 
One special chapter deals with Euro- 
pean illuminated manuscripts, another 
with French dismembered tombs. 
This illustrated inventory presents a 
disconcerting picture of the disfigure- 
ments and dismemberment inflicted on 
works of art by irresponsible hands. 
Works by such great masters as Giotto, 
Simone Martini, Masaccio, Paolo 
Uccello, Andrea Mantegna, Roger Van 
der Weyden, Hans Memling, Pieter 
Bruegel, Hans Holbein the Elder, Al- 
brecht Durer, Peter Paul Rubens, 
Anthony Van Dyck, El Greco, Fran- 
cisco de Zurbaran, Juan de Valdes 
Leal, Nicolas Poussin, Jean-Francois 
Millet, Henri de Toulouse-lLautrec and 
many others have paid a heavy price 
for this deliberate vandalism. 
One example is Paolo Uccello's 
three great pictures of the Florentine 
victory over the Sienese at the battle 
of San Romano in 1433, which, with 
three other pictures, once formed part 
of the decoration of Lorenzo the Magni- 
ficent’s chamber in the Medici Palace, 
Florence. 
In the 16th century, the panels were 
transferred to another part of the 
palace, and were then lost without 
trace until the 18th century. The 
panel representing “The Unhorsing of 
Bernardino della Garda” was bought 
sometime between 1769 and 1784 by 
the Uffizi Gallery, Florence, where it 
still hangs today, while the other two 
were discovered in a private collec- 
tion In the 19th century. The one 
showing “Micheletto da Cotignala 
Counter-Attacking” was acquired by 
the Campana Collection and today 
hangs in the Louvre, while “Niccolo 
da Tolentino Leading the Attack” has 
belonged to the National Gallery, Lon- 
don, since 1857. 
The fate of the triptych of the An- 
nunciation, painted by an unknown 
fifteenth-century master for the cathe- 
dral of Saint-Sauveur, Aix-en-Provence 
(France) has been equally tragic. After 
the French Revolution, the central part 
depicting “The Virgin and the Angel”, 
was transferred to the church of the 
Madeleine in Aix. 
The two side-panels passed through 
several hands. The right-hand one, 
showing “The Prophet Jeremiah in a 
Niche”, was acquired in 1923 by the 
Royal Fine Arts Museum in Brussels, 
while the left-hand panel was cut into . 
two. One part of it, depicting “The 
Prophet Isaiah in a Niche”, is now 
in the Van Beuningen museum in the 
Netherlands. The other part, which 
shows books and objects painted in 
trompe-I'aeil, was acquired by the 
Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, and is at 
present on loan to the Louvre. 
A series of great paintings which 
once formed a unity is “Christ and the 
12 Apostles”, by Van Dyck. No one 
knows where these pictures were ori- 
ginally hung. However, in the early 
18th century, the central painting of the 
group—a half-length representation of 
Christ holding the Cross in his right 
hand—was 
Genoa, where it still hangs. 
The 12 apostles were detached—no 
one knows when—and disappeared 
until they were discovered around 1914 
by a Munich art dealér, who sold them 
separately. Today the whereabouts of 
only six of them is known—they are 
in museums in the US.A. (Sarasota, 
Florida), Hungary (Budapest), German 
Fed. Rep. (one in Hanover and two in 
Essen), and Austria (Vienna). 
Among Spanish works of art which 
have suffered dismemberments igs an 
altarpiece, painted by Francisco de 
Zurbaran at the height of his powers, 
which hung in the Monastery of St. 
Joseph of the Order of Discalced Mer- 
cedarians in Seville. 
The paintings which formed part of 
this magnificent group had a curious 
fate. The group was broken up twice, 
once in 1810 and once in 1835. Today 
paintings from it hang in the Seville 
Museum, the Louvre, Chartres Mu- 
seum (France) and others belong to 
the heirs of Marshal Soult, the Valdes 
collection (Bilbao), the Munt Gallery 
(New York), the Hamilton Collection 
(New York) and the heirs of the Mar- 
quis de Valdeterrazo (Madrid). 
The fate of the Trés Belles Heures 
de Notre-Dame du Duc Jean de Berry, 
was no less tragic. Written around 
in the Palazzo Rosso,

It is appalling to think that many 
fragments of these and other works 
of art have disappeared without trace 
and are lost forever. However, the 
situation is not entirely gloomy, and it 
is encouraging to note that some spec- 
tacular reconstitutions have been 
made. 
The figures which formed part of 
the altarpiece of the Last Judgment, 
painted by the 15th-century artist Ste- 
phan Lochner for the parish church of 
St. Lawrence in Cologne, were dis- 
persed in Frankfurt, Cologne and Mu- 
nich, and finally reconstituted in their 
original form in 1936 for the Lochner 
Exhibition, held at the Wallraf Richartz 
Museum, in Cologne. 
Under the Treaty of Versailles (1919), 
the side-panels of the Holy Lamb 
polyptych, painted by Van Eyck for 
were returned to 
Belgium. They had belonged to the 
collection of Frederic William Ill of 
Prussia, who had presented them to 
the Museum of Berlin. In 1923, the 
Belgian government returned to the 
cathedral the panels of the same po- 
lyptych, which depicted Adam and Eve 
and which had been exhibited in the 
Royal Fine Arts Museum in Brussels. 
Thus this magnificent polyptych has 
been reconstituted in the Vydt Chapel 
of Ghent cathedral. 
Two vast oil paintings by Toulouse- 
Lautrec, La Goulue and Valentin le 
Désossé at the Moulin Rouge and La 
Goulue Dancing an Egyptian Dance in 
her Shack were bought by a private 
collector who in 1926 cut them into 
ten pieces of various sizes. 
Fortunately, the French National Mu- 
seums were able to trace the paintings 
from photographs taken before they 
were dismembered, and skilfully to

Joseph. Louvre 
Museum, Paris,  
Of all the famous artists whose works have been dismembered down the centuries, 
perhaps the Spanish painter Francisco de Zurbaran (1598-1664) has suffered most. 
Between 1628 and 1640, when the great religious orders were commissioning 
paintings to illustrate their history, Zurbaran executed a large number of works 
of remarkable quality. Among them was the prodigious group of pictures he 
painted for the Monastery of St. Joseph of the Order of Discalced Mercedarians, 
in Seville. They were completely dispersed as a result of the secularization laws 
promulgated by the government of Joseph Bonaparte in 1810, However, at least 
one good thing has come out of this misfortune: in the 18th century Zurbaran 
was virtually unknown outside Spain, and the dispersion of his works, today 
displayed in museums from Aix-la-Chapelle to Boston, from Genoa to London, from 
Barcelona to Leningrad and Paris, has brought him world-wide renown. On these 
pages we show some of the works which Zurbaran painted for the Monastery 
of St. Joseph in Seville and indicate where they hang today. The exact number 
of pictures decorating the monastery is unknown, but Zurbaran's paintings of 
the martyrs alone numbered about fifty, some of which have disappeared.

ed and the fashion in which they were 
restored to their original condition. 
Finally, recent work by the Museums 
of Moscow, Leningrad and Kiev on 
the reconstitution of Russian works of 
art has shown that such operations are 
always worthwhile and give good 
results, even when the main elements 
of the work are missing. The way in 
which two 15th-century works—the 
royal doors of the school of Tver and 
the iconostasis of the Novgorod school 
—have been reconstituted is truly 
remarkable. 
The adoption by the General Con- 
ference of Unesco, in November 1970, 
of the Convention on the Means of 
Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit 
Import, Export and Transfer of Owner- 
ship of Cultural Property marks a dis- 
tinct advance in the international com- 
munity’s efforts to guarantee every 
nation the possession of works that 
are representative of its genius or that 
have been created within its borders. 
Contracting States, recognizing that 
international co-operation is one of the 
most effective means of protecting 
such property against the dangers that 
result from the illicit practices which 
threaten it, undertake to oppose such 
practices by removing their causes and 
helping to make the necessary repar- 
ations. 
The 1970 Unesco Convention states 
that nothing shall prevent contracting 
states from concluding special arrange- 
ments among themselves or from con- 
tinuing to implement agreements 
already concluded regarding the resti- 
tution of cultural property removed, 
whatever the reason, from its territory 
of origin, before the entry into force of 
the Convention. The party in whose 
favour a work was reconstituted should 
in principle give in return something 
of scientific or artistic value equal to 
that of the fragments which it receives. 
The way is open to various arrange- 
ments which, while ensuring that the 
interests of the parties concerned are 
respected, may provide various valid 
solutions for the reconstitution of 
works of art—exhibitions, long-term 
loans, alternating possession for a 
given period, or the permanent taking 
over of a work of art. 
Recently, the Metropolitan Museum 
of New York and the Direction des 
Musées de France jointly purchased a 
12th-century comb, and decided to take 
five-year turns in holding it. This is 
an example of the way in which com- 
mon ownership can promote the inter- 
national enjoyment of a work of art. 
Through this kind of arrangement, a 
work of art may belong to two or more 
institutions, each of which takes turns 
to exhibit it. 
Working along these lines, it may 
be possible to reassemble certain dis- 
membered works of art or groups 
which have been dispersed. If recons- 
tituted they would recover their full 
impact. |

### 50401: The Video revolution: portable videotape equipment now permits people all over the world to master the art of television instead of being passively exposed to it

THE VIDEO REVOLUTION (continued from page 11) 
American groups see video as a 
tool for direct political action in the 
street or for the analysis of the way 
people behave on the public highway, 
for instance recording the attitude of 
the police towards demonstrators—film 
can be erased by being exposed to 
the light, but videotape can be wiped 
. clean only by means of electronic 
32 
equipment. 
They may also use it for filming a 
television crew making a report, thus 
showing how it chooses and organizes 
the elements of reality, or even to 
reveal a teacher objecting to his 
lesson being filmed by his students. 
All these are typical cases of the 
image as action: the fact that those 
watching are watched in their turn 
leads them to modify their behaviour. 
Far from considering these attempts 
as games played by the pampered 
children of the rich countries, some of 
the developing countries are seeking 
to explore the possibilities which might 
be open to them. 
The Canadian assistance pro- 
gramme, after its successful experi- 
ence in Quebec, is conducting video 
campaigns in the south of Tunisia on 
the development of simple visual forms 
for the teaching of new farming 
techniques. 
In Bangladesh, a team from the 
Global Village of New York attempted 
in 1972-73, by showing in villages 
videorecordings made in other vil- 
lages, to change the attitudes of 
isolated and closed communities 
towards all form of evolution, particul- 
arly birth control and new crop 
techniques (“We can change if others 
like us accept change too."). 
| N Tanzania, the programme 
TY 16 (Tanzania Year 16), benefiting 
from Canadian and Scandinavian sup- 
port, led to the launching between 1971 
and 1973 of a programme of “perma- 
nent protest” via video aimed at spurr- 
ing on the building of Ujamaa com- 
munity villages. 
Video makes it possible to pinpoint 
conflicts with the authorities and to 
locate bureaucratic bottlenecks. The 
Tanzanian group, in the course of 
successively recorded discussions, 
thoroughly investigated the problems 
of collectivization (“Is the land of the 
ancestors to become everyone's 
land?”). Video analyzes the pro- 
blems, records the remarks of the 
villagers and then the comments of 
the local and central authorities. All 
of the recordings are then projected 
before the villagers whose reactions 
are recorded once again. At the 
present time, Unesco is studying the 
setting up in Tanzania of a video 
communication centre which would 
train the villagers in the systematic 
use of this new type of communication 
for development, 
"two-way 
Projects are becoming more and 
more numerous: Algeria is now pre- 
paring a campaign for the promotion 
of rural activities known as the 
“thousand villages campaign” which 
will make wide use of video tech- 
niques, while in the Ivory Coast these 
techniques are to be used in the 
framework of rural development. 
But it is probably in the most 
deprived countries—as the examples 
of Tanzania and Bangladesh appear 
to suggest—that the uses of re- 
versible and simplified visual com- 
munications affording participation will 
be most effective, inasmuch as they 
will make it possible to break down 
the resistance of archaic communities 
without manipulating them, and pre- 
pare them collectively to face up to 
the necessary innovations. 
What then, over and above these 
specific uses, is the future of portable 
video? 
For many, it represents a first 
generation, a step towards other, more 
institutional forms of group communi- 
cation. 
possibility of its being taken over and 
institutionalized by community tele- 
vision using cable-relay systems. 
This development has moved on 
apace over the last five years in some 
countries: six million homes in the 
United States, a million and a half in 
Canada and two million in Great 
Britain are now provided with local pro-~ 
grammes by cable-relay companies. 
These programmes consist of weather 
reports, sports results, etc. 
Others have been in the project 
stage in France (seven towns) and in 
the Netherlands (six towns) since 1973. 
These companies will have a great 
need of images to broadcast and will 
probably want to use the production 
of the free video groups. In Canada, 
the production workshop, “Vidéo- 
graphe” of Montreal, has exper- 
imentally been connected by cable to 
10,000 television receivers in three 
neighbouring towns which have 
been able on request to obtain 
80 programmes recorded by non- 
professionals either at “Vidéographe” 
itself, or outside (Sélectovision). 
Pretty well everywhere in Europe, 
experiments using portable video 
within local communities are being 
used to pave the way for cable tele- 
vision installations. But it is unlikely 
that most of the video groups which 
have been formed in recent years 
will agree to become part of a one- 
way broadcasting system which, after 
all, is fairly similar to what they hope 
to replace. 
If they do, it will be necessary, in 
order to maintain the spirit of dialogue 
which is their raison d’étre, to install 
telecommunications making 
it possible for images to be returned 
to those transmitting them. 
Undeniably there is a strong 
The projects which have been 
developed in the United States, par- 
ticularly MINERVA (Multiple Input 
Network for Evaluation, Reaction, 
Votes and Attitudes) which should be 
in operation in 1985 and which aims 
at organizing citizens in uniform 
groups of 30 correspondents linked 
by telephone, these groups being 
themselves connected to each other 
by cable, show the absurdity, however,. 
of wanting to “organize” participation 
at any price through rigid networks 
formed by complex - technological 
machinery. 
A more promising direction 
would appear to be that pointed to by 
the creation by Vidéographe of a tiny, 
low-powered television station at Saint 
Lambert in Quebec, installed in the 
village church-tower to serve only the 
village, or the Pic Saint-Loup project 
in France which aims at combining 
extremely mobile video equipment with 
small local low-power transmitters for 
transmission in rural areas. In both 
cases the structures involved are 
technically flexible, economically ac- 
ceptable and in keeping with the social 
spirit of the video pioneers. 
Indeed, one of the striking features 
of these pathfinders is their wariness 
as regards all that is institutional. They 
also have a horror of advertising. 
“Over-exposure brings under-develop- 
ment in its wake”, one of them said 
recently, 
In their attitudes these young 
experimenters often display a certain 
puritanism and a moral outlook which, 
in its tendency to strip things down 
to the essential, seems sometimes to 
borrow its metaphors from Maoism: 
“One must be in the people like fish 
in the water... The major television 
organizations remain on the bank and 
see only the surface, never the depths 
of the people”, and so on. The 
“Guerrilla television” handbook offers 
the following advice: “Sell your car 
and buy a Portapack.” More than one 
person seems to have done so in 
the U.S.A. and Canada. 
Could this belief in the liberating 
potentialities of a technique perhaps 
be naive and anachronistic? What is 
striking about it, however, is its 
serious-mindedness, and it is highly 
possible that the intuition from which 
it stems will turn out to be decisive 
for the future. 
It has often been observed that 
the political and cultural criteria which 
still govern the international community 
seem to be borrowed from the period 
of the Second World War, whereas 
the basic technologies of our society 
all came into existence after the war, 
these technologies being information- 
producing ones—chiefly computers 
and television. 
In the last quarter of a century, so

OLDEST CHINESE 
PAINTING ON SILK 
Sir, 
| wish to draw your attention to one 
detail needing correction in Wen Pien's 
“The World's Oldest Painting on Silk", 
in your April 1974 issue. This is not 
the oldest Chinese painting on silk. An 
earlier one, dated 4th-3rd century B.C., 
was found a number of years ago, and 
has been reproduced in several publi- 
cations.

The painting we reproduced is the 
oldest complete Chinese painting on 
silk (2nd century B.C.) found so far. 
The work referred to by Professor Car- 
rington Goodrich is a fragment of an 
earlier painting, discovered in 1949 at 
Ch'ang-sha in Hunan Province. The 
fragment (drawing below) portrays a 
woman praying in the presence of the 
forces of life and death, symbolized 
by the phoenix and the dragon.

Letters to the Editor  
SULEIMAN EL-BARUNI 
Sir, 
In your highly commendable number 
on al-Biruni (June 1974) you included 
among the commemorative stamps of 
several countries (page 5) one from 
the Libyan Arab Republic. | should 
like to point out that the stamp in 
question was issued on the Centenary 
of a Suleiman El-Baruni, and not on 
the Millennium of the great Abu Al- 
Rayhan Mohammed Ibn Ahmad al-Biruni. 
Suleiman Pasha El-Baruni was born 
of Berber stock (1870) in the Libyan 
province of Tripolitania, at that time a 
part of the Ottoman Empire. He was 
in his own right, a remarkable scholar 
of Arabic literature, a poet, a leading 
Tripolitanian statesman, and one of the 
great national figures in Libya's long 
struggle for independence. 
When Italy invaded Libya in 1911, 
and forced the Sultan to cede this ter- 
ritory (October 12, 1912), the Libyans 
put pressure on the Ottoman Porte to 
issue the Firman (Decree) of October 
15, 1912 which granted them full auto- 
nomy. The Libyans regarded this action 
as a declaration of independence, and 
when many of the local leaders were 
demoralized and reduced to inaction 
after the recent strife, it was Suleiman 
Pasha El-Baruni, who attempted to rally 
the flagging resistance movement on 
the assumption that only a show of 
force would maike italy recognize his 
country's sovereignty. 
Though a daring leader, he was unable 
to unite all the people behind him, and 
the superior Italian forces soon overran 
the country. 
Baruni left for 1stambul in 1913, to 
return two years later in 1915 as his 
country’s new Governor and continued 
the struggle against Italy to the end of 
the First World War, In November 
1918, he (as a member of a Quadrim- 
virate: the Council of Four) proclaimed 
the country's independence at a national 
convention, and formally notified Italy 
of the establishment of the Republic. 
ltaly’s willingness to negotiate on 
this occasion was taken as a weakness 
and tempted the Libyans to insist on 
independence. As direct negotiations 
with the Italian Government in Rome 
ended in deadlock, war was declared 
and once again Baruni carried on the 
struggle until the resistance movement 
was crushed in 1922. He went into 
exile and died in Bombay (India) in 
1940, on the eve of his country's 
liberation.

TOBACCO AND ENVIRONMENT 
Sir, 
In June of this year about 400 deleg- 
ates from 42 countries attended a 
symposium at Unesco headquarters in 
Paris on the health effects of environ- 
mental pollution. This symposium, | 
believe, has helped to focus attention 
on the dangers of tobacco. 
It is usually said that factories are 
responsible for approximately 50 per 
cent of air pollution, cars for 25 per 
cent, and homes for 25 per_cent. My 
objection is that the mait culprit— 
tobacco—is overlooked. Tobacco pol- 
lution affects not only smokers but non- 
smokers as well, the latter of course 
to a lesser extent. A recent declara- 
tion by the Health Protection Directory 
of the European Communities in Brus- 
sels states that the level of carbon 
monoxide passed into the blood by 
tobacco Is on average 16 times higher 
than that caused by the atmospheric 
pollution of a great city.

JIGSAW PUZZLE OF DRUGS 
Sir, 
Your issue on “The Jigsaw Puzzle of 
Drugs” (May 1973) deserves special 
praise. Your handling of the subject 
was extraordinarily clear and objective. 
With this delicate problem one has to 
tread warily, especially when dealing 
with young people—stressing the phys- 
ical harm caused by drugs, but leaving 
the young a free choice in the matter, 
A clear and sensible explanation of the 
problem is likely to produce better 
results than campaigns which forbid, 
threaten etc. 
Anilo A. Krumenauer 
Porto Alegre, Brazil   
sociologists tell us, we have evolved 
from a “metallurgic” society to a 
“semiurgic” society (1), that is to say 
from a system founded on the pro- 
duction, circulation and exchange of 
products to another based on the 
production, circulation and exchange 
of signs and symbols, as is borne out, 
for instance, by the increasing import- 
ance of labels and packaging for 
consumer goods. 
All the theories of material wealth 
inherited from the 19th century were 
incapable, and understandably so, of 
taking into account this phenomenon 
which is just beginning to be explored 
by sociologists and economists. In the 
event, one may well wonder whether, 
(1) From the same root as “semiotics”, the 
study of signs. 
with the advent of video, this new 
economic science of signs is not itself 
already being challenged. 
For now visual communication is no 
longer an object which is distributed 
like a piece of merchandise; there are 
no longer manufacturers and con- 
sumers, producers and receivers of 
images, but persons communicating 
with each other from all sides. A 
utopia is taking shape: signs, messages 
and symbols are being produced, 
passed on and freely shared out 
independently of the traditional cor- 
porate bodies and monopolies. 
Whether it is a question of com- 
munities equipped with cable-relay 
systems, of tiny low-power transmitters 
or of “video ball-point pens”, there is 
evidence that, in a steadily increasing 
number of countries, the image 
being discreetly divested of its magical * 
powers and is being used to revitalize 
the social fabric. It is doing so by 
providing minorities with the oppor- 
tunity for free expression, waking 
people up to the environment and to 
themselves, and serving as a basis 
for the promotion of community ac- 
tivities and other forms of interaction 
yet to see the light. 
Everywhere “electronic literacy” is 
gaining new ground, and not to the 
detriment of conventional literacy. Do 
not both forms constitute a contribution 
to the task to which the international 
community is summoned by Unesco: 
the conquest of freedom and demo- 
cracy? n

worked out by Unesco at the request of 
the Peruvian Government, provides for the 
restoration and protection of pre-Colombian 
and Spanish monuments and sites in the 
areas around Cuzco, Puno and Desagua- 
dero, once the heart of the Inca empire, 
as centres of cultural tourism. 
Towards universal 
qualifications 
The important aim of internationalizing 
academic standards was brought a step 
nearer with the submission recently to 
Unesco Member States in Latin America 
and the Caribbean of the Draft Convention 
on the International Recognition of Studies, 
Diplomas and Degrees in Higher Education. 
Unesco is currently preparing similar con- 
ventions for the Arab States, for the States 
of Africa and for Europe. The long-term 
aim is a world agreement. 
Asia’s reading famine 
Producers of periodicals and communi- 
cations media specialists from 17 de- 
veloping Asian countries recently met in 
Tokyo under Unesco sponsorship to seek 
ways of combating a region-wide “famine” 
of reading matter. With a population of 
nearly one billion (28 per cent of the world 
total), the 17 countries produced only 
6.5 per cent of the estimated world output 
of 546,000 book titles in 1970. The aim is 
to fill part of the reading gap with period- 
icals, with their greater potential audience 
and possible faster and cheaper pro- 
duction. Other Unesco meetings on the 
development of the periodical press are to 
be held in Latin America, Africa and the 
Arab States. 
U.S.S.R. aid 
for Philae temples 
The U.S.S.R. is contributing 500,000 
Egyptian pounds ($1,300,000) to save the 
temples of Philae in Egypt. The pre- 
servation of the Philae temples is the final 
stage in the international campaign launched 
by Unesco in 1960 to save the monuments 
of Nubia, threatened by the waters from 
the Aswan High Dam. With the U.S.S.R. 
gift, contributions of Unesco Member States 
to the rescue operations total more than 
$8,200,000. 
Ethiopian drought 
volunteers 
Ninety student teachers from the Academy 
of Pedagogy, Bahir Dar, Ethiopia, are 
helping with drought relief work in their 
country under a joint programme of Unesco, 
Unicef, the United Nations Development 
Programme and the Ethiopian government. 
The students have volunteered for such 
tasks as distribution of clothing, foodstuffs 
and medicines, and supervision and ad- 
ministration of shelter camps. Where 
possible, they also plan to set up literacy 
classes for children and adults in the camps. 
Educational science bureau 
for Africa 
The International Association for Ad- 
vancement of Education Research is to set 
up an African Bureau of Educational Science 
with headquarters in Kinshasa, at the 
national university of Zaire. The Bureau 
will promote African research into education 
and publish information about current 
studies. 
Unesco medals 
for mcnuments 
Unesco is issuing a series of medals 
to contribute to the raising of funds to 
save some of the world’s outstanding mon- 
uments and sites, The first medal in the 
series is devoted to Moenjodaro (Paki- 
stan), one of the oldest urban sites in 
the world, for whose preservation Unesco 
has launched an international appeal (see 
“Unesco Courier”, December 1973). Below, 
the obverse side of the medal showing 
a King-Priest and the reverse depicting 
a unicorn and pictographic inscription found 
on a seal at Moenjodaro. The medal Is 
available in bronze, silver and gold. Other 
medals will feature Borobudur (Indonesia), 
Venice (Italy), Philae (Egypt). etc. Infor- 
mation on each medal issue may be obtain- 
ed from Public Liaison Division, Unesco, 
Place Fontenoy, Paris 75700 (France).
