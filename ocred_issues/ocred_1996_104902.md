ervé Telémaque 
™ Haitian-born artist Hervé Télémaque uses a mixture of 
techniques and materials—painting and collage, salvaged 
objects and graffiti—to create works that attempt to infuse 
“new energy” into images and words. Here he talks to 
Juliette Broussard about his artistic development and his 
conception of painting. 
  
BM You've been living in France for thirty-five years, 
but your work is increasingly evocative of your 
Haitian roots and culture. 
Hervé Télémaque: I left Port-au-Prince in 1957 
when Frangois Duvalier came to power and 
went to study painting at the Art Students’ 
League in New York. 1 was only in the United 
States for three years, but in a sense I am 
American simply because 1 was horn in the 
Caribbean basin, which is close to the United 
States and dominated by its models. But in 
New York I became afraid of losing my identity. 
1t was partly because of my quest for identity 
wi) that I moved to France in 1961. I wanted to 
find mysclf. Besides, in New York abstract 
expressionism was running out of steam and

that came in with pop art. Moreover, I'rance is 
an integral part of Ilaitian culture, its fantasies 
and its relationship with language. Since Ilaiti 
is French-speaking, returning to Europe was a 
move towards my formative values. 
WM How much have you been influenced by the 
surrealists? 
H.T.: The surrealists showed me values that still 
govern my creative energy. My relationship to art 
is defined by psychoanalytical experimentation. 
I’ve remained very close to the plastic values 
expressed by Arshile Gorky, Giorgio de Chirico, 
© David Harali, Pans 
René Magritte and Marcel Duchamp. The sur- 
realists taught me that art could be a way of 
comprehending both the world and oneself. This 
self-knowledge naturally leads to all sorts of 
moral questions: relationships between people, 
love, social organization. One of the lessons of 
surrealism that I’ve always believed in is that the 
visual is not only a source of aesthetic pleasure 
but that its force lies in expressing a certain 
experience and an ambitious perception of exis- 
tenee. Art tells the story of our time on earth. 
HM Afeel for language is very apparent in 
everything you do. 
H. T.: I love Iaitian poetry, the work of people 
like Jacques Roumain and Carl Brouard, who 
define black identity. From very early on 
ITaitian poetry, tuned in as it was to the history 
of the colonization of Santo Domingo, to slavery 
and the IIaitian revolution of 1804, gave body 
to the concepts of negritude and black pride, 
concepts which Aimé Césaire later brought to 
a white heat in his great poem, Return to My 
Native Land. Apart from that, I’ve remained 
faithful to the poets I loved reading when I was 
young— Rimbaud, Saint-John Perse and André 
Breton. I like to quote what Saint-John Perse 
said in his aeceptance speech for the Nobel 
Prize for Literature in 1960, “For if poetry is 
not, as it has been said, ‘absolute reality’, it is 
the closest we ean get to understanding it, at 
that extreme limit of complicity where reality 
in the poem seems to inform itself.” 
HM How do you work? 
H.T.: My way of working can be broken down into 
three stages. First of alt I play around with the 
medium, then—this is the second stage—some- 
thing clicks, a specific formal idea emerges. The 
third stage is when I put it all together. 
Technique only comes in at this final stage, 
which is subsidiary to the spontaneous original 
idea and to playing around with forms waiting to 
see what happens. My large charcoal drawings, 
which are move lyrical and stylistically unified, 
serve the formal idea by trying to capture a fan- 
tasy, a memory or a desire as simply as possible. 
In them objects become coats of arms, totems

and emblems. I work with simple materials— 
wood, glue and screws. I use clamps. Ilove basic 
tools like the saw, which I sometimes use as a 
pencil, or the sander. 
Take the eharcoal drawings and objects that 
were shown at an exhibition of my work in 1994, 
Fusain et mare de café (“Charcoal and Coffee 
Grounds”), Deuil: le dessin, l'objet (“Mourning: 
the Drawing, the Object”). For the objects I 
used coffee grounds, a natural pigment, but to 
ironic effect. The dark charcoal evokes night, 
whereas the coffee could symbolize the transi- 
tion from dark to light, from night to dawn—it’s 
also an exotic colonial product that has given a 
lot of pleasure to white people. 
BM What about colour? 
H.T.: I nse colour like a signal. In 1986, when 
the Duvalier regime ended, ITaitians made sym- 
bolic use of red and blue, the colours of the 
national flag. The whole island was daubed with 
red and blue as part of a groundswell of popu- 
lar feeling, a symbolic explosion after liberation 
from thirty years of dictatorship. I was very 
touched by the vulnerability of my people, who 
had nothing left but this sign, this simple mark- 
ingin red and Dlue, as proof of their existence. 
I reduced my palette to those two elements, to 
that basie signal of identity. 
BM You are moving from a ratherintellectual 
position towards simpler values. 
H. T.: Perhaps one grows simpler with age! 
While my works may once have been a bit too 
much of a virtuoso performance, I'm more sure 
of myself now. Doesn’t all art tend towards sim- 
plicity and anonymity? Painters dabble with 
objects and ideas, manipulate signs and use 
their intuition. Artists are too often lumped 
together with intellectuals. My feeling is that 
artists should listen to their inner selves, give 
expression to their creativity and avoid self-een- 
sorship. My art is never programmed. What’s 
best in artists wends its way through them 
withont any strict programming. I also think it’s 
a good thing to let memories float to the sur- 
face. I once saw a magazine photo of a woman 
in Soweto in South Africa whose fat legs 
 
reminded me of the legs of my old nanny, 
Christiane. There was no direct connection 
between the two, but it was a moment that 
brought a memory back to the surface. I think 
there are no lies in art. 
MW Asan artist, where do you stand in today's 
culture and society? 
H.T.: It secms to me there’s a crisis in the visual 
arts, and it’s good to get back to simple, basic 
things. My current work is dominated by my 
love of drawing. Drawing on a sheet of paper is 
simpler than painting. From drawing I go 
straight to objects, and that means colour. I am 
first and foremost a painter. A painter-assem- 
bler, if you like. I regard painting as the most 
advanced, the most complex of the visual arts. 
The arts seem to me to be a natural vehicle for 
greater understanding between cultures. Just 
think how immersed we all are in jazz, without

realizing it. Blacks have made a big contribu- 
tion through musie. Music is the way to an 
understanding of the black character. We all 
travel, we all move endlessly from place to 
place. What worries me is the bulldozer effect 
of world television that broadcasts the same 
series all over the planet. I feel we are going 
through a schizophrenic period. It’s more nec- 
essary than ever to be receptive to one’s inner 
self, to be alert to one’s own dreams. It makes 
me think again of Saint-John Perse, who urged 
us not to forget the man of clay. 
BM Do people still think of art as a necessity? 
H. T.: Absolutely! But the meaning of culture 
must be redefimed. Look at the United States. 
You might think that such a materialistic soci- 
ety could do without art. But look at all the 
great American artists there are! They prove 
that there is a need for art, that art is nscful— 
otherwise it wouldn’t exist. The museums and 
the number of people who go to them are 
ample proof of this. 
HM Has contemporary art emerged from an older art? 
H. T.: The widespread interest in the art forms 
of the past arose at the beginning of this cen- 
tury with the poet Guillaume Apollinaire. In 
my case il was during a visit to Egypt that I 
found a kind of basis for modern art. In the art 
of the ancient Egyptians I saw a justification for 
certain major choices—stylistic clarity, direct- 
ness and the link with language. With hiero- 
glyphies we move from a painted image to a 
written sign, which is very modern, for this 
(question of moving from writing to the visual is 
still highly topical. It was in Egypt that I found 
an art that probably heralds all Western cul- 
ture. And has never been bettered. To my mind 
its characteristics are a very high level of refine- 
ment and a message of great complexity. 
Despite this complexity, I am fascinated by the 
accessibility of this art, hy its regard for essen- 
tials, its lack of any leanings towards naturalisin, 
Of course I am simply talking about its formal 
aspeets, since I am not capable of deciphering 
the whole Egyptian cosmogony. With its exquis- 
ite draughtsmanship and sense of volume, 
ancient Egyptian art is in complete contrast, to 
take one example, with the simplicity of 
Oceanian sculpture, which is nonetheless one of 
the pinnacles of world art. With the Egyptians 
a whole world is construeted, whereas in New 
Guinea, we're listening to primal humanity, 
closer to the earth and the gods. 
HM Does art teaching today succeed in making 
students aware of contemporary art? 
H. T.: Contrary to what is widely thought, mod- 
ern art—even abstract art—seems to me more 
accessible than the high art of the Renaissance, 
for example, which often calls for knowledge of 
the great myths and of religion. I think modern 
art is a move direct mirror, favourable to an inter- 
change between the work of art and its audi- 
ence. In many cases its questioning of appear- 
ances makes use of irony, perhaps to express the 
complexities of our time more accurately. MW

### 104854: The Marketplace: past and present

 
The marketplace 
past and present 
It has become virtually impossible to live in isola- 
tion from the marketplace. Our needs have 
become so diversified that they can only be met 
by constant recourse to products, services, 
finance and information available on the market. 
And market transactions have become so inten- 
sive and so far-reaching that they are now planet- 
wide. One might say that the pulse of world eco- 
nomic activity today is measured by the state of 
the market. 
It has not always been so. 
For thousands of years the market was only of 
marginal importance. On the one hand it brought 
into contact separate, self-sufficient communities 
which exchanged among themselves goods that 
were merely ancillary, inessential to their internal 
balance. On the other, the people who engaged in 
these transactions attached less importance to eco- 
nomic considerations than they did to the imper- 
atives of religion, custom and lineage that gov- 
erned their lives. 
But even within these limits, the market played 
an extremely important role as a channel of com- 
munication. It was the only opportunity for closed 
communities to open their doors, however 
briefly, to the outside world, make contact with 
others and catch a glimpse of human diversity. In 
the long run, trade promoted the circulation of 
ideas, technical innovation and productive work. 
In the modern age the status of the market 
changed. It ceased to be a mechanism of sec- 
ondary exchange and became instead a mainspring 
of social activity, the regulator of production. The 
economy—hitherto the servant of non-material- 
istic ends which the group considered sacred— 
became a law unto itself, gradually infiltrating into 
all areas of life, harnessing everything within reach 
to its purposes and eventually transforming all 
established values—including cultural, traditional

and moral values—into commodities that could be 
bought and sold. 
Some reacted to this change by treating the 
market itself as sacred, regarding it as an impartial 
power governed by impersonal laws that would, 
via competition, inevitably encourage the best and 
penalize the mediocre. However, a closer look 
leads to the conclusion that while the market acts 
as an economic regulator and rationalizer, it tends 
to develop a network of inegalitarian relationships 
within which the law of the strongest triumphs 
over the spirit of reciprocity. 
Freedom and inequality 
Infact, the market can be seen as a kind of fron- 
tier arca inhabited by two contradictory princi- 
ples—freedom and inequality—between which 
only imperfect compromises can ever be made. A 
no-holds-barred free market is in fact a “free-for- 
all”, a confrontation between strong and weak lead- 
ing ultimately to situations where competition 
ceases to exist, thus jeopardizing the very principle 
of freedom and resulting in the impoverishment 
and exclusion of more and more economic agents. 
Beyond a certain threshold, the process breaks the 
bonds that hold society together and even, taken to 
extremes, makes it impossible for commercial 
activity to continue. And so, the argument goes, 
there must be a counterweight to market forces; 


### 104854: The Marketplace: past and present

the law of the market must be contained and regu- 
lated by political bodies which endeavour to main- 
tain a certain balance between unbridled economic 
freedom and unchecked inequality. 
Several attempts have been made this century 
to strike such a balance. For a wide variety of rea- 
sons, most of these attempts have failed. 
This explains why in the past few years all kinds 
of attempts to liberalize markets and weaken the 
ideological basis of political interventionism have 
made great strides. The globalization of financial, 
technological and information flows, in these con- 
ditions, has created a highly volatile market that 
knows no frontiers, is prone to unpredictable 
developments and rapidly changing situations. In 
this globalized market competition favours big 
transnational groups (while not preventing the 
emergence of new pockets of prosperity) and no 
international body seems able to control economic 
behaviour or arbitrate, politically or legally, the 
conflicts resulting from it. 
The globalization of corruption, siphoning off 
drug money and feeding international crime, is one 
dramatic symptom of this state of affairs which is 
corroding the foundations of democracy and 
undermining familiar religious, ethnic and national 
landmarks. It should come as no surprise that two 
very different trends are developing in response to 
this widespread corruption—the strengthening of 
democratic control mechanisms and recourse to 
the dictatorship of closed identities. 
The marketplace is thus a crossroads, a meeting 
place of some key issues of the late twentieth cen- 
tury. In reporting on this crucial phenomenon we 
have tried to shed light not only on the ways in 
which it has changed and is changing but also, and 
above all, on its contradictory aspects. Rn

### 104861: The Birth of homo economicus

The birth of homo 
BY ALAIN CAILLE 
sa 
as economic man, the selfish, cal- 
culating and rational individual that 
economists place at the heart of 
their theoretical constructions, 
always existed? Is he universal or, 
on the contrary, was he spawned recently by 
certain types of social relationships? 
In areas where we today think in terms of 
bargaining (buying and selling goods), ancient 
societies reasoned in terms of gifts (compul- 
sorily made, accepted and returned) and 
alliances, even if, according to the French soci- 
ologist Marcel Mauss, the personal material 
interest that lies at the heart of commercial 
exchange can always be detected behind these 
practices. 
Prices fixed by custom 
On the whole, the distribution of goods via 
the major trading processes in ancient soci- 
eties did not serve a utilitarian purpose so 
much as satisfy a need for the extravagant and 
the prestigious. It was not so much a matter 
of receiving and accumulating as of appearing 
in the most generous and magnificent possi- 
ble light. 
Similarly, the countable objects which are 
widely regarded as being the forerunners of 
modern currency did not enable people to 
buy anything they wanted, but only to pay the 
debts of life and death. You paid the debt you 
had contracted towards those who gave you 
wives (and the children they bore)—in other 
words life—and towards those families in 
which you had caused a death. Trade grew up 
only on the outer confines of those commu- 
nities, as a result of contact with people who did 
not belong to them: forcigners. 
Evidence of long-distance trade goes back to 
prehistoric times, when certain goods travelled 
thousands of kilometres from their place of ori- 
gin, but there is nothing to prove that such trad- 
ing was organized in conformity with the prin- 
ciples of the market. The Hungarian-born 
cconomist Karl Polanyi believed that there is 
not necessarily any connection between trade 
and the market as itis understood in economic 
theory, or indeed between trade and village or 
local street markets. In Babylon and throughout 
He unesco ((QURIER W NOVEMBER 1996 
economicus 
the ancient world of the Middle East, large-scale 
trade was run and supervised by government 
officials. International prices were fixed by 
diplomatic treaties and could not be called into 
question or altered by bargaining. 
More generally, in what might be called tra- 
ditional markets, prices existed before trading 
took place and were not readily affected by the 
volume of that trading. They were social prices, 
fixed by custom, whereas the modern market 
analysed by economic theory is a self-regulated 
market where prices are independent of social 
relationships between people and result from 
the interplay of supply and demand. In 
Polanyi’s view, it is this divorce between the 
market and social relationships in general that 
characterizes economic modernity. 
Medieval markets, and a large proportion of 
markets in France during the Ancien Régime, 
when prices were strictly controlled, have lit- 
tle in common with self-regulated markets. It 
can also be argued that the kind of trading prac- 
tised by leading merchants in Genoa, Amalfi, 
Venice and the Hanseatic ports at the end of the 
Middle Ages was venture- rather than 
market-oriented. The profits they made, 
although sometimes considerable, were uncer- 
tain and attendant on risk. They had no obvious 
connection with the law of supply and demand. 
By the end of the sixteenth century, inter- 
national trade in cereals and the main metals 
amounted to the equivalent of only about 1

per cent of basic consumption. The wealthiest 
husbandmen sold only 15-20 per cent of their 
harvests. This is still a far cry from a market- 
dominated economy. 
An obsolete notion? 
Let’s take the argument further. Even within 
cconomies that are manifestly dependent on 
the market, prices are less strictly conditioned 
by the law of supply and demand than eco- 
nomic theory requires. Barely twenty years 
ago in France, for instance, the fluctuations in 
fish prices that resulted from varying catch 
sizes were to a large extent tempered by the 
need for a stable relationship between the skip- 
per and his crew on the one hand, and the skip- 
per and the fish wholesalers on the other. 
Similarly, negotiations conducted within the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 
(GATT) provide ample proof that farm prices 
have nothing to do with market prices. It may 
even be legitimate to ask whether the prices of 
goods in general, whatever their nature, are

not conditioned by power relationships or, if 
you like, by the socially recognized value of 
the individuals, groups, socio-professional cat- 
egories and nations that produce them rather 
than by strictly material or economic volumes. 
Much recent research has shown that the 
functioning of actual markets, which hinges 
on a system of networks (monopolies or oli- 
gopolies), has so little connection with what 
cconomic theory says about it that some 
authoritics believe that the notion of “the mar- 
ket” as such is now obsolete. 
Lastly, it is well known that even in the most 
capitalist cconomies actual economic activity 
often depends less on market requirements 
than on state and administrative norms. The 
importance of the market’s secondary role is 
further diminished by the fact that the bulk of 
social life takes place in the field of interpersonal 
relationships and not in the sphere of business, 
politics or administration. And these relation- 
ships are governed not by money or the law, 
but by gifts and debts.

» of the market, on the other hand, believe that no 
people is unaware of the existence or the pos- 
sibility of self-interested exchange. Woven into 
the noble and ceremonial trading process of 
the Trobriand Islanders of Papua New Guinea 
(kula), for example, is the notion of utilitarian 
exchange, or swap (grimwali). Similarly, 
according to Marcel Mauss barter was not 
unknown among the Kwakiutl Indians of the 
northwest coast of North America, even 
though they practised potlatch, a ceremonial 
feast at which chiefs gave presents to enhance 
their status. If primitive cultures as a whole set 
such store by gifts, generosity and disinter- 
estedness, it was not because they were 
unaware of the existence of utilitarian or self- 
interested motives, but rather through a con- 
cern to maintain soctal cohesion, which would 
have been jeopardized if venality had not been 
subordinated to the practice of giving. 
Supply and demand 
in the ancient world 
So when did the self-regulated market first 
appear? Polanyi admits, in The Livelihood of 
Man (1977), that it already existed in Athens 
in the fifth century B.C. The detailed descrip- 
tion of a market economy by Plato, which he 
calls “a healthy city-state” (The Republic, IT), 
establishes beyond all doubt that the inner 
workings of the market were already well 
known in his time. 
But even three centuries earlier, in China, 
the prime minister of the state of Ch’i, Kuan 
Chong (730-645 B.C.), accurately described the 
mechanism of supply and demand, and asserted 
that the introduction of fixed prices, even if 
they were periodically reviewed, “would make 
price movements less fluid, hinder production 
and inhibit economic activity”. 
It may therefore be argued that, while the 
market can never be reduced simply to an 
exchange of a purely economic naturc or to a 
set of impersonal relations unconnected with 
social, cultural or historical factors, there did 
emerge, very early on, a logical process gov- 
erning production and consumption which 
superseded that governing the reproduction of 
social statuses. The essence of the market 
resides in the specific momentum which that 
process imparts to the circulation of goods 
within a given social system. 
To abandon the notion of the market on the 
pretext that the theoretical model cannot be real- 
ized in its pure form would therefore seem to be 
a mistake. A more fruitful approach is to specify, 
in each individual case, how trade, the law and 
making gifts interrelate as ordering structures. 
The political interface 
It would seem that for centuries before the 
Western model spread throughout the world 
the human economy was chiefly notable for 
its diversity. Varying forms of self-regulated 
market in a more or less pure form appeared at 
various points in the world, probably because 
they could be reached by natural communica- 
tion routes such as seas and rivers. But in most 
parts of the world knowledge of that form of 
market remained incomplete and indirect, and 
was mediatized by a considerable number of 
other factors. Some regions remained totally 
unaware of it until very recently. 
Geographical diversity has been accompa- 
nied by a historical variability which has meant 
that the market appears at one moment, only 
to disappear the next. There is evidence of it in 
the Roman Empire of the second century 
A.D. butit seems to wither away completely 
during the following centuries. Although we 
find a theoretician of economic liberalism as 
far back as the seventh century B.C, in the 
person of Kuan Chong, the actual existence 
of such a market after the imperial unification 
of China seems more than doubtful. In 
Europe, what produced the modern market at 
the end of the Middle Ages was not large-scale 
trade in luxury goods, but the alliance of 
embryonic nation states with bankers and a 
nascent bourgeoisie. Nation states and the 
modern market then became coextensive. 
It may then be argued that while the mar-

ket economy exists potentially, in other words 
virtually, in all societies, its actualization 
depends on specific factors peculiar to each 
of them. They are factors which may be 
described as political if the term is understood 
to mean the way in which a society decides, 
in a conflictual relationship, what form its unity 
and singularity should take. 
Where liberal economists go wrong is when 
 
they contend that the market can be set up at 
will, without any concern for how it contributes 
to the cohesion or dislocation of societies. The 
example of the Third World some time ago and 
the more recent example of the former Soviet 
Union show that, while there is such a thing as 
alogical market process, the crucial question is 
how far it can operate freely. And this is a polit- 
ical, not an economic, issue. |

n pre-Columbian Mexico a great 
market was held in the Aztec city of 
Tlatelolco. Its size and organization 
amazed the Spanish-conquistadors, 
who had seen nothing like it in six- 
teenth-century Europe. 
Tlatelolco was a part of the Aztec capital, 
Tenochtitlin which, so legend has it, was 
founded on an island in Lake Texcoco in 1325. 
The site was ideal for exploiting the lake’s 
resources, but seed, fruit, vegetables, building 
materials and many other essential goods had 
to be brought in from outside. In 1337, an 
Aztec splinter group founded an independent 
city, Tlatelolco, on an island north of 
Tenochtitlin. The two cities soon became 
rivals. Tlatelolco’ strategic position and the 
extraordinary business acumen of its inhabi-

tants were such that it acquired a formidable 
commercial reputation. 
A market suburb 
At first the market of Tlatelolco dealt exclu- 
sively in primary products, but economic and 
social development slowly encouraged the 
growth of trade in luxury goods. This became 
so important that an institution specializing in 
long-distance trade was set up. It was known 
as the Pochtecayotl and sct up a trading net- 
work that reached as far as the provinces of 
the Mayan empire. 
In 1473, after a war in which no quarter 
was given, Tlatelolco was defeated in battle by 
an army from Tenochtitlin. Overnight the 
proud city became a suburb of Tenochtitlin. 
In view of the market’s reputation and size, 
however, the victors decided to encourage its 
expansion by transporting to it a wide vari- 
ety of rare products from other cities and 
regions of the Aztec empire. 
The conquistadors’ 
amazement 
When the Spanish conquered Mexico, the 
market of Tlatelolco was at the height of its 
prosperity. Contemporary Spanish chroni- 
clers describe how the market place was 
located to the east of the city’s great ceremo- 
nial enclosure on a vast square esplanade with 
sides 200 metres long, fully paved and level

Te capital of the Aztec 
empire, Tenochtitlan, stood on 
the site of what is now Mexico 
City. Its rival city, Tlatelolco, 
eventually became a suburb of 
the great metropolis. Scene

the centre of the square was the momoztli, a 
kind of truncated stepped pyramid which

other public events. 
Hernando Cortés, the Spanish conqueror 
of Mexico, wrote that “This city has many 
squares where trade and commerce go on all 
the time. One square is twice the size of 
Salamanca and surrounded with arcades that 
more than 70,000 people pass through cvery 
day, buying and selling.” 
Admirably sited ncar the quay of La 
Lagunilla, where boats laden with merchan- 
disc tied up, the market was also joined to the 
mainland by three causeways. 
As the shop window of the Aztec world, 
Tlatelolco market offered its customers an 
amazing variety of exotic products from the 
four corners of the empire—fruit, animals, 
medicines, cloth, hides, pottery, instruments, 
tools and materials of all sorts. It also pro- 
vided many services: public baths, cafés, bar- 
ber shops, porters and slave markets. 
Cacao currency 
The merchants, known officially as tla- 
macaque, were generally also the producers. 
Middlemen known as regatoneria, who 
bought cheap and sold at a profit, did not 
appear until the colonial period. 
Barter was the normal practice, but some 
commodities also served as currency. Cacao 
was grown for this purpose in certain parts of 
the empire, with the consequence that its 
production was strictly controlled by the 
government. The basic unit was the bean for 
inexpensive items and the sack of 8,000 beans 
(xiquipiles) for expensive items. 
Handkerchief-sized squares of cotton 
known as guachtli were also used as cur- 
rency. They came in three sizes, equalling 65, 
80 and 100 cocoa beans respectively. A canoe 
was worth a guachtli of 100 beans. A slave

who could sing was worth 30 guachtlis, and 
an excellent singer and dancer could fetch 40 
quachtlis, or 4,000 cocoa beans. 
Gold dust was another form of payment. 
It was poured into feather quills, whose value 
was based on their length and diameter. Small 
change came in the form of small, thin, T- 
shaped copper coins, nuggets of gold, copper 
or pewter, chips of jade and even the red shell 
from a mollusc now known as the spondylus. 
These trading activities obeyed well- 
established laws and rules, for the market, like 
other institutions in pre-Columbian Mexico, 
functioned on a “correct and fair” (in qualli, 
in yectli) basis. No business could be trans- 
acted outside the market arca, where each

merchant was allotted a place corresponding 
to the nature of his wares. Lengths of rope 
and receptacles of various capacities were 
standardized and used to measure quantities. 
The price of each article was fixed in advance, 
and any merchant caught cheating on mea- 
sures or price was severely punished. 
There was a chamber where twelve judges 
sat in permanent session to ensure fair deal- 
ing and settle differences. Superintendents 
regularly went on rounds to maintain security 
and prevent fraud. 
When they founded Mexico City, the 
Europeans created two new markets but nei-

emporium 
“Let us begin with the dealers in gold, silver and precious 
stones, feathers, cloaks and embroidered goods, and male 
and female slaves. . . . Next there were those who sold coarser 
cloth, and cotton goods and fabrics made of twisted thread, 
and there were chocolate merchants with their chocolate. In 
this way you could see every kind of merchandise to be found 
anywhere in New Spain, laid out in the same way as goods are 
laid out in my own district of Medina del Campo, a centre for 
fairs, where each line of stalls has its own particular sort. So 
it was in this great market. There were those who sold sisal 
cloth and ropes and the sandals they wear on their feet, which 
are made from the same plant. All these were kept in one part 
of the market, in the place assigned to them, and in another 
part were skins of tigers and lions, otters, jackals and deer, 
badgers, mountain cats, and other wild animals, some tanned 
and some untanned, and other classes of merchandise. 
“There were sellers of kidney-beans and sage and other veg- 
etables and herbs in another place, and in yet another they were 
selling fowls, and birds with great dewlaps [turkeys], also rab- 
bits, hares, deer, young ducks, little dogs and other such 
creatures. Then there were the fruiterers; and the women who 
sold cooked food, flour and honey cake, and tripe, had their 
part of the market. Then came pottery of all kinds, from big 
water-jars to little jugs, displayed in its own place, also honey, 
honey-paste and other sweets like nougat. Elsewhere they 
sold timber too, boards, cradles, beams, blocks, and benches, 
all in a quarter of their own. 
“But why waste so many words on the goods in their great 
market? If | describe everything in detail | shall never be done. 
Paper, which in Mexico they call amal, and some reeds that smell 
of liquidambar, and are full of tobacco, and yellow ointments and 
other such things, are sold in a separate part. Much cochineal 
is for sale too, under the arcades of that market, and there are 
many sellers of herbs and other such things. . .. 
“| am forgetting the sellers of salt and the makers of flint 
knives, and how they split them off the stone itself, and the 
fisherwomen and the men who sell small cakes made from a 
sort of weed which they get out of the great lake, which curdles 
and forms a kind of bread which tastes rather like cheese. 
They sell axes too, made of bronze and copper and tin, and 
gourds and brightly painted wooden jars... .."

Three centuries later, this district—the

banks were concentrated around the little 
church of San Giacomo (reputedly the oldest 
in Venice) and its adjacent square. 
At the foot of a wooden bridge, the first 
to be built across the Grand Canal, were 
many offices. Just opposite the public scales, 
cells awaited those who tried to cheat on their 
taxes or flout the property laws. On the Riva 
del Vino and the Riva del Ferro (the Wine 
and Iron Quays), thronged with barges laden 
with wine, oil, iron, salt and flour, stood the 
Land Customs House, the Wine Toll House 
and various valuers’ offices which, dark and 
poky though they were, were well situated to 
supervise water-borne traffic. 
Not far away was the great flour ware- 
house set up in the thirteenth century and 
run by private officials on the state’s behalf. 
There was a small portico beneath which 
sacks of oats and corn were unloaded. The 
Ruga degli Orefici (Goldsmiths’ Street), 
which led to the Rialto bridge, contained jew- 
ellers’ shops, as well as drapers’ stalls in a long 
building known as the Drapperia. Merchants 
selling Tuscan cloth were based in the Rialto 
Nuovo square behind the Drapperia. 
A number of magistrates’ offices were 
also situated at the foot of the bridge. Beneath 
an open portico nobles and merchants trans- 
acted business, and magistrates regulated the 
mooring of boats and the sale of merchandise.

Venetian painter Antonio 
Canal, better known as 
Canaletto. A market was held 
in the square. 
DONATELLA CALABI, 
of Italy, is a specialist in urban 
history. 
The Camerlenghi di Comun, magistrates 
responsible for state funds, officiated in an 
adjoining building. 
The square of San Giacomo was the hub 
of the Rialto and the place where international 
contracts were negotiated. On the ground 
floor of a nearby building were money- 
changers and, later, counters where contracts 
were drawn up. In the upper storeys vaulted 
rooms contained depositaries and the apart- 
ments of public inspectors known as 
Provveditori. In one nearby street, lined by 
the ironwork gratings of notaries’ offices, 
were the headquarters of the marine insur- 
ance authorities. In another were furriers. 
Two more contained shops selling cheese, 
basketwork and rope. 
On a vast quayside area built on piles over 
the Grand Canal were the herb market 
(Erbaria), the fruit market (Fruttaria) and 
other specialized emporia, and a mooring for 
members of the nobility. To spare the neigh- 
bourhood the smell of fish, the Pescharia (the 
fish market) was banished from San Giacomo 
square. The rest of the Rialto consisted of a 
few houses, warehouses and shops, tabernae 
where the many foreign merchants received 
hospitality and other inns frequented by 
prostitutes. 
A few reminders of the Rialto’s historic 
importance as a hub of trade between East 
and West still survive. The Stagiera pubblica 
(public scales) at the foot of the Rialto bridge 
and the Pietra del bando (a pink granite col- 
umn where the decrees of the Republic were 
read out) on San Giacomo square are still 
used. 
The architect commissioned to rebuild 
the district after the fire of 1514, Antonio 
Abbondi, known as Scarpagnino, made the 
Rialto a more homogeneous and less con- 
gested district, as we can see in his Old 
Buildings (Fabbriche Vecchie), formerly the 
headquarters of the superintendants of trade, 
navigation and supplies. The trend towards 
greater regularity in architecture and town 
planning culminated, around the middle of 
the sixteenth century, in Jacopo Sansovino’s 
New Buildings (Fabbriche Nuove), which 
follow the curve of the Grand Canal. 
The finishing touch to the integration of 
the trading centre into the city was made in 
1587 when the decision was taken to rebuild 
the old wooden bridge in stone. [|

many that were established on planta-

eastern Brazil, the market came into existence 
ata time of large-scale expansion at Serro-Azul 
triggered by the introduction of modérn

made the master, who until then had person-

remote from the moradores, the labourers 
who lived on his estate. Power came to be 
exercised by intermediaries, the managers of

» and the little shacks in which the workers and 
some of the moradores lived (most of the lat- 
ter lived out in the cane fields). 
The market was held on Saturday evenings 
and Sunday mornings. At first glance it 
seemed like a market in any other small town. 
The same foodstuffs (fruit, vegetables, meat, 
manioc flour, clothes and household linen) 
were on sale and it was divided up in lots in 
the same way. However, a sharp eye might 
have noted that there were no cattle or pack 
animals in the market. Stock-rearing was the 
privilege of small, independent producers. 
The company store 
People with goods to sell could come from 
outside the estate, but most of them were 
from the plantation—moradores with pro- 
duce from their plots of land, refinery work- 
ers, women office staff and labourers. Each 
vendor was assigned a pitch by the master or 
the market superintendent. This arrangement 
could be rescinded at any moment, for 
whereas in towns the right to set up a market 
stall is normally paid for in the form of a 
municipal tax, here it was a reward for a loyal 
morador, like the grant of a plot of land on 
which to grow a few vegetables. 
The customers were moradores from nearby 
domains, refinery workers and employees’ 
wives. It would never have crossed the minds 
of people from outside the plantation to do

their shopping at Serro-Azul. Prices were not 
very competitive with those in town. This was 
above all a place where the plantation-owner 
could show that he was the boss. All the peo- 
ple who lived on the plantation patronized the 
Serro-Azul market, but the managerial staff 
only went there when they had no time to go 
to the town. 
“We buy at Serro-Azul because we have 
to,” people said. “There’s nothing else we can 
do; but it’s not a market, it’s a barracio, a com- 
pany store.” For both the cane field workers 
(the poorest of whom were not even allowed 
into the market) and the refinery workers the 
market was a symbol of their subjugation. The 
plantation managers, who rode through the 
market on horseback, talked down from the 
saddle to any moradores they wanted to see. 
The presence of the master and his family was 
“natural” because his house was so near. 
Unlike farmers from the region, moradores 
and workers could only buy and sell during 
“free” time (granted at the owner’s discretion) 
from their work on the plantation. 
An instrument of control 
Traders from outside the estate were hawk- 
ers and small producers who had already 
worked on the plantation on a seasonal basis. 
They owned small plots of land in the sur- 
rounding region, and made ends meet in this 
way. The owner was well disposed towards

them because during the harvest they had 
lived in the outhouses of the refinery and had 
assimilated the rules of the big plantation. 
They all knew him and greeted him in the 
marketplace. 
Officially the market came under the 
municipality of Palmares, but it was the plan- 
tation-owner who fixed the time and place 
for business and oversaw the distribution of 
produce for the barracio. Meat, dried fish, oil 
and coffee on sale at the barracio could not 
be sold by outsiders. The market superinten- 
dent who collected the stand taxes on behalf 
of the municipality was a functionary but he 
was also the master’s right-hand man. 
The master thus controlled every square 
inch of the market without nceding to be 
physically present. By providing an opportu- 
nity to buy goods on the estate, he could 
supervise trade and social life on the planta- 
tion, keep tabs on the financial situation of his 
moradores, control their relations with the 
outside world and restrain alcohol abuse and 
fighting. The market tightened his links with 
the workers and asserted his power over 
them. 
The existence of a market on the planta- 
tion did not give the moradores, labourers or 
employees an opportunity to achieve auton- 
omy from the landowner. Bringing people 
together was a gift to the community in 
return for which the community was kept

under the owner’ vigilant eye. Although 
strictly speaking the market was not directly 
controlled by the land-owner, it was orga- 
nized so that it corralled the people who lived 
on the plantation into an area dominated by 
him, narrowed their mental horizons and iso- 
lated them from the world without any need 
to draw up formal regulations or even build 
a fence around the plantation. 
This was how things were until the day 
when traditional relationships on the planta- 
tion finally came to an end. In the 1970s, 
when we carried out the survey on which 
this article is based, the Serro-Azul market 
was winding down. Most of the moradores 
did their shopping in town, where goods 
were cheaper and they could meet all kinds 
of people, leave a closed world and have 
access to a union. The focus of social life had 
moved from inside the plantation to outside. 
When the flow of exchange (work, med- 
ical aid, protection) between master and 
morador ceased to have the trappings of a rec- 
iprocal gift and became a more objective 
employer-employee relationship as a result of 
unionization, plantation owners gradually 
disengaged from their obligations to their 
workers. 
The lesson of Serro-Azul is that the con- 
cept of the market does not always go hand in 
hand with freedom. [|

The transnational nature of their activities

transporters as well as officials and other mid- 
dlemen. But the far-reaching ramifications of 
their trade, the ambivalent nature of certain

business centres straddling the border between 
two states, and the practice of corruption and 
smuggling made it possible for merchants to set 
up trade circuits that cluded state supervision. 
Long-distance 
trade 
There are two kinds of trading circuit. Locally 
grown farm produce is traded within small- 
scale networks based on towns and markets 
held at regular intervals. This type of trade 
may involved people living on either side of 
a state frontier. There are also long-distance 
circuits of transnational trade in locally pro- 
duced or imported agricultural and manufac- 
tured goods along routes linking Nigeria, 
Cameroon, Niger and Chad. 
The volume and nature of trade between 
these four countries is determined by three 
main factors: 
» Complementary needs resulting from eco- 
logical differences. Millet, sorghum, tubers and 
cola are imported by Niger and Chad from 
Nigeria and Cameroon, for example, in exchange 
for cattle, hides, leather, fish and natron. 
# The economic situation in each country. 
Compared with the other Chad basin coun- 
tries, Nigeria is an economic giant. Next in size 
comes Cameroon, followed by Niger and 
Chad, two landlocked countries of the Sahel 
which have few development resources. 
Nigeria's economic might is reflected in the 
diversity of its industries, its massive output 
and the fact that over 95 per cent of its export 
revenues comes from oil. 
# Political differences. These are mainly asso- 
ciated with agricultural policies, the regulation 
of foreign trade and the usc of two currencies 
in the region (the non-convertible Nigerian 
Naira, and the CFA franc, whose convert- 
ibility 1s guaranteed by the Bank of France). 
Irrespective of the enormous losses due 
to fraud in the different countries, the intensi- 
fication of regional and cross-border trade in 
the Chad basin has by and large encouraged 
the growth of agriculture, a parallel exchange 
market, transport, crafts and services. In farm- 
ing alone, by allowing certain areas to sell off 
their crop surpluses and others to reduce their 
subsistence crop deficits, this trade has become 
a factor in regional food security. The way in 
which food security stocks are regulated via 
the different trade circuits shows that the 
region’s economy has remained strongly inte- 
grated in spite of the way in which national 
frontiers are drawn. 
The Lake Chad basin is a crossroads of 
sub-regional trade that supplies the whole of 
Nigeria, Cameroon, Niger and Chad and 
other countries such as the Central African 
Republic. Its commercial dynamism is such 
that a kind of de facto integration is main- 
tained by local populations irrespective of 
what states might wish. [|

Bonnet. 
MICHELE DE LA PRADELLE

THE UNESCO Gurier B NOVEMBER 1906 
riday is market day in Carpentras. 
By seven o’clock in the morning 
the centre of this old town in 
southeast France, once sur- 
rounded by ramparts and today a 
complex of twisting alleyways and pretty lit- 
tle squares, is already humming with life as 
some 350 itinerant traders set up their stalls 
and the local tradespeople lay out their wares 
on the pavement in front of their shops. 
Motor traffic is forbidden and a throng of 
pedestrians 1s soon pushing its way between 
the stalls. From amidst a miscellany of food- 
stuffs, odours and colours, the hawkers shout 
to make themselves heard above the noise of 
the crowd. 
People do not come to the market at 
Carpentras for purely economic reasons, since 
its prices and its wares are pretty much the 
 
same as those in the local supermarkets. They 
come to enjoy the atmosphere, stroll around 
and meet other people. The market is a tem- 
porary melting-pot for North African immi- 
grants from the northern parts of the town, 
the local bourgeoisie, people from the sur- 
rounding countryside and, in summer, passing 
tourists and Parisians who own houses in the 
arca. As they walk through the town on mar- 
ket day, people visit neighbourhoods where 
perhaps they would never venture otherwise. 
For a few hours the market brings together 
social groups whose members do not nor- 
mally communicate because they live in dif- 
ferent parts of town and have different ways 
of life and cultural values. Market traders are 
the key players in setting up these encounters. 
Everything they do is designed to trans- 
form making a sale into an event. It is impos- 
sible for a customer to make a quick purchase 
and slip unobtrusively away. The trader sings 
out the order in a loud voice, lauds the qual- 
ity of his or her wares, makes nonsense of the 
usual customer-trader relationship and sets

the ball rolling for an exchange of views in 
which everyone around the stall is free to 
take part. 
The customers need no prompting to join 
in. Standing around the pork butchers van or 
the fishmonger’s counter, or just drifting 
through the crowd, you find yourself bump- 
ing into all kinds of people and creating “mar- 
ket relationships” that are distinct from any 
others in your everyday life, private or pro- 
fessional. Any pretext can be used to make 
contact and spark off a conversation: a com- 
ment about the weather (it’s about time we 
had some rain), a touch of rheumatism, the 
quality of the artichokes, how time flies. . . . 
In this type of situation, you talk for the 
sake of talking, to keep the conversation going. 
After the opening gambit, you find yourself 
making pseudo-confidences, treating some- 
one you have only known for five minutes as 
an old friend. You stick to generalizations and 
keep quiet about your real situation, which is 
often very different from that of the person 
you are talking to, and avoid subjects such as 
your children’s education, your garden, your 
house and housework. 
Local colour 
This sociability is the result of a common 
sense of belonging to the locality. When you 
go to the market in Carpentras, you reaffirm 
or lay claim to a collective identity. The mar- 
ket is one of the town’s institutions, and to 
buy your mullet or your olives there is a way 
of proving to yourself and of showing to oth- 
ers that you are a local—whether you really 
are or not. If you want to be “somebody” in 
France today, you have to be from “some- 
where”. If you make remarks that show your 
familiarity with the market—if you ask the 
butcher whether he still makes a certain kind 
of paté, for example—pcople will regard you 
as a regular. For Parisians who own property 
in the region, the market is an opportunity to 
build up their stock of local affiliations. 
This sociability cannot be divorced from 
the historical background of the market, 
which has been held in the same place on the 
same day for as far back as anyone can 
remember. The mere fact of buying your 
goat cheese and your shoelaces on the Place 
du Palais (a residence of the Avignon popes 
in the fourteenth century) has symbolic 
overtones. But it must be admitted that the 
traditional character of Carpentras market 
today is in some ways more apparent than 
real. A market of travelling stallholders like 
this one is full of reminders of a world that has 
disappeared. If you are not careful, the soil on 
the potatoes and the green sprigs sprouting 
from the carrots might make you think the 
hawker picked them only a few hours ago, at 
dawn in his garden. 
A taste of time gone by 
The municipal authorities, as well as the cus- 
tomers and the hawkers, also try to recreate 
the atmosphere of the market as it was in days 
gone by. The wares are grouped together by 
categories, as they were when the market was 
also a wholesale market divided into a corn 
market, a garlic market, a mulberry leaf mar- 
ket and other small trading posts where the 
region’s craft and farm produce were sold. 
The only surviving trace of this old 
arrangement is the truffle market, the biggest 
in France. It is attended by truffle brokers and 
preservers and by “rabassiers”—local people 
who look for truffles in their spare time with 
their dogs in the hills around Carpentras. It is 
a kind of secret ceremony, an unobtrusive 
sideshow to the main market, but it gives 
Carpentras market its touch of authenticity. 
For a few hours a week at least, the citi- 
zens of Carpentras enjoy feeling that they are 
shopping at a typical market of old Provence. 
In the name of a shared identity, and under 
the cover of anonymity they can practise a 
generalized friendship which is both joyful 
and feigned and has something in common 
with philia—the friendly spirit which 
Aristotle regarded as an essential component 
of a political community. |

A puzzling transition 
  
©
 
fter the collapse of the planned 
economy in the Soviet Union, 
reforms carried out in a diffi- 
cult economic environment 
got a mixed reception from the 
population. Many feared economic disaster 
and a massive explosion of popular discon- 
tent. Surveys have shown that anxiety about 
the future among the population peaked at 
the beginning of 1992. 
At the same time many were deluded into 
believing that privatization of the economy 
could be easily achieved and could enable the 
country to develop rapidly. Most inhabitants 
of the Soviet Union had no idea how market 
mechanisms and financial structures actually 
worked, how to exercise the right to prop- 
erty, how to accumulate capital or how to 
save. Moreover, the political situation and the 
BY YURI LEVADA 
balance of power within the regime made it 
impossible to carry out reforms as planned. 
Changes were made too slowly and chaoti- 
cally, so that they hurt the majority of the 
population. It took several years before the 
early enthusiasms and disappointments 
sparked by the market economy gave way to 
a more clear-sighted appraisal and a determi- 
nation to adjust to new conditions. 
Over the last few years public opinion has 
been divided as to the need to pursue eco- 
nomic reforms leading to a market economy. 
As the table on page 28 shows, almost half the 
population has no opinion as to whether or not 
the reforms should be pursued. The chief sup- 
porters of the reforms are the youngest and 
most educated strata of society living in the 
cities. These are people to whom the years of 
reform have given greater opportunities to use 
their own initiative, and who have remained 
extremely confident about future changes. 
The most resolute opponents of continued 
reforms are the over-fifty-fives, retired peo- 
ple and villagers, in other words those who 
have lost more than they have gained from the 
transition to a market economy. 
The wealthiest, and especially the new self- 
styled “businessmen” and “managers”, natu- 
rally welcome the market economy. Of those 
in the highest income bracket, 48 per cent are 
in favour of continued reforms and 17 per cent 
against, while a mere 20 per cent of those in 
low-income groups are in favour and 35 per 
cent are against. However, the great majority 
of those who have received a university or 
specialized education want to see reforms 
continue, even though many of them have 
experienced a fall in their standard of living 
since the beginning of the reforms because of

the crisis in higher education, science and 
industrial research. Despite that, they remain 
hopeful that the reforms will succeed. 
How fair is privatization? 
To judge from data provided by a series of 
public opinion polls carried out in 1995, 42 
per cent of the population regard an eco- 
nomic system based on state planning and 
distribution as “fairer”, while 37 per cent are 
in favour of a system based on private prop- 
erty and market forces. The rest are don’t- 
knows. (Some 9,600 people were polled.) The 
opinion of elderly people tips the balance in 
favour of a planned system. 
Today 26 per cent of Russians believe that 
most of their fellow citizens have already 
adjusted to the changes that have taken place, 
29 per cent think they will be able to adjust 
in the near future, and 32 per cent consider 
that they will never be able to do so. The 
remaining 13 per cent gave no definite 
answer. It 1s above all the younger, better 
educated and most active people who are 
prepared to adjust to the new conditions. 
Those who find it hardest to adjust to the 
changes are people who have difficulty in 
altering their customary way of life. They con- 
sist mainly of people living in Russian villages 
and small towns, who account for almost two- 
thirds of the population. The modernization of 
the farming sector entails massive investment 
that no one is in a position to make at present. 
So reforms aimed at steering that sector 
towards a market economy have run into con- 
siderable difficulty and have led to incompre- 
hension and even opposition on the part of 
much of the rural population. This is why pri- 
vate land ownership, to which democrats and 
reformers are seeking to give legal status, has 
the support of city-dwellers but is opposed by 
most of the rural population. 
Most of the population currently regard 
privatization of companies, banks and other 
activities as quite normal. Prejudice against 
wealthy landowners is far less widespread 
than it was a few years ago. Most people nev- 
ertheless feel that the biggest companies and 
the energy monopoly should remain in the 
hands of the state. The greatest resentment is 
directed at the right of foreigners to own land 
and large companies. Many still fear that for- 
eign capitalists want to appropriate the coun- 
try’s wealth. 
It is true that the Russian people’s relation- 
ship with the market economy goes further

than the subjective opinions and attitudes 
revealed by many public opinion polls. All 
those who are experiencing this on-going but 
very real transition towards a new economic 
situation are constantly having to define and 
appraise their position. Let us look at some of 
the main features of this complex situation. 
Coping with transition 
In Russia, about one-third of the working 
population are currently employed by the 
private sector, and one-sixth by state-owned 
joint-stock companies. But even the 50 per 
cent of the working population employed by 
public bodies and enterprises already live 
largely in a market economy environment 
and have to take account of its rules. 
The market economy has almost every- 
where put an end to the shortage of con- 
sumer goods that was the inevitable charac- 
teristic of the planned distribution system. 
The lack of staple commodities came top of 
the list of problems that most worried the 
population at the beginning of the 1990s, 
whereas today only a small percentage of 
people (7 per cent of 2,400 interviewees in 
May 1996) mention such shortages, which 
now come near the bottom of the list of what 
are regarded as acute problems. Today, the

most serious problems are considered to be 
phenomena resulting from the “transition to 
the market economy”, such as price rises (68 
per cent), crime (59 per cent), unemploy- 
ment (55 per cent) and falling production (55 
per cent). Some 60 per cent of the population 
feel that the quality of life is not now as high 
as it was five years ago. 
The borders of present-day Russia have 
opened up to the circulation of people, goods, 
information and (to a much lesser degree) cap- 
ital. The situation may be full of contradictions, 
but it marks an important stage in the transition 
of the Russian economy and society towards 
a market economy. Most Russians are in 
favour of these new opportunities, and 10 per 
cent of them take advantage of their freedom 
to go on business trips or holidays outside the 
borders of the former Soviet Union. At the 
same time, public opinion closely follows the 
constant debate in the mass media about the 
negative aspects of contact with the outside 
world, such as the flight of capital, the increas- 
ing importance of consumer goods, the inter- 
nationalization of organized crime, and civil 
service corruption. 
Most voters who took part in this year’s 
presidential elections and supported the win- 
ning candidate, Boris Yeltsin, came out in 
favour of retaining the achievements of the 
reforms and against a return to the past. 
Almost 80 per cent of those who voted for 
Yeltsin believe that the majority of the popu- 
lation has already adjusted, or will adjust in the 
very near future, to the reforms, and only 13 
per cent think that this will not happen. 
Conversely, only 35 per cent of those who 
voted for the unsuccessful communist candi- 
date think that people will adjust to the 
changes, while 49 per cent of them believe it to 
be impossible. For the time being, then, reac- 
tions to the reforms remain very clear-cut 
across the spectrum of society as a whole. H

Japan’s market economy and are 
regarded as legal entities in their 
own right. The main share-hold- 
ers in large businesses are not 
individuals but interdependent companies 
with cross-holdings in each other. I call this 
system “company capitalism”. 
Individuals, companies and the state are 
the three main components of a market econ- 
omy. A study of this market calls for analysis 
of the relations between companies and indi- 
viduals, between companies themselves, and 
between companies and the state. One feature 
of Japanese company capitalism is that the vol- 
ume of trade between companies is far greater 
than that between companies and individuals, 
 
Company capitalism 
or between companies and the state. This is 
one of the characteristics of Japanese com- 
pany capitalisin. Furthermore, private enter- 
prise is by far the largest source of the nation’s 
wealth. Businesses have a massive superiority 
over individuals, which they dominate or 
“envelop”. 
On the market for manufactured goods, 
which is dominated, as in the United States 
and Europe, by an oligopoly of large corpo- 
rations, prices, quality and services are 
imposed by companies on individuals—on 
what is clearly not an equal footing. 
Many products (notably in the automobile 
and electrical goods sectors) are distributed 
according to the keiretsu system (keiretsu arc 
vertically integrated groups of companies). »

### 104878: Company capitalism

Manufacturers form keiretsu with whole- 
salers and retailers. They give orders and try 
to fix prices. The big retailers such as super- 
markets compete with this form of distribu- 
tion by selling at rock-bottom prices, but 
they keep well in with the manufacturers all 
the same. 
The primacy of the company over the indi- 
vidual is most apparent on the job market. The 
distinctive features of Japanese management 
are “a job for life, wages based on length of ser- 
vice, and company unions”, but since relations 
between businesses and individuals are not on 
an equal footing, the job-for-life system means 
that the individual is absorbed by the com- 
pany. Take the question of recruitment. On 
April 1st each year, all companies hire new 
graduates at the same time, going on to give 
them in-house training and teach them the 
company culture. Each recruit is given a post 
and then moves around within the company 
according to its staffing rota. Recruits get “a 
company” rather than “a job”. In this context 
the market mechanism does not function and 
the job market is non-existent. The company 
calls the tune. 
In theory the unions act as a counterweight 
to the company, but Japanese unions are orga- 
nized within companies, and not grouped by 
trades or branches. In other words they are 
not a strong force of opposition, and in fact, 
companies use unions to implement their 
staffing and other policies. The basic principle 
of company capitalism is that the company 
comes first. The staff is a hundred per cent 
loyal to the company, and even business chiefs 
outside the company but associated with it are 
under its control. 
THe unesco (Qurier m NOVEMBER 1906 
Managers of affiliates meet 
at their parent company’s 
Kyoto Headquarters. 
 
Direct transactions are the most common 
form of trade between businesses. A com- 
pany chooses a business partner from among 
a mass of potential partners, and then trading 
conditions are decided on. This system pro- 
duces latent competition between businesses, 
but it cannot be said that the market mecha- 
nism functions fully in it. 
Big business 
and the banks 
In order to choose their partners in these 
direct transactions, companies join up in asso- 
ciations of two main kinds: keiretsu (groups 
of affiliated companies) and conglomerates 
(large industrial groups). Conglomerates are 
large corporations linked horizontally, each 
one having many affiliated companies. The 
companies within each conglomerate are 
interdependent via cross-holdings. A club of 
the managing directors of the main compa- 
nies meets regularly. Business between the 
companies within the conglomerates is co- 
ordinated by sogo shosha (trading companies), 
which play a pivotal role. 
Whereas trade within the keiretsu results 
from a unilateral decision by the parent com- 
pany, in the industrial conglomerates it is car- 
ried out between big companies on a recipro- 
cal basis. This system docs not totally exclude 
outsiders nor apply to all transactions, but the 
fact remains that the mechanism of the market 
economy as described in neoclassical eco- 
nomic theory does not function here. 
“A business without a lead bank does not 
exist,” they say in Japan. As a rule, this bank 
is the main provider of capital for its business 
partners, for which it is responsible. If the lat- 
ter go bankrupt, the bank accepts responsi- 
bility for their debts and acquires the bonds it 
has issued. It is also a major shareholder in 
these businesses, which have shares in the 
bank. So this is a system of cross-holdings. 
For the keiretsu, the conglomerates and 
the lead banks, share ownership is the best 
way of bringing companies together. In Japan, 
banks and finance companies own almost 70 
per cent of the shares in all companies quoted 
on the stock market. Share ownership is lim- 
ited by an anti-trust law, however. The banks 
are not entitled to hold more than 5 per cent 
of the shares issued by a company. 
Companies hold shares in each other in 
order to exercise mutual control and create the 
conditions for long-term trading between

them (“compulsory” trading which flies in the 
face of the principles of the market economy). 
But this is also a way of preventing take-overs 
through share purchases by outside compa- 
nies. After the liberalization of capital move- 
ments in the 1960s, big Japanese companies 
organized large-scale stability operations by 
their shareholders in order to prevent foreign 
capital from taking over their companies. 
. Business 
and the state 
These operations had some harmful effects 
on the health of companies and particularly 
made it more difficult to restructure them. 
The banks and the big companies were over- 
come by a fever of speculation in shares and 
land. A monetary “bubble” appeared and 
grew until it burst in the early 1990s when 
there was a sudden collapse in share and land 
prices. The decline of Japanese company cap- 
italism had begun.

prising the political world, the higher civil ser- 
vice and the financial world. In this context, 
the financial world means the grouping of big 
business leaders, who dominate the economy 
and are linked to the state, which has made 
possible the strong growth of the Japanese 
economy by giving priority to business and 
setting up many aid and protection policies. 
This policy to encourage the development 
of private enterprise in the finance, services 
and other sectors has often been imple- 
mented via administrative directives, inde- 
pendent of legislation, and this has given 
Japanese bureaucrats far-reaching powers. 
The troika system has led to financial support 
being given to a political party and to appoint- 
ments for top civil servants in the private sec- 
tor, where they embark on a second career. 
These links have led to collusion between 
politicians, higher civil servants and business, 
which has given rise to scandals and corrup-

Compared to countries with a socialist 
tradition such as the Soviet Union and China, 
and to the countries of Western Europe, the 
economic clout of nationalized industries in 
Japan is relatively light and the state sector is 
less important. In this respect the Japanese 
economy is a market economy and not a 
planned economy. It could, however, be 
described as a market economy directed by 
the state since private business is so closely 
tied to the state. 
A turning point

the problems raised by the direct investment

1980s. Japan’s trade surplus with the United 
States has also become a major political prob- 
lem, and there have been many cases of fric- 
tion between Japan and the United States in 
the field of co-operation on Japanese- 
American structural problems. 
Company capitalism is showing its limits. 
Where relations between business and indi- 
viduals on the market for manufactured goods 
are concerned, oligopolistic domination is 
becoming hard pressed, notably because of the 
increasing amount of goods imported from 
abroad. As far as the labour market is con-

cerned, the job-for-life system and Japanese- 
style recruitment are starting to lose ground. 
The unions are still company unions and they 
continue to give priority to the company, but 
their members are less and less interested and 
the rate of unionization is going down. 
In relations between companies, it can be 
seen that the justification for keiretsu 1s getting 
weaker and that companies are starting to leave 
them. The necd for conglomerates is also start- 
ing to weaken now that industrial structures are 
moving away from the model of heavy indus- 
try and the chemical industry. Even the cross- 
holding system is becoming less widespread. 
The institution of the lead bank is also run- 
ning out of steam. Since the 1980s, the busi- 
ness finance system has diversified. Cross- 
holding by companies is starting to be a 
handicap for industrialists, and some compa- 
nies are selling their shares to generate profit. 
With regard to relations between the state 
and business, deregulation has been a major 
government trend in the 1990s. After the 
appearance of splits in the structure of the 
politics-civil service-finance troika (political 
scandals, end of single-party domination), it 
became increasingly difficult to preserve the 
control system which these three entities 
exercised by mutual support. 
How will the Japanese-style market econ- 
omy develop? Towards an “Anglo-Saxon” 
type of market economy or towards some- 
thing entirely new? I would be inclined to say 
that the twenty-first century will not be an age 
of big companies or of joint stock companies. 
Companies will not disappear as such. They 
will still even be the mainspring of the econ- 
omy. But because industrial structures will be 
increasingly different from those of heavy 
industry and the chemical industry, big com- 
panies involved in mass production will lose 
ground to small and medium-sized businesses 
headed by industrialists of a different kind. I 
sce them as being efficiently interlinked by 
networks and not by the keiretsu and con- 
glomerate system. 
Individualism, an unusual phenomenon 
for Japan, will emerge in relations between 
businesses and people and replace the princi- 
ple of company supremacy. A co-operative 
structure or perhaps some radically different 
system may take the place of joint stock com- 
panies. These companies will not disappear, 
but maybe they will have to coexist with 
many other forms of business. N

to morc flexible and productive methods 
enhanced by new technologics—in other 
words, in leaving the era of mechanization 
and entering the era of automatization. 
Some cconomists argue that what is really 
at stake in the relocation process is not so 
much the ability to withstand competition 
from low-wage countries as the ability to cap- 
ture market share in sophisticated products 
and leading-edge technologies. According to 
that argument, the real problems have been 
masked by lumping together the axing of jobs 
and the redeployment of production. 
The Washington accords 
Under a system of fixed exchange rates, 
exchange mechanisms play only a secondary 
role. The development of international rela- 
tions and the general liberalization of capital 
movements have ushered in a new mecha- 
nism in exchange rate formation. Since the 
Washington accords of December 1971, 
which caused the collapse of the international 
monetary system established at Bretton 
Woods in 1944 (under which cach currency 
had a fixed parity expressed in gold), most 
states have stopped sctting the official value 
of their currency. The observed or antici- 
pated evolution of rates is far more influential 
than the value of the currency. 
One last unwelcome effect that financial 
globalization and deregulation have had is to 
introduce a considerable element of fragility 
into the world cconomy. Macroeconomic 
trends seem to be influenced more by the 
opinion of the market than by political deci- 
sions for which governments arc accountable 
to their voters. Worse, financial reactions can 
degenerate into cumulative trends, whether 
downward or upward, and as a result send 
prices spiralling into regions that bear no rela- 
tion to basic economic facts, since markets are 
incapable of self-regulation. Every twenty-four 
hours, more than a trillion dollars move around 
the world seeking the highest yield. This flow 
of capital “has opened the world to the opera- 
tion of a global financial market that leaves even 
the strongest countries with limited autonomy 
over interest rates, exchange rates or other 
financial policies,” UNDP reports.

inharmonious economic development which

tock exchanges, also known as 
bourses, came into being in Europe in 
the middle of the sixteenth century 
when, in conjunction with markets and 
trade fairs, places were created for 
transactions involving letters of credit and shares in 
trading companies. The term “bourse” is thought to 
have been first used in 1549 in Bruges (in present-day 
Belgium) and to be derived from the Van der Blirse fam- 
ily, whose town house was used by dealers trading in 
realestate securities. 
Until the late nineteenth century, Bruges, Antwerp, 
Lyons, Amsterdam, Paris and London were succes- 
sively the leading financial markets. Their role at the 
heart of the capitalist system was to provide a meet- 
ing place between savers (private individuals and 
banks) and investors {states and businesses). 
There are two main kinds of securities, shares and 
bonds. Shares represent a portion of a company's 
capital and offer a return (dividends) that varies in 
accordance with the company’s profits. Bonds, on the 
other hand, are securities issued for a certain period 
of time, guaranteeing fixed interest earnings for their 
holders. Prices go up or down in accordance with sup- 
ply and demand and are subject to speculation. 
In the twentieth century the world's stock 
exchanges have made an important contribution to the 
financing of national economies. New York's Wall Street 
(U.S.A.) is the leading financial market today, in com- 
petition with the stock exchanges of Asia (especially 
Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore) and Europe 
(Frankfurt, London and Paris). On these increasingly 
globalized financial markets, which are developing more 
and more complex products, the trade in securities is 
influenced by economic, monetary, political and psy- 
chological factors. 
These markets are sometimes criticized as func- 
tioning like a “financial bubble”, generating purely spec- 
ulative profits which are unrelated to the development 
of the so-called “real” economy, i.e. industry, trade and 
services. ||

THE UNESCO Guricra NOVEMBER 1996 
Itis impossible to be indifferent to the situation of opera 
in the world today. In the eighteenth and nineteenth 
centuries, this art form whieh blends in a snblime 
alchemy the hnman voice, instrumental music and 
visual effects enchanted the courts and theatres of 
England, Germany, Spain and France. The great oper- 
atic works of the last four centuries were moments of 
perfection in the story of musical creation. Down 
through the ages, Monteverdi, Lully, Scarlatti, Ilandel, 
Rameau, Gluck, Mozart, Beethoven, Wagner, Verdi, 
Berlioz, Bizet and Glinka absorbed the heritage of the 
past and went on to break new ground. Whatever the 
dramatic subject matter, whatever the form, they 
brought creative magic to it. 
Cassandras predicted that opera would die in the 
twentieth century, and it is true that for more than half 
a century cinema and television have replaced opera as 
a leading source of popular entertainment. Opera is 
prohibitively expensive to produce and is dependent on 
public or private sponsorship, yet it remains the dreamn- 
medium for most contemporary composers and still has 
a public following. I observed this recently in the arena 
of Verona in Italy with a production of Bizet’s Carmen, 
directed by the master Franco Zeffirelli and conducted 
by Daniel Oren. 
lt is impossible, too, not to think of the great voices 
that over the past forty years have brought new authen- 
ticity and grandeur to opera. Audiences marvel at the 
purity of their timbre, their elegance of phrasing and 
their perfect sense of style. I think especially of 
Monserrat Caballé, Placido Domingo, Barbara 
Ilendricks and José Carreras, who have done me the 
honour of joining UNESCO's group of Goodwill 
Ambassadors. They defend the ideals of UNESCO, espe- 
cially in the eontext of exchanges between cultures, in 
training young people and encouraging their involve-

### 104895: Poetry, an education in freedom

to whieh I am particularly attached and which I dis- 
cussed at length with the Verona authorities: the cre- 
ation of an international institute for opera and poetry. 
The future Institute will be a place to meet and 
exchange ideas, to discuss current developments in 
opera, its future, its response to new technology, and 
the training of young people. Leading experts will be 
able to contribute a spirit of scientific rigour and a mass 
of specialized data and knowledge. It hardly needs to 
he said that special attention will be paid to the tradi- 
tions of non-European opera, whether from Beijing, 
Java or Bali. 
The Institute’s other component will be devoted to 
“the world of poctry. Whatever official functions I 
oceupy in my working life, in the silenee of the evening 
and morning I always return to poetry. I can only live 
and I wish only to live in the space and freedom of 
poetry. Poetry is an education in freedom. Despite the 
barriers and the inequalities that continue to exist in the 
world (and I sce them at first hand when traveling for 
UNESCO), itis writers, poets, novelists and thinkers who 
do most to change ways of thinking, banish taboos and 
undermine prejudices. Fanned to a white heat, words 
have the power to melt chains. Sometimes the word is 
all powerful. 
All my thoughts are linked to a culture of peace, 
which I think brings me close to the original flame of 
UNESCO, to the soul of this intellectual and moral arm 
of the United Nations system. It is my belief that poetry 
brings its pure grist to the mill of an ethical system that 
must be rethonght. Is it futile to dream of a different 
kind of society, one capable of engendering a new 
humanity and perpetuating harmonious human rela- 
tionships? Is it mad to want to put an end to a lethally 
destructive praetice (war) and reinvent another prac- 
tice (peace) that takes experience into account? The 
poetry I love is not an empty game. It is an inner link 
between poetics, ethics and politics. 
Ihistory—the history of humanity and the history of 
language—is an unending process. The poet must be a 
catalyst in the renewal of active thinking and the values 
that are an honour to our species and urge us constantly 
to exceed our own sclf-expeetations. Poetry is a bulwark 
against the onslaught of barbarity in its many guises: ide- 
ologieal and technological aberrations, violenee, nation- 
alism, religious and political fanaticism, racism, intoler- 
ance and selfishness. Why appeal to poetry, timeless, 
immaterial and weaponless that it is? The answer is that 
in poetry the word is brought to an incandescent heat 
and speaks to each and every one of us. It pulverizes 
injustice and hatred; it is akin to love. Yes, poetry is an 
Ark of the Covenant, our Ark of the Covenant. For all 
of us, poet and reader alike, poetry ean make sense of 
the world, with all its obseure mysteries, great contra- 
dictions and sublime achievements. 
“The dream within me 
I shall keep 
as long as I breathe. 
This dream 
is my life, 
a dream of love 
alive at last 
in each one of us.”

Greenwatch 
um CAVYVELARD 
by France Bequette 
Once upon a time Pele the fire god- 
dess, daughter of Moe-moea-aun-li 
the troublemaker and Haumea the 
Earth-mother, was travelling in 
search of a plaee to settle. She tried 
each of the Illawaiian Islands, one 
after the other, hut whenever she 
sank her magic spade into the carth 
to dig a fire pit, she was too close to 
the sea and the waves came and 
extinguished the flames. Then, at 
long last, she found her dream home 
on Kilauea volcano in the southeast 
corner of the Island of ITawaii, some- 
times called the Big Island. 
Native Ilawaiians are attached to 
their traditions, and still offer their 
goddess meat, fish, fruit and flowers, 
which they lay on the edge of 
Ialemaumau crater, a saered place in 
their island chain. This sanctuary is 
located inside Hawaii Volcanoes 
National Park, which was created by 
a decree of the U.S. Congress in 1961

A river of lava oozes from Kilauea, an 
active volcano on the island of Hawaii. 
and in 1980 became a UNESCO Dios- 
plicre reservel. The Park’s status 
does not prevent the local people 
from practising their traditions there. 
Native ltawaiians who regularly go 
there do not have to pay the $5 
entrance fee, they can pick the med- 
icinal plants they need, and the 
women are allowed to purify them- 
selves in the hot springs. 
The Garden of Eden 
About two million people visit the 
Park each year. There are excellent 
faeilities for welcoming them. 
Exhibitions and fim projections are 
held at a large Visitor Centre which 
also contains a mass of documentary 
material and proposes theme-related 
guided tours. A network of asphalted 
roads enables tourists to skirt the 
edge of Kilauea or travel down to the

sea. The diversity of landscapes is

amazing, and trails for walkers fan 
out in all directions. As the sun beats 
down, you pass by smoking, silver- 
grey craters, orange hanks of sulphur, 
and mineral deserts and luxuriant 
forests where towering ferns mingle 
with the dark foliage of the trees. 
Visitors can climb 4,170-metre-high 
Mauna Loa (the “Great Mountain”) 
that has been built up by a sueces- 
sion of lava flows and whose perfectly 
rounded summit is sometimes cov- 
ered in snow. 
This remote Pacific archipelago 
of 124 islands, islets and atolls, 
including eight main islands, emerged 
from the ocean 70 million years ago 
Dut it was not until 1,600 years ago 
that its first human inhabitants— 
Polynesians from the Marquesas 
Islands—arrived. The new settlers 
found plants and insects that had 
been carried to the islands by the 
wind, birds or sea, but no predatory 
land mammals. This was a decisive

factor, for in the absence of preda- 
tors, neither plants nor animals devel- 
oped unnecessary systems of defence. 
Before mosquitoes came to the 
islands as clandestine passengers on 
the first sailing ships, the small bird 
called the red apapane (Ilimatione 
sanguinea) had developed no immn- 
nity to malaria. Avian malaria now 
takes its toll. Mint and sage had no 
need of strong, protective odours 
hefore the introduction of goats. 
Park offieials are doing their best 
to save the the state bird, the nene 
‘or Ilawaiian goose (Brante sandvi- 
censis), from extinction, Ameriean 
zoologist Stuart Pimm calculates 
that at Icast 101 bird species have 
disappeared from Ilawaii since 
humans settled there. 
Internal enemies 
ITawaii’s isolation explains why the 
islands are home to an extraordinar- 
ily large number of endemic plants: 
93 per cent of some 1,000 recorded 
species are found nowhere else in 
the world, but they are vulnerable to 
feral pigs (Sus scrofa) and other 
browsing animals. Aceording to 
botanist Charles Lamoureux, dire c- 
tor of Honelulu’s Lyon Arboretum, 
about half the plants should he con- 
sidered endangered, even if they do 
not yet figure on official lists. 
There are also 5,000 species 
brought from outside, 25 of which 
are especially destruetive, The worst 
offenders arc the firctree (Myrica 
faya) from the Canary Islands, the 
strawberry gnava (Psidivin cat- 
tleianum) a tree [rom Brazil, the 
banana poka vine (Passiflore molis- 
sima) from Sonth America, and

“Coster’s enrse” (Clidemia hirta) a 
shrub from Central America. They 
all proliferate, smothering native 
plants. But war has been declared on 
them. In one case, an inscet has heen 
imported from the Canary Islands 
in order to combat its compatriot 
plant, the firetree, but results are 
slow in coming. A botanist with the 
National Park, Linda Pratt, tried 
various herbicides, hut itis an uphill 
job because of the risk of destroying 
innocuons plants and polluting the 
water. Widespread “Wanted Dead 
or Alive” posters display the name 
and photo of the miconia, a prolific 
tree that must be destroyed before it 
overrnns theisland, as itis threaten- 
ing to do in Tahiti (French Polynesia) 
where it has already invaded three- 
quarters of the wooded area. 
Protecting the park also means 
eliminating certain species of land 
mammals that were introduced by 
humans. To do so, Park Superinten- 
dent Jim Martin has taken the unnsual 
step of enrolling the lelp of poach- 
ers. Some may feel sad about getting 
rid of feral cats, but they plunder the 
cges and young of a threatened 
species, the dark-rumped petrel 
(Pterodrome phaeopygia sandvi- 
censis). Feral goats were virtually 
eradicated with the help of local 
lunters. Their nnuber kas fallen from 
15,000 in 1980 to less than 100. 
Although 11,000 feral pigs were 
killed between 1930 and 1970, it 
is estimated that around 4,000 still 
survive. 
Tu addition to hnnting, building 
fences is a good, albeit costly solu- 
tion. Jim Martin says that money is 
lacking. There are only eight 
rangers, whereas from fifteen to 
twenty are needed for proper sur- 
veillance. The Park can no longer 
afford to pay researchers. Those 
who come to study there belong to 
outside organizations. In protest, the 
Park closed down in November 1995 
but had to re-open after three weeks 
when the public, which had initially 
been supportive, lost patience. 
The situation is particularly wor- 
risome becanse the Park is in a dan- 
gerous area. Coastal cliffs ernmble, 
and lava can erupt at any moment, 
since Mauna Loa and Kilauea are two 
of the world’s most active volcanoes. 
Cuttings had to be made in some of 
the most recent lava flows in order to 
re-open some of the roads. 
Uses and abuses 
Although Volcanoes Park is a well- 
defined central area of the Big 
Island, maps do not yet show either 
the buffer or the intermediate zones 
required by a biosphere reserve. Jim 
Martin explains that there is an 
understanding with the federal 
prison and the private lands that bor- 
der the park and that a development 
plans being worked out. New build- 
ings in a nearby village will blend with 
the forest and cause no damage. 
A more serious problem arises 
[rom the fact that Hawaii has been in 
a catastrophic economic situation 
since the collapse of world sugar 
prices. Sugar cane fields have been 
abandoned, and jobless labourers are 
growing marijnana even inside the 
park boundaries. By clearing forest 
land for their erops and protecting

» them with lethal traps, they are 
endangering the ecosystem. Heavy 
fines and long prison sentences, how- 
ever, have helped to improve the 
sitnation. 
But this is not all. Tree ferns are 
being cut down with chainsaws and 
hanled away in truck loads and, 
despite the presenee of surveillance 
eameras, vandals are stealing archae- 
ological treasures. The Park was 
included on UNEscO’s World Heritage 
Listin 1987 and contains once-inhah- 
ited caves, vestiges of villages and 
fragile petroglyphs, some of which 
have recently heen covered over by a 
lava flow. 
The Hawaiian Volcano Obser- 
vatory, founded in 1912 and located 
within the park on the edge of the 
Kilauea caldera, plays a major role in 
running the park. Ground deforma- 
tion, gas emissions, changes in the elec- 
trical, magnetic and gravitational 
fields and lava movements are closely 
initiatives 
monitored in an attempt to anticipate 
dangerous seismic activity. Lava is at

Carrots and DDT 
Visalia is a small farming community in California (USA) about half way between San Francisco 
and Los Angeles. Near its tiny airport is a field surrounded by a tall fence with unusual signs 
attached to it at regular intervals. The signs show a carrot and two sentences in the Miao language. 
Back in 1947 a crop-dusting company set up shop in a corner of the airport. From 1946 
to 1972 DDT pesticide was the most widely used insect-killer in the world. Since 1973, how- 
ever. it has been banned in the United States. Stored 
in drums on the ground, the DDT was transferred to 
the tanks of the crop-dusting bi-planes. which were 
then rinsed out after each sortie. The empty drums 
were stacked up in a basin. 
In 1984 the American Department of Health 
inspected the land. The crop-dusting company had 
long since disappeared, but not the DDT residue that 
      was discovered in the soil. Fortunately it was neither

dard solutions seemed very suitable: stripping the soil 
and treating it thermically would have cost $2 million. Dumping it in an uninhabited area would 
have required constant supervision, 
Then, engineer Dennis Keller came up with the idea of planting carrots. It is true that cach 
crop costs $170,000 (still less expensive than heat treatment), but the carrots suck up 50 per 
cent of the DDT remaining in the soil. Carrots. especially the large French variety called 
Scarlet of Nantes are the only vegetable able to concentrate this kind of pesticide in its tis- 
sue, not just its skin, as was generally believed, but in its core and roots too. The carrots are 
then dried out and burned. Dennis Keller says that the carrot idea is also being used to clean 
up DDT in Australia. 
As for the fenced-in area and its strange signs, put up in 1992, they are there to prevent 
the Miaos, refugees from the Vietnamese war. from poaching the carrots. The land must wait 
a certain amount of time before being handed over to promoters. The admissible DDT level 
of 1.4 mg. per kg of earth has not yet been attained. x

THE MIGHTY 
SHRIMP 
Land-owners, road builders and 
developers in the state of 
California (U.S.A.) are up in 
arms at the federal government, 
which has effectively put mil- 
lions of hectares of and off-lim- 
its to development by refusing 
to take the fairy-shrimp, a small 
evustacean, off the endangered 
species list. In 1978 a biologist 
estimated that Y0 per cent of 
the shrimp's habitat had heen 
lost, a claim denied by other 
experts, who assert that the tiny 
creature is actually flourishing. 
In 1995 a thousand Californians 
joined in a demonstration to 
demand the removal of the tiny 
freshwater shrimp from the list 
of threatened species. According 
to California’s Governor what is 
endangered is not the fairy 
shrimp but the state’s economic 
development. [| 
INSECT OPERA 
ON CD 
320 million years ago, insect 
sounds were already to be heard 
rising from the ferns of the car- 
boniferous period. Although 
many people today are familiar 
with the singing of criekets, 
cicadas and grasshoppers, other 
insects, like the termite, the ant 
or the weevil, produce love calls, 
threats and courtship or aecep- 
tance noises that are inandible 
to the human ear because they 
are too weak and/or too high 
(ultrasounds) or low (infra- 
sounds). Now, thanks to highly 
sophistieated recording tech- 
mques, the sounds of 50 inscet 
species found in France have 
been recorded and made audible 
on a compact disk. Presented as 
an opera, the disk is acconmpa- 
nied by a 200-page explanatory 
“libretto” and colour photos.

CLEANSING 
SEED 
British ~~ rescarcher Geoff 
Folkard has recently confirmed 
scientifically that the seeds of

a purifying eflcct, something 
which has long been known in 
certain African countries. When 
pressed, the seeds liberate pro- 
teins that draw baeteria, viruses 
and other water-borne micro- 
organisms Lo them like magnets. 
The pollutants buneh up and 
can then be got rid of simply by 
filtering the water. Moringa 
oleifera’s virtues do not stop 
there. Not only can the tree 
grow in poor soil, its leaves and 
flowers are filled with vitamins 
and other nutritious substances. 
hs seeds also provide oil for

### 104897: Baroque churches of the Philippines

  
‘HERITAGE 
arogue churches 
of the Philippines 
by Augusto Fabella Villalon 
An original form of religious architecture arose when European baroque came to the Philippines 
Flanked with 
massive anti- 
earthquake 
buttresses, St. 
Augustine's 
church at Paoay 
(llocos Norte 
province) is a 
remarkable 
example of what 
has been called 
“seismic 
baroque”, 
  
Five hundred years ago, when Spain 
was at the height of her power, the 
Philippines were the Spanish 
empire’s easternmost fringe. The jour- 
ney from Madrid to the faraway 
colony took many months. A trans- 
Atlantic crossing to South America 
was followed by an overland journey to 
Acapulco in Mexico, and then a voyage 
across the Pacilic from Acapulco to 
Manila, the Philippine eapital. 
From the sixteenth to the nine- 
teenth centuries, many Spanish fri- 
ars embarked on this hazardous 
journey in order to spread the word 
of God in their country’s Asian out- 
THE UNESCO Curirn NOVEMBER 1996 
post. When they arrived in the 
Philippines, they discovered an agri- 
cultural aud seafaring society. 
People lived in huts built of bam- 
boo, rattan and palm elustered along 
the seashore or on river hauks. The 
huts were raised above the ground 
on stilts to preveut damage from sea- 
sonal flood waters and looked like 
large baskets cradled on poles. 
Although they responded per- 
feetly to the tropical island environ- 
ment, these traditional dwellings were 
not intended to last forever. They 
burned quickly and were casily blown 
away by the typhoons that came 
 
PADAY 
SANTA MARIA 
WAGAD 
yearly. Constructed out of light, ten- 
sile materials, they swayed during 
gentle earth tremors but collapsed 
with the onset of the powerful earth- 
(quakes that periodically ravaged the 
country. However, fashioned as they 
were out of natural materials that 
grew abundantly near the villages, 
they could soon be rebuilt. 
The Spanish friars, used to large, 
lofty, strong stone churches built to 
last for a thousand years, did not 
regard these impermanent struc- 
tures as proper dwellings for Ged. 
They introduced the Western eon- 
cept of permanence in architecture 
to the Philippines, and also the use 
of stone for building. 
The friars directed teams of 
skilled Filipino and Chinese crafts- 
men who were unaware of Western 
construction techniques and the for- 
malistic sensibilities of ceclesiastical 
art. The construction of a church 
was a community effort, and ost 
churches in the Philippines cannot

captured the imagination of the 
Filipinos. A highly individualistic 
variant of Spanish colonial arehi- 
tecture, it became an enduring, but 
today severely endangered, testi- 
mony to the interaction that suc- 
cessfully integrated two diverse cul- 
tures, uniting the visual sensibilities 
of West and East. 
In 1993, the following four archi- 
tecturally outstanding Spanish 
Colonial churches of the Philippines 
the World were included on 
ITeritage List. 
The church of St. Augustine 
(Paoay, Ilocos Norte province) 
Built in 1710 by the Augnstinians, 
this ensemble of church and 
detached bell tower standing on the 
edge of a broad plaza is majestic in 
scale. Its triangular, pedimented 
facade of soft stone, plain at the bot- 
tom, is decorated with light, clegant 
carving near the top of the pediment, 
which is edged with a row of stone 
finials (pinnacle ornaments) like 
feathers delicately brushing the sky. 
Thick perpendicular stone but- 
tresses protrude from the church 
wall to protect the main strneture 
from earthquakes. The buttresses 
are designed as huge double volutes 
(swirl forms}, and their interplay of 
curves and counter-curves gives an 
nnpression of magical lightness. 
Reinforcing the Oriental flavour, 
the bell tower situated a short dis- 
A] 
tance away from the principal 
church structure tapers slightly 
upwards in layers reminiseent of a 
pagoda. lts side entrances are 
flanked by floral motifs carved with 
a [luidity accentuated by elouds 
floating above them. The ethereal 
grace of the facade softens the heavy 
architectural elements, and the 
visual reference linking the archi- 
teeture to the great Indonesian 
shrine of Borobudur brings an 
Oriental aspect to the Catholic rit- 
uals performed inside the church. 
The church of Our Lady 
of the Assumption 
(Santa Maria, Ilocos Sur province) 
This ensemble of chinreh and parish 
residence built by the Augnstinians 
overlooks the town of Santa Maria 
from a platform atop a [ight of 
eighty-five steps made of wide gran- 
ite blocks imported from China. 
Instead of its facade, it presents its 
austere, almost windowless sides to 
the town below. The residence, con- 
nected by an arcaded bridge to the 
church structure, faces the church 
and completes the architectural 
ensemble. As with the church of St. 
Augustine at Paoay, buttresses swirl 
upwards to reinforce the side walls 
against earthquake damage. The 
detached pagoda-like bell tower 
stands a short distance from the main 
facade to prevent it [rom falling on

Maria ensemble lies in its hilltop set- 
ting. The church buildings implanted 
solidly above the town resemble a for- 
tified medieval citadel. 
The church of St. Augustine 
(Intramuros, Manila) 
Built in 1587 under the direction of 
Augustinians, this is the oldest exist- 
ing stone church in the Philippines 
and oue of few examples of ecclesi- 
astical architecture in the Intramuros,

Completed in 1797, this church is 
one of the most lyrical, exuherant 
examples of Philippine culture’s 
translation of Western baroque design 
principles into a hybrid local style. 
Constructed on arise overlooking the 
sea, the church originally served as a 
fortress to proteet the villagers from 
pirate raids. Its basic architectural 
composition follows the Philippine 
archetype of a simply roofed, solid 
and squat rectangular structure. A 
pedimented fagade was grafted onto 
the front of the otherwise plain struc- 
ture. A pair of squat, non-symmetri- 
cal bell towers, which also once acted 
as lookout towers to alert the villagers 
in times of danger, taper upwards 
from a square base. The two towers, 
although of unequal height, provide 
a strong upward thrust while visu- 
ally anchoring each side of the 
fagade. On the fagade itself, heavily

### 104898: The Hidden voice of Federico Mompou

A modern Catalan composer whose work deserves to be better known 
The hidden voice of 
Federico Mompou 
Federico Mompou i Dencausse (1893-1987) 
is an emblematic fignre of Catalan music. 
He was not, as some have claimed, a some- 
what precious miniaturist or a poor man’s 
Debussy, but one of the most unusual and 
important Spanish composers of his time. 
Ilis work consists largely of short pieces 
for piano and voice, but he also wrote for 
guitar, I'rench horn, organ and chamber 
orchestra. Mompou’s mnsie, often melan- 
choly in tone, and tinged with a poetry that 
is at once concise and visionary, reaches 
the deepest, most secret recesses of the 
listener’s sensibility. 
“The mystery of Mompou cludes us as 
soon as we try to label it or fit it into reflex- 
ive categories,” wrote the French philoso- 
pher Vladimir Jankéléviteh, “But we can 
perceive that secrct and inimitable voice, 
which is the very voice of silence: we hear 
that voice with the ear of the soul when 
‘loneliness becomes music’.”! In the [our 
volumes of his restrained and unadorned 
musical testament, Musica Callada (Music 
that Falls Silent, 1959-67), which was 
inspired by the great Spanish mystic, St. 
John of the Cross, Mompou achieves max- 
imum expression with a minimum of means. 
The music in it is silent, he said, because “it 
is heard internally. Its emotion is secret, 
and beeomes sound only by reverberatingin 
the coldness of our solitude.” 
Mompou, the contemporary of another 
great Catalan artist, Joan Miro, whose 
enthusiasm and freshness of inspiration 
were similar to his own, was born in 
Barcelona on 16 April 1893, to a mother of 
French descent and a Catalan father. Ile 
_ was fascinated during his childhood—the 
memory was to haunt him all his life—by 
the sound of the hells in his grandfather’s 
foundry. He studied the piano at the 
Conservatori del Liceu in Barcelona and 
attended concerts by the greatest pianists 
of the time. Ile himsell gave a recital at

by Isabelle Leymarie 
the age of fifteen which included works by 
Mozart, Schubert, Grieg and Mendelssohn. 
[lis debut as a pianist snggested he was 
destined for a brilliant career. But Fauré’s 
music, which he first heard in 1909, came as 
arevelation to him and made him decide to 
become a composer. In 1911, armed with a 
letter of introduction from the composer 
Enrique Granados (1867-1910), he settled 
in Paris and entered the Conservatoire, 
where he studied piano and harmony. Ile 
then devised his own harmonic system, 
which, with its unexpected chords, was 
Impressionistic in atmosphere hut governed 
by a totally original logic. Ilis motto became 
“recomencar”, which means returning to the 
spirit of the “primitives” in musical compo- 
sition, He rejected modulation, the bar line 
and counterpoint and was fond of “impon- 
derable tones” (Vladimir Jankélévitch). 
Between 1913 and 1921 Mompou wrote 
some of his most accomplished works for 
piano, including Pessebres (Cribs), Escenes 
d’Infants (Children’s Seenes) and Suburbis 
(Suburbs), which sought to express “the 
sound of an atmosphere, the gossamer light- 
ness of a feeling, the parenthesis of a quaint 
episode,” in the words of the Catalan musi- 
cologist, Lluts Millet. While in Paris, then 
a hive of musieal ereativity, Mompon met 
the composers Manrice Ravel and Lirik 
Satie, among others, and became friends 
with several of his compatriots, such as the 
sculptor Apelles Fenosa and the painters 
Miquel Renom and Celso Lagar. 
When the I'irst World War broke out in 
1914, Mompou returned to Barcelona and 
took part in the Catalan renaissance move- 
ment, Noucentisme. In 1921 he returned to 
Paris, where his compositions soon won a rep- 
utation, and remained there, apart from the 
occasional visit to his home town, nntil the 
Nazi Occupation nineteen years later. By the 
end of the 1920s he had written the first 
cyele of his Cangons i Danses (Songs and 
Dances), the first two Preludes, other piano 
picces and a number of songs. Although his 
friends included Francis Poulenc and 
Georges Auric, he refused to join the Group 
of Six2, preferring to remain independent. 
During the 1930s Mompou went 
through an unhappy patch in which he was 
less prolific. IIe returned to Barcelona in 
1941 and joined the Independent Catalan 
Composers’ movement, while keeping up 
his links with French mnsicians. Ile mixed 
with writers and publishers, and set to 
music the poetry of his Catalan friend, 
Josep Janés i Olivé. But above all he met 
the young pianist Carme Bravo, whom he 
married a few years later. He then decided 
to make a fresh start as a composer. and 
enjoyed an unparalleled spell of renewed 
creativity. The works he composed during 
this period included some new Cangons i 
Danses, a set of Variations on a Theme by 
Chopin, and Cantar del Alma (Song of the 
Soul) for choir and orchestra, which was 
also inspired by St. John of the Cross. In 
1967 he completed the final volume of his 
Musica Callada, none of whose seven short 
pieces is given a faster tempo than tempo 
moderato. The pianist Alicia de Larrocha, 
the dedicatee of the work, gave its first 
performance in Cadaques in 1972. 
Montpou was an isolated figure who 
rebelled against convention and always 
remained true to his own temperament and 
sensibility. Freed from the constraints of 
bar lines, tonality and established forms, he 
is as different from Wagner and Schoenberg 
as he is from his Spanish predecessors, 
Manuel de Falla, Albéniz and Granados 
(the last two were also born in Catalonia, 
but belonged to other movements), and 
[rom Debussy. Ile belonged to an age-old 
tradition of Mediterranean music. He some- 
times quotes from his favourite Catalan 
tunes in Cangons i Danses, and from work- 
ing-class songs in Suburbis, though he 
rejects nationalism and folklore. is Iberian 
high spirits, which contrast with his more 
incantatory and dreamlike leanings, are 
chiefly to be found in Gitano, the last of his 
Impressions Intimes, and in some of his 
Fetes Lointaines. Mompou plumbed the 
mystical sources of the universe in Cants 
Magics and Charmes. 
Mompou, who died on 30 June 1987, 
wrote his own epitaph: 
“Death blesses the union 
of the soul with silence. 
Sleep and rest, my heart, 
Eternity gives you a serenade and 
you're lulled by 
The greatest love of all.” ||

Rr professional journals and international 
organizations of all kinds are eom- 
memorating the centenary of Jean Piaget’s birth. Born on 9 
August 1896 at Neuchatel (Switzerland), this biologist, psy- 
chologist and philosopher altered and deepened our under- 
standing of human life. Primarily known as a child psychologist, 
he used his research on young children as a springhoard to a bet- 
ter understanding of the human personality. As our century 
comes to a close, not a single area of the human sciences can 
escape the influence—balaneed, humane and original —of Jean 
Piaget. 
The child as active agent 
Piaget is probably best known for his writing on the early life 
of children. His importance in this field derives principally 
from his innovative methods and ambitious goals. Instead of 
applying adult preconceptions and soeial norms to the study 
of childhood, Piaget tried to describe and evaluate the point 
of view of the developing child. In essence, he attempted to 
reconstruct the daily life of the child in all its confusion, tur- 
moil and anxiety. This methodological innovation resulted in 
discoveries that upset some of our most complacently held 
beliefs about childhood. 
In hundreds of articles and books, Piaget showed that there 
is almost nothing absolute or static in a child’s mental life. Even 
seemingly fundamental notions such as space, time, relation 
and causality are constructed through trial and error in the

eourse of the child’s early years. Moreover, the whole edifice 
of the adult personality—its rationality, its morality, its very 
perceptual stability—is founded on the physical processes of 
the child’s early years. Piaget was very fond of the analogy of 
“grasping”; before one ¢an grasp an idea, one must learn to 
grasp concrete objects. The infant’s earliest, (altering move- 
ments prepare and foreshadow its later development. 
Childhood as touchstone 
Piaget also studied how this early landscape of the child 
evolves from year to year. Once again, he emphasized the ten- 
tative trial-and-error nature of the child’s world. Although he 
charted an intricately structured eourse from birth to the 
assumption of the complex responsibilities of life, this evo- 
lution is discontinuous and constantly interrupted by conflicts 
with the child’s surroundings. Thus, Piaget’s account of the 
stages of early life is much more realistic and less tendentious 
than the accounts of Frend, Erikson or Maslow. 
Piaget’s firm grasp of the flux of early life allowed him to 
use his studies of childhood as a platform for something even 
deeper—the identification of the essential traits of life itself. 
Tle processes and struetures of early life were used as clues

to the nature of life in all its generality. At this level of study, 
Piaget was breaking new ground in Western thought. 
Instead of rejecting childhood as beneath the dignity of 
serious philosophical study, Piaget, who after all read widely 
in philosophy all his life—insists that only a close study of 
infancy would allow us te slip beneath prejudice and habit 
and enable us to see life in something like its true condition. 
From Neuchatel to the international scene 
From his earliest years, Piaget demonstrated both interest 
and talent in the natural sciences, sending a paper on albino 
sparrows to a Neuchitel journal at the age of ten. By 1916, 
lie had published twenty papers on molluscs. These papers 
were valuable enough to bring him into consideration for a 
curator’s position at the Museum of Natural Iistory in 
Geneva. In an autobiographical sketch,! Piaget relates that 
it was necessary to refuse this prestigious position becanse 
“[Le] still had two years to go before finishing [his] secondary 
education”. 
In his twenties, Piaget developed an interest in psychologi- 
cal problems and worked with Theodore Simon, a collabora- 
tor in the Binet scale of intelligence. It was during this time 
that he worked in Eugen Bleuler’s psychiatric clinic in Zurich 
and became acquainted with the clinical method he would 
later use in such an innovative fashion in his own research. 
Piaget held numerous academic posts in Switzerland and 
France after lie received Lis doctorate in zoology in 1918, but 
was never a reclusive or overly specialized researcher. From 
the carly 1920s he realized that his ambitious intellectual 
goals would require collaboration and international dialogue. 
For decades he was associated with the Jean-Jacques 
Rousseau Institute in Geneva (now the Institute of 
Educational Sciences). In 1956 he persuaded the Rockefeller 
Foundation to financially assist his International Institute of 
Genetic Epistemology at the University of Geneva. lle was 
actively associated with UNESCO as a member of its Executive 
Board, as director of the International Burean of Education 
(IBE), and for a short time as Assistant Director-General for 
Education. 
Jean Piaget may be termed a foundational thinker. 1le 
delved beneath prejudices, biases and encrusted habits in 
order to uncover the essential well-springs of cognitive life. 
This constituted a liberation of energies which in turn laid 
the foundation for growth and renewal in both individuals and 
societies. Piaget’s work, combining enormous breadth of 
learning with a powerful focus on life’s essential questions, 
is without doubt one of our century’s greatest treasures. HR

### 104900: The Psychology of marbles

As it was... 
THE UNESCO Courier 
November 1980 
The psychology 
of marbles 
by Jean Piaget 
Children’s games constitute the most 
J admirable social institutions. The game 
of marbles, for instance, contains an 
extremely complex system of rules which constitute a well- 
marked social reality, “independent of individuals” and trans- 
mitted, like a language, from one generation to another. 
We simply asked ourselves (1) how the individuals adapt 
themselves to these rules. i.e. how they observe rules at each 
age and level of mental development: (2) how far they become 
conscious of rules. in other words, what types of obligation 
result (always according to the children’s ages) from the 
increasing ascendancy exercised by rules. 
During the first part, it is sufficient to ask the children 
how one plays marbles. “Teach me the rules and I'll play with 
vou.” The child then draws a square, takes half the marbles, 
puts down his “pose”, and the game begins. It is important 
to bear in mind all possible contingencies of the game and to 
ask the child about each. This means that you must avoid 
making any suggestions. All you need to do is to appear com- 
pletely ignorant, and even to make intentional mistakes so that 
the child may each time point out clearly what the rule is. 
Naturally, you must take the whole thing very seriously, all 
through the game. Then you ask who has won and why, and 
il everything is not quite clear, you begin a new set. 
Then comes the second part of the interrogatory, that, 
namely, which bears upon the consciousness of rules. You begin 
hy asking the child if he could invent a new rule. Onee [it] has 
been formulated, you ask the child whether it could give rise 
to a new game: “Would it be all right to play like that with your 
pals? The child either agrees to the suggestion or disputes it. 
If he agrees, you immediately ask him whether the new rule 
is a “fair” rule, a “real” rule, one “like the others”, and try to 
get at the various motives that enter into the answers, 
If, on the other hand, the child disagrees with all this, you 
ask whether the new rule could not by being generalized 
become a real rule. “When you are a big boy, suppose you tell 
vour new rule to a lot of children. then perhaps they'll all play 
that way and everyone will forget the old rules. Then which rule 
will be fairest—yours that everyone knows, or the old one that 
evervone has forgotten?” The main point is to find out whether 
one may legitimately alter rules and whether a rule is fair or just 
because it conforms to general usage (even newly introduced), 
or because it is endowed with an intrinsic and eternal value. 
Having cleared up this point it will be easy enough to ask 
the two following questions. (1) Have people always played as

### 104900: The Psychology of marbles

THE PIAGET CENTENARY 
Through its International Bureau of Education (IBE), Unesco is 
closely associated with many of the celebrations, including sem- 
inars, publications and exhibitions, which are marking the cen- 
tenary of Jean Piaget's birth. An issue of the international edu- 
cational journal Prospects (vol. XXVI, n° 1, March 1996} was 
devoted to a study of the topicality of Piaget's educational think- 
ing. The 45th session of the International Education Conference, 
which was held in Geneva during the first week of October 1996, 
examined the role of teachers in a changing world and included 
a round table meeting on Piaget and education. An exhibition on 
Piaget’s life was shown during the Conference and was later pre- 
sented at Unesco’s Paris Headquarters during the 150th session 
of the Organization's Executive Board. A symposium on “Piaget 
after Piaget”, organized with Unesco support, is being held on 
15 and 16 November 1996 at the University of Paris-Sorbonne.

» they do today? (2) What is the origin of rules: Are they invented 
by children or laid down by parents and grown-ups in general? 
The main thing is to grasp the child’s mental orientation. 
Does he believe in the mystical value of rules or in their final- 
ity? Does he subscribe to a heteronymy of divine law, or is 
he conscious of his own autonomy? This is the only question 
that interests us. The child has naturally got no ready-made 
beliefs on the origin and endurance of the rules of his games; 
the ideas which he invents then and there are only indices of 
his fundamental attitude. 
In practice 
From the point of view of the practice or application of rules 
four successive stages can be distinguished. 
A first stage of a purely motor and individual character, 
during which the child handles the marbles at the dictation 
of his desires and motor habits. This leads to the formation 
of more or less ritualized schemas, but since play is still 
purely individual, one can only talk of motor rules and not of 
truly collective rules. 
The seeond may be called egocentric. This stage begins 
at the moment when the child receives from outside the 
example of codified rules, that is to say, some time between 
the ages of two and five. But though the child imitates this 
example, he continues to play either by himself without hoth- 
ering to find play-fellows, or with others, but without trying 
to win, and therefore without attempting to unify the dif- 
ferent ways of playing. In other words, children of this stage, 
even when they are playing together, play each one “on his 
own” (everyone can win at once) and without regard for any 
codification of rules. 
A third stage appears between seven and eight, which we 
call the stage of incipient co-operation. Each player now tries 
to win, and all, therefore, begin to concern themselves with the 
question of mutual control and of unification of the rules. But 
while a certain agreement may De reached in the course of one 
game, ideas about the rules in general are still rather vague. 
Finally, between the years of cleven and twelve, appears a 
fourth stage, which is that of the codification of rules. Not only 
is every detail of procedure in the game fixed, but the actual 
code of rules to be observed is known to the whole society. 
These stages must of course be taken only for what they 
"he unesco (COURIER NOVEMBER 1996 
are worth. It is convenient for the purposes of exposition to 
divide the children up in age-classes or stages, but the facts 
present themselves as a continuum which cannot be cut up 
into sections. This continuum, moreover, is not linear in char- 
acter, and its general direction can only be observed by 
schematizing the material and ignoring the minor oscillations 
which render it infinitely complicated in detail. 
Consciousness of rules 
Let us turn now to the consciousness of rules, [whose] pro- 
gression runs through three stages. 
During the first stage rules are not yet coercive in charac- 
ter, either because they are purely motor, or else (at the 
beginning of the egocentric stage) because they are received, 
as it were, unconsciously, and as interesting examples rather 
than as obligatory realities. 
During the second stage (apogee of egocentric and first 
half of co-operating stage) rules are regarded as sacred and 
untouehable, emanating from adults and lasting forever. Every 
suggested alteration strikes the child as a transgression. 
Finally, during the third stage, a rule is looked upon as a 
law due to mutual consent, which you must respeet if you 
want to be loyal but which it is permissible to alter on the 
condition of enlisting general opinion on your side. 
The correlation between the three stages in the develop- 
ment of the consciousness of rules and the four stages relat- 
ing to their practical observance is of course only a statisti- 
cal correlation and therefore very crude. But broadly 
speaking tbe relation seems to us indisputable. 
The collective rule is at first something external to the 
individual and consequently sacred to him; then, as he grad- 
nally makes it his own, it comes to that extent to be felt as 
the {ree product of mutual agreement and an autonomous 
conscience. And with regard to practical nse, it is only nat- 
ural that a mystical respect for laws sheuld he accompanied 
by a rudimentary knowledge and application of their con- 
tents, while a rational and well-founded respect is accompa- 
nied by an cffective application of cach rule in detail. 
There would therefore seem to be two types of respeet for 
rules corresponding to two types of social behaviour. This con- 
clusion deserves to be closely examined, for if it holds good, 
it should be of the greatest value to the analysis of child 
morality. ||

The Uneco Courier will have a stand at this year's Seine-Saint Denis Young People’s 
Book Fair to be held from 27 November to 1 December (2 December for the trade 
only) in the Paris suburb of Montreuil. The Fair offers a broad spectrum of young 
people's literature and selects prizewinning works published in the current year. The 
creation of the world will be the theme of an international symposium (25 and 26 
November), discussions and exhibitions designed to shed light on how the origins 
of humanity and the universe are perceived in different cultures, to promote dia- 
logue between the imaginative process and scientific research, and to consider the 
ethical problems raised by cosmogonies.

Unesco’s fiftieth anniversary 
Campaign on behalf 
of renovation 
and rehabilitation plans 
for Unesco Headquarters 
  
“One cannot be a modernist without first understanding heritage, and one cannot be a 
traditionalist without first realizing that everything that is built was once modern.” 
Renzo Piano 
Unesco, which today has 185 Member States, is the only institution of the United Nations system 
with its headquarters in France. 
Inaugurated in 1958, the buildings housing this forum of the world’s cultures were designed by 
three eminent architects: Marcel Breuer, Pier Luigi Nervi and Bernard Zehrfuss. 
The “three-pointed star” design of the main building, which rests on 72 pilotis, is a fine synthesis 
of 20th-century functionalist architecture in which exceptional effects are achieved with reinforced concrete. 
Today the building materials are beginning to show their age. The concrete is crumbling, and the 
plate-glass windows no longer satisfy energy-saving requirements. In addition, conference room facilities have 
been outstripped by growing needs resulting from the increase in the number of UNesco's Member States. 
Unesco and its Member States have accordingly adopted a renovation and rehabilitation project 
designed by the Italian architect Renzo Piano, who has reconciled the building's original design with 
today’s needs. The key words are functionality, openness and respect for the raw materials used. 
First of all the entire ground level, including the gardens, will be refitted. Then the public spaces 
on the first underground level and the seventh floor will be renovated and decorated. The work will be exe- 
cuted by French architect Jean-Francois Schmit. 
The murals by Joan Miré and Llorens Artigas will once again be located in the open air, as they 
were originally designed to be. The public will be able to admire the many other artworks at Unesco 
Headquarters, in a newly created “cultural walk": the Japanese garden designed by Isamu Noguchi, the 
sculptures by Henry Moore, Robert Jacobsen and Alberto Giacometti, Alexander Calder’s mobile, the new 
meditation space by Tadao Ando and the Square of Tolerance sculpture garden by Dani Karavan. 
In January 1996, on the initiative of the Headquarters Committee consisting of 25 UNesco 
Member States, an appeal was launched to the international community, public and private organizations 
and individuals, for contributions in cash or in kind. HH
