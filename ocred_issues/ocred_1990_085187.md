JANUARY 1990 
Today there are no more 
unexplored continents, 
unknown seas or mysterious 
islands. But while we can 
overcome the physical 
barriers to exploration, the 
barriers of mutual ignorance 
between different peoples 
and cultures have in many 
cases still not been 
dismantled. 
A modern Ulysses can 
voyage to the ends of the 
earth. But a different kind 
of Odyssey now beckons—an 
exploration of the world’s 
many cultural landscapes, the 
ways of life of its different 
peoples and their outlook on 
the world in which they live. 
It is such an Odyssey that 
the Unesco Courier proposes 
to you, its readers. Each 
month contributors of 
different nationalities provide 
from different cultural and 
professional standpoints an 
authoritative treatment of a 
theme of universal interest. 
The compass guiding this 
journey through the world’s 
cultural landscapes is respect 
for the dignity of man 
everywhere.

### 85172: Interview (with) Sembene Ousmane, poet of the African cinema

  
Sembene Qusmane 
Poet of the African cinema 
Sembene Ousmane is one of Africa’s 
most notable writers and film-makers. 
His Borom Saret (1963) was the first 
film made by an African on a fictional 
subject to be distributed outside Africa. 
His films and novels examine the many 
faces of a continent emerging from the 
colonial era, at grips with the tensions 
of independence and modernization. 
What does it mean to be a film-maker in Africa these days? 
What are the hopes, difficulties and challenges? 
— Whether they are making films for the cinema or for 
television, African film-makers work with images and they 
are heirs to the very old but still living tradition of oral story- 
telling. Images can be considered as a development of the 
oral tradition insofar as they are addressed to a vast number 
of people who, in the Third World in general and especially 
in Africa, are unable or in some cases do not even have the 
time to read. The image 1s really a short cut. 
Let me give you an example. I like to organize travel- 
ling picture shows. I go to a village and show a film, and 
then we have a discussion about it. As a result of what the 
audience has seen, heard and remembered, I find out how 
useful I am as the creator of the film. Once the lights go 
on again, people start to discuss the film. In spite of political 
differences and religious divisions, everyone's point of view 
is represented, and that’s important. 
Then I ask them why they need artists. I have put this 
question to university teachers and to students in their final 
year of secondary school. The answer seems to be that some 
of our intellectuals, especially those who are politically com- 
mitted, expect artists to make proposals, to offer solutions 
and even, I might add, speaking ironically, to make a revo- 
lution for them by proxy. To hear them, you would think 
that art was meant to provide an answer to all their worries. 
Art rather than politics? 
— But art does play a role in politics. Not politics in the 
sense of scoring cheap political points, obviously. People 
are immersed in art and culture from the cradle to the grave. 
In the African tradition, cinema is something which relates 
to human beings in their entirety. 
Has African cinema developed only recently, with the 
emergence of African film-makers, or does it date back to 
colonial times? 
— In colonial times, the cinema was a form of entertain- 
ment for foreigners. The black African world was only seen 
as part of a banana plantation or a coconut grove, or through 
stock characters of loyal houseboys and servants. Now, 
however, African film-makers are raising real issues. 
They may not always raise them successfully, but they are 
raising them nevertheless. People are thus slowly starting 
to identify with their history and the cinema is becoming 
something real. 
Would you go so far as to say that the cinema is now the 
most powerful form of artistic expression in Africa? 
— Absolutely! African cinema is a form of self-communion. 
There are many things that we have not been taught and 
are in danger of losing: with the cinema, we can safeguard 
them and people can see them. 
Would you say the same of television programmes, which 
may have been produced in another African country or 
even on another continent? 
— If a football match is being televised, then people watch 
television. Otherwise, they go to the cinemal Some serials 
have been relatively successful, but the constant cliff-hanging 
becomes boring in the long run. In the ten years since we 
have had television in Senegal, we have seen Dallas, Dynasty, 
Shaka... 
Do serials like Dallas appeal to the general public? 
— Of course! They represent success and the “American way 
of life”. They are full of beautiful women in beautiful 
settings, full of everything we hate yet dream about. It is 
difficult to analyse their attraction in logical terms. They 
have an immoral side, but morality no longer comes before 
individual success. In colonial times, the land was occupied,

but people’s minds were free. Even though my relatives— 
my uncles, for example—may have been civil servants and 
may have worn topees or ties, they returned to their own 
culture and their own world when they came home to their 
families. They still had something to say to their wives and 
children and their neighbours. But television takes possession 
of people’s minds. Another culture, a completely different 
view of things, is brought into the home. The model 
of society handed down by our ancestors is smashed 
and is replaced by another. That is where the danger of 
television lies. 
Do you think it is completely destructive? 
— Yes, completely, because African society is not bringing 
forth a fresh culture to contend with this challenge. We are 
more familiar with European fairy tales than with our own 
traditional stories. There are no traditional story-tellers left 
in the towns. Our children go to school and are taught in 
a foreign language. When they come out of school, they go 
off and watch foreign stories with their parents. 
But a society cannot turn backwards. So what should 
be done? 
— The audiences at my travelling picture shows ask me the 
same labyrinthine question. In the first place, we must all 
_ know what we want. Naturally, we are all in favour of 
individual freedom, but where do we want to go with that 
freedom and what do we want to do with it? What do you 
do with freedom when you have countries that cannot 
educate three-quarters of their children, where unemploy- 
ment is rife, where there is no work, and calamities pour 
down on you? Birth is always attended by pain. I was not 
present at the Creation, but when Allah created the world, 
there must surely have been what we now call a “Big Bang”. 
There must have been an explosion, because nothing can 
be accomplished without an explosion. Life is reborn of 
death. You sow seeds and they decompose; a crack opens 
up in the earth and they sprout. There is no alternative. 
For the people, being free means having the right to work 
and to speak out. We all have to wage our own struggle and 
to pay for it accordingly. 
And what do the people say? 
— They expect somebody to speak out on their behalf. You 
know, black Africa’s heritage is a heavy burden. No sooner 
had we started to form embryonic states, which were far 
from perfect, than we had to contend with the slave trade 
in which, incidentally, some Africans took part. For four 
or five centuries, some African chiefs were accessories to 
this monstrous trade. After that came colonization, which 
is perhaps the worst thing that ever happened to us. The 
colonialists trained some people, but only to occupy subor- 
dinate positions, not to govern themselves. The colonial 
master’s presence had become necessary. In the end we 
fought for independence, but we did not know what it was 
or even who we were. We had a common territory but

different cultures. Within each geographical boundary a host 
of cultures existed side by side. We are now creating a fresh 
culture, but it is based on a language which is not our own. 
That is even more serious. 
Is this when artists should make their voices beard? 
— Yes. This is where they come into their own. People listen 
to them and expect them to speak out. Historically, no other 
creative artists have ever carried as much responsibility as 
novelists and film-makers. This takes us to the ancient 
African tradition of the “griot”. Everybody knows that 
griots are crazy. Every village has its “simpleton” who dares 
to say out loud what other people only whisper in the 
solitude of their huts. We laugh at him, but we acknowledge 
that he is right. 
There used to be griots; now there are artists, film-makers. 
Could this handing down of symbols not be a reason for 
hope? After all, perfect democracy can hardly be expected 
to emerge from chaos at a single stroke... 
— In democracy it is up to the people, not the artist, to speak 
out. In the past, power was wielded by the elders and by 
wise men. Nowadays the pattern has been reversed. The 
elders are no longer the fount of knowledge and no one 
listens to them any more. What radio, television and the 
newspapers say does not originate with them. Society is 
being torn apart and people are going crazy as a result. What 
I say is that the only way to be happy here is to go crazy. 
The countries of the Third World face many challenges. 
Are you one of those who consider that these challenges come 
primarily from outside, or do you think that they emanate 
from within the society itself? 
— Outside the continent we have adversaries and we have 
allies. I would say that Africa's real enemies—its long- 
standing enemies—are within. If we are to move forward, 
therefore, we must sort out our own problems and rely prin- 
cipally on ourselves. Basically, we have three priorities: we 
have to apply our own remedies, however limited, to our 
own problems; we have to develop education; and we have 
to provide work for the people. 
What about freedom of speech? 
— Speech is a duty in Africa. Every head of a family is 
expected to attend village meetings—“palavers”—to represent 
his clan or his household. Moreover, he has to speak, if he 
does not want to be thought of as a coward. But he also 
has to listen. There is a very fine tradition in the “palaver”: 
when a man has finished speaking, the oldest member 
of the group says “We have heard what you have said and 
understood what you have not said”. Naturally, nowadays, 
in a democracy the scale is different. Every citizen has 
to express his or her views. The issues are no longer the 
same, but the tradition of the “palaver” could perhaps 
open up paths and suggest new ways in which people could 
organize themselves. u

HE need for a form of money to serve as a medium of exchange 
arose at a very early stage in history, and ever since then an astonishing 
range of objects has been used for the purpose at different times and 
places—{eathers, shells, cocoa beans, silver, gold, and paper notes, to name 
but a few. As time went by, the functions of money diversified. A medium 
of payment for goods and services, a standard of value and a store of 
purchasing power, it eventually became a convention reflecting people’s 
confidence in society. 
The subject of money is full of mystery and paradox. It creates, as Lucien 
Gillard points out in this issue, “a coherent area within which people have 
a common yardstick with which to assess their credits and debts”. Within 
this area its use gives rise to inequalities. It is a measure of wealth and, by 
the same token, of poverty. It became an attribute of state power, but also, 
through fraud, a means whereby the power of the state was contested. 
Although a currency is legal tender within fixed boundaries, it is linked by 
exchange rates to other currency areas and international markets. 
Often attacked by moralists and rejected by utopians, sometimes relegated 
to a secondary role even by economists but omnipresent in our daily lives, 
money has contributed, by facilitating trade and boosting economic activity, 
to certain decisive steps in the history of civilization. In this issue we evoke 
some milestones in monetary history in the hope that they will help to 
throw some light on the role of money in the world today.

& A variety of unusual objects have been 
used since ancient times to finance trade 
and cement political and social life 
  
  
BY JEAN-MICHEL SERVET 
N:cxices or bracelets of shells, pearls, teeth, 
bones or feathers, fragments of stone or metal, 
pottery, pieces of cloth, and other unlikely 
objects are labelled as “primitive money” in 
many museum collections and ethnographical or 
archaeological publications. 
Other apparently similar objects are 
described as ornaments or jewellery, although 
there is no evidence to prove that they were used 
for display rather than as money. Their degree 
of preservation, which suggests that they were 
highly valued by their owners, together with 
physical characteristics indicating a non-utilitarian 
purpose, may have led archaeologists and students 
of prehistory to attribute a purely decorative 
function to these treasures which in fact were also 
used as money. 
Money in ancient civilizations 
+ Over 2,000 years ago, Aristotle observed that 
before coins were used people gave things that 
they possessed in abundance in exchange for 
things they lacked. This practice was known as 
metadosis. Ethnologists have described how very 
ancient yet strongly hierarchical societies used 
complex exchange systems such as the ku/a of the 
western Pacific, the bilaba and the malaki of 
central Africa and the potlatch of the northwest 
coast of North America. 
Money, like relationships involving hierarchy 
and domination, is thus not a modern invention. 
It was a feature of even more ancient civilizations 
than those of the Mediterranean basin, of the 
Near or the Far East, or of Central America. The

between these communities seems to have been 
universal, and in a sense to foreshadow the func- 
tions of money as a medium of exchange and as 
a unit of account. 
But in such ancient societies these basic func- 
tions had not yet become purely economic. They 
were an emanation of kinship systems and polit- 
ical alliances, beliefs and cults, which influenced 
the supply of labour, organized production and 
justified the distribution of wealth. 
Money, or in this case “palacomoney”, was 
the active instrument of social life. It was used 
at times of birth, marriage and mourning, to 
declare war and make peace, as compensation for 
physical or moral wrongs, and as a means of 
propitiating the gods of fertility and death, On 
the other hand, it was not yet used to pay debts 
or wages or to buy goods. 
The scarcity and lack of intrinsic usefulness 
which characterize palaecomoney are typical of 
some modern forms of money. Palacomoney also 
anticipated the economic and political nature of 
modern currencies, on the one hand by setting 
a value on different activities and material goods 
and thus foreshadowing today’s standardized 
methods of payment, on the other by reflecting 
and reinforcing the hierarchical power relations 
between individuals and groups. 
Better than barter 
The exchange systems of these ancient commu- 
nities were thus much more complex than that 
of a simple barter economy. 
From very early times, commodities circu- 
lated over great distances. Specimens of durable 
materials such as amber and obsidian have been 
found hundreds of kilometres from their place 
of origin, distances as great as that from southern 
Australia to the northern coasts of New Guinea, 
and from the Black Sea to Poland and the 
Rhineland. As early as the Upper Palaeolithic 
Period (35,000-10,000 years ago), Cro-Magnon 
man in the Dordogne area of southern France was

using shells brought from the Atlantic ocean, 200 
kilometres away. 
At a later stage different societies came to 
specialize in the production of a particular item 
for exchange and as a means of payment for 
produce acquired from other groups. Examples 
of such commodities are stone axes, bars of salt, 
pottery and bark cloaks. Later still, groups 
specializing in trade emerged within these socie- 
ties and travelled tens or even hundreds of 
kilometres in the course of their activities, 
This is far removed from a barter economy, 
where goods are exchanged directly, without any 
intermediate transaction. However, the develop- 
ment of an objective system for measuring value 
was still limited. The price of the goods ex- 
changed was primarily the expression of a social 
relationship between individuals and communi- 
ties. The marketplace was not yet the driving 
force behind monetary development. 
The first coins 
The use of money grew rapidly with the develop- 
ment of states, which managed the surplus wealth 
created by the exploitation of slaves, serfs or 
peasants, by long-distance trade or the despolia- 
tion of neighbouring peoples. Tributes and taxes 
began to be evaluated and methods of payment 
for trade in markets and ports began to be stan- 
dardized. 
Among the wide range of commodities which 
served as money in ancient societies—the pieces - 
of cloth and cocoa beans of the Maya and Aztec 
empires, the cowrie shells and gold of the West 
African kingdoms, the bean-shaped ingots of the 
Greek cities, the iron bars of the Hittites, the 
barley and wheat of Mesopotamia, the wheat and 
copper of Egypt, the millet and silks of China— 
coins are of particular interest because their use 
has continued to the present day. 
At first, coins were only one form of metal 
currency. Before coins circulated in China, and

century BC, small-scale replicas of spades and 
knives were used as money. The first coins were 
struck in the seventh century BC in Asia Minor 
and in Greece, where some cities were still using 
bean-shaped ingots. Small silver ingots punched 
with a variety of motifs were used as currency 
in India from the same period until coins were 
introduced there in the fourth century BC. 
The influence of Greece 
The cities of ancient Greece played a crucial role 
in the history of coinage. For centuries the Greek 
numismatic tradition was widely propagated, 
either directly or through a complex network 
of influences. In the wake of the conquests of 
Alexander the Great, whose troops seized pre- 
cious metal from the treasuries of Near-Eastern 
potentates and turned it into coinage, Greek coins 
were widely distributed in the Mediterranean 
countries. 
The Romans, who initially used bronze in- 
gots like those of the Etruscans, minted their first 
coins in the third century BC under the influence 
of the Greek cities of southern Italy. Roman 
colonization led to the use of coinage to an extent 
unmatched until the European colonial expansion 
of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. 
Beyond the eastern frontiers of the Roman 
empire, between Khorasan and Mesopotamia, 
the Sasanian dynasty continued a numismatic

tradition that displayed a strong Hellenistic 
influence and had been transmitted by the 
Parthians, whose empire (founded between the 
third and the second century BC) stretched at its 
height from the Euphrates to Afghanistan. This 
Hellenistic tradition also influenced early Islamic 
coins, while the Roman tradition was carried on 
in Christian Europe. 
A similar process occurred in India, which 
was subject to waves of Greek influence both 
direct and indirect, from the arrival of Alexander's 
troops and contact with the Roman empire to 
Muslim and European colonization. 
The ritual significance 
of coins 
In all these civilizations, coins were not immedi- 
ately seen as a monetary instrument superior to 
other accepted methods of payment, with which 
they long coexisted. Metal discs, more or less well- 
stamped, could be used in all kinds of ways. 
When they changed hands it signified more than 
just a commercial transaction—it could symbolize 
an exchange of gifts or even tribute. 
The first coins of the Greek cities were thus 
not issued as a direct response to commercial 
requirements. Their value was too high to pay 
for everyday goods in the marketplace. In long-

distance transactions, carried out largely by sea, 
the goods themselves were the means of payment. 
What then was the original function of these 
coins? At first it seems that they were needed in 
dealings within and between the Greek cities, and 
above all they had a political and religious 
function. 
This dual role was not however an obstacle 
to the use of coins in commerce. The metal of 
which they were made had itself been the object 
of long-distance transactions since very ancient 
times, when trade had important political and 
social overtones. The flexibility allowed by 
weighed pieces of metal which could be divided 
into small units, and their distribution in societies 
with widely different customs, gradually estab- 
lished them as the preferred method of trading 
and of paying taxes in the ancient world. 
Coins stamped with the images of gods and 
rulers kept their essentially political function until 
the Roman era, when they were issued to com- 
memorate public games or military campaigns. 
The sacrificial and ritual significance of coins 
persists even today, as when they are buried in 
the foundations of buildings and bridges or flung 
into fountains and wells as propitiatory offerings, 
used symbolically to reinforce marriage contracts, 
or placed in the mouths or hands of the dead so 
that they can pay their way in the next world.

M ONEY grows on trees,” the Spanish 
chroniclers who followed the conquistadors to 
Mexico noted with amazement when they saw 
that cocoa beans were used as currency. 
At that time there were three major cocoa- 
producing regions: Chontalpa and Soconusco in 
Mexico, and the Ulda basin in Honduras. Produc- 
tion, circulation and consumption of the precious 
beans were tightly controlled by the nobles and 
merchants of the Valley of Mexico and Yucatan. 
Cocoa was expensive because of low yields and 
transport problems. 
Cocoa was a primitive form of currency and 
could not perform all the functions of money. 
It was widely used as 2 medium of exchange, but 
to measure value the Aztecs and Mayas tended 
to use guachtli, pieces of cotton fabric which 
represented a given amount of work. 
In Yucatan, one guachtli was equivalent to 
450 hours of work. And while we do not know 
how many hours it took to make each of the 
pieces of cloth which formed part of the tribute 
raised by the Aztec emperors, we know that each 
one was worth almost 100 cocoa beans.

because, unlike the pieces of cloth, it could be 
divided up as required. 
The ancient Mexicans used cocoa to prepare 
chocolate, a ritual drink consumed exclusively by 
aristocrats and warriors. Most people only had 
the right to pulque, a fermented drink made from 
agave. This prohibition strengthened the power 
of the aristocracy, since chocolate was supposed 
to be the food of the gods and to possess magical 
properties. 
Aztec ‘chocolate soldiers’ 
Perhaps chocolate was associated with the blood 
of human sacrifices, notably when the heart was 
torn from victims offered to Quetzalcdatl, the 
“plumed serpent”, in the Toltec towns of Yucatin 
and the Valley of Mexico. 
According to Mexican mythology, Quetzal-

to grow cocoa when he lived at the city of Tula. 
When he left for the coast, he buried the “cur-

rency” of that time—sea-shells, feathers and pre- 
cious stones. Cocoa then began to be used as cur- 
rency instead, and was invested with the magic 
attributes of the god who had introduced it. 
The Aztecs were the last masters of the Valley 
of Mexico. Their flourishing empire, which domi- - 
nated all the peoples which had fought for con- 
trol of the Valley, owed its prosperity to tribute 
rendered by its thirty-eight provinces, among 
which Soconusco contributed, according to the 
Codex Mendoza, 400 of the 980 loads of cocoa 
demanded by the state. 
The beans were deposited in ““cocoa-houses” 
and then taken to the centres of imperial 
power—temples and barracks where it is recorded

### 85174: When cocoa was used as currency

Unlike those of the Aztecs, the Maya political 
and mercantile élites overlapped, so that cocoa 
entered Maya society through trade not tribute. 
The circulation of cocoa beans was duplicated 
by the production of an equivalent quantity of 
cotton squares. Cocoa beans and cotton squares 
served as standards of value for all kinds of com- 
modities including certain areas of land which 
produced cash crops. Slavery came into being 
when manpower was levied from among the 
peasant communities. Men were bought and sold 
with cocoa. According to the chronicler Diego 
de Landa, the Mayas of Yucatin were “Strongly 
inclined to trade. They dispatched salt, clothes 
and slaves to Ulta and Tabasco, and bartered 
them for cocoa and rows of stones which served 
them as money and enabled them to buy slaves 
and other fine stones...” 
Thanks to Maya and perhaps even Aztec 
slaves, the increased productivity of the cocoa- 
growing regions probably encouraged the circu- 
lation of cocoa among the lower classes, still 
under the control of the aristocracy. Several eth- 
nographic chronicles from colonial times confirm 
that cocoa was used as an offering and as a gift 
at weddings and funerals. 
What role did cocoa play in the accumula- 
tion of wealth? Among the Mayas and the Aztecs 
different attitudes prevailed, generally dictated by 
social status. In the Valley of Mexico the mer- 
chants had to behave with great circumspection 
so as not to offend the emperor. Consequently, 
records the chronicler Bernardion de Sahagin, 
they were modestly, even poorly dressed. As for 
the Pochtec merchants, they were forced by the 
avarice of the nobility to give up large quantities 
of cocoa as gifts and offerings to temples. 
Whereas in the Valley of Mexico the posses- 
sion of cocoa was a status symbol, among the 
Itz4s of Yucatan fortunes in cocoa ostentatiously 
displayed by rich lords who owned many slaves 
and opulently decorated palaces also served to 
stimulate production since they could be invested 
in commercial farming and the acquisition of 
captive manpower. This may explain why the 
Spaniards retained the use of cocoa as money in 
Yucatan, replacing cotton with their own currency, 
the real, as an indicator of value, but continuing 
to relate it to fluctuations in cocoa production. 
Cocoa was still being used in the nineteenth 
century to pay the wages of workmen in Yucatin 
and other parts of Central America. This is clear 
from an account by a North American traveller, 
John L. Stephens, who noted in 1842 that in 
Yucatan there were no copper coins nor any 
specie less than the half real, that the Indians 
earned very low wages with which they procured 
the bare necessities, and that cocoa beans were 
widely used as small change. [| 19

have circulated in Africa for many centuries

EF ROM the dawn of time to the twentieth cen- 
tury, many commodities were used as currency 
in sub-Saharan Africa. They included metal rods 
and bracelets, fabrics, salt, pearls, shirt buttons 
and seashells. Of all these mediums of exchange, 
shells enjoyed the widest circulation. 
Cowries, marginellas and olive shells, of 
marine origin, were those most often used. 
Cowries (Cypraea annulus and Cypraea moneta) 
are white or pale yellow shells the size of a hazel- 
nut, with a humped back and a ventral opening. 
They are only found in warm seas, especially in 
the South Pacific and the Indian Ocean. Most of 
the cowries that circulated in Africa for over 2 
thousand years came from the Maldive and 
Laccadive archipelagos, south-west of India, and 
from the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba, off the 
east coast of Africa.

Cowries were traded wherever they were 
fished or collected, and were often carried as 
ballast in Arab, Jewish or European ships sailing 
for ports on the African mainland, where they 
were sold again. 
Marginellas (Marginella) are marine molluscs 
whose shells, especially those from the west coast 
of Africa, are small and colourful. They are also 
found in American tropical waters, notably off 
the coast of Brazil. 
There are more than 300 species of olive 
shells. More elongated than cowries, they have 
an agate-like sheen. The species most commonly 
used in sub-Saharan Africa was Olivancillaria 
nana, found off the coast of Luanda which was 
a monetary reserve used exclusively by the rulers 
of the Kongo kingdom until the Portuguese 
arrived in the late fifteenth century. 
Markets for shell 
currencies 
Until the sixteenth century, the Nzimbu (the 
Kikongo name for Olivancillaria nana) was used 
as currency in the Kongo kingdom, marginella 
shells were used only in the Niger bend, while 
cowrles were common throughout West Africa, 
and, to a certain extent, in Central Africa. Before 
the sixteenth century cowries were also used as 
currency in Egypt. 


### 85177: Mollusc money

From the sixteenth to the late nineteenth cen- 
tury the cowrie was more widely used than any 
other form of shell money—from Senegal to 
Uganda, from the Sahel to the Slave Coast (Gulf 
of Guinea). It was seldom used in the Sahara and 
never gained ground either in northern or 
southern Africa. 
This was also the period when marginella 
shells were most widely circulated in West 
and Central Africa, where they were used as a 
medium of exchange among the Olée, Ngilima, 
Tsambitso, Obaa, Koyo, Eboyi and Akwa 
peoples of the Congo basin. 
Olive shells were always exclusive to the 
Bantu, and do not seem to have circulated out- 
side the Congo. In order to ruin the rulers of the 
Kongo kingdom, the Portuguese introduced 
other species of olives from the Brazilian coast 
and cowries from the Indian Ocean. Inevitably,

2,000 cowries for a gourd of salt 
These shells were not simply used for barter. 
They had all the characteristics of money in the 
sense that they were measures of value and finan- 
cial reserves as well as mediums of exchange. 
They symbolized wealth. 
They could be used as cash to buy yams, 
knives, cattle and slaves, or to pay for services 
rendered. They also served as units of account for 
fixing the price of certain commodities without 
necessarily being used to pay for them. In the 
nineteenth century, the French explorer Louis 
Gustave Binger recorded the following negotia- 
tion between two merchants from northern 
Ghana: “A gourd of salt is worth 2,000 cowries, 
a hundred kola nuts are 1,000 cowries. So I'll give 
you 200 kola nuts for a gourd of salt.” 
Shells thus encouraged trade and were excel- 
lent indicators of fluctuations in the price of 
goods at different times and places. They were 
assembled in multiples for ease of handling. One 
or more holes were pierced in cowries and they 
were strung in groups of 12, 20, 40 or 100 accord- 
ing to the number system used in the trading area 
where they were in circulation. 
Similarly, Musanga (small discs of snail-shell 
used as currency in some African countries) were 
strung through a central hole to make necklaces. 
In the early twentieth century, ten of these neck- 
laces measured from the big toe to the heel were 
worth a doti or 3.60 m of indigo-blue cloth, and 
ten necklaces measured from the little toe to the 
heel were worth a doti of any other cloth. 
In some regions of sub-Saharan Africa the use 
of shell currencies led to the development of 
monetary policies. The authorities controlled the 
import and circulation of the shells. Taking steps 
to avoid an overabundance of shells, which would 
have caused inflation, or scarcity, which would 
have inhibited trade, gave them substantial power 
over the economy. From Abomey to the Slave 
Coast, as in the Congo, rigorous and highly effi- 
cient monetary policies were practised. 
Shells began to be withdrawn from circula- 
tion at the beginning of the colonial period and 
gradually lost their role as a medium of exchange. 
Today only cowries still circulate, on a very small 
scale, between the peoples of south-west Burkina 
Faso and northern Ghana. This is the only region 
in the world where their monetary value has been 
preserved to some extent—but for how much 
longer? n

they had no need of it. Among the nomadic tribes 
for which the camel was the main yardstick of 
wealth, barter was the most widespread form of

and Medina foreign money such as Byzantine

large transactions. 
Between 636 and 655 AD, the first Arab 
invasions which wrenched Syria, Palestine and 
Egypt from the Byzantine empire in the West, 
and destroyed the Persian Sasanian empire in the 
East, brought in vast quantities of precious

was of no urgency to Islam in comparison with 
its paramount goal of waging a holy war. 
The new Muslim masters adapted themselves 
very easily to the existing monetary systems in 
the conquered regions, and took them over prac- 
tically unchanged. In the East silver drachms con- 
tinued to be minted bearing the effigy of the late 
Sasanian king Khosrow II, although they now 
carried the additional inscription “In the name 
of Allah” in Arabic. On the Mediterranean sea- 
board the gold solidus and the bronze follis were 
retained in their original forms, bearing the bust 
or standing figure of the Byzantine emperor 
Heraclius and his son, or of Constans II. Some- 
times an Arabic inscription was added and the 
Christian symbol of the cross, widely found on 
Byzantine coinage, was dropped. 
The accession of the Umayyad dynasty in 661 
AD marked the beginning of strong administra- 
tive control within the Islamic empire. In the field 
of coinage the first steps were taken in Syria and 
Palestine towards true Muslim themes, almost 
exclusively on copper coins, on the instigation 
of caliph ‘Abd al-Malik (reigned 685-705). In 
Damascus, Edessa and Jerusalem coins were 
issued showing the standing figure of the caliph 
with hands on a sheathed sword and encircled by 
an Arabic legend. 
Birth of the dinar 
In 696 AD ‘Abd al-Malik introduced a coherent 
monetary system throughout the empire which 
responded to both national and international eco- 
nomic requirements. 
For major transactions and trade on a large 
scale, the gold dinar of 4.3 grams began to be used. 
For the payment of wages and taxes the silver 
dirbem of 2.8 grams was introduced, and the 
copper fals for everyday use. The relative value 
of these coins was not fixed but changed accord- 
ing to the price of the three metals. At first the 
dinar was worth 10 dirhems, but its value ap- 
preciated to 14 and even to 20 dirhems at different 
periods. The dirhem itself fluctuated between 16 
and 24 fals because its weight varied from region 
to region.

These new coins closely paralleled the foreign 
coins which had previously been in circulation. 
The dinar, heir (and competitor) of the Byzan- 
tine solidus, took its name from the Roman 
denarius. The dirhem was similar in size and value 
to the Persian drachm and the fals (plural fulous) 
was a direct descendant of the Roman and Byzan- 
tine follis. 
On the other hand, the design of the new 
coinage was revolutionary. There were no more 
allegories, no more titles reflecting the glory of 
the ruler, no more portraits. These coins were 
Islamic and therefore their exclusive role was to 
praise God. Even the caliph’s name did not 
appear on them, and because the Prophet had 
disapproved of the representation of human or 
animal forms, the sole inscriptions were profes- 
sions of faith in elegant Kufic script. 
This coinage represented a departure from the 
Middle Eastern and North African tradition 
which was both figurative and personalized, with 
portraits of rulers or emblems of cities. Its lon-

gevity was to be extraordinary—the last coins to 
be struck in this tradition were issued in the 
Yemen around 1960. The system was remarkably 
modern in the sense that no sovereign state had 
defined its currency so explicity before. The 
Arabs were the first to mark coins with their 
name, place of minting and year of issue, dated 
from the Hegira in accordance with the Muslim 
calendar. In the West, the practice of dating coins 
only began to spread widely in the fifteenth 
century. 
While dinars were minted exclusively in the 
Umayyad capital of Damascus, dirhems were 
issued in many of the empire’s leading cities. The 
busiest mints were at Damascus and at Wasit, a 
city founded in 703 in the Tigris valley (north- 
west of Basra, Iraq). The decentralization of the 
mints, from Spain (Cordoba) to Tunisia, from 
Azerbaijan to Afghanistan (Balkh) and Pakistan 
(Sind region), gives an idea of the vast size of the 
Islamic empire. 
The ‘Abbasid dynasty overthrew the Umay- 
yads in 750 AD, and the development of com- 
merce in the eighth and ninth centuries carried 
the use of coinage even further. Baghdad, the new

Bargaining with buttons 
During Bonaparte’s Egyptian expedition of 
1798 the polished buttons on the French 
soldiers’ uniforms are said to have been 
highly prized in the souks of Alexandria. The 
merchants, who were used to seeing nomads 
carry their worldly wealth stitched onto their 
garments so that they wouldn’t lose it in the 
desert—this is why so many North African 
coins have a bole pierced in them—wanted 
to be paid with the beautiful shiny pieces of 
metal which adorned the foreigners’ 
uniforms. Delighted at not having to dip into 
their wages, the soldiers hacked off their 
buttons to pay for their purchases. 
Bonaparte’s reaction on seeing his men return 
from the souk in such a slovenly fashion can 
eastly be imagined.

Trade and religion 
In the twelfth century the gold dinars of the 
Fatimid caliphs of Egypt were so highly 
valued throughout the Middle East, 
especially by Syrian merchants, that the 
Christian kingdoms founded in Palestine by 
the Crusaders began to issue imitations of 
them. These imitations, the so-called 
“Saracenic besants”, were clumsily produced 
at first, but their design was gradually 
improved until they were such faithful copies 
of the dinar that the horrified papal legate 
who accompanied King Louis IX of France 
(Saint Louis) on the Crusades in 1250 
threatened those responsible with 
excommunication for daring to issue coins to 
the glory of Allab for commercial profit. A 
compromise was reached. The Saracenic 
besant was replaced by another issue which 
was almost identical to its predecessor but 
bore a cross and Arabic inscriptions to the 
glory of the Holy Trinity and the Lord 
Jesus Christ.

capital founded in 762, drained off much of the 
empire’s wealth and rapidly grew into a leading 
economic centre with a large gold and silver mint. 
Coins continued to be struck in the style of the 
earlier dynasties but now they began to carry the 
name of the caliph, and later the names of provin- 
cial governors were added. The calligraphy and 
design of the coins varied according to the region 
of issue, however, as local dynasties in the Span- 
ish, North African and eastern Iranian provinces 
asserted their independence. 
The splintering 
of the empire 
In 945, the rebellion of Iranian Buyids marked 
the end of ‘Abbasid central power. From then 
on the Muslim world had no common 
currency, and although the terms dinar and 
dirhem still referred to gold and silver coins, the 
wide range in their weight and purity and the 
arrangement of their inscriptions reflected the 
ambitions and financial situation of each dynasty. 
The sole exception in these politically and eco- 
nomically troubled times was Egypt under the 
Fatimids (969-1171). A prosperous country which 
controlled the outflow of Sudanese gold and 
occupied a strategic position on the main sea 
trading routes, it long continued to mint “good” 
dinars.

sions which ravaged the entire Muslim East— 
Baghdad was sacked in 1258 and the ‘Abbasid 
caliph executed—swept away the last vestiges of 
the currency system conceived by ‘Abd al-Malik. 
Soon each country had its own monetary policy 
and would issue its own coinage. Not until the 
establishment of the Ottoman empire was a com- 
mon currency again in wide circulation. Initially 
the Turkish coinage consisted of a silver akce (of 
1.2 grams then of 0.8 grams), complemented in 
1478 by a gold altun. These coins were in circu- 
lation from Algeria to Turkey and as far as the 
Balkans. 
Yet this system was not as stable as the earlier 
one. Adversely affected from the late sixteenth 
century by the massive influx of silver from 
Spanish mines in South America, it was modi- 
fied several times and reformed in 1688, but was 
never really able to hold its own against Western 
currencies. The design of the coins recalled 
the ancient tradition of personalized money," 
as although they were non-figurative they 
were all dedicated to the glory of the sultan 
and often depicted his seal (tughra), his names 
and his titles. 
Today the countries of the Islamic world 
have their own strictly national currencies. The 
time when money existed solely for the glorifi- 
cation of God, performing a role which tran- 
scended its economic function and crossed 
political boundaries, is over. N

foundation on which people could base their 
plans. The notion of money as capital was recog- 
nized, as is shown by the debates on interest on 
loans, on the indexation of debts, on the causes 
of price rises and even on the sale of indulgences. 
Money, therefore, seems to have fulfilled its 
functions satisfactorily and to have contributed 
to the strengthening of social ties in Renaissance 
Europe. There are, however, two sides to every 
coin; money also lay behind such disruptive 
forces as monopoly acquisition and exclusion. 
And the doubling of the population in Europe 
during the Renaissance period only served to 
accentuate the turmoil these forces induced. 
Debasement of the coinage 
The first problems occasioned by money during 
this period were related to its issue. Within a 
given national territory, the minting and legal 
valuation of money was the responsibility of the 
political authorities, a principle adopted, after 
much vacillation, from Roman law. Despite the 
severity of the measures taken against those who 
contravened this principle (such as being boiled 
alive), the official monopoly to mint coins was 
very often contested. 
The first frauds were the work of traffickers 
in debased coinage which contained less than the 
official quantity of precious metal, but was 
accepted at the same face value. Debased coins 
were to be found everywhere, because minting 
techniques were then too rudimentary to ensure 
that every coin was exactly the same. Any smart 
merchant, money changer, or even tax collector 
would carefully sort through the coins that came 
into his possession and withdraw the heavier 
coins from circulation. All he had to do then to 
get more for them than their face value was to 
sell them by weight, at a good price, to the gold- 
smiths or silversmiths. Another method was to 
shave off minute slivers of the metal before 
putting the coins back in circulation, banking on 
the reluctance of those receiving them to have 
them checked against the official standard (they 
ran the risk of having to bear the expense of the 
assay if the coin was found to conform to the 
standard). 
Attempts to put a stop to this practice by 
milling the edge of the coins and stamping a circle 
around the effigy-head met with little success. No 
country succeeded in introducing the new milling 
techniques, which could have eliminated these 
problems altogether, during the sixteenth 
century. Machine methods for producing coins 
were both too expensive and strongly opposed 
by the workmen who hammer-struck the coins 
by hand in the traditional way. Finding that 
simply having their likenesses engraved on the 
coins was not enough to guarantee their authen- 
ticity, rulers were gradually obliged to require 
that coins be weighed at each transaction. Their 
attempts, by a plethora of prohibitive edicts, to 
prevent the uncontrolled price-fixing of precious 33

metals by goldsmiths and silversmiths proved 
equally ineffective. : 
More radical contradictions became apparent 
between counterfeiters and what might be termed 
the “anti-coin” diehards. Sixteenth-century coun- 
terfeiters, that is to say minters of fake coins, 
tended to specialize in Spanish coins, especially 
the smaller ones which were cheaper to make and 
more difficult to check. Meanwhile, many rulers 
themselves minted imitations of the coinage of 
other countries, so as to keep for themselves 
the minting tax (in the case of small states that 
did not have their own coinage) or to retain 
some of the precious metal by minting debased 
imitations. 


### 85180: Wheelers and dealers of Renaissance Europe

There were some famous examples of coun- 
terfeiting. In France, over a ten-year period, sup- 
porters of the Pope organized the parallel minting 
of coins to undermine the official coinage of the 
Protestant king. Another such case was that of 
the fake Spanish coins struck from cargoes of pre- 
cious metals pirated on their way to Europe from 
the Americas. 
Following the discovery of the Antilles and 
the Americas, Spain embarked on the systematic 
exploitation of the precious metals found there. 
Twice a year, these metals were brought under 
military escort to Seville, where the Spanish 
coinage was minted. Imports of metal recorded 
during the sixteenth century were impressive: 
around 250 tons of gold and 200,000 tons of

silver, amounts equal to 2 third of total previous 
stocks. Some historians, however, estimate that 
clandestine imports not recorded by the Spanish 
authorities and destined for rival mints may well 
have amounted to as much again. 
There have also been less complicated forms 
of coinage abuse. One of these consisted of 
- individuals agreeing amongst themselves to use 
coins prohibited by royal decree. Periodically, 
monarchs would decree that a specific coin was 
no longer legal tender for trading purposes 
because it was of unacceptable quality. Such coins 
had to be taken to treasury offices to be clipped 
and bought back at their value by weight. These 
decrees were often ignored by private individuals, 
who would fix an agreed value for the coins in 
question, particularly when coinage was in short 
supply. This is what happened to small Spanish 
coins in France during the second half of the six- 
teenth century. 
An even more common practice was that of 
using authorized coins in trading but at a so-called 
“voluntary” value, ignoring the value officially 
fixed by the ruler. In those days, and for 200 years 
afterwards, the value of coins was taken from 
public announcements and not from inscriptions 
on the coin itself. Distrust of the official coinage 
was thus increasing and in some regions at cer- 
tain times the private value quoted for a coin 
could be as much as double that of the official 
rate. In these circumstances, the function of

money as a generator of homogenous societies 
was seriously compromised. 
Among the anti-coin lobby there were two 
distinct groups. First there were those who re- 
fused to give up barter. Despite the expansion of 
trade in goods throughout Europe, barter was still 
favoured by countless rural communities. Also 
anti-coin, in a sense, were those who clung to the 
principle of the weight of precious metals (or even 
of salt) as a measure of value, thus excluding from 
their transactions the intrusion of any money- 
minting public authority. 
This principle could be applied in a number 
of ways. A so-called “gold clause” could be in- 
cluded in a fixed-term contract stipulating that 
payment would be made in a certain weight of 
metal or in a certain number of named coins, 
whatever their official value at the time as a unit 
of account. This clause, a relic from Roman law, 
did not disappear for a very long time. In on-the- 
spot transactions, distrust of the coinage meant 


### 85180: Wheelers and dealers of Renaissance Europe

that payment had to be made in raw metal on 
the basis of an agreed tariff. In sixteenth-century 
France, between a quarter and a third of all trans- 
actions were concluded in exchange for gold 
objects such as rings or goblets or for gold dust 
found in rivers (panning for gold was still prac- 
tised) or even filed from coins. 
Venture trading 
In venture trading between Europe and the rest 
of the world, payment in metal was the only 
procedure employed. It is true that minted coins 
were used for the purchase of silk and spices from

the Orient—chiefly the Spanish excelente and the 
Venetian sequin up to the mid-sixteenth century, 
and after that the Spanish silver real. 
These rather rare coins had certain specific 
characteristics which made it impossible to sub- 
stitute others for them. Made of pure metal at 
a virtually constant weight of between 3 and 4 
grams, they were difficult to imitate and the heads 
with which they were stamped guaranteed only 
their conformity to this standard. They bore no 
unitary value whatever outside the realm which 
struck them. In trading between European 
countries these coins were exchanged by number 
or by weight in pure metal and they had no 
monetary status. In this respect, quite apart from 
the war, piracy and slave trading that accompa- 
nied it, the venture trading developed by the Eu- 
ropeans did not act as the cement of a world 
society. 
The same was true of the deposit certificates 
that circulated within the various European coun- 
tries. These certificates, which were not replaced 
by bank notes until a century or two later, had 
been issued from the fourteenth century by 
certain bankers against monies deposited in their 
coffers. They were the equivalent of a promise 
on the part of the banker of immediate payment 
on presentation and circulated like cash. 35

The sluggish development of industry and the 
crafts was in part the cause and in part the con- 
sequence of the monetary practices of the time. 
Not enough wealth was being produced for there 
to be a consensus in society about its distribution, 
and priority expenditure on wars, land, services 
and imported luxury goods benefited primarily 
the non-productive social categories. Production 
thus remained basically agricultural. Surpluses 
were sold locally or at regional fairs, only at cer- 
tain times of the year. Entrepreneurs had not yet 
arrived on the scene and the money dealers sym- 
bolized economic activity. 
Merchant bankers 
Among them were the merchant bankers, who 
reached their apogee during the sixteenth centu- 
ry and provide a perfect illustration of the nature 
of monetary operations at that time. Since the 
Middle Ages, there had been a redistribution of 
goods and raw materials between the various 
countries of Europe, and luxury goods from the 
Orient, and this gave rise to an intensive im- 
port/export trade concentrated on half a dozen 
large towns at which fairs were held periodically. 
The need to pay for goods purchased at these fairs 
gave rise to a specific activity—the conversion, 
at a price, of the various national units of account, 
that is, money-changing. 
Carrying on a tradition dating back to the 
Champagne Fairs of the thirteenth century, the 
merchant bankers had the monopoly of the pur- 
chase and resale of the ordinary merchants’ in- 
ternational debts (bills of exchange). They 
acquired their monopoly by their presence at all 
the European fairs, forming a network of agents 
through which other merchants were obliged to 
deal. This monopoly led to an agreed evaluation 
of each international debt expressed originally in 
the currency of a single country. In this way, 
during the sixteenth century, the merchant 
bankers, from their headquarters in Lyon, created 
what was in effect a Europe-wide monetary 
system. 
In determining the international value of the 
various currencies, the merchant bankers inevita- 
bly came into conflict with their merchant 
clients, from whom they extracted a margin of 
profit. They also found themselves in conflict 
with rulers, who established official rates of 
exchange for foreign coinage that was allowed to 
circulate in their respective countries. Many var- 
lations and rises in price resulted from these con- 
flicts of interest and these were aggravated by 
financial and banking rivalries within the circle 
of merchant bankers itself. 
Thus, although through its function as a com- 
mon yardstick of value money created social 
bonds, it was also, in practice, a cause of dissen- 
sion. And though, in sixteenth-century Europe, 
it had become the new divinity, money, like man 
in whose image it was created, was still seeking 
the limits of its power. u

a central banking authority, the Federal Reserve 
System, and to the adoption of the dollar as a lia-

The United States Constitution adopted in 
1789 did not grant the federal government the 
exclusive prerogative to issue coins and currency 
which was enjoyed by the Crown in European 
monetary systems. The absence of clear legisla- 
tion on currency matters created a myriad of 
diverse means of payment virtually without any 
central control or support. In these chaotic con- 
ditions, foreign coins circulated as legal tender 
until 1857, and as late as 1901 an Oregon silver 
mine was still issuing its own silver coins for 
“commercial use”. 
In the aftermath of widespread default of cur- 
rencies issued by individual states of the Union, 
they were prohibited from issuing paper money.

which were free to issue bank notes. The state 
of Kentucky, for example, created a private bank 
of which it was sole owner and proceeded to 
make payments with its notes. This individualist 
tradition in money matters found expression 
in “wildcat” banking and the prevalence in 
this period of state “free banking” laws which 
allowed any individual or association of individu- 
als to open a bank and issue bank notes without 
licence or control. 
The absence of a national bank meant that 
even the federal government had to undertake its 
financial transactions either through private 
banks or in specie (coin or bullion). In 1840, 
President Martin Van Buren instituted the 
“Independent Treasury System” which handled 
government transactions through nationwide sub- 
offices. Since the Treasury was not a bank, and 
could not issue notes, all government receipts and 
expenditures had to be made in gold or silver. 
Expenditures in excess of taxation could not be 
financed except by issue of government debt sub- 
scribed in gold. 
The Civil War 
and the first greenbacks 
Many currency arrangements of the late 
nineteenth century can be traced back to the need 
to finance the Civil War of 1861 to 1865. The 
Treasury first issued “demand notes” which were 
not legal tender, but were convertible into gold. 
But the weak gold reserves of the Treasury soon 
led to the suspension of convertibility of these 
notes. Thereafter the war effort was financed by 
an issue of “United States Notes”, based on 
nothing more substantial than the faith and credit 
of the government. They were popularly called 
“greenbacks”, the name by which the United 
States dollar is still known throughout the world. 
The issue of greenbacks had been limited to 
$433 million, so in the face of increasing difficulty 
in borrowing and of rising expenditures Treasury 
secretary Salmon P. Chase decided to apply “free 
banking” on a national scale. The National Bank 
Act of 1863 allowed any group of five persons 
to form a “National Banking Association” 
and issue ‘National Bank Notes” in an amount 
equal to their holdings of federal government 
bonds deposited with the Comptroller of the 
Currency.? 
To prevent competition from state bank 
notes, a 10 per cent tax was placed on the latter 
which soon drove them out of circulation. The 
state banks countered by offering payment ser- 
vices by cheque against deposit accounts, which 
proved to be an attractive substitute for National 
Bank Notes. 
 
By the end of the Civil War, the multiplicity 
of means of payment representing the liabilities 
of thousands of state banks had been largely 
reduced to greenbacks and National Bank Notes, 
neither of which were convertible into specie, but 
the issue of which was strictly limited. The 
money supply of the United States was thus 
rigidly fixed, unable to respond to either fluctu- 
ations in trade, nor the frequent panics that 
resulted from the failures of the unregulated state 
banks (two years after the introduction of free 
banking in Michigan, for example, all of its forty 
banks had failed). 
The dollar set firmly 
on the gold standard 
As the United States was basically an agricultural 
country, the demands on currency were linked 
to the harvest. As crops were sold, farmers’ bank 
deposits built up in the agricultural regions, 
leading to a shortage of funds in the urban banks 
of the east. The National Bank system of small 
individual units had no mechanism to recycle 
excess funds, such as was possible in a multi- 
branch bank. Furthermore, without a central 
bank to lend reserves, there was no way of 
meeting these fluctuations apart from sharp 
changes in interest rates, or declaring bank failure. 
Together with the net drain of specie to the 
Independent Treasury and the absence of strict 
banking regulations, this led to extreme instabil- 
ity and frequent crises. 
This instability was attributed by some to a 
lack of specie, an argument exploited by those 
interested in making silver the basis of the United

States monetary system. A “Free Silver Move- 
ment” launched by William Jennings Bryan 
demanded the free coinage of silver as legal 
tender. The 1878 Bland-Allison Act provided for 
Treasury silver certificates which became legal 
tender in 1886 and the Sherman Silver Act of 
1890 made the Treasury virtually liable to 
purchase the entire output of United States silver 
mines. In 1882 a similar provision was made for 
gold certificates, but neither measure gave the 
hoped-for elasticity to the currency. 
The system created serious international as 
well as domestic problems, for fluctuations in the 
internal demands for liquidity could only be met 
by international gold movements, which in turn 
created instability in the international monetary 
system. This was particularly striking in 1893, 
when the fear that the United States would not 
honour its government debt in gold and would 
instead pay in silver, whose price was collapsing 
on world markets, led to a massive outflow of 
gold and widespread bank failures. 


### 85182: The Rise of the greenback

Creation of 
the Federal Reserve system 
The outflow was reversed by the Gold Standard 
Act of 1900, which set the dollar firmly on the 
gold standard’ and required National Banks to 
back their note issues with gold. Between 1899 
and 1910 the gold holdings of the public trebled, 
as did those of the Treasury. The proportion of 
the world’s monetary gold stock held in the 
United States rose from around 15 to 30 per cent, 
at a time when many other countries (Austro- 
Hungary, Russia, Japan) were also adopting the 
gold standard. As the expansion of gold supplies 
was slowing, the accumulation of gold in the 
United States caused more difficulties than had 
the previous outflow, largely because once the 
gold entered the Treasury it could not be drawn 
out except to finance a balance of payments 
deficit (the country was then in surplus). Given 
the Independent Treasury System, gold could not 
be used as the basis to create money or to serve 
as lending of last resort. 
Another banking. crisis in 1907 forcefully 
reminded legislators of the need for a national 
institution which could respond to fluctuations 
in the demand for liquidity in some other way 
than by attracting gold from abroad. Such an 
institution was finally set up by the Federal 
Reserve Act of 1913. 
The Act divided the country into twelve dis- 
tricts, each with its own Federal Reserve Bank, 
which began operations on 2 November 1914. The 
existing National Banks were obliged to join the 39

system by purchasing stock in the Federal Reserve 
Banks. The latter were authorized to issue a new 
type of currency, the Federal Reserve Note, legal 
tender for all debts and the liability of both the 
banks and the United States government. 
The new note was to replace National Bank 
Notes. The issue was backed by gold to a mini- 
mum of 40 per cent, the remaining notes being 
issued against commercial paper and other eligible 
assets acquired by discount from the member 
banks. This arrangement satisfied the need for an 
elastic means of payment which could expand and 
contract with fluctuations in trade and the situa- 
tion of the banking system. A member bank that 
was short of liquidity could acquire it by dis- 
counting its assets in exchange for Federal Reserve 
Notes at its District Reserve Bank. 
The Federal Reserve Board of governors, 
appointed by the President and based in 
Washington, D.C., sat rather uneasily over the 
Federal Reserve Banks which were owned and 
run by private bankers. It was by no means clear 
who was responsible for currency policy, but the 
bankers clearly had the upper hand. 
However, the two prerequisites for the sub- 
sequent international dominance of the dollar had 
now been acquired: the massive accumulation of 
world gold stock in the United States, which 
obliged the international monetary system to 
move onto a gold-exchange standard, and the 
creation of a unified national currency issued 
by a single authority with lender of last resort 
capability.

### 85182: The Rise of the greenback

The position of the United Kingdom was 
weakened by the 1914-1918 war, and the dollar 
entered the inter-war return to gold on a stronger 
basis than sterling. Moreover the United States 
economy, after a short recession, was to prosper 
in the “roaring 20s” of radio and automobiles. 
The massive movement of investment funds 
to the United States, first caused by rapid growth 
and the stock market boom, then by high interest 
rates used to try to break the speculative rise on 
Wall Street, severely disrupted international 
finance and broke the stability of exchange rates. 
The stock market crash of 1929 brought about 
massive bank failures, which were far beyond the 
ability of the Federal Reserve to offset, and the 
consequent collapse of investment values was 
responsible for a worldwide depression. 
The evidence of widespread bank fraud 
which emerged after the Wall Street crash 
suggested deficiencies in the supervisory function 
of the Federal Reserve Board and in its ability to 
regulate monetary policy to prevent even well- 
run banks from failing. A series of measures, 
including the nationalization of gold, the devalu- 
ation of the dollar to $35 per ounce of gold, and 
the 1935 Banking Act which gave the Federal 
Reserve Board control over monetary policy, 
finally created a system equivalent in its powers 
and duties to a European central bank. 
Thus the inter-war period strengthened both 
the reserve position of the United States and the 
domestic financial system. The country was ready 
to take over London’s role as banker to the world 
when the outbreak of the Second World War 
made the City unsafe and transformed the United 
Kingdom from an international creditor to an 
international debtor. The United States became 
the world’s major creditor. Any country which 
wanted to buy goods for post-war reconstruction 
had to acquire dollars, and the dollar thus became 
the pre-eminent international currency. u

     Problems “= 
an 
paradoxes 
of money 
The complex role of the monetary system 
in modern societies 
  
Ecoromsrs often seem to have a very curious 
view of money. In the eighteenth century, when 
banks were beginning to issue notes, which made 
it possible to create money without being depen- 
dent upon the production of precious metals, 
economists spread the idea that money was a 
secondary phenomenon which could be ignored 
in the study of fundamental economic laws. Yet 
this viewpoint, which has been dominant ever 
since, does not prevent economists from ful-

Nevertheless, it was the problem of the’ 
monetary analysis of society that gave impetus 
to the development of economic thought in 
Renaissance Europe. Money was seen as both the 
symbol of merchants’ wealth and an attribute of 
royal power. At the time, the relationship be- 
tween princes and merchants was the central 
theme of monetary analysis and the basis of an 
economic theory of society. 
This approach was to change radically in the 
eighteenth century, as witness these words of the 
British philosopher David Hume (1711-1776): 
“Money is not, properly speaking, one of the sub- 
jects of commerce; but only the instrument 
which men have agreed upon to facilitate the 
exchange of one commodity for another. It is 
none of the wheels of trade: it is the oil which 
renders the motion of the wheels more smooth 
and easy.”

This purely instrumental view of money was 
part of a vision of society in which the market 
was the sole regulating mechanism. Its effect was 
to leave the monarch, or the state, on the side- 
lines with no co-ordinating role to play between 
private agents, since these were all merchants

naturally interlinked within a “commercial 
society”. It also reduced money to little more 
than a veil that cloaked the exchange of goods 
and that had to be pulled aside if the realities of 
economic phenomena were to be analysed. Any 
attempt by the state to take an active hand in the 
management of money was therefore seen as a 
threat to social harmony, which the laws of com- 
petition were assumed to engender automatically. 
Thus the progressive ‘‘dematerialization” of 
money is seen as a means of simplifying the proce- 
dures of trade. Some object in common currency 
within a community is used as money. We have 
seen this role fulfilled successively by some form 
of metal, gold or silver bullion, coins, gold 
certificates, bank notes, cheques and credit 
cards—and electronic money is on its way. As a 
result of this “dematerialization” process, money 
has become nothing more than a transfer mechan- 
ism with no link to any material object as a 
guarantee of its value. 
A form of wealth 
or a transfer mechanism? 
However well it matches up to a view of society 
that favours the regulating influence of the 
market, this liberal, instrumental conception of 
money is not without its own paradoxes. Chief 
of these is that, leaving aside any question of 
intervention by the state, the very nature of 
monetary exchanges makes the existence of 
“good” money, that is to say an instrument that 
properly fulfils its function as a medium of 
exchange, difficult, if not impossible. 
Unlike barter, in which the buyer of item X 
is at the same time the seller of item Y, exchanges 
involving money comprise two distinct transac- 
tions which do not take place simultaneously. 
The vendor first sells Y for money (i.e. he buys 
nothing), and then uses this money to buy X (i.e. 
he sells nothing). If money is merely an instru- 
ment of exchange, the person involved in the 
transaction will not go ahead with it unless it is 
to his advantage. According to the textbooks, one 
advantage is that it is easier to find a buyer of Y 
and a seller of X than to uncover the double 
coincidence of a single person wanting to buy Y 
and sell X. 
The problem remains, however, of ensuring 
that this advantage is not reduced to nothing by 
some impediment that will prevent the individual 
from using the money obtained from selling Y 
to buy X, or that he may not obtain as much of 
X with money as he would have done by barter.

tary exchange method—and it is essential to the

should do so—it 1s necessary that the money he 
has obtained as a seller remains a store of purchas- 
ing power throughout the period of time that 
elapses between the two transactions. 
Herein lies the paradox. If the instrument 
chosen as money fails properly to fulfil its func- 
tion as a store of purchasing power (in the sense 
that there is nothing to guarantee that this pur- 
chasing power will remain constant), those who 
hold it will be induced to get rid of it as soon 
as they have received it, or even simply to go back 
to barter. This is often seen to occur in situations 
of hyperinflation.

A      
individual will tend to hold it as a form of wealth, 
taking it out of circulation and preventing it from 
fulfilling its other function as a medium of 
exchange. 
This phenomenon, which has become 
known as “Gresham’s Law” (after the sixteenth- 
century English financier Sir Thomas Gresham 
who observed that “Bad money drives out 
good”), was recognized very early on with regard 
to metal-based coins. However, it is equally 
applicable to fiat money* since it is based on the 
trust placed in it by business as a store of pur- 
chasing power. In the 1930s, the British 
economist John Maynard Keynes maintained that 
“liquidity preference” was the main reason why a 
monetary economy was unable to achieve a stable 
level of full employment. At the international 
level “Triffin’s dilemma” (so named for the 
American economist Professor Robert Triffin) 
highlighted the fact that, in the 1950s, the United 
States was no Jonger in a position both to ensure 
world liquidity and maintain confidence in the 
dollar as a reserve currency. 
It is thus illusory to consider money as 
merely a medium of exchange engendered by 
market forces; and if it is taken as a principle that 
business people “choose” to hold money simply 
on the basis of an economic calculation, this will 
increase the risk of monetary disorder.

In opposition to the liberal, instrumental the- 
ory of money there is the institutional, interven- 
ttonist approach, which introduces a number of 
interesting concepts. Money is not an appendage 
but the sine gua non of the existence of the 
market, and its appropriate management 
produces less disorder and makes it possible to 
act favourably on the economy as a whole. 
This concept, however, became associated 


### 85183: Problems and paradoxes of money

with the notion that money is basically created 
by the state and that the state’s monetary power 
is reflected in the institution of legal tender for 
fiat money. This was notably the case after the 
First World War. This reduction of money to the 
status of an attribute of state power itself led to 
some paradoxical situations, the main one being 
that the history of money is the history of the 
struggle of private individuals against this aspect 
of state power. 
Constraints on the monetary 
power of the state 
This situation had arisen before with metal-based 
money. In the sixteenth century, this money did 
not circulate as stamped gold or silver 
ingots but as coins, the minting of which was the 
monopoly of the monarch and to which he 
attributed a legal value in units of account. Gold 
and silver were not commodity money; they 
became metal coinage by royal decree. Private 
business was unceasingly hostile to this legally 
fixed circulating value and instead adopted 
“voluntary values” which were usually higher. 
The depreciation of the currency that resulted— 
because in practice the unit of account represent- 
ed less gold or silver than officially maintained— 
was effectively a form of inflation, which went 
to show that the monarch could not simply regu- 
late money as he thought fit. 
The monetary power of the state was thus 
subject to two important constraints. Firstly, the 
decisions taken by private business had their 
effect on the creation of money, both on the 
supply side (the impossibility of ensuring rigorous 
control of the minting of metal coinage; the rela- 
tive autonomy enjoyed by the banks in the field 
of fiat money), and on the demand side (the 
volume of money created being ultimately depen- 
dent on the decisions of individuals as to whether 
to bring their gold to the mint or to borrow from 
the banks). Secondly, the attitude of private 
individuals with regard to the circulation of cur- 
rency could express their resistance to public con- 
trol of the currency and lead to its internal 
depreciation (inflation) or external depreciation 
(a fall in the exchange rate). 
If these two conflicting views of money are 
considered together, it can be seen that money 
is neither a form of merchandise (with its own 
intrinsic value) nor an attribute of state power. 
Rather, it is a prerequisite for the existence of 
markets and the expression of a certain social 
cohesion that enables the state to fulfil its

functions. A monetary regime is a set of rules of 
conduct specific to a given society. 
What then is the difference between the 
money of the past and that of today? It is often 
stated that modern money is fiat money, whereas 
the money of the past was commodity money; 
that the metal-based money of the past had its 
own intrinsic value regulated by the mechanisms 
of the metal market while the “dematerialized” 
money of today is based solely on the confidence 
inspired by the state, which imposes its legal 
tender. Such an assessment is inadequate. No 
  
monetary economy can exist without some form 
of abstract unit of account, and this can perfectly 
well coexist with a metal-based coinage. 
Money today 
Modern money can, however, be defined in terms 
of two characteristics of a bank-based monetary 
regime. Firstly, the banks’ issuing function 
enables a certain category of people, the entre- 
preneurs, to obtain money on the basis of a 
promise of future activity. Even though bank credit 
is today made available to people of all economic 
categories, there is a fundamental difference 
between those—in particular wage earners—who 
can borrow on the strength of income received 
in the past (or the probability that they will con- 
tinue to receive such income in the future), and 
those—the entrepreneurs—to whom credit is 
advanced on the basis of a planned trading project 
the success of which (on which repayment of the 
loan depends) is uncertain. This credit issuing 
function of the banks thus introduces an element 
of social discrimination. It is, however, a factor 
that promotes economic dynamism, since, as 
Keynes observed, “it allows entrepreneurs to go 
ahead with assurance”. 
Secondly, the banking system is hierarchical 
in organization, with the activity of the second 
rank of banks being dependent on the existence

of a lender of last resort. This “banks” bank”, or 
central bank, plays a dual role. On the one hand 
it acts as a clearing house for payments between 
banks and to this effect sets the bank money rate 
in terms of the national monetary unit. Contrary 
to what is generally thought, a franc, a dollar or 
a pound issued by one commercial bank is not 
the same as that issued by another. The accep- 
tance of cheques drawn on this or that bank— 
and thus the use of bank deposits as money— 
implies a system of compensatory payments 
organized by a central body. 
On the other hand, the central bank guaran- 
tees the other banks against defaults on loans, 
which are a risk inherent in the loan mechanisms 
described above, by allowing these banks to 
refinance such loans in central bank money. This 
method of insurance, while certainly not auto- 
matic, tends through its effects on inflation and 
the exchange rate to spread over society as a 
whole the burden of the consequences of the 
failure of some entrepreneurs to meet their obli- 
gation to repay loans. Nevertheless, as we see 
today, it provides the system with a degree of 
elasticity which tends to prevent the multiplica- 
tion of bankruptcies. 
These characteristics demonstrate that the 
origins of the modern monetary system predate 
the time when it supplanted metal-based coinage. 
To find them we have to go back to the sixteenth 
century and the relationship between metal 
coinage minted by monarchs—central money— 
and the bills of exchange that the Italian merchant 
bankers circulated throughout Europe—bank 
money. 
The yardstick of social intercourse, money 
is the embodiment of the rules that make possible 
the complex interplay of economies. Paradoxical 
In nature since it appears to be the consequence 
of the economic activity of which it is a pre- 
requisite, it is hardly surprising that money is 
both a matter of practical concern and a source 
of theoretical debate. n

### 85184: The Struggle of day and night

IRENE" fF 
THE STRUGGLE OF DAY AND NIGHT 
BY ABDOL-HOSSEYN ZARRINKOUB 
A. Iranians, whatever their reli- 
gious beliefs, language or origins and 
wherever they live, are strongly at- 
tached to Now Rouz (New Year). This 
festival, which does not feature in the 
Islamic lunar calendar, begins the 
solar year at the spring equinox, 21 
March. Lasting around two weeks, it 
is the longest of all Iranian feasts and 
its rites are the richest in symbolism. 
The ceremonial includes customs 
from pre-Islamic festivals and rites 
introduced by people of non-Iranian 
origin, such as the Jews, and even 
berrowings from rites practised 
elsewhere. 
Two weeks before Now Rouz, each 
household traditionally grows a plate 
of sprouts of wheat, barley or lentils 
as omens of a good harvest or as 
tokens of fruitfulness in the future. 
This significant ritual is followed by 
two important celebrations which 
mark the closing days of the year and 
prepare for Now Rouz proper. 
At nightfall on “Ember Wednes- 
day" (Tchaharshamba-sour;) a bonfire 
of brambles and other dry plants is 
lit. Men and women, old and young 
leap over the flames shouting “Fire 
that burns! Fire! Fire! May your red 
come to me and my yellow go to 
you!” The light of the flames symbo- 
lizes the Sun. By challenging the set- 
ting Sun to shine more brightly and 
to compete with the fire, they urge 
it to throw off its winter torpor. Once 
the fire has gone out, earthenware 
pots and vases filled with water, and 
a variety of other objects, are hurled 
from the top of the house to shouts 
of “Dard-o bal! Dard-o bala!” ("Pain 
and unhappiness!”). Wednesday be- 
ing traditionally considered as a day 
of ill-omen, in this way misfortune is 
averted and unhappiness symbolically 
banished from the house. 
On the same day, people try to 
foresee the future. The omens are 
read in various ways. Women who 
want a child, girls who have not yet 
found a husband, men who are hop- 
ing to conclude a successful business 
deal or even to get married, go out 
into the streets or stay behind closed 
  
  
  
  
  
  
doors eavesdropping on conversa- 
tions between people they do not 
know. They interpret the words they 
overhear as omens of the future and 
make wishes and pray to try to ward 
off misfortune. Another custom is for 
women and children in disguise, their 
faces hidden, to go out into the 
streets at twilight carrying an empty 
receptacle and bang on doors with 
a spoon. They say nothing but go on 
knocking until someone opens a door 
and gives them a present. 
Purification and fireworks 
The second end-of-year celebration, 
the “Day of Reckoning” (rouz-e 
barét) is the Iranian day of the dead. 
On the last Thursday of the year alms 
and gifts are distributed at the 
cemetery: money, food, halva or new 
clothes are given so that the poor can 
celebrate the feast. The house is 
cleaned from top to bottom—this is 
    
a nm of a pre-Islamic festival. In 
this way the living seek to pay their 
debts to the departed and attract the 
benevolence of their ancestors. 
The “spring cleaning” (Khana 
Takani) done before New Year is 
more than just a cleaning operation. 
From cellar to attic, from carpets to 
bedding, everything must be made 
as good as new. A new life is dawn- 
ing and the house must be symboli- 
cally purified and thoroughly cleansed 
as if it were a human bedy, by being 
carefully washed and by wearing new 
clothes. 
For the New Year ceremonial, the 
plate of sprouting grain and the tray 
of the “seven sin” must be placed cn 
the Now Rouz cloth in front of a mir- 
ror lit by as many candles as there are 
members of the household, a copy 
of the Qur'an, a bowl of milk, a bow! 
of yoghurt, and gifts of coins. While 
they are waiting for the New Year to

begin, the parents and other older 
people pray that the year will be pro- 
pitious and recite the Qur'an to bring 
blessings and happiness to the family. 
Immediately afterwards, sweetmeats 
are eaten. Their taste presages a 
happy year. 
The tray of the ‘seven sin” con- 
tains seven products whose names in 
Persian, Turkish or Arabic begin with 
the letter sin, the initial letter of the 
Persian words for green (sabz) and 
white {safid), colours which symbo- 
lize respectively the renewal of spring- 
time and the purity that wards off 
demons. Today the tradition has 
changed: everyone can choose seven 
symbols representing renewal, crea- 
tion, abundance and wealth. The 
number 7 is a sacred number, as it 
was for the Babylonians and the an- 
cient Hebrews, linked to the idea of 
creation which runs through all the 
symbolism of Now Rouz. 
On New Year's Eve, fireworks are 
set off in the courtyard of the house 
or on the terrace. They symbolize the 
combat between dark, gloomy 
winter and bright, joyful spring; the 
victory of fire over darkness, a re- 
enactment of the moment when the 
world of shadows is attacked by the 
world of light, the moment of 
Creation. 
On the morning of the big day the 
children are given gold coins, cakes 
and hard-boiled eggs that have been 
painted, decorated and wrapped as 
gifts. They have been cooked in a 
brew of onion peel, walnut shells or

the streams and rivers swollen with

tional games and sports, and the girls 
weave together fresh herbs, singing

teenth day, next year, at my hus-

constantly recurring feature: the con-

keeping with the old Zoroastrian du-

should attribute the invention of this 
feast to Jamshid or Feridun, legend- 
ary kings and divine heroes who 
triumphed over the forces of dark- 
ness. But if Islam has kept up this 
Zoroastrian feast, it is because of the

role it plays in the stabilization of the 
fiscal year and also because of its 
jovial and lively ceremonies which 
were highly esteemed at the courts 
of the caliphs and the sultans. The

Now Rouz explain why the sufis are 
interested in this festival. [| 
spent part of my childhood at 
Museke Marca), a poor district of the 
city of Luanda where, people used to 
say, “the children only bathe when 
rain fills the lagoon of Moreira”. 
There, fifty-odd years ago, my family 
and | enjoyed the bittersweet 
privilege of taking part in that match- 
less popular spectacle, the Luanda 
carnival. 
The city was divided into districts, 
each of which was the territory of 
one of the traditional troupes known 
as turmas which with their "kings" 
were the life and soul of the carnival. 
The two most famous turmas were 
O Coragdo (The Heart) and Os Inveja- 
dos (The envied ones). Members of 
the troupes practised a kind of verbal 
jousting known as kazakuta, which 


### 85185: Carnival in Luanda

CARNIVAL IN LUANDA 
BY DOMINGOS VAN-DUNEM 
is still the most typical expression of 
Luandan folklore. 
The turmas began to mobilize in 
December, when their most gifted 
members rehearsed songs for the car- 
nival. The songs were sung either in 
Kimbundu, one of the national lan- 
guages, if they were about unusual 
or satirical subjects, or in Portuguese 
or in both languages if they were in- 
offensive or ambiguous. The singers 
met secretly in private homes or in 
rented halls. Violations of secrecy 
were severely punished. Dance re- 
hearsals were also held in secret. 
The carnival supported a small in- 
dustry, notably the metalworker's art. 
Domingos Veneno—his name meant 
“venom”, for although he was a 
skinny fellow he was a doughty  
fighter—is still remembered for the 
lamps and the objects decorated with 
images and amulets which he made 
in complete secrecy. He was a devot- 
ed supporter of O Coracdo, and 
worked exclusively for them. Design- 
ers and dressmakers also worked 
secretly and exclusively for their 
favourite groups. 
The first public rehearsal was held 
on the first Sunday of January, and 
the dress rehearsal took place on the 
Saturday before Ash Wednesday 
when people prayed to the divinity 
that the carnival should take place in 
"peace and tranquillity”. It cannot be 
denied, however, that violent scuffles 
often broke out between the turmas. 
Early on the Sunday morning the 
flags of the turmas were hoisted at 47

the gateways to the districts, in the 
midst of crowds of excited children. 
Then, to the sound of shouting and 
applause, they were carried down- 
town by a gang of strapping fellows. 
More and more people joined in the 
processions as they wended their way 
to Ambuilas, a sports ground in the 
middle of a big open space where the 
rival groups paraded side by side. The 
group that won most applause was 
judged the winner—the verdict was 
never disputed. 
That afternoon all the huts were 
empty. No one would have dreamed 
of missing the festival. People flocked 
in, even from other towns. The at- 
mosphere was euphoric. The mem- 
bers of the turmas wore devils’ masks 
and brightly coloured costumes much 
admired by the crowd. Whistling and 
trumpeting rent the air, drums rolled, 
the crowds sang in unison. Then 
everyone returned to Ambullas for 
another competition. 
0 Caracdo and A Fineza (Subtlety), 
eternal rivals, submitted their 
costumes to the judgement of the 
public. 
The king of A Fineza, Kamalundu, 
a cobbler with bulging eyes, held 
himself majestically, leaning slightly 
forward. He waved his right hand, 
which he had slipped into a zinc 
gauntlet, another emblem of the two 
turmas. 
The enemy king, Epifanio, now ap- 
peared. He too leaned forward slight- 
ly, brandishing a gauntlet which, as 
a metalworker, he had made himself. 
Both kings proudly entered the lists, 
showing off their beautiful costumes 
which were inspired by the royal 
finery of old Europe. On their heads 
glittered zinc crowns—we called 
them helmets—which each one had 
decorated so as to outdo the other. 
Everyone danced frenetically. The 
kings, enthroned amidst their court, 
dominated the turmas, surrounded 
by figures in disguise, some wearing 
black cloaks as emblems of the stu- 
dents they would never be, others 
dressed in doctors’ or nurses’ smocks. 
Then all present walked to the palace 
to join up with other groups and pay 
their respects to the governor, who 
stood on the balcony with his distin- 
guished guests and saluted the 
revellers. 
Tuesday was the day to end all 
days. No one let up for a second. An 
enormous crowd raced here, there 
and everywhere, enjoying every 
minute. Lovers of jousting tried their 
hand at kazakuta. Peals of laughter 
rang out incessantly as the kazaku- 
teiros made fun of everyone and 
mocked the ups and downs of life. 
Washerwomen cast an irresistible 
spell as they cleverly satirized ladies” 
who only the day before had been 
lowly servants. Greengrocers 
described their tangles with cus- 
tomers who did nothing but grum- 
ble and protest about the poor 
quality and high price of their 
vegetables. 
The governor declared a holiday, 
and we all lived each moment as if 
it were our last, as if we were afraid 
of losing forever the delights of this 
incomparable festival. Men and 
women abandoned themselves to 
delirium. A mother wandered 
around, desperately beating a tin can 
with her weary hand as she asked 
whether anyone happened to have 
seen her son, who had got lost in the 
general confusion. 
Girls dressed in beautiful white 
dominoes alighted like butterflies, 
arousing the curiosity of the boys and 
the jealousy of lovers. 
So the carnival went on until 
Wednesday—Ash Wednesday ac- 
cording to the liturgical calendar, the 
Wednesday of mabangas, the shell- 
fish of good luck. 
The troupes were tired. The masks 
were falling to pieces. Four people 
held out a sheet for a collection to 
buy mabangas, which were plentiful 
in that region and, copiously washed 
down, made a meal during which 
people took stock of the year that 
was past and made plans for the 
future. Rn

### 85186: A Museum for peace

A MUSEUM FOR PEACE 
BY HOWARD BRABYN 
| you stand in the grassed over 
quarry that now forms part of the 
gardens of the Memorial Museum for 
Peace, on the outskirts of Caen in 
Normandy, France, your eye will 
perhaps be caught by a seemingly 
insignificant, newly-planted sapling. 
Under two metres in height, there 
is nothing to distinguish it from the 
other trees in the garden except the 
plague that informs the curious that it 
Is a gift from the people of the United 
States, a sequoia sempervirens, a 
Redwood, the world's tallest species 
of tree, that one day will tower above 
its neighbours at its maximum height 
of 90 metres or more. 
Opened in 1988, the Memorial 
Museum for Peace was built to com- 
memorate those who died in the 
Battle of Normandy in 1944, the big- 
gest battle in the history of mankind 
It also honours the people of Caen, 
who saw their city reduced to rubble 
around them in the struggle for 
liberation. 
But the Museum is not just another 
memorial, not just another war 
museum full of rusty war relics and a 
somewhat distasteful hint of glorying 
over the vanquished enemy. It is a 
monument to the obstinate determi- 
nation of human beings to safeguard 
their freedom, and a laboratory in 
which to study the causes and 
prevention of armed conflict. Today, 
it could well claim to be on the way 
to becoming the world’s first Univer- 
sity of Peace. 
In January this year, thirty-four 
selected American students are to 
come together at the University of 
Texas, Austin, to take part in the first 
Normandy Scholar Program, spon- 
sored by the US Normandy Founda- 
tion and devised with the advice of 
a board of leading American histori- 
ans. They will spend four weeks at 
the University of Texas, eight weeks 
at the Memonal Museum for Peace, 
and a final two weeks back in Austin, 
According to Anthony Stout, Chair- 
man of the US Normandy Founda- 
tion, whose father was closely 
involved with General Eisenhower in 
the planning and execution of the 
Normandy landings, “the idea of this 
course Is to teach the Second World 
War as a ‘case study’ and to find out 
how people who don’t want to wind 
up in a war wind up in a war”. 
This “case study’ approach will in- 
volve an in-depth examination of con- 
ditions in Europe before, during and 
after the two World Wars with the 
aim of finding answers to such ques- 
tions as. 
* How did the Second World War 
happen so soon after another, gruell- 
ing war between many of the same 
combatants, and could it have been 
avoided? 
* Why were the Allies reluctant to 
resist the Nazis until it was almost too 
late? 
* What role did world economic con- 
ditions play as the war approached? 
* What role was played by the press, 
the Churches and other institutions? 
Many of these questions and 
others raised by the conflict are as 
relevant to peace now as they were 
in 1939. Many are central to issues 
being faced and debated by leaders 
today and to issues which will be 
faced as society moves into the next 
century. 
The initial pilot programme will. 
consist of four major courses covering 
the economic background, the cul- 
tural and intellectual history of France 
in the European context from the 
1880s, communications and an as- 
sessment of the role of all the media, 
and leadership and strategy befcre 
and during the Second World War. 
The Memorial Museum for Peace 
provides the ideal setting for studies 
of this kind. Located on the outskirts 
of Caen, the pivot around which the 
Battle of Normandy revolved, only a 
few miles from the beaches at which 
the Allied forces landed, it is sited 
literally on top of the underground 
bunker that served as the command 
post of General Wilhelm Richter of 
the German 716th Infantry Division 
which faced the Anglo-Canadian 
forces advancing on Caen. Even 
today there are many people still 
living in the area who can give first- 
hand accounts of life under the Nazi 
occupation and of the battle that 
raged throughout Normandy for 
seventy-six days. 
The Museum is designed as “a 
voyage through history’, starting 
with the signing of the armistice in 
1918. Visitors enter a huge cylinder, 
round which a descending spiral 
ramp leads them through an impres- 
sive collection of photographs, 
posters, and audio-visual displays 
covering the period 1918 to 1938 
The scenes depicting “the failure of 
peace and the rise of the dictators” 
include not only political events such 
as the coming to power of Adolf 
Hitler or the Anschluss, but also back- 
ground evocations of the Jazz Age, 
the world economic depression, the 
Wall Street crash of 1929, and so on. 
  
A j 
The ramp leads down to a large 
black dome where a huge, out-of- 
focus picture of Hitler is projected in 
an eerie violet light and the dictator's 
voice Is heard as a menacing, incom- 
prehensible mumble. The world has 
reached the pit of desparr. 
As visitors move out of the cylinder 
they come to the first of a maze of 
rooms in which are successively 
depicted the French surrender in 
1940; France under the Nazi occupa- 
tion and the Vichy Government, with 
all the horror of the execution of 
hostages and resistance fighters, the 
desperate daily search for food; the 
entry of the United States into the 
fighting and the period of "Total 
War"; a restrained treatment of the 
deportations, the concentration 
camps and the mass murder of the 
Jews of Europe, films of the key 
points of the war such as the Battle 
of Britain, Midway, El-Alamein, 
Guadalcanal and Stalingrad. 
The next section of the Museum is 
perhaps more conventional, with dis- 
plays of weapons and military equip- 
ment that reflect the technological 
and industrial progress that the 
urgent demands of war provoked. 
After climbing up a short stairway 
visitors enter an area which sets the 
scene for a truly amazing documen- 
tary film, projected on a wide, split 
screen and simultaneously showing 
the Normandy landings as seen from 
both the Allled and German sides. 
The grand finale of the visit is 
reserved for a film on the defence of 
liberty and human rights, an expla- 
nation of the philosophy of the 
Museum and a special message of 
peace and hope. 
Writing about the Museum, its 
founding father Jean-Marie Girault, 
French senator and mayor of Caen, 
declared’ “It is our intention to arouse 
the consciousness of all men and 
women who visit the Museum, from 
whatever country, so that they may 
realize that the tragedies surrounding 
liberty are as much a part of our con- 
temporary world as they are of his- 
tory, and that it is imperative that 
each individual person should renew 
his efforts on behalf of peace, frater- 
nity and solidarity.” 
This intention the Memorial 
Museum for Peace triumphantly 
fulfils Inside its walls there is no 
glorification of war but an unforget- 
table lesson in peace. un

Letters to the Editor 
Don’t smoke, subscribe! 
There has been a striking improve- 
ment in the quality of your magazine 
and its illustrations, but the subscrip- 
tion price seems to be at the mit of 
what my pupils can afford. However, 
it's cheaper than buying cigarettes... 
Paul Fidani 
Lycée Montmajour, Arles (France) 
Putting the record straight 
I should like to make some comments 
on the interesting article on Arab 
mathematics by my colleague Roshdi 
Rashed which appeared in your 
November 1989 issue, A mathemat- 
ical mystery tour. 
If | am not mistaken, the author has 
grouped together as ‘‘Arab 
mathematicians” all the scholars who 
wrote and published their discoveries 
In the Arabic language. This is a use- 
ful designation as the vast majority 
of scientists and thinkers of the 
Islamic world did use that language. 
But I think we should remember 
that some non-Arabs used Arabic in 
their scientific work. Several of the 
scholars mentioned in Mr. Rashed'’s 
article, including Kharazmi (rather 
than al-Khwarzmi} and Khayyam 
(rather than al-Khayyam), were 
Iranian. Furthermore, some of them 
wrote poetry in their mother tongue. 
Khayyam’s quatrains are a monument 
of Persian, not Arabic, literature. 
| am not raising this point out of 
chauvinism but simply in order to put 
the cultural record straight and above 
all to emphasize that the Islamic 
world stretches far beyond the 
boundaries of Arab language and 
culture. 
Yann Richard 
Chatenay-Malabry (France) 
Inherited v. acquired 
characteristics 
| was irritated by the following state- 
ment in Jacques Richardson's article 
on mapping the human genome 
(“Science and Society”, September 
1989): “In reproduction, a father and 
a mother contribute a gene cor- 
responding to every chromosome 
pair found in their offspring. It is the 
combination of the similarities and 
differences that make each of 
us...mentally alert, musical, manually 
dexterous, sports-minded, and so 
on.” 
I'm not an expert in biology but I've 
been interested in the subject for a 
long time, especially in genetics with 
all its vast perspectives. According to 
everything I've read or discovered, the 
idea that people's intelligence, ability, 
or even tastes should depend on their 
genetic makeup has more to do with 
ideology than science. 
I know that “signed articles express 
the opinions of the authors and do 
not necessarily represent the opinicns 
of Unesco or those of the editors of 
the Unesco Courier”, but I'm afraid 
that these few words are too fraught 
with consequences for the human 
race for me to let them pass without 
comment, 
Christophe Meslin

Message of peace 
from Anatolia 
The preamble to Unesca's Constitu- 
tion contains the following words: 
“Since wars begin in the minds of 
men, it is in the minds of men that 
the defences of peace must be con- 
structed.” 
| don't know what the third world 
war will be like, but the fourth will 
be fought with sticks and stones, as 
Einstein said. Both world wars caused 
terrible suffering, and yet people still 
make war. It's shameful! 
Education is the only solution. 
Young people must be taught the 
spint of peace from childhoed on. 
They must hate war. They must hold 
out flowers and olive branches to 
those who want war. War must not 
triumph over reason. 
Orhan Vatansever 
Anatolia (Turkey) 
An idea to save the world 
The theme of the June 198% issue 
was “1789: An idea that changed the 
world”. Today, however, two 
hundred years later, it is evident that 
we are in urgent need of fresh ap- 
proaches If we wish to assure the sur- 
vival of life on this planet. 
The environmental problem and 
the regional conflicts are examples of 
the awesome challenges facing hu- 
manity. It is odd that the authors who 
occasionally raise these issues all stop 
short of the one logical conclusion, 
namely that mankind has only one 
realistic alternative to universal dis- 
aster and that is a World Federation. 
The idea is by no means new. Just 
over forty years ago, Albert Einstein 
thought that it would come about In 
any event... 
It is surely time for us to make a 
firm effort to shake ourselves out of 
our indifference—before our collec- 
tive Titanic takes us into an era of 
prolonged darkness or sinks outright 
into eternal oblivion. 
Zeev Raphael 
Haifa (Israel) 
Berlioz and the Aeneid 
| was sorry that Jean-Paul Brisson, in 
his article “Aeneas, Rome's man of 
destiny’ (September 1989), did not 
mention the only important modern 
work | know of which is based on the 
Aeneid, namely Hector Berlioz’ opera 
Les Troyens. Berlioz read and studied 
the Latin text of the Aeneid from an 
early age, and took it as the subject 
of an opera which was the culmina- 
tion of his mature work as a musician. 
Berlioz is still too little known, even 
in his native France! Would it be pos- 
sible for the Unesco Courier to pay 
tribute to him in a forthcoming issue? 
Jean-Michel Cuzin 
Sceaux (France) 
A wish come true 
In the year since I've been a sub- 
scriber to the Courier, | don't think 
you have devoted an issue to eco- 
nomics. | should be really interested 
to read an economics number be- 
cause of the courses I'm taking at 
school.
