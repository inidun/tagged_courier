The first stirrings

Prehistoric rock art is by far the largest 
“7 body of evidence we have of human- 
ity’s artistic, cognitive and cultural beginnings. 
It is found in most countries of the world, 
from the tropics to the Arctic regions, in sites 
ranging from deep caves to high mountains. 
Many tens of millions of rock art figures or 
motifs have been found, and more are being 
discovered each year. This massive, semi-per- 
manent and cumulative record is the most 
direct evidence we have of how pre-humans 
first became human and then evolved complex 
social systems. 
Some widely held misconceptions about 
the origins of art must be dispelled at the out- 
set. Art as such did not appear suddenly, but 
developed gradually with the cognitive evo-

lution of humans. By the time that the famous 
cave art of France and Spain was being pro- 
duced, art traditions are thought to have been 
well established at least in southern Africa, 
the Levant, eastern Europe, India and Aus- 
tralia, and no doubt in many other regions 
that have yet to be examined adequately. 
When were humans first able to produce 
abstractions of reality? In addition to its inter- 
est for the art historian and the archaeologist, 
this question is of wider concern, if only 
because ideas of cultural precedence have been 
effective in shaping racial, ethnic and national 
value judgments and even fantasies. The notion 
that art began in the caves of western Europe 
furthers myths of European cultural prece- 
dence, for example. Secondly, the origins of art

are thought to be intimately intertwined with 
the emergence of several other distinctively 
human faculties: the ability to form abstract 
concepts, to symbolize, to communicate at an 
advanced level, to develop a notion of the self. 
Apart from prehistoric art we have no tangible 
evidence from which to infer these capacities. 
The beginnings of art 
Art production was preceded by “non-utili- 
tarian” behaviour patterns, i.e. behaviour that 
seems to lack practical purpose. The earliest 
discernible archaeological evidence for this is 
the use of ochre or haematite, a red mineral 
pigment collected and used by people several 
hundred thousand years ago. These early 
humans also collected crystals and petrified

fossils, and colourful or oddly shaped pebbles. 
They had begun to distinguish between ordi- 
nary, everyday objects and the unusual, the 
exotic. Presumably they had developed con- 
cepts of a world in which objects could be cat- 
egorized into different classes. Evidence of 
this appears first in southern Africa, then in 
Asia and finally in Europe. 
The oldest known rock art was produced 
in India two or three hundred thousand years 
ago. It consists of cup marks and a meander- 
ing line hammered into the rock of a sand- 
stone cave. At about the same time, simple 
line markings were made on a variety of 
portable objects (bone, teeth, ivory and stone) 
which have been found at the camp sites of 
early humans. Sets of bunched engraved lines »

first appear in central and castern Europe; they 
developed into distinctive arrangements that 
can be recognized as motifs such as zigzags, 
crosses, arcs and scts of parallel lines. 
This phase, which archaeologists call the 
Middle Palaeolithic (perhaps 35,000 to 150,000 
years ago), is crucial in human intellectual and 
cognitive development. This was also the time 
when people developed seafaring capacity, and 
crossings of up to 180 km were eventually 
made by colonizing parties. Regular ocean nav- 
igation clearly required an advanced system of 
communication, presumably language. 
People of this period also mined ochre and 
flint in several world regions. They began 
building large communal dwellings of mam- 
moth bones in southern Russia, and crected 
stone walls in caves. But most importantly, 
they produced art. In Australia, some speci- 
mens of rock art may be up to 60,000 years 
old, as old as human occupation of the conti- 
nent itself, and hundreds of sites contain 
examples which are thought to predate the 
cave art of western Europe. But during this

phase rock art also appears in Europe, the old- 
est known example being an arrangement of 
cighteen cup marks ina French cave, onarock 
slab placed over a child’s burial spot. 
Perhaps the most interesting aspect of this 
period is the cultural uniformity that prevailed 
throughout the then-settled world. Despite 
differences in tools, doubtless due to responses 
to environmental differences, cultural behaviour 
was surprisingly consistent. The use of ochre 
and the fairly uniform repertoire of geometric 
markings are indications of a universal artistic 
language among archaic Homo sapiens, includ- 
ing the Neanderthal people of Europe and oth- 
ers about whom we know from fossil remains. 
Figurative depiction in the round (sculp- 
ture) first appears in Israel (c. 250-300,000 years 
ago), as modified natural form, then in Siberia 
and central Europe (c. 30-35,000 years ago), and 
later in western Europe. By 30,000 or so years 
ago, rock art included complex finger mark- 
ings on soft cave surfaces in Australia and in 
Europe, and hand stencils in France. Finally, 
two-dimensional pictures of objects began to

appear; the oldest examples, about 32,000 years 
old, are from France, followed by paintings 
from Namibia in southern Africa. 
By about 20,000 years ago, quite recent in 
terms of human history, cultures began to 
diverge noticeably. In western Europe, Upper 
Palaeolithic people developed sophisticated tra- 
ditions of both sculpted and graphic art for 
ritual or decorative use. By 15,000 years ago, 
this tradition produced glorious masterworks 
in such caves as Altamira (Spain) and Lascaux 
(France), and thousands of finely carved fig- 
ures made of stone, ivory, bone, clay or other 
materials. This is the time of the finest poly- 
chromatic cave art, painted or engraved with 
the confident strokes of master artists. Graphic 
art traditions elsewhere, however, developed

years ago). Object (c) is a

very differently. In Russia and across Asta, geo- 
metric art forms were elaborated into highly 
developed systems, some of which resemble 
formal records, while others may have been 
mnemontc devices, memory prompters 
designed to record texts. 
From about the end of the Ice Age, about 
10,000 years ago, rock paintings begin to appear 
outside caves. This almost certainly reflects the 
selective survival of rock art rather than a new 
preference in the choice of sites. Rock paint- 
ings can survive very well in the stable envi- 
ronments of deep limestone caves but not on 
rock surfaces that are more exposed to damage. 
The apparent proliferation of rock art around 
the end of the Ice Age therefore indicates, not 
anincreaseinart production but that a thresh- 
old of preservation has been crossed. 
On all continents except Antarctica, rock 
paintings now bear witness to a multitude of 
art styles and cultures, to the progressively 
increasing cthnic diversification of humanity 
on all continents, and to the development of the 
major religions. Even the recent historical devel- 
opments of mass migrations, colonization and 
religious expansion are all reflected in rock art. 
Dating 
There are two basic forms of rock art, petro- 
glyphs (or carvings) and pictographs (or paint- 
ings). The motifs of petroglyphs were created 
by engraving, hammering, incising or abrading

rock surfaces. In pictographs some material 
was added to the rock surface, usually paint. 
The distinction is important because it deter- 
mines approaches to dating. 
The methodology of dating rock art scien- 
tifically has only developed over the last fifteen 
years or so. [tis still therefore in its infancy, and 
nearly all the world’s rock art remains cffec- 
tively undated. This does not mean that we 
have no idea of its age, however, since there are 
often various indicators of approximate or at 
least probable age. It is sometimes possible to 
determine the age of rock paintings quite accu- 
rately, especially when the paint contains organic 
substances or microscopic inclusions that are 
datable through their radiocarbon content. 
Careful interpretation of such analytical results 
can make dating quite reliable.

Dating petroglyphs, on the other hand, 
remains very difficult. Most current methods 
seck to establish the age of a mineral skin that 
may have formed over the rock art and thus 
provide merely minimum ages. One technique 
is to analyse microscopic organic material 
encased in such mineral skins; laser technology 
can be used successfully for this purpose. But 
currently only one method is available to deter- 
mine the age of the petroglyph itself. [tis based 
on the fact that the mineral crystals that were 
fractured when the petroglyph was hammered 
into the rock initially had sharp edges, which 
became blunt and rounded with age. By deter- 
mining from nearby surfaces of known ages 
how fast this process operates, the age of a pet- 
roglyph surface can be estimated. 
Several archacological dating methods can 
also provide limited assistance. If, for instance, 
an archaeological, datable layer of soil covers 
petroglyphs on a rock wall, it can be assumed 
to provide a minimum age for the rock art. 
Stylistic comparison has often been used to 
construct chronological frameworks for rock 
art, but not very successfully. 
The most promising methods of studying 
rock art often resemble those of forensic sci- 
ence. For instance, paint components may tell 
us how the paint was mixed, what implements 
and additives were used, where the pigment 
came from, and so forth. Human blood, 
which was used as a binding agent in the Ice

Age, has been detected in ancient Australian 
rock paintings. Australian researchers have also 
found as many as forty very thin superim- 
posed layers of paint at many sites, indicating 
continuous repainting of the same rock sur- 
faces over long periods of time. Like the pages 
of a book, these layers record the history of 
the site’s use by artists of many generations. 
The study of such sequences is only just begin- 
ning and may result in entirely new insights. 
Paint brush fibres have been found in rock 
art paint, and so has pollen which can indi- 
cate vegetation contemporary with the time 
of painting. In some French caves, distinctive 
paint recipes have been identified from their 
chemical makeup. In the case of charcoal pig- 
ment in a black painting, even the genus of 
the tree from which the charcoal originated 
has been established. 
Rock art research has become a scientific 
discipline in its own right, and already draws 
on many other disciplines, from geology to 
semiotics, from ethnography to computer 
science. The methodology includes colour 
enhancement of electronic imagery derived

from very faded, barely visible pictures; vari- 
ous specialized recording techniques; and 
microscopic study of tool marks and minute 
residues. 
Fragile vestiges 
Methods of rock art conservation are also 
being developed and increasingly applied. Rock 
art panels and even entire sites are being repli- 
cated in order to protect the original from 
deterioration. Yet much of the world’s pre- 
historic art 1s now severely threatened. Acid 
rain dissolves the protective mineral coating 
that covers many petroglyphs. Increasing cul- 
tural tourism, encroaching urban, industrial 
and mining development, even misguided 
research all take their toll. 
Efforts are being made in some countries 
to protect and preserve this remarkable but 
fragile cultural resource. International agencies, 
especially UNESCO, can help by encouraging 
international uniformity of protective legisla- 
tion, streamlining research and applied science, 
and helping develop global approaches to rock 
art conservation and site management. ||

40,000 YEARS OF HOMO INTELLECTUALIS 
The writing 
on the wall 
BY EMMANUEL ANATI 
Prehistoric rock paintings and engravings 
may be a language with its own grammar 
and syntax 
~All over the world, in more than 120 
“0 countries, groups of human beings have 
left behind examples of rock paintings or carv- 
ings. Rock seems to have been the first support 
they chose on which to create their works of 
art; it is, at any rate, on rock that examples of 
their art have come down to us. Body-paint- 
ing and tattoos, ornaments, decorations, 
paintings on bark or on palm leaves, draw- 
ings in sand and collections of unusually 
shaped or coloured pebbles are other art forms 
that may have existed before rock art, but they 
have not withstood the passage of millennia, 
while music and the dance have left only indi- 
rect evidence of their existence in graphic rep- 
resentations or in the remains of musical 
instruments discovered in the course of archac- 
ological excavations. 
Rock art is typically the product of pre-lit- 
erate societies, beginning with the emergence of 
Homo sapiens and generally dying out when 
the communities that practised it acquired a 
“written” form of communication. It thus 
constitutes by far the most important record 
we possess of humanity’s history before the 
invention of writing. It also provides invalu- 
able source material for the study of human 
beings’ cognitive development, which is why 
it is so important to establish a world data 
bank, as the WARA (World Archives on Rock 
Art) project aims to do (see Fact file, page 39). 
Almost all prehistoric art focuses on three 
basic themes: sex, food and territory. Humans’ 
  
4. Rock engravings found at Tamgali 
(Kazakhstan). Two anthropomorphic 
wolves or foxes armed with hooks or 
having hook-shaped hands are moving in 
on a small creature with atall and a 
feather on its head. The scene appears 
to depict a dance relating to a myth. 
main concerns seem not to have changed very 
much down the ages... .. 
The art and its environment 
Before looking at the graphic, intellectual and 
ideological content of the works themselves, 
we need to clarify a number of essential points 
concerning the relationship between them and 
their environment. 
Space. The natural forms and the position 
selected on the rock face are the most obvious 
such relationship—so obvious, indeed, that 
it is often overlooked. In fact, the relation- 
ship between the thing depicted, the sign, and 
the positioning of the depiction is a concrete, 
physical one, and corresponds to a specific 
choice, whether conscious or unconscious. 
Comparative studies carried out world-wide 
have demonstrated that the artists chose the 
positions of their images in accordance with 
widely recurring criteria. 
The individual. The person making that 
choice obviously had a specific identity: he or 
she may have been young or old, a shaman or 
a lay person—art has never been practised by 
all and sundry. Another type of relationship 
is therefore to be sought in the linkage between 
the surviving work of art and the type of indi- 
vidual who created it. In some cases, in tribal 
art of a later date as well as in prehistoric art, 
it is possible to ascertain whether the work 
was executed by an initiate or a non-initiate, by , 
a man or by a woman. 
5. Rock engraving at Tiout (Algeria) produced by hunters some time during the 2nd millennium B.C. The way in 
which the vanous elements are combined shows a certain logic and an ability to synthesize and handle 
abstractions. Analysis of the “syntax” of the engraving highlights the parallel between hunting and sex. The 
ostrich hunter (centre) is using a bow and arrow and is accompanied by a dog. A line runs from the hunter's 
penis to the pubis of a female figure behind him whose gender is indicated by a pair of parallel lines on either side 
of her body. Similar lines, or “lips”, represent the female sex organ. 
Between these two figures is a goat with a tnangular symbol between its horns, and the same symbol recurs 
on the woman's head. This may be an ideograph providing a particular item of information; the animal figure 
associated with it could be a clue to the woman’s identity or name. The huntsman's identity is established by 
three vertical lines above his head. The figure of the ostrich, the huntsman’s prey, is accompanied by two dots, 
conferring the status of an object on it and meaning “something to be hunted”.

Time. The painting or engraving was made 
ata particular time of the day or night, in sum- 
mer or in winter, or even at a particular point in 
the artist’s personal life, The act of executing it 
occurred within a dynamic context, before, 
after or during other physical or mental activ- 
ittes—before or after the hunt, before or after 
cating or sleeping, before or after doing other 
things. It also took place under particular cir- 
cumstances, at a moment spent in solitude or 
in company, during a ceremony or the practice 
of meditation, in a noisy place or in total 
silence—like any other act, it fits into a temporal 
and sequential context. We are thus presented 
with yet another type of relationship, that 
between the work and its temporal context. In 
our efforts to recreate that context, we can often 
do no more than speculate, even when we are 
able to establish whether the painting in ques- 
tion had a public or private function. 
Types of sign 
There are several types of sign, and relation- 
ships exist both between similar signs and 
between different signs. I apply the term “syn- 
tax” to the mode of relationship (juxtaposi- 
tion, sequence, scene) and “grammar” to the 
specific form of each sign. 
Three grammatically distinct types of sign 
recur everywhere (drawing 1): 
Pictographs (or mythographs). These are 
recognizable representations of real or imagi- 
nary objects, antmals or human beings.

6. Rock engraving by early hunters of the Murray 
River region (southern Australia). It features a 
schematic outline of a quadruped accompanied by 
several ideographs. A sign representing the vulva 
occupies a central place. There are also several 
series of dots, lines, groups of lines and a dot-and- 
line ideograph that recurs several times. This 
combination of graphemes denotes a repetitive 
syntax characteristic of a certain type of cognition 
found world-wide. 
Ideographs. These are repetitive signs or 
combinations of signs, sometimes taking the 
form of discs, arrows, branches, sticks, signs 
in the shape of trees, crosses, mushrooms, 
stars or snakes, “lips”, zigzag patterns, “phal- 
luses” or “vulvas”. Their recurrent nature and 
the particular relationship between them indi- 
cate that they are intended to convey conven- 
tional concepts (drawings 2 to 5). 
Psychographs. These seem neither to repre- 
sent objects nor to be symbols. They appear to 
have been created as a result of violent dis- 
charges of energy, perhaps in order to express 
feelings about life or death and feelings of love 
or hate, but could also be interpreted as 
expressing portents or other very subtle per- 
ceptions. They occur more often in cave art 
and on moveable objects than in open-air rock 
art, in which the choice of rock and its actual 
shape seem to fulfil the psychograph’s role. 
The syntax specific to the art of the early 
hunters combines pictographs representing 
various common types of animal, such as ele- 
phant and giraffe in the case of the United 
Republic of Tanzania or bison and horse in 
western Europe, with, in both these cases, 


### 111394: The Writing on the wall: 40,000 years of homo intellectualis

idecographs which are in many cases identical. 
Various studies are at present being carried out 
on the significance of these combinations of 
pictographs and ideographs, but the general 
opinion seems to be that they are based upon 
the same logic as that which underlies the first 
pictographic writing systems, and indeed may

At many rock art sites and in the earliest 
forms of writing, ideographs are signs con- 
veying ideas, ina process of transmission from 
writer to reader and from the painter to the real 
or imaginary beings to whom the message is 
addressed. 
Research reveals a number of constants in 
rock art, on whatever continent it may have 
been produced, such as the use of similar tech- 
niques and colours, a narrow and repetitive 
range of subjects, the same ways of combining 
different elements, the same type of logic, the 
recurrence of a range of symbolic ideographs 
and, especially, the combination of pic- 
tographs, idcographs and psychographs 
(drawings 10 to 13). This raises further ques- 
tions and suggests that the same structural 
basis and the same conceptual dynamics may 
underlie all creative art.

of art, each with its own characteristics that 
may be found everywhere. 
Early hunters: art practised by hunters who 
were ignorant of the bow and arrow, com- 
bining signs and figures but without com- 
posing scenes as such. Its syntax consists chiefly 
of logical sequences and metaphorical associa- 
tions. 
Early gatherers: art practised by peoples 
whose economy was based mainly on the gath- 
ering of wild fruit, taking the form of simple 
scenes of a metaphorical nature depicting a 
surreal world. Much of this art scems to have 
been produced in a state of hallucination. 
Later hunters: art practised by hunters who 
knew how to usc the bow and arrow, con- 
sisting of anecdotal and descriptive scenes and 
mainly depicting the hunt and events in the 
community. 
Pastoralists and herdsmen: art practised by 
peoples whose main economic activity as 
depicted therein was raising livestock, and 
focussing on the depiction of domestic ani- 
mals and scenes of family life. 
The complex economy: art practised by 
peoples with a diversified economy, includ- 
ing farming, and consisting mainly of mytho- 
logical scenes and compositions made up of 
signs and patterns. 
This classification is necessarily only a 
rough outline; there are transitional phases 
and groups that display a mixture of charac- 
teristics, and there can also be marked differ- 
ences within a given category. In the present 
state of research, however, and given the con- 
siderable amount of evidence available to us, an 
approach based on style and subject-matter is 
clearly the one to be followed in order to tran- 
scend the limitations of regional frontiers. 
Applyinga set of criteria based on the sub- 
jects and on the typology of representations, it 
has been possible to pinpoint certain recurrent 
and significant elements, and also to put for- eye (left). Two vulva ideographs and several cup marks . ) i

achieved, this represented not so much evolu- 
tion as a revolution. Various attempts have 
been made to prove thatapes and Homo erec- 
tus were capable of producing art, supposi- 
tions that are, to my mind, totally unfounded. 
The emergence of our identity as Homo sapi- 
ens presupposes the acquisition of a whole set 
of specialized functions and particular attrib- 
utes, of being able to see, hear and feel with a 
lucidity and in a manner quite specific to the 
genus sapiens (drawings 12 to 17). 
Some things about rock art from the distant 
past are still relevant today. The visual language 
of early hunters is a universal language since, 
quite apart from systems of representation and 
styles that are often very similar in different 
parts of the world, it also displays combina- 
tions of figures and symbols that derive from 
the same logic, suggesting a similar way of* 
thinking and of self-expression (drawing 18). It 
is not unreasonable to assume that the spoken 
language was also based on universal principles 
(drawings 19 to 22). 
In intellectual terms, it would seem that 
the capacity of Homo sapiens to produce art is 
innate. It would perhaps be better to replace 
the somewhat pretentious term Homo sapi- 
ens (sometimes even cited as Homo sapiens 
sapiens) by that of Homo intellectualis. MW

### 111395: The Prehistoric imagination

  
The prehistoric imagination 
BY DENIS VIALOU 
Prehistoric art combines unity of subject and 
technique with an astonishing symbolic diversity 
in different cultures and periods 
Top, the black bull, a rock 
painting in the Lascaux cave, 
Dordogne (France). 
Prehistoric art was an art closely bound 
“up with the lives of the hunters and 
herdsmen who created it, an art of nature and, 
first and foremost, an art of the open air. Scat- 
tered all over the world are millions of rock- 
art sites bearing witness to the creative activi- 
ties of human beings over a period stretching 
back at least ten millennia into prehistory. The 
art in question consists of engravings and, to 
alesser extent (probably because they have not 
been so well conserved), drawings and paint- 
ings, on surfaces that vary from region to 
region in accordance with their geological char- 
acteristics—single boulders or blockfields 
(boulder-covered areas), flat rocks and laterite 
surfaces, protruding parts of mountainsides or 
the walls of rock shelters. In comparison with 
this abundance of rock art in open-air sites, 
there are relatively few examples in caves. 
By contrast, the art of Palaeolithic Europe 
and especially that of the Magdalenian period 
(17,000-10,000 years ago) is mainly to be 
found underground. About 250 caves deco- 
rated with paintings or engravings have so far 
been discovered, mainly in France and Spain, 
as against ten or so open-air sites, either 
engraved rocks or shelters decorated with carv- 
ings. Unlike the art, open to light and life, 
created by societies on the move, the parietal 
(1.e.wall) art of the caves is hidden away in the 
dark depths of the earth. 
The symbolic conquest 
of the dark 
Signs of prehistoric human habitation dis- 
covered in cave mouths in the nineteenth cen-

long in dark caves, and indeed it would be 
impossible for humans to live there for long. 
This only serves to emphasize the symbolic 
significance of the parietal art which was 
invented by Palaeolithic painters and engravers 
and of which they became masters. These 
artists must have enjoyed a high status in soci- 
ety by virtue of their skills and of the fact 
that they gave expression to the lore and beliefs 
of the communities to which they belonged. 
The artists of the Gravettian culture (25,000- 
20,000 years ago), named after the La Gravette 
site in south-western France, were the first to 
dare set foot in caves, some ten of which have 
so far been reconnoitred, but they never ven- 
tured too far in and away from daylight. The 
Pair-non-Pair cave (in Frances Gironde départe- 
ment) with its dozens of engravings and the 
Gargas cave (Haute-Garonne, France), which 
contains both engravings and paintings (out- 
lines of hands), are splendid examples of the 
work of these pioneers. The artists of the 
Solutrean period (21,000-18,000 years ago), 
named after the La Solutré site, also in France, 
were scarcely more adventurous: fewer than 
twenty caves decorated by them have been 
found in France and Spain, but on the other 
hand they were remarkably skilful at creating 
low-relief carvings at sites in the open air.

caves, some of them vast (those at Rouffignacin 
France’s Dordogne region, for instance, stretch 
for several kilometres), show that the Magdale- 
nians had acquired and perfected the skills 
required for working underground: they used 
bowls hollowed out of stone, usually lime- 
stone, filled with animal fat and with wicks 
made of vegetable material, as lamps that, as 
recent experiments have shown, could burn for 
several hours. 
Cave art and cave architecture 
With one or more entrances, chambers, gal- 
leries and one or more accessible extremities, 
caves are an ordered and restricted space in 
which to work, unlike open-air shelters, which 
provide a more or less vertical, two-dimen- 
sional surface like a screen blocking out the 
horizon, and even less like an open area of 
more or less horizontal rock. 
The placing of the rock paintings in rela- 
tion to the topographical features of the cave 
is integral to their symbolism. In the Niaux 
cave (Ariege, France), for example, certain types 
of red-painted signs, some being patterns of 
dots and others “claviform” or club-shaped, 
appear in combination and are spaced out along 
the corridor that leads into and runs through 
the cave. Other types of geometrical or abstract 
drawings, angular signs for example, occur 
almost exclusively in a large apsidal hall known

as the Salon noir, where they are to be found 
in combination with drawings of bison and 
other animals, also drawn in black. 
In a Palaeolithic cave, the thematic structure 
of the wall paintings (i.e. the types of signs and 
species of animals) and their symbolic struc- 
ture (the spatial relationship between themes) 
is thus conditioned by the natural architecture 
of the site, the spaces and volumes of which 
proceed in sequence from the mouth to the 
rear of the cave and back again towards the 
mouth and thus towards normal life outside. 
The walls enfold the visitor and create an 
infinite variety of volumes, some easier of 
access or passage than others, some as vast and 
impressive as cathedrals and others no better 
than oppressively narrow crawl spaces. These 
natural properties of the site are also incor- 
porated into the layout of the wall paintings 
and contribute to their symbolic significance. 
A visitor standing in the middle of the 
Rotunda of the Lascaux cave in the Dordogne 
is struck by the frieze of huge bulls running 
round the chamber on the background of a 
band of spotless white rock that stands out 
between the blackish base of the walls and the 
deeply furrowed, lumpy ceiling. 
Open-air sites obviously do not have the 
infinite variety of shapes and volumes that 
caves and their walls, ceilings and floors pos- 
sess. A rock painting or engraving in a shelter 
can usually be taken in at a glance or from a sin- 
gle vantage point. In a cave, on the other hand, 
the viewer has to walk through the symbolic 
space created by the representations in order to 
see and “read” them in their entirety; whether 
juxtaposed in groups or isolated and dispersed, 
they only come to life as the viewer, and 
accordingly the light source, moves along. 
Immobilized in the darkness and scattered 
about on the surface of the complex and infi- 
nitely varied naturally occurring forms, they 
need time in order to be viewed in succession 
and then perceived in combination as parts of 
a single whole—the cave itself.

Subjected to these double limitations of 
space and time and to the flickering illumina-

normal life, belonging entirely and definitively 
to the realm of the imagination. 
Apart from this physically and symboli- 
cally isolated parietal art, Palaeolithic art exists in 
the form of many artefacts: paintings and 
engravings done on flat pieces of stone or bone 
or on the handles of weapons and tools, count- 
less personal ornaments such as beads, pendants 
and bracelets, and statuettes carved in stone,

which have been found in many of the occupa- 
tion sites in Europe that were inhabited in Palae- 
olithic times, from the carly Aurignacian period 
around 35,000 years ago to the concurrent end 
of the Ice Ages and of the Magdalenian civiliza- 
tion, representa vast iconography of symbols, 
fully integrated into everyday life. Easily trans- 
portable, they contributed to the development 
of exchanges and contacts, and to the propaga- 
tion of ideas and myths. 
Artistic unity... 
The famous Gravettian “Venuses”—some hun- 
dred or so statuettes—found at occupation 
sites in south-western France, at Brassempouy 
(Landes) and Lespugue (Haute-Garonne) for 
« example, and as far away as the plains of Rus- 
sia, at Kostienki or Avdeyevo, attest to a certain 
degree of unity of conception and styles that 
were the same or similar from end to end of 
Europe for four to five millennia. 
In all forms of rock art, in Brazil or Aus- 
tralia, central India, the south-western United 
States, the Middle East, southern Africa or 
the Sahara, the paintings or engravings com- 
bine three major categories of graphic repre- 
sentation: geometrical figures or abstract signs 
(1.e. signs with no explicit figurative reference), 
animals, and human figures.

men’s Cape ecland (Taurotragus oryx), the 
Palaeoindians’ armadillo, or the giraffes and 
ostriches of the Neolithic artists of the Sahara. 
Conversely, the representations of the human 
figureare treated with a freedom that is some- 
times pushed to such extremes as to make 
them almost indecipherable, as in the case of 
the painted stick figures in certain rock shelters 
in Brazil, which have little additions at either 
end that could be the head and the limbs. Pro- 
files and silhouettes are often given zoomor- 
phic features in many cultures, and it is just as 
common, in rock art of all periods, for the 
human figure (as regards the head, hands and 
sexual organs, and more rarely the feet) to be 
segmented. 
Within the limitless range of painted and 
engraved signs to be found everywhere in the 
world (dots, circles, rectangles, ctc.), there are 
innumerable points of convergence, which is 
not to say that the dots painted by a Palae- 
olithic artist necessarily carried the same mean- 
ing as those done by Palaeoindians.

variations being of relatively minor impor- 
tance. Drawings and paintings were done using 
mineral pigments, mainly ochres and man- 
ganese oxides, or charcoal. Incised engravings 
and pecked outlines were always made with 
hammer or blade tools fashioned from stone 
harder than that of the surface being worked, 
which was usually sandstone or limestone. 
This identity of subjects and techniques 
in prehistoric art, which reflects the relative 
uniformity of entirely nature-oriented pre- 
historic ways of life and economies, should 
not, however, disguise the fact of its remark- 
able diversity of symbolism. 
... and diversity of symbolism 
The choice of subjects and their arrangement 
in space in fact create a specific symbolism that 
varies from one culture and one era to another. 
Neighbouring Magdalenian caves in France 
(Font-de-Gaume, Combarelles, Bernifal and 
Rouffignac, all in the Dordogne), for instance, 
feature a common “tectiform” or roof-shaped 
design not found in other Magdalenian caves, 
although their animal subject-matter is very 
different. Comparative analysis of rock shel- 
ters in the Tassili-N’Ajjer, in the Algerian 
Sahara, and in the Drakensberg mountains of 
South Africa reveals analogous differences, 
and this phenomenon is repeated from site to

site, even when there are hundreds of shelters 
on the same site, as at Bhimbetka in central 
India. 
Within this widespread semantic diversity, 
it 1s possible to distinguish two main trends, 
onc towards pure symbolism and the other 
narrative in character or tending towards a cer- 
tain degree of realism. Generally speaking, 
Palacolithic parietal art (and artefacts) represent 
symbolic arrangements in which there is no 
discernible link between the juxtaposed and/or 
superimposed subjects, figurative or non-fig- 
urative. Horses, bison, mammoths, dots, rec- 
tangles, club shapes and human figures appear 
side by side, for no apparent reason other than 
the artists’ own coded languages. 
These main similarities and differences illus- 
trate both the unity and the diversity of the 
prehistoric arts practised by Homo sapiens sapi- 
ens in various parts of the world, thirty or 
forty millennia ago in the case of the oldest 
examples, reflecting the basic links that exist 
between cultures, economies and their forms of 
graphic expression. The ability to express, to 
symbolize, an imaginary universe through the 
use of highly diverse systems of symbolic con- 
ventions and norms reflects the unique cultural 
characteristics of human communities and the 
specificity of their languages and customs, their 
beliefs, their myths and their gods. |

### 111396: For Australian Aborigines, rock painting is a title to their land

‘For Australian Aborigines, 
rock painting is a title to their land’ 
Tim Fox talks to three Australian Aborigines invited to a Unesco Forum on rock art 
The Aborigines of Australia have always 
been hunter-gatherers, living in harmony 
with their surroundings. They believe that 
through ritual they help sustain the cycles of 
the natural world and that they are as much a 
part of nature as the wind, the rain and the soll. 
Understanding nature’s secrets is a lifetime 
process, completely revealed only to tribal or 
clan elders. 
Art for the Aborigines is the expression of 
present-day life, that is, a life that has been con- 
sidered in the present tense since the beginning 
of time. Theirs is both the oldest and the youngest 
continuous civilization in the world, the oldest 
as attested to by the dating process called ther- 
moluminescence; and the youngest because the 
practices depicted by rock paintings are still a 
part of Aboriginal culture to this very day. 
According to the Aborigines, what is etched 
in or painted onto stone is the expression of 
THE UNESCO Gourier WB APRIL 1998 
the world's immutable laws, which emerged 
from the Dream Time, the gelatinous, amor- 
phous time before the world emerged in the 
form we know today. These laws were placed 
there by ancestors and were until recently only 
for the eyes and understanding of a few initi- 
ates, the elders who have demonstrated their 
worthiness to know. 
In June 1997 three elders and a young dis- 
ciple of the Ngarinyin community left their 
native Kimberley Plateau in Australia’s remote 
northwest and travelled to Europe to exhibit 
photographs of their sacred rock drawings and 
explain what the drawings meant. By this act, 
which not so many years ago would have been 
punishable by death, they sought to protect 
their access to their sacred sites against pres- 
sure from cattle-grazing, mining companies, 
tourists and souvenir hunters. 
Without immediate contact with their lands, 
the Ngarinyin people cease to exist, for they 
are an integral part of the land, and the land is 
an integral part of them. If they do not actively 
maintain the land, the Aborigines believe it will 
cease to sustain life just as they wil cease to 
exist if they are removed from it. This is why - 
they had asked a painter/film-maker friend, 
Jeff Doring, to record on film some of their rock 
drawings so that the outside world could learn 
of their existence and understand the ways in 
which they bind Aborigines to their land. 
The role of delegation leader seemed to fall 
to David Mowaljarlai, who has perhaps had the 
most extensive contact with Westerners through 
his many encounters with ethnologists and 
anthropologists and the many conferences on 
Aborigines he has attended in Australia. Paddy 
Wamma is a walking encyclopaedia of the plants 
found on the Kimberley Plateau and their medi- 
cinal, practical and nutritional applications. Paddy

Neowarra is president of the Ngarinyin Aboriginal 
Corporation and People (N.A.C.) and a firm 
believer that traditional law must rule in all 
aspects of social life and predominate in decid- 
ing land rights. Even when asked direct ques- 
tions, the youngest of the four, Jason Ninowatt, 
deferred to the older men, who answered for 
him protectively. The group of four was accom- 
panied by Jeff Doring and anthropologist Tony 
Redmond, who often clarified or provided back- 
ground to points made by the Aborigines. 
BM Why this reversal of the age-old practice 
of keeping the meaning of the rock 
drawings a secret? 
David Mowaljarlai: Our paintings are our title 
to the land. If we lose our title, the paintings 
are empty. It's as simple as that. Besides we 
are not revealing al! the secrets. Not the most 
essential ones. We are grateful to UNESCO for 
inviting us to tell our story. We don’t normally 
travel so far from our land. We are under heavy 
pressure from pastoralists, mining companies 
and tour operators, who are trying to block us 
from our land. They are trying to extinguish our 
Native Title. 
BM What Is Native Title? 
Tony Redmond: [t's a concept initiated by Aus- 
tralia’s Northern Territory when it passed the 
Aboriginal Land Rights Act in 1976. The Act 
gave Aboriginal people inalienable freehold 
title to all Aberiginal reserves and a mecha- 
nism by which they could claim vacant Crown 
Land. Claimants have to be able to demonstrate 
traditional ownership of the land, and claims 
are heard by an Aboriginal Land Commissioner. 
— Ww pV eh Uf J P " 
Thecretically, Aboriginal landowners are able to 
limit incursion onto their land for mineral explo- 
ration or commercial development. But it is 
proving very hard to enforce. 
D.M.: And some pecple—mining companies, 
pastoralists and the like—are still trying to 
deny us our rights by saying we can’t prove that 
we are the traditional owners of the land. But 
we can. There are the rock drawings. 
HB What do the rock drawings prove? 
Jeff Doring: Rock art is a visual document. It is 
the “written” law in Aboriginal terms. The infor- 
mation in the drawings and the stone arrange- 
ment are totally explicit. White man's law 
changes from year to year, but these drawings 
never change. The illustration of one man pass- 
ing an object to another, for example, is never 
modified, and it has been there, as far as the 
Aborigines are concerned, forever. And for the 
Aborigines it has the force of law. 
HW Well what, for example, does the 
drawing of a man passing an object to 
another man mean? 
D.M.: Wunan, the act of sharing. 
P. W.: The wunan law works for everybody. 
Everything has always been shared by every- 
body. No one lives outside the chain. Every- 
one—you, me, everyone—is inside wunan. Ani- 
mals, things, birds, everything, are all part of 
the wunan law. 
It all started at the stone wunantable. It's 
the stone table that guides us. All our people 
Dating of various examples of rock art in 
Australia confirms that some of them are over 
20,000 years old. Below, a decorated cave at Keep 
River, near Kununura, Northern Territory. Right,

gathered here to set rules and make laws. All 
the clans came from the four corners of the 
region to establish the wunanlaw. They talked 
and agreed how the land should be shared out 
and where the sacred places should be. All the 
men of the wunan law formed a line. No one 
was left out. We divided up the land. No one 
was left out; no one forgotten. 
They made a big cake with the fruit of the 
gulangi. “We have to create a rule and establish 
a law,” they said. “itis our life, this tree before 
us.” They ate the cake piece by piece. There 
was enough for everyone. But the emu grew 
impatient for his share. He waited on the crest 
of the hill until he felt he'd waited long enough. 
Then he came down to get a piece. “No,” they 
said, “you come from the rising sun. You've got 
a long time to wait yet for your share.” So he 
shouted and stole the cake. They tried to talk 
him out of taking the cake, but he would not be 
swayed and ran away. 
The emu ran faster than any other animal. 
The ground shook as he ran. All the birds tried 
to catch him, but he was too fast. So they went 
to the wowara, pigeons with bronze-coloured 
wings. “You are fast runners,” they said. “You 
are the only ones who can catch the emu.” Just 
then the wowara were honing the tips of their 
spears. They agreed and set out after the emu. 
They followed his tracks and finally caught up 
with him. He was punished because he had 
transgressed the law, as are all those today 
who follow in his footsteps. If you look up at 
the Milky Way you can see him looking back 
over his shoulder at the spear sticking in his 
back which he can never pull out because his 
arm is too short. | |

### 111397: The Shaman's journey

The shaman’s journey 
BY JEAN CLOTTES 
Shamanism may provide a clue to the meaning of rock art 
With very few exceptions (in some parts 
of Australia, for example) rock art all 
over the world is a fossil art. Its creators dis- 
appeared long ago, and with them went the 
myths and beliefs depicted in their rock paint- 
ings and engravings. Research can thus only 
be based on the art of the last two or three 
centuries when various peoples in the Amer- 
icas, Africa and Australia still regularly painted 
on the walls of rock shelters. This approach is 
not without dangers, however. Neither the 
reported evidence nor its interpretation is 
always reliable. Furthermore, there is no guar- 
antee that a group of nineteenth-century Abo- 
rigines living in a particular area shared the

same beliefs as their ancestors who produced 
rock art in the same region several thousand 
years earlier. Comparative cthnology—extrap- 
olating practices noted in one place and context 
to other world regions—should be practised 
with extreme caution, in a very general way, 
taking into consideration some universal fea- 
tures of human thinking and without hoping 
to come up with complete, detailed explana- 
tions that can be applied everywhere. 
The term shamanism, first used to describe 
Siberian populations, has come to include 
beliefs and practices with a common basis 
found, even today, among many peoples in the 
world. Some of the many characteristics of Ga , 
shamanistic systems are fundamental and wide- 
spread.! Here we shall examine three of them. 
Other worlds 
The first is a belief in a layered universe with 
several superposed or parallel worlds. Accord- 
ing to this belief, the events in our world, the 
world we live in, are directly conditioned by 
the influence of powers living in one or 
another of the other worlds. The second fea- 
ture is the belief that certain individuals can in 
certain circumstances directly make contact 
with the(se) other world(s) and in this way 
influence events in our world. They usually 
do this for practical reasons—to heal the sick 
or restore alost harmony, to create good con- 
ditions for hunting, to bring rain to dry areas, 
or, more rarely, for evil purposes. The third 
characteristic is that contact with the other 
world is made directly, in one direction or 
another, through a visit by auxiliary spirits, 
often in animal form, which come to the 
shaman or towards which he goes. This will

often be an occasion for identification between 
the shaman and the spirit, or a belief in a total 
or partial transformation of the man into an 
animal. If the shaman’s auxiliary spiritis a griz- 
zly bear, identification between the human 
and the grizzly is total. A shaman can also send 
his soul into the other world to meet spirits 
and obtain their protection and help by going 
into a trance, sometimes during collective cer- 
emonies, sometimes alone. 
Ethnologists consider that shamanism is 
often found in egalitarian societies, usually of 
hunter-gatherers, although hunter-gatherer 
societies are not all shamanistic. Nor are these 
the only societies where shamanistic practices 
arc found. 
The fact that shamanism is found the world 
over is not of course due to direct or indirect 
contact between distant populations. The ulti- 
mate reason may be, atleast partially, rooted in 
the inevitable need to rationalize and use the

altered states of consciousness that are part of the 
human nervous system and appear in one form 
or another in every society. Certain people have 
been subject to hallucinations and visions, every- 
where and at all times, for reasons as varied as the 
phenomena themselves. These experiences may be 
due to drugs or to certain pathological states, 
fasting, isolation, darkness, suffering, intense 
concentration, or throbbing, recurrent sounds. 
Rationalist cultures like ours disapprove of these 
phenomena and consider that psychiatrists (for 
spontaneous hallucinations) or the police (for 
hallucinogenic drugs) should deal with them. 
In others visionaries are regarded as being in con- 
tact with otherworldly powers and therefore 
become spiritual leaders, prophets or shamans. 
This does not mean that they will neces- 
sarily record their visions on rocks. But in 
some cases they have done so, and what is

researchers in recent decades reveals many sim-

When we enter this other world, whether itis 
below or parallel to our own, we do so through 
a tunnel protected by animal guardians. In Cal- 
ifornia, these were bears or rattlesnakes. 
The images themselves were charged with 
power—they were painted onc over the other 
on the same walls and cach new work drew 
from and added to the accumulated power of 
those beneath. Certain dominant themes recur, 
differing from region to region. In the Drak- 
ensberg Mountains, South Africa, elands pre- 
dominate. In the Coso mountains of central 
California, big-horned sheep are the animals 
most commonly depicted since they were asso- 
ciated with rain and rain was vital in this desert 
area. These distinctive local features illustrate 
the choices and beliefs of the creators and users 
of this art. Part-human part-animal figures 
also appear. These are creatures seen during the 
shamanistic journey or as a result of the 
shaman’s transformation. 
The purpose of rock art was often to depict 
visions after they had been experienced. David 
Whitley, who has studied rock art in the 
southwest of the United States,? considers 


### 111397: The Shaman's journey

that if the Nevada and California visionaries 
had not drawn their visions, they would have 
“lost” them and died as a result. On other 
occasions, the shaman’s supernatural journey 
was depicted metaphorically. Death, for exam- 
ple, was a metaphor for a trance. In California’

Coso mountains, “killing a big-horned 
sheep”, the rain animal, meant that the shaman 
was going to the other world to bring back 
rain. The metaphor of death for a trance and 
for sexual relations (“little death”) was com- 
mon. Other metaphors were less common and 
remind us of the impossibility of grasping 
the specific meaning and nuances of art with- 
out direct help. 
Rock art could also depict something other 
than the visions of a trance and still be linked 
to a shamanistic vision of the world. David 
Whitely reports, for example, that until the 
end of the last century female puberty rites 
included several days of isolation, instruction 
in maternity taboos, fasting and various cer- 
emonies, and eating native tobacco to provoke 
hallucinations during which the girls met an 
animal spirit, usually a rattlesnake. Afterwards, 
they ran to a painted shelter called the Shaman’s 
House, and drew their hands on its walls, pos- 
itively or negatively, with red paint (a colour 
associated with young girls) to show that they 
had “touched” the supernatural. 
Bridging two worlds 
David Lewis-Wllliams, a South African 
rescarcher who has spent years studying the 
paintings and beliefs of the San Bushmen of 
his country, is behind much current research 
on shamanism and rock art. Before him, sev- 
cral authors had explored this field but with- 
out great success, perhaps due to a lack of a »

sufficiently rigorous approach. Following his 
work, undeniable links with shamanism have 
been established between rock art images pro- 
duced by cultures in different parts of the 
world, especially throughout southern Africa 
and in North and South America.* It is even 
likely that much European palaeolithicart, or 
“cave art” originates in shamanistic practices. 
This hypothesis, which is not a complete 
or exclusive explanation but an explanatory 
framework, 1s based on several observations. 
For more than 20,000 years, deep caves were

therefore was certainly not a simple matter of 
exploration. Palaeolithic people knew that they 
were in the realm of spirits, and expected to 
meet spirits in these caves. The flickering light 
of their torches brought the walls to life and 
they saw animal shapes on them. We know 
this because they very often used the more or 
less suggestive natural relief of the walls, which 
acted as a kind of permeable veil between this 
world and the other-world. Many figures were 
also painted or engraved where there were fis- 
sures, gaps or openings in the walls, as if ani- 
mals entered or left the cave at these points. 
In addition, many speleologists describe the 
hallucinatory cffect of caves, where cold, 
humidity, darkness and the absence of all sen- 
sory references encourage visions. Caves could 
therefore play a dual role: help produce altered 
states of consciousness, i.e. visions, and com- 
municate with spirits through the cave wall.? 
It thus seems extremely likely that much 
palacolithic art was created in a shamanistic 
framework.® This does not mean, of course,

that all the images of this art are the result of 
visions or that they all serve the same purpose. 
Human imagination and creativity are limitless 
and traditional thinking is never simple. The 
same holds true for the world’s open-air art. 
Some of it, in America, Africa, and perhaps clse- 
where, certainly originates in shamanistic prac- 
tices. We cannot, however, impose this model on 
all prehistoric rock art irrespective of its ethno- 
logical context. It would only be justified to do 
so after making a thorough, critical analysis of 
all the elements of the rock art concerned. HM

Dragon Canyon, Utah (United 
States), was “enhanced” with 
chalk by tourists so that they

tutes a vital feature of the history of humanity. 
Fragile and thus exceptionally precious, its sur- 
vival bears witness to the ancient human urge to 
leave footsteps in the sands of time. That urge, 
which we still feel, is now linked with a duty, 
the duty of ensuring that such art is passed on 
to future generations. If this duty of conser- 
vation is to be effectively performed, there 
must be a code of ethics applicable to research,

What can be done to stop the 
deterioration of rock art? 
and on the collective level of institutions, and 
a new approach to heritage education. 
Attitudes to rock art were for many years 
dominated by leading scientists schooled in 
the great traditions of history and classical 
archaeology, and attention was accordingly 
focused more upon questions of interpreta- 
tion than on the problems of conservation. 
Scholars such as these thought the most 
important thing was to locate, record and 
make explanatory comments on the works in 
question, and were less concerned about their 
actual survival. This is no longer the case. 
Everywhere in the world, rock art is suffering 
increasing deterioration. As we now know, 
anything done to a rock surface upsets the 
delicate dynamic balance between the rock and 
the atmosphere, which in normal circum- 
stances is regulated over time by environmen- 
tal factors. The micro-organisms present in 
and on the rock can then proliferate and either 
damage the surface by producing mineral sub- 
stances (biomineralization) or destroy it. 
Open-air archives 
Exposed to the air, any rock surface behaves as 
a device for recording environmental varia- 
tions. With current laboratory techniques, it 
is possible to study the natural evolution of 
the climate and even to date the main stages 
of that evolution, but a thoughtless action, 
whether by a researcher or by a tourist, can 
destroy irreplaceable sources of information. 
Although it is sometimes essential to take 
microsamples, an ethical approach demands, 
both of the researcher and of any decent citi- 
zen, that they show proper respect for the 
work itself and for the natural setting of which 
it forms part. 
As more and more of rock art’s rich sources 
of information are discovered and recorded, a 
better understanding of the complex causes of 
damage or even destruction is emerging. In 
response to the increasingly rapid urbanization 
and industrialization that are profoundly mod- 
ifying many natural landscapes, urgent on-site 
rescue and recording operations are being carried 
out, but the impact of the methods employed 
is not always properly assessed. The fact is that 
operations such as the wetting of prehistoric 
paintings at sites in an arid environment, the »

highlighting of engravings with chalk or even 
paint, the application of whitewash and the 
taking of casts with the aid of chemicals all 
bring about physical, chemical and microbio- 
logical changes in the paintings themselves and 
_in the rock on which they have been cxccuted. 
Pleading recently in favour of conservation, 
the Australian specialist Robert G. Bednarik 
even urged that books on rock art which 
demonstrated direct-contact methods of record- 
ing should be withheld from publication. 
It was with such ideas of conservation in 
mind that the first International Seminar on 
the Conservation of Paintings in the Open 
Air—held in Algiers and at the Tassili N’ Ajjer, 
one of the prime World Heritage sites—was 
convened by UNESCO in 1978. Many such 
meetings have since been held, on all five con- 
tinents. 
The pros and cons of ecotourism 
Rock art is part of the common heritage and 
should not be the jealously guarded preserve 
of a few specialists, but public interest in and 
admiration for it raises major problems. This 
is true both of the wealthy countries, where 
increased leisure time and cultural tourism 
help to step up the pressure on the environ- 
ment, and of the poor countries, where the 
development of ecotourism has to serve eco- 
nomic purposes such as bringing in foreign 
currency and providing employment, and 
where natural sites are treated as consumer 
products. 
The Manila Declaration on World Tourism 
indicates that modern tourism corresponds to 
abasic human right to rest and holidays, but it 
also points out that “in the practice of tourism,

spiritual elements must take precedence over 
technical and material elements”, those spiri- 
tual elements being “the total fulfilment of the 
human being, a constantly increasing contri- 
bution to education, equality of destiny of 
nations, the liberation of man in a spirit of 
respect for his identity and dignity, [and] thé 
affirmation of the originality of cultures and 
respect for the moral heritage of peoples.” 
One may well wonder whether the princi- 
ples enshrined in that Declaration are not being 
violated by the upsurge in organized tourism 
over the last twenty years, and whether the 
tour operators who offer visits to open-air 
rock-art sites anywhere in the world under 
the label of ecotourism and “green” or cul- 
tural tourism are not quite simply hijacking 
nature by putting a monetary value on it. 
To take the case of national parks, the World 
Conservation Union (IUCN) defined them in 
1969 as areas of land and/or sea especially ded- 
icated to the protection and maintenance of 
biological diversity, and of natural and associ- 
ated cultural resources, and managed through 
legal and other effective means. At present, only 
9 per cent of the dry land surface of the globe 
enjoys this status. In such places, priority 
should be given to the protection and conser- 
vation of the natural and cultural heritage, but, 
in response to understandable public curios- 
ity but also for less honourable reasons wherein 
rivalry and conflicts of authority and interests 
are intermingled, natural parks and reserves are 
being visited by more and more people every 
year. Such mass tourism at the world’s main 
heritage sites is causing their inexorable physi- 
cal deterioration and a diminution of their 
essential spiritual dimension.

These are difficult contradictions to resolve. 
While 1t 1s somewhat hypocritical to try and 
protect sites by keeping strict control over 
visitors’ right to roam (so much more is some- 
times declared out of bounds than is accessi- 
ble that a good video cassette might seem a 
better bet than an actual visit), what is one to 
make of the suspect notion of an “integral 
reserve”, which, by trying to create little 
islands of unspoilt nature, ends up establish- 
ing de jure two categories of nature, one where 
anything goes and another wherceverything is 
banned? 
Freedom and responsibility 
The present tendency to confuse culture with 
consumption in “leisure” activities poses a 
growing threat to the heritage. Anything that 
is consumed is, by definition, destroyed or 
at the very least loses much of its value; and 
“consumption” of the heritage in general and 
of rock art in particular is on the increase. As 
a result of too much machine-made poliu- 
tion, the general public and some of the polit- 
ical decision-makers have developed a need for 
nature and a concern for the environment. 
Many states have adopted a responsible atti- 
tude to their heritage, but much needs to be 
done to rally individuals and the public at 
large to this cause and to raise their awareness. 
This is why education is so important. 
From a very carly age, children must learn

Some of the petroglyphs at the

ical code which they, as future citizens and 
members of the public and as potential inter- 
ested amateurs or specialists, will adopt 
towards the natural and cultural heritage, so

BY AXEL AND ANNE-MICHELLE VAN ALBADA 
what 1s known as the camel era, which began 
some 2,000 years ago. Others executed nearby 
show horses, two-wheeled carts and warriors 
Hunter-gatherers have left a vivid collection of 
petroglyphs on the Libyan plateau of Messak 
~ “Therock art of the Sahara is one of 
“ humanity’s most astonishing books of 
hours. There may be different, older ones, but 
there are few that are so beautiful or so fresh. 
It is charming as well as surprising, and it 
makes us think deeply about the enthralling 
message it has brought down to us.” 
Henri-Jean Hugot (Le Sahara avant le désert) 
The Messak plateau in the central Sahara 
(Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) has been inhabited 
since the Old Stone Age. But it was probably 
only during a wet phase of the New Stone 
Age that groups of hunters and herdsmen dec- 
orated the walls of its oases with beautiful 
engravings. Unlike the Djebel Akakus and Tas- 
sili N’Ajjer regions elsewhere in the Sahara, 
which are richin rock art, thereare hardly any 
paintings on the Messak plateau and the few 
exceptions to this rule clearly originate from 
outside the area. 
The petroglyphs found on the plateau can 
armed with spears and round shields, and may 
have been executed some time around 1500 B.C. 
Aneven older patina coats engravings of many 
small spotted Bovidae (animals of the ox fam- 
ily) that are somewhat crudely and flatly por- 
trayed. Many ostriches and giraffes are also 
depicted in these engravings, suggesting that 
they were made by herders contemporary with 
the onset of a very dry period in the region 
towards 2000-3000 B.C. 
These engravings are very different, partic- 
ularly in terms of style, from the older engrav- 
ings which constitute high-quality naturalis- 
tic art. They incorporate abstract signs and 
living creatures, and were doubtless intended 
to convey sophisticated ideas. 
A hunter-gatherer society 
It is possible to talk in terms of an area specific 
to a “Messak culture.” 
The engravings are striking first of all by 
virtue of the number and originality of the 
scenes, their rich contents, and by the tech-

niques used to make them. Some are bas-reliefs 
where foreground and background are realis- 
tically depicted by fine hammering and partial 
polishing. A special “double line” technique 
] emphasizes the impression of depth in some 
areas such as paws and muzzles.

cipal theme. The impression of numbers or a 
be dated by reference to differences in the nature 
and colour of the patinas that have formed on 
the rock surface. The most recent date from 
herd is often created by a fan-shaped series of 
heads poised at different angles and gradually 
shading off into the background from a whole 
animal portrayed in detail in the foreground. 
The overall effect is striking and bespeaks a 
high degree of compositional talent. Different 
kinds of horns, often represented in one small 
herd, are an indication of diversity. At least 
three engravings show milking scenes. Milk 
was probably stored in skins or gourds slung 
between forked branches. Cattle were used as

by these people, including short pants and 
short-sleeved shirts. Some figures wear paral- 
lel cloth strips and a loincloth which is some- 
times topped with a striped belt to which a

attached. Short bulging tunics are also depicted. 
Some men are shown wearing a codpicce.

dresses and have conical hairstyles possibly 
constructed with plaits or braids. They often 
have heavy features and prominent noses, but 
they may be wearing face masks. These stereo- 
typed women are usually shown with wild 
beasts or domesticated Bovidae. 
Arich array of beasts 
The engravings are executed with such preci- 
sion that some of the animals depicted can be 
identified with a fair degree of certainty. This

particularly applies to the large, wild Bovidae, 
some of which have since become extinct. These 
animals either stand alone or are surrounded 
by archers who are usually small. In addition 
to several species of antelopes, there are three 
large undomesticated animals: the early buf- 
falo, the aurochs and the African buffalo. The 
frequency with which aurochs and buffalo are 
portrayed indicates their importance in this 
area. Engravings representing aurochs trapped 
by a hobbling stone suggest attempts at 
domestication. Since this animal is the ances- 
tor of the domesticated ox, this mountain- 


### 111399: An Open-air museum in the Sahara

ous part of the Sahara may have been an impor- 
tant carly centre of domestication. 
Wild animals are abundant and carefully 
depicted. Elephants and rhinoceroses are often 
shown with their young in a range of 
dynamic, realistic poses. Hippopotami and 
crocodiles appear in a number of places where 
there may have been permanent watering holes 
or lakes ina wet climate. Today, thereare only 
a handful of short-lived gueltas or watering 
holes, which do not fill annually but may in 
some cases hold water for more than six 
months. Fish are rarely depicted. There are 
many pictures of giraffes, whose nuptial 
parades are sensitively and gracefully shown. 
Their coats are sometimes shown by means 
of small cup marks that give a beautiful effect. 
Ostriches, donkeys, large and small felines 
(leopards, lions, jackals), and some wild fox- 
like canines also appear. A few specimens of 
warthogs can also be seen. 
While this bestiary is limited to a small 
number of species, it is nonetheless represen- 
tative of a biotope—a small area that supports 
its own distinctive community—probably a 
wooded savannah with permanent watering 
holes on the edge of the Murzuk dunes. After 
the unusually heavy rains of 1997, the Messak 
gueltas held thousands of cubic metres of 
water for several months and some of them 
even became lakes several hundred metres 
long—providing a glimpse of what was prob- 
ably a common occurrence several thousand 
years ago. 
A fertile imagination 
Some sandstone walls are adorned with surre- 
alistic animals which reflect a highly original 
collective imagination. Fantastic hybrids—

body of a rhinoceros and an ox’s head. A few 
birds, probably mythical, are also shown. 
The most original creatures are also the 
most common. More than 140 men with the 
heads of jackals or hyenas suggest the first 
glimmerings of a well-structured mythology. 
Their superhuman activities are directed at 
large wild animals. They attack and kill rhi- 
nos and aurochs with stone axes or clubs and 
then effortlessly carry them on their shoulders 
or under their arms, wearing a satisfied grin. 
Hanging from their belt is the head or some 
other kind of trophy from a rhino or in some 
cases an aurochs. 
Their relationship with elephants is more 
subtle and complex. They stalk elephants 
aggressively, their lips curled back to give a 
ferocious display of teeth, and brandishing 
axes or clubs, but never seem to wound their

prey. One outstanding engraving shows a 
jackal- or hyena-headed elephant driver astride 
a calm elephant which holds a small rhino 
pinned upside down beneath its thigh. 
Another shows a small jackal-headed man on 
the heels of a large pachyderm, catching and 
licking its fresh excrement. 
A mysterious cosmogony 
The absence of written sources makes it diffi- 
cult to interpret this cosmogony. The figures 
described above all seem to belong to ritualized 
scenes in which composition and the attitudes 
of the figures are stereotyped. The role of 
masked men should probably be interpreted 
symbolically. A new reading of the animal 
representations might make it possible to 
identify traces of a specifically Messak cos- 
mogony. 
Any discussion of the engravings on the 
Messak plateau must address the hundreds of 
identical, abstract signs they depict, includ- 
ing oval cup marks and reticulated circles. A 
local interpretation associates these with sink- 
ing wells. There might be a generic link with 
water, or more generally, with some kind of 
fertility symbolism. These signs were certainly 
important, given their number, but their 
meaning nonetheless eludes us. 
The existence of this surprising universe 
in the world’s largest arid desert is certainly 
no accident. The cultural centres in these for- 
gotten mountains are closcly linked to the cli- 
matic past of the Saharan sub-continent. Their

altitude and the moister climate of the early 
Holocene epoch (beginning around 10,000 
years ago) fertilized the deep and silty earth 
where today the aridity and erosion of thou- 
sands of years have sterilized it. 
The origins and histories of these cultures 
are still a mystery. We can, however, suppose 
that the Messak plateau along with other 
mountain ranges of the central Sahara was one 
of the centres of development of the New 
Stone Age. The high proportion of symbolic 
images left by the people who lived there 
should not veil the message of these open-air 
engravings, namely that the people of the Mes- 
sak were above all hunters and herdsmen who 
were perfectly integrated into a living nature 
that they respected. | 
The authors would like to thank Messrs Mohammed 
Ibrahim Meshai and Saad Salah Abdulaziz, curators of 
the antiquities of the Fezzan, for their kind assistance 
in revealing the full extent of this prehistoric heritage.

location secret. 
Unfortunately, the situation has drasti- 
cally changed. Belief systems that guarded the 
sites have broken down and are no longer 
respected. Population growth has stepped up 
demands on land for agricultural use, and since 
taboos no longer act as a deterrent, people 
encroach on the sites with impunity.

### 111401: The Universality of rock art

The 
universality 
of rock art 
Unesco is mandated by its Con- 
stitution to assure “the con- 
servation and protection of the world’s 
inheritance of works of art and monu- 
ments of history and science”. 
For fifty years Unesco has therefore 
sought to encourage and promote inter- 
national action designed to ensure that 
the physical and non-physical expres- 
sions of human creativity are consid- 
ered as an indivisible whole by the inter- 
national community. It is important that 
all these expressions should be 
respected as elements of the universal 
heritage, and conserved, studied and 
transmitted to future generations. 
In accordance with its mission to 
aid its Member States, Unesco has 
included in its priorities “The safeguard 
of rock art all over the world, particu- 
larly with regard to compiling an inven- 
tory of it, conserving it, training tech- 
nicians, and promoting exchanges of 
knowledge and public information.” 
These pursuits are a token of interna- 
tional recognition of the universal value 
of a fragile cultural heritage. 
Rock art is a classic example of a 
universal art. These first known expres- 
sions of the sensibility and aesthetics of 
our distant ancestors are inscribed on 
rock surfaces in many world regions. 
From Australia to Africa, from Asia to 
the Americas and Europe, our prehis- 
toric predecessors inscribed the places

works of art which stir our feelings and 
our admiration. Rock art is the only 
form of human cultural expression 
which has been practised without inter- 
ruption from tens of thousands of years 
ago until the present day. 
In its original cultural context, it was 
protected by the respect that surrounded 
it, just like the environment of which it 
formed part. Now, in shelters or on rocks 
in the open air, rock art is subject to all 
kinds of aggression from nature and 
from people. This precious art has today 
become a threatened heritage.

THE WARA PROJECT 
(WORLD ARCHIVES OF ROCK ART) 
Since 1983, Professor Emmanuel Anati and his team at the Cen- 
tre of Prehistoric Studies of Valcamenica (Centro Camuno di 
Studi Preistorici) at Capo di Ponte (Italy) have been working on 
an ambitious project to draw up an inventory of rock art sites on 
five continents. More than 100,000 shdes and a mass of back- 
ground maternal have so far been assembled. 
The compilation of these World Archives of Rock Art at the 
Valcamonica Centre and at the Musée des Sciences de I'Homme 
in Paris is being supported by Unesco and the International Coun- 
cil for Philosophy and Humanistic Studies (ICPHS). 
Prof. Anati considers that one of the goals of these archives, 
which cover 40,000 years of the history of art, is to lay the 
groundwork for broader comparative and synoptic studies on a 
world-wide basis. “In these archives,” he notes, “we have assem- 
bled documentation concerning thousands of areas on all the con- 
tinents in which we have chosen the 150 known rock art sites 
which are most important historically and artistically speaking. 
Some of them comprise over a million prehistoric figurations, and 
many have more than 100,000 images.”

A WORLD PERSPECTIVE ON ROCK ART 
In 1983, Unesco commissioned a world report on the state of 
research into rock art. This was the first attempt on a world- 
wide scale to present an overall picture of this early form of 
artistic creativity. 
The report was published by Unescoin its “Studies and Doc- 
uments on the Cultural Heritage” series in 1984. A fuller version 
appeared in the same year in volume 21 of the Newsletter of 
the Camunian Centre of Prehistoric Studies. In 1993, ICOMOS 
commissioned another report on the state of research into rock 
art. It was presented in August of the same year at a Congress 
held at Colombo (Sri Lanka) and published as a monograph by 
ICOMOS. 
“As the author of these two reports,” writes Prof. Emmanuel 
Anati, “I have seen the amazing progress made in this field in the 
course of a decade. In November 1997, Editions Larousse in 
Paris published one of my works, L'art rupestre dans le monde, 
L'imaginaire de la Préhistoire (the Italian edition, /l museo 
immaginario della preistoria, is published under the Jaca Book 
[Milan] imprint). Here the main considerations and conclusions 
set forth in the two world reports are accompanied by further 
reflexions, an exploration of the signification of symbols and the 
syntax of associations. 
“During the writing of the two world reports, the hypothesis 
emerged that since art 1s the reflection of a mental outlook, 
rock art is a documentary source of primary importance for 
research into the conceptual and psychological foundations of 
modern men and women. In the earliest art, we find archetypes 
and paradigms which are still profoundly relevant to our own 
time.

“Our inheritance was not willed to us”. With these 
words, the French poet René Char reminded human- 
ity, amid the ruins of the Second World War, of its basic 
responsibility towards history. Thus, a generation of sur- 
vivors took up the cause of future generations. 
This new approach, this quest for human solidarity 
through both space and time, has for over fifty years been 
the task of the United Nations in general and of UNESCO in 
particular. “To save succeeding generations from the 
scourge of war” is the solemn commitment introducing the 
Charter of the United Nations. This, too, is what is meant by 
UnEsco’s Constitution when it speaks of contributing to 
peace and security by promoting collaboration among nations 
through education, science and culture. 
The world has, however, changed in the last fifty years, 
as lave the issues, the challenges and, it must be acknow}- 
edged, the dangers of modern times. On the eve of the twenty- 
first century, diffferent wars are breaking out: we have had 
experience of world wars and bloody conflicts between 
nations, hut today we are witnessing conflicts that tear peo- 
ples apart within nations. This is not the place to dwell on 
other forms of violence: violence against hope and the future 
of human beings, against their dignity, or the latent conflicts 
between cultures and between generations. The scourge 
seems to be universal. All over the world, the citizens of 
today are claiming rights over the citizens of tomorrow, threat- 
ening their well-being and at times their lives. I repeat: 
today’s citizens are claiming rights over tomorrow’s, and we 
are beginning to realize that we are jeopardizing the exercise 
by future generations of their human rights. More than ever, 
the ethics of the future requires that we devise and dissem- 
inate that culture of peace which was the aim of UNESCO’s 
founders, and sce that it is shared.

### 111402: The Ethics of the future

The ethics 
of the future 
environment: gas emissions, desert encroachment, pollution 
and the misuse of natural resources seem to foredoom the 
planet. The essential, vital needs of our children, not only the 
earth, water and air but also knowledge, freedom and soli- 
darity, are being sacrificed on the altar of short-term expedi- 
ency, ambition and profit, thus encouraging the soft options 
and selfishness of a short-sighted age, bringing to mind the 
famous saying attributed to the king of a world on the wane: 
“Apres moi, le déluge”. 
There are more serious matters still: it is not only society 
and the environment but the very essence and biological 
integrity of the human person that are imperilled. It is now 
within the realms of possibility for humans to modify the 
genetic heritage of any species, including their own. They 
even possess the grim privilege of being able to plan their own 
disappearance. Withmodern science we have almost reached 
the point of no return. Never mind the arguments about the 
compensation in technological or financial terms: there will 
be no replacement since what is destroyed has no equivalent, 
and there will be no payout since what is destroyed is with- 
out price. Who can compensate for genocide? Who would 
dare to claim that we can pay for the earth? If we want to pro- 
tect our descendants, we must first of all recognize, accept 
and come to terms with this fundamental paradox: progress 
and civilization are one side of the coin, but the other side is 
the possibility of an apocalypse, of irreversible destruction, 
of chaos. A lucid realization of that fact is the prime require- 
ment of our responsibility to future generations. Agreeing to 
curb the now unbridled power of technology by ethics and 
wisdom is henceforth the proper course. Lord Acton’s dictum 
that “absolute power corrupts absolutely” needs to be 
applied to technology, while science needs to be reminded of 
Rabelais’ saying that “science without conscience is but 
ruination of the soul”. 
But where does science dwell, and where are we to look 
for wisdom? We are nowadays able to travel to the other end 
of the earth in a matter of hours, and we are able to see for 
ourselves that, while the great cities of the industrialized

countries may possess the 
knowledge, it is in the 
remotest villages that the 
wisdom is to be found. On 
the eve of the twenty-first 
century, we at last have the 
ability to reconeile knowl- 
edge and wisdom and to 
make them benefit from each 
other’s virtues. With this in 
mind, we in UNESCO drew A 
up, with the assistance of the 
International Bioethics Committee, the Universal Declara- 
tion on the Human Genome and Human Rights whieh was 
adopted by the Organization’s General Conference in Novem- 
ber last—the first universal declaration to apply to science 
and to lay down ethical principles in this field which will 
remind us all that we are born free and equal. 
Foreseeing in order to build 
F'said we must—in the name of ethics and wisdom—agree to 
curb the power that technology gives to humans over llumans. 
The issue looms large and the challenge is a real one. In an 
age of globalization and of the acceleration and multiplication 
of exchanges, the future appears, if not dark, then at least 
unclear. Complexity and uncertainty are the key words of 
our time. I therefore invoke the virtues of an education of con- 
cern, sinee concern stirs us to action, whereas conformity 
and optimism benumb us. This is, of course, to assume will- 
ingness on our part to observe and ask questions of the future, 
for our temporal short-sightedness is often coupled with a 
wilful blindness,when not serving as a justification for it. 
Caught in the whirl of the quick fix, held in the tyrannical grip 
of short-termism, we do not take the time to shape our actions 
or think about their conseqnenees. We are hurtling into the 
future with no brakes and in conditons of zero visibility. But 
the faster a car goes, the brighter its headlights must be: it is 
no longer, therefore, a (question of adjusting or adapting— 
adjustment and adaptation always lag behind events, which 
move ahead more rapidly—Dbut a matter of taking pre-emptive 
action. We should stop talking about adjustment and adap- 
tation and take a clear-sighted, forward-looking approach, 
casting a future-oriented eye on the world. We should plant 
today the seeds of tomorrow, protecting them as they grow, so 
that tomorrow our children may harvest the fruits of our fore- 
sight. To foresee in order to prevent and to foresee in order to 
build—these are our objectives. 
Preserving the human element 
Prevention is not merely a possibility: itis an obligation and 
amoral imperative. This idea has indeed already made some 
headway in public awareness and in international law. It has 
even given rise to a new principle, enshrined in 1992 at the 
Earth Suinmit in Rio and incorporated into the Maastricht 
Treaty and some national standard-setting instruments: I 
refer to the precautionary principle. But the view of that

fragile and the perishable. We must 
bequeath to future generations the right 
to live in dignity in a world preserved. 
principle which has pre- 
vailed has been that of a 
principle of inaction rather 
than ene of vigilant action. 
Risk-taking without knowl- 
edge is dangerous, bnt 
knowledge without risk-tak- 
ing is worthless. Today, alas, 
more than five years after 
the Rio Summit, what has 
been the outcome, where 
are the results? The com- 
mitments then made have given way to evasiveness, and 
Agenda 21 has to all intents and purposes remained a dead 
letter. “Rio plus 5” is “Rio minns 5”. We have to ponder this 
lesson, and sow within democracy itself the seed that can 
revitalize and reconstitute it. That seed is and can only be 
the ethics of the future, made eentral to decision-making, 
central to democratic deliberation, eentral to the kind of 
adversarial appraisal that, rather than obfuscating, appeas- 
ing or misleading opinion by serving vested interests, the 
authorities and the powers that be, must enlighten the pub- 
lic and form its judgment. 
Prevention means first and foremost preserving. The 
cthies of the future is an ethics of the fragile and the per- 
ishable. We must hand down to future generations an inher- 
itance that has not heen irreparably damaged and polluted. 
We must bequeath to them the right to live in a world pre- 
served. This concerns first of all our living environment— 
the new preoccupation of the present age—and sneli endur- 
ing vahies as health, education, culture, equality, freedom, 
peace, tolerance and solidarity. The Catalan poet Salvador 
Esprit told his children: “I have lived to preserve these few 
words which I bequeath to yon: love, justice and freedom”. 
We are responsible not only for our tangible heritage; the 
esscntial objects of our duty and responsibility are often 
invisible and intangible. The coneept of heritage has thus 
taken on new meanings in recent decades: from the straight- 
forward preservation of historic monuments to the Con- 
vention for the Protection of the World Cultural and Nat- 
ural Heritage, adopted in 1972, and from the recognition of 
our non-material, symbolic and spiritual heritage to the 
work currently being done by the International Bioethics 
Committee on the proteetion of the human geneme, the con- 
cept of being has gradually pervaded that of having. It is 
hnman beings themselves who are the true common heritage 
of humanity, our priceless universal birthright. 
At the dawn of a new century and a new millennium, at 
a time when the global village no longer seems so distant a 
prospect, we must shoulder our responsibilities as citizens of 
the world. This means that we must become aware of our 
position, in human history as well asin space, and must reflect 
on our role on the planet and in history. One’s love for one’s 
neighbour is indeed also to he measured by the respect one 
shows for those far distant. Near or far, yesterday or today, 
other people are still our fellow creatures. Bothin space and 
in time, humanity is one body and we are its members. HW

### 111403: Cuba's biosphere reserves

GREENWATCH 
i ss 
Cuba’s 
biosphere 
reserves 
BY FRANCE BEQUETTE 
~The Soviet-made jeep, an 
“aged vehicle with many thoun- 
sands of kilometres on the clock, 
turned off the motorway leading 
from the Cuban capital, ITavana, and 
headed for Playa Girén, on the Zap- 
ata peninsula. This was where the 
Third National Seminar on Cuba’s 
Protected Areas, organized at the 
request of Antonio Perera Puga, 
head of the Environment Agency’s 
Protected Areas Centre, was being 
held. Seventy participants, from all 
the provinces of Cuba, were attend- 
ing this seminar, part of whose remit 
was to respond to a UNESCO ques- 
tionnaire drawn up with the aim of 
having the swampland on the Zapata 
peninsula (the Ciénaga de Zapata) 
listed as the island’s fifth biosphere 
reserve. 
Cuba is the largest island in the 
Caribbean, 1,250 km long, nearly 
200 km wide, and surrounded by 
some 1,600 islets and reels. Since 
two-thirds of its eleven million inhal)- 
itants live in towns and cities, there 
are scarcely more than ten people 
to the square kilometre in the rest of 
the island, with the result that the 
human impact on the environment is 
very limited. 
Seen from the air, Cuba appears 
predominantly green, with innumer- 
able rectangular fields of sugar-cane 
and groves of royal palns that alter-

nate with plantations of citrus fruits 
and bananas, The soil is deep purple 
shading into violet, and there is 
water—irrigation canals, lakes and 
rivers—everywhere. In 1900, the 
island was still half covered with for- 
est, but now only 19 per cent of it is 
forested. 
THE CIENAGA DE ZAPATA 
The Ciénaga de Zapata is the 
Caribbean’s largest area—500,000 
hectares—of wetland. Its maze of 
freshwater channels, islands and man- 
grove swamps is a haven for manatees, 
5,000 or so crocodiles, 27 species of 
reptiles and 15 species of mammals, 
but above all for 10,000 pink flamin- 
goes and for 160 species of birds, 
most of them, like the colourful 
tocororo or Cuban togon (Priotelus 
temnurus)—which together with the 
royal palm is the country’s national 
emblem—or the ivory-billed wood- 
pecker (Campephilus principalis), 
threatened with extinction. Strangely 
enough, this peninsula is still not 
listed among the sites protected 
under the Convention on Wetlands of 
International Importance Especially 
as Waterfowl Habitat (known as the 
Ramsar Convention, having heen 
adopted at Ramsar, Iran, on 2 Feb- 
ruary 1971). 
Scattered around among several 
small villages, the peninsula’s 9,000 
inhabitants make a living from fishing, 
charcoal burning and tourism. As

mental edueation forms part of the 
syllabus at all grades in the schools 
here. The Cuban educational system 
is, incidentally, so well developed that 
illiteracy has almost been eradicated, 
and as for the free national health 
system, the figures speak for them- 
selves: one doctor for every 275 
inhabitants and an infant mortality 
rate of 9 per thousand, as against 90 
per thousand in Africa and 41 in 
Latin America, for example. Cubans 
joke that they can have a heart trans- 
plant for free but can’t get hold of 
aspirins for love nor money. 
The problems of managing Cuba’s 
biosphere reserves are inseparable 
from the country’s overall economic 
situation. When we visited the Sierra 
del Rosario reserve, its manager, Mar-

the message that Cuba should not 
count on outside help, but well-tar- 
geted aid would be invaluable for the 
nature conservation enthusiasts whom 
we encountered everywhere on our 
travels. 
SIERRA DEL ROSARIO 
The Sierra del Rosario reserve is a 
25,000-hectare mountain region, 50 
km from Ilavana, with four rivers 
running through it. There are four 
types of vegetation within the 
reserve: tropieal rainforest, deeidu- 
ous woodland, pinewoods, and savan- 
nah, this last being home to many 
orchids and endemie plants. There 
are 608 species of higher plants, 90 
species of Dirds, many of them

endemic to this site, 16 species of 
amphibians, including the world’s 
smallest frog, Smithilus limbatus, 
and 33 species of reptiles. The two 
central zones consist of two rocky 
peaks rising to over 500 ne. In the 
1,000-heetare buffer zone, tra- 
versed by 175 km of roads acting as 
fire-breaks, tree-felling and hunting 
are prohibited. Guides accompany 
visitors along nature trails. There 
are several villages where the region’s 
4,000 or so inhabitants live, the most 
remarkable of these being Las Ter- 
razas, where, thanks to income from 
tonrismn, a hotel with trees huiltinto 
its design bias been constructed, and 
local craftspeople and artists sell 
wood-carvings and superb paintings 
of orchids. 
GUANAHACABIBES 
The Guanaliacabibes biosphere 
reserve is located at the extreme 
western end of the island. Its name 
derives from that of the indigenous 
cave-dwelling people who lived there 
for almost 2,000 years, until the six- 
teenth century. Its 101,500 heetares 
of never-ending beaches, jagged lime- 
stone pavements, marshland, peat 
bogs and mangrove swamps provide 
a habitat for about 600 species of 
plants, 15 of which are found 
nowhere else, deer, a large rodent, 
the hutia (Capromys ), bats, reptiles, 
wild cattle and any mimber of birds. 
Much researeh has been carried 
out on this reserve since 1985. Jorge 
Ferro, Director of the Environment 
for the large provinee of Pinar del 
Rio, who is writing a book on tiny 
orchids, has to hiteli-hike to get 
there—and has to make do with one 
roll of camera film a year. le guided 
us or the nature trails that have been 
laid out through the reserve, one of   
them in the central zone. The people 
living on the reserve are employed 
by a State forestry enterprise. Inthe 
village of Valle de San Juan there 
are 1,200 beehives, producing 59 
tons of honey a year. Funds provided 
by a Spanish organization have made 
it possible to build a large hothouse 
for growing tomatoes, for which 
there is a ready market, and solar 
panels are due to he installed in the 
village. The oldest inhabitant, 
Iisther, grows and prescribes medi- 
cinal plants. 
BACONAO 
From Havana we {lew to Santiago de 
Cuba, which is only two kilemetres 
west of the 84,0600-hectare Baconao 
reserve, anintegral part of the Gran 
Parque Nacional Sierra Maestra. 
The reserve is managed by Bioeco 
(Lastern Centre for the Study of 
Seasystems and Biodiversity), a very 
active organization for which 47 sei- 
entists work im Santiago’s Natural 
Iistory Museum. Also in Santiago is 
a garden run by Manuel Caluff, a 
veritable research centre linked to 
the reserve, established in 1976, 
where 350 species of fern and an 
abundance of orchids grow. 
Some superb cacti, meluding an 
endangered endemie species, Melo- 
cactus harlowii, are to be found on 
the dry eoastal tablelands. The 
scenery is very different around the 
Gran Piedra, a mountainous area of 
the reserve which has 138 species of 
endemic plants and 919 species of 
animals. Its pines, which were grown 
for timber and are gradually being 
replaced by native species, are inter- 
spersed with tree-ferns and other 
types of fern—no fewer than 335 
species—and terrestrial orchids 
(Phaius tanckervillie).

### 111403: Cuba's biosphere reserves

CUCHILLAS DEL TOA 
From Baconao, a mountain road 
leads to the Cuchillas del Toa 
reserve, near Baracoa, the first town 
in Cuba, founded in 1512. The 
reserve’s central zone encompasses 
the Alejandro de Humboldt Park, 
60,000 hectares of mountainous ter- 
rain traversed by countless rivers and 
with an annual rainfall of 4,000mm, 
where there is no question of ven- 
turing without a guide. 
We were shown around by the 
park’s director, Rael Acebal Suarez, 
who told us that 70% of its plant 
species are endemic; more than half 
of the species growing in Cuba are to 
be found there. There are four farm- 
ing communities within the park. Its 
67,000-hectare buffer zone has been 
seriously damaged by agricultural 
activities, and a recent forest fire did 
nothing to improve matters. The local 
inhabitants are helping to replant the 
mangrove swamps, where there is a 
population of manatees. Since meat, 
like other staple foods, is rationed, 
they are allowed to hunt wild pigs 
and hutia hut are urged to do so in 
moderation. Two villages designed to 
meet the needs of “ecotourism” are 
being built with funds provided by 
Germany. 
PRIVILEGED RESERVES 
Compared with so many other bios- 
phere reserves we have visited on four 
continents, those in Cuba—even if 
their boundaries are not always 
defined as accurately as they might 
be—are on the whole in a very good 
state of preservation, thereason being 
that there is very little industry in 
Cuba, its population density is 
extremely low, its transport system 
is sketchy and its economic situation 
is such that nothing can be wasted. 
Since bottles, plastic bags and paper 
are in short supply, people don’t lit- 
ter the countryside with them. Those 
who enjoy the privilege of access to 
the reserves appreciate their value 
and respect their biodiversity. Last 
but not least, the scientists who work 
there are dedicated to their task and 
do not look for financial rewards. 
They manage as best they can, 
uncomplainingly, endorsing the 
Cuban proverb, Cuando no hay 
perro, se montea con gato—if you 
haven’t got a dog, a cat will do, or, 
beggars can’t be choosers. [|

UNPOPULAR BISON 
By 1900, there were no more than two dozen bison 
left in Yellowstone National Park (U.S.A.). Bison have 
since been reintroduced and the herds have been re- 
established, but the proliferation of these animals 
has not been to everyone's taste. Around a third of 
all the bison that died during the unusually harsh 
winter of 1896-97 were killed outside the park at the 
request of nearby ranchers who claimed that they 
could infect their cattle, with brucellosis in particular— 
although no cases of brucellosis have been officially 
reported and elk, which also carry the disease, have 
not been shot. . 
PROTECTING 
SRI LANKA'S MEDICINAL PLANTS 
A $4,570,000 loan from the Global Environment Facil- 
ity will enable the Sri Lankan government to set up five 
protected zones to preserve medicinal plants. Of the 
1,414 plants that are commonly used by Sri Lankans 
for medicinal purposes, at least 189 are endemic to 
the island, and 79 of these are threatened with extine- 
tion through uncontrolled gathering and the conver- 
sion of their natural habitats into farmland. This loan 
will make it possible to improve existing nurseries and 
create new ones, to create a network providing infor- 
mation about these plants, and to raise public aware- 
ness of the need to protect them. o 
COMPLETE RECYCLING 
The United States Information Agency recently raised 
the possibility of creating new materials to replace 
plastic. These biopolymers (many molecules linked 
together to create one large molecule) made from the 
waste products of the agro-food industry would 
have all the characteristics of normal plastics but 
would be biodegradable. When composted, they could 
be used as fertilizers. w 
REDUCING WASTE 
The United Nations Zero Emissions Research Initia- 
tive (ZERI) programme at the United Nations Univer 
sity (see Unesco Courier, March 1986) is enjoying 
increasing success. The University of Tokyo has con- 
tributed $10 million to the programme. In 1995, a 
ZERI office opened in Bogota (Colombia), and another 
in Windhoek (Namibia), where, with funding from Japan 
through Unesco and UNU, a first chair was created ©

in 1997. On the occasion of the programme's Third 
Annual World Congress, held in Jakarta (Indonesia) in 
1997, six universities agreed to collaborate on a 500- 
hour interdisciplinary course leading to a Master's 
degree in integrated biosystems that will enable stu- 
dents to establish direct links between science and 
technology. The aim of turning waste matter into raw 
materials may thus finally become a reality. rR 
WILL THE B10-BIO 
CONTINUE TO RUN WILD? 
The Bio-Bio River (Chile), one of the world’s last major 
freeflowing rivers, is about to be blocked by a second 
hydroelectric dam. Activist Juan Pablo Orrego, founder 
of a river protection group, claims that this dam will 
flood 34 square kilometres of a richly diverse forest, 
dooming 14 plant and animal species to extinction 
and, more especially, covering the ancestral burial 
grounds of 101 Pehuenche Indians. Orrego, who 
received an ecology award in 1997, was unable to 
prevent the construction of a the first, smaller Pangue 
dam. In addition, the Pehuenche Indians have mixed 
feelings about the project. n 
ISTHE END IN SIGHT 
FORTIGERS? 
No-one can say for certain how many tigers there are 
left in the world, most estimates ranging from 5,000 
to 7,000. lt is, on the other hand, easier to count 
dead ones: in India, for example, 63 were killed in 
1997. Carcasses have even been found in the Andhra 
Pradesh reserve, which is where they are supposed 
to be best protected but where the wardens, less 
well armed than the poachers, have great difficulty in 
protecting them. H 
A NEW PARK FOR CAIRO 
The Aga Khan Foundation plans to invest $15 mil- 
lion to lay out a 30-hectare public park in the Al Azhar 
neighbourhood of Cairo (Egypt). The creation of this 
park will form part of the Foundation’s programme of 
support for historic cities, under which 1t will also 
undertake, with the co-operation of local community 
development organizations, the rehabilitation and 
protection of the environment along Cairo’s historic 
city wall. om

### 111404: Elijah ben Solomon Zalman, the gaon of Vilna

Anniversary Elijah ben Solomon Zalman, 
the gaon of Vilna 
 
A great 18th-century Jewish scholar 
and spiritual leader who marked 
the thinking of eastern Europe's Jewish communities 
 
~ Elijah ben Solomon Zalman, who 
© was born in 1720 in Seletz, near 
Grodno, was considered to be a genius 
from his childhood. Even before he was 
thirteen years old and passed the bar 
mitzvah ritual admitting him into the 
Jewish community as an adult, he had 
already become interested in the natural 
and religious sciences. 
Ile married at eighteen, and had many 
children. After a stay in Keidany with 
his father-in-law, he travelled to Poland 
and Germany and visited numerous J ew- 
ish communities. Then he settled on the 
outskirts of Vilna in the Grand Duchy 
of Lithuania, and later moved into a 
house of study in the city which was cre- 
ated for him and which he directed. 
Thanks to an inheritance, he and his 
family liad 2 home and a small stipend for 
life, in addition to the regnlar salary paid 
him by the city’s Jewish community, 
which had elected him its gaon or spir- 
itual leader. By the time he was thirty 
years old, his reputation had spread 
beyond his own community, hut he 
nonetheless firmly refused to become a 
rabbior to accept any otlier official posi- 
tion. Ile preferred to remain a spiritual 
leader and live a secluded life devoted 
to study. 
The story goes that he studied at 
night by candlelightin order to be able to 
concentrate, and slept only two or three 
hours a day. This also enabled him to 
keep up a voluminous correspondence 
with rabbis and especially to study the 
compilation of law known as the 
Jerusalem Talmud. 
When he was over forty, he emerged 
from seclusion and began to teach some 
twenty pupils. Ilis reputation grew even 
further. An important rabbi from 
Jerusalem paid tribute to him as “the 
brilliant light of the century”. Tlis advice 
was much sought-after and his opinions 
had the weight of authority. 
The dispute with Hassidism 
However, a pietist movement known as 
Hassidism developed in Galicia and 
spread rapidly to Jewish communities 
throughout castern Enrope. Its mysti- 
cism appeared to many as an antidote to 
hard times, and instilled in them a com- 
plete change of heart. Tlassidism, whieh 
in a sense “democratized” the faith, 
preached the joyfnl adoration of God, 
rejected asceticism and attempted to 
make the medieval mystical doctrine of 
Kabbalah widely aceessible. 
The gaon of Vilna was violently hostile 
to the Hassidim, whom he described as 
“mystics like leprosy on the body of 
Israel.” Ile thought the Tlassidie cult of 
the Tsaddikim (Just Men endowed with 
divine power and perception) could give 
rise to false Messiahs. lle managed to 
have their centres closed and pronounced 
an anathema (here m) on their hooks, 
The Czarist authorities became 
involved and the dispute became more 
than a purely theological debate. A num- 
ber of Ilassidic leaders were even brielly 
imprisoned. In 1777, two of the move- 
ment’s leaders, Menahem Mendel of 
Vitebsk and Schneur Zalman of Liadi, 
vainly attempted to bring about a recon- 
eiliation. Elijah hen Solomon stood firm, 
and in 1794 ordered a public burning of 
the book written hy the movement’s 
founder, Israel ben Eliezer, known as the 
Baal Shem Tov (Master of the Good 
Name). This established the gaon as the 
leader of the mitnagdim, or those who 
opposed the ITassidie movement. 
The gaon’s message 
The gaon’s refutation of Iassidism was 
based on the principle of the eternity of 
the Talmud, the first five books of the 
Bible, which record Jewish Law, includ- 
ing the ten commandments received by 
Moses in the desert. The gaon of Vilna 
BY HENRI MINCZELES 
believed that true Jewish learning could 
only be based on a close study of the serip- 
tures and that it was necessary to know 
the Bible as well as all later commentaries 
and writings, notably the Talmud. 
The gaon also considered that knowl- 
edge of biblical texts should not be con- 
fined to an elite, and that for educational 
reasons women should also have access 
to it, especially the Book of Proverbs. 
Ite was also interested in the natural 
sciences, and claimed that “if a man has 
no knowledge of the secular sciences, he 
cannot truly understand the Torah.” le 
was a keen student of the natural sci- 
ences and other disciplines including 
musie and medicine. 
He is credited with some seventy stud- 
ics and commentaries, more than fifty of 
which were printed after his death. 
These inelude explanations and discus- 
sions of Talmudic texts as well as analy- 
ses of Ilebrew grammar, a subject which 
faseinated him. Ilis pupil Issachat Baer 
anthologized his prayers aud favourite 
reading in a volume entitled Maaseh Rav. 
A number of sayings attributed to the 
gaon of Vilna have survived, such as “The 
Torah is like the vain; it nourishes nseful 
plants and weeds”, and “Life is endless 
pain and sulfering, and sleepless nights 
are our common lot”. Ilis personality 
helped shape an outlook typical of the 
Lithuanian Jew, influenced by the 
region’s cosmopolitanism and by the per- 
sistence of rationalistic Judaism. 
Towards the end of his life, the gaon 
was obliged to confront another progres- 
sive reform movement, the askala, led 
by Moses Mendelssohn, the translator of 
the Bible into German. le feared that 
this movement would lead to Jewish assim- 
lation and the loss of Jewish identity. 
On the eve of Yom Kippur 1798, the 
gaon of Vilna fell ill and died shortly 
thereafter. The exact date of his death 
is uncertain and some sources date it to 
1797. The plain mausoleum where he is 
buried is setin the Jewish quarter of the 
new Vilna cemetery. Tt reealls to Jews a 
great thinker and rigorous man who was 
a faithful servant of Judaism. ||

### 111405: It's rumba time!

LISTENING 
It's rumba time! 
BY ISABELLE LEYMARIE 
The deportation of millions of Africans to the Americas during the dark centuries of the slave 
trade was one of the worst tragedies of history. It also gave rise to an extraordinary process of 
cultural exchange. The story of the rumba shows this transatlantic cross-fertilization at work. 
Afro-American music began making its 
way back from the Americas to African 
shores in the 1920s. It had changed, and 
returned in a creolized, hybrid form whieh 
engendered stimulating new musical forms 
such as mbaqanga in South Africa, juju in 
Nigeria, “highlife” in Ghana and mbalax in 
Senegal. At the same time, contemporary 
African music, influenced by jazz, soul, funk, 
rap, Cuban rhythms, reggae, beguine and 
calypso began moving to the New World, hear- 
ing fertile seeds of change. 
Much secular Afro-Latin and Afro- 
Caribbean music is of Bantu origin, from 
regions which once belonged to the ancient 
kingdom of Kongo. American dances such as 
chumbe, paracumbe, fandango, candombe, 
yuka, makuta, samba and conga are all 
danced to a regular drum beat with strong 
hip gyrations and pelvie thrusts and can incon- 
testably be traced back to Kongo sources. 
The Congolese musician Rido Diendonné 
Bayonne (see box) has recently traced the 
remarkable history of the rumba, 
The rumba brava, which is derived from 
fertility and war rituals, first appeared in Cuba 
in the mid-nineteenth century. Today, it is still 
danced in the poor neighbourhoods of [Tavana 
and Matanzas, and in Cuban communities in 
the United States. The dance has three vari- 
ants: the erotic guaguanca, the yambi, which 
ismore buttoned up, and the acrobatic colum- 
bia, which is usually a men-only dance. The 
most popular version today is the guaguancé, 
and its rhythms have been widely incorporated 
into Latin jazz and salsa.

The birth of son 
Some years later, a move hybrid rhythmn known 
as son was born in the rural areas of Cuba’s 
Oriente province. Spanish in origin, son has 
become syncopated through eontact with 
Blacks. It was initially played using amarim- 
bula (xylophone) or a tres (a type of guitar 
with three double chords), a bongo and a 
botija, a jug which the instrumentalist blows 
into to produce sounds like a bass. Needy 
musicians often made rough-and-ready tres 
out of packing boxes for codfish, Like samba 
or calypso, son lyries are a mine of broad and 
satirical lumour and constitute a juicy chron- 
icle of Cuban life. 
Son took rootin Ilavana in the early twen- 
ticth century. It was censored in the 1920s 
during the dictatorship of Gerardo Machado 
because it was regarded as too “African”, hut 
it survived in the city’s Black neighbourhoods. 
Under the influence of jazz, the trumpet soon 
became part of son combos, which were seven 
strong and usually included two singers. Com- 
petitions were held among different groups 
and occasionally degenerated into altercations | 
requiring police intervention. 
In the 1920s, when the tango and popular 
Mexican music were all the rage in the United 
States, several American firms offered record- 
ing contracts to son groups. The Sexteto Occi- 
dente, the Septeto Ilabanero, the Septeto 
Nacional and the Trio Matamoros all helped 
win a reputation for this music whicl then 
very quickly made its way into the homes of the

white Cuban middle class. Havana's elegaut 
clubs soon began opening their doors to son 
musicians. 
Together with rumba brava, son is still 
highly popular ameng Cubans today, and is the 
basis of the dance music known as salsa. 
From rumba to soukous 
At the same time, in Africa and particularly in 
Congo and the former Zaire, where music lovers 
licar the distant echo of their own musical her- 
itage in Cuban rhythms, many “Latin” bands 
were created, their singers reproducing Span- 
ish lyrics phonetically without understanding 
what they meant. Promoted under the more 
commercially appealing name of “rumba”, a 
blend of son, West Indian beguine and indige- 
nous rhythms later gave rise to Zairean and 
Congolese rumba. Just as anecdotal asits Cuban 
cousin, this African rumba recounts the small 
details of daily life, and praises the charms of 
women and nature using the melodie scansion 
of lingala (a Bantu language). 
With the rise of Rock n’ Roll and the pop- 
ularity of the twist in the 1960s Congolese 
groups replaced their acoustic guitars with 
electric gnitars. Towards the end of the 
decade, the soukous, a hippy dance that is 
particularly suggestive when performed by 
women, became more popular than the local 
rumba. Influenced by sonl and by the Chris- 
tian hymns introduced to Africa by mission- 
aries, sukous also underwent changes and 
became more dynamic and more fundamen- 
tally African. |

A festival of rumba 
In April 1998, the Congolese composer, band-leader and multi-instrumentalist 
Rido Bayonne is organizing a four-day music festival in the Paris suburb of Clichy 
la Garenne to commemorate the abolition of slavery in the French colonies in 1848. 
The event, entitled “Autour de la Rumba”, will feature Cuban and Congolese 
music, zouk, Senegalese reggae, hip hop, the art of African griots, and rhythm 
and blues. There will also be a more surprising encounter between rumba and 
baroque and classical music. 
Rido Bayonne’s Big Band Afro-Jazz, the Saint-Chaffre du Monastier Band 
and a chamber orchestra will join forces for the first performance of Bayonne’s 
latest composition, Mémoires (Cause a effet) which is inspired by the transat- 
lantic musical saga. 
West -African chordophones, Arabic drums, fifty horns and some 20 Western 
string instruments—violins, cellos and basses—will all perform together. Five 
flautists perched in a baobob tree will then play “a hymn to life and to the 
spritual communion of the continents.” Below them, female singers and dancers, 
accompanied by guitar, piano, keyboard, drums, and other percussion instruments 
will celebrate the latest forms of this creative blend of jazz, blues, sukuss, 
calypso, reggae and rumba. 
The slave trade and the upheavals it caused thus give way to a euphoric 
musical marriage celebrated by effervescent rhythms. This heartfelt and highly 
personal tribute to African ancestors who were forced to make the journey to Amer- 
ica is also a hymn to human brotherhood brought together on this occasion by 
the magic of art, and the artist's universal vision and creativity. LL NE

### 111406: Interview with Izet Sarajlic

interview 
= 
wi
 
° MW Poetry has been part of your life for half a 
century. How do you see this art-form today? 
Izet Sarajlic: I'm sorry to see that poetry has lost 
the place it should occupy in people’s lives, Poets 
are partly responsible for this, but the spirit of 
the age is also to blame. When I was young, 
Neruda, Sartre, Malraux, Camus, Tuwim, Frost 
and Ungaretti were the important writers. Living 
in that world brought responsibilities as well as 
pleasure; you had to surpass yourself. Imagine 
having a poem published in a magazine next to 
one by Neruda! We couldn’t afford to be 
mediocre. In today’s literary world, it’s not dif- 
ficult to pass yourself off as a poet. The poet will 
soon belong to an extinct species. I fear that peo- 
ple will eventually stop reading us altogether. 
MH Are you equally pessimistic about the future 
of prose? 
L.S.: Yes, because I think that modern novelists 
couldn’t care less about that essential thing 
known aslove. I can’t remember the last heroine 
I fell in love with. The age of Anna Karenina is 
gone for good. Today's novelists writc against a 
background of violence, and they want to shock 
their readers. In modern novels there is a kind 
of indifference, a failure to connect, whose causes 
I cannot fathom. Is it because writers are trying 
to appeal to the culture moguls who announce a 
“new sensibility” every five years or so? 
After the Sarajevo tragedy, I had the oppor- 
tunity to make several trips abroad. I was amazed 
to see splendidly bound works by so many 
nonentities displayed in bookshop windows. 
There are so many bestsellers and so few great 
writers. The era of great art is over. It seems as 
though we’ve lost the joy of creation.

Izet Sarajlic is widely 
regarded as Bosnia’s greatest 
living poet. A member of the 
Bosnia and Herzegovina 
Academy of Arts and Sciences, 
he has published more than 
15 collections of poetry and a 
volume of memoirs. Avolume 
of his works was published in 
English under the title Poetry 
by Dist 136 Press, 
Minneapolis, in 1975. His two 
most recent books, written in 
Sarajevo during the war, have 
been translated into French as 
Le livre des adieux and 
Recueil de guerre sarajévien 
(1997). Here he is interviewed 
by Jasmina Sopova.

upside down, not only for me but for everybody. 
All the old landmarks have gone. Immorality will 
soon replace moral values and lies will replace truth. 
This change has happened very quickly. If the 
world had moved more slowly in this direction 
(which actually leads to a dead end), people might 
have had the time to prepare themselves psycho- 
logically. But this is impossible because of the 
speed at which things are moving. 
I feel that civilization took a wrong turning 
about thirty years ago, as if the powers-that-be 
had pointed it in a direction in which I can see no 
future. Tvappals and depresses me that this utter 
confusion is accepted as the normal human 
condition. 
HM Was it the war that changed your view of the 
world? 
I.S.: To some extent, yes. I've always thought 
that humanity needed responsible politicians 
and that there were fewer and fewer of these. It’s 
no accident that the war which has destroyed my 
former homeland should have happened at a 
moment 1n history when there was no longer 
anyone capable of giving a constructive turn to 
political events and leading this poor world, so

rich in trivia and so poor in basics, into the 
twenty-first century. 
When foreigners who came to Sarajevo dur- 
ing the war asked me what I thought about the 
West’s attitude to Bosnia, I used to tell them 
that while Tito had had the guts to stand up to 
the might of Stalin, nobody today—neither the 
United States, nor France nor Germany—is capa- 
ble of saying “no” to a local bandit. 
The war also taught me something else. It 
showed me that the behaviour of the world’s

thinkers is not only irresponsible but immoral. 
And so was the conduct of some of the generals 
stationed in Bosnia and Herzegovina. I’m think- 
ing of one of them in particular who was reported 
to have raped young Muslim girls who were 
brought to him in brothels. Everybody knew 
about it. Everybody turned a blind eye. 
The war also showed me the meaning of sol- 
1darity. We received great support from ordinary 
people, especially in France, Italy and Switzer- 
land, and without it we would not have sur- 
vived. [ used to think that the Swiss were people 
who didn’t show their feelings. Well, it was the 
Swiss who showed us more kindness than any- 
one else. 
M Cultural life in Sarajevo was pretty dynamic, 
wasn’t it? Musical life, theatre and publishing all 
went on. 
L.S.: The Latin saying whereby people fall silent 
when the guns roar is false. Some very fine work 
was produced in Sarajevo during the war. It would 
be a good thing if foreigners could read some of 
the stuff we wrote, so that they could under- 
stand that civil war is a plague, that it is conta- 
gious and that it could happen elsewhere in the 
world, in an even more terrible form. 
MB In one of your books, Recueil de guerre, you 
say: “If I've survived all this it’s thanks to poetry 
and to a dozen or so people, ordinary folk, true 
saints of Sarajevo, whom | hardly knew before the 
war.” 
L.S.: I wrote my two war books in my cellar as 
shells whistled overhead. I couldn’t, like Eluard, 
paint the word “freedom” on the walls of Sara- 
jevo because no walls were left standing. So I said 
to my wife: “Look at me, I am like a late twen- 
tieth-century Milton, writing a Paradise Lost by 
candlelight.” 
But I didn’t start out with the idea of writ- 
ing poetry. I didn’t care about poetry. It’s along 
time since I was interested in poetry. Just before 
the war, I wrote that the worst places for poetry 
were the very places where poetry could be found. 
When I said that poetry had saved me, I meant 
that these extremely unhappy war years were per- 
haps the happiest years of my life as a poet. I was 
motivated, [ had readers, or rather listeners. We 
had no paper for printing and I was not on close 
terms with the few publishers who had any. In 
any case, they specialized in pseudo-religious 
work and propaganda, and so I wasn’t very keen 
on being published by them. Nevertheless, my 
poems reached the public, which made me very 
happy indeed. During the war, my literary and 
moral standing in the eyes of my fellow citizens 
seemed to be high. I saw that they wanted to 
help mein one way or another. They would step 
aside for me when we queued for water, although 
‘Iam Muslim, My wife is 
Catholic, her family came 
from Austria, and our 
daughter married an 
Orthodox Christian. 
I hope that my grandson 
will put his hand on the 
shoulder of a Jew. 
That would complete 
the family portrait.’ 
I naturally never took advantage of that, and 
they would give me a cigarette, or an apple for my 
grandson. 
BM In those circumstances, poetry becomes 
something different, doesn't it? 
I.S.: When a man has a dressing gown, when he 
has enough to eat, when he can step out onto 
his balcony, eat cherries or drink his coffee with 
his own cigarette and not one he has had to beg 
for, then he can think about aesthetics and aes- 
theticism. But when he’s surrounded by mis- 
ery and is a prey to itas well, when he finds him- 
self completely isolated and degraded, he asks 
himself “Where are the simple, normal words? 
Have they abandoned art?” 
I have had a portrait of one of my favourite 
poets, Boris Pasternak, in my bedroom for a 
long time. For me, 1t was a relic. It’s still there, 
despite the three million shells that have report- 
edly fallen on the city. One day, when T happened 
to be in my bedroom and not down in the cel- 
lar, I looked at it and suddenly thought that even 
he, the wonderful Pasternak, no longer meant 
to me what he once did. So many fine words, 
such perfect harmony, yet nothing about my 
suffering, nothing about human suffering. 
M Has the war changed your poetry? 
L.S.:I don’t think there’s any fundamental dif- 
ference between what I wrote before and during 
the war. The form may vary somewhat here and 
there. When shells are bursting around you, you 
have to get itdown as quickly as you can, so you 
don’t pay much attention to form. In any case, 
when you have something to say, the form 
chooses itself. I'm not the kind of writer who 
searches for a poem. A poet shouldn’t do that. A 
poem should search for—and find—its poet. 
I haven’t changed and I haven't felt any need 
to. I gotinto poetry after World War II. In 1942, 
the Italian fascists shot my older brother. In 
everything I've done since, I’ve tried my hardest 
not to betray the memory of that young man. 
I’m now over fifty years older than he was then. 
He’s the person I'm answerable to. 
In today’s super-ideological age which repu- 
diates all previous ideologies, I stick to the posi- 
tion I chose at the end of what we now call the 
“other” war, 1939-45. That was a time when we all 
believed that love could be revived and we 
thought we had to write as if we were planting a 
birch tree in the municipal park or fixing a door- 
bell to a door. We were all in favour of love and 
remained faithful to it, except for some who 
betrayed it during this recent war. 
BM Do you think that such idealism is still 
possible today? 
LS.:I don’t know. [ can’t think now the way I »

» did when I was young. I’m no longer capable of 
being as generous as I was then. “Universal” 
thoughts are far from my mind. My doorstep is 
the limit of my world these days. I’m concerned 
about my wife’s health, my daughter’s job, my 
grandson’s future! I’m eager to redecorate my 
flat and put my bedroom in order. If I write a 
poem or two amidst all that, well and good, but 
If not, too bad. Perhaps I have written enough. 
Hl A French television programme about 
Sarajevo and your family showed that part of your 
flat had been seriously damaged. 
I.S.: One day, the Chetniks? shelled my flat three 
times. They thought they’d killed me, so they 
stopped firing and went away. I received a blow 
on the head and collapsed. When I came to, it 
was quite funny. A painting had fallen on top of 
me and I woke up with my head in the frame, like 
a Rembrandt! 
Hl [I've known you since | was a child but I've 
never asked you about your religion. 
L.S.:’maMuslim. So what? I’ve never lived ina 
predominantly religious environment any more 
than any of my compatriots. I can’t see people as 
Orthodox or Muslim or whatever. Religion may 
be important to some, but it’s a personal matter. 
I was in Strasbourg not long ago and I 
couldn’t understand why everyone kept insist- 
ing on the fact that I was Muslim. They told me 
that it was important to say so. [ didn’t consider 
it to be important at all. In the same way, foreign 
journalists who came to Sarajevo would often 
ask me whether I thought that all these ethnic 
groups could live together. I would always answer 
by introducing my family to them and saying: 
“My wife is Catholic, her family came from Aus- 
tria and our daughter married an Orthodox 
Christian. I hope that fifteen years from now, 
when the time comes for my grandson Vladimir 
to experience the same kind of sufferings as 
Gocthe’s young Werther, he will put his hand 
on the shoulder of a Jew. That would complete 
the family portrait.” 
Hl Do you think that Bosnia has any future in the 
present situation? 
I.S.: I don’t know. Like many people, rightly 
or wrongly, I support the Dayton Agreements. 
Yet I know that they are not the real solution. 
The people who are deciding the fate of Bosnia 
have not grasped the soul of the country, but 
they talk with amazing glibness about corridors, 
republics, federations, and so on. 
There’s one thing that the West doesn’t 
understand, or doesn’t want to. In Spain, we saw 
a dress rehearsal for Western fascism, and in 
Bosnia we saw the same thing for Eastern Euro- 
pean fascism. In Spain, fascism came to power, 
unfortunately; as luck would have it, ours did 
not. But there is no proof that it has definitively 
failed. Anything is possible today. [|
