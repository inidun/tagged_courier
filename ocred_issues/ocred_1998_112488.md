### 112490: Land-hungry in Brazil

The occupation of vast 
under-used estates by 
Brazil's Landless Rural 
Workers’ Movement (MST) 
might seem like a struggle 
from another age. In fact 
the movement is offering 
new responses to the 
greatest scourge of modern 
Brazil— social exclusion.

Ww ding Brazilian farm labourers take 
over their Promised Land it may 
look like a scene from the remake of a great 
film epic. In reality, it is not the workers who 
are out of sync with the times but the great 
landowners or fazenderos who own most of 
the land in Brazil, an enormous country 
with 350 million arable hectares. 
In few countries is there such a glaring 
inequality in private land ownership as 
there is in Brazil. At the bottom of the lad- 
der, five million families do not have have 
even the smallest plot to cultivate. Just 
above them, six-and-a-half million “family 
smallholdings” are packed into the quar- 
ter of the farmland where 80 per cent of 
Brazil’s rural population lives. At the top 
of the ladder, 500,000 great estates, avera- 
ging 600 hectares each, occupy three- 
quarters of the arable land. Brazil's 
National Institute for Settlement and 
Agrarian Reform (INCRA), a public 
body, has found that 150 million hectares 
of the fazendas are under-used, including 
20 million fertile, easily accessible hectares 
that could be farmed immediately. 
On 17 April 1996, an MST proces- 
sion was marching to the capital of Para 
State in the Amazon region when military 
police opened fire at Eldorado dos 
Carajds killing nineteen.Since 1985, over

A combative art 
The New York Times has hailed Brazilian photographer Sebastido Salgado as the author of “ some 
of the most compelling photojournalism in the last twenty years” and as “an artist using journa- 
lism as a vehicle for his art.” The French daily Le Monde has dubbed him “one of today’s masters 
of black and white photography”. 
The 53-year-old economist-turned-photographer has used Paris as a base for years while tra- 
veling the world over for his extraordinary photo coverage of the “ wretched of the earth” .Between 
1986 and 1992, he scoured 26 countries on every continent to capture on film the impact of the 
major social transformations taking place. The investigation resulted in a book (Workers: an 
Archaeology of the Industrial Age, Aperture Books, 1993 ) published in nine languages and featu- 
ring in some 60 exhibitions. 
In 1994,Salgado began focusing on migrants. He decided to dedicate six years— up to the year 
2000—to covering the hundred million international migrants and some 40 million who stream 
into cities from the countryside each year in search of work. 
“1 want to state the case for migrants and those who take them in. To show their dignity in 
their desire to integrate and their courage in facing their ordeals. To show how they contribute their 
spirit of enterprise and the richness of their differences. To show, from the migrants’ example, that 
we must build the family of all humankind on the basis of solidarity and sharing.” 
Convinced that MST is “the only political movement really fighting for human dignity in 
Brazil” ,Sebastido Salgado has used his work as a photographer to support its struggle. The results 
have proven to be a surprising success with “Terra” (Phaidon), a book of 109 photographs taken 
in Brazil between 1980 and 1996 with a preface by the Portuguese writer José Saramago and a CD 
by singer Chico Buarque. The book featured on Brazil's best-seller lists for months, and has been 
published in seven other countries. At the same time, 45 of the photos were used in an exhibition 
of which 3,500 copies were made for Brazil alone, where they are being shown in trade union 
offices, churches, universities, cultural centres and public places, as well as in MST premises. 
Outside Brazil,non-governmental organizations like Fréres des Hommes (France and Belgium), 
Christian Aid (United Kingdom) and Solisfond (Switzerland) are promoting the exhibition, which 
can be bought for $500.Proceeds from the exhibition and book sales will be used to set up a trai- 
ning school for people working in the assentamentos orhomesteads. The celebrated architect Oscar 
Niemeyer is ready to donate plans for the school,which is to be built in a suburb of Sdo Paulo and 
will enroll around a hundred students at each training session. |

process of appropriating unused land or 
confirming a usually precarious right of 
occupation. 
“For big landowners, the peasants’ 
demands are an intolerable threat,” says 
Jodo Pedro Stedile,a member of the MST 
national executive. “They strike back vio- 
lently with their henchmen or through a 
state machine in which they have a great 
deal of leverage.” 
The movement has nevertheless been 
successful. In 1991, some 15,000 landless

as close as possible to the unused or

attracted widespread media attention. 
Today, their ranks have swelled to more 
than 40,000. Moreover, about 150,000 
families have recently been settled on over 
five million hectares in more than 1,500 
assentamentos, homesteads set up for the 
beneficiaries—or the victors—of the batt- 
le for agrarian reform. 
After being at a standstill for decades, 
land reform is starting to pick up speed 
again. The first land redistribution law 
dates back to 1964, but subsequent mili-

the Amazon region. President Fernando

Henrique Cardoso says that “the agrarian 
structure, which was inherited from the 
colonial period, is inadequate and 
unjust.” By settling 300,000 families on 
more than 14 million hectares between 
1995 and 1998, he claims that his 
government will have done “more than 
has ever been done in the past.” But this 
leap forward is also the result of a shift in 
the balance of power, for which the MST 
is largely responsible. 
The rural exodus, in which the urban 
population rose from 30 to 80 per cent in 
half a century, helped build a wall of 
indifference between the towns and the 
countryside. With great tactical expertise, 
MST thrust the agrarian question into 
p— AND I 
  
       
the spotlight. At the same time,by forcing 
its way into the big estates, the movement 
has created a series of faits accomplis that 
compel the government to take account 
of the landless and negotiate with them. 
The typical MST member is under thirty- 
five, did not finish primary education,has 
at least three children, is a descendant of 
European immigrants who arrived in 
Brazil in the first half of the twentieth 
century, and before joining the movement 
worked either as a seasonal day labourer 
or a full-time agricultural worker. 
In just a few years, the movement has 
managed to create a network of alternati- 
ve economic and social ventures. For 
example, 400 “farm co-operation” groups p

### 112491: A Fresh outlook

A fresh outlook 
U NESCO’s connexion with the men and women around the world whose role it is 
   
to discover, to think and to communicate, to work with knowledge and ideas, is at 
the heart of its activities. This is an enormous—and awesome—privilege, and 
UNESCO's perspective on our times,on its promises and its failures,is all the sharper 
and more original because of it. 
The sharpness is due to the quality of the information UNESCO gathers from 
leading specialists in the vanguard of international research and development in a 
wide range of disciplines. The originality stems from the convergence and confronta- 
tion of all these flows of information, which create a momentum that transcends the 
barriers between disciplines and the borders between states. T his perspective is thus 
universal in the sense that it is both planetary and all-embracing. 
What does it reveal? The range of possibilities facing humankind is now wider 
than ever before, largely because of advances in science and technology. The speed 
and scope of this expansion have led to a threshold effect, a leap into the unknown. 
The balance has been disrupted between the rhythm of time, the division of space, 
the assimilation of new knowledge, the authority of institutions and the exercise of 
that authority. We are faced with an existential choice. Either we rush headlong into 
the future, managing these upheavals in an unimaginative, short-sighted fashion. Or 
else we acquire together the means to become informed, to analyse, discuss and eva- 
luate the advantages and drawbacks of the possibilities available to us, before deci- 
ding how we can move towards a future in 
which everyone can benefit equitably and 
The range of possibilities facing thus peacefully from this immense stock of 
knowledge. 
humankind is now wider than ever before, In the twentieth century. physics and 
largely because of advances in science chemistry made tremendous strides. Their 
and technology. 
success brought abundant energy and made 
it possible to manufacture countless pro- 
ducts that have become invaluable in fields 
ranging from medicine to telecommunications. In the twenty-first century, biology 
and information technology will continue to advance and interact. As a consequen- 
ce, far greater resources will be produced, for health care and agriculture, for 
example. Humanity will also find it possible to accelerate or alter natural changes and 
even to produce the genetic material of an “artificial nature” resulting from human 
willpower and imagination. 
But to what end? Is humankind engaged in a grand design, a common purpose? 
Today, distances are shrinking, frontiers are disappearing and national sovereignty is 
crumbling, yet there are no signs of the emergence of the twenty-first century’s pla- 
netary agora, where such a design could be freely shaped, accepted and applied. 
For now, the law of the survival of the fittest still prevails. Power lies in the hands 
of those who combine possession of the most advanced knowledge with massive 
resources. Walls are going up across the planet as well as within each nation. They 
divide actors from spectators, subjects from objects, haves from have-nots in every 
sphere of politics, economics, society, culture and education. 
UNESCO has the privilege to receive this contradictory message, which holds out 
tremendous hopes and warns of terrible dangers. It also has the duty to reflect it 
accurately and spread it widely. The UNESCO Courier has always contributed to this 
process. Its new format, the first issue of which you are now reading, remains faith - 
ful to the magazine's original purpose of presenting information and viewpoints from 
leading world specialists. But it also breaks new ground as it seeks to provide livelier 
coverage of the crucial issues of our time, and bring our ideals of peace, justice and 
freedom closer to our readers. We hope that the Courier will stimulate you to think 
anew about the world. [|

### 112493: Fanning the flames of greed

Fanning the flames 
Drought was partly to blame for the huge fires that recently swept through tropical 
forests in Asia and Latin America— but the main culprit was human avarice. 
r almost a year now, vast forested 
tracts of the globe have been burning 
down one by one. It all began in August 
1997 in Malaysia and Indonesia. Then in 
April this year it happened in the Amazon, 
the Philippine island of Palawan and ele- 
ven States in Mexico. 
On 19 September 1997 a state of 
emergency was declared in Sarawak, the 
Malaysian State in the northern part of 
the island of Borneo. About two million 
people were warned to stay indoors 
because of the thick smoke (twelve times 
more carcinogenic than tobacco smoke) 
from forest fires in Kalimantan,the island 
of Sulawesi and Irian Jaya, in Indonesia. 
Fumes from the hundreds of thousands of 
hectares ablaze affected some 70 million 
people in Southeast Asia to varying 
degrees. 
Indonesian environment minister 
Sarwono Kusumaatmadja said the health 
of 20 million of his compatriots was 
threatened. The least hardy of them died. 
Many accidents occurred. Air and sea 
traffic was disrupted. An Airbus plane 
crashed in Sumatra on 26 September 
1997, killing 234 people. 
El Nin0’s fault? 
The guilty party was said to be El Nifio 
(which in Spanish means the Christ 
Child), a climatic phenomenon which 
appears at Christmas-time every three or 
four years, and sometimes every seven to 
ten.When the trade winds, which usually 
blow across the Pacific from east to west, 
lose strength, an enormous mass of warm 
air about the size of the United States, 
normally held in position by winds near 
Indonesia,heads for the coast of Peru and 
then moves away in the opposite direc- 
tion, towards the east. 
This movement is part of a climatic 
fluctuation known as the El Nifio Southern 
Oscillation (ENSO) which is thought to be 
responsible for the weather disturbances 
around the world last year and this. 
1 2 THE UNESCO COURIER 
In 1997, the monsoon rains came late. 
In Indonesia, the fires began in August 
during one of the most severe droughts of 
the past fifty years. In fact, they had been 
smouldering since 1982-83, when a hea- 
vily-logged area of 3.5 million hectares— 
as big as Belgium—had burned. The 
conflagration was helped along by the 
abundance of peat in Kalimantan, as well 
as by seams of coal and lignite which 
sometimes run close to the surface. Even 
heavy rains failed to put out the smoulde-

ring fires which burned on for lack of 
bulldozers to cut wide trenches to act as 
firebreaks. 
But if unusual weather fanned the 
flames, the main culprits were human 
beings. A distinction must be made bet- 
ween small peasant and big farmer. Both 
use fire as a tool, but to different degrees.

controlled and lack of water and fire-figh- 
ting equipment, along with difficult 
access, mean that forests are lost. 
Fire has always enabled the native 
peoples of Borneo and Sumatra to live off 
the land. Their often-criticized slash-and- 
burn method of cultivation is not as 
harmful to the environment as is some- 
times thought, as long as the land is left 
fallow for some time. T he soil is not natu -

rally fertile, so the absorption of ash from 
fire over two or three years enriches it. 
The secondary forest grows back and fif- 
teen or twenty years later the peasants 
burn it down again. 
Miriem Bouamrane, a young econo- 
mist who has lived in Java and Sumatra 
and works for the International Centre for 
Research on Agroforestry (ICRAF) based 
at Bogor, near Jakarta, cites the Dayaks, 
one of the region’s main ethnic groups, as 
an example. “They aren’t being irrespon- 
sible,” she says. “These are age-old prac- 
tices. They live in very close contact with 
nature and only burn a small area and 
watch that it doesn’t spread. They also 
worship trees in their religion and are 
always planting them. They use the pro- 
ducts of the trees but also save from 
extinction species like the damar, which 
produces the resin which is their main 
source of income.” The most convincing 
evidence of this is that just about the only 
places where the tropical forest survives 
are the areas where the Dayaks live. 
But the “settlers” which the govern- 
ment encourages to leave overpopulated 
Java with an offer of between one and five 
hectares of land on neighbouring islands 
behave differently. They do not have the 
same knowledge and try to make quick 
profits growing rice, pepper or coffee. 
Scorched earth 
The Brazilian State of Roraima, along the 
border with Venezuela and Guyana, went 
up in flames in January 1998. But accor- 
ding to an official of the Amazon Research 
Institute (INPA), the fire really began 
there twenty-eight years ago, when the 
then-military government began the sett- 
lement of Brazil's Amazon interior by 
luring small farmers from the overcrow- 
ded south-central and north-eastern parts 
of the country. “In 1978,” says Reinaldo 
Barbosa, “the State had 80,000 inhabi- 
tants, 32,000 of them Indians, and was 72 
per cent forested. By 1996, the population 
had grown to 262,000. The settlers 
conquered Amazonia by burning down 
the forest.” Like the settlers in Indonesia, 
the newcomers in Roraima had used fire 
rather than bulldozers, and between 1978 
and 1996 cleared land increased fifty-fold. p

  Ta” OY 
. 3 «9 
In Borneo, a mother and her young son fight a fire 
sweeping through their pepper plantation. 
  The forest—a refuge and a nursery— 
was their foe. “The plans of the Settlement 
and Agrarian Reform Institute (INCRA) 
only spread poverty by encouraging the 
settlers to destroy the forest,” says Barbosa. 
“The proofs that a hectare of cleared land 
in Roraima is worth ten times more than a 
hectare of forest.” The Environmental 
Institute (IBAM A) suggests that the sett- 
lers, who are officially not allowed to clear 
more than half of their 100-hectare plots, 
start fires illegally to do the job. 
Land ownership is crucial in a country 
where two per cent of the landowners 
possess more than half the surface area 
being farmed and are greedy for more. 
Walter Blos, head of the National Indian 
Foundation (FUNAI), warns that many 
white farmers are keen to get their hands 
on the 10 million hectares of Indian reser- 
vations that fires have already significant - 
ly encroached upon. 
Stricter laws 
In Indonesia, timber companies and com- 
mercial tree plantations have been quite 
legally carving up the tropical forests for 
more than fifteen years in pursuit of 
maximum returns. And fires stoke up the 
profits. Not only do the logging compa- 
nies not have to clear the forest floor of 
unsaleable timber, but they enable the

fire-cleared ground to be planted with 
crops like palm oil or eucalyptus which 
bring in quick profits. 
According to Indonesia’s forestry 
minister, between 500,000 and 700,000 
hectares of forest have been turned into 
plantations in the past fifteen years. On 
the burned forest areas, which range in 
size from 300,000 to 900,000 hectares, 
560 deliberately-started fires were recor- 
ded. Sometimes this was to the detriment 
of the perpetrators: according to the UN 
Food and Agriculture Organization 
(FAO), the fires in mid-October also 
consumed 76,000 hectares of productive 
forest and 90,000 hectares of coconut, 
palm oil and rubber plantations. 
President Suharto reminded the 
country that starting fires had been ban- 
ned since 1995, but this did not deter the 
big companies. In October 1997, 160 
Indonesian firms were found responsible 
for starting fires. Out of forty-six investi- 
gations, five led to legal action. In 
Malaysia, the seventeen firms found guil- 
ty were fined a total of $8,000 and that 
was that. In Brazil, President Cardoso 
signed an environmental protection mea- 
sure into law on 12 February. It does not 
punish slash-and-burn, so as not to pena- 
lize Amerindians like the D ayaks, who use 
the method with care. But it decrees pri- 
son terms and the closure of firms found 
guilty of ecological crimes. It is tougher 
than the law it replaced, which only 
enabled the government to collect six per 
cent of the fines imposed. But will it be 
more of a deterrent? 
The experts at ICRAF are very pessi- 
mistic. “The forest fires in Indonesia will 
not stop until all the country’s forests 
have disappeared,” they say. The cause of 
the fires in the Amazon and Mexico are 
the same. Are the forests there also doo- 
med to destruction? [|

### 112494: Fears for a new millennium

Fears for a new millennium 
technology are three fears of the future shared by environmentalists and the public at large. 
G enetic manipulation, the emergence of unknown viruses and the impact of new information 
Inthe next 20 years, specialists say, radically new threats will be added to thelist of those beset- 
ting the planet today. In a survey carried out in 72 countries by the French ministries of research and 
the environment with support from the European Commission, a thousand scientists were asked to 
rank the dangersin order of importance. The poll’s results w ere published in early 1998. 
Genetics and biotechnology top the list of concerns. “ Basically this has to do with genetically 
modified organisms,” says Alain Pavé of the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS). 
“ People are afraid that genes introduced into certain plants will spread into the environment. This 
is possible either through hybridization of different plant species or through a virus that picks up 
the genes and takes them elsewhere.” 
Second, researchers are afraid that the results of their work are analysed too hastily. Climate 
forecasting is a typical example,” says Pavé.“ The models converge where temperature increase 
at planetary level is concerned, but there is no agreement asto how it will affect different regions. 
The data we have cannot justify worldwide measures to cut greenhouse gas emissions.” This does 
not prevent catastrophic scenarios on the consequences of global warming in local contexts from 
making the rounds. 
Researchers themselves are sometimes tempted to engage in more or less inspired guess- 
work. For example, they fear the emergence of new diseases “through fear of viruses like HIV or 
Ebola spreading from their natural environments,” Pavé says. “ In all likelihood, Aids developed as 
a result of contact between people and wildlife in central Africa. But we still don’t know what 
mechanisms govern these phenomena.’ 
Some scientists are wary of new information technology, which they regard as a threat to 
diversity. “ Our environment is shaped by culture,” Pavé explains. “ If societies become standardi- 
zed, so will landscapes” However, he acknowledges that no one knows what the long-term 
effects of information technology will be. Perhaps that’s precisely why people are worried.

### 112495: Poison of the earth

They are harmful to people and the environment, but nothing stops dangerous pesticides 
from crossing borders. At least for now. 
ome people who want to die know that 
Spas 1s a cheap, effective poison. 
ust one teaspoonful is all it takes. 
Trouble is, the herbicide also brings a slow 
death to those who want to live. 
A 1996 Greenpeace study says that 
managers of rubber and palm oil planta- 
tions in Malaysia, including some owned 
by Western companies, were using and 
over-using paraquat and many other high- 
ly toxic substances. When inhaled or 
absorbed through the skin, they can 
damage the liver, kidneys and lungs and 
cause nosebleeds, miscarriages, sterility, 
cancer, and neurological and behavioural 
disorders. 
In the southern countries, they are 
often sprayed excessively by poorly-infor- 
med farmworkers who lack protective 
equipment. They can be found in markets 
between the sugar and the washing powder 
in harmless-looking boxes that do not 
make the slightest mention of their harm- 
ful effects. 
David Pimentel, a specialist at Cornell 
University in the United States, says that 
each year pesticides kill 220,000 people 
and make another three million sick. 
“Eighty per cent of all pesticides are used 
in the developed countries,” he notes, “but 
fewer than half the poisoning deaths occur 
there.” In all, 25 million workers are at risk 
in developing countries. 
An expanding market 
Over- and carelessly-used pesticides not 
only kill people. They endanger the future 
as well. Pimentel says their indiscriminate 
use “causes $100 billion worth of damage 
to the environment every year,” including 
$8 billion in the United States alone. 
Among other things, pesticides kill the 
natural enemies of certain pests, boost 
those pests’ resistance to chemicals, des- 
troy pollinating insects, fish and birds and 
contaminate food, water and soils. 
Meanwhile, business is booming. The 
world pesticides market has grown steadily 
over the past decade. In 1996 estimated 
In Haiti, a training session in the use of pesticides. 
sales amounted to approximately $30 bil- 
lion, according to Barbara Dinham of The 
Pesticides Trust, a London-based non- 
governmental organization. “The pesti- 
cides trade,” she says, “is dominated by ten 
major agrochemical companies who 
control 80 per cent of global sales.” 
Europe, the United States and Japan are 
the main exporters,followed by developing 
countries such as India, China, Mexico, 
South Korea, Indonesia, Brazil and 
Colombia. The market is growing at a brisk 
pace in Latin America and Asia, and 
African countries are boosting imports for 
their export crops. 
But the trade includes chemicals that 
are banned or strictly regulated in indus- 
trialized countries. The Foundation for the 
Advancement of Science and Education 
(FASE), an American non-governmental 
organization, says approximately 14.4 
tonnes of pesticides that are illegal in the 
United States were exported from the 
country every day in 1995 and 1996. 
Europe is no better, but Dinham says it is 
“unfortunately not possible to pin a num- 
ber on European exports because there are 
no details concerning them in customs 
records.” 
Tightening the rules 
So far, legal curbs on the trade are only 
local or voluntary. In late 1989 FAO draf- 
ted a “prior informed consent” procedure 
(PIC), asking countries exporting “extre- 
mely hazardous” products to obtain per- 
mission from importing countries. But 
only the European Union has made the 
procedure mandatory. A convention on 
trade in pesticides and hazardous chemi- 
cals that will be signed in Rotterdam this 
September aims to make it universally bin- 
ding. But no one can say how effective it 
will be.

### 112495: Poison of the earth

United Nations Environment Programme 
(UNEP), ninety-five countries agreed on a 
draft last March. It says that the products 
concerned—so far only twenty-two pesti- 
cides and five other industrial chemicals 
that are banned or strictly regulated in two 
countries in different regions—can only be 
exported with the importing country’s 
explicit consent. 
Why not ban the trade outright? 
“There is no global consensus,” says Paul 
Whylie of Jamaica’s Pesticides Control 
Authority. He argues that “the Convention 
is another means of putting pressure on 
manufacturers because they have to go 
through heavy procedures.” But that still 
does not mean they will be used. 
“Governments will not reject a pesticide, 
even a very hazardous one,” Dinham says, 
“if the country makes heavy use of it, 
unless they have a substitute that costs the 
same.” Carl Smith of FASE adds, “I don’t 
think the PIC agreement will reduce the 
trade in chemicals. But it’s a step in the 
right direction” which shows that govern- 
ments are at least willing to share informa- 
tion. The stakes are high. “Data does 
exist,” Smith says,“but it is generally guar- 
ded by industry as ‘confidential business 
information’. Without a clear picture of 
what the countries participating in the PIC 
process are importing and exporting, it will 
not be possible to know if the parties are 
abiding by the convention.”

PIC does not provide for sanctions on 
rule-breakers, and there are plenty of ways to 
get around the agreement. Especially since 
production of most outdated hazardous che- 
micals is increasingly located in developing 
countries. For example, India manufactures 
DDT and China produces chlordane and 
aldrin. If these countries see economic bene- 
fits in producing hazardous pesticides, they 
will most likely continue producing them.

FAO estimates that there are more than 100,000 tonnes of obsolete pesticides in developing coun- 
tries, including 20,000 in Africa.Stocks in the Near East countries are put at 5,000 tonnes. Several 
countries in Asia and Eastern Europe have stocks in excess of 5,000 tonnes each.Due to the absen- 
ce of environmentally sound disposal facilities stocks are constantly increasing. Some are over 30 
Disposal costs vary from $3,500 to $5,000 per tonne. Costs of disposing of pesticide stocks in 
Africa alone are estimated at over $100 million. The best disposal methods is high-temperature 
incineration, according to FAO. None of the developing countries— except for a few newly indus- 
trialized nations— have facilities for the safe and environmentally sound disposal of pesticides. 
Without financial support from agro-industry, governments and aid agencies, this environmental 
FAO has published guidelines in English, French,Spanish and Arabic on the accumulation,sto- 
rage and stock control and disposal of bulk quantities of obsolete pesticides. 
1 6 THE UNESCO COURIER 
This raises an ironic possibility. In the end, 
the developing countries that the convention 
is intended to protect could become the lea- 
ding exporters of chemicals on the PIC list. 
Furthermore, Whylie adds, “A pesticide may 
be shipped as a consumer chemical, like 
pharmaceutical products and cosmetics, 
which are not subject to PIC procedures. 
Hazardous substances can always travel 
under those labels.” And then there’s the 
black market. “The convention doesn’t 
address illegal trafficking,” says Fatoumata 
Ndoye of the 
Chemicals and Pesticides 
Gambia’s Hazardous 
Control and 
Management Board. “Our borders are 
porous. We need resources for the training of 
customs officers.” 
But at a time when development aid is 
dwindling, no additional funding to train 
people how to handle, inspect and control 
hazardous substances is planned. Yet that 
may be exactly where the efforts should 
begin. 
The organic alternative 
If farmworkers knew how to use pesticides 
properly, consumption would be cut in half, 
Pimentel says. In some countries, such as 
Sweden, consumption has already plumme- 
ted by over 50 per cent. Likewise, Indonesia 
has slashed the use of pesticides on rice by 
65 per cent while boosting the crop yield by 
12 per cent. But, adds Pimentel, “people 
use more of them than they should because 
pest control is a complex technology.” They 
are spurred on by aggressive chemical 
industry advertising campaigns and easy 
access to chemicals, which are sometimes 
imported to southern countries as part of 
development aid programmes. 
Smith says the intensive use of pesti- 
cides is just one link in a food production 
that 
“Chemical-intensive, export-based agri- 
chain few call into question. 
culture has one clear benefit: cheap food 
for citizens of developing countries. It is 
also clear that farmland has been degra- 
ded, ecosystems polluted and the variety of 
subsistence crops diminished. The number 
of landholders is decreasing and profits 
from agriculture are concentrated in fewer 
hands. These trends create a climate that 
encourages the marketing and use of pesti- 
cides. Organic methods are more time- 
intensive and may require more workers. 
In the short run, an organic approach 
might seem less profitable.” For whom? Hl

### 112496: Ending apartheid in education

Ending apartheid in 
education 
Salim Vally* South Africa is responding to one of the people’s main 
demands by opening up the education and training system 
to all citizens. 
ur years after the fall of apartheid, South 
Africa is finally rebuilding its educatio- 
nal system. “The basic idea is to facilitate 
the democratic transformation of the national 
education and training system,” says Samuel 
Isaacs, director of the South African Qualifi- 
cations Agency (SAQA) in charge of setting 
up the new education system, which is cal- 
led the National Qualifications Framework. 
A committed pastor and citizen, Isaacs was at 
the forefront of the anti-apartheid struggle. 
Education and professional training 
were at the heart of the political struggle 
against the former system, and “education 
for all” was a key theme of Nelson 
Mandela’s speeches as soon as he became 
president. Youth demonstrations against 
segregation in education and the attempt to 
impose the teaching of Afrikaans, one of 
the white minority’s two official languages, 
touched off the Soweto riots, crushed by a 
bloody crackdown in 1976. 
Many grassroots organizations, local 
church and religious groups and women’s 
movements, which were very active in the 
1980s, set up evening and technical trai- 
ning courses for non-white adults to offset 
the public education system’s shortco- 
mings. Today these courses are officially 
recognized. 
The new system includes proposals for 
lifelong education made in the early 1990s 
by the powerful 1.8-million-strong 
Congress of South African Trade Unions 
(COSATU), which had, alongside the 
African National Congress (ANC), played 
a key role in the mobilization against apar- 
theid. COSATU’s demands focused on 
better training for black workers. 
Today the education of non-white 
adults is a priority. “Blacks, Coloureds and 
Asians,” according to the official classifica-   ©

tion but hold most of the unskilled, low- 
paid jobs and have few opportunities to 
upgrade their qualifications. The Job 
Reservation Act had excluded them from 
many jobs and training programmes. In the 
late 1980s, only 17 per cent of technicians, 
3 per cent of architects and 0.1 per cent of 
engineers were black. In public administra- 
tion, Whites held 96 per cent of managerial 
positions, and while the country’s economy 
is based on mining, there has only ever 
been one black mine manager. The result of 
these discriminatory policies is 38 per cent 
unemployment among Blacks, compared 
to 6 per cent for Whites. 
Qualification certificates 
Under the new system currently being 
developed, students with “non-formal” 
training may enter the “formal” educatio- 
nal system at any age. Students leaving 
school at any level must have access to pro- 
fessional training. 
“In concrete terms,” says Isaacs, “a per- 
son with ten years’ on-the-job experience in 
accountancy will be able to obtain a certifi- 
cate that will allow him or her to get a pay 
raise, apply for a job as an accountant 
somewhere else or continue training—to 
1 8 THE UNESCO COURIER 
for 
example. A highly qualified nurse who 
become a chartered accountant, 
wants to study medicine will enter medical 
studies at the intermediate level.” 
Around forty Education and Training 
Qualification Assurance Bodies (ETQA) 
will be authorized to issue “qualification 
certificates” in every industry, from chemi- 
cals to transportation, retail and environ- 
mental protection. An inventory of all the 
available training opportunities in the 
country is being drawn up. At the same 
time, schools and universities will have to 
change their programmes to make more 
room for science and technology and 
encourage greater self-sufficiency on the 
part of the learner. The reform, which is 
called Curriculum 2005, should be com- 
pleted by that year. 
To fund the programme, employers, 
including the state, must pay a training tax 
amounting to between one and 1.5 per cent 
of their wage bill. Some companies already 
offered training programmes, mostly to 
managerial staff. But in 1996, 42 per cent 
of companies spent less than one per cent 
of their wage bill on training, and 56 per 
cent of small firms offered no training at all. 
Each year the government increases the 
  
proportion of the education budget alloca- 
ted to adult education and training. 
Although the amount seems minimal—one 
per cent of the total education budget—it 
has doubled since 1994. In 1997, 450 mil- 
lion rands, or $83 million, were spent on 
adult education and training. 
Today, 10 to 15 million adults in South 
Africa lack basic education or skills. An ave- 
rage 350,000 adults take training courses 
each year, but the SAQA expects that the 
figure will rise to 700,000 in 1998 and 2.5 
million by 2001. 
It remains to be seen whether these tar- 
gets will be met. Some specialists wonder if 
the reform is not too complex for a still- 
developing country and fear that the system 
favours the best qualified workers. Above 
all, critics point to a contradiction between 
the government’s education plan and its 
free-market economic policies, with budget 
cutbacks, especially in education. Still, 
South Africa’s far-reaching education 
reform is a first step towards achieving the 
goals of millions of people who were invol- 
ved in the long struggle for democracy and 
equality. |

### 112497: A Second chance for success

A second chance for suooess 
In the French city of Rheims, a group of teachers is carrying out a promising experiment 
to give school dropouts a second chance. 
adia, a fifteen-year-old Algerian girl, 
N came to Rheims in the middle of the 
1997/98 school year. It was impossible 
to admit her to the final stage of secondary 
school, especially since she barely spoke 
French. When she was sent to the Robert 
Schumann School to take a Vocational Inser- 
tion Course, or “Cippa” (Cycle d’Insertion 
Professionnelle par Alternance), she expec- 
ted the worst. Little did she imagine that she 
would soon be working in radio, films and 
publishing, as well as teaching Arabic to her 
classmates and teachers. 
“It all started fourteen years ago,” 
explains Jean-Luc Muracciole, a literature 
teacher who is responsible for the Rheims 
Cippa, “when the Education Ministry crea- 
ted a scheme to enroll school dropouts in a 
sandwich course, where theyd work two 
weeks for a firm and spend two weeks in a 
booster class to prepare them for read mis- 
sion to the normal educational program- 
me.” Muracciole has taught in prisons so he 
has personal experience of problem situa- 
tions—but even so, he took on the task with 
considerable trepidation. It would be no 
easy task, he thought, to teach these young 
people a trade with a minimum of dignity 
attached to it. 
Instead of trying to adapt the students 
to the school system, Muracciole tried to 
adapt the system to the students. He broke 
down the barriers between the major sub- 
ject areas, using sound and pictures to esta- 
blish an audiovisual link between physics 
and languages. Instead of conjugating verbs, 
the students are taught to communicate 
with the outside world, where they learn 
how to make films about subjects discussed 
in the classroom, taking turns as camera- 
men, actors, set designers, directors and 
press agents. Philosophy, which is taught in 
the final years of secondary school, is used 
as a bridge between maths and French. The 
students read the works of modern authors 
and then meet them personally in radio 
interviews, to give them a taste of journa- 
lism and production. 
The courses are given a la carte: some 
are taught to the entire class, while others 
are given individually or to small groups. 
Three teachers cover the basic subjects. 
Director Ludwig Trovato teaches video and 
gives lessons in Romani, the language of 
Europe’s Gypsies. Even students find them- 
selves being pressed into service as tea- 
chers—Nadia, the Algerian girl, was asked 
to teach her mother tongue to a class inclu- 
ding two of her own teachers. The same 
holds for Corsican, Italian, Portuguese and 
Russian. 
Guest speakers from the world of litera- 
ture, philosophy, journalism and publishing 
also give talks. At the same time, the students 
follow correspondence courses provided by 
the National Centre of Distance Education 
(CNED). “Since this course is entirely based 
on written education, it rounds out our oral

approach,” explains Jean-Luc Muracciole. It 
is also helpful in preparing the students for 
France’s school-leaving diploma, the bacca- 
laureat: “It enables the students to take part 
in university or professional life, and it helps 
us, the teachers, to evaluate our methodolo- 
gy by comparison with the traditional sys- 
tem. One year we had a 100 per cent success 
rate.” 
Adapting the system 
to the students 
Currently, anyone at least sixteen years old 
who has failed to complete his or her secon- 
dary education (and this includes voluntary 
dropouts) can register with Cippa and 
continue studying. The only snag: the maxi- 
mum quota of 24 places is being over-filled 
with more than 50 students per year, and 
there is a long waiting list which could soon 
easily reach 500. Muracciole wants to go 
further and create an experimental school— 
and he is doing his best to persuade the 
authorities to provide the funds. 
Romain, who recently entered the 
school,describes how he threw in the towel 
just before the end of the final year of secon- 
dary school: “I couldn’t take it any more, it 
was such a rat race. My friend Stéphane 
told me how great Cippa was, so I decided 
to register. After the first week, I felt com- 
pletely at home. Here we're taught by the 
older pupils as well by the teachers. It’s like 
one big family. When classes are over we go 
on talking things over . .. in the street or in 
a café. People talk about everything under 
the sun.” Stéphane entered Cippa in late 
May of 1997, after dropping out of high 
school and, later, the Compagnons de 
France crafts school. So far he has taken 
part in filming the first two of a series of 
thirty-five videos commissioned by the 
French Museums Service, and he loved 
every moment of it. “It’s fantastic to com- 
municate impressions, textures and light 
with a camera!”, he says. He is the camer- 
man on a film sponsored by the city of 
Dole, in eastern France. It is a modern ver- 
sion of Romeo and Juliet with a French 
Romeo and a North African Juliet.

### 112497: A Second chance for success

Social Sciences, and came to Cippa three 
years ago. Since then she has tried her hand 
at all kinds of things: book publishing (the 
house publishing firm, “La Terra Trema”, 
already has six books to its credit); an exhi- 
bition on Italian writer and film-maker Pier 
Paolo Pasolini; and the editing of a feature- 
length film entitled Loralité en question, 
which a team of her classmates shot in 
Marrakesh. 
Oral communication—oralité—is one of 
the main vectors in the transfer of knowled- 
ge, as Jean-Luc Muracciole is fully aware: 
“For young second and third generation 
North Africans,” he says, “Arabic is the lan- 
guage for expressing feelings, while French is 
the language of authority, order and obliga- 
tory integration. French has a harsh image, 
and by increasing the proportion of oral 
communication in the classroom, we help 
them bring the two cultures closer together.” 
The students are responsive to the idea. 
After Marrakesh, one film crew has gone on 
to shoot a movie with the Gypsies of 
Romania, another is in Corsica—an expe- 
rience which has awakened an interest in 
regional languages. “I discovered Corsican 
at a concert given by the I Muvrini’ group,” 
says Fred, with all the authority of his twen- 
ty years. He feels he has learned enough at 
Cippa to enter university to take a liberal 
arts course or enroll in a film school. He is 
already at work, outside Cippa, on a radio 
project. He knows about radio from his 
hour-long programme every Saturday night 
on Rheims’ “Radio Primitive” interviewing 
French and North African writers. 
New projects 
This year the students are leaving the radio 
studio for one of the best cafés in Rheims, 
the Brasserie Bleue, to hold philosophical 
debates attended by several hundred people 
from all walks of life. In autumn they will 
launch the first issue of a quarterly magazi- 
ne, Salle d’Attente (“Waiting Room”), as 
well as start working on a CD-ROM. 
This educational experiment—the only 
one of its kind in France—has already pro- 
ved its worth. According to a report by the 
Rheims education authority, 99 per cent of 
the school’s graduates have found their 
place in society. The course could be used as 
a model in other areas, where the school 
dropout rate is even more alarming. Jean- 
Luc Muracciole believes that, in countries 
with a strong oral tradition, the method 
would be even more successful than in 
France: “We’ve seen proof of this in 
Morocco and Romania. Cippa hopes to 
‘twin’ with schools in other countries, so 
that we can introduce their teachers to some 
of our methods.” [|

### 112498: Hard times for teachers

Hard times for teachers 
e world’s 57 million primary and secondary school teachers work in conditions that 
are a matter for concern.T hey are neglected by educational policies and are benefit- 
ting little from the new technologies which were supposed to revolutionize their pro- 
fession.T he latest (1998) edition of UNESCO’s World Education Report is categorical: 
“...it has not just been teachers’salaries and status which have failed to benefit in recent 
years from policies towards public expenditure on education,” the report points out. “T ea- 
ching and learning conditions and the material situation of the schools generally, in pro- 
bably a majority of countries,have also failed to benefit.” 
In the countries of the South, the number of pupils and students has exploded in 
recent decades. But the number of teachers, their salaries and above all school equip- 
ment have not kept pace because of budgetary belt-tightening. In India, over 60 per 
cent of primary school teachers teach more than 50 pupils on average, 34 per cent teach 
between 51 and 100, and 5 per cent over 100. Many schools have no blackboard and 
in some cases no desk for the teacher, and few textbooks, if any. 
In the industrialized world, “students’ social behaviour”is “of growing concern in a 
number of countries”. The Report denounces violence at school, which is detrimental 
both to teachers’ morale and to educational efficiency. 
The Report shows the limits of hopes vested in new technologies by recalling that 
most of the world’s schools do not even have electricity. At best the new technologies 
help to stimulate “thinking and debate about teaching and learning” and enable tea- 
chers “to ‘network’with other teachers about what they are doing”. Perhaps to tell each 
other about what a hard day they have had. N. K-D. H

### 112499: The Sea and its treasures

It is time humankind stopped 
abusing the generosity of the 
ocean, wellspring of Earth’s life- 
support system. 
¢ H ow can the ocean be in trouble? It’s so 
huge!” T he speaker, an avid fisherman, 
had just read an article about pollu- 
tion creating a so-called “dead zone” in the nor- 
thern Gulf of Mexico, and was sceptical.“I love 
the ocean,” he said.“But I can’t imagine that we 
can do much to harm a system so large and resi- 
lient. The sea seems infinite, timeless!” 
My friend’s perception of the ocean has 
been a common one—until recently. As the 
waters of the world have become increasingly 
stressed, an awareness of their importance to 
humankind has come into sharp focus. 
Fishermen find it increasingly difficult to find 
once numerous species—cod, capelin, swordfi- 
sh and many more. Phenomena such as the El 
Nifio have created widespread appreciation of 
the role of the ocean in shaping climate and 
weather. Water evaporates from the sea’s surfa- 
ce and forms clouds that yield fresh water back 
to the land—and sea. About 97 per cent of 
Earth’s water is marine, and of the remaining 3 
per cent, 97 per cent is frozen as polar ice and 
snow. Water, of course, is vital for life. There 
may be water without life, but nowhere, even in 
the most arid deserts and driest valleys in 
Antarctica, is there life without water. 
The recent discovery of water on Europa, 
one of Jupiter’s moons, has aroused much spe- 
culation about whether life might be prospe- 
ring there, perhaps associated with undersea 
volcanic activity, like the communities that 
develop around hydrothermal vents in our own 
deep sea. Plans are now underway to send spa- 
cecraft to Europa that can deploy a robot 
capable of boring through three kilometres of 
ice before descending into a sea that may be 
forty kilometres deep. Meanwhile, Earth’s 
ocean remains largely unexplored. We have 
barely begun to imagine the energy potential of 
harnessing the waves, the healing powers of 
marine bacteria or the sustainable possibility of 
feeding the world’s hungry through algae. A 
veritable treasure trove,the ocean’s greatest gift 
may well be the Earth’s history captured in so

But perhaps the most astonishing thingupon which living things prosper—though not necessa- 
entering the ocean with a face mask and flippers 
is the discovery that it is not just a place filled 
with rocks and water. It is like a soup, a special 
kind of minestrone, where the bits and pieces are 
alive! “Living fossils” are everywhere. Nearly all 
of the thirty-three major divisions of animals 
and a dozen broad categories of plants and other 
organisms that have existed for hundreds of mil- 
lions of years are at least partially represented 
there; only about half are terrestrial. 
Every living thing on Earth acts on the sur- 
rounding environment, initiating small but real 
changes. All are components of the grand machi- 
nery that makes Earth what it is: a living planet, 
our life support system. The immense diversity of 
life causes change and provides the ingredients 
necessary to respond as change occurs. The resi- 
lience of natural systems is remarkable, evidenced 
by the ability to rebound after storms, fires, colli- 
rily the same living things. 
Knowing that our 
Earth more or less as it is in terms of life sup- 
port functions, it makes a lot of sense to figure 
out whether the swift changes we are presently

and go. 
At night, our cities glow with an otherworld- 
ly light, created by consuming millions of years 
of fossil wealth. Complex, naturally productive 
ecosystems are disappearing, to be replaced by 
geometrical plots bearing vulnerable single-spe- 
cies crops. Other changes are less obvious—the 
removal of millions of tonnes of living creatures 
from the ocean in the past century, and the 
addition of billions of tonnes of trash—excess 
fertilizers, pesticides and other noxious sub- 
stances. Might such actions alter the way natu- 
ral systems behave? Should we worry about the 
consequences of taking unprecedented quanti- 
ties of wildlife from the sea? 
Energy ‘middlemen’ 
We have perfected ways of killing the ocean’s 
giants and their diminutive cousins—the nine 
species of great whales,more than fifty kinds of 
“small” whales, dolphins and porpoises, and all 
marine turtles. Many are now endangered or 
threatened. Bluefin tuna weighing 450 kilos, 
huge halibut, cod as large as the fishermen who 
catch them, century-old sturgeon, large sword- 
fish, marlin, sailfish, sharks and many other 
once common giants are suddenly rare. 
Acoustic sensors developed to find enemy sub- 
marines now locate fish, squid, shrimp and 
other creatures for hunters to engulf with enor- 
mous nets, some large enough to swallow a 
dozen jumbo jets. 
  
24 THE UNESCO COURIER 
Recently, the populations of more than 100 
marine species listed by the World Conservation 
Union as threatened or endangered, sharply 
declined. Large populations of ocean wildlife 
are dwindling. The three remaining concentra- 
tions of wild creatures in the sea are now being 
taken to produce protein concentrate: pelagic 
squid, large swarms of krill, and the deep, verti- 
cally migrating midwater communities of small 
creatures generally known as the “deep scatte- 
ring layer.” 
And yet crustacea, like certain squid, are 
linchpins in complex ecosystems. In effect, they 
are the energy “middlemen,” concentrating and 
converting plant energy into something palatable 
and usable by hordes of other creatures. An 
example of the importance of a single crustacean 
species is the Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, a 
translucent pinkish-red finger-long creature 
equipped with enormous black eyes and the 
wonderful ability to emit an eerie blue-green ver- 
sion of bioluminescence. T he billions of its kind 
make up an essential part of the living web that 
prospers in the Southern Ocean ecosystem. Krill 
swarms are consumed by penguins, terns, gulls, 
seals, sea lions, squid, fish, and several species of 
whales whose existence depends on enormous 
quantities of them. 
So vital is this one species to the entire 
Antarctic realm that it would make sense to 
ensure that nothing disturbs its continued 
prosperity. Instead, several nations annually

remove thousands of tonnes of the creatures 
before shipping them off for conversion into 
high-protein food for poultry, cattle and direct 
human consumption. 
Besides predation, many other factors 
undermine the abundance and diversity of 
marine life. It is obvious that shoreline deve- 
lopment, construction of marinas, seawalls and 
jetties, cutting mangroves and filling in 
marshes, coupled with the impact of rivers bea- 
ring heavy loads of excess fertilizers, biocides, 
and sediment, have taken a toll. 
How can we be sure of the impact on ocean 
wildlife? Despite the swift and unprecedented 
insights into the nature of the sea yielded by tech- 
nology, most of the ocean remains unknown and 
unexplored, even within the depths that divers 
can conveniently travel—from the surface to fifty 
metres down. T he maximum ocean depth, eleven 
kilometres, has been attained only once, in 1960, 
when two men peered for half an hour through 
the small porthole of the bathyscaphe Trieste. 
Recent additional glimpses have been supplied 
by cameras lowered on the tethered Japanese 
robot, Kaiko, but these great depths—Ilike 95 per 
cent of the rest of the sea—have yet to be really 
seen by humankind. 
worry or care about creatures we have never met. 
As troubling as the problems are relating to 
obvious habitat destruction and predation, the 
greatest cause for concern must certainly be 
ignorance. Some shrug and say, “What’s the pro- 
blem? Humankind appears to be doing pretty 
well. Look at the numbers.” After all, it took all of 
the time from the dawn of civilization to the year 
1800 before our population barely reached a bil- 
lion. Less than a century and a half later that 
number had doubled, and now, at nearly six bil- 
lion, world population continues to climb. And 
yet our own future may be in jeopardy. 
There are no easy answers to the question of 
what must be done, but there is hope that a signi- 
ficant “hedge” against the unknowns is coming 
into focus with the establishment of a growing 
number of marine sanctuaries in coastal areas— 
places comparable to national parks, wilderness 
areas and nature reserves on the land. More than 
1,200 marine protected areas have been designa- 
ted by various nations. While “protection” is far 
from complete (commercial and sport-fishing 
continue in most) and the total area is still small 
(a fraction of one per cent of the ocean as a 
whole), the actions taken thus far may reflect the 
beginning of a new trend that will lead to finding 
harmony—or at least an enduring place—within 
the natural systems that sustain us. 
The ultimate question is,“what does all this 
mean to us, to our future?’ Can we use our 
awesome power to use—not use up—the natu- 
ral systems that support us? Can we overcome 
the greatest threat to the oceans and thus to 
our future—ignorance? There are many unk- 
nowns, but this much is certain: we have the 
power to undermine the healthy functioning of 
the sea that supports all life on Earth—but no 
sure way to heal the harm. For ages, the sea has 
taken care of us. The time has come for us to 
take care of the sea. EN

### 112500: Research: the state of the art

Research: 
the state of the art 
Oceanographic research is unlocking the sea’s mysteries. 
But only the wealthy can afford it. 
14 A: I know is that I know nothing”. As 
they take stock of current knowledge 
of our “small blue planet”, many 
modern oceanographers could well echo this 
humble admission attributed to Socrates. 
Although we are starting to become aware of the 
oceans’ extraordinary influence on the earth’s 
ecosystem,research is still in its early stages and 
so much remains to be discovered that it will take 
time to fully unlock the mysteries of the sea. 
Two decades ago the ocean was thought of 
as a cornucopia of mineral wealth. But while 
considerable efforts are still being deployed to 
explore these riches in order to offset the inevi- 
table depletion of terrestrial mineral resources, 
many disappointments have combined with the 
high cost of tapping these marine resources to 
dampen the high hopes that once prevailed. 
However, the threats looming over the clima- 
te have spurred scientists to study the oceans’ 
role as a climatic regulator. Since the early 
1990s, research has focused on the still poorly 
understood field of oceanic circulation,especial- 
ly in the ocean depths, and the ways in which the 
various levels of the oceans intercommunicate. 
The havoc wreaked by El Nifio has something to 
do with these concerns, but the broader aim is to 
extend the current horizon of climate prediction 
to some thirty years, which might help to pre- 
vent certain widely predicted catastrophes. 
Scientists say that oceanic circulation is 
important on several counts, not least of which is 
to help us understand how fish—and pollution— 
travel. Awareness of future threats has also given 
fresh impetus to the study of coastal ecosystems. 
Researchers are trying to find out more about 
how they function, and to develop resource 
extraction and management methods which are 
less destructive to these resource-rich areas. 
Geological research over the past 30 years has 
revolutionized our understanding of continental 
drift and plate tectonics and opened up a whole 
new realm of study with the discovery of new bio- 
logical and biochemical systems along the planet’s 
active faults (see page 29). The scope of marine 
research is enormous, ranging from the impact of 
iron on biochemical reactions in the marine envi- 
ronment to ways of influencing the oceans’ capa- 
city to absorb CO, and is set to expand. 
But oceanographic research is very expensi- 
2 6 THE UNESCO COURIER 
ve, and only the richest countries can afford it. 
The United States, Japan, France, the United 
Kingdom, Germany, Canada and Russia lead 
the field, although a number of major southern 
nations, such as India, China and Brazil, are on 
the verge of joining them. To take one example, 
France’s Research Institute for the Exploitation 
of the Sea (Ifremer) employs 1,200 people on 
some thirty sites and has a $160-million annual 
budget. Research in general is mainly funded by 
governments, especially since the military 
authorities are interested in using the ocean 
depths as a testing ground for naval warfare. T he 
private sector usually focuses on areas of econo- 
mic interest, such as geology in the case of oil 
companies and research on fish stocks in the 
case of the fishing industry. But the small coun- 
tries are still not players, even if they have a sea- 
board of their own. [|

### 112501: On course for co-operation

Oncourse 
for co-operation 
Set up by UNESCO in 1960, the Inter- 
governmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) 
is the only United Nations body with responsibility for 
basic oceanographic research. Its mission is to coordi - 
nate international research programmes aimed at 
improving ocean management and to advise its 125 
Member States. The Global Ocean Observing System 
(GOOS) and the Tsunami Warning System in the Pacific 
are two notable IOC endeavours. GOOS set up after 
the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, is the super- 
watchdog of the seas. Using information collected by 
thousands of coastal satellite stations, planes, drifting 
buoys and ocean research vessels, it seeks to unders- 
tand and predict trends in the marine environment. 
The purpose of the Tsunami Warning System in the 
Pacific is to avoid tragedy by forecasting tsunamis, 
giant seismic sea waves which took 2,000 lives and 
wreaked a billion dollars in damage between 1992 
and 1996.

Nuwor most people their greatest involvement 
swith the sea is when they stand on a beach 
N and look out to the horizon only a few kilo- 
metres away. Yet,below the surface and beyond the 
horizon is a hidden deep ocean that influences 
the lives of everyone on Earth. Arguably the most 
important influence of the oceans is the role that 
they share with the atmosphere, biosphere and 
cryosphere in determining the Earth’s climate. 
Scientific exploration of the oceans started 
only 125 years ago with the global circumnavi- 
gation by the British admiralty vessel HM S 
Challenger. That and subsequent expeditions 
mapped the oceans’ depths and water proper- 
ties (temperature and salinity) so that by the 
mid-twentieth century we had developed a 
general, if imperfect, understanding of the 
ocean’s physical processes. 
Today, scientists are in the middle of a 
major project—historically even more impor- 
tant than the work of the Challenger. It is called 
the World Ocean Circulation Experiment 
(WOCE) and is part of the the World Climate 
Research Programme. The project is charting 
the complex ocean currents using modern 
research vessels, buoys and robot instruments 
to collect very precise measurements. Satellites 
are observing sea surface temperature, winds, 
waves, tides and the changes in the sea surface 
slopes caused by currents. By using some of the 
world’s largest computers to analyse this data, 
we are beginning to reveal the ocean as clima-

te’s hidden engine. We are about to enter a new 
age of ocean exploration. 
To understand in the simplest terms the key 
role of the ocean, think of it as an enormous 
reservoir for the sun’s heat. The oceans have an 
extraordinary capacity to store and move heat. 
In fact, the heat needed to warm the top three 
metres of the ocean by one degree Celsius 
would warm the entire atmosphere by the same 
amount. This enables the ocean to save the 
excess heat of summer and then slowly release 
it during the next winter. We clearly see the 
effect this has by comparing the temperature 
differences between winter and summer on an 
island and in the middle of a continent at the 
same latitude. For example, the Azores and 
Kansas City are both close to 40°N and yet the 
temperature ranges are 7° and 29° C respecti- 
vely. 
This storage capacity is just one part of the 
climate equation. Ocean currents also carry 
heat around the world. The Gulf Stream and its 
branches, for example, bring heat from Florida 
towards Ireland and onwards to the Arctic, lea- 
ving northwestern Europe about 10° C warmer 
than Labrador, which sits at the same latitude. 
In simple terms, the ocean’s surface current 
system carries heat from the equator towards 
the poles, the water returning in cold deep cur- 
rents. Scientists on the Challenger saw evidence 
of this when they measured surface equatorial 
water of almost 30° C, while at the bottom tem- 
peratures were near 0° C. 
The heat transport is enormous too—the 
North Atlantic, for example, is carrying heat 
polewards at the rate of 1,000 million mega- 
watts (equivalent to fifty times the global popu-

### 112502: Climate's hidden engine

warm and cold currents is referred to as the 
thermohaline circulation. The Atlantic branch 
is in some ways the key to the global system. A 
round-trip on the thermohaline “conveyor 
belt” can take a thousand years. 
The thermohaline circulation is driven 
partly by the winds and the earth’s rotation and 
partly by the conversion of surface water to 
cold, deep dense water at high latitudes. Its 
name, thermo (heat), haline (salt), gives a clue 
as to how it works. The salt prevents water free- 
zing when heat is lost to the atmosphere in the 
polar winters, and so dense water (below 0° C) 
sinks to the seabed in small, intense ‘“chim- 
neys” and feeds deep, narrow currents threa- 
ding their way equatorward along the ocean 
floor. This water slowly mixes with warmer 
water above it and thus completes the 
“conveyor belt”. 
By mapping these circulation routes, scien- 
tists are on the threshold of understanding the 
oceans’ role in climate and its variability. The 
present El Nifio event is a wonderful example 
of why this is important. When an El Nifio 
occurs, warm water usually held in the western 
equatorial Pacific by the prevailing winds 
migrates eastwards towards South America. 
This causes weather changes both locally and 
around the world. Thanks to an observational 
network of Pacific buoys and computer 
models, we were able to predict in early 1997 
that an El Nifo was starting. However, we 
could not precisely forecast the severity of the 
impacts on weather patterns around the globe. 
We still cannot be sure which of the many ano- 
malous events in 1997 were attributable to El 
Nifio, but past experience suggests that many 
were. 
As we learn more about climate we start to 
see other patterns emerging. The difference 
between atmospheric pressures measured in 
the Azores and in Iceland is a measure of the 
strength of westerly winds over the Atlantic. 
This North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index 
can be linked to colder and warmer winters in 
Europe as the winds bring heat from the ocean 
to the land. This helps to explain the unusually 
mild European winters of the early 1990s. In 
contrast, the bitter cold and snow of the 1940s 
which led to Hitler’s botched assault on 
Moscow were linked to extremely low N AOs. 
Clearly, the ocean holds a key to more pre- 
cise and longer-range weather predictions. 
With advanced warning, farmers could plant 
drought-resistant crops if need be. An early 
forecast of unusually high temperatures or wet 
conditions might enable doctors to prevent the 
onslaught of tropical diseases. 
Predicting climate is a harder problem.The 
uncertainty surrounding global warming and 
the impact of greenhouse gas emissions has 
2 8 THE UNESCO COURIER 
given a new impetus to ocean research. WOCE 
has involved scientists from thirty countries 
making obser vations over the past eight years. 
That experiment’s findings and our knowledge 
of El Nino will be built on by a new project on 
Climate Variability and Predictability (CLI- 
VAR) to model all aspects of the climate from 
the seasonal/interannual monsoons to long 
term (decades to centuries) climate variability 
and the possible influences that humanity may 
have. 
We have much to learn about the effects of 
global warming on the seas. The list of 
concerns is endless. Rising sea temperatures 
affect everything from sea level rise to availabi- 
lity of fish stocks. Some computer models sug- 
gest it could also trigger a breakdown of the 
Atlantic component of the “thermohaline 
conveyor belt”, which might create at least a 
temporary end to Europe’s relatively mild cli- 
mate. 
Finally, global warming might also affect 
the ocean’s capacity to absorb carbon dioxide 
(one of the most problematic greenhouse 
gases). The seas currently draw about two bil- 
lion tonnes of CO out of the atmosphere each 
year. (To put this in context, human activities 
release about seven billion tonnes each year). 
However, rising temperatures limit the sea- 
water’s physical capacity to absorb CO,. Can 
we afford to take even more risks and neglect 
the oceans? [|

could be sustained in an environment as scarce 
in food as the deep sea. Bacteria, both free-living 
and symbiotic within host animal tissues, are the 
key. Animals at deep-sea hot springs are sustai- 
ned by microscopic bacteria that grow on simple 
chemicals dissolved in the venting fluids. 
Discovery of seafloor hydrothermal vents and 
their attendant communities stands out as a 
spectacular example of how poorly we have 
known our ocean. Scientists working in the soft- 
sediments of the bathyal deep sea tell another 
cautionary tale worthy of recollection should we 
ever become too sanguine about our knowledge 
of marine biodiversity. Working with sieves, 
microscopes and tremendous patience,biologists 
have identified nearly a thousand species of 
worms, snails, and crustaceans in a small volume 
of cold mud from deep waters off the east coast 
of North America. Our deep seas are repositories 
of biodiversity, with some estimates of the total 
number of global deep-sea species reaching into 
the millions, rivaling the celebrated diversity of 
tropical rain forests. Virtually nothing is known 
about their biology, their role in the ecosystem or 
their potential useful attributes. 
Dwindling diversity 
Deep-sea work requires high-tech tools for 
access, but anyone with an old pair of canvas 
shoes can explore the intertidal zone of coastal 
wetlands and beaches. Marine plants thrive in 
these sunlit waters: red, brown and green algae 
create three-dimensional forests within which 
live incredible numbers of molluscs, crustaceans 
and worms. There are rich and diverse littoral 
habitats: rocky shores and sandy beaches, man- 
grove swamps and salt marshes, coral reefs and 
mud flats, shallow lagoons and deeper bays. 
These are the habitats patently at risk from a 
plethora of anthropogenic effects including pol- 
lution, development, over-fishing, trawling, and 
global warming. As coastal habitats are compro- 
mised or disappear altogether, whole suites of 
species disappear as well. 
Not long ago I read about the dwindling 
populations of horseshoe crabs that gather 
ritually on beaches at full moon on a spring tide 
in June to mate and lay eggs. I used to haunt the 
beaches where horseshoe crabs landed, always 
astounded by their fantastic numbers. These 
animals are relicts of the Mesozoic, a time when 
dinosaurs ruled the earth, but their long history 
never prepared them for the demanding econo- 
mics of catfood and fertilizer production in this 
modern world. Two decades ago they were 
uncountable. Are they to go the way of the pas- 
senger pigeon, slaughtered to extinction in the 
nineteenth century? 
For a variety of reasons, healthy marine habi- 
tats do not necessarily support high numbers of

Endangered coral reefs 
Snorkel in sunny, warm tropical waters over the vibrant rainbows of coral heads and reef fishes 
and your head goes dizzy with the magic of diversity. Over 90,000 species living in coral 
reefs have been described,and the total number is at least one million. Why is the figure so 
high? The microtopography of a growing reef is complex, creating abundant surfaces for 
attachment and hiding places to accommodate small invertebrates and habitats for fish. 
Reefs are typically insular oceanic habitats. One can envision an always expanding species 
pool as a reef is successfully invaded by the chance arrival of drifting larvae of a species 
from some remote location. The invader, isolated from its parent population, gradually adjusts 
to its new environment and developsinto a daughter species. Where there was once one spe- 
cies, now there are two. Each one has some likelihood of invading other reefs and in such a 
way diversity of coral reefs blossoms exponentially over geologic time. 
This diversity is now threatened by the flash of dynamite of the myopic fisherman who 
destroys the habitat that sustains the resource he seeks to gather. Coral reefs are victims of 
many other unsound practices, with the result that as much as 10 per cent of them have 
already been degraded beyond recovery. If unchecked, loss of coral reef habitat will pro- 
gress at a rate of 10 per cent per decade. Global warming is a particularly insidious danger. 
Corals lose their algal symbionts when the seawater temperature rises just a degree or two 
above normal, a phenomenon known as bleaching, which often resultsin death of the coral. 
Disease hits harder when corals are stressed by warmer than usual temperatures. A sick 
coral reef is dizzying only in the staggering loss of biodiversity. 
species, and biodiversity per se may not always 
be paramount. Rather, as in terrestrial habitats, 
it is loss of diversity that generates concern. 
Because some marine habitats may naturally 
have relatively low diversity but a high abundan- 
ce of animals, loss of a single species can greatly 
modify the ecology of a system. A case in point 
is Chesapeake Bay, the largest tidal estuary on 
the east coast of the United States. Oyster reefs 
once dominated the Chesapeake’s shallow 
waters. These animals feed by filtering seawater, 
and not so long ago the equivalent of the entire 
volume of water in the Bay was filtered within a 
week. Oyster populations have declined due to 
exploitation and disease and what took one week 
to filter now takes one year. T he effect cascades 
through the water column as the particulate load 
increases, light penetration decreases, and a host 
of other consequences transpire. 
In terrestrial ecosystems, loss of charismatic 
mammals or the last remnants of virgin forest 
results in a dramatic visual sensation as well as a 
numerical debit on the tally of species or habi- 
tats. Loss of marine diversity takes place out-of- 
sight, invisible beneath the waves, yet the toll on 
the planetary legacy we leave to our children is 
the same. Worse, remediation of habitat damage 
or restoration where habitat has been lost is a 
difficult task at best in shallow waters and all but 
inconceivable in deep waters of bathyal and 
abyssal environments. [|

### 112504: Anyone for algae?

Japanese women prepare recently

Seaweed-or algae—is everywhere in our food 
Nowadays. Chunks of it float around in 
N\MKorean soups, paper-thin sheets of it are 
wrapped around Japanese rice balls, and it lies 
hidden in the alginates and carrageenans in ham- 
burgers, yoghurt and strawberry ice cream.“ Sea- 
weed -based food additives are now so commonly 
used in prepared and fast food that virtually eve- 
rybody in Europe and North America eats some 
processed seaweed every day,” says Michael Guiry 
of the National University of Ireland, where 
marine algae are also used as a fertilizer and food 
supplement for livestock. In other parts of the 
world, especially the Far East and the Pacific, 
seaweed is a traditional part of the staple diet.

There are three categories of seaweed: red

brown (1,000 species). Red seaweeds are the 
most numerous, green the most widespread 
and brown the largest. Some species of kelp off 
the Californian coast can grow to be 50 metres 
long, in “forests” that are just as vast and com- 
plex as those on land. Every year 140,000 
tonnes of kelp are harvested for the extraction 
of food additives. Most of the edible green and 
red seaweeds are eaten unprocessed.

rich in vitamins, mineral salts and oligo-ele- 
ments that they deserve to be called “the vege- 
tables of the sea”. Wakame, for example, has a 
very high calcium content,and nori contains 50 
per cent more vitamin C than oranges. 
In some parts of Asia, seaweed provides the 
poor with good, cheap nutrition, and in the 
rich countries it helps people lose weight. “It 
seems that Westerners, unlike Asians, are 
unable to assimilate seaweed,and that’s why we 
consider it to be a low calorie food,” says Guiry. 
The total seaweed market is worth over $5 bil- 
lion, with food additives alone accounting for 
$600 million. Kazutosi Nisizawa, former 
President of the Japanese Phycological Society, 
says “the world’s total yearly harvest is 8.4 mil- 
lion tonnes of green seaweed, 2.8 million 
tonnes of brown seaweed and 1.2 million 
tonnes of red seaweed.” China is the leader, 
producing 3.5 million tonnes of kombu yearly— 
the world’s biggest harvest. This is even more 
impressive when we know that from the fifth 
century on China imported dried seaweed 
from Japan, until it began to farm its own in the 
1950s, growing the plants on long ropes stret- 
ched under the water. The Chinese now hold 
the title of the world’s biggest seaweed consu- 
mers. 
Meanwhile, the Japanese harvest of nori is 
the world’s biggest in value, worth a total of 
almost $1.3 billion. The Japanese seaweed 
industry employs some 35,000 people. Japan is 
also the world’s leading seaweed exporter, rin- 
ging up sales of $170 million in 1995, accor- 
ding to FAO. Seaweed, of course, is a historic 
staple of the Japanese diet. “The Japanese cur- 
rently eat some twenty different species, and 
they have been using six of them since as far 
back as the eighth century,” reports Guiry. 
“Seaweed accounts for about 10 per cent of the 
modern Japanese diet.” Even the Japanese gods 
love seaweed, it seems. “In a book dating back 
to 701,” recounts Nisizawa, “it 1s written that 
several varieties of edible seaweed were used as 
offerings in the temples.” Even today, there are 
towns in Japan where the meal served at the 
betrothal ceremony must include Laminaria, 
which is believed to bring good luck and hap- 
piness. In many countries, seaweed has long 
been part of the traditional pharmacopeia, and 
scientists today hope to see it as an ingredient 
of tomorrow’s medicines. Researchers are cur- 
rently trying to isolate substances in seaweed 
which could be used to treat high blood pres- 
sure, cholesterol, cancerous tumours and other 
ailments. u

They walk on the water, beating the waves with a“ corvo” , a 10-metre-long pole. They scrape 
the rocks with iron knives, then stop to pick up brownish, slippery, floppy things which they 
pile in heaps, before returning to the water, scraping and bending again. For several generations, 
the seaweed gatherers have been lords and masters of a place which belongsto no one. They 
are regarded as demi-gods, and it is said that when they ride their horses down the streets, 
orwalk with their arms laden with rolls of dry seaweed,it means that bad weather ison the 
way. 
On these windswept shores, they gather seaweed in the traditional way, from spring to 
autumn, just as the Mapuche Indians did 200 years ago. Near Temuco and Chiloé,in the cen- 
tral regions of Chile and in the very heart of Araucana,they gather “cochayuyo” and “luche” 
(Durvillaea antarctica and Porphyra),with which they make bread and cakes, or cook with mut- 
ton. Further south, near Puerto Montt, they have for over twenty years been gathering “luga 
roja carrajinado”, “luga cuchara” (Mazzaela or Iridaea) and “ pelillo” (Gracilaria),using diving 
suits and breathing tubes which enable them to work underwater for long periods without 
oxygen tanks. 
When the work is done, the beaches are spread with red and brown seaweed which is 
flattened out and left to dry in the sun. The gatherers and their families later carry it away in 
rolls or bundles weighing between 40 
and 60 kilos, which they sell for a pit- 
tance to merchants and dealers. he ~~ T he traditional w ay of 
gathering sea weed is 
tending to disappear just 
as sea weed’s economic 
importance is growing. 
following day, the gatherer will be back 
on his rock jutting out of the water, 
“corvo” in hand to prod the waves 
However, this traditional way of 
gathering seaweed is tending to disap- 
pear, just as seaweed’s economic 
importance isgrowing. It isnot only used unprocessed as food but also to make algina, agar- 
agar and carrageenan,substances which are used in the food,pharmaceutical and cosme- 
tics industries, and to solidify cultivation media in bacteriology. The seaweed gatherers are 
gradually becoming professional farmers. 
Seaweed gathering began in Chile in the 1950s, and during the present decade is yiel- 
ding 160,000 tonnes of biomass per year, almost 5 per cent of total world production. Theindus- 
try employs some 12,000 families. 
In 1983 over-farming depleted the natural underwater“ meadows” of pelillo, the raw mate- 
rial for the production of agar, as a result of which scientists, entrepreneurs and seaw eed gathe- 
ring co-operatives got together to replant the shoreline. Of the 1,200 meadows currently under 
concession, 342 are active farming centres, operated along the northern shore by big com- 
paniesand in the South by co-operatives of traditional gatherers. Eighty-two per cent of the 
current pelillo crop is transformed by Chilean factories into agar for export to the United 
States, Japan, Sngapore and Thailand. The remaining 18 per cent of the seaweed isdried and 
exported,mainly to Japan. Total earings from Chile’s seaweed exports are about $50 mil- 
lion. 
Pelillo farming has helped to stabilize production and reduce pressure on natural mea- 
dows; at the same time, it ensures a constant supply of raw material to the Chilean agar indus- 
try. Currently, 75 per cent of Chiles total seaweed crop is being transformed into a high 
added value product. The same results are expected in the short term for the red seaweed used 
to produce carrageenan.

Nhe world’s oceans could provide a limitless 
source of energy, according to Indian che-

mist Madanjeet Singh, an international 
authority on the subject. But exploiting ocean 
energy is no simple matter, if only because the 
possibilities of doing so differ from region to 
region.Experiments have been carried out with 
tidal and wave power and with ocean thermal 
energy. Few applications of these technologies 
are currently in use, but their number could 
increase in the coming centuries—if they attract 
investment on a massive scale. 
Ocean tides constitute a clean and inex- 
haustible energy source, free from the climatic 
irregularities which are a constraint on wind 
and solar power. But places suitable for exploi- 
ting them are few and far between, for if a tidal 
power plant is to operate efficiently certain 
conditions must be met. A river estuary where 
the difference between high and low tide is at 
least five metres is necessary. It must be pos- 
sible to construct a dam, and there must be a 
nearby source of electricity supply to make up 
for the intermittence of power production lin- 
ked to the times of high and low tides.

estuary of the river Rance, in western France, 
where the difference between high and low 
tides averages 8.17 metres, peaking at 13.5 
metres during the equinoxes. The world’s first 
tidal power plant began operating there in 
1966. It is still the biggest, with a capacity of 
240 megawatts (MW). 
Tidal power plants consist of a high-capaci- 
ty dam built across an estuary to hold back the 
water at high tide. At low tide sluice gates in the 
dam are opened to release a cascade of water 
that drives a turbine to generate electricity. 
In China, says Singh, “eight plants with a 
total capacity of 6,210 kilowatts exploit tidal 
energy.” There is a 20MW plant at Annapolis in 
Canada. But although many other suitable sites 
exist, construction costs are considered too 
high, especially as hydroelectric power is plen- 
tiful and cheaper. Tidal power plants are plan- 
ned on Russia’s White Sea and on the Severn 
and Mersey estuaries in the United Kingdom. 
Putting the waves to work 
In 1945, Japan became the first country to 
consider using sea waves as an energy source, 
followed by Norway and the UK. The first 
power plant to use wave power, OSPREY 
(Ocean Swell Powered Renewable Energy), 
began operating in northern Scotland at the 
beginning of August 1995. A 2MW facility, 
OSPREY was designed along the following 
lines: waves entering a kind of submerged 
chamber open at the base pushed air into tur- 
bines to generate electricity sent via an under- 
water cable to the shore about 300 metres 
away. Unfortunately, the plant was damaged by 
the waves and then destroyed by a storm.The 
engineers who designed it did not give up, 
however, and a cheaper and more efficient ver- 
sion is being developed to supply small islands 
with much-needed electricity and to power a 
seawater desalinization plant. 
Quite different technology is needed to turn 
the sea’s thermal energy into electricity. The 
sea’s surface temperature in the tropics ranges 
from 27 to 31°C all the year round and that of 
deep water ranges from 6°C at a depth of 1,000 
metres to almost 0°C at 4,000 metres. This 
temperature difference can be used to power a 
motor based on the same principle as that of 
the heat pump. A liquid is turned into gas in an 
evaporator, and then drives a turbine which 
generates electricity, before passing through a 
condenser, where it is turned back into liquid. 
The snag is that the process requires huge 
turbines. The first practical application of this 
method was by the French engineer Georges 
Claude, who in 1930 loaded pipes and turbines 
34 THE UNESCO COURIER 
onto a ship off the coast of Cuba. American 
engineers are working on the idea of siting floa- 
ting power plants off the southern coast of the 
U.S. and one facility has been operating in 
Hawaii since 1981. Such plants could supply 
floating cities of the future with electricity, air- 
conditioning and fresh water, while the unpol- 
luted,nutrient-rich cold water brought up from 
the depths could be used to breed fish and 
shellfish and grow edible seaweed. 
But according to Scottish engineer S. H. 
Salter, the most promising device is a “tapering 
channel”, invented by a Norwegian, Even 
Mehlum.As Singh describes it,“The waves are 
funnelled into a tapered natural or artificial 
channel. The water level rises and the water 
eventually spills into an elevated reservoir 
behind the narrow end of the channel. The 
water then flows back to the sea through a tur- 
bine, generating electricity in the process.” This 
reliable, low-cost system is already operating in 
Norway and Java. 
Salter believes that if we use our imagina- 
tion we will find an endless variety of ways of 
harnessing the sea’s energy. One of them would 
be to use the difference between sea levels. In 
Egypt, water running through an underground 
canal linking the Mediterranean to the ElI- 
Qattara depression could be used to generate 
electricity. In Israel, the same principle could 
be used in a canal between the Mediterranean 
and the Dead Sea which would gradually des- 
cend 400 metres, although the estimated bil- 
lion-dollar price tag is a deterrent. 
Mr. Singh concludes that “clean energy 
from the sea will be especially popular when 
the price of oil is no longer governed by econo- 
mics but by environmental costs. Cutting car- 
bon dioxide emissions will help save the pla- 
net.” [|

### 112506: Offshore mineral resources

When the ninth year had

And the summer tenth was

Raw minerals are found in deposits which have accumula- 
ted and concentrated over tens or hundreds of million of 
years. Mineral extraction on land has not always been suf- 
ficient to satisfy world demand, and so researchers and 
industrialists have turned to the sea and the seabed,a rich 
and promising but still little-known world. 
Minerals under the sea come in several forms: 
© Loose deposits come from three sources. Some are 
detrital like sand or gravel, or consist of “ placer” deposits 
containing tin, titanium, gold, rare earths, zirconium and 
diamonds. Others are of biological origin,such as shells of 
marine creatures which have turned into sand. A third 
category originates from elements suspended in water, 
yielding chemical deposits which produce, for example, 
barytes or metal-rich sediments. 
N Rock deposits, which are the undersea extension of 
seams of coal, tin, iron and other minerals. 
8 Deposits dissolved in sea water, such as sodium chlori- 
de, magnesium and iodine. 
Offshore mineral extraction has grown to the point 
that it now involves, or soon will, almost two-thirds of the 
103 chemical elements identified in 1869 by the Russian 
chemist Mendeleyev. Mineral sands, also known as beach 
sand, come from the bedrock of continents worn away by 
the weather and the passage of the seasons, especially in 
tropical latitudes. The minerals are freed and carried away 
by rivers, first to beaches and then to the seabed of the 
continental shelf. 
Extracting these minerals is important because they 
have become indispensable to modern technology, which 
depends heavily on titanium, zirconium and rare earths 
(which include nine heavy minerals— radioactive thorium, 
and eight lighter ones). Titanium, considered a strategic 
metal, provides a white colouring for paper and plastic, and 
plays an important role in the aeronautical industry and in 
manufacturing golf clubs and tennis rackets. Zirconium’s 
refractory qualities make it useful in the thrust nozzles of jet 
aircraft. Rare earths, which contain quartz or rutile (titanium 
dioxide), supply state-of-the-art technologies such as the 
red colour in television pictures or the catalysis of engine 
exhaust gases. Rutile has an amazing resistance. It does not 
wear out and cannot be corroded by other chemicals. But 
deposits of it are scarce and unevenly distributed. The big- 
gest are in Australia, Madagascar, Cameroon, Ghana and 
Serra Leone. 
Beach sand is mined using huge, super-powerful 
dredges which can scoop up as much as 2,500 tonnes an 
hour. Between 90 and 98 per cent of the dredged material 
is waste which, after the minerals have been separated out 
by gravity, is put back where it came from. The most 
conscientious mining companies try to leave the landscape 
asthey found it. They set aside topsoil, and later replace, fer- 
tilize and replant it.

### 112507: From fish scales...to sunken treasures

The memory of the sea 
From fish scales... 
The secrets of the planet’s past lie hidden in the ocean depths. 
Palaeoecologists like Tim Baumgartner sift through kilos of mud to 
uncover the clues. 
HB What is palaeoecology? 
Palaeoecology looks to the past—using the 
remains of plants and animals—to reconstruct 
ecosystem behaviour and see how these sys- 
tems respond to climate change. This work is 
done by a wide range of specialists, each with 
his or her own particular interest, or fetish you 
might say. Some study tree-rings, ice cores 
from polar and mountain glaciers, even the his- 
tory of forest fires. 
The ocean is a particularly rich source of 
information. Scientists look to yearly bands of 
coral growth, for example, to reconstruct histo- 
ries of El Nifio over the past several centuries. 
My fetish is fish scales deposited in ocean sedi- 
ments. 
HB What can the ocean tell us that a glacier 
cannot? 
Ice-cores are wonderful sources of climate 
history but they cannot tell us how an ecosys- 
tem responds to those conditions. Ocean sedi- 
ments provide imperfect pictures that have to 
be reassembled, like jig-saw puzzles. They help 
us begin to disentangle and understand the 
interaction between natural variability in the 
ecosystem and human intervention. T he trick is 
learning to read the language of these natural 
archives. 
I work with a team (through Scripps 
Institute in the U.S. and Mexico’s Centro de 
Investigacién Cientifica y Educacién Superior 
de Ensefiada) to recover and analyse sediments 
from a few rare sites. In one of the best sites— 
the Santa Barbara Basin off the southern 
California coast of the United States—three 
metres of mud give us almost 2,000 years of 
history. We first X-ray the mud to reveal the 
annual layers. We can then count the fish scales 
to reconstruct changes in population sizes of 
fish like sardines and anchovies. Then we work 
out the background clues. Tiny one-celled ani- 
mals called Foraminifera, for example, capture 
the history of the water in their calcium carbo- 
nate shells. By analysing their remains, we learn 
about the temperature and salinity of the water 
at the time the shell was secreted, helping us 
trace ocean circulation in the past. 
3 6 THE UNESCO COURIER 
Bl But isn’t 2,000 years of history just a drop in 
the bucket in terms of natural history? 
That’s true if we look back over the whole 
panorama of earth history. But the past 2,000 
years is a critical period for considering the 
effects of fishing or greenhouse gas emissions. 
What sets our fish scale history apart is the high 
resolution. This is like the number of volumes 
in a collection of history books. Our work offers 
five-year “chapters” with the option of looking 
every two years. In contrast, much of earth his- 
tory has a far lower resolution because the 
measurements used give averages over hun- 
dreds to thousands of years. 
The fish scale record has played an impor- 
tant role in understanding the decline and col- 
lapse of the sardine population off California in 
the 1950s. While this was immediately attributed 
to overfishing, the palaeo-record showed that 
the population has gone through many increases 
and declines over the past 2,000 years. This evi- 
dence was then used by some to argue that the 
modern decline was a purely natural phenome- 
non. A closer look at the fish scale record, howe- 
ver, shows that this decline differs from the pre- 
fishery declines in two ways. First, it culminated 
in a collapse instead of an expected four to five- 
fold reduction in population size. Secondly, the 
population took at least thirty years longer to 
recover than if there had been no overfishing. 
HB What else have you discovered? 
Something completely unexpected—from 
the shells of a tiny snail floating in the upper 100 
metres of the ocean. The shells captured the 
water age at the time they were secreted. Water 
age is measured by radiocarbon (the isotope car- 
bon-14) as the last time the shell was in contact 
with the atmosphere. We expected some boun- 
cing around in these numbers but not the kind 
reported by our collaborators at the Lawrence 
Livermore National Labs in California. During 
the period studied—350 A.D. to 1940—it 
appears that there was a 50 per cent reduction in 
the rate of supply of older radiocarbon from the 
deep ocean to the near-surface ocean off 
California. This is still a mystery, but ultimately,

attraction since 1961. Last but not least there’s 
the wreck of the Titanic. In 1985 televised pic- 
tures of the sunken luxury liner mesmerized 
audiences around the world, 73 years after she 
came to rest on the ocean floor.

it must be related to the circulation of deep and 
intermediate waters in combination with other 
processes. Now remember that the ocean is the 
main reservoir of carbon dioxide, so variations of 
this magnitude are essential to understand. 
Eventually, we also must compare these data 
with data from other sites and go back another 
5,000 to 8,000 years. 
HW What is stopping you? 
First, sites with such high rates of sedimen- 
tation are very rare. They must also be deep 
enough to avoid stirring by waves and currents. 
And the bottom water must be very poor in 
dissolved oxygen so that we don’t have worms 
burrowing into the layers. Between southern 
Chile and western Canada we have identified 
ten possible sites, with another promising area 
off the Namibian coast of Africa. But develo- 
ping these sites is not cheap. A research vessel 
can easily run to $15,000 per day. We also need 
to help scientists in these countries do this 
work. So before we can find more sites, we 
must find more funding. N 
Interview by Amy Otchet 
Many other archaeological discoveries have 
not made front-page news, but provide 
valuable information about the past.The exca- 
vation of a 14th-century-B.C. trading vessel off 
the southern coast of Turkey has helped us 
understand trade in the Mediterranean area 
during the Bronze Age. Lisbon’s National 
Archaeology Museum has listed 850 ships that 
have sunk off the Azores since 1522, their holds 
often laden with precious stones and metals. 
These wrecks shed new light on trade between 
Europe, the New World and the West Indies. 
The sea usually preserves vestiges of the 
past better than the earth, but archaeological 
excavation under water is much more difficult 
than on land. Chance plays a role in finding 
sunken treasures, but it is technology that has 
worked wonders. There is a downside to tech- 
nology, however. Remote-controlled submer- 
sibles and satellites that can scan the ocean 
floor are available only to those who can pay— 
mostly modern-day pirates. 
Many sites coveted by treasure-hunters may 
end up suffering the same fate as the wreck of 
the Dutch-flagged Geldermahlsen that went 
down in the South China Sea in 1752. 
Christie’s, one of the world’s biggest auction 
houses, sold the cargo for $16 million in 1986, 
reaping a handsome profit for the salvager. The 
recovery of the cargo led to the complete des- 
truction of the coral-encrusted wreck 
and its resting place, wiping out a chapter of 
history forever. N

### 112508: Sea fever

Landlubbers all over the world 
thrill to the exploits of intrepid 
solo yacht racers. 
‘ve never sailed this far South. Yachtsmen 
seldom come here, it’s magical. It’s an 
honour to stick my nose down here. This is 
Adventure with a capital A”. Canadian yachts- 
man Gerry Roufs uttered those words before the 
sea swallowed him up during a violent storm bet- 
ween Australia and Cape Horn early last year. 
His death is an awesome reminder of the very 
real dangers incurred by these adventurers,whose 
thrilling exploits grip the public’s imagination. 
Frenchman Christophe Auguin, who won the 
1996-97 Vendée Globe, the dangerous round- 
the-world race via the South Pole that took Roufs’ 
life,is another example of bravery. 
Auguin, Roufs and other weather-beaten 
heroes like them are too modest to cry victory 
over the elements. Florence Arthaud, the first 
woman to win a transatlantic race, is one of the 
grittiest figures in the world of long-distance 
racing. On land she is surrounded by a circle of 
friends, but she loves being alone on the ocean. 
The yachtswoman’s intense relationship with 
the sea led her to give up everything at eigh- 
teen, including medical school and a cozy life 
with her family in Paris’ chic 16th arrondisse- 
ment. Arthaud, who has been nicknamed “the 
sweetheart of the Atlantic”, says she was drawn 
to sailing because it brings her back to life’s 
basics: eating, sleeping and surviving. 
Solitude is the recurring theme in the lives of 
all these sea-farers. From England’s 
Transatlantic along the historic route between 
Plymouth and Newport, which made the legen- 
dary French yachtsman Eric Tabarly famous, to 
the Vendée Globe, which does not allow com pe- 
titors to receive any assistance or stop off at 
ports of call, long-distance racing is first and 
foremost a personal challenge. Isabelle Autissier, 
a Frenchwoman from the Paris suburbs and one 
of five sisters, says that sailing “makes me feel 
totally self-sufficient. I do just what I want, when 
I want. Maybe I'm really trying to prove some- 
thing to myself—or to others”. 
Alain Bombard, who voluntarily cast himself 
adrift in an inflatable dinghy in 1952, says one 
of the century’s wildest exploits was Gérard 
d’Aboville’s solo voyage across the Pacific in a 
rowboat. Like a modern-day galley slave, he set 
out from Japan in July 1991, reaching the West 
Coast of the United States in November of the 
same year. D’Aboville, the total solo adventurer, 
fulfilled his wildest dreams and proved to the 
world that willpower can move mountains. 
Although, in his own words, he did not spend “a 
single enjoyable moment” on the lonely cros- 
sing, D’Aboville achieved his goal. “I thought 
for sure crossing the Pacific was impossible, but 
3 8 THE UNESCO COURIER 
  
mulled the idea over in my mind a long time. 
What TI liked about it was reaching my goal. 1 
got a huge thrill out of slowly working my way 
across the world’s biggest ocean, which covers 
half the globe.” 
Dr. Jean Yves Chauve, a long-distance 
racing specialist and the official physician for 
most of the sport’s major events, says that, in 
addition to a love of taking risks and accepting 
challenges, these far-roving adventurers seek a 
very personal kind of “retreat” from the world. 
As he sees it, solo long-distance yachtsmen— 
and women—are eager to discover the unk- 
nown latitudes of their own minds, most likely 
coming home stronger and wiser. 
The experience changes some of them fore- 
ver. Bernard Moitessier, who inspired many 
people to start sailing, never went home from the 
first round-the-world race, the Golden Globe, 
organized by the British in 1969. Although in the 
lead, after sailing past Cape Horn the great sea- 
man decided to set out around the world a 
second time instead of heading for England. He 
didn’t drop anchor until reaching Polynesia. 
“What does it mean to go round the world, since 
the horizon never gets any closer?” he pondered

I do what I want, 
when I want. ’ 
in La Longue Route, a first-hand 
account of his voyage. 
Many will set out in search of 
a world Isabelle Autissier calls 
“the other side”, looking for the 
unusual beauty that Moitessier 
found so stunning in these latitudes. The far 
south of the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific 
oceans—the roaring forties, the screaming fif- 
ties—is a boundless watery wilderness where 
none but a few thrill-seekers would ever dare to 
venture. Cam Lewis, who in 1993 became the 
first yachtsman to sail around the world in less 
than eighty days, wrote in his log book about 
not seeing any land, ship, plane or sign of 
human life for weeks. He described the sense of 
peace that came over him on the open sea and 
what it was like listening to the sound track of 
The Big Blue in stereo as the boat rode the 
crests of the waves in a violent storm, giving 
him just enough time to glimpse the vast 
expanse of ocean before plunging into a trough 
again. 
Yet even when they take all the necessary 
precautions, those who venture out on to the 
open sea risk their lives. Especially since the

high-tech craft they sail today zoom ahead at 
amazing speeds. The corporations that sponsor 
them want to see their investments pay off. 
Speed is the name of the game. A case in point 
was the 1998 Whitbread round-the-world race 
that pitted the best international racers against 
each other. New Zealander Grant Dalton 
wrote in his log book that this way of sailing is 
unsafe, but wondered whether he and his fel- 
low competitors had any choice. If you don’t 
want to finish last, you have to tear ahead at the 
risk of being smashed to bits. 
Advertisers have been quick to seize upon 
the public's fascination with long-distance 
yacht racing as a way of reaching promising 
new markets. The genuine seaman, Dr. Chauve 
says, has the power to make others experience 
adventure vicariously. These races do have a 
strong impact on the collective imagination. A 
million people turned out in the Breton port of 
Saint Malo to watch the start of the Rum 
Route race in 1994. Several hundred thousand 
onlookers welcomed Christophe Auguin on his 
return when he reached the French Atlantic 
port of Les Sables d’Olonne. On a chilly win- 
ter’s day a crowd over 300,000-strong cheered 
on Bruno Peyron and his crew as their catama- 
ran finished a round-the-world voyage in less 
than 80 days. The yachtsman from La Baule 
got some idea of the public’s enthusiasm from 
the thousands of messages that poured in 
during the hair-raising adventure. “I'm thin- 
king of you all every day. It helps me forget the 
metro and the blues,” said one message from 
Paris. A hospital surgeon followed every 
moment, writing “hang in there—we’re kee- 
ping up with you hour by hour. We admire your 
courage and willpower.” A message from the 
French Alps read, “you fellows are doing what 
other people only dream about.” 
In countries other than France, the excite - 
ment of experiencing these adventures vica- 
riously runs even higher. The United Kingdom 
has knighted its greatest yachtsmen. New 
Zealand made eight attempts to win the presti- 
gious America’s Cup before succeeding at last 
in 1995. It was a great triumph for the three 
million New Zealanders, who live in the teeth 
of the wind and the sea all year round, and 
they're counting on a repeat performance when 
Auckland hosts the America’s Cup in 2000. 
But national feelings should not come into play 
here. T he sea has no borders. It is open to every 
dreamer. All it takes is a little humility on the 
part of those setting out and imagination on 
the part of those who stay ashore. As Bernard 
Moitessier wrote about his joy at being before 
the mast, “Wind, sea, boat and sails, a world 
that is both compact and considerable, without 
beginning or end, a part and yet the whole of 
the universe, my private universe, all my own.”

In the rivalry for marine resources, environmental 
concern should not be seen as just another 
competing use of the oceans. 
40 THE UNESCO COURIER 
e tend to view the marine world as an 
infinite food supply, a bottomless pit for 
waste and a “common space” where we 
can play and fight, as and when we please. Howe- 
ver, this is quickly changing as the world meta- 
phorically “shrinks”, as the oceans no longer pre- 
sent the obstacle they once were to travel or 
communications and as we explore their furthest 
depths.We have entered a new era of fierce com- 
petition for marine resources and space. 
Sixteen of the world’s 23 mega-cities (with 
over 2.5 million inhabitants) are on or close to 
the sea. In China about 100 million people 
have moved from land-locked provinces to new 
coastal economic zones since 1990. Coastal 
tourism, fisheries and offshore petroleum 
industries are major sources of revenue for 
many countries, particularly small developing 
island states. 
Despite air travel, the oceans are still the 
great highways for trade, with ships transpor- 
ting 80 per cent of international cargo. Indeed, 
the oceans largely make economic globalization 
possible by offering a cheap means of moving 
commodities around the world. Tens of thou- 
  
wr FH Rca LN a 
sands of vessels are at sea at any one time, all 
needing a shore to dock, load, unload and dis- 
pose of waste. Until recently the oceans were 
the obvious solution for waste disposal in gene- 
ral. Whole industries have been built up around 
dumping domestic sewage, industrial waste, 
decommissioned oil rigs and nuclear waste at 
sea. 
Governments and their military forces, 
multinationals and local industry all have a 
major stake in the marine world. So it is not 
surprising to find increasing conflict between 
and among these actors. Some of the most hea- 
ted disputes have occurred in the fisheries sec- 
tor. As stocks collapse after decades of overfi- 
shing, vessels from different nations are chasing 
the remaining fish in a cut-throat competition 
that has in some cases escalated into violence. 
The North Atlantic “cod wars” between 
Canadian and Spanish trawlers in the early 
1990s have probably attracted the most atten- 
tion. In a heated dispute ten years earlier, a 
Danish vessel deliberately sailed into UK 
waters to catch forbidden fish and face arrest 
by the Royal Navy.

The real culprit in all these clashes is the 
over-capacity of the world’s fishing fleet, which 
grew twice as fast as catches between 1970 and 
1990, largely due to huge government subsi- 
dies. Artisanal fishermen in developing coun- 
tries in West Africa, for example, now find their 
resources plundered by “distant-water” fleets 
from the European Union which pay scant 
regard to the needs of local communities or 
ecosystems. The EU now has a network of 
fishing access agreements with nineteen 
African countries, for which licence fees often 
represent a tiny proportion of the value of the 
catch. Fishing conflicts have even reached the 
World Trade Organization; recently the United 
States tried to exclude tuna and shrimp 
imports from certain countries using catch 
techniques which kill dolphins and sea turtles. 
Perhaps the greatest conflict to be resolved 
is that between human activities 
and healthy seas. The environ- 
mental community and its non- 
governmental organizations 
(NGOs) are often seen as sepa- 
rate “stakeholders”, interested in 
simply preventing anyone from 
using the oceans. They are vie- 
wed as animal “huggers”, espe- 
cially given the attention paid to 
sea turtles or whales. And yet, the major role of 
most NGOs is to develop ways of ensuring the 
long-term health of the planet. 
Environmental concern must cease to be 
seen as a competing “use” of the oceans, and 
be recognized instead as a fundamental com- 
ponent of all marine activities. Aside from a few 
exceptions like military exercises and shipping, 
human activities which depend on the marine 
environment require a healthy ocean. Marine 
parks and reserves, for example, may appear to 
compete with space for resorts and marinas, yet 
they play a vital role in protecting habitats on 
which fisheries depend and tourism is based. 
Most of the issues covered by the media as 
conflicts between opposing camps are really 
about basic questions over access to and sustai- 
nable use of the ocean, from the public outcry 
over French nuclear testing in the South Pacific 
to NGO clashes with multinational oil compa- 
nies such as Shell over oil spills and the dispo- 
sal of rigs on the seabed. A similar “conflict” is 
brewing over developing new submarine fossil

fuel sources, which flies in the face of all that 
we know about climate change. 
In some cases, the damage predicted has 
not materialized or the potential impacts have 
been impossible to prove. But the concerns are 
still valid. We know so little about the oceans 
that it would be foolish to take anything other 
than a precautionary approach. This is clearly 
reflected in the United Nations Law of the Sea 
Convention, although it is important to note 
that work remains to be done because the 
convention ignores a crucial issue of the future: 
genetic resources of the high seas. 
Yet international agreements and regula- 
tions can only go so far. We need to build a 
broad public constituency through initiatives 
like the International Year of the Ocean. The 
momentum is growing. A 1997 poll in the 
USA, for example, found that 55 per cent of 
Americans believe that ocean 
exploration should take prece- 
dence over space exploration. 
At the same time, economic 
dependence on marine resources 
opens the way to creating social 
and economic incentives for their 
sustainable use. Eco-labels on pro- 
ducts and services are starting to 
make a difference to consumers. 
Companies, NGOs and international agencies 
are looking into new ways of certifying fisheries 
management and aquaculture, in particular. 
Moving beyond consumers, we need to shift 
the balance of power between all stakeholders 
so that coastal communities can reassert their 
rights to their marine resources. T his is not just 
a pipe-dream. In the Pacific, authorities are for- 
mally recognizing the traditional structures and 
techniques revived by local communities to 
manage their marine resources. In Mauritania, 
the Imraguen (a fishing community) now have 
exclusive fishing rights in the resource-rich 
Banc d’Arguin Marine Park. 
The time has come to bridge these scattered 
initiatives by reinforcing international and 
regional co-operation. This is not simply a 
question of good intentions but a realistic stra- 
tegy for resolving the myriad of marine 
conflicts. The stakeholders have everything to 
gain in respecting what may well be the world’s 
last wilderness. [|

verything flows in the ocean. It is simply 
impossible to manage ocean uses in isola- 
ion,without recognizing their interaction. 
From fishing to offshore oil development, acti- 
vities interact. What happens in one ocean area is 
likely to affect others, flowing across political 
boundaries or even the world ocean as a whole. 
Hundreds of thousands of pages have been 
written about “integrated coastal manage- 
ment” designed to take all these interactions 
into account. However, one aspect has been 
avoided as far as possible at all the intergovern- 
mental conferences because of its politically 
highly sensitive nature: the interaction between 
military and peaceful uses of the oceans. 
This interaction may be of a specific nature. 
We have seen problems arise from the exemp- 
tion of naval vessels from the environmental 
protection rules of the Law of the Sea 
Convention.Then there are accidents, such as 
collisions involving nuclear naval vessels and 
the loss of nuclear weapons at sea.A number of 
such incidents have occurred. 
The conflict,however,is deeper. And it may 
not be possible to ignore it much longer. The 
management of peaceful ocean uses is too clo- 
sely linked to the control of military uses. This 
general problem is related to an elementary 
fact: without peace and security there can be 
neither economic development nor environ- 
mental conservation. The next inevitable step 
lies in the integration of sustainable develop- 
ment and security. 
This integration could be best pioneered at 
the regional level. While a number of regional 
seas programmes are already in place, the 
Mediterranean offers a unique opportunity. By 
establishing a regional commission on sustai- 
nable development, Mediterranean states have 
moved from a sectoral to a comprehensive 
approach, opening participation to any high- 
level minister involved in ocean affairs. There 
would be no reason to exclude defence minis- 
ters from this commission, whenever an issue 
of regional security conflicts with the peaceful 
uses of the sea and coastal regions. These 
ministers might form a “virtual regional securi- 
ty council” within the commission and promo- 
te naval co-operation for peaceful purposes. 
In the absence of armed conflict, naval 
regional co-operation could extend to joint sur- 
veillance and enforcement of pollution regula- 
tions or fishing agreements. This co-operation 
is already seen in the South Pacific and the 
Eastern Caribbean. 
Naval co-operation should also extend to 
humanitarian activities such as search and 
rescue, disaster relief or hydrological surveys 
and other forms of oceanographic research. In 
institutional terms, this is a simple extension of 
a process already in course. 
Regional seas should be declared, wherever 
possible, nuclear-free zones. This is another 
way of integrating environmental and political 
security while, at the same time, interpreting, 
developing and implementing the new prin- 
ciple, enshrined in the Law of the Sea 
Convention (Article 88), reserving the high 
seas for peaceful purposes. This also includes 
the exclusive economic zones. 
Promising beginnings have been made with 
the Declaration on the Indian Ocean as a Zone 
of Peace and the Antarctic Treaty. The Latin 
American Nuclear-Free Zone (established 
through the Treaty of Tlatelolco) should now 
be extended to the Caribbean. And new zones 
wait to be established within the Baltic, the 
Arctic, the Mediterranean and the Asian Seas. 
Special regional arbitration tribunals could 
make another important contribution by sett- 
ling disputes. Not all regional seas programmes 
will be able to move in this direction at the same 
pace. Power-political constellations may be 
impediments requiring less or more time to 
overcome. But the time has come to put the 
issue on the agenda for the next century. [|

n June 1992, heads of state from eleven coun- 
tries—Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bulga- 
N ria,Georgia,Greece,Moldova,Romania,Rus- 
sia, Turkey and Ukraine—signed a treaty in 
Istanbul setting up the Black Sea Economic Co- 
operation Region.Inconceivable fifteen years ago, 
this initiative is one of the most dramatic changes 
to have taken place in the region since the fall of 
the Berlin wall. Whatever the participants’calcu- 
lations, tactical considerations and ulterior 
motives, the project illustrates their desire to ease 
tensions in the region and establish dialogue. 
Two major changes have swept through the 
Black Sea region. First, the hermetically-sealed 
border between Turkey, a member of NATO, 
and its Warsaw Pact neighbours opened up. 
Second, relations between the former Soviet- 
bloc countries are radically different today from 
what they were before 1989. In this new 
context, regional security will probably conti- 
nue to hinge on the two main Black Sea powers, 
Russia and Turkey, especially since access to the 
Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits is likely to 
remain on the agenda. But that issue will no 
longer be framed in the same way it was during 
the Cold War. Economic and environmental 
matters, especially the transport of oil from 
Russia, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan, will be 
more important than they were in the past. 
Passage through the straits is at the heart of 
the issues concerning the Black Sea because 
the transport of oil and gas from the Caspian 
Sea is one of the pivotal questions in the region 
today. The 30-year contract for exploiting 
Azerbaijani oilfields signed in September 1994

was called the “deal of the century”. The agree- 
ment provides for the extraction of 511 million 
tonnes, half of which are earmarked for export. 
Planned investments amount to $7.5 billion. 
Seventy per cent of the profits will go to 
Azerbaijan while the members of the consor- 
tium, made up of Azerbaijani, Russian and 
Western companies, will split 21 per cent. 
Three smaller consortiums have been formed 
since. 
Two proposed pipeline routes were ruled 
out from the start. The United States was 
opposed to the so-called “Iranian” route, and 
Azerbaijan opposed another that would have 
run in a straight line through Armenia. Two of 
the three options still under consideration 
involve the Black Sea. 
The first consists of using the existing, 
ageing pipeline that connects Azerbaijan and 
the Russian Black Sea port of Novorossiysk. 
That option is financially advantageous and 
meets with Moscow’s approval, but Turkey 
raises objections on security and environmental 
grounds, especially in relation to the cities of 
Istanbul and Canakkale. 
The second solution would be to build a 
new pipeline through Georgia and Turkey. Two 
variants are possible. In the first, more likely 
choice, the pipeline would end up at Supsa, a 
Georgian Black Sea port. In the second, it 
would branch off at Tbilisi and lead to the 
Turkish Mediterranean port of Ceyhan. That 
solution is very expensive, but would have the 
advantage of “cutting the cake in two” and 
decreasing consumers’ energy dependence on 
Russia. However, security is a concern since the 
Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) has already 
announced its intention to sabotage the project. 
The possibility remains of shipping oil via 
the Black Sea, to the Bulgarian port of Burgas 
and thence to the Greek port of 
Alexandropolis. That would pose several pro- 
blems, including passage into the Aegean Sea, 
which is disputed by Athens and Ankara. 
Another obstacle is that this solution would 
bypass Turkey and its high cost could only be 
met by the European Union, which would put 
a further strain on its relations with Ankara. 
A host of factors will influence the choice of 
a pipeline route, including the clout wielded by 
the United States and other powers such as 
China, especially in regard to the transport of 
oil from Kazakhstan. Oil, regional co-operation 
and military rivalries are some of the issues that 
still make the Black Sea one of the world’s most 
sensitive geostrategic areas. A

Trepassey sits mainly idle on Canada’s nor- 
theastern shore-a depressing reminder of 
the days when cod were plentiful and the streets 
bustled with 1,400 working residents. 
Trepassey is practically a ghost town now. 
The Sunday-night bingo game which used to

dozen people gambling for a measly jackpot. 
The community used to screen movies in the 
parish hall but no one can afford admission 
these days, and many of the young people have 
left anyway. Families drift out of town almost 
every week, abandoning homes they know 
they'll never sell. “Some of them didn’t even 
bother to board their windows,” says Don 
Corrigan, a veteran fisherman who still lives in 
Trepassey. “They just locked the doors and 
moved on. They've no intention of coming

This is the human side of an environmental

With “prawn farm is prison farm” as his slogan, S Jagannathan led thousands of 
India's poor farmers and fishers in a seven-year struggle to ban the country’s lucrative 
shrimp industry—a Herculean feat as India is one of the world’s top producers. Despite 
outbreaks of police violence, passive resistance groups rallied the support of environ- 
mental and consumer groups at home and abroad before convincing the Indian Supreme 
Court that people's fundamental rights had been violated by the industry. 
“ While millions of people were denied a square meal a day, the country was being 
forced to produce shrimp for the affluent abroad,” says Jagannathan an 85-year-old dis- 
ciple of Gandhi. Even as the government was withdrawing subsidies from the farmers 
hundreds of millions of rupees were given as loans and subsidies to big business entering 
shrimp farming.” 
With fish stocks plummeting,aquaculture had been hailed as a godsend, particularly 
for developing countries interestad in a new cash crop. Investors streamed into India’s 
coastal states like Tamil Nadu, where the area under shrimp cultivation rose from 250 hec- 
tares in 1991 to 2,000 in 1995 and production grew from 450 to 3,000 tonnes

them from the land they had depended on for generations. At the same time, saltwater 
and chemicals used for fertilizer and feed were seeping out of the vast ponds of brackish 
water used to grow the shrimp. The run-off and salinization damaged crop lands, man- 
groves, drinking water and groundwater aquifers, The brackish water ponds also drained 
fresh water supplies as saline levels rose with evaporation.” To raise one tonne of shrimps 
requires 50 to 60 million litres of water, half of which is fresh water,” says Bisham Gujja 
of the World Wide Fund for Nature, In addition,about 2.5 million cubic metres of effluent 
were discharged off the east coast daily, 
Presented with these reports, the Supreme Court ruled in December 1996 that vir- 
tually all shrimp farms within 500 metres of the high tide line had to be closed by 31 
March 1997 and a new aquaculture authority was to apply the “ polluter pays” principle. 
However, farms continue to operate through “ flimsy technical arguments”, says Gujja. 
“ But investors have pulled out of the industry. Even if the law is amended aquaculture in 
India will never be the same because investors will be careful to follow environmental

did we let the cod die? 
“The cod stocks failed because of greed,” 
says Dr. Richard Haedrich, a respected fishe- 
ries biologist at Newfoundland’s Memorial 
University, “People wanted all the money they 
could get out of the fish.” 
After greed, the answer gets more complex, 
involving a tangle of government rivalries and 
scientific arrogance. In the end, the cod were 
defeated by fishermen who became too good at 
fishing, scientists who ignored what they didn’t 
know and politicians who refused to make the 
tough decisions—until it was too late. 
By the time Canada’s fisheries minister 
John Crosbie closed the northern cod fishery in 
July 1992 and threw 40,000 Canadians out of 
their $500-million a year industry, decades of 
over-fishing had decimated the ground fish 
stocks and virtually emptied one of the most 
bountiful areas of the Atlantic. At the time, Mr. 
Crosbie tried to pacify fishermen by saying the 
moratorium would be over in two years. Not 
twelve months passed and Mr. Crosbie was for- 
ced to amend his overly optimistic time line: it 
would be at least half a decade before the cod 
returned. Six years later, the cod stocks remain 
at the lowest level observed in history—what 
one senior fisheries bureaucrat termed “a cala- 
mity of almost biblical proportions.” More 
recently, cod was listed as “vulnerable” on 
Canada’s endangered species list.

lers—both foreign and domestic—meant that 
entire schools of fish could be easily hunted 
down and sucked out of the Atlantic. 
Scientists, meanwhile, consistently overesti- 
mated the size of the stocks. Fisheries science, 
at best, is imprecise. Too little is known about 
the nature of the cod and its relationship to the 
ocean food chain, predators like seals,and tem- 
perature changes. But scientists relied too hea- 
vily on offshore catch rates for population esti- 
mates, and confused efficient, modern fishing 
with what was really happening in the ocean. 
With the scientists guessing too high, fisher- 
men slashed a far larger portion of the cod bio- 
mass than the quotas intended. 
“They weren’t fishing what was produced,” 
says Dr. Haedrich, “They were fishing what 
was producing. Scientists never admitted how 
great the uncertainty was and when decisions 
were made they fell on the side of what was 
favourable economically, rather than what was 
conservative ecologically. Nobody stuck up for 
the fish.”

Waste and want 
Some 200 million people work in fishing worldwide (industrial and self-employed 
combined),while as many as 500 million depend on the oceans indirectly through jobs in 
tourism, shipping,oil and gas and other aspects of the fishing industry. In 1996 seafood 
production, including aquaculture, was valued at $120 billion. Half the world’s catch is 
exported, especially to the developed countries, which absorb 80% of imports in value. 
One billion people depend on the sea for their main source of food every day. Global 
export earnings from fishing exceed those from coffee, tea, cocoa and sugar. But post- 
catch losses are very high,precisely in those places where the need is greatest. In Africa, 
losses to self-employed fishermen due to poor unloading,transport and packaging condi- 
tions, as well as the hot climate, range from 25% to 50% of the catch. 
Aquaculture is booming. Farmed fish production tripled over the last decade, reaching 
230 million tonnes in 1996. Farmed salmon output rose from around 34,000 to 300,000 
tonnes, shrimp from 50,000 to 720,000 tonnes. Shrimp production has increased six-fold 
in Asia and Central America.Aquaculture already meets 20% of world demand for sea- 
food and could grow by another 70% between now and 2010. The problem is, instead of 
reducing food shortages the industry invests in the production of expensive seafood that 
only those in developed countries can afford. What is more, since most of the farmed spe- 
cies are carnivorous, aquaculture consumes huge amounts of animal protein that would 
go to much better use on children’s plates. JS H

1980s that the stocks were in trouble, politi- 
cians in Ottawa hesitated to lower quotas and 
slice into the fishermen’s income.T he industry 
was already indirectly subsidized,crowded with 
fish processing and canning workers and fisher- 
men who work for several weeks and then claim 
unemployment insurance for the rest of the 
year. Catching less fish would mean hardship 
particularly for the people in Newfoundland 
who have few other employment options. It 
would force layoffs—and the possible closure— 
of fish plants. Faced with this reality and inten- 
se lobbying from provincial politicians to main- 
tain the fishery, the government in Ottawa set 
quotas based on social and economic factors, 
not science. 
Today, in the out ports of Newfoundland, 
fishermen forced into poverty have begun to 
give up. Many of them no longer expect to see 
the cod return in their lifetime. T hey talk about 
selling their licences back to Ottawa and wal- 
king away from the sea for good—a painful step 
for people who thought they’d fish forever. 
The moratorium, says Newfoundland 
fishermen Wilfred Williams, “destroyed every- 
thing I ever worked for. I made my living from 
the sea all my working life—where am I going

environment shout themselves hoarse: “The sea 
is not a garbage can! Stop the damage.” 
Each year, three to four million tonnes of 
petroleum end up in the sea. The “black tides” 
are, of course, spectacular and eye-catching, but 
the greater danger comes from the thousands of 
tonnes discharged into the wakes of ships. 
“Accidents such as those of the Torrey Canyon 
(1967) or the Amoco Cadiz (1978) are impressi- 
ve,” recalls Ray Griffiths, formerly in charge of 
the Marine Pollution Programme of UNESCO’s 
Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission 
(IOC), “but the marine environment is the vic- 
tim of silent abuse, with heavier consequences in 
the long run, from the tanker degassing and 
waste oils from tank washing at sea.” 
The shipowners’ lack of scruples is, howe- 
ver, responsible for only 25 per cent of marine 
pollution by hydrocarbons. According to Tony 
Knap of the Bermuda Biological Station for 
Research, this proportion is even declining. Tar 
concentrations in the open ocean are decrea- 
(Cpa feel sorry for dolphins choked by 
     
sing as the techniques for transporting and 
handling petroleum products improve. On the 
other hand, 60 per cent of this type of pollution 
is of land-based origin, essentially due to the 
discharge of used motor oil through urban 
sewer systems. The remaining 15 per cent 
comes from offshore oil-platforms for the 
extraction of natural gas and petroleum. 
France’s Research Institute for the 
Exploitation of the Sea, Ifremer, has drawn 
attention to another danger: the ever increasing 
shipment of toxic products, explosives and 
industrial and nuclear wastes by sea. The sea 
continues to wash ashore barrels and contai- 
ners from cargo vessels. 
Stowaway bacteria 
Worse still, all kinds of “clandestine passen- 
gers” are shipped, in spite of themselves, from 
one end of the planet to the other: these are the 
bacteria, viruses and other organisms in sea 
water taken on board with ballast water. On 
arrival, this water is discharged without treat- 
ment or filtration. Consequently more than 
3,000 species of animals and plants are trans- 
ported each day. According to James Baker, the 
Administrator of the United States National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
(NOAA), 80 million tonnes of “foreign” water 
are thus discharged into America’s coastal 
waters each year. In the San Francisco area, he 
says, 212 exoteric species have been identified. 
The Mediterranean has also received a hun-

dred or so new wild species in the last few 
years, of which the most famous is the “killer 
alga” (Caulerpa taxifolia), said to have been 
released from the aquaria of the 
Oceanographic Museum in Monaco. These 
intruder species may be responsible for the 
disappearance of some native fauna or flora 
and for the disturbance of local ecosystems. 
The consequences of increasing maritime 
shipping are thus very varied and sometimes 
unexpected. Yet, just as for hydrocarbon pollu- 
tion, shipping is not the only factor responsible. 
In fact, it accounts for only 10 per cent of all 
marine pollution. More than three-quarters of 
marine pollutants originate on land. They get 
into the sea by run-off directly from the land or 
via rivers. They can also get there by direct 
discharge or via the atmosphere, Griffiths adds. 
The main reasons are the lack of sewerage infra- 
structure, intensive agriculture and industry. 
About 70 per cent of wastes discharged into the 
Pacific receive no form of prior treatment, 
according to the UN Environment 
Programme’s (UNEP) 1997 report on The State 
of the Environment. And according to a UNEP 
report on the Mediterranean, 1.7 billion cubic 
metres of municipal waste water are discharged 
directly, of which three-quarters is untreated. 
The North and the South are in the same 
boat, the developing countries being increasin- 
gly handicapped by the strong population 
increase, lack of financial means and expertise, 
all of which prevent them from putting a stop 
to the problem. In France, for example, the 
water consumed by one third of the population 
is still not purified. In Egypt, Alexandria Bay is 
being asphyxiated, essentially by the discharge 
of sewage, to the extent that some places, such 
as the roadstead of Aboukir, are considered to 
be biologically dead. 
The application of pesticides, herbicides and 
other poisons in intensive agriculture allows one 
part of the planet’s inhabitants to have affor- 
dable food, but deprives everybody of certain 
marine delicacies. T he excess of these chemical 
products is washed off the land into rivers and 
hence into the sea and “may affect the growth

and development of marine organisms, notably 
crustacean larvae and juveniles,” Griffiths 
explains. “They may also modify the structure 
of phytoplankton communities and disturb 
photosynthesis”. Worse still, the phosphates and 
nitrates in chemical fertilizers, which also indi- 
rectly enter the sea, provoke “red tides”, massi- 
ve outbreaks of unicellular algae. “The toxins 
they contain progress up the food chain into the 
bodies of the top predators, such as the big 
fishes in the same area” which is not without 
danger to those who eat them. “These red tides 
can also use up the oxygen dissolved in the 
water” to the point of asphyxiating local fauna. 
The winds transport many agricultural pollu- 
tants over thousands of kilometres, even as far 
as the Antarctic and the Arctic. Abnormally 
high amounts of these chemicals have been 
found in the bodies of Inuits, who are major 
consumers of marine animal fats, in the Arctic, 
and also in the Antarctic’s Adélie penguins. 
Choked waters 
The Baltic Sea is asphyxiated by industrial pok 
lution, with paper-pulp producers discharging 
annually 200,000 tonnes of chlorinated pro- 
ducts and mercury. Everywhere, industries 
dump their effluents into bodies of water and 
their gases into the atmosphere. For example, 
66 billion cubic metres of industrial wastes are 
discharged annually into the Mediterranean. 
The ocean absorbs enormous quantities of 
mineral oils, detergents, phosphates, and heavy 
metals, including cadmium, lead, copper, zinc 
from metallurgical processes, and mercury, 
also in connexion with mining. 
Overall, about a third of atmospheric pollu- 
tants directly fall into the sea or with rainfall.Of 
the seven billion tonnes of carbon dioxide pro- 
duced annually by human activity, the ocean 
receives at least two billion. We know that the 
ocean is a formidable recycling machine for 
gases naturally present in the atmosphere, but 
how far will it be able to stand the extra load 
that we are expecting it to bear? Scientists won- 
der whether it will be able to adapt to the global 
warming induced by the greenhouse gases pro- 
duced by human activities, without disturbing 
its equilibrium and its circulation. 
In every corner of the planet, experts, 
United Nations agencies and non-governmen- 
tal organizations are waving the red flag. The 
Mediterranean is in danger of “undergoing the 
same evolution as that of the Black Sea, whose 
water contains no dissolved oxygen below a 
depth of 150 to 200 metres, which limits the 
available living space for marine organisms, 
and especially of slow-growing demersal fish 
species,” UNEP warns. Phytoplankton stocks 
have fallen by 80 per cent since 1951 along the 
coast of California, probably due to global war- 
ming, according to the Scripps Institute of 
Oceanography. Biodiversity is declining, but it 
seems we do not know enough to act. |

How much

white sand 
beaches and 
turquoise 
waters absorb?

hen the U.S. war correspondent Martha Gell- 
Ween visited the British Virgin Islands in the 
1940s, she came across a cove “where nothing 
had changed since time began, a half circle of white 
sand, flanked by huge squarish smooth rocks... . and the 
water turquoise blue.” When she returned many years 
later, she found her cove “full of sun-tanned bodies 
and ringed by boats . . . there were bottles and plastic 
debris on the sea-bed and picnic litter on the sand.” 
Tourism has taken over the Caribbean: in 1997 
more than 14 million people took their holidays 
there, with some three million more dropping in 
from cruises. “Tar balls” on beaches indicate that oil 
tankers and other ships dump their oil and garbage 
overboard (despite laws against such practice), while 
pollution off Florida and in the Gulf of Mexico is 
causing serious concern. 
However, it is the ever-growing cruise-ship 
industry which is a particular focus of concern for 
the Caribbean Sea. The larger and newer cruise 
ships have adopted a “greener” approach, with 
modern waste-processing facilities, according to the 
Center for Marine Conservation Organization in 
Washington. Yet a report by the Economist 
Intelligence Unit concluded that “there is much evi- 
dence that dumping of rubbish at sea does take 
place.” 
It is not just the seas that have been affected by 
the demands of the tourist industry. Those fragile 
ecosystems surrounding so many Caribbean islands, 
the coral reefs, are under stress as well. In Tobago, 
tourists destroy exposed coral by walking on it in 
plastic sandals; in the Bahamas souvenir shops loot 
the reefs for stock, loading their shelves with shells,

Belize has the second longest barrier reef in 
the world and well-publicized conservation pro- 
jects working to protect it. Yet its two marine 
nature reserves have shown signs of environmen- 
tal degradation—associated with too many 
people visiting a too fragile site. 
In the Cayman Islands the local watersports 
association has complained to the government 
about the damage done by cruise ships dropping 
anchor on the reefs. Government scientists have 
acknowledged that more than 300 acres of coral 
reef have already been lost to cruise ship anchors 
in the harbour at George Town, the capital of 
Grand Cayman. Proposals to increase the num- 
ber of cruise ship moorings continue to threaten 
the reefs. And by destroying the reefs, you des- 
troy the tourist industry. 
Short-term profits 
While cruise ships bring waste on to the land, 
waste from the land is also dumped in the sea. A 
1994 study by the Caribbean Tourism 
Organisation (CTO) showed that waste water 
treatment facilities in many hotels were of “limi- 
ted value with regard to the treatment of micro- 
biological and nutrient removal”. The report also 
noted that 80-90 per cent of inadequately treated 
sewage was disposed of in coastal waters, near 
hotels, on beaches and around coral reefs and 
mangroves. 
Since then, there has been increasing aware- 
ness among hotels and tourist boards of the envi- 
ronmental costs to the tourist industry of irres- 
ponsible policies. At least, in theory. The truth is 
that although lip-service is paid to environmental 
awareness, there is little enforcement of the limi- 
ted legislation that does exist. Or as Calvin 
Howell, the former head of the Caribbean 
Conservation Association, explained: “The pro- 
blem has been exacerbated by an attitude that 
approves of short-term rather than long-term 
sustainable development.” The evidence for this 
is that foreign developers are still moving in to 
create resorts and golf courses on coastal lands. 
The CTO has on many occasions appealed to 
the region “as a matter of urgency” to put toge- 
ther an environmental plan. This has yet to hap- 
pen. Early in 1998, managers from Caribbean 
marine sanctuaries in more than twenty of the 
region’s countries discussed ways of countering 
the threat to marine resources. Once again, co- 
operation was the theme. “We need to look at the 
Caribbean as one system,” said Richard Curry of 
the Biscayne National Park near Miami. But 
another question remains: when will govern- 
ments get the message? [|

### 112516: The Offshore islanders

The offshoféiislanders 
The sea is so much a part of 
daily life on a North Sea gas 
platform that you almost forget 
it’s there. 
tion needs no formal response. Only a new- 
comer to Conoco’s Viking B gas platform 
could get lost in a dreamy gaze to the horizon or take 
a hesitant step on the metal grates of the decks, 
mesmerized by the sight of the North Sea rolling 
thirty metres below. 
For offshore initiates, the sea appears to be a 
non-entity. The waves just fade into the back- 
ground framing daily life. The closest you come 
to actually feeling them is when the crane 
rumbles to unload cargo—the vibrations gently 
rocking the platform perched on giant metal legs 
140 kilometres off the coast of Lincolnshire 
(UK). Outside of a power failure, you won't 
even hear the waves roll above the hum, grind 
and whine of the equipment that keeps about six 
million standard cubic metres of gas surging 
daily through pipelines lining the seabed to 
shore. 
“At first, you're just fascinated by the sea,” 
says Vera Swan, one of the few female employees 
on the catering staff looking after the crew of 
seventy-odd men. “You get worked up over sun- 
sets and stand quietly with the others. But after 
six years, I forget that I am out to sea.” 
“I’m new out here,” says Steve Slinger. “So 
the sea is still a novelty for me. I thought the 
North Sea was grey but it can be a beautiful tur- 
quoise blue. I'm still in the phase of looking out 
and thinking ‘Wow! But that will probably 
pass,” he says. “The hard part is not being able 
to go for a long walk. You feel penned in by the 
water. But I didn’t come offshore to admire the 
waves. I came because the money is good. At 
forty-five, I've got no formal qualifications but a 
lot of work experience. Where I come from in 
Scotland, you are doing quite well by making 
£15,000 [$25,000] per year.” Salaries offshore 
range between £28,000 [$45,000] and £70,000 
[$115,000] for senior managers. 
Money-making clearly surpasses sea-faring 
as the main offshore attraction. However, it is 
the routine of platform life which seems to 
drown out any romantic notions of life at sea. 
“It’s just not the same as when you're on a ship 
and you actually go somewhere,” says Hank 
Rawlins, who has worked offshore twenty-three 
of his fifty-five years. On the platform, every- 
thing is programmed. After two weeks of holiday 
at home, crew members arrive by helicopter for 
¢ t’s your first trip offshore, isn’t it?’ T he ques-

fourteen days of twelve-hour work shifts, essen- 
tially spent adjusting, testing and maintaining 
the machinery used to measure and compress 
the gas piped in from five remote-controlled 
fields nearby. T he slightest adjustment requires 
consultation with a supervisor. “You can feel like 
a robot,” quips crew-member, Mick Draper, 
“until you realize just what you are sitting on. 
Remember how easy it is to light your gas hea- 
ting system at home and consider that out here, 
the gas pressure is 1,500 times that.” 
But once the shift is over, the biggest decision 
may be whether to have rice pudding at dinner or 
a work-out in the gym. For Viking life is surpri- 
singly civilized. Stewardesses make the beds 
every morning, with fresh laundry folded at the 
door and meals waiting in the mess hall. 
Evenings are spent flipping through the daily 
tabloids (delivered by helicopter) or the televi- 
sion channels. While alcohol is strictly forbidden, 
smoking is permitted. And home no longer feels 
so far away with free telephone calls available. 
Yet for all the creature comforts, the sea still 
sneaks up on the platform. The sea is so much a 
part of daily life that people stop seeing it. For 
example, you start preparing for a possible plun- 
ge into the frigid waves (2-6°C) before even lea- 
ving the coast. Crew-members and visitors alike 
actually practise finding their way out of heli- 
copters which have crashed and spun upside 
down in the murky, cold water of special pools. 
Once offshore, no one dares walk the deck 
without donning a bright red suit. If anyone 
does slip off, a surveillance team can spot and 
scoop them up with a “mother ship” and her 
“daughter” constantly patrolling the platform 
perimeter. 
With so much attention paid to the lives the 
sea may take, it is easy to overlook what it gives. 
Fishing was a favourite pastime until the heli- 
copter pilots began complaining about the 
smells of dinner-packages taken home. Birds 
literally drop in, exhausted by the North Sea’s ©

dimensions. Suddenly another day spent adjus- 
ting machinery gives way to tenderness and 
curiosity, as crew-members flock to the lost 
creatures, feeding them, charting their arrival 
and even taking them ashore by helicopter. 
More importantly, “you find confidence,” 
says June Cerey, who does Viking’s laundry 
during the night shift. After raising her sixteen- 
year-old son, she decided at the age of thirty-five 
to carve out a new life for herself offshore. After 
getting past the usual jitters of walking the gra- 
ted decks and feeling a “wee bit scared” of the 
helicopter, the real challenge lay in walking 
through the mess hall during dinner. “I'd get so 
embarrassed at being the only woman. They're 
not the ‘rough and ready’ guys I expected, but 
real family men. Still, it takes some confidence.”

Bob Thorpe, one of Vikings two supervisors. 
“Out here, you concentrate on your work 
without everyday worries like a broken washing 
machine. You get job satisfaction. Then you go 
ashore, and you focus on your home and family.” 
Above all else, the sea imposes self-reliance. 
“If there is an emergency, you cannot call an 
ambulance or firemen,” says Thorpe. “We rely 
on ourselves. This is why you don’t find the ste- 
reotypical macho guy out here. Men like that 
tend to be risk-takers, thinking theyre ‘too big’ 
to follow safety procedures. They just don’t last 
long because the rest of the crew won’t accept 
them, especially since Piper Alpha.” This is the 
name of another North Sea platform which 
exploded ten years ago, killing 167 of the 226 
crew-members. A lethal mix of major design 
flaws, poor safety planning and incompetent lea- 
dership set off the fire. The sea proved to be the 
final escape. The sole survivors were those who 
jumped overboard. 
Besides the give and take, the sea also 
demands respect, which may have been long in 
coming. When the North Sea drilling industry 
first began in the 1970s, environmental 
concerns were non-existent. Today companies 
like Conoco can no longer ignore them. 
According to the rules, the only thing to be 
dumped off Viking is human waste. Chemicals, 
fuel, bits of broken tools are carefully collected 
for disposal onshore. Yet despite all the precau- 
tions, gas leaks, primarily into the atmosphere, 
continue, even though they are a far bigger pro- 
blem on drilling platforms. 
On a more personal level, it is the sheer force 
of the sea which captures the crew’s imagination 
and respect. “I have been offshore for about ten 
years,” says Paul Preston. “I can walk past the 
waves in the morning without really seeing 
them. But I am still taken by the sea. During a 
storm, you see the strength of it and imagine the 
violence it can do. That’s when I realize what a 
minuscule dot we are on. Maybe you need to 
forget that you are surrounded by the sea. 
Because if you began thinking about all that can 
go wrong, you could never work out here.” ®

### 112517: Laws for the ocean

Over the last fifty years, international maritime law 
has developed very rapidly. This is hardly surprising 
given the unprecedented demands now put upon the 
oceans, their resources and the marine environment. 
52 THE UNESCO COURIER 
e largest treaty ever negotiated, the United 
Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea 
is a fairly recent development,entering into 
force on 16 November 1994. Yet its roots stem 
back to the early 1950s when the UN Internatio- 
nal Law Commission was set up with the task of 
codifying and developing international law, a great 
deal of which is unwritten, arising from the consis- 
tent practice of states. While this customary 
approach is excellent for establishing principles, 
treaties are needed to work out the essential details. 
For more than 300 years, it was simply 
accepted that coastal states are each entitled to 
sovereignty over a body of water immediately 
beside the coast. This sovereignty was absolute 
except for the right of innocent passage by 
foreign merchant vessels. However, internatio- 
nal law did not, for example, define the exact 
extent of this “territorial sea” (which was three 
and is now twelve nautical miles) or the condi- 
tions of “innocent passage”. So in about 1951, 
the International Law Commission began wor- 
king to resolve these old issues as well as some 
new ones: namely the conservation of the 
ocean’s living resources and petroleum develop- 
ment on the continental shelf. 
Concerned by dwindling fish stocks, coun- 
tries like Portugal, Spain, Argentina, and 
Iceland had been pressing for decades for zones 
of fisheries conservation jurisdiction. However, 
they were outnumbered by the majority of coas- 
tal states who wanted to preserve more or less 
unlimited and unrestricted access to the living 
resources in what were still regarded as the high 
seas. 
Turning to offshore petroleum, geologists 
had long known that the continental shelf had 
considerable potential. Declining domestic 
sources of oil coupled with increasing domestic

demand led American experts to look closely at 
the seabed of the Gulf of Mexico beyond the 
three nautical mile limit. Yet there was a pro- 
blem. While companies were not prohibited 
from exploring beyond that limit, they enjoyed 
no legal security in conducting operations 
there. They also had no “legal” rights to any 
petroleum they might find. In order to provide 
a proper legal foundation for offshore petro- 
leum activities (and the steep investment requi- 
red), the American government proposed that 
all coastal states should have the right to extend 
their jurisdiction to the edge of the “continental 
shelf”. 
This proposal was accepted with great 
enthusiasm throughout the world. However, the 
motives for agreement were not all the same. 
For some countries, the extension was a cloak 
for control over the adjacent fishery. This fun- 
damental difference prompted the International 
Law Commission to step in and lead the way to 
the First United Nations Conference on the 
Law of the Sea, convened in Geneva in 1958. 
Yet despite the fact that four Conventions—on 
the Territorial Sea and Contiguous Zone, the 
High Seas, the Living Resources of the High 
Seas, and the Continental Shelf—were accepted 
and signed, there was an obvious divergence 
between countries in favour of fisheries jurisdic- 
tion and those opposed. As a result, there were 
major gaps in some of the treaties. 
A second conference convened in 1960 to 
resolve the issue was an absolute failure. From 
then on, states which considered that they had 
been victimized by the lack of jurisdiction felt 
obliged to take the law into their own hands. 
Countries like Iceland started enforcing exclu- 
sive fisheries zones to 12, then 50, then 200 
nautical miles. Others followed suit; some 
willingly, others less so, but the former even- 
tually prevailed over the latter while the 
Convention was still being negotiated. 
Meanwhile, progress was made in dealing 
with mineral resources. Countries looked 
favourably upon the Convention on the 
Continental Shelf of 1958 which recognized 
“sovereign rights for the purposes of explora- 
tion and exploitation” on the seabed and sub- 
soil of the shelf. It is important to note that the 
terms “sovereignty” or “ownership” are careful- 
ly avoided. The Convention’s framers did not 
want to suggest that countries exercised absolu- 
te rights beyond the limits of the territorial sea, 
because this might ultimately endanger the free- 
dom of the seas. 
Rights and freedoms 
The problem lay in defining the extent of these 
rights. A fixed limit was seen as artificial. On the 
other hand, a reference to the geographical fea- 
ture “continental shelf” would not please coas- 
tal states like Chile which does not have a natu- 
ral shelf of significant extent. So the edge of the 
“legal” continental shelf was fixed at the 200- 
metre isobath (the world’s average shelf edge 
depth), or beyond “to the point where the depth 
of the superjacent waters admits of exploita- 
tion”. In other words, all countries were gua- 
ranteed a minimum of control to a 200-metre 
depth, while those that had the technology to 
exploit deeper could still do so. We must 
remember that in 1958, 200 metres seemed to 
be an extraordinary depth. The problem was, of 
course, that science and technology developed 
faster than anyone had thought possible. 
So by the early 1970s, it looked as if indus- 
trialized coastal states were about to carve up 
the world’s ocean space. This was unacceptable 
for a number of reasons. First, it looked like a 
bonanza for coastal states at the expense of their 
land-locked cousins. Second, accidents of poli- 
tical geography sometimes resulted in curious 
boundaries. Countries with relatively long 
coastlines were clearly going to do better than

others. Portugal, or Chile with its 4,200 kilo- 
metres of coast would have a relatively vast area 
of ocean space compared, say, to Spain. 
There was also a serious ethical problem. If 
national jurisdiction was allowed to spread 
unchecked, it would be virtually impossible to 
fairly distribute the oceans’ resources. To coun- 
ter this, attention turned to limiting this juris- 
diction and recognizing the areas beyond as the 
“common heritage of mankind”. 
Given the dimensions of the problems, the 
time was clearly ripe for another international 
conference. For example, the archipelagic states 
wanted recognition of their rights 
to the waters between and around 
their islands. Landlocked states 
wished to have their rights of 
access to marine resources clearly 
articulated. And there was an 
urgent need for detailed rules 
regarding the preservation of the 
marine environment—a topic vir- 
tually ignored in 1958. And who 
was to govern and profit from the 
area beyond national jurisdiction? 
There was also some feeling that 
the International Court of Justice could not pro- 
perly resolve these issues. A tribunal was needed 
to specialize in the Law of the Sea. 
A third UN conference ended in December 
1982. All the participating countries voted for 
the Convention except four—Israel, Turkey, the 
United States, and Venezuela—and seventeen 
that abstained. Until recently, the countries 
becoming full parties to the Convention were 
found in Asia, Africa, and South America. T his, 
and the continuing refusal of the United States 
even to sign the Convention, led some observers 
to dismiss the conference results, but it is now 
clear that such judgments were premature. 
The major difficulty lies with mining the 
deep seabed, which is the area considered to be 
the common heritage of mankind. US firms 
prevailed on the Reagan administration not to 
sign, much less ratify, the Convention. 
However, a compromise on the regime for such 
mining was reached in 1994 which should 
prove acceptable to all (and is to the industria- 
lized countries). 
Yet as in 1958, not everything is perfect. For 
example, Canada’s east coast has one of the 
world’s most extensive continental shelves. 
According to the Convention, petroleum activi- 
ties in this area are firmly under Canadian juris- 
diction. However, control over living resources 
extends only to 200 nautical miles through the 
creation in 1994 of the Exclusive Economic

Zones. The problem is, Canada’s shelf goes well 
beyond this distance, with species swimming in 
and out of the zone. So, in theory, foreign ves- 
sels can remain just outside Canadian jurisdic- 
tion and catch as many fish as they please, to the 
possible detriment of Canadian fishers who are 
obliged to follow Canadian rules in or out of the 
zone. This has led to both a confrontation and 
treaty between Canada and Spain; the problem 
was resolved by an Agreement on High Seas 
Fisheries in 1995. 
Conservation and control are the raisons 
d’étre of the law of the sea. The concept of the 
“common heritage of mankind” 
recognizes that a country should 
not have the right to exploit a 
resource (e.g. the deep sea-bed) 
merely because it has the capacity 
to do so. The common heritage is 
held in trust for the peoples of all 
countries. The Convention forbids 
exploration or exploitation there 
without a mandate from the 
International Seabed Authority 
(established by the Convention 
and based in Jamaica) which must 
ensure that the benefits accruing are distributed 
equitably. The other expert bodies are emerging: 
the Tribunal on the Law of the Sea was establi- 
shed in Hamburg in 1996, and the Continental 
Shelf Commission now meets in New York. In 
short, the process is well underway. 
No-one should underestimate the chal- 
lenges involved in implementing the 
Convention, which has now been ratified by 
125 states. Yet in light of the fragility of our 
ocean environment, it is in the interest of both 
the industrialized and less-industrialized states 
alike to overcome them. |

While the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea deals in more general terms with the different uses of 
the seas, there are a number of treaties and instruments on more specific aspects of marine affairs. Here are some 
examples: 
Maritime safety: 
International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) 
Adopted in 1974,entered into force in 1980, 137 Contracting States. 
The most important of all treaties dealing with the safety of merchant ships, its first version was adopted in 1914, 
after the Titanic disaster in 1912.1 is updated by periodic amendments to keep pace with technical developments in 
the shipping industry. 
Marine pollution from vessels: 
International Convention relating to Intervention on the High Seas in cases of Qil Pollution Casualties. 
Adopted in 1969 entered into force in 1975,72 Contracting States. It affirms the right of a coastal State to take such 
measures on the high seas as may be necessary to prevent, mitigate or eliminate danger to its coastline following a 
maritime casualty. 
Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter. Adopted in 
1972,entered into force in 1975,77 Contracting States. lt prohibits the dumping of certain hazardous materials from 
vessels, aircraft platforms or other man-made structures, requires prior permits for the dumping of a number of other 
identified materials and wastes. 
International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL 73/78) 
Adopted in 1973. Due to the technical complexity and wide scope of the Convention, various parts of it have ente- 
red into force at different dates. Although Annex IV concerning sewage has been accepted by 70 states, their mer- 
chant fleets represent only 41.47% of world tonnage. Until countries with the largest fleets have accepted and the 
required minimum percentage of 50% is achieved, this annex will nat enter into force. 
This is the most important and ambitious of all international treaties an marine pollution, covering all the tech- 
nical aspects of accidental and operational pollution from ships, except the disposal of waste by dumping and pollu- 
tion arising out of the exploration and exploitation of sea-bed mineral resources. 
International Convention on Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response and Cooperation. Adopted in 1990,ente- 
red into force in 1995,38 Contracting States. It combats major incidents or threats of marine pollution, requires ships 
and operators of offshore units to have oil pollution emergency plans, calls for the establishment of stockpiles of oil 
spill combating equipment and the holding of combating exercises. 
Marine pollution from land-based activities: 
No global agreement exists dealing specifically with the prevention and control of marine pollution from land-based 
activities. However, the non-binding “ Global Programme of Action for the Protection of the Marine Environment from 
Land-based Activities” was adopted in Washington on 3 November 1295 and is expected to enhance proper mana- 
gement of land-based activities that could cause marine pollution. 
Liability and compensation: 
International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage. Adopted in 1969,entered into force 1975, 
100 Contracting States. Brought about by the Torrey Canyon incident of 1967 the Convention ensures that adegua- 
te financial compensation is available to persons who suffer oil-pollution damage from ships and places the liability 
for such damage on the shipowner. 
Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage resulting from Exploration for and Exploitation of 
Seabed Mineral Resources 
Adopted In 1977, not yet in force, It is designed to ensure that adequate compensation is available to victims of pol- 
lution damage from seabed activities by means of the adoption of uniform rules and procedures determining ques- 
tions of liability, 
International Convention on Liability and Compensation for Damage in Connection with the Carriage of 
Hazardous and Noxious Substances by Sea. Adopted in 1996,not yet in force. The Convention makes it possible 
for the equivalent of $250 million to be paid out in compensation to victims of accidents involving chemicals;covers 
not only pollution but alsa the risks of fire and explosion. |

### 112518: The Unpunished polluter

The unpun

Rémi Parmentier* 
hen international environmental policy 
first became a widespread topic of dis- 
cussion in the early 1970s, some people 
suggested holding industry and states liable for 
damage caused by marine pollution. Later,Fran- 
ce’s first Environment Minister, Brice Lalonde, 
grabbed headlines by declaring “the polluters will 
pay”, and state involvement in environmental 
issues was perceived as an encouraging sign. Yet, 
25 years later, little progress has been made. 
When people hear the words “marine pollu- 
tion”, they usually think of accidental fossil fuel 
spills. But most oil slicks are caused by intentio- 
nal discharges from ships at sea, which would 
rather risk being caught in the act and fined than 
pay a special fee to use waste reception facilities 
in harbour. Experience shows that this fee, 
which covers the cost of waste storage, treatment 
and disposal, has a perverse effect by creating an 
incentive for tankers to empty their holds at sea 
to avoid paying it. If it were automatically inclu- 
ded in the overall harbour fee, the financial 
incentive to dump at sea would disappear and 
marine pollution would be reduced. T his theory 
was proven when a pilot project implemented 
between 1988 and 1991 by German Ldnder with 
seacoasts led to a significant decline in the num- 
ber of oil-coated birds, demonstrating the mea- 
sure’s effectiveness. 
Without indulging in conspiracy theories, 
environmentalists question the ties between the 
so-called dirty industries and governments, 
including intergovernmental organizations. 
The International Maritime Organization 
(IMO), the United Nations agency that regu- 
lates shipping, is a case in point. The dues of 
IMO member States are determined by the 
tonnage of their fleets, which gives countries 
with the most super-tankers an obvious advan- 
tage. As a result, some IMO delegations inclu- 
de members of the oil industry who “repre- 
sent” the countries that lend their flags at sea. 
IMO says that the fund set up in 1971 to

### 112519: Sea tribunal makes a slow start

 
Sea tribunal 
makes a slow start 
Marine pollution has been punishable by a fine imposed by an international court since 
the International Tribunal on the Law of the Sea was set up under United Nations aus- 
pices in October 1996. The tribunal is also in charge of settling disputes over the demar- 
cation of territorial waters, fishing areas and navigation zones. Its decisions are binding 
on the 125 countries that have ratified the International Convention on the Law of the 
Sea. 
The court is made up of 21 elected members, including five from the group of African 
states, five from the Asian group, four from Latin America and the Caribbean, three from 
eastern Europe and four from the Western world and countries not associated with any 
group, based on the geographical classification used in the United Nations. Judges, diplo- 
mats, researchers and professors, the members are all experts in maritime disputes. 
After election, lots are drawn to determine which judges will serve terms of three, six 
or nine years The Tribunal’s statutes also provide for a rotation system leaving seven seats 
empty so that a partial election may be held every three years. Even after their terms of 
office have ended, the judges finish work on cases they have begun. 
So far, the only case that has come before the Tribunal, which sits in Hamburg, 
Germany, is a dispute between Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and the Republic of 
Guinea. In November 1997 the Caribbean island nation went to the court to ask for the 
restitution of a freighter Guinea had confiscated for smuggling inside its territorial waters.

compensate damage from oil spills has already 
distributed some $267 million—a pittance 
considering that in Germany cleaning up an 
oil-fouled beach costs between $2,800 and 
$5,500 per tonne of sludge. What’s more, the 
fund does not cover damage caused by routine 
discharges at sea. 
IMO policy towards the offshore industry 
has also been criticized. T he suggestion in 1996 
that operational discharges of wastes from off- 
shore installations should be regulated like ope- 
rational discharge from ships had the oil indus- 
try up in arms. To this day, the offshore indus- 
try’s discharges are still excluded from the 
London Convention, which regulates the dum- 
ping of wastes at sea. 
Similarly, when in 1995 Denmark’s govern- 
ment proposed a moratorium on the submer- 
sion of offshore oil rigs, countries with very 
strong ties to the oil industry closed ranks and 
protested against the measure to protect their 
short-term interests, opposing a policy that 
could have given the steel recycling industry a 
major boost. N

Agreeing to share

the two countries plenty of headaches since it was 
discovered by France’s Total company in 1960. 
The only known offshore oilfield within their eco- 
nomic zone, which is also rich in fishing resources, 
its reserves are put at 100 million tonnes of heavy 
oil and only one million tonnes of light.Clearly, 
the economic stakes are high. 
International Court of Justice at The Hague. 
Dismissing the appeal eight months later, the 
Court upheld the Franco-Portuguese agree- 
ment of 1960 and asked both parties to agree 
on a border between their respective exclusive 
zones. 
Guinea Bissau went along with the offer of 
bilateral talks and eventually accepted the 
Court’s verdict. In 1995 the two countries set 
up a joint body called the Management and Co- 
operation Agency (AGC), for the joint develop- 
1 ment of resources located between azimuths 
268° and 220°, starting from Cape Roxo on the 
land frontier between the two states. 
The countries agreed on an equitable share- 
out of fishing resources, but not of oil.In accor- 
dance with the decision of the International 
Court of Justice at The Hague, 85% of oil pro- 
fits will go to Senegal and 15% to Guinea 
Bissau. If new oil reserves are discovered, the 
20-year agreement will be revised accordingly.

After 16 years of legal battles and a few 
skirmishes in 1991, the two countries opted for 
a pragmatic settlement of their territorial dis- 
pute and in October 1993 signed an agreement 
to manage and develop their maritime 
resources jointly. Until then, such an outcome 
had seemed a remote possibility. 
The earliest negotiations date back to 1977. 
When the two countries failed to reach agree- 
ment, they decided in 1985 to take the case to 
arbitration before a tribunal. Four years later 
the court upheld a Franco-Portuguese agree- 
ment of 1960 establishing the maritime boun- 
dary between their two colonies. But Guinea 
Bissau rejected this decision, arguing that the 
tribunal had failed to provide a map showing 
the exact boundary, as the two parties had 
requested.

Wor the past ten years,the question of fishing 
\wrights has been a stumbling block in rela- 
tions between Morocco and the European 
Union (EU). With a coastline of nearly 3,500 
kilometres, Morocco offers major possibilities 
that have kindled a keen interest on the part of the 
EU. Five hundred Spanish vessels fish in Moroc- 
co’s exclusive economic zone—95% of the 
Union’s fishing fleet operating in the area. 
Three four-year agreements have been suc- 
cessively concluded, largely concerned with 
granting the EU fishing rights in Moroccan 
waters in exchange for financial compensation. 
The first agreement, signed in March 1988, 
was brought to a more or less successful 
conclusion. The second, signed in May 1992, 
was revised midway through before being cut 
short. Morocco’s fishing resources were deple- 
ted, so that in view of the need to preserve 
stocks, the two parties agreed to scuttle the 
deal one year before it was due to run out. 
Nine months of tough negotiations ensued 
before a third agreement was signed in 
November 1995, which is still in force. The 
accord entitles the EU to new fishing rights off 
the Moroccan coast in return for a total of 500 
million Ecus, and the deal cannot be revised 
until it expires—a concession insisted on by 
Brussels to ensure the stability of the agree- 
ment, which calls for, among other things, the 
creation of a Moroccan-European commission 
that will meet once a year to make sure the 
accord is being followed and to settle disputes, 
if any. But the only time the commission has 
met was in 1996. A second meeting, in 
December 1997, was suspended after it had 
barely begun. 
Stressing the alarming drop in its fishing 
resources, which experts put at 27 per cent in 
1997, Morocco decided to unilaterally increase 
the replenishment period to four months instead 
of the two provided for in the agreement. On 27 
April, during Spanish prime minister José M aria 
Aznar’s visit to Rabat, his Moroccan counter- 
part, Abderrahman Youssoufi, said co-operation 
on fishing must take new forms in the future. 
And in May, Morocco’s fisheries minister ruled 
out any possibility of renewing the present 
agreement as it now stands. In the same breath, 
he decided to close the area along the Saharan 
coast between Boujdour and Dakhla to fishing 
for a one-year period, renewable if need be, in 
order to preserve sardine 
stocks. 
Both parties have 
conflicting and comple- the Ocean 
International Year of the Ocean (IYO), which has 
been proclaimed by the United Nations for 1998 
and for which UNESCO is the lead agency. 
IYO activities are designed to achieve three 
objectives: to make people aware that marine 
resources are not inexhaustible and that the 
ocean cannot absorb indefinitely all the pollu- 
tion caused by uncontrolled development; to 
persuade governments to give the oceans the 
priority they deserve; and to develop a more 
effective system of global scientific co-operation 
to improve our understanding and management 
of marine ecosystems and ocean resources. 
EXPO 98 is the most spectacular of the 
wide range of IYO activities, but there are 
many others. On [OC’s initiative, an Ocean 
Charter has been drawn up. This is not a legal- 
ly binding document but a declaration of com- 
mitment in which the signatories—governmen - 
tal authorities and private bodies—pledge to 
initiate and respect co-operative actions to pre- 
serve the oceans and coastal areas. UNESCO 
is also preparing an ocean education package 
and a beach clean-up project. IOC is preparing 
an overview of current scientific knowledge, 
the first phase of which will be published by the 
end of the year. Also in the works are an ency- 
clopaedia and an electronic atlas. Many coun- 
tries are contributing to I'YO, most important- 
ly by holding high-level scientific conferences 
on ocean-related matters. The calendar and the 
themes of these conferences are featured in the 
IYO website (http://www.unesco.org/ioc/iyo/ 
iyohome.htm). Research and training cruises 
are taking place aboard Russian, Norwegian,

dian, Malaysian and other vessels, which use

fishing industry employs 
150,000 people in 
Morocco and accounts 
for 15 per cent of the 
country’s exports. Fish 
stocks must clearly be 
preserved. On the other 
hand, European fisher- 
men, especially in Spain, 
see no alternative to their 
activities. That is why 
more precisely targeted 
accords are being sought,

has concluded with some

### 112531: Galley slaves

Galley slaves 
Recruited by unscrupulous shipowners to sail in rust buckets flying 
flags of convenience, many sailors leave their rights ashore. 
on is from Sri Lanka. I met him in the 
Greek port of Piraeus. A victim of his coun- 
try’s civil war, his wife and two of his three 
children were killed when someone blew up the 
bus they were on. To support his surviving child, 
Don decided to go to sea.In Madras,he embar- 
ked on a freighter bound for Canada. 
When the ship called at Halifax, Nova 
Scotia, Don checked the time it was due to 
leave before going ashore. But when he came 
back earlier than the scheduled embarkation 
time, the ship was gone. He had no identity 
papers—the captain had confiscated them 
when he signed up—and no money. He was 
taken in at a seamen’s hostel where he mana- 
ged to find legal assistance. 
To prove he was telling the truth, Don 
wrote a long, detailed report on the ship’s cargo 
and on events that had occurred during the 
voyage and gave the names of the rest of the 
crew. The document was sent to the Center for 
Seamen’s Rights in New York, where it was 
checked and certified as accurate. The 
Canadian agents of the ship’s Greek owner 
were ordered to buy Don a plane ticket home, 
but they refused to pay him his back wages. 
Don, who still works at sea despite his 
ordeal, is a modern-day galley slave—exploi- 
ted, badly paid or not paid at all—recruited by 
a front company to crew dilapidated ships 
often flying a flag of convenience. 
One-third of the world’s 37,000 cargo ships 
fly such flags. There is no link between the shi- 
powner and the country of registration. All the 
owner has to do is sign up at a consulate anyw- 
here in the world and pay. According to one 
London University transport economist,“com- 
panies register their ships under these flags so 
as to maximize profits and minimize costs by 
avoiding economic regulations and require- 
ments which apply to vessels registered in their 
own countries.” 
They are spoiled for choice—twenty-seven 
countries offer the facility, which is purely a 
matter of money. Registering a ship in Cyprus 
is 65 per cent cheaper than in Greece and even 
less expensive if the country chosen is a tax 
haven like Panama, Bermuda or Gibraltar. 
6 0 THE UNESCO COURIER 
Such flags mean there are no rules on hiring 
practices or working conditions to follow. The 
crews have no trade union protection or social 
security benefits. In fact, they have no rights at 
all. 
On the dockside in Piraeus, seamen from 
the Philippines, Malaysia, Ghana and Chile all 
had grim tales to tell. One man who refused to 
clean the ship’s toilets was tethered to the mast 
by a 1.5-metre chain for two days without 
water on the equator, and then locked in his 
cabin. Another told how his ship ran out of 
food for the last eight days of its voyage and the 
crew survived by catching a shark. Another sea- 
man recalled how his ship’s freezers, full of 
Senegalese shrimps, broke down and the crew 
had to eat their rotting contents day after day. 
Yet thousands compete for such jobs, ready 
to pay anything from $300 to $1,000 to be 
taken on, after buying a passport, seaman’s 
papers and sometimes an officer’s or engineer’ 
certificate, all of them available on the quiet at 
ports from Piraeus to Lagos. Some captains 
confiscate the crew’s papers as soon as they 
embark, reducing them to slaves. 
International organizations concerned with 
these issues have their work cut out.After more 
than a decade of negotiations, the United 
Nations Conference on Trade and 
Development (UNCTAD) drafted an interna- 
tional ship registration agreement in 1986 
aimed at preventing shipowners 
from dodging their responsibilities 
by vanishing into thin air whenever 
a problem arises. Twelve years later, 
it is still not in force because fewer 
than forty countries have ratified it. 
A code of conduct has been appro- 
ved by fifty-seven countries but 
rejected by those which offer flags 
of convenience. 
In 1996 the International 
Labour Organisation adopted 
seven new recommendations on the 
hiring of seamen and their pay, 
hours and working conditions. The 
countries that ratify them agree to 
carry out inspections and publish

Faced with advanced technology, laws full of |oo- 
pholes and the growing number of treasure hunters 
and sports divers, several international organizations, 
working under UNESCO's auspices, are drawing up an 
international convention to preserve underwater heri- 
tage. But what exactly would it aim to protect? 
According to a draft of the text presented in April 
1998 by the secretariats of UNESCO and the United 
Nations Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the 
Sea,” underwater cultural heritage means all traces of 
human existence, including sites, structures, artifacts, 
and human remains, together with their archaeologi- 
cal and natural contexts, as well as wrecks, such as 
vessels, aircraft or other vehicles or any part thereof, 
their cargo or other contents, together with their 
archaeological and natural heritage” 
But this definition “only applies to heritage which 
has been lost or abandoned and submerged for at 
least 100 years, explains Graham Henderson, the 
chairman of the International Council on Monuments 
and Sites’ (ICOMOS) International Commitiee on 
Underwater Cultural Heritage. “ It would be left up to 
states parties to introduce national legislation cove- 
ring sites underwater for less than this period. But it 
would leave the Titanic, which sank in 1912, for 
example, unprotected.Nor does it apply to any mifita- 
ry craft or their contents owned or operated by a 
state” 
The Titanic case also illustrates the problem of 
heritage sunk in international waters, where the “fin- 
ders keepers’ rule still prevails. The draft proposes 
three solutions, States could either exercise tighter 
control over the activities of their nationals; ban the 
use of their ports by ships engaged in improper exca- 
vations; or forbid the entry of improperly raised arti- 
facts into their territory. But the negotiating process is 
a long one and there is only a slender possibility that 
participants wiil agree on a final version of the

### 112532: Where the spirits roam

Where the 
spirits roam 
Esteban T. Magannon* 
For centuries the waves have shaped the lives of 
the Orang Laut, Moken and Bajau. How much longer 
can the traditions of these small Southeast Asian 
communities withstand the pressures of ‘modern’ 
62 THE UNESCO COURIER 
development? 
r outsiders, they are the “sea nomads”. 
Faia peaceful, simple folks, they are 
however mistrusted as fugitive pagan savages. 
Their houseboats look dirty, crowded with chil- 
dren, women cooking and a tangled mess of hou- 
sehold belongings likely to include a cackling 
rooster among the Bajau and a dog among the 
Moken. Moored along beaches, lagoons, estuaries 
and even the backwaters of beach-front hotels, 
their floating communities are scattered throu- 
ghout Southeast Asia. 
They form three distinct cultural groups 
stemming from archipelagic environments: the 
Orang Laut from estuaries of the Lingga-Riau- 
Straits of Malacca mudflats, the Moken from 
the Mergui Archipelago and the Bajau from the 
Sulu Archipelago of the Philippines, in the adjoi- 
ning islands of East Borneo, and those of eastern 
Indonesia, in particular the coasts of Celebes 
and Flores. 
Their numbers remain somewhat of a myste- 
ry, partly due to imprecise census-taking. While 
they are counted as citizens in the countries 
where they are found, they are considered as 
ethnic minorities subject to discrimination reser- 
ved for “outsiders”. 
Anthropologists put their total population at 
about 35,000. Yet they estimate that probably 
not even one third of this number still live by tra- 
dition—meaning with the sea, not simply on the 
sea, nor by it—because of sedentarization.T his 
distinction is important but often ignored as 
many anthropologists and others continue to 
oppose land and sea people, as if the two ways of 
life contradicted one another. The boat dwellers, 
in fact, oscillate between sea and land. 
The Moken compare themselves to their 
“mythical sister” the turtle. They live between 
two elements, water and land. Moored in a 
lagoon or the leeward edges of an island, their 
houseboats are removed from the threats of 
coastal predators but not far enough to be swept 
away by ebbing currents. 
 
With variations, their houseboats are the 
outriggers with mounted roofs common to 
Southeast Asia and the Pacific. The Moken 
kabang, for example, “are a marvel of ingenuity,” 
according to anthropologist Pierre Ivanoff who 
studied them in the 1950s and 1960s. “Stable, 
light, able to carry five to eight people, they are 
capable of withstanding the worst storms of the 
Indian Ocean. They are seven to ten metres 
long, and one and a half metres wide. . .. Not a 
single nail is used in construction: the various 
sections are secured with wood and bamboo 
pegs, strands of rattan or various creepers,” with 
palm leaves used for roofs and sails. 
Again to outsiders, the boats look crowded. 
There is barely enough room to stand, let alone 
walk. Older men find their legs gnarled from 
the lack of movement. Yet here we fall into the 
trap of comparing our perception of space on 
land and at sea with theirs. With endless hori- 
zons as a backdrop for the constant interplay 
between water, air and light, these people live 
open and free. 
The monsoons shape and regulate their lives. 
As the waves rise dangerously high with the 
rainy season, they seek the protection of the 
shore. The Orang Laut are settled on fixed sites 
in estuaries, while the Moken and Bajau move 
from one temporary mooring to another in 
lagoons or along beaches and the leeward edges 
of islands. This time is largely spent constructing

boats or repairing them, while food is found 
hunting wild pigs, gathering fruits and vege- 
tables and digging up tubers like yam. Once the 
dry season sets in, they ship off again. 
The Moken also move from island to 
island, hunting sea turtles and collecting sand 
worms, shellfish, and clams for food. But para- 
dox of paradoxes, they avoid the main fruit of 
the sea—fish! Sea-slugs are the closest they 
come and even these creatures are collected 
only to be sold to the Chinese, 
who love them. In contrast, the 
Orang Laut and the Bajau run 
after the fish, with the first group 
scouring estuary habitats and the 
second sifting through coral reefs 
and mangroves. 
Clearly, the sea represents 
life. Children are always born on the house- 
boats, never on land. They play either on the 
strands or swimming around the boats.Women 
would never think of cooking ashore, even 
during the rainy season when their boats are 
moored along beaches. 
In contrast, death and illness are bound to 
land. All of the sea people go ashore to heal or 
to bury their dead. Older people who feel that 
they have outlived their usefulness to the com- 
munity often discreetly ask to be left on a 
deserted isle to die. 
While spirits (hantu) roam everywhere—on

trees, under water and rocks, in caves and even 
the air, their sole requirement of the sea-people 
is respect. T he sea people believe that failure to 
respect the environment—the abode of the spi- 
rits—results in illness, conflict and death. A 
fisherman who dares to cast a net during the 
rainy season without performing the prescribed 
ritual inevitably suffers. The only cure lies in 
exorcism and appeasement. Basically, a shaman 
enters into a trance to invite the spirit to inhabit 
a wooden human image which is then brought 
to an island designated for the spirits. The dead 
are buried in common island cemeteries. 
These associations of illness and death do 
not mean that land is the domain of evil or suf- 
fering for the boat-dwellers. It simply signifies 
that there are things which belong to the land 
and activities which are better done ashore than 
on water. Thus, girls are named after tender flo- 
wers while boys’ names often reflect the strong 
qualities of trees or animals. 
However, through their contacts with coastal 
and plain dwellers, land has historically been a 
source of misfortune for sea people. They 
recount this in their songs, legends, and epics 
which are sad. They recollect how the Orang 
Laut, aside from taking care of the rulers’ hun- 
ting dogs and other menial duties, were practi- 
cally the indentured defenders of maritime 
routes for the great Kingdoms of the Straits of 
Malacca; how the Moken became pearl-divers 
for the Chinese, and the Bajau trepang (sea 
cucumber) collectors for the Tausug sultans. 
These tasks were considered to be lowly, worthy 
only of savages. And yet, had it not been for 
these specialized roles, the sea people would 
have lost their cultural identity long ago. 
Indeed, it looks as if fear of conversion to 
Islam, which swept the region from the four- 
teenth century on, greatly motivated the sea 
people to stay offshore. It is their best way of sur- 
viving and conserving their beliefs. All three 
groups are bound by a common thread: the 
opposition between us and them; Omang sama 
and Orang bagai, insiders and outsiders. 
Whereas their communities are structured on 
fleets organized around kinship principles, 
human relations are governed by the more fluid 
distinction between us and them. History has 
instilled in them a fear of those who do not 
belong to them. And their instinct is to flee— 
inevitably to the sea. 
Today, it is increasingly rare to find the 
Orang Laut, Moken, and Bajau at their habitual 
moorings. Once again, they are fleeing. From 
what? From the onslaughts of blast-fishing, from 
the conversion of traditional fishing and collec- 
ting grounds into industrial production plants. 
Will they survive this time? [|

Long a taboo subject, 
sexual violence is only now 
coming to be recognized as 
a crime against humanity. 
Will the proposed new 
International Criminal Court 
be able to bring the guilty 
to book? 
iolence against women during armed 
\/ cnn is nothing new. With other 
innocent victims—children and the 
elderly—they have always been on the front 
lines of wars of all kinds—religious wars, civil 
wars or world wars. Historians have described 
how soldiers have raped women to intimi- 
date civilian populations. But during this 
century the character of war has changed 
and this practice has become even more 
widespread. Where soldiers used to target 
other soldiers, the goalnow is often to kill or 
terrorize civilians. Various forms of sexual 
assault may occur during fighting or in 
conjunction with looting and other crimes 
by armed forces overrunning an area. Sol- 
diers may publicly rape women and detain 
them in special camps or brothels, where 
they can be tortured, raped and made pre- 
gnant. 
Overwhelming evidence 
There have been many examples of this 
kind of violence in the last decade. After 
Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, it was esti- 
mated that at least 5,000 Kuwaiti women 
were raped by Iraqi soldiers during the 
occupation. Two years later, shocking 
reports were published around the world 
about the use of rape and forced pregnan- 
cy as tools of “ethnic cleansing” in Bosnia. 
In 1994 and 1995, stories of sexual violen- 
ce in war again appeared in the world 
media, this time from Rwanda. One 
United Nations report estimated that as 
many as 500,000 women and girls suffered 
brutal forms of sexual violence, including 
gang-rape and sexual mutilation, after

which many of them were killed. In 
Algeria, the women of entire villages have 
been raped and killed. The government 
estimates that about 1,600 girls and young 
women have been kidnapped to become 
sexual slaves by roving bands from armed 
Islamic groups. 
While men may also be victims of rape 
and sexual mutilation during armed 
conflict, it is widely recognized that sexual 
violence is usually targeted specifically at 
women. But women are often reluctant to 
report rape, either because they fear the 
social stigma or because they feel that it is 
useless to report the crime in conditions of 
chaos and societal breakdown. The extent

Rwanda emerged approximately nine 
months after the genocide had ended, as 
women began bearing babies conceived as 
a result of rape. According to estimates of 
the Rwandan National Population Office, 
women who survived the genocide gave 
birth to between 2,000 and 5,000 children, 
who are often known as “enfants des mau- 
vais souvenirs’(children of bad memories). 
The same pattern is true of the former 
Yugoslavia, where women were raped until 
they were pregnant and then held until they 
were close to term. In 1993, it was estima- 
ted that between 1,000 and 2,000 women

Life must go on 
Juan Boggino and Diane Kolnikoff are psychotherapists at a counseling centre run by the Primo Levi 
organization in Paris which helps refugees who have been tortured.Some of them, like the Haitian 
woman who has just arrived at the centre, are victims of rape. “ She left her country after being 
raped in prison,” says Kolnikoff. “ She abandoned the child conceived during the rape and came to 
live alone in France. Since then,she has given birth to another baby, but still has thoughts of infan- 
ticide even though the second child has nothing to do with her past.” Hers is one of many heart- 
rending stories, such as that of an African woman who is “always dreaming she has a weight on 
top of her that keeps her from moving.” 
Even years later, “ the suffering never goes away,” says Boggino. It manifests itself as a “ deep 
breakdown of the individual and feelings of shame and humiliation that are especially strong since 
the crime was committed in front of witnesses the family, the village. Young women who were vir- 
gins at the time of the rape say no one will ever want them. It is impossible for them to imagine 
having a normal relationship with a man.” Horror gives way to the absurd. These women feel guil- 
ty rather than victimized. They cannot accept that “their torturers were the inhuman ones. They 
wonder why they survived while others died. They tell themselves their lives were spared because 
they let themselves be raped.” 
Nightmares, amenorrhoea, repeated illnesses, fear of physical contact and frigidity are the 
most common symptoms of their emotional suffering. For these women,silence is suffocating while 
speech is golden.It allows them to talk about what happened,to cry, to express their feelings and 
their anger. Speaking lets them separate themselves from the torture they went through explains 
Kolnikoff. It allows them to live “ with” rape rather than “in” it. After psychotherapy, some of them 
manage to feel comfortable with their bodies again,to give and receive pleasure and even to love 
the children “born of bad memories,” provided they accept them as their own. 
Talking about the rape also makes victims feel they have a right to point a finger of blame at 
the culprit,which allows them to shed feelings of guilt and shame. “But these women need to be 
believed. That’s where the law and the courts have a decisive role to play.” No cure is possible 
unless the rapists are named and brought to trial. S Bou m     ©

groups and then governments around the 
world to condemn these acts and call for 
an international tribunal to hold the per- 
petrators accountable. Following several 
Security Council resolutions condemning 
the massive, organized and systematic 
detention and rape of women, the 
International Criminal Tribunal for the 
Former Yugoslavia was founded in 1993. 
From the beginning, one of the purposes 
of setting up this court was to prosecute 
crimes of sexual violence. The tribunal 
was the first to recognize crimes of sexual 
violence as war crimes and as “grave 
breaches” imposing on states the duty to 
search for the allegedly guilty persons and 
bring them to court or extradite them for 
prosecution elsewhere. This is something 
new. Sexual violence is not explicitly cal- 
led a grave breach in the main law of war 
documents—the 1949 Geneva 
Conventions and their 1977 Additional 
Protocols. However, it is generally accep- 
ted that these crimes meet the criteria of 
“willfully causing great suffering or 
serious injury to body or health” and 
“torture or inhuman treatment”. 
Sexual violence can also be regarded as 
a crime against humanity, like murder, 
extermination, enslavement, deportation, 
imprisonment, torture or persecution, 
depending on the surrounding circum- 
stances. Historically however, crimes of 
sexual violence have rarely been prosecu- 
ted under any of these headings. One 
exception was the Tokyo World War II trial, 
where several Japanese officers were char- 
In northern Uganda, 8,000 children have been forced to 
join the “Lord’s Resistance Army” and many girls have 
been raped.

ged and held liable for the rape of 20,000 
women during the occupation of Nanking 
(China) in 1937. 
During the prosecutions of top-ranking 
World War II criminals at Nuremberg, rape 
was not listed as a crime against humanity. 
However, it was prosecuted in the national 
trials that followed Nuremberg, and it is 
now accepted as belonging on the list. 
Both the Yugoslav and Rwandan Tribunals 
explicitly include it in the definition of 
crimes against humanity. 
The experience of these two tribunals 
has demonstrated both the progress that 
has been made and the difficulties that have 
arisen in prosecuting crimes of sexual vio- 
lence. To date, twenty-six people have been 
charged with committing sexual atrocities; 
however, many of them are still at large. In 
June 1996, the first indictment dealing 
solely with sexual violence and enslavement 
crimes was issued. It alleges that, in 1992 
when the city of Foca (south-east of 
Sarajevo) was overrun by Serb forces, 
Muslim and Croat women were detained 
and repeatedly beaten and raped. Only one 
of the eight men accused in this indictment 
turned himself in to the tribunal. 
Few prosecutions 
Unfortunately, the Rwanda Tribunal has 
publicly charged only two people with 
crimes of sexual violence, both in 1997— 
three years after it was founded. The first 
was Jean-Paul Akayesu, the mayor of Taba 
commune. Even though there had been 
reports of widespread sexual abuse in 
Taba, he was not initially charged with 
these crimes, and it was not until witnesses 
testified about rape, and a coalition of 
human rights and women’s organizations 
submitted a brief, that the prosecutor 
amended the indictment to add sexual vio- 
lence to charges of genocide, crimes 
against humanity and war crimes. This is 
the first case before the Rwandan Tribunal 
in which someone is specifically charged 
with crimes of sexual violence, and the first 
to address the issue of a leader’s responsi- 
bility for encouraging or allowing others to 
commit rape. 
Governments are now in the process of 
finalizing the statute of a permanent 
International Criminal Court. This court 
will be able to build on the advances of the 
Yugoslav and Rwandan Tribunals and will 
hopefully reverse the historical trend. ®

same if prevention had been the only stra- 
tegy used? Could so much have been 
achieved with the same meagre funds 
allocated to the countries of the South, 
where per capita spending on Aids is 100 
times lower than in the developed world? 
Yet the European Commission, the 
leading international contributor to Aids 
programmes in the developing nations, 
and the World Bank, in its 1997 report 
Confronting Aids, say the money should be 
spent almost entirely on prevention. 
World Bank experts argue that treating 
Aids patients would be at the expense of 
caring for victims of other diseases which 
are just as deadly, especially since anti- 
Aids drugs are expensive and complicated 
  
to administer. At a time when govern- 
ments everywhere are scaling back their 
assistance to developing countries, insti- 
tutions are lowering their expectations 
and reasoning in terms of cost-effective- 
ness, thus losing sight of the problem’s 
ethical dimension. 
The ethical question exists at three 
levels. Considering the drop in public 
development aid, should funds be earmar- 
ked to pay for expensive Aids treatment? 
Should nothing be done until the new 
drugs are available for all? Given the high 
cost of retroviral drugs, would it be right 
to select some patients for treatment and 
not others? It will take at least another ten 
years to develop an HIV vaccine. In the 
meantime, something must be done.

As Aids continues to spread 
in most countries of the 
South, should its victims be 
deprived of access to 
treatment? A moral case is 
increasingly being voiced 
against the cost-effective 
approach to medicine. 
Right now, access to care in the vast 
majority of developing countries is limi- 
ted at best to treatment for opportunistic 
infections. Moreover, medical treatment 
is usually not free, so the poorest people 
have no access to it. Do we have the right 
to ignore the plight of these suffering mil- 
lions? A recent study in Thailand showed 
that the rate of HIV transmission from 
mother to foetus could be halved by 
administering AZT over a short period to 
pregnant women before they give birth. 
Since 550,000 babies are born with the 
HIV virus each year, it is easy to imagine 
how many lives AZT could save. 
High stakes 
The debate has been raging for some 
time. Arnaud Marty-Lavauzelle, presi- 
dent of Aides, a French non-governmen- 
tal organization,says it started at the 1994 
international conference on Aids in 
Yokohama. “We really became aware that 
it wasn’t enough to rely on prevention 
strategies alone,” he says. “With the new 
drugs and the need to transform the 
disease’s image, we believed it was neces- 
sary . . . to include the dimension of 
access to care.” Specialists increasingly 
blame the failure of prevention pro- 
grammes on the lack of simultaneous 
treatment. Indeed, it is difficult to see 
how prevention could work if no treat- 
ment is offered after a positive HIV test. 
The idea that prevention and treatment 
must go hand-in-hand to provide an 
across-the-board response to the epide- 
mic is making headway. “Of course pre- 
vention is essential. But it would be une- p

thical and counter-productive to write off 
the millions of people with Aids as a lost 
cause. The long-standing dichotomy bet- 
ween prevention and care is really a thing 
of the past,” says Dr. Awa Marie Coll 
Seck, director of the United Nations’ 
UN Aids programme. 
On 5 November 1997, UNAIids 
announced the start of an initiative aimed 
at improving access to HIV drugs in deve- 
loping countries. Four countries—Viet 
Nam, Uganda, Chile and Cote d’Ivoire— 
are taking part. To implement the pilot 
programmes they will have to gear their 
health care infrastructures and drug distri- 
bution systems to the special needs crea- 
ted by HIV, and their ministries of health 
will have to provide the bulk of the fun- 
ding. African organizations of people 
living with the Aids virus are hopeful that 
retroviral drugs will soon be available in 
their countries, but so far none of the pilot 
programmes has really got under way. 
Political overtones 
The debate has spilled over into the politi- 
cal arena, which may speed things up. On 
7 December French President Jacques 
Chirac, addressing the 10th pan-African 
conference on Aids, in Abidjan (Cote 
d’Ivoire), said, “it would be shocking, 
unacceptable and contrary to the most

two-speed approach to Aids. . . . We must 
do all we can to extend the benefits of the 
new treatments to needy people in Africa 
and the rest of the world.” The next day 
private sources may also be tapped, but 
everyone knows they will not be enough. 
That is why the priority is treating pre-

is French health minister Bernard Kouchner 
suggested setting up an International 
Therapeutic Solidarity Fund with the aim 
of making access to treatment easier. T he 
fund was discussed at length during the 
G8 summit held in Birmingham (UK) 
from 15 to 17 May. The snag: finding the 
$5 billion funding. That may take some 
time, although several promising leads are 
already being explored. For example, the 
multinational pharmaceutical company 
Glaxo Wellcome has announced it will 
supply pregnant HIV-positive women in 
developing countries with AZT at 50 to 70 
per cent below the usual price. The reason 
for this sudden burst of philanthropy is 
that new outlets must be found for drugs 
that no longer work in the developed 
countries, and the economies of scale 
resulting from the potentially broader 
market make the price cut possible. Other 


### 112536: Children behind bars

Children 
behind bars 
A minor in Madagascar has been serving a two-year prison sentence since 1996 for stea- 
the virus by 40 to 50 per cent. “It would 
be irresponsible to promise treatment for 
everyone,” says Dr. Coll Seck. “The 
important thing is to make a start. The 
people and organizations that became 
involved in the fight against Aids early on, 
in spite of the social stigma involved, as 
well as pregnant women, should be consi- 
dered priorities.” 
What about the others? The debate 
has come out in the open during the past 
few months, but there is hardly any doubt 
that many people will still be left out. 
“The only humanistic policy that can be 
imagined in the future,” says Marty- 
Lavauzelle, “is to match globalization of 
profits with globalization of responsibili- 
ties.” Fine words, but for the moment 
they are no more than that. [|

ling a pineapple. He’s lucky. In another country he might have been immediately put 
to death, like the homeless child in the village of Kounbra (Chad),who was found 
lying in a pool of blood and abandoned to the mercy of a pig, on a soccer field.In January 
1997 he was shot for petty theft,says the human rights group International Prison Watch 
(IPW).T he organization’s report on children in prison, published in May 1998, describes 
conditions in the 51 countries where data are available. 
No one knows exactly how many children are imprisoned around the world, and for 
good reason. The question is too thorny, and the definition of a minor varies from one 
country to the next. In South Africa, Bangladesh, Ireland, Pakistan and some states in 
the United States, seven-year-old children are held responsible for criminal acts. In 
Mali, Romania, the United Kingdom, Turkey and Viet Nam the age varies from ten to 
fourteen.In Mauritania and Luxembourg, children can be detained at any age. In 1995 
nearly 70,000 minors were incarcerated in the United States, and in 1997 there were 
1,200 in prison in South Africa and between 15,000 and 20,000 in Indonesia. 
Sometimes placed in the same penitentiary facilities as adults, minors are the vic- 
tims of many abuses. In Mauritania cases have been reported of children who are strip- 
ped naked, bound hand and foot, exposed to the sun and beaten with truncheons or 
electric cords. In American prisons, 40,000 minors are raped each year. 
In the southern countries, their diet is usually spartan. In Burundi, for example, 
they are entitled to just one 300-gramme ration of beans or manioc flour a day. National 
legislation makes provision for medical care, but the reality is quite different. In some 
Russian prisons, scabies, tuberculosis and typhus are rampant among minors. 
At Tongi prison in Bangladesh, young inmates receive training. Yet in a wealthy 
country like Luxembourg, no provision is made for their education. 
Generally speaking, none of the countries mentioned in the IPW report has found 
a just way to treat minors who have broken the law. SAO. H

road to the free market. 
e situation started to change shortly 
Tex the break-up of the Soviet 
Union. The key event was the aboli- 
tion of censorship in 1989 which sparked 
off a publishing boom. New co-operatives 
joined the 300 state-owned publishing com- 
panies, printing massive editions (from 
50,000 to 100,000 copies) of works by pre- 
viously banned authors including Akhma- 
tova, T svetayeva, Mandelstam, Berdyayev 
and Solovyev. Foreign literature publishing 
also took off, as large numbers of pirate edi- 
tions were published, often of poor quality. 
The number of publishing companies rose 
to almost 6,000 in 1993, but so many of 
them were putting out the same works that 
the market was soon flooded. 
The first years of the decade provided a 
foretaste of things to come. But perestroika 
did not really get into full swing until 1992,

control over the industry, but set up a kind 
of share-holding system in which it could 
pull strings while offloading some ofits finan- 
cial burden.When this happened, the myth 
of the flourishing Soviet publishing industry 
collapsed. Under the old regime, print runs 
of some titles were enormous and tiny for 
the rest; editorial decisions were made arbi- 
trarily and party literature was given pride of 
place,automatically bought by the unions, 
sent free of charge to municipal and rural 
libraries and shipped to the people’s republics 
of eastern Europe. Those days were over. 
This first stage showed that publishing 
was in a shaky condition. It is true that lack 
of market experience and the new economic 
situation were obstacles to profitability. T he 
sudden cuts in state subsidies, the break- 
up of the centralized distribution system, 
soaring costs of paper, production and ship- 
ping dealt a death-blow to the one-time 
giants of Soviet publishing such as Sovetsky 
Pisatel, Molodaya Gvardya, Progress and 
Detskaya Literatura, which specialized in 
books for young people. Between 1990 and 
1993 the number of published titles plum- 
meted from 41,000 to 29,000 and the num- 
ber of copies printed fell from 1.5 billion to 
950 million. 
The new Russia tried to give publishing 
a second chance. A bill relating to publi- 
shers’ and authors’ rights was passed in 
1993, and a federal law concerning aid to 
publishing and the media, which provided 
for privatization, tax breaks and other finan- 
cial incentives, came into force on 1 January 
1996. This legislation spurred on the pri- 
vate sector, which today produces nearly 
two-thirds of the books published in Rus- 
sia—a total of 420 million copies and more 
than 36,000 titles. 
An uphill job 
But these figures are just one side of the 
coin. The Russian publishing industry is 
still beleaguered by a host of problems, often 
related to the drop in purchasing power. 
Russian citizens cannot afford to buy books, 
even school textbooks. What is more, many 
local publishers are not in a position to sup- 
ply the fragmented market,so that there is 
a flagrant imbalance between the country’s 
central regions and the outlying areas, espe- 
cially Siberia and the Far East.In the cen- 
tral areas, the number of books available 
per inhabitant is in the hundreds. On the 
periphery, it is less than twenty. What’s more, 
the January 1996 law is arbitrarily applied 
and publishers rarely benefit from the advan- 
tages it offers. Even public sector publishing 
companies are feeling the pinch. In 1996-97, 
only twenty-five books were published with 
state participation.And most of them were 
printed to commemorate Moscow’s 850th 
anniversary. 
For the most part, these aberrations 
penalize small- and medium-sized compa- 
nies. Large firms are doing quite well,espe- 
cially if they reach a wide public. Science 
fiction, thrillers and love stories, once almost 
impossible to find, are best-sellers today. 
Demand is rising, especially because these 
books cost between 12 and 15 roubles (from 
$2 to $2.50, as of 15 June)—the average 
salary in Moscow is 1,000 roubles a month 
($164) and from 300 to 500 roubles ($49 to 
$82) a month elsewhere in Russia. 
There is also a flourishing market for 
cookbooks, do-it-yourself books, health Pp

books and travel guides, with the private 
companies Eskimo, Olma-Press, AST press, 
Armada and Centrpoligrafin the lead. The 
best-selling university textbooks, which cost 
an average of 20 roubles,are on law, busi- 
ness, finance and information technology. 
The main publishing companies in this area, 
which include Infra-M, Spark, Financy i 
Statisika and Prior, are also in the private 
sector. These new leaders in mass publi- 
shing have also solved distribution problems. 
Most of them have their own warehouses, 
transportation and computerized sales 
management systems. 
With print runs of 15,000 to 20,000 
copies, Vagrius and Terra,the main literary 
publishers, are able to sell their books at 
competitive prices ranging from 20 to 30 
roubles. They also work with wholesalers 
and have an extensive point of sale network 
in Moscow and the regions. 
The situation is quite different for publi- 
shers such as Sabascnikov, whose print runs 
are 5,000 copies or less. It is hard for them 
to make a profit, especially since their books 
are produced in Italy and sold in Russia. At 
50 roubles each, these publishers are having 
a hard time winning market share. Since 
their books sell poorly, they cannot start 
many new projects and have to make do 
with publishing three or four titles a year. 
Rethinking 
the book industry 
In addition to shipping costs and commis- 
sions skimmed off by wholesalers, small 
companies have to cope with the prohibitive 
borrowing terms laid down by Russian 
banks, which charge from 40 to 60 per cent 
interest a year. The 17 per cent interest rates 
of the European Bank for Reconstruction 
and Development are attractive, but those 
loans are hard to come by. 
Authors are also going through hard 
times. There are no literary agencies in Rus- 
sia, and writers have as much trouble finding 
a publisher as defending their rights. This is 
true even for successful authors like Alexan- 
der Marinina,who has been dubbed “king 
of the thriller”. Beginners are even worse 
off. Literary awards such as the Bouker and 
Antibouker prizes usually go to established 
authors and publishers. 
Where translation is concerned there is 
also alot of catching up to do. Money is the 
decisive factor,and publishers favour clas- 
sics because they cannot afford to pay copy- 
right and promotional costs. Grants from 
the Soros Foundation and France’s Pushkin 
programme have funded new translations of

### 112538: Togouna week in Djenné

Togouna week in Djenné 
e people of Djenné (Mali) will remember Heritage Week for a long time.From 12 
to 18 May, decision makers, researchers and local representatives gathered in the 
ancient town, which has been on UNESCO ’sWorld Heritage List since 1988, to dis- 
cuss ways of preserving its remarkable earthen architecture while taking the residents’ 
needs into account.“Togouna” week,named after a Dogon concept meaning a place for 
dialogue, thought and exchange, was organized by the ministry of culture, sponsored by 
Adam Ba Korané, wife of the chief of state and a historian,and chaired by the minister of 
culture,Aminata Dramane Traoré. According to Sirandou Bocoum,a representative of a 
Djenné women’s group, “Difficult restoration rules are imposed on us. We are not allowed 
to change the present dimensions of our houses, but they are very small. Today we need spa- 
cious living rooms to entertain guests. T he old entrance halls just won’t do anymore. A little 
modernity won’t make our architecture any less authentic,” she says, adding that the rules 
are forcing the townspeople to live in a “perpetual ghetto”. Papa Sy, chairman of an orga- 
nization called D jenné-Patrimoine (D jenné-Heritage), shares her point of view. “The 
main thing,” he says, “is to preserve the facades and other aspects of the appearance of our 
homes. The rest should be up to the owner to decide.” 
Heritage Week participants demanded that restoration projects underway be redesi- 
gned to satisfy the townspeople’s needs. But above all, they asked to take part in futu- 
re heritage management projects. Making cultural heritage profitable was also discus- 
sed during “Togouna” week. To spread the benefits among as many people as possible, 
it is necessary to promote local creativity and the development of economic activities 
linked to tourism, such as crafts. 
Admittedly, that is a tall order. Meanwhile, Djenné’s Heritage Week proved that 
people are more likely to accept a participatory approach to heritage management than 
the top-to-bottom decision-making that has been the rule until now. As the minister of 
culture said, the aim of preservation is to foster sustainable human development that 
combines economics with culture. Bamba Kiabou H

Modern tourism is a mixed blessing for an extraordinary complex of medieval churches 
hewn from the living rock of the Ethiopian highlands.

there are buildings that to my 
mind are unlike any to be seen 
elswhere in the world and in such great num- 
ber. There are churches hewn entirely out of 
the living rock, which is sculpted with great 
ingenuity.” Francisco Alvarez, the chaplain 
of an early sixteenth-century Portuguese 
diplomatic mission to Abyssinia, hesitated to 
say more about the wonders he had beheld 
in Lalibela. Had he found the words, he 
thought,no one would have believed him. 
Lalibela is a medieval monastic com- 
plex perched at an altitude of 2,700 
metres, where the sky meets volcanic rock 
that solidified as it flowed down the 
mountainside. It is a holy city inspired by 
a dream, which may explain its airy grace 
and the awe visitors feel when they behold 
it. Legend has it that King Lalibela was 
born in Roha,on the site of the little town 
of 10,000 inhabitants which today bears 
his name, some 700 kilometres from 
Ethiopia’s capital, Addis Ababa. At his 
birth, a swarm of bees enveloped him, 
thus giving rise to his name, which means 
“the bees know he will be great.” During 
Lalibela’s childhood the 
Ethiopia was occupied by his brother 
who, fearing the oracle’s words would 
come true, poisoned him. The young 
prince fell into a coma that lasted three 
days. This “near-death experience”, as it 
would be called today, was regarded as a 
miracle. God had Lalibela brought up to 
heaven and ordered him to have churches 
hewn out of the living rock. In the early 
twelfth century, when Christians despai- 
red at seeing Jerusalem fall into the hands 
of the Muslims, Lalibela came to the 
throne and had eleven monolithic 
churches carved out of the pink tufa. 
throne of 
1. Today known as Yemrehana-Krestos. Editor 
French archaeologist Francis Anfray, 
who has spent thirty-two years in 
Ethiopia, says, “This imposing complex of 
churches is the only one of its kind in the 
world,” which is one reason why Lalibela 
is on UNESCO’s World Heritage List. 
Another is that it’s a living site where 350 
priests, 250 deacons, 450 monks and 400 
students still work, study and worship. The 
religious services held there have not 
changed in 800 years. Ethiopia’s Ortho- 
dox Christians consider it a second Holy 
Land. The local stream is even called the 
Jordan and there is a mountain named 
Mount Tabor. Ethiopia’s leading pilgrima- 
ge site, Lalibela sometimes welcomes 
20,000 to 50,000 believers at a time, espe- 
cially during the peak Christmas, Epi- 
phany and Easter seasons. Many of them 
trek to the complex on foot.

withstood wars, invasions and the torren- 
tial rains that drench the highlands from 
June to September. But as the twentieth 
century draws to a close, Lalibela’s rock 
churches face new threats. They will need 
the protection of Egzia Beher, the 
Ethiopian Christians’ word for God, to 
survive the expected wave of tourists. 
“The government wants Lalibela to 
attract as many visitors as possible,” says 
Jara Haile Mariam, director of cultural 
heritage at the culture and information 
ministry. The goal is to help offset the 
area’s extreme poverty. Tarja Laine, of 
Finland, has carried out a detailed study 
of the site and co-ordinates a develop- 
ment project managed by the Finnida co- 
operation agency. “The environment is 
extremely eroded,” she says. “It will not 
support any more forestry or farming. 
Tourism is the only way for the people to 
upgrade their living conditions.” 
Right now, most of the population 
lives below the poverty line and 97 per 
Priests and people of Lalibela wait for their churches to be restored.

cent suffers from malnutrition. The infant 
mortality rate is 153 per thousand and 68 
per cent of the inhabitants can neither 
read nor write. One adult in three is 
unemployed and most of the rest eke out 
a living selling firewood or as day labou- 
rers. The churches are the town’s only real 
source of wealth. In addition to the clergy 
and students associated with them, they 
provide work for those members of the 
community who live from the tourist 
trade. An entrance ticket costs 100 birrs 
($12) for a non-Ethiopian, which is twice 
the monthly wage of half the inhabitants 
of Lalibela. A young guide can earn more 
in three hours than his father does in a 
month! But the site still only draws 
10,000 tourists a year, who spend an ave- 
rage of two days there. They complain 
about poor sanitation infrastructures, 
rude and underqualified guides, harass- 
ment from beggars and high admission 
prices. 
‘In the long run tourism 
will kill Lalibela, just as it 
has killed Mont Saint- 
Michel in France. We 
must try to limit the 
damage. ’ 
Still, medieval Lalibela is slowly but 
surely catching up with the twentieth cen- 
tury. Five years ago it was impossible to 
reach the medieval complex by road 
during the rainy season.A few kilometres 
from the centre, an acacia tree still cast its 
shade over the single, narrow, red clay 
airstrip. Since 1997 a new road has led to

not have enough influence to control

says “there 1s a conflict between conser va-

government bodies in charge of tourism 
and planning should be more sensitive to 
the preservation of heritage. 
“In the long run tourism will kill 
Lalibela the same way it killed Mont Saint

the same disorderly way if we don’t give 
the inhabitants and tour operators guide- 
lines for protecting the perimeter around 
the churches.” Mariam is campaigning for 
the creation of “satellite villages” but ack- 
nowledges that Ethiopia is too poor to 
fund new infrastructures. 
But the worst-case scenario can still 
be avoided. “No irreparable damage has 
kd 
been done,” Laine says reassuringly. 
What’s more, increased tourism could 
spur intelligent development of the site. 
According to a 1996 study conducted for 
Finnida, visitors are overwhelmingly in 
favour of protecting the perimeter around 
the churches, which they fear will turn 
into a “Holy Hollywood.” Sixty per cent 
complained about the churches’ poor 
condition and 83 per cent regret that they 
are covered by shelters—sheet metal and 
wooden structures that will, it is hoped, 
prevent leaks from further damaging the 
landmarks until a better solution is found. 
“They’ve been talking about restoring the 
churches for thirty years,” Anfray says. 
“Work financed by an American founda- 
tion started under the auspices of UNES-

Political instability and the top-to-bot-

were implemented in 1995 and 1996, 
heritage preservation fell to the federal 
ministry of culture, but carrying out the 
projects and local planning schemes are 
within the province of the region. There is 
also interference from the newly created 
municipality and the clergy, without 
whom nothing can be accomplished in

European Commission, both of which are 
involved in developing Lalibela, have 
conflicting preservation priorities. 
UNESCO cannot afford to restore the 
rock churches, and restoration falls outsi- 
de the Commission’s sphere. All the 
European Commission can do, says 
Anastase Zacharas, who is in charge of 
the dossier at the European Commission, 
1s safeguard Ethiopia’s tourist potential. 
Conflicting priorities 
Europe is going to funnel 4.7 million of the 
200 million Ecus it has earmarked for 
development in Ethiopia between 1996 
and 2000 largely into the construction of 
attractive high-tech shelters to cover the 
churches. The process is underway. 
Architecture firms around the world have 
been invited to tender bids, the winner will 
be announced in March 1999 and the 
shelters will be completed by December 
2000. This will leave a million and a half 
Ecus, which will be used to carry out stu- 
dies on the reasons why the churches and 
the trenches that once formed a water drai- 
  
 
Will the rock-hewn churches weather the tourist I, 
nage network have deteriorated and to pay 
specialists. Meanwhile, UNESCO and the 
Ethiopian department of preservation of 
cultural heritage would like to see restora- 
tion work begin. Their experts have appro- 
ved a pilot project calling for the use of tra- 
ditional building methods and unsuccess- 
fully tried to include it in the European 
Union’s package. “We have a lot of money 
for the shelters but much less for conserva- 
tion. There is no choice. It doesn’t make 
sense. People have been waiting for years 
for the churches to be repaired. We have to 
produce something or we lose credibility,” 
Haile Mariam says regretfully. 
“Our bureaucratic systems are too 
rigid to fund small-scale operations like 
pilot projects,” says Zacharas, who 
believes the shelters are a necessary but 
temporary evil.“They’ll be able to protect 
the churches for ten years. Then Ethiopia 
will have to find the money to fund the 
work.” In other words, it won’t be starting 
tomorrow. But heaven can wait. . . . [|

### 112540: Satellites for the South

Satellites for the South 
Beaming multimedia radio by satellite to the four billion 
people living in the South is even more challenging than it 
sounds. 
do it in one mouthful,” says Noah 
Samara.“ You have to eat it bit by bit.” 
For the past seven years, he has been using this 
little-by-little approach to spread digital radio 
by satellite around the world. 
With an almost missionary zeal and 
dogged skill, Mr. Samara heads 
Worldspace, a company whose aim is to 
bring the rich man’s radio to an audience of 
the poor. The project was initially designed 
for Africa but later expanded to include the 
more economically buoyant countries of 
the South. 
Worldspace will provide a broad range 
of programmes transmitted digitally and by 
satellite, with CD-quality sound, to four 
billion people who live in developing coun- 
tries. Each satellite will carry three groups 
of 100 frequencies, making it possible to 
transmit around 100 stereo channels. This 
is a revolution in regions where the choice 
is still very limited (one station for every 
30,000 people in North America, compa- 
red to just one for every two million in the 
Third World). “We want to create a show- 
case for local cultures,” says Samara, a 
forty-one-year-old American Muslim of 
Sudanese-Ethiopian origin.“T oday the sta- 
tions of the North dominate the South. But 
I'm sure amazing things are happening in 
Kenya which would interest people in 
Senegal, for example.” 
The programmes are picked up by 
small portable receivers with a tiny satellite 
antenna and, beginning in the year 2000, a 
colour screen for multimedia (words, pic- 
tures and sound). The receivers can be 
plugged into a personal computer and 
receive personal messages. Four major 
Japanese companies—H itachi, Matsushita, 
Sanyo and Victor—recently signed deals to 
manufacture and sell the devices. 
Washington-based Worldspace has rai- 
sed $850 million from investors, whose 
identity is a closely-guarded secret, ordered 
three big satellites from the French firm 
Alcatel and signed launch contracts with 
Arianespace. T he first satellite will go into

orbit over Africa in October 1998 and the 
two others over Asia and Latin America in 
1999. 
“The appealing thing about Worldspace 
is that they really know how to sell their 
product,” enthuses Arnaud Littardi, head 
of international affairs 
at Radio France 
International. “The 
combination of satellite 
and digital technology 
is where the future 
lies,” says Littardi. “But 
there are three big question marks. First, we 
can’t be sure of how good reception will be 
in urban areas. The signal can be blocked 
by buildings, tunnels and so on. Worldspace 
says there are solutions, such as earth- 
based retransmission of the signal.” But this 
would make the system too expensive. 
The second, perhaps most important 
question, is whether people will buy the 
receivers. “It’s a gamble because all new 
technology penetrates the market at the 
top, in the rich countries, and then spreads 
downwards, first to the elites in the poor 
  
"The combination of 
satellite and digital 
technology is where the 
future lies’ 
countries, and then to the rest of the popu- 
lation,” says Littardi. “Worldspace is trying 
to do the opposite. It will all depend on the 
selling price of the receivers.” 
Samara reckons that the consumer will 
have to pay about $200 to start with, 
“which is an astronomical sum for most 
Africans. But even if the price never drops, 
there are already 300 million households 
which can afford it in the area we’re cove- 
ring. And in five years, it should be selling 
for under $50.” 
Lastly, says 
Littardi, “how much 
are the broadcasters 
willing to pay? Renting 
space on all three satel- 
lites will cost us several 
million dollars a year. 
Such an investment will only pay off if we 
can resolve the first two questions. So we're 
waiting to see what happens.” 
They're not the only ones. Worldspace 
has already rented out frequencies to seve- 
ral national radio networks and signed part- 
nership agreements with major media 
groups, but most broadcasters still have to 
be convinced.“We’ve negotiated less than a 
fifth of our capacity,” says Samara. “We 
start turning a profit when we can rent out 
a frequency at $50 an hour. But we're also 
counting on income from things like agree-

ments with broadcasters to share adverti-

to personalized services.” 
He also seems to be counting on bac- 
king from international donors, thanks to 
the Worldspace Foundation, created in 
1997 with a $1.5-million corporate dona- 
tion. The aim is to find partners to make 
five per cent of the frequencies available for 
educational and development programmes, 
starting in Africa. 
“Worldspace, UNESCO and other 
international bodies, non-governmental 
organizations and governments are working 
to identify the best programmes to promo- 
te peace, health, and environmental 
concerns as well as the rights of women and 
children,” says Samara. Easier said than 
done. 
Bernard Loing, president of Atena, a 
distance education organization, cites the 
Olympus satellite experiment in Europe in 
the late 1980s. “We paid a lot of attention to 
what we were offering, but not much to the 
needs and wishes of our potential custo- 
mers. We knew how to beam a second-year 
university chemistry course but we didn’t 
know who would be interested in receiving 
it. We can’t do that kind of thing again. 
Programming must be geared to demand.” 
This is why Worldspace is consulting 
education ministers in Africa, as well as

Flat Linux 
_ 
  
A beacon in the world of free software, Linux is used by 
an estimated seven million people worldwide. Enthusiasts 
say this operating system is a refreshing alternative to 
commercial software. 
  
hen LinusTorvalds created a “free” 
WwW operating system called Linux in 
1991, little did the young Finnish 
student imagine he would become the stan- 
dard-bearer of a crusade to preserve the open- 
ness and co-operative spirit that have been the 
basis of the Internet’s and the World Wide 
Web's success, in the face of “big, bad Bill 
Gates’s” schemes to make them part of his 
empire. 
Defenders of the spirit of the networks, 
which grew out of public research, say 
information technology can and must be at 
least partly protected from market forces. 
At stake are the free movement of ideas 
and the dynamism of research. “Free soft- 
ware 1s an area of technical work, but 
above all, it is a matter of ethical philoso- 
phy,” says Richard Stallman, an American 
computer pioneer and head of the Free 
Software Foundation. 
“Computer pro- 
  
figure out how theyre made. This control 
over standards kills competition and fetters 
creativity, whereas freeware is a source of 
constant innovation.” 
Linux proves the point. Available free 
of charge on the Internet, it is part of cybe- 
rhumanity’s shared heritage. T he program-

What do the Great Wall of China,Mont Saint Michel,the rice paddies and terraces of the Philippines, 
Timbuktu and the Grand Canyon have in common? They and other world heritage sites are waiting 
for you on UNESCO's website! 
If you want to do more than just visit,the website will answer all your questions about this truly 
universal and changing concept,such as:what is the World Heritage List and how does a site get on 
it? what legal instruments help protect the sites? which sites are the most threatened, and why? As a

inno vation 
even on slower compu- 
ters. Linux meets three 
freeware criteria. Its 
source code is available, 
so anyone can take part in developing it or 
can modify it to suit their needs; it can be 
freely copied and redistributed; and anyo- 
ne can improve it, as long as they make the 
source code for the changes available to 
everyone. 
“Linux isn’t just one big entity,” says 
Robert Young, president of Redhat 
Software, an American firm that distri- 
butes the product. “It’s a collection of lots 
of little parts. Each has its own team of 
programmers on the Internet and a team 
leader who approves or rejects the altera- 
tions suggested. And the ultimate boss is 
Torvalds.” 
Linux enthusiasts, most of them engi- 
neers and science students, unanimously 
laud the product. “It’s quick, compact and 
very secure—a huge asset if you want to 
create a patent data base or a secure pay- 
ment system. It’s a far cry from the 
Microsoft equivalent, Windows NT, which 
has security gaps,” says Jean Roure of 
Acticiel, a French company that designs 
websites. “Personally, I'm not waging war 
on Microsoft,” he adds. “I just want to give 
my customers the best of the Internet and 
Linux lets me do that. If a private firm came 
up with a better offer, I'd pay the price.” 
“We're fighting Microsoft, the most 
aggressive firm and the one best at marke- 
ting its products,” says Young. “So why are

companies turning to Linux? Because it 
doesn’t crash and it works very well. And 
why is it so good? Because it has the worl- 
d’s biggest team of software engineers who 
are constantly improving it, just for the 
love of it.” That’s the spirit of the cyber- 
community. “Free software is a communi- 
ty project and everyone who depends on it 
ought to look for ways to contribute to 
building the community,” says Stallman. 
People who work on it don’t make money 
but they do earn a reputation—not such a 
bad deal. Torvalds was an unknown stu- 
dent in Helsinki. Because of Linux, every 
firm mn Silicon Valley wanted to hire him 
when he graduated. Today he is working at 
Transmeta, a new American high-tech 
company. 
Another big advantage Linux offers is 
efficient “after-giveaway service.” “If you 
have a problem,” says Roure, “you log on 
to a discussion group and even at two in 
the morning you’ll always find someone 
who knows someone who has an answer. 
It’s free and takes 20 minutes. If theres a 
hacker attack, for example, the group will 
tell you ‘here’s how to defend yourself.’ It’s 
invaluable. With commercial software, 
you're completely at 
the company’s mercy 
and it may be weeks 
before you get an ans-

Linux’s major 
selling point: 
_ 
according to Roure. “It’s still primarily 
used for complex applications like setting 
up network servers or for simulation. By 
the way, it was used to create most of the 
special effects in Titanic.” 
Young explains, “Most companies 
want a specific application—for example a 
firm of architects wants a drawing pro- 
gramme—and only afterwards bother 
about what operating system it uses. Linux 
has far fewer applications than Windows 
and that’s the main problem. But it’s only 
been in professional use since 1995 and 
things are changing very quickly.” 
The outlook for Linux is bright. A 
number of private firms are starting to live 
off it. They are prospering and creating 
jobs by offering Linux users services for a 
fee. A case in point is Redhat Software, 
with 40 employees and a $6 million turno- 
verin 1997, a figure expected to rise to $10 
million this year. Founded in 1995, Redhat 
specializes in custom-made systems and 
sells Linux on a CD-ROM updated every 
six months. “We're playing with 450 pro- 
grammes,” says Young, “including com- 
mercial software compatible with Linux. 
We put it together according to our custo- 
mers’ needs and set an 
overall framework. In 
1997 we had 150,000 
customers, 80,000 of 
wer.” efficient them in the U.S. and 
Another fan is ‘after-givea way’ 50,000 in Europe. Our 
Lectra-Systémes, the service CD-ROM costs $50, or 
world’s leading com- 
puter-assisted textile 
manufacturer, which recently started using 
Linux. “The system is generally popular 
with our customers,” says Pierre Ficheux, 
a senior executive with the company, 
“especially the ones who don’t know any- 
thing about computers and think it’s 
Windows!” With no head office, no stock 
exchange quotation and no advertising 
visibility, Linux makes some people feel 
uneasy. “We don’t use Microsoft much, 
but we’ve kept it to reassu- 
re our customers,” says 
Roure. “People think any- 
thing that’s free must be 
irresponsible.” 
Linux’s main draw- 
back is its complexity. 
“Most computer-illiterate 
people don’t know how to 
use it, although installa- 
tion is getting easier and 
the number of simple, 
automated office-type 
applications is on the rise,”   
nothing if you down- 
load it from the 
Internet, which is what most of our two 
million or so users do.” 
So why pay? “It’s like asking people 
who buy bottled water why they don’t 
drink it out of the tap. The answer is that 
they don’t trust it. We're also selling simple 
installation as well as trouble-shooting in 
case of a problem.” 
Young is keeping a cool head under his 
red hat. The battle against the Microsoft 
empire has not been won 
yet. “So far they haven’t 
caused us any trouble,” 
he says. “That’s a bad 
sign. They see us as an 
interesting, but not very 
threatening experiment. 
We get far more new cus- 
tomers from Unix than 
from Microsoft. We're 
also expanding the soft- 
ware market by cutting 
the cost of technology.” ®

TALKING TO. . 
Youssou N'Dour 
  
  
The rise of a star 
With his round face, slender physique and 
deceptively adolescent appearance, 39-year- 
old Youssou N'Dour seems younger than his 
age. 
Even though his mother was a singer, a 
future as a star of “world music” was hardly 
on the cards for a boy born in a poor district 
of Dakar, Senegal .His dream was to become 
a footballer. 
His father, a mechanic, gave him a strict 
upbringing and wanted young Youssou to be 
a model childlike his 20 brothers and sisters. 
N'Dour, whose schooling went as far as 
secondary level, managed to convince him 
that it was possible to be a musician without 
becoming a juvenile delinquent. In 1979, 
when he was 20, he formed his own group, 
I'Etoile de Dakar (which became Le Super 
Etoile in 1981) and created his own style of 
music, Mbalax, from the name of a traditio- 
nal Wolof dance. 
It took him 15 years to win international 
recognition. This came in 1986 when he 
caught the attention of Peter Gabriel. 
Through Gabriel,N'Dour got to know a num- 
ber of famous English-language singers who 
introduced him to the state-of-the-art tech- 
nology of the major recording studios. 
In 1989 N'Dour really reached the top in 
world music with his album The Lion, and 
then went on to work with pop stars like 
Neneh Cherry, with whom he shared a gold 
disc in 1994 for their song Seven Seconds. 
Twenty-six years after he started singing, 
N'Dour is the author of 115 songs. His fame 
spread even wider when his song La Cour des 
Grands was chosen as the official anthem for 
the 1998 World Cup. But he has always kept 
his feet on the ground and keeps a cool head 
even when talking about issues like racism, 
drugs or poverty. He discusses them with the 
same gentleness found in his songs.

### 112543: Youssou N'Dour: Africa's world musician

Africa’s world musician 
A leading figure in World Music, Senegal’s Youssou N'Dour 
wants to use his success to aid humanitarian causes and 
encourage the development of talented young African 
musicians. 
BM You're a star of African music. But is 
there such a thing as African music? 
There are countless kinds of music in 
Africa. Every region has its own traditio- 
nal sounds. Then there’s modern African 
music, which combines local and foreign 
influences, and that’s what I'm part of. 
The two currents inspire each other. 
Traditional music is more vibrant when 
modern performers make use of its 
potential and variety. 
HB What does music mean to you? 
It’s a kind of natural force. Especially in 
Africa, where there’s something musical 
in the air, in people’s bodies, in the way 
they move. Africans don’t read much. 
They listen. And they listen with their 
bodies. The first thing about a song is its 
rhythm. But you can use its power to 
convey a message, to express commit- 
ment or to make people happy. 
HB How do you write your songs? 
Fifteen or twenty of my compositions 
came naturally. The rest I had to work on. 
To write them, I shut myself away and 
concentrate on a single topic. Today I 
must say that Africa has never been so 
ready to assert itself on the world stage. 
The head of the United Nations is an 
African. African culture is like a moving 
train. Its locomotive is music which can 
produce universal melodies. 
HB How did you come to World Music? 
Gradually. I started out when I was thir- 
teen, singing with friends. Then I was in a 
more modern group, which played tradi- 
tional music on modern instruments. 
That way I got to play in nightclubs in 
Dakar. Then my music took off. It started 
travelling and I was invited to follow it. As 
I listened to other kinds of sounds, 
through meeting stars like Peter Gabriel, 
I came up with a new form of expression. 
HB What obstacles have you encountered 
in the course of your career? 
At first my father was against it. He said 
people looked down on musicians and he 
was afraid that might rub off on him. He 
didn’t want to see me drinking or taking 
drugs. In my country, the relationship 
between parents and children is heavily 
influenced by tradition and Islam. Even 
after the age of twenty, children must 
obey their fathers. I was very young and I 
did a deal with mine: Id behave myself 
totally as long he let me be a musician. I 
also thank God and my father for giving 
me good health and enabling me to be a 
role model for young people. But I don’t 
condemn people who drink or smoke 
dope. Some of them are very talented. 
BM Many African musicians live in Western 
countries, but you don’t. What keeps 
you in Senegal? 
My family, in the broadest sense of the 
word. Not just my wife and children. A 
family is really something. I’ve agreed to 
take over from my father and keep an eye 
on everything and everyone. That’s what

keeps me at home. Performers leave 
Senegal because there’s nothing there to 
help them fulfil their potential. This has 
made me want to change things. But I can 
go whenever I want to. There’s an airport 
in Dakar and you don’t need an exit visa 
to leave. 
HM You bring the people around you into 
your creative universe. How do you 
reconcile loyalty to friends with the 
need for quality? 
I started from nothing. Just me and a few 
musicians. | really had to talk them into 
forming a group. At the time, everyone 
was afraid people would look down on 
them. Relatives and friends were the first 
people to join me. Then other people did. 
But first and foremost I'm a professional. 
When someone has to be fired I don’t 
hesitate, whether it’s a member of my 
family or not. It’s all in the way you go 
TALKING TO. 
about it. For example, if someone in my 
studio isn’t getting anywhere, I tell them 
to go and work with the sound techni- 
cians. They soon get fed up and leave of 
their own accord. 
BM What are you doing to encourage 
artistic creativity in Senegal? 
I started a record label, Gololi, which in 
Wolof means the bells which horses have 
round their necks. It works with the stu- 
dio I have in Dakar, called Xipi (“open 
eyes” in Wolof). The label produces seven 
artists a year and their work is distributed 
in Senegal and internationally through 
our partners, foreign record companies 
which have faith in us. That’s how Cheikh 
Lo, a Senegalese musician I produced, 
was launched. The critics have given him 
rave reviews, and World Circuit is distri- 
buting him successfully. I'm also working 
so that one day Senegalese can take over 
the recording and technical side of their 
music. At the moment, we're 90-per-cent 
dependent on Westerners. That’s not a 
bad thing in itself but local professionals 
can do better because they know the lan- 
guage and understand our music more 
quickly. So I organize training sessions, 
sometimes pay for courses in Paris and 
take young people on tour abroad. About 
80 per cent of the professional performers 
in Dakar today started out with me. 
HB Do you think governments should help 
encourage artistic creation? 
The state should protect the rights of 
artists but let creativity develop freely. 
Pirating is a plague in Africa. Performers 
can’t make a living from their own work. 
At least half my songs are copied in 
Senegal and up to 80 per cent elsewhere 
in Africa. Governments should fight that 
by strengthening and enforcing copyright

### 112543: Youssou N'Dour: Africa's world musician

TALKING TO. 
  
A child of the Medina 
10:30.a.m., the Medina. Men and women sit chatting under the shade of the neem trees lining 15th 
Street, the sound of their voices occasionally drowned out by children’s cries. All along the street, ven- 
dors sit under big parasols with their wares— a jumble of school textbooks, Koranic pamphlets, second- 
hand clothing and assorted potions— spread out on the ground in front of them. The wall of a seasho- 
re Muslim cemetery closed decades ago after it became full, is at the far end. The house where Youssou 
N’dour was born is just across the street. 
It wasn’t hard to find.“ Youssou N'Dour's house? Straight on, at the end. When you get there, ask 
again and anyone will show you which oneit is” The building where the famous singer lived until he was 
a teenager is having work done on it and is for the moment uninhabited. 
A childhood friend, A.N., says: “ Youssou N'Dour is from here. As a child, all he knew was the 
Medina.” With a hint of nostalgia in his voice, he recalls long hours spent drinking tea together, playing 
football or performing with the Khandrang Jazz band,formed at the end of the 1960s with a group of 
friends whom the future star introduced to singing. They accompanied him on castanets. 
Hardly anything is left of those days. As he became famous, the singer stopped seeing his “real” 
friends of old,says A.N., hastening to add that this is because “ You” ,N'Dour’s nickname in these parts, 
has “bad advisers” But,he says, “he’s a good guy and if he came by in his car, he'd stop and say hello 
to me” 
Neighbours say “ You” is seldom seen these days on 15th Street. He lives in the classy suburb of 
Almadies, near Yoff airport.“ But we'd love it if he 
dropped by,” says one woman,obviously proud of 
the singer's success. 
Another local, Aziz, says that if “You” was 
more visible, the fans would not run after him so 
much. Aziz, who has a degree in management 
from a European university and was a playmate of 
N’'Dour’s, says the singer is warm-hearted, but 
complains that he has not used his wealth to do 
anything to help relieve the Medina’s chronic 
youth unemployment problem. 
Abdoulaye Camara is permanent secretary of 
“Harmony and Initiative in the Medina” (Cime), 
an association set up last year after a suggestion 
made by N'Dour, its president. He sees things 
quite differently. “He comes to three-quarters of 
our meetings and if he can’t make it he always 
lets us know,” he says. Camara is proud that many 
people are keen to fund the activities of “You's” 
association. The singer, his hero, is “manna for the 
Medina,” he says. 
An onlooker adds that everyone in the 
Medina is fond of N'dour because of his “modes- 
ty, efficiency, kindness and sense of friendship.” 
True or false? Aziz the young professional who 
wants “ You” to do something specific,had never 
heard of the association and says when asked 
about its impact that he’ll “believe it when he 
sees it.”

laws. At the moment, if a guy is caught 
bringing an illegal truckload of pirated 
cassettes into Senegal, weeks go by before 
they can be confiscated. By that time, he’s 
sold them. 
BM Why aren’t you involved in distribution? 
You can’t do everything—write, produce, 
manufacture and distribute as well. The 
traditional outlets are there, especially in 
the markets. They shouldn’t be destroyed 
but built up with organization. 
BM Do you promote new talent by working 
with other African stars to co-ordinate 
efforts across the continent? 
Indirectly. But there isn’t much co-opera- 
tion. Performers can only help by finding 
backers at government level. Then it’s a

matter for ministers of culture, who have 
to push through laws and make sure 
they're in line with regulations set up by 
international bodies such as the 
Organization of African Unity. There’s no 
point in passing a law in Senegal if there 
isn’t one in Mali. 
HB Isthere a balanced relationship 
between artists from countries of the 
South and the labels in the North? 
Even though I’m with Sony, I think major 
record companies have failed, in spite of 
the big investments they've made in 
African music over the past decade. They 
interfere with the creative process by 
trying to push modern songs instead of 
helping artists to do their creative best. 
They're like banks—if you’re not profi- 
table, they drop you. I learned that lesson 
the hard way when Virgin dumped me. 
They expected me to sell as well as Peter 
Gabriel or Phil Collins, two of their stars. 
I sold a quarter of a million discs but it 
wasn’t enough. They wanted a million. 
HB Isthere an alternative to this system?

world because he got help at home, in 
Jamaica. Our music must be created in 
Africa, but we musn’t stop travelling, 
meeting other artists and listening to 
other sounds. My dream is to change the 
system. When my contract with Sony 
expires in about five years time, after I've 
made the three albums I owe them, I'll 
come back to my own label and cut a sales 
deal with Sony. Whatever happens, you 
have to stick with an international label if 
you want to get distributed. 
HB You campaign for humanitarian causes, 
including the fight against poverty. 
Where do you start in Africa? 
By communicating. Everyone must have 
the right to voice an opinion—the poor, 
the rich, the middle class. They don’t 
know each other and their paths never 
cross. | want to use my music to bring 
them together. I perform everywhere— 
from city suburbs to the poorest villages. 
When there’s no electricity, we make do 
with a generator to try and put on as good 
a show as we would in Paris. Artists have 
power and should use it to get their mes- 
sages across. 
HB Which is more important, working at 
the grassroots or at the international 
level? 
They go together. At first, I was encoura- 
ged to work with organizations like UNI- 
CEF, for which I'm a “goodwill ambassa- 
29 dor,” and Amnesty International. They 
opened my eyes. You see your own coun- 
try clearer when you're far away. Working 
with these organizations gave me the idea 
of setting up an association in the neigh- 
bourhood where I was born, the Medina, 
a wonderful ragbag of contradictions. 
Like my music. 
HB But you left to live in a smarter part of 
town. 
I live in Almadies, but my heart’s still in the 
Medina. I go back there very often, my 
best friends live there and there’s no reason 
to think I won’t return to live there one 
day. 
BM How does your organization work? 
I contribute 250,000 CFA francs (about 
$420) a year. We started out with an exhi- 
bition to help young people to get to 
know the neighbourhood’s history and 
problems. We’d like to see the local archi- 
tecture more in line with the Medina’s

needs. Meanwhile, we're tackling the rub- 
bish problem by organizing set setal days, 
when everyone joins in cleaning up— 
sweeping up and painting bright murals 
over anti-government graffiti. 
Bl You're a political fireman, then. Don’t 
you think opposition is necessary? 
Neighbourhood walls aren’t the best 
place to protest against the government. 
It’s better to do that through politics. 
HM You even endorsed Ibrahim Bare 
Mainassara’s January 1996 coup in 
Niger by giving a concert there two 
months later. Why? 
I wanted to help calm things down, to 
make the people of Niger smile again. I'm 
dead against any kind of violence. It’s bet- 
ter to have an illegal government than 
civil war. 
BM You campaign for human rights, yet 
you're in favour of polygamy. Isn't there 
a contradiction there? 
I’m a practising Muslim and Islam allows 
polygamy. Anyway, is it really a denial of 
human rights? 
[_ | 
TALKING TO. . . 
HB It’s against equality between the sexes. 
Are you in favour of polyandry? 
No. Anyway, for the moment I’ve only got 
one wife. But I believe religion comes 
before all else. 
Bl Even human rights? 
Yes and no. Polygamy aside, I'm in favour 
of human rights. I'm against female cir- 
cumcision and believe in the emancipa- 
tion of women. But I also think women 
should remain the guardians of African 
values, like family harmony. 
HB People say you're a multi-millionaire. Is 
that in CFA francs or dollars? 
I’ve worked hard.But I don’t measure my 
success in terms of money. Instead I try to 
make it an example for other Africans to 
follow. I reinvest some of my fortune to 
help them along that path. The World 
Cup song will bring in a lot of money. 
Some of it can be used to fund a large- 
scale humanitarian effort in Africa. 
Several associations are working on that. 
Nothing’s decided yet, but I'd like to 
extend my activities to this kind of thing 
in Africa. We need it, don’t you think? MN 
Interview by Sophie Boukhari 
and Seydou Amadou Oumarou 
 
Birth of a myth 
Youssou N'Dour’s talent and charisma are not 
enough to explain his international success. His 
breakthrough on the pop scene, which took 
place at the same time as World Music was 
catching on in the West during the 1980s, is 
partly the result of a non-stop communications 
effort. “His press attachés have succeeded in 
positioning him in the place he deserves,” says 
Francois Belorgey, former director of the French 
cultural centre in Dakar. “ He was already tre- 
mendously popular at home.” 
The singer soon “ realized how necessary it 
is to cultivate a commitment compatible with 
his artistic intelligence” says Senegalese uni- 
versity teacher Ousmane Diakhaté. He was ins- 
pired by musicians like Peter Gabriel, a human 
rights activist. His sensibility did the rest. His 
appeal is based on the “sincerity” of his huma- 
nitarianism, says Mr. Belorgey. 
His attachment to his country’s culture and 
his climb to the top of the charts have made 
him a role model for local young people, adds 
Mr. Belorgey. They can identity with the soft- 
spoken native of the Medina, a poor Dakar 
neighbourhood. That is explained, Mr. Diakhaté 
says, by “the need for a myth” which appears 
in times of crisis, when people want to be 
reassured. SA.O. EH
