### 114255: Peace in Mozambique: the question and the people

The question and the people 
Luis Carlos Patraquim* 
Enigmatic questions and oracular responses in an imaginary dialogue 
between a stranger and an old man of the people 
After the troubles and the wars, what keeps the people moving? The people moves 
towards its inner self, tracing the circle of its identity on the soil, says the old man 
sitting in the shade of the tall tree. He knows many stories. 
Is the people never still, does it always run like the graceful gazelle or like the swift and voracious 
leopard? 
No. The people dances in the bosom of time. 
And why is there a people? 
  
* Mozambican poet That’s not a question to ask the people, says the old man,laughing.

PEOPLE AND PLACES 
He rises and languidly stretches himself. He knows many stories. When the women return 
from the river carrying buckets full of water on their heads, they put leaves on the quive- 
ring surface.If they don’t,the water spills. But does it really spill? 
The water falls and runs down their faces wets their breasts and leaves glistening drops on their 
arms. That’s not right. The women must carry themselves properly. They cannot become water. 
The old man sits down again. He is very patient,he concentrates on the questions,puffs 
on his rosewood pipe. His feet are cracked and chapped in his sandals, that is why he 
knows many stories. 
But why is this old man sitting alone under the tall tree with his smoke and his patience? 
The old man is always alone. T he people is always alone, he answers, without sighing deeply, 
without a grave voice,without anything. 
Should the people always be a mystery? 
The mystery of the people is that it exists. 
And stays seated beneath the tall tree? 
No! 
He is almost angry, this seated old man.Is the people waiting for something? 
God of day and night, S pirit that lives in the tree trunk and flies between the roots and the mane 
of foliage; you who have seen the wind of blood like a river with the people in it, and the lake catch 
fire and the cry of women suddenly dried up, tell me, where do these questions come from ? asks the 
old man anxiously. 
Question, I am thirsty. Bring me that gourd, the one over there, with the wide mouth! 
He leans over the water avidly and cups his hands to drink. 
Liquid fabric, do not stop dancing, or I will return from my blindness, although I no longer want 
to see memory. It is where I put my silence, and now I utter other words. 
He sighs. 
That question sounds like a hyena bursting into laughter. 
The old man rises and starts to walk around the tree.T here are many stories around the 
trunk:a leopard skin, a woman’s full stomach, masks and drums, a blood-stained spear, 
a burnt sculpture,a cross,a fez, a book and a Kalashnikov, frayed linen, a flag. 
T hat question is a spirit that besieges me with my own things, says the old man, calmer. He sits 
down again. 
I am those things. N ow, I can look at them again. Everything I felt on the circle and on the tree 
trunk, all the blood I have wept, everything I have done in the dark lake, spilling my thick milk,»

nial, Africa’s foremost photography event, which is being 
held in Mali’s capital from 3 to 12 December 1998. 
Officially entitled “ Rencontres de la Photographie 
Africaine” , the Biennial is presenting a panorama of 
daily life and festivities in Africa, ranging from boxing 
matches in Ghana to Ramadan rituals in Tunisia. The 
official selection presents the works of such leading pho- 
tographers as Philip Kwame Apagya (Ghana), Felix Diallo 
(Mali), Omar D. (Algeria), Nabil Mahdaoui (Morocco) 
and Ananias Dago, a young photographer from Cote 
d'Ivoire. In addition to the official selection, group shows 
will present family archives from South Africa and Africa 
as seen from Paris (in collaboration with the Maison 
Européenne de la Photographie). [|

How can I rest at night, if only yesterday I was rowing on the river of the dead, if I put ani-

How did you know I was sitting beneath this tree? 
I was told that there was a tree at the edge of a plateau, and that where there is a tree, a sea-

The old man’s bursts of laughter ring through the darkness. 
Is that all? 
I do not know how to answer you.l will simply tell you that I have crossed the centuries 
and that I stopped at several places, with their voices, their time that was coming or dying,

children’s song. I looked in libraries, in the many stories of old men like you. Another time, 
someone who crossed my path spoke of a labyrinth and a circle. When I asked him to draw 
them for me on the ground because I needed to see, that face or that voice whose features 
and pitch I can no longer even describe, vanished,and I have only this memory:not kno- 
wing what I saw or heard. When I lost hope,I knew you existed. 
A man sitting beneath a tree at the edge of the plateau? 
Yes. 
Is that all? 
Yes. . . and that he knew many stories. 
And which stories did you want to know? 
That question leaves me baffled. 
Do you remember that I asked you to sit down next to me and not in front of me? A ccept my invi- 
tation. 
That way, we both look at the same thing! The old man bursts into laughter yet again. 
Why didn’t you write “another time”? It’s as if you were taking a kind of photograph.You would   be an accomplice. . . . >

A country 
on its knees 
t was only four years ago that Mozambique tur- 
ned the page on more than 400 years of conflict 
and war. 
The Portuguese presence from the beginning of 
the sixteenth century was mainly a series of military 
operations which did not end until after the Frst 
World War. The actual colonization of the country, 
which only began around a century ago, was par- 
ticularly brutal. 
The Portuguese empire collapsed in 1974 and 
Mozambique, exhausted by a decade of fighting 
colonial rule and by the subsequent departure of 
100,000 Portuguese settlers, became indepen- 
dent.But the peace was not to last.A new war 
broke out,inspired and supported by the white 
governments of South Africa and Rhodesia,who 
were determined to destabilize their neighbours. 
Taking advantage of internal dissent stemming 
from the new government's socialist options, the 
rebel Mozambican National Resistance (Renamo) 
pitted itself against the Mozambican National Libe- 
ration Front (Frelimo), which had been founded in 
1962 and was backed by the communist countries. 
Nearly a million people died, three million more 
were chased from their homesand three-quarters of 
the country was devastated before peace returned 
at the end of 1994, when elections confirmed Fre- 
limo in power. 
Mozambique’s 800,000 sq km of territory 
stretches 2,000 km from north to south and 
contains nineteen million people. It is one of the 
world’s poorest countries, with a per capita GNP of 
only $100, life expectancy of forty-five years and 
an illiteracy rate of 60 per cent. Its hopes for deve- 
lopment rest on agriculture and the use of itslong 
  
coastline by its landlocked neighbours. [|

### 114256: War on drugs

War 
on drugs 
Drugs destroy, corrupt and kill. They must not be fought with half-hearted or short- 
 
  
term measures. We need to wage war on them—one of the very few wars we must all 
  
be involved in. But let’s be clear about the enemy. It’s essential to strike at the sources 
of drugs, and therefore the traffickers. But it’s even more important to attack the causes 
of demand,and here too we must aim at the right target. 
At the dawn of the twenty-first century, the excessive use of drugs, encouraged by 
powerful—and abominable—economic interests,cannot be regarded simply as an indi- 
vidual problem, as an unfortunate encounter between a person and a toxic substance. We 
cannot ignore the personal aspect, but the use of drugs has grown into a social phenome- 
non which is destabilizing the economic, political and cultural relationships of societies. 
Over and above personal responsibility, societies must act to promote a way of life that rules 
out drug abuse. 
The drug addicts are not the guilty ones. We need to give them care and assistance 
before they tear their families apart and destroy their own lives. The main enemies are the 
causes of the demand for drugs—marginalization,exclusion, extreme poverty or revulsion 
from excess. 
The backcloth to these trends is the moral crisis caused by the disappearance of tra- 
ditional landmarks from even the most isolated societies. This vacuum makes some people 
feel they are living in a meaningless world and drives others to think only about their own 
personal success and achievements. To fight the demand for drugs, we have to go to the root 
of the problem and give life a purpose by promoting social activities which respect the envi- 
ronment and the values of tradition and culture,whether they be of a religious, personal 
or some other nature. We must offer young people not just the means to live but a reason 
to do so. 
Preventive education can play a very important part here as long as it is formative as 
well as informative. Only then can it become an important tool in building and streng- 
thening character, especially of young people,by encouraging new ways of thinking and 
new lines of conduct.It should open doors which lead to new horizons,whether they be 
ideological, cultural or spiritual,or sporting, technical and artistic. 
This first phase of local and national action goes with specific political steps that cost 
money, which should be found by earmarking a share of gross national product. Charities 
can temporarily tide things over but cannot provide permanent solutions. We must build 
detoxification centres which will also provide professional training, places where drug 
dependence can gradually be reduced. We must also take legal steps to fight drug traffic- 
kers, control narcotics production and halt money-laundering, as well as seeing that drug 
addicts can get free treatment. 
But measures taken at local and national level can only really be effective if they are part 
of a coherent and comprehensive international programme.To draw up and implement 
such a programme,governments, international institutions, non-governmental organiza- 
tions (NGOs), experts, and friends and relatives of addicts must all work together. Deter- 
mined and unanimous action by the whole society is essential to confront this growing 
threat to the security and dignity of new generations. It calls, in fact, for a new planet-wide 
moral contract. [|

### 114257: Pollution for export?

Pollution for export? 
After tax havens . . . pollution havens? Are multinationals seeking to 
relocate in countries with low environmental standards? It all depends 
on how you look at it. 
Overall, the multinationals’ track record seems clean . . . 
In the search for new sources of capital, 
labour and raw materials are multina- 
tional corporations looking to relocate in 
“pollution havens” where environmental regu- 
lations are lax if not non-existent? 
The question is increasingly being asked 
at a time when the level of foreign direct 
investment (FDI) is rising sharply. This is 
mainly due to the fact that both “source” and 
“host” countries recognize that each have 
something to gain from the FDI process. 
However, some observers are afraid that eco- 
nomic gains are being generated at the 
expense of environmental quality and other 
important elements of social welfare. T hey 
worry that “host” countries will compete for

the benefits of new FDI by lowering their 
environmental standards or by reducing 
efforts to enforce existing standards, and that 
firms will relocate to these “pollution 
havens”, to gain a cost advantage over their 
competitors. In this scenario, developing 
countries are regarded as the most likely sites 
of pollution havens because they may be the 
countries most willing to trade off their envi- 
ronmental quality for economic gains, and 
industrialized countries are cast in the role 
of predators willing to degrade the environ- 
ment of developing countries in order to 
generate economic gains for themselves. 
However, most research suggests that, ove- 
rall, companies do not invest overseas to 
obtain access to lower environmental costs. 
It is difficult to determine whether FDI 
flows are affected by the level of environ- 
mental regulations existing in foreign coun- 
tries. Foreign capital clearly flows to a wide 
range of countries, industries and compa- 
nies—some of which are careful environ- 
mental stewards;some of which are not. A 
firm may in any case invest in a country to 
take advantage of a high quality labour 
force and other factors unrelated to envi- 
ronmental costs. 
Respect for the environment: 
a good selling point 
Environmental costs are often a relati- 
vely small component of total production 
costs,which may sometimes even be lower 
when environmental standards are higher 
(for example, where lower environmental 
standards lead to higher costs of treating 
industrial water supplies). 
Multinationals often seem more inter- 
ested in consistent enforcement of environ- 
mental rules than in lower standards per se. 
Moreover, companies are often willing to 
make new investments that actually improve

the environment, so long as their main com- 
petitors are also required to do so. Part of 
the reason for this is that multinationals fre- 
quently apply a single environmental stan- 
dard to their world-wide operations,regard- 
less of any (lower) standards which may exist 
in a particular country. There could be three 
main reasons for this. 
First, the firm may have calculated that 
it cannot afford to see the reputation of its 
products in the (global) market-place tar- 
nished by charges of “environmental 
exploitation” in one particular location— 
charges which can sometimes result in boy- 
cotts or other forms of consumer pressure. 
For example, investors in Puerto Rican 
banana production firms have insisted on 
“due environmental care” by those firms, 
because they perceive that overseas mar- 
kets for their products will demand higher 
levels of environmental quality. 
PLANET 
exist within certain types of firms,operating 
in specific industries, and in particular coun- 
tries. Investments made in the resource 
extraction and processing sectors, such as 
chemicals, metallurgy, logging, and pulp and 
paper, fall into this category. In these ind us- 
tries, pollution control costs can make up a 
significant proportion of the firm’s total 
costs. The result can be that small cost diffe- 
rences can translate into large changes in 
market share and profitability. T hese firms 
are more susceptible to the level of environ- 
mental costs, and therefore more likely to 
invest in “pollution havens” .However, this 
does not necessarily mean that countries 
actually lower their environmental standards 
to attract new investments. 
There is clearly competition, both 
within and between countries, to obtain 
access to new FDI. Itis particularly keen in 
the rapidly-industrializing countries, and 
An ethic of eco-efficiency, which seeks to ‘design out’ 
pollution problems rather than deal with unwanted waste, 
is increasingly accepted 
Second, the firm may have calculated 
that it is less expensive to apply a single 
environmental standard to its (globally- 
integrated) production processes, rather 
than to develop “tailor-made” production 
lines, based on varying levels of environ- 
mental standards. 
Finally, the ability of firms to make 
“dirty” investments may be limited by 
requirements in their home country. For 
example,the US Ex-Im Bank requires any 
US company taking advantage of its export 
financing assistance to meet certain mini- 
mum environmental criteria. 
On the other hand, there is some evi- 
dence to suggest that “pollution havens”do 
in countries which are dependent on the 
resource extraction and processing indus- 
tries in which the potential for hard cur- 
rency export earnings may be very high. In 
these situations, incoming investors can 
often successfully argue for relief from 
“high”environmental costs. 
But surprising though it may seem, 
investors in resource-based industries do 
not always exert pressures for lower envi- 
ronmental standards—sometimes they may 
even want standards in the host country to 
be raised. 
Competitive pressures can also translate 
into a desire to reduce waste and improve 
productivity, which can lead to improved 
environmental performance. An ethic of eco- 
efficiency, which seeks to “design out” pollu- 
tion problems rather than deal with unwan- 
ted waste, is increasingly accepted. 
FDI is also often associated with 
modern technologies which represent envi- 
ronmental improvements over what is cur- 
rently available in the host country. Once 
the investment has been made, local firms 
may try to imitate multinationals’environ- 
mental practices. But there is also evidence 
that certain kinds of enterprises (e.g. the 
town and village enterprises of rural China) 
seem prone to use outdated technical 
equipment from other countries that does 
not represent the “best environmental tech- 
nology”, because they are undercapitalized 
and because this equipment is cheap. 
There is also some evidence that “pol- 
lution havens” may be associated with 
something other than the level of environ- 
mental standards. For example, pollution 
intensities did appear to increase more 
rapidly in Latin America as a whole bet- 
ween 1970 and 1990, after environmental 
regulations in OECD countries became 
stricter. But it was not the countries with 
the lowest environmental standards which 
attracted the most pollution-intensive 
investment—it was those countries which 
were less open to FDI in the first place. 
“Pollution havens” were found, but they 
seemed to be more closely associated with 
protectionist economies than with lower 
environmental standards. 
Overall,countries which operate straight- 
forward, transparent, and efficient environ- 
mental programmes seem to experience no 
particular loss of FD I flows, and may in fact 
attract some industries which are looking for 
reliable overseas bases of operation. In short, 
governments are recognizing that lowering 
environmental standards to attract new FDI 
is often unnecessary. | 
... but in mineral extraction and some other resource-seeking 
industries the picture is murky 
(e.g. minerals, fisheries and planta- 
tion crops), locational preference is 
deeply bound with environmental costs and 
access to natural resources. These are indus- 
tries where small cuts in production costs 
can reap potentially large rewards. 
Throughout the Asia-Pacific region, for 
example, environmental standards have

recently the Philippines made radical 
changes to its mining law, creating a mas- 
sive upsurge of applications from foreign 
investors for mining leases. In all three of 
these countries exemptions to domestic law 
have been made to accommodate specific 
mining disasters. 
The direct environmental and social 
impact of these exemptions can be consi- 
derable. In Indonesia, Freeport’s mining 
activities have resulted in the almost total 
destruction of the nearby forests and river 
ecology as well as sparking off human rights 
abuses. In the Philippines fourteen rivers 
were so polluted by copper waste that 
where they flow into the sea, fish yields were 
reduced by 50 per cent. Unfortunately, des- 
tructive practices such as these are the rule 
rather than the exception amongst mining 
operations in developing countries. 
PLANET 
Other resource seeking industries have 
also used lax environmental standards or 
other environment-related incentives (e.g 
low royalty rates, low concession fees, 
access rights) to attract foreign investment. 
Examples include banana plantations in 
Central America and the forestry sector in 
Ghana. 
Relocating from California 
to Mexico 
In other industries where products are 
relatively undifferentiated and small cost dif- 
ferences can have major impacts on a com- 
pany’s market share, variations in environ- 
mental standards will become an important 
consideration in the firm’s locational prefe- 
rence. There has, for example, been a large 
shift in operations of US-based furniture 
makers from California to northern Mexico. 
A controversial project 
The Peninsular and Oriental Australia 
Ports Private Ltd,a subsidiary of P&O 
(UK) recently proposed to build an all- 
weather eight-berth international port with 
capacity to expand to 30 berths on demand 
at Vadhavan in Dahanu Taluk,an adminis- 
trative area of India’s Maharashtra state. 
The proposal to construct the $2.4-bil- 
lion mega-port has been vehemently opposed 
by the people of Dahanu, which is situated 
120 km north of India’s business capital, 
Bombay, and is one of the last green belts 
along the country’s rapidly industrializing 
western coast. Environmental groups argue 
that the proposed port would destroy the 
“ecologically fragile” region and seriously 
affect the livelihood of Dahanu’s 300,000 
inhabitants, mostly tribal and fisherfolk. 
Environmentalists point out that Dahanu 
was “notified”, or classified, under the Indian 
Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) by the 
Federal Ministry of Environment and Forests 
in 1991. The CRZ bans any new construc- 
tion within 500 metres of the high tide line. 
In 1996, the people of Dahanu took the 
Maharashtra government, which negotiated 
the port project with P&O, to court for fai- 
ling to implement the Dahanu notification. 
After a gruelling legal battle, the Supreme 
Court of India upheld the Dahanu Notifi- 
cation prohibiting any change of land-use in 
the region and ordered that a committee of 
experts be formed to ensure implementation 
of the environmental laws protecting D aha- 
nu’s eco-fragility. 
After the Court verdict, a senior official 
of P&O in India stated in aradio interview that 
he would support the denotification of the 
1 2 The Unesco Courier - December 1998 
Dahanu conservation area to enable deve- 
lopment of the port to go ahead, triggering an 
avalanche of protests. “We strongly object to 
P&O interfering with the laws of our sovereign 
nation,” says Shabnam Merchant, a spo- 
kesman for the People’s Alliance for Imple- 
mentation of the Law (PAIL), an umbrella 
organization of fourteen environmental groups 
fighting against the port project. “The com- 
pany is also lobbying with the Indian envi- 
ronment ministry to change the laws and 
denotify the area. They should understand that 
Dahanu’s laws do not belong to the stock- 
holders of P&0O.” 
In areport on Dahanu, the World Wide 
Fund for Nature (WWF) said that “P&O’s 
actions in Dahanu are in direct conflict with 
Organization of Economic Co-operation and 
Development (OECD) Guidelines on Mul- 
tinational Enterprises.” It said that P&O was 
exerting extreme pressure in India to have 
the port area denotified, despite the existence 
of other unprotected port sites which are sui- 
table for development. “In WWF's view this 
constitutes improper involvement in local 
political issues.” 
In September this year, the Dahanu Taluka 
Environment Protection Authority (DTEPA), 
formed under the orders of the Supreme 
Court, declared that “taking an overall view of 
the matter, the conclusion is inevitable that as 
the position stands today, the construction 
of such a mega port at Vadhavan is wholly 
impermissible and, therefore, will be illegal.” 
Since then P&O has announced that it is pul- 
ling out of the project for a number of reasons, 
including uncertainty arising from the DTE- 
PA’s decision. [|

Although lower environmental stan- 
dards may not be a principal reason for 
location, if firms get the opportunity to cut 
their costs they invariably will. It is often 
the case that a number of different loca- 
tions, both in different countries and within 
a single country, meet the principal requi- 
rements of the investor. Here the potential 
recipients may engage in costly bidding 
wars that lead them to offer further incen- 
tives (financial, fiscal, environmental) to 
attract the investor. T his often includes a 
tacit or expressed commitment to lower 
environmental standards or enforce them 
with greater laxity. 
Incentives to attract 
investment 
Companies which have not invested for 
reasons of environmental standards can 
apply pressure on the host government to 
lower regulations or prevent their enforce- 
ment. High profile examples include Shell’s 
oil drilling in Nigeria and Freeport’s mining 
operations in Indonesia. More recently the 
P&O shipping line have been putting pres- 
sure on the regional authorities in India to 
declassify one of India’s three designated 
eco-fragile areas so it can go ahead with a 
port development (see box). Foreign inves-

tors have stronger leverage than domestic 
companies because they can use the threat 
of disinvestment more credibly and effecti- 
vely. 
Conversely. where investors compete 
against one another, the local authorities 
are in a position of strength to decide how 
the investment should proceed. In China, 
which is desperately short of electricity, the 
authorities have been trying to maximize 
power generation per dollar invested, and 
companies have found themselves under 
pressure to reduce their environmental 
standards to win contracts. [|

treasures

plored tropical island somewhere in the world, 
where plants and animals grow undisturbed? 
American scientiststhink one such place existsin 
the Caribbean Sea between Haiti and Jamaica, 
five centuries after Columbus passed by. 
When they returned from an expedition to the 
island of Navassa in August 1998— the first scien- 
tific visit there since 1930— a team of experts 
from the Washington-based Center for Marine 
Conservation announced they had found “ a mar- 
vel of biological treasures” on the five-sq.-km. 
speck in the ocean. 
Navasso is home to a significant number of 
plants and animals that occur nowhere else. Its 
macrobiota— large plants and animals— consists 
of eighty-two known indigenous species. At least 
twelve species are endangered or severely deple- 
ted,including two species of lizard and a variety 
of dove. The leader of the team of marine experts, 
Nina Young,described the island’s coral reefs as 
“a true gem, with some of the most enchanting 
underwater vistas in USwaters” 
US waters? Absolutely not, say the Haitians 
who have laid claim to the island since their coun- 
try was born two centuries ago. They base their 
argument on the 1697 Treaty of Ryswick,which 
divided up the island of Hispaniola (today Haiti 
and the Dominican Republic) and its dependen- 
cies between France and Spain. France subse- 
quently gave up its rights to Haiti (and therefore 
to Navassa) in 1825 when it recognized Haiti's 
independence. 
However in 1856 the US Congress passed the 
Guano IslandsAct, giving the USgovernment the 
right to claim sovereignty over any uninhabited 
island which contained deposits of bird droppings 
(guano),sought after as fertilizer and for making 
gunpowder. A ship’s captain, Peter Duncan, began 
to mine the guano on the island, and the US 
government built a lighthouse, which was dis- 
mantled in 1996. 
Washington recently decided that the US Coast 
Guard should keep the curious away from this fra- 
gile “ nature museum”. The Haitians retorted by 
announcing they would send their own scientific 
expedition to the island— a bare, waterless rock 
in the sea now declared an ecological treasure. ll

garcoating 
An educational programme in Cairo’s ‘garbage villages’ attracts 
girls with promises of income while teaching literacy and self- 
esteem along the way 
Only then can the learning and social 
change begin. 
That’s the strategy employed by the 
Association for the Protection of the Envi- 
ronment (APE), a non-governmental orga- 
nization which for more than ten years has 
worked to improve the lives of girls and 
young women living in the garbage collec- 
tion communities that skirt the edges of the 
Egyptian capital, Cairo. 
The mission of the APE project was to 
offer education, literacy training and social 
empowerment to young girls living in an 
environment where all three were often in 
short supply. But the project’s originality 
(and the key to its success, according to its 
founders) was the informal, non-traditional 
way that it went about achieving those goals. 
Young girls came to the project seeking 
nothing more than a chance to earn a little 
side money for their families by weaving 
rags into rugs and tapestries. Along the way, 
they found themselves learning unexpec-

ted lessons on literacy, hygiene, child care 
and self-sufficiency. 
“They come here to make money and 
they learn unconsciously,” says long-time 
programme volunteer Samara Abu Seif. “It 
works because it’s a part of their world— 
not just something imposed on them by 
well-meaning outsiders.” 
Life in the garbage villages (see box) 
offers women few educational or social 
opportunities. Running the garbage collec- 
tion routes is primarily the domain of fathers 
and sons, while mothers and daughters 
manually sort the garbage and clean and 
prepare the recyclable waste. Young girls may 
accompany their fathers on collection routes 
prior to puberty, but at that point cultural 
norms dictate that they stay at home. They 
usually receive little or no formal educa- 
tion—families who can afford to send their 
children to school send the boys. Girls are 
often married off at the age of fifteen or 
younger, with little or no say in the process, 
and are expected to begin bearing children 
immediately. “Empowering girls here is very 
difficult, because they’re not used to saying 
‘no’ or acting in their own interests,” says 
APE volunteer Shadia Iskander. 
APE chose to frame its educational 
efforts within the context of an income- 
generating activity. “When a girl brings 
back a part of the family income herself, 
she has more personal pride and has earned 
a greater say in her own life,” says Abu Seif. 
The organizers focused on young unmar- 
ried girls,reasoning that it would be easier 
to implement mental and emotional change 
before they become bound up in the child- 
bearing and work cycle. The first group of 
recruits for the rug-weaving school were 
selected from graduates of a literacy school 
attached to the local church. Later pupils 
‘When a girl contributes to the family income, she has more 
pride in herself and has earned a greater say in her life’ 
were selected more randomly from among 
adolescent girls found squatting on their 
haunches and sorting garbage manually. 
Some mothers baulked at letting their 
daughters take part in this mysterious pro- 
gramme, but the organizers emphasized 
they would have the opportunity to bring in 
up to 40 Egyptian pounds (US $12) per 
month, and that the flexible programme 
schedule would allow them to continue 
their household garbage separation duties. 
“At first we had a lot of trouble convincing 
families to let the girls come here,” says Abu 
Seif. “Now we have a waiting list.” 
When they joined the programme, girls 
found themselves presented with multiple 
learning opportunities. The importance of 
personal hygiene and appearance was 
emphasized.“We told them from the start, 
‘Come each day clean. Weaving a clean rug 
means coming in clean clothes and wor- 
king in a clean environment’,” Abu Seif

Young women who participate in literacy classes con 
says. 
Learning how to weave the rags (scraps 
donated from dress factories) required ini- 
tiative and independent thinking. Working 
the loom encouraged patience and discipline. 
Quality control inspectors made deductions 
from a girl’s pay if there were any imperfec- 
tions in the rug—encouraging precision and 
attention to detail. Even the choice of colours 
for the rugs stimulated creativity and personal 
expression. “The manipulative skill of using 
scissors to cut the rags proved to be vital as a 
preparation for the use of pencils in literacy 
classes,” says founding project member Dr. 
Laila Iskander Kamel. 
Patience and 
discipline 
Literacy and basic arithmetic classes were 
optional, but the programme organizers were 
adept at presenting incentives to encourage 
the girls to attend. “We would tell them to 
measure an eighty-centimetre piece of cloth, 
and they wouldn’t know what eighty was,so 
we'd say ‘Well we have these classes over 
here’, ” Abu Seif remembers. “In order to 
receive their wages they had to sign their 
names, and if they couldn’t do that, it meant 
another lesson.” 
T here were plenty of financial incentives 
to learn to read. Rugs with words on them 
tinue to sort garbage for their families 
can be sold for more money at hotels and 
tourist bazaars, so girls are paid extra for each 
letter—two Egyptian pounds for English let- 
ters, three pounds for more difficult Arabic 
letters. “Local sales events held in fancy hotels 
and private gardens were perceived as a big 
outing,” says Dr. Kamel. “Girls who could 
not read the price list could not look after the

stands at such events. Thus literacy, or at least 
the ability to read the price list, became a goal 
with a tangible reward.” 
Education 
against excision 
The girls also received lessons on 
female hygiene, excision and the benefits 
of waiting until they were at least seventeen 
or eighteen before having children. 
In its ten-year existence, programme 
organizers estimate they have trained more 
than 700 girls, about a quarter of whom 
have achieved functional literacy. Surveys 
of the graduates, according to Dr. Kamel, 
reveal important shifts in their social atti- 
tudes. Sixty-four per cent of the women 
said they were practising family planning 
and 70 per cent of the single girls said that 
when they got married they would not sub- 
ject their daughters to excision. 
The original rug-weaving programme 
has since been expanded to include other 
business ventures: a paper recycling opera- 
tion and a patchwork quilting programme 
that focuses on older,married women. 
Perhaps the surest sign of the program- 
me’s success is that the rug-weaving school is 
not only self-sufficient, but run almost enti- 
rely by a staff of programme graduates. APE 
volunteers stop in a couple of days a week, but 
day-to-day operations are run by a core of p 
A government priority 
In 1991, Egyptian President Hosny 
Mubarak’s government decided to give 
priority to education and launched a far- 
reaching programme to eradicate illiteracy. 
It was time:half the country’s adults could 
neither read nor write (36 per cent of men 
and 61 per cent of women in 1995) and the 
schools were in many cases rundown and 
overloaded, with up to 70 pupils per class. 
Since then, more than 7,000 schools 
have been built and some 120,000 primary 
and secondary teachers have been recruited 
and trained. As part of this across-the- 
board programme ranging from nursery 
schools, where the number of pupils has 
increased by 30 per cent in five years, to 
universities, particular emphasis has been 
placed on secondary education (where 
pupil numbers rose by 45 per cent in the 
same period). 
For cultural and financial reasons 
(although state schooling is free of charge in 
Egypt), families used to give preference to 
educating their sons. In an attempt to redress 
the imbalance, over a thousand classes were 
specially opened for girls in rural areas, 
where even fewer girls were enrolled in 
school than in the towns and cities. 
Much still remains to be done.Accor- 
ding to UNEsco figures, one-third of ado- 
lescents aged from 15 to 19 are “out of 
school”, a proportion which rises to 45 per 
cent in rural areas. And population growth 
means that a sustained effort is needed. Hl

Office manager Samia Wadia, one of the 
school’s first recruits,couldn’t read or write 
when she first arrived. Now she’s planning 
to attend college and study commerce. “We 
all grew up in garbage. None of us went to 
school,” says staffer Yvonne Azer, a former 
pupil. “A lot of us had never been outside 
the neighbourhood until we came to this pro- 
gramme.” 
But changing the thinking of young girls 
in Mokattam is only part of the equation. A 
daughter’s new-found literacy and empo- 
werment can come to naught or even pro- 
duce serious discord, unless her family goes 
along with the programme. For this reason, 
APE workers make sure the families are kept 
involved. Like the literacy programme, 
potentially unpopular ideas such as delaying 
WORLD OF LEARNING 
childbirth until the girl’s body can handle 
the strain are sugarcoated in financial incen- 
tives. Yvonne Azer tellshow the programme 
often collects funds for a 500-pound “gift” 
for young girls who wait until they're eigh- 
teen before having children. 
APE volunteers and alumni acknowledge 
that a handful of literacy classes and some 
looms may not be enough to overcome social 
norms that have existed for generations. But 
they have their eye on the future, not only of 
the programme graduates, but of their daugh- 
ters and granddaughters. 
“Even if we don’t change the girl’s 
situation within her own family,” says one 
staffer,“we know theyre going to take these 
new ideas to their new families when they 
get married and pass them on to future 
generations.” [| 
Cairo’s garbage villages 
The garbage villages around Cairo came 
into being in the 1940s when landless, 
uneducated farmers migrated en masse to 
the outskirts of Cairo, largely from the sou- 
thern province of Assuit, 400 kilometres 
south of the capital. 
Predominantly Christian, the migrants 
created a niche for themselves as garbage 
collectors (zabaleen in Arabic). Each mor- 
ning they would set out in donkey carts to 
make door-to-door collection stops all 
around the city. Individual households paid 
a monthly fee for garbage collection but this 
went mostly to middlemen who controlled 
and assigned the collection routes. For the 
zabaleen, much of the benefit from the arran- 
gement came from the extremely efficient 
use they made of almost every part of the 
garbage haul. After carting the garbage back 
to their home districts, they and their fami- 
lies separated it and gathered anything 
potentially recyclable (paper, plastic, wood, 
1 6 The Unesco Courier - December 1998 
metal, glass and cloth) for resale to recycling 
centres. Organic refuse and leftover food was 
used to feed the pigs and goats each family 
kept—which would then be used as meat to 
feed the family or sold for profit. 
Almost all Cairo’s zabaleen are Christian 
since Egypt’s Muslim majority is loath to 
handle pigs—one of the few livestock animals 
which can live on garbage. The recycling sys- 
tem has changed little over the past five 
decades apart from the introduction of 
machinery such as plastic chippers and the 
replacement of traditional donkey carts with 
pick-up trucks by those zabaleen who can 
afford them. APE organizers estimate that 
the zabaleen handle about 3,000 tons of gar- 
bage daily—about one third of Cairo’s (popu- 
lation 13 million) daily output. Several gar- 
bage villages now skirt the edges of Cairo, the 
largest being M okattam, which has a popu- 
lation of more than 17,000 and handles about 
1,200 tons of garbage daily. [| 
  
Learning for job- 
seekers 
nemployed people and young people trying 
U to find their first job often do not have expe- 
rience in job-seeking in a sometimes very tight 
market. In recent years, several publicand private 
organizationshave sprung up in Europe to fill this 
gap by training job-seekers in the skills needed 
to enter the world of work. 
The European Employment Service (EURES), for 
example, gathers information from its 17 member 
states’ on the job situation in the European eco- 
nomic area.Anyone who has a plan to look for a 
job in one of these countries can submit it to a 
“ Euro-counsellor” who will check whether it is 
feasible. 
In each country, organizations linked to this net- 
work offer unemployed people courses in how to 
look for a job. Before trying to “ sell” their qualifi- 
cations, candidates must first study those sectors 
of the labour market they are interested in. Denise 
Lossel, a consultant with APEC, a private French 
association which specializes in management posi- 
tions, says:“ We start by getting the candidates to 
say what they are best at, and then we guide them 
asthey put together a profile adapted to the mar- 
ket.” 
This is essential before taking action, says Mar- 
tine Cantenys, who runs workshops for jobless 
people at France's National Employment Agency 
(ANPE).“ We teach candidates to draw up their 
CV and to write letters applying for jobs or ans- 
wering offers of work. We even hold mock perso- 
nal interviews which we videotape so they can 
be analysed afterwards” 
In Spain, the National Employment Institute 
(INEM) also has a special service to help candi- 
dates overcome psychological blocks which could 
hinder their search for a job. A similar service exists 
in Santos (Brazil), where a labour exchange (which 
pools job offers and applications) also provides 
unemployed people with psychological help, to 
enable them to regain self-confidence so they can 
display and sell their talents. [|

two-kilo cake contains twice as much flour, eggs and sugar as a one-kilo cake. A cake 
can only be eaten if it’s within reach of hungry hands and mouths, and once it’s been 
eaten it’s all gone. 
A copy of a computer program, on the other hand, only has a marginal cost, that of its physical sup- 
port or its transfer. Internet users thousands of kilometres away from each other can “consume” it 
simultaneously. And it doesn’t wear out when it’s been used. 
Thiscomparison encapsulatesthe difference between the industrial economy and the “knowledge 
economy” ,which is also known variously as the “intangible economy”,“the weightless economy”, 
the “immaterial economy” or simply the “new economy”.In this economy, ideas, images and know- 
ledge are more prominent than physical products, machines and raw materials. Just as harnessing 
energy spawned industrial society, so mastery of data processing and transmission has given rise to 
the knowledge economy. It is particularly strong in four leading sectors:information and communi- 
cation technologies; intellectual property— patents, brand-names, advertising and financial services; 
databases and recreational services;biotechnology. 
Does this mean that traditional economic rules are now dead and buried,as the gurus of the new 
economy maintain? Will these new technological tools increase or reduce inequalities worldwide? Will 
the new work opportunities be personally more rewarding? The extent and the consequences of the 
rise of the knowledge economy, and even its very nature, are still being hotly debated. _

can be assessed at three levels. We can look at 
individuals, firms and entire economies. 
First people. In 1997, three of the world’s 
twenty wealthiest individuals were Americans who 
made their money almost entirely from software. 
Their total wealth was almost ten times as much 
that of the three wealthiest Britons involved in more 
tangible production (real estate,steel, and food). In 
October 1998, the world’s wealthiest individual (in 
software) was more than twice as wealthy as the 
runner-up, who was not in software. 
Next turn to firms. As the historical volatility 
of stock markets powerfully shows,gauging the eco- 
nomic success or failure of individual firms is diffi- 
cult in general. However, averaging stock market 
performance over longer time periods and across 
individual firms in sectors of interest can give a 
more reliable picture. The five major information 
and communications technology (ICT) firms that

A weightless 
economy 
Information and communications technology is transforming 
the world and producing ‘knowledge products’ to which traditional 
economic principles do not apply 
an interested observer would be likely to name are 
Microsoft, Intel, Compaq, Dell, and Cisco. Bet- 
ween them, these firms had market capitalization of 
$12 billion in 1987. By 1997, their combined capi- 
talization amounted to $600 billion—a fifty-fold 
increase over less than ten years or annual growth of 
45 per cent.Such rapid growth,sustained for such 
along stretch of time, is remarkable by comparison 
with any other economic quantity. 
Finally, consider countries. In the United 
States, the information technology (IT) share of 
nominal gross domestic product (GDP) has grown 
from 4.9 per cent in 1985 to 8.2 per cent in 1997. 
At the same time, IT prices have fallen dramati- 
cally: the real price of computing has, by some mea- 
sures,been declining by 30 per cent a year for the 
last two decades. T he real price of communications 
has,similarly, been decreasing at 8 per cent a year 
for the last seventy years, a halving every eight to 
nine years. And disk storage capacity has been

increasing at 60 per cent a year since 1991, while its 
nominal price has fallen a hundred-fold. Thus, 
without even taking into account the potential 
spillover effects from its increasing the producti- 
vity of other industries, the IT sector’s direct contri- 
bution to real value produced has been substantial 
for the world’s leading economy. 
It may not be surprising that this is happening 
in the technologically advanced world. However, 
IT contributes greatly to growth in some of the 
world’s least developed economies as well. In India, 
per capita annual income in 1995 was $340: the 
majority of the population of 900 million lived on 
less than one dollar a day. At the same time,India 
hosts a major offshore software centre for the rest of 
the world. Software production in 1997 was a $2 
billion industry, employing 260,000 people. The 
industry’s revenues have been growing by 50 per 
cent a year for the last five years, with over 60 per 
cent generated as export earnings. 
The Internet is an important part of the weight- 
less economy. Narrowly, it might be regarded as 
nothing more than one specific concrete manifesta- 
tion of progress in information and communications 
technology. One might then simply say that it is the 
result of rapid and dramatic technical progress. But 
Internet technology could well have emerged 
without a specific application developed for it. His- 
torical examples abound where one side of a mar- 
ket—supply—comes on strong while the other— 
demand—Ianguishes, with the result that no ongoing 
development occurs. The fact that an Industrial 
Revolution did not occur in fourteenth-century 
China, despite its technological ad vances—super- 
ior to those in the West—attests tragically to that. 
A dramatic reduction 
in transaction costs 
But the Internet is not such an example. Radio, 
a relatively simple, undemanding technology, took 
forty years to achieve fifty million regular users. The 
Internet took four. T his happened partly because 
the Internet makes it easier to deliver what partici- 
pants in the economy have always needed: cheaper 
and easier exchange, faster dissemination of infor- 
mation, reduced inventories, greater outreach in 
both supply chain and distribution channels. 
But perhaps more telling, this extraordinary 
growth arises from the fact that the Internet makes 
possible what previously was impossible. While tan- 
gible goods can be sold over the Internet, their 
actual delivery to the consumer will always be slow 
and will always eat up transportation costs. By 
contrast, the Internet can deliver directly weight- 
less-economy goods and services. Health care coun- 
seling and education (two large expensive sectors in 
most advanced economies, where historically pro- 
ductivity growth has been famously low), news, 
software, music, advertising, video entertainment, 
securities, banking and other financial services, 
database access and consulting services can all be 
provided over the Internet—unlike haircuts and 
janitorial services. The result will be a dramatic

reduction in transaction costs. Productivity will rise 
in precisely those areas that,traditionally, have seen 
poor productivity performance. 
In the US, the fastest growth in jobs is found 
precisely in sectors associated with the weightless 
economy. From 1996 through 2006, the industry 
with top employment growth is projected to be 
computer and data-processing services, at 108 per 
cent. The next fastest-growing industry is expec- 
ted to be health services, at 68 per cent. T he Bureau 
of Labor Statistics forecasts that the occupations 
with fastest employment growth will be database 
administration, computer services, and computer 
scientists (118 per cent); computer engineers (109 
per cent); systems engineers (103 per cent); and 
then personal and home care aides (85 per cent). 
Wages earned in these industries and occupations 
are also high. In 1997, the average worker in the 
IT industry earned twice the national average 
across the private sector. 
New rules 
and logic 
All components of the weightless economy can 
be represented, without loss, as “bitstrings”— 
sequences of 1s and Os. (This doesn’t mean they 
are digital in the sense used in relation to compu- 
ters. An advertising image is a bitstring, but it is 
not insightfully viewed as part of computers and 
computer networks.) Since ideas and knowledge 
can also be represented in this manner, it is an easy 
step to identify them with the rest of the weightless 
economy. To minimize confusion I will call the bits- » 


### 114259: A Weightless economy

What is the weightless 
economy? 
TT: weightless economy— also described as the knowledge economy, the intangible economy, 
the immaterial economy or simply the “ new” economy— comprises four main elements. First, 
  
there isinformation and communications technology (ICT) and the Internet. Second, intellectual pro- 
perty, which includes not only patentsand copyrights but more broadly, brand-names, trademarks 
advertising, financial and consulting services, financial exchanges, health care (medical knowledge), 
and education. The third element consists of electronic libraries and databases, including new 
media, video entertainment, and broadcasting. The fourth element comprises biotechnology, tradi- 
tional libraries and databases, and pharmaceuticals 
These four elements constitute the fastest-growing sectors in modern economies— whe- 
ther measured in value added or employment and job growth. Everything on the list contains ele- 
ments of intangibility and can be regarded as knowledge. 
How ever, we should not over-emphasize the importance of ideasand knowledge in trying to 
understand the weightless economy. Economies have been knowledge-based for at least five 
thousand years. Sumerians in the Mesopotamian river basin began carving cuneiform financial 
records onto clay tablets 5,000 years back. During the first Industrial Revolution, deploying spin- 
ning Jennies and steam engines significantly boosted economic performance. Such machines 
were the physical embodiment of new knowledge. 
But while steam engines or clay tablets are physical objects which contain knowledge, they 
do not resemble knowledge in their use. Their uses are bound by geographical and physical 
constraints. An oil supertanker is not part of the weightless economy, but computer software is

tring pieces of the weightless economy knowled ge- 
products. This emphasizes their symbolic simila- 
rity to knowledge but, at the same time, maintains 
their distinctness. T here are three points to bear in 
mind. 
First, like knowled ge, knowledge-products show 
infinite expansibility (a term due originally toTho- 
mas Jefferson). They do not get used up, physically. 
T he usefulness of computer software is not reduced 
the more users run it. Advertising imagery does not 
diminish in impact the more people view it; indeed, 
the opposite holds. 
The same terminology is apt for how a know- 
ledge-product—unlike, say, a typical durable 
good—disrespects geographical distance. A know- 
led ge-product behaves as if it expands to fill all avai- 
lable space. I can, in London, use a piece of software 
located on some satellite server encircling the earth 
while someone else in Stanford, California, does 
exactly the same, with the identical piece of soft- 
ware. This holds true for any intellectual property or 
libraries and databases. It does not apply for,say, a 
chocolate-chip cookie. When someone eats a 
 
The impact of an image is not diminished 
the more people look at it. 
The value that the Nike shoe company generates 
is not the raw material in its shoes, but the culture 
associated with them 
cookie,it 1s no more. 
Second, like knowledge, knowledge-products 
show superstar dynamics. To understand this, 
consider first the wheel. Society does not reward 
reinvention of the wheel, but multiple implemen- 
tations of (the idea of) a wheel do get properly com- 
pensated. However, those multiple instances are 
fashioned out of hard physical material which the 
buyer pays for. 
Knowledge-products,by contrast,are the idea 
and implementation rolled in one—multiple imple- 
mentations require no physical material. For 
example, the fastest way to appreciate an idea in 
computer software is to see that software running; 
the only way to value the contents of a computer 
database is to access the database itself; the only 
way to understand a gene sequence is to see it 
expressed in a lifeform.In short, we cannot distin- 
guish between the product and the idea behind it. 
In this context, reproductions of an original 
knowled ge-product should fetch zero price in a well- 
functioning market. Superstar dynamics refers to 
this first-(or winner)-takes all characteristic shared by 
both knowledge and knowledge-products. 
However, this zero-price property does not say 
that knowledge-products are valueless: water is 
essential to human welfare, but its price in modern 
societies is, for all practical purposes,zero. Bundling 
water with something else—adding carbonation to 
water, extracting it from certain distinguished 
springs, associating it with a powerful advertising 
image—can, of course, be a rewarding enterprise. 
Businesses can and do add value, similarly to many 
knowledge-products in the weightless economy.

For example, the value that the Nike shoe company 
generates is not the raw material in its shoes, but the 
culture associated with them. The value that the 
consultancy firm JP Morgan generates by giving 
away its raw data is not in the data itself but in the 
bundling of that information with a particular 
financial perspective—and who better to continue 
to develop that perspective than JP Morgan itself. 
For many software companies,rewards don’t lie in 
the software itself, but the services provided and 
the organizing of a community of users. 
Labs for producing 
intellectual property 
Third, like knowledge, knowledge-products 
have a chain of production that is irrecoverably 
intricate and uncertain. Applying more factor 
inputs in an effort to increase output can be self- 
defeating.Just as making nine men pregnant for a 
month fails to produce a new-born baby, throwing 
more programmers at a software project does not 
typically make a complete piece of software faster, 
better, or more reliable. Similarly, financial consul- 
ting, a musical composition, or devising the cen- 
tral image in an advertising campaign calls not for 
many hands, but few. The same dynamic applies 
with scientific discoveries; many researchers work 
on the same problem to reach the same discovery 
simultaneously. 
These three properties imply that the way busi- 
nesses operate should change and that appropriate 
government policies will need to acknowledge those 
changes. As a first step, one might think of econo- 
mies comprised entirely of knowledge-products— 
weightless economies—as being like large labora- 
tories for producing intellectual property broadly 
defined. T he problem is that the systems of intel- 
lectual property for organizing patents and copy- 
rights are based on principles and conceptions 
which no longer apply in the weightless economy. 
The question is not whether a new set of market 
rules has emerged, but the ways in which people, 
governments and firms can respond to them. HW

### 114260: The Emperor's new clothes

The emperor's 
new clothes 
Noted American economist Paul Krugman believes 
there may be less to the ‘new economy’ doctrine than 
meets the eye 
prosperity and social well-being has dawned 
for America,and hence the world. There will 
be limitless growth and in all likelihood recessions 
will be a thing of the past. This is the message that 
a section of the American press has been proclai- 
ming in the last two years. 
“All the elements are in place for an era of long- 
term growth,” trumpeted BusinessWeek in August 
1998,going on to say, “You ain’t seen nothing yet. 
We're just at the start of a powerful surge in tech- 
nology that will boost economic gains into the next 
century.” The monthly Wired, a pillar of the 
“connected society”, has devoted several issues to 
thisnew economy based on a logic of networks and 
cyberspace which,so it is claimed,has superseded 
the old economy of the industrial era. Supporters of 
the new economy doctrine maintain that the health 
of the American economy in recent years (in 1997 
The “new economy” has arrived! An era of 
 
‘We have had a favourable turn in the business 
cycle . .. probably also helped by shifts in the labour 
market that have reduced the bargaining power of 
workers and therefore allowed fuller employment 
without accelerating wage increases. The success is 
real, but it is also modest, and falls far short of 
justifying the triumphant rhetoric one now hears so 
often.’ 
gross domestic product grew by almost 4 per cent, 
unemployment fell to 4.6 per cent, and inflation 
was less than 2 per cent) is not a passing phase. 
They regard these good results as the first fruits of 
a profound and lasting change due to increased 
business productivity, and insist that they are 
revolutionary. If they attract relatively little notice, 
it’s because they don’t show up in the usual statis- 
tical indicators,which were devised for yesterday's 
economy. 
However, those who sing the praises of the new 
economy have been pilloried by a number of lea- 
ding economists, headed by Paul Krugman of the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Krugman 
admits that “for the first time since the invention of 
printing, information processing and distribution 
has become one of the leading sectors,” but he also 
warns that the very low rates of inflation and high 
profits recently recorded in the United States do 
not justify the “millennial optimism” expressed in 
the business press and by some intellectuals. 
Above all, he believes that these good results 
are not linked to an exceptional degree to the extra- 
ordinary productivity increases associated with 
information technologies. Krugman and another 
American economist,Robert J. Gordon of North- 
western University, believe that periods of rapid 
growth in productivity have systematically been 
made possible by fundamental innovations ever 
since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. 
This process occurred with the coming of electricity 
and the internal combustion engine,and the same 
thing is happening today as a result of the Internet 
and electronics. 
Krugman estimates that the major aggregates of 
the American economy are continuing to obey clas- 
sical mechanisms. He believes that even if the sta- 
tistical apparatus may be out of date,that is no rea- 
son to underestimate the productivity figures. 
The “fundamentals”impro ved in recent years, 
he wrote in Foreign Affairs in May 1998, because 
“we have had a favourable turn in the business cycle 
... probably also helped by shifts in the labour mar- 
ket that have reduced the bargaining power of wor- 
kers and therefore allowed fuller employment 
without accelerating wage increases. T he success is 
real, but it is also modest,and falls far short of jus- 
tifying the triumphant rhetoric one now hears so 
often.” 
Finally, believers in the new economy doctrine 
maintain that if the United States has recovered its 
position of world economic leadership it is because 
of America’s advance in new technologies. Wrong, 
says Krugman. America’s economic competitors 
are not lagging behind because of their slowness to 
enter the new economy but for other reasons— 
Japan is enmeshed in crises,especially in banking, 
and Europe is facing constraints imposed by the 
construction of monetary union. “Our current 
sense that we are on top of the world is based on a 
huge exaggeration of a few good years here, a few 
bad years elsewhere,” he says. He notes that one 
good old maxim should not be forgotten: never 
underestimate the competition. A precept that not 
even the new economy seems likely to disprove. H

### 114262: Inclusion or exclusion?

Inclusion or 
Will the networked economy widen or narrow the gap between 
developing and industrialized countries? 
As we move from the industrial to the infor- 
A mation age, access to the global information 
infrastructure for economies, companies and 
individuals becomes paramount. 
The debate about the welfare implications of 
the information revolution for developing coun- 
tries has given rise to diametrically opposed views. 
Some believe that information and communica- 
tions technologies (ICT) can be mechanisms 
enabling developing countries to “leapfrog” stages 
of development. Others see the emerging global 
information infrastructure as contributing to even 
wider economic divergence between developing 
and industrialized countries. T he reality is more 
complex. 
A number of trends are broadly recognized as 
the hallmarks of the information age. First, ICT 
progress is expected to continue to promote the 
proliferation of communication networks as the 
costs of delivering these networks decline and the 
quality of their services improves. 
Second, in a networked environment, the incen- 
tives for specialization and outsourcing increase. 
This puts a premium on flexibility and responsive- 
ness as business cycles shorten and interactions 
between producers and consumers expand. 
Third, electronic commerce is expected to 
continue to expand rapidly and further contribute 
to the internationalization of service activities. 
Fourth,information flows are at the very core of 
the globalization process as countries and corpora- 
tions project power by promoting their own cul- 
ture and values on a global basis. 
These trends suggest that the countries that are 
better positioned to thrive in the new economy are 
those that can rely on: widespread access to com- 
munication networks for their companies and citi- 
zens; the existence of educated labour-force and 
consumers;and the availability of institutions that 
promote knowledge creation and dissemination. 
Against this background,developing countries 
seem to be at a significant disadvantage vis-a-vis 
industrialized countries. According to the World 
Bank, by 1995 low-income economies averaged less 
than 2.6 telephone lines per 100 inhabitants and 
less than two computers per 1,000 inhabitants, in 
contrast to a teledensity of 54.6 per 100 and a com- 
puter penetration of 199 per 1,000 in high-income 
economies. Internet penetration is even more ske- 
wed with the ten top countries (all of them indus- 
trialized economies) accounting for more than 85 
per cent of the existing worldwide Internet hosts 
by the end of 1997. 
Income inequality 
and computer literacy gaps 
The quality and coverage of schooling at all levels 
are also characterized by significant gaps between 
industrialized and developing countries. T hese gaps 
reinforce income inequality, not only internationally, 
but also within each nation as the ratio of female to 
male illiteracy tends to be higher the lower the level 
of economic development and the benefits of public 
education are typically skewed toward the richer 
classes. T he gaps are even more dramatic when trans- 
lated to the field of computer literacy. 
Finally, developing countries are ill equipped 
to implement pro-competitive regulatory regimes. 
In the same vein, the culture of protection and 
enforcement of intellectual property rights is often 
an alien concept. The same applies to reliance on 
networks to promote transparency and access to 
government services. 
All these indicators seem to point towards a 
social transformation that will increase rather than 
diminish economic divergence at the international 
level.Developing economies would be condemned 
to fall further behind in the international econo- 
mic race because of their lack of connectivity and 
ability to transform the information explosion into 
a knowledge revolution. Once one analyses the dri- 
vers of the information revolution,however, a dif- 
ferent picture begins to emerge. 
Technological developments are rapidly ero-

communication networks. Developing countries 
can, for example, leapfrog stages of development 
by investing into fully digitized networks rather than 
continuing to expand their outdated analog-based 
infrastructure.T here are advantages in being a fol- 
lower—e.g.,not having to cope with the technolo- 
gical obsolescence of well developed wireline net- 
works—and they are illustrated by the fact that 
low-income economies presented a higher share of 
digital telephone lines (94.7 per cent) than high- 
income economies (85.5 per cent) by 1996. ICT 
are also creating new development opportunities 
to address some of the handicaps of developing 
countries noted above. 
First, by developing a modern information 
infrastructure countries can reduce isolation and 
exclusion. Many countries are experiencing fast 
expansion of cellular telephony as an alternative to 
inefficient conventional network services. Wireless 
technology can also provide affordable connecti- 
vity to rural areas in a fraction of the time that was 
required in the past to expand conventional tele- 
phone networks. In Bangladesh, for example, “wire- 
less women” were given loans of $350 each by Gra- 
meen Bank to cover the initial costs of the

telephone, connection and training. T hey have now 
become service providers in the rural areas. Moreo- 
ver, community information centres with access to 
value-added services can be customized to the 
needs of the poor. In South Africa, for example, 
such centres are being used to provide access to the 
Internet and to help answer questions concerning 
health,employment,and human rights issues. 
Second, countries can accelerate educational 
development by using their information infra- 
structures for distance education. The costs and 
effectiveness of such programmes are improving 
dramatically. ICT is also being used for lifelong 
learning, opening opportunities for new players in 
education systems. In developing economies, the 
dynamism of these new entrants can challenge 
conventional educational systems and play a cata- 
lytic role in their transformation. 
Leapfrogging stages 
of development 
Third, a modern information infrastructure can 
also be a powerful force for better governance. It 
can, for example, enhance tax administration ,audi- 
ting and control. Morocco has significantly impro-

ved its tax revenue by computerizing the country’s 
tax administration. Moreover, countries can now 
automate their institutions administering intellec- 
tual property rights, strengthening their efficiency 
and enforcement capability at a fraction of the costs 
that prevailed in the past. 
In short, the logic of the networked economy is 
one of inclusion rather than one of exclusion. As 
technological progress continues to push the costs 
of computing and bandwidth down,opportunities 
for development-oriented applications of ICT will 
multiply. Moreover, for those already connected 
the value of the network increases exponentially as 
new participants join the community. 
Technological determinism 
and government policies 
These considerations point toward a more opti- 
mistic scenario for developing countries’ participa- 
tion in the emerging knowledge economy. 
Although, no doubt, income and wealth inequality 
may increase in the initial stages of the process, 
catch-up can also happen at a much faster pace 
than in the past.ICT spending, for example, grew 
more quickly in most developing regions than in 
high-income economies in the 1992-97 period. And 
countries like South Africa and Brazil already boast 
a higher share of networked personal computers 
than most industrialized economies. 
These scenarios can be criticized for sharing a 
common feature: technological determinism. The 
different outcomes predicted, however, illustrate 
that they are also influenced by other variables, in 
particular,government policies. 
If, for example,developing countries maintain 
regulatory barriers to the expansion of networks— 
e.g., by favouring monopolistic providers for tele- 
com services—the likelihood of the first scenario 
increases. In this case, global dualism will be magni- 
fied not only across the conventional North-South 
divide, but also in terms of country-level economic 
inequality as a small elite of connected people in the 
South benefit from the global information infra- 
structure. 
On the other hand, if regulatory roadblocks are 
properly addressed and efforts to promote univer- 
sal access to value-added networks and computer 
literacy are implemented, then the possibilities for 
catching up will proliferate. Participation in multi- 
lateral efforts—e.g.,negotiations conducted under 
the World Trade Organisation and the World Intel- 
lectual Property Organization—can also be used 
to leverage the process of institutional moderniza- 
tion. Under these circumstances, the benefits of the 
revolution will be widely disseminated both at 
national and international levels. 
The most likely outcome, however, is a combi- 
nation of both scenarios in which a subset of deve- 
loping countries is able to converge with high-income 
economies more quickly than ever before while 
others lag further behind. International efforts to 
promote pilot projects in this field can increase the 
number of countries in the first category. [|

Dell Computer gains time— and money— by 
using technology and information to blur 
traditional boundaries between a company 
and its customers

just 14 years? Michael Dell began in 1984 with 
a simple business insight. He could bypass the 
dealer channel through which personal computers 
were then sold. Instead, he would sell directly to 
customers and build customized products to order. 
In one swoop, Dell eliminated the reseller’s markup 
and the costs and risks associated with carrying 
large inventories of finished goods. The formula 
became known as the direct business model, and it 
gave Dell a substantial cost advantage. 
Dell’s product line has expanded over the years. 
In additon to desktop personal computers, the com- 
pany now sells a broader range of hard ware—lap- 
tops, servers, and workstations. But make no mis- 
take, Dell sells physical things, manufactured goods 
that must be assembled and transported and delive- 
red and serviced with a staff of about 22,000 world- 
wide and a base in Round Rock, Texas. It sounds alot 
like the old, tangible economy. 
Is Dell, then, stuck in the past of material goods 
and physical flows? Or is it part of the so-called “new 
economy” creating wealth through “intangible streams 
of data, images and symbols”. In fact, Dell is both. 
Companies have always thrived by offering cus- 
tomers superior value, giving them more for less. 
For the most part, they offer better value by shrin- 
king the time and the resources consumed in mee- 
ting customers’needs. The fundamental economic 
rules of business haven’t changed. But like many 
other companies today, Dell is harnessing the tools 
of the knowled ge economy—information and tech- 
nology—to bring new levels of efficiency and pro- 
ductivity to the old world of tangible goods. 
] How do you create an $18 billion company in 
Supplier partnerships 
Consider all the activities and resources that go 
into making and selling a computer. As a small 
start-up, Dell simply couldn’t afford to create every 
piece of that value chain. Instead, its strategy has 
been to build systems from components made by 
other companies. Let them invest in R&D and in 
factories. For each component, Dell evaluates the 
field and picks the best to be its suppliers. 
Dell then works so closely with them that they 
become, in Dell’s words, “virtually integrated”. 
While they remain independent companies, each 
free to focus on what it does best,they share infor- 
mation and co-ordinate their activities as if they 
were part of one vertically integrated company.

### 114263: Managing velocity

velocity 
Real-time information sharing with suppliers is 
the key to just-in-time assembly. Instead of having 
suppliers make periodic deliveries to a warehouse, 
Dell tells them the exact number of components it 
needs, at what hour of the day, delivered to which 
loading dock at its factory. This is precisely the kind 
of information a company would freely share with 
an internal supplier. 
Dell’s rule in working with partners is to have as 
few as possible, and to keep them as long as they 
maintain their technological and quality leadership. 
As Michael Dell notes, “This isn’t like the auto- 
mobile business, where you find a tire supplier that 
you will probably stick with forever.” Managed this 
way, supplier partnerships give Dell the flexibility to 
respond to changes in the market. 
Supplier partnerships aren’t new to the know- 
ledge economy, nor is just-in-time manufacturing. 
However,today’s technology enhances the econo- 
mic incentives to collaborate. Companies can share 
design databases and methodologies in ways that 
weren’t possible just five to ten years ago. Doing so 
can dramatically speed time to market, thus crea- 
ting substantial value which the buyer and supplier 
can share. 
Why time is money 
“In our industry,” Michael Dell explains, “if 
you can get people to think about how fast inven- 
tory is moving, then you create real value.T he key 
challenge—and the biggest change from business as 
usual—is changing the focus from how much inven- 
tory there is to how fast it’s moving.” 
Speed is critical for two reasons. First, in the

computer business the cost of components goes 
down as much as 50 per cent a year. The company 
with two or three months of inventory will be at a 
significant cost disadvantage to the company with 
eleven days because its products were built with 
more expensive parts. Second,in technology mar- 
kets with frequent product transitions, it’s easy to 
get stuck holding obsolete inventory, or to be late to 
market with the hottest new products. 
Co-ordination between companies is not new to 
the knowledge economy. However, such tight co- 
ordination would not be possible without sophisti- 
cated data exchange. Managing velocity is about 
managing information, using a constant flow of 
information to drive operating practices. In essence, 
Dell substitutes information for inventory. 
The result is that Dell turns its inventory over 
thirty times per year, an extraordinary feat given the 
complexity of its product line. But without credible 
information about what customers are actually 
buying, says Dell, “trying to manage eleven days of 
inventory would be insane. We couldn’t do it without 
customers who work with us as partners.” 
Forecasting customer needs 
Working closely with customers is critical to the 
Dell strategy. With the direct model, Michael Dell 
explains, “You actually get to have a relationship with 
the customer. And that creates valuable information.” 
Ninety per cent of Dell’s sales go to institu- 
tions—business or government—and 70 per cent to 
very large customers that buy at least $1 million in 
PCs a year. With those large customers, D ell main- 
tains an on-site team that functions less as a vendor 
and more as the customer’s information techno- 
logy department for PCs. T he team will typically be 
involved in planning the customer’s PC needs and 
the configuration of their network. Thus Dell’s sales 
account managers have unusually good informa- 
tion on what each customer intends to buy. 
Smaller customers buy direct from Dell over 
the telephone. Not only can Dell compile real-time 
data about what’s selling, but its salespeople can 
also steer customers, while they're on the phone, 
toward product configurations that are available— 
further using information to fine-tune the balance 
between supply and demand. 
In short, by eliminating the middleman, Dell cap- 
tures valuable information from customers—which it 
uses to lower its inventory, its costs, and its risks. Infor- 
mation from the customer flows all the way through 
manufacturing to Dell’s suppliers, making the whole 
an efficient and flexible system. In this way, the direct 
model allows Dell to build computers to meet real 
demand from real end customers. 
Beyond substituting information for inventory, 
Dell combines technology and information to blur

the traditional boundaries that separate a company 
from its customers. 
Consider technical support. Dell has made it 
possible for its customers to access its internal sup- 
port tools on-line in the same way as Dell’s own 
technical support teams do. In effect, Dell is 
enabling the customer to service itself, saving time 
and money on both sides. 
New roles for customers 
Dell has done something analogous with its sel- 
ling function. It has developed customized Intranet 
sites called Premier Pages for well over 400 of its 
largest global customers, giving them direct access 
to purchasing and technical information. A custo- 
mer can allow its thousands of employees to use 
the Premier Page as a kind of interactive catalogue 
of all the model configurations that the company 
authorizes;employees can then price and order the 
PC they want. Employees are happy to have some 
choice, and Dell and the customer both eliminate 
all the paperwork and sales time normally associa- 
ted with corporate purchasing. 
Beyond Dell’s mechanisms for sales and sup- 
port, the company has set up a number of forums to 
exchange information with the customer. Platinum

For the past six years, the computer services 
a company De Chazal Du Mée (DCDM) 
Consulting has worked hard to establish itself 
in the sunny island of Mauritius. It has thought 
big and taken a gamble by developing and exporting 
its own software. 
With a score of other firms, DCDM Consul- 
ting is a pioneer among the computer companies 
which have recently sprung up in the island. Most 
of these firms have gone into data inputting for big 
European companies. The government agency 
which promotes new technology, the National 
Computer Board (NCB), says about fifty firms are 
also selling hardware. 
DCDM Consulting was started in 1992, when 
the computer industry was beginning to take off.

Asia-Pacific, Japan, the US, and Europe—of Dell’s 
largest customers. In these meetings, Dell’s senior 
technologists share their views on where the tech- 
nology is heading over the next two years and listen 
to customers talking about their needs. Helping the 
customer anticipate the flow of new technology 
helps Dell, as well, in thinking about new product 
offerings and in forecasting demand. 
Most of the managerial challenges at Dell 
Computer have to do with speeding the pace of 
every element of its business. Life cycles are mea- 
sured in months, not years, and companies must 
move fast to stay in the game. In a world where 
customer needs and technologies change quickly, 
managers must sense and respond to rapid shifts, 
process new information very quickly and make 
decisions in real time. 
In that context,Internet commerce has been a 
logical extension of Dell’s direct model. Dell began 
selling direct on the Net in 1996. Within the first 
year, Dell reached a run rate of $2 million a day, a 
figure that has grown to roughly $6 million a day in 
1998. “Because what we're all about is shrinking 
the time and the resources it takes to meet custo- 
mers’needs,” explains Michael Dell, “I'm only half

Since 1989, when the NCB was set up, the 
government has been concentrating on pushing the 
computerization of the island’s firms. It has brought 
in foreign experts, mostly from Singapore, and pro- 
vided incentives such as low-interest loans and cus- 
toms duty exemptions for companies importing 
material to computerize their operations.

sends them overseas on a sub-contract basis. “We 
have always been dependent on intermediaries,” 
says Dharmavasan. “But now our aim is to esta- 
blish direct links with our clients so that we can 
increase profits. The market is extremely competi- 
tive, and if we quote higher rates our orders will 
automatically go to India or the Philippines.” 
Low overheads and 
import duty exemptions 
At present, there are sixty small and medium- 
sized data processing and software companies in 
Sri Lanka. Theyhad a turnover of around $25 mil- 
lion in 1998. Experts point out that they are no lon- 
ger hindered by problems of transmitting their work 
(via Internet) since the state has invested in moder- 
nization of the country’s telecommunication sys- 
tems. T hey also benefit from low overheads,exemp- 
tion from customs duty on computer and software 
imports, and above all from the availability of cheap 
labour. Data processing professionals earn an ave- 
rage of $600 a month (compared to $3,500 in deve- 
loped countries). But the industry would be gro- 
wing faster were it not for the relative shortage of 
skilled IT professionals. 
This shortage of human resources is the coun- 
try’s major handicap in relation to India. “In this 
respect our neighbour is ten years ahead of us,” 
Dhananjava Chandrasekera, JKCS’s software direc- 
tor, points out. “At present we have 95 professio- 
nals,” Dominic adds. “We badly need another fifty 
employees right away, but unfortunately it is not 
easy to get computer graduates in Sri Lanka.” Sri 
Lanka produces about 200 computer graduates a 
year whereas the growing industry needs at least 
1,000 professionals, and so companies are now tur- 
ning to well-trained diploma holders from private 
institutions. To get hold of competent staff, JKCS 
has made an agreement with the National Institute 
of Information Technology (NIIT), a noted Indian 
computer training centre which recently opened 
branches in Colombo and Kandy, in the south of 
Sri Lanka. 
“The computer business is the only field in 
which a young Sri Lankan professional can start 
out earning $600 a month and double or even triple 
his earning power within a matter of months,” 
Dominic explains. “More and more Sri Lankans 
are turning to computers and this augurs well for 
the future.”

country has chosen to enter at the top end of the mar- 
kets, by moving into high-value-added activities. 
The Vietnamese are not interested in data 
inputting factories. Despite approaches from seve- 
ral foreign investors, this kind of “low tech” work is 
not very common, except at times of major national 
surveys such as a population census. 
Just as the opening-up of the economy proclai- 
med in 1986 was finally getting off the ground, the 
communist government agreed in 1993 on an ambi- 
tious “master plan” to develop information techno- 
logy. The plan, which onlyreally got going three years 
ago and runs until the year 2000, declares that “prio- 
rity will be given to developing a software industry”. 
Nguyen Kim Anh, the Moscow and Paris-edu- 
cated head of the plan’s research and training centre, says 
developing software is the only possible way forward for 
a country as poor as Viet Nam, whose per capita income 
is no more than $300. She says that “neither the govern- 
ment, the private sector nor the universities have the 
money to invest seriously in hardware development.” 
- A stone’s throw from the mausoleum of the late 
Tinkering students 
The “master plan” covers all sectors—public 
administration, with the setting-up of departmental 
socio-economic databases accessible by intranet; 
banking and finance, with the dissemination of 
reliable information about the future stock exchange; 
defence and security; and industry itself. The govern- 
ment has promised to take steps to “help and encou- 
rage” public and private firms. “So far, our job has 
been to create an environment friendly to informa- 
tion technology,” says Nguyen Kim Anh.“Compu- 
terization of university administration and laborato- 
ries is now quite advanced. But elsewhere, all we 
have at the moment are feasibility studies.”

### 114266: Viet Nam: diving in at the deep end

The country is relying primarily on its brainpo- 
wer. T he Vietnamese are renowned in Southeast Asia 
for their mathematical and computer skills. “Our 
students have a definite talent,” says Michel Mouys- 
sinat, head of the French-SpeakingWorld’s Institute 
for Computing (IFI), “but they enjoy tinkering more 
than working on complicated programmes which 
need teamwork.” 
Nguyen Kim Anh agrees:“We’ve got quite good 
technicians but we don’t have enough designers of 
complex systems,” she says. T his is why the govern- 
ment is trying to lure home Vietnamese computer 
technicians who have gone to live in the West. The 
authorities are also stepping up efforts to have 
researchers trained in Europe,North America and 
Australia. And along with help arriving through aid 
organizations like IFI, the Vietnamese education 
ministry is encouraging the establishment of special 
courses at the National University, at Ho Chi Minh 
City University and at Hanoi’s Polytechnic School. 
Viet Nam has another advantage:its cheap but 
The knowledge economy When ideas are capital 
trained workforce. “A technician is recruited at a 
starting salary of $250 a month,” says Mouyssinat. 
But the market tends to push the good ones into 
higher-paying jobs, blunting their competitive edge 
in relation to other poor countries. Foreign com- 
panies grab the best technicians, who can negotiate 
salaries of about $800 a month after a few years. 
In relation to their foreign competitors, local 
firms have one handicap: politically and economi- 
cally-imposed restrictions on high-speed phone 
connexions. The government wants to keep control 
of the flow of information and the Internet service 
provider in Viet Nam is a public firm with a mono- 
poly. This means “a line supporting a 64 K modem 
speed costs $3,500 a month,” says Michel Dau- 
guet, a multimedia publisher in Hanoi who runs 
the Pacific Rim company. “And even at that price, 
we still don’t have access to all our foreign part- 
ners. This hampers our business of re-exporting 
software.” [|

### 114267: A Philosophy on four wheels

  
A philosophy on four wheels 
Even in a traditional sector like the automobile industry, 
the idea of selling a service— mobility—rather than the car to provide it, 
is gaining ground 
If you look at the advertisements of any car 
manufacturer, their most striking feature is 
the vehicle the firm wants to sell you.Its qua- 
lities are presented in all kinds of ways designed to 
whet the customer’s appetite—its gleaming body- 
work (for people who like an eye-catching product), 
its reliability (to attract careful drivers), its size (for 
the family motorist), its sobriety (to curry favour 
with the environmentalists; the throaty roar of its 
engine to excite roadhogs.T he product dictates the 
message. 
Advertisements for the so-called “smart” car 
(always deliberately written with a small “s”) are 
doing exactly the opposite. There is nothing on the 
cover of the smart car brochure except a tiny phrase 
right in the middle of the page which says in very 
simple lettering: “reduce to the max”. This is 
understandable for a “car configurator” (the word 
“manufacturer” is shunned) which in recent weeks 
has been advertising a car only 2.5 metres long 
including the bumpers. 
The firm’s website is a bit more forthcoming. 
T he first page has two sentences each dominated by 
a huge “P”—"“A product with a philosophy” and 
“A philosophy with a product”. Hans Jiirg Schr, 
head of sales and marketing, calls it “two-thirds 
product and one-third philosophy”. 
What may turn out to be a revolution in a sec- 
tor which symbolizes the industrial world began 
with an observation, an inventor and a colossus. 
The observation was that on journeys through »

towns for work reasons, only one car in five had 
someone in the front passenger seat and only one in 
ten had anyone in the back. 
So the developers of the “smart”came up with 
a car which,they say, “generously”’has two seats in 
front and, “after studying the problem”, no seats in 
the back. This mini-car also takes up only half a 
parking space, thus easing an infuriating problem 
for urban motorists. 
The inventor is Nicolas G. Hayek, the Swiss 
designer of the Swatch,which shook up the watch 
industry. Without his “ideas and determination”, 
says Schir, the project would have stayed on the 
drawing-board. It is not surprising that the little 
car seems so much like a toy or a ball, coloured and 
adjustable, whose owners can change its body 
panels whenever they like. And it was Hayek who, 
by putting his “dream world”on the table,persua- 
ded the colossus—Mercedes—to help set up the 
new firm Micro Compact Car (MCC). 
The personal mobility concept 
This alliance of inventiveness and established 
know-how might have simply produced something 
which was original and technically sound. But MCC 
says it is selling much more than that. It offers a “phi- 
losophy” in the form of a service: “personal mobi- 
lity”. 
The buyer gets a car with four wheels at a price 
which includes a package of guarantees, mainte- 
nance, repairs, insurance and easy payment terms, 
but all manufacturers make similar offers these days. 
The difference is that the owner of a “smart” also 
   
  
-_— 
gets, from the moment of purchase and progressively 
thereafter special access to a range of public and pri- 
vate transport to make up for the car’s limitations 
where distance and passengers are concerned. T his 
includes trains and planes, as well as cars for a larger 
number of people to make the occasional long trip. 
And that’s not all. Hayek is dreaming of an even 
cheaper car than the “smart” (which costs about 
$10,000)—one that pollutes less, has more mechani- 
cal innovations and can be used in an even more revo- 
lutionary way. He wants to start a kind of joint owner- 
ship system, or car-sharing, where the owner only 
uses it for very brief periods when he or she really 
needs it. 
In fact, potential purchasers are being asked, 
according to the advertising, to “drop old habits” 
which are still so cumbersome, in fact give up the 
idea of car-owning in the traditional sense, with all 
the social significance of ownership, and to just 
acquire a service.Mercedes, the colossus, disagreed 
with Hayek, the inventor, about that, and they 
recently parted company. [|

as its rivals, despite its advanced technology, the 
vehicle’s “configurators” have, among other 
things, altered the standard process of car design and 
manufacture. 
Suppliers whose role was once limited to 
making small parts designed by the car-maker, have 
become partners in the car’s conception and pro- 
duction to the extent that the biggest among them 
now turn out whole sets of parts in the assembly 
plant itself. 
This kind of amalgamation is very unusual 
because the vertical division of tasks and the hierarchy 
it creates are still the rule in the automobile industry, 
even if things are less rigid than they once were. In 
Brazil, for example, where an investment of $20 billion 
is expected to produce three million vehicles in 2003, 
there is a kind of three-tier manufacturing system. 
The big multinational car-makers simply assemble 
vehicles locally using parts supplied by sub-contrac- 
tors belonging to the second and third tiers of the sys- 
tem—some firms manufacture the parts and others 
manufacture components for those parts. 
- To keep the smart car’s price about the same One spare parts manufacturer is PRW Auto- 
motive, an American multinational with a $360- 
million annual turnover and 2,900 workers spread 
over eight plants in Brazil.“Our parts are designed 
in association with the car-maker,” says Helder 
Boccaletti,the firm’s marketing director. “Wetake 
part in project development, we design the part and 
then pass on instructions to our components sup- 
plier at the tier below.” 
Metalp6 is one of these suppliers which comes 
into the picture at the end of the chain of com- 
mand, far from the point of design.It is one of the 
very few companies which survived the opening- 
up of the Brazilian car market to foreign competi- 
tion in the early 1990s. At its factory in Sdo Paulo, 
it has 200 workers who produce an $18-million 
annual turnover, only 10 per cent of which is 
exports. Fifteen years ago, two-thirds of its custo- 
mers were car assembly firms and the rest were 
parts manufacturers. Today the proportions are the 
other way round. [|

The art of advertising 
Interview with Oliviero Toscani, Benetton art 
director and photographer 
How has advertising changed 
with the emergence of the immaterial 
economy? 
There is a crisis in advertising. The industry is 
lagging behind social trends, but it’s so rich and 
powerful that it’s very difficult for it to change. 
In the early twentieth century advertising focused 
on a company’s buildings and machines. After that it 
started presenting products. T hen, since all products 
started looking alike, they could no longer be at the 
heart of the message. So in the 1960s advertisers star- 
ted showing leggy models to sell cars. The long legs 
offered added value. The product took a back seat 
and what was sold was a symbol. The problem with

Customized messages 
ristian Blanchasse is the producer of Culture Pub, a television programme broadcast on Fran- 
ce’s M6 channel, and the director of the weekly CB News Communication. He agrees that 
advertising is facing the emergence of a new economy of abundance and more demanding, better- 
informed consumers. But he is also aware of the transition to an individualistic society and increa- 
sing audience and media fragmentation.” Twenty years ago everyone was watching the same two 
or three television channels. It was easy to develop a single message intended for the whole popu- 
lation. Today society and families are split up.” This situation hasled to the growing importance of 
direct marketing on mass campaigns. “ Advertising is adapting by trying to understand people bet- 
terin order to send them customized messages. More and more specialized companies are polling 
individuals and trying to figure out their personalities by overlapping all the information about 
them that they can get their hands on.” Blanchasse predictsthat new technologies will increase socie- 
ty's fragmentation. Yesterday shopping was a family affair. Today, “ on Internet the individual is the 
one who chooses and makes the purchases. The world is changing.” | 
this technique is that the message is always based on 
consumers’shortcomings and makes them feel guilty. 
It tells them, “if you haven’t got this product, you're 
out of it.” On the other hand, if you buy a certain 
brand of sports shoes you can play like Ronaldo even 
if you can’t kick a ball. 
A second technique is repetition. Professionals 
think people remember a product if they see the same 
commercial over and over again.T hat drives up costs. 
But all the commercials end up looking so much alike 
that you don’t know which brand theyre advertising 
any more. Who wins?T he companies with the biggest 
guns, in other words the most money. Who pays?The 
consumer, because on average advertising accounts for 
15 per cent of a product’s sales price. People in the rich 
countries sink hundreds of millions of dollars into 
advertising every year. It doesn’t make sense any 
more. T he system is so sick it’s not going to be around 
much longer. 
Why should it change? 
Because consumers are smarter than advertisers. T he 
system worked as long as people were really interes- 
ted in the products, because they needed them. But 
today, in the rich countries, they own enough shirts, 
sweaters and television sets for three entire lifetimes. 
So they consume less and better: more travel, more 
culture. They’re also very well-informed and much 
more demanding. They think before buying. And 
many people, starting with youth, think that consu- 
ming is a way of integrating. They buy certain pro- 
ducts to be accepted by society or their community. 
T hey take refuge in an imaginary world, while their 
lives are full of fear and unhappiness. 
How should advertisers adapt to these new 
consumer patterns? 
They have to be more creative, but the advertising 
industry couldn’t care less about creativity. It wants 
to perpetuate the system to keep on living off it. The 
fact is that advertisers must explain the client com- 
pany’s philosophy. If theyre successful, consumers 
will work out for themselves that the products are 
good. To capture their attention, advertising must 
become an artistic product in itself, like a play or a 
film.T hat has never happened because the only 
things that condition the industry are money and 
marketing managers, who are idiots. All they know 
how to do is repeat what’s already been done. 
To be successful advertising has to disconnect the 
message from the product and forget about marke- 
ting, which standardizes everything. I don’t do the 
same thing other people do. I use products to focus 
on the major problems besetting humanity. I've 
proved that it can be profitable. Since I've been wor- 
king for Benetton, the company has grown tenfold. 
Advertising people hate me but they have to admit 
that I’ve won. [

### 114270: The Future of work

The future o 
The advent of an ‘intangible’ economy does not mean the end of work. 
But it does mean the end of familiar routines and rhythms, of job security, 
of rigid hierarchies and career planning 
transformation of the economy. Are we hea- 
ding for “the end of work” predicted by the 
American economist Jeremy Rifkin? He and his 
supporters say we have reached the end of the road. 
We are no longer creating jobs in industry and auto- 
mation is sure to reduce their number in the ser- 
vices sector. T he quantity of work is thus inexorably 
bound to decrease. i 
This thesis may be popular, but it is also mistaken 
and harmful. History shows that technological inno- | 
vation has always created jobs on a large scale. In no 
way is the current trend leading to “the end of work”. ; 
Just the opposite: the new economy contains huge E 
pools of new jobs which can more than make up for 
the inevitable loss of traditional jobs. 
Dematerialization—the shift away from mate- 
rial products—is revolutionizing all aspects of 
work—its nature, its organization and its relation- 
ship with other activities. Its function is no longer 
just the manufacture of physical objects but the 
handling of data, images and symbols. The content 
of jobs is becoming more abstract.Skilled workers 
need to know a lot more about mathematics than 
their fathers or grandfathers did. Even milking cows 
and manufacturing require more and more calcu- 
lation,evaluation and control. 
People are worried about the far-reaching 
  
Financial markets 
that never sleep 
The organization as well as the product of work 
is also becoming increasingly intangible. The unity 
of time, space and action which characterized work 
in the industrial economy has disintegrated. Work is 
no longer a regular eight-hours-a-day, five-days-a- 
week routine. New rhythms have appeared—the 
hectic pace of financial markets which never sleep, 
the ups-and-downs of life in show business and the 
uncertainties of “just-in-time” production where 
components are delivered a few moments before 
the final product is assembled. 
The new jobs are quitting familiar workplaces 
such as factories, offices and warehouses. Telework 
is increasing. Europe’s teleworkers may number 10 
million by the year 2000, up from one million in 
1994. 
This upheaval of worktime and workspace is 
going hand in hand with a functional explosion.

all the time. In the United States, the number of 
job categories has risen from eighty in the 1940s 
to nearly 800 today. At the same time, trades are 
dying out faster and faster, especially in information 
technology where many jobs have a short life of 
only a few years. Jobs are becoming simultaneously 
more evanescent and more pervasive, more disso- 
ciated and more integrated. On the one hand, frag- 
mentation in time and space seems to be more 
extensive than it was in the industrial economy. On 
the other,information technology is strengthening 
the links between different stages of work and crea- 
ting an overall fluidity. 
Disparities in 
productivity 
The new forms of work are non-linear. When 
handling information, knowledge and feelings, 
there is no direct relationship between the amount 
of effort and the final result. This makes for very 
wide disparities in productivity. In industry, the 
ratio of the performance of an average worker to 
that of a good one is no more than one to five. But 
in immaterial work, an excellent programmer can 
be a hundred times more productive than an ave- 
rage one. 
Non-linear work means non-linear organiza- 
tion. T he notion of a rigid,formal hierarchy based 
on unchanging criteria no longer makes much 
sense. All that matters now is technical, scientific or 
artistic skill and the ability to establish a solid rela- 
tionship with the customer. Functional hierarchy is 
replaced by what Thomas Stewart, a journalist with 
the American monthly magazine Fortune, calls 
“brainpower” —authority gravitates to those who 
create and control the new stock of intangible 
assets:data, brand image, technological know-how 
and human capital. 
The new techniques for managing human 
resources are individualizing the assessment of per- 
formance. Two people doing the same job may have 
different salaries and different status. Automatic 
across-the-board pay rises are being dropped and 
replaced by bonuses linked to results. There are no 
sinecures in the new business enterprise,either for 
rank-and-file employees, supervisors or techni- 
cians—the supposed beneficiaries of the new know- 
ledge economy.

Learning 
is the key 
ore jobs are needed, but “ nothing indicatesthat the 
M new flood of innovations will make work in general 
less tedious and alienating,” says Bruno Trentin, former 
secretary-general of Italy's General Labour Confederation 
(CGIL). Trentin,who heads the CGILs projects committee, 
agreesthat “ fordism” — mass production standardized with 
the help of a technological monopoly, is “dying”. But he 
says that “taylorism”, the equivalent arrangement in the 
labour force, “where all knowledge is in the hands of the 
decision-maker and the worker does not have to think or 
know anything, is still going strong. 
“Behind all the talk and the public gestures, the old 
style of management continues It can delegate some res- 
ponsibility to workers but notably without recognizing their 
basic right to training and retraining, which is becoming a 
crucial part of any employment contract.So things are way 
behind here, and the big danger is that new technical forms 
of division of labour will arise.” 
On the one hand will be “ those with access to know- 
ledge and ability to control the processes of learning,” and 
on the other “the excluded, who will be even more subor- 
dinate in the workplace and will be divided up and parti- 
tioned off, even in work which seems highly-skilled. 
“Afirm’s long-term interest is to improve the quality of 
its work force” so it can take advantage of technological 
possibilities, but, saysTrentin, “in the short term, why invest 
in someone who isonly staying six monthsin a job because 
of labour flexibility?” So“ if we want an employment policy 
based on a level of education and knowledge which are 
being constantly renewed, we mustn't count on market 
forces or the goodwill of companies” [| 
cies. The head of a big American firm is ten times 
more likely to be sacked for poor performance now 
than was the case twenty years ago. The notions of 
loyalty and of indissoluble links between a firm and 
its employees are losing their meaning. 
The changing nature of work has led to a big 
increase in so-called non-typical jobs, including 
part-time, temporary and flexi-time work and 
short-term contracts. Almost all the jobs created in 
Europe between 1992 and 1996 were part-time. 
This trend worries many observers who see it as 
hidden under-employment or disguised unem- 
ployment.But they are overly pessimistic. 
The growth of non-typical jobs is the result of 
the convergence of several persistent developments. »

Where the new jobs are 
he shrinking number of jobs in traditional sectors of the economy seems to be a general and 
irreversible trend. In rich countries asa whole, the share of industrial jobs fell from 28 per cent 
in 1970 to 18 per cent in 1994. 
Meanwhile, the share of the services sector grew steadily. Four major new sources of jobs can 
be identified: 
Handling information and knowledge: computer services research and development, 
teaching and training account for 40 per cent of know ledge workers. These high-intensity know- 
ledge activities comprised 43 per cent of all new jobs created in the United States between 1990 
and 1995,but only 28 per cent of total jobs 
Information technology: here there is a shortage of personnel.Professional groups are 
sounding the alarm and calling on governments to help. In the European Union countries, the 
imbalance between supply and demand is such that half a million jobs are waiting to be filled. 
The health sector:the growth of high-intensity knowledge services in this field is related 
to increased life expectancy and the ageing of the population,and the demand for physical and 
psychological well-being is also steadily increasing. The growth of expenditure on health is per- 
sistent and widespread. For the OECD countries asa whole, this spending grew from 3.9 per cent 
of GDP in 1960 to 7.2 per cent in 1980 and 8.4 per cent in 1992. 
The leisure economy: this has triggered the expansion of cultural, sporting and leisure ser- 
vices It ranges from amusement parks and rock concerts to cultural events such as opera and major 
art exhibitions The products of the culture industries have become mass consumer items. Never 
before have people read so much, listened to so much classical music or visited so many museums. 
Information technology is also going to add to this vast range of consumer choice. In southern Cali- 
fornia and New York, the entertainment and multimedia professions are among the main sources 
of new jobs In Los Angeles film- and television-related activities created 40,000 jobs between 
1992 and 1997,and Hollywood became the city's main employer. C.G.m 
3 6 The Unesco Courier - December 1998 
More and more jobs involve measurement,evaluation and control. 
In the labour market, the increase in non-typical 
jobs is one of the ways in which employers are 
responding to the pressures of competition and 
adapting to a global economy which functions 
seven days a week, twenty-four hours a day. To cope 
with the new situation, firms are having to figure out 
how they can use their workers more efficiently and 
flexibly. 
The growth of non-traditional jobs is also due to 
changing demand. Consumers want to be able to 
buy a very wide range of goods and services at the 
drop of a hat, or amuse themselves any time, anyw- 
here. To meet this demand, shops and places of 
entertainment have to be open late at night and on 
Sundays. Technology encourages this trend: the vir- 
tual economy of the Internet never sleeps. 
The widening range of types of work also 
reflects long-term demographic trends, especially 
the greater number of women workers and longer 
life expectancy. Some see non-typical jobs as a 
necessary evil, while others, especially women with 
children, welcome the change. 
The divide between traditional kinds of work 
and the new jobs is no longer watertight. People 
are increasingly switching back and forth between 
the two categories. In the course of a lifetime, a 
person may change from full-time to part-time 
work, from an office job to home office and from 
the security of a big firm to the adventure of entre- 
preneurship. 
Changes in the nature of work are also brea- 
king down the rigid frontiers which marked off the 
world of work. T he traditionally distinct fields of 
work, education and leisure are now interwoven 
and coexist flexibly in a kind of triple helix of social 
life. 
The emerging intangible and relational eco- 
nomy has a huge potential for growth because it is 
not bound by the constraints of material scarcity. 
However, the transition to the new economy is an 
open-ended process. The state has a key part to 
play in bringing it about. Governments can slow 
down the rate of change by making it more painful 
and more costly. 
Obstacles 
to change 
Pessimistic scenarios are still plausible,such as 
that of an economy which generates few new jobs 
and is polarized between a small elite and the rest of 
the population who are marginalized and live in 
precarious conditions. There is a big risk that this 
scenario will come to pass because current laws 
and regulations, as well as widespread pessimistic 
ideas about work, are powerful obstacles to change. 
Optimistic scenarios require a wholesale reform of 
institutional structures and profound changes in 
behaviour and attitudes. Such far-reaching changes 
often run into strong opposition from the social 
and political establishment and come up against 
the weight of psychological and social tradition. 
But the gamble of a new approach to work must 
be made if the transformation to the intangible eco-

### 114271: Should prostitution be legal?

Should prostitution be 
  
legal? 
Some women’s groups consider prostitutes as victims; others regard them 
as ‘sex workers’ with rights 
“Ever since the Chinese declared ‘To 
A get rich is to be glorious,” women 
without connections, brain power or 
money have been using the only asset avai- 
lable to them for quick money. Equipped 
with a room,a bed,a supply of condoms, a 
red light—and voila—instant brothel. . . . 
These girls can make much more money 
at $30 a customer, than $4 per day in the 
factories. As is (the case) in almost every 
underdeveloped country!” according to the 
International Sex and Red-Light Guide. 
Sold for $30, the guide “instructs”’men 
on where to find cheap sex around the 
world. This is a business venture,according 
to the authors, where the only principle is 
getting the most for your money. “If one so 
chooses to use her body in this manner, in 
lieu of social slavery at the hands of poverty 
employers, and men are willing to pay them

more than slave labour wages,so be it.If it 
1s not your body and not your life,it is also 
not your business. Until [someone] can 
correct the whole world’s economic condi- 
tion, as well as the overpopulation problem, 
someone has to pay the bills.” 
But who?T he poorest, the most vulne- 
rable?T here is no denying that the sex indus- 
try has taken on international dimensions, 
recognized as an economic motor for many 
countries, particularly in Asia. The irony is 
that prostitution is not entirely legal. Would 
legalization reduce some of the inequalities 
and abuse suffered by the women involved? 
Or by legitimizing prostitution, would we 
reverse decades of work to promote human 
rights and improve the status of women? 
An acrimonious debate 
On the surface this looks like a rehashing 
of atimeless debate. But it isn’t. The question 
sno longer about morality—is prostitution a 
vice and are those involved evil or somehow 
lacking in judgment? We now ask: is prosti- 
tution a form of exploitation to be abolished 
or an occupation to be regulated? 
This has proven to be one of the most 
divisive issues among women’s groups 
around the world. There are basically two 
camps—those seeking to eradicate prostitu- 
tion, like the non-governmental Coalition 
Against Trafficking in Women and prosti- 
tutes’ rights groups, primarily based in the 
Netherlands, the United States and England, 
who view the women involved as “sex wor- 
kers”. There is considerable acrimony bet- 
ween the two. For example, the Coalition 
maintains that these groups generally repre- 
sent the interests of the “pimps and procu- 
rers”. In rebuttal, the rights’ groups main- 
tain that the abolitionists are locked away in 
the ivory towers of academic feminism, cut 
off from the day-to-day realities facing pros- 
titutes. 
The dividing line between the two camps 
lies in distinctions between so-called “free”

ETHICS 
  
‘Why do men choose to buy the bodies of millions of 
women and children, call it sex, and seemingly get 
tremendous pleasure literally over their bought bodies? 
and “forced” prostitution. Abolitionists 
generally maintain that the vast majority of 
women are forced into prostitution, while the 
sex workers insist that this is not necessarily 
the case. But as both point out, for different 
reasons, these distinctions oversimplify the 
issues. The 12-year-old Nepalese girl sold to 
an Aids-infested brothel in India clearly never 
consented to this form of slavery. The drug- 
addict in NewYork who must fulfil a quota of 
clients to get a fix from her pimp is not free to 
make decisions concerning her body. But 
what of the Ukramian woman who looses her 
job and decides to go to Germany to work as 
a maid but ends up in a brothel? 
For the Coalition, “the distinctions bet- 
ween free and forced prostitution obscure 
the powerful structural socio-economic 
conditions—Ilike poverty, marginalization, 
lack of opportunities and prior sexual 
abuse—that often drive women and children 
straight into prostitution situations,” says 
Aurora Javate de Dios of the Coalition’s 
Asia-Pacific branch. “Economic crisis,natu- 
ral disasters, political unrest and conflict 
situations make women and children more 
vulnerable and easy prey to sex traffickers 
and recruiters. We see this everywhere, espe- 
cially m developing countries of the South.” 
For Javate de Dios, laws aimed at distingui- 
shing between free and forced prostitution 
will never recognize the complex dynamics 
involved. The most they can possibly do 1s to 
identify the most extreme forms of coercion, 
while ignoring the impact of poverty and 
implicitly legitimizing patriarchal relation- 
ships. 
The line between free and forced prosti- 
tution also wears thin on the opposite side of 
the spectrum, according to Lin Chew, a for- 
mer spokesperson for the Foundation 
Agamst Trafficking in Women, a non-govern- 
mental organization based in the Nether- 
lands. “When does anyone make free deci- 
sions, especially in the labour market? A man 
who works in a chemical factory, whose 
wages will never get him over the poverty 
line—did he choose this way of life? And 
what about the woman whose background 
never afforded her the chance to develop any 
skills? Why should this question of free 
choice only apply to prostitution?’ 
There 1s, however, one point on which 
the two camps agree: decriminalization.It’s

time to repeal laws used to punish prostitutes 
in seeking to protect public decency and 
order. Beyond this, the two camps diverge. 
For abolitionist groups like the Coalition, 
women are victims, but anyone who profits 
from their exploitation deserves punishment. 
For the prostitutes’ rights groups, however, 
Prostitution and the law 
According to the 1949 UN Convention 
for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons 
and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of 
Others, which has been ratified by 72 states: 
“prostitution and the accompanying evil of 
the traffic in persons . .. are incompatible 
with the dignity and worth of the human 
person....” Parties agree to punish anyone who: 
® “procures,entices or leads away, for pur- 
poses of prostitution, another person,even 
with the consent of that person”; 
¢ “exploits the prostitution of another per- 
son,even with the consent of that person”; 
¢ “keeps or manages, or knowingly finances 
or takes part in the financing of a brothel”; 
¢ “knowingly lets or rents a building... for 
the purposes of prostitution”. 
In practice, governments have develo- 
ped three basic legal fameworks concerning 
prostitution: 
¢ Prohibition .The act of accepting pay- 
ment for sex and sometimes paying for sex 
is 1llegal and punished. This is the situa- 
tion,for example,in the Gulf States and in 
most of the United States. 
3 8 The Unesco Courier - December 1998 
¢ Criminalization .The law forbids certain 
activities related to payment for sex rather 
than paid sex itself. T hese activities include 
soliciting for clients, advertising, living off the 
earnings of prostitutes, recruiting prostitutes 
or helping them to circulate from one coun- 
try to another. T his 1s the most common legal 
framework for commercial sex throughout 
Western Europe, India, Southeast Asia, 
Canada, Australia and the Pacific and most of 
Latin America. 
¢ Regulation refers to exceptions to cri- 
minal law made for those parts of the sex 
industry which comply with certain condi- 
tions. In the case of female sex workers, 
such systems are often linked to manda- 
tory health checks. 
Some examples: 
In Brazil , prostitution is not illegal but 
it 1s illegal to operate a brothel,to rent pre- 
mises to prostitutes, exploit children or live 
off the earnings of a prostitute. 
In Canada , the law does not prohibit 
the act of prostitution but criminalizes a 
wide range of related activities like solici- 
ting, living off the earnings of prostitution, 
operating premises,etc. 
In Denmark , it is not illegal to provide 
sexual services so long as prostitution is not 
the main source of income (in which case 
the charge 1s vagrancy).Recruiting is illegal. 
Greece and Turkey have both legali- 
zed prostitution. Women must register and 
attend clinics for regular examinations, in 
some cases as frequently as twice weekly. 
In India , despite the many laws against 
the sex industry and traditional caste-bound 
prostitution, prostitution and trafficking 1s still 
common. Conditions are very bad for those 
involved. 
In Senegal , it is illegal to aid, abet, pro- 
cure or live off prostitution earnings or run a 
brothel. Female prostitutes must register, 
carry cards and have regular medical exams. 
Most women take part in the informal sector. 
Enforcement 1s weak. 
In Thailand , itis illegal to be a prostitute 
or to live off a prostitute’s earnings. However, 
the laws are not consistently enforced. Hu

you cannot help sex workers by forcing their 
employers underground. But you can try to 
level the playing field—that is ensure that 
these workers are protected from occupatio- 
nal hazards and receive fair treatment. This is 
probably the latest chapter in the debate:the 
role of the state. 
Here we find two camps within the pros- 
titutes’ rights groups. One branch pushes for 
complete decriminalization,that is no regu- 
lation of the industry, while another supports 
legalization. “Legalized” prostitution refers 
to a wide range of situations. It can simply 
mean that prostitution is not against the law. 
More often the case, though, legalization is 
synonymous for regulation, with laws enfor- 
ced by police. Licenses can be issued, for 
example, with mandatory health-checks. 
Zoning laws may set up “eros centres” remo- 
ved from residential areas. If brothels are ille- 
gal, it might be an offence for two prostitutes 
to work out of the same house. Anti-pimping 
laws may oblige a prostitute’s lover to prove 
that he or she is financially independent. 
Standards can also be set for the working 
space, assuring for example, sufficient ligh- 
ting, quality mattresses, fire precautions and 
air supply. Laws can assure that a woman is 
Europe’s 
quandary 
n Western European countries such as Germany, 
prostitution islegal— but only for European Union 
residents. The restrictions are intended to combat 
trafficking in women— whereby criminal networks 
smuggle women and girls from one country or region 
to the next, exploiting them as prostitutes or domes- 
ticlabourers. Eastern and Central Europe have repor- 
tedly surpassed Asia as the prime source of this traf- 
ficking. In Germany, 80 per cent of the estimated 
10,000 trafficked women are from this European 
region,according to the International Organization 
for Migration. 
While these women may have chosen to migrate 
as prostitutes for economic reasons, few are prepared 
for the abuse frequently encountered. Not only are 
they driven further into debt,but some are deprived 
of their passports, raped, sold to clubs and pimps, 
while others face threats to their families at home if 
they don’t comply. 
The laws barring these women from legally wor- 
king as prostitutes were supposed to combat traffic- 
king. Yet according to women’s groups on both sides of 
the legalization debate, they have done more harm 
than good. They drive the women further underground 
asillegal aliens. In 1997, for example, German autho- 
rities reported finding 1,500 trafficked women— 95 
per cent of whom were deported. [| 
ETHICS 
not obligated to drink alcohol with a client. 
While appropriate tax brackets can be set up 
for earnings and rights to health insurance 
and retirement ensured. 
In theory, these regulations are intended 
to protect prostitutes. But some do just the 
opposite, according to sex worker groups like 
the US-based COYOTE, which calls for 
complete decriminalization of prostitution. 
Government-run brothels “would be the 
prostitute’s worst nightmare,” according to a 
COYOTE position paper. “I can think of 
nothing worse than having to work for a 
bureaucrat—especially in the sex industry— 
where there is already a long and well docu- 
mented history of abuse by the police. . . . 
Perhaps brothels are an ideal situation for the 
male clients—a man gets to go to a place 
where all the women are lined up waiting to 
be chosen—but it is an extremely uncom for- 
table,degrading situation for women. ...” 
As for licenses, they “do nothing to 
ensure the safety of either the customer or 
the prostitute. That is not to say that women 
shouldn’t have frequent medical checks— 
they should,” according to COYOTE, in 
reference to complaints that women are 
treated like cattle by health inspectors in 
poorly equipped facilities. “Just as a res- 
taurant will lose its reputation if the food 
isn’t fresh and its customers become ill,so 
will the free market regulate the health stan- 
dards of working women.” 
For the Coalition Against Trafficking in 
Women, the debate over the role of the state 
is simply a way of stonewalling the real issues. 
The term “sex worker” doesn’t dignify the 
woman involved, it dignifies the pimps, pro- 
curers and traffickers. “What prostituted 
women must endure in their ‘employment’is 
what in other contexts would be the accepted 
definition of sexual harassment and sexual 
abuse in the workplace,” according to Janice 
Raymond, of the Coalition. “Does the fact 
that a fee is paid transform this abuse into a 
‘job’known as ‘commercial sex work’?” 
Courses in sex work 
Raymond points to courses, available for 
a fee in the Netherlands, on how to do sex 
work,covering everything from role-playing 
sessions in bars to and information on tax 
breaks. “What young girl would you encou- 
rage to become ‘skilled’ in this trade?Why is so 
much attention paid to promoting the ‘trade’ 
and nothing done to help women get out of it? 
Because its easier to believe that prostitution 
is a choice for these women. . .. If the issue of 
choice must be raised, let it be raised in the 
context of the men who buy the sex of prosti- 
tution. Why do men choose to buy the bodies 
of millions of women and children, call it sex, 
and seemingly get tremendous pleasure lite- 
 
Getting rid 
of land-mines 
without getting 
hurt 
J Wie mines have killed or maimed 
more than 26,000 people around the world. In 
Cambodia, one out of every 200 people is an 
amputee because of them. 
A treaty banning the use, stockpiling,produc- 
tion and trade in anti-personnel mines signed by 
130 countries (40 of which have ratified it so far)’ 
will become binding international law on 1 March 
1999. The agreement also calls on the signatories 
to destroy the 100 million or so landmines scatte- 
red all over the world. The problem is how to do it 
at the lowest risk to human lives. 
A Spanish firm, GTD, is currently leading a consor- 
tium of European enterprises and institutes invol- 
ved in a $25 million project to develop an Advanced 
Global System to Himinate Anti-personnel Land- 
mines (ANGEL), partly funded by the European 
Eureka programme to promote collaboration in 
research and development. “We're not offering a 
magic solution,” says the GTD project manager. 
“There aren’t any in thisfield. But the point about our 
system is that it brings together several different 
technologies” including robotics, satellite observa- 
tion and the latest electro-magnetic detection sys- 
tems. 
The method GTD is developing relies on geo- 
graphic data provided by satellites and an unman- 
ned vertical take-off and landing aerial vehicle 
equipped with special sensors to identify mine- 
free fields and areas where there may be land- 
mines. 
The next step is carried out on the ground by a 
light,manoeuvrable unmanned all-terrain vehicle 
which can enter minefields in order to locate and 
identify each single explosive device. Another 
vehicle, in this case driven by a mine disposal spe- 
cialist, is then sent to deneutralize the mine from 
the safety of the vehicle some 50 or 100 metres 
away. Previous methods involved a high degree of 
risk for mine disposal officers, who had to work 
very close to the mines they were neutralizing. 
The ANGEL system will not be completely ope- 
rational until the year 2004. The first testing of it 
has been done in Bosnia and Herzegovina, at 
Tuzla, whose university is among the 15 institu- 
tions associated with the project,along with lea- 
ding European aerospace firms including Matra 
(France) and Germany (Dornier),and the Massa- 
chusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), in the Uni- 
ted States. [|

All hands on stage! 
The media explosion left traditional Indian puppetry without a leg 
to stand on, but now a revival may be on the way 
Chalapathi Rao learnt how to handle 
| puppets even before he learnt his 
alphabet. In the last five decades, he 
and his troupe have staged innumerable 
puppet shows in India and other parts of 
the world including twenty-three perfor- 
mances in Germany and two in New York. 
Today, the fifty-eight-year-old artist from 
the southern Indian state of Andhra Pra- 
desh makes ends meet not by his artistry 
but by selling lampshades and small han- 
dicrafts. “We used to give as many as fif- 
teen performances a month during my 
father’s time,” he recalls. “Now we only per- 
form for four months a year and go no fur- 
ther than our neighbouring villages. For the 
rest of the time we survive by selling han- 
dicrafts.” Rao is one of the thousands of 
once popular traditional puppeteers in the 
Indian sub-continent who have been swept 
away by the mass media explosion. 
A popular art form with a long tradi- 
tion in India,puppetry seems to have been 
first mentioned in the ancient Tamil epic 
Silappadikaram (second century BC). It has 
been and still is an effective tool for com- 
municating religious, political and social 
messages. Puppeteers, who always moved 
around from place to place, mostly used 
ancient Indian epics like the Ramayana and 
the Mahabharatha as their themes, and 
their shows were a regular feature of reli- 
gious and local festivals, wedding celebra- 
tions and social gatherings. Style and pre- 
sentation differed from region to region. 
Puppetry enjoyed royal patronage, and as 
its popularity spread across oceans many 
Southeast Asian nations adapted the art 
form to their own cultures and traditions 
(see box page 42). 
Known as Thollu bommalata (D ance of 
leather puppets) or Bommalattam (Dance 
of dolls) in south India and Katputhli (string 
puppet) in northern India, puppets enthral- 
led audiences the moment they came alive

to the accompaniment of song and music. 
Now, as in the past, the puppeteer narrates 
a story, manipulates the figures, gives each 
character an appropriate voice, and care- 
fully choreographs sound effects and move- 
ment. A successful puppeteer needs to have 
a thorough grasp of poetry, history, philo- 
sophy, religion and music. Puppeteers also 
sing to the accompaniment of musical ins- 
truments, speak several languages, and 
bless the event and the surrounding area 
by quoting from religious scriptures. Once 
upon a time, performances began after sun- 
set and lasted for hours, sometimes all night 
long. 
The strength of puppetry is in its inter- 
active quality. It is a live medium with a 
personalized approach. Puppeteers some- 
times invent their own stories,improvising 
from the basic plot a complex network of 
intrigues, romances, wars, magic and 
comedy. The use of local dialects and sto- 
ries makes for an immediate and direct rap-

port with the audience, with whom puppe- 
teers often converse through their charac- 
ters. 
Payment in kind 
Today puppetry occupies a far less signi- 
ficant place on the Indian cultural scene than 
it did in its glorious past. No institutions or 
university courses are dedicated to puppetry, 
and puppeteers learn their art either through 
family tradition or simply because they 
become interested in it. Industrialization, 
urbanization and the advent of modern mass 
media, especially films and television, have 
inevitably put a damper on traditional and 
folk forms of art worldwide and Indian pup- 
petry has been no exception. Feature films 
and modern dance performances have repla- 
ced puppet shows in the village festivals. The 
phenomenal growth of satellite television in 
the last two decades has kept children and 
adults alike glued to the screen. (Official 
reports in 1995 estimated that there were 
about forty million television sets in India, 
and that the figure was growing at the rate of 
10 per cent annually). 
According to D adi Pudumjee, president 
of the Indian branch of the Union Interna- 
tionale de la Marionette (UNIM A), an inter- 
national non-governmental organization, 
puppeteers in the past were rewarded by vil- 
lagers in cash or kind (e.g. rice, vegetables 
and clothes), in addition to their fee. “Those 
customs have disappeared now and puppe- 
teers could not survive on their earnings alone 
(between $5 and $20 for a performance). The 
arrival of the modern media also brought a 
need to improve the production quality and 
content of these puppet shows. Unable to 
change with the times, many traditional pup- 
peteers vanished from the scene.” 
Despite the onslaught from the mass 
media, some forms of traditional puppetry,

malakunta puppet group in the Ananthpur 
district of Andhra Pradesh state, is one of the 
rare survivors. He has adapted modern 
themes and techniques to this ancient art 
form. “In 1980, when we were about to give 
up the profession, the state government gave 
us some financial assistance and advised us to 
incorporate new themes,” Rao recalls. “They 
also commissioned us to introduce social

awareness themes like family planning and 
literacy instead of dramatizing traditional reli- 
gious subjects.” Unlike Rao, those who did 
not change their repertoire and move with 
the times were forced to abandon their voca- 
tion and take to other means of livelihood 
like farming, toy making and handicrafts. 
A survey of traditional forms of puppet 
theatre conducted by the Bharathiya Natya 
Sangh (Indian Dance Association) in 1977 
showed that thousands of traditional pup- 
peteers were languishing in remote areas of 
the country due to lack of support and that 
the art form was facing extinction. Acade-

mics joined artists in promoting puppet 
theatre as a means of self-expression and as 
a vehicle of instruction.Experts from various 
disciplines joined in an effort to make pup- 
pet shows a multi-dimensional experience. 
Over the past few years the New Delhi- 
based Sangeet Natak Academy (SN A; Music 
and Dance Association) of India, has orga- 
nized festivals and conferences in various 
parts of the country as part of an endeavour 
to improve the techniques and forms of tra- 
ditional puppetry. At these events, the inter- 
action and exchange of ideas between tradi- 
tional and non-traditional puppeteers for the 
development of the art resulted in assimila- 
tion of styles and emergence of new trends. 
Artists came up with fresh ideas. Shadow 
puppetry incorporated masks, mime and 
classical dance forms. Some puppet artists 
introduced martial arts and new lighting 
techniques into shadow puppet shows. 
Others went ahead with the idea of musical 
puppet shows without any dialogue. “I prefer 
to stage total theatre by using actors,masks, 
movement and objects as a means to tell a 
story,” says Dadi Pudumjee, who also runs 
IsharaTheatre in New Delhi. Laying special 
emphasis on movement, D adi has developed 
colourful and vibrant puppets which com- 
bine the grace of traditional marionettes with 
the vitality of contemporary puppets.

rying out interesting experiments with

Local languages 
blossom 
In Europe 
A milestone has been reached in the reco- 
gnition of Europe’s local cultures and lan- 
guages. Germany, which officially acknowledges 
the existence of six minority languages within its 
borders (including Danish, Sorbian and North Fri- 
sian), ratified in September 1998 the European 
Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, and 
France has announced it will follow suit. 
The charter, adopted in 1992 by the Council of 
Europe’, aims to protect and promote regional 
European languages as aspects of a shared cul- 
tural heritage. There are about forty such lan- 
guages and the charter has so far been signed by 
eighteen countries and ratified by eight? 
France’s decision has delighted more than four 
million of its citizens who speak Breton,Basque, 
Catalan,Occitan,Dutch,Alsatian,Corsican,Creole 
(in the overseas provinces), Tahitian and Kanak 
(in the Pacific territories). France has been extre- 
mely centralized since the Jacobins imposed their 
ideas during the Revolution and isalmost the last 
bastion in Europe of official and exclusive mono- 
lingualism. 
Article two of the French Constitution states that 
“the language of the country is French.” The dialect 
of the Paris region was imposed on the rest of 
France many years ago to the detriment of the other 
languages. 
“The war is over,” the French daily newspaper 
Libération announced happily.“ The signing of the 
European charter eases outdated antagonisms” 
Will it be possible to be tried ina French court in a 
regional language or ask for official documents to 
be written in one’s local tongue? This is unlikely. 
European countries which ratify the charter can 
choose not to apply about half the hundred or so 
of its provisions The French government has not 
yet said what it will do. So far, only Finland has 
announced it will apply the charter in its entirety. 
Another country which has dragged its feet is 
the United Kingdom, which could now follow 
France and Germany and give special status to

Low-cost puppets made as part of a social welfare programme. 
basic styles and techniques are visible in 
the work of these contemporary artists who 
have dared to break age-old barriers of reli- 
gion and language. Eminent Indian art cri- 
tic J.N. Kaushal says that “those who kept 
their windows open to new ideas and expe- 
riments have made great strides and those 
who were unwilling to change have shown 
signs of decay.” 
Pulling strings 
to improve health 
Some non-traditional puppeteers have used 
puppetry as an effective communicative tool 
as well as an art form. For example the Uni- 
ted Nations Development Programme’s 
South Asia Poverty Alleviation Project spon- 
sored puppetry training programmes for 
community workers in Andhra Pradesh in 
1997. As part of the project two one-week 
training programmes in the use of puppetry 
were conducted at the Nori Art and Puppe- 
try Centre in Hyderabad, the state capital. 
The programme helped around fifty com- 
munity workers from southern India to learn 
the art and use it to popularize social mes- 
sages like women’s empowerment, health and 
family planning. After their training, these 
community workers went back to their vil- 
lages and made hand and rod puppets to per- 
form new stories and songs adapted to them. 
Puppetry is being used as part of similar pro- 
jects sponsored by a number of agencies in 
other parts of India in order to create aware- 
ness of issues like Aids and alcohol abuse. 
Though puppetry shows are not 
making a sensational come-back, they are 
again being enthusiastically welcomed both 
in rural and urban areas. There have been 
suggestions that puppetry should be intro- 
duced as a subject in schools in India, but 
this has yet to materialize. Once considered 
a “dying art”, Indian puppetry has started 
a slow revival but still has far to go before 
regaining its former glory. [|

Gloves, strings and shadows 
There are four kinds of puppets in 
India—glove or hand puppets, rod pup- 
pets, string puppets and shadow puppets. 
Hand or glove puppets, as their name sug- 
gests, are worn on the hand and manipulated 
by the artist’s fingers. Rod puppets are 
controlled with rods manipulated by the 
puppeteer, who is hidden from the audience 
by a screen. String puppets give more flexi- 
bility to the artists as the dolls are attached to 
a string above and a screen divides the pup- 
peteer from the puppets. The traditional sha- 
dow puppets of south India are intricate flat 
figures made from goat or buffalo hide by 
skilled craftsmen. They are projected onto a 
translucent screen by means of a strong 
source of light from behind. The audience 
sits on the other side of the screen and does 
4 2 The Unesco Courier - December 1998 
not see the puppets but their moving sha- 
dows on the screen. 
Patronized by kings and lords, puppetry 
travelled beyond India as early as the sixth 
century AD. The ancient Indonesian art of 
shadow puppetry known as wayang kulitis a 
unique combination of ritual, teaching and 
entertainment using figures which are styli- 
zed representations of the original leather 
puppets from India. Most Indonesian sha- 
dow plays are based on the two epic stories 
from India, the Ramayana and the M ahab- 
harata. T he Balinese and Javanese have com- 
bined the Hindu stories with Buddhist and 
Muslim ideas and their own folklore. Even 
Thailand’s nang yai shadow play has its own 
version of the Ramayana. [| 
  
China's 
love affair with 
football 
ntil a few years ago, a first division football 
Uc in China would draw no more than 
thirty-odd spectators and the total take at the 
gate would be around six dollars. But things have 
changed drastically since the founding in 1994 
of a professional football league, which now has 
twelve teams, including forty-eight foreign 
players. 
The stadiums are filling up week by week and 
television stations give live coverage of national 
games, along with the highlights of Italian, Spa- 
nish, English and German championship matches. 
China’s best player last year was a Paraguayan, 
Jorge Luis Campos, who played in his country’s 
World Cup team.And,even more extraordinary, 
China has begun selling players to European 
clubs. 
As in Japan,whose team played in the World 
Cup in France for the first time in 1998,China’s 
recent love affair with football “ is closely connec- 
ted with the country’s opening up to the outside 
world,” says Yong Qun Li, the Paris correspondent 
of the “ Chinese Young People’s Newspaper”. 
Money has something to do with it. The best- 
known clubs have budgets of up to $5 million 
and the championship, which is sponsored by 
many companies, is revealingly called the Marl- 
boro League. The transnational cigarette company 
Philip Morris has managed to muscle in on a 
strictly-regulated market which,with 350 million 
smokers is one of the biggest in the world. 
But China’s national team needs many more 
hours of training before it can say it has really 
arrived. This could happen during the first World 
Cup to be held in Asia,which will be jointly hos- 
ted by South Korea and Japan in 2002. 
As Casiano del Valle, the Paraguayan forward 
for the capital's Beijing Gouan team,says, “ there 
are some very good players in this country, physi- 
cally and skills-wise. But they need to improve 
their tactics” 
After fast food, portable phones and Coca 
Cola, China seems to be discovering, through 
sport,new aspects of life in the West. [|

### 114273: Anatomy of the cybernaut

Anatomy of 
the cybernaut 
More and more people are using the Internet. 
Who are they? Where do they live? What do they want from cyberspace? 
most closely observed specimens of 
humanity. Consultants and marketing 
experts scrutinize them, monitor their 
desires and anticipate their reactions, for 
they know the future of the information 
economy is in their hands. Data about them 
is everywhere. 
But the character of the Internet (or 
Net) user is changing all the time. In the 
virtual world’s Stone Age, in the 1970s, the 
Net was the preserve of a tiny, very uniform 
group of specialized researchers. Gradually 
it spread to a rather wider group of univer- 
sity people and computer experts. 
During the “Bronze Age”, which ended 
with the invention of the World Wide Web' 
in 1992, the typical “netizen” was easy to 
Internet users are among the world’s describe. He was a highly educated, com- 
fortably-off, English-speaking white male 
around thirty years old,living in a town or 
city. This is still pretty much true today. 
Netizens are still mostly young Anglo- 
Saxon adults with some kind of higher edu- 
cation earning about $50,000 a year. 
“This image is out of date,” however, 
says Frenchman Christian Huitéma, who 
works for the US telecommunications firm 
Bellcore. “As time passes, the typical Inter- 
net user is becoming more and more like 
the average citizen. This trend is bound to 
continue.” 
Several recent developments confirm 
his analysis. First there has been a tremen- 
dous influx of women into cyberspace.At 
the beginning of 1994, only five per cent of 
Internet users were women. Today the 
figure is 38 per cent, according to surveys. 
Their initial absence is easily explained. 
“The Internet first developed among engi- 
neers and technicians, few of whom are 
women,” says Huitéma. Christine Maxwell, 
of the Internet Society, says that “because 
of the kind of work most women do, they 
have less opportunity to connect to the Net 
from their workplace.But they are logging 
on more and more from home as computer 
prices drop.” 
This year, according to several sources, 
more women than men have become Net 
users for the first time. Some 52 per cent of 
people who have been connected for less 
than a year are women. But the situation 
varies greatly around the world.In Europe »

‘In Saudi Arabia, which has barely begun to connect up to 
the Net, women are not allowed to drive motor vehicles. 
But they’re driving along the information highway, and 
that will change a lot of things’ 
and South Africa, a quarter of all Net users 
are women, compared with 25 per cent in 
Brazil and New Zealand and 40 per cent 
in the United States. In the Middle East, 
the figure is only four per cent. The virtual 
world closely mirrors the real one where 
equality between the sexes is concerned. 
But Maxwell thinks things will change: 
“In Saudi Arabia, which has barely begun 
to connect up to the Net, women are not 
allowed to drive motor vehicles. But theyre 
driving along the information highway, and 
that will change a lot of things.” 
The Internet is also increasingly popu- 
lar with young people. Student Monitor 
magazine, which does a survey each year 
of American students’ favourite pastimes, 
says nearly three-quarters of those asked 
said Net-surfing was the coolest thing to 
do. Up until now, their favourite activity 
has always been beer drinking. In the coun- 
tries of the South, new Net users are youn- 
ger than elsewhere. In the Middle East and 
Asia, the average user is under thirty. 
Americans a minority 
among Net users 
The trend towards younger users goes 
along with a slight fall in the level of edu- 
cation, especially in the United States. 
There are fewer Master’s degrees and 
Ph.Dsamong Net newcomers than among 
the “experts”—those who have been on line 
for more than four years. The newcomers 
also cover a broader range of activities: 
fewer than one in ten works in computers, 
compared with one in three in 1994. They 
are also a bit less well off: only 30 per cent 
earn more than $50,000 a year, as against 
50 per cent four years ago. 
These socio-economic shifts are cou- 
pled with changes in the geography of the 
Internet. The US research firm Emarketer 
says 1998 was a landmark in the history of 
cyberspace. For the first time, Americans 
became a minority among Net users. In 
1995,two-thirds of all Net users were Ame- 
rican. 
But Europe still lags behind and the 
continent is not geared to catch up, says 
Forrester Research, a firm which predicts 
that in 2001, only 13 per cent of Europeans 
will be connected to the Net compared 
with 40 per cent in the United States. It 
attributes this big gap to the cost of tele- 
4 4 The Unesco Courier - December 1998 
communications, which are five times 
higher in Europe. 
The major countries of the South, howe- 
ver, seem to be advancing at top speed. The 
communications group Saatchi and Saatchi 
Worldwide reports that the Internet is gro- 
wing twice as fast in Latin America than 
anywhere else: it grew by 788 per cent there 
between 1995 and 1997, while globally the 
Net is only doubling in size each year. At the 
end of October, the US market research firm 
IDC admitted it was “surprised” at the 
expansion of the Internet in China, which 
by 2001 is expected to be second only to 
Japan in number of people connected. 
New languages 
on the Web 
The entry of people from the South into 
cyberspace has introduced new languages 
to the Web, and this is an atttraction for 
non-English-speakers. All studies show that 
people prefer connecting to sites in their 
own language, even if they know English 
well. At the start of the 1990s, English 
dominated almost all the Web. Now it only 
accounts for three-quarters of it, according 
to a study by the Agence de la Francopho- 
nie,which monitors use of the French lan- 
guage.

invention of an international system of 
coding characters, which has made it pos- 
sible to use non-Latin alphabets. T he other 
is the growth of translation programmes

id you know that from two to eight per cent of the earth’s living species will disappear over the next 
D twenty-five years? Or that all ten of the warmest yearson record have occurred in the last fifteen years? 
And that nearly 130 million hectares of land— the equivalent of the combined area of France, Italy and 
Spain— can no longer be used for food production,due to degradation? 
These alarming facts are brought to our attention by the three on-going United Nations conventions on 
biological diversity, climate change and desertification. Adopted at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio, they each 
have their own respective secretariats and their own specific objectives and commitments but share a 
common concern for many environmental and sustainable development issues. While each instrument 
standson its own, the secretariats of all three aim to achieve greater progress through a collaborative, inter- 
linked effort. For example, combating desertification reduces net carbon dioxide emissions, land degrada- 
tion and the loss of biodiversity. 
This vast panorama is now covered in a joint three-in-one website, with a comprehensive NGO Trialogue 
which serves as a focal point for comparing, co-ordinating and consolidating NGO activitiesand information 
related to the three conventions. Each of the three conventions provides related links to individual NGOs and 
other sites within the United Nations system. [|

### 114273: Anatomy of the cybernaut

Another change under way is the trans- 
formation of the Net user into a cyber- 
consumer. Until now, he or she has been 
mainly interested in finding information 
and contacting other people—witness the 
huge success of discussion forums and chat 
groups. Now, people are starting to use the 
Net to go shopping. In the United States, 
more than a third of users have already 
bought something on the Net, according 
to Nielsen Media Research. A quarter of 
all Americans who want to buy a car have a 
look at manufacturers’ sites and those of 
consumer groups. 
Net-shopping is getting to be a habit in 
other countries too. Surveys in France, 
New Zealand and South Africa show that 
between 60 and 80 per cent of Net users are 
interested in it, even if only a few have 
actually bought anything yet.T heir hesita- 
tion comes from doubt about the security 
of payment methods, unwillingness to fill in 
purchasing forms for fear of where the 
information might end up, and reluctance 
to have anything to do with goods they can- 
not actually touch. 
The domain 
of the wealthy 
The “netizen”is becoming an unexceptio- 
nal figure as the Internet reaches more and 
more people. But the trend towards uni- 
versal Net access also increases certain 
inequalities, even in the United States, 
where computers cost less and it is cheap to 
log on. The US Commerce Department 
reported in August that despite the growing 
number of people who own a computer and 
have Internet access, low-income rural 
people, single-parent families and those 
with less than eight years of schooling have 
little opportunity to connect to it. The 
CONNEXIONS 
report also said the ethnic gap was wide- 
ning too: 40.8 per cent of white households 
have access to the Net, compared with only 
19.3 per cent of Afro-Americans and 19.4 
per cent of Hispanics. 
On a world scale, Africa is being sideli- 
ned. Its share of Net users (outside of South 
Africa) fell from 0.025 per cent in 1997 to 
0.022 per cent in 1998, according to the 
World Bank. The typical African Net user is 
either a South African or a highly-educated 
rich man. Tom Butterly, head of the Zim - 
babwe firm Information Management 
Consultants, reckons that 700,000 of Afri- 
ca’s barely one million Net users live in 
South Africa.The connection cost of about 
$65 a month—half a teacher’s salary—is 
still a disincentive. In the rich countries it 
costs only about $20. 
But Huitéma does not think the Inter- 
net will be the domain of the wealthy for 
much longer. “The Net is eventually going 
to spread like television did. I remember 
when television arrived in the small village 
in Brittany (western France) where I grew 
up. It was a luxury. These days, you find 
television sets everywhere,even in shanty- 
towns.” [|

Counting the netizen population 
How many Internet users are there 
A worldwide? It’s hard to say. Estimates 
range from 100 to 200 million. It depends on 
how you define them. “What do we mean 
when we talk about Net users?” asks Chris- 
tian Huitéma. “People who have an account 
with an ISP (an Internet service provider)? 
People who share an account with the rest of 
their family? People who log on through 
their university or workplace? People who 
visit a cybercafé now and again?’ 
Net users are counted in different ways. 
The traditional one is by totting up the 
number of electronic addresses registered 
(now about forty million). This figure is 
then multiplied by a rough estimate of how 
many people use each machine (between 
three and five). 
Polling firms use another method. They 
take a representative sample of the popula- 
tion and ask each person if they have logged 
on that day, or during the past week or the 
past month. “These polls are often localized 
and take place over time,” says Huitéma. 
“The world total is arrived at by adding up 
the figures from Canada in June,from the 
United States in September, from Japan in 
January, along with guesses for other coun- 
tries. It’s not surprising that the global esti- 
mates vary so widely.” [| 
 
Sar wars 
lectromagnetic pollution is clouding our view 
E: the heavens. Radio waves from a new net- 
work of communication satellites may be drow - 
ning out emissions from dying stars which take 
aeons to reach us 
Alarm bells rang in November 1998 when the 
American company Iridium began relaying tele- 
phone calls with its flotilla of 66 satellites 
International calls have long been relayed by 
satellites about 35,000 kilometres overhead, 
which is why only telephones connected to 
powerful transmitters can use them. However, Iri- 
dium satellites fly just 800 kilometres overhead 
enabling customers from Antarctica to 
Timbuktu to keep in touch through special devices 
about the size of a standard portable telephone. 
But for astronomers, “ the transmitters on the 
satellites produce unwanted emissions in the 
radio astronomy bands used to observe dying and 
newly formed stars” and other phenomena, 
according to Tom Kuiper, a radio astronomer with 
NASA. Kuiper explains that during peak calling 
hours, the satellite interference surpasses levels 
which the International Telecommunication Union 
hasdefined as harmful to radio astronomy. To clo- 
sely monitor an approaching comet, for example, 
scientists would have to negotiate with Iridium 
for a shut-down of the system to continue cer- 
tain key observations during peak telephone 
hours. 
“Once we understand the magnitude of the pro- 
blem, we will see how we can improve our satellites 
between now and the year2006,” says Jack Wen- 
gryniuk of Iridium’s licensing affairs division. But 
he also points out that Iridium satellites are just 
one part of the problem. Commercial users and 
uses of the electromagnetic environment will conti- 
nueto rise asthe telecommunications industry sky- 
rockets. 
“The radio spectrum may possibly be one of 
the most precious resources we have,” he says, 
which is why several nations are preparing pro - 
posals to set up reserves to protect our electro- 
magnetic environment. [|

### 114274: Gloria Cuartas: Colombia's messenger of peace

Gloria Cuartas, 
Why did Apartadé become an extremely 
violent city in the early 1990s? 
The first thing to bear in mind is the 
context of the conflict. A civil war has been 
going on in Colombia for the past fifty years. 
For a variety of historical and economic rea- 
sons, the Urubd region in which Apartad? is 
located is extremely vulnerable. The arrival of 
guerrilla and paramilitary groups triggered a 
process of extortion and killings, and the 
region soon became ungovernable (see box). 
A very significant development came in 1991 
when, as a result of negotiations on political 
rather than social issues, the guerrillas of the 
Popular Liberation Army (EPL) laid down 
their arms—as the M-19 movement had done 
previously. This meant that there was no 
social amnesty, either on the part of the lan- 
downers, the community or political groups. 
How did you come to be mayor of 
Apartad6? 
Violence reached a critical level in 1994, 
when the guerrillas decreed that nobody 
could stand as a candidate in the municipal 
elections. Only two days before election day, 
scheduled for 24 August 1994, the Catholic 
church brought together political organiza- 
tions and urged them to take part in the 
democratic process and not to give way to 
the threat of arms. Discussions began to 
decide who should stand. A long list of names 
46 The Unesco Courier - December 1998 
was drawn up, but people were afraid. My 
name was put forward without any warning. 
There were a number of points in my favour: 
I knew the region and its people, I was not a 
member of any traditional political party, I 
was not an activist in any armed group, and 
my approach to work was more technical 
than political or partisan. The fourteen poli- 
tical groups involved reached agreement and 
I became the sole consensus candidate. 
You were 34 at the time. Why did the 14 
political leaders choose a woman—and a 
woman so young— to occupy such an 
exposed position in such a violent city? 
I don’t think I was nominated because 
they thought that a woman could do some- 
thing more to solve the conflict; it was more 
a question of their evading their political res- 
ponsibility. In Latin America, a woman in 
power is still regarded as inoffensive. She is 
not expected to bring about fundamental 
changes. A woman in a position of respon- 
sibility is a figurehead rather than a political 
decision-maker. My election was therefore 
more the outcome of a special situation 
than a planned gesture.When I started to 
take a stand on certain issues, within a 
month those 14 men left me stranded. 
What sort of issues? 
I had said that if I accepted the post of 
The former mayor of the 
Colombian city of 
Apartadd, who has faced 
many threats to her life, 
appeals to social 
movements and the 
international community 
for support in 
overcoming violence and 
conflict 
mayor I would do so without weapons or an 
escort and that I would talk with all the 
armed groups, whether they were guer- 
rillas,paramilitaries, the army or the police. 
This sparked off a reaction nationwide 
because mayors were not supposed to talk 
with armed groups. I started out from the 
principle that you do not choose the people 
you govern, you have to accept them for 
what they are, even if they include people 
who live beyond the frontiers of society. 
There is no such thing as an ideal commu- 
nity;every community has its conflicts. 
As mayor, you took the lead in the ‘women 
against violence’ movement.Did you 
decide to surround yourself with women or 
didn’t you find any men prepared to take 
on the responsibility? 
I didn’t recruit women: they were already 
there, but they could not express themselves 
because of the conflict. It is not enough for 
women to occupy key posts. Everything 
depends on our attitude to the roles society 
entrusts to us. In Urub4, the women used 
to be silent. In those three years, we began to 
mobilize and recover our dignity, our voices 
and our love for our land. But there was so 
much death and violence that it was diffi- 
cult for us to work out a political agenda. 
What we could do was get together and, in 
the face of a war devised by men for control

Colombia's 
messenger of peace 
of the country and the economy, make 
alliances to halt the killing of our menfolk. 
And when I say “our menfolk”, I mean not 
only workers,peasants,soldiers and police, 
but also men in the armed groups operating 
outside the law, who are also sons, husbands, 
lovers, men of the people. 
During your term of office, 1,200 people 
were assassinated and your life was 
continually in danger. Were you ever 
tempted to give up? 
When they killed 17 of my colleagues, 
when they slit the throat of a child in school 
before my eyes, when I could feel death stal- 
king the streets at night and I received threats 
by telephone, when I realized that everybody 
was a prisoner of fear, I did ask myself whe- 
ther it was worth risking my life every day. 
There were two possibilities: either I could 
run away and let all the people be engulfed in 
terror, or else I could tell them: “The only 
way out is for us to unite.” When someone 
telephoned me and said “We are going to 
kill you at nine o’clock tonight,” I replied: 
“That still leaves me seven hours.” T his was 
not heroism. I preferred to live with my fear 
rather than burden the people with it and 
let them go on enduring the violence of guns 
with sadness and resignation. 
I believe in God. I also believe that we 
must have sufficient strength to commit 
ourselves. Such a commitment cannot be 
made in words alone; we have to bear wit- 
ness through our lives. T he fact that I stayed 
in Apartad6 was not the act of a messiah 
promising deliverance but an act of convic- 
tion,so that my words matched my deeds. 
What was your biggest disappointment 
during your term of office? 
In those three years, we sounded the 
alarm. We used to say that if there was no 
political reaction from the government and 
if we did not obtain the support of the 
international community, the things that 
were happening in Urabd’s 600 square kilo- 
metres would spread to the whole of 
Colombia. But denouncing the situation 
was not enough. 
My main disappointment is that we did 
not give more substance to our task, to all 
the projects we started, especially in edu- 
cation.Nor did we succeed in making eco- 
nomic proposals for the region and in get- 
ting the international community more 
involved in local activities with children, 
women and artists. 
What is the situation in Apartado like today? 
The Urubad region is no longer a guer- 
rilla stronghold but the paramilitaries are 
present in considerable force. As long as an 
illegal force controls public order,consoli- 
dating the democratic process is a distant 
prospect. The state must regain its legiti- 
macy. Make no mistake: if this does not 
come about,Uraba will collapse. 
Are the government and the guerrilla 
groups sincere in the current peace 
negotiations? 
We are living in a situation of mutual sus- 
picion. The guerrilla groups mistrust the 
government, the government mistrusts the 
guerrillas, and civil society mistrusts both of 
them. 
The defence of the territory is at stake. 
Paramilitary groups have managed to gain a 
wide measure of control over a vast region, 
while the guerrillas claim to be defending the 
positions they now occupy, with more than 
600 towns in their hands. Hence, we are no 
longer witnessing guerrilla warfare but a tac- 
tical struggle for position. In this sense, the 
negotiations will involve a new pattern of land 
distribution and a far-reaching change in the 
country’s economic policies. 
What can be expected of these 
negotiations? 
Neither the Revolutionary Armed Forces 
of Colombia (FARC) nor the National Libe- 
ration Army (ELN) are talking of disbanding 
or handing over their weapons. Recent events 
have shown the fragile nature of the peace 
process. In October, 70 people, most of them 
children, were killed in an ELN attack on an 
oil pipeline running from Segovia to Antio- 
quia. A few days later the paramilitaries ripos- 
  
ted by marching into two villages that were 
supposedly harbouring guerrillas,murdering 
30 people and abducting 40 others. These 
were offences against humanity and viola- 
tions of international humanitarian law. The 
armed groups are making it clear to us that 
the negotiations in Colombia will take place 
in a climate of confrontation. 
If the international community does not 
monitor this process in one way or another, 
the Colombian conflict will get worse. 
Peace does not depend on President Pas- 
trana or on the good will of isolated groups. 
What impact has drug-trafficking had on 
the situation?

TALKING TO... 
  
The fact is that politicians are not magicians who can 
change things overnight. They need social movements to 
back them up 
ployment, poverty and social imbalances, 
drug-trafficking is a very important factor, 
since it has penetrated to the very roots of 
political life and of the guerrilla and para- 
military groups. Many peasants live in an 
economy based on coca production. find 
it very difficult to envisage any other local 
crop replacing this activity and being com- 
petitive. The FARC, for example, claim 
they could help to reduce illegal cultiva- 
tion, but this is not possible in the imme- 
diate future because powerful economic 
groups have created a whole market sys- 
tem out of the drug. The United States has 
proposed to the Colombian government 
that a “peace fund” should be set up 
through the Inter-American Development 
Bank (IDB), and one of the key items on its 
agenda is the eradication of illicit crops. 
This is a long-term problem, however. 
Any drastic measures could lead to further 
conflicts. 
Attempts to broker peace are not new to 
Colombia. . . 
That's true, but they have been disjointed 
and scattered. T hey need to be welded toge- 
ther in a common project, so that the voice of 
civil society can be heard in a negotiated 
social and political outcome to the conflict. 
We have to create a sense of awareness. T his 
is the only way to change our attitude to poli- 
tics in Latin America. [ put my trust not in 
politics but in social movements that will pro- 
vide education and will give rise to critical 
thinking. T he fact is that politicians are not 
magicians who can change things overnight. 
They need social movements to back them 
up. In Colombia we are scarcely beginning 
and the current peace process may last five or 
ten years. Our president is over-optimistic if 
he thinks that everything is going to be sett- 
led during his term of office. 
When you speak of the support of the 
international community, what do you 
mean in practical terms? 
There are several battle fronts in inter- 
national solidarity. T here is individual soli- 
darity, in which people contribute their 
knowledge to back up the anonymous 
struggle of men and women in different 
parts of the world, without robbing the 
people of their voice. 
There is also the presence of the inter- 
national community through the United 
Nations, whether it is represented by UNI- 
CEF, UNEsco or UNDP, organizations whose 
work is of fundamental importance. I saw 
this in Apartad6 with UNESCO’s support 
through its Regional Adviser for Latin Ame- 
rica. Moreover, the mere fact that the 
ambassadors of the European Union accre- 
dited in Bogotd visit Apartadé or any other 
region of Colombia opens up a “corridor of 
peace” in which people can describe their 
experiences and ask for co-operation, even 
though the conflict has not come to a halt. In 
short, there are many ways, ranging from 
individual endeavours to large-scale move- 
ments of solidarity, to let a region know that 
it does not stand alone. For a region going 
through a crisis, solitude is sometimes worse 
than having to contend with armed force. 
What is your opinion of the more individual 
form of solidarity provided by volunteers? 
To my mind, it is all-important. It is the 
best way of breaking away from the double 
moral standard whereby many of those who 
attend diplomatic conferences and gathe- 
rings moan about the “terrible things hap- 
pening in that country”, but very few 
actually go and see what is happening. 
Behind every volunteer,there are a host of 
NGOs, like the Colombia Support Net- 
work (CSN) which grew up in the United 
States and has given us invaluable backing. 
Hardly a year and a half after you began 
The right to risk 
“Apartadd’s La Pasionaria”, “Urabd’s 
Mother Courage”, “the mayor of 
peace” —these were some of the headlines 
that were used in the Colombian and inter- 
national press to salute Gloria Cuartas Mon- 
toya when she ended her three-year term as 
mayor of Apartad6.Cuartas presents herself 
simply as a social worker. Her involvement in 
community work began when she was a pupil 
at a Carmelite school in Antioquia province 
and continued at university, where she stu- 
died sociology. She says she has always been 
“driven by the need to know what lies behind 
the blood and death and to understand the 
social and human reasons for the civil war.” 
Supported by an unshakable faith in 
God and a belief in humanity, Gloria Cuar- 
tas succeeded in making one of the world’s 
most violent cities known as an example of 
civil mobilization for peace.As mayor she 
may have disappointed those who expec- 
ted her to inaugurate public gardens and 
highways, but as she says,“the roads to be 
48 The Unesco Courier - December 1998 
built in Apartad6 were roads of solidarity, 
and the gardens to be planted were those of 
tolerance.” In a region where an untimely 
word can be paid for with a bullet she tal- 
ked to all the armed groups and claimed 
the “right to risk”. She put her life in the 
balance by refusing special protection, in 
order to show “that weapons could not go 
on being a symbol of power or authority”. 
Convinced that politics is only valid if it 
has a “social mission”, she encouraged 
Colombian university teachers, professio- 
nals and artists to develop educational and 
cultural activities so that Apartadé’s chil- 
dren could grow up in a climate of tole- 
rance and their parents could learn to live 
together peacefully. In a city of recent 
immigrants,she tried to develop a sense of 
collective identity and civic responsibility. 
Gloria Cuartas also made her voice 
heard outside her country and won interna- 
tional support for her policies. She told the 
world what women were doing in Colom- 
bia’s conflict areas, denounced human rights 
violations before the European Parliament, 
and convened an international meeting in 
Apartadé attended by women from several 
war-torn countries. She won backing from 
UNEsco and the collaboration of many 
NGOs and anonymous volunteers. 
All these activities brought her threats 
from guerrillas and paramilitary groups in 
Urabd (the Colombian army tried to hinder 
her work on several occasions) but also reco- 
gnition from her own country (Woman of the 
Year in 1995, the Sim6n Bolivar Medal from 
the Ministry of Education) and internatio- 
nally when the first Mayors for Peace Prize 
was awarded to her by the Director General 
of UNESCO in 1996. She is currently in Cara- 
cas (Venezuela) where she is heading UNEs- 
co’s Cities for Peace network (see box).Her 
ambition is to contribute to the advance of the 
current peace negotiations in Colombia by a 
“constructive dialogue”. “Freedom” she says, 
“begins with generosity and self-abnegation.”

your term of office, you were awarded the 
first UNesco Mayors for Peace Prize. What 
did this award mean to you? 
Quite simply it saved my life! And it also 
saved the lives of children, workers and 
artists in Apartadd.The prize gave us the 
opportunity to go on standing on our own 
feet and to get together to show the armed 
groups that in Apartadé there was a living 
force which they had to respect. 
Could the Apartado experience be exported 
to other regions in conflict? 
It 1s a worthwhile experience which 
should not be imposed but shared with 
other regions that may have different pro- 
blems,such as youth gangs,drugs,alcoho- 
lism or unemployment, but which, like 
Apartado, need to reinvest public life, to 
recover dignity and trust in democratic pro- 
cesses. We need to publicize this and simi- 
lar experiences, as we are doing through 
UNEsco’s Cities for Peace network, in 
order to demonstrate that the major crises 
in Latin America can be solved with humi- 
lity and intelligence, without resorting to 
violence and arms. 
Do you think there are universal 
mechanisms behind violence? 
At a meeting with women from 
Rwanda, Bosnia and Palestine and from 
other countries in Latin America which we 
organized in Apartadd, we saw that the dis- 
tress inflicted by war is the same everyw- 
here. The conflicts were different, but the 
common denominator was that there had 
been inadequate investment in education, 
health and utility infrastructure. Above all, 
in all these cases, there was an unfair 
income distribution policy, which made it 
possible for the rich to get richer and left 
broad swathes of society in a state of dire 
poverty. 
You now live in Venezuela.Are you thinking 
of going back to your own country? 
I am not an exile and I don’t want to be 
one. I am living in Venezuela because I am 
in charge of a UNEsco “Cities of Peace 
Network” project. But as soon as I can 
return to my country permanently to take 
part in the peace process,I shall do so. 
My stay in Venezuela has also given me 
the opportunity to relax mentally and to 
“digest” the pain of war. The faces of so 
many people who disappeared and the 
memory of so much spilt blood remain 
engraved in my mind. 
Are you still involved in Colombian public 
life? 
I keep in touch with my country 
TALKING TO... 
through the weekly opinion column I write 
in the Bogotd newspaper El Espectador. 
With university teachers, professionals, 
peasants and representatives of indigenous 
communities,I also belong to “Umbrales” 
(“Thresholds”), a discussion group which 
meets once a month to analyse the situation 
in my country. 
What message would you send to women 
at the close of the millennium? 
We women have succeeded in making 
progress as far as our civil, political and eco- 
nomic rights are concerned. We have ente- 
red the public sphere. However, there are 
still many women who go barefoot, some in 
the literal sense and others in the intellec- 
tual and emotional senses too. 
We women have to get ourselves orga- 
nized and recover our voices, our dignity, 
our intelligence and our role, and stop 
being consigned to arole imposed by men, 
and assume new social responsibilities. 
Lastly, we must trust ourselves and our 
ability to create and transform society 
through intelligence and love. I sincerely 
believe that this is what we are doing. WH 
Interview by 
A. Ortiz de Urbina and L. Iglesias Kuntz 
Cross-fire in Uraba 
rabd is a fertile but sparsely-populated region 
U. the northwest of Colombia, on the Carib- 
bean coast near the border with Panama. Since the 
1960s, the region’s economy has been based 
almost exclusively on banana plantations belon- 
ging to big landowners, most of whom live abroad. 
Uraba, which stretches over three Colombian 
provinces (Choco, Antioquia and Cérdoba), has 
always harboured smugglers. It is also a base for 
guerrilla movements whose power is largely 
unchecked in an area where the authority of the 
state is weak.But above all it is the most violent 
region of a country with record-breaking levels of 
criminality. Colombia,with a population of 38 mil- 
lion,has a violent murder rate three times higher 
than Brazil's and ten times higher than that of the 
United States 
Urabd’s economic centre is Apartado, a city of 
almost 100,000 inhabitants, over 1,000 widows 
and 4,500 orphans. During 
the three years (1995-1997) when Gloria Cuartas 
was mayor of Apartado,1,200 of its citizens were 
murdered, including seventeen city officials. Why is

the level of violence so high? 
After being kidnapped and ransomed by guer- 
rillas extorting a “ revolutionary tax” known as la 
vacuna (“ the vaccine” ), the big landowners organi- 
zed self-defence groups that soon became parami- 
litary militias. The army turned a blind eye to what 
was going on. Left to its own devices for over a 
decade by the Colombian government, the region is 
today reaping the consequences of a war without 
quarter between different guerrilla and paramilitary 
factions. What's more, the growing number of drug 
traffickers take sides either with the guerrillas or the 
militias, with the aim of chasing peasant farmers 
away and appropriating their land. The civilian popu- 
lation is paying a tragic price for these power 
struggles. Systematically suspected of helping the 
army, the guerrillas or the paramilitary forces, far- 
mers, farm workers and their families are being mas- 
sacred by one or another of these groups. The spiral 
of violence has produced a nightmare situation. 
Colombia’s new president, Andres Pastrana, who 
took office on 7 August 1998,began negotiations 
in October with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of 
Colombia (FARC) and the National Liberation Army 
(ELN), the two main guerrilla movements still active 
in the country. 
In Urabd and other regions, women have spoken 
out to try to halt the killings. In 1996, women from 
all over Colombia gathered in the village of Mutata 
(Urabd) to take part in a“ Road for Peace” demons- 
tration during which they proclaimed : “ We refuse 
to bear sons and daughters just to watch them 
die.” [|

«0 Straightforward language 
I have been a reader of the Courier since 
1967, and my response to the revamped 
version is that all the short but highly infor- 
mative articles make good reading. It is a 
pleasure,above all for manual workers like 
myself, to read articles written in straight- 
forward everyday language. Carry on along 
the same lines and you will win many rea- 
ders. At any rate I hope so.

=¢Hope and belief 
I and many of my friends are all in favour of 
the new Courier. 
It is just as interesting as before but it is 
more feisty and dynamic. When an inter- 
national organization professes to defend 
and promote human progress and the 
values of justice, equity, dignity and solida- 
rity for all—above all the most need y— 
within an economic system that tends to 
destroy all these values, the completely neu- 
tral presentation of information known as 
journalistic “objectivity” is no longer rele- 
vant ... 
This being the case, it is urgent to have 
the courage to identify and clearly designate 
responsibilities rather than simply act as an 
observer. This is what you have been doing 
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
in your articles since July-August. 
So I hope the Courier will continue to 
give us reasons to believe and hope in 
human beings, something which is today 
more vital than ever.

=¢ Keeping up with change 
In our opinion,the new Courier continues 
the magazine’s longstanding humanistic 
tradition. It is pleasant to look at, easy to 
read and its contents are varied. These 
changes undoubtedly match the changing 
circumstances and problems covered in 
your magazine.

The innovations introduced into the Cou-

son the new format is highly welcome. 
But I should like UNESCO to pay more 
attention to the health sector, not because I 
am a health service professional but because 
here in Africa we lack fresh ideas in this field.

... and sport 
The Courier’s new format is extremely 
attractive. I like the way the monthly dossier 
issandwiched between feature articles, the 
overall presentation, the quality of the 
reports, background articles, photos and 
other documentary material. All this makes 
the Courier an exceptional magazine, pro- 
viding a unique window on the world. 
As a long-time subscriber, I should like 
to offer you my congratulations and my 
gratitude for the information and ideas you 
provide each month.

«¢ Too much Internet 
As a subscriber to the Unesco Courier for 
several decades, I am very glad that you 
have changed the format of your magazine, 
which I had more or less stopped reading, 
except for a few articles each month. I felt 
that it was no longer adapted to current 
problems and no longer told me the kind of 
thing I want to know. 
However, I think it’s a pity that you devote 
so much space to the Internet, forgetting how 
many people still do not have a personal com- 
puter, in Europe as well as in Africa.
