Founded in 670 AD, the town of Al-Qayrawan (Kairouan), in north-central Tunisia, is famed for its walled medina 
and its Great Mosque which dates from the period of the 9th-century Aghlabid dynasty. One of the holy places 
of Islam, Al-Qayrawan has become a craft centre noted for its carpets.

Ctltorind 
AN it be that there is a cyclical 
( element in the appearance 
and disappearance of great 
men? Over the centuries the year ’83 
has been marked by the birth or the 
death of an unusually large number of 
outstanding figures whose lives and 
works have enriched the cultural 
heritage of mankind. 
In this issue of the Unesco Courier 
we evoke the memory of the 
prestigious representatives of the 
“class of ’83’° who figure on our 
front cover: Luther, Kafka, Euler, 
Marx, Stendhal, Gibran and Wagner. 
All of them have in their different 
ways helped to form the cultural iden- 
tity of the peoples from whom they 
sprang; but they are also figures of 
universal importance and for this 
reason we have, in most cases, 
selected authors to write about them 
from countries or geocultural areas 
other than their own. Thus Luther 
and Kafka are portrayed by two   
Frenchmen, Jacques-Noél Pérés and 
Maurice Nadeau, Stendhal by an 
Englishman, F.W.J. Hemmings, and 
Wagner by a Japanese, Mamoru 
Watanabe. 
We have made two exceptions to 
this line of approach: no one is better 
qualified to assess the scientific 
achievements of Euler than his 
SJellow-countryman Emile A. 
Fellmann, Secretary of the Euler 
Committee of the Swiss Society for 
the Natural Sciences, and only a 
writer of Arab culture, like Ghali 
Shukri, could accurately place the 
Lebanese poet Gibran Khalil Gibran 
within the context of his time, 
The works of Karl Marx, ‘‘a body 
of thought become a world” as they 
have been aptly described, seemed to 
demand a two-pronged approach: an 
examination of the complex and 
eventful history of the works 
themselves, presented by Georges 
Labica, and an assessment, by 
Nikolai Ivanovich Lapin, of the ideas 
that have become a powerful socio- 
economic force that has helped to 
shape the political landscape of the 
world today. 
Finally, we take a look at the aims, 
objectives and achievements of the 
Tokyo-based United Nations Univer- 
sity (UNU) after its first decade of ex- 
istence. One of the youngest of the 
United Nations institutions, the UNU 
is sponsored by the United Nations 
Organization and Unesco, with 
whose aims and preoccupations it has 
much in common since its task is to 
organize scholarly collaboration to 
identify and alleviate ‘‘pressing 
global problems of human survival, 
development and welfare’.

### 56321: Martin Luther, 1483-1546: the school of life

MARTIN LUTHER (1483-1546) 
The School of Life 
LTHOUGH Protestant churches 
A far and wide are this year cele- 
brating the 500th anniversary of 
the birth of Martin Luther, the great 
reformer, they are not so much com- 
memorating their founder (for they clearly 
look upon the Gospel of Jesus Christ as be- 
ing their founding doctrine), or any par- 
ticular saint, as paying authentic tribute to 
the genius of the man as he really was, with 
his acute intuitive sense yet with his short- 
comings, a man intent on dedicating his 
whole life to the Gospel. And when we 
speak of his whole life, we are thinking not 
only of matters pertaining to the religious 
sphere, to faith and the aspirations of the 
spirit, but also of the everyday aspects of 
existence. 
Although the Lutheran reform was 
primarily aimed at ensuring observance of 
the faith by deliberately ridding it of 
everything that was regarded as extraneous, 
it also addressed itself to making Christians 
responsible-minded citizens in the world of 
creation in which God placed them, in other 
words citizens also imbued with a sense of 
responsibility towards the community and 
society in which they are called upon to live. 
The age in which Luther lived was indeed 
remarkable. Perhaps we do not attach as 
much importance as we ought to the fact 
that it was also the age of Erasmus and 
Rabelais, of Albrecht Diirer and 
Michelangelo, of Copernicus and 
Paracelsus, of Machiavelli, Ignatius 
Loyola, Magellan and a host of other 
figures who gave added lustre to science, 
literature and the arts and embodied all the 
intellectual qualities, so much so that the 
age rightly came to be known as the 
‘‘Renaissance’’. 
It was also the age of Faust, or, again, of 
the Fugger banking dynasty, a time when it 
was thought that money could buy 
everything. As trade and finance expanded, 
the men of the sixteenth century and the 
centuries that followed were drawn towards 
anew path. Henceforward, they were to see 
the world in a different light and, naturally 
enough, a new quest for learning likewise 
made its impact felt. We attempt, in the few 
lines below, to highlight some of the aspects 
of Luther’s thinking on education which we 
regard as very relevant to the culture of his 
time and perhaps even of our own time, for 
that matter! 
Martin Luther was born in Eisleben, in 
 
JACQUES-NOEL PERES, French theolo-

Church of France. President of the Lutheran

movement, he teaches at the department of 
ecumenical studies of the Catholic Institute, 
Paris.

Saxony, on 10 November 1483, the son of 
Hans Luther and Margretha Ziegler, his 
wife. As he himself wrote: “I am a pea- 
sant’s son and my father, grandfather and 
forefathers were all real peasants’. It is true 
that he was of peasant stock but his parents 
went to seek their fortune in the copper and 
silver mines of the Mansfeld region and his 
father became a member of the Common 
Council of the town, where he had settled 
with his family in 1484. 
The young Luther had a strict upbring- 
ing, as he recalled in his Table Talk: “My 
parents were very harsh with me and, as a 
result, I grew up to be a shy child. On one 
occasion, for some petty reason, my mother 
whipped me so hard that the blood flowed. 
My parents had only my welfare at heart, 
but they were not good judges of character 
and their chastisement knew no bounds’. 
He was to remember this lesson later in life, 
when he came to think about teaching and 
about education in general. 
However that may be, the young Martin 
attended the Latin school at Mansfeld and 
was then sent to the school of the Brothers 
of the Common Life at Magdeburg, and 
later to the parish school of Eisenach. He 
then went on to become a student at the 
University of Erfurt, from which he

graduated as bachelor of arts before taking 
his master’s degree. He was set for a legal 
career but, against his father’s wishes, he 
chose instead to enter the monastery of the 
Augustinian Eremites at Erfurt. He was or- 
dained in the priesthood in 1507 and 
thereafter devoted himself to the study of 
theology. He was awarded a doctorate in 
theology in 1512 and, from 1513 onwards, 
taught Holy Scripture at the University of 
Wittenberg. 
Henceforward, all his energies were to be 
directed towards the Holy Writ, which he 
expounded with passion and which 
prompted him to embark on the task of 
reforming the Church, for which he is 
known. It was in the name of the principles 
which Luther discerned in the Bible that, on 
31 October 1517, he publicly posted his 
ninety-five theses against indulgences. It is

this act which is conventionally regarded as 
being the starting-point of the reformist 
movement, although it had, in fact, already 
been taking shape for a long time. 
In 1520 came the publication of the 
‘“‘great reformist writings’’, the term 
designating the Address to the Christian 
Nobility of the German Nation and the 
treatises on the Babylonian Captivity of the 
Church and the Freedom of a Christian 
Man. The Papal Bull ‘‘Exsurge Domine”’, 
by which the Pope excommunicated 
Luther, also dates from that year. 
From then onwards, events were to move 
quickly. In 1521, Luther was placed under 
the ban of the Empire by the Diet of 
Worms; in 1521-1522, the Elector of Sax- 
ony had him confined to the Wartburg for- 
tress, where he translated the New Testa- 
ment into German and thereby began to 
mould what was to become the modern 
German language (he completed the 
translation of the entire Bible in 1534); in 
1524-1525, the sorry Peasants’ Revolt 
broke out; in 1525, Luther became embroil-

ed in controversy with the humanist 
Erasmus of Rotterdam over the question of 
free will and “‘unfree’’ will and, in the same 
year, he married Katharina von Bora; 
while, in 1529, he published the Short and’ 
Long Catechisms, the remarkable guides to 
Christian doctrine in which Luther revealed 
his gifts as a teacher. 
In 1530, the Protestant theologians 
presented their confession of faith to the 
Imperial Diet at Augsburg. This accord- 
ingly came to be known as the Augsburg 
Confession and can be said to have formed . 
the charter of Lutheranism. Up to 1546, the 
year of his death, Luther went on writing

On 31 October 1517 Luther nailed on the door of the castle church 
at Wittenberg his famous ‘95 Theses’’ attacking various ec- 
clesiastical abuses. His act is usually considered to have precipitated 
the Reformation, the religious movement which would soon spread 
over northern Europe, have a far-reaching influence on Western 
Christianity and civilization, and also act as a seedbed of social, 
economic and political thought. Engraving shows Luther preaching in

sole the faithful and impart his teaching to 
them. To date, the standard Weimar edi- 
tion of Luther’s written works, known as 
the Weimarer Ausgabe, consists of a 
hundred-odd volumes and is still not 
complete! 
Education in the Middle Ages was com- 
pletely permeated by the ‘“fear of God’’ and 
it would not be altogether wrong to argue 
that its chief purpose was to teach people 
how to die well, in other words how to ap- 
pear before a God who was primarily look- 
ed upon as an implacable judge. Luther’s 
great discovery that God is not so much a 
sovereign Lord as a loving Father offering 
salvation through grace in an act of faith, 
prompted him to visualize a new system of 
education. 
It is significant that, from as early as 
1520, in the Address to the Christian 
Nobility of the German Nation, one of the 
three great reformist writings already men- 
tioned, Luther had already devoted several 
pages to the problem of education and had 
even sketched out a complete programme 
for university reform. He was forthright in 
voicing his opposition to scholasticism, in 
rejecting knowledge culled at second hand 
as a basis of instruction, and in advocating 
a return to primary sources. 
He urged the study of languages not for 
their own sake but as a means, as he saw it, »

» of being able to gain a better understanding 
of the Bible. As he himself put it: “‘I would 
willingly agree that we could keep Logic, 
Rhetoric and Aristotle’s Poetics and that, if 
they were put in a new and abridged form, 
they could be read with profit and could be 
used to give young people practice in the art 
of discourse and preaching, but the com- 
mentaries and glosses should be deleted, in 
the same way as Cicero’s Rhetoric can be 
read without commentaries or glosses. 
Aristotle’s Logic should be read as it 
stands, stripped of all its long commen- 
taries. Nowadays, orators or preachers can 
learn nothing useful from them, and they 
are no longer matter for disputation or 
quibbling. Along with these subjects, we 
would still have the Latin, Greek and 
Hebrew languages, the mathematical 
sciences and history, concerning all of 
which I defer to people who are more com- 
petent to judge. The results would certainly 
be excellent if a serious endeavour were 
made to embark on reform. The fact of the

developed an argument which still seems 
strangely modern to us even today: ‘‘Sirs’’, 
he wrote, “‘If such large sums have to be 
spent every year on firearms, roads, 
bridges, dykes and innumerable things of 
the same nature, so that towns can enjoy 
temporal peace and security, why should 
not the same sums be spent on poor young 
people in need by maintaining one or two 
qualified men as schoolteachers?” 
Indeed, the teaching profession was 
highly esteemed by Luther, to the extent 
that, in his Discourse on the Duty of Sen- 
ding Children to School (1530), he claimed 
that, had he not been a preacher, the calling 
he would have most liked to follow was that 
of schoolmaster. And he went on to explain 
how interesting and agreeable it was to 
“train and raise young saplings’’ even if, 
alas, some of them were to snap in the pro- 
cess. Thus Luther showed that he was 
acutely conscious of the nobility of the task 
facing educators and, while he singled out

matter is that the issue is a most important 
one!”’ 
However, Luther was not only interested 
in university education, and he made a 
number of suggestions concerning elemen- 
tary schooling; among other things, he pro- 
posed that every town and village should 
open a school not only for boys but for girls 
as well. In his own words: “Would to 
Heaven that each town had a girls’ school, 
where they could hear the Gospel in Latin 
or in German for an hour every day!” It is 
quite plain from this short passage that 
Luther’s main aim was to enable everybody 
to read and understand the Bible. 
Several years later, in 1524, in his Letfer 
to the Mayors and Aldermen of All the 
Cities in Behalf of Christian Schools—the 
title is a whole programme in itself —Luther

a specific aspect of Luther’s thinking about 
education. Although, in some instances, he 
claims that it is essential to set up schools 
because the parents’ own lack of education 
prevents them from catering for the educa- 
tional needs of their children, it will be 
noted that each of the fundamental points 
in his Short Catechism, which dates from 
1529, is prefaced by the phrase ‘as the head 
of the family should present it and teach it 
simply to his children and servants’. This 
calls for two comments: in the first place, 
instruction (although, in the case in point, 
it is true that he is speaking of religious in- 
struction) should not be confined to the 
children of the family, but should also be 
imparted to servants and to everybody liv- 
ing under the same roof—in other words, in 
modern parlance, there should be no 
““streaming’’. Secondly, Luther calls for the 
participation of the head of the family. 
Parents should not stand aloof from the 
education of their children and, what is 
more, should play an active part in it.

that aspect of the profession that was most 
exhilarating, he did not gloss over the possi- 
ble failures they might encounter. 
On this issue, Luther was neither naive 
nor idealistic and he clearly realized that 
what might be called theoretical education 
was not an end in itself and that it was not 
an adequate preparation for everyday life. 
This is why he urged that, in addition to be- 
ing given a formal education, young people 
should be taught a trade: ‘‘Boys should be 
sent to such schools for an hour or two a 
day but, even so, they should be made to 
work in the home for the rest of the time 
and to learn the trade or occupation for 
which they are intended, so that the two go 
hand-in-hand for as long as they are young 
and are able to apply themselves’. 
Here again, emphasis has to be placed on 
In the Short Catechism, Luther visualizes 
the method of instruction as taking the 
form of a dialogue, a sequence of questions 
and answers which, little by little, enable 
the pupil to grasp what the teacher wishes to 
convey, whether this be the father, as 
Luther advocated in his day, or the pastor 
nowadays, for what is quite remarkable is 
that the Short Catechism has dated so little 
that it is still being used in a large number 
of Lutheran parishes all over the world. 
Knowledge is communicated, but there is 
absolutely no question of cramming willy- 
nilly abstruse notions into young people’s 
brains. It is much more in the nature of a 
tradition, a living thing, an experience 
which each generation hands down to that 
succeeding it. 
After Luther, the Reformers such as

### 56321: Martin Luther, 1483-1546: the school of life

Melanchthon—who was known as the 
“‘schoolmaster’” of Germany—Calvin and 
others followed the same path. The ap- 
proach they took may have differed, but 
their goals were the same, What we are try- 
ing to say is that they all conceived of a ge- 
nuine ‘“‘cultural design’’ embracing all the 
facets of life, whether it be the life of faith 
or life in society. Their main concern was 
not to produce scholars but rather men and 
women capable of living their lives in accor- 
dance with moral tenets bearing witness to 
the immense upheaval in which they had 
been caught up through grace. In other 
words, the ‘“‘fear of God’’ of medieval 
education, which we have already mention- 
ed and which taught people to prepare for 
death, was replaced by Luther and his 
disciples by the passionate love of the God 
of salvation which carries people along the 
path of life. 
In this sense, Luther’s ideas on education 
could still be said to represent a challenge. 
In the wake of Luther the Reformer, the 
present-day world, like that of the sixteenth 
century, is constantly on the move and we 
see the far-reaching changes taking place as 
every day goes by. Should we not continue 
to hold to the view, therefore, that a good 
  
education, in fact, is an education that is 
resolutely optimistic in outlook and evolves 
through constant dialogue, with the aim of 
teaching us to live with a sense of dignity 
and an eye to the future? 
It is true that Luther laid stress on what 
might be called the Christian dimension of 
education, in which the Gospel was ex- 
pected to occupy an overwhelming place. 
This is how he set out to instil the idea that 
discipline, culture and even morality are all 
subordinated to the awareness which Chris- 
tians are expected to have of being invested, 
through grace, with a new life that ultimate- 
ly enables them to assert their freedom from 
what would otherwise be a form of con- 
straint. Yet Luther seems to be telling us 
that this is the only means by which educa- 
tion can escape from the narrow confines 
dictated by so-called philosophies or pass- 
ing fashions that go all too often by the 
name of culture, so that it can ultimately 
become the Schoo! of Life—and we have 
used capitals deliberately.

The Wartburg castle, above, stands on a steep hill overlooking the town of Eisenach 
in the German Democratic Republic. While confined in this romantic setting, Luther 
began to translate the New Testament from Greek into German. The result, published 
in 1522, combined with his translation of the Old Testament which followed later, 
was a literary masterpiece which did much to shape the development of the modern 
German language. Left, the room in the Wartburg where Luther translated the New 
Testament is today preserved as a memorial to his historic achievement.

### 56322: Leonhard Euler, 1707-1783: a child of the sun

LEONHARD EULER (1707-1783) 
A child of the 
HE exact sciences have been so 
misused in their technological 
and ecological applications that 
they have fallen into considerable 
disrepute in recent years. But that 
should not prevent us from paying 
tribute, on the second centenary of his 
death, to one who, in the general 
history of civilization and scientific 
humanism, ranks as one of science’s 
most eminent representatives. 
Leonhard Euler was not only by far 
the most productive mathematician in 
history, but also one of the greatest 
savants of all time. A cosmopolitan in 
the truest sense, he spent his early 
years in Basel (Switzerland), worked 
for a total of more than thirty years in 
St. Petersburg (now Leningrad), and 
spent a quarter of a century in Berlin, 
then the capital of Prussia. In terms of 
popularity and fame, he ranks with 
Galileo, Newton and Albert Einstein. 
Euler's contemporaries and biogra- 
phers all agree that, as the astrologers 
say, he was "'a child of the sun’’, of a 
gay and open nature, sociable and full 
of humour. Sometimes he would lose 
his temper, but never for long and he 
would always end by laughing at his 
own outbursts. There was, however, 
one subject about which he would tol- 
erate no levity, and that was religion 
and the Christian faith. His strictness in 
matters of religious belief explains 
many facts of his life such as, for in- 
stance, his relentless assaults on the 
Leibniz theory of monads (taken over 
by Wolff), or his violent attacks on 
some of the encyclopedists and other 
free-thinkers (in his theological work 
Sauvegarder la Révélation Divine, 
1747). Nevertheless, Euler's practical 
tolerance was much greater and more 
sincere than that of his royal master, 
who used the word because it was 
fashionable, but readily forgot it if its 
practical application embarrassed him 
in the least. 
Euler was also extremely modest in 
regard to scientific copyright. Unlike 
most scientists of all time, he never 
claimed any prior rights over his own 
discoveries. Indeed in his generosity he 
sometimes went so far as to make a 
gift of new discoveries and ideas. He 
never concealed anything in his works,

Leonhard Euler (1707-1783) 
was the most prolific mathema- 
tician in history and ranks with 
such figures as Galileo, Newton 
and Einstein as one of the great 
scientists of all time. Above,

always put his cards on the table, and 
gave the reader a fair chance of 
discovering something new. What is 
more, in many instances he would lead 
him to the threshold of a new discovery 
and, like a true teacher, let him have 
the pleasure of achieving it. This is 
why the study of Euler's works is a 
unique experience, both entertaining 
and fascinating. 
 
However skilled a man may be in 
making abstractions and in ob- 
taining general ideas, he could 
make no progress without the aid 
of languages, which is twofold, 
first in the form of speech and se- 
cond in the form of writing. 
Euler 
The Euler phenomenon is essentially 
due to three factors. In the first place, 
he had a prodigious memory. Appa- 
rently whatever he heard, saw or read 
was for ever engraved in his memory.

For instance, it is said that when he 
was quite old he would still delight his 
family and friends by faithfully reciting 
in Latin any of the verses of Virgil's 
Aeneid. Years after they were held, he 
still knew by heart the reports of 
academic meetings. And this is not to 
speak of his memory for everything 
concerning mathematics. Secondly, 
this prodigious memory was combined 
with rare powers of concentration. 
Sur ounding noise and bustle scarcely 
dis rbed the workings of his mind. To 
qu-te his friend and colleague 
Thiebault, “with a child on his knee 
and a cat on his shoulder—that is how 
he wrote his immortal works’. The 
third key to the Euler mystery was 
simply calm, untiring effort. 
Euler is a unique phenomenon 
because of his output alone. The list 
prepared by Gustave Enestrom and 
published in 1910-1913 of works 
printed up to that time comprises 866 
items, and the great Swiss edition of 
Euler's works, on which many experts 
of various nationalities have been 
working since the beginning of the pre- 
sent century, so far contains 70 quarto 
volumes, to be followed by 14 vol- 
umes of “letters and manuscript’’. 
in the volume of his output, Euler is 
in no way inferior to such prolific cre- 
ators as Voltaire, Goethe, Leibniz or 
Telemann. The following table, divided 
into ten-year periods, gives an idea of 
the number of works written by Euler 
and ready for printing (not counting 
some dozens of still undated items}:

» modern, was the consistent applica- 
tion of differential and integral calculus 
to contemporary problems in mecha- 
nics. Application of the calculus of 
variations to the theory of girder stress 
led Euler to the formula of stress, 
which we now know thanks to him and 
without which modern engineering 
would be inconceivable. In a special 
application of a general theory, he also 
discovered the optimum form of profile 
for the rim of cogwheels (development 
pitches). This was not applied in prac- 
tice until the 19th century, since when 
it has become indispensable in the con- 
struction of machinery. 
Euler's first major study in the field 
of fluid mechanics was a comprehen- 
sive treatise on ships. Here he deals 
with the general theory of the 
equilibrium of floating bodies and—an 
innovation at that time—studies the 
problems of stability as well as the ef- 
fect of minor oscillations near the state 
of equilibrium. Applying the general 
theory to the particular case of a ship, 
Euler founded a new science and had a 
lasting influence on the development 
of maritime navigation and naval 
engineering. In the history of technics, 
Euler's experiments with - Segner’s 
hydraulic engine and his resultant 
theory of water turbines are well 
known. About forty years ago, Jakob 
Ackeret built a turbine exactly in accor- 
dance with Euler's directions and for- 
mulae, and found that it was more than 
71 per cent efficient—a remarkable 
result considering that today, with the 
most modern means and comparable 
dimensions, turbines of this type are 
scarcely more than 80 per cent 
efficient. 
Throughout his life, Euler was also 
interested in optics. In this field too, he 
is the author of the first textbooks in 
the modern sense, and formulated a 
general theory of the refracting lens 
telescope. He played a considerable 
réle in the discovery of achromatic lens 
systems (which do not distort colours). 
Seven volumes of his Opera Omnia are 
devoted to optics. 
10 
Euler's work in astronomy covers a 
wide spectrum. It includes determining 
the trajectories of comets and planets 
from only a small number of observa- 
tions, the solar parallax, and the theory 
of refraction of atmospheric rays. His 
most important treatises deal! directly 
or indirectly with celestial mechanics, 
a branch of research founded by 
Newton which engaged the greatest 
attention of the leading mathemati- 
cians of that time. His theory concern- 
ing the moon, on which the astrono- 
mer Tobie Mayer of Gottingen based 
his famous ‘Lunar Tables’’ in 1755, 
enabled the longitude of a ship at sea 
to be determined with a previously 
unequalled precision. For a century, 
these ‘Lunar Tables’’ of Euler and 
Mayer were used in navigation at sea. 
theology and ethics, and end with the 
famous attempt to refute Berkeley's 
absolute idealism and the ideas of 
Hume. Euler’s place in the history of 
philosophy is still disputed, but his 
more or less direct influence on Kant 
cannot be denied. 
Many treasures still remain to be 
discovered in the works of Euler, but it 
will be a long time before this pro- 
digious body of work is fully in print 
and available to all. An adequate 
biography of this, the most eminent of 
Switzerland's expatriate sons, has still 
to be written. Indeed such an enter- 
prise would be almost equivalent to 
writing the entire history of mathema- 
tical science in the eighteenth century.

STENDHAL (1783-1842) 
To the happy few 
 
  
    Portrait of Stendhal (1783-1842) by Henri Lehmann (1841). 
    
by EE W. J. Hemmings 
  
F.W.J. HEMMINGS, of the United Kingdom, 
is Professor of French Literature in the Univer- 
sity of Leicester, England. His Stendhal: a 
study of his novels (Oxford, 1964) is one of 
several books of his on nineteenth-century 
French authors which include Zola, Dumas, 
and Baudelaire. 
OST people who have read any 
M Stendhal at all will have read 
Le Rouge et le Noir. This 
novel was published as long ago as 1830, 
but there are still arguments about what 
Stendhal may have intended by his col- 
ourful title. Most probably, Red is meant 
to stand for blood and cannon-fire, the 
“red badge of courage’, to borrow 
Stephen Crane’s phrase, in other words 
the military life, and Black for the 
clerical cloth, the Church.

The hero, Julien Sorel, is a young man 
with ambitions who has to decide, at the 
outset of his life, what career will be most 
profitable for him to follow. He belongs 
to a post-war generation; it is only from 
old men, like the retired army surgeon 
who is one of the few real friends of his 
boyhood, that he learns of the 
Napoleonic epic, when the French flag 
was carried in triumph all over Europe;

ment that favours the Church. So Julien 
decides to conceal his admiration for 
Napoleon, to enter the Church and to use 
it as a ladder to make his way to the top. 
In fact, Julien is never even ordained. 
He begins as a private tutor to the sons of 
a businessman in the town in south-east 
France where he was born. Then he 
enters the seminary at Besangon; but he 
leaves this to become the confidential 
secretary of a powerful nobleman in 
Paris, though he continues to wear the 
black suit which is ‘“the uniform of my 
century’, as he says. 
But before the end comes his 
employer, the Marquis de la Mole, has 
agreed to accept him as his son-in-law

army. So there is a symbolic return of the 
“red” before, in a rash and one might 
think uncharacteristic act, Julien casts 
away all he has achieved, is arrested for 
attempted murder, tried and executed. 
Julien Sorel conforms in many ways to 
the stereotype of the romantic hero: he is 
intelligent, brave, and handsome; but he 
is different in his duplicity and hypocrisy, 
necessary in order to keep secret his am- 
bitious dreams and pass himself off as a 
humble servant of the Church, Only 
women seem to sense in him the potential 
greatness that he hides beneath a cloak of 
mystery. Stendhal departed from the 
normal practice among novelists of his 
time by introducing two heroines, each of 
whom in turn falls in love with the hero, 
though they are as unlike one another as 
they possibly could be; Madame de 
Rénal, the wife of his first employer, is 
a gentle, maternal figure, whereas 
Mathilde de la Mole, the Marquis’s 
daughter, is a haughty, unconventional 
girl who admires Julien because he is so 
different from the buzzing swarm of 
empty-headed young aristocrats who are 
suitors to her hand.

Stendhal carried on a long and tender correspondence with his sister 
Pauline. In this fragment of a letter to Pauline he sketched himself 
galloping to a burning house near Brunswick. 
Le Rouge et le Noir was the first 
masterpiece of the French novel to ap- 
pear in the nineteenth century, that cen- 
tury which saw the appearance of so 
many masterpieces by such novelists as 
Balzac, Flaubert, and Zola. Yet at first it 
shocked most of its readers. They did not 
know what to make of Julien, so admi- 
rable in many ways, yet so ruthless and 
unscrupulous in others. He was the first 
incarnation ever of a new phenomenon— 
the individual at war with society, bent 
on dominating it by his own strength of 
character. He desires neither money nor, 
really, social position, but the simple 
satisfaction of attaining each of his suc- 
cessive goals, quite regardless of the 
moral implications of his methods. 
His creator, the man called Henri 
Beyle who adopted, no one knows why, 
this Germanic pseudonym Stendhal for 
his books, was quite unlike Julien in 
these respects and indeed it is often 
thought that Julien and the heroes of his 
later novels were the creations of wish- 
fulfilment, since they all possess the ad- 
vantages he knew himself to lack: good 
looks, personal magnetism, will-power, 
riches or rank, as the case might be. 
Stendhal was already a man in his late 
forties when he published Le Rouge et le 
Noir, having been born in 1783 —exactly 
two hundred years ago—though not into 
a working-class family, as Julien was, 
but as the only son of a fairly well-to-do 
landowner in Grenoble. He had an 
unhappy childhood, losing his mother, 
whom he adored, at an early age, but in 
1799, at the age of sixteen, he came to 
Paris to enrol as a student in the Ecole 
Polytechnique, for the subject he had 
been best at in school was, oddly, 
mathematics. Now 1799 was the year of 
the coup d’état by which Napoleon 
established himself as ruler of France. 
Shortly afterwards, Beyle joined the 
army and crossed the Alps to northern 
Italy, recently conquered by Napoleon 
after a brilliant campaign. Italy had an 
immediate and electrifying effect on 
Beyle: he fell in love with the country and 
everything about it—its art, its architec- 
ture, its music, and the countryside itself, 
not to mention the women. This passion 
for Italy lasted the rest of his life. 
For the next fifteen years, as was the 
case with so many young men in France 
at the time, Beyle’s career was bound up 
with Napoleon’s fortunes. He served for 
a while in Brunswick, in the military ad- 
ministration of occupied Germany; he 
undertook missions to Berlin and 
Moscow, and he participated in the ill- 
fated retreat of the Grande Armée in 
1812. Whenever he could, he returned to 
his beloved Italy and when, in 1814, 
Napoleon was compelled to abdicate, he 
decided to settle in Milan for the rest of

his life. He did not even return to France 
during Napoleon’s brief attempt, in 
1815, to regain his throne, and so he was 
never actually present at the battle of 
Waterloo which is so vividly described in 
his other great novel, La Chartreuse de 
Parme. 
Lombardy at this time was a client 
state of Austria, and Beyle, who had 
close friends among the Italian patriots 
who were plotting for national in- 
dependence and unification, was even- 
tually declared persona non grata and 
had to return to Paris. 1t was only then,

year, after the revolution of July 1830

Beyle, or Stendhal as we can now call 
him, had friends in the new administra- 
tion, who found him a job as French con- 
sul in the little Italian seaport of 
Civitavecchia, then in the Papal States. 
He kept this situation, which at least gave 
him enough to live on, for the rest of his 
life, though he was dreadfully bored with 
the dull, lonely existence he led in this 
out-of-the-way port, and sorely missed

was he able to return to France, having 
been granted a short leave which he 
managed to spin out for three years. 
To while away the dreary hours of 
idleness in Civitavecchia, he had started 
on another novel, Lucien Leuwen, about 
the adventures of a wealthy banker’s son 
in the army and the civil service. It was

Henry Brulard, an autobiography which 
takes the story of his life down to his first 
visit to Italy. Almost everything we know 
about Stendhal’s childhood and adoles- 
cence derives from this book. We learn 
among other things that his favourite 
reading as a boy was Don Quixote, and 
that he imbibed from his great-aunt 
Elisabeth the principles of what he called 
espagnolisme, or Spanish honour, which 
was the direct opposite of bourgeois 
calculations of profit and loss. It implied 
a sense of what was truly noble and a cor- 
responding horror of low-mindedness, 
and kept a man from ever committing a 
base or shabby act. Stendhal maintained 
that espagnolisme had been a lodestar in 
his life ever since.

Stendhal wrote, or rather dictated, his 
second masterpiece, La Chartreuse de 
Parme. Many readers prefer this book to 
Le Rouge et le Noir, for it is less urgent 
and less bitter, full of gaiety and yet 
steeped in regretful melancholy. All the 
characters are Italian which, considering 
that the book is written, of course, in 
French makes it almost unique, a kind of 
Franco-Italian novel; just as Joseph Con- 
rad regarded England as his adopted 
country, so for Stendhal Italy, the Italy 
of the Po valley and the mountain lakes, 
was the land he had given his heart to. 
The scene switches between Milan, Par- 
ma, and Bologna, though towards the 
beginning of the book there is a long se- 
quence set in France which culminates in 
the description of the battle of Waterloo 
already mentioned. 
Fabrice, the young hero of Stendhal’s 
story, is a fanatic admirer of Napoleon, 
and when he hears that the great man has 
left the little island of Elba to which he 
had been banished and is engaged on one 
last gamble to recover his lost empire, he 
decides, though only sixteen, to make his 
way to Paris and offer his services to 
Napoleon. 
Fabrice is full of generous illusions, 
and the first thing that happens to him is 
that he is locked up on suspicion of being 
.a spy. But he succeeds in making his way 
to the front, and what he then witnesses 
puzzles him as being totally unlike what 
he had imagined a battle would be. The 
confusion and the general unreality of 
the scene is what Stendhal—who had 
been present at other battlefields, though 
not at this one—conveys above all else in 
these marvellous pages; and the question 
Fabrice is always asking: *‘Is this a real 
battle?’’, has ironic implications when 
one remembers that it was Waterloo, 
more than any other clash of arms in the 
last century, that decided the subsequent 
course of history. Tolstoy in particular 
admired this brilliant presentation of the 
chaos of modern warfare

»remembered it when describing the battle 
of Borodino in War and Peace. 
Apart from Fabrice, there are three 
other main characters in the book, who 
form a sort of loose association living 
their lives according to different prin- 
ciples from the rest of humanity. They 
see the power-struggle, in which everyone 
else is engaged, as a game of chess or 
whist, not to be taken too seriously; one 
has to learn the rules of the game, but a 
sensible person would never dream of 
passing moral judgement on the rules. 
This observation is made by Count 
Mosca, the middle-aged prime minister 
at Parma and an adept at court intrigue; 
but political power and influence mean 
nothing in themselves to Mosca, for 
whom the only serious thing in life is his 
love-affair with Gina Sanseverina. She is 
undoubtedly Stendhal’s outstanding 
feminine creation: a woman of sudden 
impulses, infinite charm, and complete 
amorality. She is secretly in love with

With you this evening, I sing in Stendhal 
the dazzling adversary of all dogmas 
the enemy of thrones and altars 
raised far from the burning feasts of the flesh. 
I sing the secret Stendhal-land of each life

and the endless dramas of the Third World 
and of the whole world which beats with 
the star of our childhood.

Fabrice, but, as her nephew, he regards 
her with affection but without ardour. In 
the second part of the book the cheerful 
recklessness of Gina leads her to offend 
the Prince; to revenge himself, he has 
Fabrice imprisoned in the Farnese tower, 
the State prison of Parma. This period of 
captivity and danger turns out paradox- 
ically to be the happiest in Fabrice’s life, 
for it is then that he falls in love for the 
first time; and the girl is none other than 
the daughter of the prison gqvernor, 
Clélia Conti, who is persuaded by Gina 
to smuggle in the rope ladder by which he 
climbs down from his cell at the top of 
the tower. 
There is, however, no happy end to the 
story. Fabrice escapes with Gina to 
Switzerland, but she is driven to fury and 
despair when she realizes that he loves 
not her but Clélia. There is little hap- 
piness either for the two lovers, for Clélia 
has to accept a man she does not love for 
husband, and dies a few years later. 
Fabrice, broken-hearted, follows her into 
the grave, and only Mosca, the oldest of 
them all, survives to preside nonchalantly 
over the fortunes of Parma, preferring to 
remain in power rather than that some 
scoundrel should take his place. All in 
all, it is a melancholy evocation of the 
fine, careless rapture of youth, doomed 
to be submerged in the rising tide of 
maturity, with all its deceptions, dissen- 
sions, and disappointments. 
Stendhal lived only three years after 
the appearance of La Chartreuse de 
Parme, long enough at least to read with 
intense pleasure the magnificent review 
that Balzac gave it. Few of his contem- 
poraries, however, shared Balzac’s en- 
thusiasm, a circumstance which hardly 
surprised Stendhal, who used to say he 
would not be properly appreciated until a 
century after his death. But he knew— 
and he was right in this—that he would 
always have a small number of devotees, 
the minority he must have been thinking 
of when he dedicated La Chartreuse de 
. Parme ‘‘to the happy few”. Today, 
throughout the world, the ‘*happy few’’ 
have become a great army for whom 
nothing that Stendhal wrote is indif- 
ferent, for in everything we can hear the 
echoes of that impertinent, ironical, and 
yet enthusiastic voice which reaches us 
unimpaired across the gulf of time.

### 56330: Richard Wagner, 1813-1883: a dilettante genius

RICHARD WAGNER (1813-1883) 
A dilettante 
genius 
by Mamoru Watanabe 
ICHARD Wagner belongs to that 
R select group of world personalities 
—Napoleon and Goethe are also 
of their number—to whom biographers 
seem irresistibly drawn. 
Some, drawn to his glorious music, 
feel the urge to study his life; others, 
maybe puzzled by the controversy sur- 
rounding his life and character, decide to 
seek the truth through the story of his 
life. Others, again, feel such antipathy 
for the man that they embark on his por- 
trait much like a painter who, because he 
does not wish simply to depict beauty, is 
attracted to ugliness and uses it in an at- 
tempt to arrive at the truth. Such was my 
motive when I set out to write Wagner’s 
biography. 
I believe that no other musician lived 
his life on such a vast and varied scale. 
Perhaps no artist has ever been so 
human, superhuman and sometimes in- 
human as Wagner. His life, like his 
musical eceuvre, was titanic. 
Yet as I advanced in my research, I 
realised that the most extraordinary thing 
about Wagner was not the variety of his 
life, nor the breadth of its range. Those 
qualities masked something else—a single, 
soaring truth: to create great art, the ar- 
tist must be totally uncompromising. 
Wagner was certainly that. Why did he 
not try to change his life-style instead of 
running up debts? Why did he betray the 
man who was his generous benefactor by 
having an affair with his wife? Why did 
he take unfair advantage of the uncondi- 
tional affection shown towards him by 
MAMORU WATANABE, Japanese musico- 
logist, was director of the Japanese Cultural 
Institute in Cologne, Federal Republic of Ger- 
many from 1976 until 1982. He has published 
widely on music and has translated many 
works on music and other subjects from Ger- 
man into Japanese and vice versa.

the young king Ludwig II of Bavaria? 
There is only one answer: the act of ar- 
tistic creation was the be-all and end-all 
of Wagner's life; it guided his every deci- 
sion. All else, including bourgeois 
morality, was relegated to second place. 
There can be no doubt that he believed 
in the worth of his music. That self- 
assurance led him to publish private edi- 
tions of his works—and get into debt as 
a result—after music publishers had 
turned them down, and to throw his con- 
siderable energies into getting his operas 
put on at various opera houses. 
But when, on occasion, he acted in 
such a way as to offend bourgeois stan- 
dards of morality, he was motivated not 
by self-assurance, but by his irrepressible »

» creative urge. Fanned by the confidence 
he had in his music, that urge became in- 
creasingly violent. He thought it quite 
normal for millionaires to give him 
financial support so he could continue 
creating. If he sank deeper and deeper in- 
to debt, it was not because he was sure 
that his operas would be successful, when 
staged, and thus enable him to repay 
what he owed, but because with: ut 
financial assistance he could not h e 
created at all. 
He believed that society alone, -t 
himgelf, bore responsibility for t' e 
debts. 
It was an attitude that was no doubt 
justifiable in part, for if the present-day 
system of royalties had been in force at 
the time, he would probably have been 
spared his financial problems, at least 
during the second half of his life. Cre- 
ation also lay at the origin of his love for 
another man’s wife, and that love be- 
came indissociable for him from his cre- 
ative work. Wagner suffered from the

fact that his marriage with Minna had 
failed, but he could not bring himself to 
conform to the ordered bourgeois ex- 
istence she wanted him to lead. The act of 
creation forbade him to do so. 
Moreover, Wagner’s view of creation 
was such that he did not regard an opera 
as completed when he had finished writ- 
ing it: it had to be staged as well. But 
staging often posed almost insuperable 
difficulties, and caused Wagner to act in 
a way which, according to bourgeois 
standards, could only be described as 
grossly selfish. Wagner was willing to 
stop at nothing in order to get his operas 
performed. 
16 
The philosophér Friedrich Nietzsche 
was right when he detected a certain dilet- 
tantism in Wagner. Thomas Mann was 
of the same opinion. Recently, some 
Japanese writers have argued that it is a 
great mistake to regard Wagner as a di- 
lettante. In my view, however, it is by 
recognizing his dilettantism that we can 
properly appreciate his art. I do not pro- 
pose to discuss at length those charac- 
teristics of Wagner that marked him out 
as a non-specialist par excellence—the 
grounding in dilettantism he received 
when still an adolescent, the awkward 
poetic conception of his inordinately 
long libretti, his lack of discrimination

when it came to the visual arts, the 
amateurish way he took up the ideas of 
Schopenhauer, and his fondness for cir- 
cumlocution in both the expression and 
the theoretical articulation of his essays. 
It is more instructive to explore the 
positive side of the relationship between 
Wagner’s art and dilettantism. We 
should remember, to start with, that his 
dilettantism formed part of, and helped 
to accentuate, a trend among nineteenth- 
century musicians. Many of them had an 
unorthodox or insufficient musical 
education, were also interested in other 
arts than music (especially literature and 
the theatre), and picked up the technique 
of musical composition relatively late in 
life. Weber, Schumann and Lortzing, for 
example, differed in this respect from 
earlier classical composers. Wagner's 
own artistic approach could be said to 
have followed the musical approach of 
the German Romantic composers and to 
have taken it to extremes. But in later 
composers such as Brahms or Richard 
Strauss, all traces of this approach have 
disappeared. 
It needs to be stressed that Wagner 
became a successful artist precisely 
because he succeeded, in many respects, 
in overcoming his dilettantism. As 
regards the technique of musical com- 
position, in particular, he achieved an 
almost unparalleled virtuosity. The brio 
and originality he showed in his modula- 
tions, instrumental technique, and use of 
harmony are still extremely influential. 
In the art of dramatic composition, too, 
 
he displayed expert technical skill, and 
Goétterdimmerung, the opera he wrote 
towards the end of his life, is one of the 
great works in the world history of stage 
performance. There remains the question 
of Wagner’s use of language, but as a 
non-German speaker I do not feel quali- 
fied to pass judgment on that point. 
However, as Thomas Mann pointed out, 
there are many passages which undenia- 
bly reveal great talent. It would also be a 
mistake, particularly in the case of 
Wagner, to remove the poetry from its 
musical context and evaluate it separate- 
ly. Wagner’s achievements as a techni- 
cian are poles apart from dilettantism. 
Dilettantism had another implication 
for Wagner, for it enabled him to carry 
through such a vast and original enter- 
prise. The proverb which says ‘‘the blind 
man fears not the snake’’ is relevant to 
the audacity of Wagner’s genius. Similar-

ly, if he succeeded in breaking away from 
the rules laid down by professional musi- 
cians and playwrights, it was entirely due 
to his dilettantism. How else could he 
have conceived his extraordinary theory 
of the Gesamtkunstwerk, or total work 
of art? How else could he have dared to 
draw on German legends that even 
Goethe had ignored? How else could he 
have aspired to build a theatre where his 
works, and his works alone, would be 
performed? 
Yet, in giving life to his audacious 
visions, Wagner was driven by a creative 
genius allied to extraordinary powers of 
execution. 
The fact that Wagner was such an ex- 
treme dilettante brings a note of bur- 
lesque to his biography. His life was a 
human comedy, not a drama. Was des- 
tiny astonished by the force of his 
creativity, for fortune smiled on him 
many times? He had a narrow escape not 
only when he fled the revolt of Dresden 
but on many other occasions. Whenever 
he found himself at bay, assailed by his 
creditors, a generous benefactor would 
inevitably appear on the scene. His ex- 
traordinary idea for building a theatre 
where nothing but his own works would 
be staged eventually came to fruition. 
And if his operas continue to exert such 
a wide appeal today, and to attract so 
many directors, is it not because they are 
in a way tragi-comedies? 
Wagner wrote an impressive number 
 
Where to find the human energy 
to resist the paralysing pressure of 
a civilization which denies man 
utterly, to resist the presump- 
tuousness of a culture which uses 
the human mind only as the 
motive force of the machine? 
Richard Wagner 
 
of ideological essays and treatises on art 
which once again display a combination 
of dilettantism and its diametrical op- 
posite, specialization. Acute insights rub 
shoulders with faulty judgments. But the 
ultimate purpose of these essays was to 
act as a spur to their author’s creativity. 
Among the many problems posed by 
Wagner's philosophy, his anti-semitism 
is justifiably condemned. Setting aside 
the context of their time, Wagner’s feel- 
ings appear as an emotional reaction 
based on a crude generalization. Wagner 
himself wondered whether he did not 
have Jewish blood in his veins. The suf- 
fering that wracked his subconscious 
mind was a reflection of the dark forces 
of anti-semitism in nineteenth-century 
Europe. 
The number of Wagner operas per- 
formed in Japan is very low compared 
with those by Mozart, Verdi or Puccini.

Choral scene from Act 3 of Wagner's The Flying Dutchman as performed at the 
Metropolitan Opera, New York, in March 1979. The structure of the ship is the only

atmosphere created by the hanging skeletons, the choir interprets his nightmare. 
 
The most recent production of Wagner's famous tetralogy The Ring of the Nibelung, 
by Sir Peter Hall, director, and Sir Georg Solti, conductor, was performed in July at the 
annual Richard Wagner opera festival at Bayreuth. Above, a scene from The Twilight 
of the Gods, the fourth part of the cycle, with Hildegard Behrens as Brunnhilde, Aage 
Haugland as Hagen, and Manfred Jung as Siegfried. 
This is not because Wagner is not liked in 
Japan but because the staging of his 
works confronts the Japanese with major 
difficulties. When, however, a German 
opera company on tour presents a 
Wagner opera, all the tickets are snapped 
up immediately. More copies of the com- 
plete recording of The Ring have been 
sold in Japan than in any other country. 
Why does Wagner’s music appeal so 
strongly to the Japanese, when it is 
almost diametrically opposite in charac- 
ter to traditional Japanese art? An ex- 
planation is not easy to find, but since 
Bruckner’s music has won a following in 
Japan in the last few years perhaps the 
Japanese today are attracted by art which 
is totally different from their own. 
Much has been made of the extremely 
Germanic nature of Wagner’s music. I 
cannot fully appreciate this point of 
view, Myself I would tend rather to stress 
the extremely human nature of his music, 
its power to transcend frontiers and 
speak to mankind as a whole. 
Like the French, who have always lov- 
ed Wagner—and towards whom Wagner 
felt such hostility—the Japanese cannot 
resist the enchantment of his music.

March 14, 1883, is being commemorated by an un- 
precedented number of ceremonies in almost every 
country in the world. And at a time when, amid unabated sound 
and fury people everywhere are making assessments of what 
Henri Lefebvre called *’a body of thought become a world"’, it 
is perhaps opportune to point out that the works of this man,

GEORGES LABICA, French university teacher, is professor of 
philosophy at the University of Paris X Nanterre. He has published some 
20 studies on Marx and Marxism, notably Le Marxisme d’Aujourd’ hui 
(P.U.F., Paris, 1973) and Sur le Statut Marxiste de la Philosophie {Com- 
plexe/P.U.F., Brussels/Paris, 1976). He organized an international sym-

who wished to claim no country as his own, have not yet 
revealed all their mysteries nor spoken their last word. 
It is true that his was a singular destiny, a true adventure 
story whose climactic moments punctuated the history of his 
time, itself full of contradictions. 
First of all, Marx published comparatively little during his 
lifetime. After submitting his doctoral thesis in philosophy on 
The Difference Between the Natural Philosophies of 
Democritus and Epicurus, in 1840, at the age of twenty-two, 
he devoted himself to journalism, but his activities were cut 
short by the Prussian censors. In 1844, his two studies On the 
Jewish Question and Toward a Critique of Hegel's Philosophy 
of Right appeared in the first and only edition of the German- 
French Yearbooks. In 1847, The Poverty of Philosophy, a 
riposte to the French socialist thinker Pierre-Joseph Proudhon’s 
The Philosophy of Poverty, was published, and between 1848

and 1863, interspersed in a mass of articles, appeared Wage, 
Labour and Capital (1849), The Class Struggles in France 
(1850), The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte (1852), A 
Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy (1859) and 
Herr Vogt (1860). For the International Working Men's 
Association (The First International) Marx prepared the Address 
and the Provisional Rules of the International Working Men's 
Association (1864) and the Programme for the First Congress 
{1866), as well as The French Civil War (1871) in which he 
made an analysis of the Paris Commune. The first volume of 
Das Kapital appeared in 1867 and was followed by the prepara- 
tion of various prefaces to the second edition of The Com- 
munist Manifesto (1872) and to the second German edition of 
Das Kapital (1873), of the French translation of Das Kapital 
(1875), of the theoretical introduction to the programme of the 
French Workers’ Party (1880) and, finally, of the preface to the 
second Russian edition of The Communist Manifesto (1882). »

writings are indissociably linked with his, Marx published The 
Holy Family (1844), the Circular Against War (1855), The Com- 
munist Manifesto (1848) and a chapter of Anti-Diihring (1877). 
To these should be added a vast Correspondence (13 volumes 
in the German edition, 15 in the French edition now being 
published), little of which was made public at the time. 
In fact, many of Marx's writings were not known until after, 
in some cases long after, his death. The full story of the 
upheavals, both theoretical and practical, these unknown 
writings were to cause has yet to be written. To cite just a few 
examples, the second and third volumes of Das Kapital were 
published in 1885 and 1894 respectively, thanks to a mam- 
moth effort of editing by Engels; the Theories of Surplus Value, 
three volumes written between 1861 and 1863 and which 
together make up the fourth volume of Das Kapital, were 
published between 1905 and 1910 after editing by Karl Kaut- 
sky who succeeded Engels as Marx's literary executor; the Fun- 
damentals of Political Economy, the vast manuscript dating 
from 1857-1858, was not published until 1939-1941, 
Moreover, hitherto unpublished texts continue to appear; the 
mathematical manuscripts of Das Kapital still await scientific 
In collaboration, primarily with Friedrich Engels, whose. capitalist production system and social, political and ideological 
relationships as being some kind of natural fatality. 
The third is Leninism, whose definition gave rise, quite in- 
dependently of the will of its eponym, to heated debates which 
foreshadowed the revolution that came in the era of imperialism 
inthe “weak link’’ of Tsarist Russia. Stalinism was another, the 
most widespread and the most enduring. 
This is to say nothing of the other Marxisms, official, semi of- 
ficial or underground that, with little reference to the opinions 
of those concerned, have adopted the names of Rosa Luxem- 
burg, Leon Trotsky, Nikolai Bukharin or Antonio Gramsci, and 
to evoke only the leading voices of a choir whose ever increas- 
ing numbers, before our very eyes, are even now ceaselessly 
producing and thus reproducing the fecundity of the works of 
Marx. 
Furthermore, Marxism, whether that of its originator or that 
of his interpreters —and it is exceedingly difficult to make the 
distinction—is also, indeed perhaps mainly, the record of its 
grafts, or of its "‘fusion’’ as Lenin used to call it, with the 
workers’ movement within the context of each nation. Thus 
there is, as it were, a problem of translation, in every sense of 
the word. What is received? When? How? And from whom?

What conclusion can be drawn from this? This stirring body 
of writings, still vital, like so many revolutionary rockets—to 
use the words Marx himself employed in Das Kapital—has 
disturbed and will continue to disturb our century, despite the 
derisory litanies of those who continually declare that ‘Marx is 
dead’. 
But more than this, the singular destiny of this body of 
writings was made even more remarkable by being inextricably 
linked with the history of the international workers’ movement; 
it is to this history that it owes its constitution as a "‘corpus’’, 
a language claiming universality, in a word, as Marxism(s). 
New, criss-crossing roads to Compostella, whose story is slow- 
ly being pieced together again, found here their beginnings. "In 
my Father's house are many mansions..."’ 
Let us identify some of them, using the names that they have 
given themselves, sometimes unwillingly, for fear of being 
relegated to minor status. The first is the word ‘“Marxism’’ 
itself, which Marx and Engels, who found himself reluctantly 
obliged to employ it, both mistrusted, sensing in it the odour of 
dogma and of magister dixit. The second is the so-called {and 
well-called) ‘Marxism of the Second International’” which 
owes so much to Karl Kautsky, an economism which saw the 
20 
And in what political, economic, cultural and ideological cir- 
cumstances? Under what weight of tradition, thought and 
practice? In the heat of revolution or in the cold, calm setting 
of established institutions? Some simple examples — Gue de 
and Thorez ‘‘Frenchified’” Marxism, Labriola and Togliatti 
“Italianized’’ it and Mao Ze-Dong gave it a ‘Chinese accent”’, 
just as Lenin and Stalin ‘‘Russianized’’ it. What does this mean 
if not that the universal everywhere encounters indefeasible 
specificities to which it must adjust? 
But how? In dogmas, formulae, models, or in the handling of 
concrete situations? And by means of what adaptations? Is it 
not important in this regard to know how Das Kapital was com- 
prehended in Egypt or in Greece, or how The Communist 
Manifesto penetrated Turkey or Colombia? How was 
"“socialism’’ translated into Arabic or the dialectic adapted in 
China? Although we are aware of how Marx came to be known 
in Russia, from populism to the founding of social-democracy, 
can we claim to be equally knowledgeable about events in 
Belgium or Australia? Was the date of the invention of the term 
Marxism-Leninism entirely fortuitous? And what about the in- 
ception of the principle of juche [autonomy or identity] in 
Pyongyang—is it not just as interesting as the coming of 
Austro-Marxism or Eurocommunism? Why did the French and 
Spanish communist parties give up the concept of the dictator- 
ship of the proletariat? } 
Do they not all claim to be Marxist?

### 56331: Karl Marx, 1818-1883: many mansions

The task of finding the answers to these questions, minor and 
academic though they may appear, is nevertheless necessary 
to a proper assessment of our era. This work is already in hand 
and a great deal is at stake, dealing as it does with a century of 
class struggle in which Marx, in reading Hegel, saw the beginn- 
ings of a new life for humanity, and, more precisely, the ad- 
vance from pre-history to history, to the consciously-decided 
ordering of social relationships. 
But this is by no means all, since the chronological disarray 
in which Marx’s works became known raises other questions. 
The first concerns the way in which they are read and the 
reconstitution of a chain whose links have been scattered. In 
other words, if we want to be able to understand the evolution 
of Marx's thought, it is essential to place in the order in which 
they were written works such as On the Jewish Question, 
Toward a Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right, The Holy 
Family, the Theses on Feuerbach, the Circular Against War, 
The Poverty of Philosophy and The Communist Manifesto. It is 
also important to put back in their proper place in this progres- 
sion, as Marx himself suggested in one of the rare texts in 
which he speaks of his own evolution, not only the important 
letters he wrote to his father (1837), to Arnold Ruge 
(1842-1843), to Feuerbach (1843) and to Pavel Annenkov 
The philosophers have only interpreted the world; 
the point is to change if. 
Karl Marx 
(1846), and articles such as those on Communism and the 
Rheinische Zeitung {1842), on the winegrowers of the Moselle 
{1843), against Heinzen and Lamartine (1847), and the so- 
called Notebooks of Bonn (1842), of Paris (1844), of Brussels 
and Manchester (1845), but also the writings of Friedrich 
Engels which Marx himself declared to be indissociable from his 
own: first of all their Correspondence, the letters of Engels to 
the Graber brothers (1839), Frederick William IV (1842), the 
Progress of Reform on the Continent (1843), the Letters from 
London (1843), Outline of a Critique of Political Economy 
(1844) and The Condition of the Working Class in England 
. {1845), the two latter being works to which Marx constantly 
stressed his indebtedness. As for A Contribution to the Critique 
of Political Economy, how can it be excluded from any study of 
the research carried out by Marx starting from the period 
1867-1858 and continuing up to the unfinished chapter on 
Classes with which the third volume of Das Kapital concludes? 
In recent years we have seen what animated discussions, not 
only academic but also political, could arise from comparisons 
between the Fundamentals of the Critique of Political Economy 
and Das Kapital, and the polemics concerning Theories of 
Surplus Value and the Unpublished Chapter. 
And here we must ask another blunt question: have Marx's 
writings really been read? 
A further question also arises, to which reference has been 
made above, concerning the widely differing ways in which the 
works of Marx have been received. In the historical fate of his 
works, that is to say, in the successive or even rival ways in 
which they have been appropriated, there is a precise reflection 
of their chronological avatars. Is it not possible to climb into any 
carriage of this moving train and observe, jostling, confronting, 
even excommunicating each other, so many different forms of 
Marxism that they end by mixing up the labels with which we 
try to distinguish them—“*’University’’, ‘‘militant’’, ‘’national’’ 
of ““X'" and ““Y''? Each one is a revision, but of what dogma, 
of what law, of what doctrine? 
From all this there is something new to learn. May not Marx 
be unknown? And is it not precisely the function of the various 
Marxisms, if only in self-defence, to maintain indefinitely this 
ignorance of Marx by a continual process of covering up? Does 
not the response to the cry of ‘’betrayal’’, heard from every 
quarter, demand a “return to Marx’’, just as there have been 
demands for a ‘return to Kant’, or, with Nietzsche, a call to go 
“back to the Greeks’’? But the quest for areturn to a lost purity, 
apart from the fact that it is always illusory or naive, can be 
seen in this case to be an anachronism in direct contradiction 
with its purpose, that is to say, with Marxism as a theory of 
history, since the theory in question strictly forbids the leaving 
aside of this history, of its histdry. 
The last century provided a resounding proof of this: Marx- 
ism, the thinking or type of thinking originating with Marx, has 
entered the public domain. This means, above all, that it has no 
proprietor or authorized interpreter. ts terrain is our era in 
which all languages are spoken. Marxism has become public 
property —was not that its vocation? And, in the end, is not this 
the mark of its success? Is not the life of a work indissociable 
from its effects, even those it did not seek? 
Some decades ago Ernst Bloch suggested that in Marxism 
could be distinguished, as it were, two mixed streams of water, 
one ‘‘cold”’ and the other “’hot’’. The ’‘cold”’ stream cor- 
responds to the diagnosis of capitalist production relationships, 
a task it is more than ever necessary to pursue. To the ‘’hot’’ 
stream belongs ‘‘the powerful recourse to man humiliated, 
enslaved, neglected, vilified, and thus the recourse to the pro- 
letariat, seen as the setting of the upheaval that will lead to 
emancipation’’. On the one hand well-founded knowledge and 
its essential concepts, and on the other the “’New’’, the 
“"Hope’’, the *Utopia’’ so dear to Bloch. The guerillas of central 
America have certainly not read Das Kapital. Nonetheless they 
bear witness to that fire that is always in movement and which 
catches hold where least expected, to these uncodified Marx- 
isms that are erecting the Tower of Babel of our times, rejecting 
our semantics, in Africa, in Asia, in Latin America, everywhere, 
even among the well fed, everywhere that men and women 
continue to suffer whether in their bellies, their heads or their 
hearts. Did not the young Marx believe that philosophies, like 
mushrooms, were the fruit of their time? Did he not affirm that 
ideas, taken up by the masses, could become a material force? 
A hundred years later, this final lesson remains with us.

### 56332: A Driving force of human evolution

A driving force 
of human evolution 
by Nikolai Ivanovich Lapin 
of a profession is the welfare of mankind and our 
Y | T HE chief guide which must direct us in the choice 
own perfection. 
*“... If we have chosen the position in life in which we can 
most of all work for mankind, no burdens can bow us down, 
because they are sacrifices for the benefit of all; then we 
shall experience no petty, limited, selfish joy, but our hap- 
piness will belong to millions...”’ 
These were the words of Karl Marx, then a seventeen- 
year-old schoolboy whose graduation essay on a subject of 
his own choice already displayed an independence of 
thought and purposefulness of feeling. He would be true to 
this lofty humanistic ideal as long as he lived. 
Karl Heinrich Marx was born on May 5, 1818 in the old 
Prussian town of Trier, now in the Federal Republic of Ger- 
many. His father Heinrich Marx, a lawyer and a man of the 
Enlightenment, guided his son towards a career in law and, 
in October 1835, the young Karl Marx entered the Univer- 
sity of Bonn. His interest in philosophy was growing, and, 
in October 1836, with his father’s understanding ac- 
quiescence, he transferred to the University of Berlin where 
he could study both philosophy and law. 
Another mentor from whose advice the student Marx was 
to benefit was his father’s friend Baron von Westphalen, to 
whose daughter Jenny he was engaged and was to marry 
seven years later, in 1843. The Baron, a lover of the Greek 
classics and of Shakespeare and a follower of the French 
social reformer Saint-Simon, took a liking to the gifted 
young student who in turn expressed his gratitude and af- 
fection by dedicating to him his doctoral thesis on The Dif- 
ference Between the Natural Philosophies of Democritus 
and Epicurus. 
This early study by Marx, written from an idealistic, 
Young Hegelian standpoint, examined the duality of the in- 
terrelationship between philosophy and reality: philosophy 
actively influences the real world and transforms it accor- 
ding to its principles; but philosophy itself is subject to a 
reciprocal influence and itself becomes worldly. 
In April 1841, Marx received his diploma of Doctor of 
Philosophy and planned to give a series of lectures on logic 
at the University of Bonn. At this time, however, the Prus- 
sian Government, considering the Young Hegelians to he a 
subversive element, began to drive them from the univer- 
sities and Marx turned towards active political engagement. 
He began contributing to the newly-founded newspaper the 
Rheinische Zeitung which he succeeded in turning into an 
all-German rostrum of freedom and humanism. 
When, in October 1842 Marx became the editor of the 
newspaper, he was faced with writing articles on a number 
of complex practical questions that were quite new to him. 
His analysis of the debates in the Rheinlandtag on the law 
NIKOLA!I IVANOVICH LAPIN, is head of the philosophical and 
sociological studies department at the All-Union Research Institute for 
Systems Studies of the USSR Academy of Sciences, and Vice- 
President of the Soviet Sociological Association. He is the author of 
over 100 works on history, philosophy and sociology. Of his numerous 
works on Karl Marx, the most widely known is "Young Marx’’ 
(Moscow, 1968) which has been published in Russian, Bulgarian, 
Hungarian, Chinese, German, Moldavian, Slovak, Finnish and French 
editions.

prohibiting the taking of timber by the peasants from the 
forests and his sociological study of the status of the 
Moselle wine-growers convinced him that it was not the 
State that imposed its will on private interests, as 
postulated by Hegel and other idealists, but private interests 
that bent the State to their will. 
In March 1843, the Rheinische Zeitung was banned, all 
hope of a press free from censorship vanished, and Marx 
started looking for new, more effective ways of continuing 
the struggle. But first he decided, in his own words, to 
“retire to the classroom’’ in order to examine and con- 
solidate the theoretical foundations of his activities. He was 
turning more and more away from Hegelian idealism and in 
his study Toward a Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right, 
published in 1844, these doubts grew into a conscious 
orientation towards materialistic principles. 
In summer 1843, while living at Kreuznach, Marx under- 
took an analysis of world history ranging over the vast 
period from 600 BC to the French Revolution. He came to 
the conclusion that all historical processes were determined 
by changes in the nature of private property; it was this that 
exercised real influence on the State and not vice versa. For 
the State to express the true interests of the people private 
property would have to be abolished. 
At the same time Marx was developing his views concern- 
ing the ““essence of man’’. “The essence of a particular per- 
sonality, a particular man, is neither his beard, nor his blood, 
nor his physical quality, but his social character.”” 
In October 1843 Marx emigrated to Paris with his new 
bride, Jenny von Westphalen, and threw himself into the 
study of political economy, having come to the conclusion 
that the world was ruled not by ideas but by economic laws. 
From April to August 1844, working virtually non-stop, at 
times going for three or four nights in a row without sleep, 
he wrote his famous Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts 
which contained all the roots and elements of his world- 
embracing theory, a synthesis of his philosophic, economic 
and political view of the world. 
Comparative analysis of the three sources of income— 
wages, interest on capital and land rents—led Marx to the 
conclusion that the many contradictions in the society of his 
day, and first and foremost the antagonism between labour 
and capital, were generated by the ‘‘alienation of labour’’. 
Marx stressed the economic basis of this alienation: "The 
more wealth the worker produces the less he has to con- 
sume, and the more values he creates, the more his produc- 
tion increases, the more he devalues himself, The devalua- 
tion of the world of men is in proportion to the increasing 
value of the world of things... The object which labour 
produces —Ilabour’'s market product—confronts the worker 
as something alien, as a power independent of the 
producer.”’ 
Marx also attributed a wider meaning to “‘alienation’’, 
seeing it not only in work but also in political, spiritual and 
other spheres of social life. A new and genuinely humanistic 
society would abolish all forms of alienation and thus 
resolve the contradictions between man and man, man and 
nature, individuals and groups. The self-alienation of man 
would be overcome and a harmonious, whole new man 
would emerge.

### 56332: A Driving force of human evolution

These new ideas brought upon their author new repres- 
sion. Marx was exiled from France, in 1845, and moved to 
Brussels where he was joined shortly afterwards by 
Friedrich Engels. Here they wrote The German Ideology in 
which they criticized abstract idealistic concepts of man. 
While writing it Marx made one of his great discoveries; he 
showed that each stage of social evolution was characteriz- 
ed primarily by a certain mode of production of material 
goods. His views on the dialectics of productive forces and 
the interactions of production as the source of the auto- 
development of history, as well as on socio-economic 
systems and their changes at important, successive stages, 
became the basis of the materialistic view of history. 
The basic principles formulated by Marx and Engels in the 
Communist Manifesto were put to the test in the crucible of 
the European revolutions of 1848-1849. But this did not 
mean that the development of these principles was com- 
plete. The main problem that Marx was trying to solve in 
London, where he had moved in 1849 and where he was to 
remain to the end of his days, was how to explain the pro- 
cess of the creation of surplus value, that is, how a certain 
additional product appropriated by the capitalist emerges on 
the basis of the theory of value, i.e. the theory of equivalent 
exchange between the workers and the capitalists. 
In the process of solving this problem Marx discovered 
that labour is a special kind of commodity which costs the 
employer much less than the value of goods it creates. 
Employing a worker, the capitalist purchases his labour 
power and, being the owner of the means of production, he 
provides for such use of this labour power that the value 
created by it is higher than its own value, in other words, it 
ensures that a surplus value is obtained without violating 
the theory of value. 
Marx's discoveries in economics came as a result of hard 
work carried out in the most difficult conditions. Yet not all 
his manuscripts were published during his lifetime. Ten 
years were to elapse between the production of the great 
manuscript of 1857-1858 and the publication in 1867 of 
the first volume of Das Kapital. In the meantime, from 
1861-1865, Marx produced two huge revised variants — 
clear evidence of his conscientious scientific approach. The 
second and third volumes of Das Kapital were prepared and 
published (in 1885 and 1894 respectively) by his friend and 
comrade Friedrich Engels; the fourth volume was published 
in 1905 after Engels’ death. 
Das Kapital was the great original, seminal work of Marx's 
life, taking account of the whole preceding history of 
economic thought and subjecting a mountain of facts to 
theoretical analysis. It contains a detailed examination of 
the particular mechanisms of the links between the socio- 
economic structure of society and production under the 
capitalist system whose tendency towards revolutionary 
transformation into a new and more progressive system it 
reveals. 
Some concepts seem to be less in evidence or to have 
  
been modified, but this does not mean that Marx had aban- 
doned them. In Das Kapital and other studies, for instance, 
he consistently employs ‘’alienation’’ as a philosophic no- 
tion. Generally speaking, Das Kapital has not only an 
economic but also a wide-ranging philosophic, 
methodological and humanistic content. The discovery of 
the materialistic interpretation of the history of mankind and 
the creation of the theory of surplus value brought about a 
revolution in social thinking and made of socialism a science 
rather than a utopian dream. 
Right up to the end of his life Marx worked intensively, 
finding new horizons of creative thought. His Chronological 
Notes on world history and on the history of specific coun- 
tries (India, Italy, United Kingdom, Russia, etc.), compiled in 
the period 1880-1882, totalled over two thousand printed 
pages. The idea behind their compilation is still a mystery, 
but the most plausible hypothesis seems to be that of the 
Soviet scientist B.F. Porshnev who believed that at the time 
Marx was interested in the problem of the interconnexions 
between the parallel histories of different countries. 
While working on Das Kapital Marx had concentrated on 
the study of one particular socio-economic system; next he 
turned his attention to the problems of the interaction of dif- 
ferent systems existing simultaneously and to the problem 
of the common aspects and contradictions of economic, 
socio-political and spiritual processes which take place 
within the context of humanity as a whole. His aim was to 
achieve a global picture of a world in which many societies 
co-exist and influence one another in all the main aspects of 
their activities. The significance of this design has been con- 
firmed by modern researchers studying global problems. 
Marx did not live to implement this great design. Ex- 
hausted by illness and depressed by the loss of his wife and 
his daughter, he died quietly in his armchair on March 14, 
1883. 
For hundreds of years mankind had been seeking ways of 
achieving a just restructuring of a society which would be 
free from exploitation, violence and material and spiritual 
poverty. Many daring ideas had been put forward during the 
course of history but few of them had succeeded in captur- 
ing the imagination of millions and becoming a driving force 
affecting the evolution of human civilization. The theory of 
Karl Marx ranks among the latter, incorporating as it does a 
whole range of philosophic, economic and political con- 
cepts that gave people something they had never had 
before —a proper understanding of themselves and, conse- 
quently, of the way to emancipation. 
Marx provided answers to fundamental problems that had 
been raised by progressive human thought. He had 
assimilated the best of German classical philosophy, English 
political economy and French utopian socialism, but he 
drastically revised each of these fields of thought, syn- 
thesizing them into a qualitatively new entity —a scientific 
world outlook which has emerged as a specific socio- 
cultural phenomenon of modern human history.

The Lebanese writer, mystic poet and thinker Gibran Khalil Gibran (1883-1931) also painted in an allegorical style close to that 
of William Blake. Influenced by Nietzsche, he attempted to use the will to power for the improvement of man in accordance 
with the precepts of Christ and of Oriental sages. In his many works written in Arabic and English he proclaimed himself a 
citizen of the world. His spiritualistic work The Prophet (1923) was a best-seller in the United States and has been translated 
into 34 languages. Above, a self-portrait by Gibran.

### 56335: Gibran Khalil Gibran, 1883-1931: a voyage and a vision

GIBRAN KHALIL GIBRAN (1883-1931) 
A voyage 
and a vision 
IBRAN Khalil Gibran (1883- 
G 1921) left Lebanon for the 
United States in 1895 when he 
was twelve years old, but three years 
later he returned to Beirut to study 
Arabic. Thus 1903, the year in which he 
went back to Boston, may be regarded 
as the date when he began nearly a 
lifetime’s residence in North America, 
where he divided his time between his 
studio in New York and his sister’s 
house in Boston. Gibran thus spent the 
first three decades of the twentieth cen- 
tury in one of the world’s major centres 
of ““modern culture’, far away from 
his native land, itself a major world 
centre of ‘‘traditional culture’, 
Gibran’s emigration to the west was 
not due to personal or family reasons. 
It was part of a larger, more general 
movement in which Syrians and 
Lebanese migrated to Egypt and to the 
Americas, fleeing from the appalling 
conditions resulting from the decline of 
the Ottoman Empire around the end of 
the last century. The origins of this 
wave of migration lay in the suppres- 
sion of freedom of expression and 
belief and in the series of famines, 
epidemics wars and earthquakes that 
ravaged th Levant at the turn of the 
century. 
In earlier days successive waves of 
migration had been motivated by trade 
and the other maritime activities for 
which the people of Phoenicia had been 
famous since ancient times. The novel 
feature of the migration at the turn of 
the century was that the migrants 
associated trading interests with 
cultural aims. These Lebanese and 
Syrian émigrés laid the foundations of 
culture, journalism and the arts in 
Egypt, establishing publishing houses, 
theatres, cinemas and newspapers. The 
same phenomenon occurred, to vary-

ing degrees, in North and South 
America. Gibran himself tried his hand 
at business, alternately making and los- 
ing money, while Mikhayil N’aimi, as 
he confesses in his book on Gibran, 
worked as a commercial representative. 
Thus it was the quest for freedom of 
intellectual expression and economic 
opportunity that drove the intelligent- 
sia of the Arab East to migrate in suc- 
cessive waves either to Egypt or to 
South and North America. All these 
men and women combined the trade of 
journalist, writer or artist with that of 
dealer in stocks and bonds. Trade, art 
and politics almost always went 
together in their lives and only in rare 
cases did one take precedence over the 
others. Gibran Khalil Gibran was one 
of those rare cases. 
Gibran’s life and works present a 
number of distinctive geatures. First of 
all, he was fully a child of his times. 
The first three decades of the twentieth 
century set the tone for the new age 
which Gibran did not live to see. It was 
a time of wholesale destruction that 
was also marked by an upsurge of ac- 
tivity in culture, art and science and by 
an attempt to experiment with vi- 
sionary ideas that had risen from the 
ruins. These were the decades of the 
First World War, the first socialist 
revolution, the birth of Nietzscheanism 
and the spread of Freudianism. All 
these unprecedented occurrences had a 
strong influence on sculpture, poetry, 
painting, the novel and the theatre, 
shattering old forms and dictating new 
subject-matter. 
Gibran was immersed in his epoch, 
an actor not a spectator. His migration 
from Mount Lebanon to Boston may 
be seen as the journey of a prophet.»

Gibran expressed himself with equal facility in Arabic and English. Above, a frag- 
ment from his ‘Notebooks’. 
» When the Ottomans began their 
slaughtering in the Levant, all the in- 
telligentsia of Syria (which then includ- 
ed the whole of the Fertile Crescent 
region) fled. For Gibran and a few 
others, the goal was a spiritual one. For 
them migration was a stage which 
would necessarily be followed by a 
return to the homeland. They did not 
go in search of refuge, exile, trade or 
money, but in search of a vision, 
following a circular path that necessari- 
ly ended where it began. 
The second feature that epitomizes 
the life and works of Gibran is that 
while he lived at a geographical 
distance from his native land, he main- 
tained close links with it and with its 
history. Although distant from 
Lebanon, he was always strongly in- 
fluenced by émigré Arab culture and 
the Arabic press, and remained in cons- 
tant communication with his 
homeland. Geographical distance gave 
him a broader and deeper insight into 
The earth is my homeland and 
humanity is my family. 
Gibran 
 
his country and enabled him more 
swiftly and more perceptively to iden- 
tify its misfortunes and see where the 
remedies might lie. Thus the essential 
feature of his migration was that it took 
him both away from and back to his 
homeland; it was a temporary measure 
to enable him to trace the lineaments of 
his prophetic message, not to arm 
himself with a residence permit. Hence 
26 
Gibran’s ‘“‘modernity’’ was the reverse 
side of his deep-rooted cultural identi- 
ty; his migration was at once an inward 
and an outward journey. 
Gibran’s greatest creative achieve- 
ment was, then, his own life within 
whose short span—he was only forty- 
eight years old when he died—the 
public and private dimensions were in- 
distinguishable. His views on women, 
marriage and the clergy were not simp- 
ly theoretical standpoints expressed in 
his writings and drawings but 
represented his practical views on life, 
love and religion. More than half a cen- 
tury after the death of Gibran we are 
beginning to understand the major im- 
portance of his book The Prophet 
(1923); we should not, however, fail to 
recognize the equal importance of his 
work Jesus, the Son of Man. In fact, 
the key to Gibran’s works lies in his at- 
titude towards authority, whether 
represented by established tradition, 
prevailing convention, religious institu- 
tion, social structure, economic system 
or foreign occupying power. 
The ‘““movement’’ that grew out of 
Gibran’s life and art (drawing, painting 
and writing) was clearly founded by a 
man possessed of prophetic vision. 
And his founding of the ‘‘Pen 
League’’, his defence of his country 
against the Ottomans, his long dedica- 
tion to art in his New York studio and 
to literature in a secluded house in 
Boston were for him indissociable ac- 
tivities. His metrical verse and his free 
verse, his narrative prose and 
dialogues, plays and novels, all served 
that one vision. The forms these 
writings took grew naturally out of 
 
I am a traveller and a navigator, 
and each day I discover a new 
country in my soul, My friend, 
you and I will live as strangers to 
this life, strangers to one another 
and to ourselves, until the day 
when you will speak and I will 
listen to you believing that your 
voice is mine, until the day when 
I shall stand before you, thinking 
that I am before a mirror. 
Gibran 
their subject-matter, for Gibran did 
not set out deliberately to modernize 
poetry and language. His constant con- 
cern, once he had discovered his life’s 
mission, was to express his ‘‘vision”’. 
Was Gibran a Romantic when he 
wrote A Tear and a Smile? Did he 
become a symbolist with The Madman, 
The Forerunner and The Wanderer? 
Was he a philosopher in The Prophet, 
The Garden of the Prophet and The 
Earth Gods and a novelist in Spirits 
Rebellious and Broken Wings? 
Gibran’s life and death, his writings 
and works of visual art defy such 
classification to which, moreover, he 
was opposed throughout his life. He 
fought against all forms of pigeon- 
holing, against all that would strait- 
jacket thoughts and feelings. 
Throughout his spiritual journey, 
Gibran Khalil Gibran remained true to 
his vision and through his art and 
writings in the first three decades of this 
century he proclaimed his prophetic 
message.

### 56336: Franz Kafka, 1883-1924: the devil's pay

FRANZ KAFKA (1883-1924) 
The devil’s pay 
a hundred years ago, on 3 July 
1883. Portraits and photos of him 
until just before he died, ravaged by con- 
sumption, on 3 June 1924 show an eter- 
nal adolescent—just as Lautréamont and 
Rimbaud remained adolescent. There are 
authors who do not age, and works 
which, from the moment they are writ- 
ten, rush forward in time so that a cen- 
tury or more later we still breathlessly try 
to catch up with them. The Penal Settle- 
ment, The Trial and The Castle are 
stories we have known—we read about 
them in the newspaper only this 
morning—and, alas, they still presage the 
future. In the last fifty years since 
Kafka’s work, most of which was 
published posthumously, has come to 
light, how many times has its author been 
hailed as a saint and prophet? Today 
does he not possess one of the common 
characteristics of the prophet, namely 
that he is (officially) not without honour 
save in his own country? 
He was nothing if not a man of 
Prague, the city where he was born and is 
buried. He was more a man of Prague 
than he was Jewish (although he was 
born a Jew) or German (although his 
Fw Kafka was born in Prague 
  
MAURICE NADEAU, French man of letters, 
has been publisher and editor-in-chief of the 
literary magazine La Quinzaine Littéraire since 
1966, and publisher of Lettres Nouvelles 
since 1953. Notable among his published 
works are Histoire du Surréalisme (71945), Le 
Roman Francais depuis la Guerre {new edition 
1969), and Gustave Flaubert, Ecrivain (1369). 
by Maurice Nadeau 
writings are an adornment of German 
literature). Fundamentally neither 
Jewish, nor Czech, nor German, or else 
all three at once, he belonged to no 
category which would enclose him within 
a people, a nation (or the conglomerate 
of nations which comprised the Austro- 
Hungarian empire) or a confession. A 
member of the German Jewish minority 
which engaged in trade and sent its 
children to the Gymnasium, he found 
himself at that intersection of space and 
time where his family happened to live, 
where he worked in an insurance office, 
and where his grave is today. Look at his 
contemporaries: the superabundantly 
Czech Jaroslav Hasek, the undeniably 
Austrian Franz Werfel, the militant Jew 
Max Brod. It is as if they all insisted on 
affiliation to a community. Kafka was 
his own man, If he immersed himself in 
Hebrew towards the end of his life, 
perhaps it was because he felt that he was 
so little a Jew. His German is sometimes 
the German of the ghetto and sometimes 
a German that can be traced directly back 
to Goethe. There is nothing in common 
with the expressionists of Vienna or 
Berlin. What other literary influences 
helped to shape him? Flaubert and 
Dickens, a Frenchman and an 
Englishman. 
Shortly after meeting Max Brod, the 
faithful friend (whose loyalty went so far 
as the act of betrayal which brought 
Kafka posthumous fame) Kafka tried to 
collaborate with him in writing a novel. 
Little came of it. However, the Descrip- 
tion of a Struggle (1905) and Prepara- 
tions for a Country Wedding (1907), in 
between which a doctorate in’ 
jurisprudence had led to a position as the 
conscientious and efficient employee of a 
workers’ insurance company, are already 
pure Kafka—what Sartre would call for- 
ty years later ‘‘a universe both fantastic 
and rigorously true.’’ In fact, and this 
would only be realized later, Kafka was 
writing in a new way. 
But only on condition that he had the 
time and the material conditions in which 
he could write. Perhaps, as many com- 
mentators insisted after his death, the 
drama of Kafka’s life was metaphysical. 
First and foremost, however, it was 
physical: the drama of someone who car- 
ries within himself a world which he can- 
not bring to birth, trapped as he is bet- 
ween two swing doors in his room in the 
family home, and, during the day, in his 
office at the ‘Workers’ Accident In- 
surance’. He can only indulge his vice, 
his reason for living, when all is asleep. 
Short descriptions, suddenly interrupted, 
a gesture captured in an instant, unusual 
and fleeting situations—these are the in- 
gredients of Kafka’s Diaries, interspers- 
ed with outbursts of rage at the short 
span of time at his disposal, complaints 
about the task he feels entrusted to per- 
form and cannot, and those constant, ap- 
palling headaches. The monotony is 
deadly. With a headstrong passion he 
takes an interest in a troupe of Yiddish 
actors and in its director Jizschak Lowy. 
After holidaying with Kafka on the 
Italian lakes, Max Brod makes him col- 
lect the texts of his first book Medita- 
tions, which would appear in December 
1912. 
Franz Kafka (1883-1924) was born and buried in Prague. Below, panorama of towers over the Moldau River, 
Prague. In foreground, the Klementinum, a former Jesuit college and university, with its church, library and (far 
left) astronomical tower.

1912 was the crucial year. In January 
he drafted the first chapters of The Man 
who Disappeared, which would later 
become America. While staying with 
Max Brod in August, he met Felice 
Bauer, his future fiancée. During the 
night of 22-23 September he wrote The 
Judgment at a single sitting. In 
November and December he wrote 
Metamorphosis. 
In The Man who Disappeared he ad- 
mitted that he had unconsciously 
plagiarized Dickens. The “‘fiancée’’ was 
the woman he wished to marry and could 
not bring himself to marry. One of the 
dramas of his life, this engagement would 
last until the final break came in 1917. 
But before that it would be broken off, 
then be renewed again, and he would 
carry on a 500-letter correspondence, an 
astonishing psychological document 
 


### 56336: Franz Kafka, 1883-1924: the devil's pay

If the book we are reading does 
not awaken us with a punch on 
the skull, what’s the good of 
reading it? 
Kafka 
  
which shows him oscillating between 
commitment and withdrawal, between 
the desire to create a family in order to 
enter fully into life, and the rejection of 
the life of a petty bourgeois. And all the 
time, looming in the background, is the 
even greater fear that ‘‘the other’’ will in- 
terfere in what is most important to the 
writer, his most precious occupation. 
After writing The Judgment in a single 
night, Kafka expressed his jubilation in 
these words: ‘‘The fearful strain and joy, 
how the story developed before me, as if 
I were advancing over water... How 
28 
everything can be said, how for 
everything, for the strangest fancies, 
there waits a great fire in which they 
perish and rise up again... Only in this 
way can writing be done, only with such 
coherence, with such a complete opening 
out of the body and the soul. ‘‘Here can 
be heard the voice of the young Flaubert, 
who used almost identical words in his 
letters. Flaubert, whose Sentimental 
Education Kafka always had with him 
and passages of which he knew by heart. 
Writing can be a godlike activity or a 
devilish one, Kafka talks of plunging into 
‘‘the underworld”, of conjuring forth 
“phantoms” and ‘‘demons’’, of 
shadowy indulgence in guilty activities, 
of living in the anguish of having 
penetrated once and for all the 
“nothingness”’ of life. ‘“The point of 
view of art and the point of view of life 
are different even in the artist’’, he wrote 
in Preparations for a Wedding. Like 
Flaubert he knew that art is not life but 
‘‘a place where, in the dark void, without 
foreknowledge, the rays of light can be 
powerfully intercepted.” These rays 
make it possible to reveal the ‘‘truth” 
around which art flies ‘‘with the set pur- 
pose of not burning itself.”” Were it to 
burn itself there it would be extinguished 
in the common reality, whereas what 
must be done is to open reality to its own 
potentiality, to ‘‘deliver’’ reality of what 
it carries obscurely within itself. The 
writer lives vicariously and in a state of 
anticipation. The empty page is his 
battlefield. 
Judging from comments which have 
been made on the occasion of the 
centenary of his birth, this image of 
Kafka as a writer and nothing else is tend- 
ing to become the new stereotype of the 
author of The Trial. Perhaps it is more 
accurate than the previous ones: Max

altogether frivolously, whether he should

writer, the Kafka who noted in his diary 
the famous sentence ‘‘All that is not 
literature bores me and I hate it”’, is the 
most acceptable effigy of all. But what 
kind of a writer was he? In what sense 
was he different from other writers? 
The French critics Maurice Blanchot 
and Jean Starobinski have said that the 
difference lies in the fact that Kafka is 
himself the material of his novels. Even 
his characters are so much his other 
selves that they are identified by the in- 
itial of his name or, like Samsa in 
Metamorphosis, by a name related to it 
in some way. Furthermore, their torment 
is his, even more than the feeling of guilt 
which nags at them, the search for the 
transgression for which they are being 
punished. If the punishment is to be 
‘“‘slaughtered like a dog’’ or changed into 
a beetle (or a monkey, or a mouse), the 
  
  
ho ps 
transgression must be unatonable, 
perhaps sacrilegious, a serious attack on 
the order of things. This is what he wrote 
to Max Brod about literary creation: 
“Last night I saw clearly, with the 
distinctness of a childhood object lesson, 
that it is pay for serving the devil. This 
descent towards dark forces, this 
unleashing of spirits naturally bound, 
these dubious embraces, and everything 
‘that can happen down below and which is 
unknown above, when one writes these 
stories in the sun...” This “‘devil’s pay’, 
a ‘“‘sweet and marvelous reward’’, does 
not redeem the transgression, which gives 
rise to fear and remorse. “Terrible fear 
of death’. Not, says Kafka, because it 
would end my life but because it would 
prevent me from acceding to life ‘‘since I 
have not yet lived.” A terrible confes- 
sion. ‘““Why,’’ he asks again, ‘‘is the final 
  
  
 
‘Panorama of my existence’’ is the title Kafka gave to this card he drew in 1918 and 
sent to his younger sister Ottla, the only person apart from his friend and biographer 
Max Brod from whom he had no secrets. 
   
Manuscript page from 
Kafka’s Diary for 1910. 
The text reads: *’'l write 
this very decidedly out 
of despair over my 
body and over a future 
with this body. 
“When despair shows 
itself so definitely, is so 
tied to its object, so 
pent up, as in a soldier 
who covers a retreat 
and thus lets himself be 
torn to pieces, thenitis 
not true despair. True 
despair overreaches its 
goal immediately and 
always, (at this comma 
it became clear that on- 
ly the first sentence 
was correct).”’   
word always: ‘I could live and I do not 
live’? 
This incapacity to be born in the world, 
this fate of someone who does not live, a 
zombie, lead to despair but do not con- 
ceal the cardinal sin from him who has 
reached the limits of extreme lucidity: “I 
have not redeemed myself through 
literature... What I have played at is real- 
ly going to happen.’ Joseph K., executed 
on a patch of waste ground, is a victim of 
this tragic ‘‘game’’, which will have no 
end for the land surveyor in The Castle. 
Kafka, writes Starobinski, is 
simultaneously ‘‘the object of his cre- 
ation” and ‘‘the object of his destruc- 
tion’’. His work bears within itself its 
own extinction. It consumes itself as it 
burns, in unfulfilment, and perhaps this 
is why Kafka did not wish it to survive 
him. It is like the machine in The Penal 
Men are bound together by ropes, 
and it’s a bad thing even when the 
ropes loosen around someone 
and he falls into the void a little 
below the others, but when the 
ropes snap and he falls totally, it 
is horrible. That is why we should 
hold each to the other.

Settlement which collapses when it in- 
scribes the fatal sentence on the skin of 
the man who usually handles it and who 
has offered himself to torture. 
How can this body of work whose 
material is its author and which is 
nourished by his fantasms and his tor- 
ment render such a precise, glowing im- 
age, so clear-cut in its horror, of the 
world in which we live? Of Auschwitz, 
the totalitarian bureaucracies, everything 
which systematically destroys the human 
in man? This aspect of Kafka’s work— 
the diagnosis it makes of our universe— 
has received too much attention for there 
to be any need to return to it here. Kafka 
says that the force of literature derives 
from its nature as an ‘‘observation-act’’, 
that is, ““observation of a superior kind... 
which obeys the laws of its own move- 
ment.”’ Movement which mingles, which 
should succeed in mingling, with the very 
movement of the writing—as long as they 
both transgress their bound: as long as 
(in the words of the Diaries} an assault 
on the frontiers’ is carried out. Then 
comes the moment when, thanks to an 
unassailable dialectic, and through a 
rigorous form of language, a world 
begins to unfold. It is either 
transcendental, nor ‘‘realisti nor 
“different’’, but it is neve ‘heless 
“something else” just as the X-ray photo 
of a body is not the same thing as the 
body which has been pierced by the X- 
rays; with its dark areas (its unsaid) and 
its lines of force finally visible. Kafka 
sees just as clearly into himself as nto the 
reality around him, even into thc reality 
gestating in everyday life. It is this lucidi-

### 56338: The United Nations University

  
~The 
United Nations 
University 
The United Nations University (UNU) was 
established by the General Assembly of the 
United Nations in 1972 and began operations 
from its headquarters in Tokyo in 1975. Since 
September 1980 the UNU’s Rector has been 
Soedjatmoko, an Indonesian scholar in the field 
of international development and politics. Inter- 
viewed for the Unesco Courier by Gérard 
Viratelle {of the Paris daily Le Monde) and Rana 
Gauhar (of Third World Quarterly, London) he 
discusses the UNU’s aims, activities and 
prospects. 
Gérard Viratelle: There are already several research in- 
stitutions in the United Nations system. Why was the UN 
University created? 
Soedjatmoko: The major characteristic of the United Na- 
tions University is that it is not an intergovernmental 
body. Non-governmental organizations have greater 
freedom to study problems and to come up with findings 
without taking into account governmental sensitivities. 
Many UN institutions, before they publish reports, have 
to check those reports with Governments. We don't 
have this obligation. Take, for instance, international 
economic problems. The International Monetary Fund 
and the World Bank combined have the largest research 
capability in the world on international economic issues. 
Still, there are several problems that they have not in- 
vestigated. Why? Because they are too sensitive for 
Governments. We feel therefore that the UN University 
has an obligation, forinstance, to look at global economic 
policy problems, especially at the kind of problems that 
other intergovernmental agencies have difficulties handl- 
ing. There is an important role for such a non- 
governmental body. 
Rana Gauhar: What are your hopes for the World Institute 
for Development Economics Research which the Univer- 
sity is planning to set up? 
Soedjatmoko: First, | think that the current recession has 
made it very clear that it is no longer possible to think of 
development only within the isolation of a single nation- 
State. The development theory must be revised to take 
into account international factors. At the same time, the 
impact of national developmental policies on the interna- 
tional system has not been adequately studied. The 
whole bank problem is an example of that. 
There is also a dearth of study of which development 
policies have succeeded and which have not, and why. 
The search for more effective development theories 
would be helped very much by independent assessments 
of which policies have worked and why and which 
policies have not worked and why. 
Then there is the question of the workings of the inter- 
national economic system. The capacity of the world to 
move more effectively in international development is 
constrained by the malfunctioning of the international 
system. These problems arising from the crisis of the in- 
ternational economic system should be looked at. It 
would be very important for an independent institution to 
do research on issues of particular relevance to the Third 
World, without becoming partisan in the sense of taking 
sides. We are a UN institution and we have to serve the 
needs of all mankind, but we also have a commitment to 
redress the disparities in the world. There is a need for 
that kind of research, and | intend that this new institu- 
tion should do it. 
Viratelle: Is there not a kind of rivalry between UNU and 
some other UN institutions? How is the co-ordination 
done? 
Human and Social Development and Co-existence of Peoples, Cultures and Social Systems is 
one of the five broad themes or *’problem areas’’ which form the framework for UN University 
research programmes and projects. Migration within and across national boundaries by migrant 
workers and refugees from war, famine and other disasters poses a major problem and over 
the coming decades will change the ethnic and cultural composition of many countries and in- 
crease social tensions. Below, on the march in the high plateau near Tug Wajale, in north- 
western Somalia.

Soedjatmoko: | don’t think it is a problem. We are too 
small to be a threat to anyone, and fortunately so. We try 
to co-ordinate. We join all kinds of co-ordinating 
meetings, but that is not the important thing. More im- 
portant than co-ordination is collaboration and we try to 
collaborate with larger United Nations agencies in 
specific areas. With Unesco we have a number of col- 
laborative projects in the areas of communications and 
the social sciences. Inthe area of development theory we 
have collaborative projects with other UN agencies. | am

is good, it keeps everyone on his toes, and as long as it 
leads to better quality it is fine. 
Gauhar: Let's talk about the University’s Charter and the 
autonomy which is written into it. As each of your pro- 
jects develops further—for instance the one on human 
nutritional requirements and malnutrition —you are going 
to come closer and closer to political questions. At what 
stage do you think you will need this academic freedom 
when your projects get past collecting data and actually 
point fingers at very unpleasant truths? 
Soedjatmoko: | believe it is the legitimate task of the 
social sciences and the policy sciences to study and 
make recommendations as to what kind of food policies 
in a given situation might be the best to ensure that the 
poorest of the poor get as much nutritional value as 
possible. If there are Governments which take exception 
to this, then we have a problem. But | don’t expect the 
problem to arise. Many Governments run into food policy 
difficulties, not because they want to but because they 
have generally been looking at the supply side of food 
and not at the consumption side. So my own experience 
is that Governments are first rather surprised, then rather 
pleased, that somebody is suggesting ways of making 
sure that the poor get more value out of their purchasing 
power. Of course, at some point one has to deal with the 
fact that purchasing power is not enough and then one 
will have to suggest policies. | believe it is the task of the 
United Nations University to make recommendations 
that are comprehensive and that pay special attention to

the weakest and poorest in our societies. | think that this 
is an obligation. | don’t really expect any problems in 
terms of academic freedom. 
Viratelle: How is the Rector of the University chosen? 
Since you have a governing Council what freedom of ac- 
tion do you have? 
Soedjatmoko: First, the Secretary-General of the UN and 
the Director-General of Unesco agree on the appointment 
of the Rector from a list of nominations from various 
sources. Once the Rector is appointed, he is a member of 
the governing Council. The Rector is the chief Academic 
and Administrative Officer, so the selection of research 
topics, the direction of the research and the selection of 
people is very much his responsibility —always, of 
course, in consultation with the Council. The Council ap- 
proves the budget and by doing so has its say on the pro- 
posals submitted by the Rector. 
In institutional terms, the academic freedom and 
autonomy of the University which we have talked about 
is based on the Endowment Fund, the income from which 
it is the University’s responsibility alone to manage. 
Viratelle: How are the developing countries participating 
in your work and what can they expect from it? 
Soedjatmoko: It was the vote of the developing countries 
that pushed the resolution for the establishment of the 
UN University through the General Assembly in 1972. If 
you disregard the contribution of Japan, more than 50 
per cent of the remaining contributions come from the 
Third World.

» Viratelle: What do they get for it? 
Soedjatmoko: Our research is primarily meant to con- 
tribute to knowledge that is of use to developing coun- 
tries in their development process. We are also providing 
training designed to strengthen Third World institutions. 
We are currently exploring the establishment of an Inter- 
national Institute for Natural Resources in Africa. This 
would help strengthen local institutions that deal with 
the various dimensions of the resource problem but don’t 
have the desirable concentration of expertise. 
Viratelle: You don’t have any student body, but you 
undertake training through fellowships? 
Soedjatmoko: Yes, our Fellows are post-graduates in 
developing countries. Many of these young scholars are 
isolated. Itis our task to help identify them and give them 
an opportunity to develop, particularly through inter- 
disciplinary training, and go back to their countries with 
their skills reinforced. Our Fellowship programme is being 
strengthened and developed and | think it makes a 
valuable contribution to building Third World institutions 
through relevant advanced training for Third World 
scholars and researchers. 
Then we are also concerned with improving the 
dissemination of scientific information. This is one of the 
reasons why we have established a new division, the 
Global Learning Division, because it is very obvious that 
even the available scientific knowledge does not reach 
the people who need that knowledge. There are many 
reasons why this knowledge does not reach them and we

want to have a more systematic look at that problem. To 
take one example: as world population increases, more 
and more people will have to move from the lowlands to 
the uplands. Upland agriculture is usually done on 
marginal land, land that is less fertile, with thin top soil, 
and so on. Now if you increase the number of people liv- 
ing on that top soil, it will go beyond the ecological carry- 
ing capacity. You can increase the carrying capacity only 
through the application of scientific knowledge and 
32 
through different social arrangements. There is no way 
of bringing that about unless that scientific knowledge 
reaches the peasants. This is one of the major world 
problems, in my opinion. 
Gauhar: Do you feel it is important for peasants 
everywhere to know or to share in the experience of 
peasants in other regions that will be helpful to them? Is 
this something which you plan to do in the future, or is 
the UNU already doing it?

### 56338: The United Nations University

HERE ae 
Soedjatmoko: We are at present engaged in activities 
along these lines. For instance, we have started on a 
village video network activity. The idea is to see whether 
itis possible for villagers to talk to other villagers without 
interlocutors. In the field of rural energy systems we have 
asked villagers in China to put themselves on video tapes 
to explain why they have decided to have biogas and 
bioconversion systems which created an integrated rural 
energy system that has brought them considerable pro- 
sperity. Then they made a second video tape that show- 
ed the technology they developed. This is now being 
adapted and shown in other places, in other villages, in 
other countries, as well as in China itself. My main in- 
terest in developing this video programme is to transfer, 
not technology, but hope; to show villagers, who have 
been bludgeoned into passivity for many centuries either 
by feudal lords or by the colonial régimes or later on by 
military régimes, that it is possible for villagers to do 
something for themselves. That, | think, is the most im- 
portant message that we could help bring, by simply 
showing that there are villages that have made a success 
of things. 
There are many local success stories in the Third 
World, which are not known. The thing is to eliminate 
both the urban interlocutor of your own nationality and 
the foreign interlocutor, and let villagers talk about 
themselves and their achievements to other villagers. 
Gauhar: | hate to inject a note of pessimism, but whether 
you are thinking of transferring technology or hope to 
peasants don’t you have to by-pass the very people you 
mentioned earlier, the military or landlords, or the urban 
interlocutor? 
Soedjatmoko: Yes. A medium like video has multipur- 
pose functions because we have found that there are 
Governments which are interested in showing their tapes 
as teaching material for their own civil servants. 
Gauhar: It creates a greater consciousness? 
Soedjatmoko: Yes. Alot of what we perceive as suppres- 
sion arises from ignorance rather than malice. | think that 
one of the major problems that has led to violence and op- 
pression has not been any philosophical commitment to 
it, but an incapacity to manage social transformations. 
 
Gauhar: Wherever there is change, there is potential for 
conflict. Are you saying that it is not necessary that 
change will come about violently and that violence is in 
fact a kind of mismanagement? 
Soedjatmoko: | did not say that. | did not say that it is 
possible to eliminate violence completely. The University 
is studying the problem of the violence that accompanies 
social change. When we started to design the ‘‘Peace 
and Global Transformation’’ programme, we were faced 
with the fact that there are more than 200 peace 
research institutions in the world. What could our role 
be? We found that very few studies had been made on 
peace as it relates to inevitable social change. If you ac- 
cept that the world is changing, then the study of peace 
and conflict resolution should aim at the reduction, as far 
as possible, of violence and human suffering. For in- 
stance, massive migration is now increasingly a feature 
of global change; the ethnic and cultural composition of 
all countries is in the process of changing and this leads 
to tension. The tensions may explode along fault lines not 
only of class but also of ethnicity, of race and of religion. 
These problems have not been sufficiently studied, and 
we should understand the phenomenon more deeply. 
Such understanding is necessary to enhance the adjust- 
ment capacity of society, because the movement of peo- 
ple from poor areas to rich areas and to empty spaces is 
going to increase; no government can do much about it. 
And it is a potential source of major conflict. 
Gauhar: Although you don’t have a student body as 
such, every major educational institution tries to in- 
culcate certain values in people who come into contact 
with it. Do you think that there are certain values which 
are specifically those of the UNU and which UNU Fellows 
or other people who come into contact with you should 
benefit from? Perhaps a greater global awareness...? 
Soedjatmoko: Yes. There are certain values which the 
UNU is committed to. Probably the most important is the 
sense of human solidarity. The UNU is an academic in- 
stitution which is not linked to any national interest but 
is based on an acceptance of human solidarity. | think 
that is a very important value— perhaps the most impor- 
tant value of all. [| 
  
The UNU is a new kind of university 
NU designed to: 1) increase understanding 
of causes and solutions of what its 
Charter terms “‘pressing global problems of human sur- 
vival, development and welfare;’’ 2) increase the prac- 
tical impact of research and post-graduate training by 
organizing collaboration among scientists and scholars 
across national boundaries; and 3) strengthen research, 
training and dissemination of knowledge activities, par- 
ticularly in developing countries. 
In its initial phase, the University developed three 
programmes —in World Hunger, the Use and Manage- 
ment of Natural Resources, and Human and Social 
Development. Their scope has been broadened with the 
adoption of a Medium-Term Perspective for the years 
1982-1987 to ensure that this early work remains rele- 
vant to the current world situation. The new University 
Programme that is emerging, under the leadership of its 
second Rector, Soedjatmoko, is thus an organic growth 
of the initial work. 
This unified University Programme is planned and car- 
ried out by three divisions, each with a distinctive func- 
tion. Problems are explored at the local and country level 
  
by the Development Studies Division. Their broader im- 
plications are looked at under the Regional and Global 
Studies Division. The results of the work are com- 
municated to various users in the new Information 
Society through the Global Learning Division. 
The University’s priority concerns are defined by five 
themes which range across the modern world’s most 
urgent anxieties: 1. Peace, Security, Conflict Resolution 
and Global Transformation; 2. The Global Economy; 
3. Hunger, Poverty, Resources and the Environment; 
4. Human and Social Development and the Co- 
existence of Peoples, Cultures and Social Systems; and 
5. Science and Technology and Their Social and Ethical 
Implications. 
In the 1984-1985 biennium, the University’s work 
will fall under eight programme areas: 1. Peace and 
Global Transformation; 2. The Global Economy; 
3. Energy Systems and Policy; 4. Resource Policy and 
Management; 5. Food-Energy Nexus; 6. Food, Nutri- 
tion, Biotechnology and Poverty; 7. Human and Social 
Development; and 8. Science, Technology and the In- 
formation Society.

### 56336: Franz Kafka, 1883-1924: the devil's pay

(CONTINUED FROM PAGE 29) 
ty which in turn terrifies us. The world he 
has taught us to read through his eyes is 
indeed Kafkaesque. 
The image which remains with us a 
hundred years after his birth is as com- 
posite as the multitude of interpretations 
his work has inspired. We have long been 
familiar with the sanatorium patient, 
ravaged by guilt and illness, dying of con- 
sumption without ever having succeeded 
in really living, with illness serving as a 
symbol for the profound evil which he 
tried to exorcise through writing. It is 
amazing to learn from witnesses that he 
was a vigorous, athletic young man who 
drew gusts of laughter from his writer 
friends when he read them the first 
chapter of The Trial. Without denying 
the existence of a fundamental despair in 
Kafka, one of these friends adds, ‘‘he 
had weapons with which to defend 
himself: they were humour, irony, and 
hope.”” He did not hesitate to assert that 
“hope finally triumphed; he possessed a 
literally messianic force.”” Setting aside 
the religious connotation, Kafka gave his 
friends an impression of force, and it is 
not pity he calls for, but the admiration 
we feel for those who have had the 
courage to take the measure of their evil, 
of our evil, and who struggle with all 
their might to overcome it. 
‘‘Strange and mysterious is the con- 
solation given by literature,” he wrote. 
Could this be because ‘literature alone 
draws from itself no succour, does not in- 
habit itself, is both a game and despair’’? 
This desperate game, says another 
witness, was ‘‘his only chance of hap- 
piness’’. The attempt of a man to destroy 
himself through writing becomes in our 
eyes one of the most solid constructions 
in all literature, even in its in- 
completeness. The paradox continues to 
the inevitable end. While in a matter of 
months the illness made terrible inroads 
in a body which it would even deprive of 
speech, Kafka was at peace when he died 
in the arms of his young friend Dora Dy- 
mant. Long before he had asked Max 
Brod to burn his manuscripts. But 
perhaps on 3 June 1924 he thought in- 
stead that Franz Kafka was achieving his 
transmutation. It was then that he came 
into the world, for ever more numerous 
generations of readers.

World Assembly for Peace, 
against Nuclear War 
Some 3,000 participants from 140 coun- 
tries attended a World Assembly for 
Peace and life, Against Nuclear War 
which was held in Prague {Czechoslova- 
kia) from 21 to 26 June 1983. In res- 
ponse to growing threats to world peace 
and the grave dangers engendered by the 
arms race, speakers drew attention to 
the various aspects of the danger of war; 
to the role of education for peace; to the 
interdependence of problems of develop- 
ment, international co-operation and the 
right to self-determination; and to the 
efforts of the United Nations and Unesco 
in favour of peace. The significance of 
the Assembly was stressed in addresses 
by Mr. Gustav Husak, President of the 
Czechoslovak Socialist Republic and by 
Mr. Romesh Chandra, Chairman of the 
World Peace Council. A message was 
addressed to the Assembly by Mr. 
Amadou-Mahtar M’Bow,  Director- 
General of Unesco, and an account was 
given of the Intergovernmental Confer- 
ence on international education held at 
Unesco earlier this year. The final appeal 
of the Assembly and reports produced by 
working groups are to be transmitted to 
the United Nations. 
International Appeal 
Launched for Havana Site 
On 19 July the Director-General of 
Unesco, Mr. Amadou-Mahtar M’Bow, 
launched an international appeal for the 
safeguard of the ‘’Plaza Vieja! (Old 
Square) and fortifications of the Old City 
of Havana, Cuba. Stressing the impor- 
tance of this architectural complex, in- 
scribed on Unesco’s World Heritage List 
in 1982, Mr. M’Bow said that the Plaza 
Vieja is one of the most representative 
examples of architecture originating in 
the encounter of various cultures “‘under 
sun’. The square, 
recognized by the Cuban Government as 
a national monument in 1976, is a main 
feature of old Havana in which baroque, 
neoclassical and Art Nouveau styles are 
all mixed in a typically Cuban composi- 
tion. The full text of the Director- 
General's appeal will be published in a 
forthcoming issue of the Unesco Courier 
to be devoted to the arts in Latin 
America. 
Simon Bolivar Prize 
Awarded for First Time 
At a solemn ceremony held in Caracas 
{Venezuela} on 24 July 1983 to com- 
memorate the bicentenary of the birth of 
Simén Bolivar the Liberator, the Director- 
General of Unesco, Mr. Amadou-Mahtar 
M’Bow, awarded the International Simén 
Bolivar Prize to its first recipients, King 
Juan Carlos of Spain, and Nelson 
Mandela, the African National Congress 
leader imprisoned in South Africa. The 
Prize was created in 1978 to reward ac- 
tivity of outstanding merit which, in ac- 
cordance with the ideals of Simén 
Bolivar, has contributed to the freedom, 
independence and dignity of peoples, to 
the strengthening of solidarity among na- 
tions, and to the establishment of a new 
and more equitable international order. In 
his address, Mr. M'Bow said that the 
Prize had been awarded to King Juan 
Carlos in recognition of his role in leading 
“the process which has culminated, not 
without incident, in the establishment in 
Spain of a democratic State based on the 
fundamental values of liberty, equality 
and justice’’. Turning to Mr. Oliver Tam- 
bo, President of the African National 
Congress, who represented Mr. Mandela 
at the ceremony, the Director-General 
said on presenting him with the Simén 
Bolivar Prize diploma and medal: ‘I 
should like to assure [Nelson Mandela] 
that even from the depths of his cell he 
has been more than ever among us, and 
that through us the immense majority of 
mankind is with him, hears his call and 
strives to bring him succour, in increas- 
ingly far-reaching and diverse ways, until 
the people of Nelson Mandela recon- 
quers its full rights.”” Nelson Mandela 
concluded his statement from the dock 
at his trial nearly 20 years ago with these 
words: “| have cherished the ideal of a 
democratic and free society in which all 
persons live together in harmony and 
with equal opportunities. It is an ideal 
which 1 hope to live for and to achieve. 
But if needs be, it is an ideal for which | 
am prepared to die’’.

“Simon Bolivar occupies a prominent place among the 
great figures of universal history whom the United Na- 
tions systein recognizes as its precursors... He was not 
just the hero of one country or a group of countries... or 
even of the American continent alone; by virtue of the 
universal scope of his thought, he endeavoured to voice 
the hopes of all the peoples of the world...” 
In these words Mr. Amadou-Mahtar M’Bow, Director- 
General of Unesco, sums up the historical importance 
and continuing influence of Simon Bolivar in a brief 
foreword to an anthology of Bolivar’s speeches and 
writings published by Unesco as a contribution to the . 
world-wide celebrations to mark the bicentenary of the 
birth of the ““Liberator’’. 
The anthology is published in English, French and 
Spanish editions and was compiled by the Venezuelan 
historian José Luis Salcedo Bastardo, who also wrote the § 
Introduction and provided the Chronology and the 
Bibliographical and Biographical Notes. The prologue is : 
by the Venezuelan writer Arturo Uslar Pietri.
