When sculptor Janus Kamban, who lives in 
the Faeroe Islands, saw our photo of a Sierra 
Leonean boy playing soccer (March 1987 
issue, page 2) he was captivated by it. “I 
thought it would be fun to see the agile 
movement from other sides too,” be wrote to 
us, “so I made a statuette of a playing boy.”

Only afew years ago, it was widely contended that 
one of the great transformations of modern society 
was the decline of the written and printed word and 
the rise to pre-eminence of the audiovisual media of 
communication. Today, to paraphrase a remark 
once made by the American humorist Mark Twain 
when news of his own death had been prematurely 
and inadvertently published, it may seem that 
reports of the demise of the printed word have been 
greatly exaggerated. While for centuries after the 
invention of printing with movable metal type, 
printing processes remained essentially unchanged, 
today the production of books, periodicals and 
other forms of printed matter is being 
revolutionized by computerized type design and 
photocomposition, satellite text transmission and 
other new technologies. Paradoxically enough, the 
development of microcomputers and “desktop 
publishing”—in theory at least—may offer its 
practitioners the extensive control over many stages 
of the printing and publishing process that was 
enjoyed by the European printers of 500 years ago. 
This issue of the Unesco Courier presents some 
landmarks in the history of printing and publishing 
from the invention of paper in China 2,000 years 
ago to modern electronic breakthroughs. Itis 
largely devoted to practical developments, ranging 
from the evolution of calligraphy and typography 
in late medieval Europe to methods of 
computerized typesetting in modern China. Some 
of the problems of printing and publishing in the 
developing world are highlighted in an article on 
the book situation in India by Lokenath 
Bhattacharya, who reminds us that “the principal 
factors governing publishing activities in a country 
are its literacy rate, the size and nature of its 
educated population, and its educational policies 
and programmes”,

FROM MOVABLE TYPE TO THE MICROCHIP 
LANDMARKS IN PRINTING 
BY WERNER MERKLI 
  
WERNER MERKLI, of Switzerland, is editor of the German-language 
edition of the Unesco Courier. A specialist in printing technology, he was for 
many years a director of a leading Swiss publishing and printing company, and 
served as president of the Association of Swiss Printing Industries from 1976 to 
1981. He was for 25 years president of the friends of the Swiss Gutenberg 
Museum, Berne. Among his published works are “Vademecum. An introduc- 
tion to the graphic arts”, published by Hallwag, Berne (2nd ed. 1967). 
1. The earliest picture of papermaking 
in Europe is this woodcut made by Jost 
Amann for Hans Sach’s “Book of 
Trades”, printed in Frankfurt in 1568. 
Although almostall steps in 
papermaking are now highly 
mechanized, the basic process remains 
unchanged. Plant fibres are separated 
and wetted to produce pulp, which is 
filtered on a screen, leaving a sheet 
from which the water is pressed out. 
The dry sheet is further compressed 
and treated, depending on the use for 
which itis intended.

OR more than 400 years after Johannes Gutenberg’s 
invention of a process of printing from movable 
metal type in the fifteenth century, all type was cast 
in a hand mould, the text was composed by hand, and 
printing was carried out on hand presses. It was not until 
the nineteenth century that typesetting and printing pro- 
cesses were mechanized. Since the mid-twentieth century, 
electronics and the microcomputer have revolutionized 
text composition, reproduction of illustrations and print- 
ing techniques. 
Papermaking 
Wm The art of papermaking (1) was invented by the Chinese as 
long ago as the second century BC (see article page 32), and 
travelled westward when Chinese papermakers, taken prison- 
er by the Arabs near Samarkand in AD 751, were forced to 
disclose their manufacturing secrets. In 1150 the art reached 
Spain, and by the time of Gutenberg, paper mills had been 
established in several European cities (2). Gutenberg thus had 
at his disposal a perfect printing material that was much 
cheaper than the parchment on which manuscripts were 
produced in the monasteries. 
Papermaking was not mechanized until around 1800, when 
the first papermaking machine was invented by a Frenchman, 
Nicolas-Louis Robert, in the Didot paper mills near Paris. It 
used 2a moving belt, and paper was made one sheet at a time (3). - 
In 1805 the English engineer Joseph Bramah devised a paper- 
moulding machine which used a rotating cylinder. This de- 
velopment later led to the production of continuous reels or 
“webs” of paper (4). The manufacture of paper is now almost 
entirely automated and quality control can be carried out by 
computer.

The art of printing 
  
- Letterpress 
Letterpress is the oldest method of printing, and the only 
process which can use type directly. Printing is done from cast 
metal type or from blocks on which the image or printing areas 
are raised (in relief) above the non-printing areas. Ink rollers 
touch only the top surface of the raised areas, and the inked 
imageis transferred directly to the paper, Above, operating 
principles of a type of letterpress machine with a flat bed and an 
impression cylinder. 
Bm Monastic libraries contain printed sheets dating from the 
ninth and tenth centuries which were produced from relief 
engraving on wooden blocks (5). Between 1041 and 1048, the 
Chinese smith Bi Sheng used a technique of printing texts on 
paper with movable characters made of earthenware, and 
printing was also carried out with characters cast in copper in 
a Korean printing works in 1403. Between 1436 and 1444, 
Johannes Gensfleisch zum Gutenberg, of Mainz, Germany 
(6), developed the type mould or matrix and originated a 
method of printing from movable metal type that was used 
without important change until the twentieth century. 
Gutenberg cuta punch in hard metal for every letter, accent 
and punctuation mark and struck it into a softer metal to make 
the mould for casting identical pieces of type. The type was 
made from an alloy of lead, antimony and tin. The finished 
characters were kept in compartmentalized typecases (7) from 
which the text was assembled. For printing, Gutenberg built a 
wooden worm-screw hand press (8), similar to a wine press. 
His printing ink consisted of a mixture of pinewood soot and 
linseed oil, which was spread on the printing surface with 
leather pads. To ensure better absorption of the ink, the paper 
was dampened before printing. 
It is not surprising that the first book Gutenberg chose to 
print was the Bible, for at that time it was the work most in 
demand. His “forty-two-line Bible” (see back cover), so 
named because of the number of lines in each column, was 
printed in Mainz between 1452 and 1455, in an edition of 200 
copies. The coloured initial letters to chapters and the decora- 
tions were added afterwards by hand, because so far as the 
design of the type (9) and the layout was concerned Guten- 
berg followed closely the model set by fine book manuscripts 
in the monasteries. 
The art of printing spread rapidly all over Europe. Many 
efforts were made to improve the efficiency of the wooden 
press, and Wilhelm Haas, a typefounder of Basel, Switzer- 
land, followed the basic design of the wooden press when in 
1787 he developed the first all-metal hand press, which pro- 
duced a better quality impression.

The idea that a rolling cylinder might be used in printing to 
overcome excessive manual strain was put forward in the early 
seventeenth century, but it was not until 1811 that the first 
steam-driven cylinder printing machine was patented by the 
German compositor and inventor Friedrich Koenig (10). 
Further progress was achieved in 1818 with the double rotary 
press designed by Koenig and his associate Andreas Bauer, in 
which paper printed on one side under one of the cylinders 
passed to the other cylinder to be printed on the other side. 
In 1844 Richard Hoe in the USA patented the first rotary 
press in which the type was carried on a metal cylinder instead 
of a flat plate. In 1866 the proprietor of the London Times, 
John Walter, had the first rotary press fed by a continuous roll 
Le == => of paper constructed according to the American model in- 
11. The Walter rotary press, 1866 vented by Jeptha Wilkinson (11), making it possible to print 
14,000 copies of the newspaper per hour. 
  
Revolving ata rate of 35,000 revolutions 
per hour, modern rotaries can print 500m 
of paper per minute.

Gravure 
MW This technique developed from the art of copperplate en- 
graving, in which the design is cut with a gouge, or chemically 
etched, into a polished copper plate (12). The earliest known 
etching was made by the Basel goldsmith, painter and graphic 
artist, Urs Graf, in the fifteenth century. Printing from the 
engraved plates was done by hand. Later an engraved cylinder 
was used instead of a flat plate, and reels of the material to be

differential between the image and non-image areas. In this 
process the image areas are recessed (intaglio) below the level of printed were fed between it and the pressing cylinder. This

surplus removed by a “doctor blade”, leaving ink only in the cotton prints was constructed in England by a copperplate 
recessed cells, printer, Thomas Bell. In 1860 Auguste Godchaux, a Paris 
publisher, obtained a patent for a gravure rotary press which 
would print on each side of the sheet. 
A key invention in modern gravure printing was a photo- 
graphic etching process using carbon tissue, developed by the 
Czech painter and graphic artist, Karl Klic, or Klietsch, in 
1878. Since then, millions of illustrated publications have been 
produced by gravure printing (13). 
In 1908, two Germans with experience in cotton printing, 
Ernst Rolffs and Eduard Mertens, developed a flexible steel 
“doctor blade” to wipe excess ink from the printing plate. 
Later, the process of etching the printing cylinder was greatly 
improved by the introduction of automated, electronic 
engraving.

Lithography and offset 
Mm The lithographic technique was discovered by chance in 
1796, when the Munich dramatist Aloys Senefelder, searching 
for a economical method of printing his own work, tried 
writing on a finely-ground stone surface and discovered the 
water-repellent properties of his greasy, oil-based ink. 
Initially, the images to be reproduced were hand-drawn on 
a litho stone (14) and printed on a manual press (15). The 
impression was taken by pressing the paper against the inked 
stone with a scraper. Thanks to the mechanization of this 
technique with Georg Sigl’s flat-bed litho press, introduced in 
Berlin in 1851, single and multi-colour lithographic printing 
(16) became very important, especially for printing packaging 
material. 
As early as 1805 Senefelder had tried to find an alternative 
to the heavy litho stone, but it was not until 1904 that Ira W. 
Rubel and Caspar Hermann of New Jersey, USA, devised a 
thin metal plate to carry the image to be printed. After this had 
been inked, and the surplus ink repelled with moisture, the

image was transferred to a rubber-coated cylinder and then to 14, Preparation 
the paper (17). This form of indirect printing is known as oflithostone, above 
offset. The fact that the printing plate, the rubber blanket and 
paper all ran on cylinders enabled higher printing speeds to be 
achieved from the start. 
In the early offset litho presses, the need for dampening 
often caused serious problems and the impressions obtained 
were dull and blurred. After the Second World War, technical 
improvements combined with better inks and more thickly- 
coated paper, resulted in sharper impressions and higher ink 
saturation. ) 15. Wooden lithographic hand

Revolutions in typesetting 
Wm Inthe nineteenth century attempts were made to mechanize 
text composition, which was still carried out line by line with 
individual metal characters assembled in a composing stick 
(19), following a process that had not changed greatly since 
Gutenberg’s time. The first patent for a typesetting machine 
was taken out in 1822 by William Church of Boston; others 
soon followed (20). 
But the real breakthrough in the mechanical setting and 
casting of type was achieved in 1884 by the German-born 
watchmaker Ottmar Mergenthaler in Cincinnati, USA, when 
he invented the Linotype machine, which could set 6,000 
characters per hour as compared with 1,400 by hand. In the 
Linotype system (21), the brass matrices in which the charac- 
ters are engraved in negative form are released from the 
storage magazine by typing on a keyboard, assembled into a 
line and moved into the casting mechanism. After casting, the 
entire lead line or “slug” is ejected and the matrices carried 
back to their position in the storage magazine where they 
remain on call for another line. 
In 1897, also in the USA, the English engineer Tolbert 
Lanston separated the operations of setting and casting the 
type in his Monotype machine. In the Monotype system (22), 
again by typing on a keyboard, a paper tape on the setting- 
machine was punched with a different combination of per- 
forations for each character. This punched tape mechanically 
controlled the typecasting mechanism, which cast each char- 
acter individually. Because of the high quality of the type 
produced by the Monotype system, it came to occupy a 
predominant position in book printing. 
Developments in photographic techniques led to many 
attempts to replace metal type by photographing the images 
of the characters (23). A successful early application of photo- 
typesetting was the Lumitype system developed by two 
Frenchmen, René Higonnet and Louis Moyroud, in the 
1940s. Production speeds exceeded 28,000 characters per hour 
on later models. In the Monophoto, introduced in England in 
1950 as a development of the Monotype system, the charac- 
ters could also be enlarged and reduced in size when projected 
onto film. 
In 1955 sensational developments in electronics sounded 
the deathknell of Gutenberg’s lead type. Instead of being 
controlled by perforated tapes, typesetting machines could 
now be driven by a computer programmed to expose the 
characters onto film, permitting an output of 30,000 to 
100,000 characters per hour. A considerable acceleration in 
output—up to 600,000 characters per hour—was achieved in 
the 1960s with the development of faster computers and the 
use of a cathode ray tube (CRT). 
Another significant development at this time was the intro- 
duction of the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) reading 
machine, which scans typewritten or printed text at the rate of 
300,000 characters per hour to produce input to a computer- 
driven typesetter. 
Considerable improvements in text input speeds were 
achieved with the introduction of integrated circuits and 
microprocessors into computer systems, as well as by the 
introduction of a visual display unit on which the selected 
characters appear as they are typed. The text can be read and 
corrected on the screen (24), before being stored in the 
computer’s memory. However, there is a limit to the typeset- 
ting speed of machines using CRT technology, as each charac- 
ter has to be picked out individually from the image matrix. 
8 
    
Another approach was adopted in 1965 by Dr. Rudolf Hell, 
of Kiel, Federal Republic of Germany. In his Digiset system, a 
scanning device analyses each character electronically and 
breaks it down into tiny squares, which are stored in the 
computer’s magnetic memory in digital form. When inputting 
text, these squares are recombined on film, again using a 
cathode ray tube, into characters of the required size and 
typeface. With a initial production speed of over 1 million 
characters per hour, this was another important breakthrough 
In typesetting. 
In 1976, the laser beam began to be used to replace the CRT 
beam for digital recording of the characters (25). The intense 
light beam from photons projects a sharper, clearer typeface. 
Digital storage of text opens up revolutionary possibilities for 
its high-speed transmission throughout the world, via satellite 
or fibre-optic cable.

The printed image 
Bm Throughout the Middle Ages, beautiful copperplate engra- 
vings, etchings, woodcuts (26) and lithographic prints were 
produced by draughtsmen and painters by carving or drawing 
on printing blocks of wood or stone, or by engraving on metal 
plates. Discoveries regarding light and the theory of colour, 
together with the invention of photography in the nineteenth 
century, brought the potential of photographic processes to 
the printing industry (27). 
Although solid lines can be printed directly using the 
letterpress and offset processes, the intermediate tones in 
photographs cannot. In 1881, the Munich copperplate en- 
graver Georg Meisenbach succeeded, by photographing an 
image through a screen of crossed lines, in breaking down the 
image into tiny dots. In the resulting positive, the closely- 
spaced dots combine to form the darker tones of the original 
image, and the less dense dots yield the light tones. The 
screened image can then be recorded on to a printing platein a 
process known as halftone etching. Screening is often carried 
out by electronic scanning today (28). 
For the reproduction of tonal images in colour, however, 


### 79611: Landmarks in printing; from movable type to the microchip

three plates must be made—one each to print red, blue and 
yellow ink. Usually, a black plate is also made, because black 
ink adds sharpness to the printed copy. The first step is to 
separate the colours photographically in the original image. 
The colour separations are made by taking four separate 
photographs through different filters which block out all 
colours except the desired colour, and also through a halftone 
screen to produce the dot pattern required for printing. In 
colour printing, some of the different coloured dots fall close 
together and some are superimposed. The eye mixes the 
colours of the dots on the printed page into all the tones of the 
original. For example, what the eye sees as green is really an 
area of tiny blue and yellow dots. Experiments carried out in 
the USA between 1946 and 1950 led to the development of a 
process for making colour separations by electronic scanning, 
and by the late 1970s, following developments in electronics 
technology, the impulses from the scanner beam were digi- 
tized. The tiny dots which produce the tonal values of the 
reproduction are then reconstituted by laser beam, either on 
film or directly onto the printing plate.

The electronic future 
m Developments in the printing industry during the coming 
decades will be primarily determined by advances in electro- 
nics. Desktop publishing technology (see article page 16) 
emerged in the 1980s for the processing of both text and 
image. Using electronic pencils and brushes, computer 
graphics can be created directly on the screen and integrated 
into the stored text. Furthermore, magnetic discs are being 
developed which can store over 1,000 million typographical 
signs (500,000 typewritten pages) and integrated databases 
will improve access to information. 
Metal typesetting and letterpress printing processes have 
virtually disappeared within a short period. Thanks to the 
simplification of platemaking, however, the offset and photo- 
gravure processes have survived. Electrostatic printing, 
whereby an electrostatically-charged plate transmits a dry 
powder or liquid ink toner to plain paper, and inkjet printing, 
in which computer-controlled jets are used to spray hundreds 
of thousands of electrostatically-charged drops of colour per 
second onto the paper to produce text and images, are just two 
of the techniques which are leading to contactless printing, 
instead of printing from an inked plate. [|

century on the instructions of Peter SAE .

LL typefaces, even the most modern digitized char- 
acters designed with the help of a computer, are 
based on forms of writing. This link between writ- 
ten and printed characters is particularly noteworthy in the 
history of European typographical design. 
The Phoenicians and the Greeks, who invented the early 
alphabets from which Western scripts derived, were seafar- 
ing and colonizing peoples who needed to carry precise and 
legible messages over very long distances. Consequently the 
priorities of Western writing were speed of execution and 
simplicity of design. 
The creation of phonetic alphabets (instead of ideographic 
systems) using only twenty to thirty signs for the transerip- 
tion of language was a decisive step in a process of abstrac- 
tion in which the Greeks played a leading role by consid- 
erably developing the Phoenician alphabet. The alphabet 
they created is the basis of the Latin characters used in many 
parts of the world today. 
By the fourth century BC, the Golden Age of Hellenic 
thought, Ionic script had already developed the rectangular 
form of modern capital lettering. During the Greek and 
Roman classical era, writing acquired the harmonious and 
balanced form which is known as lapidary because of its 
resemblance to the monumental script used for inscriptions 
in stone. This script with its: firmly chiselled grooves and 
broad strokes which stood out well in sunlight and were 
enhanced by shadow, answered a need for beauty and 
harmony but also expressed imperial power. Latin capital- 
letter script may be regarded as the basis of subsequent 
developments in Western scripts and, later, type designs. 
Cyrillic script, which was adopted by Orthodox Chris- 
tians for the Slavonic languages, particularly in Russia, em- 
ulated these upright, monumental styles of writing. System- 
atically used as a phonetic form, it became a widely 
employed substitute for Latin script in the Slav countries. 
The invention of Cyrillic script, derived from a Greek book 
hand, is attributed to the ninth-century Greek missionaries 
Cyril and Methodius, and was standardized by the Byzan- 
tine Emperor Constantine VII. 
After the heavy guadrata, or square capitals, the basis of 
all Latin scripts, and the Roman rustic capitals, an early form 
of cursive script, writing evolved towards the rounded uncial 
script. In the ninth century, Charlemagne imposed on the 
Holy Roman Empire the form of small lettering now known 
as Carolingian miniscule, which included most of the fea- 
tures of the lower case Latin alphabet. The official adoption 
of this cursive script did not bring about the disappearance of 
capital letters, but it was the dominant hand of Western 
Europe throughout the ninth century and served as a model 
for later innovators until the dawn of European printing in 
the fifteenth century. 
With the foundation of universities in Europe in the 
twelfth century, parchment became scarce. A new script, 
known as black-letter or Gothic, as angular and narrow as 
the Gothic pointed arch, answered the needs of the moment

### 79613: Calligraphy and typography in Europe

Printing was originally conceived as a process for 
the mechanical reproduction of manuscript. Many 
early printers came to typography through 
calligraphy, and the work of some later 
typographers has also been influenced by styles of 
handwriting. Right, specimen Western scripts 
from Roman times to the 18th century. 
in that it took up a minimum of space. The expression of 
thought seemed to be channelled through a kind of grid. This 
design gave rise to two basic scripts: the rigid, vertical 
Textura, used primarily for liturgical texts; and a more 
flexible script, Rotunda. 
"In the fifteenth century, the angular Gothic script, having 
been appropriated by the lettered classes in France, became 
known as bdtarde or Bastarda. The invention and use of 
spectacles also made it possible for writing to become small- 
er. It was not until the end of the sixteenth century that the 
Germans introduced capital letters into the Gothic alphabet 
for woodblock printing. Hitherto, the place of the “dropped 
initials” — initial letters at the beginning of a page or chapter, 
which covered two or three lines of text—had been left 
blank, to be filled in by the illuminators. 
For engraving, the Germans had adopted a spiky kind of 
script, whose rather fussy, fractured style suggested its name, 
Fraktur. The great painter and engraver Albrecht Diirer, 
who thought that letters could be governed by mathematical 
laws, undertook to impose a constructive discipline on 
Gothic script. This admirable undertaking culminated in a 
balanced appearance for each character. 
Around 1440, the German printer Johannes Gensfleisch, 
known as Gutenberg, of Mainz, took the remarkable step of 
bringing together and organizing all the processes of print- 
ing: punch-cutting, making matrices, type-casting, compos- 
ing and the use of a hand press. Once the discovery had been 
made, the art of printing spread rapidly. The Gutenberg 
forty-two-line Bible (see back cover), the first great feat of 
Western printing, was printed in Gothic lettering. Sub- 
sequently, Gutenberg increased his, range of typefaces to 
almost 300 so that he could reproduce different scripts as 
accurately as possible. 
The humanist scholars of fifteenth-century Italy never 
took to Gothic script. Petrarch considered that it looked 
blurred from a distance and caused eyestrain close to, as if it 
had been created not to be read, but for some other purpose. 
The Italian Renaissance therefore turned for inspiration to 
classical Antiquity, and calligraphers revived ancient monu- 
-mental lettering, thus returning to a simplicity and clarity 
that are still characteristic of printing today. The West, 
influenced by its artists, pursued the chimera of “divine 
proportion”, the mathematical relationship believed to be 
the key to beauty. Leonardo da Vinci sought it in the human 
body, as did Diirer and the great French typographer Geo- 
froy Tory, who studied the composition of letters according 
to the proportions of the human body in the Champflenry 
(1529), a treatise on type design. 
An important event which encouraged a new approach to 
printing was the sack of Mainz in 1462, which forced many 
of Gutenberg’s collaborators to leave the town. They took 
the secrets of printing to several European countries. 
Around 1470 one of them, the French engraver Nicolas 
Jenson settled in Venice, where he drew inspiration from 
humanist scripts in designing a new type with wedge-shaped

clerks. Left, modern Garamond

serifs. This pure and beautiful style was known as roman, a 
name which would in future be applied to typefaces with an 
upright design. Among the heirs to his workshop in that 
illustrious city was the learned Aldus Manutius, one of the 
great figures in European publishing. His type designer, 
Francesco Griffo of Bologna, cut the first example of a 
sloping type which became known as Aldine and is today 
called italic. It was based on the informal cursive writing 
developed by chancery clerks to speed their work. 
The sixteenth century was the Golden Age of calligraphy 
in Europe, rich in great calligraphers such as Ludovico degli 
Arrighi, Ugo da Carpi, Giovanniantonio Tagliente and Pala- 
tino in Italy, Jean Beauchenne in France and Roger Ascham 
in England. As progress was made in copper engraving, so a 
cursive script with slender finials (terminal hooks) emerged 
and came to fruition in the work of Lucas Matherot and 
Louis Barbedor. 
In France, where the development of printing was influen- 
ced by the work of Geofroy Tory, the Estienne family was 
prominent. One of its members, Robert Estienne, was print- 
er to King Francois I. He entrusted Claude Garamond with a 
royal command to cut typefaces for editions of classical 
Greek texts. The famous Grecs du Roi which resulted were 
uncluttered and elegant. Garamond, the first commercial 
typefounder, also designed the roman and italic typefaces 
which bear his name and which played a leading role in 
European typographical design until the end of the sixteenth 
century. 
In this great humanist movement, Christophe Plantin (see 
page 14), a French bookbinder who became a citizen of 
Antwerp and a printer, acted as a connecting link with the 
Netherlands, where a great dynasty of printers, the El- 
zeviers, had come to the fore and would be active until the 
beginning of the eighteenth century. The Elzeviers gave their 
name to an elegant wedge-serif typeface. 
In 1692, during the reign of Louis XIV and classicism, 
Abbé Nicolas Jaugeon of the French Academy of Sciences 
was given the task of creating a new typeface. His design, cut 
by Philippe Grandjean, was called Romain du Roi and was 
reserved for the exclusive use of the Imprimerie Royale—the 
Royal Press. This cold, majestic script was first used in 1702. 
The eighteenth century was an age of elegant typography 
in Britain. The typefounder William Caslon cut a highly 
legible typeface which is still in use today. Caslon was the 
typeface in which a Baltimore printer issued the official 
copies of the United States Declaration of Independence. 
Another English printer, John Baskerville, who taught cal- 
ligraphy, designed a graceful, balanced typeface which revo- 
lutionized typography and is still popular. 
In eighteenth-century France, Louis-René Luce, engraver 
to King Louis XV, introduced the rational spirit of the 
Enlightenment and the Encyclopedists into typographical 
experimentation, while Pierre-Simon Fournier and Frangois- 
‘Ambroise Didot invented the point system of typographic 
measurement. Both Didot’s son Firmin and Giambattista

ADC d 
Bodoni of Parma were inspired by Baskerville’s work to 
create very similar forms of austere lettering with strongly 
contrasting thick and thin strokes. Their work influenced 
nineteenth-century type design in several countries. 
The development of lithography, a process of printing 
“from a stone surface invented in 1796 by the dramatist 
Aloys Senefelder (see page 7), encouraged printing from 
types based on calligraphic script with fine, supple curves. 
From 1830 onwards, as a result of scientific and technical 
advances and the development of industry and trade, a 
dynamic form of typography came into being through the 
work of typefounders such as Alexandre de Berny and 
Théophile Beaudoire. Egyptian, with its slab serifs, and Fat 
Face, still widely used in the press and advertising, were 
highly fashionable typefaces. 
William Morris, the poet and writer who made a major 
contribution to the revival of English decorative art in the 
late nineteenth century, was the leader of the Arts and Crafts 
Movement which took inspiration from the styles of medie- 
val times. The work produced by his Kelmscott Press had a 
strongly individual graphic personality and exercised wide 
influence. In France, George Auriol and the painter and 
engraver Eugene Grasset were among the masters of Art 
Nouveau. The latter received support from the typefounder 
Georges Peignot, who later, with his son Charles, produced 
a range of typefaces which would dominate printing until the 
advent of phototypesetting in 1956. Peignot, designed by the 
French poster artist Adolphe Mouron Cassandre in 1937, 
and Bifur, a shaded script of great originality, are among the 
finest typefaces cut by the Deberny and Peignot typefoundry. 
Today, although computerization is widespread, there is a 
welcome revival of interest among young people in the art of 
calligraphy, which is encouraging the search for and creation 
of new designs. Outstanding modern designers of digitized 
letters include the great German calligrapher Hermann Zapf; 
Adrian Frutiger of Switzerland; Ladislas Mandel, José 
Mendoza, Albert Boton, all of France; as well as the young 
French designer of Arin, Franck Jalleau. 
We are at the dawn of a new age of typography. Lettering 
is no longer created by lead objects but by strokes of light. 
Photocomposition systems can now provide higher screen 
resolution, allowing sharper definition of characters, as well 
as an immense variety of typefaces, offering great scope for 
creativity. Soon, these machines will achieve a degree of 
sensitivity close to that of handwriting, and will give typo- 
graphers a degree of control over the design of lettering far 
superior to that of early electronic typesetting systems. But to 
safeguard an entire heritage of craftsmanship, metal type must 
not be allowed to disappear. n 
ROGER DRUET, a leading French typographer and calligrapher, has been 
professor of graphic design and the history of writing at the Ecole Supérieure 
des Arts Appliqués, in Paris, since 1960. He is the author of numerous studies 
on the art of writing in ancient and modern times, notably La Civilisation de

### 79615: Christophe Plantin, the master-printer of Antwerp

CHRISTOPHE 
PLANTIN 
The master-printer of Antwerp 
BY FRANCINE DE NAVE 
‘AaBbCcD 
14 
  
FRANCINE DE NAVE, Belgian historian and 
palaeographer, is director of the Plantin-Moretus 
Museum in Antwerp and of the Antwerp Print- 
Room. She is the author of many books and articles 
on the history of Antwerp. A longer version of the 
present text has appeared in Belgique, des Maisons 
et des Hommes, published by Nouvelles Editions 
Vokaer, Brussels. 
HRISTOPHE Plantin was born 
( some time around the year 1520 in 
Saint-Avertin, near the French city 
of Tours, and served his apprenticeship with 
the bookbinder and bookseller Robert Macé 
in Caen. In 1549, after a brief stay in Paris, 
he moved to Antwerp, at that time the hub 
of Western European trade, and set up a 
bookbinding business. 
Antwerp suited his purpose perfectly, as 
it was ideally situated to provide the equip- 
ment and raw materials necessary to set up a 
bindery. And since it was also a major 
financial centre, the capital necessary to cre- 
ate a business was readily available. In addi- 
tion, it was a city which attracted wealthy 
art-lovers of all kinds. 
Plantin had been in Antwerp for only a 
few years when, following a wound to his 
arm, he abandoned bookbinding in favour 
of printing. The publication in 1559 of a 
description of the magnificent funeral cere- 
mony of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles 
V, by his son Philip II of Spain, established 
Plantin’s reputation, and he quickly found 
himself at the head of what would prove to 
be the most important printing-house in 
Western Europe during the second half of 
the sixteenth century. 
Between 1563 and 1567, Plantin printed 
and published over 200 titles, ranging from 
annotated pocket editions of the classics to 
liturgical works, Hebrew Bibles, richly il- 
lustrated anatomical treatises and botanical 
studies. 
Now a man of substance, Plantin enjoyed 
great celebrity and was surrounded by a 
circle of influential friends and acquaint- 
ances, one of whom—Gabriel de Cayas, 
secretary to Philip IT—was to play a decisive 
role in the further development of his af- 
fairs. It was Plantin’s ambition to produce 
an authoritative edition of the Old and New 
Testaments; de Cayas secured financial 
backing for the project from the Spanish 
king, who also sent to Antwerp, to serve as 
its specialist editor, his chaplain—the hu- 
manist Benedictus Arias Montanus. 
The undertaking, which took five years to 
complete (1568-1573), was an outstanding 
success: a copiously annotated edition of the 
Bible in four languages (Hebrew, Syriac, 
Greek and Latin), running to eight massive 
volumes in folio. This Biblia Regia or Biblia 
Polyglotta, as it was known, not only con- 
stituted a personal triumph for Plantin; it 
was also the most voluminous publication 
ever produced in the Netherlands by a 
single printer. Its appearance marked the 
beginning of the most prosperous period of 
Plantin’s business. 
Thanks to the success of the Polyglot 
Bible, and through the influence of Arias 
Montanus, Plantin, who had already ob- 
tained the office of prototypus regius (royal 
printer) from the Spanish monarch, was 
accorded a monopoly in the sale of missals 
and breviaries in Spain and its colonies over- 
seas. The lands in question rapidly became

his most important clients, and carried his 
fortunes to their zenith. 
No fewer than sixteen presses were at 
work in Plantin’s printing-house—an enor- 
mous figure when it is remembered that the 
biggest printer in France at the time, Es- 
tienne, was operating only four. The num- 
ber of his employees confirmed Plantin’s 
ascendancy: there were 54 staff living and 
working on the premises in 1574; with the 
addition of those who lived or worked at 
home the total must have been in the region 
of 150. Work went ahead at a feverish pace; 
12- or 13-hour days were the norm. Each 
press had to meet a daily target of 1,250 
printed sheets, or 2,500 pages. But the type- 
setters, printers and proof readers were by 
no means dissatisfied with their lot: they 
were pieceworkers, and a high output com- 
manded excellent rates. Plantin’s workers 
were among the best-paid in Antwerp. 
Quantity was not, however, the sole con- 
cern. Plantin insisted on the highest quality 
as well. The paper mills of the southern 
Netherlands at the time produced only me- - 
diocre material, so he imported the finest 
paper from Germany, and more especially 
from France. The type used for printing his 
publications had to be perfect as well, and 
he called on the best typecutters of the age: 
Claude Garamond, Robert Grandjean, 
Guillaume Le Bé and Hendrick van de 
Keere, besides playing an important person- 
al role in the development of typestyles in 
Western Europe by importing the roman 
and italic typefaces currently in use in 
France.

illustrations, Plantin preferred to print them 
from engraved copper plates, which pro- 
duced finer lines and more delicate tones 
than the wood blocks generally utilized. If 
the latter gradually fell out of favour for 
book illustrations, it was because of the 
success enjoyed by Plantin’s publications. 
Plantin was equally attentive to the con- 
tent of his books. Despite his monopoly of 
the sale of liturgical works, his presses were 
not exclusively engaged in turning out mis- 
sals, breviaries, antiphonaries,! diurnals, 
books of hours and psalters. He applied 
himself to publishing the most outstanding 
literary works of the post-humanist age: 
collections of the classics or of laws, princi- 
ples and maxims; school books; the first 
edition of Variarum lectionum libri 111 by 
the Flemish humanist Justus Lipsius and 
Origines Antwerpianae by the physician 
Goroptus Becanus in 1569; and, in 1574, the 
first dictionary of the Netherlandic lan- 
guage, the Dictiunarium Teutonico-Lati- 
num, compiled at his request by his proof 
reader Cornelius Kiliaan. 
Tragedy came to Antwerp in 1576, 
against the troubled background of the wars 
of religion in which the Low Countries 
were embroiled for much of the second half 
of the century. In what came to be known as 
the “Spanish Fury”, mutinous bands of 
Spanish mercenaries sacked the city, mas- 
sacring hundreds of its citizens, plundering 
and destroying everything in their path. 
Plantin’s printing-house was spared, but its 
output was seriously affected. After the 
“Fury”, Antwerp joined in the rebellion 
against Spanish absolutism. Trade with 
dEeFfGgHhIKKL] 
Spain, on which the prosperity of Plantin’s 
enterprise had depended, fell into a decline. 
In 1578, only six presses were functioning; 
after 1583 there would never again be more 
than ten. 
Under such circumstances, Plantin had 
little choice but to work with the Repub- 
~ lican rebels. He was appointed official print- 
er to the city of Antwerp, governed at the 
time by a Calvinist magistrate, and later 
became printer to the Duke of Anjou, 
French ally of William of Orange, the char- 
ismatic leader of the rebellion. The printing- 
house thus took on a new lease of life, and 
works of considerable importance were 
soon emerging once again from the presses. 
Towards the end of 1582, Plantin had to 
face another turn in his fortunes. Spanish 
troops were threatening Antwerp, so he 
considered opening a branch office further 
north, to which, if necessary, his activities 
might be evacuated. He left Antwerp for 
Leiden, where his old friend Justus Lipsius, 
who was associated with the recently estab- 
lished Calvinist University, had obtained 
for him the franchise of the university press, 
then he worked for a time in Cologne, but 
by 1585 he had returned to Antwerp. 
Four years remained to the master print- 
er. The publication of the Martyrologium 
Romanum of Cardinal Baronius in 1589 was 
Christophe Plantin’s last major undertak- 
ing. When he died, that same year, he left 
behind a vast enterprise, the printing-house 
he had created, which would survive him for 
another three hundred years. n

One of the many possibilities offered by do-it-yourself electronic publishing systems using personal computers may be to 
help developing countries meet their needs for textbooks and other printed materials. 
N 1473, explaining the somewhat slipshod appearance 
of his latest publication, a printer of Parma in northern 
Italy declared that because rivals were about to bring 
out the same text, he had had to rush it through the printing 
process “faster than you can cook asparagus”. 
This colourful hyperbole bears eloquent witness to the 
astonishingly rapid spread of publishing in the second half of 
the fifteenth century. Barely twenty-five years after Jo- 
hannes Gutenberg had originated his new method of print- 
ing (using movable metal type, a press and an oil-based 
printing ink), printing had spread to nearly all the major 
trading centres of Europe. In the first half of the fifteenth 
century the number of manuscript books in Europe could be 
counted in tens of thousands; by the year 1500, more than 9 
million books had been printed. 
The history of printing and publishing, like that of all 
human progress, is a record of the interplay between techno- 
logical innovation and social change. Whilst each of these 
two streams of human activity promotes the other, with each 
in turn playing the leading role, the really crucial leaps ahead 
have always been made when the two converge to become an 
irresistible tide. Thus, whilst it was made technically possible 
by Gutenberg’s discoveries, the development of printing in 
Europe, “The German Art” as it was at first called, was 
equally a response to the spread of literacy and to the social 
climate of the Early Renaissance. 
The early printers were men of many talents. Not only did 
they design and cast their own typefaces, they also fulfilled 
the functions of publisher, editor, printer and bookseller. 
16 
Oaly bookbinding and the manufacture of paper were left to 
others. William Caxton, for example, the first English print- 
er, was an accomplished linguist and himself translated from 
the French the first book to be published in English, The 
Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye (1475), which he printed 
on the press he had established in Bruges. 
One of the great early printer-publishers was the Venetian 
Aldus Manutius (1449-1515). In 1490, Aldus began produc- 
ing the first printed editions of many of the Greek and Latin 
classics. Later he pioneered the production of cheap pocket 
editions, with what for those days were large print runs of 
1,000 copies to keep down the cost, and commissioned the 
first italic typeface (see page 12). In 1502, he published 
Dante’s La Divina Commedia on which his famous imprint, 
the anchor and dolphin, appeared for the first time. 
As the demand for books and publications of every sort 
grew, the days of the great printer-publishers were num- 
bered. The only way the book-hungry market could be 
supplied was by specialization and the division of labour. As 
a consequence the world of publishing gradually took on a 
new form, which has lasted until modern times, with the 
functions of author, publisher, printer, bookbinder and 
bookseller becoming separated. 
Significantly, however, the name of Aldus Manutius has 
become associated with the current revolution in the pub- 
lishing world, for Paul Brainerd, the man who in 1985 coined 
the phrase “desktop publishing”, is president of the Aldus 
Corporation, the firm that produced one of the first pro- 
grams capable of composing and formatting text merged

with graphics on a computer for subsequent output to the 
new generation of printing and typesetting machines. 
What exactly is desktop publishing? Basically it is the 
application of personal computers to the entire range of the 
publishing process, from the typing in of the author’s origi- 
nal copy to the final printing of the publication. It is a means 
of producing documents, complete with graphics, ranging 
from one-page information or advertising leaflets, through 
brochures and price lists, to newsletters, magazines and even 
books, on equipment which can comfortably be housed on a 
reasonably large desk. 
. The basic equipment, or “hardware”, required consists of 
a computer, complete with a visual display unit (screen), a 
keyboard and a movement sensing device known as a mouse, 
an optical scanner and a laser printer. The programs, or 
“software”, needed to operate the equipment consist of a 
- “page description language” which translates the image on 
the computer screen into a set of digital instructions that the 
laser printer can follow, and a composition program to drive 
the entire system. 
The advent of desktop publishing was as sudden as its 
social and economic implications were profound. As recent- 
ly as 1970, the text sent by a publisher to a professional 
printer would be set in “hot metal” by methods not funda- 
mentally different from those used by Gutenberg and Cax- 
ton some 500 years earlier. By 1985, typesetting to profes- 
sional standards could be achieved in the office and in the 
home. 
Five key technical advances made this possible: 
® the development of a new generation of very powerful 
personal computers; 
® the development of page description languages to drive 
laser printers and phototypesetters; 
® the development of small, comparatively cheap laser 
printers with a printing resolution (300 dots per inch) capa- 
ble of producing output of “publishable” quality; 
® the development of composition languages to drive the

whole desktop system which can easily be operated by users 
with very little knowledge of computers, typesetting or 
graphics; 
® the development of scanning devices which can “read” 
photographs, drawings and previously typed or printed texts 
and feed them into a computer where they can be modified as 
required and incorporated into the document to be pro- 
duced. 
Coupled with the development of new manufacturing 
methods which have brought the price of this equipment 
tumbling down (it is now possible to buy a complete desktop 
publishing system for US $10,000 or less, and prices are still 
falling), these technical advances constitute a revolution of 
worldwide scope and importance. 
Anyone who uses such equipment is, like Aldus Manutius 
and the early printer-publishers, in a position to control the 
entire publishing process, from initial selection of what is to 
be printed, through input of text and graphics, to final 
output of the printed page. Only rather rudimentary meth- 
ods of bookbinding are available to the desktop publisher, 
however, and, as in the days of Aldus Manutius, quality 
bookbinding is likely, for the time being, to remain a 
separate domain. 
Desktop publishing has swept away most of the barriers 
that for centuries have stood between those who want to 
publish and their potential readers. Composition programs 
and page description languages have replaced the craft skills 
of the printing process and handed back the choice of what is 
to be published to the author. 
A good desktop publishing package will offer a wide 
choice of typeface styles and sizes, number of columns per 
page, justified or unjustified text, automatic hyphenation of 
words at the end of lines, insertion of graphics and automatic 
flow of text around them, as well as automatic page number- 
ing and spelling checking. 
There is nothing now to prevent the author of a specialist 
or minority interest book that no publisher will handle

because it might not be profitable, or of a potential literary 
masterpiece whose merit is not immediately recognized, 
from publishing it himself. 
Clearly, because of the problems of storing and handling 
the huge quantities of paper involved, the ordinary member 
of the public will not be in a position to print more than a 
few hundred copies of a brochure, a newsletter, or even a 
short book. Nor will he or she have the organization to 
distribute a daily newspaper or to handle sales of a book that 
turns out to be a best-seller. For the time being at least this 
will still be the domain of the major newspaper proprietors 
and the publishers with their well organized bookselling 
outlets. 
Nor should it be forgotten that, despite the impressive 
functions that desktop publishing software has to offer, the 
layout and appearance of the printed page will depend upon 
the skill and taste of the operator. Many of the basic rules of 
good page design can be quickly learned, but these need to be 
complemented by flair and practical experience. 
The wider social, political and economic implications of 
desktop publishing are equally profound. Censorship, 
whether by governments or by powerful interest groups, 
will be much more difficult if not impossible to impose. 
Minority groups will find it easier to make their voices heard 
and, with the development of electronic transmission, fron- 
tiers will no longer be effective barriers to information.

### 79616: The Desktop revolution

For the developing world the possibilities would appear to 
be enormous: 
® It will no longer be necessary to fund the huge capital 
investment involved in setting up a traditional printing 
works and distribution network (a complete desktop pub- 
lishing package can be bought for as little as a quarter of the 
cost of a single professional typesetting machine). 
® A three-month training course in desktop publishing will 
replace the long and costly apprenticeship of the traditional 
print craftsmen. 
® Costly distribution of books, newspapers, etc., over large 
areas, often with an inadequate or non-existent road and rail 
infrastructure, will be replaced by electronic transmission of 
the material to be published, in print-ready form for local 
printing. 
® The cost of school textbooks will plummet as will the cost 
of revising and up-dating them. No wasteful stocks of 
unused books will be built up since it will be much easier to 
match local print runs to local demand. 
® Fach area will be able, where necessary, to modify text- 
books to meet specific local needs. 
The advantages are not limited to the developing world. 
The desktop publishing revolution may well lead to the 
creation of the first personalized, electronic newspapers 
which would be transmitted directly to the home or office 
for printing on a laser printer. Subscribers with home or 
office computers and printers could indicate those subjects 
that interest them most and these would be included in the 
personalized newspapers that would be transmitted to them 
at any time they cared to specify. 
Charles Geschke, who with John Warnock pioneered one 
of the earliest and most widely used page description lan- 
guages, recently declared: “One of my fantasies is to wake up 
in the morning and have my automated clippings service 
deliver me a sheaf of papers on my printer at home with 
exactly the kind of articles that I would be interested in.” 
Such fantasies may well soon become reality. Thanks to 
the desktop publishing revolution, news of what is happen- 
ing anywhere in the world will soon be instantly available. 
Perhaps more important still, we will all one day have direct 
access to the accumulated sum of human knowledge and 
culture very much “faster than you can cook asparagus”.m

Unesco 
and the printed word 
~ WThe rural press in Africa _ 
In Africa today only 15 out ofvery 1,000 
people are reached by daily newspapers, and 
the use of the press as a medium of mass 
communication presents many problems, 
especially in the rural areas where 80 per cent 
of the population lives and where over 800 
languages are spoken. And yet the printed 
media can play animportant role by bridging 
the communications gap which prevents iso- 
lated farming communities from taking full 
part in national development programmes 
and by providing excellent follow-up mate- 
rials in literacy teaching. For many years 
Unesco has co-operated with Member States 
in this field by helping to create rural news- 
papers, by training journalists and by provid- 
ing other forms of technical support. One 
current undertaking, the West and Central 
Africa News Agencies Development Project 
(WANAD) based in Cotonou, Benin, is serv- 
ing 13 national news agencies. As part of its 
activities WANAD, which was launched in 
1984 by Unesco with finance from the Feder- 
al Republic of Germany, provides training 
for journalists in the fields of international 
relations, health, rural development and the 
environment. A sister project, SEANAD, 
was set up in 1986 in Southern and Eastern 
Africa. Above right, front pages of rural 
newspapers from 2 WANAD Member States:

of Tew Fema, published in the Kabyie lan- 
guage of Togo. 
WB Children’s books in Asia and the Pacific 
Launched in 1970 by the Tokyo-based Asian 
Cultural Centre for Unesco, the Asian/ 
Pacific Copublication Programme (ACP) is a 
venture designed to provide children in 
countries of Asia and the Pacific with reason- 
ably priced illustrated books. Good stories 
and illustrations by authors and artists from 
different countries are selected and published 
in an English version. Participating coun- 
tries use this master edition (as well as films of 
the colour illustrations, which are also pro- 
vided free) to produce editions in their own 
languages. ACP books have so far been 
translated into some 27 Asian languages and 
more than 2.5 million copies have been 
printed. Right, illustration from Folk Tales 
from Asia for Children Everywhere (Book 6).

BM Practical training for publishers 
As part of its efforts to stimulate book pub- 
lishing in the developing world, Unesco has 
organized a number of regional training 
courses for publishing personnel in Asia and 
the Pacific, Latin America, Africa and the 
Caribbean. Over 200 people attended these 
courses in 1986 and 1987. During a 6-week 
course jointly undertaken by Unesco and the 
University of the Philippines Institute of 
Mass Communication in December 1987, 
participants were divided into 3 teams, each 
of which was given a manuscript about rice 
and asked to prepare it for publication as an 
illustrated booklet. Each team had to edit the 
manuscript, prepare it for typesetting, cor- 
rect proofs, lay out the text, design the cover, 
and write publicity material. Left, the book- 
lets produced by the 3 teams. 
MW Book development in Latin America 
The Regional Centre for Book Development 
in Latin America and the Caribbean (CER- 
LALC) was founded in Bogot4 in 1971 by an 
agreement between Unesco and the Govern- 
ment of Colombia. Participating countries 
today are Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, 
Colombia, Costa Rica, the Dominican Re- 
public, Ecuador, El Salvador, Nicaragua, 
Panama, Paraguay, Spain and Venezuela. 
The Centre aims to promote the production 
and distribution of books and to encourage 
the reading habit, taking account of develop- 
ment programmes as well as the public and 
school library systems in each country. In 
addition to the professional training courses 
which CERLALC organizes for publishing 
personnel, it has launched a copublication 
programme of children’s books for Latin 
America. The aim is to publish good-quality 
children’s literature at low prices by sharing 
the production costs between all the partici- 
pating countries. The first title to be pub- 
lished was “Tales, Myths and Legends for 
Latin-American Children”, in an edition of 
20,000 copies (above left, cover of the Portu- 
guese version). Today publishers from 15 
countries are taking part in the programme, 
and 6 titles have been published, totalling 
(with reprints) 332,000 copies.

### 79620: Computerized typesetting in China

  
Computerized typesetting 
in China 
HE technique of printing using mov- 
able type was invented by Bi Sheng 
in China between 1041 and 1048 and 
not, as is widely believed, by Johannes 
“Gutenberg in fifteenth-century Europe. The 
type used by Bi Sheng was made of earthen- 
ware, but in later times in China it became 
common to use wood, enamelware or metal. 
With the development of movable lead type, 
“hot metal” came to be used all over the 
world for the mass production of printed 
works. 
The low cost of setting lead type, which 
could be melted down after printing so that 
the same metal was used over and over again, 
made this technique the mainstay of the 
printing industry for centuries. With the 
rapid progress of photocomposition, 
XU LIAN-SHENG, of China, is deputy director 
of the Photosetting Centre of the China Research 
Institute of Printing Science and Technology. He 
also played a leading part in the design of China’s 
KY Microcomputer Photosetting System. 
20 
however, and especially the computerization 
of typesetting in recent years, movable lead 
type has inevitably become obsolete. 
In China, setting movable type has always 
been a complex and exhausting job because 
of the huge number of characters in the 
Chinese language. A typesetter has to walk 
between five or six cases of type and reach 
high and low in order to find and retrieve the 
required pieces. 
A modern version of this problem arises 
with computerized typesetting. A regular 
keyboard will suffice for entering into the 
computer all the letters of Western lan- 
guages, but has far too few keys to enter the 
thousands of Chinese characters. 
Two methods can be used to solve the 
problem. One is to make a large keyboard 
with each key representing a Chinese charac- 
ter, the finding and entering of which are 
done by an operator. The advantage of this 
method is that the operator can see the char- 
acter to be keyed in. The disadvantage is that 
BY XU LIAN-SHENG 
the keyboard has to be very large and the 
arrangement of the keys is extremely com- 
plicated. The operator takes 2 long time to 
learn by heart the position of each character, 
and searching among the mass of keys is a 
laborious task. 
The other method is to use a keyboard the 
same size as that of a Western-language com- 
puter and enter each Chinese character by 
striking more than one key in a certain pat- 
tern which reflects the construction of that 
character. A number of systems have been 
developed in accordance with this principle; 
they all make use of either the vocal or the 
written features of a given character. 
An operator using the vocal method has to 
transliterate the characters into the Chinese 
Phonetic Alphabet and then key in the let- 
ters. For instance, to enter the word China, 
which has two characters, the operator 
strikes the letters making up the words 
“Zhong Guo” (the phonetic pronunciation 
of the word). The advantage of this method

« Cases of metal type in the composing room of a 
daily newspaper in China. The Chinese writing 
system, which is ideographic rather than 
alphabetic, uses several thousand characters. 
A Chinese typewriter. The tray contains some Pp» 
2,500 characters individually cast in lead and 
arranged face up. Above is a sheet of paper on a 
roller, and the typing mechanism, which is

ter. The operator then pushes a lever which lifts 
the character out of the tray and forces it 
against the inked ribbon. 
is that anyone who knows the correct pro- 
nunciation of the character to be keyed in 
can operate the machine without previous 
training. The disadvantage lies in the high 
rate of duplicated codes due to the fact that 
there are so many homophones in Chinese. 
Various methods of text input make use of 
written features. All Chinese characters can 
be broken down into basic structural com- 
ponents, which are few in number. If these 
components are properly arranged on a 
keyboard, any Chinese character can be 
‘keyed in by grouping them. For example, the 
word (country) is composed of TJs and 
I] . Both the number of key strokes needed 
to enter a character and the rate of possible 
duplicated codes can be reduced to a fairly 
low level if the breakdown of the compo- 
nents is correct. Furthermore, the operator 
does not need to know how to pronounce 
the character. This method is clearly useful 
since there are so many local dialects in 
China that sometimes people who live fif- 
teen kilometres apart cannot understand 
each other. 
One practice commonly used to increase 
operating speed is the word-group method, 
whereby the operator strikes a single key to 
enter a frequently used word or phrase. 
  
Another problem is that Chinese text may 
be set either vertically or horizontally (in 
some magazines articles are set both ways), 
and a good composing system must be cap- 
able of meeting these requirements. What 1s 
more, a number of Chinese magazines pub- 
lish articles containing words or passages in 
foreign languages, and so we also need a 
system which can set Western language texts 
as well as those in Chinese. 
With regard to output—the generation by 
the computer of text in the required for- 
mat—the biggest problem is how to cope 
with the mass of data involved in processing 
a huge number of characters each of which, 
for the computer, has an information con- 
tent many times higher than that of an En- 
glish letter. Various methods have thus been 
devised for compressing this information 
into abridged form so as to take up less of the 
computer’s memory. This is an area in which 
there is a need for further study and develop- 
ment. 
Computerized typesetting in the Chinese 
language has already made remarkable prog- 
ress and, as it comes to replace metal type- 
setting, will surely play an increasingly 
important role in the Chinese printing 
industry. [|

### 79622: The Book situation in India

The book situation in India 
BY LOKENATH BHATTACHARYA 
the eighth largest book producing country in the world. 
With a healthy climate for authorship, democratic pol- 
icles and institutions, increasingly well-equipped printing 
plants, availability of locally produced paper, editorial ex- 
pertise, a functioning network of distribution and a growing 
community of readers, the country also has the largest 
publishing infrastructure in the developing world. 
According to a survey of the Indian book industry carried 
out by the National Council of Applied Economic Research, 
there are some 3,000 active publishers in India, including 
about 100 large firms bringing out a minimum of 50 titles per 
year. Educational publishing occupies the most prominent 
place. Although the great bulk of publishing is in private 
hands, about 450 agencies in the public sector are also active 
in this field. In fact, the central government has emerged as 
India’s largest single publishing agency, and now accounts 
for about 20 per cent of the country’s book production. 
The problems of authorship and publishing in India 
should be seen against a background of enormous linguistic 
and ethnic diversity. Fifteen major languages are recognized 
by the Constitution as national languages. They are, al- 
phabetically, Assamese, Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, 
Kashmiri, Malayalam, Marathi, Oriya, Punjabi, Sanskrit, 
Sindhi, Tamil, Telugu and Urdu. All these are independent 
languages, not dialects or variations of another language, and 
most of them have quite extensive literatures of their own. 
Each is spoken by millions of people. 
In addition to the major languages and a few others such as 
Dogri, Konkani, Maithili, Manipuri, Nepali and Rajasthani 
which, though not as important, are still spoken by large 
numbers of people, there are nearly 400 tribal mother 
tongues in India, most of them with no written literature at 
all. The problem of scripts, too, is almost as complex. The 
eleven major script systems, used in addition to the Perso- 
Arabic and Roman, are Nagari, Bengali, Assamese, Manipu- 
ri, Oriya, Telugu, Kannada, Tamil, Malayalam, Gujarati and 
Gurumukhi. : 
Then there is the oral tradition, the majestic presence of 
the spoken word, which even today is far from being 
superseded. “Talking” books, as opposed to written ones, 
are still a familiar sight. Wandering minstrels board a train or 
gather in village fairs, and keep an audience spellbound with 
what they recount or chant. Even to this day, busy market- 
places in cities like Calcutta undergo a magical transforma- 
tion in the evening when groups of people assemble to listen 
to an episode of the Ramayana or the Mahabharata. 
The following figures give some idea of literary activities 
in the major Indian languages, as well as works written in

English, in which creative writing is negligible in India). 
There is also the fact that less than 7 per cent of India’s total 
population know an Indian language other than their own 
mother tongue although, since major language speakers are 
not solely confined to specific areas or towns, all the States 
and Union territories are multi-lingual. 
Hindi, because of the numbers of people who speak it, has 
been declared the official language of the country and every 
effort is being made to promote its development and use at 
the national level. The yearly output of publishing in Hindi 
1s second only to that in English. 
Proficiency in English, instead of hindering the growth 
and richness of expression in all the major Indian languages, 
has significantly contributed to it. Today, India ranks as the 
world’s third largest producer of books in English, after the 
United States of America and the United Kingdom. 
The principal factors governing publishing activities in a 
country are its literacy rate, the size and nature of its 
educated population and —since textbooks and other allied 
supplementary reading material are the mainstay of the book 
trade, especially in a developing country —its educational 
policies and programmes. While literacy and reading habits 
are nowhere synonymous, literacy remains the first pre- 
requisite for the growth of a reading programme. 
The last Indian census taken in 1981 shows the country’s 
literacy rate to be about 37 per cent, registering an increase of 
nearly 7 per cent over the previous figures of 1971. This

Engrossed in a book, a traveller waits for his

Magazines pour from the press at a modern 
printing plant at Faridabad, 40 km south of 
Delhi. According to Unesco’s Statistical Year- 
book, India consumed 388,000 tonnes of news- 
print, printing and writing paper in 1984, more 
than twice as much as in 1970.

increase does not mean that there has been an appreciable fall 
in the number of illiterates in the country. On the contrary, 
due to a considerable expansion of population figures during 
the decade, India’s illiterate population has increased by as 
many as 48 million. 
This partly explains an apparent paradox. Despite the fact 
that India is one of the leading book producing countries, its 
per capita publishing figures remain far below the world 
average. Similarly, the consumption of books per person per 
year is as little as 32 pages in India, as against an average of 
2,000 pages in the industrially advanced countries. As re- 
gards print-runs, the Indian average still lags far behind the 
international average—books in Indian languages rarely ex- 
ceed a print-run of 1,000 copies, while those in English do 
rather better with print-runs of between 1,000 and 2,000 
copies. 
This notwithstanding, the progress achieved in recent 
years, especially since Independence, gives grounds for opti- 
mism about the future of printing and publishing in India. 
Today, India’s printing industry is on the threshold of a 
revolution as an increasing number of printers are switching 
from hand composition to mechanical or photographic type- 
setting with high-grade equipment. However, the over- 
whelming majority of printing presses operative in India are 
stil] letterpress, the rest being sheet-fed offset litho machines, 
mostly single colour. While much of this equipment is 
imported, India has now started to manufacture a wide 
variety of presses, offset as well as letterpress. 
Considering that Gutenberg’s epoch-making invention, 
introduced to India in 1557 by a Jesuit missionary, took only 
a little over a hundred years to reach the country in an age 
when communications were much slower than today, it 
seems likely that new technologies will take a fraction of that 
time to spread not only through the big towns, but to the 
rural areas. Already, desktop publishing is making inroads, 
with the introduction of personal computers and laser 
printers. 
Moreover, publishing has been introduced as a course of 
study in several Indian universities, and there are in-service 
training facilities for editorial and production personnel. 
Various professional institutions, in the public as well as the 
private sectors, offer annual awards and other material bene- 
fits to encourage good writing and excellence in printing. 
Book fairs and exhibitions are now held all over the country, 
and increasing numbers of books are being translated from 
one Indian language to another. =

### 79623: First impressions: Arabic early printed texts

  
First impressions 
Arabic early printed texts 
BY CAMILLE ABOUSSOUAN 
Above, early 17th-century punches for making 
Arabic type, designed by Lebanese craftsmen at 
the Maronite College of Rome. They were 
brought to France in 1614 by the French diplo- 
mat and ambassador to Rome, Frangois Savary 
de Bréves, who intended to set up an “Oriental 
Languages Printing House”, and are today pre- 
served in the Imprimerie Nationale, Paris. 
  
CAMILLE ABOUSSOUAN, Lebanese writer and diplomat, was formerly 
his country’s permanent delegate to Unesco and vice-chairman of Unesco’s 
Executive Board. A bibliophile specializing in works of the 16th, 17th and 18th 
centuries, be is the author of many studies on the history of Lebanon and the 
Near East. This article is an abridged version of an essay which appeared in Le 
livre et le Liban jusqu’d 1900, 4 work published under Mr. Aboussouan’s 
direction to accompany an exhibition, held at Unesco’s Paris HQ in 1982, on 
the history of the book in Lebanon. 
RABIC characters made their first appearance in a 
printed book in 1486, when a Dominican monk 
named Martin Roth printed at Erhard Reuwich’s 
workshop in Mainz the famous account of the “Voyage and 
Pilgrimage Overseas to the Holy Sepulchre of the Holy City 
of Jerusalem, written and recorded in Latin by Bernhard von 
Breydenbach”. In this original work, the narrative is in- 
terwoven with novel descriptions of scenes fram urban life. 
Erhard Reuwich is thought to have drawn and engraved the 
plates in this book, which contains the first example of a 
complete Arabic alphabet in a printed work, together with a 
Latin transliteration, a map of Jerusalem and a charming 
engraving showing Lebanese, dubbed Syrians, in a vineyard, 
and wearing magnificent turbans. 
This, however, was only the reproduction of an Arabic 
alphabet. It was not until the reconquest of Granada several 
years later that the need for a printed Arabic text arose in 
Europe. In 1492, the last Muslim kingdom of Andalusia fell 
to the Spanish Catholic sovereigns Ferdinand and Isabella,

who had by their marriage united the two powerful king- 
doms of Aragon and Castile. Anxious to bring the Andalu- 
sians back to Christianity, the Spanish rulers ordered mis- 
sionaries to evangelize the country again. It soon became 
apparent that this goal could not be attained without using 
the Arabic language. In 1505, Archbishop Fernando de 
Talavera, the first prelate appointed to the new diocese, had 
two Arabic textbooks printed for use by missionaries who 
could not speak that language. The title of the first was: Arte 
para ligeramente saber la lengua araviga (“The art of learn- 
ing the rudiments of the Arabic language”); that of the 
second: Vocabulista aravigo en letra castellana (“Arab glos- 
sary in Castilian characters”). Their author, the scholar 
Pedro de Alcald, a native of the prestigious university city of 
Alcali de Henares near Madrid, wrote them in Latin script. 
The typeface is Gothic. 
The first twenty-one pages of the Arte are given over to 
grammar, and the next twenty-seven consist of Catholic 
prayers in Arabic, instructions for confession in Spanish and 
in Arabic, -the ordinary of the mass, and instructions for 
votive masses, all in Arabic. By way of introduction to the 
vocabulary, a short three-page note explains the author’s 
method of transcription: the vocabulary is in alphabetical 
order, but under each letter three separate categories contain 
first verbs, then nouns and lastly adverbs, conjunctions and 
prepositions. The verbs are given in three forms: present, 
perfect and imperative; nouns are given in both the singular 
and the plural. 
This work, which is a curiosity in the history of both 
linguistics and typography, is also the first and perhaps the 
most practical of all attempts to transcribe Arabic into Latin 
characters. The alphabet on the twentieth page is in north 
African script, and the language taught in both of Pedro de 
Alcal®’s works is the vernacular, which the Spanish mis- 
sionaries needed to communicate with the converted Moors. 
In a few places, the author indicates differences between this 
and the written language. 
As in Breydenbach’s book, the Arabic alphabet is thus 
reproduced, together with its Latin pronunciation, but it is 
transcribed from the Maghrebian calligraphy also found in 
Agostino Giustiniani’s magnificent Psalterium Hebraeum, 
Graecum, Arabicum, et Chaldaicum, the first polyglot Psal- 
ter, which was published in 1516 at Genoa (then a major 
printing and paper manufacturing centre) in five languages: 
Hebrew, Greek, Arabic, Chaldean (Syriac) and Latin. 
Agostino Giustiniani (1479-1536) belonged to the Ge- 
noese branch of the Giustiniani, one of the great families of 
northern Italy. A Dominican who became the bishop of 
Nebbio in Corsica, he was a learned student of Oriental 
languages and a friend of great humanists such as Pico della 
Mirandola, Erasmus and Sir Thomas More. 
Giustiniani was the author of an audacious project to 
publish a polyglot edition of the Bible in Hebrew, Greek, 
Arabic, Syriac and Latin, which would make known all 
existing versions of the Bible and enable them to be com- 
pared, while also serving as an instrument for studying these 
languages. He began with the Psalter, and when this was not 
“a commercial success, the project was abandoned. Even so, it 
was a remarkable achievement for the time. 
The preparation of this masterly work was an arduous 
task, as Giustiniani noted in his dedication to Pope Leo X, 
who had written the preface: “Our work has been long ...”. 
This can easily be imagined. At that time no matrices or fonts 
of Arabic type existed; the alphabets in the books of Brey- 
denbach and Pedro de Alcald were printed from woodcuts, 
and there were few Hebrew typefaces. Moreover, the work 
had to be revised by several proof-readers with knowledge of 
at least three non-European languages. 
It seems that Giustiniani had already ordered and tran- 
scribed the texts to be published as early as 1506. It 1s more 
than likely that the design and casting of the characters had 
been done long before the publication of the Psalter, which 
thus pushes back even further the creation of the first printed 
text in movable Arabic type. 
The Arabic text alone occupies a forty-one-line column 
containing an average of 160 words per page for 246 pages. 
The two examples of initial letters in Arabic which appear in 
the book are very beautiful —a flowered “aleph” in a frame 
and a “tah” similarly adorned. These are certainly the first 
ornamental letters in Arabic printing. 
In 1529, Master Geofroy Tory, a French typographer, 
engraver and author from Bourges, published his fine treatise 
on typography, the Champflenry (see page 11), in which he 
attacked the use of the Gothic typeface, and included an 
Arabic alphabet with a key to its pronunciation. Meanwhile, 
the German, Latin and Spanish editions of Breydenbach, and 
its French translation by Nicolas le Huen, regularly repro- 
duced the Arabic alphabet of the 1486 edition, as did Sébas- 
tien Mamerot’s work entitled “The journeys overseas of the 
noble Godefroy de Bouillon who was King of Jerusalem. Of 
the good King Saint Louis and of several virtuous princes”, 
which was published in the late fifteenth century. 
In 1538, the French humanist Guillaume Postel, who had 
accompanied the embassy sent by King Francois I to Con- 
stantinople, and who styled himself “The Cosmopolitan”, or 
“Citizen of the World” as we should say nowadays, publish- 
ed his “Arabic Grammar” in Parts, the first of its kind to be 
printed. u

### 79624: L'Encyclopédie: an eighteenth-century best-seller

«L’ENCYCLOPEDIE » 
An eighteenth-century best-seller 
S soon as the first volume of the first edition of the 
A supreme work-of the Enlightenment, Diderot’s En- 
cyclopédie, reached the subscribers, in 1751, it be- 
came apparent to the authorities in France that the book was 
dangerous. 
It did not merely provide information about everything 
from A to Z; it recorded knowledge according to philoso- 
phic principles expounded by d’Alembert, the co-editor, in 
his “Preliminary Discourse”. Although he formally ac- 
knowledged the authority of the Church, d’Alembert made 
it clear that knowledge came from the senses and not from 
Rome or Revelation. The great ordering agent was reason, 
which combined sense data, working with the sister faculties 
of memory and imagination. Thus everything man knew 
derived from the world around him and the operations of his 
own mind. 
The Encyclopédie made the point graphically, with an 
engraving of a tree of knowledge showing how all the arts 
and sciences grew out of the three mental faculties. Philoso- 
phy formed the trunk of the tree, while theology occupied a 
remote branch, next to black magic. Thus Diderot and. 
d’Alembert presented their work as both a compilation of 
information and a manifestation of philosophie. They meant 
to merge those two aspects of the book, to make them seem 
like two sides of the same coin: Encyclopedism; and the men 
behind it became known not merely as collaborators but as 
Encyclopedists. Traditional learning, they implied, amount- 
ed to nothing but prejudice and superstition. 
So beneath the bulk of the Encyclopédie’s twenty-eight 
folio volumes and the enormous variety of its 71,818 articles 
and 2,885 plates lay an epistemological shift that transformed 
the topography of everything known to man. 
The Encyclopédie was a product of its time, of mid- 
eighteenth-century France, when writers could not discuss 
social and political questions openly, in contrast to the 
prerevolutionary era, when a tottering government permit- 
ted a good deal of frank discussion. The book’s radical 
element did not come from any prophetic vision of the 
far-off French and industrial revolutions but from its at- 
tempt to map the world of knowledge according to new 
boundaries, determined by reason and reason alone. As its 
title page proclaimed, it claimed to be a “dictionnaire raison- 
né des sciences, des arts et des métiers” —that is, to measure 
all human activity by rational standards and so to provide a 
basis for rethinking the world. 
Contemporaries had no difficulty in detecting the purpose 
of the book, which its authors acknowledged openly in key 
articles. Diderot and d’Alembert had laid out such pleasant 
paths through the arid expanses of knowledge that one could 
merely follow their lead, stopping now and then to enjoy the 
flowers along the way, and still have the satisfaction of 
belonging to the intellectual vanguard. One did not even 
have to read many other books, for the Encyclopédie was a 
library unto itself. The editors did not list the works that it 
rendered obsolete, but anyone who consulted its Discours 
préliminaire would have no difficulty in distinguishing be- 
tween the heavy tomes of traditional learning and the stream- 
lined, modern model. From the appearance of the first 
28 
 
volume in 1751 until the great crisis of 1759, the Encyclopé- 
die was denounced by defenders of the old orthodoxies and 
the Old Régime, by Jesuits, Jansenists, the General Assemb- 
ly of the Clergy, the Parlement of Paris, the king’s council, 
and the pope. The denunciations flew so thick and fast, in 
articles, pamphlets, and books as well as official edicts, that 
the Encyclopédie seemed doomed. But the publishers had 
invested a fortune in it, and they had powerful protectors, 
notably Chrétien-Guillaume de Lamoignon de Malesherbes, 
the liberal Directeur de la librairie, who superintended the 
book trade during the crucial years between 1750 and 1763. 
The scandal continued to sizzle and spread as volumes 3 to 
7 appeared and as skilful polemicists like Charles Palissot and 
Jacob-Nicolas Moreau fanned the flames on the side of the 
priests. On the other side, Voltaire loaned his pen and his 
prestige to the cause; and Diderot and d’Alembert found the 
ranks of their collaborators swelling with other illustrious 
writers, including most of the men who were beginning to be

Boulanger, Morellet, Quesnay, Damilaville, Naigeon, Jau-

Buffon, whose works they cited constantly, though it seems 
that neither wrote anything expressly for the Encyclopédie. 
Nothing could have been better for business than the 
continued controversy and the volunteer corps of authors. 
The publishers had envisaged a first edition of 1,625 copies, 
but the subscriptions poured in so fast that they increased it 
three times, until it reached 4,255 copies in 1754. 
The Encyclopédie became smaller in size and cheaper in 
price as it progressed from edition to edition.? While the 
format shrank from folio to quarto and octavo, the sub- 
scription price fell and the size of the print-runs increased. 
Having satisfied the “quality market”, the publishers tried to 
reach a broader public by producing in quantity.

however, because even the cheapest edition would have 
seemed expensive to the common people. The book re- 
mained beyond the purchasing power of peasants and arti- 
sans, even though some of them may have consulted it in 
cabinets littéraires (reading clubs). 
Diderot and his collaborators had done their share of the 
work, but that was only the beginning of a long process 
which culminated around 1780 with the reproduction and 
distribution of their copy on a mass scale throughout Eu- 
rope. The text that reached the general reading public, if not 
the masses, differed somewhat from theirs, however, because 
it, too, suffered from the strains of the production process. 
In his prospectus for the quarto edition (1777-1779), 
Joseph Duplain, a Lyonnais bookseller who managed the 
enterprise, had promised not only to reprint the original text 
in 1ts entirety but also to improve it in three ways: to correct 
its numerous typographical and factual errors; to add a great 
deal of new material; and to blend the four folio volumes of 
the Supplément® into it. He never intended to produce a 
literal copy of the first folio edition but rather to create a 
superior version of it—or at least to persuade the public that 
he had done so. The correcting, augmenting and blending 
would require a great deal of editorial work, so the contracts 
provided for a rédacteur. Duplain gave this job to the Abbé 
Jean-Antoine de Laserre, an Oratorian priest and a minor 
literary figure in Lyons. Laserre therefore became the suc- 
cessor of Diderot and the intermediary through which Dide- 
rot’s text reached most of its readers in the eighteenth 
century. ) 
For the most part he left the text alone, not because he 
respected it but because he did not have time to make 
changes. He worked at a furious pace, cutting out references 
to the eight volumes of plates that were not to be included in 
the quarto, attaching snippets from the Suppléments to the 
main body of the book by bits of his own prose, and reading 
over the final amalgam of printed and manuscript copy that’ 
was to be mailed out to the printers. As a half dozen printing 
shops were working on different volumes at the same time, 
he could hardly keep up with their demand for copy. 
Having sent for copy, presses, type, ink, paper, ink-ball 
leathers, candles, quills, imposing stones, galleys, chases, and 
a hundred other articles, the printing shop needed men to put

the matter in motion. It ordered the workers pretty much as 
it ordered the equipment and ran into the same problems of 
supply and demand. But it also had to cope with the 
peculiarities of printers as human beings. They had no notion 
of joining a firm. Instead, they worked by the job, coming 
and going according to the availability of tasks and their own 
inclination. For printing was a tramping trade. Men went 
where they could find work, even if they had to hike 
hundreds of kilometres. When work abounded, they some- 
times changed jobs in order to collect travel money or simply 
by “caprice”, as they put it. They came and went at a furious 
pace during the Encyclopédie boom, which sent repercus- 
sions throughout the migratory circuits of France, Swit- 
zerland, and parts of Germany, producing as much competi- 
tion for workers as for paper. 
Psychologically, nonstandardized work must have differ- 
ed considerably from the kind of work that was then being 
imposed on the labouring classes in England. The pace of 
work in the factories was set by clocks and bells, by the 
opening and closing of gates, by fines and beatings, and 
ultimately by the production process itself; for later, in 
assembly-line production, the men were reduced to “hands”, 
and work streamed past them in an endless, undifferentiated 
flow. The compositors and pressmen worked at their own 
pace. They exerted some control over their production. 
Some mastery over the production process did not mean 
that the workers developed any special affection for the real 
masters of it. The bourgeois retained most of the power and 
manipulated it brutally, by hiring and firing, while the 
workers responded with the few devices at their disposal. 
Although they may have felt some pride in their craft, they 
took shortcuts and compromised on quality when it made 
labour easier. The results can be seen in any copy of the 
Encyclopédie today —clear, crisp typography for the most 
part, but margins askew here, pages misnumbered there, 
uneven register, unsightly spacing, typographical errors, and 
smudges —all of them testimony to the activity of anony- 
mous artisans two centuries ago. 
In the era of the handmade book there existed a ty- 
pographical consciousness that disappeared sometime after 
the advent of automatic typesetting and printing. Like their 
forerunners of the Renaissance, the compositors of the 
Encyclopédie made lines by transferring type from cases to 
composing sticks; they made pages by moving lines from the 
composing sticks to galleys; and they made formes by 
imposing the pages in a chase. Compositorial practices could 
go no further in the direction of speed and efficiency until 
the introduction of mechanization, in the form of cold-metal 
typesetting machines during the 1820s, Linotype in the 
1880s, and electronic composition today. Presswork, too, 
did not advance by any great leaps forward in technology 
before the adoption of the cylinder press from 1814 and 
steam power in the 1830s. The Encyclopédie was printed on 
the venerable common press, in essentially the same way that 
books had been printed for the previous two or three 
hundred years. 
A whole world had to be set into motion to bring the book: 
into being. Ragpickers, financiers, and philosophers all 
played a part in the making of a work whose corporeal 
existence corresponded to its intellectual message. As a 
physical object and as a vehicle of ideas, the Encyclopédie 
synthesized a thousand arts and sciences; it represented the 
Enlightenment, body and soul. n 
1. In January 1759, the procureur général of the Parlement of Paris warned that behind 
the Encyclopédie hovered a conspiracy to destroy religion and undermine the State. The 
Parlement promptly banned its sale and appointed a commission to investigate it. But 
authority over the printed word in France belonged to the king. On 8 March 1759, the 
Conseil d’Etat reaffirmed the king's authority by revoking the book’s privilege and 
forbidding the publishers to continue it. The Encyclopédie went onto the Index 
librorum prohibitorum, the list of books banned by the Roman Catholic Church, on 5 
March, 1759, and on 3 September Pope Clement XII warned all Catholics who owned 
it to have it burned by a priest or to face excommunication. 
2. In addition to the six versions of Diderot’s basic text (three reprints of the original 
folio edition, one quarto and one octavo edition), totalling almost 24,000 copies before 
1789, there were two quite different works that used it as a point of departure: Félice’s 
Encyclopédie d’Yverdon, printed between 1770 and 1780 at 1,600 copies, and Panck- 
oucke’s Encyclopédie méthodigue, begun in 1782 at a print-run of approximately 5,000 
copies. 
3. The Supplément, in four folio volumes of text and one of plates, was published in 
Paris and Amsterdam in 1776 and 1777, in a print-run of 5,250 copies. It had no formal 
connection with the original Encyclopédie and involved a new group of contributors 
and publishers,

### 79625: Printing and society in China and the West

Printing and society 
in China and the West 
BY TSIEN TSUEN-HSUIN 
Copyright © 1985, 
Cambridge University Press 
F all the products from the ancient 
world, few can compare in signif- 
icance with the Chinese inven- 
tions of paper and printing. 
Paper was invented in China some time 
before the Christian era. From early in the 
second century AD its manufacture became 
improved, using new materials and superior 
techniques. By the third century it had be- 
come widely used in China itself and had 
begun to migrate across the Chinese bor- 
ders; it reached the Western world only just 
prior to the modern age. Printing from 
wood blocks was first practised by the Chi- 
nese around 700 AD, and movable type was 
used several centuries earlier than Guten- 
berg. Even the indelible ink of lampblack, 
which has been manufactured in the West 
under the misnomer “Indian Ink”, can be 
traced back to Antiquity in Chinese civi- 
lization. It was the introduction of these 
ingenious elements that made possible mass 
production of written records for wide 
circulation. 
Paper was not invented expressly for: 
writing, as has often been presumed. It was 
extensively used in China in the fine and 
decorative arts, at ceremonies and festivals, 
for business transactions and records, mon- 
etary credit and exchange, personal attire, 
household furnishings, sanitary and medical 
purposes, recreations and entertainments. It 
was not used for writing until perhaps early 
in the first century AD, and even then did 
not entirely replace the more cumbersome 
bamboo and wood slips as the chief materi- 
als for making books until the third century. 
But when it came, the use of paper enabled 
books to be cheaper and more portable, 
though their extensive production and wide 
distribution was not possible until the in- 
vention of printing. 
There is a long history of pre-printing 
techniques in China, including the use of 
seals for stamping on clays and later on silk 
and paper, of stencils to duplicate designs on 
textiles and paper, and of the inked impres- 
sions taken from stone inscriptions. All 
these processes gradually led to more effi- 
cient methods of the mechanical multiplica- 
tion of copies and to printing. Movable type 
was introduced by the middle of the elev-

The invention of papermaking is traditionally 
attributed to Tshai Lun, a Chinese court official 
who developed the idea of forming a sheet of 
paper from the macerated bark of trees, hemp 
waste, and rags. In the 18th-century picture, 
above, Tshai Lun is shown surrounded by 4 
attendants and with brushes and writing tools 
before him. In foreground are a pig and a chick- 
en. According to legend these animals were the 
first to separate the wet paper sheets with snout 
or beak.

enth century and multi-colour printing 
some time in or before the twelfth century. 
The movable type was first made of earthen- 
ware, but later various other materials, in- 
cluding wood, metal, and a variety of ce- 
ramics, were also adopted. 
Because of the great number of characters 
in written Chinese, woodblock printing was 
used far more often than movable type for 
book. production in China until recent 
times. Wood blocks were simpler and more 
economical, and could be stored easily and 
were readily available when a reprint was 
needed; movable type was preferred only 
for large-scale production of voluminous 
books. Nevertheless, both wood blocks and 
movable type have gradually given way, 
since the mid-nineteenth century, to the 
modern printing press. 
The prerequisites for a useful invention 
included both the physical and the mental 
readiness for the event; besides a creative 
mind and a popular demand, proper materi- 
als and the essential basic techniques must 
be available. Since all the material facilities 
for the invention were present in Europe as 
well as in China, why did the invention 
occur in one civilization but not the other? 
The early use of printing in China was 
chiefly due to the early invention of paper, 
the specialized use made of seals and rub- 
bings for duplication, the greater need for 
mechanical aid in duplicating texts written 
in a complex ideographic script, the standar- 
dization of Confucian texts used for civil 
service examinations and, finally, the de- 
mand for great quantities of Buddhist scrip- 
tures which could not be met by hand- 
copying. In the West, paper was not in- 
troduced until a rather late date, seals were 
not used as duplication devices, rubbing was 
not known until fairly recently, while print- 
ers were restricted by craft unions or guilds. 
The relative simplicity of the alphabetic 
script also lessened the need for a mechani- 
cal duplication aid. 
Thus the materials and techniques neces- 
sary for the invention of printing were ei- 
ther not developed, or did not lead in the 
direction of a printing process. Further- 
more, there was no such incentive or de- 
mand for huge quantities of copies as devel-

oped in connection with Buddhism; the 
needs that did exist could be met by hand- 
copying. Until all these factors were 
changed in the middle of the fifteenth cen- 
tury, the threshold for the invention of 
printing was not reached in Western society. 
_ Printing facilitated the economical mass 
production and distribution of books and 
had profound effects upon European 
thought and society in the late fifteenth and 
early sixteenth centuries. It stimulated the 
spirit of the Renaissance and the Reforma- 
tion, which in its turn promoted further 
development of papermaking and printing 
until there was a flourishing publishing in- 
dustry. It also helped to establish national 
languages and indigenous literature, and 
even to encourage nationalism itself; it pop- 
ularized education, spread literacy, and in- 
creased the chances of social mobility. In 
short, almost everything in the progress of 
modern civilization can be linked in one 
way or another to the introduction and 
development of printing in the Western 
world. 
Mass production of texts increased their 
chance of survival or preservation and re- 
duced the probability of their loss through 
neglect or the destruction of single collec- 
tions. But it did more than this. Wider 
distribution of texts and the enlargement of 
the reading public meant that the clergy’s 
monopoly of learning was challenged by 
laymen, including lawyers, merchants, 
tradesmen, and artisans, who became im- 
portant consumers of books. At the same 
time, the pride of place hitherto taken by 
religious works was gradually superseded 
by texts of humanist authors. With this 
increased readership and a broader spec- 
trum of subjects, scholars became more 
aware of inconsistencies and contradictions 
in hallowed texts, weakening their faith in 
the validity of old views, and setting the 
stage for the advancement of new learning. 
The standardization of texts resulting 
from printing stood in contrast to the cor- 
ruption that was bound to be present in all 
hand-copied texts. The printing press does 
not guarantee freedom from textual errors, 
but the requirement for multiple proof- 
reading before sending to the press and the 
distribution of errata to correct mistakes 
after printing, paved the way for the im- 
provement of future editions. The editorial 
functions of the early printers also brought 
about a degree of systematization of book 
format not to be found in the age of scribes, 
and this gradually created a habit of system- 
atic thinking by readers, as well as promot- 
ing the organization of knowledge in many 
diverse fields. 
For their part publishers naturally en- 
couraged the growing use of the vernacular 
which brought an expanding market. As 
books became easier to publish in national 
languages, printing stabilized the vocabu- 
lary, grammar, structure, spelling, and 
punctuation of each, and, furthermore, pro-

moted its use. Once fiction was printed and 
widely circulated, the common language be- 
came firmly established; this, in its turn, 
facilitated the eventual growth of specific 
national literatures and cultures. 
The popularization of education and the 
spread of literacy were also closely related 
to the expansion of printing. As books be- 
came cheaper and easier to obtain, more 
people were able to gain access to the print- 
ed texts which eventually affected their out- 
look on the world and their position in it. 
And, naturally enough, easier access to 
printed material promoted the rise of litera- 
cy, which stimulated a still greater demand 
for more books. 
In general, printing in Europe from the 
sixteenth century onwards was vigorously 
expanded, supporting many drastic and rad- 
ical changes in thought and society. On the 
other hand, the progress of printing in Chi- 
na and other nations in East Asia was com- 
paratively constant with modest changes 
occurring within a stable tradition. These 
diversities reflect the distinctive characters 
of Eastern and Western cultures, especially 
their attitudes towards material life, 
Chinese society has long been dominated 
by the Confucian tradition, which concerns 
itself primarily with proper human relation- 
ships and social order by way of moral 
teachings and ethics, rather than with pursu- 
ance of material advance and extreme 
changes in society. The high degree of social 
and cultural stability over long periods in 
Chinese history, especially from the thir- 
teenth to the nineteenth century, contrasts 
greatly with the constant turmoil of life and 
intellectual unrest during the same period in 
the West. 
Such different environments in China and 
the West were certainly bound to affect the 
role of printing, and in this sense printing 
was not only shaped by the political and 
social conditions of the time; it also exerted 
an equal effect on those conditions. n

blanket: the sheet of rubber or other flexible 
material used to cover the impression cylinder of 
an offset printing press. 
block: an illustration, halftone or line art, as en- 
graved in metal for letterpress printing. 
carbon tissue: paper coated with gelatin that can 
be rendered photosensitive and exposed to light 
before being applied to a metal surface of any’ 
shape. 
chase: in letterpress printing, a steel frame in 
which metal type and blocks are locked for prin- 
ting or platemaking. 
composing stick: in hand composition, a tool in 
which each line of type is assembled and justified. 
composition: both the setting of type and the 
arranging of the type on the page. Some typeset- 
ting systems can set whole pages at a time, while 
on others each column of type must be set and the 
result assembled as a page. 
composition program: a set of instructions for a 
computer-driven typesetter. 
compositor: a person or company who sets type, 
also referred to as the typesetter. 
continuous tone: an image that has greys or 
shades of colour, and which cannot be reproduced 
in that form by most printing methods, because 
the thickness of ink cannot be varied during 
printing. (See halftone.) 
cursive: applied to flowing typefaces that re- 
semble script hand writing, with connected strokes 
and curved lines. 
cylinder or flat-bed press: a printing machine on 
which the type forme is carried on a flat bed under 
a revolving paper-bearing cylinder. (See rotary 
press.) 
digital or digitized type: that which is drawn with 
the aid of a computer as steps on a grid, and stored 
as digital dot or line patterns, rather than as photo- 
graphic images. If the dot or line density is high 
enough (see resolution), the result can look clean 
and crisp. 
dot matrix printer: forms characters by firing a 
series of small needles at the printing ribbon, so 
transferring dots to the paper. 
face or typeface: a complete set of letters and 
other characters in a particular design or style. 
Typefaces come in families of different weights 
(light, medium, bold), different point sizes, and 
different slants (roman, italic, other oblique). 
font or fount: a complete set of the characters in 
one typeface and size. 
forme or form: metal type and blocks for illustra- 
tions assembled in a chase and ready for printing 
or platemaking. 
galley: a copy of typeset material arranged in 
columns instead of made up into pages. The term 
comes from the galley or tray of type and the copy 
of typeset material that was traditionally made by 
hand for use in proofreading before the press ran. 
Gothic or black-letter: a general term for a family 
of typefaces with dark, angular characters made up 
of contrasting thick and thin strokes; developed in 
the late Middle Ages in Germany and the normal 
text type in Northern Europe in the early years of 
printing. 
gravure or intaglio: any of various printing tech- 
niques using an etched or engraved plate.

Glossary 
halftone: an image that has been broken up into 
tiny dots, which when viewed from normal dis- 
tances create the illusion of continuous tone. 
hot metal: general term for typesetting machines 
casting type from molten metal. “Hot type” tech- 
nologies are being increasingly replaced by “cold 
type”, using photographic or electronic processes 
10 create an image. 
ink jet printer: forms characters by spraying a 
very fine stream of quick drying ink onto the 
material to be printed. Drops of ink are either 
electrostatically or thermally charged as they leave 
a tiny nozzle. 
input: data entered into a computer. 
integrated circuit: minute electrical circuits 
containing thousands of electronic components 
on a chip of silicon. 
justify: in text composition, to space out lines 
uniformly to the desired length, so creating a 
straight-sided column of text, as here. Unjustified 
text has a ragged edge on one or both sides of the 
column. 
laser printer: forms characters by depositing dots 
of carbon onto ordinary paper. A laser typesetter 
deposits points of light onto photographic paper. 
In each case, the characters which are output are 
made up of tiny dots. 
layout: the conceptual arrangement of the text 
and illustrations on a page. (Makeup is the actual 
physical or electronic page assembly.) 
letterpress: the primary form of printing, taking 
an impression on paper from an inked, raised 
(relief) printing surface. 
line art: illustrations containing only blacks or 
whites, with no intermediate tones, which can be 
reproduced without a screening process in the 
same way as text. 
lithography or litho: literally, “stonewriting”— 
printing from a dampened, flat surface using 
greasy ink, the principle being the mutual repul- 
sion of oil and water. Originally the printing 
surface was a porous stone but later a metal plate 
was used. : 
lower case: the small (miniscule) letters in a font of 
type, so named from the lower compartments of 
typecases used in letterpress hand composition, 
where the most frequently used letters were kept. 
The capitals, or upper case letters, were keptinthe 
upper compartments. 
magazine: the case holding the matrices (moulds) 
on a typesetting machine. 
matrix: the individual brass character mouldsona 
typesetting machine. 
(micro)chip: a tiny slice of silicon with electronic 
circuits etched into it. 
offset: the development of lithography by which 
the image is not printed direct from the plate but 
“offset” first onto a rubber-covered cylinder, 
which then performs the printing operation. (See 
blanket.) 
output: data generated by computer in the re- 
quired format. 
photocomposition or phototypesetting: the 
production of printing copy, on film or paper, by 
photographic means. 
plate: the metal, paper or plastic sheet containing 
the image to be placed on the printing press. 
platen: a flat plate in a letterpress printing ma- 
chine that presses the paper against the type forme. 
platen press: a letterpress printing machine which 
presses two flat surfaces together to make the 
impression. 
point: a measure of size used in layout and type- 
setting, most often used to indicate the size of 
type. 
print-run: the number of copies of a publication 
to be printed. 
program: a numbered list of instructions to make 
a computer do a particular job. 
register: the correct alignment of the separate 
plates in colour printing. 
resolution: in computers, the number of tiny 
squares on the screen which a particular system 
can control. The higher the resolution, the sharper 
the image, thus giving better quality type and 
graphics for printing purposes. 
rotary press: a machine for printing from a revol- 
ving cylindrical forme, usually onto a continuous 
reel of paper. 
rotogravure: a system of intaglio printing where- 
by ink contained in the cells of a printing cylinder 
are transferred to paper. 
screening: to break up images that have conti- 
nuous tones into patterns of tiny dots, with the 
darker tones represented by larger or denser dots. 
This can be done photographically, or electroni- 
cally with a scanning machine. (See halftone.) 
slug: a line of type or a blank line set on a 
typesetting machine. 
software: computer programs, as opposed to 
hardware, or the machinery itself. 
web: a continuous reel of paper, often used on 
printing machines instead of single sheets.
