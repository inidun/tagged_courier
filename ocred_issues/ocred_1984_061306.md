and put it back into the gutter where it

These words, which participants at the founding meeting 
of the Science Fiction Research Association, were astonished 
to find scrawled up one day on a blackboard in their con- 
ference room, were a sardonic comment on the long struggle 
of modern science fiction to emerge from the ghetto of the 
luridly illustrated pulp magazines of the 1920s to the 1940s 
to achievement of the status of serious literature. 
We owe an incalculable debt to the men who founded and 
wrote for these magazines, which the intellectual élite of the 
day dismissed scornfully as no more than a new emanation 
of the ‘“‘gutter press’. 
Against all the odds, they persisted in what, ironically, can 
now be seen as the educational mission of preparing the man 
in the street for the incredible scientific progress of the twen- 
tieth century. 
Whether we like it or not, we live in a century in which 
scientific advance has become the dominant influence on our 
lives and on the social fabric of our society. In the words of 
Horace L. Gold, founding editor of Galaxy Science Fiction, 
“‘Few things reveal so sharply as science fiction the wishes, 
hopes, fears, inner stresses and tensions of an era, or deter- 
mine its limitations with such exactness’. 
As some of our contributors point out, the origins of 
science fiction can be traced back to Antiquity. It is a genre 
which covers a wide field embracing fantasy (including 
monsters and aliens from space), ‘‘space operas’’ (the classic 
Western film transposed to space), time travel, the coloniza-

### 61396: Science and science fiction: co-explorers of reality

Science and science fiction 
 
HAT is science fiction? Prag- 
W matically, it is what a pub- 
lisher puts out as science fic- 
tion. But as a purist I will quote from 
my book The Cosmic Dancers a defini- 
tion that is particularly suited to the 
purpose of this article. 
“‘Science fiction is that class of fic- 
tion which contains the currents of 
change in science and society. It con- 
cerns itself with the critique, extension, 
revision, and conspiracy of revolution, 
all directed against static scientific 
paradigms. Its goal is to prompt a 
paradigm shift to a new view that will 
be more responsive and true to 
nature’’. 
As the definition implies, the impor- 
tance of science fiction arises from its 
choreography of the dance between 
science and reality; the best of science 
fiction continually prods science 
toward further discovery of the mean- 
ing of reality. ‘‘Do not adhere to fixi- 
ty’’, it seems to challenge. ‘The cur- 
rent paradigm, or world view, grew out 
of the past and is only adequate for the . 
past; new ways are needed to tackle the 
ever-unfolding present, let alone the 
future.” 
Thus the modern science fiction 
writer envisions a future world in which 
space travel is commonplace, a 
universe in which life is known in other 
star systems, cultures in which people 
routinely communicate via telepathy 
without sensory signals. Are such pro- 
jections legitimate challenges to our 
science or mere fantasy? Certainly 
there are fantasy elements that enhance 
the story lines, but there are also some 
profound challenges. A few examples 
may be revealing. 
¢ In Ursula Le Guin’s novel The 
Dispossessed, the hero Shevek is a 
scientist faced with the problem of im- 
proving communication between his

home planet and its neighbour. He 
responds by discovering the ‘‘ansible’’, 
a machine that makes instantaneous, 
signalless communication possible not 
only between the planets of his con- 
cern, but with remote planets of the 
galaxy as well. 
¢ In Ian Watson’s novel Miracle 
Visitors, the hero John Deacon in- 
vestigates sightings of UFOs, flying 
saucers. He finds an unexpected 
answer in the far reaches of his research 
on the nature of human consciousness. 
¢ In Robert Silverberg’s novel To 
Open The Sky, the leaders of a new 
scientific religion squarely fix the 
priorities that are necessary to so meet 
the threats of the present that they can 
have a future. The priorities? —to open 
the sky and to open the mind.

e In his novel Rendezvous with 
Rama, Arthur C. Clarke beautifully 
portrays an alien space colony. Implicit 
is a challenge: will humans remain far 
behind in that enterprise? 
*® In The Black Cloud, author Fred 
Hoyle depicts an alien life so fantastic 
that it not only faces us with the poten- 
tial variety of extraterrestrial life, but 
more importantly, it challenges us to 
consider the whole question of the 
origin and meaning of life. 
¢ In his novel Way Station, Clifford 
Simak portrays a humanity on the 
verge of a holocaust engendered by the 
“‘terror’’ that man carries within him. 
But the holocaust is avoided by a 
transformation of man with the help of 
a talisman and some wise intervention 
from the galactic council. We intuit

of redlity 
that the talisman, like the terror, may 
lie within us, the touchstone for the 
transformation of humanity. 
Such scenarios call for a response 
from science in vastly different direc- 
tions, from the outer reaches of space 
to the inner reaches of the mind and 
psyche of humankind. And in fact, 
science has responded favourably to 
challenges on both fronts; some of our 
best minds are involved in serious fron- 
tiers of research today to open the sky 
and to open the mind. 
Princeton physicist Gerard O'Neill 
originally suggested as a project in his 
freshman physics course that the 
students design a space colony. The in- 
itial results of this science-fiction ven- 
ture looked so good that the professor 
himself began serious calculations. As 
ad 
by Amit Goswami 
a result, we now know that we actually 
have the expertise and the raw 
materials to build a space colony. 
Perhaps the Soviet success with space 
stations and the American success with 
the space shuttle Challenger are the 
first steps toward building our own 
Rama. 
And Carl Sagan has publicized the 
continuing efforts of many serious 
scientists in the area of CETI, com- 
munication with extraterrestrial in- 
telligence. Some answers and many 
new questions, some examples of 
which are noted below, are coming out 
of these studies. 
* Although science fiction writers 
and scientists alike have speculated for 
decades about extraterrestrial in- 
telligence, there has until now been no

Third Kind (1977). 
direct evidence for even the existence of 
planets outside our solar system. But 
now new data pouring in from an 
orbiting infra-red astronomical 
laboratory are providing direct 
evidence that perhaps as many as forty 
nearby stars are surrounded by cosmic 
dust in the early stages of evolution into 
planets. Some of these, including one 
in the Vega system that is popular in 
science fiction, may very well develop 
life-supporting environments. 
® In research carried out at the 
University of Maryland, the meteorite 
Murchison, that fell into Australia in 
1969, was found to contain all five of 
the chemical bases needed for human 
genes. Does this provocative evidence 
indicate that life may exist elsewhere in 
the universe? 
* In a stranger-than-science-fiction 
theory of the origin of life, astronomer- 
science fiction writer Fred Hoyle has 
revived with many new twists the 
nineteenth-century panspermis theory; 
this is the theory that there are ‘‘seeds”’ 
of life continuously bombarding the 
Earth and other life-supporting planets 
that create and rejuvenate life. Hoyle, 
a respected scientist, seems to go 
beyond the challenge of science fiction 
in his most recent book The Intelligent 
Universe. 
Science’s efforts to open the mind 
are not far behind the challenge of 
science fiction either. In the mid-1970s, 
two Stanford Research Institute 
physicists, Russell Targ and Harold 
Puthoff, conducted rigorous ex- 
periments on telepathy in which one 
psychic draws a picture of a distant site 
that he ‘sees’ through the eyes of 
another psychic who is present at the 
site. Neither psychic knows in advance 
what site is to be visited; actually, the 
sites were chosen by a computer. »

» Likewise, to ensure objectivity the 
matching of the drawings and the sites 
was done by judges who did not know 
which drawings were done for which 
sites. In more recent repetitions of this 
experiment, which has been successful- 
ly replicated in dozens of independent 
laboratories, the matching is being 
done by a computer. 
If we potentially have the telepathic 
capacity that science fiction writers so 
routinely see in our future, what is the 
brain mechanism behind it? Premature 
question? Hardly. In 1982, University 
of Paris-Sud physicist Alain Aspect 
and his collaborators demonstrated 
conclusively that two photons—objects 
in the microscopic domain that obey 
the laws of the new physics, quantum 
mechanics—can communicate at a 
distance without exchanging signals. 
This action at a distance, technically 
called non-locality, is being heralded as 
one of the fundamental properties of 
quantum systems. 
Could distance viewing be the result 
of the brain’s non-locality, a non- 
locality that arises from a quantum 
- machinery that operates even at the 
macrolevel of the brain’s organization 
that we call the mind? Many physicists, 
among them Nobel laureate Eugene 
Wigner, think that quantum mechanics 
holds the key not only to our non-local 
experiences such as telepathy, but also 
to our consciousness itself. Some of the 
new research in the frontiers of con- 
sciousness, reviewed in The Cosmic 
Dancers, may truly be precursors of the 
science of the twenty-first century. 
Does this imply an ansible? Who 
knows? But the new scientific model of 
consciousness based on quantum 
mechanics suggests that beyond our in- 
dividual I-ness, our ego-consciousness,

there may be a unitive, commonly- 
shared primary consciousness, as fore- 
seen many years ago by Erwin 
Schrédinger, the co-discoverer of 
quantum mechanics; in his book What 
Is Life? Schrodinger declared, ‘‘Con- 
sciousness is a singular’’. This message 
from the new physics is clearly echoed 
in the science fiction of Arthur C. 
Clarke in his book Childhood’s End. 
“Imagine that every man’s mind is 
an island, surrounded by ocean. Each 
seems isolated, yet in reality all are link- 
ed by the bedrock from which they 
spring”’, 
The imminence of a nuclear 
holocaust incites pessimism in many 
people today; as in Simak’s novel, they 
see the terror within us all too well. But 
if we are all connected by a bedrock of 
unitive consciousness, we also have the 
talisman, the power of transformation, 
to transcend the terror to peace and 
harmony. 
By now it should be clear that in 
science fiction educators have an un- 
foreseen opportunity not only to instil 
enthusiasm in the hearts of their 
students for science, but also to en- 
courage them to follow the dance of 
reality with the music of both science 
and science fiction. For to cope with 
the realitites of the twenty-first cen- 
tury, we will need both the arts and the 
sciences. 
I shall never forget the time when I 
was confronted by a student in a con- 
ventional introductory physics course 
for non-scientists after I had finished a 
lecture that reviewed the meaning of 
relativity and quantum mechanics to 
our world view. ‘‘Professor,”’ the stu- 
dent said, ‘‘these concepts are 
fascinating. But the new physics seems 
to apply only to elementary particles. 
  
   
What is there for me, personally?” 
This was many years ago, and I 
couldn’t answer him then. 
Subsequently, however, I developed 
a course at the University of Oregon, 
aptly titled The Physics of Science Fic- 
tion, that uses readings from as many 
as fifty science fiction novels to in- 
troduce the principles and messages of 
both the classical and the new physics 
to non-scientists. The advantage of this 
approach is that science is no longer 
seen as isolated from our lives, a view 
that vexes many non-scientists like the 
student quoted above. 
Another reason why science fiction is 
relevant to today’s science classroom is 
the growing importance of futuristics 
in our global society. I suspect that 
science fiction started the subject of 
futuristics. It was in 1934 that the dean 
of science fiction, H.G. Wells, sug- 
gested that universities establish 
courses on human ecology. Science fic- 
tion writers examine future problems 
such as overpopulation, intelligent 
computers, and nuclear holocaust with 
such insight and reverberating detail 
that futurists and educators would be 
well advised to honour their wisdom. 
And the framework of immediate per- 
sonal impact in which that wisdom is 
couched can be employed by educators 
to focus the attention of today’s youth 
on the design of the future that will be 
theirs. 
Ultimately, the most common bond 
between science and science fiction, the 
one that makes them such good part- 
ners in the dance of reality, is imagina- 
tion. Nowhere is imagination, and the 
openness of mind that fosters imagina- 
tion, more essential than when we ex- 
plore the nature, structure, and destiny 
of reality itself. Both science and 
science fiction are engaged in the ex- 
The phenomenon of relativistic time dila- 
tion, which is central to Einstein’s theory 
of relativity, is a concept which students 
often find difficult to comprehend. In 
1905 Einstein wrote that ‘‘a clock fixed 
at the earth's equator will run slower by 
a very small amount than an identical 
clock fixed at one of the earth’s poles”. 
Many science fiction authors have made 
use of this scientific notion of time dila- 
tion, notably in tales of space travellers 
returning to Earth after a long voyage 
only to find that time has advanced mors 
quickly there and that they are aliens in 
a future society,

Each age produces its own myths and 
the most persistent myth of modern 
times is that our planet is being regularly 
visited by alien astronauts from outer 
space. In most cases the “flying 
saucers’’ in which they are seen ap- 
proaching turn out on investigation to be 
aircraft, meteors, artificial satellites or 
. weather balloons. This completely 
genuine photo shows how easy itis for 
reports of sightings of UFOs (Unidenti- 
fied Flying Objects) to arise; the “flying

ploration of space, time, life, the 
universe, and the place of our con- 
sciousness in the universe; both do it 
well, and with mutual attention, 
respect, and encouragement. And since 
imagination is one of the most impor- 
tant commodities for the classroom, I 
strongly urge the educator to consider a 
course on the science of science fiction 
for the high school or college cur- 
riculum. Benefits accrue from both the 
content and the dynamic vision of 
science fiction. : 
I will end with an example of how 
science fiction can lighten a lecture on 
the phenomenon of relativistic time 
dilation, the monumental discovery of 
Einstein that moving clocks run slower. 
Can time dilation serve love? Why, yes; 
witness the following letter written by a 
character in Joe Haldeman’s novel The 
Forever War. 
“William, 
All this is in your personnel file. But 
knowing you, you might just chuck it. 
So I made sure you’d get this note. 
Obviously, I lived. Maybe you will, 
too. Join me. 
I know from the records that you’re 
out at Sade-138 and won’t be back for 
a couple of centuries. No problem. 
 
I’m going to a planet they call Middle 
Finger, the fifth planet out from 
Mizar... 
It took all of my money, and all the 
money of five other old-timers, but we 
bought a cruiser from UNEF. And 
we’re using it as a time machine. 
So I'm on a relativistic shuttle, 
waiting for you. All it does is go out 
five light years and come back to Mid- 
dle Finger, very fast. Every ten years I 
age about a month. So if you’re on 
schedule and still alive, I'll only be 
twenty-eight when you get here. Hurry! 
I never found anybody else and I 
don’t want anybody else. I don’t care 
whether you’re ninety years old or thir- 
ty. If I can’t be your lover, I'll be your 
nurse.

have appreciated such an illuminating 
and friendly invasion of the science 
classroom! [|

How do you set about writing science fiction best-sellers? 
Who better to ask than the prolific and widely-acclaimed 
popularizer of science and science fiction author, Isaac 
Asimov? 
To date he has written or edited an astonishing total of 305 
books. Of these 187 are on non-fiction subjects, mainly 
scientific, but including books on history, geography, 
autobiography and 
literature; among them are 2 two-volume books on The Bible 
mythology, humour, light verse, 
and Shakespeare.   
He has also published 118 fictional works of which 69 are 
anthologies of works and stories by other authors. Of the re- 
maining 49, written entirely by Asimov himself, 2 are 
mystery novels, 6 are collections of mystery short stories, 20 
are collections of science fiction short stories and 21 are 
science fiction novels, including the best-selling Founda- 
tion’s Edge, 1982, and The Robots of Dawn, 1983. 
The list is still growing. This year will see the publication 
of two new non-fiction works: Asimov’s New Guide to 
Science, and Opus 300. 
  
quently asked of prolific writers is 
‘““Where do you get your ideas?’’ 
If one is a prolific science fiction writer, 
as I am, the question is likely to be 
rephrased into, ‘““Where do you get 
your crazy ideas?”’. 
The answer, in general, is a rather 
simple one. I think, and think, and 
think until something occurs to me, It’s 
by no means an easy task and if my 
dear wife, Janet, comes upon me when 
I happen to be lost in thought, her first 
impression (even after years of ex- 
perience with me) is that I’m in dread- 
ful pain. 
‘““What’s wrong?’’ she cries out in 
alarm. 
“I'm thinking”, 1 growl, 
And yet sometimes, [ must admit, an 
idea is thrust upon me by the outside 
world, On January 24, 1971, I attended 
a science fiction convention and was in 
the audience while two famous science 
fiction writers were discussing writing 
techniques. One thought that human 
reactions were more important than 
technological details, even in science 
fiction (and I agree with him). “‘If you 
have your motivations straight,”’ he 
said, ‘‘who cares about—uh— 
plutonium-186’. 
I laughed at this for the speaker’s 
memory had betrayed him. There is no 
such thing as plutonium-186, and there 
can’t be. It struck me, though, that I 
might write a story in which 
plutonium-186 did exist. It would come 
from another universe, of course, one 
in which the laws of nature were dif- 
ferent. Once here, the substance would 
I suppose that the question most fre- 
8 
by Isaac Asimov 
slowly absorb our laws of nature and 
become more and more unstable. If we 
could get an indefinite amount of such 
material from the other Universe, we 
could have a new and enormous source 
of no-cost energy. Of course, I would 
have to work out some serious 
drawback which would involve all 
Earth, perhaps all the Universe, in a 
dreadful danger. Would people then be 
willing to give up a source of cost-less 
energy? More and more things 
developed out of that one expression 
““plutonium-186°’. I ended with a novel 
called “The Gods Themselves’, 
published by Doubleday in 1972. 
Once I actually dreamed a book. On 
April 3, 1973, I awoke from a peculiar 
dream and at once told it to Janet who, 
as a psychiatrist, is professionally in- 
terested in dreams. I said, “I dreamed 
I was preparing an anthology of old 
science fiction stories I had read and 
loved when I was a teen-ager and I was 
re-reading them and loving them again. 
What a shame to have to wake up.” 
Janet said, “Well, why don’t you 
prepare such an anthology?”’’. 
So I did, and I got to reread all the 
old stories in real life (some of them 
didn’t hold up). The book was entitled 
“Before the Golden Age’ and was 
published by Doubleday on April 3, 
1974, the first anniversary of my 
dream. 
Last year I actually dreamed a 
mystery. I had followed someone into a 
restaurant and he disappeared before 
my eyes. There was a couch in the 
restaurant with its back to me, and 1 
finally found him, lying down on the 


### 61313: Where I get my ideas'

‘Where I get my ideas’ 
couch so that I could not see him from 
the doorway. In my dream I said, 
‘““What a wonderful idea for a Black 
Widower story!’’ (The Black Widower 
stories are a series of mysteries that I’ve 
been writing for over ten years.) When 
I woke up I thought up a story around 
that basic notion, called it ‘The 
Redhead’, wrote it, and sold it. It ap- 
peared in the October, 1984, issue of 
Ellery Queen’s Mystery Magazine. 
Sometimes, an editor deliberately 
challenges me. On March 17, 1941, 
John W. Campbell, editor of Astoun- 
ding Science Fiction handed me a 
quotation from an essay by Ralph 
Waldo Emerson: ‘If the stars should 
appear one night in a thousand years, 
how would men believe and adore; and 
preserve for many generations the 
remembrance of the City of God...” 
“I want you to write a story about 
this’’, said Campbell. ‘“Explain why 
the stars should only appear once in a 
long time, and what effect the ap- 
pearance would have on an intelligent 
race.” 
I wrote the story, called it 
““Nightfall’’ and it appeared in the 
September 1941 issue of the magazine. 
It is still my most famous single short 
story, and I wrote it when I was only 
21. 
These are exceptional cases, 
however. In my hundreds of stories of 
all lengths, I almost never had the help 
of a chance comment, of a dream, of an 
editorial suggestion, or of anything 
else. As I said, it then becomes a matter 
of hard thought.

I might begin thinking of a scientific 
development and wondering ‘“What 
if—17"’ 
In 1956, computers were much in the 
news. The existing ones were crude in- 
deed compared to what we have now, 
but already it was possible to speculate 
over how far they could improve. I 
began to speculate, “How far? How 
far? Would it eventually be able to do 
this? Do that? Surpass human beings, 
perchance?’”’ In my mind, at last, I 
came to what seemed to me to be the 
only possible conclusion. I promptly 
wrote the story ‘‘The Last Question” 
which appeared in the November, 
1956, issue of Science Fiction Quarter- 
ly. Of all the stories I have written, this 
one is my favourite. 
OrI might think of the human angle 
rather than the .technological one. 
What if computers became so common 
and integral a part of the human scene 
that people forgot how to do arithmetic 
in their head or by use of pen and 
paper; forgot even that it was possible 
to do it without a computer? It didn’t 
take long to think of a satirical treat- 
ment of the question and I wrote ‘“The 
Feeling of Power’’, which appeared in 
the February, 1958, issue of If. 
As you see, for me a story starts with 
a word, a phrase, a statement, a ques- 
tion. That acts like a seed out of which 
the rest of the story grows; or, if you 
prefer another metaphor, it acts as a 
piece of grit about which the pearl 
layers itself. 
Very frequently, the seed I must 
somehow originate makes up the end of 
the story. Most of my stories are 
mysteries in one fashion or another. A 
good number of them, both novels and 
short stories, are actual mysteries, 
orthodox and old-fashioned 
‘“‘whodunits’’. Some of my science fic- 
tion novels, though thoroughly science 
fiction, are also straightforward 
mysteries. Examples are ‘“The Caves of 
Steel’’ (Doubleday, 1954); “The Naked 
Sun” (Doubleday, 1957); and the very 
recent, ‘‘The Robots of Dawn” 
(Doubleday, 1983). 
Even those science fiction stories 
that are not straightforward mysteries 
have mystery elements to them. There 
is very often something to be found or 
uncovered, a particular person or place 
or motivation, something. 
In every case, I must think up the en- 
ding, the gimmick, the surprise that 
will fool the reader. 
Once I have my ending I’m home and 
safe. The next step is to think up a place 
to begin. In this connexion I always 
remember something that John Camp- 
bell once told me. He said, ‘““When you 
start a story and find you are having 
trouble, it is because you started too 
soon. Start later in the narrative.” | 
therefore start as late as I conveniently 
can. That does not take long to work 
out. 
Then, once I have my ending and my 
beginning, I start to write. To be sure, 
I don’t have anything in between the 
beginning and ending except, possibly, 
some vague scraps of conversation in 
my head. That doesn’t matter; I rely on 
making up the entire story—even a 
novel as complicated as ‘‘The Robots 
of Dawn’’—as I go along. I stay always 
one scene ahead of myself until, as I ap- 
proach the end, the last few scenes of 
the book reveal themselves and that is 
how I know I am approaching the end. 
What happens if half-way through 
I’m stuck? Well, that is very unlikely. 
As long as I know what the ending will 
be I have something to aim for, 
whether I am writing a short story or a 
novel, and as long as there is something 
to aim for, I can’t get totally lost,

The actual writing (once I know 
where I’m going) always turns out to be 
incredibly simple. I write as fast as I can 
type and it is never necessary to make 
more than a few minor revisions. 
I don’t actually visualize my stories; 
I’m not very good at visualization. I 
don’t really picture my characters or 
my scenes and 1 rarely describe 
anything I don’t absolutely have to. 
But I do hear. The entire story reels 
itself off in my head as I sit at the 
typewriter or word-processor and, | 
can hear it—especially the dialogue. It 
is as though something inside myself is 
dictating and I am merely typing down 
what I hear as fast as I can. 
For that reason, my stories and 
novels tend to be more conversation 
than action, more dialogue than 
events. I am criticized for that 
sometimes by people who (I can only 
presume) know more about writing 
than I do, and who therefore feel en- 
tirely free to castigate me for the lack of 
action, description and characteriza- 
tion in my fiction. 
But what can I do? I write as I write, 
and I urge no one else to do as I do. 
That is why, by the way, I approach 
an article such as this one with a certain 
reluctance. I have never taken courses 
in writing, never read books on the sub- 
ject. I majored in chemistry and not in 
English literature. 
I am, then, clearly not an authority 
in the subject. I don’t pretend to know 
how to write and I don’t hold myself up 
as a model to beginners in any way. In 
fact, I think I should be considered a 
horrible example for I feel that anyone 
who tries to do what I do is bound to 
make a mess of it. 
Once again—I do what I do simply 
because that is all I know how to do. Hl

### 61314: No science without fiction

No science without fiction 
by Alexander Kazantsev 
Concerned as it is with the new 
frontiers of science, it portrays 
the latest scientific achievements and 
sometimes even produces ideas which 
science can exploit; for the role of 
science fiction is not only to distract 
and entertain, but to announce the 
future, to foresee new scientific and 
technical achievements, to prompt and 
predict them. 
Ivan Efremov, the eminent Soviet 
scientist and science fiction writer, and 
author of many famous novels and 
tales, describes in his short story, A 
Shadow of the Past (1945) how, when 
old bare rocks were illuminated in a 
certain way, a lifelike three- 
dimensional image of a gigantic 
dinosaur appeared. This caused a 
public sensation, and in particular ex- 
cited the curiosity of Yuri Denisyuk, a 
young scientist who is now a correspon- 
ding member of the Soviet Academy of 
Sciences. According to him, it led to 
S CIENCE fiction has its own rules. discoveries in the field of holography 
(see Unesco Courier, March 1981). 
In the 1950s Soviet geologists 
discovered diamonds in Yakutia exact- 
Iy as Ivan Efremov had described in his 
story The Pipe of Diamonds (1945). As 
a scientist Efremov was able to 
substantiate his hypothesis concerning 
the location of the diamond deposit, 
and as an artist he showed how it could 
be discovered. 
There is no end to the scientific and 
technical predictions of Jules Verne. 
One has only to recall his Nautilus. Up 
to a hundred of his 
forecasts subsequently came true. 
H.G. Wells, in the War of the 
Worlds, and Alexei N. Tolstoy, in his 
Hyperboloid of the Engineer Garin an- 
ticipated the invention of the laser 
beam, which now promises unheard of 
advances in science and technology— 
but also has unprecedented destructive 
capacities.

In his story, Professor Dowell’s 
Head (1925) the Soviet science fiction

organs. Several decades later the Soviet

amazed the world when he grafted the 
head of one dog onto the trunk of 
another. Now organ transplants take

» The doyen of American science fic- 
tion, Hugo Gernsback, described in his 
novels the mechanism of a television set 
at a time when such an invention was 
not even thought of. He wrote about 
many technical innovations which 
subsequently became realities, as well 
as atomic wars which are now threaten- 
ing all life on earth. 
In one of his works written shortly 
after the Second World War, the well- 
known English science fiction writer 
Arthur C. Clarke introduced the idea 
of placing an artificial geostationary 
satellite in orbit at an altitude of some 
30,000 kilometres above the Earth, 
which could be used for telecom- 
munications and the retransmission of 
radio and television programmes. 
Konstantin E. Tsiolkovsky’s story 
Beyond the Planet Earth, which was 
published at the beginning of the cen- 
tury, contained so many scientifically 
valid ideas that it provided a theoretical 
basis for cosmonautics in both the 
USSR and the USA. 
But the most remarkable figure in 
the domain of scientific forecasting is, 
perhaps, that of Cyrano de Bergerac.

pires de la Lune and Histoire Comique 
Right, this lid of a 1,300-year-old Mayan 
sarcophagus, found In the Temple of 
Inscriptions, Palenque, Mexico, Is seen 
by writer Erich Von Daniken as an Impor- 
tant plece of evidence for his theory that 
ancient mythologles are really garbled 
accounts of the doings of extra- 
terrestrial visitors to Earth. Parts of the 
reproduction of the design on the sarco- 
phagus lid, as published by Von Dani- 
ken, are blacked out to enhance the 
Impression of an astronaut In the semi- 
reclining position adopted for rocket 
take-off. 
des Etats et Empires du Soleil, both 
written over three hundred years ago, 
are not only full of pungent wit but of 
what his contemporaries regarded as 
preposterous figments of a childlike 
imagination. He proposed multi-stage 
rockets for interplanetary flights, 
spoke of weightlessness and parachute 
descents, and claimed that the human 
organism was composed of cells. 
Moreover, several decades before 
Antonie van Leeuwenhoek produced 
his microscope and more than two cen- 
turies before the discoveries of Pasteur 
and Mechnikov, on which the science 
of microbiology is based, Cyrano de 
Bergerac asserted the existence of 
microbes in the blood and resistance to 
them by antibodies. He designed lamps 
in the form of luminous balloons (elec- 
tric bulbs?), extraordinary speaking 
books attached to the ear and reciting 
the text, starting with the chapter men- 
tally chosen by the hearer, 
What is more, Cyrano assured his 
readers that he had learned all these 
things from the son of the Sun (an ex- 
traterrestrial?). He did not hesitate to 
make this assertion at a time when the

quisition for his heretical ideas about

an infinite number of worlds in the 
Universe was still fresh in men’s minds. 
As a scientist who has turned to 
literature, I have devoted myself to 
science fiction while continuing to be a 
scientist and engineer. Some of the 
ideas advanced by me several decades 
ago are now being realized. For in- 
stance, that of using superconductivity 
for the storage of energy (The Burning 
Island, 1939) and of a floating sub- 
marine tunnel (The Arctic Bridge, 
1941). At present no such tunnel passes 
through the North Pole, but one is be- 
ing built by Japanese engineers bet- 
ween the islands of Honshu and Hok- 
kaido and, as we know, there is a pro- 
ject for a tunnel under the English 
Channel. 
In my story Explosion (1946) I put 
forward the hypothesis that the enor- 
mous devastation over an area of 2,000 
square kilometres in the Podkamen- 
naya Tunguska river basin (Eastern 
Siberia) in 1908 was not caused by a 
falling meteorite but could have been 
due to the crash of an extra-terrestrial 
spaceship because of a breakdown. My 
story excited the imaginations not only 
of science fiction writers but also of 
scientists, and although my hypothesis

is rejected by some people it also has its 
supporters. 
Palacocosmonautics, which studies 
the traces of contacts with extra- 
terrestrial beings in ancient times, at- 
tracts me as a science fiction writer not 
only because of its romantic character, 
but also because of its potential 
demonstrability. 
Certain scientists who have not 
studied this question seriously never- 
theless maintain that there are no 
proofs of actual extraterrestrial con- 
tacts in the past, and consequently they 
consider it unethical to concern 
themselves with this question. But this 
is by no means correct. One has only to 
consider the many arguments in sup- 
port of the hypothesis. True, there are 
speculative ‘‘pseudo-proofs’’ with little 
or no foundation, but genuine science 
fiction is based exclusively on the pro- 
vability of the improbable. 
The French scholar Henri Lhote 
discovered at Tassili, in the Sahara, a 
rock-drawing several thousands of 
years old, which he jocularly named 
“the great god Martian’’. A stone 
sculpture of ‘‘the great god Martian’’ 
dating from the same period was 
BRIS 
discovered on the Japanese island of 
Hokkaido, thousands of miles from 
Africa. Nearby were uncovered a 
number of terracotta statuettes or 
dogu, which means ‘‘a loose overall 
covering with hood’’—in other words, 
what we would nowadays call a diver’s 
suit. Radiocarbon tests revealed that 
they were 4,500 years old. This meant 
that they had been made by the Ainu, 
the predecessors of the Japanese. 
But presumably their portraits were 
not the only traces of themselves which 
the visitors left behind. Legends and 
traditions have survived. In Egypt, for 
instance, the god Thoth was the patron 
of science and scribes. Tradition has it 
that he flew in from Sirius. According 
to the ancient legends of the Dogons, 
an African tribe of cattle-breeders, it 
appears that Sirius was not a double 
star, as was established in our time, but 
a triple one. According to the Dogons, 
the Universe emanated from a single 
‘‘egg’’, i.e. an atom which took part in 
the original ‘‘Big Bang’’—a theory 
subscribed to by many contemporary 
astronomers. Does this not explain 
why, in ancient Egypt, there was a 
calendar linked to Sirius and its fifty- 
year cycle or rotation period, and why »

### 61315: Ariadne's thread

Ariadne’s thread 
HE flowering of science in the 
] last century has accustomed us 
to identify science fiction with 
what is most modern, newfangled and 
futuristic in imaginative literature. 
When we speak of science fiction we 
almost invariably have in mind writers 
such as Verne, Wells or Bradbury. 
But is science fiction really of such 
recent origin? If we look at the creative 
works of the pre-scientific era, we shall 
find that the roots of what we 
nowadays call science fiction are to be 
found in myths, folklore, cabalistic 
writings, alchemy, and architecture 
and plastic art of magico-religious 
inspiration. 
The devices and situations most fre- 
quently encountered in science fiction 
can be traced back to this poetical 
heritage. The earliest antecedent of 
computers, for instance, was the 
Delphic Oracle, which could divine and 
foretell everything concerning the gods 
and man. The time machine is merely a 
modern version of metempsychosis, 
which enabled the souls of the ancients 
to transmigrate from one body to 
another and consequently from one 
epoch to another. As for the invisible 
man, the Chinese alchemist - Pao 
Pu’Tsu wrote that ‘if someone rubs his 
body with cypress juice he will become 
invisible’’, while his European counter- »

in their hands. The principle of the 
robot is nothing more than the 
‘““mechanization’’ of the alchemist’s 
homunculus and the Golem of the 
cabalists. 
All the interplanetary fauna which 
nowadays forms part of the stock in 
trade of science fiction is derived from 
the mythological monsters, bestiaries 
and demonology of the Middle Ages. 
The creatures who pass through 
Bosch’s Garden of Earthly Delights 
could have been taken straight out of 
some war of the galaxies, and many 
other fabulous beings still look down 
on us from the walls of Gothic 
cathedrals. 
And what about the laser beams 
which turn up so frequently in 
futuristic literature? All the religions 
were peopled with gods who cast rays 
and angels with flaming swords. 
Homer speaks of ‘‘Apollo, he who 
wounds from afar’’. When Cortez ask- 
ed the Aztecs where they got their 
knives, they pointed to the sky because, 
as Mircea Eliade says, the blacksmiths 
of ancient times employed ‘‘sacraliz- 
ed’’ meteoric iron. 
Everything that is powerful and 
warlike comes from on high, whether it 
be Zeus, the Indo-European God of 
Thunder, or the Shango of the 
Yorubas—who has been culturally 
transferred to Brazil and the Carib- 
bean. The Book of Exodus tells how 
18 
“Mount Sinai was altogether on 
smoke, because the Lord descended 
upon it in fire’’. In the Vedas we also 
find Indra casting lightning-flashes 
with one of his four arms. 
“They arose in the midst of the 
light’’, we read in the Popol Vuh of the 
Quiché Indians of Guatemala, ‘‘the 
Sun fell to one of them and the Moon 
to the other. Then the firmament was 
filled with light... the four hundred 
youths who were killed by Zipacna also 
arose and were transformed into 
stars...”’ 
Of all the mysteries surrounding our 
ancestors, the most undecipherable 
were in the heavens. The best, if not all, 
efforts of science fiction are directed 
towards this aerial ocean which has 
been given metaphorical form in every 
culture. Thus science fiction becomes, 
as it were, a counter-mythology, a 
cosmogony of the future divested of 
religious significance. 
Man’s oldest dream—to fly—derives 
from this cosmic curiosity, and “‘fiy’’ is 
the dominant verb in futuristic 
literature. Possibly because of 
nostalgia for the winged deities, many 
Yoga-fakir legends speak of people ris- 
ing in the air, and the alchemist Yo-Tsi- 
Yuan claimed that by eating pine- 
kernels he could rise above the ground. 
Of all mythologies, the one which 
best expresses this longing to fly is the 
fable of the Cretan hero Icarus, the 
first ‘‘cosmonaut’’, who flew with 
wings made for him by his father 
Daedalus. 
Daedalus is the prototype of the syn- 
thesis between artist and scientist be- 
queathed to us by classical antiquity. 
This legendary figure was sculptor, ar- 
chitect, painter and inventor. Accor- 
ding to mythologists he infused life and 
movement into his statues (another 
prefiguration of the robot) but he also 
produced inventions in the field 
of navigation. His engineering

achievements include the labyrinth 
which enclosed the Minotaur (another 
creature worthy of science fiction), the 
thermal baths at Selianthus, the for- 
tifications of the city of Camikos, a 
canal in the river Alaban, the temple of 
Apollo at Cumae and the foundations 
of the temple of Aphrodite on Mount 
Eryx. 
It was not until the Renaissance that 
a living Daedalus appeared upon the 
scene, Leonardo da Vinci, ['uomo 
universale, was the perfect heir to the 
humanist ideal of reconciling science 
and the arts. 
Painter, sculptor, architect, military 
engineer, physicist, writer, Leonardo 
also devoted himself to stratigraphy, 
autopsy, anatomy, and the technical 
designing of cities and machines. He 
studied the fossil shells of the Appen- 
nines and prided himself on his skill as 
a lute-player. Careful observation of 
the flight of birds led him to design the 
very thing invented by Daedalus. 
Three centuries were to pass before 
the appearance of another Daedalus. 
This time it would be a writer, an artist 
of vast scientific knowledge: Jules 
Verne, whose visions would have been 
impossible without the accumulated 
achievements of the imagination exten- 
ding from Daedalus to Leonardo—a 
veritable Ariadne’s thread leading, as it 
were, through a labyrinth to a kind of 
archaeology of science fiction. 
But there are other, perhaps more 
far-fetched, labyrinths, and since we 
are dealing with science fiction there 
can be no disrespect. I am thinking of 
the Maya pyramids which, according 
to archaeologists, were built as 
astronomical observatories.

### 61315: Ariadne's thread

Not long ago, when workers of the 
Electricity Company in Mexico City 
were digging up a street in order to in- 
stall a transformer, they came upon a 
rock covered with reliefs. Thus was 
discovered the Great Temple, which 
constitutes an entire treatise on astral 
symbolism, an allegorical narration by 
the Aztecs offering an explanation of 
the formation of the cosmos and pro- 
jecting man to the stars. Science fiction 
in stone? 
But the greatest flight of speculation 
was launched in the Sahara in the 
mid-1950s with the discovery of the 
Tassili n’Ajjer rock paintings, dating 
from about the Neolithic period. A 
procession of really startling images is 
depicted on the walls of caves. 
Although some experts think they 
represent ritual masks or head-dresses, 
what is certain is that several of the 
figures look like divers or astronauts. 
Perhaps we shall never know the full 
truth about these Tassilt paintings. But 
there they are, transmitting something 
baffling and mysterious, especially the 
most esoteric scene, depicting what 
look like wings floating above the 
heads of men, resembling an old- 
fashioned fan or the rotor blades of a 
helicopter. Indeed, these helicoidal ob- 
jects seem to be driven in circular 
movement around an axis. In both 
cases the axes are discs, and an irides- 
cent halo or reverberation can be clear- 
ly distinguished around them. 
Here we can no longer speak of head- 
dresses or masks or hats. What, then, is 
the meaning of these two artefacts? 
The most widely advanced hypothesis 
is that they are ships from another 
planet which visited the region in the 
remote past. I am inclined to imagine 
that it is a wishful design for some kind 
of flying machine. Another Tassili 
painting shows wheeled cars drawn by 
horses, and another depicts perfectly- 
drawn insects in full flight. If the ends 
of the blades of the two artefacts are 
studied carefully, it will be seen that 
their texture is similar to that of a but- 
terfly’s wings. Why not assume that a 
Daedalus could also have lived in this 
cave? 
From the flight of Icarus to the 
sphere of Phileas Fogg and the projec- 
tile that travels from the Earth to the 
moon, via the wall-paintings of Tassili, 
the flying broomstick of the medieval 
witch and the wings designed by 
Leonardo, science and poetry combin- 
ed have traced an impressive trajec- 
tory, ending in the spaceship of today.

### 61318: High societies: space settlements of tomorrow

HIGH SOCIETIES 
Space settlements of fomorrow 
and planetary systems of stars 
outside our solar system is one of 
the recurring themes of science fiction. 
However, we now know that planets 
such as Mars and Venus are not capable 
of supporting life, and the technical prob- 
lems of achieving the velocity necessary 
to reach even the nearest star within one 
person's lifetime seem today to be 
insuperable. 
Undeterred, science fiction writers 
came up with the idea of the ‘generation 
starship’’, a kind of Noah's Ark in space 
in which the crew completing the mis- 
sion would be the descendants of the 
original crew several generations remov- 
ed. In other words, the starship would, in 
effect, be a miniature, self-contained 
“travelling world". 
When high-energy physics professor 
Gerard O'Neill considered the problem, 
he asked himself ‘If several generations 
can survive in a starship, why send it to 
the possibly hostile environment of 
another planetary system? Why not 
create the desired environment in the 
starship itself and simply place it within 
easy reach of the Earth?’’ 
Why should we want to create col- 
onies in space? There are many good 
reasons for doing so. With the world 
population doubling every thirty-five 
years, our own planet is becoming over- 
crowded and suffering increasingly from 
the effects of pollution and its renewable 
energy resources will eventually run out. 
It makes sense to move some of our 
polluting industries out of the Earth's at- 
mosphere and to construct solar power 
stations in space where radiation from 
the Sun is available twenty four hours a 
day, at full strength. (7) Artist's impres- 
sion of the scene during the construction 
of a space power station. 
It would also be possible to develop en- 
tirely new industries. Alloys can be made 
under the weightless conditions of space 
from metals which do not mix suc- 
cessfully under the pull of gravity on 
Earth. Experiments conducted in Skylab 
and the Salyut space station have 
already resulted in the production of new 
alloys and special types of glass that are 
unobtainable on Earth. (2) Soviet 
cosmonaut Svetlana Saritskaya, the first 
woman to walk in space, conducts an ex- 
periment in welding, soldering and cut- 
ting metal in space. 
QS ne pine: of our sister planets Skylab and Salyut are, in fact, the first 
existing space habitats, and three Soviet 
cosmonauts, Leonid Kizim, Vladimir 
Solovyev and Dr. Oleg Atkov, have just 
completed a mission in which they spent 
a record, 237 consecutive days (eight 
months) in space. (3) Interior of the 
Salyut space station during a previous 
mission. 
Skylab and Salyut were not, of course, 
designed as long-term habitats and can 
only accommodate a handful of specially 
trained cosmonauts. However, advanc- 
ed, technically feasible designs for space 
habitats which could accommodate 
some 10,000 people in Earth-style com- 
fort already exist. (5) The Stanford torus 
(doughnut-shaped) habitat was designed 
at Stanford University in 1975. Approx- 
imately two kilometres in diameter and 
with a mass of over ten million tons, the 
torus rotates around a stationary central 
axis to provide a simulation of Earth 
gravity. (4) An artist’s impression of the 
living area in the outer rim of the torus. 
The windows at the top of the illustration 
look towards the central, stationary axis. 
That is to say, the “'floor’’ of the living 
area is perpendicular to the central axis 
but would feel ‘‘downwards’’ because of 
the spin of the torus. 
The space colony would need to be 
self-sufficient in food. (6) An artist's im- 
pression of the agricultural area designed 
for the Stanford torus space colony. The 
area is situated between two areas of 
parkland. On the top four levels of the 
farm, soybeans, wheat, sorghum and 
some other crops would be grown. The 
bottom level is a drying facility. Water 
would be supplied directly from the river 
(centre foreground) and indirectly 
through the fish tanks that line the sides. 
Nearly a kilometre in length, the farm 
would also be inhabited by rabbits and 
some 3,000 cattle. Since moisture, 
sunlight and heat conditions could be 
controlled, the farm would yield far more 
than a farm of comparable size on Earth. 
In developing their designs for space 
habitats, scientists seem to be out-doing 
the science fiction writers in their ex- 
ploration of the fantastic. Yet these 
designs are serious, science based pro- 
jects and to many experts they appear no 
more fantastic, and just as feasible, as 
did the project of landing on the Moon 
thirty-five years ago. =

thought, fantasy and fable. 
Then follow the scientific 
calculations. Finally, thought is crown- 
ed by achievement’. This is how 
Konstantin Eduardovich Tsiolkovsky 
(1857-1935), one of the pioneers of 
space travel, defined the basic relation- 
ship that exists between science fiction 
and scientific and technological 
development. 
In its wider sense of the creative, im- 
aginative dreaming that foreshadows 
scientific achievement, science fiction, 
like myth, reflects the ambition to 
dominate nature which is as old as 
mankind. 
Indeed, dream and rational thought, 
imagination and precise calculations, 
are interwoven in the creation of even 
the simplest tools or techniques, and it 
is not always easy to know where one 
ends and the other begins. For in- 
stance, those prehistoric cave drawings 
whose force and realism excite our ad- 
miration can be interpreted in different 
ways. Perhaps they were only fanciful 
dreams, primitive ‘science fiction” 
created by the imagination of pre- 
historic artists; perhaps they were 
projects or plans—for the manufacture 
of hunters’ snares —drawn up by 
prehistoric engineers. 
A project is often classed as science 
fiction simply because its achievement

bury’s The Silver Locusts. 
demands a higher level of technological 
advance than society has attained. 
Leonardo da Vinci designed a pro- 
totype flying machine four hundred 
years before the first aeroplanes ap- 
peared. His contemporaries treated his 
project as no more than a technical fan- 
tasy. Nobody could explain how the 
propeller of this remote ancestor of the 
helicopter would be driven, for «the 
motor was not invented until much 
later. 
Until a few decades ago, this was true 
of space flight. Because technological 
development was not advanced 
enough, it was impossible to produce 
rockets possessing the requisite pro- 
pulsive power. But science fiction had 
already foreseen the decisive role of the 
rocket. Jules Verne had equipped his 
moon ship with several auxiliary 
rockets. 
One of the major objectives of 
technological development is, of 
course, to perfect the means of produc- 
tion in order to increase productivity, 
and at first sight this seems to be a pure- 
ly practical aim which has nothing to 
do with fantasy or the imagination. But 
this is a superficial view. In every 
technical achievement there is an initial 
stage of capital importance: the stage at 
which, drawing on the maximum 
available information, every. possible 
solution is sought to a given problem,

thus allowing ideas to take form. At 
this stage intuition, imagination and 
fantasy are even more important than 
purely technical competence. This kind 
of imaginative freedom was exercised 
in the invention of the wheel just as in 
the construction of the Egyptian 
pyramids or the first supersonic 
aeroplane, and it will be equally 
necessary for the manufacture of 
tomorrow’s micro-computers. 
In the engineering sciences, the in- 
ventive process is much closer to the 
procedure used in science fiction than is 
generally realized. They are two similar 
forms of human activity, each applied 
to the search for new solutions 
although, of course, in different con- 
- texts and perspectives. The history of 
technological progress includes many 
examples where imagination, combin- 
ed with scientific knowledge, provided 
the seeds of new ideas and original con- 
cepts. Analysis shows that to produce 
any kind of machine that is to be com- 
mercially successful one must begin by 
examining at least fifty to sixty original 
ideas. 
This is where science fiction can play 
a decisive part in technological creativi- 
ty. Its essential role is not so much to 
provide specific ideas or concrete solu- 
tions drawn from the author’s imagina- 
tion, as to stimulate scientists and

Famed for his many works of science fic- 
tion, including notably The Martian 
Chronicles, The Illustrated Man and 
Fahrenheit 451, and an acknowledged 
master of the short story form, Ray 
Bradbury fell in love with poetry at the 
age of ten and has been writing it ever 
since. Of his poems he says that they are 
the outcome of ‘‘ideas, large and small, 
that tripped me up and felled me into my 
typewriter. I did not write them. They 
wrote me.”’ 


### 61324: Of what is past, or passing, or to come'

‘Of what is past, or passing, or to come’ 
by Ray Bradbury 
Of what is past, or passing, or to come, 
These things I sense and sing, and try to sum. 
The apeman with his cave in need of fire, 
The tiger to be slain, his next desire. 
The mammoth on the hoof a banquet seems, . 
How bring the mammoth down fills apeman’s dreams. 
How taunt the sabretooth and pull his bite? 
How cadge the flame to end an endless night? 
All this the apeman sketches on his cave 
In coward’s arts that teach him to be brave. 
So beasts and fire that live beyond his lair 
Are drawn in science fictions everywhere. 
The walls are full of schemes that sum and teach, 
To help the apeman reach beyond his reach. 
While all his ape-companions laugh and shout: 
“What are those stupid blueprints all about? 
Give up your science fictions, clean the cave!’’ 
But apeman knows his sketching chalk can save, 
And knowing, learning, moves him to rehearse 
True actions in the world to death reverse, 
With axe he knocks the tiger’s smile to dust, 
Then runs to slay the mammoth with spear thrust; 
The hairy mountain falls, the forests quake, 
Then fire is swiped to cook a mammoth steak. 
Three problems thus are solved by art on wall: 
The tiger, mammoth, fire, the one, the all. 
So these first science fictions circled thought 
And then strode forth and all the real facts sought, 
And then on wall new science fictions drew, 
That run through history and end with... you.

Unfortunately, insufficient attention 
is given at all levels of education to the 
need to develop the spirit of invention 
and innovation. Perhaps one of the 
most serious gaps in many education 
systems is this undervaluation of im- 
agination and fantasy in the educa- 
tional process. The result is that pupils’ 
creative capacities are not sufficiently 
encouraged at an age when the per- 
sonality is being formed. Worst of all, 
some educational activities are so 
organized that these capacities are 
brutally stifled at birth. 
Would it not be a good idea, 
therefore, to introduce science fiction 
into school programmes, thus giving 
young minds an opportunity to become 
familiar with the masterpieces of this 
branch of literature in a systematic 
way? It could also be introduced in an 
appropriate form into schools of 
engineering, especially since the time- 
24 
gangs "i 
lag between science fiction and 
technological reality is now being con- 
siderably reduced. 
It should not be forgotten that works 
of science fiction have often played a 
prophetic role in technological 
developments. The word ‘‘robot’’ was 
coined in 1921 by the Czech writer 
Karel Capek (1890-1938). Today 
robots have moved out of the sphere of 
science fiction and are operating entire 
factories. Improving them exercises the 
minds of science fiction writers as well 
as of engineers. The same is true of 
lasers. These all-powerful beams were 
one of the favourite themes of science 
fiction writers twenty years ago, and 
they were still a mystery until quite 
recently. Now, they are being used in 
medicine and telecommunications. 
Again, laboratories and research sta- 
tions, even technical workshops, are 
now being installed in outer space—

tion. The heroes of the cosmos are no

ROBOTS 
The term "‘robot’’, derived from the Czech 
robota (work), was coined by the Czech 
playwright Karel Capek in his play R.U.R. 
{Rossum’s Universal Robots), first perfor- 
med in Prague in 1921. The scene is set 
in the future on a island where robots are 
manufactured and sold as workers, ser- 
vants and soldiers. The word came to be 
applied to any piece of apparatus which 
was capable of some limited ‘‘thought’’ 
process and could perform simple, re- 
petitive tasks previously undertaken by 
humans. 
Initially, science fiction writers’ treatment 
of the theme of robots reflected society's 
unease, fear even, of rapid technological 
advance. The early robots were often 
depicted as menacing monsters that ten- 
ded to get out of their inventor's control 
and go rampaging around in an orgy of 
mindless killing. As society became more 
accustomed to technological progress (the 
first automatic traffic lights were originally 
referred to as robots), so robots began to 
be more sympathetically portrayed. This 
change was reflected in Ametican author 
Isaac Asimov's famous Three Laws of 
Robotics: (1) A robot may not injure a 
human being or, through inaction, allow 
a human being to come to harm. (2) A 
robot must obey the orders given it by 
human beings except where such orders 
would conflict with the First Law. (3) A 
robot must protect its own existence as 
long as such protection does not conflict 
with the First or Second Law. 
In the real world robots have become 
incredibly sophisticated, taking over from 
longer characters out of science fiction 
but scientists and engineers working in 
the new space technologies. 
But this does not mean that 
everything predicted in science fiction 
has already come to pass, or will 
necessarily come true in the future. 
Besides, such prophecies must not be 
confused with scientific predictions 
based on exact laws such as, for in- 
stance, the prediction of Dmitri 
Ivanovich Mendeleyev (1834-1907) 
concerning unknown chemical 
elements, or the discovery in 1930 by 
Clyde Tombaugh of the planet Pluto, 
whose existence and position had been 
forecast some fifty years earlier by the 
American astronomer Percival Lowell. 
Sometimes, scientific and tech- 
nological progress is so rapid that 
science fiction can neither foresee nor 
even keep up with the resultant tech- 
nical revolution, as was the case for in- 
formatics. Although the latter is 
already operating in the service of

kind— children meet robots face to face at 
The Robot Exhibit: History, Fantasy and 
Reality, an exhibition held eatlier this year 
at the American Craft Museum, II, New 
York. 
In more recent science fiction the introduc- 
tion of robots offers writers the opportu- 
nity to examine the practical, philosophi- 
cal and moral implications of artificial intel- 
ligence. In one of Asimov's stories, two 
robots left unused on a shelf pass the time 
in philosophical debate. They finally con- 
clude that robots conform more closely to 
the definition of the word “’‘man’’ than do 
men themselves. 
Some highly sophisticated programs now 
being developed for computers seem to be 
approaching the level of artificial intelli- 
gence. Left, Soviet chess grandmaster

science and technology, the themes it 
suggests have not been exploited to any 
great degree by authors of science 
fiction. 
This leap forward lends a certain 
fantasy to the achievements of tech- 
nology. At the same time it reduces 
futuristic literature to a level that is 
closer to reality. Thus it is becoming in- 
creasingly difficult for the authors of 
such works to find themes which depart 
from known scientific and techno- 
logical facts. On the contrary, they 
derive their inspiration increasingly 
from these facts. [|

century, and from then until the mind-

The filmic imagination was given free 
rein in his version of Jules Verne's A Trip 
to the Moon (1), depicting a Moon where 
giant mushrooms unfurled from the ex- 
plorers’ umbrellas and contrasting with 
the documentary realism with which 
Moon trips would be presented in such 
later films as Destination Moon (US, 
1850) made when space flight had 
become a real possibility. By 1916 no 
less than three films had been made of 
Verne's Twenty Thousand Leagues 
under the Sea and his novels with their 
mixture of fantasy and precise detail 
have ever since continued to provide 
film-makers with tempting fare.

Two classics of the genre were made 
in the 1920s and 1930s. Fritz Lang's 
Metropolis (1926) presented a grim 
vision of the future complete with terrify- 
ing machines and a robot-woman (2) 
which were still influencing science fic- 
tion films four decades later. Things to 
Come (3) resulted from collaboration bet- 
ween H.G. Wells and the Hungarian-born 
producer Alexander Korda. In it a global 
holocaust is followed by the rise of a 
gleaming glass and steel civilization 
capable of sending men to the Moon. As 
in Jules Verne’s Moon flight, a gun was 
used to project the space vessel, 
although by that time scientists knew 
that the rocket was the only practicable 
solution, 
A boom in science fiction films began 
in the 1950s, with space exploration as 
a prominent theme. Earthlings ranged 
further and further afield, as in the Soviet 
Voyage to a Prehistoric Planet, a 
meticulous narration of a journey to 
Venus. But the traffic was not all one- 
way, and Earth had some strange visitors 
from other planets. The Invasion of the 
Body Snatchers (1956) treated the 
theme of alien intelligence taking over 
human bodies, and was described by one 
critic as ‘occasionally difficult to follow 
due to the strangeness of its scientific 
premise’’. Another favourite theme is the 
journey through time or other dimen- 
sions, with perhaps the most unusual 
variation being depicted in Fantastic 
Voyage (5) in which five scientists are 
shrunk to microscopic size and injected 
into the blood stream of another scientist 
who has a blood clot inaccessible to 
surgery. 
The Incredible Shrinking Man (6) with 
its hero becoming smaller and increasing- 
ly alien in his own world is, like the situa- 
tion in Fantastic Voyage, literally incred- 
ible. As a sceptical scientist has pointed 
out, a mouse-sized man “would suffer 
from a mouse’s metabolic problems. 
With a surface area many times greater in 
proportion to his mass, he loses heat that 
much faster and would need to eat 
furiously simply to keep warm. A mouse 
needs to eat about a quarter of its own 
weight of food each day to survive...”

of technology, the fallibility of men and »

p machines, also find expression in a 
number of ‘‘prophetic’’ films about the 
future of mankind. Alphaville (1965) is 
set in a futuristic city run by an electronic 
brain which is finally destroyed whenit is 
fed with poetry, a medium it cannot 
understand. HAL, the homicidal com- 
puter in 2001: A Space Odyssey also 
echoes fears about a computer- 
dominated society. 
The real stars in modern science fiction 
films are the special effects, some of 
them spectacular setpieces such as scaly 
monsters and spaceships but others the 
kind that no one would notice. For Close 
Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) 
about a hundred paintings on glass were 
blended into the scenes. Such tech- 
niques and the blending of miniatures in- 
to live-action backgrounds were already 
being used in Things to Come. A widely 
used optical effect is the matte or mask 
which blanks out a part of the screen 
which can be filled in later. In Star Wars 
a few hundred extras were turned into 
thousands by being photographed three 
times at different distances from the - 
camera; the three shots were combined, 
and side ranks of men were painted in. 
The use of "travelling mattes’’ which 
change position, size and shape from 
frame to frame can create such effects as 
the ‘flying’’ of Superman. He was shot 
in front of a blue screen and a shape cor- 
responding to his outline was cut out of 
a skyline scene and his body fitted into 
the gap. One way of tricking the au- 
dience used by Stanley Kubrick in 2001: 
A Space Odyssey was based on the 
viewer's assumption that the camera is 
static. The stewardess in photo 7 carries 
a tray and appears to walk through 360 
degrees. In fact she was standing on a 
treadmill and the camera and the entire 
set rotated together. Today the use of 
computerized camera systems and 
computer-created images in such films 
as Tron (opposite page) are creating 
astonishing aesthetic effects whose 
possibilities are only just beginning to be 
exploited. ||

The Dream of the Professor of Architecture (1844). Pen and 
brush work by the English architect Charles Robert Cockerell 
(1788-1863). 


### 61326: In the age of one world': a Chinese Utopia

‘In the Age of One World’ 
A Chinese Utopia 
by Kang You wei 
 
A utopia (from the Greek words ou and topos, meaning no 
place) is an imaginary land where everything is perfect. Uto- 
pian thought has been a feature of Western intellectual life 
for centuries: one of the first books to describe a utopia was 
Plato’s Republic, and other utopias include those created 
later by Thomas More in the 16th century and Samuel Butler 
in the 19th. In China, unlike the West, a utopianizing tradi- 
tion scarcely exists, and the text published below is therefore 
a historical rarity. It is an extract from the Ta Tung Shu or 
One World Book written in the late 19th century by the 
Chinese thinker Kang You wei (1858-1927). In this long work 
of over 150,000 Chinese characters, the author develops a 
visionary conception of a world in the future in which the 
sufferings of mankind would be ended and age-old barriers: 
between man and man, group and group, would be done 
away with. The expression Ta Tung, here translated into 
English as ‘‘one world’’, denotes an ideal state of society and 
of human nature and has also been rendered in other ways 
including ‘‘the great commonwealth’’, ‘‘the great unity’’, 
and ‘“the era of ‘world brotherhood’”’. >

because of hunger, and so he 
sought the fruit of the grasses and 
trees, and the flesh of birds and beasts, 
to fill himself. If he could not get flesh 
and fruit, then he suffered, If he got 
and ate them, filled up on them, 
satiated himself with them, then he was 
happy. He suffered because the wind 
and rain and mist attacked his body, 
and so he wrapped himself in the bark 
of grasses and trees, and wove hemp 
and ge (a plant of the bean family with 
fibres from which cloth is woven) into 
garments to cover his body. If he could 
not get them, then he suffered. If he got 
and wore them, then he was happy. He 
suffered because he did not obtain 
satisfaction of his human desire and so 
he sought a mate to embrace. If he 
could not get a mate, then he suffered. 
If he got one, then he was happy. 
I the beginnings of man he suffered 
Later, there were wise ones who ‘in 
pursuing affairs added refinements’ to 
the old ways. Taking food, they cooked 
it, roasted it, mixed it and so increased 
men’s happiness. Taking clothing, they 
used silk material, made it gay with the 
‘“five colours and the six hues’’, devis- 
ed gowns, caps, and sandals, and so in- 
creased men’s happiness. (Similarly, 
with dwellings, and with gratification 
of sexual desire.) 
The increase of happiness is caused 
by that which more suits and better ac- 
cords with man’s spiritual soul and 
bodily soul, which heightens and ex- 
pands man’s enjoyment and pleasure. 
The inability to attain this happiness is 
suffering. Suffering is the spirit 
knotted-up, the body wounded, the 
soul melancholy and downcast. The 
capacity for increased happiness is 
limitless; the capacity for increased suf- 
fering is also limitless. The two are 
related faculties. Daily to bend our 
thoughts more earnestly to means of 
seeking happiness and avoiding suffer- 
ing: this is to progress. 
This is what all the sages have had as 
their purpose, with all their material in- 
ventions and social techniques. We 
may judge them by the one criterion of 
the extent to which they have increased 
human happiness and decreased 
human suffering. Their methods must 
also be judged as valuable or not, ac- 
cording to the times and the 
environment, 
In One World everyone will live in 
public housing. Outside of their regular 
rooms at their place of work, 
everywhere they will find great hotels, 
whose beautiful and pleasant accom- 
modations defy description. They will 
be of several grades, according to the 
money the guest wishes to spend. There 
will be four better kinds: ‘movable 
rooms”’ (i.e. electrically powered cars 
that run on tracks), ‘‘flying rooms’’, or 
flying ships’’ and ““marine’’ ships. 
32 
The people of this age will love to 
travel. The grasses and trees are the 
most stupid, and therefore flourish but 
do not move about. The sheep and 
swine are not so stupid as the grass and 
trees, and are able to move about, but 
cannot go far. As for the great peng- 
bird and the yellow ku-bird, they fly a 
thousand /i with a single movement of 
their wings. In antiquity, men aged and 
died without leaving their native 
village; thus they were like the grass 
and trees. In the Middle Age, men 
travelled about like sheep and swine 
(i.e. only short distances). In the Age of 
Complete Peace-and-Equality, then 
they will be like the great peng-bird and 
the yellow ku-bird. 
All public buildings and residences 
will have to pass the inspection of the 
health authorities. Public hotels will be 
equipped with air-conditioning, elec- 
trical heating, massaging machines. 
There will be fast, electrically propelled 
ships on the water, equipped with every 
comfort and pleasure—even to 
gardens—and many people will live on 
these ships. On land there will be 
automobiles. These will be developed 
to the point that they will seat perhaps 
several hundred persons, and will go at 
great speeds. Perhaps they will be elec- 
trically powered; or it may be that they 
will be powered by some new fuel. 
Horse-drawn carriages will be used on- 
ly for hauling short distances, or they 
may be entirely replaced by the elec- 
trical vehicles. Therefore, at the begin- 
ning of One World, people will live on 
mountain tops; at the middle period of 
that age, they will live on the sea; later, 
they will live in the air. 
There being no private homes, 
everyone will dine together, like a great 
convention. There will be no slaves or 
servants, but their functions will be 
performed by machines, shaped like 
birds and beasts. One will order by 
telephone, and food will be conveyed 
by mechanical devices—possibly a 
table will rise up from the kitchen 
below, through a hole in the floor. On 
the four walls will be lifelike, ‘‘pro- 
truding paintings’’; music will be play- 
ing, and there will be dancing. All this 
will stimulate the appetite. In all these 
things there will be refinement and 
moral uplift. 
  
  
Below, illustration of Sir Thomas More's 
ideal island-State of Utopia. Published in 
1516, Utopia (the word was coined by 
More) is an indictment of the social and 
economic conditions prevailing in the 
Europe of his day which are contrasted 
with those of an imaginary ideal society 
located on an island off the coast of the 
New World.

At this time, people will eat their 
food in a liquid form—the essences ex- 
tracted from solid matter. These essen- 
tial juices will be more easily absorbed 
by the body than are the solids. There 
will be vapours which will be inhaled to 
give a joyful intoxication, but without 
harm to the body. By imbibing only the 
essences of foods, man’s life will be

There will be three stages within the

meat will still be eaten; the Age of In- 
creasing Peace-and-Equality, in which 
the flesh of birds and animals will no 
longer be eaten; the Age of Complete 
Peace-and-Equality, in which even in- 
sects and fish will no longer be eaten, 
and in which all forms of life possessed 
of cognition will be equal. Equality will 
not extend to the vegetable kingdom, 
for man must eat to preserve himself, 
and because these forms of life are not 
possessed of the cognitive faculty, and 
hence are not to be included in the do- 
main of Ren*.

comfort. They will have great variety 
and beauty, but will indicate no distinc- 
tions between people, except for the 
badges of honour for Ren or 
knowledge. There will be constant pro- 
gress in the use of all kinds of im- 
plements to advance civilization. Music 
will play a great part in all phases of 
human life. People will shave off all 
hair except for that in the nose which 
fulfils the function of straining dust 
and impurities from the air. This is on 
the ground that the nearer we are to the 
beasts, the hairier; the more civilized 
we become, the less hirsute. Further- 
more, lack of hair contributes to 
cleanliness. 
Men and women will bathe several 
times daily, in water which will leave 
them fragrantly scented. This is not a 
matter of perfuming in the present 
manner, so that a woman will be more 
attractive as a sexual plaything. Rather 
it is like the matter of hair: thereby 
humans are farther elevated above the 
filthy, foul-smelling beasts. ‘‘The 
beauties of the present age will still not 
equal the ugly of the Age of Complete 
Peace-and-Equality’’. Even the toilet 
facilities of that time will be made plea- 
sant with music and fragrant odours 
and mechanical contrivances for 
flushing away the filth. For the time 
when people go to the toilet is the time 
when they are most tranquil and 
withdrawn from the hubbub of the 
world, If there is that whereby to lift 
their thoughts above this world [literal- 
ly, move their thoughts of abandoning 
the world], to inspire their imagina- 
tions beyond the mundane [literally, 
ideas of discarding forms], then their 
souls will of themselves rise far above 
the wordly level. 
Everyone will receive a daily medical 
check-up. All phases of life will be 
under the supervision of the medical 
authorities. Contagious diseases will be 
eradicated. The whole earth will be 
made clean and healthful. About the 
only ailments remaining will be exter- 
nal ones, easily treated with medicines. 
Thus, although there will be public 
hospitals, they will be almost empty; 
the sick will comprise only those who 
are about to die of old age. In the case 
of the latter, should their sufferings be 
acute, and the doctors agree that there 
is no hope of improvement, then they 
may be mercifully put out of their 
agony by electrocution... People of this- 
time will attain to longevity of from a 
hundred or two hundred, to over a 
thousand years, due to progress in 
medical science, clothing, and diet. »

a 
» The search for longevity, for the art 
of becoming a spirit or immortal (shen 
xian) may be carried on only by those 
who have returned with twenty years of 
service the twenty years of support and 
education received from the public. 
Those who wish to retire from the 
world to carry on these practices may, 
therefore, do so after the age of forty. 
These capabilities will be the highest at- 
tainment of One World. But they may 
not interfere with the public service 
owed by everyone, or else the work of 
the world might be neglected, and 
civilization retrogress. 
Therefore in the Age of One World 
only the studies of the art of becoming 
a spirit or immortal, and of becoming 
a buddha, will be widely practised. For 
One World is the ultimate Law of this 
world; but the study of immortality, of 
longevity without death, is even an ex- 
tension of the ultimate Law of this 
world. The study of buddhahood, a 
state without birth or death, implies 
not merely a setting apart from the 
world, but an actual going out of this 
world; still more, it is a going out of 
One World. If we go this far, then we 
abandon the human sphere and enter 
34 
  
  
the sphere of immortals and buddhas. 
Hereupon, the study of immortality 
and buddhahood then begins. Compar- 
ing the two, the study of immortality is 
too crude, its subtle words and pro- 
found principles are not many, and its 
ability to intoxicate men’s minds is 
limited. As for the universality and 
subtlety of the study of buddhahood, it 
extends to the point where the speaking 
of words is discontinued, and the ac- 
tivities of the mind are terminated. 
Although having sage-wisdom, not to 
move a hand [i.e. to remain quiescent]: 
such self-containment is yet more pro- 
found. And further, there are also the 
mysterious arts of the Five Van- 
quishings and the Three Brilliants, the 
application of their supernatural 
powers is still more singular. 
Therefore after One World there will 
first be the study of immortality. After 
that there will be the study of bud- 
dhahood. The inferior knowledge is the 
study of immortality; the superior 
knowledge is the study of buddhahood. 
After the studies of immortality and 
buddhahood will come the study of 
roaming through the heavens. I have 
another book on that subject. |

### 61327: A Voyage to the centre of Jules Verne

m _— aes 
A voyage to the centre of 
ha i i lL 
JULES VERNE 
EAD again today, most scientific 
R works published in the last 
century seem distinctly old- 
fashioned. Both the theories propound- 
ed at that time and the terminology in 
which they were expressed appear out- 
dated. The laboratory equipment used 
then looks to wus archaic, almost 
grotesque. 
But Jules Verne remains eternally 
young. A century after they were writ- 
ten his books are still best-sellers, not 
only in France but all over the world; 
only the Bible, Shakespeare and Lenin 
outstrip them. Today Verne’s work is 
more popular than ever, and not only 
among young people. 
What is his secret? Above all else he 
was a novelist to his fingertips, adept at 
fascinating his readers with descriptions 
in which poetry vies with fantasy and 
captivating them with the twists and 
turns of excellent plots full of adven- 
tures and mysteries prefiguring the 
modern whodunit, 
Jules Verne is one of the masters of 
the art of suspense, which he sometimes 
prolongs into severai volumes. When 
you have finished Twenty Thousand

Leagues under the Sea you still do not 
know the identity of the mysterious 
Captain Nemo. This is only revealed in 
a later book, The Mysterious Island. 
The dénouement often contains a 
scientific message. Here appears 
another of Jules Verne’s talents: he was 
a consummate teacher of the kind who 
stimulates the interest and enthusiasm 
of his pupils by amusing and intriguing 
them. 
He excels at presenting abstract ideas 
in attractive form. One example is the 
difference of a day in calculating the: 
length of a trip round the world. This 
discovery was made, not by Jules 
Verne, but by the Portuguese explorer 
Ferdinand Magellan and his crew who 
were astonished to find that the date 
when they reached Sanlucar was Satur- 
day 6 September 1522 whereas accor- 
ding to their logbook that day should 
have been Friday the 5th; by voyaging 
westwards they had “lost” a day. 
Verne’s novel Around the World in 
Eighty Days is constructed around this 
phenomenon which has not occurred to 
the hero, Phileas Fogg. He thinks he has 
lost his bet after being held up in Great 
Britain near the end of his journey. 
Then, as he looks at a newspaper, he 
suddenly realizes that by travelling 
eastwards he has gained a day. He had 
seen the sun rise once more than people 
who had stayed in England. The few 
minutes he had lost here and there dur- 
ing his journey as he periodically ad- 
justed his watch to solar time had gain- 
ed him twenty-four hours. 
In other cases, the solution of a prob- 
lem is purely and simply imagined by 
the astonishingly inventive mind of 
Jules Verne. Thus the explorers in The 
Fur Country should have observed a 
total eclipse of the Sun but in fact they 
only observe a partial eclipse. Does this 
mean that an error has slipped into the 
calculation of the ephemerids? No, this 
is absolutely inconceivable in view of 
the degree of precision with which the 
movement of the Moon is known. The 
only possible explanation is that the ex- . 
plorers are no longer where they think 
they are because their island has become 
a raft. 
With this incident Jules Verne 
thought up nothing less than the space 
sextant which was tested by Thomas 
  
  
  
Professor Aronnax, the narra- 
tor and one of the heroes of 
Jules Verne’s novel Twenty 
Thousand Leagues under the 
Sea (1870). In this novel Verne 
created an extraordinary pre- 
cursor of the modern subma- 
rine in the Nautilus, comman- 
ded by Captain Nemo. The 
illustrator has depicted Profes- 
sor Aronnax with the features 
of Jules Verne, then in his early 
forties.

An illustration from Jules Verne's novel 
Around the Moon (1870). The travellers 
in the projectile hurtling towards the 
Moon suddenly float weightlessly. 
» Mattingly and Henry Hartsfield on the 
fourth mission of the space shuttle Col- 
umbia in the summer of 1982. This in- 
strument works on the principle of tak- 
ing account of the Moon’s position in 
relation to the Sun in order to locate 
one’s position. 
These prophetic insights are all the 
more astonishing since Jules Verne was 
not a scientist; he had studied to be a 
notary. But paradoxically his lack of 
scientific training was useful to him in 
the sense that it encouraged him to ex- 
press himself in language accessible to 
the layman whom he wished to initiate 
in scientific subjects just as he had 
learned by questioning the scientists he 
knew. 
At Verne’s request, a mathematician 
friend of his calculated the speed a body 
must attain in order to escape the attrac- 
tion of the earth. This speed is 11.2 km 
per second, a figure that today’s space 
missions have made familiar. Jules 
Verne was the first person to reveal it. 
His two books From the Earth to the 
Moon and Around the Moon were writ- 
ten on the basis of this piece of scientific 
data. 
Does this mean that everything is 
rigorously exact in Jules Verne? Far 
from it. It is astonishing that he did not 
think of rockets as a means of reaching 
this speed of 11.2 km per second. It was 
not that he knew nothing of rockets, but 
he only assigned them a secondary role 
as a means of braking the lunar projec- 
tile. Doubtless the nineteenth century 
believed most strongly in the future of 
artillery and thought of the rocket as a 
‘ vestige of the past. 
The EPCOT Center, which opened at 
Walt Disney World near Orlando, Fiorida 
(USA) in 1982 is a realization of Walt Dis- 
ney’s dream of creating what he called 
an ‘Experimental Prototype Community 
of Tomorrow’. A voyage through time 
and space worthy of Jules Verne, the 
Center is a showcase for the latest tech- 
nological developments and takes its 
visitors to all the continents. Left, 
‘Spaceship Earth’, a 55-metre-high 
geosphere, dominates the entrance to 
“Future World’’, a group of futuristic 
pavilions, one of which is iargely de- 
voted to a presentation of ways of life in 
the 21st century

It also seems amazing that Verne did 
not grasp, using the laws of ballistics, 
that a state of weightlessness would exist 
in his machine all through the space 
flight. He simply thought that there 
would be a point near the Moon where 
the pull of the two planets would 
neutralize each other so that passengers 
and objects would float in the cabin of 
the lunar projectile, a situation depicted 
in an illustration which became famous. 
Some would claim that one of 
Verne’s novels is based entirely on a 
full-scale scientific heresy: Journey to 
the Centre of the Earth. The pressure at 
the centre of the planet is so high that 
matter as we know it on the Earth’s sur- 
face cannot exist. It would therefore be 
inconceivable to send a man there. 
But there is no reason not to imagine 
that another planet in the solar system 
may not conceal in its midst an immense 
“‘ocean’’ similar to that which Verne 
  
  
  
  
“And so Il do not think I am going too far 
when | say that there will soon be trains 
of projectiles In which the journey from 
the Earth to the Moon will be comfortably 
effected,’ says the Jules Verne hero 
Michel Ardan in From the Earth to the 
Moon (1865) from which this illustration 
is taken. 
imagined at the centre of the Earth. This 
could be the case, for example, of 
Enceladus, a satellite of Saturn whose 
inner mysteries may one day be ex- 
plored by man. 
For there can be no doubt that the 
human adventure is only just beginning 
and that it has very far to take us. It was 
perhaps Jules Verne’s greatest merit 
that he understood this. In addition to 
being a novelist and a teacher Jules 
Verne was above all a man who had 
faith in mankind, whose fantastic Ph

future thanks to the resources of 
technology he foresaw. This is why he is 
so much admired. 
The essential message of his work, a 
message whose full importance can be 
gauged in the age of electronics and 
robots, is this conviction that mankind 
which through science has the power to 
reorganize nature as it wishes, is the sole 
creator of its future, a future with 
extraordinary perspectives. 
Some would like to claim that the 
future holds in store a world in which 
man will be dominated by the machine, 
reduced to the state of a robot. We 
know that is absurd. Robots are only 
the agents of our will. It is we who take 
the decisions. The thinking and the in- 
itiative are ours. The reality is simpler; 
only yesterday man had to devote much 
of his time to non-creative physical or 
intellectual tasks. Today he is freed 
from these tasks for reflection and 
decision-making. 
Jules Verne’s great achievement is 
that he announced that this would come 
about in a masterly series of works writ- 
ten a century ago. |
