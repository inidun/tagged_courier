is a widely-travelled photographer whose work was 
shown at the “Istanbul-Istanbul” exhibition at the 
city's Taksim gallery in November 1998. 
** Nedim Girsel is a Turkish author who writes 
in Turkish and French.He was born in 1951 and has 
published some twenty novels, short stories, 
travelogues and essays that have been translated into 
ten or so languages. Notable among his works are “A 
Long Summer in Istanbul”, 
“The Death of the Seagull” and an anthology of 
Turkish women’s literature entitled Paroles dévoilées 
(Arcantére-Unesco Publishing,1993).His novel “The 
First Woman” won the Ipekgi Prize, awarded by a 
Greek-Turkish foundation, 
for its contribution to understanding between 
the two peoples. Gursel has also written 
the screenplay for a motion picture which is currently 
being filmed and will probably 
be called Istanbul My Love.

Istanbul is present in most of my books. 
i One of my novels begins with these 
words: “For a long time I rose early. It 
was there, on the Asian shores of the Bos- 
phorus, in my beloved city, which has fol- 
lowed me everywhere and whose memory 
is branded in my mind forever.” What new 
can I find to say about Istanbul, as a Turkish 
writer who has lived in Paris for twenty-five 
years, except by evoking the piercing nos- 
talgia I feel for the city from afar. My fore- 
head bent over white pages, | imagine the

PEOPLE AND PLACES 
» concrete buildings seem embedded into 
each other. From time to time, the dar- 
kened windows of an old, decrepit yalil 
stream past the window. Then, high garden 
walls, narrow alleyways cascading down 
towards the sea, trees and more trees. Fish- 
nets drying in the sun, small white ferry- 
boats and little fishing vessels sail by. At the 
most unexpected moment, turning a corner 
or at a crossing, tombs loom up before me. 
I know that it is here, in one of these dilapi- 
dated tombs, that one day I shall be laid to 
rest. But for now I am in Paris and alive, 
thank God. So I picture myself on Karakoy 
Square, sitting at a table in a café near the fish 
market. 
The market is livelier than ever. Pas- 
sersby bustle towards Galata Bridge clut- 
ching string bags stuffed with provisions. 
Fresh vegetables, fish,dried fruits and nuts, 
smoked and salted meats, and cheese can be 
made out under their wrappings. Fish- 
mongers shout themselves hoarse, custo- 
mers crowd around the stalls, blood- 
streaked fish heads fall into the water. Heads 
of tuna, bass and mackerel fall amidst rot- 
ting potatoes,cabbage leaves and leeks. 
Sitting in the café on the corner of the 
market, I watch as the crowd swells in the 
coolness of the evening. String bags are 
bursting at the seams. Traffic is blocked on 
Karakoy Square. Cars for hire are packed 
together. Pedestrians try to make their way 
between the buses, lorries, pushcarts and 
peddlers. Their hair is disheveled and they 
look distraught. From where I sit, I can see 
people crammed into a bus, their faces 
streaming with sweat, lined up like sar- 
dines, Saturday travelers with lacklustre 
eyes, patiently waiting. T he old Fords,Che- 
vrolets, Plymouths and Buicks are jam- 
packed. Overwhelmed by exhaustion, the 
human heads remain impassive inside these 
airless,hermetically-sealed cans. 
I want to get my breath back. To breathe 
in the air of the sea, of the foamy waves 
rumbling in the blue immensity. I am over- 
come by the acrid stench of burned oil, »

A hand 
outstretched 
to Europe 
ocated on the European shore of the Bos- 
horus Straits, Istanbul is at the crossroads 
of land and sea routes, Asia and Europe, the 
Black Sea and the Mediterranean.lt is Turkey's 
main manufacturing centre, commercial hub 
and port. With a population of 12 million, the city 
and its surrounding suburbs are the country’s 
fastest-growing urban area. 
Founded by the Greeks as Byzantium 
around 658 B.C. Istanbul became the capital of 
the Eastern Roman Empire in 330 A.D. under 
Emperor Constantine, whose name it bore until 
the fall of the Byzantine Empire. Constantinople 
was taken by the Crusaders in 1204, recon- 
quered by the Greeks in 1261 and captured by 
the Ottomans on May 29, 1453. Mehmed II, 
the Conqueror, made it the capital of the 
Ottoman Empire in 1458, changing the nameto 
Istanbul. It was not until 1923 that the city lost 
its status as capital to Ankara. The famous 
bridge spanning the Bosphorus was inaugu- 
rated in March 1973. 
“An old,ring-covered hand stretching out 
towards Europe” is how the French poet Jean 
Cocteau described Istanbul, whose historic 
areas, where many Byzantine and Ottoman 
landmarks stand side-by-side, were added to 
Unesco's World Heritage List in 1985. The famous 
Hagia Sophia church, built between 532 and 537 
by order of Emperor Justinian Il; the Mosque of 
Sileyman,named after Sileyman the Magnifi- 
cent and inaugurated in 1556; the Blue Mosque, 
Topkapi palace and the great bazaar bear wit- 
ness to a history spanning well over a thousand 
years. [|

sweat and urine. I look away from Karakoy 
Square, turning my gaze left to the other 
bank of the Golden Horn. Suddenly the 
spectacle changes. The stage seems to 
widen. I see clouds briskly scudding past in 
the southern wind. Straight ahead, Bayezit 
Tower gradually grows fainter in the ashen 
light. In the distance, I can make out the 
spiky minarets of the Mosque of Siileyman, 
its heavy domes overwhelming the old 
houses, and stacked crates forming a wall in 
front of the covered market. T he pigeons of 
the New M osque—little black spots—stand 
out against the sky. Taking off from the 
mosque’s courtyard, they land on the blac- 
kened walls and canopies of the Egyptian 
bazaar. Oddly, the opposite bank seems 
more peaceful. But the fish market makes a 
deafening racket. In the shimmering 
colours, fishing boats moored at the quay 
bob up and down on the filthy water. The 
Golden Horn 1s strewn with shreds of oily 
rags and dead seagulls. 
A tide of passengers pours out of the 
Eyiip ferry which has drawn up alongside 
Galata Bridge. Thick smoke belches out of 
the funnel. Soot rains down on bunches of 
grapes and polished apples in the stalls, on 
the old civil servants sitting in the bridge’ 
cafés, smoking hookahs as they finger their

prayer beads. Police motorboats, tartans 
and pot-bellied barges glide past. So does 
the boat owned by the fisherman who sells 
his catch near the landing pier.T he severed 
fish heads make me feel sick. So I get up and 
head for a quieter neighbourhood. 
Back in the streets, strolling past wooden 
houses with iron gates, I feel I am living 
through a dream. Asif I am outside the city 
in an unknown, inaccessible place, facing a 
theatre set beyond which it 1s impossible to 
go. Sometimes cars pass by, and street pedd- 
lers. “Rags! Second-hand goods!” shouts 
one of them. Another yells that he sells water- 
melons or, dragging out the “0” ,says “too- 
matoes’ instead of “tomatoes”. And “Pep- 
pers! Eggplant! Chicory! Lettuce! Okra!” 
They are the cries of another age, of an 
Istanbul I have never forgotten. They come 
from an unreal world. A world I can no 
longer reach even if I go there. Yes, I am in 
Paris and, like the great Turkish poet Orhan 
Veli, who died there at the age of 35, “I 
listen to Istanbul with my eyes closed.” And 
the lines of another Istanbul poet, whose 
name still burns my lips and who endured 
more than his share of separations and nos- 
talgic longings, come to mind: “Two things 
are forgotten only in death /The face of our 
mother and the face of our city.” _

Are the welfare and interests 
of the public being served by 
the priorities of researchers, 
the thrust of their work, the 
ways in which they are 
organized, the funding they 
receive, and the circulation of 
their findings? 
purpose? 
Science reigns triumphant. Never has it been so powerful and influential. It has 
conquered diseases which have decimated whole populations. It has abolished exhaus- 
ting physical labour and wearisome repetitive tasks. It has vanquished distance and 
pushed back the frontiers of our knowledge of the infinitely large and the infinitely small, 
in both the inanimate and the living world. 
In short, it has acquired the ability to shape our lives, to change life itself. But it has 
also increased its capacity to destroy life. T he strength of an army can rest on the number 
and determination of its combatants but it is also, and chiefly, based on the technological 
sophistication of their weaponry. The bombing of Iraq,and now of Serbia, are the latest 
examples. 
Yet science is wavering. For the first time since the Enlightenment, the way science can 
be used is being challenged. The link between scientific progress and social progress is wea- 
kening and signs of obscurantism are appearing. Hiroshima sounded the alarm. T hen the 
crisis of the environment,triggered by the dominant mode of development,turned ques- 
tioning of science into a worldwide issue.T his form of development is inseparable from 
a frantic and indiscriminate quest for technological innovation.Finally, advances in bio- 
technology, which harbour many grave dangers for human dignity, are often too closely 
bound up with the selfish interests of their promoters. 
No one blames science for not knowing everything. No one criticizes it because it has 
not yet found a vaccine against AIDS or reached a conclusion about the theory of the Big 
Bang. It has never been claimed of science, as it has of history, that it has come to an end. 
It must keep on tirelessly probing the enduring mysteries of life. 
But science can no longer avoid—and nor can we—the basic question of what and who 
it is for. In other words, are the welfare and interests of the public being served by the prio- 
rities of researchers, the thrust of their work, the ways in which they are organized, the fun- 
ding they receive, and the circulation of their findings? Or are scientists looking mainly in 
the direction of high-spending consumers at the expense of long-term basic research? 
Because of the growing “privatization” of research, are we not tending to overlook essen- 
tial and universal human needs which cannot immediately be met? 
Those who are excluded from this new “scientific power” must make their voices heard. 
For example, the inhabitants of the 600,000 villages which have no electricity or the world’s 
two billion people without access to drinking water have the right to ask science to find 
solutions adapted to their very meagre resources. Humanity also has the right to ask science 
to give priority to research into processes of global disruption and ways of coping with them. 
What’s more, all citizens have the right to ask science to further our understanding of the 
mechanisms of inequality and exclusion which are gradually undermining peace and demo- 
cracy. 
To move towards such a new contract between science and society, UNESCO and the 
International Council for Science (ICSU) are inviting scientists, private firms,governments 
and other stakeholders to attend a conference which will be held in Budapest at the end 
of June. One major purpose of this meeting will be to see that the benefits of science go 
primarily to all those who have hitherto been unreached. Their conditions will only 
improve if they have access to the mighty power of science. nu

### 115860: Antarctica's tainted horizons

Antarctica’ staintec 
The Antarctic was designated ‘a continent for peace and 
science’ in an international treaty signed 38 years ago. In the 
last decade a wide-ranging Protocol has been added to this to 
provide the continent with better environmental protection. 
But today dark shadows of pollution are looming over this 
remote continent with a unique international status. On the 
eve of a meeting of Antarctic Treaty nations to be held in May 
1999 in Lima, Peru, Dr. David Walton of the British Antarctic 
Survey explains why conservation of what is still ‘the world’s 
cleanest place’ is important for all of us. 
  
 
Who owns Antarctica? 
The Antarctic is unique in that it is 
owned by no one country and has been 
governed for almost 40 years by an inter- 
national treaty (see box).Because of this it 
cannot be controlled or policed as areas of 
national sovereignty can. To make changes 
in the rules, the 27 Antarctic Treaty (AT) 
countries all have to agree. 
Do people need to get a visa to go there? 
If you are a citizen of an AT country, then 
these days you have to get a permit to meet the 
requirements of the environmental protocol. 
Since these countries represent 70 per cent of 
the world’s population, there is a strong pre- 
sumption that most people who will be going 
to the Antarctic will be getting permits. If 
they are tourists, travel agents will get a permit 
for them. Countries which are not party to the 
treaty do not have to provide permits.

### 115860: Antarctica's tainted horizons

  
  
  
Air view of Antarctica’s icy peaks. 
Is there much tourism? 
Tourists attracted by the continent’s 
remoteness, wildlife and stunning scenery 
first came by ship in the 1960s, and in the 
past two decades their numbers have 
climbed steadily. Air tourism has also deve- 
loped over the past decade. Last year there 
were over 10,000 tourists in Antarctica— 
more people than were concerned with all 
the scientific stations and their logistic sup- 
port. Some 60 or so sites are regularly used 
for tourist visits. 
Do tourists bring pollution? 
Many tourists are already well informed 
about environmental issues and know that 
uncontrolled tourism can damage the fea- 
tures that make the area special. As yet 
PLANET 
there is no unequivocal scientific evidence 
of damage but there must be a limit to the 
number of visitors that sites can sustain 
before the vegetation or wildlife are tram- 
pled out of existence. 
How can numbers be controlled? 
There appears to be no legal way at 
present to do this for visitors to an inter- 
national area. Governments can help 
manage tourism by limiting permits to com- 
panies with good environmental records, but 
my view is that the tour companies them - 
selves must accept the responsibility to limit 
impacts by policing their customers. 
Worryingly, the passenger capacity of 
cruise ships is rising, with ships carrying up 
to 1,700 passengers proposing to transit 
the Antarctic whilst others intend to land up 
to 800 passengers at individual sites. My 
personal experience of tour ships has so 
far been good, with guides working hard to 
inform passengers as well as keep them to 
a strict environmental code whilst on shore. 
They do not leave litter, the ships do not 
deposit waste overboard in Antarctic waters 
and for the most part visitors do not appear 
to seriously disturb wildlife. 
Why is it so important to preserve the 
Antarctic environment? 
The Antarctic is special because it has 
less pollution than anywhere else in the 
world—it doesn’t have any smokestack 
industry, agricultural activity or perma- 
nent human population. We can use it as 
the baseline against which pollution levels 
in other parts of the world can be measu- 
red, to tell us whether or not the situation 
is getting worse. From this point of view, 
the Antarctic will only remain scientifical- 
ly valuable if it is properly managed today. 
Sampling snow cores in Antarctica has 
given us arange of pollution yardsticks. We 
can see in the snow the increasing levels of 
lead we have been putting into the atmos- 
phere since the Industrial Revolution, with 
the most rapid increase when lead was 
added to fuel for cars. The snow also 
contains a signature of the worldwide pol- 
lution caused by the atomic bomb tests of 
the 1950s and 1960s. Most recently we 
have been able to detect carbon particles 
in the air produced by forest fires in the tro- 
pics. 
What can be done to combat these 
environmental threats? 
You have to distinguish between glo- 
bal and local threats. Let’s look at the 
local problems first. Until the mid-1950s 
there was very little scientific activity in 
the Antarctic and the only industry in the 
area was whaling. At that time the oceans 
were seen as suitable repositories for 
waste, and dumping waste in uninhabited 
areas was acceptable. When 1 first began 
work in the Antarctic in 1967, recycling 
was not even considered in many research 
stations and dumping waste in remote 
areas of the Antarctic was a common 
practice.Unfortunately, in the low tempe- 
ratures characteristic of the Antarctic, 
there is virtually no bacterial decay, so the 
wastes associated with scientific stations 
and with this laissez-faire attitude of ear- 
lier days are still with us. In fact it was this 
problem of waste disposal that raised the 
alarm among AT countries and led to the 
signature in 1991 of the Protocol for the 
Protection of the Antarctic Environment. 
This protocol,which came into legal force 
in January 1998 but had been followed by 
most countries since 1991, introduced 
rigorous environmental regulations and 
forced countries to clean up the mess they 
had created. 
Is the protocol working? 
The rules comprise the most stringent 
conservation and management rules so far 
agreed upon anywhere in the world. They 
cover all human activities in Antarctica, 
and include stipulations for rigorous control

of waste disposal and contingency plans to 
combat marine pollution and protect flora 
and fauna. No mining or exploration for 
minerals or hydrocarbons will be allowed in 
the Antarctic for the next 50 years. The AT 
nations have taken their role as managers 
very seriously and made enormous amounts 
of investment in changes of practice. It 
costs a lot of money to be environmentally 
clean. When the U.S. agreed to the pro- 
tocol they immediately produced $30 mil- 
lion for clean-up operations around the 
American scientific stations. 
In other words, the Antarctic Treaty and the 
Protocol to prevent pollution are 
functioning well within the Antarctic itself 
but pollution is coming in from outside.

### 115860: Antarctica's tainted horizons

That’s right. Most of the Antarctic pol- 
lutants come from industrial and agricul- 
tural activity in the northern hemisphere. 
We can measure them in the air, the snow 
and in the plants and animals. For 
example, there is one especially unpleasant 
group of chemicals called persistent orga- 
nic pollutants (POPs) which comprises 
insecticides, herbicides and other environ- 
mentally damaging substances. These 
compounds do not exist naturally, break 
down only very slowly in marine and ter- 
restrial ecosystems and accumulate with 
toxic effects. None of them are made or 
used in the Antarctic and they are now 
banned from use both there and in many 
other parts of the world. T hey mainly ori- 
ginate from the northern hemisphere, pro- 
duced by agriculture, industrial processes 
and from waste breakdown. Measuring 
their presence in Antarctic penguins and 
seals indicates the baseline pollution level 
for these compounds throughout the 
world. The increasing range and concen- 
tration of many POPs in Antarctica is a 
sobering reminder of how far these dama- 
ging compounds can spread outside our 
control and how little we can do about it. 
Industrial countries of the North contribute 
up to 80 per cent of the greenhouse gas 
emissions that cause global warming and 
endanger fragile areas like the Antarctic. Yet 
these countries are also parties to the 
environmental protocol to preserve the 
Antarctic environment. Isn't there a 
contradiction here? 
That is quite correct. It is surprising, to 
say the least, that states which have shown

environmental clean-up. 
extraordinary co-operation in preserving 
the Antarctic environment are not doing 
enough to control the pollution in their 
own parts of the world. 
The Antarctic Treaty is a bit like the Inter- 
national Law of the Sea, where everybody 
agrees on what should happen on the high 
seas and then does something different in 
their own waters. T here seems to be a contrast 
between what countries can do co-operatively 
in an area that is not owned by them and is 
A continent for peace and science 
nternationally co-ordinated work in the Antarctic 
began with the scientific initiative called the 
International Geophysical Year in 1957. The results 
were so impressive, both scientifically and politically, 
that in 1959 the participating countries signed the 
Antarctic Treaty (AT), which came into force in 
1961. The Treaty, which runs indefinitely, desi- 
gnates the continent as an area for peace and 
science, freezes all territorial claims, forbids military 
activity and nuclear waste disposal, and encourages 
international collaboration in science and logistics. 
The Treaty was initially signed by Argentina,Aus- 
tralia, Chile, France, New Zealand, Norway, the 
United Kingdom, Belgium, Japan, South Africa,the 
former Soviet Union and the United States Since 
1961 a wide variety of extra legislation has been 
agreed at the regular meetings of the AT nations, 
1 2 The Unesco Courier - May 1999 
who now comprise 27 countries with active scien- 
tific programmes covering areas of science ranging 
from the outer atmosphere to the rocks beneath the 
ice sheet, from the bacteria in ice cores to the 
origin of the Southern Hemisphere continents. 
Many of the projects are now so large (e.g.,esti- 
mating whether the whole ice sheet isgrowing or 
melting) that they can only be accomplished by big 
international teams working over several years. A 
further 16 countries have acceded to the Treaty but 
do not undertake research. AT countries represent 
around 70 per cent of the world’s population. 
In 1991 the AT nations signed the Environ- 
mental Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty, which 
bans mining for 50 years and provides for a fully 
comprehensive regime of environmental protec- 
tion. [| 
not being industrially developed by them 
and has no indigenous population, and what 
they do in their own territory where there is 
a population,industry and expectations for a 
different way of life. 
What can be done? 
Nothing can be done to prevent this 
long-range pollution in the Antarctic which 
is due to industrial activities in other parts 
of the world. Antarctic pollution will 
continue as long as pollution continues 
elsewhere in the world. What we can do is 
to attempt to keep our own Antarctic house 
in order by ensuring that the activities that 
take place down there are first of all subject 
to environmental impact assessment and 
then that we use technologies and metho- 
dologies that minimize damage or pollution. 
Would you say that environmental 
protection is easier in the Antarctic than in 
the Arctic? 
One major reason why the AT nations 
have been able to introduce such stringent 
environmental regulations is that there is no 
indigenous population seeking to fulfil its 
aspirations at the cost of the environment.In 
the Arctic region on the other hand, where 
there is a sizeable population and countries 
have sovereign territory, there are very consi- 
derable areas of mineral development and 
hydrocarbon and gas extraction. In Siberia, 
for example, there are enormous oil spills 
from fractured pipelines and heavy metal 
pollution problems from smelters that simply 
do not occur in the Antarctic. 
Who is liable for environmental damage in 
the Antarctic? Environmentalists say the 
Treaty is not clear about this. 
That is true. No agreement has been rea- 
ched as yet. This question is on the agenda for 
the treaty meeting in Lima in May. 
Why do countries not agree about this? 
There are a number of difficult pro- 
blems. First of all you have to get 27 coun- 
tries with 27 different legal systems and 27 
different cultural expectations to agree on 
what liability means. 
Take, for example, the idea of a protected 
area in a national park. In the U.S., a national 
park is a protected area owned by the Federal 
government and is run as a park for conser- 
vation purposes. A national park in the UK is 
not owned by the government but by lots of 
separate land-owners. It isn’t run mainly for 
conservation purposes. It contains industry, 
housing and all sorts of other activities. It 
doesn’t bear any resemblance whatsoever to 
the American,German and French versions. 
The same term in law means lots of different

things in different countries. That is one of the 
major problems we face in the case of liability. 
Do any states parties to the Antarctic Treaty 
still have territorial claims over the 
Antarctic? 
The Antarctic treaty freezes all territo- 
rial claims that were there in 1961 and 
these cannot be improved on or added to in 
any way. Taking away this major source of 
international disagreement has allowed the 
parties to continually adjust the treaty to 
meet changing public and political needs 
over the past 38 years. Of particular impor- 
tance throughout that period has been the 
scientific advice on the best methods for 
management that has been supplied by the 
international science community. That 
makes the AT a slightly unusual treaty. By 
including scientists right from the start it has 
been able to tap into the scientific com- 
munity and get sound scientific advice. 
What kind of scientific research is being 
done in the Antarctic? 
The special environmental characteristics 
of the continent make it possible to carry out 
scientific investigations and experiments 
which are not possible anywhere else in the 
world. We are looking at animals and plants 
that can survive in the very low tempera- 
tures and very dry atmosphere which are 
characteristic of the Antarctic. We are using 
the Antarctic as an experimental area to test 
out theories about whether life can survive on 
Mars. And we are managing one of the lar- 
gest fisheries in the southern hemisphere. 
Because of the characteristics of the ear- 
th’s magnetic field, the Antarctic has some 
unique features enabling us to investigate 
the causes of solar storms. T hese occur when 
a solar flare on the sun produces a storm of

charged particles which hurtle towards the 
earth and affect its upper atmosphere, where 
hundreds of communications,navigational 
and television satellites have been positioned. 
In the Antarctic we are working on measuring 
solar storms and developing a model which 
will warn us about their likely effects so that 
we can protect satellites by moving them to 
a safer orbit or by switching them off. 
Damage can affect a lot of people. 
For instance, a solar storm produced a 
tremendous amount of induced current in a 
power system in North America a few years 
ago causing the whole of Quebec's electrical 
system to collapse. If we can develop a model 
which tells us what the strength of the storm 
will be and when it will strike and so on we 
can take precautions to stop that sort of 
thing happening. In addition to measuring 
pollution levels, research is also being carried 
out into many aspects of global warming, 
melting ice sheets and rising sea levels. 
There have been reports that ice shelves 
in the Antarctic are disintegrating and 
drifting away. Is this so? 
We know that some of the smaller floating 
ice shelves on the Antarctic peninsula have 
disintegrated over the last 40 years. They 
don’t make any difference to the sea level 
because they were already floating but they 
do show that significant regional warming is 
occurring in this area. What we still don’t 
know yet is whether the total ice sheet is in 
balance. We are developing a model but it will 
take many more years yet before we can be 
certain if and when the ice sheets could melt. 
What is the present situation of ozone 
depletion above the Antarctic? 
It was the discovery of the hole in the 
ozone layer over the Antarctic in 1985 by the 
 
 
The world's coldest, 
driest, windiest 
place 
Aree and its ice shelves cover about 14 
million square kilometres, 10 per cent of the 
earth’s land area. Less than 1% is free of per- 
manent ice and snow. The highest continent (esti- 
mated average altitude 2,300 m), it is perpe- 
tually hidden beneath the planet's largest ice 
cap, built up over 400,000 years of compacted 
snow fall and now almost 5 km deep in places 
The ice cap contains over 32 million km3 of ice 
(about 90% of the world’s ice and almost 70% of 
its fresh water), but with an average precipitation 
of only 5 cm per year, Antarctica is the driest 
place on earth. 
Antarctica is also the world’s coldest place 
(annual mean temperature -16°C). The coldest 
temperature ever recorded on earth was -89.6°C 
at Russia's Vostok research station in July 1983. 
Srong winds, sometimes up to 320 km per hour,

wind speed average is about 67 km per hour,

British Antarctic Survey that drew attention 
to the depletion by industrial processes, 
notably chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) gases, 
of the ozone layer that stops harmful solar 
radiation from penetrating through to the ear- 
th’s surface. Last spring saw the lowest ozone 
level in the Antarctic ever recorded. 
We will not see the ozone level climb 
back up to normal protective levels until we 
have got rid of all the chemicals which are 
causing ozone destruction in the upper 
atmosphere. Since CFCs are still around it 
is unlikely that there is going to be a sudden 
recovery of the ozone layer in the next few 
decades. As of now there is a black market in 
CFCs to get round the restrictions on trading 
and manufacture. 
There are so many CFCs around—in 
deep freeze and air conditioning plants— 
that it is not going to be possible to get rid of 
them quickly. We are going to be faced with 
ozone depletion for a considerable time. 
Depletion is already happening in the Arctic, 
and ozone levels above Europe have declined 
in the past few years. It is happening all over 
the world. The most frightening thing is just 
how difficult it is to gain any real control 
over such serious global damage to conserve 
the world for future generations. nu

### IGNORE

WORLD OF LEARNING 
From pollution to over-population, education has 
a key role to play in helping learners realize early on 
how they can influence the future— for the better 
Gone are the days when environmental 
education was simply about nature 
outings in primary school to discover the 
local flora and fauna, or projects to unders- 
tand a region’s landscapes, economic activi- 
ties and traditions. Today, the accent is on no 
less than giving students the right set of tools 
and values to become eco-citizens—respon- 
sible consumers, producers and decision- 
makers, able to measure the implications of 
their actions, not only on their own surroun- 
dings, but at a more global level. 
In an environmentally literate society, 
economists, for example, will have a basic 
understanding of what a balanced ecosystem 
1s while biologists will be in a position to 
grasp such notions as economic efficiency. 
“Just as with literacy, it is through education 
that we can train citizens to integrate envi- 
ronmental dimensions into their decision- 
making processes,” argues Canadian biologist 
and author Claude Villeneuvel. “The objec- 
tive is to change behaviour in order to dimi- 
nish the impact of human activity on the 
biosphere. As such, it is an education geared 
towards action. An ecologically literate person 
should be able to understand and act in spe- 
cific ways in his or her daily life.” 
The new 3Rs- 
Reduce, Reuse,Recycle 
At the community college where he 
teaches in Quebec, Villeneuve and his col- 
leagues put this credo into practice throu- 
ghout the science faculty. Whether in bio- 
logy, chemistry or physics experiments, 
students are asked to show systematically 
that they have chosen the least dangerous 
option for the environment,by, for example, 
minimizing waste or foreseeing special recy- 
cling containers. In studying a physical phe- 
nomenon like the meanders left by water on 
an inclined plain, students will observe what 
happens when those naturally traced by rivers 
are tampered with, leading to erosion, defo- 
restation and a rise in water levels. “The aim 
is to make students aware of sound environ- 
mental practices at the end of their studies by 
setting down objectives that are common to 
all disciplines,” explains Villeneuve.

With their often centralized and rigid 
structures, education systems appear ill- 
equipped to break down the watertight walls 
between disciplines and integrate environ- 
mental concerns across the board. Yet, the 
process towards a more holistic approach is 
underway at all levels, spurred by the present 
crisisand an emerging, more interdependent 
vision of the future.

the notion of “sustainable development”. 
Although it has been interpreted in more 
than one way, the most commonly held defi- 
nition was put forward in 1987 by the World 
Commission on Environment and Develop- 
ment, presided by Gro Harlem Brundtland, 
as “development that meets the needs of the 
present without compromising the ability of 
future generations to meet their own needs.” 
In working towards this endeavour, the 
pivotal role of education has been stressed 
time and time again on the international 
stage, from the 1990 conference in Jomtien on 
Education for All, to other world gatherings 
on population, women, social development 
and cities. The transformative potential of 
education is often highlighted by the simple 
fact that educated mothers are more likely to

practices at the end of their 
studies by setting down 
objectives that are common to 
all disciplines 
adopt desirable health and nutritional prac- 
tices,have fewer children and send their own 
daughters to school. 
In educating for sustainable develop- 
ment, the connections between people, 
resources, health and quality of life are 
emphasized. “The objective is to develop 
responsible behaviour, to be able to make the 
pertinent and right decisions, and act res- 
ponsibly at an individual and collective level 
towards environmental,population and deve- 
lopment issues,” says N athalie Barboza from 
UNEsco’s office in Dakar (Senegal). Over the 
past decade, a majority of countries in the 
South have integrated these concerns into 
formal and non-formal curricula. 
The motto of the environmental move- 
ment—*“act local, think global”’—has lost 
none ofits hold. “Countries generally find the 
contents of programmes in the local reality,” 
explains Barboza. “A teacher will, for example, 
start off the geography lesson by showing his 
or her students a field of scorched earth,and 
from there, discuss resource management 
and the consequences of deforestation.M ost

teachers feel directly concerned by these 
questions and are aware that the key thing is 
to develop responsible attitudes to preserve the 
environment.” Reflecting the interdependent 
nature of issues, the ministries of health, 
youth, social affairs and the environment are 
often invited to work in tandem with educa- 
tion authorities. 
In revising curricula, disciplines often 
take on a much more pertinent beat. In 
Mexico, for example, the recently revised 
natural science curriculum for primary schools 
broaches topics such as the importance of 
Cynthia Guttman* 
water for life, types of pollution and their 
sources, population growth, industrialized 
and natural foods and how technologies affect 
ecosystems. The intention is to help children 
view the environment as a “common good, 
which requires different consumption pat- 
terns for progress to be compatible with the 
use of natural resources,” states Edgar Gon- 
zalez-Gaudiano, from Mexico’s Ministry of 
the Environment. “As of third grade, text- 
books teach the rule of the 3Rs—Reduce,

> Reuse, Recycle—with special emphasis on 
the first, to show the students the importance 
of looking after our natural resources, irres- 
pective of how ‘abundant’ they may be.” 
One way to encourage transdisciplinarity 
is to make teachers feel they are participating 
in a common educational project, stresses Vil- 
leneuve. The notion of density in mathema- 
tics, for example, can be just as easily 
explained in terms of dots on a page as by 
trees in a forest. A teacher will likely choose 
the second option if he or she looks at learning 
through an environmental lens. Making lear- 
ning such a “future and action-oriented” 
project requires, in the best of worlds, the par- 
ticipation of the society at large. 
Learning to think globally 
Toronto, one of the world’s most multi- 
ethnic cities, is a case in point. When the Board 
of Education embarked on a school reform, the 
process was not locked in academic circles. Ins- 
tead, some 7,000 individuals, from parents 
and staff to business leaders, NGOs and repre- 
sentatives of the arts world turned up for full- 
day consultations on how education should be 
responding to the demands of a changing 
world. What,participants were asked, should 
students know, do and value by the time they 
graduate from school? Rather than a narrow set 
of goals geared towards the workplace, parti- 
cipants stressed concepts like responsible citi- 
zenship, critical thinking, personal life skills, 
values and actions. 
According to Charles Hopkins, one of the 
co-ordinators of the project, “if you were to read 
all the answers that came in with sustainable 
development eyeglasses and highlight every 
reference to the environment, economic and 
human development, the pages would have 
leapt into colour.” As the curriculum guidelines 
state, “learning must help students to conduct 
their lives in ways that foster healthy social

and natural systems, both locally and glo- 
bally.” The environment is a theme running 
across disciplines, from social studies to the 
natural sciences. Around such key concepts as 
power, time and change, students ascend from 
the personal and the local to the global as they 
come to grips with the multi-layered dimension 
of issues and draw connections between them. 
But bringing about changes in attitudes

doesn’t happen through rote learning. It starts 
with building children’s sense of self-esteem, 
since without, they are highly unlikely to feel 
concern towards others or their surroun- 
dings. Then, teachers must encourage initia- 
tives that have a positive resonance in com- 
munities. “You cannot develop a caring 
attitude towards one another and the envi- 
ronment through listening to lectures,” stresses 
0.]. Sikes of the United Nations Fund for 
Population Activities (UNFPA). “The tea- 
ching has to be participatory.” Training is cri- 
tical, and when it is lacking, the whole endea- 
vour is compromised. In many countries of 
francophone Africa, lack of sufficient funds to 
print materials and provide on-the-job teacher 
training is stalling the spread of sustainable 
development messages. What’s more, since 
changing habits and attitudes does not stop 
when the school day ends, support from the 
community is essential in making pro- 
grammes a success. In the end, one of youth’s 
first tasks might indeed be to question and 
perhaps alter the attitudes of their own peers.

Rural exodus was just one of the themes 
broached in the dialogues, comic strips, poems, 
short stories and games written by youth bet- 
ween 12 and 25 during a summer camp held in 
August 1998 in Senegal in the coastal village of 
Palmarin. Organized by Unesco and the NGO 
Groupe pour "Etude et "Enseignement de la 
Population (GEEP), it aimed to increase youth's 
awareness of a number of issues related to sus 
tainable development. 
Participants had a set goal to work towards:the 
production of a manual that would serve as a 
valuable tool for other teenagers engaged in com- 
munity mobilization and awareness-raising. 
Printed in 2,000 copies and now distributed in 
Senegalese schools— notably those running pro- 
grammes on environment, population and deve- 
lopment (EPD), the manual’ provides a lively 
approach to understanding and tackling deve- 
lopment challenges. 
Two units of the book are comprised of a dia- 
logue followed by questions in which participants 
are asked to identify and analyse EPD themes, 
from the consequences of uncontrolled urbaniza- 
tion or coastal erosion to early marriage. Then, solu- 
tionshaveto identified and explained. During the 
week, participants’ talents at getting messages 
across was put to the test. While the mornings 
were set aside for working on the manual, the 
afternoons were devoted to field activities in 
several villages. One group worked on a tree- 
planting project, another painted a series of murals 
on EPD themes, while a third organized meetings 
with villagers to raise awareness of issues The 
camp also enabled youth from rural and urban 
areas to work hand in hand, bridging the gap 
between these two worlds, and together becoming 
educators for a more viable future. [|

### 115862: Who owns science?

Who owns science” 
Roland Waast and 
Sophie Boukhari* 
For many years, the political leaders and scientists of the 
great powers called the shots in science. “Leave it to 
us,” they said to citizens. “We’re working on your behalf, 
for your security and your prosperity.” 
This tacit contract between science and society has 
had its day. On the world economic battlefield, research 
is increasingly geared to the market and technological 
innovation. The frontiers are hecoming blurred between 
laboratories, both public and private, and corporate 
marketing services. In a situation in which science is 
increasingly regarded as a commercial resource, how can 
it yield benefits for all? 
* Respectively, sociologist of science at the French Scientific Institute for Development 
in Co-operation,and UNEesco Courier journalist 
“What’s good for science is good for humanity.” 
} Until the end of the Cold War, few people 
dared challenge this dictum originating in the 
philosophy of the Enlightenment and given greater 
force after the Second World War. Despite the threat 
of the nuclear holocaust which it had made possible, 
science was widely seen as a beneficial force. In 
both East and West, it was invested with a sacred 
mission—to guarantee the security and prosperity 
of nations. 
In the United States, the wealthy leader of the 
“free world”, the idea took root after 1945 that 
people should trust the state and the scientists, and 
that spending on basic (and military) research should 
be unlimited. It was argued that pure science would 
inevitably have applications that would contribute to 
progress and social welfare.Universities and major 
sources of funding, such as the National Science 
Foundation and the various branches of the armed 
forces, were left to decide on research priorities. >

In France, people were also expected to trust the 
authorities, which opted for a more dirigiste 
approach. T he state decided policy and chose stra- 
tegic areas, and then administered and funded on 
an ad hoc basis executing agencies such as the 
National Centre for Scientific Research and the 
Atomic Energy Commission. 
These two models, which had the advantage 
of leaving scientists with a degree of independen- 
ce, were widely followed elsewhere in the world. 
They boosted basic research, which produces 
new knowledge with a wide range of applications. 
But they also served to rubber-stamp massive 
public spending for military and civil purposes. 
And in this tacit agreement between scientists 
and society there was a geographic and democra- 
tic deficit, in the sense that science developed lar- 
gely in a few urban centres as part of a national 
framework, and ordinary citizens were never 
consulted. The direction of research was largely 
decided by political and scientific elites and the 
“military-industrial complexes” of a few big 
powers. 
But the last 20 years have seen major changes 
in the world of research. The state has lost its 
capacity for initiative. Belief in progress is giving 
rise to doubts and controversies. T he prestige of 
science,like that of state technocracies, has faded. 
Its main preoccupations increasingly take 
account of private-sector interests, which these 
days fund and carry out two-thirds of all research 
in some industrialized countries. 
This new situation has several causes. In the 
1970s, the benefits of science and technology began 
to be challenged, mainly by the environmental 
movement and in the developing world. After the 
Cold War ended, the strategic interests which had 
accounted for huge government expenditures 
changed and military spending dropped sharply. 
Glossary 
Applied research. Research aimed at developing practical 
applications to basic research. 
Basic research. Experimental or theoretical investigation 
undertaken primarily to acquire new knowledge of the 
underlying foundations of phenomena and observable 
facts, without any particular application or use in view. 
Innovation. The introduction of a new technique, pro- 
duct or production process. Innovation can take two forms. 
The first, referred to as incremental innovation, aims to 
improve a product or launch a new one by making slight 
adaptations. The second, more radical and much rarer, 
enables the development of a new sector, like biotechno- 
logies. 
Invention. The devising of a new product, process or 
system. 
Know-how. Confidential,practical,unpatented,technical 
knowledge, professional experience and accumulated skills 
for the production and distribution of commodities and ser- 
Vices. 
Patent. A certificate of grant by a government of an exclu-

R&D. Research work carried out by a company or group to 
conceive and develop new products 
Technology. The practice of any or all of the applied 
sciences which have practical value and/or industrial use. 
The employment of tools, machines, materials and pro- 
cesses to do work, produce goods, perform services or 
carry out other useful activities 
Transfer of technology. Process of transmitting and 
adapting technology to a different productive apparatus, 
generally through its export from a developed to a less- 
developed country. 
Venture capital. Companies that finance innovations by 
taking a stake in firmsthat don’t have enough capital or suf- 
ficient guarantees to obtain long- term loans for such 
endeavours. Such capital is lost if the enterprise goes ban- 
Krupt.

Then the United States noticed with alarm that 
Japan,where research was dominated by industry, 
was scoring in advanced sectors such as information 
technology, electronics and new materials. As eco- 
nomic interests came to the fore, the idea that busi- 
ness was much more effective in ensuring people’s 
welfare than the political and scientific establishment 
became widespread. In this struggle for com petiti- 
vity, science lost its supremacy to technological 
“innovation” (pages 20-24). The main goal was to 
come up with new products and innovatory pro- 
duction methods. 
The power of a nation now depends on its eco- 
nomic performance—and therefore its capacity to 
innovate.All stakeholders, including the state and 
the universities, are supposed to strengthen this 
capacity. Research facilities have been rejigged to 
turn out new products more quickly and more 
cheaply (page 27). Scientists are valued less for 
their disinterestedness than for their feel for market 
efficiency. Barriers between public and private sec- 
tors have become blurred. Bridges have been built 
between the two which scientists cross in increasing 
numbers (page 20). The difference has also become 
fuzzy between basic and applied research, which 
now interact continually (page 23).The synergy is 
especially close in high-tech companies, which 
account for 40 per cent of private sector industrial 
R&D in the rich countries. 
These trends, which have developed with the 
globalization of world trade, have strengthened the 
grip of the big three—the United States, Europe and 
Japan—on research (pages 28-29). Some Asian 
countries, such as China (page 32), are boosting 
their capacity for innovation, but whole regions are 
being left out.Science outside the big three coun - 
tries registered significant advances at the beginning 
of the century—in medicine, agriculture, natural 
sciences and economics—and then grew strongly in 
new independent states. In the past few years, 
research activity has diminished in some Latin 
American countries. It has collapsed in the former 
Soviet bloc countries and is subject to “desertifi- 
cation” in black Africa. 
Meanwhile,research is being partly globalized 
itself as international co-operation grows (again, 
mainly between the big three and between Asian 
countries), if only because government spending on 
research has been cut in each country (page 30). 
The upheavals which have affected the world’s 
4.5 million or so scientists and engineers have set off

Who ow ns science? 
 
Budapest, 
world science capital 
D espite its astonishing progress and social and economic impact, science is currently facing 
a crisis of confidence and investment,as well as a debate about its ethics. UNEsco and 
the International Council for Science (Icsu) are organizing a conference in Budapest from June 
26 to July 1,1999 to discuss these and other issues. The gathering, called “ Science for the 
21st Century: a New Commitment”, will turn the city into the temporary world capital of science. 
According to UNesco's Director-General, Federico Mayor, the meeting, the first at this level 
for 20 years will enable “ scientists, decision-makers and other stake-holders to address the 
major issues at the interface between science and society together and negotiate a new social 
contract.” 
Bodies like the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (Ogcp), the Euro- 
pean Laboratory for Particle Physics (Cern) and the World Bank, along with Nature magazine 
and experts from all scientific fields, will have six days of discussions culminating in the adop- 
tion of two documents: a Declaration on Science, which will stress a political commitment to 
scientific progress, and a Science Agenda— Framework for Action, which will encourage scien- 
tific organizations to promote development and environmental improvement. 
lcsu’s Executive Director, Jean-Francois Stuyck-Taillandier, says that the most ground-brea- 
king feature of the Budapest meeting isthat scientists will come face to face with public and 
private sector decision-makers. “ We want to improve the public’s perception of science, show 
that much has been done, and that much remains to be done, but that we can’t do everything 
  
because there are ethical issues to be considered.” [| 
http://helix.nature.com/wcs/ 
lively debate. By trying to make science serve the 
market, is there not a risk of depriving most of 
humanity of its benefits? By forcing universities 
and state-funded laboratories to increase their pro- 
fitability, might we not kill off basic research, where 
the public sector plays a key role? How can we 
fight abuses of patenting, which is no longer limited 
to protecting the applications of research but now 
extends to “privatizing”certain discoveries? 
How can we fight the emergence of a culture of 
secrecy which threatens the free flow of knowledge 
(pages 25-26)? How can we prevent whole areas of 
research from being neglected, with only a few 
“technological pathways” being explored, when 
more and more firms are trying to establish mono- 
polies by imposing their standards? In the era of 
genetics and the virtual, how can we build ethical 
safeguards and reconcile the precautionary principle 
with that of maximum profitability? 
All these questions should spur international 
decision-makers to once more promote truly universal 
scientific activity (see box above). They should also 
draw public opinion into a debate that must be held 
about the funding and aims of research (pages 35-36). 
But before that can happen, people need to know 
what’s really happening. L

### 115864: A German chemist's double life

A German chemist’s 
double life Manfred Ronzheimer® 
Regina Reszka started out working in East Germany’s research 
laboratories. After the Berlin wall came down, she took a crash course 
in capitalism 
For Regina Reszka of Berlin, the hardest part 
} is juggling two careers: research and business. 
“There’s an abyss between the worlds of com- 
merce and science,’ says the 46-year-old chemist, 
who founded a biotechnology company called 
GOT in 1995. She embodies a new breed of 
scientist,found around the world, who are increa- 
singly at home with balance-sheets as well as test- 
tubes. Reszka has never stopped working in the 
lab and says she is still a researcher deep down. 
But these days, scientific results are not the only 
thing she is after. She must also come up with 
funding. 
GOT works on cancer-fighting substances 
based on liposomes, which are tiny drops of fat. 
The main gene-therapy technique the company 1s 
developing helps enhance them with bits of DNA 
capable of limiting the spread of cancer cells. It 
could be used in cases where chemo- or radiation 
therapy fails. 
Reszka was not trained to win markets and find 
sponsors. She studied chemistry in Leipzig before 
starting her career on the eastern side of the Berlin 
wall, at the cancer research institute that was a part 
of East Germany’s powerful Academy of Sciences. 
After reunification in 1990, she joined the Max 
Delbriick centre of molecular medicine (MDC), a 
major national research institution.But Reszka no 
longer found her work fulfilling. Tired of writing 
scientific articles and speaking at congresses, she 
wanted to help alleviate the suffering of cancer 
patients in a direct way. So she founded a company 
for what she calls “ethical” reasons. 
Reszka and her five colleagues started GOT with 
nothing but their savings (450,000 Deutschmarks, or 
$250,000). But they had good reason to think that the 
experience was worth trying. In the 1990s, many 
researchers in the former German Democratic Repu- 
blic caught the business bug.M any had lost their jobs 
when laboratories closed down and research insti- 
tutions were restructured in 1992. Several former 
Academy of Sciences institutes shut down, leaving 
14,000 scientists unemployed. T he result: the crea- 
tion of a slew of small companies. 


### 115865: The Science-tech convergence

The science-tech convergence 
Although conventional wisdom still sees basic science 
as distinct from industrial research, it is actually very hard to draw 
the line between the two 
Industrial managers are being asked today to 
A solve two seemingly contradictory problems: on 
the one hand, to produce more innovative pro- 
ducts based on the latest science, and on the other, 
to drastically cut costs and reduce the time it takes 
to get these products to the market. 
The first task requires access to the best university 
science, the capability to perform imaginative research, 
and a creative environment in which to innovate. T he 
second requires focus on near-term product sche- 
dules, disciplined use of resources, and limitations 
on technical risks. T hese requirements, which may pull 
in opposing directions, have always been with us. But 
in less competitive, less technically sophisticated times 
they were accomplished in sequence. A scientific dis- 
covery was followed by applied research to build a 
prototype of a commercial product. Only then would 
a company put its engineers to work,developing the 
processes to produce it. 
This sequential approach can take a long time. To 
take one example of the process of finding a com- 
mercial use for a scientific discovery, scientists have 
been trying for a decade to make materials that exhibit 
superconductivity at near room temperature. So far 
they have had little success, but if they do succeed, elec- 
tricity would flow without resistance, making pos- 
sible a new world of more efficient electrical devices. 
But early applications of the most radical disco- 
veries are seldom successful. So innovators today are 
focusing their energy on concurrent pursuit of both the 
science and the commercial idea. Science 1s no longer 
a stranger to technology; indeed, product and process 
ideas come together with science through basic 
research, leading to ever-improving technology.

### 115865: The Science-tech convergence

  
Lewis M. Branscomb 
The merging of scientific research and com- 
mercial innovation has been made possible by the 
total transformation of science and engineering 
since the Second World War. Before 1940 most 
technical knowledge was based on empirical obser- 
vation. T he power of scientific prediction based on 
mathematical theory was weak; new ideas could 
only be validated by building prototypes and testing 
them.Science, since the War, has made such extra- 
ordinary progress that all this has changed. 
Take the case of IBM's largest computers, in 
which the design of the product and the technology 
from which it is constructed must be developed 
concurrently. Faster circuits require a new archi- 
tecture for the computer. But you cannot test that 
architecture in a prototype without the new cir- 
cuits in hand. Product cycle times can be cut in half 
by computer simulation of both the circuits and the 
machine. When the first machine comes off the 
production line no working prototype has ever been 
built,except in cyberspace. >

Who owns science? 
  
The German government has encouraged 
biotechnology development for several years. In 
1996, the research ministry granted GOT a 1.4- 
million-Deutschmark (approximately $800,000) 
subsidy. In November 1998, the Ldnder of Berlin 
and Brandenburg awarded the company their 
Innovation Prize. Its team works at the Max 
Delbriick centre, which groups together hospi- 
tals, public institutions and laboratories rented 
out to private companies. One of GOT ’s star pro- 
cesses has been patented as part of an MDC- 
managed project. 
Reszka says the company’s priority is to begin 
the second stage of tests on this process. She 
needs “a partner with strong nerves” because the 
operation will cost 10 million Deutschmarks 
(approximately $5.5 million). She met several 
other recently-founded biotechnology firms and 
venture capital companies at the Bio-Europe 
Partnering conference held in Berlin in 
December 1998. Venture-capital firms invest in 
innovative projects, making big profits if major 
companies purchase their innovations and put 
them into mass production. 
American companies were out in force at the 
conference. With biotechnology innovation pro- 
gressing at a snail’s pace in North America since 
1997, they are increasingly interested in Europe. 
“I was amazed to hear Americans making me 
offers to set up a joint-venture right away,” says 
Reszka. “We're negotiating with two major lipo- 
some-manufacturers based in the United States.” 
Reszka is out to win the West—unless the opposi- 
te happens. u

### 115865: The Science-tech convergence

Even the most complicated molecules and mate- 
rials can now be designed to meet specific com- 
mercial needs. Computer codes and validated laws 
of nature can also be used to create molecules and 
materials that never existed in nature.Pharmaceu- 
tical companies that build designer molecules to 
have predictable therapeutic properties must work 
very close to the limits of chemical and biological 
knowledge. T he margin between basic science and 
applied technology is hard to find. 
Technology roadmaps to guide 
corporate strategy 
Basic science plays another essential role in 
high-technology innovation by making possible 
informed choices between alternative technologies. 
Robert Galvin, the imaginative former Chief Exe- 
cutive Officer of Motorola Corporationl, places 
great importance on the preparation of “technology 
roadmaps” to guide corporate technology strategy. 
These roadmaps describe what future improve- 
ments in technology our scientific knowledge allows. 
Using them, it is possible to pick the technology with 
the greatest promise for future improvement. 
In a situation where further improvements in a 
current technology are increasingly difficult to make, 
the timing of a decision to shift to an alternative 
with a more extendable future may be a life-and-death 
decision for the firm. Ralph Gomory, when director 
of research for IBM in the 1970s and early 1980s, 
organized teams of researchers to acquire the scien- 
tific knowledge that allows wise choices among tech- 
nologies. Analysis made on the basis of this approach 
governed IBM ’s decision to abandon the pursuit of 
superconducting Josephson junctions, a radical alter- 
native to the use of semiconductors in integrated 
circuits, as a replacement for more conventional 
silicon-based semiconductors. Similarly, IBM found 
the technology roadmap for silicon-gate semicon- 
ductor memory chips leading to many years of impro- 
vement, while the roadmap for the metal-gate tech- 
nology IBM was then using appeared to be 
dead-ended,even though it was cheaper at the time. 
Even the institutional setting for innovation is 
changing, challenging our conventional thinking about 
basic science as something distinct from industrial 
research. The central corporate laboratory is still the 
site for the basic research performed by the most 
technically aggressive, science-based firms. But these 
laboratories are smaller, and more focused in that 
common ground of motivated scientific and techno- 
logical research that I have described. And the role of 
technical innovator is shifting to the smaller, highly spe- 
cialized firms. 
These small and medium enterprises (SMEs) 
are more technically specialized firms that can move 
faster and with more imagination than their much 
bigger customers. They are often part of their cus- 
tomers’ innovation system, sharing, over the 
Internet, a computer design system that allows the 
SME to become a member of the larger firm’s 
design team. The result is a boost to productivity and 
innovation in the economy as a whole. It accounts

‘Jeffersonian science’ 
How should we describe the kind of research in 
which science and technology are merged and which 
1s motivated by visions of new possibilities? T he late 
Donald E. Stokes, of Princeton University, called 
such research “Pasteur’s Quadrant”, contrasting Louis 
Pasteur’s “use-inspired basic research” with what 
Danish nuclear physicist Niels Bohr called “pure basic 
research”. Harvard’s Gerald Holton reminds us that 
in the early 19th century President Thomas Jefferson 
commissioned the Lewis and Clark Expedition into the 
Pacific Northwest to collect very basic scientific infor- “ cl en fis fs p erform 
mation about ecology and Native American languages, 
but for a very clear and important applied purpose. 
“Jeffersonian science” may have the practical 
goals we associate with technology, but it must be per- 
formed in the creative, intellectually competitive 
environment we associate with basic science. Some 
might think that “basic technology research” is a 
contradiction in terms. I see it as characteristic of 
much industrial science. Once there is general accep- 
tance of the idea that science and high technology 
have merged and must be pursued concurrently, we 
can simply call the combination “research”. 
Of course, there is no way even the largest firm can 
be self-sufficient in scientific knowledge. Even the 
best corporate research laboratory can only be a 
window on the world of technical knowledge. Since the 
innovative SMEs have relatively short-term horizons, 
and the big companies have cut back on corporate 
research as they rely more on the SMEs, the burden 
for keeping the knowled ge base expanding falls on uni- 
versities and national research institutions. 
Most governments are trying to increase their 
investments in this knowledge infrastructure. In 
order to keep the work in touch with the world of 
industrial research, incentives are offered for colla- 
boration between universities and industry. Thus the 
innovation system is becoming a process carried out 
by a network of institutions, in which academic 
science, large company research, and SME inno- 
vation are linked. This is the direction in which all 
advanced economies are headed. u

### 115866: The Symbiosis of pure and applied science

of pure and applied science 
Fibre optics and medical scanners are among the many offshoots of the give-and-take 
between applied and pure science 
Little in life fits into neat boxes dividing one 
A set of objectives from another. And science is 
far from an exception. I have in mind the pre- 
mise that pure research, motivated exclusively by 
the search for knowledge for its own sake, has suf- 
fered from the rise in technological or applied 
research. As industry increasingly invests in and 
collaborates with the academic world, some people 
assume that scientists have strayed from the goal of 
“advancing knowledge” to “creating wealth”. 
There is no denying the trend towards indus- 
trial funding of university research which began in 
the 1970s and has since intensified. In the United 
States for example, industry’s share of academic 
R&D support rose from 2.6 percent in 1970 to 
almost seven per cent in 1995, an almost eight-fold 
increase in absolute R&D purchasing power. But 
aggregate data do not suggest that a rise in applied 
research means a cut in pure (also referred to as 
“fundamental” or “basic”) scientific research. 
There are several reasons. First, industrial money 
1s just too small a fraction of universities’ total 
research budgets to have such an effect. 
More importantly, in most areas of scientific 
endeavour, the goals are a mix of pure and applied 
research. In the past few decades, pure research 
has led to highly profitable and socially valuable 
products or knowledge. At the same time, profit- 
motivated inventions and new technologies—that 
1s to say, applied science—have provided new tools 
for breakthroughs in pure research. 
Einstein and the laser 
Consider the example of nuclear magnetic 
resonance (NMR). This was a “pure” research 
discovery made in 1946 on the ways in which cer- 
tain nuclei act as tiny magnets. Scientists then 
could scarcely have imagined the practical appli- 
cations which would lead to today’s multi-billion 
dollar industry in magnetic resonance medical 
imaging (MRI), which doctors use to scan the tis- 
sues and bones of patients in diagnosing cance- 
rous tumours or hair-line fractures. But the origi- 
nal discovery only provided the opportunity for 
the applications. To realize these required a great 
deal of additional sophisticated engineering, 
applied science and commercial development. 
Likewise, the notion of pure research being 
separate from applied science fails us in tracing 
the development of fibre-optic communications, 
in which glass or plastic fibres transfer light waves 
generated from lasers, whose amplitude is then 
modulated to carry information for telephone 
conversations or TV programmes. In 1905 Albert

Einstein first predicted the idea of stimulated 
emission of electromagnetic radiation, a pure 
research principle underpinning lasers. But it 
wasn’t until 1960 that T.H. Maiman, an 
American scientist, built the first laser. Yet, to 
actually use lasers for communications applica- 
tions required scientists to learn to make fine 
glass optical fibres of unheard of purity. To achie- 
ve that end, scientists needed to do fundamental 
research on the nature of defects and impurities 
in materials—but with a very well-defined practi- 
cal objective (i.e., communications). In addition, 
fibre-optic communications required a good deal 
of engineering. Thus, the journey from the pure 
scientific research of Einstein to the development 
of fibre-optic communications involved a com- 
plex interplay of pure research and application- 
motivated fundamental research. 
These examples demonstrate that the notion 
of pure and applied science waning and waxing at 
the expense of each other just doesn’t hold water. 
There are just a few fields—Ilike particle physics, 
cosmology and some areas of pure mathematics 
—in which the research agenda can be determi- 
ned exclusively by the conceptual structure of the 
subject without regard for possible societal or 
business applications. But generally speaking, 
pure science discoveries open up unsuspected 
opportunities of application, while at the same 
time the search for technological applications 
often invites us into new areas of fundamental 
research. u

### 115867: Staying ahead of the pack

Staying ahead of the pack 
The American firm Monsanto’s flagship product, Roundup, highlights a strongpoint 
of private-sector research—its capacity to create and market new products 
How does the giant chemical and biotechno- 
Bey company Monsanto manage to keep 
control of its herbicide Roundup, even 
though other companies now have the right to 
make it? The answer to this simple question 
reveals the power of private sector research. 
Under the pressure of competition, firms have 
developed formidable capacities to innovate and 
to market their discoveries. 
Monsanto, with a turnover of more than $8 
billion in 1998, is an excellent example of such a 
firm. Several of its discoveries have helped far- 
mers and consumers. It developed the biodegra- 
dable herbicide Roundup in the early 1970s. 
Farmers who use it are relieved of the long and 
tiresome job of weeding. They just have to take 
care not to damage their crops as they apply the 
herbicide, which can increase yields by an estima- 
ted 30-50 per cent and bring more land into cul- 
tivation. 
A big 
money-spinner 
Roundup, which can be used on about 100 
crops, is a big money-spinner for Monsanto, 
though its exact contribution to the firm’s profits 
1s not known. In the early 1990s, the herbicide’s 
patent expired in several European countries and 
the product was copied by rival firms. Monsanto 
did not lose control of it however. 
Monsanto’s research teams are in close and 
constant communication with the firm’s sales 
force, who monitor changes in the market, and 
with its strategic planners, who work out what 
kind of future a product has. So when Roundup 
was no longer legally protected, Monsanto was 
ready. Since 1989, the firm has come up with 
many by-products of the herbicide. These can be 
sold at a higher price than the basic product, 
whose manufacturing costs fell by around 20 per 
cent between 1990 and 1998. 
The economic goal of Monsanto’s researchers 
is to encourage work which is part of its industrial 
strategy and drop work which is outside it. 
Products arising from such research are also 
quickly put on the market. Monsanto, like most 
other chemical and pharmaceutical companies, 
spends four to five times more on advertising and 
marketing than it does on research in the strict 
sense. 
To stay ahead of the pack, the firm asks its 
researchers to anticipate changes in the market. 
In 1972, a biochemist in its agricultural division, 
Ernest Jawarsky, went back to university to study 
cell growth. Seven years later, he set up the firm’s 
Molecular Biology Group (MBG), which in 1982 
succeeded in genetically altering a plant’s cells. 
2 4 The Unesco Courier - May 1999 
The MBG has ties with consultants trained at 
many prestigious institutions, such as Berlin’s 
Max Planck Institute. In this way, it taps into the 
findings of state-funded research on the genome 
of plants to further its goal of extending the life of 
Roundup. 
In 1988, Monsanto announced it had develo- 
ped genetically-modified plants that were immu- 
ne to Roundup. If farmers used them, they would 
no longer have to take precautions to prevent the 
herbicide from damaging their crops. The compa- 
ny is creating new outlets. Cotton, for example, 
requires a lot of herbicides but is damaged by 
some of them. By developing a cotton seed resis- 
tant to Roundup, Monsanto opened up a new 
market—one for new seeds—and at the same 
time expanded the market for its own herbicide, 
which can now be used by cotton growers. 
Industrial research often seems more valuable 
and less suspect than publicly funded research, 
which is sometimes accused of going off in expen- 
sive directions. There 1s a downside, however. To 
ensure profitability, Monsanto has dropped entire 
areas of research. Its new products are also 
increasingly seen as a threat to the environment 
by those who oppose genetically-modified orga- 
nisms (GMO). They are also condemned by 
those who think plant seeds should remain part of 
the common heritage of humanity. u

. There was a time when basic scientific know- 
ledge was considered primarily to be a public 
good. The argument was that since most of it 
was produced through public funding—namely the 
government’s support of universities—and intended 
to benefit society as a whole, no one should be able 
to control access to it by others. 
Today, however, all that has changed.The key 
role of science at the heart of the modern “know- 
ledge economy” means that what was previously 
seen as a public good is being transformed into a pri- 
vate commodity. 
Two industries in particular have been respon- 
sible for this shift. One is the biotechnology industry, 
where information about the detailed structure of 
living cells and individual genes, previously of 
interest primarily to the laboratory biologist, now 
offers the possibility of being rapidly transformed 
into profitable pharmaceutical products or medical 
screening technologies. 
The second is the information technology industry. 
Up to now, mathematical formulae were considered 
to be too abstract—and, by implication, too accessible 
to anyone with the appropriate intellectual skills—to 
be considered private property. But the reliance of high- 
powered computing on sophisticated mathematical 
algorithms has led to a growing acceptance that even 
mathematical formulae can in certain circumstances 
be treated as private property.

A controversial 
trend 
Under challenge in both cases is an important 
distinction that,previously, was used to define the 
limit of what could be patented.This is the dis- 
tinction between a scientific “discovery” (which 
could not be patented) and a technical “invention” 
(which can). 
Today, however, the speed with which scientific 
discoveries can be turned into technical products 
and the large commercial profits that can be gene- 
rated by this process means that, in practice, the dis- 
tinction between discovery and invention has 
become blurred.As a result, the moral distinction 
between what should and what should not be 
patented has once again become highly conten- 
tious. 
Industry’s argument is straightforward. If it has 
“paid” for a certain useful scientific discovery by 
supporting the scientists—either in its own labora- 
tories, or even in a university—who made it, then it 
has a right to seek a return on its investment by char- 
ging others for using this discovery (or even keeping 
it for its own exclusive use).

“In practice,the distinction between invention 
and discovery in areas such as genetics and infor- 
mation technology is becoming increasingly mea- 
ningless and irrelevant,” says patent lawyer Simon 
Cohen of the London-based company Taylor 
Johnson Garrett. 
This interpretation is increasingly accepted by 
the courts. In a number of landmark cases, for 
example, both U.S. and European courts have 
upheld the claim that the knowledge of the sequence 
In practice, the distinction 
between invention and discovery 
in areas such as genetics 
and information technology 
is becoming increasingly

of chemical bases that makes up a human or animal 
gene—whose undisputed status as a major “disco- 
very” is endorsed by its announcement in the pages 
of prestigious journals such as Nature and S cience— 
can be patented. 
The only caveat is that this knowledge must be 
shown to have some potential commercial value. But 
that is seldom difficult to demonstrate, for example 
by using knowledge of, say, a gene discovered to be 
involved in breast cancer to design a test to seek out 
mutations in the gene that indicate increased sus- 
ceptibility to the disease. The courts have given 
similar endorsement to the patenting of mathema- 
tical algorithms. 
At the same time, however, this trend—and par- 
ticularly the patenting of scientific discoveries on 
living processes such as animal cell lines or genetically 
engineered animals—has become increasingly the 
target of critics such as environmentalists and animal 
rights supporters concerned at the potential implica- 
tions on control of access to scientific knowledge that 
it represents. 
Three criticisms in particular are being widely 
heard. The first,primarily from the scientific com- 
munity, is that the growing ability to patent scien- 
tific “discoveries” is encouraging researchers to 
construct a wall of secrecy around their work that 
directly challenges the traditions of open commu- 
nication on which modern science has depended for 
its vitality and success. 
Up to now, science has thrived on the sharing of 
experimental results, often very preliminary, between 
colleagues. Much of science develops through debates 
that take place in forums that can range from the

» laboratory coffee room to international conferences. 
But scientists are now being warned that, if 
they discuss their results openly prior to publishing 
them 1n a scientific journal, they run two risks. One 
1s that, if someone reports these discussions—ifor 
example, in the proceedings of a conference—this 
can be taken as a form of “publication” that can jeo- 
pardize their chance of being awarded a patent. 
This 1s because, at least in Europe, a patent appli 
cation must be made before an invention or discovery 
1s made public (the rules in the United States are 
more flexible,allowing a scientist a “grace period” of 
12 months after publication of a new discovery 
during which a patent application can be filed). 
The second risk 1s that an unscrupulous col- 
league, overhearing an original idea from another 
researcher,may hastily incorporate it mto his or her 
own patent application, without divulging where the 
idea originated from. 
In order to avoid either situation arising, scien- 
tists are now being advised—tfor example, by patent 
lawyers—not to divulge their results to colleagues 
until it has been completed and full patent protec- 
tion has been applied for. 
Secrecy 
on the campus 
The result 1s a growing “culture of secrecy” in 
universities where even researchers working in 
neighbouring laboratories are reported to be increa- 
singly reluctant to discuss their findings,even though 
failure to do so may slow down the scientific dis- 
COVEry process. 
The 1ssue of growing secrecy on university cam- 
puses was highlighted at a recent meeting sponsored 
jomtly by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
and the American Association for the Advancement 
of Science. 
“Part of the failure lies with academics who think 
‘by God, I'm going to be rich,” Alan Goldhammer of 
the Biotechnology Industry Organization told the 
The argument is that those countries 
that are already the most 
economically powerful are being 
allowed to increase their dominance 
by exploiting the fact that they also 
control access to the scientific 
knowledge that increasingly 
provides the basis of this power 
 
meeting. John Deutch, former dean of science at 
MIT, described secrecy as “a major threat to science 
and .. . antithetical to the purpose of universities.” 
A second criticism, coming mainly from critics 
of genetic engineering, 1s that permitting patents on 
biomedical discoveries—such as new genes, or even 
parts of genes—is inherently immoral, as humans 
have no moral basis for claiming commercial rights 
over living matter. 
The third question addresses the issue of North- 
OR : 
SAY The Unesco Courier - May 1999 
      
South equity in a world where both scientific knowledge 
and economic power are unequally divided. Here the 
argument 1s that those countries that are already the most 
economically powerful are bem g allowed to increase their 
dominance by exploiting the fact that they also control 
access to the scientific knowledge that mcreasingly provides 
the basis of this power. 
The battle 1s far from over. Many scientists, for 
example, are now insisting that information derived 
from their efforts be placed in the public domain. Those 
attending an international meeting in Bermuda in 
February 1996, for example, designed to establish a 
common framework for human genome sequencing— 
deciphering the precise sequence of the amino-acid 
bases that make up a single strand of human DNA— 
urged that all sequence data produced by centres funded 
for large-scale sequencmg should be placed in the public 
domain. 
Most of those engaged in these debates accept that 
the distinction between discovery and invention 1s no 
longer, m itself, a valid basis for determining the boun- 
dary line between public and private knowledge. The 
challenge ahead 1s to rewrite the rules of the game in a 
socially equitable and morally acceptable way. H

### 115869: The Big three get together

The big three get together 
According to Japanese researcher Yoshiko Okubo*, European,American 
and Japanese research policies are converging 
“To know one knows 
what one knows, and 
to know one is 
ignorant of what one 
does not know :that is 
true science.” 
Confucius, 
Chinese philosopher 
(555-479 B.C.) 
UNnesco’s World Science Report describes 
three main models for conducting and funding 
scientific research. What’s your thinking 
about this? 
There certainly are three major models. By and 
large, Japan invests very little in defence, and 
industry still dominates research. Europe empha- 
sizes basic civil research and the United States puts 
more stress on military research. But the three 
models are converging. 
How did these “models” develop and why are they 
converging? 
As far back as the late 19th century, Japan 
focused on applied science to catch up with the 
West. After the Second World War, all the major 
industrialized countries made massive invest- 
ments in basic research, which they considered 
the driving force behind progress. Japan couldn’t 
afford such a luxury at that time. But once it 
became a world power, it realized that it could 
produce itself the knowledge that gives rise to 
technological innovation. In the 1970s, the 
government began investing more in research, 
almost 80 per cent of which was financed by the 
private sector. In 1995, it earmarked some $140 
billion for research over a five-year period (1995- 
2000). The primary goal is to strengthen public 
institutions and basic research. 
Europe and the United States have moved in 
the opposite direction. After the Second World 
War, they went for pure research. Their econo- 
mies were flourishing. The prevailing ideology 
suggested that science would bring economic and 
social progress. In the 1970s, those countries 
became aware that basic research, which is very 
expensive, was not always profitable in the short 
term.And Japan’s example showed that economic 
growth was not necessarily linked to investment 
in pure research. 
After the Cold War, the United States curbed 
their military budget and went all-out on research 
directed towards industrial applications, at the 
expense of basic research. Today, they are shifting the 
balance of their strategy. In Europe, the United 
Kingdom was the first country to encourage the rise 
of industrial research. Even France, which places 
very strong emphasis on basic research, is going 
down that road. 
Might this change in focus not be harmful in the 
long run? 
Nowadays,a country’s economic performance 
depends more than ever on its capacity to innovate. 
Research 1s adapting to this world trend and is 
being harnessed to the economy. But governments, 
especially in North America, have become aware 
that they cannot neglect basic research. In the short 
term, applied research undoubtedly leads to tech- 
nological innovation.But in the long run,without 
the reservoir of knowledge produced by basic 
research, innovation breaks down.E ven corporations 
have made a commitment to basic research, which 
until now was conducted in public-sector labora- 
tories funded by the state. To create new products, 
they need scientists capable of understanding what 
is going on in the public sector, building relations 
with that sector and drawing on its results. 
Today, the problem no longer lies in deciding 
whether basic or applied research should be the 
priority, but in striking a balance between them, dis- 
tributing tasks and organizing exchanges between 
universities and the corporate world. Many coun- 
tries are experimenting with these issues and looking 
for solutions. France encourages graduate students 
to work with corporations and public-sector resear- 
chers to set up their own businesses. Japan is urging 
academics to patent their breakthroughs in order to 
profit from them and to co-operate more closely 
with private industry, which used to be considered 
as a comedown. u

### 115870: A Global snapshot of scientific trends

A global snapshot of scientific 
Data on the output of scientific publications show that the world’s 
scientific hierarchy has remained remarkably stable over the past decade, 
with the continued domination of the U.S.-Japan-Europe triad 
The top twenty 
The table at right ranks countries in terms of their 
share of world scientific output as measured by the 
production of articles that appear in scientific publi- 
cations!. There is remarkable continuity between the 
two periods considered, with the same 20 countries 
appearing on both lists. The United States accounts 
for the lion’s share of scientific activity, producing 
more than one-third of all publications recorded by the 
SCI database. There is however, strong competition 
for the runner-up position. Although this is still held 
bythe UK, Japan inched up its share by 1.3% and Ger- 
many by 1.2%. In the latter’s case, unification played 
a part,even though the GDR never accounted for 1% 
of total output. 
Taken as an entity, the European Union has 
improved its position and has gained a competitive 
edge: it succeeded in overtaking the U.S., with 35.9% 
of all papers signed by an author with a European 
address between 1990 and 1995, against 35.1% by 
a U.S.author. India’s decrease is cause for concern 
and could reflect an unfortunate draining of scientists 
towards the bureaucratic and political arena. 
1.This overview of trends and patterns in world science is 
based on the Scientific Citation Index (SCI) database 
established for bibliographic purposes by the Institute for 
Scientific Information (ISI) in Philadelphia, USA. 
Regarded as one of the most accurate reflections of where 
countries stand in terms of research activity, the SCI 
measures scientific output by the number of articles 
published in scientific journals. The database provides 
systematic coverage of the articles from the 2,500 most 
cited scientific journals. It should also be stressed that data 
Highs and lows 
The table at right indicates those countries 
which have shown the highest and the lowest 
growth rate in terms of publication output. 
Foreseeably, Asian countries come out in the top 
positions, showing impressive growth. Spain’s 
advance over the past decade is partly linked to its 
integration into the programmes of various 
European organizations. The same holds for 
Portugal and Greece. These three countries are 
the only ones in Europe that posted significant 
growth rates. In contrast, countries in transition 
such as the Czech Republic and Russia show a 
marked decline in output, as does India.

that output is practically equal in the U.S.and the

40% in the EU because of the links between 
scientists from different European countries. 
Data can also provide a more detailed insight 
into how international collaboration evolves over 
time. In one analysis, links between 14 countries? 
were studied between 1985 and 1995 using the 
Salton measure, which distinguishes weak, 
medium and strong links. The change is striking: 
whereas in 1985, only 7 countries, all developed 
ones, had international co-operation links, all of 
which were weak, in 1995, the picture was signi- 
ficantly different.All 14 countries had internatio- 
nal co-operation links with one or more coun- 
tries, and in 7 cases, they were strong ones. 
Although weak, the two developing countries in 
the selection—Argentina and Mexico—both for- 
ged links over this period. 
International co-authorship reflects more than 
collaboration between individual scientists. It 
points to emerging partnerships between the insti- 
tutions behind the scientists, namely academia, 
government and industry. In developed countries, 
these are becoming the norm. In less developed 
ones, industry’s participation in the funding of 
science is often extemely weak or non-existent, 
hindering international collaboration. Sometimes, 
this is counterbalanced by the state, when public 
science is recognized as an important engine of 
economic progress in the global economy. u

Publication profiles 
As well as measuring scientific activity in terms of the number of articles published, data also 
enable us to draw up different publication profiles pointing to relative specializations that 
are specific to different parts of the world. Four main models can be distinguished: 
The “ Western model” characterizespublication patternsin the developed Western countries, 
where clinical medicine and biomedical research are the leading fields of specialization; 
The model specific to the former countries of the Soviet bloc,along with China,where the 
emphasis has traditionally been on chemistry and physics; 
The bioenvironmental model is more specific to Australia and to developing countries, where 
efforts are concentrated in the fields of biology, earth and space sciences; 
The Japanese model,now also characteristic of other developed Asian economies, is predo- 
minantly focused on the engineering sciences and chemistry. [| 
The North-South gap 
hy does so much scientific research— and more 
and more— originate from the the United Sates, the 
European Union and Japan? Their share of it, as measured 
by the number of scientific publications increased from 
73.3% in 1990 to 74.8% in 1995.1 
John Rumble, chairman of the International Council 
for Science’s committee on data for science and techno- 
logy (CODATA), believes that the answer lies in the close 
correlation between research capacity and economic 
power.“ The percentages of government funds devoted to 
research are approximately the same, regardless of the 
countries,” he says, at least among large and medium ran- 
king countries. 
Just as national budgets vary widely, so there are huge 
differences in research budgets from country to country. 
And since inequalities of wealth persist, the interna- 
tional scientific hierarchy is not about to change. The 
growing role of privately-funded research will not alter the 
situation either, says Rumble, since the strength of a 
country’s business sector is also proportional to national 
wealth. 
The rise of the Internet has confirmed the trend. 
“Many new research activities have been generated by 
the Web,” says Rumble. The richer a country is, the more 
it uses the Internet.And the cost of “admission” to the 
club of world scientific powersis increasingly high. Before 
a country can take off, it has to create a “critical mass” 
of R&D resources. But the investment required for thisis 
beyond the means of many developing countries, espe- 
cially the 48 of them at the foot of the ladder. 
Some people blame these inequalities on human 
factors. South African scientist Fanie de Beer says the 
importance of scientific knowledge is often played down 
in the countries of the South in order to resist “ a blatant 
imperialistic promotion of science and technology in the 
Western sense” . He also points to the deadlocks that have 
resulted from attempts to impose rich country models on 
the nations of the South without taking into account 
local conditions. Special formulas must be “invented,” he 
says, which are based on “ a productive integration of dif- 
ferent forms of knowledge,” including “non-Western 
and non-scientific forms”. 
Many scientists who cannot find in their own country 
the basic material conditions in which to live decently and 
do their job continue to leave for exile abroad. This brain 
drain weakens the weak and strengthens the strong. It’s 
a vicious circle. [|

Peruvian fishermen have known about El Nifio for 
L hundreds of years, but until now they have never 
been able to predict when it would strike. In 1982/83, 
this recurring weather pattern caused an estimated $8 to 
$13 billion in damages. T hen, even the world’s leading cli- 
mate experts were not much wiser than local fishermen. 
But when the 1997/98 El Nifio appeared—the strongest 
on record—a vast international monitoring network was 
in place. With a few months warning, farmers in Brazil 
and Australia were able to switch to crops that would not 
be hit by the coming drought, while some other countries, 
expecting floods,delayed construction projects and built 
barriers. 
El Nino happens when there is a reversal in the 
usual wind and surface temperature patterns in the tro- 
pical Pacific. Scientists knew that the world’s oceans 
play an important role in determining climate by sto- 
ring and transporting large quantities of heat energy, 
but they knew little about how oceans interact with the 
atmosphere. By the early 1980s, a new generation of 
supercomputers had appeared able to run complex cli- 
mate models. What was missing were the data from a 
very wide area. 
In 1979, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmos- 
pheric Administration (NOAA) had a research project in 
the equatorial Pacific, measuring ocean current in real 
time from a buoy moored on the equator. But the costs 
ofthe 1982/83 El Nifio led the U.S. to be among the first 
Peter Coles” 
countries to support an ambitious international 
research project on the tropical oceans. The synergy 
between researchers around the globe made it possible 
to envisage a bigger project than any one country 
was willing to finance. 
Born in 1985, the 18-nation Tropical Ocean and 
Global Atmosphere Program (TOGA) started a 
decade of observations that helped to minimize the 
impact of the 1997/8 El Nilo. Its long-term aim was 
to establish an observation network to predict cli- 
mate. By the end of the project, in 1995, an array of 
about 70 buoys—the Tropical Atmosphere Ocean 
Array (TAO)—was in place, straddling the equatorial 
Pacific. These continue to send real-time measures of 
sea surface temperature, surface wind and salinity 
via satellites, to research centres that use the data to test 
and fine-tune climate models. Ships are assigned full 
time to placing and servicing the buoys. It is a costly 
task, but the annual $18 million that the U.S.alone 
invested was a small price compared to the estimated 
$2 billion they lost in the 1982/83 El Niiio. 
Measuring sea level by satellite 
Unlike the atmosphere, the scale of some ocean 
phenomena can be relatively small—10 to 100 km 
across—so many more data points are needed. Fur- 
thermore, climate modelling and forecasting require an 
uninterrupted series of data. When T OG A started, a few 
satellites were making obser vations of the sea surface, 
but cloud cover frequently obscured their view. With the 
1992 launching of the Franco-U.S. Topex/Poseidon 
satellite equipped with two radar altimeters that could 
see through cloud, it became possible to measure sea 
level to within a few centimetres. Scientists involved with 
TOGA were able to convert this information into 
temperature data. 
When TOGA ended in 1995, the scientists 
regrouped under a new $100 million per year pro- 
gramme—Climate Variability and Predictability 
(CLIVAR)—continuing for 15 years. Using the same 
buoys, these scientists first detected an unusual rise in 
temperature below the surface in the tropical Pacific 
early in 1997—irst signs of an El Nifio. Combining the 
buoy data with satellite images, they were able to track 
its onset almost daily. When it was clearly building 
up, the U.S. National Climate Centre broadcast data 
on the Internet. El Nifio watch centres established in 
some of the vulnerable countries like Peru were able to 
take action while others like Kenya, which did not 
have such facilities, were ill-prepared when floods and 
drought hit. 
The success of TOGA and CLIVAR in predicting 
the 1997/98 El Nilo has confirmed that the invest- 
ment was worthwhile. Now, scientists’ main aim is to 
make their forecasting models even more reliable, by 
combining a supply of data from the buoys with 
images from new Jason satellites. T he longer ahead 
El Nifo is detected, the greater the opportunity vul- 
nerable nations have of taking action. u

### 115872: Former USSR: halting the brain drain

FORMER USSR: halting the brain drain 
Jasmina Sopova* 
Low wages and a poor public image have forced more than 
half Russia’s scientists to quit science in the last 10 years. International co-operation 
is trying to repair the damage 
* Unesco Courier journalist 
“Freedom 
is for science what air 
is for an animal” 
Henri Poincaré, 
French mathematician 
(1854-1912) 
|] 
When Alexei Perchuk joined Moscow’s presti- 
L gious Institute of Geology, Mineralogy, Petro- 
chemistry and Geochemistry in 1987, he was 
looking forward to a glittering career in the best tra- 
dition of Soviet science. The son of an eminent 
university professor and,like him, a petrochemist, 
the 24-year-old graduate was fulfilling a dream of 
many fellow students at that time, for whom a job 
as a researcher was still a great honour. 
Today only Academicians still have real status. 
Rank and file researchers like Perchuk no longer 
do. A 1996 public opinion poll by Moscow’s 
Centre for Science Research and Statistics sho- 
wed that the three most prestigious professions in 
Russia were business, banking and politics. The 
three least respected groups were researchers, the 
military and engineers. Very low pay—Perchuk 
earns about 800 rubles ($30) a month—has com- 
pletely devalued the work of scientists and engi- 
neers. 
To escape poverty, Russian scientists have 
three choices—go into industry and earn about 
$100 a month, become a “businessman” and 
hope to earn millions, or go abroad. A dozen of 
Perchuk’s friends have already made up their 
minds—half of them have gone into business and 
the rest have left the country. 
Perchuk himself hasn’t decided yet. His affec- 
tion for his country and his work still overrides his 
money problems. Financially speaking, the insti- 
tute where he works belongs to the privileged few 
that have been given priority status by the govern- 
ment. As a result, its scientists work in good 
 
   
    
  
  
    
conditions and none of them has yet left for 
abroad. But while there have been no departures, 
no one new has been hired for the past 10 years. 
This means that after 12 years, Perchuk is still 
one of the Institute’s youngest researchers. 
At national level, the situation is catastrophic. 
UNEScO’s 1998 World Science Report says Russia 
had about 900,000 scientists involved in research 
and development (R&D) when the Soviet Union 
collapsed in 1991. Four years later there were only 
half a million. T he figures are similar in other former 
Soviet republics, especially in Armenia, where R&D 
scientists fell from 15,000 to only 3,000 over the 
same period. 
EU initiatives 
Since 1993, the European Union has become 
the main partner of Russia and the other former 
members of the Soviet Union grouped as the Com- 
munity of Independent States (CIS).1 It has stepped 
up its aid in the hope of giving new life to its own 
research and helping the ex-Soviet scientists. Com- 
mitments so far total about $155 million. 
The International Association for the Promotion 
of Co-operation with Scientists from the Newly 
Independent States of the Former Soviet Union 
(INTAS) has so far backed more than 1,200 projects 
to the tune of $69 million. T he International Science 
and Technology Centre (ISTC), founded in 
Moscow in 1994, has sunk more than $120 million 
into projects mainly to do with conversion from mili- 
tary research. 
In February 1999, the European Union and 
the Russian Federation reached agreement on a 
project for scientific and technological co-operation. 
Apart from cash, the accord enables the signatories 
to take part in each other’s research programmes, 
except in nuclear matters. T he main fields are space 
research, telecommunications, environment and 
transport. 
The five main co-operation programmes with 
Western countries (the European Union,Sweden, 
Norway, Iceland, Switzerland, Israel, the United 
States and Canada) add up to about $320 million. 
Will this be enough to halt the brain drain? If this 
money was used to pay the CIS’s 750,000 resear- 
chers a monthly salary of $1,000,it would only be 
enough to pay half of them, for one month. nu

of the former USSR and is home to 97.2 per cent of its 
population.

### 115873: China: a market-minded contender

CHINA: 2 market-minded contender 
Ted Plafker* 
Chinese science has lagged for centuries. But economic reforms have given science in the 
world’s most populous nation a new life 
\ 
\ 
Centuries before Europe emerged from the 
Middle Ages, China’s scientists began wor- 
king in advanced mathematics and astronomy, 
and had already claimed credit for inventing paper, 
gunpowder, the compass, and the mechanical clock. 
These great and early scientific achievements are 
today well known to virtually every Chinese school- 
child. But these same schoolchildren know just as 
clearly that China now lags behind in science and 
technology. 
Chinese officials, of course, know it too. But 
they also understand many of the reasons and they 
have launched numerous initiatives to revitalize Chi- 
nese science. T he strategy centres on prodding scien- 
tists to commercialize their research. While it may be 
too early to yet call China a force in international 
science, the country has clearly become a player. 
The impediments to scientific progress have 
been both ancient and modern.With people and 
their labour being more abundant than any other 
resource, incentives for labour-saving scientific 
innovations have traditionally been scarce. 
More recently China has heaped other burdens 
on its science establishment. One was the admi- 
nistrative structure it adopted in the early 1950s 
from the Soviet Union. By placing nearly all scien- 
tific institutions under the military, the govern- 
ment, or the central Academy of Sciences, China 
replicated one of the Soviet system’s main flaws: a 
structure that left impenetrable institutional walls 
between those who created good science and those 
who could apply it. 
In the late 1950s, Mao Zedong launched 20 
years of political mayhem and Chinese science 
came to a virtual standstill. 
Commercializing research 
When the dust settled in 1978, Deng Xiaoping 
was in charge and eager to re-open to the world. 
Since then, China has done much to break down 
walls between researchers and producers. Rather 
than directly funding research from state coffers, 
China has encouraged scientists to commercialize 
their own results and generate their own funding for 
further research. 
Addressing China’s parliament in March 1999, 
Premier Zhu Rongji spoke again of “the problem of 
most scientific and technical personnel being 
divorced from enterprises and markets”. 
One of the main ways in which the government 
tries to encourage commercialization of scientific 
research is the 11-year-old Torch Programme which 
provides seed capital for technology start-ups. Local 
governments across China have sought to create

“technology development zones” that offer firms 
favourable conditions and tax incentives. In addition, 
the central government has promised to make it 
easier for high-tech firms to be listed on the coun- 
try’s stock exchanges. 
But Chinese corporate investment in science 
and technology development is low, accounting for 
only 0.39 per cent of sales volume.Even for high-tech 
enterprises, the figure reaches only 0.6 per cent, or one 
tenth the level of spending in developed countries. 
Although the government encourages greater 
private investment in science, growth has been slow. 
Officials estimate that overall private investment 
increased only 2.9 per cent last year. Government 
spending however continues to rise. The 1999 
budget calls for a 9.5 per cent increase in the cen- 
tral allocations for science and technology. This 
brings total state and enterprise spending to more 
than $14 billion, equivalent to roughly 1.5 per cent 
Who owns science? 
 
Still, China is emerging as a contender. Foreign 
scientists and foreign firms are increasingly eager to 
co-operate with Chinese colleagues. More foreign 
firms (including the likes of IBM) are basing 
research facilities in China. The country frequently 
launches communications satellites for other 
nations. And China is engaging in increasingly 
ambitious projects,like a $60 million scheme with 
Germany to launch a one-tonne solar space teles- 
cope in 2003. 
More telling still is the fact that China’s own 
brightest scientists are showing more interest in 
working in their own country. Since 1978, China has 
sent 300,000 students abroad, the vast majority 
for science or technology training. More than two 
thirds have stayed abroad,however,and this brain 
drain has cost China some of its best talent. But 
according to the Ministry of Education, the number 
or returning students is rising rapidly, and there are 
  
of gross domestic product. now more students returning than leaving. u 


### 115874: Latin America: a tough transition

Latin America: 
a tough transition 
Governments, researchers and industry will have to join forces for science in Latin America 
to serve the region’s needs

Scientific Studies at the 
Venezuelan Institute for Scientific 
Research,Caracas. 
“Look for science as 
far as China. 
Taken from the Hadith,

the deeds and sayings of the

|
Until now, more than 80 per cent of Latin 
I American science has been funded by the 
public sector. But until now, states have 
actually done little more to encourage the growth 
of the scientific community than handing out 
occasional scholarships or backing university 
courses on the grounds that this is “good” for the 
country. But there is no sign of real national 
science policies. 
So the development of science has been anar- 
chic, shaped by the intellectual interests and incli- 
nations of a scientific community whose members 
are more interested in working in advanced fields 
than in those directly related to society’s basic 
needs. 
The region’s economic capacity is a major obs- 
tacle to investment in science.Scientific and tech - 
nological infrastructure is poorly developed, with 
R&D budgets less than 0.5 per cent of GDP. It is 
significant that no Latin American countries feature 
among the world’s top 20 nations in terms of indus- 
trial and technological patents. However a few 
countries, including Argentina, Brazil and Mexico, 
have excellent records in research and innovation. 
For the past 15 years, the World Bank and the 
Inter-American Development Bank have played a 
big part in encouraging governments to push applied 
research and build bridges between research and 
industry. But links with national centres of pro- 
duction are still in their infancy, mainly because 
industrial sectors are weak and small and generate 
Hebe Vessuri* 
little demand for local research. T he result is that the 
scientific community hesitates to change its priori- 
ties or set more practical goals attuned to the market. 
What’s more, the most advanced sectors of 
national production are subsidiaries of foreign firms. 
These have access to the parent company’s labora- 
tories and to exchange agreements with foreign 
universities. In recent years, such firms have realized 
that Latin America has excellent human resources 
and labs and are starting to use them. T his could give 
The scientific community

a new boost to scientific research. 
Science and technology in Latin America are in 
a transitional phase, in which the scientific com- 
munity is having to rethink its role and learn how to 
co-operate with other sectors. At the same time, 
governments will have to adapt their policies on 
science and technology to local conditions and 
mediate between universities, labs and industry. 
Governments are less and less likely to be able to 
subsidize academic research and ambitious tech- 
nological programmes which cannot be put to edu- 
cational,economic or social use. [|

A plant disaster . . . the twentieth century bears 
many tragic scars to remind us that the pro- 
gressive and emancipatory role of science and tech- 
nology cannot be taken for granted. 
Such terrible events, together with loss of life due 
to disasters in mines, factories and transport systems 
have triggered public disenchantment with science 
and technology. Indicators of these anxieties are the 
rise of anti-nuclear and environmental movements 
in the West and the growing influence of people’s 
science movements (PSMs). In India, for example, 
PSM such as the Kerala Shastra Sahitya Parishad 
(KSSP) are struggling to inculcate such scientific 
values as sceptical questioning, to improve peo- 
ple’s scientific literacy and to relate the results of 
science and technology to the basic needs of people. 
For many, this disenchantment is fuelled by 
other trends. The problems are particularly acute in 
the developing countries, which account for less than 
10 per cent of world expenditure in science and 
technology research. 
As part of the globalization process, the concep- 
tion of science as a “market good” has spread to 
these countries as a result of policies based on eco- 
nomic liberalization and privatization. This new 
conception of science, in which market-based cri- 
teria are applied to evaluate and regulate research, has 
challenged the prevailing mode of science as a public 
good, and there are clear signs that research serving 
the ideal of “science as a public good” is stagnating or 
being cut back. This is a serious problem in developing 
countries like India where over 80 per cent of research 
and development is funded from public sources. 
  
V.V. Krishna* 
In these countries,science academics and pro- 
fessional societies have a major social responsibility 
to safeguard science from commercial interests 
driven by the logic of knowledge as private property. 
The state should sustain science as a public good 
until these societies are able to absorb the shocks 
generated by market forces. 
Some advances in science and technology chal- 
lenge widely held ethical values. The information 
revolution has impinged on personal privacy, and the 
possibilities unleashed by the biological revolution 
interfere with the uniqueness and natural processes 
of human beings. 
There are also signs that some scientific and 
technological innovations have a disturbing capacity 
for harm. In agriculture chemical pesticides and her- 
bicides bearing long-term risks to human beings are 
used on a mass scale. Violent experiments are 
conducted on animals to test safety devices and 
chemical hazards. As the Indian scholar and envi- 
ronmentalist Kamla Chowdhry has observed, “the 
kind of technologies that the major nations of the 
world have been developing in the military, agri- 
culture and consumer industries have led to ‘vio- 
lence’, accompanied by loss of values such as com- 
passion,helpfulness, reverence and spirituality.” 
Closely associated with the violent and hege- 
monistic aspects of modern science and technology 
are questions of equity and sustainable consump- 
tion. T he idea of sustainable development cannot be 
divorced from the structure of consumption patterns 
in modern societies. The crucial issue here is whe- 
ther developed countries are ready to cut down the 
consumption levels which are draining non-rene- 
wable resources. 
All these issues lead to a single question: what 
can be done to ensure that science and technology 
meet the basic needs of society today, particularly 
in low- and medium-income countries. I believe that 
a new social contract needs to be made between 
science and society through the democratic process. 
There are four key ingredients in this process. 
Decision-making. This should not be monopolized 
by a scientific and political elite, often joined by pri- 
vate corporate interests. Decision-making systems 
should be enlarged to include representatives of a 
wide range of interest groups, people’s science 
groups and other social stakeholders. 
Since the welfare of the majority and the equi- 
table distribution of resources are fundamental to 
democracy, the democratization of technical change 
and the establishment of priorities in science and 
technology call for new forms of participatory 
decision-making and the creation of institutional »

» “safety nets”. For example, isolated tribal commu- 
nities in the developing world should be repre- 
sented on official regulatory commissions on sub- 
jects such as biodiversity and biotechnology. The 
relevance of international regimes like those pro- 
posed by the United Nations Conference on Envi- 
ronment and Development held in Rio de Janeiro 
in 1992 and the Convention on Biodiversity should 
be re-examined from the perspective of such com- 
munities. In developing countries, where a major 
proportion of the research effort favours the 
demands and needs of privileged sections of their 
societies, governments should foster participatory 
decision-making systems. Governments should also 
increase research expenditure related to safety by 
both the public and the private sector. 
Social control. In order to control the advancing 
forces of technological determinism more should 
be done to educate people about the impact science 
and technology will have on their lives. Science acti- 
vist groups like those which have grown up in India 
have an important role to play in this process and 
government support should be given to their activi- 
ties. 
The “neighbourhood effect”. In the developing 
countries, there should be questioning of the process 
whereby academic research is dominated by themes 
that are prevalent in the West.M any of these themes, 
though important for advances in scientific know- 
ledge, have no immediate relevance to the real pro- 
blems of developing countries. Meanwhile, only resi-

dual attention is given by science laboratories and 
universities to problems confronted by people in their 
immediate neighbourhood, such as malnutrition, 
poverty, pollution, and industrial hazards. To enhance 
their “neighbourhood effect”, science laboratories 
and universities should allocate part of their research 
effort to solving these problems, when necessary in col- 
laboration with social scientists. Representatives from 
local neighbourhoods could well become involved in 
such participatory research in formal institutions. 
Democracy and the scientific spirit. There is a close 
link between the values of science and democracy. 
If societies are to benefit from democracy their 
members must develop the “scientific temper”, i.e. 
qualities such as scepticism and doubt,respect for 
facts and data, and the questioning of assumptions 
in their approach to public issues. u

A Hippocratic oath for scientists? 
hat’s the best way to make scientists think about unfo- 
W-... consequences of their discoveries? Under the 
auspices of Unesco, some 30 scientific, cultural and political 
figures from many countries, led by South African judge 
Richard Goldstone, have drafted a “declaration of human 
dutiesand responsibilities’ forthe Valencia Foundation forthe 
Third Millennium. Article 12 of the declaration includes the fol- 
lowing statements: 
“The research and scientific communities have a duty 
to act with full respect for the life and welfare of every 
human being and to take all necessary measures, including 
the adoption of a code of ethics, to prevent the results of 
scientific and technological research being used for the pur- 
pose of threatening peace and security, or in a manner 
which infringes upon human rights and fundamental free- 
domes. Individual researchers and scientists have a duty at 
all times to conduct their research in accordance with 
strict ethical practices and to inform the public of any une- 
thical or potentially dangerous research of which they 
become aware.” 
A French member of the group, the philosopher Michel 
Serres, has suggested adding an oath, like the Hippocratic 
oath doctors take, w hich would be sworn voluntarily by all 
3 6 The Unesco Courier - May 1999 
young students embarking on scientific research. Serres has 
proposed the following form of words: 
“| swear that,in whatever falls within my responsibi- 
lity, | will never use my knowledge, my inventions and the 
applications that | might find for them to promote des- 
truction or death, to increase poverty and ignorance, to 
enslave people or to promote inequality, but instead to dedi- 
cate them to achieving equality between people, to help 
them live, to enhance their lives and make them more 
free” 
The idea of the oath, says Serres, arose from the difficulty 
of drawing up a universal code of conduct amid so many dif- 
ferent cultures “A Japanese Shintoist and a Canadian Pro- 
testant just don’t look in the same way at life, death,human 
destiny and the human person,” he says Hence, according to 
Serres, the need to go back to the private individual and his 
or her responsibilities. 
The draft declaration of duties and responsibilities, 
intended to complement the 1948 Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights, has been submitted to UNEsco Director- 
General Federico Mayor. The proposed oath will be put 
before the international scientific community at a later 
date. []

Child workers in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. 
    
Sophie Boukhari* 
For the media, child labour is a guaran- 
teed tear-jerker. Journalists nearly always 
report on the most heart-rending situa- 
tions—children working down mines, child 
domestic servants being beaten and raped, 
kids preyed on by paedophiles. Western 
consumers are stepping up campaigns to 
boycott goods produced by child workers. 
More than 250 million of the world’s 
children work at jobs (see box). This figure, 
which UNICEF calls “monstrous”, has 
spurred most NGOs and Western govern- 
ments, along with the United Nations, to 
make a determined effort to eradicate child 
labour.

### 115877: Child labour: a lesser evil?

ld labour: 
a lesser evil? 
When there is no possibility of schooling, perhaps it’s better for children 
to work in dignity than hang out in the streets. Some children’s movements are contesting 
United Nations policy to abolish child labour 
“Kids in poor countries have the right to 
a childhood, just like you and me in 
Europe,” says Robert Saintgeorge, spo- 
kesman for the International Labour Orga- 
nisation (ILO)’s worldwide programme to 
abolish child labour, launched in 1992. 
“Turning children away from education is 
like abolishing the future,” says the head of 
the ILO in France, Jean-Daniel Leroy. 
But some of the young would-be bene- 
ficiaries in developing countries are objec- 
ting. Thousands of children and adoles- 
cents, mostly of them living in towns and 
cities, claim they have a right to work in 
proper conditions. They are called Nats, 
from the acronym of Nifios y Adolescentes 
Trabajadores (“Child and Teenage Wor- 
kers”), a movement that has sprung up in 
Latin America. It began in Peru (see article 
page 39) in the 1970s, spread to many other 
Latin American countries a decade later, 
and then to West Africa and India in the 
1990s. It is now making headway in Asia, 
notably T hailand. 
The Nats are also trying to build a 
worldwide structure to give them a voice in 
matters that concern them.T hey oppose a

In Delhi, India,working children join in a

for street and working children. 
» strongly against boycotts of goods they 
make for export, which are produced by 
only 5 per cent of all child workers, accor- 
ding to the UN. They want the UN to 
“make a distinction between exploitation of 
children and other forms of work which 
help their development.” 
In fact the ILO conventions are beco- 
ming more flexible. The first one, which 
dates from 1919, set the minimum age for 
factory work at 14. But the main interna- 
tional legal instrument is Convention 138, 
signed in 1973. This fixes the minimum 
age at 15 (or at the end of compulsory edu- 
cation) and makes many exceptions. 
Punishable crimes 
But most developing countries think 
this is too strict and only about 20 of 
them have ratified it. A more widely 
accepted version is currently being nego- 
tiated in the ILO and is due to be adop- 
ted in June 1999 in Geneva.This one will 
deal only with the most inhuman and 
dangerous categories of labour, like slave- 
ry, prostitution, drug trafficking and work 
harmful to health. 
For the Nats, these activities should 
not be regarded as work but as punishable 
crimes. Their existence, they say, should 
not be an excuse to throw the baby (a 
child’s right to work) out with the bath 
water (the inhuman tasks they are some- 
times forced to do).What’s more, accor- 
ding to Michel Bonnet, a former ILO offi- 
cial who has written a book called Le 
Travail des enfants:terrain des luttes (“Child 
Labour: A Battleground”)! only 10 per 
cent of Nats live in intolerable conditions,

mostly in Asia. 
At big conferences, complains Dibou 
Faye, a 14-year-old maid from Senegal, 
“adults speak for us. They say that if chil- 
dren work, they're no longer children. 
When I was seven,I would’ve preferred to 
go to school. But as my parents didn’t 
have the money to send me, I decided to 
work instead.” Since the maids in Dakar 
have organized themselves, and march in 
the annual May Day procession alongside 
trade unionists, their working conditions 
have slightly improved. 
“When one of them is beaten or wron- 
gly accused of something, she can count 
on the support of others and can lodge a 
complaint. Before, the police wouldn’t 
even listen,” says Hamidou Coly, of 
ENDA, an NGO that supports Nats in 
West Africa. END A provides the children 
with an education geared to their situa- 
tion (in the evenings and with the content 
worked out with the students), legal aid 
and help in negotiating cheaper medicine 
and hospital care. 
“In Africa,” says Coly, “the minimum 
legal age for starting work is usually 15. 
Education is compulsory and supposedly 
free up to the age of 12. But even if they 
go to school until then, what are kids 
going to do between 12 and 157” 
Nats are being helped by organizations like 
ENDA in Africa, MANTHOC in Peru and 
Concerned for Working Children in India. 
This does not rule out “the risk of being 
manipulated”, says Bonnet, who nonethe- 
less welcomes the emergence of the Nats. 
“They want to be respected, get a 
decent wage, have work breaks, and 
access to education and health care. What 
they don’t want is to wake up and find in 
their district some ill-thought-out project 
from a rich country which is going to lose 
them their job.” 
Duncan Green, a British worker with 
the Catholic Aid Agency, who spent seve- 
ral months last year with the Nats in Latin 
America, laments that “most [Western] 
adults think child workers in the Third 
World are the equivalents of the little boys 
used as forced labour in British factories in 
Victorian times.” Not so, he says. “Working 
gives them self-confidence, know-how and 
money to feed themselves.” 
UNICEF and the ILO have been for- 
ced to recognize this. “The lesson of 1994 
has been digested,” Leroy says. T hat year, 
the owners of textile mills in Bangladesh 
sacked 50,000 child workers after a bill 
was put before the U.S. Congress to ban 
the import of clothing made by child wor- 
kers. Some of the children thrown out of 
work were forced to go begging or beco- 
me prostitutes. 
Accepting that working in a factory is 
better than being on the street, UN agen- 
cies set up a programme enabling some of 
the children to be rehired and also have 
access to education and health care on the 
job. Brutal solutions should be avoided, 
says Saintgeorge, “but we can’t legalize 
child labour. If we do, we’ll have no way 
of controlling it in many countries.” 
Minimum standards 
The UN recognizes it is unrealistic 
and dangerous to want to abolish child 
labour. Developing countries, often for- 
ced to cut social spending, do not have 
the resources to provide education for all 
and social security coverage for poor chil- 
dren. But the UN continues to campaign 
for abolition. UNICEF “is strongly 
urging the World Trade Organisation to 
adopt a ‘social clause’,” which would 
require minimum standards from compa- 
nies, including a ban on child labour. 
This ambiguous position illustrates 
the complexity of the problem. “Whether 
they work or not,poor children are at risk. 
You just have to know which risks are the 
worst,” says Bonnet. [|

250 million child workers in the world 
T° International Labour Organisation (ILO) says 250 million children betw een the ages of five and 
1 4 are working— 61% of them in Asia,32% in Africa, 7% in Latin America and a small number in 
rich countries (two million in the European Union).One in three children in Africa works, one in four 
in Asia and one in five in Latin America. 
On top of that,15-20% of children in developing countries work for no pay, often as domestics or 
farmworkers. Two-thirds of child workerslive in the countryside: 20% of them are between 5 and 9 years 
old,compared with only 5% in this same age bracket in towns and cities. 
About 120 million children work full time. This means they can neither go to school or learn a trade 
and have little time to play.

### 115878: Peru's child workers stake their claims

Peru’s child workers stake 
their claims 
Luis-Jaime Cisneros* 
Young Peruvians set up a 
pioneering movement for 
working children and 
teenagers 
They're called “Nats”, the acronym of 
el Nifios y A dolescentes Trabajadores—Child 
and Teenage Workers. The term mainly 
refers to needy children in towns and cities, 
although there are more child workers in the 
countryside. Poverty, unemployment and 
family problems, including violence, have 
pushed them onto the streets. Often it isn’t 
possible—or even desirable—for them to 
return home to their parents. They fre- 
quently work in very harsh conditions and 
are exploited and mistreated. 
The International Labour Organisation 
reckons there are 17.5 million child workers 
in Latin America, but some NGOs say there 
are between 25 and 30 million, including 
1.5 to 2 million in Peru. The United Nations 
has criticized Peru for being the only 
country in Latin America to legally allow 
children to work from the age of 12, instead 
of 14 as elsewhere. 
The Nats in Lima, Peru’s capital, were 
the first children in the world to organize 
themselves in a social movement. In the 
early 1970s, members of the Christian Wor- 
kers Youth Movement opened centres for 
street children in the city’s poorest neigh- 
bourhoods. Most of the centres looked after 
children who earned a living doing odd 
jobs in open-air markets. 
A national charter 
But when Lima city council threatened 
in 1976 to sell the land on which the street 
children’s centres stood, there was an outcry. 
In the southern part of the city, the children, 
their parents, grandparents and others got 
together to defend the centres. They also 
demanded that the centres be connected to 
water, electricity and sewage services. T he 
children and teenagers called for access to 
school places and health care.

A child shells corncobs in the Urubamba valley in Peru's Cuzco department. 
The protests brought the children’s 
centres together into a loose network, and 
gradually the movement took shape. Its sup- 
porters developed the idea of “protago- 
nism” ,i.e.considering children as respon- 
sible people, defending their right to work, 
and believing in their ability to act for them- 
selves, organize and generally improve their 
own situation. 
The Movement of Working Children of 
Christian Workers (MANTHOC) was set 
up in Lima in 1978. “Our aim was to streng- 
then a movement established by and for 
children and geared to their specific needs,” 
says Nelly Torres, the founder of MAN- 
THOC. “We wanted them to share their 
experiences with the majority of street chil- 
dren, who weren’t organized.” The move- 
ment slowly spread to other towns, even 
though it still only involved a very small 
number of Nats. 
TodayTorres runs the National Move- 
ment of Peruvian Young Workers’ Organi- 
zations (MN NAT SOP), a federation set 
up in 1996 representing nearly 10,000 chil- 
dren between 7 and 14 living in 18 towns all 
over the country. It has drawn up a national 
charter for the rights of Nats. Its members 
point out that because the school dropout 
rate is very high, children are better off 
working rather than hanging about the 
streets all day long. A job can even help 
keep their families together by providing 
extra income. 
MNNAT SOP believes that the essential 
thing is for the Nats to earn respect, and 
encourages them to associate in produc- 
tion workshops to demand better working 
conditions. A credit system has been set 
up to enable the most vulnerable Nats to 
reduce their working hours so they can 
study or enjoy themselves. 
MNNATSOP considers it very impor- 
tant to develop good relations with the 
authorities. Last year, it scored a success by 
signing an agreement with the Lima city 
government, which promised to create 600 
jobs for Nats over the next two years. Nego- 
tiations to win social security rights are also 
going on, though so far without success. 
However,a number of ad hoc agreements 
have been signed with hospitals and clinics 
which have agreed to provide child wor- 
kers with free medical care. 
More progress seems to have been made 
on the educational front, thanks to efforts by 
NGOs and by the government. MAN- 
THOC opened the first school for Nats in 
1986 in a south Lima neighbourhood. It was 
geared to child workers’hours and interests. 
In 1996,the ministry of education started 
special programmes for Nats in 9 of the 
capital’s primary schools. 
MNN AT SOP also has a scheme to pro- 
tect young workers called Colibri, which is 
run by the national police force. “We try to 
protect street children from delinquents, 
but also from abuse by city officials who 
might, for example, seize the wares of unau- 
thorized child vendors,” says Col. Luis Her- 
mosa Ortega. 
“I ran away from home because my 
dad’s new wife beat me,” says Pablo Ortiz 
Vicuiia, a 12-year-old being looked after 
by Colibri officials. “Now I live at the house 
of a friend who washes cars like me. Some- 
times I go begging but only when I don’t 
have anything to eat.” u

Some call this forum a democratic 
pillar. Critics beg to differ 
oe ae Ve L 8 AL JE RW Sewn SR 
The 144 employees of the Timbuktu air- 
port wrote to complain about their work 
conditions. They were not receiving their 
salaries on time, back pay was due and paid 
vacations were going uncompensated. T hey 
didn’t have the funds necessary to travel along 
desert and mountain roads down to the capital, 
Bamako, in order to present their complaint in 
the flesh.Nonetheless,M ali’s minister of jus- 
tice,Diabaté Hamidou, duly read their letter. 
Cheick Coulibaly, a former sergeant in the 
Malian army, raised a grievance dating back 
to 1968, 8 years after the West African country 
gained independence from France. Mr. Cou- 
libaly wanted financial restitution for the five 
years he spent doing hard labour during the 
period when he was politically at loggerheads 
with the government. Dressed in a traditional 
long gown called a bubu, with a white hat,he 
read his letter directly to the government. 
Mr. Coulibaly and the airport employees 
were among the 40 individuals and groups to 
avail themselves in December 1998 of the 
annual EID, Espace d’Interpellation Démo- 
cratique (Democratic Question T ime), a five- 
year old institution that forms a bridge bet-

finding direct solutions to problems that state 
institutions haven’t resolved conclusively. 
During turbulent times, African chiefs 
would often gather tribe members to talk 
about problems, and thus hopefully prevent 
unrest. In practice though, these gatherings 
were often tense and could erupt into vio- 
lence. When President Alpha Oumar Konaré 
assumed power in 1992, he picked up the 
tradition of consulting with his subjects by 
holding open house on Fridays when people 
could come to set forth their problems to the 
government. It is thought that EID was the 
natural offspring of these meetings, which, in 
contrast with the tribal gatherings of yesteryear, 
were always peaceful and sometimes helped 
the new president shape his governmental 
policy. 
Today, once a year all Malian citizens are 
invited to present their complaints before 
prime minister Ibrahim Boubacar Keita and 
his entire cabinet. For ordinary Malians, it’s 
their one big chance to make sure their voices 
are heard. 
Because only one out of every five adult 
Malians can read, advertisements for the EID 
are not only run in newspapers but also on 
radio and TV. Ads are in all 13 of the country’s 
official languages and in 1998 269 people 
sent letters with their complaints. T he relati- 
vely low letter response may be due in part to 
the fact that a trip to Bamako is too expensive 
for any but the richest Malian to contem- 
plate. Another factor hindering participation 
appears to be that many very poor, illiterate 
Malians have no access to letter-writers. 
Moreover, despite new roads, more electricity 
and other positive signs since the change in 
government early this decade, many poorer 
parts of the country have hardly been touched 
by Konaré’s administration and thus may be 
sceptical as to whether any contact at all with 
the government might be of use. 
A 15-hour session 
The complaints at the most recent EID ran 
a gamut of problems, from birth control to 
rights for the elderly. A young man had 
endured deplorable prison conditions; a father 
of four couldn’t afford the U.S.$15 per child 
required for school enrollment; a medical stu- 
dent, while on a scholarship in Prague, was for- 
gotten by his country and left to fight for his 
life with skinheads; victims of traffic accidents 
wondered if the roads would ever be safe; a 
man was fired due to a sexual harassment 
charge filed by a visiting American; handi- 
capped persons hoped that builders would 
one day take their needs into account; first 
wives spoke about rights granted to others 
(up to four wives are allowed in this mainly 
Muslim country). Almost every sector of

Although complaints are limited to five 
minutes each, every year EID goes on long into 
the night and is broadcast live on ORTM, 
the country’s only television station. The 1998 
EID lasted 15 hours. Ringing mobile phones, 
outbursts of cheers and jeers and intermissions 
with songs and skits help keep spectators 
awake. Most interventions are voiced in 
French, but because the option to speak in any 
ofthe 13 languages is offered, some of the most 
emotional pleas are voiced in the country’s 
most widespread language, Bambara.

most male ministers stuck to European-style 
uniforms of grey suits and ties. The two female 
ministers (in the domains of communication 
and the family) turned up in traditional 
colourful dresses. One by one the ministers 
responded to the complaints addressed to 
their sector of government. T he government 
promised former Sergeant Coulibaly that it 
would look into the request for compensation 
for his period of forced labour. 
Each minister had received a copy of the 
letters addressing their sector well before the 
EID began, and their responses frequently 
sounded perfunctory. Often laws were invoked 
and details cited that only a legal expert could 
follow. But responses were officially recorded 
and it is possible to review them in the year fol- 
lowing the EID. 
After reviewing the promises made by 
the ministers at the 1997 EID and at the pro- 
gress made in handling them six months 
later, last year’s honorary jury felt satisfied that 
officials were paying more than lip service to 
EID. The 1997 jury had made 12 recom- 
mendations, including changes to inheritance

laws to benefit women. EID seems to have had 
at least an indirect impact on effecting change 
in several instances. For example, the govern- 
ment has committed itself to legal and other 
steps aimed at doing away with excision, on 
the heels of complaints at previous EIDs 
about female genital mutilation. At a more 
personal level, many individuals who com- 
plained about lack of electricity have had 
their demands met. At an even more basic 
level, a man who complained earlier that his 
radio had been stolen had the object returned 
to him.

Leaders of Mali’s opposition parties refuse 
to attend the EID which they joke stands for 
“Espace d’Intoxication Démagogique” 
(Forum for Demagogic Intoxication).Oppo- 
sition parties, ranging from prominent 
Marxist-Leninist cells to ultra-conservative 
groups, claim that only answerable com- 
plaints are invited to Bamako and that most 
ministerial promises are not kept. T his often 
happens because of lack of money—M ali is

International League for Human Rights were 
among those who sat together with Malian 
representatives of Muslim, Protestant, 
Catholic and women’s groups on the hono- 
rary jury. The jury’s duty is to listen to all 
complaints and responses, and then retire to 
make recommendations. In1998, 10 recom- 
mendations were made including a request 
that the education and health budgets be 
increased, that application of the laws against 
excision be speeded up and that more effort 
be put into improving the penitentiary system. 
Many individual promises go ignored, 
often due to the lack of money in this,one 
of the poorest countries in the world. As one 
minister put it:“*We are a very poor but a 
very proud country. We ask that our citizens 
have patience with us—that they put the

Long discussions are sometimes needed before a 
consensus is reached.Here, a village meeting in 
Senegal. 
In the early 17th century, a Portuguese 
Catholic missionary, Father Mariano, 
made strenuous efforts to convert the 
people of the small kingdom of Sahadia, on 
the west coast of Madagascar, north of 
modern-day Morondava. Despite lengthy 
expeditions to the area, however, he did 
not succeed. 
One of the main reasons for his failure, 
he noted in a letter, was the kingdoms poli- 
tical system.“If the king at least had some 
authority,” he wrote, “we could have hoped 
for some success. But the king only controls 
the area around his home town,he is poor 
and not feared,and his subjects do as they 
please without his daring to complain. In 
fact, the people form a kind of republic. 
Whenever a big local issue comes up, eve- 
ryone gathers to discuss it in a council.” 
Father Mariano was talking about the 
Jfokonolona, an ancient tradition which has to 
some extent survived in Madagascar to this 
day (see the UNEsco Courier, March 1999). 
But it is also found elsewhere in Africa, 
where it is known as the palaver. 
A key socio-political institution of pre- 
colonial Africa, the palaver is an assembly 
where a variety of issues are freely debated 
and important decisions concerning the 
community are taken. Its purpose is to 
resolve latent and overt conflicts in certain 
highly specific situations. The participants 
usually gather under a “palaver tree” where 
everyone has the right to speak and air their 
grievances or those of their group. A 
complainant may opt to be represented by

### 115880: In the shade of the palaver tree

In the shade Jasmina Sopova* 
of the palaver tree 
The palaver is a traditional African institution 
of debate and consensus whose democratic potential 
has been overshadowed by modern political systems 
a griot (a poet, storyteller and traditional 
singer), or some other spokesman. 
The status of women in these assem- 
blies, where the elders try to reach a 
consensus, varies from region to region. 
Among some peoples, women actively take 
part in the decision-making. Among others, 
they settle for advising their menfolk outside 
the assemblies. 
One form of the palaver is the 
Ethiopian debo, a mutual aid system 
where the men of the community get 
together to help a neighbour (the aba 
debo, “father of the debo”) carry out a 
major task. The group chooses a leader, 
who in turn designates a walle to do the 
talking. He has to be eloquent and have a 
good voice because his job is to lead the 
singing while the work is being done and 
provide words of encouragement in parti- 
cularly arduous moments. He also 
defends the interests of the workers befo- 
re the aba debo and reports back to them. 
Wider participation 
by women 
Palavers operate in various ways,e.g.to 
deliberate about a marriage or a sale, settle 
a dispute, look at the circumstances of a 
crime and then decide how to find and 
punish the culprit. But the underlying prin- 
ciple does not change. This is one of the 
democratic institutions of traditional African 
societies which many African intellectuals 
feel could be used in the transition to a 
modern political system, as long as it opens 
itself up more to women. 
In his autobiography, Long Walk fo 
Freedom, South African President Nelson 
Mandela stresses the part these assemblies 
played in his political career. “My later 
notions of leadership,” he writes, “were 
profoundly influenced by observing the 
regent and his court. I watched and learned 
from the tribal meetings that were regularly 
held at the Great Place... . Everyone who 
wanted to speak did so. It was democracy in 
its purest form. There may have been a hie- 
rarchy of importance among the speakers, 
but everyone was heard. . .. As a leader, I 
have always followed the principles I first 
saw demonstrated by the regent at the Great 
Place.” 
However, such institutions are usually 
dismissed by African politicians as old- 
fashioned. African leaders “tend to distrust 
the palaver and prefer a superficial legal 
structure imported directly from the West,” 
says Cameroonian philosopher Jean-Gode- 
froy Bidima. 
Since political independence in the 
1960s, young African elites trained in 
“white” Western ways have encouraged the 
adoption of Western models, including legal 
codes which are largely unsuited to African 
conditions. Even today, rural Africans find 
it very hard to accept that a “custom” from 
outside can override sacred customs inhe- 
rited from their ancestors. 
“This is why bush people don’t bring 
their grievances to the courts (which only 
exist in the capital) and prefer to settle their 
differences using traditional structures,” 
says Ethiopian scholar Béseat Kiflé 
Sélassiél. “So-called modern institutions 
in Africa are like make-up on an old lady’s 
face: it only beautifies the surface.It’s like 
trying to modernize a building by cleaning 
up the facade and doing nothing to renovate 
the inside.” 
And so in Africa where, as the Malian 
scholar Hampaté Ba once said, “different 
worlds, different mentalities and different 
eras are superimposed on each other,” the 
palaver is “a kind of parallel authority.” 
Mali is the only African country where it has 
been integrated into the modern political 
system. nu

### 115881: Soaps with a Latin scent

Latin scent 
Charged with suspense and fantasy, Latin American soap operas are pouring 
off the production lines into living rooms all over the world 
During Ramadan last January, some 
of the mosques in Abidjan decided to 
bring forward prayer time. This 
thoughtful gesture saved thousands of the 
faithful from a painful dilemma—whether 
to do their religious duty or miss the latest 
episode of Marimar, a Mexican TV melo- 
drama which has turned the whole country 
into addicts of telenovelas, soap operas made 
in Latin America. 
“At 7.30 sharp in the evening, when 
M arimar comes on, everything stops in 
Cote d’Ivoire,” the evening newspaper 
Ivoir’Soir noted a few months ago. The 
* Unesco Courier journalists 
programme, which has attracted more local 
fans than the 1998 World Cup, arrived in 
Africa after being a similar hit in Indonesia 
and the Philippines. In 1997, its female star 
was received in Manila like a foreign head 
of state. 
Meanwhile, on the other side of the 
planet, hundreds of thousands of Yugoslavs 
hold their breath so as not to miss the tiniest 
detail of the Venezuelan soap opera Kas- 
sandra. “We know Kassandra’s innocent 
and we want her trial stopped,” the towns- 
people of Kucevo, in southeastern Serbia, 
wrote to the Venezuelan government, with 
a copy to Serbian President Slobodan Milo- 
sevic. T his is just one of many examples of 
how fiction can invade real life and how 
far people come to identify with it. 
Marimar and Kassandra are classics 
among the thousands of soap operas Latin 
America has turned out over the past 40 
years at the rate of about 100 a year. They 
are love stories which have plenty of sub- 
plots and move along at a brisk pace. Their 
characters overcome countless obstacles— 
social class, family ties, conflicts of interest 
and so on—to finally win through despite all 
the ambushes of fate. In all of them, mora- 
lity and goodness triumph and the bad guys 
get punished in a happy ending where eve- 
ryone is reconciled. In this respect they are 
very different from Anglo-Saxon soap

» operas,in which conflicts get solved in the 
course of a few virtually self-contained epi- 
sodes, which means they can be broadcast 
in any order. 
The plot of a Latin American telenovela 
includes a strong dose of suspense. Each 
episode has a dramatic ending to make sure 
viewers watch the next one. This tactic pro- 
duced a new way of making some pocket 
money when Kassandra was shown in the 
Balkans. People in Bulgaria, where the soap 
was running 10 episodes ahead of Yugo- 
slavTV, would tell their neighbours across 
the border what was coming up next—in 
exchange for 10 dinars ($2). 
The worldwide success of these soaps 
suggests they might be something more 
than just a carefully-engineered collection 
of dirty deeds and superficial emotions. 
Their hackneyed themes don’t often 
amount to anything of great artistic value, 
but the scripts aren’t always puerile and 
the dialogue and characters are less pre- 
dictable than one might expect. Telenovelas 
CONNEXIONS 
have accumulated 40 years of experience 
and professionalism and turned into an 
industry which can buy the best actors, 
scriptwriters and directors in Latin America. 
Urban violence and political 
corruption 
Since the 1970s, producers have also 
tried to go beyond classic melodrama and 
have adapted the works of writers like Mario 
Benedetti, Mario Vargas Llosa and Jorge 
Amado. In recent years,authors,directors 
and scriptwriters in the Latin American 
film industry have brought new life to the 
genre by broadening its range of subjects 
and bringing it closer to real life. These 
“new-wave” telenovelas dig straight into 
issues like police corruption, influence- 
peddling, urban violence, impunity and the 
role of mafia money, as in last year’s Colom- 
bian production La Mujer del presidente 
(“The President’s Wife”) and, the year 
before, N ada personal (“Nothing Personal”), 
which was made in Mexico. 
A world market 
1} Ithough selling telenovelas on the inter- 
A... market is a major cultural 
industry, its economics are less important than its 
cultural impact,” says researcher Daniel Mato, 
of Venezuela's Central University. “ They're pri- 
marily produced for the home market, where it is 
hoped returns will recoup production costs.” 
Mato found that advertising during soaps was the 
main source of income for TV stations, while ear- 
nings from foreign sales were only a tiny per- 
centage of the income from advertising in the 
home market (8 per cent in the case of Radio 
Caracas Television and Venevision, in Venezuela, 
5 per cent for Televisa de México and 2.5 per 
cent for Brazil's TV Globo). 
Income from foreign sales per episode is much 
less than the cost of production, which runs at 
between $15,000 and $100,000, and only comes 
in after the soap has become a success at home and 
sometimes only many years later. Also, the sale 
price varies from country to country, according to 
the number of TV sets per head, people’s purcha- 
sing power and especially the amount spent on 
advertising. Last year, says Mato, the price of soap 
operas sold abroad ranged from $7,000 to $9,000 
per hour of air time in Spain, $2,550 to $5,000 for 
Hispanic stations in the U.S and between $1,200 
and $1,500 in Hong Kong. This compares with the 
U.S soap Dynasty, w hich sells for $20,000 an epi- 
sode to British stations $1,500 to Norwegian ones 
4 4 The Unesco Courier - May 1999 
and for only $50 to Zambian and Syrian televi- 
sion. 
Mato admits that despite being economi- 
cally just icing on the cake, “ the soaps that Tele- 
visa de México sold abroad in 1997, for example, 
earned about $100 million,” only a little lessthan 
the BBC earned from selling its own programmes, 
and a respectable figure next to the $500 million 
earned from such sales by each of the transna- 
tional TV giants Warner Brothers, Paramount and 
Universal. 
The advance of globalization has boosted 
worldwide distribution of soaps and opened up 
new markets in Asia and the Middle East. TV 
Globo says the economic crisis in Asia has gene- 
rally increased demand there because imported 
goods are cheaper than home-made productions. 
But the field is increasingly competitive. Coun- 
tries which until now were just importers, like 
Spain, Greece, Turkey and the Philippines, are 
starting to turn out their own soaps and challen- 
ging Latin America’s hold on the market. To hang 
on to their position, the Latin American firms are 
looking for new partners. Currently in the works, 
for example, is a co-production by China and 
Brazil about a young Chinese man who falls in 
love with a Brazilian girl and goes to Brazil to woo 
her.And so begins another episode in the history 
of the soap opera. u 
 
Soaps like this have sparked off social 
developments which in the past would have 
been unthinkable. Venezuela's Por estas calles 
(“Through These Streets”), screened in 
1992, was about the decline of a corrupt and 
powerful ruler, who reminded many vie- 
wers of President Carlos Andrés Pérez, the 
country’s president at the time. Andrés 
Pérez was caught up in a corruption scandal 
which drove him from office two years later 
“because of this soap among other rea- 
sons,” says its producer,Alberto Giarroco. 
In Brazil, O Salvador da Patria (“Saviour of 
the Fatherland”; 1989) was accused, on 
the other hand, of favouring the presiden- 
tial campaign of Inacio Lula Da Silva,since 
it closely mirrored his life story as a half-lite- 
rate peasant who rose to be a powerful trade 
union leader and presidential candidate. 
“Lula”, however, was not elected. 
A multi-million-dollar 
industry 
This new trend, which is very popular 
with Latin American audiences,shows the 
vitality of the soap tradition, which can 
affect politicians and adapt to current 
events. The telenovela, says Colombian 
scriptwriter Fernando Gaitén, has become 
“the continent’s main channel of commu- 
nication,drawing larger audiences than the 
cinema, novels or the theatre.” But as well 
as being a firmly-established regional craze 
which has now spread all over the world, it 
is also a multi-million-dollar industry. The 
biggest production companies—in Brazil, 
Mexico and Venezuela—present their work

Prime time

Brazil's TV Globo is perhaps the most 
typical of these firms and has sold teleno- 
velas to 123 countries, according to its 
international sales director, Orlando 
Marques. The TV Globo telenovelas are 
screened from six in the evening on and 
their 160 or so episodes cost between 
$50,000 and $60,000 each to make. The 
local viewing audience is around 80 mil- 
lion people. A 30-second prime-time

four recording studios and a script-wri- 
ting staff of about 1,500.While the soap is 
showing, polls and discussion groups are 
held in several cities to gather viewers’ 
opinions and suggestions. Telenovelas were

billings for 1996, 60 per cent of Brazilian 
TV’s ad billings. “Without felenovelas, TV 
Globo might not exist,” says Jorge Adib,

specialized technicians, while also encou -

Now they are as much a symbol of Latin 
America as salsa and football. Some are tre- 
mendous hits, like the Brazilian soap Esclava 
Isaura in countries as different as China 
(where it was shown for the first time in 
1980 in Mandarin, and again in 1983), 
Poland and Cuba. Others, like Venezuela's

tence. The Manila Daily Inquirer newspaper 
says Marimar offers relief to Filipinos 
“trying to escape from the ugliness of their 
surroundings, the ugliness of their poverty, 
the ugliness of their public officials.” 
A real sense 
of complicity 
All telenovelas are built around topics 
which “have existed since the beginning of 
human society,” says Arquimides Rivero, 
one of the founders of the genre in Venezuela. 
These universal situations and the feeling 
of identification with a story inspired by real 
life without being a carbon copy of it explains 
the popularity of soap operas with such an 
eclectic range of audiences. Viewers live 
through the sufferings and misfortunes of the 
characters and develop areal sense of com- 
plicity with them. 
“What I like about Marimar,” says 
Ligaya Magbanua, who works in a Manila 
restaurant, “is that she has the same pro- 
blems as we do. She’s poor like us. Her 
house was burned down. They mistreated 
her. They degraded her. She’s almost Fili- 
pina.” 
‘What | like about Marimar is that she has

She’s almost Filipina.’ 
The current success of Brazil's Rei do 
Gado (“The Cattle King”), set in the 19th 
century during the war between landow- 
ners and landless peasants, and 
Colombia’s Café con Aroma de Mujer 
(“Coffee with the Scent of a Woman”) 
which tells a love story amid the ups and 
downs of big players in the coffee indus- 
try, seems to confirm this. Some, like 
Henri N’Koumo, a journalist on the 
Abidjan newspaper Fraternité Matin, say 
TV soaps are popular “because they 
touch very deep chords. Despite cultural 
differences, people feel very comfortable 
with these tales. They prefer them to the 
French ones which they find too intellec- 
tual.” 
Filipino columnist Conrado de Quiros 
agrees. “Filipino soaps are too familiar. 
American soaps are too alien. Latin Ame- 
rican ones are neither,” he says.T hey do not 
fall into the over-sophistication of Ame- 
rican super-luxury or the intellectualism 
of European productions, but still allow 
Perhaps the main reason for this success 
is to be found in the rationale and ethics of 
melodrama. Researcher Nora Mazziotti 
says viewers follow for months the mishaps, 
injustices, dangers and threats which the 
characters endure before savouring with them 
the ultimate triumph of love and justice— 
observing that in the make-believe world, 
and maybe nowhere else, there’s justice. 
That’s something to be happy about. nu

Mark Thomas: 
method and 
madness of 
a TV comic 
British TV comedian Mark Thomas uses pranks and stunts to expose 
questionable government and business practices. Thomas says this is democracy in action, but 
his victims don’t always agree 
Like many or your generation, 
you trace your political awakening 
back to the UK miners’ strike of 
1984-85. But surely it stems back to your 
childhood, growing up in a working class 
family but attending an elite school on 
a scholarship. You were part of the 
“deserving poor”, deemed worthy of 
a first-class education. 
This kind of experience gives you a very 
rapid education about class. . . . All your 
mates at home think you're posh and all the 
people at school think you’re common. So 
you find yourself caught in the middle. I 
think you'll find that many comedians, in par- 
ticular,have this sense of being an outsider. 
Two heroes of mine were both outsiders: 
Oscar Wilde,an Irishman who lived in the 
cream of English high society, and Dave 
Allen, a brilliant comedian in a similar posi- 
tion. Allen did this wonderful routine which 
I think sums it up. 
He’s on stage in London and says, “Well, 
I tell Irish jokes. And I get in trouble for tel- 
ling ’em. But I think ‘sod it! If you cannot 
laugh at yourself, what’s the point? A round 
of applause from the studio audience. 
So he starts telling Irish jokes. “Two pad-

dies leave Dublin to go to work in London. 
The collective IQ of Dublin halves over- 
night.” A big round of applause. “You've got 
to be able to laugh at yourself, haven’t you?’ 
he says. Another big round of applause. 
Allen goes on. “When the two get to 
London, the IQ there doubles overnight.” 
Smaller round of applause. “I thought we 
agreed that you’re supposed to be able to 
laugh at yourself.” 
This catches the audience completely 
unaware of their own bigotry. That’s the 
eye of the outsider. 
Your brand of stand-up comedy seems to 
mean getting up on a soap box to 
denounce wrong-doing. Why? 
My tour manager always used to say, 
“It’s in the genes, mate.” You see my dad was 
a lay preacher and my great grandfather 
was a Baptist preacher which I think is 
funny. I'll start to worry about it if my son 
decides to be a stand-up. 
Seriously, do you have to focus on political 
issues in your work? 
Every single thing that anyone says on 
stage belies their world view. It’s a political 
decision to believe that people just want a 
good night out without having to think. 
The person on stage who tells jokes por- 
traying women in a certain way has made a 
political decision to reinforce stereotypes 
instead of challenging people to think other- 
wise. That performer is saying, “I want the 
easiest ride possible. I want mass adula- 
tion on the back of you (the audience) not 
having to think.” The difference is that I 
want mass adulation on the back of people 
having to think. 
How do you design a TV comedy show to 
make people think? 
We look at the series as our own “state 
of the nation”broadcast.It’s our interpre- 
tation of where Britain is and where we are 
in relationship to the world. 
We try to get in a position where we 
can ask questions that will illuminate the 
nature of power in that situation. With Sel- 
lafield nuclear processing plant, the first 
thing we did was to prove contamination 
(see box) by having samples of earth from 
around the site analysed. We could then 
ask, “Is there a problem with the trains 
running through that area to transport the

plant’s nuclear waste? Or is there a wider 
problem ?Is the site irradiated 7’ The autho- 
rities won’t answer. This is a brilliant 
situation in which we really get underneath 
the mask of public relations. The officials’ 
silence actually says that they're frightened 
of the answer. 
In the last three years you've evolved from 
merry prankster to political satirist and 
now you're an information junky. What 
happened? 
In the beginning, the show was about us 
taking risks—turning up at a cabinet minis- 
ter’s home at a quarter to seven in the mor- 
ning in a tank asking if he could help us 
export it to Iraq. Or turning up in York- 
shire during a drought with a tanker filled 
with water as a “gift from the people of 
Ethiopia” after Britain privatized the water 
works. We were drawing out the stupidity of 
the situation. 
But the next year, we wanted to refine 
the show. There were bits which [ was very 
proud of but it wasn’t mature or rigorous 
enough. There wasn’t enough information. 
So in the second year, we really wanted to 
be factually accurate.N ow in this last year, 
we wanted to go a step further and do sto- 
ries that people haven’t heard about

elsewhere. So we’ve ended up being acci- 
dental journalists. We didn’t intend for this 
to happen. But now that it has, we quite like 
it. Do bad for good—that’s basically the 
ethos of the show. 
Nine times out of ten,I think the most 
important thing is to actually ask the ques- 
tion and get it into the public domain. 
Noam Chomsky, American linguist and 
activist,described it very succinctly when he 
said that the media reflect the dominant 
interests in the political climate. . . . Who 
owns the media? What are their interests? 
What are the interests of the ruling elite 
that they're working with? How are they 
setting the political agenda? Look at any 
television programme that deals with sup- 
posedly serious political news and you’ll 
find interviews with government spokesmen 
or women on an initiative or piece of legis- 
lation that they've created. Maybe they'll 
address an issue the government is being 
attacked about. But nearly all the inter views 
will be done with politicians, in studios with 
reporters who have to come back to those 
same officials the next week for more news. 
If they decide to actually question the 
relationships of power instead of focusing 
just on the intricacies of elite policy, then 
they're quite often going to run into trouble. 
But in staging the event, aren’t you 
sacrificing objective and balanced 
reporting? 
If you take the ideas of objectivity, 
balance and impartiality to their logical »

© producer once said when describing Mark 
Thomas’ television show, a mix of filmed 
{stunts and improvisation before a studio 
i audience. Recent highlights include: 
i O Menwith Hill Military Base 
: This sprawling complex of what looks like 
giant golf-balls has been reported by British 
broadsheet newspapers as the world’s largest 
© electronic monitoring station.It is owned by 
the British defence ministry but reportedly 
{operated by the U.S. National Security Agency. 
: Since 1996,members of parliament and 
concerned citizens have raised questions about 
activities at the base. Officials, citing security 
© reasons, have been tight-lipped.Access to the 
base is limited to officials with the highest 
security clearance. But Thomas discovers that 
i the air over the base is not restricted.So he 
takes a tour in a hot-air balloon and later 
invites 500 or so fans for guided visits 
: scheduled to lift off this July 4th. 
Q British Nuclear Fuels Limited (BNFL) 
: Local residents call Thomas when they find 
{ trains used to transport radioactive waste from 
the nearby Sellafield nuclear processing plant 
: (owned by BNF) parked too close to home for 
© comfort. Thomas decides to investigate. 
: As a conductor leaves the train to open a 
gate at a level crossing, Thomas and 40 
camouflaged friends pull up in armoured cars 
© and a helicopter as “ the People's Nuclear Train 
Militia” pledging to protect the train from 
terrorist attack. 
: Next the team don white suites to collect 
samples of earth along the tracks surrounding 
Sellafield which are analysed by a scientist at 
© the University of Manchester who finds traces 
of radioactive materials. BNFL officials refuse 
© to meet with Thomas, who they maintain has 
“trivialized” a serious subject. Thomas 
launches a “telephonathon” with journalists 
and members of parliament barraging BNFL 
with questions, essentially asking if the alleged 
contamination is due to leaky containers in the 
trains or wider problems with the nuclear 
: plant.In a letter, BNAL maintains that all 
© operations are carried out in strict accordance 
with UK and international standards. 
QO Defendory International 
: Thomas and team set up a stand at this major 
arms fair held in Greece under the guise of a 
public relations firm with the theme: “Are you 
ready when Amnesty International comes 
knocking on your door?” As various high- 
ranking officials visit the stand, Thomas

spy base at Menwith Hill (see box), there 
was absolutely no public accountability— 
hardly anyone knows that it’s there. We 
want the authorities to reply. It’s not a ques- 
tion of the programme having balance but 
the programme having balance in relation 
to all the other stuff going around—the PR 
campaigns,advertising, government links to 
business, media collusion and so on. 
Besides, when you're doing a show on 
human rights abuse, for example, I really 
don’t see how you can give a torturer the 
right to reply. 
But maybe the lack of information 
isn’t so much linked to a conspiracy but 
simply a consequence of commercializing 
news and treating information like 
a commodity? 
News, especially on television, is a com- 
modity packaged into the agenda of those 
people (business and political elites) and 
their interests. But it shouldn’t be. Infor- 
mation or “news” is really about things that 
touch your life, that shape what you do and 
have in the world. You have the right to 
improve yourself through access to infor- 
mation—this isn’t an affordable right avai- 
lable to some people but not others. This is 
about people’s natural yearning to aspire to 
a better life and to educate themselves. Ask

that if you take it to the final degree, you'll 
have committees on how to run your street. 
I do not have a problem with that. 
In your shows, there is always a very clearly 
defined “bad guy” or “evil empire.” When 
will you turn the spotlight on the 
audiences’ own contradictions? The British 
government is now recognizing that there 
is institutionalized racism in the police 
force, for example. Yet people continue to 
insist,“We’re not racist.This isn’t our 
problem.” 
You're very right to say that. It is without 
a doubt that a majority of people in Britain, 
at some level, are racist. But as a white 
man, do I then say, “Right, I'm going to 
challenge my own preconceptions on stage.” 
I don’t see it as my role as a comedian 
to dredge my psyche to bring these things 
to the fore. Also if you have a culture of 
racism, the lead has to be taken primarily 
from the top to stop it. The relationship 
between racism and power is immensely 
important. So instead of doing a show 
asking, “is my next door neighbour racist?’, 
it would be more important to focus on 
those people who pretend to be accoun- 
table, but aren’t fully accountable. 
What do you think of the criticism that the 
show attacks the status quo but fails to 
offer an alternative? 
At the end of about half the shows, we 
offer a way of joining in the protest. When 
we did the show on the referendum to save 
‘Democracy is not this rigmarole in which a politician puts on 
a public relations vision on how much you need this person 
to be elected. It is not about giving someone that you don’t 
know a mandate to do what they want. Democracy is about 
being involved in your community and having the information to 
decide “this is what we want and this is how we want to get it” 
up and they say “Astronaut!”No one says, 
“I want to work in a toilet.” 
To treat this information as a commodity 
1s to turn democracy into a joke. If demo- 
cracy is only about putting a cross on a 
ballot paper once every five years, then it’s 
a joke. Democracy is not this rigmarole in 
which a politician puts on a public relations 
vision on how much you need this person to 
be elected. It is not about giving someone 
that you don’t know a mandate to do what 
they want. Democracy is about being 
involved in your community and having the 
information to decide “this is what we want 
and this is how we want to get it.” 
Some people criticize this view and say

we ended with an offer to help people in 
other communities by giving them the

calls. This isn’t just about challenging 
authority because we have the budget to do 
so—which, by the way, is very small in 
terms of television. It’s about giving people 
information.That’s the starting point for 
change. As far as I'm concerned, it’s a

» major achievement to get people to unders- 
tand something like the export credit gua- 
rantee scheme® in which the government 
writes off the debt of various regimes to keep 
the profitability up of British companies dea- 
ling in arms. People care about issues like 
arms deals, nuclear pollution or American lis- 
tening bases. They want change. 
We're also saying, never get nicked, 
never get arrested. So when we produce a 
show, everything is done legally. If I get 
arrested, I'm aT V martyr. I’ve got Channel 
4 (see box) lawyers backing me up to the 
hilt. But if someone is arrested, they're in 
trouble. T hat’s not what this show is about. 
We are not saying that to get involved you 
have to be “special”. For example, we're 
going to have between 500 and 1,000 
people coming on July 4th for a balloon 
tour of the Menwith Hill base. And it’s all 
legal. The idea is to get people to join in and 
take this protest as far as we can. 
Doesn't this work bring a new set of 
responsibilities? 
Aaahah! Maybe. A lot of people write in 
asking, “can you help?’ You think, “Hell! My 
heart bleeds but there’s nothing I can do.” 
Someone wrote in asking for help to get 
traffic lights installed in the neighbourhood. 
It’s an absurd world when people have to 
write to a comic for help. But I think the res- 
ponsibilities are to the team and to myself 
to keep our integrity.

TALKING TO... 
Do you find yourself becoming self- 
righteous? 
I’m very aware that I now get paid really 
well. I'm a performer, so I've got an ego the 
size of London. But the programme is not 
just about my gratification.It’s about doing 
something of worth. To avoid getting too 
self-righteous, we kind of undermine the 
programme’s worth by laughing. We're not 
hard-nosed journalists. But somewhere in 
our work, there is truth or part of the truth 
or a truth.And that’s important to us. But 
at the end of the day, we're TV monkeys get- 
ting paid. 
I don’t think we take ourselves too 
seriously but we do get obsessed by the 
work. When we did the show about Colonel 
Halim Nawi [an Indonesian military attaché 
who came to London to consult Thomas 
who was posing as a PR specialist, see box], 
I was absolutely obsessed with all the details 
in the sting. After the interview, my wife 
asked “What did he admit to?’ It was incre- 
dible, I said—he admitted to using UK mili- 
tary equipment, to torture, to the death of 
ten students and so on. My wife just sat 
there and said, “Those poor families.” At that 
moment, I realized that in all the details I'd 
lost sight of what was really at stake. 
How do you get people to care about 
issues that may not touch them directly? 
Human rights groups invest in major 
campaigns with giant posters of maimed 
and starving children. But rather than 
engage people, this often makes them turn 
away. 
It has to relate to people’s lives. For 
example, we went to the arms fair in Greece 
disguised as a public relations firm (see 
box) not to just bring back general facts 
about the numbers of weapons sold. We 
went to bring home information saying, 
“these guys are torturers and they're using 
UK equipment.” We are licensing arms 
abroad which are used for murder, rape, 
genocide and torture and you, the tax- 
payer, have paid for it. You have a choice 
here. 
A lot of the human rights groups don’t 
take this approach of making people res- 
ponsible. Unless you engage people at their 
level without being patronizing, you'll never 
be very effective. Instead you'll have a lot of 
hand-wringing. And there’s enough of that 
already. 
You're like a plague politicians try to 
avoid. But if the show’s success continues, 
a politician with a bit of public relations 
savvy could start to ask: “why hasn’t 
Mark Thomas come and interviewed me 
yet?” 
When that time comes, my wife has firm ins- 
tructions on how to use the handgun.
