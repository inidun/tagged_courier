Ceramic art from Samarkand 
A woman's features are traced in a few simple lines on this fragment of a glazed 
ceramic dish, a product of the culture which flourished in Central Asia under the 
Samanid dynasty in the late ninth and tenth centuries. Unearthed at Afrasiyab near 
Samarkand, the piece is one of many discovered since the beginning of the century 
which reveal the brilliant development of decorated earthenware art in this region 
during the age of Avicenna.

### IGNORE

The year 370 of the Hegira, exactly one thousand years 
ago according to the Christian calendar, marks the birth of 
Ibn Sina, one of the most famous and most influential of 
the philosopher-scientists of Islam. 
Ibn Sina, or Avicenna as he is better known in the 
Western world, was born near Bukhara, in Central Asia, in 
a region which then formed part of the Abbasid caliphate. 
But this immense community, stretching from present-day 
Afghanistan in the east to southern Spain in the west 
under the banner of Islam, was disintegrating politically. 
Independent local dynasties were arising which admitted 
only nominal allegiance to the Caliph in Baghdad. 
Far from heralding a parallel cultural decline, however, 
this break up was to usher in a golden age of 
Islamic civilization. Each of the emergent new States 
made their own scientific and cultural contributions and 
their rulers vied with each other to attract to their courts 
the greatest minds of the period. Spreading to the West, 
the rich outpourings of this resurgence were to act as a 
leaven of the later European Renaissance. 
Avicenna was a key figure in this cultural ferment. 
Permeating the whole of Islam, his influence penetrated 
Europe through Muslim Spain where it remained a force 
for centuries. Standing at a crossroad of history, where 
different civilizations and epochs met, Avicenna was a 
figure whose genius is the inheritance of all mankind. This 
issue of the Unesco Courier is devoted to an examination 
of the many facets of this remarkable man.

### 42997: Avicenna: Ibn Sina, a universal genius

Avicenna - Ibn Sina 
universal genius A 
14 L-SHAYK al-Ra’is” {prince 
A among scholars) —such was 
the title bestowed "in the 
Orient on Abu Ali al-Husayn bn Abd-Allah 
Ibn Hassan Ibn Ali Ibn Sina, traditionally 
known in the West as Avicenna. 
He is one of the most extraordinary 
figures in world history. A philosopher of en- 
cyclopaedic knowledge, scientist and ex- 
perimenter, eminent theorist of medicine as 
well as clinician and healer, poet and musi- 
cian, he was also a Grand Vizier (prime 
minister), then a chain-fettered prisoner, an 
indefatigable traveller who visited many 
regions of central Asia and Persia, and the 
author of a vast corpus of writings covering 
almost every branch of contemporary 
knowledge. 
This great thinker was also a man whose 
human qualities of integrity and nobility of 
character gave rise to a host of legends 
some of which are still told today. Accor- 
ding to one of these stories, little Husayn'’s 
mother was bathing him in a bowl when she 
unwittingly. dropped a gold ring into the 
bathwater and then threw it away. When 
4 
by Muhamed S. Asimov 
she noticed that the ring had gone, she ac- 
cused a servant of responsibility for its 
disappearance and severely punished her. 
Thereupon, young Husayn, wishing to rec- 
tify this injustice, spoke up and said: 
“Mother, beg the servant's pardon for it was 
not she who lost the ring’’. These are said to 
have been Avicenna's first words. 
Born in 980 AD (370 of the Hegira) to 
Abd-Allah, an official at Balkh (in the nor- 
thern part of present-day Afghanistan) and 
to Sitora, the daughter of a farmer from the 
village of Afshana near Bukhara, Avicenna 
revealed his exceptional qualities very early 
in life. By the age of ten he had already com- 
pleted the usual school curriculum and 
could recite all the Koran by heart. At six- 
‘teen he was a physician whose renown was 
such that he was summoned to treat the 
Emir of Bukhara himself. By curing the Emir 
the young doctor unlocked for himself the 
doors of the Emir's celebrated library, the 
“Sanctuary of Wisdom". 
‘By eighteen or nineteen,” Avicenna later 
told his disciple and biographer Juzjani, “| 
had already made myself familiar with the 
whole of philosophical knowledge — logic, 
physics, mathematics, geometry, 
arithmetic, astronomy, music, medicine and 
many other disciplines —so that | met no one 
who was my master”. 
This was no exaggeration. His memory, 
and the range and depth of his knowledge 
were stupendous. When the library of 
Bukhara burned down, people consoled 
themselves by saying: “The Sanctuary of 
Wisdom has not perished. It has been 
transferred into the brain of Al-Shayk 
al-Ra’is!” 
Avicenna’'s relatively brief life (he died 
aged fifty-seven) could be epitomized as 
one of titanic creation. He worked at all 
times and in all conditions. He wrote or dic- 
tated his works day and night, in prison or 
on his travels, even on horseback. The Ira- 
nian scholar Said Nafissi calculated that he 
wrote (or had attributed to him) 456 works in 
Arabic and 23 in Persian. At least 160 books 
by Avicenna are listed in the catalogues of 
the world’s libraries.

Avicenna’s birth in the Christian calendar {for details see page 46). 
Opposite page: a medal just issued by Unesco to mark the thousandth meet) 
A medieval engraving depicts Avicenna 
seated on a throne, a laurel crown on his 
head. Galen and Hippocrates are shown at 
each side of him. If Galen and Hippocrates 
were the fathers of medicine, the unknown 
artist seems to be saying, Avicenna was its 
prince and its hero. 
This symbolic representation of 
Avicenna's qualities is fully justified, for in 
the Middle Ages the words Avicenna and 
medicine were virtually synonymous. His 
great work the Canon of Medicine is a 
remarkable synthesis of medical knowledge, 
which presents the achievements of the 
most outstanding Greek, Indian, Iranian and 
Arab physicians. The author's range, the 
logical rigour of his thought, the con- 
ciseness and lucidity of his exposition, his 
novel approach to the eternal problems of 
medicine as well as to the formulation and 
solution of new questions, the freshness 
and originality of his thought—all these fac- 
tors make the Canon a work without parallel 
(see article page 13). 
Translated into Latin in the twelfth cen- 
tury by Gerard of Cremona, it became for 
centuries a veritable Bible of medicine. (In 
fact, after the invention of printing with 
movable type, it became the second most 
widely printed book after the Bible.} In the 
Canon Avicenna not only produced a 
brilliant synthesis of his predecessors’ work, 
he greatly enriched medical science through 
his own observations and discoveries.

### 42997: Avicenna: Ibn Sina, a universal genius

He was the first person to describe cor- 
rectly the anatomy of human eye muscles, 
and devised an explanation for the 
mechanism of sight which is not far remov- 
ed from the modern conception of this 
phenomenon. He explained with precision 
the heart's system of ventricles and valves. 
He described smallpox and measles, 
illnesses unknown to the physicians of 
Ancient Greece. His analysis of diabetes 
-does not differ greatly from that made eight 
centuries later by the English specialist 
Thomas Willis. 
He put forward the hypothesis that cer- 
tain infectious diseases are transmitted by 
“tiny organisms’ in water and in the at- 
mosphere, and in the eighteenth century 
this hypothesis was confirmed by the Dutch 
scientist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek 
(1632-1723) in research using microscopes 
he had constructed himself {see Unesco 
Courier, June 1977). His observations on the 
pulse are of very great interest (he counted 
sixty simple and thirty complex variants), 
and modern science has added few 
refinements to his work. 
He invented a number of diagnostic pro- 
cedures. The percussion method, for exam- 
ple, whereby internal sicknesses are located 
by tapping the patient's body with the 
finger, is associated with Avicenna, 
although it was later rediscovered by the 
Viennese physician Leopold Auenbrugger 
{1722-1809}. However, the essential impor- 
tance of the Canon lies in the principle of 
“natural causality’ on which it is based and 
from which Avicenna drew inspiration not 
only in the field of medicine but in all his 
scientific work. 
Modern science came into being when 
scholars began to see the physical world not 
as the symbolic reflection of another, 
spiritual world, but as a set of natural causes 
and effects which could be studied through 
observation, research and experiment 
leading to the formulation of new 
hypotheses. The works of Avicenna turned 
Western thought in the direction which 
would give birth to modern science. 
The Ancient Greeks had made a synthesis 
of the then-known cultural values, including . 
those of the Orient. The culture of the 
Roman Empire assimilated many elements 
of Hellenism and of the science of the Orien- 
tal peoples. Then, in the medieval Orient, 
came a period which can be compared for 
brilliance with the European Renaissance. 
Avicenna was a luminary of this age, but he 
lived and worked in a cultural and historical 
setting which had produced other geniuses 
such as the Persian poets Rudaki and Fer-- 
dowsi, the physician Abu Bakr Razi, the 
astronomer Abu Mahmud Khodjendi, and 
the encyclopaedists al-Farabi and al-Biruni. 
Avicenna sparked off a new cultural 
movement which, enriched by the in- 
vigorating sources of the past, swept 
westwards from the Orient. First of all it 
reached Spain; then it spread to the South 
of France, where it made a contribution to 
the development of freedom of thought in 
Europe. This process reached its climax at 
the time of the Crusades, when Arab and 
Byzantine cultures once more began to 
spread in Europe. The thought of Avicenna 
was thus an essential link in the develop- 
ment and expansion of a unique human 
civilization. 
It would be hard to over-estimate the in- 
fluence of Avicenna's scientific and

During the age of Avicenna, the Islamic world was creatively developing the 
mass of scientific knowledge inherited from the mosaic of cultural traditions it 
had encountered during its rapid expansion. As well as developing 
mathematical theories of remarkable accuracy, Muslim astronomers also served 
"the Islamic community's practical need to determine the times of daily prayers 
at different latitudes and longitudes and to work out the direction of Mecca 
from every locality where prayers were performed. Avicenna himself made 
astronomical observations and devised a contrivance for increasing the 
precision of instrumental readings. The copper astrolabe, above right, was made 
in Iraq in the 9th century AD. It was used for measuring the height of celestial   bodies and hence determining the time of day or night. Above left, iron 
compasses of the kind a scholar-scientist of Avicenna's time would have used.

Avicenna’s Canon of Medicine has been called “perhaps the most influential single work in 
the history of medicine”. Written in Arabic, it yould later be translated into Persian, 
Turkish, Urdu and other Islamic languages as well as into Hebrew, Catalan and Latin. But 
although ‘the prince of physicians” was the period's most illustrious figure, he did not - 
stand alone, for numerous medical authorities of the highest rank emerged in the Islamic 
world in the 10th and 11th centuries. One of them was the Arabo-Spanish physician al- 
Zahrawi (d. c. 1013) known in the West as Albucasis, whose treatise on surgery, profusely 
illustrated with drawings of surgical instruments designed by the author, became the 
leading textbook on surgery in Europe for some 500 years. Above, a page from the treatise.

### 42997: Avicenna: Ibn Sina, a universal genius

) analytical concepts, set forth by one who 
was both philosopher and man of gcience, 
on the development of European thought. 
He threw new light on Aristotle's logic by 
considerably modifying the problems con- 
nected with the Aristotelian syllogism, en- 
visaging syllogisms based on categorical 
judgements as well as syllogisms based on 
hypothetical and conventional judgements. 
" But that is not all. Interesting though 
Avicenna’s judgements on induction, intui- 
tion and many other concepts may be, what 
needs to be emphasized above all else is the 
great store he set by logic. For him logic was 
the very touchstone of knowledge which 
makes it possible to realize "how what is not 
known allows itself to be understood thanks 
to what is known” and also ‘that all 
knowledge which has not been weighed in 
the balance [of reason] is not incontestable 
and consequently is not authentic 
knowledge". 
Avicenna’s contribution to logic was 
stressed in the thirteenth century by the 
English philosopher Roger Bacon 
(1214-1294), one of the first champions of 
experimental science. Bacon's appreciation 
is particularly important since in Avicenna 
the logician and the experimenter are 
inseparable. 
He formulated many original ideas which 
heralded later discoveries, notably the prin- 
ciple of inertia set forth by the Italian 
physicist and astronomer Galileo 
(1564-1642) and Darwin's theory of evolu- 
tion. His methods of determining the 
longitudinal differences between two points 
on the earth's surface and the height and 
azimuth of stars were reinvented five hun- 
dred years later. 
It is known that on 24 May 1032, Avicenna 
observed with the naked eye and described 
a rare phenomenon: the passage of Venus 
across the solar disc, This calls for a recti- 
fication in the history of science, for it was 
long thought that this phenomenon had 
been observed for the first time in 1639 by 
the English astronomer Jeremiah Horrocks 
(1617-1641). 
If Avicenna was a pioneer in sO many 
fields, it is because he devoted all his life, in 
medicine and philosophy, poetry and music, 
education and sociology, to a single goal: in- 
creasing the sum of human happiness and 
goodness. This he saw as the ultimate pur- 
pose of philosophy. Believing as he did that 
there should be “understanding between 
men, established standards of equity and 
law", he expressed views which foreshadow 
the idea of the Social Contract formulated in 
the eighteenth century by Jean-Jacques 
Rousseau (1712-1778). 
The title of Avicenna’s second en- 
cyclopaedic work, the Kitab al-Shifa (Book 
of Healing) is particularly appropriate. 
Whereas the Canon dealt with healing the 
body, the Shifa dealt with healing the soul 
so that men could become morally strong 
and noble. (See article page 20). 
The humanist ideas of Avicenna, who 
saw in man an innate aspiration towards 
beauty and harmony, and saw love as the 
driving force in society, are expounded in his 
Treatise on Love and in his philosophical 
writings, Hayy ibn Yagzan (The Living, Son 
of the Dead), Salaman wa Absal and At- 
Tayr {The Bird). They had an enriching in- 
fluence on the later development of the 
literature of the peoples of the Orient and on 
the work of the great poet Dante 
(1265-1321). 
Some specialists believe that through the 
works of the philosopher and scholar Alber- 
tus Magnus (c.1200-1280), Dante came 
under a strong influence from Greco-Arab 
philosophy and especially from Averroés 
(Ibn Rushd, 1126-1198), who had himself 
adopted many of Avicenna’s ideas and also 
made Avicenna known in Europe. Dante 
himself remarked that he could not cite all 
those of his predecessors who had influenc- 
ed him, but did include Avicenna among the 
figures whose names he mentions in the 
Divine Comedy. 
The Persian astronomer and mathemati- 
cian Omar Khayyam (died around 1123) is 
widely known as the author of the immortal 
Rubaiyat (Quatrains). It is less well known 
that he regarded Avicenna as his master, not 
only in philosophy and the exact sciences 
but in poetry, for it was Avicenna who 
created the philosophical rubaiyat as a form 
of expression. A number of these quatrains 
have in fact survived, and they are 
remarkable both for the perfection of their 
poetic form and for the profundity of their 
thought. 
It is also recorded that Omar Khayyam, 
shortly before his death, read with great 
concentration the metaphysics of the Book 
of Healing. As for Avicenna himself, when 
he felt that he was about to die, he freed his 
servants and distributed all his wealth to the 
poor. On 18 June 1037 (Ramadan of the year 
428 of the Hegira), he died in the desert near 
the town of Hamadhan. 
According to one story which has sur- 
vived, he wished to vanquish death and 
achieve immortality. He is said to have 
prepared forty different products which his 
pupil was to administer to him in a predeter- 
mined order, immediately after his death. 
The pupil faithfully accomplished this task, 
and to his great astonishment the inert body 
of his master became supple and youthful as 
he injected the medicines. His face became 
pink, he began to breathe again... and then 
came the moment to administer the last cap- 
sule, which would bring about the Master's 
resurrection. Unable to contain himself, the 
pupil seized the capsule... but his hands 
trembled, it slipped from his fingers, and the 
mysterious liquid soaked away in the sand. 
Fortunately, Avicenna has remained im- 
mortal in the minds of men.

My Odyssey 
by Avicenna 
Our knowledge of the early life of Avicenna (Ibn Sina) is based on a book compiled by 
Abu Ubaid al-Juzjani, his pupil and companion for twenty-five years. Although the 
latter part of the book was written by al-Juzjani, the first part, which recounts the 
great philosopher's life from his childhood until his return to Gorgan, was dictated by 
Avicenna himself. It paints a vivid picture of a precocious intellect fully aware of his 
Y father was from Balkh. During Bukhara, an ancient metropolis. In the 
own genius and of the incredible industriousness that brought that genius to fruition. 
the reign of the Samanid ruler 
M Nuh Ibn Mansur (367-387 AH/ 
. 977-997 AD), he moved from Balkh to 
Bukhara where he worked as a functionary. 
He became the Governor of Kharmaithan,

it was there that | began to study the Koran 
and belles-lettres. By the age of ten | had

### 42998: My odyssey

reached the end of the Koran and had read 
much belles-lettres, so that people were 
surprised. 
My father was one of those who had 
responded to the invitation of the Egyptians 
and was counted among the Isma'‘ilis. He 
had accepted their opinions on the soul and 
on the intellect. My brother likewise. They 
often discussed these matters. | listened to 
them, | grasped what they were saying, and 
they tried to attract me to their rite. On occa- 
sion, too, they would discuss philosophy, 
geometry and Indian arithmetic. Then my 
father decided to have me learn Indian 
arithmetic by sending me to a grocer who 
was in the habit of using that form of 
calculation. 
Meanwhile, one Abu-Abdallah Nateli, 
who professed a knowledge of philosophy, 
came to Bukhara. My father invited him to 
stay with us in the hope that he would teach 
me. Before his arrival | had visited Ismail 
Zahid, becoming an assiduous student of 
Muslim jurisprudence and one of his best 
pupils. | became familiar with the various 
methods of argumentation used by the pro- 
fessionals. Later, under Nateli's guidance, | 
began reading the Eisagoge [an introduction 
to the Categoriae of Aristotle by the third- 
century-AD philosopher Porphyry]. When 
he explained to me the definition of genus, | 
set about verifying the definition in a manner 
whose like he had never heard before, so 
deeply impressing him that he advised my 
father that | should not engage in any other 
occupation but learning. Whatever the 
problem my Master set for me, {| succeeded 
in solving it better than he. | learned from 
him the rudiments of logic, a science with 
whose subtleties he had scant acquain- 
tance. From then on | began to read hooks 
and study the commentaries on my own, so 
that | achieved mastery of logic. | also read 
Euclid's Geometry, under Nateli's guidance 
from the beginning to the fifth or sixth 
figure; as for the rest of the book, | managed 
to solve all the difficulties on my own. Then | 
moved on to [Ptolemy's] A/magest. When | 
had finished the preliminary work and came 
to the geometric figures, Nateli said to me, 
“Read it yourself and solve the difficulties; 
then’ explain to me what you have read so 
that | can distinguish for your benefit the 
true from the false.” (The book was beyond 
the poor man’s powers). And so | began to 
elucidate it by myself, before expounding 
the questions to my Master. How many 
were the difficult problems Nateli had not 
solved until then and which he understood 
thanks to me! | 
Then Nateli left for Gorgan. As for me, | 
applied myself to reading and studying al- 
Farabi's Fusus al-Hikam and other commen- 
taries on physics and metaphysics. As each 
day went by, the doors of knowledge open- 
ed before me. Then | took up medicine and 
proceeded to read the works that had been 
written on that subject. Since medicine is 
not a difficult science, | soon excelled in it 
and skilled doctors studied it under my 
guidance. In addition, | cared for the sick 
practically. Thus the doors of treatment bas- 
ed on experience opened before me, in a 
way that cannot be described. At the same 
time | kept up with my studies of religious 
law and disputation, By then | was sixteen 
years of age. 
During the next year and a half | became 
increasingly immersed in my studies. | went 
over logic and all the problems of philosophy

once again. At that period | did not sleep 
one night through, and worked all day, ac- 
quiring knowledge. | reduced every state- 
ment and proposition | came across into its 
syllogistic premisses; then | examined the 
- possible results of the premisses and observ- 
ed their conditions until the moment when 
the correct solution of the problem became 
indubitable. Whenever | was baffled by a 
problem, or could not work out the middle 
term of a syllogism, | repaired to the 
mosque. | begged and prayed the creator of 
the universe to reveal to me what had been 
locked in obscurity and to make diffficulties 
easy for me. Then, at night, | would return 
home, set my lamp before me and begin 
again to read and write. Whenever sleep 
began to overcome me or | felt exhausted, | 
drank a frugal glass of wine and waited for 
my energy to return. Then | began to read 
again, and when | dozed off | would see in a 
dream the very same question that | was 
pondering, so that the solutions to many 
problems appeared to me in my sleep. | con- 
tinued unremittingly to follow this routine 
until | possessed a solid mastery of the 
=», 
  
    
         
sciences and held them in my grasp as far as 
our human faculties allow. Everything | 
learned at that time is not replaced by what | 
have learned more recently, even until to- 
day. Thus | mastered logic, the natural 
sciences and mathematics. 
Then | returned to the study of the divine 
science. | read [Aristotle's] Metaphysics, but 
without understanding a word of it. The 
author's intentions remained lost in obscuri- 
ty to me. Although I read the book forty 
times from end to end until | knew it by 
heart, | could grasp neither its meaning nor 
its purpose. | despaired of understanding it 
by my own efforts and said to myself: 'This 
book is incomprehensible’’. Then one day | 
was walking through the book bazaar when 
a bookseller proffered me a book whose 
price he was shouting out. Discouraged as | 
was, | rebuffed him, convinced that there 
was nothing to be gained from this science. 
The vendor stood his ground and said: “Buy 
this book. It is cheap. | am selling it off for 
three dirhams because its owner is in needy 
circumstances.” And so | bought it. The 
book turned out to be Abu Nasr al-Farabi's

### 42998: My odyssey

Avicenna’s pleasant life at Gurganj 
came to an abrupt end when Sultan 
Mahmud of Ghazna demanded that the 
brilliant group of artists and 
philosophers gathered under the 
protection of Emir Ali Ibn Ma’'mun be 
sent to grace his own court. Avicenna 
was unwilling to comply and, to avoid 
the Sultan's clutches, was obliged to 
flee Gurganj. Travelling farther and 
farther westwards, he crossed the 
Karakum desert eventually reaching 
Nissa. Not far from Nissa at the present- 
day town of Meyhana, stands the 
“mausoleum (photo top left) of the sufi, 
or Muslim mystic, Abu Said, whom 
Avicenna is thought to have known and 
from whom he may have acquired a 
knowledge of Islamic mysticism. 
Another of Avicenna’s stopping-places 
was Meshked-i-Misriana, then a 
beautiful and populous town whose 
ruined minarets {photo bottom left) 
today rise like a mirage from the desert. 
After many other vicissitudes Avicenna 
at last reached Isfahan where he 
became physician and adviser to the 
Emir. Here, at the peak of his career, he 
wrote in his native tongue, Persian, one 
of his major works —the Book of 
Knowledge. Photo right, the 
soaring arches of the Friday Mosque at 
Isfahan. Worn out by his travels and the 
hardships and alarums of an eventful 
life, Avicenna died, in August 1037, on 
the desert road between Isfahan and 
Hamadhan, to which city his body was 
taken. Today, his remains are at rest in 
a new mausoleum (photo bottom right} 
built during the 1950s by Iranian 
architect Khusheng Saihun. The 
mausoleum houses a huge library. 
Twelve columns form a thirty-metre- 
high tower supporting a cone-shaped 
roof. They represent the twelve 
branches of learning in which the 
genius of Avicenna found expression.

Commentaries on the Metaphysics. | rushed 
home and read it. The whole purport of 
[Aristotle's treatise] straightaway became 
clear to me because | already knew the work 
by heart. In a transport of delight, | began 
the following day to distribute abundant 
alms to the poor as a thanksgiving. 
At this time the Emir Nuh Ibn Mansur, the 
ruler of Bukhara, was afflicted with a serious 
illness which the doctors were unable to 
cure. | was renowned among these physi- 
cians for the range of my studies. They sug- 
gested to the prince that he should summon 
me. So off | went and joined the other physi- 
cians who were treating him. And | 
distinguished myself in his service. 
One day | asked him to grant me access to 
his library, to examine the books there and 
to read the medical works. He agreed to my 
request. | made nw way into a mansion with 
many chambers, with chest upon chest of 
books in each. Each room was devoted to a 
single subject, one room containing works 
of literature and poetry, another works of 
jurisprudence. | perused the catalogue of 
books of the Ancients and asked for all

) those | needed. Among them | saw books 
whose very names were unknown to 
many — works which | had never seen before 
and have not seen since. 
| read these books, profiting from them 
and acquainting myself with each author's 
rank in his own field of knowledge. At the 
age of eighteen, | had finished studying all 
these sciences. At that period my knowledge 
was due above all to my memory; today | am 
more mature, otherwise my knowledge is 
exactly the same and nothing has changed. 
A neighbour of mine called Abu’l Hassan 
al-Aruzi asked me to write a scientific en- 
cyclopaedia for him. In answer to his re- 
quest | wrote the Majmu (Compendium) 
which | signed in his name and in which | 
covered all the sciences except 
mathematics. | was then twenty-one years 
old. Another neighbour of mine was a native 
of Khorezm named Abu Bakr al-Baraqi. He 
had no equal in jurisprudence, Koranic ex- 
egesis and asceticism and had a strong lean- 
ing for the speculative sciences. He asked 
me to write a commentary on these scien- 
tific works and so | wrote al-Hasi/ wa al- 
Mahsul (The Import and the Substance) in 
about twenty volumes. | also wrote for him a 
work on ethics which | called a/-Birr wa al- 
J/thm (Good Work and Evil), works which 
can only be found at his dwelling and which 
he never lent out for copying. 
Then my father died and my cir- 
cumstances changed completely. | accepted 
a post in the Sultan's employment and had 
to move from Bukhara to Gurganj. The vizier 
of the ruler of Khorezm, Ali Ibn Ma'mun, 
was a learned man by the name of Abu-l Hu- 
sain as-Soheili. 1 presented myself to this 
ruler, wearing the clothing appropriate to 
jurists, with scarf and chin-wrap. A monthly 
salary, in keeping with my talents, was fix- 
ed. Some time afterwards, again constrain- 
ed by necessity, | moved from Khorezm to 
the confines of Khorasan, passing through 
Baward, then Tus then Shaqggan, then 
Samangan, then Jajarm and thence to 
Gorgan. My entire purpose was to reach the 
Emir Qabus; but it happened at that moment 
that Qabus was taken and imprisoned in a 
fortress, where he died. After this | went to 
Dihistan where | fell very ill, then returned to 
Jurjan where Abu Ubain al-Juzjani made 
friends with me; and | composed a poem on 
my condition in which there is a verse 
saying: 
And great once | became, no more would 
city hold me, 
And when my value rose, no one would care 
to buy me.

Milestones in a restless life 
* 980 AD (370 of the Hegira), birth of Avicenna (Abu Ali al-Husayn |bn Abd-Allah Ibn Hassan 
Ibn Ali Ibn Sina) near the city of Bukhara (in the present-day Soviet Socialist Republic of 
Uzbekistan) in a village of which his father was governor. As a very young child, begins to learn 
Arabic and the Koran. 
* The family soon moves to Bukhara. By the age of ten, Avicenna can recite the 114 chapters 
of the Koran from memory. 
* Under the guidance of gifted teachers, Avicenna extends the range of his knowledge to a 
prodigious degree. His last tutor, the philosopher Nateli, leaves because he has nothing more to 
teach him. 
* At sixteen years of age Avicenna has won a reputation as a doctor and is beginning to attract 
a growing stream of patients. 
* Around the age of eighteen he has already assimilated all the knowledge of his time in 
theology, Arabic literature, geometry, mathematics, physics, logic and philosophy. 
* Succeeds, where all other physicians have failed, in curing the Samanid Sultan of Bukhara, 
Nuh Ibn Mansur; wins the Sultan's favour and is rewarded with access to his library. 
* While at Bukhara writes his first works, notably a/-Hasil wa al-Mahsul (The Import and the 
Substance) and a/-Birr wa al-Ithm (Good Work and Evil). 
¢ In the year 1001 AD (392 of the Hegira) the Samanid State is threatened by the powerful 
Sultan Mahmud of Ghazna (in present-day Afghanistan). Avicenna sets out for Gurganj, capital 
of Khorezm (in what is now the Turkmen SSR) whose vizier Abu-l Husayn as-Soheili is a lover 
of learning. The Emir of Gurganj, Ali Ibn Ma’mun, has gathered around him a galaxy of il- 
lustrious scholars including the renowned al-Biruni, Abu Nasr al-Arraq, the Christian Abu 
Masihi, and Abul Kheir al-Khammar. 
* After a short stay, Avicenna is obliged to leave Gurganj when the Sultan of Ghazna demands 
that all the Gurganj scientists be sent to his court. Prince Ma’'mun is forced to yield to his 
powerful neighbour, but Avicenna, accompanied by the Christian Masihi, who will not survive 
the journey, leaves for Gorgan, southeast of the Caspian Sea. 
* While at Gorgan meets Abu Ubaid al-Juzjani who (until Avicenna’s death a quarter of a cen- 
tury later) will be his most faithful disciple and his biographer. 
* For two years Avicenna devotes himself to study and writing. Finishes a/-Mabda wa al-Ma’ad 
(The Beginning and the Return) and embarks on one of his masterworks, the Canon of 
Medicine. 
® Leaves Gorgan and journeys to the city of Raiy (whose ruins today stand southwest of 
Teheran), the capital of prince Majd el-Dowleh. Avicenna treats the prince and cures him. 
* In 1014 AD (405 of the Hegira) leaves Raiy and settles near Hamadhan. 
* Avicenna, whose reputation has preceded him, is summoned to the bedside of prince Shams 
el-Dowleh, who appoints him vizier (prime minister). 
* After being toppled by an army mutiny, Avicenna is reinvested as grand vizier, and for the 
next six years lives a relatively stable life governed by a crushing work-timetable. 
* Begins his great encyclopaedic work on philosophy the Shifa (The Book of Healing). Rises 
before dawn, teaches his pupils in the early morning, leads them to prayers as an Imam, writes 
fifty pages a day of the Shifa. 
* In 1021 AD (412 of the Hegira) his protector, prince Shams el-Dowleh, dies, and his son 
refuses to reinvest Avicenna as grand vizier. Goes into hiding where he virtually completes the 
Shifa, without, as he would later point out, reference to written texts and relying entirely on his 
prodigious memory. 
e A secret letter to the ruler of Isfahan, prince Ala el-Dowleh, is intercepted, Avicenna’s hiding 
place is revealed and he is cast into prison with his faithful disciple Juzjani. During four months 
in prison writes the Risalat Haiy ibn Yaqzan (The Treatise of Living, the Son of the Vigilant), the 
al-Hidaya (The Book of Guidance) and the al-Adwiyat al-Qalbiyya (The Cardiac Remedies). 
* After a war between princes Sama el-Dowleh and Ala el-Dowleh, in which the latter is vic- 
torious, Avicenna is released but is obliged to live at Hamadhan. 
* In 1023 AD (414 of the Hegira) flees to Isfahan accompanied by the faithful Juzjani. 
* At Isfahan, the final stage in Avicenna's tumultuous odyssey, the philosopher spends the last 
fourteen years of his life under the protection of prince Ala el-Dowleh. 
* Works on astronomy, and so the story goes, writes the Book of Knowledge at the prince's re- 
quest. Adds a chapter on music to the Shifa and writes a work on linguistics entitled The 
Language of the Arabs. 
* During a campaign waged against Hamadhan by Ala el-Dowleh, Avicenna is seized by a 
severe attack of colic which he tries to cure too quickly. 
* Dies on the first Friday of the month of Ramadan, 428 of the Hegira (August 1037 AD), aged 
fifty-seven.

memorized by his pupils”. 
The work comprises five volumes. The 
first volume discusses the general principles. 
It defines medicine and discusses the scope 
of medicine, followed by discourses upon 
temperament, temperament of organs, 
temperament of age and sex, nature and 
variety of humours, diseases of the organs, 
muscles, nerves, arteries and veins, faculties 
and functions, diseases and their aetiology, 
signs and symptoms, pulse, urine, regimens 
to be followed for different ages, preventive 
medicine, management of temperamental 
abnormalities, effect of climate, and 
treatment. 
The second volume consists of two parts. 
The first part discusses the determination of 
the temperament of drugs by experiment 
and influence. Conditions for research into 
drugs are laid down, e.g. the experiments to 
be conducted on the human body, freedom 
of the drug from extrinsic and intrinsic 
alterations, trial to be on an allopathic basis 
and made in simple diseases, and determina- 
tion as to whether the drug is qualitatively 
and quantitatively appropriate to the nature 
“and severity of the disease, and so on.

General principles regarding drug action 
and methods of collecting and pre- 
serving various drug products are described 
as well. The second part lists 760 drugs 
arranged alphabetically. 
The third volume discusses the aetiology, 
symptoms, diagnosis, prognosis and 
. systematic treatment of diseases. It 
describes diseases of the head, e.g. abnor- 
mal temperaments of the brain, and 
headache, epilepsy, paralysis, etc., diseases 
of the eye, nose, ear, and throat; diseases of 
the alimentary tract, genito-urinary system, 
diseases of the muscles, joints, and feet. 
The fourth volume treats of general 
diseases. Part | deals with fevers and their 
treatment, Part Il with boils and swellings, 
leprosy, minor surgery, wounds and their 
general treatment, injuries, ulcers and glan- 
dular swellings, Part Ill with poisons, and 
Part IV with “beauty culture’, 
Volume V is an agrabadhin (the Arab 
equivalent for formulary}. A notable 
predecessor to Avicenna’s work is the for- 
mulary by the Arab philosopher al-Kindi 
(800-873 AD). It comprises description of 
special prescriptions and antidotes, 
methods of preparing pills, pessaries, sup- 
positories, powders, syrups, decoctions, 
confections, elixirs, etc., prescriptions for 
different diseases; weights and measures. 
The impact of the Canon has been im- 
mense. Translated into Latin a century after 
its appearance by the famous Italian 
translator Gerard of Cremona, it gained so 
much popularity that in the last thirty years 
of the fifteenth century it was issued sixteen 
times and more than twenty times in the six- 
teenth century. It was still being printed and 
read in the second half of the seventeenth 
century, and was consulted by medical prac- 
titioners regularly. It continued as a text- 
book until 1650 in the Universities of Mont- 
pellier and Louvain. The medical cur- 
riculum in Vienna and Frankfurt-on-the- 
Oder, in the sixteenth century, was largely 
based on the Canon and the Ad Alman- 
sorem of al-Razi. The noted Avicenna 
scholar Soheil M. Afnan, speaking of its 
popularity, remarks: 
"The translation of the Canon by Andrea 
Alpago (d. 1520) of italy was followed by 
even later versions which were taught in 
various European universities, especially in 
Italy and France. It was not until human 
dissection came to be allowed that Euro- 
pean anatomists detected certain 
anatomical and physiological errors of Galen 
which had been transmitted to Europe 
through the works of Avicenna.” 
A special feature of the Canon is’ its 
broadness and catholicity. It has now been 
established beyond doubt that Ayurvedic* 
works had become available in Arabic in the 
seventh ‘century, and during the Abbasid 
period Salih Ibn Duhn and the Hindu 
* Ayurveda is the traditional Hindu system of 
medicine based largely on homeopathy and 
naturopathy.

astronomer Mankah were the transmitters 
cf this tradition. Some descriptions in the 
Canon, such as those of the pulse, are 
reminiscent of the Chinese system. 
A major contribution of Avicenna is to the 
aetiology of disease. Taking his cue from 
Aristotle, he believes that complete 
knowledge of a thing is possible only if we 
take into account the material of which a 
thing is made, the “efficient cause” that 
moulds it, the “formal cause” which deter- 
mines its shape and quality, and the "final 
cause” or function for which a thing is 
made. Avicenna introduces a theory in 
which the concept of the elements sym- 
bolizes qualities of mass and energy at the 
same time and interaction between the four 
causes. He thus establishes not only the uni- 
ty between organs and functions in the body 
but also brings the body and the outer world 
in appropriate space-time relationship. 
Now the human body is material but is 
vivified by the vital force. The vital force is a 
life-principle organized from the humours. 
He defines psyche as expressing itself as 
mind at the cognitive level and as emotions 
in the heart and thus an integral part of the 
body. 
This concept of causation, then, implies 
that the internal organs belong to each other 
beyond the anatomical limits. Anatomy 
regards the heart as a circumscribed organ 
while for Avicenna it is the part of force oc- 
cupying the whole of the body. 
If we combine the ancient with modern 
knowledge, we might just as well say that 
the arterial vessels with the blood contained 
in them and the autonomic nervous system 
including its hypothalamic centre are one 
great composite of the functional heart 
whose operation pervades the whole body. 
The nafs in Avicenna is anima, which, in 
accordance with the nature of an organism, 
acts as the ultimate determinant or for- 
mative factor for its growth and activity. The 
basic thesis with Avicenna is thus that the 
whole is greater than the sum of its parts 
and that man is a dynamic organism, with 
each individual having his own unique 
temperament. His dynamism cannot be ex- 
plained on the basis of analysis. 
With the help of these concepts Avicenna 
offers a constitutional approach according to 
which disease is to be explained in terms of 
the individual's genetic structure; the kind of 
temperament, structure, and strength of 
faculties possessed by him; environmental 
factors; and Nature's own effort at the 
restoration or maintenance of his life- 
functions. 
The concept of the elements in Avicenna, 
in which heat and cold are two opposite 
types of energy, and dryness and moisture 
are two opposite qualities of mass, is to be 
found in Aristotle. Avicenna’s elaboration of - 
the Aristotelian thesis has been translated as 
follows: The truth is that the first principles 
behind all generable and corruptible 
substances are primary, active or kinetic 
energies and occur either simply in fire, air, 
water and earth or linked to a composite 
lllustrations from an edition of the Canon of Medicine, dating from about 1520 AD, show 
methods of treatment for various spinal disorders. While Avicenna broadly followed 
Hippocrates’ methods for the extension of the vertebral column in the treatment of 
displaced vertebrae, the use bf a specially designed instrument (lower illustration} for 
putting a displaced vertebra back in place was his own invention.

Avicenna’s contribution to pharmacology was original and important and he is credited 
with introducing many previously untried herbs into medical use. Book Il of his Canon 
of Medicine dealt with pharmacology, including the collection and preservation of 
medicinal herbs, and formed the basis of many subsequent works on this subject. 
Above, excerpt from a manuscript known as The Gift of the Believers, written by 
Mohammad Dailani, physician at the court of Shah Ismaili (1686-1694). The illustration is 
of Fasafis, a plant resembling the lentil, which was used to cure disorders of the throat 
and liver and as an antidote to snake-bite. 
temperament. The late Dr. Mazhar H. Shah 
observed that, according to Avicenna, the 
organization of various objects in nature is 
the result of an interaction of the four 
qualities of mass and energy and that the 
four elements mentioned in the Canon are 
merely symbols employed to understand the 
various actions and reactions of the body 
and its environment in qualitative terms. 
Ayurveda has three temperaments: Vata, 
Pitta, and Kapha—as propounded by 
Charak and Sushruta. Hippocrates has also 
three temperaments —apoplectic, phleg- 
matic, and melancholic. 
Galen propounded four temperaments 
—sanguine, choleric, phlegmatic, and 
melancholic. Avicenna formulated four 
temperaments —hot and moist, hot and dry, 
cold and moist, and cold and dry. 
Since then several temperaments have 
been formulated, among those that are well- 
known being those due to Eppinger and 
Hess (1917 and 1931) and Pavlov. The 
former formulated two temperaments, sym- 
patheticotonia and vagotonia, while Pavlov 
propounded four temperaments — lively, im- 
petuous, calm, and weak. These four types 
correspond exactly to the Galenic classifica- 
tion of temperament into the sanguine, 
choleric, and melancholic 
types. 
The “heart” in Avicenna’'s system is not 
just the structural heart described by the 
anatomists but the “functional” heart 
which, as the centre of emotions, thermo- 
regulation, sleep and water metabolism is 
centred in the diencephalon, a portion of the 
brain which in the phylogeny of the race was 
the first to develop. The pituitary gland 
which subserves as well as regulates the 
functions of this region may also be included 
in the concept of the heart”. In De Viribus 
Cordis (paragraph 172) Avicenna says: 
“The foundation or beginning of all these 
faculties is traceable to the heart, as is 
agreed upon even by those philosophers 
who think that the source of visual, auditory 
and gustatory power lies in the Brain.” 
The Canon abounds in original observa- 
tions made by Avicenna during the course 
of medical practice, e.g. the distinction of 
mediastinitis from pleurisy; the contagious 
nature of phthisis; the diffusion of disease 
by water and soil; sexual diseases and 
perversions; nervous diseases; and careful 
description of the diseases of the skin. The 
materia medica describes about 760 drugs 
and Avicenna has outlined pharmacological

methods. The book on materia medica and 
pharmacology contains a passage upon ex- 
perimentation which according to the 
French scholar A-M. Goichon, sets out the 
three methods — agreement, difference, and 
concomitant variations —which are usually 
associated with the modern scientific 
approach. 
The Canon remained far more accessible 
than the works of Hippocrates, even though 
Arnold of Villanova (1235-1312) described 
Avicenna as a “professional scribbler” 
whose misinterpretation of Galen stupefied 
European physicians, Ibn Zuhr {Avenzoar) 
of Spain described the Canon as ‘“‘waste- 
paper’. Such criticism belittles the critics 
rather than the Shaykh al-Rais. If he 
stupefied the European physicians, why 
should be have been studied in Europe at all 
and why did not European scholars come 
out with their own interpretations of Galen? 
Nor is the historian of science George Sar- 
ton’s contention that ‘His triumph was too 
complete; it discouraged original investiga- 
tions and sterilized intellectual life’’, correct 
for there were many notable physicians, 
surgeons, and scientists after him among 
the Muslims.

### 43002: Notes and nostrums from Dr. Avicenna's casebook

Notes and nostrums 
from Dr. Avicenna’s casebook 
and writings of Avicenna {Ibn Sina) 
there emerges a picture of that 
perpetual search for balance and unity that 
is characteristic of Arabo-lslamic culture. 
There is no contradiction, nor should there 
be, between body and mind, between the 
individual and society, between science and 
faith, between nature and man. 
Fo examination of the character 
The medical arts as propounded by 
Avicenna are free of all those harmful and ir- 
rational explanations with which the 
medicine of Antiquity was blemished and 
which can still be found in certain practices 
of modern fringe medicine. With Avicenna 
medicine became a science. 
He divided medicine into ‘‘theoretical” 
and “practical” medicine, the latter being 
sub-divided further into “curative” and 
“preventive” medicine. Attaching as he did 
great importance to preventive medicine, 
Avicenna listed the following areas in which 
it should be applied: 
“The essential considerations in the art of 
preserving the health consist in maintaining 
equilibrium between various concomitant 
factors. But there are seven matters concer- 
ning which special care must be expended 
to ensure just proportion: Equilibrium of the 
temperament; Selection of the articles of 
food and drink; Evacuation of effete mat- 
ters; Safeguarding the composite; Maintain- 
ing the purity of the air respired; Guarding 
against extraneous contingencies; Modera- 
tion in regard to the movements of the body 
and the motions of the mind, which include 
sleep and wakefulness.” 
With his view of health as a dynamic con- 
cept affecting the whole person, Avicenna 
took into consideration questions of age, 
temperament, constitution, climate, and the 
psychosomatic duality of the individual. 
He devoted many pages of the Canon to 
the safeguarding of the health of the infant: 
“Bathing the infant. In summer time it 
should be bathed in suave, tepid water. In 
winter the water should be on the warm 
side. Whenever possible the mother’s milk 
should be given and by suckling. For that is 
the aliment of all others most like in sub- 
stance to the nutrient material which the in- 
fant receives while in the womb. Experience 
AHMED AROUA /s an Algerian medical doctor 
and poet. These extracts from Avicenna’s Canon 
of Medicine and the accompanying commentaries 
appeared in his book Hygiéne et Prévention Médi- 
cale chez Ibnou Sina (Avicenne) (Hygiene and 
Preventive Medicine in |bn Sina [Avicennal), 
1974. 
18 
by Ahmed Aroua 
shows that merely to place the mother’s nip- 
ple into the infant's mouth is a great help 
towards removing whatever is hurtful to the 
infant.” 
Ahead of his time in many areas of 
medicine, Avicenna was especially con- 
scious of the importance of physical 
exercise: 
“Now exercise is that agent which most 
surely prevents the accumulation of these 
matters and prevents plethora. It is this 
exercise which renews and revives the in- 
nate heat and imparts the necessary 
lightness to the body. For it causes the sub- 
tile heat to be increased and daily disperses 
whatever effete substances have ac- 
cumulated. To forsake exercise would often 
incur the risk of ‘hectic’, because the 
faculties of the members are impaired in- 
asmuch as deprivation of movement 
prevents the access to them of the innate 
breath. And this last is the real instrument of 
life for every one of the members. *’ 
Avicenna also laid great stress on the ef- 
fect of sleep on mental activity: 
“Sleep in moderation assists the 
vegetative faculties in their functions and 
brings the sensitive faculties into repose and 
in so doing restores them and thereby ar- 
rests the dissipation of the breath. The good 
qualities of sleeping by night are that it 
should be continuous and deep. It is also 
bad to go to sleep during the day. The best 
sleep is that which is deep and that which 
occurs after the food has passed on from 
the upper part of the intestine,” 
The Canon also offers much advice on the 
effect on man of the air he breathes and of 
his environment: 
“As long as the air is attempered and pure 
and has no substances admixed which 
would be contrary to the temperament of 
the breath, health will come and remain, 
Otherwise the contrary occurs. The 
substance of the air is good when it is not 
contaminated with extraneous matter such 
as the vapours from marshes and lakes or 
canals and open sewers or the gaseous pro- 
ducts from chemical works or smoke or 
soot. Air is good when jt does not interfere 
with one’s breathing or cause the throat to 
contract.” 
Avicenna expressed in the Canon his 
views on the effects of climate and the 
seasons on human health: 
“Spring. When the temperament of the 
spring conforms to type, it is a very healthy 
season. Diseases of the spring: Inflam- 
matory deposits, carbuncles, anginas, ab- 
! 
f 
! 
scesses of various kinds. There may be 
haemoptysis and troublesome coughs. 
Puberty and the time of life thereabout are 
benefited by the spring”. 
“Summer. In summer: the humours are 
dispersed. The faculties and natural func- 
tions are impaired owing to the excessive 
dispersion. The blood and serous humour 
are diminished and the bilious humour in- 
creases. Diseases of the summer: if very 
hot, tertian and burning fevers, emaciation, 
pains on the ears, ophthalmia. Erysipelas is 
common, also furunculosis; if spring-like, 
mild benign fevers. Rheumatisms and catar- 
rhs also occur. Old people and those of 
similar nature feel stronger in summer.” 
“Autumn. The autumn season brings 
many diseases for these reasons: there is ex- 
posure to sun by day and the nights are 
cold, The blood is much less in amount 
because this season is contrary in tempera- 
ment to the blood. Diseases of autumn: 
fevers, rheumatisms and sciatica, oliguria 
and dysuria, angina, worms. 
“Winter. Winter is a help for digestion. 
Diseases of winter: coryza, pleurisy, 
pulmonary infection, hoarseness and sore 
throat, pains in the chest, side, back and 
loins, apoplexy and epileptic seizures. 
Winter is inimical to old persons. ’’ 
The views expressed by Avicenna on mat- 
ters of housing and public health have an 
astonishing topicality since today these 
problems face urban authorities in ag- 
gravated form: 
“Characters upon which the effect of 
habitable regions on people depends: 
whether high or low-lying; type of adjoining 
country, whether open or sheltered, state of 
soil; whether the water is plentiful or scarce, 
stagnant or flowing; local factors, trees, 
mines, cemeteries, putrescent pools, etc.” 
Finally, it is perhaps somewhat surprising 
to find a physician of the year 1000 AD giv- 
ing careful instructions about the hygienic . 
precautions to be taken before operations, a 
matter which was generally treated very 
lightly as late as the 19th century: 
"The greatest care must be taken during 
surgical operations to prevent infection, 
because a wound can only be treated in the 
absence of infection. Should infection or 
contusion occur, it will accumulate at the 
wound which will suppurate, making 
surgical intervention impossible until it has 
been treated. If the blood in a wound 
becomes infected it must be got rid of as 
quickly as possible.”

AVICENNA AND THE LOVESICK YOUTH 
In this 15th-century miniature, Avicenna is seen at the bedside of an 
ailing young nobleman. It illustrates an incident in Avicenna’s life 
which reveals that he was no less aware than modern physicians of 
the psychosomatic nature of certain illnesses. 
For many months a young nobleman lay sick unto death of a 
strange malady against which the potions and cures proposed by 
the learned doctors called in to treat him were of no avail. In 
despair, his relatives summoned to his bedside the most famous 
doctor in the land. When Avicenna (for he it was} arrived, he 
examined the ailing youth briefly and then asked to be left alone 
with him. Holding the patient's pulse he said: "Tell me, my son, 
about yourself, your life, your relations with your family, your plans 
for the future.” “I am very ill and like to die”, was all the youth's 
reply. “Do not upset yourself like this, you will surely live”, replied

Avicenna. “Tell me, what think you of women?” And, feeling the 
youth's pulse quicken, he went on: “Has your heart never been 
captivated by a woman's beauty?” “No, no", exclaimed the youth 
hotly. “Why do you say ‘No’ to me”, said Avicenna, “When your 
whole body cries out the answer ‘Yes’? What is the maiden’s 
name?" Finally, after a long silence, the young man spluttered out 
the name of his beloved. Avicenna summoned his parents and 
announced solemnly: “The patient is suffering from an incurable 
disease. He is lovesick and fears to tell you of the woman who has 
won his heart. There is but one cure—marriage’’. Some days later, 
after the wedding festivities were over, Avicenna returned home, 
leaving the young nobleman in the care of his few wife and fully 
restored in mind and body.

VICENNA (Ibn Sina} is rightly 
A considered the most important repre- 
sentative of Muslim philosophy. 
Al-Kindi and al-Farabi laid the groundwork 
of this philosophy and established its prin- 
ciples, but it was thanks to Avicenna and his 
clear expositions that it acquired its final 
form and distinguished itself from other 
philosophies. 
Today no one can deny that a Muslim 
philosophy exists. It is neither purely 
Aristotelian nor purely Platonic. It is a 
separate philosophy created by special cir- 
cumstances and by a specific environment. 
It was influenced by ancient philosophies, 
borrowing certain elements from them but 
also incorporating others of its own. It has 
thus become, in its own right, an inde- 
pendent phase in the development of 
human thought. 
It took up all the important philosophic 
issues and dealt with them in an original 
way. It laid great stress on the study of be- 
ing, analysing the one and the many and 
20 
 
by Ibrahim Madkur 
defining their interrelations. It delved deeply 
into the problem of knowledge, 
distinguishing between soul and intellect, 
the innate and the acquired, truth and 
falsehood. It decisively established the 
theory of virtue and happiness; it created a 
hierarchy of values and then classified them, 
thus arriving at the “virtue of virtues’ —per- 
manent contemplation—attained by the 
prophets and other exceptional people. It 
made a careful study of all the various parts 
of philosophy, whether speculative or prac- 
tical — physics, mathematics, metaphysics, 
ethics, economics and politics—adding to 
these medicine, biology, chemistry, botany, 
astronomy and music, all of which were 
regarded as parts of philosophy in the 
widest sense. } 
Assuming this to be the essence of 
Muslim—i.e. Avicenna's—philosophy, the 
Shifa, is, among all his works, the one 
which expresses it best. In the Shifa, he ex- 
pounds philosophical problems in detail, 
analysing them clearly and adding to then® 
certain branches of knowledge considered 
at the time as an integral part of philosophy. 
The work introduces ideas deriving from 
Aristotle, Plato, Plotinus, Zeno and Chrysip- 
pus, but presents them in such a way that 
they form an organic whole. Therein lies 
Avicenna’s originality which appears even 
more striking when he criticizes and either 
refutes or defends the views of the 
Ancients, 
Avicenna himself described the object of 
this great work: “My aim is to include in it all 
the fruits of the sciences of the Ancients, 
which | have checked and which are based 
on outright deduction or induction as ac- 
IBRAHIM BAYUMI MADKUR, of Egypt is 
president of the Academy of the Arabic Lan- 
guage, Cairo, and a distinguished scholar who 
has specialized in Islamic philosophy, notably the 
work of Avicenna. He is the author of several 
studies on the age of Avicenna and has taken part 
in many symposia devoted to the memory of the 
great philosopher. This article is based on his

It is difficult to make anyone believe 
that a person like me is an unbeliever. 
My faith in God is unshakable. If | am 
an infidel, then there is not a single true 
Muslim on earth. Avicenna 
cepted by thinkers who have long sought 
the truth. | have tried to incorporate as 
much as possible of the entire field of 
philosophy.” He adds: ‘| have omitted 
nothing that is of any value in the works of 
the Ancients. If any element is not found in 
its usual place or context, that is because | 
have put it in a place which | considered 
more appropriate.” 
In fact, the book contains such a wealth 
of subject-matter that it is quite unique, and 
unlike any other work of philosophy. It is 
divided into four major “Summae” (jumal): 
Logic, Physics, Mathematics and 
Metaphysics. Each “Summa” in turn is 
divided into books {funun), each book into 
sections {magala) and each section into 
chapters (fusuf). This is the general plan of 
the work, but within each division and sub- 
division there are various subordinate 
sciences and objects of study. 
The Shifa is in fact an encyclopaedia in 
which all the rational sciences have been 
gathered together, predating our modern 
encyclopaedias by six centuries. The 
modern works, of course, deal with very 
many more subjects, but the Shifa does 
cover the whole range of the rational 
sciences as they existed at the time. The 
most surprising thing of all is that it is the 
work of one man, whereas modern en- 
cyclopaedias, from Diderot onwards, have 
been produced by large teams of 
contributors. 
Though its author lacked the peace and 
quiet necessary for a work of such 
God is the depth and the surface. He is 
manifest everywhere and in all things. 
“Avicenna 
magnitude, he succeeded in producing a 
remarkably well-ordered and logically set- 
out book. The work, begun in Hamadhan, 
was completed in Isfahan within a span of 
about ten years. Ibn Sina was forty and in 
his intellectual prime when he started the 
Shifa. By the time he finished it he was 
already past fifty. 
Thus the Shifa is not, as was long 
thought, a commentary on Aristotle, like 
those of Averroés or St. Thomas Aquinas. 
Avicenna included in it the results of his own 
wide-ranging research and theorizing, ac- 
cepting certain views and rejecting others. 
Sometimes he borrows ideas from other 
authors and discusses them, but without 
mentioning their names or quoting his 
sources. 
The best description of the book is to be 
found in the author's own introduction: 
“This book,” he writes, “ultimately presents 
- all the ideas unanimously accepted by prac- 
tically every thinker. Instead of indulging in 
personal prejudice, | have done my best to 
include in it the greater part of philosophy, 
raising objections on each point, then at- 
tempting to disprove them, and showing the 
truth as far as possible. | have taken care to 
mention the main principles together with 
their corollaries, leaving out, however, 
~ anything that seemed to me to be clear from 
22 
what had gone before—or anything that 
happened to slip my memory.” 
This introduction does not seem to have 
been available to the Christian thinkers of 
the Middle Ages or, if it was, it escaped their 
attention. In any case they did not study the 
Shifa in sufficient detail to realize that it was 
not a mere commentary or gloss on 
Aristotle, but an original work in its own 
right. 
Avicenna made the best use of the wealth 
of knowledge available in his time. If one 
book can be said to reflect the period in 
which it was written, the Shifa is un- 
douhtedly the best source of information on 
the intellectual life of the fourth century of 
the Hegira. 
Scholars who have studied this period 
rightly consider it to be the Golden Age of 
rational studies in Islam. A school (the 
Kalam) for interpreting the Koran was set up 
under Ash’ari, and its activities were reg- 
arded as constituting a branch of science. 
Mysticism was also following new paths: it 
went beyond asceticism and hermitism and 
embarked on the explanation of states of 
the soul; it analysed minutely the stages of 
“initiation”; it claimed to attain union 
with God. Muslim philosophy was laying 
down its foundations and establishing its 
principles: al-Farabi, a profound and 
penetrating thinker, organized its various 
parts. 
Islamic medicine reached its zenith with 
the work of the great physician al-Razi 
(Rhazes), and no longer confined itself to 
repeating the dicta of Hippocrates and 
Galen: al-Razi actually made use of his own 
experience. And mathematics and 
astronomy were making great strides: one 
need only mention here the name of al- 
Biruni from among a phalanx of renowned 
scholars and scientists. 
It is generally true to say that while in the 
second and third centuries of the Hegira 
Islamic scholars concentrated mainly on 
translating and assimilating foreign 
sciences, in the fourth century they launch- 
ed into research in their own right, moving 
from assimilation to original creation, 
Usually a book's influence is restricted to 
that of its author and it belongs only within 
the range of that author's work. But there 
are some books which are special and have a 
history and influence of their own. Avicen- 
na's philosophy was the philosophy of the 
whole Arab world from the fifth century to 
the beginning of the fourteenth century of 
the Hegira: all authors, philosophers, 
If | had made no impact on men's 
hearts, they would have ignored me. 
They would have been neither for me 
nor against me. Avicenna 
theologians and mystics, of all schools of 
thought, drew upon it. During this time, 
even scientific studies in medicine, biology, 
astronomy and mathematics used it as a 
base. Avicenna is the Philosopher of Islam, 
par excellence. 
It is true that al-Ghazali's attack on 
philosophy and the “falasifa” [philosophers) 
turned many scholars away from Avicenna. 
But this did not put an end to his influence. 
It can be said that such philosophy as sur- 
vived in Islamic culture certainly owes its ex- 
istence to him. The Spanish schoo! of 
philosophy which developed later never

The unifying perspective of Islamic 
science, in which all forms of 
knowledge are interdependent, 
found brilliant expression in 
Avicenna with his encyclopaedic 
mind, voracious appetite for 
learning, and determination to 
organize his thought in a logical, 
systematic way. One of his 
accomplishments in the natural 
sciences was in mineralogy where 
his descriptions and classification 
of metals and minerals and his 
theories on their origins became a 
major source of geological 
knowledge in the Islamic world as 
well as in Christian Europe until the 
Renaissance. Above left, an 
illustration from an 18th-century 
Persian manuscript on mineralogy. 
Muslim ophthalmologists in 
Avicenna’s time were leaders in 
their field and their knowledge was 
transmitted both westwards into 
Europe and eastwards into India. 
Avicenna’s own highly influential 
treatise on the subject not only 
discusses the anatomy of the eye 
and the principles of vision but 
gives his readers practical, down- 
to-earth tips on how to prevent 
their sight from failing. Above 
right, detail from a sixteenth- 
century ophthalmological treatise 
now in the library of Istanbul 
University. Below, decorative 
brickwork in the Friday mosque at 
Kerman, Iran, shows how geometry 
can be used in Islamic art and 
architecture to express the 
cherished idea which presides over 
Avicenna’s towering achievements 
as a thinker: the emanation of 
Multiplicity from Unity and the 
return of Multiplicity to Unity—the 
Presence of the One in the Many.

Avicenna’s theories were the 
cornerstone of the medical syllabus 
from the 12th to the 16th century.

Avicenna’'s ideas and in his writings 
cited the Master over 600 times.

In the Shifa and other works 
Avicenna went deeply into the 
theory of music, which he 
defined as “a mathematical 
science in which there is 
discussed the state of melody 
insofar as it is in harmony or in 
discord and the state of the 
intervening periods”. According 
to a tradition going back to 
Pythagorean times music was 
considered as an integral part of 
science, and as George Sarton 
writes in his Introduction to the 
History of Science, "music 
could be more easily transmitted 
by popular contact than almost 
any other activity, and practical 
music would be followed, 
sooner or later, by theoretical 
music. Thus did it come to pass 
that Muslim science penetrated 
Christendom at least partly upon 
the wings of music.” This very 
rare illuminated manuscript was 
produced in Spain or Morocco 
in the early 13th century. It 
shows a scene from the story of 
Bayad and Riyad in which the 
lover Bayad sings of his woes to 
a noble lady and her attendants.

This detail from a 17th-century 
Persian manuscript in the 
Islamic Museum, Cairo, shows a 
figure purported to be Avicenna 
teaching a group of students. In 
addition to the astonishing gifts 
and scintillating mind which 
fascinated his contemporaries 
Avicenna also seems to have 
possessed striking good looks 
and an impressive figure. A 
description of him attending 
court at Isfahan in the closing 
years of his life relates how, 
wearing a long robe and a 
turban of coarse cloth, "he used 
to sit very close to the Amir, 
whose face became radiant with 
delight as he marvelled at his 
good looks and accomplishment 
and wit. And when he spoke all 
those present listened 
attentively, none uttering a 
word.”

SONG OF THE SOUL 
It descended upon thee from out of the regions above, 
That exalted, ineffable, glorious, heavenly Dove. 
"Twas concealed from the eyes of all those who its nature 
would ken, __ 
Yet it wears not a veil, and is ever apparent to men. 
Unwilling it sought thee and joined thee, and yet, though it 
grieve, 
It is like to be still more unwilling thy body to leave. 
It resisted and struggled, and would not be taméd in haste, 
Yet it joined thee, and slowly grew used to this desolate 
waste. 
It weeps, when it thinks of its home and the peace it 
possessed, = 
With tears welling forth from its eyes without pausing 
or rest, 
And with plaintive mourning it broodeth like one bereft 
O’er such trace of its home as the fourfold winds have left. 
Thick nets detain it, and strong is the cage whereby 
It is held from seeking the lofty and spacious sky. 
Until, when the hour of its homeward flight draws near, 
And ‘tis time for it to return to its ampler sphere, 
It carols with joy, for the veil is raised, and it spies 
Such things as cannot be witnessed by waking eyes. 
On a lofty height doth it warble its songs of praise. 
{For even the lowliest being doth knowledge raise.) 
Now why from its perch on high was it cast like this 
To the lowest Nadir's gloomy and drear abyss? 
Was it God who cast it forth for some purpose wise, 
Concealed from the keenest seeker’s inquiring eyes? 
Then is its descent a discipline wise but stern, 
That the things that it hath not heard it thus may learn. 
(Extract from one of Avicenna’s most famous poems. 
Translation Professor E.G. Browne)

lessened Avicenna’s prestige in the East 
despite the relatively large number and im- 
portance of its representatives, in particular 
the prolific Averroés. The fate of this school 
was linked to that of Spain itself and it is not 
surprising that Averroés’ influence should 
have been stronger in the Latin West than in 
the East. 
Avicenna’s books continued to be studied 
after his death. The Najat and /sharat were 
particularly popular, but the Shifa retained 
its attraction: it contains many details not to 
be found in the two other works, and 
scholars wishing to go more deeply into 
their subject found they needed to refer to 
its lengthy explanations. When, for exam- 
ple, al-Ghazali, in the Tahafot al-Falasifa, 
and Shahrastani, in the Nihayat al-lgdam, 
discuss in some detail the creation of the 
world and the impossibility of its eternity, 
the ideas they attribute to Ibn Sina were bor- 
rowed mainly from the Shifa. 
Ibn Rushd (Averroés) often quotes ex- 
tracts from the Shifa either to support his 
own theories or to contradict Avicenna, 
mentioning his name on each occasion. 
Nasir al-Din al-Tusi was one of Avicenna’s 
faithful disciples in spite of the fact that he 
lived two hundred years later: his attitude 
towards Fakhr al-Din al-Razi and the fight he 
waged against him are well known. Similarly 
Ibn Khaldun recognized the importance of 
the Shifa which he mentions several times in 
his Prolegomena. 
Three treatises have dominated Muslim 
theological studies in the last few centuries: 
al-Aga’id by Nasafi, lji's Mawagif and the 
Maqasid of Taftazani. If we examine their 
content and the commentaries that have 
been written on them, we can see that they 
made extensive use of the Shifa. 
In Logic, the general tendency of scholars 
to be as succinct as possible led to works 
such as Abhari’s /sagoge, Qazwini’s Sham- 
siyya and Akhadari's Sullam which have 
dominated the teaching of Logic in the 
Islamic world for the last six hundred years. 
One book, however, published during this 
period, the Basa'ir al-nasiriyya, recalls the 
breadth and clarity of the Shifa’s logic. Its 
author states that he has drawn some of his 
ideas from Ibn Sina, whom he describes as 
the “best of the moderns’’. 
Few works, at any period, have exercised 
a greater influence than the Shifa on human 
thought. In this, Avicenna’s masterwork, 
the duality of his personality is revealed: 
received influence and personal reaction, 
assimilation and original contribution,

### 43005: A Philosopher under fire: Avicenna's doctrines stirred up controversy in his own time and later

A philosopher 
under fire 
Avicenna’s doctrines stirred up controversy 
in his own time and later 
by Reza Davari 
{Ibn Sina) were violently criticized 
both during his own lifetime and after 
his death. Two major accusations were 
levelled against him: atheism and heresy on 
the one hand and a lack of originality on the 
other. 
Some of his opponents stressed con- 
tradictions between his thought and the 
teachings of the Koran, while others regard- 
ed him as a mere compiler. And one gathers 
from Avicenna’s own writings that at a cer- 
tain period of his life he was ostracized 
because of his ideas. 
Among his most disparaging critics were 
the theologian and philosopher Fakhr al-Din 
al-Razi (1149 or 1150-1209) and the 
‘philosopher al-Ghazali (1058-1111) also 
known as Algazel. But the strongest attacks 
came from contemporary theologians. 
T HE philosophical works of Avicenna 
In modern times, a few scholars have 
challenged the originality of Avicenna’s 
work. Some have compared it to that of 
Ferdowsi {c. 930-1020} and al-Biruni 
{973-1048} in astronomy and the natural 
sciences, and of al-Razi {c. 865-923) in 
medicine, concluding in each case that. 
Avicenna's contribution was inferior. Other 
critics even maintained that as a philosopher 
Avicenna had merely revived and expanded 
on the ideas of his illustrious predecessor al- 
Farabi without making any substantial con- 
tribution of his own. 
The first question one may therefore ask 
is whether Avicenna was an innovator in 
philosophy or a mere compiler. Al-Farabi 
(872-950) was undoubtedly the founder of 
Islamic philosophy. But his general views 
mainly reflect fundamental principles 
prevailing during the first centuries of the 
Islamic era. It is therefore likely that if al- 
Farabi had not existed, Avicenna would 
have reached the same conclusions. For 
ideas are not generated spontaneously by 
men; men are dependent upon the ways of 
thinking of their time. 
In fact, the originality of al-Farabi himself) 
has been the subject of long controversies.  Ph

Seven years Avicenna’s senior, al-Biruni was one of the great figures 
who mark a high point of Islamic culture. The two men had a famous 
confrontation at which al-Biruni questioned Avicenna about Aristotle's 
study De Caelo (On the Heavens). The drawing above was made by al- 
Biruni to illustrate the view expressed by Avicenna concerning the 
disposition of the four elements (earth, air, fire and water) between the 
earth and the moon.

Averroés (Ibn Rushd), Ibn Khaldun and their 
contemporaries accused him, as they accus- 
ed Avicenna, of amalgamating philosophy 
and religion. But here criticism comes from 
two diametrically opposed camps. While al- 
Ghazali and Fakhr al-Din al-Razi stigmatize 
the philosophers for views which they con- 
sider incompatible with religious teaching, 
and go as far as to label them heretics, 
Averroés and |bn Khaldun regard 
philosophy and religion as two separate 
paths both leading to the same goal. 
Al-Farabi and Avicenna were convinced, 
however, that their ideas were in line with 
religious ‘thought. They conceived true 
religion as a philosophy and maintained that 
philosophy was the heart of religion. Like al- 
Farabi, Avicenna used philosophy to inter- 
pret certain verses of the Koran. He con- 
sidered philosophy central to Sufism, an 
idea which he discusses at length in the final 
chapter of his work /sharat wa Tanbihat. 
During the nineteenth century, Shi'ite 
thinkers and scholars in Iran revived the idea 
of the separateness of religion and 
philosophy, which Averroés had so pas- 
sionately defended. But, whereas Averroés 
gave pride of place to philosophy, the 
Iranian scholars’ main concern was to 
defend religion. "Greek philosophy... but 
for how long?” they asked, echoing the 
Bahai Sheikh. “Study also the philosophy of 
the believers." 
To sum up, what some consider a heresy 
and others a mixture of Greek ideals and the 
fundamentals of religion forms the very 
essence of Islamic philosophy. But this 
philosophy is far from being a mere copy of 
Greek thought, though it has certainly 
drawn inspiration from it. If Averroés, for 
 wv! A 
“ 
di 
oy ol 
164 os : it SIP, 
example, had confined himself to inter- 
preting Aristotle, his name would never 
have been remembered in the history of 
human thought. 
An anecdote related by Avicenna himself 
illustrates this point. Avicenna read Aristo- 
tle’s Metaphysics forty times, but it was only 
with the aid of al-Farabi’s commentary on 
the Metaphysics, the De Interpretatione, 
that he finally succeeded in overcoming the 
difficulties he found in the text. Al-Farabi’s 
true merit, according to Avicenna, was that 
he started the process of incorporating 
Greek philosophy into the Muslim view of 
the world. Al-Farabi served as a link bet- 
ween Aristotle and Avicenna by drawing 
together the ideas of the first and the value 
system of the second. 
We lack detailed information about the 
subjects which made it hard for Avicenna to 
understand the Metaphysics, and therefore 
- cannot give precise opinions on the matter. 
It is very likely, however, that his main dif- 
ficulty lay in commenting on Aristotle's key 
ideas, in the context of a philosophy fun- 
damentally based on the belief in the ex- 
istence of God. 
This anecdote about Avicenna’s dif- 
ficulties also illustrates the dual relationship 
between Greek and Islamic philosophy: on 
the one hand, the first exerted an influence 
on the second, and on the other, there was 
a contradiction between their respective 
views of the universe. If Avicenna 
distinguishes between the possibility of ex- 
istence and essence (entity), it is because he 
attributes objects to the Supreme Being 
who, for him, is the first cause of all being. 
The existence of objects is not the same as 
Aristotle’s God seen as final cause and pure 
thought. But it represents science, will, 
power and life... The Supreme Being is the 
vital force in all beings. Everything that ex- 
ists or will exist is part of His knowledge. 
Since these differences in attitude on ex- 
istence and the meaning of causality led to 
the creation of new schools of philosophy, it 
is clear that Avicenna's philosophy and that 
of the Ancient Greeks differed not merely in 
detail, but rather on fundamental principles. 
Before Avicenna, al-Farabi had rated 
revelation and prophecy with wisdom. He 
had come to the conclusion that a prophet 
attains active wisdom through thought and 
that revelation is to be found in the associa- 
tion of active wisdom and thought. 
Avicenna more or less agrees with al- 
Farabi except that, for him, prophecy and 
the message rank above all else in the 
perfection of man. When he finds himself 
unable to expound a religious topic, he ad- 
mits his own imperfection and falls back on 
interpretation of the Koran or the Prophet. 
Since he is incapable of explaining the resur- 
rection of the body, he maintains that he 
follows the Prophet in this matter. And, like 
al-Farabi, he believes that the social order 
should conform to the religious order, and 
that the Prophet is the chief of the Medina. 
In all his philosophical writings Avicenna 
sought to achieve a synthesis between 
philosophy and mysticism, rationalism and 
spiritualism, After an encounter with the 
mystic Abu Said Abu Khevi, he is said to 
have stated: “All that Abu Said sees, | 
know.” And Abu Said answered: "All that 
Abu Ali (Avicenna) knows, | see.”

### 43007: How Ibn Sina became Avicenna: transmitted to Europe, his writings sparked off an intellectual revival

How Ibn Sina became Avicenna 
Transmitted to Europe, his writings sparked off an intellectual revival 
the thousandth anniversary of Avi- 
cenna’s birth (in the Christian calendar) 
without examining the debt Westerners owe 
to this great Oriental genius. 
The influence of Avicenna in the West was 
immense, giving birth to an intellectual move- 
ment, “Latin Avicennism’’, which bore his 
name. This influence made itself felt in three 
major areas: philosophy, the sciences 
(especially medicine), and literature. 
In philosophy, Avicenna dealt with all the 
branches of Aristotelian enquiry: logic, 
physics and psychology, metaphysics, 
ethics, economics and politics, philosophy 
and religion. He was also one of the great 
theorists of mysticism. 
In the sciences he influenced posterity in 
almost every field in which he worked. From 
medicine, mathematics, astronomy, alchemy 
and astrology, to geology and geography, 
mineralogy, herbalism, zoology and the 
natural sciences, there is hardly an area into 
which he ventured without whetting the 
curiosity of later scientists. 
Avicenna’s artistic sensitivity can be felt in 
his scientific and philosophical works, above 
all in his mystic treatises. He also authored 
several didactic poems on logic and medicine 
which found an echo in the work of later 
thinkers, including men of such stature as the 
Cordoban philosopher and scientist Averrogés 
(Ibn Rushd) {1126-1198}. 
Another accomplishment of Avicenna the 
artist and humanist was in music, where his 
writings would leave a mark on the work of 
later theoreticians. 
As for his influence in the Arab-speaking 
West, that is Muslim Spain or al-Andalus 
(Andalusia), it has to be admitted that An- 
dalusian thinkers, with very few exceptions 
and for reasons that remain obscure, were in- 
itially extemely hostile to Avicenna. 
We do not know exactly when Avicenna’s 
thought reached Muslim Andalusia, but the 
first person to be acquainted with it there was 
the great Spanish thinker Ibn -Hazm, who 
died in 1064 AD, and was more or less a con- 
temporary of Avicenna. Ibn Hazm never 
- travelled to the East, but according to the 
modern Spanish historian Asin Palacios, he 
studied the works of Oriental writers in the 
libraries of Andalusia. 
But convincing evidence: of Avicenna’s 
direct influence in Muslim Andalusia does not 
appear until the twelfth century with [bn 
Tufayl {d. 1185) whose familiarity with the 
I would be inconceivable to celebrate 
SALVADOR GOMEZ NOGALES, of Spain, is 
professor of Arabic metaphysics and philosophy 
at the philosophy faculty of Alcala de Henares 
and at Madrid's “Comiflas" University. He also 
directs the seminar on Arab philosophy at Spain’s 
Institute of Hispano-Arab Culture. Vice-President 
of the International Society for the Study of 
Medieval Philosophy and a member of the Aristo- 
telian Society (UK), he is the author of over a 
hundred scholarly publications.

by Salvador Gomez Nogales 
great thinker’'s work suggests that Avicenna 
was by then known to Andalusian scholars: 
Ibn Tufayl knew that Avicenna's Shifa 
(Book of Healing) was remarkable for its 
commentary on the works of Aristotle, and 
that Avicenna had written another original 
work {The Philosophy of the Easterners) in 
the tradition of the Neo-Platonists, in which 
he parted company with Aristotle. He was 
also aware that not everything in the Shifa 
originated with Aristotle. This is an impor- 
tant detail, not only because of the familiari- 
ty with Avicenna’s work which it presup- 
poses but because it explains why Averroés 
would later show hostility to Avicenna. 
Ibn Tufayl was also familiar with Avicen- 
na's treatises on mysticism, and it was in 
furtherance of this non-Aristotelian, esoteric 
aspect of the philosopher's work that Ibn 
Tufayl wrote the philosophical novel on 
which his reputation rests, The Self-Taught 
Philosopher. Both the novel's Arabic title, 
Hayy ibn Yagzan, and its two main 
characters, Absal and Salaman, are taken 
from Avicenna. 
And so the evidence tends to show that 
Andalusians were familiar with Avicenna's 
works by the middle of the twelfth century. 
The relations between Avicenna and 
Averroés fall into a category of their own. 
Divergences between the two far out- 
number the points on which they agree, and 
Averroés fiercely attacks Avicenna at every 
possible opportunity. 
There were two main 
Averroés’s aversion. The first of them, 
Photo ® Réunion des Musées Nationaux, Pans 
reasons for. 
  
then relatively common among Islamic 
philosophers, was the hostility he felt 
towards the Mutakallimun (theologians who 
philosophized about the articles of the 
Islamic faith) from whom, according to 
Averroés, Avicenna derived some of the 
proofs which made him break with Aristotle. 
The second reason, which may have ir- 
ritated Averroés even more because it seem- 
ed to be more fundamental, was that by 
blending certain  Neo-Platonist and 
Aristotelian theses Avicenna had 
adulterated Aristotelianism. Perhaps the 
most flagrant example of this is Avicenna’s 
espousal of the Neo-Platonist principle that 
the One can proceed only out of the One. 
When Averroés, concurring with the 
Islamic theologian and philosopher Al- 
Ghazali (1058-1111), refutes Avicenna’s 
proofs, the arguments he uses to defend 
philosophy are simple: Avicenna’s proofs 
are not those of Aristotle, nor do they derive 
from any of the classical philosophers. 
Hence it is Avicenna who is at fault and not 
philosophy, as Al-Ghazali had argued. Thus 
the thread running through Averroés’s 
philosophy, insofar as it constitutes a reply 
to Avicenna, is a return to pure 
Aristotelianism, eschewing the mystical 
adulterations which had been introduced by 
Al-Farabi (872-950) and by Avicenna 
himself. 
But in one field—medicine— Averroés 
does accept Avicenna’s superiority, and his 
admiration is evident in his commentaries. 
For just as Averroés is recognized as Avicen- 
na's equal or superior in philosophy, in

### 43007: How Ibn Sina became Avicenna: transmitted to Europe, his writings sparked off an intellectual revival

Between the 8th and the 15th 
century an Arab civilization 
took shape on the Iberian 
peninsula which had a far- 
reaching influence, above all in 
the Christian West. At times 
the confines of Muslim Spain 
{alk Andalus as it was known in 
Arabic} stretched over the 
greater part of the peninsula. 
For much of the period 
Cérdoba was the main centre 
of this blossoming culture: it 
grew to be the biggest city in 
the West, with a population of 
250,000; it boasted a university, 
a magnificent mosque (right, 
the ceiling of the antechamber 
to the mihrab, the room 
indicating the direction of 
Mecca}; its cultural and 
commercial life was intensely 
active. It was the birthplace of 
great writers and philosophers 
such as Ibn Tufayl, Averroés 
and Maimonides, who 
transmitted to Europe the 
learning which reached them 
from the Orient, including the 
scientific and philosophical 
writings of Avicenna. Apart 
from the Great Mosque of 
Cérdoba, al-Andalus produced 
other famous monuments such 
as the Alhambra of Granada, 
the Giralda and Alcazar of 
Seville, and the Aljaferia 
palace at Saragossa. Their 
influence on the Christian 
architecture of the Iberian 
peninsula and beyond was 
striking, and can be seen (below) 
in these arches in the cloister 
of San Juan de Duero, at Soria.

### 43007: How Ibn Sina became Avicenna: transmitted to Europe, his writings sparked off an intellectual revival

medicine it is acknowledged that Avicenna 
outranks him and that Avicenna’s influence 
on posterity was far greater. 
By the second half of the twelfth century, 
Avicenna's intellectual citizenship was so 
well established in Muslim Andalusia that it 
began to alarm the religious authorities. This 
concern is reflected in the couplets of the 
Valencian lbn Yubayr (1145-1217), who 
complained of the emergence of a sect 
whose intellectual leaders were Al-Farabi 
and Avicenna. Ibn Yubayr claimed that this 
sect was exlusively concerned with inanities 
and substituted the false wisdom of 
philosophy for the true wisdom of religion. 
As for Avicenna’s mystic doctrines, they 
reached Muslim Spain indirectly, through 
the work of Oriental mystics such as al- 
Ghazali and Suhrawardi, who were influenc- 
ed by him. But it has been established that 
his mystical works were read also at first 
hand by the Spanish Arabic-speaking 
philosophers as well as by the mystics such 
as Ibn Arabi of Murcia. 
This is the point at which to trace the 
spread of Avicenna’s work through the Latin 
West, noting especially how Spain acted as 
a bridge in this process. 
During the twelfth and thirteenth cen- 
turies, Spaniards produced many transla- 
  
tions from Arabic into Latin, and these were 
republished on a large scale during the fif- 
teenth and sixteenth centuries. European 
humanists and scientists formed such a high 
opinion of the achievements of Arabic 
science in Spain that many of them 
unhesitatingly classified as Spaniards cer- 
tain Oriental thinkers such as Avicenna, who 
had never set foot on Spanish soil. 
The modern historian of science George 
Sarton considers Muslim Spain to be the 
most important cultural centre of the Middle 
Ages. Indeed, fifteenth century Europeans 
were so dazzled by Andalusian culture that 
many of them believed that the brilliance 
came from Spain and not from the Orient. 
This widespread error was not new: the 
thirteenth-century Spanish bishop and 
chronicler Lucas de Tuy, for example, 
believed that Aristotle himself was Spanish. 
Many thought that all the names in the Latin 
translations were Spanish, and the Italians 
of that time transformed Avicenna into a 
Cordoban. It is interesting to note that the 
great thinker's name, Ibn Sina in Arabic, 
was immortalized in the West in the form 
which it assumed in Muslim Andalusia. 
The interest which the Arabs, and more 
specifically Avicenna, aroused in the West 
can be gauged from this flow of transla-

s 
tions. Specialists have underscored the ma- 
jor contribution of Spain to the translation 
movement, often referring to the School of 
Toledo. But important though it was, 
Toledo was not alone in producing the 
massive spate of translations. Translators 
from all over the Iberian peninsula, working 
alone or in groups, inundated the Western 
world with Latin and Hebrew versions of 
Arab texts, 
Spain was thus the main conduit through 
which Avicenna’s work flowed into Europe, 
at a moment, moreover, when his ideas 
came as a windfall for medieval pliilosophy. 
Scholasticism—the system of Western 
Christian philosophy that flourished from 
the eleventh to the fifteenth century — owed 
its renewal to two movements in whose for- 
mation Avicenna was a key figure: the 
transformation of Aristotelianism into a but- 
tress of religious thought, and the revival of 
Augustinianism through direct contact with 
Greek and Iranian Neo-Platonism, 
All medieval European philosophers were 
acquainted with Avicenna’s work: they 
either accepted his teachings or were engag- 
ed in refuting them. And even those who at- 
tempted to refute him assimilated at least 
some of the values which imbued his

### 43007: How Ibn Sina became Avicenna: transmitted to Europe, his writings sparked off an intellectual revival

Medieval authors not only drew on him, 
they made him one of the great authorities 
for their doctrines, probably invoking his 
name more often than that of any other 
thinker except for St. Augustine, Aristotle, 
Boethius and St. John of Damascus. So 
preponderant did his influence become that 
without him medieval philosophy would un- 
doubtedly have taken quite a different turn. 
Very few of Aristotle's works were known 
in the Latin West when the translations of 
Avicenna began to pour into Europe. The 
translations provided three things: a far 
more complete understanding of Aristotle 
than Christendom then possessed; a com- 
mentary on Aristotle's principal works; and 
a philosophic codification of Aristotelian 
problematics which offered a synthesis of 
philosophy and religion. 
The Arabs, and particularly Avicenna, 
directly influenced Scholasticism not as a 
variant of Greek Aristotelianism but by pro- 
viding original new perspectives. They exer- 
cised their influence not only on heterodox 
philosophers but on the orthodox outlook of 
the great Christian thinkers. So powerful 
was their impact that the English theologian 
and philosopher Roger Bacon (1214-1294) 
could present Avicenna as one of the line of 
the great prophets. 
—— 
The Aristotelian aspects of Avicenna’s in- 
fluence are felt most strongly in Thomism 
(the philosophico-theological system of St. 
Thomas Aquinas [1225-1274]}, in the 
thought of the British theologian Duns 
Scotus (1265-1308), and later in the work of 
the sixteenth-century Spanish theologian 
Francisco Suarez. This influence found its 
way into the Dominican school through the 
first original metaphysical synthesis of 
Thomas of York (d. 1260). But Avicenna's 
presence is most notable in the work of the 
two main Dominican architects of Thomism, 
St. Albertus Magnus {c. 1200-1280) and St. 
Thomas Aquinas, and in that of their great 
commentators, Tommaso de Vio, Cardinal 
Cajetan (1468-1534) and John of St. 
Thomas (15839-1644). In opposition to 
Thomism is the Aristotelianism of the Fran- 
ciscan school, under the aegis of Duns 
Scotus. It is interesting to note how both 
Thomas Aquinas and Duns Scotus support 
opposing doctrines by citing Avicenna. 
But it is mainly in the Augustinian tradi- 
tion that a Latin Avicennism comes to light. 
All of Avicenna’s illuminative wisdom blends 
perfectly with Augustinianism, giving it a 
badly needed systematic framework. 
Avicenna’s influence on philosophy is by 
no means confined to the Middle Ages. To

the extent that medieval Christian thought 
has a place in modern philosophy and 
theology, Avicennism still occupies the 
place assigned to it by history. 
There are two areas in which Avicenna’s 
thought still carries weight. First, his in- 
fluence is notable in modern subjectivism, 
from Descartes to Kant. It is equally evident 
in all the ontological proofs for the existence 
of God, from Henry of Ghent to our own 
times. Finally, in formal logic Avicenna was 
eight centuries ahead of the West. It was 
not until the Renaissance that arguments set 
forth by Avicenna reappear. 
This brings us to the second area in which 
Avicenna influenced the West, namely that 
of the sciences. 
When Westerners look to Spain in search 
of the splendours of Islamic culture, they are 
actually looking for the ‘new science’ of the 
Arabs, which Avicenna undoubtedly per- 
sonifies. He was deeply interested in 
mathematics, but as a philosopher rather 
than as a technician, in the manner of a late 
Neo-Platonist. He also produced many 
works on astronomy and astronomical 
observations. His astronomic teachings, 
along with those of Averroés, were ex- 
pounded at the Universities of Bologna, 
Padua and Ferrara.

Five heirs of Avicenna 
Avicenna occupies a central position in the history of 
European thought. It was through his interpretations and 
commentaries that the doctrines of the great thinkers of 
Greco-Latin Antiquity such as Aristotle, Plato, and Plotinus 
reached the thinkers of the medieval West. On this double 
page we show portraits of five of the medieval heirs” of the 
great Islamic philosopher: 1) the Englishman Roger Bacon 
(1214-1294), known to posterity as the doctor admirabilis, is 
depicted in this 19th-century engraving ; 2) his contemporary, 
the Scottish theologian John Duns Scotus, one of the 
founders of scholasticism; 4) the German Albertus Magnus 
{13th century) in a miniature by Tommaso di Modena, and his 
great pupil, the Italian theologian St. Thomas Aquinas (5) as 
shown in a 15th-century painting by Benozzo Gozzoli; 6) the 
English poet Geoffrey Chaucer {c. 1340-1400). Avicenna is 
mentioned as essential reading for a physician in Chaucer's 
Canterbury Tales. 3) Imaginary portrait by Goya of the 
Christian Father St. Augustine of Hippo (354-430). 
St. Augustine's idea of “interior illumination” was to inspire a 
current of medieval Christian thought which echoed some of 
the mystic doctrines of Avicenna.

The famous school of translation at Toledo was one of the centres of 
learning which brought Avicenna’s work to a wider audience. At Toledo 
the Canon was translated into Latin in the 12th century by the Italian 
Gerard of Cremona, aided, as the Catalan scholar Joan Carreras i Marti 
has pointed out, by Jewish and Muslim assistants. Parts of an early 
translation of the Canon into Catalan have survived in a 14th-century 
manuscript now in the Bibliothéque Nationale, Paris. Above, a page of 
the manuscript, which consists of the section of Book Four dealing 
with-fevers and a fragment of Book one.

as late as 1909. 
CONTINUED FROM PAGE 35 
In Avicenna’s time astronomy was related 
to astrology, a subject for which the Arab 
philosophers generally speaking showed lit- 
tle sympathy, and even less for the 
alchemical elements derived from it. Never- 
theless, the introduction of Arabic alchemy 
into the Latin world is an established 
historical fact, and Avicenna played a crucial 
role by imposing a more balanced attitude 
among European thinkers faced with the 
more fantastic and purportedly mystical 
tendencies of other, less objective and less 
responsible authors. He helped the West to 
preserve a. critical approach to the im- 
postures of alchemy. The second work on 
alchemy to be translated from Arabic to 
Latin was the relevant chapter of Avicenna’s 
Kitab, in the version produced by Alfred of 
Sareshel around the middle of the twelfth 
century, 
In the Latin version of his authentic 
treatise on alchemy and mineralogy, which 
was often mistaken for the appendix to the 
Fourth Book of Aristotle, he expounds a 
theory which the more thoughtful Latin 
authors would later take up. In this work, 
Avicenna condemns alchemy, especially 
where it concerns the transmutation of 
minerals, thus flying in the face of the most 
widely accepted notions of his time. He ad- 
mits only that skilled artisans working with 
special tinctures can obtain from other 
metals imitation gold and silver. But, in 
Avicenna’s view, the real transformation is 
impossible and cannot be defended either 
scientifically or philosophically. Avicenna's 
views were cited in nearly all the treatises of . 
the thirteenth century, and later, in the Latin 
world. The encyclopaedist Vincent de 
Beauvais (d. 1264), while admitting the 
possibility of transmutation, was sufficiently 
influenced by Avicenna to express certain 
reservations. 
it is, on the other hand, generally forgot- 
ten that Avicenna was one of the main 
sources of geological knowledge for the 
Latin Middle Ages, the principal work ‘of 
reference being the Kitab al-Shifa in the 
translation of Alfred of Sareshel. The 
general principles of geology as understood 
~ by the great encyclopaedists of the thir- . 
teenth century, notably Vincent de Beauvais 
and Albertus Magnus, are drawn principally 
from Avicenna. When they explain the mo- 
tions of the sea, erosion, and the origins of 
mountains, they are simply repeating 
Avicenna’s doctrines. Avicenna was prob- 
ably the Christian world’s richest source in 
herbalism and botany, as well. 
Turning to zoology, wa are confronted 
with this surprising statement by Sarton: 
“The real fountainhead of Aristotelian 
zoology, East and West, from the eleventh

century on was the Arabic summary of the 
nineteen books by Ibn Sina. In a sense we 
might even say that Ibn Sina was indirectly 
the main fountainhead of medieval 
zoology..." 
To conclude this discussion of the 
sciences, it should be pointed out that in its 
Latin translation Avicenna's encyclopaedia 
made many of the notions of Arab physics 
familiar in the West. Avicenna was one of 
those who transmitted to medieval physics 
the Arabs’ far-reaching studies of motion, 
contact, force, vacuums, the infinite, light, 
heat, the finite speed of light, and their in- 
vestigations of the specific gravity of bodies. 
The theory of gravity and the tables of den- 
sities of both liquids and solids entered 
Europe by way of the Arab world. 
Avicenna’s Canon was, for example, the 
main source used by the Florentine physi- 
cian Dino del Garbo (d. 1327) for his work 
On Weights and Measures, while Avicenna 
was one of the new authorities cited by 
Peter of Albano or Padua when he com- 
pleted his Liber compilationis de 
Physiognomia during his stay in Paris in 
1295. Avicenna, like Averroés, also influenc- 
ed the medieval theory of colours. 
But it is medicine that constitutes perhaps 
the most brilliant chapter of Avicenna’s life, 
and one that made him until relatively 
recently one of the great masters of Western 
thought. His undisputed sway in this 
discipline was based on two works, the 
Canon and the Aryuza, a diadactic poem on 
medicine (see article page 13). Still read to- 
day, the Canon was for seven centuries 
regarded in the West as an authoritative 
manual for instruction in and the practice of 
medicine. Between 1150 and 1187 it was 
translated in its entirety by Gerard of 
Cremona. It was subsequently translated no 
less than eighty-seven times, mostly into 
Latin but often into Hebrew. All of these 
translations were done in Spain, Italy (above 
all Sicily), and the South of France. 
It would be safe to say that Avicenna held 
undisputed authority as long as medicine 
was predominantly theoretical, and that his 
influence waned with the coming of ex- 
perimental science. 
The Canon gradually became the basis of 
medical instruction in all universities. It was 
part of the oldest recorded medical cur- 
riculum at the Faculty of Medicine in Mont- 
pellier, as established in a Bull of Clement V 
dated 1309, and remained a part of the 
Montpellier curriculum until 1557. True 
enough, ten years later, preference shifted 
to Galen, but Avicenna continued to be 
taught there until the seventeenth century. 
The fact that an Arabic edition of his work 
was brought out in Rome in 1593 is some in- 
dication of the regard in which he was held. 
At the outset, Arabic medicine was more 
theoretical than practical, and it may be that 
one of the shortcomings of Avicenna’s in- 
fluence was that his theoretical brilliance 
constituted an obstacle to practical research. 
But this does not alter the fact that in ex- 
perimental surgery he served as guide to a 
succession of brilliant practitioners. 
Thus Guglielmo Saliceti (c. 1210-1277), 
physician and surgeon of Piacenza, wrote a 
general treatise on medicine whose title, 
Summa conservationis et curationis, is 
reminiscent of Avicenna’s great en- 
cyclopaedic work. Avicenna is among the 
authors most frequently cited by him. 
Medieval treatises on medicine often con- 
tained an introduction to anatomy. All of 
them referred to and plagiarized the Canon 
which was considered as the supreme 
medical authority of the Christian world, just 
as it was in the world of Islam. 
In prophylaxis and pharmacology as well, 
Avicenna was the Europeans’ undisputed 
master. Cardo of Milan, who practised in the 
second half of the fourteenth century, wrote 
a work entitled A Regimen for the Plague, in 
which he summed up the prophylactic 
techniques then in use. One of his principal 
sources was Avicenna. At about the same 
time, Franchischino de Collignano, a Floren- 
tine physician, wrote a treatise on the plague 
in which he used Galen and Avicenna as his 
main authorities. Another treatise, De 
Venenis, is largely derived from Avicenna. 
Traces of Avicenna’s influence can also be 
found in medieval European ophthal- 
mology. In an anonymous treatise on this 
subject written in the second half of the thir- 
teenth century, Avicenna is the most fre- 
quently quoted author, and almost ali the 
ophthalmological works of fourteenth- 
century Europe rely heavily on Arab sources, 
and mainly on Avicenna. 
In obstetrics and gynaecology too Avicen- 
na stands out as one of the great masters of 
the Middle Ages. The highest praise that 
could be bestowed on a doctor in medieval 
times was to call him “another Avicenna’. In 
accordance with this practice, the Italian 
physician Gentile da Foligno was styled "the 
soul of Avicenna”. Consulted by Cino da 
Pistoia about the case of a seven-month 
child, he wrote a treatise citing a number of 
authoritative sources including Aristotle, 
who had cited an instance of an eleven- 
month baby, and Avicenna, who had 
discussed that of a fourteen-month child. Da 
Foligno also wrote a commentary on the 
chapter of Avicenna's Canon relating to 
fevers. 
Avicenna’s influence on Spanish authors 
of this era and on earlier medieval writers 
also extended to semiology or diagnosis 
through external symptoms such as obser- 
vation of the pulse. Sarton believes that 
Avicenna can be considered the founder of 
semiology. 
Finally, psychotherapy and para- 
psychology were another field in which 
Avicenna was ahead of his time. When 
medieval writers theorized about 
psychological methods of healing they 
illustrated their works with the most 
spectacular cures which he achieved. The 
Frenchman Nicole Oresme {(c. 1323-1382), 
one of the fourteenth century's greatest 
scientists, .went along with Avicenna in 
believing in thought transference, but re- 
jected his suggestion that human thought is 
capable of moving objects without physical 
contact. 
But there inevitably came a moment when 
Avicenna’s influence as the great authority 
in medicine went into decline. A reaction 
against him set in during the Renaissance, 
with the development of a tendency to go 
directly to the Greek sources instead of us- 
ing Arabic intermediaries. Leonardo da Vinci 
rejected Avicenna’s notions of anatomy 
(although the lack of an adequate 
vocabulary forced him to continue using 
Arabic terminology). The physician and 
alchemist Paracelsus {c. 1490-1541) burned 
the Canon in Basle in a public display of 
repudiation. The Englishman William Harvey 
dealt Avicenna's work a severe blow with 
the publication in 1628 of what he con- 
sidered to be his great discovery, the circula- 
tion of the blood, which was unknown to 
Avicenna. 
What Harvey did not know was that this 
discovery had been made four centuries 
before, even preceding the Spanish 
theologian Michael Servetus (15117-1553), 
by the Arab Ibn al-Naphis (1210-1288), who 
used Harvey's own argument concerning 
the thickness of the wall separating the ven- 
tricles of the heart, in a critical commentary 
on Avicenna's theory. 
Little by little, philosophic and theoretical 
medicine made way for the practical and ex- 
perimental medicine of modern times. Even 
so, the University of Brussels continued to 
offer a course on Avicenna’s medicine until 
1909. 
Today it is possible to study medicine 
without recourse to Avicenna's Arabic texts. 
It is impossible, on the other hand, to ignore 
the immense role of human thought, 
Eastern as well as Western, over the cen- 
turies, and to forget the great debt that 
European culture owes to Avicenna in 
philosophy, mysticism, the natural sciences 
and medicine,

### 43008: A Forerunner of modern science

A forerunner 
of modern science 
Sina), whose million-word encyclo- 
paedia the Canon of Medicine 
remained the supreme medical reference 
book for six centuries, can be considered 
the greatest physician of all peoples, places 
and times. Furthermore, his philosophical 
encyclopaedia, the Book of Healing, and his 
Book of Knowledge, a work written in Per- 
sian, place him among the world’s foremost 
thinkers. Indeed, so great is his renown as a 
philosopher and a physician that it has tend- 
ed to overshadow his contribution to the 
development of the natural sciences. 
Yet Avicenna worked intensively on 
physics, astronomy, mathematics and 
mineralogy, and put forward a number of 
productive ideas of great overall impact on 
the natural sciences of his times, and which 
remain topical even today. One such prob- 
lem, for instance, was that of movement 
and the measurement of movement. In this 
highly important branch of physics, he bas- 
ed his analysis on two concepts: the rapidity 
and slowness of movement. He viewed 
them quantitatively and qualitatively: “The 
quantity between the start of that which 
went before and the end of that which 
follows is the measure of the rapidity or 
slowness of movement”. 
“That which passes in a short time moves 
quickly”, he observed, and advanced the 
theory that speed depends on what in 
Bs all question, Avicenna (lbn 
Left, this fearsome panther head 
embellishes a bronze perfume phial 
dating from the 11th century. Found at 
Khulbuk in Tadzhikistan, the phial is 
22.4 centimetres in height. On one side 
is inscribed the name of the maker, Ali 
Ibn Abu Nasr, and on the other an Arab 
Ibn Abu Nasr, and on the other an Arab 
maxim: “The occasion brings forth the man”. 
by Abid S. Sadykov 
modern physics is termed ‘‘mass’’: “That 
which is smaller should move more quickly, 
and that which is larger more slowly; but in 
reality, we see the reverse”. 
Avicenna distinguished between the 
speed of light and of sound. “Thunder can 
be seen and heard”, he wrote. “Thunder 
{lightning} is seen at one time, but heard at 
another, after it (the sound) has moved in 
the air and gradually reached the hearing”. 
In other words, he established the difference 
in the speeds of the two forms of movement 
of matter. 
Avicenna was the first to formulate such 
concepts as the “quantity of movement”, 
“motive force” and “impulse”, which were 
propounded in the mechanics of Western 
Europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth 
centuries. He heads the long list of scien- 
tists— Descartes, Huyghens, Leibnitz, 
D’Alembert, Thomson, Kirchhoff and 
others —who worked on the problem of the 
measurement of movement, although no- 
one prior to Descartes, and subsequently 
Leibnitz, treated it on a genuinely scientific 
basis. Be that as it may, Avicenna's con- 
tribution should be noted in the recorded 
history of physics. 
To modern science, Avicenna's investiga- 
tion of the problem of the unity of space and 
time is far from irrelevant. “Movement has 
two quantities beside itself: one is the length 
of its path..., the other quantity... is called 
time". In other words, Avicenna sees space 
and time as the quantities of movement. 
Following Aristotle and a few later 
thinkers, he denied the existence of a void, 
advancing the theory that neither movement 
nor repose can exist in a void. He adduced 
that “in a void there can be neither natural 
nor forced movement or repose. Any body 
which is in a place either moves or is in a 
state of repose. Thus by this argument and 
by other proofs, it is established that bodies 
do not exist in a void”. 
Such ideas on the part of Avicenna to 
some extent laid the foundation for the law 
of inertia: the body is ‘in its place”, i.e. not 
influenced by an external force. His refuta- 
tion of the void — and the support it has lent 
this fertile scientific tradition —prepared the 
ground for the future recognition of many 
fields of physics, including gravity and 
electromagnetics. : 
He made interesting conjectures about 
the transmissiori of energy and light, 
“Bodies act upon each other in two man- 
ners,’’ he asserted, and defined those man- 
ners as: “by contact as when ice touches 
something, it cools it, or when wind con- 
tacts something, it moves it; in another 
manner, as when green grass leaves a green 
light on an adjacent wall, or when human . 
faces leave an imprint in the observer's eyes 
or in the mirror", 
Extrapolating his views to the field of 
“cosmic” phenomena, he asserted —as had 
previously Aristotle and his disciples —that 
many empirically observed phenomena are 
connected with, for instance, the influence 
of the Moon. He wrote: “The light and 
forces emanating from the Sun and other 
luminaries influence our world, Among the 
most obvious influences of the heaven and 
the Moon is that the Moon... causes the sea 
tides to flow’". 
In correspondence with al-Biruni, Avicen- 
na advanced his own version of the principle 
of the conservation of movement, 
postulating that both presently and poten- 
tially, a sphere was neither light nor heavy.

“Islamic science came into being from a wedding between the 
spirit that issued from the Koranic revelation and the existing 
sciences of various civilizations which Islam inherited and which it 
transmuted through its spiritual power into a new substance, at 
once different from and continuous with what had existed before it. 
The international and cosmopolitan nature of Islamic civilization, 
derived from the universal character of the Islamic revelation and 
reflected in the geographical spread of the Islamic world, enabled it 
to create the first science of a truly international nature in human 
history. 
“Islam became heir to the intellectual heritage of all the major 
civilizations before it save that of the Far East, and it became a 
haven within which various intellectual traditions found a new lease 
upon life, albeit transformed within a new spiritual universe. This 
point must be repeated, particularly since so many people in the 
West wrongly believe that Islam acted simply as a bridge over 
which ideas of Antiquity passed to medieval Europe. As a matter of 
fact nothing could be further from the truth, for no idea, theory or 
doctrine entered the citadel of Islamic thought unless it first 
became Muslimized and integrated into the total world view of 
m."”

### 43008: A Forerunner of modern science

CONTINUED FROM PAGE 41 
“The proof is,” he wrote, “that either the 
potentially light and potentially heavy are 
such in their whole, as is seen in the case of 
the particles of elements, which remain mo- 
tionless in their natural places... or (they) are 
such in their parts and not in their whole, as 
we may see in combinations of elements, 
which are neither light nor heavy since, if 
some combinations of the elements move 
upwards, then the other half of them must 
move downwards”. This theory may be said 
to approximate to a grasp of the principle of 
the conservation of movement, which was 
further developed by Galileo, and sub- 
sequently, by Descartes and Newton. 
Avicenna’s thinking on anthropogeny, 
which encapsulates the most advanced 
ideas of his time, is of unquestionable in- 
terest, For instance, he put forward the 
theory that man’s origins lie in an animal 
species. He wrote that until a species "has 
acquired all the senses that are capable of 
apprehending the things perceptible to the 
senses, neither can nature, of necessity, 
transform it from an animal to a rational 
species’’. Of course, this theory is still well 
behind that of Darwin, but it may 
nonetheless be viewed as a kind of 
hypothesis which no one prior to Darwin 
was able to turn into a genuinely scientific 
theory. 
Avicenna’s creative approach to some 
problems of physics and mechanics is 
shown in the Kitab al-Shifa (Book of Heal- 
ing) and the Danish-Nameh (Book of 
Knowledge), and also in separate treatises 
and in correspondence with al-Biruni. 
Defending the theory of the “motive force” 
put forward by the sixth century Alexan- 
drian philosopher ‘John Philoponus, and 
considering the problem of the relationship 
between “forced” and “natural” move- 
ment, Avicenna propounded his own theory 
of the mechanics of movement. The gist of 
it is that "a kind of incorporeal kinetic force” 
or dimension—to some extent the 
equivalent either of impulse or of kinetic 
energy —is imparted to the moving body. In 
Western European science, this incorporeal 
dimension was later termed “impetus”. 
Avicenna’s theory exerted considerable in- 
fluence on the views of many scientists, 
Eastern and Western, and lies at the origin 
of the theory of impetus finalized in the four- 
teenth century by the French philosopher 
Jean Buridan. 
In his treatise The Measure of Wisdom, 
Avicenna described a number of simple 
machines and mechanisms for lifting. and 
moving loads, and also several complex 
mechanisms consisting of pulleys, 
windlasses, levers and screws. Not content 
with describing the mechanisms known in 
his times, he suggested a few new combina- 
tions which we do not find in his 
predecessors’ works, even in those of the 
ancient Greek scholar Heron of Alexandria, 
who illustrated the main achievements of 
antiquity in applied mechanics. The prin- 
ciples Avicenna described were the basis of 
various devices used throughout Central 
Asia for raising water or processing oll, 
grains or cotton. 
Neither can his contribution to the 
development of geometry and pure 
mathematics be overlooked. In his commen- 
tary on Euclid’s Elements, for instance, he 
attempted to improve the structure of the 
latter's axioms in order to provide a 
theoretical foundation for geometry. In 
44 
arithmetic, he introduced the Indian method 
of testing the simplest functions by using 
the number 9, and generalized its use for 
finding the cubes of numbers. In this field as 
in many others he helped to promote the 
development of abstract thought in the 
Islamic countries. 
Avicenna also wrote works on astronomy. 
His Message to Zarrin Gis, daughter of 
Qabus Ibn Washmagir, the ruler of Gorgan, is 
lost to us, but al-Biruni was acquainted with 
the Message and analysed it in his Geodesy. 
To us, the value of this work is that it con- 
tained Avicenna’s radically new method of 
determining the difference in the 
geographical longitudes of two localities. Its 
gist is as follows: the culmination of the 
moon is observed at the meridian of a locali- 
ty of which the longitude is unknown. Then 
the position of the moon is calculated using 
tables compiled for a locality whose 
longitude is known. The difference between 
the calculated and observed positions of the 
moon is translated into the difference in 
local times at the two localities, and that will 
be the difference in their geographical 
longitudes. Avicenna formulated this 
method in Gorgan between the years 1012 
and 1014. Exactly five hundred years later, in 
1514, the method was rediscovered in 
Europe by the astronomer Johannes Werner 
(1468-1528). 
In Isfahan, where his fates took him, 
Avicenna built an observatory and, using in- 
struments he himself invented, made con- 
tinuous observations of the luminaries over 
a period of several years. The result was his 
ephemerides, or tables showing the daily 
positions of the planets in relation to the 
ecliptic. His calculations have proved more 
accurate than those of the ancients. He was 
among the first medieval astronomers to 
prove that the sun's apogee is not fixed. He 
invented a special instrument combining 
several large rulers set in elevation, which he 
used to determine the altitude and azimuth 
of the luminary. To refine his 
measurements, he used an original method 
which subsequently became known as 
Nonius’ method, after the Portuguese 
scholar Pedro Nunhes, or Nonius, who 
rediscovered this method in the sixteenth 
century. 
Avicenna had no special knowledge of 
chemistry, although he undoubtedly knew 
of some chemical reactions from mixing 
compound medicines, for instance, where in 
some cases the number of components was 
as high as thirty or forty. However, he un- 
doubtedly sponsored the development of 
that science by his uncompromising critique 
of alchemy. Here is what he wrote in the 
Book of Healing on that score: “Alchemy is 
far behind nature, and cannot catch up with 
it, although it endeavours to do so. As 
regards the pretensions of alchemists, then 
they can produce no genuine change of 
species. They can perform good imitations, 
painting red metal white so that it resembles 
silver, or yellow so that it resembles 
gold...But the substance of those metals re- 
mains unchanged thereby...” 
In his pursuit of science, Avicenna attach- 
ed enormous importance to water — omnific, 
dissolvent, uniting and destructive, In some 
cases, he saw the solution of substances in 
water as transformation. He gave special 
preference to mineral waters, because of the 
metals dissolved in them: if mineral waters 
contained salts, gold and silver, then they 
-metals was quite advanced. 
were beneficent to the human organism. Of 
all waters, he considered the best, because 
of its solvent qualities, to be “purified” 
water, which could be obtained from or- 
dinary water, and he proposed a very 
original technique for obtaining a kind of 
distilled water: a layer of wadding is placed 
over a cauldron of boiling water, and from 
time to time it is removed and wrung out... 
On metals too, Avicenna’s views were his 
own, and he placed special emphasis on 
mercury. From the ninth to eleventh cen- 
turies, this metal was extensively used in 
Central Asia: according to available informa- 
tion, several hundreds of metric tons of mer- - 
cury were then extracted there. 
At the same time, the mining of other 
Like his 
predecessors and contemporaries, Avicenna 
viewed gold, for example, as the most 
perfect of substances, the sovereign 
mineral, He also recommended the salts of 
some heavy metals for external use. The 
techniques for making sublimates of mer- 
cury were known to Avicenna’s contem- 
poraries. The physical and chemical proper- 
ties of sublimate were also known, and it 
was recommended for treatment of external 
complaints. Gold and silver were deemed 
excellent medicaments for strengthening the 
heart and cleansing the blood. In addition, 
he described the use of finely-ground glass, 
salts, antimony, iron, lead and blue vitriol for 
treating diseases of the eye and some other 
organs. 
Avicenna postulated that various 
substances interact together, forming a mix- 
ture in which one of the components 
predominates. A simple substance, he 
thought, could not produce other 
substances. In these views, an embryo of in- 
organic chemistry is not hard to detect. 
Where Avicenna’s contribution to 
mineralogy and geology is concerned, pride 
of place must go to the classification of 
minerals he proposed, with its very rational 
division into four groups: stones, ores, fuels 
and salts. That division was taken over in its 
entirety by European mineralogy as of the 
late Middle Ages; it was maintained in the 
Renaissance, and virtually until the nine- 
teenth century. Even the first classification 
of minerals by chemical composition, which 
was proposed by Torbern Olaf Bergman of 
Sweden in 1780, sub-divided all minerals in- 
to Sales (salts), Terrae (earth and stones), 
Bitumine {hydrocarbons} and Metalla 
{metals): an exact repetition of Avicenna's 
system. To commemorate his services to 
mineralogy, one of the thallic minerals 
discovered in the Uzbek SSR has been nam- 
ed avicennite. 
Finally, it may be mentioned that Avicen- 
na thought the erosive effects of wind and 
water to be one of the factors in the forma- 
tion of valleys and ravines. Considering the . 
fossilized sea creatures known at the time, 
he said that the lands where they had been 
found had formerly been sea-beds. He ex- 
plained correctly that earthquakes were due 
to deep-seated geological processes. 
“If | see somewhat further than 
Descartes, that is because | am standing on 
his shoulders”, declared Newton. And if 
modern science has advanced so far since 
Avicenna’s day, then that is only because it 
has “stood on the shoulders’ of many 
. pioneers, including, of course, those of 
Avicenna himself.

### 43009: The Secret of the stars

The secret of the stars 
by Ahmed Siiheyl Unver 
was known only by the name of 
Giyaseddin, wondered why stars are 
visible at night and not during the day. 
Some of the learned men of the time offered 
him the explanation that during the daytime 
the more intense sunlight overshadowed the 
light cast by the stars, whereas at night, 
after the setting of the sun, stars once more 
became visible. This answer was then com- 
pared by the ruler with another explanation 
given by a smaller group of learned men. Ac- 
cording to their answer to Giyaseddin’s in- 
quiry, the intensity of starlight is diminished 
during the daytime; because of this, light 
cannot penetrate into the depths of heaven. 
Giyaseddin, the ruler, who viewed these 
answers critically, asked of Avicenna: "How 
can sunlight vanish from the semi-spherical 
heaven? That sunlight can be completely 
screened from heaven at any time of the day 
is not possible since it is known that the 
world which comes in between the sun and 
the semi-spherical heaven is not so large as 
the sun itself. The world can prevent the 
sun’s rays from falling on a part of heaven 
I the 11th century a Turkish ruler who 
AHMED SUHEIL UNVER, of Turkey, is a mem- 
ber of the Turkish Historical Institute and a former 
professor at the Faculty of Medicine and the Aca- 
demy of Fine Arts at Istanbul, The founder of the 
Istanbul Institute of Medicine, he has published a 
number of studies on Avicenna as well as works 
on Turkish miniatures, calligraphy and painting. 
that is equal only to its own size. But since 
the sun is many times larger than the world, 
the part of heaven that is screened from the 
sun's rays at any time will be very small in 
relation to the world and even much smaller 
in relation to the sun.” 
Avicenna, too, was not convinced of the 
validity of the explanation offered by his col- 
leagues. Indeed, no one ventured further in 
solving this important problem than the ex- 
planations cited above. 
Avicenna offered the following explana- 
tion: it is true that at night the sun's rays are 
transmitted to this end of Space. Space, like 
air is transparent. Transparent substances 
possess two important properties: one is 
that they are not luminous but transmit 
light; they are not brightened themselves. 
The second property is that they do not 
obstruct the path of vision. During the day 
the sun which is above the horizon brightens 
the foreign components in air, such as dust 
and vapour. These components, which of 
themselves are not transparent appear 
bright on account of light rays falling on 
them from other sources. Thus during the 
daytime our surroundings appear bright and 
the stars become invisible. This is easily 
proved when at night the visibility of stars in 
the light of a flame becomes diminished. 
By this explanation, it becomes evident 
that Avicenna has satisfactorily attributed 
the solution of the present problem to the 
effect of the diffusion of light. | 
0 Vault of Heaven, 0 Firmament, 
In the name of the Creator, tel me, 
Do you spin above us by your own design? 
Or are you by another's power constrained 
To eternal movement? 
For mortal man you are infinity; 
Perplexed we wonder within what frame 
Your revolutions are set. Can it be 
That for you a greater Infinite exists? 
Are you the haven to which souls return? 
Or do they perish with owr mertal coil? 
The Sun that you up-hold 
Shoots out its rays 
As though from the feathers 
Of a great bird's wing. 
But the Milky Way! 
Is it a blow in the ocean of the sky? 
Or is it the image of a sword 
Reflected in a burnished Ireastplate? 
The crescent Moon? Is it a pendant 
On the necklace of the Stars 
Shining through the night obscure? 
Or is it a bracelet on an unknown hand? 
The Stars? Are they encrusted pearls? 
Or foaming bubbles crowning mighty waves 
Whose weaving patterns by the night revealed 
Like some great sail, when daylight comes, 
Are folded carefully away?

Amadou-Mahtar M’ Bow 
Re-elected | 
Mr. Amadou-Mahtar M’'Bow, of Senegal, 
has been re-elected Director-General of 
Unesco by the Organization's General Con- 
ference being held in Belgrade from 23 
September to 28 October. Mr, M'Bow, who 
was elected Director-General in 1974, was 
unanimously re-elected by the General Con- 
ference and will serve for a seven-year term, 
An Apostle 
of Scientific Progress 
Two years ago, Unesco's General Con- 
ference proposed that, on the thousandth 
anniversary of the birth of Ibn Sina (Avicen- 
na) according to the Christian calendar, 
Unesco should pay tribute to this great 
thinker (980-1037 AD; 370-428 of the 
Hegira} and to the immense influence his 
work has had on the development of science. 
The anniversary has been celebrated this 
year at international conferences and sym- 
posia, including three in the USSR, (at 
Moscow, Tashkent and Dushanbe) which 
have focussed on Avicenna’s major con- 
tributions to physics, logic, sociology and 
literature, as well as to the exact and natural 
sciences and to medicine. Speakers also 
drew attention to Avicenna’s distinguished 
role in encouraging, through scientific 
knowledge, the efforts of the human com- 
munity to build a better world in which 
scientific development can flourish. At the 
, Moscow meeting, Prof. Pyotr Feodosev, 
Vice-President of the Soviet Academy of 
Sciences, made the point that Avicenna saw 
his work as pre-eminently the fruit of com- 
munication between peoples. 
"Avicenna could only conceive of man as 
part of a situation, as existing within the 
framework of society,” Prof. Feodosev said. 
’Qutside the human community, he felt, the 
capacities of the individual could not achieve 
fulfilment, since man is a social creature. 
Happiness is impossible, Avicenna wrote, if 
a man does not forge links with others.” 
Mr. Amadou-Mahtar M'Bow, the Director- 
General of Unesco, returned to this idea in 
his address: : 
Avicenna, perhaps more than any other 
thinker of the great age in which he lived, 
proved a fundamental truth which is also, in 
a sense, the reason why Unesco exists: 
- civilizations only have a. future insofar as 
they communicate with each other, enrich 
each other with their mutual contributions, 
and recreate together, through their diver- 
sity, the unity of our destiny.” 
Unesco Medal Honours 
Avicenna 
Unesco has issued a medal to commemorate 
the thousandth anniversary of Avicenna’s 
birth. On the obverse side of the medal, 
designed by sculptor-medallist Victor 
Douek, is a scene inspired by a miniature in a 
17th-century Turkish manuscript, and the 
inscription "AVICENNAE 980-1037" 
"UNESCO 1980” (see photo page 4). 
Reproduced on the reverse side is a phrase 
(in Arabic and Latin) by Avicenna which 
means ""Co-operate for the well-being of the 
body and the survival of the human 
species’’, as well as the autograph attributed 
to Avicenna which appears on our cover. 
The Avicenna medal forms part of the “An- 
niversaries of Great Men'’ series launched by 
. Unesco in 1975, which now includes medals 
struck in honour of Michelangelo, Rubens, 
Aristotle and Einstein. For further informa- 
tion about the medals, available in gold, 
silver and bronze, please contact Unesco’s 
Philatelic and Numismatic Programme.

‘Prince and chief of physicians’ 
Ibn Sina, known in the Western world as Avicanna, author of the Canon of Medicine, an encyclopaadic treatise 
which remained the supreme medical reference source for six centuries, has rightly been dubbed “the prince 
and chief of physicians”. But more than this, he is one of the handful of universal geniuses who have taken all 
knowledge for their province, Philosopher, scientist and poet as well as physician, Avicenna found time to 
design his own surgical instruments, many of which are virtually the same as those used today. Below, four ins- 
truments made recently in Uzbekistan from descriptions and sketches drawn by Avicenna himself nearly a thou- 
sand years ago. From left to right: Surgical scissors with sharply pointed blade tips for use in eye surgery; twee- 
zers for removing foreign bodies; a lancet; and a scalpel for removing fragments of skull bone during trepanning 
operations.
