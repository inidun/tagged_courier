which are in fact big stones that stop their 
abode from blowing away on days when 
the wind is strong. With his feet on the 
waterlogged ground and head down,eight- 
year-old Toky tells his story. 
“This reminds me of my first night in 
Tana. We'd just arrived—my father and 
mother, my three brothers and sisters and 
me—when it started pouring. We slept on 
the ground, under a shopfront awning with 
other poor people. The next morning, my 
little sister complained that people had 
been groping her all night. Since then, my 
family has preferred to live in a cabin like 
ours, near the route-taxi station where my 
father sells maize pancakes 
“But I stay here because it’s close to the 
market. Before we came to Tana, we lived 
near Anjozorobe, in the north, where my 
father worked in the paddy fields. He gave 
half of the harvest to the owner,even though 
he was the one who paid for the seedlings, fer- 
tilizer and pesticides. One day, the owner 
asked for two-thirds instead of half. That’s 
when my father decided to leave for Tana.” 
T he other boy, Rado, has never lived in the

countryside. “When I was little, we lived in one 
room with electricity,” he said. “But my father 
drank and didn’t pay the rent. One day, we 
were thrown out onto the street.” 
When dawn breaks, the two boys crawl 
out of the now-shapeless box.T hey will have 
to find somewhere else to sleep before night 
falls again. But this isn’t the time to be loo- 
king. T he market is starting up and the first 
trucks are arriving with goods to sell. The 
boys have to rush off and set up stalls for five 
traders who employ them. With the pittance 
they earn doing that, they can buy a meagre 
breakfast at a corner stand—some tea (in 
fact, hot water with sugar in it) and two rice 
pancakes. When business is good, they treat 
themselves to a cup of coffee with milk. 
After that, Rado and Toky make for the 
main entrance of the market, where they 
mingle with a crowd of other children, all 
waiting for the arrival of well-off ladies in 
cars whose purchases they will offer to carry 
for a small fee. Rado knows the tricks of the 
trade. You have to avoid the talkative ones, who 
spend hours nattering to the shopkeepers, 
and the tight-fisted ones, who are always hag-

with a handicap or carrying a baby are more 
likely to get attention. 
For the youngest children,left,begging is the 
only means of survival. 
Far left below, teenagers on the street have their 
own children who are left to fend for themselves 
during the day, when their parents go to work. 
Below, playing a game of hide and seek in a skip. 
  
» Rado used to look after cars parked near 
the market, which was less tiring and better 
paid. But older children have seized control 
of that and chase off any younger ones who 
try to edge their way in. Rado also knows 
there are two things he will never do again— 
rummaging in garbage cans and begging. 
“The garbage boys” are looked down on as 
idle and dirty by the other boay kely, as 
Madagascar’s street children are called. Rado 
is 12 years old and because he is in good 
health, no one takes pity on him any more. 
Like all the capital’s boay kely—which 
the NGO Médecins sans Frontieres (Doc- 
tors Without Borders) estimated in 1997 to 
number 3,500 out of the city’s one million 
inhabitants—Rado’s worst fear is of crack- 
downs by city officials. T he last one dates 
back to the summer of 1997, when there 
was a clean-up before the Jeux de la Fran- 
cophonie, an international sporting event 
bringing together countries that use French 
as a common language. Shacks were torn 
down and the street children were taken 
off and dumped in a reception centre 50 km 
   PEOPLE AND PLACES 
outside the city. But they all ran away 
because the rules and the staff were too 
strict. The children walked back to the 
capital, living off petty thieving along the 
way. After the Games ended, they were 
back at the market again. 
Disease is another threat to street chil- 
dren. The oldest ones remember typhus. 
But not Rado. He survived the bubonic 
plague epidemic which occurred in 1997- 
98.The disease first broke out in a slum just 
below the market and then gradually spread 
among the street children. Some of them 
watched as the fatal swellings twisted their 
arms. The health authorities responded by 
knocking down all the shacks and dousing 
the area with clouds of chemicals. Many of 
the children died. Rado was shocked by 
what survivors told him when they returned 
from hospital—that the nurses and women 
attendants had balked at treating the sick 
children, who were dirty and smelly and not 
in a position to give them a tip. 
Are the boay kely condemned to spend 
all their lives on the streets? Probably. The » 
A lost generation 
f there is one country where the term “lost 
generation” means something, it's Madagascar. 
The 45% of its 14 million inhabitants who are 
under 15 will confirm that. Snce the time they 
were born, the economy of their island, in the 
Indian Ocean off the coast of Mozambique, has 
steadily deteriorated. 
Between 1980 and 1995, per capita income 
shrank by an average 3% every year, according to 
UN figures. Daily calorie intake per person has 
fallen by 22% since 1970 and 34% of children 
under five are malnourished. A recent study by 
the country’s national statistics institute, Instat, 
showed that nearly half the infantsbelow the age 
of three suffer from retarded growth— the highest 
proportion in Africa— and that one child in six 
dies before reaching the age of five. 
Education figures for the island— which,at 
592,000 sq km, is the fourth largest in the world— 
are just as gloomy. School attendance between the 
ages of 6 and 23 nearly halved, from 60% to 
33%), between 1970 and 1995, and nearly three- 
quarters of all schoolchildren fail to complete 
primary school. 
Today, 72% of the Malagasy live on lessthan 
a dollar a day, despite the fact that their land 
has abundant agricultural and mineral resources. 
The island also has tremendous tourist poten- 
tial.In 1997 the country’s foreign debt reached 
$4.4 billion— 120% of gross domestic product 
(GDP). This disastrous economic situation is the 
result of several decades of political turmoil and 
administrative disorder. 
Things have been a shade better since 1997, 
when the economic growth rate (3.7%) topped 
population growth (2.8%) for thefirst time in many 
years. The upturn was maintained last year. Many 
credit the improvement to the rapid switch to a 
market economy and a democratic system after a 
long period of “ true socialism” . But in Madagascar, 
as elsew here in sub-Saharan Africa, the remedy of 
liberalism may not be enough to roll back poverty.

child labour try to change their lives by 
sending them to school. But the children 
often rebel. How can they do “homework”

around among the boys at the market— 
pictures of well-fed youngsters posing with 
a grin in front of some place like the Eiffel 
Tower. Rado has no chance of that happe- 
ning because he’s older than eight, the

### 116244: Cities, citizens, and civilization

Cities, citizens 
and civilization 
In 1995, UNESco created a Cities for Peace Prize to pay tribute to city governments 
which have succeeded in “strengthening social solidarity, improving living conditions 
in troubled neighbourhoods and developing genuine urban harmony” .Every two years, 
five cities,each from a different world region, are thus recognized. 
The governance of cities has become a vital issue of our time and UNESCO’s Management 
of Social Transformation (MOST) programme, launched in 1994, includes studies of change 
in urban settings which are reported back to city officials. UNESCO believes that cities, and 
especially mega-cities,are the laboratory of a new age where the future of humanity will 
be decided. 
Most of the world’s population will be concentrated in cities by the beginning of the 
next century, and the percentage of people living in urban areas will have just about 
doubled between 1950 and 2015. The numbers of city-dwellers will have increased 
fivefold over the same period,and the number of people living in cities of over a million 
will have grown more than eightfold. This dizzying rate of urbanization, which is going on 
as headlong as ever in most poor countries, upsets the natural equilibrium and the checks 
Federico M ayor and balances which have always operated up until now. 
Cities consume enormous amounts of energy, exhaust water supplies, and devour food 
and materials. In exchange,they pour out sewage and pollution.Their physical environ- 
ment is worn out because it can no longer provide the input or absorb the output. And city 
governments are exhausted by trying—when they see fit and when they are able—to respond 
to the basic needs of citizens by providing such things as housing, running water,sewers, 
lighting and proper roads. They often prove just as powerless—or indifferent—to use for 
the benefit of the whole community the surplus energy and problem-solving ingenuity which 
citizens have. Yet this tremendous vitality is the basis of the dynamic development of so many 
cities today. 
 
The words city, citizens and civilization have the same root. A citizen was 
originally a person who had the right to live in a city and who, by exercising 
rights and fulfilling duties like every other citizen, helped build a civilization. 
Between pressure from below and paralysis at the top, the city has become a micro- 
cosm of the future of our civilization. It is in cities where lies the greatest danger of a shat- 
tered society where people think only of themselves. Unless we create links between all its 
inhabitants, the unity of a city bursts apart. It breaks up into countless groups which develop 
along the lines of class, race,culture and religion.Such ghettos cannot come together to 
form a genuine whole. On the contrary, the way they close off from each other, sometimes 
involving physically defending themselves against other parts of the city, creates a kind of 
urban apartheid. 
The words city, citizens and civilization have the same root. A citizen was originally a 
person who had the right to live in a city and who, by exercising rights and fulfilling duties 
like every other citizen, helped build a civilization. T his means that the humanization of 
cities is crucial for the future of all of us. And it is not an impossible dream. There are plenty 
of examples,in the North, SouthEast and West,where it has taken shape. 
But the price is the creation of a city administration in which people can play a full part 
and which is based on a revival of true citizenship. Only in this way will the city serve its 
inhabitants by using the creative capacities of everyone—men and women, young and old, 
rich and poor. [|

### 116245: Space law lifts off for a new odyssey

Jace law lifts off 
for a new odyssey 
As commercial interests and international partnerships dovetail in space exploration and use, 
space law will have to be rewritten to cut a way through an increasingly dense legal thicket 
Send up a satellite, haul an asteroid onto 
it and ship it to the earth . ... This may 
sound like science fiction, but it’s on the 
agenda of an American industrialist bent on 
being the world’s first proud owner of a celes- 
tial body. What's to stop him, apart from the 
cost? How do things stand legally, for 
example? According to international space 
law, no one can lay claim to a celestial body. 
But if he manages to get his asteroid down to 
earth, it will have ceased to be a heavenly 
body and space law won’t apply. 
As technological development opens up 
commercial possibilities in space, a Pando- 
ra’s box of legal questions is ready to burst 
open. There is, for example, no legal defini- 
tion of where airspace ends and outer space 
A spacewalking astronaut floats in an 
environment increasingly polluted with debris 
from rockets and satellites.

begins. So while an aircraft registered in one 
country needs permission to fly through 
another country’s airspace, the situation 
would be less clear for a microwave-powered 
reconnaissance device which is being deve- 
loped to fly about 30 kilometres overhead and 
is neither a satellite nor an aircraft. 
Issues like this will take centre stage at 
the upcoming T hird United Nations Confe- 
rence on the Exploration and Peaceful U ses 
of Outer Space (UNISPACE), which will be 
held in Vienna,Austria, in July. Represen- 
tatives from 185 states as well as industrial 
leaders in the field will be attending the 
conference, the most important interna- 
tional meeting on space affairs held this 
decade.T he decisions arising from UNIS- 
PACE will shape the way we envision and 
use outer space. T hree major issues in par- 
ticular will dominate the legal discussions:

space, debris, the commercialization of 
space,and intellectual property. 
“Environmental protection” has a special 
meaning in space. A bolt or a nail travelling 
faster than a bullet at 75,000 kilometres an 
hour can seriously damage an expensive tele- 
communications satellite. An estimated two 
million kilos of junk are already in orbit, with 
about 110,000 objects between one and 10 
centimetres and another 8,500 fragments 
even bigger. And these numbers are expected 
to grow exponentially. In 10 years’ time 1,000 
satellites will be orbiting the earth, up from 
600 circulating today. 
An orbiting junkyard 
Yet the space debris problem may prove 
relatively easy to resolve because it directly 
concerns major powers with the biggest 
investments in space hardware like the 
U.S., Russia and France. “We've already 
had at least one major accident, when a 
piece of debris hit the French satellite, 
Cerise,” says Dr. Kai-Uwe Schrogl, a lawyer 
with the German Aerospace Centre. The 
accident didn’t cause too much of a legal 
ruckus, though, because the “guilty” frag- 
ment was originally from a French launcher. 
“But just imagine if that debris had come 
from a Russian or Chinese launcher.” 
While there is some mention of environ- 
mental protection in two of the three UN 
conventions governing space activities (see 
box page 13), there are no binding rules desi- 
gned to limit debris. “The United States 
doesn’t want anything resembling interna- 
tional regulations,” says Schrogl, but many 
other countries are pushing for a UN agree- 
ment on the issue. Ironically, the U.S. is the 
only country with national regulations concer- 
ning space junk and, says Shrogl, the U.S. 
government is now in the process of streng- 
thening these laws which are expensive to 
implement. It costs much more to build a 
satellite that doesn’t shed its spent rocket 
boosters than one that does. “When cheaper, 
more polluting launchers developed by other

mission. 
says. “The United States would prefer to see 
regulations set in a non-governmental forum 
where they can do what they like. But theyll 
eventually be forced to go to the United 
Nations.” 
The issue of liability is highlighting a 
major gap in existing international space 
law. All the major agreements in this field 
were negotiated during the Cold War, when 
states were the sole actors in space. Today, 
private companies are increasingly involved 
in the construction, launch and operation of 
space objects. Yet there is no formal licen- 
sing system.As Shrogl describes the situa- 
tion,it’s as if countries have failed to set up 
a driving licence system for space traffic, the- 
reby setting the stage for international col- 
lisions. 
Consider the case of the new Sea Launch 
Company which is launching satellites from 
the high seas beyond the bounds of national 
jurisdiction and therefore beyond the control 
of governments. T he consortium is registered 
in the Cayman Islands and consists of four 
partners: Norwegians, Russians, Ukrai- 
nians—each owning about 20 per cent— 
and the American company Boeing, which 
owns 40 per cent. Complicating matters 
further, the ship and platform used for the 
launches are registered in Liberia. What if a 
failed launch accidentally drops a rocket on 
a fifth country? Which government will be 
held responsible for ensuring that the com- 
pany pays the damages? 
A condominium in space 
In the case of Sea Launch, the United 
States unilaterally decided to assume res- 
ponsibility for political and economic rea- 
sons, says Dr. Frans von der Dunk, co- 
director of the International Institute of Air 
and Space Law at the University of Leiden, 
in the Netherlands. “If Boeing was allowed 
to circumvent U.S. jurisdiction, it could 
offer launches to China and other coun- 
tries,” says von der Dunk, who explains that 
a substantial amount of technical know- 
ledge is passed on in the process of fitting a 
satellite into a launcher—a sensitive point for 
the U.S. While a solution was found for Sea 
Launch, the bottom line remains, says von 
der Dunk: “the law has to come to grips 
with the complexities of the business.” Pres- 
sure is beginning to build up within the 
United Nations Committee on the Peaceful 
Uses of Outer Space (UNCOPUOS) to 
develop an international agreement or at 
least a set of guidelines to resolve questions 
of responsibility and liability. 
Intellectual property is also likely to 
attract a lot of attention at UNISPACE, 
especially in light of preparations to launch 
the International Space Station (ISS). A 
project involving 16 countries, the station 
will be the largest and most complex struc-

ture ever placed in orbit. Arrays of solar 
panels with a total surface of half an acre will 
be connected up to a column the length of 
a football field comprising a series of round 
modules where a crew of seven will live 
and conduct scientific experiments. Over 40 
space flights will be needed to deliver and 
assemble the components of the station, 
which will weigh about 460 tons. The ISS is 
scheduled for completion in the year 2004. 
“It’s essentially a marriage of conve- 
nience,” says Dr. Ram Jakhu of the Institute 
of Air and Space Law at McGill University 
in Canada. The partner states are setting up 
a kind of condominium, sharing the 
expenses of communal services but retai- 
ning control of their individual modules. 
T he station’s lawyers have had almost as dif- 
ficult a time as the engineers. They've had 
to iron out everything from visas and pos- 
sible death certificates for astronauts to 
customs duties. Topping the list of techni- 
calities has been intellectual property rights. 
The ISS will provide an environment of 
microgravity, sometimes described as 
“weightlessness”, giving researchers a 
unique opportunity to study solids, liquids 
and gases and the forces that affect them. 
This may turn out to be a goldmine, since 
scientists expect to make some phenomenal 
breakthroughs in biotechnology, research on 
combustible and renewable fuels, pharma- 
ceuticals and the development of metal 
alloys of unprecedented strength. Pharma- 
ceutical companies are also whetting their 
appetites. They have plans to grow in the 
ISS very pure and precisely ordered protein 
crystals which could be used to design new 
strains of very effective drugs. Imagine the 
scenario, says Jakhu, in which an Indian 
scientist is allowed to conduct experiments 
in Russia’s research module where he or she 
discovers a cure for cancer. Who owns the 
intellectual property rights? Now chances 
are the two countries would broker some 
kind of agreement ahead of time.But that 
doesn’t mean the Japanese, for example, 
invention contains a benefit for the whole of 
mankind?’ asks Prof. Maureen Williams, 
space law expert at the University of Buenos 
Aires. “Obviously countries and compa- 
nies investing astronomical sums should 
be rewarded for their inventions. But should 
a formula with universal benefits, like a

sums should be rewarded for their inventions. But should a 
formula with universal benefits, like a cure for flu, be licensed

make it accessible? 
couldn’t copy the experiment in their 
module. Space is a free zone beyond the 
bounds of terrestrial copyright laws and 
bodies like the World Trade Organization. 
“Should we try to apply traditional rules, 
which are very protective and nationalistic, 
or should we change the approach when the

cure for flu, be licensed strictly on a com- 
mercial basis or should there be provisions 
to make it accessible?’ Here Williams is 
evoking a major principle of space law 
embodied in the Outer Space Convention 
of 1967:“the exploration and use of outer 
space . . . shall be carried out for the benefit 
and in the interest of all countries, irrespective 
of their degree of economic or scientific deve- 
lopment. ...” 
The question of intellectual property rights 
arises in a particularly acute form in the case of 
remote sensing, which has a wide range of appli- 
cations, from monitoring deforestation to pre- 
dicting mud-slides and improving agricultural 
irrigation. It is also a somewhat elegant way of 
referring to observation by satellite. During the 
Cold War, most countries tacitly accepted the 
fact that they were being watched or “sensed” 
but this “gentleman’s agreement” is coming 
under increasing strain for two reasons. To begin 
with, the technology has dramatically improved. 
The old remote sensing systems only had a 
resolution of 30 metres or larger—referring to 
the amount of detail, or land area, that could be 
seen.The latest systems offer resolution of just 
one metre. Until a few years ago, these advanced 
systems were basically in the hands of national 
intelligence communities in the U.S., Russia 
and a handful of other countries. T he technology

is now making its way into the commercial 
sector, and companies are selling the infor- 
mation they acquire to the highest bidder. 
“There is particular concern that terrorist 
groups will be able to get their hands on 
detailed information about potential tar- 
gets that they never had access to before,” 
says Stephen Doyle,a former deputy head 
of international affairs with the U.S. 
National Aeronautical and Space Admi- 
nistration (NASA).“The groups could go 
through third parties to buy the data and 
no-one would be able to trace them.” 
For 10 years, developing countries have 
been calling for rules to regulate remote sen- 
sing which they see as an infringement of 
their national sovereignty. With high-resolu- 
tion images, a company like Shell can explore

a developing country’s oil resources without 
even setting foot on its territory. As things stand, 
a company can take pictures of a country’s 
natural resources without the country’s consent 
and is under no obligation to share that infor- 
mation. The company “owns” that data and is 
therefore free to sell it at any price. The most the 
country of origin can hope to do is buy the 
rights to the data. If not, that country may well 
find itself in a situation in which another com- 
pany or government that did buy the data has 
a better understanding of their resources than 
they do. 
“This is a highly sensitive and political 
issue,” says Williams. Although the UN has 
adopted a series of principles to ensure fair 
access to remote sensing data, the fact remains 
that countries being sensed have no right to 
prior consent, nor do they have a preferential 
right to access the data. 
Uses and abuses 
of remote sensing 
“Wehaven’t got a very good deal, to say 
the least,” says Dr. Jos€¢ Monserrat Filho, 
vice-president of the Brazilian Society of 
Aerospace Law. “We [developing countries] 
need a legally binding agreement to regulate 
remote sensing. Obviously, governments and 
enterprises from industrialized countries 
don’t see the need for a new agreement. T hey 
prefer customary law” and voluntary codes or 
principles which, says Filho, “just maintain the 
status quo.” 
“You must be practical,” warns He Qizhi, 
legal adviser on space affairs to the Chinese 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs. “If you set too 
high a goal, you achieve nothing.” Instead of 
pushing for a legally binding convention,He 
1s hoping to see “softer instruments” like 
declarations and resolutions designed not 
only to limit abuses of remote sensing but to 
extend its benefits. “This could be a very 
powerful tool for improving the environment 
and saving lives, particularly in developing 
countries. . .. The principles for this co-ope- 
ration and fair access are in the existing 
conventions but they're just not clear or 
conspicuous.” He is hoping that UNISPACE 
will spotlight the need for co-operation 
through declarations or principles which may 
later pave the way for regional or bilateral 
agreements. 
As one positive step, Shrogl points to a 
new European Union policy providing scien- 
tists with access to remote sensing data while 
still permitting its commercial sale. “We're 
going to see national and regional legislation 
negotiated on an ad hoc basis,” he says,“but 
we're not going to see something like the 
Law of the Sea. ... The question is how to 
organize international co-operation, not force 
it.” []

® Treaty on Principles Governing the Acti-

Outer Space, Including the Moon and other 
Celestial Bodies (1967): The most important of 
all space law agreements; assures the free explo- 
ration and use of space, including the moon and 
celestial bodies provided that these activities 
are for the benefit and in the interest of all coun- 
tries. States are responsible for all activities 
conducted by their nationals. No-one can appro- 
priate outer space. There is no explicit notion of 
national sovereignty recognized in space, unlike 
aerospace. 95 states have ratified the treaty. 
® Agreement on the Rescue of Astronauts, 
the Return of Astronauts and the Return of 
Objects Launched into Outer Space (1968): 
The first humanitarian law for astronauts, this 
agreement obliges all states to come to the 
rescue of those in danger. 85 states have ratified 
the agreement. 
® Convention on Liability for Damage 
Caused by Space Objects (1972): With space 
debris a long foreseen problem, the conven- 
tion essentially holds states liable for damages 
resulting from their space objects on earth and 
in space. While considered a milestone in sett- 
ling disputes, it requires a substantial amount of 
precision especially in light of growing invol- 
vement of private companies in commercial 
space activities. 80 states have ratified the 
convention. 
e Convention on Registration of Objects 
Launched into Outer Space (1975): States 
are required to register every space object laun- 
ched, including the object’s basic orbital para- 
meters and general function. 40 states have rati- 
fied the convention and registered about 4,900 
objects, including space debris and non-operating 
satellites The registry is generally seen as a weak 
instrument. Not all of the states operating in 
space have ratified it and even those that have fail 
to register every object launched. 
® Agreement Governing the Activities of 
States on the Moon and Other Celestial 
Bodies (1979): Designed to assure the orderly 
and safe development of the moon’s natural 
resources on an equitable basis, the agreement 
has failed in political terms with only 9 states 
ratifying it. Neither the U.S. nor Russia will sign 
because of an article stating that the moon and 
other celestial bodies are part of the “common 
heritage of mankind”, a provision which also 
formed the basis of the Law of the Sea. The 
common heritage principle is criticized for being 
too vague, yet states, particularly the United 
States, firmly oppose any attempts to specify its 
provisions. [|

### 116246: Colombia exports its new school blueprint

Colombia exports its ‘new 
To make up for the failings of traditional rural schools Colombia’s Escuela Nueva movement 
offers flexible and efficient solutions which are being taken up in other countries 
At La Nina school, the teacher doesn’t 
stand in front of the class dishing out 
knowledge. Instead he sits amid a 
group of pupils having a discussion with 
them. The children, of different ages, work 
not at individual desks but around hexa- 
gonal tables. The teacher doesn’t deliver a 
lecture or give orders. Each child goes and 
fetches a self-instructional guide and then 
settles down to study. The teacher doesn’t 
demand silence in class, because the school 
not only allows but strongly encourages 
discussion and group-work. 
La Nifia, in Colombia’s coffee-growing 
Andean province of Caldas, is a rural school 
run according to the principles of the New 
School (Escuela Nueva) movement, which 
was devised by Colombian education experts 
who have managed to turn the disadvantages 
of rural schools—lack of equipment, one- 
room establishments and one or at most two 
teachers for children of different ages and 
abilities—into assets, providing a positive 
experience which instils self-reliance, 
responsibility and teamwork. 
“The thing you notice most when you 
visit a ‘new school’ is how hard the pupils are 
concentrating,” says Ernesto Schiefelbein, 
a former Chilean education minister and 
now rector of Santiago de Chile’s Santo 
Tomds University, who visited the first “new 
school” in Colombia in 1985. “Sometimes 
when the bell rings for playtime, many chil- 
dren are so absorbed they just continue 
working. So learning comes easily. You also 
notice that they're always asking questions, 
which is a very good way to judge how 
effectively they're learning.” 
Self-instruction 
The watchword of the “new school” 
method is self-instruction based on spe- 
cially-written guides (guias) covering maths, 
natural and social sciences and languages. 
These guides are something more than text- 
books; they suggest activities and exercises 
that can be done both in and out of school, 
along with detailed instructions that enable 
the child to go at his or her own speed. 
So pupils make progress according to 
their ability and the time they have avai- 
lable, focusing on the subjects that interest 
them most or which they find most diffi- 
cult. At harvest time, they are allowed to

Children at an Escuela Nueva in Colombia elect their school council. 
go off and help their families, afterwards 
resuming their lessons where they left off. 
This has helped to reduce the amount of 
special coaching needed and also dropout 
numbers, which are considerable in 
Colombia’s small rural communities, 
where between half and three-quarters of 
all children do not go to school or else 
drop out after a couple of years. 
The guides have been criticized for being 
too structured and for curbing teachers’ 
creativity, but they are very useful, inexpen- 
sive teaching materials that can enable a 
single teacher to run a one-class school. 
They give the teacher time to both help the 
youngest children to read and attend to those 
who have problems learning. 
The critics also forget that teachers in 
developing countries are usually not very 
well trained.In Latin America,says Schie- 
felbein, there is “the myth of the dynamic 
teacher who can work wonders with kids” 
when the evidence is that “after six years of 
primary school, half the continent’s children 
can’t understand a simple article on the 
front page of anewspaper.” The big advan- 
tage of the guides is that they can be easily 
followed by poorly-trained teachers and 
also give pupils a lot of independence. 
Teacher training is a key element of the 
system. Teachers have to learn to use new 
educational tools which encourage both the 
pupils and the community to get involved. 
They also have to drop the teacher’s tradi- 
tional authoritarian role as a transmitter of 
knowledge. Each year teachers attend three 
one-week workshops, and visit a demons- 
tration school to “learn by doing” and see the 
advantages of the new method with their 
own eyes. 
As well as using guides, the teacher and 
pupils organize “learning areas” where they 
collect information and objects related to 
classwork and other aspects of daily life. For 
example, a natural science topic may involve 
having an area with sand where local plants 
and insects are kept. 
Another novelty of the New School move- 
ment is the “school council”, providing prac- 
tical introduction to civic and democratic 
life.It is made up of committees which look 
after the school garden, health matters, the 
library, discipline and sports, and encou- 
rages co-operation and leadership based on 
the interests and daily lives of the children. 
The La Nifia school has a farming com- 
mittee which organizes crop growing and 
animal breeding. “What we want is to feel

school’ blueprint 
proud of being country people and to learn 
how to use the land in a more productive 
way,” says 13-year-old committee chairman 
David Cabal. 
Other principles of the New School 
movement are that teaching must be 
adapted to local conditions and lifestyles. 
Parents and other members of the com- 
munity regularly take part in school activi- 
ties, improving buildings and equipment, 
donating teaching materials and helping 
teachers during lessons. In addition, they 
encourage the children to be interested in 
their own history and traditions. T he guides 
suggest collecting proverbs, myths, legends 
and accounts of how people used to live.In 
this way, the school becomes a living source 
of knowledge about the community. 
“The New School movement is perhaps 
the most successful educational reform that 
I’ve seen in more than 30 years’experience 
in almost 20 countries,” wrote Richard J. 
staffer in Manila, recalls that the visitors 
were impressed by the pupils, who were 
self-reliant and responsible, and freely 
expressed their thoughts and opinions 
without fear of their elders. 
The children in the Filipino countryside 
who have been part of the programme have 
gained self-confidence and show greater 
interest in their lessons. Some parents now 
prefer their children to attend these schools 
rather than traditional schools where there 
is one teacher for each age group. “It’s like 
being in a private school,” says 13-year-old 
Adonis Corasay, who likes the fact that the 
village school in Begageng, in Benguet 
province, north of Manila, now caters for 
fifth and sixth-graders, meaning that he will 
be able to complete his primary schooling 
there. 
In Colombia, the New School move- 
ment has survived difficulties at local and 
national level. A study produced in 1998 by 
‘What we want is to feel proud of being country people and to 
learn how to use the land in a more productive way’ 
Kraft, of the University of Colorado, in a 
1997 report for the World Bank and the U.S. 
Agency for International Development 
(USAID). “The boosting of teachers’skills 
has brought radical changes in the 
curriculum, in community development,in 
democratic behaviour and in improved 
schooling.” 
In 1989, the World Bank singled out 
the Escuela Nueva movement as one of the 
three primary school experiments in the 
world which had succeeded in making edu- 
cational innovations, and recommended 
that “the lessons of this experience be widely 
disseminated among policy-makers in deve- 
loping countries.” Since then, the model 
has been successfully used in Guatemala, 
where it has been adopted in its entirety (see 
box page 16). Other countries, including 
Chile, Argentina and recently Nicaragua, 
have borrowed parts of it. 
T he Philippines is the first country out- 
side Latin America to use the model to 
improve teaching at all levels in its multi- 
grade rural schools, which have a poor repu- 
tation. The Multigrade Demonstration 
Schools Project (MGDSP) has set up 24 
schools in 12 provinces. It all began with a 
visit by Filipino officials to “new schools” in 
Colombia in 1993. Persy So, a UNICEF 
UNESCO’s Regional Education Office for 
Latin America and the Caribbean, based in 
Santiago de Chile, showed that of 11 Latin 
American countries surveyed, Colombia 
was the only one where third-grade pupils 
in rural schools got better marks than city 
children in language and maths,in spite of 
   WORLD OF LEARNING

having fewer materials and despite the pro- 
blems of ill-educated parents, geographical 
distance and isolation. 
Teacher training 
Rural schools in Chile and Argentina, 
which were also surveyed and have adopted 
some of the ideas of the “new schools”, did 
not show such good results as the Colom- 
bian ones. Schiefelbein thinks this is because 
they haven’t systematically adopted the new 
programme. “Chile has only taken on board 
a few suggestions made on five pages of a 
manual, and Argentina is still trying out 
the programme in just a handful of schools,” 
he says. 
The programme in Colombia has its 
critics, however. Noel F. McGinn, Pro- 
fessor of Education at Harvard University, 
notes that in its early stages, the Escuela 
Nueva programme “was closely monitored 
and nurtured by persons who were highly 
committed and highly talented”. But as 
the programme expanded, it “became the 
responsibility of people who had only 
received brief training [and] may not have 
been fully convinced about the concept.” 
Some teachers may have needed trai- 
ning, while others, even though they 
grasp the new methods, are not willing to 
include them in their daily teaching acti- 
vity. An Ecuadorian teacher, Rosa M. 
Torres, observed during a visit to several 
“new schools” in Colombia in 1992 that 
Working in groups and encouraging self-instruction are the hallmarks 
of the Colombian method.

many teachers were still attached to old 
ways. “The ideal of progressive education 
coexists with conservative and outdated 
practices,” she said. 
It is hard to say how many genuine “new 
schools” there are in Colombia. Twenty years 
after they first appeared, many of them are 
“new” only in name. The “Volvamos a la 
Gente” Foundation, in Bogota, reckons there 
are about 12,500 schools operating accor- 
ding to the original principles. The number of 
teachers who have had some training and 
still apply what they learned is thought to be 
In rural regions of the Philippines, 24 pilot 
multigrade schools have started putting Escuela 
Nueva methods into practice. In some cases, the 
schools were built by the communities themselves 
around 10,000, a big jump when you think 
there were only 150 at the end of the 1960s 
and just 500 in 1975. 
The programme survives, despite the 
ups and downs of Colombian government 
funding, because of the tactics of the New 
School movement’s organizers. Over the 
last couple of decades, every new education 
minister has been taken to see a “new”

Guatemala: motivation 
and multispeed learning 
  
Mirja Valdes 
Journalist in Guatemala City 
At first, some parents didn’t like the new 
I system at the “Queen of Holland” school, 
138 km north of Guatemala City, because 
their children didn’t bring homework back 
with them. T hey thought their offspring must 
be learning less. But their doubts soon 
disappeared when they saw the progress their 
sons and daughters were making. Now they 
understand that the “homework” has to do 
with the ongoing life of the community. 
Ipolito Alvarez, who is 11, helps his 
craftsman father, but he is still learning even 
though his hands may be caked with mud, 
“my homework is to ask my parents about 
the village and its history,” he says. 
The school, in the village of Santa 
Marta,near San Jerénimo, in the province 
of Baja Verapaz, is one of the 2,084 rural 
schools which are part of the Nueva Escuela 
Unitaria (New Unitary School) project. 
The programme, run by the Guatemalan 
education ministry and based on the 
Colombian model, began in 1991 and now 
1 6 The Unesco Courier - June 1999 
involves 3,500 teachers and about 113,000 
children. 
Thirty-four-year-old Oscar Guerrero has 
taught for 12 years in unitary schools, six of 
them under the new system. “Before, the 
children were passive, timid and didn’t 
participate much,” he says. “I'd give my daily 
lesson in front of the class and they just 
listened. When I asked them if they had any 
questions, no one raised their hands although 
I knew they hadn’t understood.” 
Now things are quite different. The same 
children will pipe up with a question. For 
example, after following the instructions in 
their guide and observing a plant, Ipdlito 
will come and ask about photosynthesis. 
Meanwhile, the other children are 
discussing among themselves what they 
have seen. 
The shelves in the library carry about 15 
books, with three copies of each. The pages 
are all dog-eared from being constantly used 
by the children year after year. As in 
Colombia, the school’s 32 pupils have 
organized their own student government, 
which is chosen using the same system as the 
 
rural school and a traditional one.Official 
support for the new model has usually fol- 
lowed (even though it costs 10 per cent 
more than the traditional one) because it has 
the clear merits of improving the quality of 
teaching and reducing the numbers of tea- 
chers needed. 
But to introduce a new way of educating 
children, “which aims not to mirror society 
but to change it,” according to Schiefelbein, 
means top officials and individual teachers all 
have to be persuaded of its value. This is an 
enormous task, but a very vital one. [| 
one used in national elections, with voter 
registration, electoral cards and a campaign. 
The school has two classrooms, each 
measuring six metres by eight and divided 
into sections according to subject and age- 
group. On one wall is a map of the 
community drawn by the children on the 
back of an advertising poster. To save paper, 
before they start using notebooks,the first 
and second grade pupils learn how to draw 
shapes and marks in the sand. 
The children are allowed to learn at their 
own speed, so their education does not clash 
with the harvest season when they have to go 
with their parents to the coast. If the school 
year ends and they haven't reached the 
required level, the teacher just marks their 
school report with the words “in process of 
learning”. [|

The number of people living in cities has doubled since 1975 and will 
double again between now and the year 2015.This unprecedented urban 
revolution, which mainly affects the Third World, is not just a question of 
numbers. The appearance, organization and even the function of cities 
have been revolutionized. Traditionally, cities have been places of meeting 
and exchange, but now they are splitting up into enclaves divided by walls 
built by the well-off and by social and ethnic barriers. In this situation, city 
authorities are often powerless or acquiescent (see pages 18 to 21). 
In Lagos (Nigeria), ingenuity and determination are the key to survival 
(pages 22 to 25). Millions of inhabitants of Jakarta (Indonesia) have had to 
rebuild their lives after being evicted from their homes because of property 
speculation (pages 26 to 28). On the other hand, the authorities in Shanghai 
seem to be coping with an influx of four million “temporary” residents, who 
are however only accepted on sufferance (pages 32 to 35). Brasilia (Brazil) 
bristles with iron railings that protect people’s privacy, as Brazilian sociologist 
Licia Valladares explains (pages 29 to 31). 
Jorge Wilheim, one of the organizers of the United Nations Habitat II 
conference (Istanbul, 1996) puts these issues in a broader context of place 
and time. Cities, and thus our civilization, he predicts, will be shaped by 
the ongoing phenomenon of globalization (page 36).

Living with Leviathan 
  
Martine Jacot 
UNEsco Courier Journalist 
In the year 2015, there will be 30 mega-cities with more than 8 million inhabitants— 
22 of them in Asia. How will they cope? 
Fortress-type housing 
complexes are becoming 
increasingly common in all the 
world’s large cities. Here, a 
high-security dwelling in 
Cruzeiro, one of Brasilia’s 
satellite cities. 
    
 
  
  
    
  
1 8 The Unesco Courier - Jun  1999 
two-thirds of the planet’s population will be 
living in cities by 2025, UN population 
experts say. Until now, rural people have out- 
numbered city-dwellers. 
World population, according to the same pro- 
jections, will top eight billion in 25 years’ time, 
including five billion in cities. The increase will be 
particularly spectacular in the cities of the develo- 
ping world, whose total population will double to 
four billion. We are going to see an unpreceden- 
ted exodus of people from rural areas. 
The demographers’ predictions are only ten- 
tative of course (see box on opposite page). But 
the flow of people into megacities in developing 
countries is well under way. Several sociological 
changes are behind it. 
Cities used to need muscle-power for the jobs 
they provided, the experts point out. But today 
they no longer attract people just because of their 
economic potential. “There’s plenty of evidence 
that they can go on steadily attracting people even 
H umanity is about to set a new record.Nearly when the job-generating sectors are in bad shape 
or disappearing,” says Philippe Haeringer, a 
research supervisor at the French Scientific 
Institute for Development in Co-operation 
(ORSTOM). 
People no longer move to urban centres 
because they are fairly sure to find work.They do 
so because they want to leave the countryside 
where there are too many people tilling the land 
and because they hope to leave poverty behind. 
Rightly or wrongly, the city seems to offer pro- 
gress and freedom, a vision of opportunity, an 
irresistible lure. 
The result is that both inside and outside 
cities, there are more and more squatters and poor 
housing.Urbanization in the developing world dif- 
fers from that in the industrialized countries, says 
Canadian town planner Richard Stern, head of 
the Urban Communities Centre at the University 
of Toronto, in “the speed of the process, the grow- 
th of poverty, the extent of urban sprawl and the 
expansion of the informal economy.”

### 116248: Living with Leviathan

There are hardly 
any open spaces left 
on the globe... The 
planet has turned into 
a boundless world city, 
Yakov Okunev, 
Russian writer 
1 
The South’s urban revolution 
  
How are the authorities in the developing 
world’s urban areas responding to such “inva- 
sions”? In today’s deregulated world, the trend is 
to question the very idea of providing the general 
population with basic urban services, most obser- 
vers note. For want of resources, cities in develo - 
ping countries are increasingly abandoning their 
public service function. 
China is still an exception to this in several 
ways. Officials there, in a context of rigid plan- 
ning—though this has eased in recent years—are 
trying to prevent the influx of more rural migrants 
than the city economies can cope with, as the 
example of Shanghai shows. Can such a policy, 
which works fairly well for the moment, survive the 
political and economic changes under way? 
At the other end of the scale is Lagos 
(Nigeria), whose expansion is chaotic. About 200 
slums have sprung up in this African city. Every 
now and then, one of them is bulldozed without 
notice and without heed for its inhabitants. But 
Lagos survives thanks to the vibrant ingenuity of 
its millions of citizens. Another revealing city is 
Jakarta,where the authorities themselves have joi- 
ned in frantic property speculation. As a result of 
this speculation, more than 4.5 million people 
have been evicted from their homes in the last 30 
years, with little compensation, to make possible 
the construction of high-rise blocks, which some- 
times stand empty. 
How do the original inhabitants of a city react 
to the massive influx of people from outside? In 
more and more cities, you see smart neighbou- 
rhoods protected by guards—what Brazilian 
researcher Teresa Caldeira calls “fortress-cities”. 
In these fortified enclaves, built partly in respon- 
se to real or imagined lack of security, the roads, 
sewage system,schools and other community ser - 
vices are private. Outside them, public areas have 
been abandoned to the least fortunate members 
of the society and the infrastructure there is 
crumbling or inadequate. The middle and poorer 
classes also defend themselves in their own neigh- 
bourhoods. One surprising case can be found in 
the satellite cities just outside Brasilia, where iron 
railings protect the houses, from fancy villas to 
the humblest shack. 
Will the mega-cities of the 21st century be 
made up of islands of “social tribes”—"“anti- 
cities” of walled enclaves,whose wealthy residents 
refuse to pay taxes to provide facilities for the 
city’s less fortunate inhabitants? Will cities still 
integrate their inhabitants? 
“The existence of a slum means the authori- 
ties have failed,” says Anthony Pellegrini, an 
urban development expert at the World Bank. 
The bank encourages projects where the state and 
the private sector join hands to help the less for- 
tunate buy plots of land in areas with an infra- 
structure. Other experts say the “anti-social” 
aspects of globalization should be blamed. They 
would like to see the big cities of the next centu- 
ry return to their original function as a crossroads 
and a meeting-place. u 
Mexico City — those confounded demographers 
M edium or long-term predictions about population sometimes turn out wrong.One of the most flagrant examples 
is that of Mexico City. In the 1980s, demographers warned that it would have between 22 and 30 million people 
by the year 2000,making it the world’s biggest urban area,ahead of Tokyo. 
But the Mexican capital today has“ only” 17 million inhabitants. According to recent reports by the College of Mexico 
  
and Mexico’s National Population Council, the city’s average annual population growth rate fell from 5.06% in the 1970s 
t0 2.59% in the 1980s and 2% since 1990.What happened? 
Rrst, the experts overestimated the city’s population at the time of the 1980 census and underestimated the drop in 
fertility, which fell from 45 births per 1,000 women of childbearing age in 1965 to 28 per 1,000 in 1992.Mexicans were 
also discouraged from emigrating to the capital by other factors, including the 1985 earthquake which killed more than 
30,000 people there, and worsening air pollution. Thousands of firms were induced by grants to move from the capital 
to smaller cities. They took their jobs with them. 
So the flow of people was reversed. Mexico City grew in the 1980s at the rate of about 1,500 people a day, but from 
1992 on there was a net loss of population.In that year, 661,000 people left the capital and fewer than 171,000 came 
to live there. 
Mexico City stands on the site of the former Aztec city of Tenochtitlan, whose 60,000 inhabitants made it the 
world’s biggest urban centre at the time of the Spanish Conquest in the 16th century. Today's estimates suggest it has 
lost thistitle forever. It is expected to stay below the 20-million mark until 2015, when it will be only the world’s seventh 
largest urban area. This is a great relief to the authorities, which were facing a crisis of excessive and chaotic growth. The 
city’s population has increased tenfold since 1940,when it was only 1.7million,and its area has grown from 500 sq km 
in 1940 to today’s 4,500 sq km. [|

### 116249: The Urban explosion

The urban explosion 
e increasing number of mega-cities of more 
T- eight million inhabitants illustrates in 
itself the major demographic and geographical 
trends of the past century. In 1950, only two cities, 
London and New York, were that size. In 1900 they 
were the world’s most populous cities, followed by 
Paris. In 1975, there were 11 mega-cities, including 
six in the industrialized countries. In 1995, there 
were 23, most of them (17) in the developing coun- 
tries. In 2015, the projected number of mega-cities 
is 36,30 of them in the developing world and most 
(22) in Asia. 
Urbanization is taking place at different speeds 
on different continents. In North America, the 
number of city-dwellers overtook the rural popu- 
lation before the Second World War. In Europe, 
this happened after the war and in Latin America at 
the beginning of the 1960s. Today, these three conti- 
nents are almost equally urbanized (75% of Euro- 
peans and Latin Americans are city-dwellers and 
77% of North Americans, according to UN esti- 
mates for the year 2000). 
A similar process is occurring in Africa and 
Asia, which are still mainly rural. T heir proportion 
of city-dwellers rose from 25% in 1975,to 35% in 
1995 and alittle more than 37% today. The turning 
point, when the figure will top 50%, is predicted for 
around 2025. 
In terms of numbers, the world’s city-d wellers 
in 2025 should total 307 million in North America, 
566 million in Latin America, 572 million in Europe, 
752 million in Africa and 2,507 million (2.5 billion) 
in Asia. In 2015, the world’s six biggest cities are 
expected to be Tokyo, Bombay, Lagos, Sdo Paulo, 
Dhaka and Karachi. 
Experts say the rate of population growth will 
eventually decline everywhere, but once again at 
very different speeds. Between 2005 and 2010, 
annual population growth rates are predicted to be 
3.82% in Africa, 2.59% in Asia, 1.68% in Latin 
America, 1.06% in North America and 0.24% in 
Europe. [|

### 116250: Lagos: the survival of the determined

Lagos: the survival 
of the determined 
  
Amy Otchet 
Unesco Courier journalist 
Lagos is a city where near anarchy prevails rather than government. Lagosins respond 
to the chaos by relying on their own ingenuity to get by 
Nigeria has just lost a football match. Streams of 
young men run through the street to let off steam 
as crowds dive into the tangle of battered yellow 
minibuses. A dozen passengers pack into one bus, 
and the driver grinds into gear, lurching at full 
throttle to gain a six-inch lead over his competitor. 
The side-view mirror has to be pulled in for the bus 
to squeeze through. Girls balancing bags of water on 
their heads edge their way through the traffic to vend 
their wares. Toilet brushes,cutting shears,smoked 
fish, hankies,inflatable globes and even a steering 
wheel are sold by boys as the coil of traffic becomes 
ever more ensnared.But the action never stops for 
a moment. That’s Lagos—a city that moves, mira- 
culously, against the odds. 
t’s rush-hour near the stadium in Lagos where 
A mighty 
magnet 
It’s difficult to find the centre, let alone the 
logic, of this city reputed to be the most dangerous 
in Africa. Three bridges connect about 3,500 square 
kilometres of lagoon, islands, swamp and the main- 
land, where unlit highways run past canyons of 
smouldering garbage before giving way to dirt 
streets weaving through 200 slums, their sewers 
running with raw waste. So much of the city is a 
mystery. No one even knows for sure the size of the 
population—officially it’s 6 million, but most experts 
estimate it at 10 million (see box)—Iet alone the 
number of murders each year, the rate of HIV 
infection or the quantities of drugs that pass through 
the port of Apapa. Corruption is endemic at all 
levels. A bus driver doesn’t even slow down to slip 
a few bills into a policeman’s open palm to avoid 
being pulled over. T he rich barricade themselves on 
two fortress islands, removed from the mainland, 
where two-thirds of the population live below the 
poverty line. 
But to look upon Lagos simply as the archetypal 
urban nightmare is to miss the point. Lagos, as the 
economic, cultural and, until 1991, political powe- 
rhouse of mighty Nigeria, is, for all its faults, also a 
magnet pulling some 300,000 people every year. The 
streets aren’t all paved with concrete, let alone gold, 
but Lagos appears as an El Dorado in the poverty- 
stricken countryside where work can be found and 
dreams of the good life can come true. In reality, 
most find it a daily struggle to make ends meet, yet 
an iron-clad conviction that those dreams will mate- 
rialize one day gives Lagos a vibrant beat.

On the Apapa-Oshodi 
Expressway, a typical traffic 
jam— locally known 
asa “go-slow”. 
 
If you ask Lagosins about the glue that holds 
their city together they speak of endurance. For 
some, it is a capacity to withstand suffering. T his 
helps to explain the much talked-about boom in 
evangelism.“People are seeking spiritual solutions 
to their economic problems,” says Pastor Ebenezer 
Babajide, who opened his Jesus Generation Gospel 
Church last year in the annex of a nursery school. 
But there is a drive that goes beyond simply the will 
to survive.

### 116250: Lagos: the survival of the determined

“In Nigeria, there is a spirit to aggressively pur- 
sue the good life,which you won't find elsewhere on 
the continent,” says Felix Morka, executive director 
of the non-governmental Social and Economic 
Rights Action Centre.The oil boom beginning in 
the 1970s raised expectations for a better life which 
The South’s urban revolution 
 
Atown is like an 
animal. A town has a 
meal. “We built this place on our own,” says Chief 
Johnson Aibe, by trading fish for wood from mills 
nearby to build homes and canoes. There are no offi- 
cial deeds or titles in this community. A council of 
elders decides who can build a new home at what 
price. Harsh experience has taught these people

head and shoulders 
and feet. A town is a 
thing separate from all

that the less interface with officialdom, the better. 
They used to live on the other side of the lagoon but 
in 1985 the government decided to demolish their 
homes to build housing estates that these people 
couldn’t afford. Many lost everything, never recei- 
ving a naira in compensation. T heir options lay in 
rebuilding, by their own means, on their own terms. 
In some ways,Ebute Metta reflects a lost Lagos 
of the 1950s and 60s, when people flocking from the 
countryside basically built small communities within 
people managed to hang on to, even after the eco- 
nomy took a nose-dive in the 1980s and the World 
Bank’s structural adjustment policies made life 
more difficult. “It’s as if people are struggling to 
reverse the economic downturn as individuals,” 
says Morka.“Everyone wants capital to start their 
own business. This industriousness is very Nige- 
rian but the struggle is even more fierce and stark in 
Lagos where there is such a concentration of pres- 
sures,resources and population.” 
  
Wheelbarrows 
rented out as beds 
Instead of exploding under pressure, Lagosins 
have pumped that much more out of the informal 
structure, which Morka calls “an incredible renewable 
resource that has been the military government’s 
greatest ally.” T his underground economy enables at 
least half the city’s people to make ends meet. By 
taking the edge off economic hardship, the informal 
sector cuts down the potential for political upheaval. 
Typical of the informal sector is the professor 
who earns 5,000 naira, equivalent to about $55 a 
month, and takes on a second or even a third job. 
Perhaps he opens a small food store to pay for his 
daughter’s tuition fees of $85 per semester. In this 
vast black market, vegetables and fruit flow across 
the border from neighbouring Benin, their entry 
eased by bribing customs officials who earn about 
$55 a month.When the government cuts domes- 
tic fuel supplies to meet export demands, the 
informal sector fills the tanks of taxis and buses to 
keep Lagos moving. Behind this informal sector 
lies a powerful if not desperate spirit of initiati- 
ve—wheelbarrows are rolled out of a construction 
site at night to serve as rented beds at 20 cents a 
shot for homeless seeking shelter under an ove- 
rhang.When rain makes a market run with mud, 
kids wait with buckets of water to wash shoppers’ 
feet for a few naira. 
The informal sector is where a man pushes a 
cart from one home to the next, making $65 per 
month for hauling away garbage and then earning 
another $55 by salvaging the reusable junk. A tanker 
pulls up to fill a 100-gallon water tank for $6 to the 
owner who then sells a bucketful for five cents. It’s the 
barter that takes place when a baker has too many 
loaves left over at the end of the day or the flurry of 
motorcycles gathered at the street corner where 
buses don’t stop. And it’s at the heart of a basic code 
ruling Lagos, from the thriving fruit market to the 
quiet fishing community: Do It Yourself. 
A maze of planks stretch into the lagoon of 
Ebute Metta, where about 400 wooden shacks sit on 
stilts over the water,removed from the surrounding 
soot and speed of Lagos. Naked kids swing from the 
planks, while women bathe and prepare the evening 
  
the city along ethnic and geographic lines. Today’s 
cosmopolitan Lagos has moved past this tradition.

The State of Lagos spans 3,577 kmz which includes the metropolitan area of about 1,183 
kmz, of which only 728 km? is dry land. A new governor and legislator were scheduled to take 
control from the military administration on May 29,1999. The area is divided into 20 local 
government districts (whose leaders will also be elected) which have suffered from severe 
underfunding. 
Population 
The most recent census (1991) reported a population of 5.6 million. However, it is widely dis- 
credited because many of the city’s inhabitants returned to their villages of origin during the 
census. Experts generally estimate that the population ranges between 10 and 13 million, com- 
posed largely of the country’s three main ethnic groups: Yoruba, Ibo and Hausa. According to 
UN projections population will reach 20 million by 2010. 
History 
Lagos was known as Eko before the Portuguese arrived in the 15th century. Declared a Bri- 
tish colony in 1861, the town of about 250,000 was divided into separate quarters for expa- 
triates the indigenous population and migrants. In 1960, Lagos became the political and eco- 
nomic capital of the newly independent Nigeria. By 1963, more than one million people lived 
in Lagos. 
In 1966,the military took control of the country and a civil war broke out the following 
year, unleashing another wave of migration to Lagos. The oil boom of the early 1970s, in which 
the price for a barrel of crude rose from 30 cents to $13,unleashed a wave of irrational and 
corrupt infrastructure spending on, for example, a series of major highways which divide the 
city but fail to relieve the infamous traffic jams. The demographic and transport pressures conti- 
nued to mount as the city experienced phenomenal economic growth: by 1978, Lagos 
accounted for 40% of Nigeria's external trade and 40% of the national skilled population. The 
world recession of 1981 sent Lagos reeling into the debt and runaway inflation which 
continue today. The ongoing electrical blackouts, housing shortages, sanitation problems and 
telecommunications logjams all stem from this period. In 1991, Abuja was officially declared 
the political capital of Nigeria. 
Economic data 
According to government sources, 62% of Nigeria's GNP is concentrated in Lagos, along with 
about 40% of currency in circulation and 45% of the industrial labour force. Yet it is estimated 
that about two-thirds of the city’s population live below the poverty line, while 60 to 70% 
depend on the informal sector. Only about 30% have access to running water. About 6,000 
tons of garbage are generated each day and only 0.09% of solid waste is treated. [|

corpse lies among rotting vegetables in the 
street of Ikosi, the largest fruit and vegetable 
market in Lagos. The killing took place the 
day before,on April 15,when bulldozers were sent 
in by the local government to level the market. 
Barefoot, wearing shorts and a T-shirt emblazoned 
with the name of American basketball player 
Michael Jordan, the dead man remains anonymous, 
probably just another migrant worker at the market 
where 12,000 people scratched a living. Black cloth 
covers his face—the sole act of kindness his co-wor- 
kers can bestow. Only the local government can 
remove a cadaver but officials don’t dare enter Ikosi. 
Normally, the market would buzz with lorries 
dropping pineapples, plantain and yams beside 
the labyrinth of ramshackle shops, stalls and 
tables. Now a putrid mix of rotting fruit, tear gas 
and tension hangs in the air a day after the local 
government chairman, Mrs. Thorpe, ordered a 
private contractor to demolish Ikosi, which she 
a decent apartment or a new job. Yet in this city, 
connections are also essential for finding basic ser- 
vices like electricity, security and water. For example, 
power outages lasting eight hours are a routine part 
of the day. Only the rich can afford a generator, but 
the crafty will work together to lay cables and pirate 
electricity from a government building nearby. 
Tapping into 
water pipes 
Break-ins are a major concern for rich and poor 
communities alike. So each household in the neigh- 
bourhood will chip in about $25 a month to hire 
local patrols which go so far as to close local roads 
late at night. 
“Do not vandalize!” reads a public announce- 
ment painted on a water main lining a highway. 
“Stop the thieves who deprive you of water.” But in 
a city where only an estimated 30 per cent of fami- 
lies have running water, tapping into a pipe isnot a 
crime but a chance for home improvement. 
While complacency doesn’t gain much ground 
in Lagos, the driving initiative has yet to spark an 
organized demand or movement for socio-eco- 
nomic rights. While the reasons behind this are 
complex, there is one obvious factor: over 30 years 
of military control and human rights abuse with the 
likes of the infamous General Abacha, who died last

considered a fire-trap and a magnet for crime. 
She maintains that she had the full support of 
Ikosi’s trade union representatives. 
Sevi Taiwo 1s one of those leaders. “We built 
this place by ourselves,” says Mrs Taiwo, who has 
worked at Ikosi for 30 years. Mrs. Taiwo claims 
that she met with the local government several 
times to discuss ways of improving the market’s 
sanitary conditions. She feared that plans to raze 
and rebuild Ikosi would result in rental fees 
beyond the reach of the current occupants. Her 
voice went unheard. 
On the morning of April 15, police ordered 
people to leave as the bulldozer headed for the 
first shop. The owner pleaded with them to stop 
but the police kicked and shot his 24-year-old 
assistant,Bob. As the bulldozer moved on,crowds 
threw stones and police fired tear gas and bullets. 
But the marketers kept coming and the police 
fled. Emboldened by the retreat, the crowd set 
fire to the bulldozer. 
Within an hour,the police returned with rein- 
forcements. “People weren’t even fighting, just 
running as the police fired at them,” says Mutia 
Akintae, a student passing by. “As I ran, I felt my 
clothes burning.” Acid had been thrown on his 
chest and face, giving rise to speculation that

year. How do you demand the right to water from 
a regime which openly rejects the rule of law? 
A new elected government is now taking the 
reins and offers some sense of optimism. But “elec- 
tions are just the tip of the iceberg,” says Prof. Akin 
Mabogunje, Nigeria's most famous geographer. 
“To bring some sanity to a city like Lagos, you've got 
to bring government down to the people by getting 
them involved in decisions concerning their own 
neighbourhoods,” he says. “This is the only way they 
can be expected to not just contribute to public 
works but monitor the ways in which people’s repre- 
sentatives spend their money” 
Concrete bunkers for the lucky 
M.O. Ajayi, an urban planner, says that instead of 
receiving government help in response to grassroots 
problems, Lagos has been subject to orders, issued 
from the top down and often causing more harm than 
good (see article below). The district of Maroko, 
which was razed in 1990, is the most obvious case in 
point. About 300,000 people used to live in this 
beach-front slum. Sitting below sea-level, Maroko was 
regularly flooded, with tides of water, mud and raw 
waste making it an unhealthy place to live and an eye- 
sore for the neighbouring community of Victoria 
Island, a fortress for the rich.

us to leave,” says Helen Omame, 50, remembering 
the day 9 years ago when her home was destroyed. 
“People were killed in the demolition, children left 
stranded.” Today, she and her husband live with their 
8 children a few kilometres down the coast at “new 
Maroko”, almost a carbon copy of the original, 
where the lucky live in concrete bunkers built by the 
state. Like many other families, the Omame family 
were never compensated for their losses. At night, 
the family splits up to sleep in the wooden shacks of 
the market. “The kids are really feeding the family,” 
says Helen. “It’s easier for them to find odd jobs, like 
collecting garbage and carrying sacks of sand at 
construction sites.” 
Ironically, this may be the up and coming area 
of Lagos. “Everyone is moving out here fast,” says 
a smiling Ellen Kole inside her new ice-cream 
shop. While luxury homes with domed roofs and 
sweeping balconies sprout on the horizon, more 
modest families like hers flock to three-roomed 
bungalows, lacking water, electricity and a drain 
for raw waste. “The new government is going to 
invest here,” Ellen announces. In the meanwhile, 
her family and neighbours will make do on their 
own as they push the city’s limits. Lagos moves 
on, without a straight course or a plan, but with a 
singular will. nu

“The police just came with bulldozers and told 
extends only over spiritual matters. “I have heard 
of people being killed at Ikosi,” says Rokosu,“but 
I have not seen anything.” Would the prince or the 
king come to see lkosi and to consult the elders? 
“That would not be appropriate.” If the people 
came to the king, could he present their concerns 
to the government? “Events have overtaken that 
possibility,” says the prince. 
Two mornings after the confrontation, a 
human rights activist is brought to Ikosi for 
consultation. Under an overhang, women sweep 
the ground and arrange benches as a crowd 
gathers. A prayer for peace is offered by Chief 
Bamiro, an unofficial leader, before discussions 
turn to Nwaogbe’s offer to file a court injunction. 
Gradually, a new dynamic takes hold in Ikosi. 
When the bulldozers first arrived, the marketers 
were prepared to die rather than see their liveli- 
hoods destroyed. But in the aftermath, there is a 
clear consensus that bravery alone won’t prevent 
another attack.The next step in survival requires 
organization. So after consulting their people, the 
elders decide to propose to the government that if 
the authorities provide specific guidelines for a 
new lkosi, the people will build it on their own. 
Despite the new resolve, tension is still high 
with fears of another police attack.Tires smoulder 
at the front of the market but deeper inside 
bunches of plantain and bags of millet are on dis- 
play as children hawk water and music blares 
from a barber shop. The dead man still lies in the

### 116252: Jakarta's dispossessed

  
Jkartas 
dispossessed 
  
Andreas Harsono 
Journalist in Jakarta (Indonesia) 
Victimized by speculative 
development projects and arbitrary 
planning procedures, millions of 
Jakartans have had to start their 
lives afresh 
n a humid tropical evening in mid-April, 
0 Henry Muhamad Ali stood under a tall 
billboard in southern Jakarta.“Look!” he 
said bitterly, pointing up to the sign above his head. 
“It says everybody should apply for a building permit 
when constructing their houses.” 
Ali had good reason to be bitter. T he billboard 
had been set up at an intersection near the campus 
of the University of Indonesia, on a grassy spot where, 
exactly a decade ago, he had been living in a house 
legally built on a 2,000-square-metre plot of land. 
Then came the day when he and his family were 
forcibly evicted. 
“Hundreds of police and army officers, some 
armed with machine guns, forced my wife and children 
to leave our home,” he cried, adding that tractors had 
been used to flatten his house. 
All over the Jakarta agglomeration, many middle- 
and lower-class Jakartans could tell similar stories. 
They were the legal owners of houses whose 
construction had been authorized. Then they were 
driven out to make room for the skyscrapers,real 
estate complexes and highrise condominiums that 
have transformed central Jakarta. 
Land speculation in Jakarta—and in Indonesia 
in general—has been more intensive than elsewhere 
in Asia. There are several reasons for this. One is 
that Indonesia has no progressive tax system to 
discourage people from accumulating land holdings. 
(A progressive tax system is one in which wealthy 
people pay relatively more tax than the less wealthy.) 
Secondly, Indonesian people traditionally like to 
invest their money in land, which is considered a 
yardstick of their social status as well as a source of 
wealth. Government officials as well as private 
developers jostle to accumulate land: the higher an 
official’s rank, the more land he is likely to possess. 
Thirdly, Indonesian banks traditionally regard land 
as good collateral for loans, and in the 1980s and 
1990s competed with each other to provide credit 
for land speculation. They did not realize that 
Indonesia’s economic structure was fragile.

Between October 1993, when the government 
issued a package of deregulation measures which 
included the liberalization of land ownership, and 
June 1998, Indonesia’s National Land Agency issued 
“appropriation permits” to scores of developers 
over a total area of almost 250,000 hectares. 
An appropriation permit allows development 
companies to approach residents in a target area to 
negotiate and sell their land. In practice, developers 
often used strong-arm methods to force small land- 
owners to sell up. 
According to an estimate by the Ministry of 
Public Housing, by 1999 enough land had been 
“released” by its owners to satisfy Indonesia’s 
demand for new houses for a hundred years. In other 
words, the speculative bubble burst, and one reason

why the Indonesian banking sector is enmeshed in 
economic crisis today is because of its non- 
performing property loans. 
In this “land rush” the government ignored town 
planning blueprints it had helped to prepare. Hence 
the story of people like Ali. 
At the height of the forced evacuations, in the 
late 1970s and in the 1980s, Indonesian newspapers 
were full of stories about developers using armed 
thugs to harass small land-owners and soldiers 
strong-arming citizens opposed to what was going 
on. Human rights lawyers tried desperately to 
negotiate but in some cases they too were prosecuted 
and even jailed. 
Not all threatened home-owners took things lying 
down. Some organized resistance, and in one case 
soldiers on an eviction mission were attacked with 
sharpened bamboo spears. “Many of these people 
were actually killed,” says Panangian Simanungkalit 
of the Center for Indonesia Property Studies, who 
estimates that 4.5 million people were evacuated from 
their homes in Jakarta during the authoritarian rule 
of President Suharto between 1968 and 1998. 
When officials 
override planning blueprints 
For 55-year-old Ali this was not the first time he 
had been evicted from his home. In 1959, when 
Indonesia was preparing to host the Asian Games, 
his house was one of hundreds in the Senayan 
district of central Jakarta that were bulldozed to 
make room for the Senayan Sports Complex, the 
largest in southeast Asia. 
On that occasion he received a small amount of 
compensation, and used it to buy a plot of land 
about two kilometres away. Then, in 1979, he 
decided to sell up for a profit and buy the 2,000- 
square-metre plot of land in Srengseng Sawah where 
he would later experience eviction for a second time. 
Before he made the purchase, however, he took 
certain precautions. He went along to the office of 
the Governor of Jakarta and to the mayoralty of

southern Jakarta (see box) and consulted the M aster 
Plan the authorities had drawn up to deal with 
problems of Jakarta’s rapid urban growth. He was 
reassured when officials told him that the Srengseng 
Sawah area was intended to be a housing zone. Later 
he was issued with a building permit. Then, in 1989, 
officials simply said that they had changed the 
Master Plan. When Ali protested the Jakarta 
authorities ordered the soldiers to go in. 
What happens to Ali and the millions like him 
who have been expelled?Where do they go and how 
do they set about rebuilding their lives? 
Alot depends on their means. The authorities 
provide compensation for evicted people, but this 
is usually very low. On average it amounts to one- 
twentieth of the market price of their property 
according to Panangian. 
The government tried to introduce low-cost 
housing in certain areas, but its efforts were a drop 
in the ocean and were soon dwarfed beneath the 
forest of high-rise condos and skyscrapers. 
Officials usually encourage displaced small 
landowners to move to the suburbs or to join a 
government-sponsored transmigration programme 
designed to relocate people from overpopulated 
islands such as Java, Madura and Bali to more 
sparsely settled islands such as Irian Jaya, 
Kalimantan or Sumatra. 
Those who can afford to do so move out to the 
suburbs. Many have settled in Bekasi, to the east,

Population 
The UN estimated that the population of the Jakarta urban agglomeration,Indonesia’s 
capital and largest city, was 8.6 million in 1995, having risen from 1.452 million in 1950. Accor- 
ding to UN projections it will be almost 14 million in 2015. Jakartans are drawn from many 
ethnic groups. Sundanese from West Java and Javanese dominate, but Sumatran, Minangkabau, 
Balinese and others are well represented. There is also a significant Chinese population which 
was victimized during massive rioting in May 1998. Most Jakartans are Muslims, but Buddhism, 
Hinduism,and a variety of Christian confessions are also represented. 
Political situation 
In 1966 the government declared Jakarta (total area 661 sq km) a special metropolitan 
district with a status and administration similar to that of a province. The city has a governor 
and five mayoralties: Central Jakarta, South Jakarta,North Jakarta, West Jakarta and East 
Jakarta. Central and West are the main business areas. Most government offices and embas- 
sies are located in Central. A mayoralty comprises several districts (kecamatan), and a district 
consists of between a dozen and two dozen sub-districts (kelurahan). Mayors are appointed 
by the governor. 
Economic data 
Jakarta developed as a centre of trade under the Europeans and still plays an important 
role in international and domestic commerce. Jkarta’'s share of gross domestic product 
represents 9% of the national total: 14% of transportation and communication, 15% of manu- 
facturing,25% of trade and services and 65% of banking.Manufactured goods include tex- 
tiles, footw ear, clothing, foodstuffs, chemicals, plastics and electronic devices. But manufac- 
turing ismuch less important than in other Asian cities at comparable levels of development. 
History 
In the late 16th century the Dutch East India Company built a walled city, Batavia,as a 
trading centre. The Dutch built drainage canalsand later an extensive urban railway system. 
By 1930 Jakarta had 530,000 inhabitants, and included a Chinatown and a modern European 
quarter surrounded by rural villages (kampungs). In 1945 Indonesian freedom fighters 
declared Indonesia’s independence and renamed the city Jakarta. m

» main concentrations for the growth of 
manufacturing employment and population on the 
outer edge of the Jakarta agglomeration. For the 
poor it was, and is, a very different story (see below). 
Compared to many, Ali was lucky. When he was 
evicted, he filed a lawsuit against the authorities. At 
first he got free legal aid, but did not work while 
waiting for his case to come up and spent a lot of 
time attending court sessions. After a protracted 
legal battle his case was dismissed on appeal in 1996, 
but he was awarded compensation of around 50 
million rupiah ($19,230 at the then exchange rate). 
This was just enough to buy the 150 square-metre 
plot of land where he and his family live today, a 
kilometre away from the site from which they were 
expelled in 1989. 
When he lost his house, Ali also lost his 
workplace—he used to be a welder. Like other 
displaced households, the family has become much 
poorer. If Ali had been allowed to keep the house 
he owned in Senayan in the 1960s and 1970s he 
would now be a very rich man indeed since land 
prices in this desirable area of Jakarta have 
skyrocketed. 
Ali 1s now out of work. His wife, Umroh Aini, tries 
to support the family and has opened a small kiosk at 
a bus stop, selling soft drinks and peanuts. T heir 
children, aged between nine and 30, share the small 
house with their parents. T he three oldest sons dropped 
out of school and found work as bus drivers. 
Displaced people like Ali lose their confidence as 
well as their homes. They feel they have failed in life. 
T hey also leave behind them the tightly knit social 
support network of neighbours and relatives which 
is a strong feature of Indonesian life. People who live 
in Jakarta’s new suburban areas usually come from 
a patchwork of ethnic and religious backgrounds. 
Many people do not know their neighbours. 
Those who live in the suburb areas face many 
problems, ranging from longer commuting hours 
to bad sanitation, inadequate telephone lines and 
low water quality. 
Clean water 
for 5% of the population 
Water supply is an ever-present problem in cities 
of the South and Jakarta is no exception. PAM Jaya, 
the water supply operator, is perhaps Jakarta’s worst- 
run state-owned company. In spite of 170 per cent 
growth between 1987 and 1997, it can only supply 
clean water to around 5 per cent of the population. 
Displaced families have to rely on their well. T he 
water from Ali’s well is still drinkable, but many 
other families, especially in central and northern 
Jakarta,have to buy their drinking water every day 
from itinerant vendors. 
PT Telkom, Indonesia’s telecoms utility, has 
turned in a better performance.Between 1992 and 
1997 it increased the number of telephone lines in 
Jakarta from 560,000 to 1.7 million, a 200 per cent 
increase. But supply is still far below the demand 
of Jakarta’s nearly 10 million people. 
The trouble is, Ali couldn’t possibly afford to be 
hooked up. When asked his telephone number, he 
smiled and shook his head, “These shoes I am 
wearing are the only ones that I saved from the 
wreckage in 1989,” he said. “If I can’t afford to buy 
new shoes, how can you expect me to have a 
telephone?” 
Later on that April evening, when Ali was about 
to leave to meet his wife, he described how he had 
joined thousands of students occupying Indonesia’s 
parliament building in May 1998. He shared their 
objective: to kick out Suharto. 
“Suharto’s daughter built this intersection,” Ali 
said as he left the site where his home and his dream 
were taken away from him a decade ago. One thing 
he didn’t lose on that fateful day was his pride. ®

li may have been unlucky, but things turned 
out much better for him than for millions of 
other Jakartans. 
Nearly half the population of the Indonesian 
capital now lives below the poverty line, which 
means a monthly income of less than $20 per family. 
Property speculation has particularly affected the 
slums where most of the poor live. 
Ms Wardah Hafidz, who runs a Jakarta-based 
NGO, the Urban Poor Consortium, cites asa routine 
example the case of the people of Kampung Sawah, 
in western Jakarta. In 1994, a government office 
claimed the land. Initially the residents refused to 
leave, but finally had to give in after accepting a pit- 
tance in compensation— between $30 and $70— 
despite having lived there for more than 20 years. 
When President Suharto fell in 1998, they filed a 
lawsuit against the government. 
Payment of compensation, how ever small, is by 
no means a universal practice. Evicted people are 
2 8 The Unesco Courier - June 1999 
not in a strong position. The agents of the 
promoters first utter a mixture of threats and 
promises to each family. If the victims decide to 
resist, they usually meet and choose leaders to 
represent them. 
This istaking a great risk, says Hafidz,because 
they are then marked out fora campaign of terror 
by the henchmen of the promoters, or by the 
military. The evicted people are also more 
vulnerable because they are usually squatters. 
Some of them use their meagre compensation 
to resettle in a distant suburb, but most spend the 
money at once and have to look for another illegal 
roof in one of the slums that line the railway tracks 
and the river banks. “ Hardly anyone becomesricher 
as a result of being evicted,” says Ms Hafidz. 
Property speculation is one of the main causes of 
impoverishment. 
Such evictions also tear apart the social 
fabric. Jakarta gradually grew up as kampungs 
(“villages”) developed around the old colonial 
centre. The social ties there were very strong 
because most people came from the same rural 
area. They even won some political and admi- 
nistrative recognition,and each kampung would 
choose a “chief” who represented them before 
the authorities. 
The evictions are destroying this community 
spirit because people are being scattered all 
over the city and its surrounding area. Hafidz 
says the the problem of violence in Jakarta, 
including increased conflict between neigh- 
bours, has worsened with the recent economic 
crisis. But the violence is also caused, she says, 
by weakened solidarity as a result of the des- 
truction of traditional social ties. [|

In the suburbs of the Brazilian capital, even poor families barricade 
themselves behind iron railings. To guard against thieves, but also 
to proclaim that they have conquered a fiefdom in the city 
rasilia is two places. One of them is Brazil's 
Bic capital, built between 1957 and 
1960. This monumental city, dreamed up by 
town planner Lucio Costa and architect Oscar 
Niemeyer and known as the central zone (plano pilo- 
to; see drawing, page 31), has about 300,000 inha- 
bitants (as originally intended), mainly the staff of 
government ministries and foreign embassies. 
Much less known to the world is the other 
Brasilia,the suburbs where middle-class and poor

“Smile, you're on camera,” reads a sign at the entrance to a bakery in Ceilandia. 
The warning continues on the right:“Dear customers:we apologize for the inconvenience 
of these security measures. Please wait.The doors open automatically.” 
Brazilians live. In the original plan, these areas 
were not supposed to have more residents than 
the central zone. But today there are 16 satellite 
cities, forming a huge urban expanse containing 
1.3 million people. And one thing always strikes 
visitors to this metropolitan jigsaw puzzle: the 
number of dwellings—whether elegant villas, 
humble wooden shacks or residential com plexes— 
that are surrounded by metal railings. 
In front of smart houses in Nucleo Bandeirante, 
the oldest satellite city 15 km south of the central 
zone, and in the nearby towns of Taguatinga,Guara 
and Cruzeiro, iron railings often rise from the pave- 
ment as high as the first floor, giving the impression 
that people are living in cages. 
In the poorest and newest suburbs, like Santa 
Maria (which sprang up in 1994), Recanto das 
Emas and Samambaia, many people even put up 
iron railings round their wooden shacks before 
they’ve been completed. The same goes for new 
migrants, who continue to settle, though at a slo- 
wer rate than before (see factfile), on the “edge of 
the edge” of the city, in country areas and even in 
the neighbouring state of Goias. 
The first explanation you hear for these railings 
is the frequency of crime. “Until eight or nine years 
ago, the satellite cities were safe places,” says Jesse 
de Souza, a 35-year-old army officer. “But since 
then,crime has shot up. Burglars don’t bother any 
more with the mansoes, the wealthy villas by the 
lake in the central zone, because theyre too far 
away and the security there is too sophisticated. 
The buildings in the central zone are guarded 
round the clock. 
“But in the satellite cities, it’s much easier for 
thieves. Everything gets stolen—bicycles, cars,car 
radios, CD players, television sets from inside 
houses. They tried to break into our house. It was 
the railings that saved us.” De Souza was born in 
Bahia state and lives in Ceilandia, a satellite city 
of 360,000 people founded in the 1970s to rehou- 
se migrants from the slums. 
The private surveillance 
business 
Maria de Jesus Pereira, a 40-year-old house- 
wife, insisted that her husband put up iron bars 
before they could be burgled. Many people are 
unemployed in Santa Maria and theft is common. 
“And now my four children can play safely,” she 
says, “I can even leave them outside the house, 
behind the railings,while I run a few errands.” 
Since the early 1980s, violence and security 
have been a major issue in Brasilia and even more 
so in other big Brazilian cities and elsewhere in 
Latin America. A whole industry has grown up 
around the demand for private security and sales of 
security equipment—i{rom intercoms to camera 
surveillance systems—are booming. 
The most extreme examples of this trend are the 
condominios fechados, private estates (houses, apart- 
ment blocks, shops and services) hidden behind 
walls and which you can only get into by showing 
an ID to watchmen at a guardpost. Promoters have 
successfully sold the idea of “peace and security”’to 
house-buyers. In the centre of cities and in the sub- 
urbs, such closed communities and other protected 
areas are multiplying. T hey are, as Teresa Caldeira 
describes itl, fortified enclaves for the upper and 
middle classes. T heir existence helps to increase 
urban segregation, with poorer people relegated to 
areas which are still public but poorly equipped 
with infrastructures or even derelict.

In Brasilia, the central zone is itself a kind of for- 
tress, whose walls are invisible. The only border 
between the capital and the satellite cities, which are 
situated at a safe distance, is a belt of green coun- 
tryside.The guarded communities have grown up 
on the edge of this green belt. But surprising though 
it may seem,the satellite cities beyond bristle with 
iron railings. 
Town planner Marilia Steinberg, of the Uni- 
versity of Brasilia, thinks the constant concern 
about security masks more subtle reasons for these 
measures. “Migrating to Brasilia was for all of us a 
gamble, an adventure,” she says. “I don’t know 
anyone who's stayed in the new capital or nearby 
who hasn’t now got a better life. T he railings protect 
you but they also let you show off how quickly 
you’ve gone up in the world, materially and socially.” 
A wall hides everything but you can look through 
railings and see the house and even what is going on 
inside it. You can also see the car or cars—a sign of 
success—parked in the yard. 
Other observers agree that such reassuring, 
effective and probably even essential defences also 
play a symbolic role. The inhabitants of this other 
Brasilia came to the capital to begin a life or make 
a new start, dreaming of success. Yet such dreams 
have almost been outlawed. The building of the 
central zone, from 1957 to 1960, called for the 
hiring of more than 100,000 labourers ( candangos), 
mostly from northeastern Brazil. These workers 
lived in wooden shacks on the edge of the central 
zone. After Brasilia was officially opened on April 21, 
1960, their makeshift houses were dubbed “illegal 
slums”. But most of the workers, proud of their pio- 
neering efforts to build a new capital, refused to leave 
the new El Dorado. Other migrants eventually 
arrived from all over the country and settled on 
vacant land outside the central zone. 
 
Playing safe behind bars in Cruzeiro. 
Faced with the influx, the federal district autho- 
rities decided in 1970 to improve conditions rather 
than trying to evict everyone. They built up the 
infrastructure of the satellite cities so as to head off 
any haphazard “invasion” of the central zone. 
The prevailing impression is that each migrant 
family somehow wants to show by means of railings 
that it has carved out a fiefdom, however small, and 
that its dream has come true here in the federal district, 
at the gates of what is known as “official Brazil”. 
T he story of Cleiton Pereira Santos, a 23-year- 
old geographer,illustrates this social ascension and 
Uninviting:high railings rise up around a private housing estate at Sobradinho, one of Brasilia’s satellite-cities.

values very well. “My father, who was from a small 
town in the northeastern state of Piaui, came to Bra- 
silia to work as a mason in the early 1960s,” he 
says. “At first he stayed with a relative, and then went 
back to fetch my mother. The two of them rented a 
small apartment in the central zone. But they wanted 
their ‘own’ home, so they built their first house, 
which was quite modest,in Taguatinga.Later they 
sold it and built a detached house with railings in 
Ceilandia. My father, who has built up a small 
business,now wants to sell that, buy some more land 
and build a guarded house on it.” 
Status 
symbols 
Brazilians of all classes want to own their own 
homes. Official figures show 72 per cent of all 
houses are privately owned, and government bodies 
like the National Housing Bank have always encou- 
raged home ownership rather than paying rent, 
even in the area of public housing. 
But in Brasilia and in the rest of the country, 
buying your own house is also a way to protect 
yourself against another kind of insecurity—eco- 
nomic uncertainty. Continual crises have driven 
home a blunt message: that you can easily lose 
your job but it’s much harder to lose your house 
if you own it in a country where a government 
social safety-net hardly exists. All the more rea- 
son, then, to see that your house is secure and 
that it keeps its value.A house is worth more with 
iron bars around it than without.All houses in the 
“other Brasilia” fetch a good price, even wooden 
shacks. 
T he railings are part of this world of symbols and 
values. T hey are also to some extent a counterpoint to 
Costa and Niemeyer’s central zone, with its avant- 
garde concrete buildings and monuments. T he inha- 
bitants of the other Brasilia only go into the capital, the 
city of the ruling class, to work there or to catch a bus 
home. The railings are perhaps the response of the 
poor to the social and geographical segregation 
imposed on them by a fortress-capital, a symbol of suc- 
cess outside a citadel without walls. u

Town planner Lucio Costa’s 1957 blueprint for Brasilia,known as the central zone (plano 
piloto) was based on what he called “two axes which intersect at right angles to make a 
cross” or what looks more like a large bird.Along the main axis are the city’s chief centres of 
activity—with at one end the huge Square of the Three Powers (executive, legislative and 
judiciary) and the Ministries’ Esplanade. On each side of the arms of the cross (or wings of 
the bird) are residential areas divided into superquadras (groups of housing blocks).The idea 
was to build a city without road junctions, where “the car is no longer the implacable enemy 
of people”.Inside the central road intersection complex is a huge bus station called 
Plataforma, which more than 400,000 people pass through every day, coming in from the 
satellite cities. Brazilia is on UNesco’s World Heritage List. 
Factfile 
The federal district of Brasilia covers 5,788 sq km and includes the central zone of Bra- 
silia itself, 16 “ satellite towns” and a rural area. 
Population (official census figures) 
The number of people living in the federal district rose from 546,000 in 1970 to 1,176,800 
in 1980 and 1,822,000 in 1996. The population growth rate is slowing down, asin Brazil's other 
major cities. In Brasilia,it fell from 8.1% between 1970 and 1980 to 2.84% between 1980 
and 1991.Internal migration in Brazil over the past 10 years has been mainly to the states 
of Mato Grosso and Rondonia,which has relieved pressure on cities like Sdo Paulo and Rio 
de Janeiro. 
Political situation 
After the 1964 military coup, Brazil had 21 years of army rule. Civilian government 
returned with elections in 1985. 
According to the terms of the new national constitution of 1988, the federal district isrun 
by a popularly-elected governor (he had been appointed by the central government since 1960) 
and his deputy. Joaquim Roriz became the first elected governor in 1990.Defeated in a re- 
election bid in 1994, he was succeeded by Cristovam Buarque, but returned to office in 1998. 
The governor, deputy governor and the administrators of all the federal district's constituencies 
make up the district’s executive body. Legislative power is in the hands of 24 deputies 
elected every four years at the same time as the governor. 
Economic data 
Twenty-two per cent of the federal district's workforce are civil servants, 14% work in busi- 
ness and 53% in other service activities Economic life is dominated by small businesses or 
very small operations set up by the inhabitants of the satellite towns. Unemployment is put 
at 22% of the workforce, however, according to an official body, CODEPAN (central plateau 
development commission). 
Official figures show that a third of all those living in the federal district own a car and 
92% have television. Basic utilities are available to nearly everyone— 93% have access to drin- 
king water and 84% are connected to a sewage system. [|

### 116255: Shanghai's migrant millions

  
millions 
Shanghai's migrant 
  
James Irwin 
Shanghai-based Canadian journalist 
As it learns to manage the massive influx of ‘temporary residents’ 
that provide muscle for its explosive economic growth, 
China’s city of opportunity is treading a delicate balance between 
control and grassroots involvement 
mong the well-dressed university students 
A- gling just outside the gates of Shanghai’s 
prestigious Fudan University, three men stand 
out. Dressed in surplus army uniforms, they perch 
on the curb behind small cardboard signs stuck in 
pavement cracks. The crude signs advertising their 
labour for odd jobs or construction work can be has- 
tily snatched up and hidden should the police make 
a sudden appearance. 
The men, migrants in their 20s and 30s from the 
nearby city of Suzhou, never know when they might 
have to make a quick get-away. Unemployed for the 
past month and flat broke, they haven’t paid the tem- 
porary residence permit fee, which makes them 
subject to possible eviction from Shanghai. 
“We don’t have much money for anything, inclu- 
ding the 15 RMB! (US$1.75) for the monthly per- 
mits, so it’s better if we stay clear of the police,” says 
the eldest of the three. 
A steady 
stream of manpower 
Temporary residents, the so-called “floating” 
population, are everywhere in China’s richest city. On 
bicycle and afoot they stream through the city, ringing 
bells and shouting out offers to sharpen knives, sell 
fruit and vegetables from their carts or haul away old 
junk and garbage. Like the three men from Suzhou, 
they are ready to do almost anything, provided it will 
keep them in China’s city of opportunity. 
Such is the allure of Shanghai that an estimated 
3.3 million ofits 13.6 million population are migrants. 
Thanks to a thriving economy propelled not only by 
economic reform but also an ambitious national policy 
to transform Shanghai into a major Asian financial 
centre, the city has turned into a huge construction 
site. Migrants have filled the need for sheer manpower. 
But for the most populous city in the world’s most 
populous country, the massive migrant population 
brings new problems, from huge strains on 
infrastructure to an exacerbation of a widening social 
chasm between the haves and the have-nots. 
China is going through “urbanization of a scale 
never seen before in its history,” says Wu Weiping, a 
native of Shanghai who teaches Urban Studies and 
Planning at the Virginia Commonwealth University 
1.The Chinese currency is called Renminbi (RMB). 
3 2 The Unesco Courier - June 1999 
in the United States. Already some 30 per cent of the 
country’s 1.3 billion people live in the cities. T hat 
proportion is likely to reach 50 per cent in the not- 
too-distant future, according to Wu. 
In a word, the challenge is of truly epic 
proportions. But so far Shanghai does at least seem 
to be averting many of the worst problems of urban 
swell common in other developing countries. T hen 
again, not every city in the world has at its disposal 
the tool that has been a key to Shanghai's qualified 
success: a set of controls perhaps only possible under 
a system of authoritarian government. 
“China is one of the few places where there is a 
deliberate government policy that addresses 
urbanization,” says Wu. One solution has been to 
encourage the growth of small and medium-sized 
cities around the country to take some of the 
demographic pressure off the largest city. The other 
pillar of the urbanization policy is to control migrant 
populations once they have reached a city. It is in 
this latter area that Shanghai has shown its skill. 
Migrants started making their mark on cities 
soon after they were first allowed to move there in 
1978, the beginning of China’s economic reform 
programme. Control on mobility was effected 
through the hukou, or place-of-origin system.One 
had to remain in one’s place of origin unless granted 
permission to move. Apart from being illegal, 
migration without official approval made life quite 
literally unlivable: without the appropriate hukou 
card one was denied access to essentials such as 
ration tickets for rice,meat and cotton cloth. 
 
‘China is one of the few places where there is a deliberate 
government policy that addresses urbanization’ 
But the former constraints on migration were 
arbitrary, imposed from the top down, and were 
certainly not compatible with the market economy 
that was to develop after the Cultural Revolution. 
As the economy exploded, jobs opened up for 
unskilled labourers,particularly in coastal areas 
where most of the foreign and domestic investment 
has poured in. In response, the authorities have 
encouraged migration to bring in cheap labour. 
Meanwhile, higher crop yields and rising population 
on a dwindling arable land mass have left the 
countryside with at least 100 million surplus

The hukou card system is still in place, but cities 
like Shanghai today also issue temporary permits 
to accommodate migrants. The temporary permit 
system gives the government the best of both worlds: 
flexibility and a relatively strong level of control. 
Migrants must first get permission from their 
local government back home to work away from 
their area of origin. Upon arrival, the fortunate stay 
with family or friends from back home, while others 
sleep rough as the authorities provide no 
accommodation for transients. 
Should they want to stay more than three days, 
migrants are required to get a three-month residence 
registration, which can then be extended for a two- 
year permit issued by an enterprise or local police 
station. Permits are granted only upon proof of legal 
accommodation in the city and of employment.On 
top of this, migrants need to apply for an urban 
employment permit, renewable yearly for a fee 
equivalent to $8.40. Unlike blue- or white-collar 
employees, street vendors and small retailers apply 
for business licences instead of employment permits.

all these bureaucratic check points are migrants

legally allowed to remain in the city. 
The temporary permit system means that in times 
of economic downturn—such as that which has left 
the three Suzhou men jobless for about three-quarters 
of the past year—the authorities have some leverage 
to force migrants to go back to their homes. An 
estimated one in four of Shanghai’s floating 
population doesn’t bother to register with the 
authorities. 
Ignoring the law seems to be much easier than it 
was,certainly in the pre-economic reform era. So 
much of the economy is now private that one is not 
necessarily forced into contact with the state. At the 
same time, the success of economic liberalization 
means that food and other basic goods are so abundant 
that ration coupons are no longer needed—again, 
reducing reliance on state organs. Also, the numbers of 
migrants are so huge that it is impossible for the police 
and other authorities to keep tabs on them all. 
It 1s possible for migrants to achieve long-term 
residency, but the hurdles are substantial and ensure 
that most will never make the grade. For example, to 
make the leap, migrants must purchase an 
apartment or house, which requires considerable 
cash; get corporate sponsorship, which is usually 
granted only to the well educated; or marry a local, 
which requires overcoming the considerable

» prejudice of the snobbish Shanghainese who shower 
disdain upon the floating population. 
But while the state keeps close watch on migrants, it 
also intervenes to make sure they have at least the basics 
of survival. T hat help is motivated not only by a sense 
of charity or social duty: the last thing the state wants 
1s for social problems to fester and explode into mass 
movements potentially challenging the political order. 
Life for migrants, while in many ways difficult, is 
nevertheless not impossible. For example, on the city’s 
northeastern outskirts at the long-abandoned Jiangwan 
airport, sits a temporary residents’ camp sanctioned by 
the municpal government three years ago. The

outgoing, and are all properly shod and healthy 
looking—apparently enjoying the same sort of 
parental attention that China’s one-child family

The majority of the adults, who come from 
nearby provinces such as Jiangsu as well as poorer, 
hinterland provinces including Henan, Anhui,Sze-

Factfile 
Population 
The Shanghai agglomeration is the most densely-populated part of China. Some 13.6 mil- 
lion people live there, in an area of 6,340 sq km. This includes the city itself (375 sq km), seven 
industrial satellite cities and some small outlying towns. There were just over five million people 
in 1950,s0 the population has more than doubled in less than 50 years. It is expected to top 
18 million by 2015, according to the latest UN projections (see World Urbanization Prospects, 
New York,1998). 
Political situation 
The self-governing municipality of Shanghai answers directly to the central government. 
China’s current president, Jiang Zemin,as well as his prime minister, Zhu Rongji,were both 
once mayors of the city. The present mayor, Xu Kuangdi,studied in England and then taught 
engineering at Shanghai University. 
Economic data 
Shanghai is China's biggest port.It has a long trading and industrial history and was the 
port of entry during the Empire, from 1842,when the Treaty of Nanking was signed.More 
recently, the opening-up of the city launched in the 1970s with the approval of the central 
government has boosted its development. The main features of this are heavy industry 
(metallurgical and steel plants, petrochemicals, building ships and planes) and textile, elec- 
tronic and computer industries. In 1990, the government announced it was setting up a spe- 
cial new economic zone called Pudong which would be China’s new financial centre. 
The economy of the Shanghai area grew by an annual 14% between 1992 and 1996, while 
direct foreign investment reached $10 billion a year. In 1997, this investment rate fell by half, 
pulling the growth rate down to 12.7%. It fell further last year, to about 9%, according to offi- 
cial estimates. Fallout from the Asian financial crisis and recent industrial restructuring has 
increased unemployment, which is officially 8% but is unofficially estimated to be double that. 
Annual per capita income remains way ahead of the rest of China how ever at $3,000, compared 
with only $860 for the country as a whole. 
New sectors have recently been earmarked as priority areas, including telecommunications, new 
technologies and the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. |

Like other such camps, Jiangwan is under the 
jurisdiction of the local district committee, which is 
responsible for ensuring the residents are regis- 
tered, taxes and temporary residency permits are 
paid,and security is maintained. 
Each family pays approximately $70 to the private 
landlords who built and own the rows of houses 
where it and its neighbours live. In a country where 
the state has traditionally provided housing for 
nominal amounts of money, these rents are very 
expensive.Likewise, the half-yearly tuition of about 
$50 is fairly onerous. Yet migrants don’t seem to 
complain much, perhaps because overall life in the 
city is better or more promising than that back at 
home. 
Apart from the temporary permit system, there 
are a number of factors which help the municipa- 
lity manage the floating population issue, not the 
least of which is the city’s policy of grassroots mana- 
gement. In a pyramid-shaped organizational struc- 
ture with the city at the apex, the district just below, 
the street next and the neighbourhood forming the 
wide base, the city has found a way of keeping local 
involvement high. 
Through this last level of government, the neigh- 
bourhood committee, the authorities oversee day- 
to-day contact with the transient population.Once 
known for being composed of busybodies who 
interfered at every opportunity in people’s lives— 
denouncing and ensuring punishment of every- 
thing from extramarital affairs to even mild forms 
of political or even social dissent—the committees 
have been professionalized in recent years. Where 
once they were usually composed of retired people, 
now they are manned by paid staff, usually dis- 
placed state employees who have been specially 
trained,notes Wu. Instead of being seen largely as 
an instrument of interference in people’s private 
lives, the committees nowadays concern themselves 
with practical,everyday affairs. 
Wu believes this approach is miles from central 
planning-type diktat, a remarkably efficient form of 
maintaining control while answering genuine needs 
for social service. As the population under any one

Shanghai's train station serves as a dormitory for many 
migrant workers. 
resident committee rarely exceeds 2,000 people, the 
organization is characterized by a strong sense of 
familiarity. 
Another tool for managing migrants is urging 
employers to provide housing for their staff. Wu esti- 
mates that 36 per cent of migrants in Shanghai live at 
or close to their place of work and that nearly half of 
all rural labour migrants live in housing provided by 
urban enterprises. Two-thirds of those listing construc- 
tion as their occupation live at construction sites. 
But while migrants may fare better here than in 
other parts of the developing world, there is little 
doubt that they in effect do not enjoy the same 
status as Shanghainese.Migrants are second-class 
citizens, grudgingly accepted for their labour but 
mistrusted because of the stresses they add to the 
city’s infrastructure. Other residents of Shanghai are 
often subsidized for the cost of their children’s e-

ducation by their employers or the government. 
The same goes for medical services. Not so the 
temporary residents, who must pay the full cost 
should medical treatment be necessary. And their 
children,many of whom are born in Shanghai, are 
destined to be forever locked on the outside looking 
in. Migrant children are unlikely to mingle with 
their Shanghainese peers. A Shanghainese parent 
would be distraught if his child married a migrant— 
which is not all that likely anyway as the two worlds 
are, for all the physical proximity, culturally leagues 
apart, difference of dialect being just one of the 
many factors. Besides, there is a big price to pay: 
when a Shanghainese man marries a migrant 
woman,their child inherits her place of orgin. 
Part of the disdain comes from the sheer lack of 
sophistication of the migrants in terms of dialect and 
demeanour, and their misplaced expectations. For 
example, male economic migrants typically buy a 
suit before hitting the big city in hopes of landing a 
desk job. They often end up wearing the suits—the 
labels still stitched to the sleeves—not in fancy 
office blocks, but on construction sites. Another 
cause for animosity is that problems such as rising 
crime are attributed to migrants. 
One does not have to look very far for signs of 
contempt or discrimination. Outside a high school 
in downtown Shanghai—gleaming with new buil- 
dings and proud of its new sports stadiums, express- 
ways and a metro system, all built by migrants—a 
policeman on a motorcycle is checking the papers 
of a migrant worker who has been selling brightly 
coloured shoelaces to the students. Not even dei- 
gning to get off his bike, the policeman speaks 
sharply to the middle-aged woman. 
Distraught and crying she pleads her case to 
the uniformed figure of authority who snaps closed 
his notepad and speeds off down the street. 
Still weeping, the woman gathers her meagre 
goods and begins walking away, watched by a small 
crowd of Shanghai residents. Where she’ll go is 
anyone’s guess. [|

### 116256: Urbanization and globalization

Urbanization and globalization 
  
Jorge Wilheim 
Architect and town planner in So Paulo, author of plans for a number of towns and 
cities, including Curitiba,in Brazil. He was also deputy secretary-general of the UN 
Habitat Il conference (Istanbul, 1996). 
How we handle globalization will determine whether our cities and our 
civilization will be divided and violent or user-friendly and peaceful 
e cannot get a clear picture of urban life in 
Ww the 21st century, especially in the poor 
countries of the South, unless we take into 
account the phenomenon of globalization, which 
has already brought dramatic changes. Cities,and 
especially mega-cities, are where those changes make 
their first appearance. So it is there too that the great 
upheavals of the next century will take place. 
Globalization gives shape to the “global village” 
predicted by the Canadian Marshall McLuhan. The 
“information era” that it ushers in compresses time 
and we are now living in a world speeded up as never 
before. World-wide urbanization is proceeding at a 
similar rate and its pace in the poor countries of the 
South seems terrifying. By 2025, two-thirds of 
humanity will be living in cities and towns, where 
the best opportunities in life tend to be. 
Globalization also accentuates a “new urban 
geography” in both North and South. Islands of rich 
consumers are springing up in cities amid an ocean 
of deprived people. More and more unemployed 
people, immigrants, minorities and the homeless, 
are pushed into cities by pressure from “market 
economies”. As a result, all urban areas—not just 
those in the poor countries of the South—will have 
to deal with growing internal tensions. In New York, 
for example, the poorest 20 per cent of the 
population earns 15 times less than the richest 20 
per cent. 
Cities have always had their smart 
neighbourhoods and their dangerous areas—the 
old cities of Europe even more so than those of the 
Americas, where there is more geographical and 
social mobility. But such social and geographical 
segregation has changed in pace and scale because 
of the growth in the urban population, the increase 
in “illegal”’migrants and rising uncertainty. 
In fact, we have entered a period of historical 
transition, where discontinuities prevail over 
adjustment. Radical changes in the nature of 
production and jobs and the incredible 
concentration of capital in the hands of the financial 
sector and speculators weigh much heavier in our 
lives these days than the state’s efforts to adjust and 
improve the market economy. Segregation in cities 
has been given a new lease of life whose 
consequences we do not know. It has reached 
unprecedented dimensions because of the explosive 
growth of urban areas. 
According to one scenario, things will go badly. 
The growing pace of globalization will increase 
uncertainty about the future. Fear and defence 
3 6 The Unesco Courier - une 1999 
mechanisms will grow among people and institutions, 
fuelling intolerance, xenophobia and mistrust of 
everything new or foreign. Urban tensions will manifest 
themselves with increasing violence, and segregation 
will sharpen. Public areas will be abandoned and 
become dangerous no-man’s-lands, the wretched abode 
of society’s rejects. Cities will lose their original function 
of being a crossroads for meeting and exchange. 
If globalization also continues to go hand in hand 
with deregulation of financial markets and an 
unchanged level of indebtedness of poor countries,the 
latter will not be able to maintain their urban 
infrastructures. And if on top of this there is corruption 
and lack of political will,challenges to the system will 
increase and violence will grow. Cash-strapped 
authorities will respond with undemocratic measures 
and will even ally themselves with financial mafias which 
provide them with funds. 
According to a second scenario, everything will be all 
right. In line with the principle that “everything the state 
does is public, but the state doesn’t control everything 
that is public,” a new social contract will be drawn up 
between the state, the market, the working population 
and civil society, including NGOs. Cities will develop a 
new quality of life by providing citizens with a forum 
for exchange. Jobs will be created in the social sector, 
in the fields of the environment, education,research, 
culture and leisure, opening up possibilities for young 
people. 
In the countries of the South, long-term development 
strategies will be drafted and urban planning practised, 
taking advantage of the opportunities provided by 
globalization but without falling into its traps. Town 
planning will become part of the political process, and 
the state will work with the private sector, monitored by 
institutions of civil society. Adequate housing will be built 
with the help of micro-credit and controls on the price 
of building materials. Improved infrastructures will enable 
marginal areas to become part of the civilized part of the 
city. Democracy will come up with new ways of governing 
with the help of networks of involved citizens. 
In a transitional scenario, action strategies should 
fall somewhere between these two extremes. T hey 
should include social goals so that in big urban areas a 
society emerges which is founded on participatory 
democracy and on “capitalism with a human face” or 
“market socialism”. 
But the outlook is less clear than ever. Let us hope 
the present transition will lead rapidly to a new revival 
of humanism, whose first signs we are already seeing. 
This would open up the road to a development which 
1s fair,humane and peaceful. u 
This is the era of 
architecture. There 
can be no new 
architecture without 
a new form of town 
planning. Over time, 
new cities have 
always replaced 
older ones. But 
today, the radiant, 
happy city of 
modern times is 
ready to be born.

planner (1887-1965)

### 116257: Dead-end seeds yield a harvest of revolt

Dead-end seeds 
yield a harvest of revolt 
Farmers in developing countries are up in arms against a new technique 
to produce sterile seeds. Scientists, however, warn that blind opposition 
to biotech research will do more harm than good 
It was a dream come true for seed 
companies. Spurred by the ongoing 
biotechnology revolution, scientists have 
developed an innovative technique enabling 
companies to produce genetically altered seeds 
that do not germinate once fully grown. The 
result: farmers who opt for these seeds will 
have to buy them each time they plant a new 
crop, opening a potential gold mine for the 
seed companies. 
The technique, known as the “T echnology 
Protection System” (TPS), was jointly 
patented by the Delta and Pine Land (DPL) 
seed company and the U.S.Department of 
Agriculture (USDA) in March 1998. Seeds 
incorporating this technique are expected to 
be commercialized by 2005. While the 
innovation is welcomed by seed 
manufacturers, farmers in many developing 
countries have been conducting campaigns 
and staging protests—sometimes turning to 
violence—against the TPS, fearing the new 
technique could be detrimental to their 
interests. 
At present, except for some hybrid crops 
like cotton and canola, farmers do not usually 
buy seeds for self-pollinating plants like wheat 
and rice. Farmers in the developing world 
consider it their “right” to save or exchange 
seeds, a practice that has been followed for 
more than 10,000 years. 
According to the UN, more than 1.4 
billion people, mainly resource-poor farmers, 
depend on farm-saved seeds and seeds 
exchanged with their neighbours as their 
primary seed source. Critics say that sterile 
seeds are a serious threat to this group of 
farmers,asserting that the innovation will 
further impoverish them. 
“The introduction of any technology that

prevents farmers from keeping their own seeds 
is not desirable. Farmers’ rights include ‘plant 
back’ rights. The TPS will certainly prevent 
this right,” says Dr M. S. Swaminathan,an 
eminent scientist who played a leading role 
in India’s Green Revolution. 
In India, where 90 per cent of the 100 
million farmers depend on saved seeds, farm 
lobby groups are vehemently opposed to this 
new technology entering local seed markets. 
In the southern Indian state of Karnataka, 
experimental plots of genetically engineered 
crops belonging to Monsanto, one of the 
world’s leading seed companies, were 
ransacked by a group of farmers last year in 
the mistaken belief that they contained the new 
sterile seed technology. Actually, the test site 
was for a pest-resistant hybrid cotton seed 
which had nothing to do with TPS. The public 
outcry forced the government to declare that it

would not allow the technology to enter India. 
Opposition to TPS has been gaining pace 
in other parts of the developing world where 
seed saving is an age-old custom. In a 
statement to a conference held by the Food 
and Agricultural Organization (FAO) in 1998, 
delegates from 20 African countries said the 
new technique poses a serious threat to food 
security, affirming “it will destroy the diversity, 
the local knowledge and the sustainable 
agricultural systems of African farmers.” 
Scientifically, the TPS is considered a 
milestone in biotechnology research. T he new 
method produces plants that bear sterile seeds 
through an interplay between three 
transplanted genes, one of which produces a 
toxin that kills seeds in their final stages of 
development.Critics however refer to it as 
“terminator technology” because of the

technique’s ability to neutralize a plant’s 
germinating capacity—a characteristic 
introduced for purely commercial reasons. 
“The new technique is to protect U.S. 
technology and seed patents,” explains Melvin 
Oliver, one of the USDA scientists who 
invented the technology. The TPS is now being 
tested on tobacco and cotton seeds which are 
expected to enter the market by 2005. 
When news of the terminator patent 
broke, it sparked a multi-media debate, 
especially on the Internet,concerning the 
ethics and social relevance of introducing the 
TPS in developing countries. The USDA 
received hundreds of e-mail letters from 
around the world questioning the validity of 
the new method. 
Taken aback by the anti-sterile technology 
campaign, Monsanto seed corporation, which

1s in the process of acquiring DPL, announced 
in April this year that it will not commercialize 
the TPS until an independent international 
review of its environmental, economic and 
social effects is completed. 
In defending the TPS, seed companies 
underline that it costs them between $30 and 
$100 million to develop a high-yielding 
genetically engineered seed variety. The 
present system of seed saving, which is 
prevalent in most developing countries, makes 
it difficult for them to gain sufficient returns on 
their investment. Losses have even forced 
some companies to suspend crop 
development programmes. 
The threat to biodiversity 
But a number of farming experts and 
organizations reject this logic. “I do not 
consider that the cost spent by seed com - 
panies can be recovered only by terminator 
technology. In fact, most successful seed 
companies are those whose seeds have a 
reputation for quality and affordable price,” 
says Swaminathan. 
Critics of terminator technology also 
argue that poor farmers in the tropics not 
only produce 15 to 20 per cent of the world’s 
food supply, they also maintain crop varieties 
that are a source of genetic diversity for the 
world’s plant breeders and genetic engineers. 
For example, the Manila-based International 
Rice Research Institute (IRRI) relies on tra- 
ditional rice varieties collected from farmers 
in many parts of the world to develop new 
high-yielding seeds (see pages 46 to 50). 
“If farmers eat or abandon their tradi- 
tional seeds in the process of adopting ter- 
minator seeds, centuries of crop genetic diver- 
sity could be lost forever,” says Pat Mooney, 
Executive Director of the Canada-based 
Rural Advancement Foundation Interna- 
tional (RAFI), a non-governmental organi- 
zation which is spearheading an international 
campaign against terminator technology. 
Pointing to another worse-case scenario, 
some scientists fear that the TPS trait could 
spread to other crops if pollen carrying a ter- 
minator gene lands on plants in neighbouring 
fields. “Plants in the neighbouring crop would 
then produce seeds that would not germi- 
nate,” says Rob Marchant, a research associate 
at Nottingham University (United Kingdom). 
If this happens, there is a danger that far- 
mers who opt for normal seeds may end up 
having sterile ones because of crops with the 
terminator trait in adjacent fields. 
To safeguard farmers in developing 
countries,Swaminathan would like to press 
UNEScO’s Bioethics committee to draft a 
Universal Declaration on the Plant Genome 
and Farmers’Rights, similar in spirit to the 
one adopted by UNEsco in 1997 on the

## [Page 39](https://demo.humlab.umu.se/courier/116241eng.pdf#page=39) 0

### 116257: Dead-end seeds yield a harvest of revolt

Human Genome and Human Rights. This 
Declaration expresses rights and principles 
that should govern research on the human 
genome, emphasizing the pre-eminence of 
human dignity. 
A backlash against 
biotechnology 
While the debate over the TPS is heating 
up, scientists are concerned that the contro- 
versy is leading to growing anti-biotechno- 
logy feelings in many developing countries. 
Some environmental groups in South Asia 
have even called for a total ban on geneti- 
cally engineered seeds, fearing they could 
cause harm to human beings. 
“There are growing misconceptions 
about genetic research. T he myths have to be 
dispelled. T he fact is that biotechnology is the 
only solution if we want to increase world 
food production to meet future demands,” 
asserts Dr Arie Altman, professor of horti- 
culture at the Hebrew University of Jeru- 
salem. Pointing to declining food production 
in some Asian countries, he says that the 
process of the Green Revolution, which 
helped many nations in the region boost 
food output in the 1960s and 70s, has clearly 
reached saturation level. “So genetically engi- 
neered crops are the only solution to increase 
of new varieties,” says Oliver. 
TPS proponents also argue that seeds 
incorporating a terminator trait will not be 
forced on farmers. “If they do not want them, 
they can always continue with other seed 
varieties,” says Harry Collins, vice president 
of technology transfer at the Mississippi- 
based DPL. However, if the best seeds avai- 
lable on the market all carry a terminator 
trait, farmers who refuse to buy them will 
be left with ones of inferior quality. 
The trend towards concentration on 
the seed market is also likely to limit choice. 
RAFI maintains that the top 10 seed cor- 
porations control 30 per cent of the $23 bil- 
lion seed market worldwide. In the last few 
years Monsanto has become one of the 
‘After the terminator patent, 29 patents along similar lines have 
been obtained by 12 European and U.S seed companies seeking 
to exploit new engineering techniques for profit motives’ 
yield,” claims Altman. 
But who will take the initiative of deve- 
loping new seed varieties? Government 
spending worldwide has been minimal in 
agricultural biotechnology, while the private 
sector has been pumping millions of dollars 
into research and development in this field. 
Now, they are not willing to invest more in 
self-pollinating crops like wheat and rice 
unless returns are ensured, and perceive 
the TPS as one way of achieving this. 
DPL officials claim that pest-resistant 
wheat and rice seeds can be developed in the 
next six to seven years, significantly boosting 
global food production. But they contend 
that once such high-yielding varieties enter the 
market, it will be difficult to monitor the 
patenting rights because they are mass-culti- 
vated crops. At present, some seed companies 
oblige farmers to sign a contract affirming that 
they will not re-use the seeds purchased. To 
enforce this, companies send inspectors to 
monitor farmers’ activities. While such a 
system is already difficult to implement in 
the U.S., where rigid patent rights exist, it is 
next to impossible in the developing world. 
“TheTPS is essential to safeguard the patents 
world’s largest seed com panies, and is the- 
refore in a position to make direct use of ter- 
minator technology across the globe. 
Realizing that this technology could be 
a money-spinner, other seed companies 
have jumped into the fray. “After the ter- 
minator patent, 29 patents along similar 
lines have been obtained by 12 European 
and U.S. seed companies seeking to exploit 
new engineering techniques for profit 
motives,” says Mooney. 
RAFI is not is the only outfit lobbying 
against the TPS.The Consultative Group for 
International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), 
the world’s largest organization in this field, is 
opposed to introducing the technology in 
developing countries and has banned its use 
in its 16 agricultural research institutes. 
In January 1999, more than 50 non- 
governmental organizations and farm-lobby 
groups from South American nations assem- 
bled in Ecuador to form a coalition against ter- 
minator technology entering the continent. 
“Poor farmers will get nothing out of it. We 
are not only against terminator but against all 
transgenic seed varieties. It doesn’t give poor 
farmers any ad vantages,” says Silvia Ribeiro,

who works with a coalition of farmers’orga- 
nizations and NGOs in southern Brazil. The 
network has scheduled a series of public mee- 
tings and demonstrations throughout Brazil 
in the coming months to create awareness 
among farmers about the TPS. Some local 
governments in Brazil have already banned the 
entry of terminator seeds once they become 
available in five to six years. 
Biotech proponents argue that the nega- 
tive reaction to terminator seeds 1s prema- 
ture. “If the new seeds are going to increase 
the yield by 15-20 per cent, farmers will not 
mind paying for the seeds,” says C.S.Pra- 
kash, Director of Plant Biotechnology 
Research at Tuskegee University in the U.S., 
and consultant for Monsanto. 
Farmers in the U.S. are already expe- 
riencing the benefits of insect-resistant and 
herbicide-resistant crops through higher 
yields and profits. Transgenic insect-resistant 
maize saved U.S. farmers an estimated 
$190 million in 1997 and substantially 
reduced insecticide use. 
Not all developing countries oppose agri- 
cultural biotechnology. Farmers in China 
and Argentina, for example, have responded 
favourably to genetically engineered seeds. 
Chinese farmers have been successful in cul- 
tivating hybrid cotton seeds and buy them 
every year from the companies. “Farmers are 
the best judges. They know what is econo- 
mically beneficial for them. If they find that the 
terminator trait is unviable, they themselves 
will reject it,” says Prakash. L

### IGNORE

SIGNS OF THE TIMES 


### 116258: Cracking the code of art's allure

Cracking the code 
of art's allur 
‘If a Martian ethologist were to land on 
earth and watch us humans,he would 
be puzzled by many aspects of human 
nature, but surely art—our propensity to 
create and enjoy paintings and sculpture— 
would be among the most puzzling. What 
biological function could this mysterious 
behaviour possibly serve? 
“Cultural factors undoubtedly influence 
what kind of art a person enjoys. But,even 
if beauty is largely in the eye of the beholder, 
might there be some sort of universal rule 
or ‘deep structure’, underlying all artistic 
experience?’ 
Vilayanur S. Ramachandran, Director of 
the Center for Brain and Cognition at the 
University of California at San Diego, has 
made a bold and controversial attempt to 
answer these intriguing questions by 
proposing a new scientific theory of art. The 
theory explains many familiar experiences, 
such as why a cartoon squiggle can evoke a 
well-known face more quickly than a full 
colour photograph, and why many men find 
the hour-glass figure of Marilyn Monroe sexy. 
Professor Ramachandran’s theory 
addresses three questions: (a) What are the 
“rules of art” that make something pretty? (b) 
Why did these rules evolve and have the form 
that they do? (c) What is the brain circuitry 
involved? Previous theories of art have looked 
at one or two of these questions, but this is the 
first time all three have been tackled together. 
With his colleague William Hirstein, 
Ramachandran proposes a list of “Eight laws 
of artistic experience . . . that artists either 
consciously or unconsciously deploy to opti- 
mally titillate the visual areas of the brain,” in 
particular that part of the brain known as the 
limbic system. Of the eight (see box page 
42), three seem to be especially significant: a 
psychological phenomenon called the “peak 
shift effect”; the principle of “grouping”;and 
the benefit of focusing on a single visual cue.! 
The ‘peak shift effect’ 
The “peak shift effect” is a well-known 
principle in animal discrimination learning. 
For example, if a rat is taught to discriminate 
a square from arectangle and rewarded for the 
rectangle, it will soon learn to respond more 
frequently to the rectangle. Moreover, if the 
rat is trained with a prototype rectangle of; say,

aspect ratio 3:2, it will respond even more 
positively to alonger and skinnier figure—say, 
of aspect ratio 4:1. This curious result implies 
that what the rat is learning to value is not a 
particular rectangle but a rule: rectangles are 
better than squares. So the greater the ratio 
between the long and the short sides, i.e.the 
less square-like it is, the “better” the rectangle 
is in the rat’s eyes. This is the “peak shift 
effect”. Ramachandran argues that this prin- 
ciple holds the key for understanding the 
evocativeness of much of visual art. 
How does the peak shift effect relate to 
human pattern recognition and aesthetic pre- 
ference? Consider the way in which a skilled

A bold new theory to identify the 
common denominator of all visual art 
cartoonist produces a caricature of a famous 
face, say the late U.S. President Richard 
Nixon’s. What a cartoonist does (uncons- 
ciously) is to take the average of all faces, sub- 
tract it from Nixon's face (to get the difference 
between Nixon’s face and all others) and 
then amplify the differences to produce a cari- 
cature. The final result, of course, is a drawing 
that is even more Nixon-like than the ori- 
ginal. The artist has amplified the differences 
that characterize Nixon’s face in the same 
way that an even skinnier rectangle is an 
amplified version of the original prototype 
that the rat is exposed to. Hence Ramachan- 
dran’s aphorism that “All art is caricature”. 
(This is not literally true, as he admits, but it 
applies surprisingly often.) In other words, 
what the artist tries to do is not only capture 
the essence of something but amplify it in 
order to activate neural mechanisms more 
powerfully than the original object. 
Look at the Chola bronze—the accen- 
tuated hips and bust of the Goddess Parvati 
(Fig. 1) and you will see at once that this is 
essentially a caricature of the female form. 
Here the artist has chosen to amplify the 
“very essence” (called the rasa by Hindu 
artists) of being feminine, by moving the 
image abnormally far toward the feminine 
end of the female/male spectrum. The 
artistic amplification produces a “super sti- 
mulus” to which, Ramachandran conjec- 
tures,certain brain circuits respond. Artists 
may also try to evoke a strong direct emo- 
tional response by exploiting the peak shift 
effect along dimensions other than form. 
For instance,a Boucher, aVan Gogh, or a 
Monet may be thought of as a caricature in 
“colour space”. 
Perceptual grouping 
and binding 
A second basic principle suggested by 
Ramachandran is “grouping” (or binding). 
The way this works can be illustrated by the 
Dalmatian dog picture shown in Fig. 2. T his 
is seen initially as a random jumble of 
splotches. The number of potential grou- 
pings of these splotches is infinite, but once 
the dog is seen, your visual system links only 
a subset of these splotches together and it is 
impossible not to “hold on” to this group of 
linked splotches. Indeed, the discovery of

the dog and the linking of the dog-relevant 
splotches generates a pleasant “aha” sensa- 
tion. In “colour space” the equivalent of this 
would be wearing a blue scarf with red flo- 
wers if you are wearing a red skirt; the per- 
ceptual grouping of the red flowers and your 
red skirt is aesthetically pleasing. Artists 
understand the pleasure given by such effects. 
The evolutionary value of such grouping 
of stimuli to pick out objects is obvious: it 
makes the detection of both prey and pre- 
dators much easier. But how is such grou- 
ping achieved? The key idea is as follows. 
Given the brain’s limited attentional 
resources and shortage of neural space for 
competing representations, every stage in the 
processing of visual information offers an 
opportunity to generate a signal that says, 
“Look, here is a clue to something poten- 
tially object-like!” Partial solutions or 
conjectures to perceptual problems are fed 
back from every level in the hierarchy to 
every earlier module to impose a small bias 
in processing, allowing the final percept to 
emerge from such progressive “bootstrap- 
ping”. 
Consistency between partial high-level 
“hypotheses” and earlier low-level ensembles 
generates a pleasant sensation—e.g. the 
Dalmatian dog “hypothesis” encourages the 
binding of corresponding splotches which, 
in turn,further consolidate the “dog-like” 
nature of the final percept and we feel good 
when it all finally clicks in place. And what 
the artist tries to do is to tease the system with 
as many of these “potential object” clues as 
possible—an idea that would help explain 
why grouping and “perceptual problem - 
solving” are both frequently exploited by 
artists and fashion designers. 
Isolating a visual signal 
T he third principle (in addition to peak 
shift and binding) emphasized by 
Ramachandran is the need to isolate a single

a random jumble of splotches, producing a 
pleasing sensation.

visual modality before you amplify the signal 
in that modality. T he brain’s ability to do this 
explains why an outline drawing or sketch is 
more effective as “art” than a full colour 
photograph. Consider a full-colour illustration 
of Nixon, with depth, shading, skin tones and 
blemishes,etc. What is unique about Nixon 
is the form of his face (as amplified by the 
caricature), but the skin tone—even though 
it makes the picture more human-like— 
doesn’t contribute to making him “Nixon- 
like” and therefore actually detracts from the 
efficacy of the form cues. This explains why 
one not only “gets away” with just using 
outlines—they are actually more effective than 
a full-colour half-tone photo, despite its having 
more information. Hence the aphorism 
“more is less” in Art. 
Additional evidence for this view comes 
from the “savant syndrome”—autistic chil- 
SIGNS OF THE TIMES 
dren who are “retarded” and yet produce 
beautiful drawings. T he animal drawings of the 
eight-year-old artist Nadia, for instance, are 
almost as aesthetically pleasing as those of 
Leonardo da Vinci (Fig. 4). Ramachandran 
argues that this is because the fundamental 
disorder in autism is a distortion of the 
“salience landscape”; savants shut out many 
important sensory channels, thereby allo- 
wing them to deploy all their attentional 
resources on a single channel. 
‘Lie detector’ testing 
Ramachandran believes that the “peak 
shift principle” can be tested directly. The 
method would employ skin conductance 
response (SCR), the technology used in 
“lie detectors”. The size of the SCR is a 
direct measure of the amount of limbic 
(emotional) activation produced by an 
image. It is a better measure, as it turns 
out, than simply asking someone how much 
emotion they feel about what they are loo-

» king at, because the verbal response is 
filtered, edited, and sometimes censored 
by the conscious mind. Measuring SCR 
allows direct access to “unconscious” 
mental processes. 
The experiment would compare a sub- 
ject’s SCR to a caricature of, say, Einstein or 
Nixon, to his SCR to a photo of the same indi- 
viduals. Intuitively, one would expect the 
photo to produce a large SCR because it is 
rich in cues and therefore excites more 
modules. If one found, paradoxically, that the 
caricature actually elicited a larger SCR, this 
would provide evidence for the operation of 
the peak shift effect—the artist would have 
unconsciously produced a super stimulus. 
Critical responses 
Ramachandran says that one could also 
compare the magnitude of an SCR to cari- 
catures of women (or indeed, to a Chola 
bronze nude or a Picasso nude) with the 
SCR to a photo of a nude woman. It is 
conceivable that the subject might claim 
to find the photo more attractive at a 
conscious level, while registering a large 
“unconscious aesthetic response” —in the 
form of a larger SCR—to the artistic repre- 
sentation. T hat art taps into the “subcons- 
cious” is not a new idea, but our SCR mea- 
surements may be the first attempt to test 
such a notion experimentally. 
Not surprisingly, Ramachandran’s 
attempt to reduce aesthetic experience to a 
set of physical or neurobiological laws has 
already met with stout criticism. A symptom 
of trouble to come has been seen in his use 
4 2 The Unesco Courier - June 1999 
of the term “pretty”. If used at all by serious 
art critics, the word damns with faint praise. 
Prettiness is not seen as a synonym for 
beauty, but as a shallow impostor. Yet Rama- 
chandran uses it without irony as a positive 
attribute. This one piece of unfortunate ter- 
minology might be forgiven, but other ele-

ments in his work are all of a piece with it. 
First, there is the heavy reliance on the 
female form and upon the erotic in his 
examples. Then he seems to equate 
“arousal” (as measured by SCR) with a 
positive aesthetic response—an assump- 
tion felt by critics to presuppose the reduc- 
tionist case he is trying to prove. Taken 
together, these points seem to some critics 
to confuse pornography with high art. 
The “science of art” has also been 
attacked from the scientific side, on the 
grounds that its proponents have not yet 
conducted any serious empirical tests of their 
ideas. At best they have offered a manifesto 
for aresearch programme and made some 
suggestions for possible lines of investigation. 
Even then, it has been pointed out that the 
narrow range of examples used hardly justifies 
the lofty claims to be dealing with the whole of 
art, let alone to have uncovered the “laws of 
aesthetic experience”. Nor has hitching his 
bandwagon to the Buddhist train, by 
associating his “eightfold laws” with the 
Buddha's eightfold noble path won 
Ramachandran any friends, though to be fair, 
he admits himself that this is a slightly 
whimsical association. 
Criticism has centred on the lack of 
proportion between the narrow approach to 
art taken by Ramachandran and the gran- 
diloquent claims he makes for his theory— 
although, as he admits, he initially pro- 
posed it “in a playful spirit”. But the very 
audacity with which its author propounds 
it guarantees that we shall be hearing a lot 
more of it in the coming months. u

### 116259: A Virtual library on the Web

A virtual library 
on the Web 
Untold riches await anyone who can tap into the public libraries now available 
on the Internet. But stiffening copyright law could rein in the trend 
Publisher Eric Eldred belongs to a 
breed of diehards who see the World 
WideWeb as a way to fulfill ideals rather 
than make money. “Very much like 
UNEsco, we feel a responsibility to our 
public—all human beings on the earth—to 
preserve our culture of books and art and 
make it available to as many as we can,” he 
says. “We are now blessed with a great deal 
of free computer power and we would like 
to turn this to good use.” 
Since 1995, Eldred, the American 
founder of Eldritch Press, has published 
on the Web great classics of literature whose 
copyright has expired and which have the- 
refore fallen into the public domain. He 
wants to build up a virtual library for uni- 
versity literature students and high-school 
pupils like his triplet daughters. 
From Victor Hugo 
to the Kama Sutra 
Eldred is not the only person fighting to 
make culture more accessible and wides- 
pread in cyberspace than in the “real” world. 
In the industrialized countries,such as the 
United States, plenty of moves are afoot 
to freshen up the tired old image of the 
public library. In recent years, millions of 
pages of the works of the greatest writers, 
historians, poets and philosophers have 
been scanned! onto the Internet or, in some 
cases, simply re-typed and put online. 
So far, such digitalized material consists 
mainly of Anglo-Saxon classics or products 
of Western culture translated into English. 
For example, you can download from the 
Web into your computer the writings of 
Aristotle, Oscar Wilde, Tolstoy, Victor Hugo, 
and a handful of Arab, Persian and Chinese 
authors, plus the Kama Sutra. You don’t 
need to go hunting for a book that you can, 
in this way, keep, print out, annotate and use 
as you wish or forward to your friends. 
These freely-available virtual libraries

have been set up by determined indivi- 
duals, NGOs, universities, governments 
and international organizations. T he Guten- 
berg Project and The Oxford Text Archive 
(OTA) are the pioneers (see page 45). On 
a bigger scale, national libraries have begun 
the monumental task of digitalizing all the 
hundreds of thousands of documents and 
pictures they possess. 
The first to take the plunge are the 
French National Library (BNF) and the 
U.S. Library of Congress, says Sonia Zill- 
hardt of the BNF. “Others have begun wor- 
king on the project in the past three years 
but some are still at an experimental stage. 
Most don’t have enough money to do it.” 
Scanning a page costs between one and 
four dollars, so millions are needed to pro- 
cess whole collections. But the hardest part 
is overcoming the conservatism of some 
cultural officials who have to be dragged into 
cyberspace. 
“Every country should provide easy 
access to documents in the public domain,” 
says Zillhardt. “The policies of different 
states must converge in the new environ- 
ment of the world information society.” 
This is the aim of the Bibliotheca Univer- 
salis (BU) project which was launched in 
1995 by the G7 group of the world’s seven 
richest countries, joined last year by Russia, 
and now links 13 countries in all. “They

have to work out between them who is digi- 
talizing what, as well as establish shared 
communication norms,” says Zillhardt. 
But there’s many a slip twixt cup and lip. 
Each national programme goes at its own 
speed, with its own priorities (such as U.S.his- 
tory in Washington or material about the 
great Portuguese explorersin Lisbon) and its 
own technical norms. On top of that,current 
computer programmes do not allow people 
to switch from a document in Japanese or 
Arabic to one in the Latin alphabet. 
By the end of the year,everyone involved 
in the BU project should have pledged to 
put together an initial shared collection of 
works on the theme of exchanges between 
different peoples. But how many years will 
it be before Japanese researchers can make 
a request in their own language and come 
up with documents from all the associated 
libraries? And how much longer than that 
will it be before a student in Burkina Faso 
can make use of such a tool? 
At first sight, virtual libraries seem like 
a godsend for people in poor countries, 
giving them access to the world’s collec- 
tive memory, which is concentrated in the 
rich countries. They just need a computer, 
an Internet connection and some money. 
“Web access is still very much a dream in 
many developing countries and the cost of 
international phone connections there is 
prohibitive,” says Philippe Quéau, UNESCO’s 
director of information and computing. 
“Fetching material off the Web takes time 
and is expensive—several dollars an hour in 
Africa, for example.” 
Does this mean online culture is beyond 
the reach of poor countries? No, but they 
have to develop two kinds of services. First, 
the local creation of “mirror” sites? of online 
libraries, which are accessible for the cost of 
a local phone call. And then encouraging the 
distribution of works in the form of CD- 
Roms, which cost less than a dollar to copy. 
UNEsco has launched a collection called 
Publica and will soon put out a CD-Rom of

the great Arabic classics. But it is having a 
hard job bringing out a similar one on 
French-language literature. 
“For two years I’ve been up against the 
inertia of French officialdom which doesn’t 
want to get into a fight with the publishers, 
even though the works I want to put on 
CD-Rom have come into the public 
domain,” says Quéau, who deplores the 
rampant privatization of the public domain 
for profit,“either by extending the life of a 
copyright or by making use of technology.” 
Privatization of the public domain 
Both these types of privatization are in 
the works. Microsoft’snew Windows 2000 
programme will make it easier to read texts 
on the screen, a sign that “e-books” could 
soon be on sale in the bookstores. We could 
download and read hundreds of works on 
such small book-sized computers. But 
would they, as Eldred fears,become “anti- 
books” which couldn’t be freely exchanged? 
To keep its monopoly, the computer 
industry would just need to impose a tech- 
nical norm to enable e-books to be read. 
Works in the public domain would then 
have to be electronically edited and so 
States, where the life of a copyright has 
grown from 28 years at the beginning of the 
century to 75 years last year. The U.S. 
Congress extended this by a further 20 
years last October when it passed the Sonny 
Bono Copyright Term Extension Act.Some 
people are even campaigning for unlimited 
copyright,or one for eternity minus a day. 
The “minus one day” is to avoid charges of 
unconstitutionality, since U.S. federal law 
forbids unlimited copyright. 
The aim is also to encourage authors’ 
creativity, not to provide their heirs and 
copyright holders with an endless source of 
income, says Eldred. He claims the new 
law is unconstitutional and filed a suit in 
January 1999 to get it struck down.A first 
decision will be made in July 1999 and the 
matter should go all the way to the Supreme 
Court, says legal expert and Harvard pro- 
fessor Lawrence Lessig, who backs Eldred. 
Congress has no right,he says,to limit the 
public domain as a whole and extend the 
monopoly of a few private groups, like 
Disney and the film industry, which lobbied 
very hard to get the Bono Law passed.

Intellectual property laws are also get- 
ting tougher. A European Union directive 
in October 1993 extended the copyright 
on an author’s works from 50 to 70 years 
after his or her death. “It seems reasonable 
to us to cover two generations of the author’s 
descendants, as international law stipulates 
and in view of today’s greater life expec-

Chicago-based journalist.Correspondent 
for Publishers Weekly. 
30 years while conducting a crusade against copyright restrictions 
When Michael Hart, a student at the 
University of Illinois, was given a free 
Internet account, he spent an hour 
pondering the potential of the gift, then typed 
in the American Declaration of 
Independence and sent it to everyone on the 
networks. Project Gutenberg had just been 
born. 
That was back in 1971, when only 23 
computers in the U.S. were online and 
computer memories were small. Believing 
that the greatest value created by computers 
would be the storage and retrieval of library 
materials,Hart continued his project with the 
U.S.Constitution, the books of the Bible and 
Shakespeare’s plays. As computer power 
increased, he launched into book-length 
manuscripts,beginning with a popular classic, 
Alice in Wonderland. Today, there are 160 
million Internet accounts globally and 
Michael Hart’s free cyber-library just posted 
its 2,000th title: Cervantes’ Don Quixote, in 
Spanish. While the majority of titles are in 
English, the library also comprises a handful 
in French, Italian and Latin. 
Idealistic and util tarian 
Although he claims he’s never read a 
computer manual, Hart, the son of a 
professor specializing in Shakespeare and a 
mathematician, is a child of the information 
age, arecluse who prefers to communicate 
via e-mail from his home in Urbana, Illinois. 
“I started the project because I am idealistic 
and utilitarian,” says Hart, a self-described 
blue-collar rebel. 
“Michael Hart should be as famous as Bill 
Gates,” asserts Chicago Tribune computer 
columnist Jim Coates. But Hart has never 
truly reaped the material reward from being 
the first to post texts on the net. Project 
Gutenberg is a non-profit enterprise,entirely 
funded through donations. Its first grant came 
from Apple, and others followed from such 
outfits as Hewlett Packard, IBM and 
Microsoft, whether in the form of super 
scanners or dollars. 
“We don’t have a budget of any kind,” 
asserts Hart flatly. The project, which 
averages 36 new books a year, relies on some 
1,000 volunteers. Nor is there an editorial 
committee. Volunteers are encouraged to 
choose books theyd like to add to the library, 
as long as they fall into the public domain, 
which restricts the selection to pre-1923

a self-described “blue-collar rebel”. 
works. They scan and proof the books before 
sending them to Hart, who puts them on- 
line in Plain Vanilla ASCII, the most 
widespread code for information interchange. 
Hart’s technique has its critics. In 
England, the Oxford Text Archive comprises 
over 2,500 online titles specifically geared to 
the academic community. Hence the 
importance of enriching the raw text with 
footnotes and choosing the most widely 
respected edition of a work. Such details are 
far from Hart’s chief concern. In his wish to 
make classics available to the masses, his 
greatest crusade is against copyright law. Since 
the launching of Project Gutenberg, the time 
period of copyright in the U.S. has been 
extended twice, which according to Hart, 
“eliminated two million books from lists we 
could be using.” Hart has been threatened by 
dozens of lawsuits, reportedly for digitalizing 
editions of books that are still covered by 
copyright. 
Many publishers claim that the Gutenberg 
project is no threat to business. Northwestern 
University Press, for example, recently 
published the complete works of Herman 
Melville, which are also available free of charge 
from Project Gutenberg. “This is public 
domain material,” says Nicholas Weir- 
Williams, director of Northwestern University 
Press. “The Melville material on the web 
doesn’t damage our sales.” “You could put 
full texts of every book you publish on the 
net,” adds Walter Lippincott, director of 
Princeton University Press,“and it wouldnt 
hurt sales. Idon’t think anybody wants to read 
very much online. And who wants to sit there 
and print out hundreds of pages?” 
On the contrary, Hart predicts a bright 
future for e-texts, if only for very simple 
reasons. “Most people don’t have 2,000 books 
in their entire home,” he says. “You can now fit 
that many books on one disk, for free.” But 
peering into his crystal ball, he also foresees 
public domain copyright laws extending on. 
“If this is, indeed, the information age, I ask: 
‘the information age . . . for whom’?’ u

Experts have warned of a possible food 
crisis in Asia in the coming decades due to 
population growth combined with lowered 
rates of food production. Isthere a 
possibility of famine surfacing again in 
some Asian countries? 
The Asian region will definitely face 
food shortage some time in the future if 
present trends continue. In most Asian 
countries, where the staple food is rice, 
population growth has not yet stabilized 
and the demand for food is increasing. 
According to UN estimates, by 2020 the 
world population will have swollen to 
around 8 billion people, 5 billion of whom 
will be rice consumers. We estimate that 
the world’s rice harvest must increase from 
the present 560 million tonnes to 840 mil- 
lion tonnes per year to meet the demand. All 
this has to come from existing agricultural 
land, as no more cropland is available in 
many countries. While increasing food pro- 
duction, the Asian countries should also 
think about active population control pro- 
grammes. 
How fast is food growth increasing to meet 
the demand? 
Unfortunately food production is not 
keeping pace with population growth.Bet- 
ween 1960 and 1990, global food produc- 
tion was increasing at a rate of 2.8 per cent 
per year while population grew at a rate of 
between 2.1 and 2.2 per cent. So there was 
not much of a problem. However, the situa- 
tion changed in the 1990s. Now population 
is increasing at the rate of 1.8 per cent whe-

Nl 
Gurdev Sngh Khush: 
  
reas food production is growing at a rate of 
1.5 per cent per year. Investment in irriga- 
tion has virtually ceased and good land is 
being lost to industrialization. If present 
trends continue, it will not be possible to 
meet future demand for food. 
To what extent can new technologies help 
to boost yields? Where is rice research 
heading? 
We now have rice varieties which have a 
yield potential of about 10 tonnes per hec- 
tare. However,the present average yield of 
irrigated rice in Asia is around 5 tonnes 
per hectare under best management. To 
increase the average output to 8 tonnes, 
we have to fine-tune the production system 
and invest more in irrigation and in educa- 
ting farmers about new technologies. We are 
confident that by early in the next century, 
new seed varieties with a yield potential of 
12 to 12.5 tonnes per hectare will be avai- 
lable. 
The future of rice research will be 
oriented more towards eco-friendly agri- 
culture. Rice breeders worldwide are now 
developing new rice plants which are 
drought-resistant and pest-resistant, and 
have the inbuilt capacity to outgrow weeds. 
In the next 30 to 50 years,temperature-sen- 
sitive rice plants will also be needed with 
tolerance to higher temperatures because of 
global warming. 
What is the next step for the International 
Rice Research Institute (IRRI)? 
At the IRRI, our next aim is to bring 
An architect of the Green 
Revolution* is now trying to 
bring about a “Green Green 
Revolution” to avert a food 
crisis in the coming decades 
about a “Green Green Revolution” to pro- 
duce more rice from less land and water, 
and without chemical pesticides or herbi- 
cides. For this we have developed a new 
plant type, called “Super Rice”, which is in 
the experimental stages. This new plant, a 
product of conventional breeding methods, 
will have an entirely different architecture 
from that of our earlier seed varieties. 
In IR8, the first high-yielding rice 
variety, half of the plant’s weight is grain and 
half is straw, whereas the new Super Rice 
plant is 60 per cent grain and 40 per cent 
straw. This new variety will have increased 
photosynthetic capacity, directing more 
energy into grain production and less into 
foliage. An early prototype of this new plant 
was developed a few years ago and now we 
are working to improve the grain quality and 
to incorporate genes that will give the seed 
variety disease and pest resistance so that 
farmers won’t have to use pesticides. For the 
first time, we have “borrowed” the gene 
that gives maize its stem strength and intro- 
duced it into the new plant. T his will enable 
the plant to carry more grains, increasing the 
yield by at least 25 per cent compared to 
existing varieties. We hope to release it to 
Asian farmers by early next century. 
When you started your career at the IRRI 32 
years ago, the primary aim was to develop

high-yielding rice varieties to prevent a 
food crisis. That led 
to the Green Revolution.Then came eco- 
friendly agriculture and now efforts are 
being made to develop genetically 
modified seeds. How would you describe 
this transition? 
Asia witnessed acute food shortages in 
the 1960s and it was urgent to step up food 
production. This was achieved by develo- 
ping high-yielding rice varieties like IR-8, 
IR-36 and IR-64 at the IRRI which matured 
in 110 days compared to the 180 days 
required for traditional varieties. T his trans- 
formation, better known as the Green Revo- 
lution, helped to double rice production in 
Asia between 1967 and 1992, averting 
famine in many countries. In some countries 
like Indonesia, rice production trebled. 
However, it was realized during the process 
that indiscriminate use of pesticides and 
fertilizers caused environmental damage. So 
the emphasis shifted towards sustainable 
agriculture. Farmers were encouraged to 
use organic manure, compost and bio-fer- 
tilizers. Subsequently new seed varieties, 
genetically resistant to certain insect pests, 
were also developed, minimizing the use 
of hazardous pesticides. 
On the social side, we realized that the 
new seed varieties were more successful in 
irrigated areas with good water resources. 
The impact of new technology was minimal 
in uplands and rain-fed areas, where most 
of the poor farmers lived. Our next chal- 
lenge is to develop drought-resistant rice 
varieties to help those farmers living in 
unfavourable environments. 
a 
TALKING TO... 
As a prominent actor in the Green 
Revolution how would you react to 
criticism that excessive use of fertilizers 
and pesticides resulted in soil degradation? 
I think most of this criticism is unjusti- 
fied. We were about to witness famine in 
Asia in the 1960s and the priority was to 
increase food production. So mineral ferti- 
lizers and pesticides were used to boost 
productivity. But there is no evidence or 
data to show that soil degradation occurred 
because of the Green Revolution process. It 
could have happened because of improper 
use of agricultural lands. Excessive use of 
fertilizers and pesticides and no proper 
drainage systems in fields during heavy 
rains or floods also contributed to soil degra- 
dation.N ow we actively promote Integrated 
Pest Management, encouraging farmers to

TALKING TO... 
rationalize pesticide use. 
There are a lot of misconceptions about 
the use of mineral fertilizers. Our research 
findings have proved that rice plants definitely 
need balanced nutrients to produce more 
grain. Whether these nutrients come from 
mineral fertilizers or organic manure does not 
matter. Look at the farmers in the U.S.and 
other developed countries who continue to 
use fertilizers and harvest higher yields. If there 
were problems in using mineral fertilizers, 
they would be the first ones to raise the alarm. 
If fertilizers are not harmful why are some 
farmers opting for organic farming? 
Some farmers go for organic farming, 
without using mineral fertilizers or pesti- 
cides, because it is lucrative and there is a 
demand for organic food in Western coun- 
tries. But their production level is half of 
what they used to harvest before by using 
fertilizers. I am sure that if all farmers swit- 
ched over to organic farming, current food 
production would be reduced by half, trig- 
gering a food crisis. In my view, organic 
farming is not a viable alternative but a 
recipe for disaster. 
Some say that many traditional rice 
varieties have disappeared as a result of 
    
r Gurdev Singh Khush may not be a house- 
hold name. But his rice varieties are. In the 
last 32 years, he and his team at the Intemna- 
tional Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in Manila, 
have introduced over 300 new grain varieties, 
including IR8, IR36, IR64 and IR72, which triggered 
the Green Revolution in Asia in the 1960s. Today, 
IRR rice varieties and their progenies are planted 
in over 70 per cent of the world’s rice-fields. 
“Farmers were initially sceptical about our 
new grain varieties, which took lesstime to mature 
than traditional varieties. But our perseverance 
paid dividends” recalls Dr Khush. During the first 
25 years of Dr Khush’s programme, world rice 
production doubled from 256 million tonnes in 
1966 to 518 million tonnes in 1990,enabling an 
additional 700 million people to obtain adequate 
nutrition. 
In 1976, Dr Khush introduced IR36, called “ the 
miracle rice” that has since become one of the 
world’s most widely grown food crop varieties. 
According to IRR estimates, IR36 has added about 
five million tonnes of rice annually to Asia’s food 
supply and accounts for an additional $1 billion 
yearly income to Asian farmers. 
What prompted Khush to take up a career in 
agricultural research? “ | come from Punjab, in nor-

food crisis. In my view, organic farming is not a viable 
alternative but a recipe for disaster 
the introduction of IRRI’s new varieties, 
resulting in loss of genetic diversity. What 
is your response to this view? 
It is natural for farmers to switch over to 
new varieties providing higher yields. As a 
consequence, the number of varieties in 
farmers’ fields goes down. In the U.S, for 
example, farmers were growing over 50 
varieties of soya bean 30 years ago but now 
they cultivate only five or six new high-yiel- 
ding varieties. How can you stop farmers 
from using a new variety which gives them 
higher yields? It is not true that traditional 
seed varieties have been lost forever. We 
collect those varieties and save them in our 
germplasm bank at the IRRI. So far,about 
85,000 traditional rice varieties have been 
collected from many parts of Asia, which 
were grown before the Green Revolution. 
Similarly countries like Indonesia, India 
and China also have their own seed col- 
lection centres. T hese will be used for gene- 
rations to come when we want to develop 
thern India. There was a lot of poverty and not 
enough food. My father was a farmer, and he 
strongly encouraged me to do something for the 
agricultural community,” says the 64-year-old 
scientist. His pioneering research has won him 
many aw ards, the most notable being the World 
Food Prize in 1996,which he won for his contri- 
bution to “advancing human development by 
improving the quality, quantity or availability of 
the world’s food supply.” The prize, widely 
regarded as the equivalent of a Nobel Prize for 
agriculture, is awarded by the World Food Prize 
Foundation based at Des Moines (USA). 
Khush is now working on new grain varieties 
designed to increase yields by another 25 per 
cent.“ The mission of my life is to continue to work 
towards the improvement of rice, and to be able 
to feed more and more people,” says Dr Khush 
who now lives in Los Banos, near Manila in the 
Philippines, with his wife, Dr Harwant K.Khush.

new seed varieties. 
I disagree with the view that the genetic 
potential of those traditional varieties is 
lost completely. When a new variety is deve- 
loped, rice breeders incorporate genes from 
30 to 40 different traditional varieties and 
incorporate them into the new seed. Take 
the case of IR-64, a very popular variety 
among Asian farmers. It has genes taken 
from at least 44 different parents. We cannot 
develop modern varieties without tradi- 
tional varieties. 
According to a UN report, global fresh 
water supplies are barely half of what 
they were 20 years ago and the shortage 
is likely to increase in the coming years. 
How can farmers cope with the water 
shortage? 
This is going to be another major pro- 
blem in future. Rice is a high water-consu- 
ming crop but we find farmers using more 
water than is actually required. On average, 
farmers use 5,000 litres of water to produce 
one kilogram of rice. It is not essential to use 
so much water. Now there are technologies 
available to produce one kilo of rice with as 
little as 1,500 to 2,000 litres of water. Unfor- 
tunately many farmers are not aware of these 
new trends and do not have access to the new 
technologies. There is a misconception 
among farmers that they need to maintain a 
few inches of water above ground level in rice 
fields throughout the growing period. We 
have shown that it is enough to keep the soil 
saturated with water. A new initiative needs 
to be launched by rice-producing countries 
to educate rice farmers about water mana- 
gement. 
There is a strong demand to produce more 
rice to solve the food problem.However, 
some environmental groups complain that 
methane gas, which emerges out of rice 
fields, contributes to the greenhouse effect. 
How can this problem be solved? 
It is true that methane emission occurs in 
rice fields but the problem has been exag- 
gerated. Statistics show that only 15 per cent 
of global methane emission originates from 
paddy fields. The remaining 85 per cent 
comes from industrial activities worldwide. 
So we should first try to reduce methane 
emissions from industry by introducing alter- 
native eco-friendly technologies. But you 
cannot stop rice production. Rice will

Many Asian countries talk about land reform 
designed to even out the distribution of 
farmland among farmers and labourers. 
Unfortunately, in many countries land reform 
has not become a reality for socio-political 
reasons. Do you believe that the present 
unequal distribution of land has any 
relevance to food production?

Equal land distribution among farmers 
is highly relevant because it not only reflects 
on food production but also on socio-eco- 
nomic conditions. Look at the Indian expe- 
rience. In states like West Bengal and Punjab, 
land reforms were carried out in the 1960s 
and 1970s and food production in those 
regions has increased as a result. On the 
contrary, in the eastern state of Bihar most of 
the land is owned by a handful of landlords. 
This unequal land distribution is the main 
reason for the clashes between landowners 
and labourers there for the last 50 years.

Bihar’s average food production is also very 
low compared to other states. In the Philip- 
pines, land reforms were introduced in the 
early 1970s and since then rice lands have 
been owned by rice producers, not by land- 
lords. Japan also undertook land reforms 
after the Second World War and food pro- 
duction has increased steadily since then. 
Reports have shown that cultivable areas in 
Asia are decreasing gradually due to rapid 
urbanization and industrialization. What 
repercussions will this have in the next 25 
years? 
In many Asian countries, productive 
agricultural land is situated close to cities 
and towns. When the cities expand these 
lands become the first victims. In China, for 
example,agricultural land is disappearing 
rapidly to meet the demands of industrial 
and housing projects. In the 1970s, the area 
under rice cultivation in China was over 
35 million hectares. By 1990 the figure had 
dropped to 31 million hectares. China 
doesn’t have additional land which can be 
converted to agricultural purposes. The 
Chinese government is aware of this pro- 
blem and has introduced strict laws to pre- 
vent agricultural land from being converted 
to industrial and housing purposes. 
In Indonesia, particularly in Java,60,000 
hectares of rice land are lost every year »

Lo 
TALKING TO... 
because of increasing demand for houses 
and factories, and in the Philippines, they lose 
around 10,000 hectares of rice fields for the 
same reasons. We should remember that rice 
fields being consumed by urban growth 
cannot simply be replaced by clearing more 
forests. Countries such as the Philippines 
don’t have much forest left. To partly com- 
pensate, Asian countries should try to bring 
more areas under irrigation. Again that 
requires a lot of investment. 
Scientists say that the arrival of monsoon 
rains has been either delayed or advanced 
due to global climate change, affecting 
farming communities in many Asian 
countries. What could the consequences be 
if the pattern continues? 
It will be very destructive for agriculture 
if this change in the weather pattern,known 
as the La Nifia effect, strikes again this year. 
In Southeast Asia last year, the monsoon 
was delayed by four months whereas it 
rained heavily during the harvest season so 
that rice crops were destroyed. As a result, 
rice farmers have suffered heavy losses in the 
last two years. Rice production in the Phi- 
lippines and Indonesia has gone into sharp 
decline following the La Nifia effect. I hope 
this continues to be a rare phenomenon, 
which occurs once every 10 years or more. 
If it happens every year then it will have a 
devastating effect on rice cultivation. 
Has the Asian financial crisis had an impact 
on rice production? 
The Asian financial crisis primarily 
affected South Korea, Thailand, Indonesia 
and Malaysia. In South Korea and Malaysia, 
the agricultural sector was unaffected, and 
rice production in those countries has been 
normal for the last two years. Thailand 
managed to withstand the crisis mainly 
because of its strength in rice cultivation. 
Many Thais who were working in factories 
moved back to rice fields following the eco- 
nomic crisis. As a result, the area under rice 
cultivation increased and Thailand was able 
to produce more rice than in the previous 
years. TheThai government has realized that 
rice cultivation is the country’s backbone, and 
is paying more attention to agriculture now. 
In Indonesia, the economic crisis has 
had an adverse impact. In the aftermath of 
the crisis, the cash-strapped Indonesian 
government stopped giving subsidies for fer- 
tilizers and fertilizer prices shot up. Many rice 
farmers had to abandon their crops because 
they simply could not afford to buy fertilizers 
at the new rates. Economic crisis, along with 
La Niiia, hit rice output in Indonesia last 
year, reducing rice stocks to their lowest 
level in the last decade. Indonesia was a rice 
exporter until a few years ago but now 
imports three million tonnes a year. 
What about China? 
Many experts have predicted that China 
is likely to face a major food shortage in the 
next century. T he population is still increa- 
sing at the rate of 1.1 per cent. It is estimated 
that the population growth rate will stabilize 
only after touching the 1.6 billion mark 
compared to the present 1.2 billion.That 
means another 400 million to 500 million 
more people to feed. Only 11 per cent of the 
total land area in China is suited to agri- 
culture. The rest consists of mountains and 
deserts. So China will become the largest 
importer of food grains 30 years from now.
