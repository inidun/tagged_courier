Apart from the tall-masted sailing ships and people in the dress of byegone days, the celebrated 
square of St. Mark, in Venice, looks today exactly as it did in the 18th century, when this scene 
was painted by the Venetian artist Canaletto the Younger (Bernardo Bellotto, not to be confused 
with his uncle, the great Canaletto, Giovanni Antonio Canale). On left, one of two ancient 
columns of Egyptian granite which dominate the marble-paved Piazzetta di San Marco, leading 
from the square of St. Mark to the sea. Column seen here is surmounted by a bronze winged 
WO R | D AR lion, emblem of St. Mark the Evangelist, patron of the city (close-up of lion is shown on front 
cover). The painting hangs in the Galleria Nazionale d’Arte Antica, Pallazzo Corsini, Rome.

STILL TIME TO 
SAVE VENICE 
by Ali Vrioni 
lay is renowned not 
only for the monuments and works of 
art she has inherited from the peoples 
and cultures of her historic past, but 
also for the care she takes of them. 
Authonties and individuals who, even 
in normal times vie with one another 
in caring for their country’s art and 
monuments, compel the admiration of 
the world by the energy with which 
they react whenever disaster strikes 
their artistic heritage. 
As the Italian Government is not in 
the habit of appealing to others for 
help in dealing with its own problems, 
it must have considered the cir- 
cumstances to be truly exceptional, 
when, on November 4, 1966, it asked 
Unesco to appeal for international aid 
for the relief of Florence and Venice, 
victims of unprecedented floods. 
Help did in fact come from all parts 
of the world, enabling the cities to 
overcome their immediate difficulties. 
In Venice, however, it became clear 
that the problems went beyond those 
usually encountered in the restoration 
and conservation of works of art, and 
that the preservation of this ancient 
city called for a special kind of co- 
operation. Why was this so? 
One is tempted to reply simply that 
Venice is unique, both in being a 
microcosm of another age, paradoxi- 
cally surviving in our times, and 
because of the profusion and richness 
  
ALI VRION! Js Special Assistant to the 
Director-General of Unesco. From 1961 to 
1965, he was director of Unesco's Service of 
Nubia Monuments, and from 1965 to 1957,

Culture. 
of its art treasures. But is not this 
more or less true, in all fairness, for 
all great cultural centres, and can there 
be any question of establishing a 
hierarchy among them? 
Consequently, it is not only because 
of its aesthetic ments, nor because 
of any sentimental leanings that the 
national authorities and Unesco con- 
sider Venice to be exceptional: it is 
because of the extreme complexity of 
its situation. 
In point of fact, the fate of Venice's 
buildings and artistic heritage does not 
depend solely on physical factors, 
which, for the works of art to be 
protected, would only have to be 
modified by appropriate techniques. 
As is well known, the sur- 
vival of this heritage is threatened by 
the storms which are causing more and 
more flooding in the city; by the 
currents which eat at the city's 
foundations when they are too swift 
and endanger its salubrity when they 
are too slow; by the gradual and 
apparently inexorable rise of the sea- 
level, combined with the slow sub- 
sidence of the islands; by the micro- 
organisms which attack the wooden 
piles on which the foundations are 
laid (see article page 10); by humidity 
and air pollution which eat into marble 
and cause paintings to deteriorate. 
But it is not a deserted city, in a 
remote part of the world, that is 
suffering from these ills. It is an 
actively developing urban community 
undergoing economic, social and 
cultural changes which are, in many 
respects, critical, and which in some 
cases actually cause or at any rate 
aggravate these troubles. 
Technology is almost always able to 
deal with problems when required to 
do so by a healthy body in the process 
of expansion. Experts are perfectly 
capable of designing and constructing 
dikes, sluices, meteorological warning 
systems, systems for controlling the 
flow of water in the canals and at the 
entrances to the lagoons, for strength- 
ening the foundations, raising streets 
and houses, protecting buildings and 
their artistic treasures against damage 
from air and water—all things that 
Venice needs urgently. 
But in order to do this, it is essential 
that the members of this commumty 
should agree on the future they want 
for the city and have the necessary 
vitality to make such undertakings 
possible. 
Social and demographic studies 
show, however, that the population of 
the historic centre of Venice has been 
steadily declining over the past 
18 years, though factories and ultra-

### 59304: Still time to save Venice

STILL TIME TO SAVE VENICE (Continued) 
The first full inventory of Venice's art treasures 
modern harbour facilities have been 
set up and are increasing in the part of 
Venice situated on the mainland. 
But this industrial expansion has not 
so far led to any economic revival in 
the historic centre. Some Venetians 
indeed consider that it is detrimental 
to the old town, and that the growth 
of the new Venice threatens to destroy 
the artistic and cultural values of the 
old. Is this true? 
No one can yet reply to this 
question. One view is that the incom- 
patibility which some people see 
between the modern spirit of industrial 
enterprise and the old magic of Venice 
is as real and irremediable as the 
contrast between the factory chimneys 
and cranes at Marghera and the 
churches and ornamental facades that 
give the islands in the lagoon their 
poetry. If this is so, the Venetian 
community will be split in two, and the 
two parts will grow indifferent and 
even hostile to one another. 
The industrialization of the mainland, 
which will proceed without being sub- 
jected in any way to the influence 
of the traditional Venice we know, 
will probably attract an increasing 
proportion of the younger, more active 
people from the historic centre. The 
old city will find its intellectual! and 
spintual life radically transformed, and 
its possibilities of physical survival 
affected: for it is not at all certain 
that a city which has become a 
museum, which is partially depopulated 
and whose economic resources are 
problematic, will be able to defend 
itself against nature and the harmful 
effects of human activity, as success- 
fully as a rapidly expanding city may. 
The other answer is that economic 
development is not a threat to Venice, 
but its hope of salvation. The 
inventive spirit, the knowledge, the 
financial and technical resources that 
it implies may be used to save the 
Venetian heritage and generate a lively 
upsurge of fresh ideas and initiative, 
a new artistic movement—in other 
words, all the elements of the cultural 
fertility that was for long the attraction 
of Venice, and that may well return 
(see article page 35). 
The same big industrial and commer- 
cial concerns which are today digging 
channels to make it easier for ships 
to cross the lagoon, and which have 
it in their power gradually to destroy 
the beauty and atmosphere of Venice, 
can, If they find 1t worthwhile, put 
just as much imagination, energy and 
money into protecting from floods and 
damage—by large-scale public works 
and the regular maintenance of what 
is to be kept from the past—the noble 
dwellings of the historic centre which 
they could have chosen for their 
impressive head offices. 
Your people would no 
doubt find hfe in an expanding city 
attractive and would therefore be en- 
couraged to settle there and take part 
in its activities, instead of leaving it 
as they are doing at present. Provided, 
of course, that they could live there: 
economic and financial vitality, com- 
bined with appropriate legislative 
measures, can assist in improving 
residential zones and in providing 
comfortable homes in an architectural 
setting that has all the charm of a 
former age. 
It is therefore probable that the fate 
of the “historic monument” that is 
Venice itself, and the art treasures 
which enrich its chapels, salons and 
narrow streets, will depend, in the last 
resort, on the choice made between 
these two opposing views. 
it be made? By But how will 
chance? By the luck of the draw? 
When we consider the value of what 
is at stake, would it not be more 
worthy of our civilization that such a 
decision should be taken well- 
advisedly, on the basis of a sound and 
thorough knowledge of the problems? 
This is obviously the line that the 
Italian authorities are following, by 
setting up, among other things, various 
national and loca! bodies to conduct 
research, co-ordinate measures and 
take action. And because the results 
of this research are of interest to the 
whole human race, which would lose 
a dream if Venice were to perish, 
Unesco has been asked to assist In 
this long and complex task. 
The first step taken by Unesco was 
to make a systematic study of all the 
work being carried out in Italy that 
could throw light on the nature and 
interrelationship of the problems, both 
physical and human, which have arisen 
in Venice. Out of this analysis and 
reflection there emerged a voluminous 
report, and, what 1s more significant, 
a conviction—the conviction that the 
problems of Venice are so closely 
linked one with the other, so totally 
interdependent, that it is impossible 
to understand one without knowing 
the others, and impossible to solve one 
without dealing with them all. 
Experience has shown that satis- 
factory results in such circumstances 
can be obtained only by using inter- 
disciplinary methods, and that to solve 
the problems a comprehensive plan of 
action is needed. 
The possibility of carrying out such 
a programme is in fact the problem of 
Venice, whose technical problems 
are only facets—often deceptive in 
appearance—of this main difficulty. 
Naturally enough, considering its

Unesco has offered to help the Italian 
Government in drawing up and 
carrying out a plan for the preservation 
and restoration of Venice; this was 
decided by Unesco’s Executive Board 
at its meeting in Siena, on August 30, 
1968. 
But a lot more information is needed 
before realistic plans can be made for 
useful measures. For example, until 
now there has been no complete 
record of the historical monuments, 
palaces and works of art. Unesco has 
therefore assisted, in agreement with 
the Italian Council for Antiquities and 
Fine Arts, in compiling the necessary 
inventories. 
At the end of the first survey, some 
16,000 index cards had been drawn up, 
complete with photographs specifying 
the state of preservation of each 
work of art, the restoration required, 
and what this would cost. A second 
survey produced similar files relating

to palaces and religious buildings. 
A third survey is in progress, on 
housing conditions in the historic 
centre and ways of improving them. 
Another is dealing with the structure 
of the Venetian metropolis in 1980 and 
the problems of communication. 
Finally, Unesco is preparing to put 
its scientific services at the disposal 
of the Italian authorities, in order to 
reach a better understanding of the 
hydrography of the lagoon, the sea 
currents, the phenomena of soil 
mechanics and hydrobiological in-- 
fluences—all of which are indis- 
pensable to any protective action. 
If Venice were content merely to 
study its problems and Unesco to join 
in that study, irremediable catastrophes 
might well occur before the scientists 
had agreed on their causes. While 
paying due attention to the need for 
research and objective thinking, 
Unesco is therefore principally con- 
cerned with taking practical measures. 
. 
-—-

Yet another example of the com- 
plexity of the problem of Venice is 
that treatment must be started while 
the laboratory analyses are still being 
carried out. This undoubtedly pre- 
sents risks, but is it not often the 
same when the patient is a human 
being, whose breathing might stop at 
any moment? The historic monuments, 
statues and altars which are being 
attacked by “stone disease,” the 
frescos which are disappearing, the 
paintings which are losing their 
colours, cannot wait either: and the 
sooner the deserted palaces are lived 
in once more, the better (see article 
page 20). 
Unesco's campaign is therefore 
designed, from now on, to present 
these problems to people and insti- 
tutions all over the world, who 
do not wish to see Venice disappear. 
Universities, foundations and large 
business concerns can purchase or 
rent a palace, restore it and use it to

house branches of their activities, thus 
enjoying the incomparable setting that 
Venice offers, and at the same time 
helping to restore the city to its 
original splendour. All people, even 
those with Iittle money at their 
disposal, can share in saving the works 
of art—by sending their contributions, 
however modest, to the special fund 
opened by Unesco for the protection 
of the ltalian cities stricken by the 
flood disaster of 1966. 
Help is coming already from all 
quarters: more and more. will be 
received, and will become increasingly 
effective, as plans for the protection 
and cultural development of Venice 
take form and are carried out. 
Obviously the final decisions must 
rest with the Italian authorities them- 
selves and Unesco can give only 
limited assistance in devising plans and 
carrying them out. 
Nevertheless, this assistance does 
not only involve Unesco’s committees,

its experts and consultants and the 
services of its secretariat. It brings 
into play the many powerful inter- 
national associations, both govern- 
mental and non-governmental, with 
which Unesco co-operates, and the 
learned institutions upon which it can 
call for help—in short, all the means 
of communication and co-ordination at 
its disposal, not to mention those in 
whose establishment it has been 
specially concerned. 
One such example is the committee 
that the Italian Government and the 
Director-General of Unesco agreed to 
set up to advise on what should be 
done to save Venice. Outstanding 
figures from italy and other countries 
have agreed to take part in its work, 
so that the knowledge and wisdom of 
the whole world may serve the 
threatened city. 
Venice may perish: not perhaps as 
in the apocalyptic predictions that 
some people like to make, by sinking 
beneath the waves but, just as tragic- 
ally, by succumbing to the complex, 
insidious, hidden ills which sap her 
strength and energy. 
But Venice may also survive. It is 
possible to save her: Unesco would 
not devote itself to a hopeless cause. 
Venice can only be saved, however, 
on one condition: that its rescue is 
conceived as a collective task, a great 
common venture requiring organization 
and concerning everyone. 
The Venetians first of all: those who 
love ancient things, as well as those 
who are concerned for the achieve- 
ments of tomorrow. 
And the people of all other 
countries too—so that in these islands 
far from their own frontiers, yet near 
to them in spirit, they may continue to 
find not only a sanctuary of the past, 
but the outpost of a world which, 
despite the disillusions of history, 
seeks to be truly universal.

THE THOUSAND PARADOXES 
OF VENICE 
In this issue, the UNESCO COURIER presents the salient findings of a 
comprehensive study on the problems of Venice recently completed by Unesco. 
The study makes the first systematic assessment of the complex ensemble 
of problems, physical and human, that face Venice today, and reviews the solutions 
proposed by Italian specialists and other authorities. The article below describes 
the struggle waged by the island city against the tides and currents eroding its 
foundations, and a second article (page 35) examines the problems encountered 
by Venice in its adaptation to the needs and demands of modern life. In a 
third article inspired by the Unesco study (page 20) Louis Frédéric surveys 
the ravages suffered by the city’s unique heritage of art and monuments.

D corre all her splendid 
achievements, perhaps Venice's great- 
est triumph has been the ability to 
survive. Even the facilities of her 
lagoon, so advantageous to Venice, 
were not a gift from nature. If the 
ancient Venetians had not wrested it 
from its natural course, the lagoon 
would long ago have silted up and 
leveled out to form a plain. 
Its mirror-like waters, immortalized 
by so many poets and painters, would 
have long since given way to rising 
land, and Venice herself would have 
become another Aigues-Mortes (the 
medieval French port now isolated 
from the sea by marshland), if the 
immense work carried out through the 
centuries had not saved it from the 
fate of other great lagoons, described 
by Pliny, Strabo, Vitruvius and Livy, 
which have disappeared along the 
Adriatic coast, north of Ravenna. 
The Venetians had to be exception- 
ally perceptive to calculate what 
steps to take, and to avoid errors in 
judgement or rash moves that would 
allow the sea to take its revenge 
on the haven they so tenaciously 
defended against the fatally soft river 
mud. 
Of course, their ingenuity and 
wisdom were not always as infallible 
as their respectful descendants would 
like to believe. Yet, despite the fact 
that they have not been able to assure 
their successors an entirely secure

domain, they have at least been able 
to show them how to use their own 
skills to turn nature's “bulldozer” 
leveling power to their advantage. 
The Venetian lagoon, formed from 
an ancient sea marsh, is ltaly's largest 
inland sea water system. Shaped like 
a shallow crescent running north-east 
to south-west, it is approximately 
55 kilometres long while its width 
varies from 8 to 14 kilometres; its 
total area, including all its islands, is 
approximately 550 square kilometres. 
This salt water lake is separated 
from the open sea by a broken 
offshore barrier, consisting of flat, 
elongated islands and peninsulas of 
glacial and alluvial origin, dating from 
the Quaternary Period, and therefore 
relatively recent and soft. The 
hundreds of tiny islands dotted over 
the lagoon are of the same origin and 
substance: clay and sand. 
The rivers which had helped to 
form the lagoon might eventually have 
filled it up with mud. In fact, they 
did carry a profusion of rushes and 
reeds to the populated islands, 
which slowed down the currents and 
hindered the free passage of boats. 
The Anopheles mosquito thrived in 
the river waters, spreading disease 
which, in the 17th century, gradually 
decimated the population of Torcello, 
the “first Venice". 
It is not at all surprising that one 
of the main concerns of ancient Venice 
was to protect herself from the 
capacity of the rivers to spread 
disease. People often said, forgetting 
all that it owed them, that the lagoon 
had three enemies: the land, the sea, 
and man. 
The formidable task of mastering 
the rivers was not accomplished 
without intellectual and physical diffi- 
culties. Experts disagreed on the 
nature and urgency of both the 
problem and its solution. Many 
engineering works had to be 
abandoned, dismantled or completely 
remodelled, when they proved to have 
a disastrous effect on some aspect of 
the lagoon's economy. 
But seen as a whole, in the 
perspective of time, the Venetian 
Republic's defensive system against 
the rivers is nonetheless an im- 
pressive achievement. They succeed-

THE THOUSAND PARADOXES (Continued) 
See-saw battle of sinking land and rising 
ed in taming the Po and turning it 
southward, as well as diverting the 
Brenta, the Piave, and the Sile away 
from the lagoon. And, although the 
conterminazioni (trenches or canals 
built on the outskirts of Venice) did 
not prevent the areas nearest the sea 
from gradually turning into marshland, 
they did at least succeed in regulating 
the salt content of the water, thus 
eliminating malaria. 
Some maintain that these measures, 
necessary though they were, may have 
been too radical, and have deprived 
the lagoon bed of the supply of fluvial 
sediment which would have com- 
pensated for the loss or settling of 
its original alluvium, thereby speeding 
up the subsidence process. A 
secondary and less hypothetical result 
of the diversion of the rivers is that 
the bottom and banks of the lagoon 
have become more exposed to the 
effects of erosion by sea currents, 
whose force is no longer absorbed by 
a cushion of silt. 
The Venetian lagoon is connected 
to the open sea by three porti, or 
channels, in the narrow off-shore sand 
bar. From north to south, they are 
the porti of the Lido, Malamocco and 
Chioggia. 
To. before 1,000 A.D., the 
Venetians were studying possible ways 
of preventing the mouth of the Lido 
channel from silting up. One of the 
first steps was to close the channel 
which existed at that time north of 
the island of San Erasmo, while at 
the same time, digging a new channel 
to connect the basins of the northern 
lagoon, the waters of which were 
quite distinct. This made the Porto di 
Lido the main entrance to the lagoon, 
despite the ancient naval supremacy 
of Malamocco, once the seat of the 
Byzantine suzerainty. 
Chioggia, the third porto, was 
improved recently, as were the very 
long parallel breakwaters, built under 
the Austrian and Italian governments 
to guide the tide through the three 
porti, and protect them from silting up. 
These channels have many advan- 
tages, one of which is to allow ships 
access to the lagoon, enabling Venice 
to continue to be an important 
passenger and cargo port. But their 
most important function is hydro- 
dynamic: the purifying tides which 
move through the porti twice a day, 
assure that the Venetian lagoon 
continues to be a living, dynamic part 
of the sea. 
Tides move in a vertical direction: 
if the lagoon were an open bay, the 
water would rise and fall along the 
embankments of the city without 
running through the rii, the city's 
narrowest canals. Because it is 
connected to the sea only through the 
narrow bottlenecks of the porti, there 
is a time lag between the level of 
the lagoon and that of the sea. Here 
we see the scientific principle of 
communicating vessels at work—one 
of which is small (the lagoon) and the 
other infinitely larger (the sea). 
As the tide rises, the sea water 
spreads horizontally inside the lagoon, 
its movement helped or hindered by 
such factors as the season, time of 
day, direction and speed of wind, and 
atmospheric pressure. The water 
forms into currents at each porto, 
which then flow across the lagoon 
and through the channels between the 
islands, until they reach the mainland. 
The speed of the currents is deter- 
mined by the size of the lagoon basin 
in relation to the size of the entrance. 
The larger the basin, the faster the 
current entering it; conversely, the 
smaller the basin, or the greater the 
proportion of land above water within 
it, the slower the rate of flow. By 
altering the size of the porti, this flow 
can be corrected. Unlike its speed, 
however, the height of the tide is 
decided by lunar and meteorological 
factors. 
The latest measurements of the 
tidal flow at the entrance to the Lido 
channel show that its speed can be 
as much as two metres per second. 
Usually, it is not more than one metre 
per second and naturally loses its 
impetus as the current crosses the 
lagoon, especially slowing down after 
entering the maze of canals within the 
city, and coming to a complete stand- 
still in some of the small rii. 
As the tide goes out, the lagoon is 
momentanly at a higher level than the 
sea: its waters spill out into the open 
sea through the same porti at about 
the same speed and volume at which 
they entered, six hours before. 
Tus ebb and flow of salt 
water plays an essential réle in the life 
of Venice. It allows the lagoon and 
the urban canals, at present the only 
sewer system the city and the islands 
have, to be cleaned, or “swept” (as the 
ancient Venetians used to say.) And 
its oxygen content is almost sufficient 
to purify the water. In those interior 
canals where the flow is strong, the 
current carries away silt, keeping the 
waterways open, but where it is weak, 
they become blocked by silt deposits 
which build up at the rate of seven 
centimetres per year. 
Obviously, the movement of the 
lagoon - waters is not beneficial in 
every respect. The same currents 
that “sweep” the canals, eat into the 
foundations of the buildings which line 
them. Dramatic examples of the 
damage that can result from this 
insidious erosion occurred in June, 
1950, and again in January, 1952, when 
an entire wall of the ancient Fort of 
waters 
Sant’ Andrea and an abutment of the 
San Nicolo bridge collapsed into the 
waters of the canals near the mouth 
of the Lido. 
Moreover, in addition to the shores 
of the islands, the currents erode the 
porti themselves, gradually increasing 
their size and allowing more water to 
pass through them at greater speed, 
a phenomenon that gives rise to other 
dangers. 
These currents, accused of being 
much too weak when they are needed 
to clean out sluggish canals, and of 
being too strong and destructive in 
other respects, constituted a problem 
over which the Venetian Republic 
laboured with great difficulty in its 
search for satisfactory and permanent 
solutions. 
Veo must certainly pay a 
high price for the advantages of her 
porti in calm weather. When the sea 
and the winds beat against the city, 
they leave the lagoon exposed to the 
onslaught of the acqua alta, or “high 
water” (a temporary but critical 
increase in the level of the lagoon), 
and prompt many a Venetian to wish 
that it were completely cut off from 
the seal But once fine weather 
returns, they need only think of the 
stagnant, fetid pond that it would 
become if it were not connected to 
the sea, to be grateful for the regular 
irrigation of the salt water which has 
determined the rhythm of their life and 
culture for 15 centuries. 
It would be reasonable to suppose 
that the waters which pour into the 
lagoon at high tide through the narrow 
gaps in the off-shore barrier would 
blend together into one great body 
of water, which would then ebb away 
at random through one or other of the 
entrances, i.e. the water that entered 
at Malamocco would depart from 
Chioggia, and vice versa, In fact, 
such is not the case. 
The waters sweep in through the 
three porti at the same time, and 
spread out into the lagoon at different 
speeds. Although they draw close 
together, they do not merge, each 
staying within its invisible boundaries: 
horizontal movement is theoretically 
nil. As the tide ebbs, the waters 
retreat back to the sea along their 
same course, and leave the lagoon 
through the same porti by which they 
entered. 
These “watersheds” divide the 
lagoon into three basins of unequal 
size. The northern (Lido) basin, which 
contains the city itself, takes up 
nearly - half the area of the lagoon. 
The two others (Malamocco and 
Chioggia) respectively account for 
approximately 30 and 20 per cent of 
the area, including land, water and 
barene (islets and sand-banks, both

Below, Venice as depicted on a map made in 1534. Located on its 
archipelago of islands in the centre of the lagoon, the city is 
protected from the Adriatic only by a narrow cordon of islands and 
peninsulas bisected by channels through which flow the tides that 
clean and refresh the lagoon waters. Venice was formerly well 
protected from the sea, but today its safety is dangerously 
threatened by high water levels. Photo right shows the little 
island of Burano, in the north-eastern part of the lagoon. Around 
Burano spread the “barene”, marshlands which the sea covers 
at high tide, daily in certain places, from time to time in others. 
Many of these marshes have now been drained and consolidated 
to create new land for the development of industrial complexes.

dividing lines between these basins 
are often temporarily shifted by winds 
and other sources of instability. 
Movement through the lagoon, both 
for ships and sea currents, follows the 
channels between the shoals created 
by nature or dug by man, A look at 
a hydrographic chart shows how many 
there are and how tortuous are their

the lagoon, at a depth of 14.5 metres 
below sea level, from where it slopes 
up to 12.5 metres at Marghera: it will 
allow ships of 65 thousand tons to 
pass through to the oil port, and ships 
of 40 thousand tons to the industrial 
port. The channel project is part of 
a programme of economic expansion 
for reclaimed areas on the mainland.

same violence as they lashed the 
embankments. Certain experts are 
afraid that the freakish force of 
the waters and their power to erode 
the foundations of the city would only 
be strengthened by such changes, 
not to mention the probable increase 
in the occurrence of “high water.” 
They also feel that the new currents 
which are formed might gradually suck

Marghera, are artificial and mostly of 
recent construction. 
A potential danger for the historic 
city of Venice was created when large 
oil tankers started to take this route, 
via the Porto di Lido. It became clear 
that a more suitable approach had to 
be found for these cumbersome ships 
whose cargoes could catch fire, 
explode or leak out into the water. 
In 1953, the maritime section of the 
Ministry of Works proposed that a 
new navigable channel be opened 
between the Porto di Malamocco 
(further away from the city), and the 
industrial zone on the mainland. 
This new channel is nearing 
completion. Eighteen kilometres long 
and 180 metres wide, it begins in the 
and ultimately its ecology (the inter- 
relation of living organisms and their 
environments) and the security and 
preservation of historic Venice itself. 
According to experts from the 
Netherlands, a new deep channel 
between Malamocco and Marghera 
will certainly make the tides in the 
lagoon correspond more closely to 
sea tides; Venice would be nearer 
to the sea, so to speak, and there 
would be less difference between the 
high tide levels in the city and those 
in the open sea.

There are other experts who declare 
that if the Malamocco tidal basin were 
enlarged, the Lido basin would auto-

the force of the currents entering the 
Lido channel, and making them less 
erosive. But the capacity of these 
currents to “sweep” and purify their 
part of the lagoon and the canals of 
Venice by renewing their water, would 
also be reduced.

Sentinels against the invading sea 
thing is to promote the hydrodynamic 
exchanges which can cleanse the 
waters. Others consider that the 
speed of the currents pose a threat so 
serious that sooner or later, it will 
cause Venice to collapse. 
The pessimists also fear that the 
changes in the hydrodynamic structure 
of the lagoon, brought about by the 
large-scale projects in progress, will 
render Venice even more vulnerable 
to “high water.” 
Located off the north-south mainland 
shore are tiny islands caught in a 
network of micro-canals; they are 
covered by flowers which blossom 
into lilacs in summer and autumn, and 
provide a desolate haunt for sedentary 
and migratory birds. Some of these 
islands (the humid barene) are 
submerged at high tide while others 
(the dry barene) are permanently above 
water, except at times of “high water.” 
This landscape is gradually giving 
way to thermoelectric installations, oil 
and chemical factories, harbour 
facilities, residential districts, airports, 
and agricultural areas, as new sections 
of this “dead lagoon” are drained to 
meet the requirements of economic 
development. 
Earth dredged from the deep Mala- 
mocco-Marghera channel is brought 
by pipeline, and used to create 
1,200 hectares (almost 3,000 acres) of 
solid land. Destined to become the 
“Third Industrial Zone" of Venice- 
Marghera, this new area will rise from 
the lagoon bed to a height that will 
assure its safety, even from the most 
exceptional tides.

vw CET   
This industrial development and the 
alterations to the lagoon’s morphology 
are not looked upon with favour by 
those who, relying on the theories and 
experience of past centuries, advocate 
the preservation of the natural move- 
ment and equilibnum of the lagoon. 
In fact, where the Venetian Republic 
sought to protect the lagoon from 
encroachment by the mainland, the 
trend today is in the opposite direction. 
The determination of the ancient 
Venetians to preserve the barene, was 
based on the belief that these 
shallows, combined with the capillary 
attraction of water to the mainland, 
acted as a “regulating valve” in the 
complex dynamics of the lagoon tides. 
Today, the decrease in these natural 
overspill areas is generally regarded 
as one of the factors responsible for 
the increasingly severe floods suffered 
by Venice. 
Ls situation could de- 
teriorate even more if the Malamocco 
currents—their speed increased by the 
depth and straightness of the new 
channel—are no longer absorbed by 
the buffer zone of the barene, but 
instead hit an earthbank which could 
turn them back to the north, and 
possibly direct their force on Venice. 
Any increase in the proportion of 
land to water (two examples are 
Tronchetto, and other new islands, 
and the Liberta Bridge, linking Venice 
to the mainland), and even the 
installation of fish preserves, might 
compromise the secunty of Venice. 
  
Altering the shape of the lagoon 
would, of course, affect the movement 
of the tides and their currents (about 
which little is known even today), so 
the reclamation of the barene poses 
a definite problem. 
The authorities responsible for the 
monuments and historic buildings of 
Venice have stressed that if more 
marshy areas are dried out, the 
preservation of the cultural heritage 
of the city would be in potential 
danger. They have asked the 
appropriate ministries to re-examine 
the implications both of the work in 
progress and future projects. 
The ancient defences—earth and 
stone embankments, palisades and 
breakwaters—which the Venetians 
built to protect the eastern shores of 
the coastal islands, did not stand up 
for long against the repeated assaults 
of the great waves. And what 
remained of them were swept away 
by the tidal waves of 1686 and 1891. 
With their shore-lines their only 
defence, these sentinels, comprising 
from north to south the lido of 
Cavallino, the islands of San Erasmo, 
Vignole, Certosa and San Andrea, the 
off-shore regions of the Lido and 
Pellestrina, and the Lido of Sotto- 
marina, became more "and more vul- 
nerable as the waters ate into their 
banks, and their populations increased. 
To forestall the effects of the sea, 
the Venetian engineers conceived the 
Murazzi which, it was hopefully 
claimed, would “last longer than 
brass.” The project was completed 
WAVE-SMASHERS. 
These massive 
tetrahedral-shaped 
blocks of concrete 
J are used to 
reinforce the 
bastions which 
Venice has raised 
against the sea. 
Sunk along the 
shores of the 
Adriatic, they help 
to break the force 
of the waves and 
tidal currents that 
surge across the 
lagoon and smash 
against the 
unprotected city 
buildings. P

in 1782, after-38 years of work (the 
swan song of the republic, which only 
15 years later would surrender its 
sovereignty.) 
Built of Istrian stone and consisting 
of embankments, levees, and walls, 
these dikes protect over four 
kilometres of the shore of Pellestrina 
and more than one kilometre of 
Sottomarina's shore. They held firm 
until 1825, when a tidal wave damaged 
them. 
They were repaired but during the 
catastrophe of November 4, 1966, they 
were breached in several places. 
They are in the process of being 
rebuilt according to improved plans, 
and with the help of a government 
credit of 9,000 million lire to the muni- 
cipality. 
Another project that has been 
approved calls for the construction of 
sea defences on the islands in the 
mouth of the Lido channel. The Lido 
fs not defended by the Murazzi. 
Although its wide beaches ought to 
help protect it, the sand is carried 
away by the strong tides, and the 
-deposits which once helped to replace 
the sand have been greatly decreased 
+ by man-made river embankments. 
" Other impediments , are the upper 
breakwater of the Porto di Lido and 
the lower breakwater of the Porto di 
Chioggia, which stop sand from 
drifting in from the north and the south. 
Consequently, the beaches of the 
Lido and Pellestrina “loosen up” more 
each year and shrink, despite fresh 
loads of sand brought in at great 
expense by hotelkeepers. Even the 
ground supporting the Murazzi may be 
threatened eventually -by subsidence, 
due to this loss of sand. 
In an effort to retain the sand, small 
jetties perpendicular to the beaches, 
called pennelli, have been built. The 
same idea was unsuccessfully tried 
centuries ago by the Venetian 
Republic; unfortunately its effec- 
tiveness does not seem to have 
improved with time. 
A- ER the Murazzi have 
been rebuilt, the “sentinel islands” 
protected, and the beaches streng- 
thened, it should be possible at least 
to hope that the coast and the lagoon 
will be safe for a time from the fierce 
onslaughts of the sea, although it will 
still be able to enter the lagoon through 
the three porti of the Lido, Malamocco 
and Chioggia. 
The floods of November 4, 19686, 
which damaged Venice and the 
coastal islands, aroused the attention 
and sympathy of the world, and the 
concern of Unesco. Although a 
dramatic catastrophe, it was not 
unique; simply the most spectacular 
example of a recurring phenomenon— 
the aqua alta, or “high water.” 
“High water” is caused by the 
chance combination of lunar, meteor- 
ological, and hydrodynamic factors, 
and its nature is fairly well known. 
Less is known about what causes it. 
The effects of “high water” are 
increased by a permanent geophysical 
condition which, although not unique 
to Venice, takes on grave significance 
in the lagoon: the gradual settling of 
the lagoon bed, combined with the 
world-wide rise of the sea level, is 
causing the Venetian water level to 
rise at the rate of three centimetres 
every ten years. 
If all the “high water” factors were 
present at the same time, and at 
maximum strength—as could happen 
any autumn or spring—it has been 
calculated that the level of the lagoon 
would rise by 25 or even three 
metres, and Venice would drown. 
According to mathematical prob- 
ability, such a disaster could occur 
only once every ten thousand years. 
But a repeat of the November 4, 1966 
flood, which submerged Venice for 
24 hours under almost two metres 
of salt water, oll and mud, could 
happen every 250 years. And “high 
water” with levels only 50 centimetres 
less than that of the flood, can come 
much more often: in fact, on 
November 5, 1967, a year and a day 
after the 1966 flood, such high water 
conditions did occur, without making 
much impression on public opinion. 
Such calamities have always been 
frequent in Venice's history. But 
statistics show an extraordinary 
increase in the number of heavy floods 
in the last 25 years. None of the 
aforementioned crisis factors, or even 
the chronic condition which is causing 
Venice to sink, can explain this 
process. One theory is that the 
recent work carried out in the lagoon, 
which has led to changes in its 
original structure, could be partly 
responsible for this alarming develop- 
ment. 
The aqua alta is not a high tide,

### 59305: The Thousand paradoxes of Venice

© several 
THE THOUSAND PARADOXES (Continued) 
The missing steps in Canaletto’s paintings 
nor is it a freak tide, nor even a 
freak high tide: it is the result of the 
more or less normal phenomenon of 
the tide coming in on top of an 
abnormal and exceptional rise in the 
level of the sea. 
However, this exception is enough 
of a rule in Venice for the local 
language to distinguish between a 
normal, reasonable overflow from the 
sea, and the “exceptional” high water 
which exceeds the usual level and 
sweeps through the traditional de- 
fences, invading the countryside and 
flooding the ground floors of houses. 
When . the flooding assumes cata- 
strophic proportions, the Venetians 
ask many anxious questions about how 
to preserve their city and culture. 
According to scientists—geogra- 
phers, oceanographers and meteor- 
ologists—"high water” has numerous 
causes, and they must all be present 
to create a catastrophe. 
This confluence of unfavourable 
factors can only be attributed, in the 
hight of present knowledge, to the 
hazards of nature: it is impossible, at 
least for the present, to forecast when 
it will occur. As knowledge of the 
maritime, lagoon, lunar, atmospheric, 
and hydrodynamic laws grows, it 
should be possible to predict 
dangerous levels of “high water” 
hours in advance and, with 
the help of technology, avoid its more 
harmful effects. 
There is another phenomenon, which 
in its relentless development, con- 
tributes to the insecunty of the inhab- 
itants of the Venetian coastal area. 
It is caused by a general disturbance 
of the world's seas in combination 
with a specific disturbance of the 
lagoon bed. 
I. gradual rise in the 
earth's temperature—about one-tenth 
of a degree centigrade per century—is 
causing a general increase in the level 
of the world’s seas. As the glacial 
masses melt, the volume of the oceans 
grows, and raises the sea level along 
the coasts. 
In Venice, the speed of this 
increase has varied throughout the 
years; at present, it is estimated to 
rise 11 millimetres ever-ten years. 
At the same’ time, certain parts of the 
Venetian lagoon are settling. Marine 
tide-gauges show that the rise in the 
level of the lagoon always exceeds 
the readings taken elsewhere in the 
world: in other words, the lagoon is 
. steadily sinking. 
18 
The readings have revealed that 
in 83 years (1908-1961), the officially 
measured sites had settled between 
eight and 18 centimetres, depending 
on where they were located. ; 
Certain archaeological discoveries 
point .to the possibility that the rate 
of subsidence in Venice has recently 
increased: old paving stones have 
been found in the Piazza San Marco 
which, in relation to the present 
pavement, show an average subsid- 
ence of only about 11 to 12 centi- 
metres per century, instead of the 
present 30 centimetres. 
A study of the works of Venetian 
landscape artists supports this evi- 
dence. In paintings by Canaletto and 
Bellini, the number of steps showing 
above the water in front of churches, 
as well as the tide marks which they 
reproduced as a greenish trace in the 
mud on the walls, indicate an average 
rate of subsidence of 12.5 centimetres 
per century, when compared to the 
present position of these marks. 
F, every ten years, the sea 
rises about one centimetre and Venice 
sinks by two centimetres, then the 
water comes closer to the inhabitants 
at the rate of about three centimetres 
per decade, or more than 20 centi- 
metres during a normal lifetime. At 
this speed, the buildings are sinking 
one storey each thousand years. 
Natural and artificial causes are 
equally blamed for the subs:dence of 
the city and lagoon. The natural 
causes include deep tectonic phenom- 
ena, and the settling of the alluvial 
and marine deposits on which Venice 
1s built. 
The artificial causes excite more 
discussion, although there is a great 
deal about them which we do not 
know. The first cause concerns the 
diversion of the rivers, blamed for 
depriving Venice of new alluvial 
deposits, which could offset the na- 
tural settling process. 
The second cause involves the 
excessive weight of the new build- 
ings, which may have accelerated the 
setthng process: ancient Venice was 
built mostly of wood, but the pros- 
perous Republic was able to import 
Istrian stone, marble, etc. This 
“overweight” theory is reinforced by 
the fact that Marghera, at the height 
of its industrial development, settled 
more quickly than San Marco, possibly 
due to the heaviness of the factories 
which were built there. 
Excessive drainage of ground water 
from under and around Venice is also 
a possible cause of subsidence. 
Water from artesian wells has always 
supplied the city and the nearby 
region. But now infinitely greater 
quantities are being extracted to meet 
the recent needs of industry on the 
mainland. 
Settling may have also been pro- 
voked by drilling for methane gas in 
the Venice region. This possibility 
is based on experience in the Po 
valley where drilling for methane was 
prohibited after the surface had sunk 
in some places at the rate of 40 centi- 
metres per year, Similar situations 
have occurred in the United States 
and Japan. 
The aqua alta has been a part of 
Venetian life since its earliest history. 
The ancient chroniclers bear witness 
to the fact that no century was spared 
its effects: 
@® 589 “We live neither on water nor 
land”, said the people of Venice, 
quoted by Diacono in his Historia 
Langobardorum. 
® circa 782 “There was so much 
water that almost all the islands 
were submerged”. 
® 875 “The water flooded the entire 
city, penetrating the churches and 
the houses”. 
@® 1102 “Earthquake and 
flooding”. 
The floods of medieval Venice have 
been more than matched by those of 
recent times: in 1960, the water 
reached a height of 1.45 metres; in 
1966, 1.95 metres; in 1967, 1.45 metres. 
Fifty-eight times in the last century, 
the waters in Venice have flooded to 
over one metre above their average 
level. Of these 58 floods, 48 occurred 
in the last 35 years, and 30 in the 
last ten years, alone. 
These almost chronic inundations, 
which Venetians have been compelled 
to accept as one of the less pictur- 
esque aspects of their city, are 
definite cause for alarm, especially 
because of their effects on the eco- 
nomic and social life of the city. 
With the ground floors of houses 
uninhabitable, constant dampness and 
interrupted communications, Venetians 
are gradually moving away from their 
historic city. And they are not leaving 
Venice for fear that they will be 
drowned within the next ten thousand 
years. They're simply tired of getting 
their feet wet every day.

Veuce is falling prey to the 
harsh fate awaiting all old cities. It is 
slowly dying of precisely those things 
it gives life to. The past is being 
sacrificed to the present to satisfy the 
requirements of modern life. In place 
of XVIth century Venice, the Venice 
Sansovino knew with its orchards and 
kitchen-gardens, Venice is already 
ttle more than a heterogeneous 
collection of lovely buildings, slums, 
factories—in other words, a mixture 
of the sublime and the hideous. 
Unless we are watchful, the 
ceaseless struggle nature wages 
against the works of men looks like 
leaning in the former's favour and 
depriving mankind soon of part of his 
artistic and cultural heritage. 
On a site that was unhealthy at the 
outset’ but admirably well-protected, - 
lying between sky and sea, arose’ the 
most harmonious artistic and archi- 
tectural entity in existence, even 
though this underlying unity may not 
be immediately apparent at all levels 
to the hurried traveller. 
There is a critical tradition which 
complacently stresses the variety to 
be found in Venetian architecture. 
The fact that whole dynasties = of 
sculptors and builders, such as the 
Bons or the Lombardis, linked their 
genius- and combined. their craft 
traditions when working in the white 
stone of Istria or in marble, and that 
certain complete units were left to 
the care of a single creative genius— 
such as Sansovino, who designed the 
Piazzetta di San Marco at the 
beginning of the XVIth century—is not 
adequate to explain the profound unity 
of Venice.

### 59307: The City of ten thousand masterpieces

MASTERPIECES 
Many Venetian sculptors and craftsmen

works. Below, detail of a balustrade

breakwater, loved to read all about 
him “those stone chronicles recorded 
by time and the arts” and to identify 
at a glance” nine centuries of archi- 
tecture to which all the regions of 
Italy had contributed. 
And, indeed, Venetian architecture 
may be seen as being made up solely 
of compromises, of an accumulation of 
elements from the Italian, Arabic, 
Byzantine, Gothic, Renaissance and 
Baroque styles. But therein lies the 
miracle; Venice as a whole has 
succeeded in reconciling the apparent 
contradictions in these various styles. 
The dispanty, which is particularly 
noticeable in the uneven lines of the 
facades, vanishes in the overall 
prevailing light and in the reflexions 
of the canal waters that flow beside 
palaces and houses; a rhythmic 
repetition of a single theme which, in 
terms of the city as a whole, restores 
the unity which may not be found in 
buildings taken singly. 
This basic pattern, founded on three 
constantly recurring elements—the rio, 
the ponte, and the calle (1)—by 
repeating itself over and over and 
spreading concentrically out from the 
original nucleus of the Rialto bridge, 
has conditioned the shape of Venice, 
and is further emphasized and made 
more harmonious by restrictions on 
the height of buildings. This pattern 
is admirably fitted to the omnipresent 
element of water with the 180 canals 
spanned by 378 bridges. Nowhere 
else in the world is the marriage of 
stone, sky and water so pronounced. 
Whether you are entering the 
Palazzo Ducale, the Ca d'Oro, a little 
church or an old house, the impression 
is the same, though naturally on 
differing scales. One feels that if a 
© carving were missing from a facade, 
a fresco from a church, or a balustrade 
from a house, we should sorely feel 
the loss, for the absence of a single 
detail, however small, would destroy 
that unity that delights us. 
And the same applies to the interior 
decoration, which goes, logically and 
inevitably, hand in hand with the 
outside, and is indispensable to the

10,000 MASTERPIECES (Continued) 
The agony of the martyred stones 
artistic balance of the city. Inside we 
have a series of frescos covering walls 
and ceilings, stucco motifs along the 
overhang of upper storeys, trompe- 
I'ceil painting carrying on where stone 
architecture leaves off, works of 
Veronese at San Sebastiano, Tintoretto 
at the Scuola di San Rocco, Tiepolo 
at La Pietad and the Gesuati, religious 
paintings as well as decorative friezes 
—all this is subordinate to the 
architectural effect and, like it, has 
a unity and coherence that springs 
from its very diversity. 
Spiritual heir to the San Marco 
mosaics, the interior decoration of the 
buildings has always retained some- 
thing of the ornamental role it had 
played from the start. This goes back 
to the nich splendour of the Venetian- 
Byzantine style, with its brilliant 
display of marble and gold, for the 
Venetians held the view that painting 
should be “above all decorative, a 
thing for the eye, an expanse of colour 
on the wall,” as English novelist and 
critic Walter Pater said. 
  
This decoration emphasizes the 
continuity in the overall look of Venice. 
Even the pieces of interior decorative 
art—statues, easel-paintings, pyxes or 
lecterns—form an integral part of the 
bulldings to which centuries of 
common history have indissolubly 
assoclated them. 
The Venetians have, from the earliest 
times, been concerned with the moods 
of the lagoon and the periodic 
variations in the level of its waters. 
However, as time passes, the cumu- 
lative effects of high water result 
in increasingly great disasters with 
each successive “flood.” Sooner or 
later, they are bound to affect the very 
existence of Venice. 
Humidity, which was further in- 
creased and became more penetrating 
as a consequence of the “high water” 
of November 4, 1966, is directly or 
indirectly affecting all Venice's works 
of art. In the church of San 
Sebastiano, containing masterpieces of 
Veronese, seepage has occurred 
through the walls up to more than

twelve feet above the paving, as well 
as in the church of the Terese. 
The fate of works of art and the 
future of architectural structures are 
further threatened by the eroding 
action of the canal waters which are 
laying the foundations of buildings 
bare and submitting the walls to shght 
but continual vibrations. The living 
organisms in the water eat away at 
the piles: salt, which is a strong 
corrosive, attacks all stonework and is 
now gradually wearing down what 
was once raised thanks to the pros- 
perity of the salt industry. Salt crusts 
that form on the surface of facades, 
of murals, and of easel-paintings, are 
a constant worry to curators. But this 
1s not the only threat to Venice's art. 
As in all modern cities, there is a 
great deal of atmospheric pollution, 
which causes “stone disease” and 
affects pictures badly. We need only 
reflect that each year, simply in 
the nearby small industrial town 
of Marghera, the quantity of fuel 
burned releases over 15,000 tons of 
concentrated sulphuric acid into the 
atmosphere, from which it returns in 
the form of rain. 
Again, while the pigeons are one 
of the attractions of the Piazza San 
Marco, they are also a mortal danger 
to the city's works of art. Without 
mentioning the damage caused by their 
droppings to facades and sculptures, 
these droppings have throughout the 
years accumulated dangerously in the 
roof timbers of the palaces, whose 
floors are sagging beneath the weight 
of layers of guano inches thick. At 
San Moise, whose roof was blown off 
by the high winds that accompanied 
the floods in November 1966, more 
than ten hundredweight of droppings 
were found on the back of Nicolo 
Bambini’'s “Moses and the Eternal 
Father" when the picture was taken 
from the ceiling for restoration. 
These are the more obvious kinds 
of damage that anybody can see. 
Although their importance should not 
be underestimated, they should not 
cause us to overlook a number of

Venice at the peak of te 
its wealth and renown 
could call on the 
greatest artists to 
embellish its palatial 
buildings. Master 
painters such as Titian, 
Giorgone and Veronese 
did not consider it 
beneath them to 
decorate the outside 
walls of these noble 
structures. But today 
most of these outdoor 
paintings are damaged 
or completely effaced. 
Atmospheric pollution 
is increasingly 
responsible for their 
deterioration (15,000 
tons of sulphuric acid 
are showered over 
Venice annually by 
factories at nearby 
Marghera). This 16th 
century work by Titian 
in the courtyard of the 
Fondaco dei Tedeschi 
was removed for 
preservation in 1967. 
Forty years earlier it 
could have been saved 
undamaged.  Ph

450 palaces, 200 churches now threatened 
physical-chemical causes and other 
phenomena whose action is partic- 
ularly terrible because it is slow and 
insidious, almost invisible even. 
In Venice nothing is spared, not 
even the bronze horses above the 
central entrance of the basilica of San 
Marco. We need only mention certain 
names, representative of many other 
simlar cases of diseases affecting 
the whole of Venice: 
— there are cracks in the Porta 
dei Fionn of the basilica and the 
columns and capitals are liable to 
collapse any day; 
— the Contarini column (XVlith 
century) on Murano is crumbling; 
— the Gothic sculptures of the 
Frari are weathering as a result of 
atmospheric corrosion and are dis- 
appearing beneath pigeon droppings; 
— mould is growing on the mural 
paintings (by Fabio Canal) in the 
church of San Martino di Castello; 
— the overhanging triptych and 
the angels of the Tullo Lombardo 
altar (late XVth century) and the 
panelling in the chapels are falling 
into decay; 
— the paintings displayed in church 
sacristies are blackened and in a 
pitiable state: 
The San Canciano altar-place, 
Giovanni Bellini's “Madonna” (1507), 
the “Virgin Enthroned” by Negroponte 
(c. 1450), the “Saint Nicolas in Glory” 
at San Giovanni in Bragora (XVth 
century), the “Scene from the Hebrew 
Passover” by Pietro Malombra and 
Antonio Vassilacchi (I'Aliense, XVth 
century) at San Pietro di Castello, the 
painted ceiling by Antonio Fumiani 
(some thirty years’ work, from 1680 
to 1704) at San Pantaleone, the paint- 
ings of Veronese at the Palazzo 
Trevisano, on Murano, those of Tie- 
polo, the San Sebastiano frescos. 
— the monumental sculptures of 
the Salute are liable to fall at any 
moment (one broke away in 1966); 
— the Ca d'Oro, Santa Maria dei 
Miracoli (late XVth century), the 
church of the Terese... 
And the list is far from complete: 
there are more than, 10,000 mon- 
uments and works of art in Venice 
classified as being of historic interest. 
Each of these sets a problem of its 
own — sometimes several at once — 
which must be solved. Nowhere else 
in the world is there such a high 
concentration of masterpieces or 
works characteristic of a particular 
period or style. 
Behind the mask of its charming 
facades, Venice, when examined 
closely, is severely disfigured. Cor- 
rosion and pollution which may either 
have begun long ago (when the city 
was founded in fact) or have started 
recently, and now often progressing 
at an alarming rate, are attacking the 
city’s walls and decorative elements. 
The unfortunate thing about Venice 
is that it contains all the conditions 
bound to bring about rapid and ines- 
capable decay. Venice is gradually 
subsiding into the mud of its lagoon. 
Protected from the sea as it is, by 
its offshore bars, this would not be 
too serious: a thousand years from 
now Venice would still be afloat. 
But even so the hydrographical be- 
haviour of the lagoon must be 
watched and not disturbed by breach- 
ing the bars without proper precaut- 
ions (as has already been done for the 
improvement of the Malamocco 
channel) and an attempt should be 
made simultaneously to lower the 
water level by erecting dams. 
As regards structural decay 
and the diseases of stone, the causes 
have been scientifically identified and 
the appropriate treatment is known. 
We have learnt how to fight the for- 
midable “thiobacillus” and the nitri- 
fying bacteria, how to treat the 
leprosy of marble and granite, how 
to clean and protect paintings and 
how to dry and restore frescos. 
And yet in spite of that, each year 
Venice loses 6 per cent of its marble 
works, 5 per cent of its frescos, 3 per 
cent of its canvas paintings and 
2 per cent of its wood paintings. 
This is an enormous proportion. At 
this rate, in thirty years’ time there 
will remain barely half of what makes 
present-day Venice a “peerless gem.” 
This does not include libraries, arch- 
ives and craft products or church 
collections, which are disappearing at 
a similar rate, 
The preservation and restoration of 
all Venice's works of art set many 
problems for experts, whether archi- 
tects, hydrographers or town-planners. 
Many works have already been saved 
(canvases have been removed from 
their supports, rolled and restored, 
frescos have been dried, houses 
consolidated, and so on) by the 
Departments of Monuments and Fine 
Arts. But there is still an immanse 
amount of work to be done: more 
than 450 palaces or old houses, more 
than 200 places of worship and 
churches are in jeopardy. 
Apart from the purely technical 
aspects of saving this artistic and 
cultural heritage, there are problems 
of finance, expropriation, rehousing, 
taxation, town-planning and admin- 
istration. 
Venice, however, has no wish to 
be merely a museum. Its population 
is not made up solely of aesthetes 
and museum curators. The needs of 
modern life call for constant improve- 
ments in housing, in the setting up 
of industries (to provide work for the 
people and to keep the city alive), 
in transport and communications. 
This museum-city, the “citta nobi- 
lissima e singolare”™ of Sansovino, 
does not wish to be behind the times. 
There can be only one answer to the 
proposed alternative of saving the 
stones or saving the inhabitants: 
Venice must remain true to itself and 
develop without disowning its past. 
Venice without its inhabitants would 
no longer be Venice. Venice without 
its monuments and its setting would 
no longer be Venice. Neither alter- 
native is acceptable. But how can 
its heritage be saved while respecting 
the requirements of development? 
This is the greatest and most impor- 
tant problem for Venice to overcome. 
Looked at from a narrow viewpoint, 
the problems that Venice has to face 
might appear to be a painful accu- 
mulation of natural factors and of 
human failings. Yet in fact they are 
simply the result of the gradual evol- 
ution of an environment. Man's action 
takes place against the background of 
this evolution. To attempt to solve 
these problems, all the elements of 
Venetian hfe must be analyzed, and 
the skills of specialists in all the 
necessary branches be combined 
with those of the Venetian experts. 
But co-operation is not only of value 
for the purposes of study and 
research: it is also essential in 
reaching decisions and in making use 
of the resources made available. 
Imagination will likewise be needed, 
for new techniques will have to be 
found: techniques to harness the 
currents without letting the lagoon 
silt up; to kill the micro-organisms in 
the water without poisoning it; to 
counteract the effects of storms 
without disfiguring the city or the site; 
to consolidate Venice without having 
to demolish and then rebuild it; to 
preserve it for dreamers without there- 
by losing touch with reality. This 
will need something more than know- 
ledge or imagination — it will require 
positive genius. It would be too much 
to expect this from one man or even 
from a single group of experts.

Nor is it any use saving marbles 
and frescos if they are condemned to 
disappear beneath the waters; nor 
building sluices without first setting 
up a meteorological station able to 
forecast squalls and to close the 
gates; nor damming the approaches 
to the lagoon without also building 
sewers; nor reinforcing foundations If 
walls are allowed to collapse; nor 
improving the housing without provid- 
ing adequate communications; nor 
building an underground railway sys- 
tem if nobody wants any longer to 
come to Venice — the Venetians be- 
cause they find the city uninhabitable 
and old-fashioned, others because it 
has been “over-renovated.” 
If the choice of measures is left 
solely to curators, they would, no 
doubt, consider it safer to turn the 
historical centre into a museum, which 
will mean the end of Venice, since 
Venice, for those who love it, is not 
a lifeless record of a vanished civiliz- 
ation but a place where they like to 
come and live out their dreams. If, 
on the other hand, the choice is left 
to the technocrats, they will rely on 
“decision theory” and choose the 
most economically viable solution. 
And they may not be too far wrong, 
either, if it costs a fortune to build 
dikes, and Venice does not have, or 
is unable to raise the necessary 
money. Loans are made only to the 
rich. The ancient city of Venice must 
be able to recover its former prosper- 
ity if is to avoid the risk of being 
abandoned to its fate. 
Modern constructions must not be 
condemned, however sacrilegious they 
are, if they bring prosperity to Venice.

### 59311: Venice and the Venetians of tomorrow

VENICE AND THE VENETIANS 
OF TOMORROW 
Vee is dying—and not 
only because the ground is sinking 
and the sea rising, the trees decaying 
and the frescos fading. The buildings, 
too; are slowly falling into ruin, exuding 
the death smell of places long un- 
inhabited. 
The insular situation that was once 
the strength of Venice has become, 
with time, a serious handicap. Over 
the last two centuries the city has 
gradually been deprived of its func- 
tions, first as a State capital, then 
as the regional capital. While its 
rivals in northern Italy were develop- 
ing with extraordinary speed, the 
former Queen of the Adriatic seemed 
to have missed the turning that led 
to a modern economy, and to have 
been immobilized within the confines 
of an island grown too small. From 
being a community of big land owners, 
merchants and lawyers, it gradually 
became a city of clerks and civil 
servants. 
Losing their importance in a world 
where industnal production is a prime 
requisite, yet without becoming really 
impoverished, the old anstocracy has 
suffered, since the fall of the Republic 
right up to the present day, from a 
sense of having come down in the 
world. Hence the temptation to 
withdraw more and more, system- 
atically keeping up the traditions of 
an illustnous past and rejecting 
everything new, 
“Venice,” wrote Mary McCarthy, 
“has always been a foster-mother to 
the old.” People might go to Venice 
to die, but they die at an advanced 
age. Titian was a hundred years old 
at the time of his death, and even 
then he succumbed only to the plague. 
Even today, “it's a good place to 
grow old in,” say the senior citizens 
of Venice, whose age it is impossible 
to guess. 
Venice's population statistics show 
that, between 1871 and 1951, the 
a 
In the last ten years the population of 
Venice has dropped by 40,000. One 
explanation for this exodus is that 
Venetians “are fed up with getting their 
feet wet every day” as a Unesco report 
states. Left, pedestrians make their 
way over a causeway of planks laid 
across the flooded Square of St. Mark's. 
population doubled. But it should be 
noted that these figures refer to the 
whole commune of Venice, which 
includes not only the historic centre 
and the islands of Murano and Burano, 
but also the estuary and the mainland, 
with Marghera and the old neigh- 
bouring communes attached to the 
former Venetian Republic. During 
this same period, while the population 
of the mainland rose by 481 per cent, 
and that of the Lido and Malamocco 
by 654 per cent, the population of 
the old historic centre rose only at 
the modest annual rate of 1.2 per cent. 
But from 1951 onwards the situation 
altered completely. While the popu- 
lation of the mainland and the 
estuary has continued to nse, that 
of the islands is steadily falling. The 
area compnsing Venice proper and 
the islands of Murano and Burano 
shrank from 191,200 inhabitants in 
1951 to 135,800 in 1966, representing 
an average loss of 3,500 inhabitants 
a year. 
0 VER the last ten years the 
total population of the commune has 
increased by 31,000 while the old town 
has lost nearly 40,000 inhabitants. 
Were this loss of population to 
continue at an average rate of 
2,000 inhabitants a year, the old part 
of Venice would have no more than 
97,800 inhabitants by 1981—in other 
words it would have lost over half 
its population in thirty years. There 
would be more old people than 
children and more women than men. 
Forty-four per cent of those leaving 
the city centre are under thirty and 
71 per cent under forty-five. The 
emigrants therefore come mainly from 
the younger sections of the population. 
The effects of the aging of a commu- 
nity on Its economic capacities are 
only too well known. The proportion 
of inactive old people to those gain- 
fully employed was 13 per cent in 
the island centre in 1951, Today it 
has nsen above 19 per cent. 
Where do the Venetians go when 
they leave the old city? Seventy-eight 
per cent stay in the commune and 
settle on the mainland or at the Lido. 
Today in 1968 about two out of three 
Venetians live outside the island 
centre either on the mainland or on 
the coast. 
The number of jobs in the islands 
has not decreased in the last fifteen 
years. Whereas there has been a 
falling off in employment in all bran- 
ches of the primary and secondary 
occupations (agriculture, fishing, in- 
dustry and the building trade), the 
tertiary sector (commerce and ser- 
vices) has increased in importance. 
The most noticeable development has 
been in the retall trade, the hotel 
industry, banking and insurance, and 
various types of services. This in- 
crease is due mainly to the develop- 
ment of the tourist industry. 
More foreigners go to Venice in 
July, August and September than 
during all the other nine months put 
together and this seasonal concen- 
tration necessanly has a prejudicial 
effect on its economy. 
Moreover, as is well known, Venice 
has to contend with serious com- 
petition from neighbouring resorts. The 
city has too few hotel rooms in 
summer; more than half its hotels are 
closed in winter. The improvement 
of hotel accommodation obviously 
depends on the flow of holiday makers 
being spread over the whole year. 
And it is unrealistic to hope that 
investments will be made while the 
hotels are full only three months in 
the year. 
Contrary to popular belief, the 
tourist trade is not Venice's main 
source of income. Its traditional crafts, 
and the activites of its commercial 
port have an equally important place 
in its economy. 
At first glance, the development of 
sea traffic gives no reason for 
concern. But the prospects are not 
very reassuring. For 1,000 years, 
Venice has been one of the most 
active ports in the world. But today 
the port of Marghera, on the mainland, 
is the principal industrial port. Where- 
as the capacity of the old city’s port 
is 1,800,000 tons, that of the new town 
is 15,000,000 tons. 
Half the economic activities of the 
Venetian commune as a whole are 
linked with port activities. In the old 
city itself, the livelihood of 20 to 
30 per cent of men with families 
depends on jobs connected with the 
port. If the future of the historic 
centre as a port were to be endan- 
gered, its demographic and social 
future would surely suffer, for a very 
large proportion of its population 
would be affected by this economic 
transformation. So 1t is understand-

### 59311: Venice and the Venetians of tomorrow

VENICE AND THE VENETIANS OF TOMORROW (Continued) 
Behind the lovely facade—a mass exodus 
able, that many Venetians choose 
to make their living on the mainland. 
As the number of jobs in the island 
centre has increased since 1951, and 
the number of “employable” people 
has gone down, there are at present 
more jobs in the city (about 12,000) 
than there are people to fill them. It 
is the first time in their history that 
the islands have been short of 
manpower, 
It is not therefore because they 
cannot find work that Venetians are 
leaving their ancient home. Nor is 
it because they earn less there than 
elsewhere—wages are higher in the 
old town than on the mainland, which 
is why Venice manages to bring in 
from outside, every day, the 12,000 
extra workers that it needs. The main 
reason for the gradual depopulation 
of Venice is the housing situation. 
When the exodus began in 1951, 1t 
was estimated that Venice needed 
16,500 new dwellings, apart from the 
renovation of existing buildings. In- 
stead, only 2,700 homes were built 
between 1951 and 1961. In the 
meantime, over 6,000 families, tired 
of the conditions in which they were 
living, left Venice. 
  
While the rate at which habitations 
were being put up grew steadily 
slower, the depopulation of Venice 
continued. Repairs and improvements 
to old dwellings practically ground to 
a halt. 
By 1966, the situation was com- 
pletely reversed: only 40,000 families 
remained in Venice, and there were 
too many flats. Venice became, in 
this respect, one of Italy's most 
privileged cities. One would think that 
people would be glad to live there— 
but they are not. For, compared with 
the general European standard of 
housing, Venice is definitely under- 
privileged. 
A survey made in 1957 showed that 
conditions were as deplorable as 
regards both the structural repair of 
the houses and their sanitation and 
habitability. Sixty-six per cent of the 
housing blocks required major repairs. 
Nearly 40 per cent of the dwellings 
were either uninhabitable or over- 
crowded. Seventy-five per cent of 
the flats had no bathroom. Central 
heating was practically non-existent, 
and in 60 per cent of the dwellings the 
kitchen was the only source of heat. 
Besides all this, there were the 
disadvantages of poor natural lighting, 
dampness and the general incon- 
venience of the premises. Rents are 
also higher than anywhere else in Italy, 
and maintenance and repair services 
are very costly because of the city's 
communications problems and diffi- 
culties in transporting matenals. 
All this is not calculated to en- 
courage people to remain in the old 
city. The young complain about the 
lack of recreational facilities, when 
the space for sports grounds could 
easily be found. Venetians accepted 
such living conditions for centuries, 
because they were no worse than 
elsewhere, But they are worse now, 
since new towns have sprung up 
everywhere and the discrepancy 
between housing facilities in island 
Venice and on the mainland has re- 
cently become greater. It is the 
houses of Mestre and the Lido, 
commonplace but comfortable, which 
for fifteen years have been attracting 
so many Venetians. 
The basic problem, therefore, is 
that of restoring, improving and mod- 
ernizing existing dwellings. It is not 
enough merely to save the palaces 
and mansions from destruction; it is 
equally urgent to make the town

problems of Venice and

the special study made 
by Unesco, 47 per cent 
of Venice's buildings are 
in need of repair, 
16 per cent are gravely 
dilapidated and 50 per 
cent are damp-infested. 
The renovation of 
housing in Venice is an 
urgent task, but the 
cost will be enormous.

VENICE AND THE VENETIANS OF TOMORROW (Continued) 


### 59311: Venice and the Venetians of tomorrow

Building the new image of Venice | 
habitable, not only for its citizens, 
but also for the visitors it 1s seeking 
to attract. 
For several centuries Venice has 
been a weary city, but she has never 
given up the struggle. The people 
are used to seeking for ways and 
means of making up for the loss of 
traditional sources of income wherever 
they are to be found. 
Obliged to offer services which 
could not be found elsewhere Venice 
finally adopted, in 1917, a formula 
which was then new to Italy: that of 
the Industrial port. The idea, to quote 
the originator of the project, was “to 
bring ships to the factory doors.” 
Instead of being, like a merchant 
port, a place where goods are kept 
in bond or in transit, the new port was 
to be a vast complex of factories. 
And so Marghera was created. This 
new Venetian town was not built on 
the mainland proper, but on 550 hec- 
tares of barene (sand-banks) rein- 
forced with soil from the lagoon bed 
and raised to a height of some eight 
feet above sea level. Factories were 
being set up even before the port 
was finished. 
The pressure of expanding industry 
soon forced Marghera to breaking 
point, and a second industrial zone 
was begun, now to be followed by a 
third, much more ambitious than the 
other two. The ground on which the 
third zone will be built is still being 
consolidated. The new industrial, 
commercial and oil ports will not be 
functioning fully until 1980. But there 
are already 211 companies in Marghera 
employing 40,000 workers. 
H the old town benefited 
appreciably up to now from the pro- 
gress made by industry on the main- 
land? The increase of traffic in the 
port does not affect it, as this consists 
mainly of supplies for industry itself, 
and of oil, the unearned increment on 
which goes to foreign investors. The 
municipal budget has derived hardly 
any wealth from the mainland. 
The new town costs the municipality 
more than it brings in, and improve- 
ments needed to schools, the road 
system, public transport and cultural 
amenities would cost quite as much 
as the restoration of the historic part 
of the city. 
As a result, Venetians on both sides 
of the lagoon complain of having to 
pay heavier taxes than the inhabitants: 
of other large towns. The modern 
town was to be a fine example of 
town-planning. It is nothing of the 
sort. The traffic jams and parking 
problems in Mestre are enough to 
make the inhabitants pine for the quiet 
calli of historic Venice. Water and 
electricity supplies and the drainage 
system present problems as complex 
as those of purifying the water of the 
lagoon, and the mainland itself is 
periodically threatened by floods. The 
destiny of Venice is indeed difficult 
to shake off! 
Legislation has it that the islands 
and the mainland form a single 
commune. But the necessary inter- 
communication between the old city 
and the mainland still has to be 
established. The Venetians hardly 
know where their city begins and 
ends. When we speak of the 
depopulation of Venice, we are not 
thinking of the commune, since its 
population is increasing; and when 
the inhabitants of Venice go to live 
in Mestre, they have the feeling of 
moving, not to another district, but 
to another town. The mainland 1s 
another country, another way of life, 
another society. 
Business concerns recognize this 
Banks, Insurance companies and 
department stores know they would 
lose customers among the mainland 
population (that. is, two Venetians out 
of three) if they did not open branches 
in Mestre, pending the transfer of their 
headquarters there, 
It is not only the people on the 
mainland who feel they belong to a 
different world. Most of the Venetians 
in the old town feel that the industrial 
development of Marghera does not 
concern them. The initiative of the 
money, the organization and the staff 
of this industrial complex come from 
Milan, they say, and the products are 
not sold in Venice to the Venehans 
but in Milan to the Milanese. Nothing 
can convince Venice that the develop- 
ment of the mainland will not in the 
end continue independently of the old 
city, and even at its expense. 
However much goodwill they show, 
Venice and the mainland are bound 
to separate sooner or later, unless 
the island centre really needs 
Marghera, and vice versa. 
Cities everywhere in the world are 
trying to decentralize their activities 
and divide up work among their 
different districts, so as to solve 
zoning problems. They all aim at 
becoming “polycentric.” Venice al- 
ready is. 
Better housing and easier and faster 
means of communication are what the 
Venetians most often demand. Some 
innovators have proposed various 
solutions to the water-traffic problem: 
“waterbugs” (silent, electric mini- 
taxis), amphibious buses and hydro- 
foils; but the effect of the waves 
set up by such powerful craft would 
probably be disastrous for the city's 
ancient buildings. 
Land transport has been, and still 
is, the subject of heated argument. 
Some say that a new bridge must be

Problems of urban 
communication and the high 
cost of transporting building 
materials are serious 
obstacles to the upkeep of 
buildings in Venice, which are 
falling into disrepair (right, 
portico of a house which has 
tumbled into the San Severo 
canal, now closed because of 
such hazards). The 
40,000 families who live in 
Venice would like to see an 
improvement in their housing 
and also a modernization of 
communications within their 
city and with the mainland 
(above, a boat follows the 
twisting channels between the 
marshy banks of the lagoon 
which appear at low tide). 
Plans are being studied for 
an underground railway to 
link the various parts of the 
city and to connect with the 
mainland (top left, model of 
the underground as it would 
run beneath the Grand Canal).

VENICE 
LINK BETWEEN 
ORIENT & OCCIDENT 
by Marcel Brion 
of the Académie Francaise 
  
  
  
   
 
    
THE GREAT DOGE LOREDAN. Several versions exist of this 
famous portrait of Leonardo Loredan (1438-1521) Dege of the 
Republic of Venice. One painting hangs in the Museo Correr in 
Venice; another in the Academia Carrara at Bergamo; a third in the 
Dresden Art Gallery; and a fourth in the Museum of San Francisco, 
U.S.A. Painted in 1501, the work has been attributed to Carpaccio 
or to Giovanni Bellini. But there can be no doubt that it was 
painted by a great Venetian artist. 
NS 
On the facade of St.Mark’s 
Cathedral, four colossal 
bronze horses (detail right) 
stamp their hooves on a 
platform overlooking the great 
square, They have reached 
Venice after a long odyssey. 
Probably Greek in origin, 
they once surmounted the 
triumphal arch of Nero 
and later that of Trajan in 
Rome. They were taken to 
Constantinople by the 
Emperor Constantine in the 
4th century and brought from 
there to Venice by the Doge, 
Enrico Dandolo, in 1204. 
Napoleon Bonaparte installed 
them in Paris in 1797, and 
in 1815 they were returned 
to Venice. 
A- the time when the Huns, 
following their unsuccessful attempt 
to invade China, were turning their 
predatory ambitions westward, abrupt 
and violent movements of peoples 
occurred, setting off what is known in 
German as the "Volkerwanderungen”, 
the Great Migrations. 
From Central Asia to the Danube 
and the Rhine, Teutons and Slavs, 
retreating in confusion before the on- 
slaught of the Huns, drove one another 
from the lands of their ancestors 
and, drawn by the fascination of the 
South which has always stirred Nor- 
dic peoples, crossed the great river 
barriers and made their way down to 
France and ltaly. 
The shores of the Adriatic and the 
hinterland, which was linked to them 
politically and economically, were 
inhabited by the Veneti, who had 
begun to take advantage of their easy 
access to the sea by fitting out small 
fleets of merchant vessels, and when 
necessary, of warships. 
When they were overtaken by the 
influx of migrating Teutonic and Slav 
tribes, who had been driven from their 
homelands by the Huns, the Veneti 
found that their best hope of safety lay 
in retreating to the thickly-scattered 
islands in the lagoon formed by the 
delta of the Po.

LINK BETWEEN ORIENT AND OCCIDENT (Continued) 
City of mariners, traders and artists 
wedded to the sea 
The “barbarians,” excellent horse- 
men but not seafarers, out of their ele- 
ment when they were not in the 
saddle, were forced to abandon the 
pursuit and leave the Veneti at peace 
in their island retreats. The lime- 
stone mountains walling in the hinter- 
land of the Venetian States had been 
no obstacle to the hordes of Attila or 
his Teutonic and Slav allies; but water 
was an impassable barrier to peoples 
who could neither build nor handle 
boats. 
Thus, secure from invasion in their 
new homes on the islands of the 
lagoon, the inhabitants of Aquileia, 
Altinum, Concordia, and Heracieia 
energetically developed a civilization 
based originally on trade in salt— 
abundantly provided by the still waters 
of the lagoon—and on fishing. 
New towns such as Torcello, which 
had a population of 20,000 but flour- 
ished only for a brief period, and 
Venice, smaller but destined to a glor- 
ious future, acquired economic im- 
portance from the advantages of being 
situated on islands, free from trouble- 
some neighbours, and able to devote 
themselves to trade at a time when 
the major mainland States were contin- 
ually being shaken by serious politi- 
cal crises. 
suns civilizations born 
and developing under such conditions 
rapidly rise to prosperity and fame 
which, because they are impregnable 
to threats from any quarter, enable 
them in turn to impose their pre- 
ponderant power and influence. 
Crete, the centre of the great 
Aegean civilization, acquired the mas- 
tery of the Mediterranean and impart- 
ed her culture to the peoples living 
around it; England, never invaded 
since the Battle of Hastings, when the 
Normans established their footing on 
English soil, early developed an imper- 
ial role; Venice became Queen of the 
Adriatic in the early Middle Ages, first 
with the consent of, and later in oppo- 
sition to, Byzantium. 
All these are examples of what can 
be achieved—given the two balancing 
factors of favourable geographical 
“isolation” and considerable overseas 
expansion—by nations of bold sea- 
farers, astute traders, and statesmen 
skilful both in using strong trading links 
as a basis for building up the diploma- 
tic relations which help to stimulate 
trade, and in using trade itself, with 
the wealth it commands and confers, 
to establish trading posts, open up 
spheres of influence, and impose overt 
or hidden forms of protectorate and 
colonization on nations which earlier 
had opened their doors to them 
and become their trading partners. 
Within the narrow limits of her archi- 
pelago, with its little islands linked by 
bridges, Venice soon grew rich through 
her self-conferred monopoly in salt. 
Later she spread a network of sea- 
routes throughout the Mediterranean, 
conducting an active import-export 
trade between the European States, 
Africa, and Asia Minor. 
Foe after she acquired 
prosperity through the glass and silk 
industries, her réle remained essentially 
that of an intermediary; she had agents 
in Bruges, Antwerp, Amsterdam, 
London, Bremen, Florence and Genoa; 
she received manufactured goods from 
France, Germany, the Low Countries 
and England, and carned them to all 
the Mediterranean ports, where her 
merchants had special concessions 
and even districts reserved for them, 
enjoying privileges of self-government 
and extraterritoriality. 
Steadily pursuing this policy, 
governed solely by considerations of 
free and fruitful trade, Venice interven- 
ed in the quarrels of the Italian States 
and their neighbours only so far as 
necessary to prevent the free circula- 
tion of goods and money from being 
impeded by wars, profitable only to 
arms-makers and the condottieri, or 
professional military captains, and pro- 
ducing catastrophic disturbances for 
importers and exporters. 
Her own overseas trading posts 
were miniature Venices, forming 
enclaves In other countries, and the 
Venetian Republic likewise placed at 
the disposal of Turkish, Greek, and 
German merchants trading near the 
Rialto, buildings, known as fondachi, 
from the Arab word fondouk, where 
they had their dwellings, offices, and 
warehouses, all free from local police 
jurisdiction. The Greeks and Dalma- 
tians similarly had their scuole, or guild 
halls in which to hold meetings, per- 
form their religious rites, and admin- 
ister the property of their trade- 
guilds, which remained entirely inde- 
pendent.

### 59312: Venice, link between Orient and Occident

The constant osmosis thus going on 
between the Venetian Republic and the 
European and oriental nations with 
which she traded made Venice the 
most cosmopolitan city in the world, 
where every language could be heard 
in banks and shops, and where any 
traveller could walk about in his 
national dress without surprising 
anyone. 
Art and culture also benefited from 
the fruitful contributions lavishly be- 
stowed by foreign civilizations: first 
Byzantium, which long dominated 
Venice both aesthetically and politi- 
cally, then Pisan and French sculpture, 
German, Dutch and Flemish painting, 
with that piquant touch of the exotic 
which was also to be found in Aegean 
art at the period when the Sea Peoples 
were settling in Egypt and the influ- 
ence of Crete was beginning to be 
felt on the mainland at Argos and 
Mycenae. 
The symbolic “wedding of the sea”, 
renewed year by year by the Doge on 
Ascension Day, significantly perpetu- 
ated this long-standing alliance, im- 
posed by geography, between the 
great merchant city and the element 
which favoured the movement of trade. 
Casting his gold ring into the sea 
from the gilded State barge, the 
Bucentaur, the Doge would say, In 
Latin, "Desponsamus te, Mare, In 
signum veri perpetuique dominii.” (We 
espouse thee, oh sea, in token of our 
real and everlasting dominion.) 
As with everything subject 
to the vicissitudes which affect the 
lives of States, this everlasting do- 
minion over the sea, celebrated by the 
yearly marriage, dwindled through the 
centuries into a mere fiction. Increas- 
ingly frequent European wars severed 
the trade relations between the Adriatic 
and the northern countries; in Italy 
itself, ports such as Genoa or Pisa 
contested and tried to wrest from the 
Venetian Republic her ancient hege- 
mony; pirates, fitting out whole fleets, 
attacked and pillaged the squadrons 
of Venetian merchantmen, in spite of 
their convoying warships. 
The growing power of Spain, France, 
and the Holy Roman Empire gradually 
eroded Venice's political prestige until 
she no longer held her former place 
of honour in the concert of great 
powers. The French invasions cost 
her the Romagna region, Apulia, and 
the control of the southern Adriatic, 
which passed to the Pope. She had 
no territorial ambitions in Italy and 
true to her trading interests, she inter- 
vened in European affairs only to keep

Marco Polo's epic journey lasting 24 years, which took 
him across the face of Asia and back again to Venice, 
and the account he wrote of the kingdoms and marvels of 
the East in “The Book of Ser Marco Polo” have won 
for this enterprising Venetian a place in history as one of 
the most illustrious travellers of all times. He left Venice 
in 1271 and arrived back in 1295 (above, an impression 
of Venice at that time), after making known in the heart 
of China the renown and splendours of his native city. 
Below right, an 18th century copy of an effigy of Marco Polo 
venerated in “The Temple of the 50 Geniuses” in Canton

land and sea. 
One by one her Mediterranean pos- 
sessions slipped from her grasp during 
the sixteenth and seventeenth cen- 
turies: the Morea region of Greece, 
Cyprus, Crete and her other key island 
possessions, Islam and Spain rerout- 
ed the trade in spices and other 
oriental merchandise which had 
brought wealth to Venice. 
IT. Portuguese were also 
dangerous competitors, and it was 
with the idea of resisting them that an 
ingenious Venetian suggested to the 
Senate that a canal might be cut 
through the Isthmus of Suez to link 
the Mediterranean directly with the 
Red Sea and India, thus securing the 
“route to the Indies” which in later 
times was to be one of the major aims 
of British policy. But, as a magistrate 
sadly acknowledged at a meeting of 
the Senate on July 5, 1610: “We have 
lost all our trade, and the sea routes 
of the western Mediterranean, and the 
routes of the Levant are now used 
only by a few companies, liable to 
financial loss, short of ships, and 
steadily growing weaker.” 
How was it that Venice, notwith- 
standing her political and commercial 
decline, preserved her role as a great 
international city, a focus of world 
intellectual activity? At the risk of 
appearing paradoxical, it must be 
admitted that what saved Venice was 
her carnival. The Venice carnival last- 
ed six months, from the first Sunday 
in October until Lent. Unbridled plea- 
“sure reigned, with disguises and masks 
providing cover for every kind of 
licence and extravagant behaviour. 
When Voltaire describes the meet- 
ing, in a tavern, of exiled kings come to 
Venice for the carnival, he gives a 
farcical but true example of the extra- 
ordinary attraction exercised on the 
With the start of the 14th century, the genius and character of the arts which 
had always been an inherent part of and profoundly influenced the life of 
Venice flowered anew. The traditional association of Venice with the arts is 
reflected in this detail of an 18th century painting by the great Canaletto 
(Giovanni Antonio Canale). It depicts the crowds of Venetians who each year 
flocked on Ascension Day to the Fair of St Roch, where artists displayed 
the works they wished to sell.

where pleasure was so easy to come 
by and so benevolently authorized by 
custom and law. 
Taking part in the Venice carnival 
had become almost a social obligation 
for distinguished society; as also for 
the less distinguished, and indeed 
doubtful, company of adventurers of 
every race and colour, who thronged 
to Venice and under cover of the 
mask, committed their misdeeds with 
impunity. 
There too were the charlatans, 
magicians, esoterics and cabalists who 
swarmed the capitals of all countries 
in the eighteenth century. Represen- 
tatives of every nationality, including 
turbaned Arabs and brightly robed 
Moors, jostled each other in the gam- 
ing rooms, or ridotti, which were decor- 
ated with the utmost refinements of 
splendour by the fashionable artists 
of the Republic.

entertainment found it at the theatre: 
every evening there were performances 
in seven theatres of opera, tragedy, 
comic opera, and the commedia 
dell'arte, plays without written lines 
in which the actors showed dazzling 
virtuosity in improvising new words 
every time from a simple one-page 
scenario posted in the wings. 
Music lovers listened to sublime 
concerts in the charitable institutions, 
nicknamed “nightingales’ cages,” where 
orphan girls were brought up, being 
taught to sing and play musical 
instruments by the foremost masters 
of the day. Out of doors one could 
listen, as Goethe loved to do, to gon- 
doliers singing Tasso's poetry, taking 
up the melody along the canals. 
Vous thus offered the 
traveller an unending festival: in the 
streets and squares there were fetes, 
acrobats, mountebanks, minstrels, 
trainers with their performing animals, 
charlatans offering their wares; on the 
canals, regattas were held, the first 
competitor to arrive winning a purse of 
gold and the last a young pig, and 
there were processions of boats 
decked out as mythological palaces. 
The aristocrats and their noble 
foreign guests gave exquisite con- 
certs for one another in the enchant- 
ing gardens of Murano, and balls in 
their palaces, so sumptuously decorat- 
ed that Gustavus Ili, king of Sweden, 
dazzled by their splendour, confessed 
that such luxury was beyond him. 
Eighteenth century Venice, whose 
arsenals no longer employed more 
than a few workers, and whose once 
flourishing silk and glass industries 
were almost dead, seemed, in this final 
blaze of her old opulence, to be cele- 
brating for the last time her glory and 
prosperity. 
Fortunately Venice remains Venice, 
that is to say a city unique for her 
grate, beauty, and strangeness, the 
silence of her canals, where the black 
prows of gondolas thread their way, 
the palaces resembling some fairy 
construction in the Arabian Nights, 
with the reflection of their dream-like 
facades quivering in the water. 
Around Venice still lies the garland 
of islands of the lagoon: San Lazzaro 
of the Armenians, where Byron lived 
in an eastern monk's cell; Torcello, 
now fever-ridden and deserted, its 
gardens overlooked by its campanile, 
which the Huns saw long ago rising 
like a mirage from the sea; Murano, 
where glass is heated and shaped in 
the furnaces; Chioggia, where the red 
and yellow sails of fishermen's barques 
  
   
With its festivities, 
concerts, theatrical 
performances, and 
particularly the 
famous “Commedia 
dell’arte” whose 
actors displayed an 
astounding 
virtuosity in 
improvising their 
lines, the Venice 
Carnival was an 
unending feast of 
pleasure and 
amusement, ot

from many 
countries. Beneath <

Venice became a peaceful retreat 
where lovers came seeking conceal- 
ment, blissfully happy, or luxuriating in 
despair. Venice used to be called a 
dead city to render it still more ro- 
mantic and alluring. In reality it is a 
bustling town, with countless ships 
berthing, coming and going; where the 
passers-by in the street have a quicker 
and lighter step than anywhere else; 
where there is tremendous intellec- 
tual activity; a town whose music fes- 
tivals attract the elite of music lovers

the best films from the five continents,

years, the boldest and most outstand-

the decorative arts. 
In this way Venice is perpetuating 
her international calling, a calling 
which goes back to the early Middle 
Ages and which has been carried on 
throughout the centuries in varying 
forms that have always maintained the 
same level of vitality and inspiration. 
How can this vocation be followed In 
the future? Venice should remain as 
she now is, receptive to all new intel- 
lectual trends; but she should also 
preserve the appearance and character 
of a town which is unique—the beauty 
of her scenery and architecture, and

### 59314: Philae; an appeal by the Director-General of UNESCO: November 6, 1968

PHILAE 
AN APPEAL BY THE 
DIRECTOR-GENERAL OF UNESCO 
NOVEMBER 6, 1968 
Fein years after the international 
appeal launched on March 8, 1960, by my 
distinguished predecessor, Mr. Vittorino Vero- 
nese, the Government of the United Arab 
Republic and Unesco, on September 22, 1968, 
solemnly inaugurated the reconstructed temples 
of Abu Simbel on their new site in the heart 
of the Nubian Desert. Removed block by block 
from the sandstone cliff out of which they had 
been carved, the temples had been raised more 
than 180 feet and reassembled exactly as they 
had stood in the past. 
The success of this unparalleled enterprise, 
which bears striking witness both to the extra- 
ordinary potentialities of modern technology 
and to the effectiveness of international co- 
operation, should not blind us to the fact that 
the Campaign to Save the Monuments of Nubia 
is not yet finished. 
Spectacular as the results already are, 
success will not be complete until the temples 
of Philae are also saved. It has been possible 
to defer this operation until now because, owing 
to their position between the old and new 
Aswan Dams the final immersion of these tem- 
ples has so far been delayed. But work must 
now go forward as quickly as possible. 
On the basis of a study carried out by a 
group of Egyptian consulting engineers and 
architects, the Government of the United Arab 
Republic has selected a project whereby the 
temples will be dismantled, removed and 
reconstructed on a nearby island. The work 
will take four years and should start in the 
spring of 1969. The operation will be partly 
financed by the United Arab Republic, but to 
guarantee its completion, Unesco must collect, 
before the end of 1972, at least six million 
dollars, representing about one-third of the 
contributions made by the international com- 
munity to save Abu Simbel. 
| cannot imagine that the member states of 
Unesco, which have given such abundant proof 
of their generosity, should fail, when so near 
the goal, to make the final effort necessary 
to save this wonderful group of monuments, 
justly called "The Pearl of Egypt”, from dis- 
appearing forever beneath the waters. Such 
a failure would be all the more incomprehensible 
to our own and future generations because the 
temples of Philae are probably the best known 
of all the Nubian monuments, and geographically 
more accessible than many others for the 
increasing number of visitors who will un- 
doubtedly be attracted to them. 
It is therefore with confidence, and in 
accordance with the unanimous wish expressed 
by the General Conference of Unesco, that | 
solemnly call upon governments, institutions and 
foundations, both public and private, and upon 
all men of good will to contribute, as the means 
of each allow, to the success of the final stage 
in a cultural undertaking whose high signi- 
ficance is obvious to the whole world. 
May the intellectual and moral solidarity of 
mankind, which it is Unesco’s mission to 
promote, be further strengthened on this 
occasion in the saving of this precious treasure, 
thus vindicating the worth of the human spirit 
and advancing the cause of peace.

### 59316: The Survival of Philae

  
THE SURVIVAL 
OF PHILAE 
by Louis A. Christophe 
1 
I. Death of Philae,” by the 
French author, Pierre Loti, created a 
sensation when it was published just 
sixty years ago. Yet the noble monu- 
ments on this island in the Nile have 
thus far escaped the death which Pierre 
Loti predicted for them, although the 
Aswan Dam downstream has "been 
raised on two occasions. 
Moreover, the leprosy of salt de- 
posits which was eroding the lower 
foundations of the structures has long 
since disappeared, washed away by 
the waters which submerged the monu- 
ments after 1934, during nine months 
 
LOUIS A. CHRISTOPHE, French Egyptologist, 
is head of Unesco's Section of Nubia Monu- 
ments, and from 1960 to 1967 was Special 
Representative of Unesco in Cairo for the 
International Campaign to Save the Monu- 
ments of Nubia. He has written many stud- 
ies on Egyptology and is the author of a 
fascinating book on the discovery of Abu 
Simbel by the Swiss explorer Johann Burck- 
hardt, entitled “Abou Simbel et I'Epopée de 
sa Découverte” (Editions PF. Merckx, Brus- 
sels, 1965). . 
. period when 
of the year (see the “Unesco Courier,” 
February 1960). And archaeologists, 
artists and travellers who, until 1964, 
braved the rigours of the Nubian sum- 
mer to land on Philae during the brief 
it emerged from the 
waters, were stirred by the same emo- 
tions felt by their predecessors of the 
19th century. . 
The harmonious ensemble of monu- 
ments whose massive forms of tradi- 
tional Pharaonic’ architecture blend 
with the elegance and grace of Grecian- 
style colonnades, the diversity of 
reliefs which transform the temples 
into a colossal “library” on the reli- 
gion of ancient Egypt—and particular- 
ly the cult of the goddess Isis—and 
the sandstone blocks whose colour 
‘ changes with every shift and play of 
the desert hight, all helped to make 
the visitor forget the losses that Philae 
had suffered in modern times. 
Few remembered that until the turn 
of the century the inner walls of. the 
sanctuaries were adorned with splen- 
did paintings, and that on the “Pearl 
  
  
of Egypt,” as Philae was known in 
ancient times, long palm fronds np- 
pled in the northern breeze, clumps 
of tamarisk trees were filled with the 
songs of birds, and swallows, beloved 
by Isis, returned unfailingly each year 
to their immemorial haunts. 
But the annual spectacle of Philae 
risen from the waters was seen by a 
privileged few for whom neither the 
overpowering heat of Aswan in August, 
nor the slippery mud in July, neither 
the deep and dangerous cracks in the 
earth in September nor the awe-inspir- 
ing solitude of the abandoned island 
were daunting obstacles. Far more 
numerous were the visitors who came 
in more clement months, when the 
approaches to the First Cataract of the 
Nile unexpectedly recall the vistas of 
some mythical paradise. 
To dream of Philae, the enchant- 
ress, and then to discover only the 
mutilated reliefs on its monumental 
pylons, or to search, often in vain, for

### IGNORE

THE SURVIVAL OF PHILAE (Continued) 
traces of the submerged colonnades 
in the calm but cloudy waters is enough 
to make one regret that the builders 
of the Aswan Dam, and those who 
twice increased its height, failed to 
give the archaeologists of the Egyptian 
Antiquities Service the opportunity to 
rescue the island and its monuments. 
A plan to save them had indeed been 
drawn up, but could not be undertaken 
through lack of national resources. 
Then, in 1960, a great hope was 
born. Specialists sent to Nubia by 
Unesco in the autumn of 1959 to study 
the problems of safeguarding its sites 
and monuments, supported by a vast 
wave of international sohdanty, in- 
corporated the preservation of Philae’s 
monuments into the overall plan for 
the Nubian campaign. And when the 
Director-General of Unesco made his 
solemn appeal on March 8, 1960, it 
was Philae he had in mind, second 
only to Abu Simbel, as a majestic en- 
semble to be saved by the Interna- 
tional Campaign he had just launched. 
Since the island of Philae 
is located between the old and new 
Aswan Dams, there was no need to 
put a rescue operation into effect for 
several years, which gave time to pre- 
pare the project (see the “Unesco 
Courier,” October 1961). A target date 
was set for 1968, by which time it was 
estimated that the High Dam would be 
nearing completion and its turbines, 
built to provide electricity for the in- 
dustrial development of the United 
Arab Republic, would be in service. 
These years of respite were use- 
fully devoted to the launching and 
completion of a major operation in 
Nubia—the removal to safety of the 
temples of Abu Simbel (see pages 52- 
53)—and to the study of projects for 
the preservation of Philae. 
In 1955, when plans were being 
drawn up for the construction of the 
High Dam, the Egyptian Antiquities 
Department published a study entitled 
“The Salvage of Philae.” Its author, 
Osman R. Rostem, proposed to isolate 
Philae from the rest of the Aswan Lake 
by a series of small dams or dikes. 
This idea, put forward at a time when 
the High Dam was still a theoretical 
project, seemed perfectly feasible to 
the Unesco specialists as an opera- 
tion that could be carried out in the 
more or less distant future, since the 
flooding of the High Dam would reduce 
the water level at Philae in comparison 
both with the former level of the Aswan 
Lake and the waters of the High Dam. 
Therefore a more elaborate study 
of the Rostem proposal, commissioned 
by the Government of the Netherlands, 
was carried out by NEDECO, a Nether- 
lands firm of consulting engineers. 
This proposed the construction of three 
dikes between the right bank of the 
Nile and the islands close to Philae, 
thus creating a new lake in whose 
centre the monuments of Philae would 
stand in their original setting and 
splendour. The level of this lake was 
to be controlled by a pumping station. 
But further studies showed that this 
would be too costly, and an alternative 
solution to carry away surplus water 
via a drainage tunnel was proposed. 
Though endorsed by the majority of 
archaeologists and landscape archi- 
tects, since it preserved the monu- 
ments of Philae on their original site, 
the Rostem-NEDECO project had cer- 
tain drawbacks. Some problems, such 
as water seepage, could be solved; 
other were likely to prove more diffi- 
cult. For example, might not the monu- 
ments in their hollow be isolated from 
the wild landscape of the First Catar- 
act of the Nile by the high rectilinear 
walls of the three dams? But the 
main obstacle that remained was the 
steadily rising cost of a project of 
this type. 
By 1965 the threat to Philae was 
greater than ever before. It had been 
decided that the hydro-electric power 
station near the old Aswan Dam would 
be used to supplement the turbines of 
the High Dam. Thus, the water in the 
lake between the two dams would 
have to be kept at a sufficiently high 
level and also raised and lowered by 
from plus to minus three metres daily. 
By now the foundations of the monu- 
ments were submerged throughout 
the year, while some ten metres above 
them the daily rise and fall of the 
waters first submerged the sandstone 
reliefs and then exposed them to the 
open air, thus weakening their resis- 
tance to corrosion by the atmosphere. 
I. rescue of the monu- 
ments on Philae was thus becoming 
more and more urgent and called for a 
rapid decision. From new studies by a 
group of consulting architects and en- 
gineers in Cairo came a second pro- 
ject, designed to take account of ar- 
chaeological requirements and finan- 
cial resources. 
The new project proposed dis- 
mantling the monuments of Philae, 
stone by stone, a method already used 
to save most of the other threatened 
monuments in Nubia, notably the 
temple of Kalabsha, and reconstructing 
them on the island of Agilkia, 300 
metres downstream from Philae. 
The operation would be carried out 
as follows. First, the level of the 
water around the temples would be 
lowered to ground level long enough 
to permit measurements and recordings 
to be made, so that the monuments 
could be reconstructed in their proper 
symbolic orientation, each in correct 
relation to the others and with every 
architectural feature replaced exactly 
as before. 
To lower the water level around 
the monuments for a long period would 
obviously be impossible for economic 
reasons. It would thus be necessary

### 59316: The Survival of Philae

THE FATE OF PHILAE 
IN THE 20TH CENTURY 
Before 1902 
Taken just before the turn 
of the century, this photograph shows 
the site of the temples of Philae 
high and dry above the First Cataract 
of the Nile. The building of the 
first Aswan Dam (1899-1902) created a 
lake which flooded the island for 
part of the year. The dam was later 
raised on two occasions, between 1907 
and 1912 (after which it was necessary 
to tour the monuments by boat), 
and again between 1929 and 1934, 
when it inundated the temples for 
nine months of the year. 
The monuments suffered the irreparable 
loss of their many-coloured frescos 
which had survived intact for 2,000 years 
down to the 158th century. 
 
Before 1965 
For thirty years (1934-1964), 
Philae and its temples were engulfed 
by the Nile from October to July. 
Only the tips of the first pylon 
of the Great Temple of Isis 
were visible above the waters (right). 
In July, after the opening of the sluices 
of the first Aswan Dam, 
the temples emerged in their entirety, 
a magnificent spectacle (far right) 
for those who braved the midsummer heat. 
During these three decades, 
the water dangerously attacked and 
weakened the sandstone, but the 
monuments survived because their 
foundations had been .consolidated 
in 1900 by the Egyptian 
Antiquities Service. 
Today 
The construction of the new 
Aswan High Dam, upstream .from Philae, 
will doom the “Pearl of Egypt” 
to certain death unless efforts 
are made to save it. 
The rise in the water level of the 
Aswan Lake since 1965 now floods 
the sanctuary of the goddess Isis 
to about half its height, and the 
foundations of Philae’'s monuments are 
gradually being eroded by daily 
fluctuations of up to six metres (19 ft.) 
in the water level. Right, Philae in 1968. 
It is now proposed to save Philae 
by dismantling its temples 
and re-erecting them on the island 
of Agilkia, beyond the reach of the Nile.

to build a coffer-dam around the prn- 
ciple monuments which could then be 
safely dismantled. Other monuments, 
of which only the lower foundations 
remain, could be recovered by simpler 
and less costly techniques. 
While the blocks of stone (estimat- 
ed at between, 15,000 and 20,000) were 
being moved to a storage area in the 
plain of Chellal on the right bank of 
the Nile, a new site for the monuments 
would be prepared on the island of 
Agilkia. 
Far higher than Philae, Agilkia has 
peak levels of 150 metres and thus 
rises well above the level of the Aswan 
lake. But to accommodate all the 
temples in an area equivalent to their 
former site, its pinkish granite surface 
would need to be levelled and parts 
of the island extended in width and 
length by the addition of terraces

The final phase would be the re- 
construction of the temples, kiosks and 
pylons on Agilkia, a task facilitated 
by experience gained during similar 
operations on several Nubian sites, 
such as Kalabsha, Kertassi, Dakka and

temple of Isis looking south; the kiosk 
of Trajan greeting visitors arriving from 
the east bank of the Nile; the kiosk 
of Nectanebo, those landing on the 
southern shore of the island; and the 
gate of Hadrian opening on the west. 
But through its portals the vestiges 
of the temple of Osins will no longer 
be visible. The temple will be left on 
the island of Biga, a prey to the rise 
and fall of the waters in the Aswan 
ake.

These bas-relief sculptures of Hathor, a goddess often identified with Isis, 
flank the monumental gateway to the temple of Isis on Philae. 
Sculpture on the left was defaced at the time when Christianity was introduced 
into Egypt and the temple of Isis was converted into a church. 
Republic finally chose the project to 
dismantle, transfer and reassemble the 
monuments of Philae, in preference 
to the Rostem-NEDECO project, for 
financial reasons. The cost of trans- 
ferrng the monuments 1s estimat- 
ed at 5,350,000 Egyptian pounds 
($12,305,000) as compared to an 
estimated cost of 6,450,000 Egyptian 
pounds ($14,825,000) for preserving 
them on their original site. Further- 
more, the proportion of hard currency 
needed for the transfer project is only 
40 per cent of the total as against 
60 per cent for the project to build 
dikes around the temples. 
Work is scheduled to start in ihe 
spring of 1969 and will take four years 
to complete Early in 1973, the monu- 
ments of Philae, unchanged in every 
respect, will have become the monu- 
ments of the “new” island of Agilkia. 
Philae, engulfed by the Nile, will have 
been irrevocably deprived of its crown 
of buildings, and a shroud of river silt 
will soon hide the wounds inflicted 
by the tools of modern technology. 
In compensation, the once desolate 
island of Agilkia will have been garbed 
in an array of sculptured stone and 
its barren surface covered by kiosks, 
colonnades, pylons and sanctuaries to 
which the swallows of Isis will return 
once more. 
Tamarisk trees and palms may flour- 
ish again and beneath their shade, 
throughout the year, visitors will try 
to visualize the splendours of the festi- 
val in Greco-Roman Egypt, when the

### 59311: Venice and the Venetians of tomorrow

ali 
VENICE AND THE VENETIANS 
OF TOMORROW (Continued from page 38) 
built to take the increasing traffic 
between Venice and the mainland. 
Others say, on the contrary, that all 
road and rail links ought to be cut, 
so that Venice may preserve its island 
character. 
Plans for a motorway which would 
run the whole length of the old city 
have already been turned down by the 
authorities. Instead, it has been 
proposed that an overhead railway 
be built on pylons almost 100 feet 
(about 30 metres) high, with some parts 
of the track disappearing discreetly 
underground. However, the pylons 
would still mar the beauty of the 
lagoon. 
For aesthetic reasons, consideration 
has been given to a possible system 
of underground communications: 
tunnels under certain canals, dup- 
licating bridges and ferry-crossings, 
and, the most ambitious project of all— 
an underground railway linking the city 
centre to the mainland, with a possible 
extension to Padua and Treviso. 
The Italian authorities have closely 
studied this project. It would, of 
course, take years to carry out, but 
it would help to save Venice by 
reducing the congestion of water 
traffic, particularly on the Grand Canal 
and the Rio Nuovo, and would, at the 
same time, do away with the water 
turbulence that threatens the city's 
buildings. 
An effort to restore to Venice the 
kind of vitality it enjoyed at other 
periods in its history, and which would 
satisfy the demands of the modern 
world, should not merely seek to 
preserve its population by providing 
up-to-date housing and commu- 
nications, or to develop its commerce 
and industry. Such a Venice would no 
longer be Venice. 
Development everywhere is as much 
a cultural as an economic and techno- 
logical problem. The cultural hfe of 
Venice will be significant and command 
respect only If it reflects a genuine 
physical, economic and social vitality. 
Cultural development must always 
set the pace. 
For centuries now, the University of 
Venice has been situated in Padua. 
However, a number of people actively 
concerned with cultural development 
want to make the old city of Venice 
an international centre of higher 
education. 
Such a project would involve the 
setting-up of a number of univer- 
sity institutions; faculties of social 
sciences, arts, the history of art, mari- 
time studies, institutes of town 
planning and architecture and an 
international university of traditional 
crafts. The Venice city council has 
. already adopted a scheme for sett- 
ing up an international Centre for 
Engineering Sciences, which would 
occupy the Palazzo Fortuny. 
2 
The idea would be to make Venice 
a modern version of ancient Athens, 
where students, research workers and 
thinkers from all countries would find 
a place for reflection, work and 
discussion. [It is with this in mind 
that 500 students from universities in 
Canada and the United States are 
being invited to study in Venice in 
1969. This movement ought to develop 
and spread, but if it is to do so, 
young people from all over the world 
must find in Venice young people to 
welcome them. 
The Venice Biennale illustrates the 
city's traditional concern with cultural 
enrichment. As early as 1895, the 
International Exhibition of Modern Art 
was revealing avant-garde talent, as 
well as organizing retrospective 
exhibitions of painting and sculp- 
ture. Since then the Biennale has 
expanded to include an impressive 
programme of events: international 
drama and film festivals, concerts and 
so on. There is obvious scope for the 
development of such programmes in 
the future. 
As for the tourist trade, who can 
deny that Venice needs it? And yet, 
Venetian students have angrily 
denounced tourism as an evil. There 
is undoubtedly a form of tourism which 
is scarcely more profitable to Venice 
than to the tourists themselves. 
Hordes of tourists invade Venice each 
summer and take away little more 
than photographs of pigeons. 
Cultural development plans would 
therefore aim to change the image 
of Venice, to enable the city to give 
of its best to all its visitors and not 
only to a few sophisticates or to the 
“jet set" members of international 
society who seek amusement at balls 
and in the casinos. 
The cultural development of Venice 
as a factor in the preservation of this 
irreplaceable city will fail unless full 
advantage Is taken of future promise 
as well as past glories. 
Nothing is as yet settled; everything 
is still possible—even that Mestre may 
one day become the regional capital, 
with Venice as a dying suburb. Then 
perhaps the very people who fought 
for this isolation, and who resisted 
change, will leave it in their turn. 
And the work of men who chose to 
consider man a danger will be handed 
over to the old enemies, salt and 
water, which will inexorably gnaw 
away at the city's already crumbling 
stones, 
This is what would happen if daring, 
ambition, eagerness to move onwards 
—in a word, youth—were to leave 
Venice and settle on the mainland, 
as if in a foreign country. It will not 
happen if Venice remembers what she 
has been for the last 1,000 years—an 
incomparable centre of culture, a city 
invigorated by its lust for life and 
confidence in the future.

From the Unesco Newsroom... 
President-translators 
A collection of poems by King Mahendra 
of Nepal was published recently in a 
Hebrew translation by Israel's President, 
Dr. Zalman Shazar. The first performance 
was given this year of a Swahili version 
of Shakespeare's “Julius Ceasar,” trans- 
lated in 1962 by President Nyerere of Tan- 
zania. And a translation into Urdu of 
Plato’s “Republic” by Dr. Zakir Husa, 
president of India, is one the latest works 
published by the Indian Academy of Letters 
with Unesco assistance. 
World snow and ice census 
Glaciologists are to make a global 
survey of the quantity of snow and ice on 
the surface of the earth as a contribution 
to the International Hydrological Decade 
(launched under Unesco’s auspices in 
1965). According to the International 
Commission on Snow and Ice, which is 
supervising the survey, of the 1,360 milhon 
cubic kilometres of water in all its forms 
on earth, only 35 million cubic kilometres 
consist of fresh water, 80% of this being 
in the form of ice or snow, 
to some U.S. educators. They maintain 
that the most effective teachers of children 
are often other children, and that many 
children who fall to learn from teachers 
{or whose teachers fail to teach), learn 
from each other. 
Nubian temple for Spain 
In recognition of the important work 
done by the Spanish Archaeological 
Mission in the International campaign to 
save the monuments of Nubia, the United 
Arab Republic has made a gift to Spain of 
the temple of Debod, bwlt in the 4th 
century B.C. and completed by Cleopatra 
and Emperor Augustus. Debod was a 
stopping place for pilgrims on their way 
to the temples of Philae, to worship the 
goddess Isis. The dismantled temple's 
1,700 stone blocks will shortly be shipped 
to Spain and reassembled. 
Meiji Village 
built near Nagoya 
Meiji Village, a trust foundation created 
to preserve buildings of the Meiji era is 
being built at Inuyama near Nagoya City. 
A number of representative historical build- 
ings have been dismantled, moved and 
reconstructed on the tree-covered hills near 
Iruka, on an 80 acre (33 ha) site 
Audible traffic lights 
An acoustic signalling device designed 
in Sweden helps the blind to distinguish 
between “stop” and “cross” at pedestrian 
crossings. When the light is red, the 
device ticks at a frequency of 75 pulses a 
minute which rises to 750 pulses when the 
light turns green. The device is audible 
nine metres away. 
Teachers in knee pants 
Child-to-child tutoring in some American 
schools is helping ease the serious short- 
age of teachers. The technique is new but 
the theory is old and very sound, according 
Computers in the hospital 
Staffs of several London hospitals will 
soon be relieved of some of their routine 
work by two new computer systems. At 
King's College Hospital, a computer will 
process admissions, nurse and bed allo- 
cation, drug and diet control and the analy- 
sis of laboratory and other tests. The 
other computer will aid London's teaching 
hospitals and two major hospital regions 
by tackling one of the most varied and 
complex payroll structures ever dealt with 
by computer. 
‘Flying squad’ control 
of traffic noise 
Mobile police control of traffic noise 
will begin on a trial basis in Sweden next 
year. Noise meters compact enough to be 
carried in police cars will first be used In 
the big cities and later in all parts of the 
country. So far no decibel standards for 
acceptable engine noise have been 
established in Sweden, but a special 
committee investigating traffic noise prob- 
lems is expected to recommend per- 
missible decibel figures. 
Pakistan's targets 
in education 
By 1970, more than 13 million Pakistani 
children will attend primary school, com- 
pared to just over five million in 1960. 
The target for secondary enrolment in 1970 
is 2,800,000; in 1960, there were only 
140,000 children in Pakistan's secondary 
schools. 
All about libraries 
Unesco's programmes and current inter- 
national developments in library, documen- 
tation and archives services are regularly 
reported in the Unesco Bulletin for Libra- 
ries, now in its 22nd year. Topics for 
1968 include : international standards for 
hospital libraries, libraries and International 
Year for Human Rights, abstracting prob- 
lems in developing countries, training 
qualified staff, particularly in developing 
countries, and audio-visual materials in 
libraries. ‘Subscribe through Unesco na- 
tional distributors (see page 59). Annual 
rates (six issues): $4, 24/-, 14 F, or equiv- 
alent in local currency. 
Venezuela's farm schools 
pay their way 
Farm schools In Venezuela are self- 
supporting, being financed through the sale 
of farm produce raised on their land by 
students. On leaving school, students 
receive a loan of $1,200 which enables 
them to farm plots with the help and 
supervision of school staff members. 
Flashes... 
WM Unesco now has 125 member states, 
following the recent entry of Barbados and 
Mauritius. 
MW Although the world will need 70 million 
primary teachers by the year 2000, present 
traiming facilities could produce only 20 mil- 
lion qualified teachers by that time, accord- 
ing to recent Unesco estimates. 
MW World Bank loans of $17.2 million for 
road improvements and $183 million for 
railway modernization are expected to sti- 
mulate agriculture and industry in Colombia. 
BM Recent estimates indicate that the Indian 
Ocean is “under-fished,” and that annual 
catches could be increased from 2 million 
to 20 million tons without damaging stocks. 
BM Mexico has become the first nation to 
place its entire nuclear programme under 
the supervision of the International Atomic 
Energy Agency to ensure that the work is 
entirely for peaceful purposes. 
  
The golden rule 
International Year for Human Rights 
1968 marks the 20th anniversary of 
the adoption and proclamation of the 
Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights by the U.N. General Assembly 
on December 10, 1948. The Decla- 
ration embodies ideals which have 
been the inspiration of the faiths, 
philosophies and laws of many 
nations. Its expression of the 
common brotherhood of man has 
been proclaimed in the sacred 
writing of many faiths. The following 
are a few such examples. 
Christianity: All things whatsoever 
ye would that men should do to you, 
do ye even so to them: for this is 
the Law and the Prophets. Matthew 
7:12. 
Judaism: What is hateful to you, 
do not to your fellowmen. That is 
the entire Law; all the rest is com- 
‘mentary. Talmug, Shabbat, 31a. - 
Brahmanism: This is the sum of 
duty: Do naught unto others which 
would cause you pain if done to you. 
Mahabharata, 5, 1517. 
Buddhism: Hurt not others in ways 
that you yourself would find hurtful. 
Udana-Varga, 5, 18. 
Confucianism: Surely it is the 
maxim of loving-kindness: Do not 
unto others that you would not have 
them do unto you. Analects, 15, 23. 
Islam: No one of you is a believer 
until he desires for his brother that 
which he desires for himself. Sunnah. 
Taoism: Regard your neighbour's 
gain as your own gain, and your 
neighbour's loss as your own loss. 
Tai Shang Kan Ying P’ien. 
Zoroastrianism: That nature alone 
is good which refrains from doing 
unto another whatsoever is not good 
for itself. Dadistan-i-dinik, 94.5.     al

Letters to the Editor 
PERILS OF DRUGS, DRINK... 
 
Sir, 
Congratulations on your special 
issue dealing with the abuse of drugs 
(May, 1968). | attend meetings of a 
group of former alcoholics, and among 
them | have observed many of the 
characteristic traits you describe in 
your articles on drug addiction. | 
would like to see an issue of the 
“Unesco Courier” devoted to the 
problem of alcoholism. 
Robert Dauteuil 
Wissous, France 
..AND TOBACCO 
  
Sir. 
In your interesting issue, “Abuse of 
Drugs”, why was there no mention 
of a drug that has done more harm 
to human beings in the past five 
centuries than all the hallucinogenic 
drugs taken throughout history. In 
France it claims as many victims as 
road accidents; in Great Britain, 
three times as many; and in the 
United States five times as many. 
How was it that the beautiful Nico- 
tiana Tabacum was not included 
among the drug producing plants 
whose pictures you published? 
Few of us are personally acquainted 
with addicts of opium or the hallucino- 
genic drugs, but we all know heavy 
smokers whose vice causes them to 
waste money and shorten their lives 
by falling victim to the ills produced 
by smoking : heart attacks, peptic 
ulcers, bronchitts, emphysema and 
lung and throat cancers. 
Narcotics are not yet sold on every 
street corner, but cigarettes are; while 
costly publicity campaigns urge us 
to smoke more and more... 
A. Sonnier 
Nice, France 
THE RIGHT TO 
SELF-DETERMINATION 
  
Sir, 
The fact that certain people, of 
whom one Is Jean Jordan (Letters to 
the Editor, July-August 1968), are even 
aware of the existence of publications 
like the “Unesco Courier” is a 
constant source of wonder to me. 
Rather one would have thought its 
readers would be from the forward- 
thinking, humanistic sector of the 
community. Surely the important 
Issue at stake is what 1s happening 
now and why is it happening now? 
The positive or negative aspects of 
white colonialism in Africa or elge- 
where have been but an obstacle to 
each country's right and desire for 
self-determination In its own fashion. 
Any advance of the human rights of 
ether individuals or nations can only 
be commended; this is a world of 
developing countries, on the equal 
footing which provides the truest 
basis for international understanding. 
John Pulsford 
University of Melbourne 
Australia 
UNESCO AND YOUTH 
 
Sir, 
The idea to make Unesco an 
organization for youth, expressed by 
its Director-General, Mr. René Maheu 
(*Unesco Courier”, July-August 1968), 
has come at the right moment. 
| spent part of this past summer 
in an international work camp compos- 
ed of young people fram twelve 
nations, including Japan, Ghana, and 
Czechoslovakia. We became fast 
friends, working together, sweating in 
the sun, joking, teaching each other 
songs and phrases nour own 
languages. 
However, this solidanty, which 
might be the basis of valuable co- 
operation in the future, is being 
undermined in many international 
meetings or is ignored by those who 
officially represent their country 
abroad. 
Conny Arkenbout 
Haarlem, the Netherlands 
Sr, 
Why not devote an issue to the 
worldwide revolt among students and 
workers? Even as an attempt to 
resolve the conflict between the 
generations this would be a worth- 
while enterprise. Show youth that the 
ideal Unesco stands for 1s the ideal 
of young people in all countries. Help 
to restore the confidence of parents 
in the younger generation, since the 
older generation Is alarmed by youth's 
attitude towards the civilization it will 
one day inhent. Perhaps then Unesco 
can hope to become the organization 
of youth. 
Jean Paul Le Roux 
Sené, France 
FIRST THINGS FIRST 
 
Sir, 
| am sorry but | don't agree to 
Unesco's aid to archaeological re- 
storation (in search, amongst other 
things, of “tourist development”), out- 
lined in your June 1968 issue. Man 
has no need to clutch at the past. 
This money should go first and 
foremost to alleviate problems of 
hunger etc. 
Richard Fairclough 
Paris, France 
THE WORLD YOUTH 
HOPES FOR 
 
Sir 
| imagine {| am not alone In my 
appreciation of the scope, idealism 
and competence of the prize-winning 
essay from Uruguay on "The World 
We Hope For” written by Maria 
Cristina Costa Diaz (“Unesco Cou- 
rier”, February 1968). Now we should 
like to see a symposium of extracts 
from essays by similarly thoughtful 
young people, offering suggestions as 
to how they think these ideals might 
eventually be achieved. We older 
folk have wanted this kind of world 
for decades, but we have not been 
able to be sufficiently creative and 
adventurous in finding ways to put the 
ideals into practice. We must be 
ready to help and encourage the 
younger folk who have perhaps more 
vision, 
M. E. B. lohnson 
London, U.K. 
SLAUGHTER OF BABY SEALS 
 
Sir, 
| would urge you to use your 
influence in Canada and in other 
countries where young seals are being 
massacred, to help put an end to 
this revolting and shameful carnage. 
The suffering of helpless animals ts 
perhaps even more horrible than that 
of human beings, who at least can 
defend themselves. An article in the 
“Unesco Courier” would help to alert 
people in all countnes to this tragic 
problem. 
Sella Achedjian 
Brussels, Belgium 
‘THE WAR GAME’ 
 
Sir, 
The Unitarian Extension Movement 
in Australia is gravely concerned at 
the action of the British Broadcasting 
Corporation in suppressing the tele- 
casting of “The War Game.” a film 
produced for the BBC and designed 
to show the full impact of nuclear 
warfare. 
The BBC action in allowing the film 
to be shown only in cinemas and under 
certain conditions has meant that the 
bulk of the world population is ef- 
fectively stopped from seeing it. This 
situation is compounded by the fact 
that the BBC will not allow the film 
to be telecast anywhere in the world. 
There is no doubt whatever that 
the frequent telecasting of this film 
would make millions of people through- 
out the world acutely conscious of 
the dangers of nuclear war and 
would therefore harden public attitudes 
against any policies which may result 
in a nuclear war breaking out. 
The virtual suppression of this film 
by the BBC may well have inhibited 
something which could have profoundly 
affected future attitudes to and an 
awareness of this important question. 
This would be a major tragedy.
