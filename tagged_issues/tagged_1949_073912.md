The growth oj the children of
Europe has been disfigured by a
greater or lesser degree of shock
- physical, emotional, mental.
There are, millions oj children
under 17, and what they need is
security, self-expression, educa-
tion and the sense of belonging
to the social world.
The figures oj Europe's basic
scholastic n. eeds run from the
simple to the complex : mil. lions
of pieces of chalk, thousands of
blackboards and thousands of
pieces of vocational equipment.
How many cannot read ? How
many millions have been re-
tarded ?

Their teachers fled, were sent
to concentration camps, or are

have survived with their parents
are far and dangerously behind.
And those just beginning to go to
school lack teachers and equip-

At centres in Switzerland and

They are given special iraining

Gradually, against the ruins,
there is a reaching out. For the

PROBLEMS
OF UNESCO
''DOES the world needUnesco ?"In one
form or another the
question has been posed since 1919,
although the League of Nations
cannot be said to have succeeded
very well in fortifying faith on
this point, for the Committee of
Intellectual Cooperation never
succeeded in making a sufficiently
vigorous impact even on the
scholar's limited world to com-
mand great confidence in the
value of its contribution to peace.
That committee, with the Insti-
tute of Intellectual Cooperation
created and largely endowed for
it by the Government of France,
was, however, by no means the
sole nor even the most vigorous of
the many international organiza-
tions striving to develop an
interest and enthusiasm for the
life of the mind on a world-wide
scale.
The International Bureau of
Education survives as one expres-
sion of forces which in almost
The Need For Professional
Training of Journalists
m OSEPH PULITZER, Hungar-ian-born editor of The New
York World, once said that
"the only career for which a man
needs no special training is that
of an idiot."
When Pulitzer died nearly forty
years ago he left a million dollars
to endow a training school for
journalists, which now has oeen
in existence since 1912 as a part
of Columbia University, in New
York.
It was not the first such school
in the United States, or even
in the world, but it now is one
of many-and the number is
steadily increasing. The last war
emphasized the need for such
schools and we find that training
programmes have been introduce
or revived or are being planned in
many countries since 1945.
Today, some form of journa-
listic training, from a simple
programme to an elaborate one,
is being offered in many univer-
sities and colleges of the Umted
States, Canada, Mexico, China,
India, Great Britain, France,
Poland, Italy and other countries.
MANY journalists of experiencehave regarded actual work for
a newspaper as the only training
necessary. This is the time-
honoured, empirical method, and
it has produced some great jar-
nalists.
Experience in the United States,
over a period of more than 40
years has demonstrated, however,
that preliminary university train-
ing in journalism has both direct
and indirect benefits. And the
leading organizations of editors
and publishers are now support-
ing and endorsing the professional
training progammes.
The same tendency is manifest-
ing itself in certain other coun-
tries.
The problems the journalist
must cope with today are so much
more complex than ever before,
and his responsabilities so much
greater, that logic seems to many
persons to demand an improved
preparation for the journalist
himself.
Two Unesco Commissions on
Technical Needs have made strong
recommendations for professional
training to help prepare the
prospective journalist. Such train-
ing the commission members felt,

should be given as part of the
work of a university or college
so that students might combine
specialized journalism courses
with general educational subjects.
A journalist needs a thorough

tion, The New York Times, The

nomics, government, sociology,
international relations, and m the
Jiberal arts and humanities. In
journalism courses he receives
training in the techniques of news
reporting and writing and editing,
in the historical background of
the profession that is to become
his own, in the social importance
of the press and its responsibili-
ties, and perhaps in certain more
specialized aspects af the work.
THe Unesco Commission onTechnical Needs asserted that
"every effort should be made by
Unesco to extend public awareness
of the need for accurate and
comprehensive dissemination of
public information". It urged that
"training programmes for pros-
pective journalists should be
encouraged by any means within
the power of Unesco". including
"practical assistance to schools
by the provision of expert advice
and guidance, by the arrangement
of facilities for the... orgamzers
of courses in journalism to meet
and pool their knowledge and
by the encouragement of exchan-
ges of lecturers."
As an aid to this purpose, the
Commission pwposed the forma-
tion of and International Institute
of Press and Information, one of
whose functions would be to help
national schools of journalism in
problems of organization and
exchange of information.
This proposal has had support
from the 1947 and 1948 General
Conference of Unesco, from the
U. N. Conference on Freedom of
Information at Geneva, in the
spring of 1948, and from various
individual journalists and groups
of journalists in several countries.
As a more immediate aid to
the newer schools and to those
countries. where plans are being
made to introduce professional
training, Unesco is preparing a
brochure in which the entire
subject will be explored and
suggestions for training program-
mes advanced.
The importance of accurate and
well-presented fact and opinion is
so tremcndous that any action in
support of better performance in
all the media of mass communi-
cation has the support of thought-
ful persons in every land. The
young, prospective journalist there-
fore may anticipate better op-
portunities for training, and better
opportunities to contribute to the
improvement of his community
and of his world in the years
ahead.
every discipline drove men of
many countries to come together,
cooperating to advance their spe-
cial studies and interests not
merely in their own country but
throughout the world. In natural
sciences and technology, in hist-
ory, in philosophy, in archaeology,
in the world of museums and of
libraries this same expansive
unifying interest was manifest.
What more natural, therefore,
than to demand an International
of Internationals in the realm of
education, science and culture
which should harness this energy
and direct it in the service of
peace and international under-
standing ? For otherwise how
would thc seething mass of inter-
national organizations struggling
for survival have achieved any
coherent pattern ? Inevitably their
needs and aspirations would meet
with a poor response, because
they would neither be heard nor
understood by the lay and secular
powers of Governments and their
treasuries, without whose aid in
the past they plainly have achieved
very little. In the Director-General
of Unesco they now have a tri-
bune vho must listen, who will
understand, who will be able to
report their cause aright to the
magistrates and chief officers of
States.
In this way money may,
indirectly, be obtained from
national budgets which national
parliaments could not be asked to
vote directly. In 1949, for example,
the United Kingdom will have to
find just over a quarter of a
million pounds for Unesco. It
seems a large sum ; but more was
spent on publicity for the Road
Safety Campaign in 1948 and as
much is needed by one of our local
authorities to build and equip a
single modern English school.
Further questions, however,
arise. It has been asked,"What
has Unesco done ?" and, more
rarely."What sort of activity
should Unesco undertake ?" The
achievements of Unesco, as some
of its critics appear to anticipate
with eager relish, are not yet very
impressive. This does not mean
that they are non-existent, for
Dr. Julian Huxley in his last
annual report as Director-General
recites a long list of activities ; but
their value cannot seem substan-
tial in the current context of
international antagonisms. And
what is worse in many eyes is
Unesco's failure to arrest the
attention of the man in the street.
To discredit Unesco on either of
these two grounds would surely be
premature. We are only at the
threshold of knowledge about the
treatment of tensions affecting
international understanding. No-
thing, moreover, would be more
disastrous than for Unesco to
neglect to build its own founda-
tions while it tried instead to
make an easy and impressive
Unesco Official Decries
Press'Scandal'Reports
DOCTOR WALTER H. C.LAVES, Deputy Director-
General of Unesco, in a spe-
cial statement to the press this
month, described as"irres-
ponsible"and"shocking",
recent newspaper articles
which have appeared in cer-
tain countries, based on an
auditor's report of Unesco
accounts in 1946.
The articles, published in
British, United States, Austra-
lian, South African, Dutch,
Norwegian and Swedish news-
p ap e r s, were headlined
"Unesco Accounts Scandal".
They were based on the
audit carried out by Price,
Waterhouse and Company,
covering the accounts of the
Unesco Preparatory Commis-
sion to the end of 1946.
Pointing out that Unesco
itself had requested that the
auditing report be made two
years ago, Dr. Laves said :
"I am shocked by the com-
plete irresponsibility of those
who presented a story like this
at the present time as if had
happened today, and the equal
irresponsibility of those who
published it in this form".
"The press stories", Dr. La-
ves added,"imply that the
situation still prevails. The
fact is three auditors reports
by Price, Waterhouse and
Company, since then, have
given Unesco a completely
clean bill of health".
"I make a direct appeal to
the press of the world", Dr.
Laves concluded,"to under-
stand the seriousness of the
problems before ns in build-
ing the peace through the
United Nations, and to make
the utmost effort to check
sources, be sure of the facts
and to report them accurateiy".
display. In this, Unesco is no
different from the other spe-
cialized agencies of the United
Nations, all of which have to map
out their future activities while
they deal at the same time with
new problems of organization and
of planning.
Does the public expect more of
Unesco ? It is to be hoped so, if
only bcause an attitude of critical
expectancy must prove an encour-
aging stimulant. For it will be
upon the promise of performance
in the many years ahead rather
than upon activities during the
three which lie behind that a just
appreciation of Unesco is to be
formed.
Those who look askance at any
form of novelty are always sure
of a public and never more so
than when the novelty may be
made to appear expensive as well
as exotic. The popular Press has
on the whole shown restraint in
exploiting Unesco in this way.
Some attacks there of course have
been, often on the ground of
treating amne ignotum pro risible.
Small wonder if the promotion of
a concentrated attack on the
whole range of scientific problems
impeding the development of the
vast resources latent in wet trop-
ical forests wins scant sympathy
when it is presented to the world
as a proposal to establish"A
Hylean Amazon Institute". And it
remains to be seen whether
derision from those enjoying an
ample rainfall will greet Unesco's
new inquiry, approved in Beirut,
into the desirability of assisting
the foundation of a new inter-
national institute to be dedicated
to the human and scientific
problems of the world's arid zones.
Serious criticism of Unesco's
programme, of which there is far
too little, is rarely accompanied,
however, by positive suggestions
of alternative plans which would
better serve its purposes. The
essential questions are rarely
asked ; yet the existence of the
programme is an open challenge
to artists, teachers, philosophers,
scientists, writers and thinkers
everywhere.
If the present programme is
poor and inadequate, how should
it be revised ? For it is clear that
the achievement of a deeper sense
of intellectual and moral solidarity
between the nations of the earth
is a new and exacting task ; that
the difficulties latent in it are by
no means sufficiently realized and
that the need for constructive
inventions in methods and machi-
nery has hardly yet been sensed
by the leaders, not to mention the
rank and file, of any continent.
It is unfortunately all too rare to
encounter evidence of serious
devotion to these Questions. Yet
they are far too important and
too difficult to be left either Ie
the few score men and women,
their clerks and typists of the
secretariat in Paris or to the
delegations sent to the organiza-
tion's general conferences, parti-
cularly after the recent decision
in Beirut that the general confer-
ence will consider the programme
at intervals of two years instead of
annually.
Unesco must be regarded as aD
experimental laboratory in the
great task of achieving human
understanding. Its labours may
serve as the prolegomena to all
other schemes of international
understanding. Its programme
enables it to invite philosophers
and social scientists and intellect-
ual workers everywhere to coope-
rate and to examine together the
presuppositions and the methods
of action directed towards the
union of men and minds. For
those who assume that this task
can be achieved merely by the
more assiduous employment er
traditional methods are but sleepy
sentinels at Minerva's gate. There
are fundamental problems such
as that restated last year by the
Lambeth Encyclical, whether in-
creased knowledge of the human
environment and a greater con-
trol of its resources will gradually
but certainly ensure the perfection
of the characters of men and r
society. Clearly it must be among
the first tasks of Unesco to avoid
uncritical acceptance of a facile
Rousseauism and to rethink its
philosophical foundations.

UNESCO SETS UP PRIORITY
SYSTEM FOR 1949 WORK
A N order of priorities for Unesco's 1949 programme has been
A"-eiitablished by Dr. Torres Bodet. Director-General, and approved
by the Organization's Executive Board which met in Paris this month.
The priority system has been applied to each of Unesco's projects
in accordance with criteria proposed by Dr. Torres Bodet. The crucial
test applied to any project
is three-fold :
1) will it improve the standard of
living of the ordinary people ?
2) does it help the intellectual
and professional leaders to serve
the people ?
3) will it show tangible results
fairly quickly ?
"These", Dr. Torres Bodet
explained to the Executive Board
meeting."are the considerations
which have led me to mark out,
in the permanent programme
adopted at Beirut, certain acti-
vities on which 1 suggest that
we should concentrate our main
energies in the coming months :'
"I have a deep-rooted convic-
tion". he added,"that Unesco
must be a driving force, courage-
ously dedicated to the service
of peace and progress, or else
no one would care whether it
exists or not."
"However much sympathy and
loyalty may be felt for the ideals
it embodies", he went on,"we
cannot ignore the fact that
Unesco as an organization has
not yet compelled sufficient re-
cognition to be certain of its
future. Many, not only among the
general public, but also in
intellectual and professional
circles, feel that it has to prove
itself-to prove... not the nobility
of its aims but the efficacy of
its method."----
Spiritual needs
or moment
The concentration of Unesco's
energies on certain priority acti-
vities would naturally entail a
reduction in the resources devot-
ed to the execution of other
projects."However", he continu-
ed."I should like to make it
clear that these resources will
be maintained at a level adequate
to ensure both the continuance
of those basic activities that are
essential for the efficient work-
ing of the Departments and the
steady preparation of projects
which are likely in due course
to become of paramount impor-
tance."
"The list of priority activities".
he went on,"must not therefore
be regarded as exclusive or as an
attempt to make an arbitrary
reduction in the progremme voted
by the General Conference. The
priorities 1 propose to you leave
this programme untouched, with
its full scope and diversity. Their
sole object is to bring out the
relative importance or urgency
of the different projects-so that
our energies may be directed tothe fulfilment of the tasks most
suited to the spiritual needs of
the moment."

AT FRENCH NATIONAL COMMISSION
Schuman, Bidault
Welcome Torres Bodet
..., ROBERT ECHUMAN, French Foreign Minister, M. Georges
't8 Bidault, head of the French delegation to Unesco's Beirut
Conference, and M. Yvon Delbos, Minister of Education,
were among the distinguished personalities present at the first 1949
meeting of the French National Commission for'Unesco, which
officially welçomed Dr. Torres
Bodet on January 22.
Meeting in the historic Salon
de I'Horloge. at the Foreign
Ministry in Paris, Commission
members heard the French
delegates outline the results
achieved at the Unesco General
Conference in Beirut last De-
cember.
Re-affirming that the French
Government and the French
people were prepared to give
Unesco full support during the
present year, M. Schuman said :
"France will never belittle the
importance of the task assigned
to Unesco. It is an organization
responsible for the future peace
of the world for which it is now
laying the spiritual foundations."
In his address before the
French National Commission, Dr.
Torres Bodet drew an analogy
between present day civilization
and the famous painting of Ge-
ricault,"The Raft of the Me-
dusa."In this painting, two
figures stand out : one a youth
signalling frantically into empti-
ness, towards a point on the
horizon from which help may
come. The other, a man seated
with his back to the possible
rescue ship, is lost in meditation
as he supports the dead body of
a young man.
"I call this scene to your
I minds,"Unesco's Director-Gen-, eral said,"because it seems to
me that our civilization resembles
the Raft of the Medusa. Raging
seas surround it and storm
clouds loom above. In each of
us there is a man who thinks
and another who hopes, a man
who signals to the future and
another who seeks in the wake
the reasons for what has oc-
curred.'
Since the last two. wars and
especially since the mere recent
one, Dr. Torres Bodet declared,
the world had witnessed a com-
plete distortion of values, a
dangerous spiritual confusion.
Torn Up Treaties
"Force usurped the place of
law, and cruelty the place of
courage,"he said."Servility
became tragically confused with
discipline, and anarchy with
freedom. The scientist was re-
warded not for the lives which
his discoveries saved, but for the
cities which they destroyed.
Statesmen were praised not for
the agreements they honoured
but for the treaties they tore
up. Writers were honoured not
for the virtues they inspired but
for their efforts to still our
latent curiosity."
(Continued on page 11.)
important document of modern
times" ?
Working hand in hand with the
U. N., Unesco will tackle this job
of making the Declaration better
known all around the globe.
Special programmes designed to
arouse the interest of all groups
- highbrow and lowbrow, young
and old.-are tor be organized
through the use of radio, films,
booklets and other methods.
For example, Unesco's Projects
Division is already at work on
a series of 1 ! ! broadcasts-being
prepared by world celebrities-
which will present dramatic
events in the progressive estab-
lishment of Human Rights.
Zola and"Aaero pagitica"
One series will tell of famous
court trials, of Socrates, Galileo,
Zola. Another will centre around
the world's great Human Rights
books, such as Milton's Aereopa-
gitica and Harriet Beecher Stowe's
Uncle Tom's Cabin. The new
weekly radio programme,"Unesco
World Review", will feature
special talks on those Rights
interesting to the public at the
time.
There may be scoffers and
sceptics, but there always are.
Unesco will try to show that the
enforcement of'Human Rights
has always been won by pressure
of public opinion-the abolition
of slavery is one example-and
that it is therefore up to the
public, by actively supporting the
Universal Declaration, to obtain
the full application of the prin-
ciples proclaimed both in its
Preambule and in its 30 Rights,
where such application is still
imperfect.
Ways by which teachers can
interest school children in the
Universal Declaration will be told
in a Teachers'Handbook which
Unesco is undertaking. The
Handbook will also give a graphic,
historical account of the rocky
road that ultimately led to the
successful application of each
Right by different countries.
H. R. Teachers'Handbook
For the general public, Unesco
will evamine the Right of
on the most essential of the
Rights describing the sacrifices
nations have made before reach-
ing the present-day notion IIf
Human Rights.
For the cultured, although not
specialized public, Unesco's Phi-
losophy and Humanistic Studies
Division will begin preparation
of a series of 6 booklets. One
will examine the Rigth of
freedom of scientific research,
another the Right to informa-
tion ; and a third the Right to
participate in the cultural life of
the community and to share in
scientific progress.
Unesco will of course make special
efforts to ensure full publicity
by press, radio and cinema, of
the anniversary of the Universal
Declaration next December 10.

Adviser
Dr. Julian Huxley, whose
term of office as director-gen-
eral of Unesco ended last De-

vitation of the British Minister
of Education to become a
member of the United King-

France, EcMador
Become
First Hations
To Adopt
'Human Rights Day'
ECUADOR and France havebecome the first two coun-
tries to announce plans for
mobilizing their educational
resources in order to make
the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights a reality in the
conscience of every schoolchild.
The announcements were
made in response to an ap-
peal issued on December 31,
1948, by Dr. Torres Bodet,
Director-General of Unesco to
its Member States, calling on
all nations to adopt December
10th as"Human Rights Day"
and to aid Unesco and the
United Nations in their com-
bined efforts to publicize the
Declaration of Human Rights,
unanimously adopted by the
U. N. General Assembly last
year.
The first reply to Dr. Torres
Bodet's appeal came from the
Republic of Ecuador on Janu-
ary 25 in a note delivered on
behalf of his government by
Señor Jorge Carrera Andrade,
Ecuadorian Minister in London.
The Ecuadorian reply, sign-
ed by Foreign Minister Nestali
Ponce, enthusiastically sup-
ports Dr. Torres Bodet's sug-
gestion to dedicate December
10th as"Human Rights Day".
"Ecuador", the Ecuador For-
eign Minister writes,"not only
fervidly welcomes"this idea,
but"is taking immediate steps
to prepare the commemoration
of Human Rights Day in all
educational institutions of the
Republic.
In addition, Dr. Torres Bodet
was officially informed by the
South American Republic that
the Ecuadorian Ministry of
Education is formulating plans
for a broad series of publica-
tions, lectures and essay con-
tests on the theme of the Uni-
versal Declaration of Human
Rights.
The purpose of these plans,
as set forth in M. Ponce's
reply, is to ensure widespread
knowledge of the text of the
Declaration, along with"a
study of its antecedents, and of
its relation to principles estab-
lished in the constitutions of
democratic countries". Ecua-
dorian schoolchildren. said M.
Ponce, will also be taught
"what the Declaration foresha-
dows for the future of peoples"
and the"intimate connection
between the Rights of Man and
the principles of Unesco".
French Rally to Appeal
ON February 3, Dr. JaimeTorres Bodet announced
that the French Government
had also rallied to his appeal.
The French reply came in
the form of an official notifi-
cation from this country's Na-
tional Commission for Unesco
which announced that the
Declaration had already been
distributed in all French lychees,
colleges, and teacher training
schools. Primary schools will
also receive the text shortly.
All civics teachers in France
will devote special lessons to an
explanation of the Declaration
of Human Rights, as one of
the great steps made by man
on the road to freedom.
In addition, the French Na-
tional Commisison announced
that a series of twelve radio
programmes of the Interna-
tional University of the Air
will be devoted to the Decla-
ration on the National Net-
work of the French radio
system.

### 73921: A Manifesto of the International Music Fund

### 73922: Musicologists create World Council

UNESCO COURIER February 1949
A MANIFESTO
'&..../E publish below the partial text of th. e
we Manifesto recently issued by the Inter-
national Music Fund, set UIJ by the
American Section of the International Society
oj Contemporary Music (ISCM) to aid com-
posers and composers'societies in Europe.
- "-.'-. ./-
Of The international
THE International Music Fund has come into existence as anAct of Faith on the part of America's composers, artists and
educators-faith in the regenerative powers of creative thought.
and the exchange of creative thought, and faith in their own ability
to form, in an epoch teeming with materialist implications, an
organization that could rise above all ideological and spatial frontiers,
and demonstrate in terms of action the enduring validity and urgent
priority claims of the things of the spirit.
As in Europe, here too in America, the creative artist feels himself
to be working in a spiritual wilderness, for the darkness is a world-
wide darkness-a flood-tide of materialism, prejudice and suspicion
that threatens to engulf all other values.
Much has been written and said of the urgent necessity for a
physical and material rehabilitation in war-shattered areas of Europe ;
little is heard of the spiritual exhaustion, the psychic devastation.
the despair that is attendant upon these conditions-a spiritual
chaos that has undermined the dignity and serenity of artists aid
thinkers everywhere.
A.'Still Small Voice'.
It is in answer to this"still small voice'that the International
Music Fund speaks forth, an answer to that precious minority of
creative people who always did, always will place the eternal values
Dr. Torres Bodet greets Paul Marie Masson, noted French musicologist
at opening of Paris conference which set up World Music Council
Musicologists Create
World Council
A group of eminent Amrican and European composers, conductorsand musicologists, meeting in Paris last month under the auspices
of Unesco, has brought into being an international organization which
is expected to be of immense benffit to the world of music.
After approving the steps to be taken for establishing an Interna-
tional Council of Music, the conference elected a seven-member Pre-
paratory Commission with Professor Roland Manuel of the French
National Conservatory as presi-
dent. The Commission's task will
be to convoke, later this year or
early in 1950, the first General
Assembly of the new International
Council.
The Music Council, which re-
presents the final step in pre-
parations under way since 1947
for the creation of the organiza-
tion, will serve as a liaison agency
for national and international
music organizations throughout
the world. It will help to organize
international or regional music
festivals and congresses, to en-
courage international contacts
among musicians and composers,
and to facilitate the distribution
and performance of musical
compositions. It will also study
and report on proposals for the
improvement of musical tech-
niques.
Unesco will also ask the Council
to aid in instituting a"Unesco
Prize", to be awarded for the
best musical works published each
year, and in bringing about the
adoption of a universeal standard
of pitch.
In addition to paving the way
for the future work of the
Council, the Preparatory Com-
mission will consider the possibility
of acting as an advisory bond7 to
Unesco in the distribution of
grants-in-aid offered to European
composers and composers socie-
ties by the International Music
Fund.
The Fund was established last
July by the American section of
the International Society for
Contemporary Music, in order to
encourage musical creation in
Europe. Shortly after the Fund's
foundation, Unesco was asked to
give advice as to horn it should
be allocated.
The Preparatory Commission is
at present studying the distribu-
tion of the sums placed at the
disposal of Unesco by the Inter-
nationa ! Fund.
The first project to be realized
will be the recording of music of
contemporary composers. Unesco
will get in touch with the phono-
graphic industry, and the Inter-
national Music Fund will subsidize
these recordings. The first com-
positions selected for recordings
are woorks by Luigi Dallapiccola
(Italy), Anton von Webern (Aus-
tria) and Maurice Delage (Fran-
ce).
Marcel Cuvelier, director of the
Brussels Philharmonic Society
and general secretary of the
International Federation of Mu-
sical Youth, was elected vice-
chairman of the Preparatory
Commission.
Others members of the Com-
mission are the Swiss composer
Arthur Honegger ; Edward Clark,
British orooestra leader and pre-
sident of the International
Society for Contemporary Music ;
Miss Maud Karpeles, secretary of
the International Folk Music
Council ; Paul Marie Masson, pro-
fessor at the Sorbonne and vice-
president of the International
Society for Musical Research ; and
Charles Seeger, chief of the
Division of Music and Visual Arts
of the Organization of American
States.
Music Fund
of the mind, heart and spirit before the transient ones
of the body, and to whom assistance that is designed to
enable them to formulate and bring forth a renaissance
ef their own creativity, will be hailed as the greatest
service that in this country can render them.
How Fund W ill Work
rUCH people as the Fund will seek to discover and assist, will notJ misco7stru its intention, will not mistake fellowship and good-
will for a gesture of charitable philanthropy, but will read in every
Ideal and rule set forth for the Fund's guidance a deep desire on the
part of some individuals to re-distribute more evenly such wealth
of the world as is the prerequisite for the liberating of creative minds
for their destined work in that world's service.
The organizers of the Fund have accordingly gone to work to
inaugurate a nation-wide series of Benefit Concerts and other musical
activities to raise a budget that will be collected through the U. S.
Section of the ISCM, (International Society of Contemporary Music),
and distributed to European composers and composers'organizations
through the Paris office of Unesco.
A committee has been set up in New York, and a groUlp of European
Regional Advisers are being appointed, to recommend, and make apple.
cations through the Paris Unesco headquarters, which, after due
consultation with the N. Y. Committee, wiU allot the funds raised.
Dr, Carleton Sprague Smith, Chair-
man of the American Committee of
the International Music Fund
The sponsors of the Fund will not seek to Interfere. with, or
dictate the allocation of the money, but rather-twill endeavour to
assist such activities or projects as are already in existence, or under
way.
Many types of application will be considered. It will be the desire of
the Fund to facilitate wherever possible the movement and circula-
tion of composers, and of their work from one country to another ;
to supplement the budgets of organizations wishing to perform or
commission works by living composers ; to undertake the copying of
parts or the duplication of scores ; ultimately it is hoped that exchange
of scholarships may be arranged, so that it will be possible for the
Regional Advisers to make application for such scholarships enabling
European composers and student composers to visit the United States.
UNESCO PREPARE
CHOPIN RECORD
CATALOGUE
To commemorate the cente-
nary of Chopin's death this.
year, Unesco is preparing a
special catalogue listing all
recordings of the composer's
works which have been made
throughout the world. A
similar catalogue devoted to
Beethoven is also being made
and both should be ready
about the middle of the year.
This work is part of Unesco's
project to prepare a world
catalogue of recorded music,
which is to cover classical
Western music, classical Orien-
tal music, and folk music.
A Central Index of Western
Classical Music Recordings is
already being built up at
Unesco House in Paris and,
when complete, will list about
200, 000 titles of recorded music,
starting with the first cylindri-
cal records. As new recordings
are made, the Index will be
kept up to date.
<Koussevitsky Pledges
Support
) f\R. KOUSSEVITZKY, asHonorary President of the
U. S. Section of the ISCM,
has pledged his full support and
has promised his assistance in
every way, and he himself con-
ducted the Inaugural Benefit
Concert with the Boston Sym-
phony Orchestra at Tanglewood
on 3 August 1948, when a group
of speakers representing the arts
and letters spoke for the cause,
and where Mr. Archibald Mac-
Leish was present in both the
capacities of Master of Ceremo-
nies and as U. S. representative
for Unesco.
On that occasion, Mr. George V. Allen of the State Department
wrote"that private groups take the lead in such efforts is highly
desirable. The most effective means for establishing lasting inter-
national ties among peoples is found in privately initiated activities.
It is of paramount importance that international cooperation be
developed and expanded in every way possible. The American Section
of the International Society for Contemporary Music with Dr. Serge
Koussevitzky at its head is working in a field of great significance."
Speaking at the opening of the Berkshire Summer School at
Tanglawood last year, Dr. Koussevitzky expressed similar concepts
in his own inimitable way :"The physicist calls it the atomic age,"
he said."The mystic sees in it the approach of apocalyptic times ;
it is surprising to note how little faith is shown by present-day
leaders of humanity in the creative and regenerative capacity of
cultural and spiritual values.
Lin Yutang and Correa de Azevedo, of Uneseo, discuss work of Music
Council with Harrison Kerr of U. S. Composers'AUiance, Mr. C. Seegher
and Mr. C. Sprague Smith.
"We read of millions of dollars being assigned for the vast European
Recovery Programme, but all is for physical needs-none for the
relief of the spiritual vacuum and cultural hunger of a sick mankind.
Man has indeed lost himself in the conflict with life ; he is demoralized,
and stands on the verge of spiritual failure."
The American musicians who join forces to create this Fund, work
not with any sense of patronage for their superior strength on a
material plane, nor from a sense of inadequacy and inferiority in
the creative field. For"In the field of Art,"wrote Romain Rolland
to Carleton Sprague Smith in 1939."there should not be any rivalry
between the Nations. The only combat worthy of us is that waged
in every country, at every hour, between culture and ignorance,
between light and chaos. Let us save all the light that can be saved ;
there is none more refulgent than music. It is the sum of the inner
universe."
Theatre Bulletin
Lists World Plays
THE International Theatre In-stitute UTI), formed last year
with the assistance and under
the sponsorship of Unesco, has
recently published the first num-
ber of a monthly Bulletin, which
provides a forum for countries to
make known their current the-
atrical productions and activities.
Printer in English and French,
the first Bulletin contains detail-
ed information on current plays,
operas and ballet performances
which have been supplied by Na-
tional Centres of the ITI in Bel-
gium, France, Poland, the U. S. A.
and the U. K. as well as repre-
sentative theatre sources in
Egypt, Hungary, Netherlands,
Roumania and the Union of
South Africa. where National
Centres are not yet established.
In addition to the title and the
name and address of the author
or composer, the Bulletin provides
a brief resume of each play, lists
of actors, directors, scene design-
ers, costumiers and critical ap-
praisals from newspapers

Millions of children of post-war

reach for life, and if they cannot do it

Of Post-Wa
IT the summer of 1948 Mr. Davidt Seymour, a distinguished United States
photographer, undertook for Unesco an
extensive photographic documentation of the
needs and problems of Europe's children,
with special reference to the activities of
the various U. N. agencies engaged in helping
to solve these problems.
Mr. Seymour has recently returned to
Paris after completing six months in five of
Europe's war devastated countries.
The result of this mission is an impressive
collection of over 5, 000 pictures, some of
which have already been or are soon to be
published by LIFE, ILLUSTRATED, SIE UND
ER, FRANCE-ILLUSTRATION, and other
leading magazines in various countries.
Asked to give his first-hand impressions
of this trip, Mr. Seymour told the following
story :
.-
Eyes And Camera Open
To The Faces Or Children
. ii  S a photographer, I don't know much
A'-about words. I speak the language of
pictures. I look around and I try to
record what I see. In the last six months I saw
plenty. I went to Poland, Hungary, Greece, Italy
and Austria with my eyes and my camera open
to the faces of children.
"Here is my key picture to the whole series :
A bunch of kids who in the midst of the ruins
of their bombed-out cities are playing with
bricks. They are building a miniature house for
their games : they marked out two doors, and on
the doors they put up two signs : one saYs"Kin-
dergaten, Age 3 to 6'-the other"Doctor's
Office".
"Here is your answer-direct from the chil-
dren themselves. They want a school to replace
the missing warmth of their tost homes-a
place to play as well as a place to learn. They
want a doctor to protect and build up their
frail health. All over the five countries I saw
this one story : the terrible need and the great
challenge. Youngsters sitting on steps of bombed-
out naked stairways of their houses. Through
the smashed staircases you could see the sky-
the sky that is the limit for the help they need.
"I also saw the beginnings, the wonderful
beginnings of this help. In Poland, amidst the
desert of the Warsaw ghetto, I saw the oasis
of the garden school for handicapped and
backward children-orphans, kids born in con-
centration camps, war-scarred victims of all
sorts. Specially trained teachers are returning
these youngsters to normal life by making them
do productive work of the sim ! llest, vet most
convincing kind : by making them experience
that things can live again, by making them
watch their own garden growing and blossoming
and bearing fruits.

9-year old Napolitan stands before a tribunal 0

"In Greece, I saw soldiers camping in a forest
amidst scattered benches of an evacuated school.
I also saw, against the backgrou, nd of the Acro-

cinating Greek children against tuberculosis.
This is being carried out as a joint project of
two United Nations Agencies, the Children's
Emergency Fund and the World Health Organ-
ization. Together with the Danish Red Cross
and the local governments, these agencies aim
at treating, in the next five years, fifty million
children the world over. I saw fifty doctor-nurse
teams operating in Poland and Hungary with
a record of close to three million children
already tested and treated in these two countries
alone.
"Wherever I went, in any of the five countries,
the first new buildings I saw, white and cheerful
amidst the desolation of war-blinded cities, were
schools. Everywhere I saw overworked teachers
fighting with enthusiasm and resource against
shortages of school supplies-making old elec-
tric bulbs into chemistry retorts, corned reef,
cans into calorimeters, or building optical instru-
ments with raw macaroni.
"Wherever I went, I saw children playing out
their dreams of a full and peaceful life amidst
the ruins of their parents'world. Wherever
I went, I saw the efforts of UNICEF to give
them milk-so they could sleep better

Is typical of thousands of others in war-devastated Europe. Chalked legend on the black-

For the task of educating this generation of children, Europe must recruit its teachers
out of the ranks of those who have endured the common experience of war and the fight
for freedom. The task demands of them new horizons of patience and resourcefulness.
The relation of adult and child, of teacher and pupil is difficult everywhere. But in the war devastated countries of
Europe it is more difficult. For the children of Europe have, as it were, hidden themselves behind what they remember...
They must now be coaxed out from behind the façade of agression, of timidity, In the new schools being made over in

### 73927: What is being done to heal the wounds?

February 1949 UNESCO COURIER
Teen-Ae'RepubHcains'
Plug For World Pederationg
 EXT August a group of about fifty war orphans-lucky cousins of the Sciuscia boys-will be the guests of the Repnbìic of Torchok.
I  That means that the population of the"Republic"will suddenly be doubled !
For the citizens of Torchok themselves number around fifty-fifty youngsters aged fifteen
and under-who served a glorious apprenticeship with the lUaquis of the Vercors and whose"Republic"
is located within a small private estate of MouMn-Vieux, near Lavaldens, in the department of Isere,
France.
Thought out by the children themselves, this project of an"inter-
national get-together"was put before the Executive Committee of the
International Federation of Children's Communities (I. F. C. C.) by a
well-know French educator, M. Henri Julien, who represents the
"RenuMic"on the Committee.
At a recent meeting. at Unesco
House in Paris, the Committee
decided to help the Torchok
children to put their plan into
effect.
For one month this summer a
Holiday Camp at Moulin-Vieux
will bring together fifty war
orphans, between the ages of
10 and 16. They will come as
"delegates"of their comrades.
from children's communities in
Belgium, France, Hungary, Italy
and Switzerland.
These communities, which have
sprung up with the war all over
Europe, have a very strong feeling
of solidarity.
The children correspond with
each other and exchange their
publications, for they even put
out their own little editions. Last
autumn, for example, Tato, Dedee,
Denisio, Six-Sous and André (or
was it Janine, Trompette, Mitsou,
Framboise and Vitamine ?) publish-
ed a special issue of the Torchok
newspaper, written specially for
the Children's Republic of Hajdu-
hadhaza in Hungary. (See cut
below.)
To strengthen the ties between
the communities and at the same
time to interest public opinion in
the social rehabilitation of the
war's most pitiful victims, Unesco,
with the help of numerous educa-
tors, sponsored the establishment
of the International Federation of
Children's Communities last July.
Between now and August Unesco
will make every effort to obtain
the necessary visas for the"dele-
gates". And, just as it did for the
Work Camp volunteers, Unesco
will also try to secure railway re-
ductions for the Torchok guests
(1).
* * *
A LONG with the Moulin-
A Vieux project, the Executive
Committee of the I. F. C. C.
approved a second plan, for the
establishment of a"Unesco Cen-
tre"at Trogen. In this delightful
Ifumer of Switzerland, home of the-
famous Pestalozzi Children's Vil-
lags, the"Unesco Centre"will in
a way be the Alma Mater of the
children's communities of the
different countries.
In particular, it will meet two
needs which are becoming more
and more acute :
The orphans who found refuge
in the communities during and
after the war are growing up and
this, is creating new problems.
They need leaders who must be
trained, and trades which have
to be learned. The future"Unesco
Centre"in Trogen will institute
special courses for these young
war victims-of six months to a
year's duration-to train cample-
aders and international working
teams specialized in reconstruction
work.
Thanks to the
generosity of Ca-
nadian and Amer-
ican societies, the
Committee of the
t. F. C. C. hopes to
be able to start
building the Cen-
tre this year.
The I. F. C. C.
also hopes this
year to begin pub-
lishing two pe-
riodical. The first,
a scientific re-
view for commun-
ity directors, will
publish reports on
the latest educa-
tional exper-
iments being car-
ried on in each
community. The
second periodical
will be a truly in-
ternational news-
paper for children,
edited by and for
the children them-
selves.
All these problems will come up
for discussion at the Plenary
Session of the I F. C. C. next July,
when the Conference organized by
Unesco will bring together forty
directors of children's communi-
ties. It will be held in Belgium at
the"Children's City"directed by
M. B. de Cooman.

ing of the I. F. C. C. has
already been discussed by
the Citizens'Assembly, as the

its proceedings published in the

a specialist. Suppose we got
him to tell the Congress all
about our ideas, so we can
have a meeting too, with de-
legates from all the Chil-
dren's Republics, and swap
ideas.
TATO.-No, that's not
enough. Let's go much fur-
ther than that. Why not set
up a World Federation of
Children's Republics ?
For that is the Torchok spirit !
And perhaps too, the proof that
there is no better tonic for chil-
dren than work and responsibili-
ties.
In 1937, before becoming the
Capitol of the Republic, the home
of Henri and Henriette Julien was
a haven for Spanish children
driven from their homes by the
Civil War. Later, French and
pother refugee children came under
the care of"Papa"and"Mama"
Torchok, as the children call
them.
That was in 1940. If the Commu-
nity had had to choose a name at
that time, no doubt it would have
called itself the Ahasuerus Repu-
blic. It was hunted from place to
place by the Germans, right into
the French Maquis. Once, the Re-
public was forced by flood to flee
from a spot by the river where it
has pitched its tents. It had to
shift its locale several times be-
fore finally settlin&, at Moulin-
Vieux.

What Is Being Done
To Heal The Wounds ?
THE article printed below is the partial text of a broadcast madefrom Unesco House last month by Mr. W. D. Pile, Secretary of the
United Kingdom National Unesco C01ñmission, after attending a
meeting of National Reconstruction Exprts on January 3 and 4 :
? ? M am talking from a room in Unesco House, in Paris ; a tall,

talks in 1919 took place, and where German H. Q. was

of the interminable corridors. I
am sitting here quite alone, pack-
ing my dispatch case. The Com-
mittee is over. The Committee of
Experts on Educational, Scientif-
ic and Cultural Reconstruction
is over. The other delegates have
gone.
Probably by now some huge
four-motored Constellation, sleek
and fat as a plump Scotch sal-
mon, is carrying my American
colleagues back to the United
States. In an hour's time the
Canadians will be on their way
home across the Atlantic. I too
will be leaving at dawn tomorrow
for London.
As I put the files and papers
away into my bag, I keep asking
myself"What have I been doing ?
What has all this been about ?
Reconstruction ? Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Recon-
struction ? What does it mean ?"
In going through one of the
Committee's documents, I read
that in China a school teacher, if
he wants to send an airmail
letter to Europe, must spend his
whole month's salary to buy the
necessary stamp. Behind this
stark ridiculous fact lies a whole
history of Chinese education to-
day ; war and education ; infla-
tion and education ; disaster and
education.
&commat; &commat; &commat;
HAT this Committee tried
..,. to do for two days was to
discover ways and meth-
ods of rehabilitating educa-
tion, science and culture in the
distressed and war-devastated
areas of the world.
It is not worth trying to cal-
culate the damage to educa-
tional, scientific and cultural
institutions and services which
resulted from the war. The
figures and facts are meaningless
. BURMA : and I saw this my-
self during the warall that was
left of the anatomy schools in
Rangoon Medical College were
the dissecting tables-and they
only because they were made of
stone and could not be carried
away by the Japanese.
POLAND : 43 % of her cul-
tural resources, 60 % of her edu-
cational services wiped out. The
cost-if you care to put a price
to human civilisation-seven
hundred and fifty thousand mil-
lion pounds. It is not worth going
on. The figures numb one's
awareness.
&commat; &commat; &commat;
A ND yet this Committee has
been trying to face up to
this problem.
The Reconstruction Depart-
ment has only about E125, 000 out
of this to spend in 1949 ; it hires
from this sum a staff of about 20
people, and it is allowed to 5e
only about. E45, 000 on direct pur-
chase of supplies and aid. It has
bought, packed and distributed 50
scientific workshops, 74 micro-
scopes, 80 balances, 100 test me-
ters ; 394 radio 168 graophones.
It has bought other things. It
has distributed over 2, 000 sets of
scientific periodicals, over 55, 000
miscellaneous publications, 300
sets of the Encyclopaedia Britan-
nica, 48 microfilm readers.
&commat; &commat; &commat;
II closed my bag and lookedround for my coat. Yes,
225 fellowships, 55, 000 mis-
cellaneous publications, 74 micro-
scopes on the credit side and
there, on the debit side, figures
taken at random, 50, 000 books
lost at Louvain in Belgium, 580
microscopes smashed in Belgrade,
750, 000 million pounds'worth of
damage in Poland.
But I remembered that the aid
which I have mentioned was only
what the Headquarters of Unesco
could give, from its limited bud-
get. Unesco is not and was never
meant to be a relief agency. No,
its real task has always been re-
cognized to be that of stimulating
and coordinating the national
efforts of its Member States to
meet the reconstruction needs of
the war-devastated countries.
There, national efforts have been
remarkable.
Six countries, for instance, In
1948, together produced over half
a million pounds. The Canadian
Council for Reconstruction
through Unesco collected about
half of this, some two Qj. mdred
and fifty thousand pounds. Aus-
tralia has produced. S90. 000 of
which a third wil be used to pro-
vide educational equipment and
the remainder to endow 22 fellow-
ships. New Zealand has found
. f : l, 500 for fellowships. Norwa. y
and Belgium together over. f : 100,-
COO. And the United Kingdom, as
the result of the 10 % given to
Unesco from the proceeds of the
Lord Mayor of London's United
Nation's Appeal for Children, has
contributed about. S70. 000.
tS cfp cfp
lrHEN there is quite apartfrom the aid given as the
result of joint operations by
Unesco and its Member States,
the almost incalculable volume of
asistance which voluntary so-
cieties in nearly every country in
the world are sending to the de-
vastated countries. The Council
for International Educational Re-
construction in the U. S. has dur-
ing 1947 and 1948 collected and
spent nearly two hundred million
dollars.
The Committee looked at three
major quarters of an emergency
character. The first, how to raise
funds in 1949. In 1948 many coun-
tries launched campaigns for
funds under the United Nations
Appeal for Children. This Appeal
was directed to the physical and
mental needs of children-food
and education. In 1949, however,
the United Nations are planning
a campaign which will be directed
exclusively towards the physical
needs of children. This Appeal
will be launched by the U. N. In-
ternational Children's Emergency
Fund. The problem therefore is
how an appeal for funds, for help,
for educational reconstruction,
can be launched. In fact it is a
problem of cho-ordinating two
world-wide appeals to voluntary
agencies.

INDIAN DEMOGRAPHER
Looks At'World
Population Problems
A BOUT twenty million people are being added every year to the
A'-world population. In 1940 the total world population was
estimated at 2. 170 minions-probably an underestimate as it
includes some'guestimates'for certain regions for which we have
no reliable census data. Even during the second world war the
population had continued to increase. Today this increase is being
maintained despite minor wars, regional epidemics and widespread
under-nutrition, if not starvation.
By 1950 the total world copula-
tion will exceed 2, 400 million if marriage between modem science
the present trends of fertility and
mortality continue.
The fact that there are two
and a quarter billion people to-

day or that there will be three
billion, at some near future date
need not be a problem if all
these people can be assured of
irreductible minimum require-
ments and decent human exist-
ence in terms of food, clothing,
shelter, education and leisure. But
a great majority of the world's
population are today denied these
necessities. And there seems to be
no prospect that they will have
these necessities if the present
population continues to grow out-
stripping our means of produc-
tion.
F course this is a con-troversial problem and a
discussion of population.
problems often produces more
heat than light because of the
clash of various economic, religi-
ous and political ideologies.
All recent discussion of this
problem can be summarized as
belonging to three schools of
thought. The first school main-
tains that our natural resources
are not only not increasing with
the growth of human population
but what is worse they are actual-
ly dwindling on a global scale,
resulting as it were, in a double
crisis. As the world population
continues to increase there, will
be less and less for everybody of
goods and services and the only
road to survival is through a
drastic reduction in the birth
rate.
HE second school maintainsthat the world demographic
problem is not one of in-
creasing population and dwindl-
ing resources but one of global
under production and mal-distri-
bution. They maintain that the
world's total production of food,
fibre and feed can be doubled and
and agriculture and food produc-
tion is effected.
So then the core of the problem
is not lack of food but one of
want of a heart and one of prop-
er distribution. The world to
them is the familiar old picture
of poverty in the midst of plenty.
you may call this school social-
istic, communistic or catholic or
what you will but they vigour-
ously maintain that a consider-
able segment of the world is un-
derfed, underc10thed and under-
housed because of our defective
economic and political patterns.
The third school brushes all
this discussion away as naive on
the ground that we don't have
enough knowledge one way or the
other to reach a definite con-
clusion. They contend that we
know yet little of the potenti-
"Tomorrow morning there
will be 55, 000 more persons
for breakfast than there
were in the world this
morning, and the day after
tomorrow 55, 000 more and
so on daily... 20 to 25 mil-
lion more people annually.
But we are not producing
55, 000 more cups of milk a
day for the new children,
nor 55, 000 more loaves of
bread, nor 55, 000 more
bowls of rice."

alities of man or the future posset-
bilities of science to warrant an
optimistic or a pessimistic con-
clusion. They say that tomorrow
the Sahara desert may be made
into a smiling wheatfield and the
Arctic may be thawed into a tro-
pical paradise. Or on the other
hand there may be a huge cata-
clysm and man may commit
collective suicide.
....., OW what is the truth one
 may ask ? The answer is
one of the things that the
social scientists of the, world and
Unesco are trying to discover as
a contribution to the understand-
ing and lessening of international
tensions. There is no space here
to discuss the answer. But to be
realistic one must realize the
tremendous importance of this
question and the relation the
question and the possible answer
bear to international tensions.
No matter where the real truth
lies. to us the world population
problems are realistic enough in
the sense that in one way or
another population growth-
deliberate or unconscious-has
been the reason behind the de-
mand for lebensraum and decla-
ration of wars, accession to raw
materials and unrestricted free-
dom to migrate from one coun-
try to another.
Certain countries like Sweden
or the United States of America
may maintain a high level of
living by a deliberate control of
its numbers. Some other coun-
tries like India and China may
leave it to God and Nature, and
reduce their level of living.
If this differential growth of
peoples leading to great differ-
ences in standards of living be-
comes a permanent feature, the
one world of our dreams where
wars become an ugly memory of
the past can never be realized.
HE differential growth ofnational populations Is not
the only major problem.
Within nations the differential
growth of various etiinic, religi-
ous, linguistic and cultural
groups Is an ever present sore
spot leading to intergroup ten-
sions. One group is always afraid
that another group is 6Iutbreed-
ing it.
We have plenty of examples :
White and Negro ; White and
Nisei, Latin American and Mexi-
can in the United States of
America ; Jew and Arab in the
Middle East ; Hindu and Moslem
in India and Pakistan ; Chinese,
Malayans and Indians in Malaya ;
Boer, Briton and Bantu in South
Africa ; the Fijians and Indians in
Fiji and so on.
What is the answer to these
conflicts engendered by all plural
communities and heterogeneous
population groups ? In fact all the
popularly called minority prob-
lems belong to this group. Can
we find a way out ?
There are a hundred other
problems of a similar demogra-
phic nature including inter-group
and international tensions. And,
it is the business of social scien-
tists to throw light on those prob-
lems in the hope of an eventual
and acceptable solution.
. HUMANISTS SET UP
INTERNATIONAL BODY
WITH UNESCO SUPPORT
INTERNATIONAL organizations representing philosophy, folk artsand folklore, languages, historical sciences and classical and
academic subjects are for the first time centralizing their work
through the International Council for Philosophy and Humanistic
Studies.
This'Council, which was creat-
ed on January 18th, under the
auspices of Unesco, held its first
General Assembly in Brussels,
Belgium, last month and drew up
a programme of work for the next
three years.
The Council's first aim will be
to establish contacts between
scientists iWorking in different
fields but wvhosa subject matter
for research is the study of Man.
An observation of an anthropolo-
gist is often valuable to a linguist ;
a discovery of a linguist may show
a historian that his enquiries are
on the right lines and a parti-
cular feature in folklore often
throws light on the literary heri-
tage of mankind.
Until now there has been little
or none of the cross fertilization
which human. sciences need in
order to progress. The Council's
work as a clearing house of in-
formation or, the activities going
on in this broad field of intellec-
tuai activity is expected to be of
great value to human scientists
throughout the world.
Linguists, Folklorists
Participate'
The Council'* programme to
facilitate this cross diffusion of
information will include the ex-
change of bibliographies, resumes
of articles, general information
bulletins and the organization of
conferences, symposia and scien-
tific missions-
Already six international organ-
izations are represented on the
Council and further accessions
are expected during 1949 : Inter-
national Academic Union, Inter-
national Commission on Folk
Arts and Folklore, Permanent
International Committee of
Linguists, International Com-
mittee of Historical Sciences, In-
ternational Federation of Classic-
al Associations and the Interna-
tional Federation of Philosophical
Societies.
The firet step towards setting
up the Council was taken in No-
vember 194T. when Unesco's Gen-
eral Conference adopted a resolu-
tion to encourage the establish-
ment of such an organization,
. which iwould be analogous to the
International Council of Scien-
tific Unions.
Early last year, old and new
organizations declared themselves
in favour of the creation of such
a council and in September 1948
representatives of five interna-
tional bodies met at Unesco
House and set up a preparatory
commission which was instructed
to arrange the General Assembly
of the Council.
Committee Officers Elected
At its meeting in the Palais des
Academies in Brussels last month,
the Council elected as its chair-
man M. J. Rueff, representative
of the Institut de France on the
International Academic Union.
Two vice-chairmen were elected :
Mr. A. Sommerfelt, President of
the Permanent International
Committee of Linguists and Pro-
fessor at Oslo University and Sir
Harold Bell, representative of the
British Academy on the Interna-
tional Academic Union. M. R.
Fawtier, Vice-President of the In-
ternational Committee of Histori-
cal Sciences and professor at the
Sorbonne, was elected General
Secretary.
The next meeting of the Perma-
nent Committee of seven mem-
bers (1), which will be responsible
for carrying out the Assembly's
decisions, will be held at Unesco
House in Paris next June.
(1) The seven members of the Perma-
nent Committee are : M. de Visscher,
President of the International Academic
Union and a Judge of the International
Court of Justice ; Mr. Berries, member
of the American Council of Learned
Societies and professor, Harvard Univ-
ersity ; M. Rivet, Director, Musée de
1'Homme, Paris ; Mile Mohrmann. Secre-
tary Genera), Permanent International
Committee of Linguists and professor
at Utrecht University ; M. ffabhoh,
President of the International Com-
mittee of Historical Sciences and pro-
fessor at the University of Zurich ; M.
Hoe :, President of the International
Federation of Classical Associations
and professor at the University of
Copenhagen ; M. Pes, President of the
International Federation of Philosophio
Societies and professor at the Univer-
sity of Amsterdam.
U. S. Conference To Stress Group,
Individual Action For Unesco
ONCRETE ways in which individuals and communities can parti-
f,---, cipate in the work of Unesco will be discussed and demonstrated
by practical examples at the second nation-wide conference of
the U. S. National Commission, meeting ia Cleveland, Ohio, from
March 31 to April 2.
Dr. Jaime Torres Bodet will fly to the United States from Paris
to deliver the principal address on"Unesc ()-A Personal Faith", in which-.---.
he will explain Why he has
dedicated himself to serve the
cause of international collabora-
tion in science, education and
culture.
At its Cleveland meetings, the
U. S. National Commission will
develop the theme"Nations will
come together, not to destroy but
construct", inspired by the words
of Louis Pasteur. (1)
"Unesco's programme has come
into sharper focus since members
met in Philadelphia two years
ago", Milton E. Eisenhower,
chairman of the U. S. National
Commission, recently declared.
"Our purpose this time is to keep
abreast of new developments and
to find better ways of getting
the Unesco story to more people."
Community Cooperation
THE conference, which will haveits headquarters at the Clevel-
and Auditorium with a seating
capacity for 10. 000 people, will
discuss six important areas within
which communities can co-operate
on Unesco objectives. Presented
(1)"I hold the unconquerable belief
that science and peace will triumph
over ignorance and war. that nations
will come together, not to destroy but
to construct, and that the future
belongs to those who accomplish most
for humanity."
as"Unesco"s Challenge to the
American People", they will be
devoted to the global implications
of Human Rights, the interchange
of persons, educational reconstruc-
tion through Unesco, the position
of the UN., advancement of world
civilization through arts ails
sciences, and education for the
world community.
Special panels of experts will
explain Unesco's responsibility and
programme as well as the oppor-
tunities for community action
in respect to each of these topics.
Individual Participation
HE best ways in which indi-viduals can constructively
take part in Unesco activities
will also receive % onsiderab) e dis-
cussion by the educators, scientists
and publicists representing differ-
ent U. S. national organizations
who are expected to attend th*
conference in Cleveland.
Fourteen groups, each examin-
ing such different facets of
community life as the press and
radio, schools, civic, labour
and farm organizations, libraries,
churoh organizations, adult edu-
cation services, or the theatre will
show how individuals can help
put community resources to work
on Unesco objectives and how
these efforts may be extended.
Thus, for example, the con-
ference will show how the mass
media are being used to advance
international understanding, how
music and other arts contribute
to the sense of world community,
and how the schools in the United
States are developing citizens
conscious of the world and without
prejudice toward differences
among races and religions.
Delegates will have an oppor-
tunity to see how the Cleveland
community has organized to carry
out Unesco's aims as well as
special exhibitions and fiJrns on
projects carried out in other
communities.
Featured Speakers
IN announcing last Decemberthat Dr. Torres Bodet had
accepted to travel to Cleveland,
Milton Eisenhower told newspa-
permen :"I speak on behalf of the
U. S. National Commission when I
say that Dr. Torres Bodet's visit
to our country will give added
impetus to a programme for inter-
national understanding which has
already stirred the imagination of
millions of Americans."
Among the other featured speak-
ers announced for the Cleveland
Conference are Mrs. Franklin D.
Roosevelt, who will discuss the
Declaration of Human Rights ;
George V. Allen, Assistant Secre-
tary of State ; and Milt9D S. Eisen-
hower.

NEW ADVENTURES
For. struggling Educators
 A New Z I d
 strug ling  ew ea an er
Views Unesco Educational Missions
I[) URING the past few years I have seen something of educationin many countries. Three things have particularly struck me.
The first is that practically all countries are facing the same
educational problems. They are, of course, at different stages in their
development, and each country has some problems that are peculiarly
its own ; but there is a solid core of common difficulties with which
educators throughout the world are struggling. Those of us who have
By
Clarence E. BEEBY,
Assistant Director-General of Unesco in charge
of Education
faced these problems in distinct
corners of the earth find some
slight comfort in knowing that
we are not alone in our perplexity.
My second discovery brings
more solid comfort. It is that at
least partial solutions to some of
these problems have already been
found, in scattered spots through-
out the world, and that able, and
sometimes brilliant, work is being
done on them in many countries.
But the third thing I have dis-
covered in my travels is the
extreme slowness with which
educational ideas and practices
spread. Within the past twelve
months I have seen schools that,
in more advanced countries, would
have been outdated a century
ago ; and there are few of us who,
in our own countries, cannot point
to schools that, as far as their
practices are concerned, are fifty
years apart in time through only a
few miles apart in space. In the
past quarter of a century, great
advances in educational methods
have taken place in many schools,
but they spread across natural
borders, and even with nations,
at a maddeningly snail-like pace.
If, for example, the knowledge
of penicillin had travelled through
the world as slowly as has the
knowledge of new teaching tech-
niques in the infant school, there
would have been a public outcry.
Schuman, Bidault
Welcome Torres Bodet
(Continued from page 3.)
Dr. Torres Bodet continued :
"Unesco was boron in order that
a lack of understanding between
the peoples should not lead to
fresh wars... Unesco's task is not
to make the peace which cannot
be improvised and. which de-
minds long years of effort and
education."
"oaf all our main reasons for
anxiety,"the Director-General
went on,"the most urfent might
be summed up in this question :
Can the peoples organize their
freedom in peace-time with the
same energy they put forth dur-
ing the war to save it ? Is each
citizen capable of choosing,
without violence but also with-
out weakness, between resigna-
tion to a regime of automatic
obedience and the sense of per-
sonal responsibility ? That, in my
"view, is the burning question
of our time. It cannot be settled
without the help of aU the
peoples standing together and a
pressing appeal, within each
separate nation, to the con-
science of every individual."

structure of Unesco was based on

the idea that the continuing
functions of the Organization
were in the hands of the Sec-
retarIat in Paris, guided by the
Executive Board, and secondly of
the governments themselves as-
sisted by the National Com-
missions, Dr. Torres Bodet de-
clared :
of my essential tasks
will be to make it possible for
the National Commissions to
give us the full cooperation we
hope for..."
"It is little enough,"he. went
on,"jf the various nations are
content to let Unesco work alone
and merely use it as a forum in
IIVnich they are supposed, once a
year, to give voice to lofty senti-
ments...
The National Commissions,
Unesco's Director-General added.
could help Unesco directly bv
"mobilizing"the scholars, writers.
research workers, philosophers
and artists in every country to
be"volunteers in the service of
peace through culture, of science
for peaceful aims and of peace
through education"
"Unesco as such,"Dr. Torres
Bodet said,"will never be other
than peoples and governments
wish it and make it. For myself,
I do not limit these efforts to
the fields of science and culture.
I scan more distant horizons of
social justice. Happiiy, amid so
many reasons for misgiving. the
reception France has always
accorded to Unesco is of great
comfort to us."
After Dr. Torres Bodet had
spoken, M. Georges Bidault sur-
veyed the work of the Beirut
Conference. He warned that the
tendency to extol the indepen-
dence of each separate culture
involved certain risks for world
culture as a whole :"Never, on
the plea of ensuring that Unesco
will be favourably looked upon

of Unesco is to help meet

An educational mission is simply
an international team of edu-
cators sent by Unesco te advise a
Member State on some of its edu-
cational problems. In theory at
least, the process is a simple one.
The Member State asks Unesco
for a mission, and states the fields
of education in which advice is
required. Unesco sets out : ; 0 find,
from anywhere in the world, an
international group of experts
whose experience peculiarly fits
them to advice the Member Stat--
on those particular problems. The
government concerned must, na-
tura) ! y. agree to the experts
chosen.

The first task, obviously, 15 to
discover what 15 going on in edu-

special contribution each country
has to make to the solution of the
world's educational problems.
The first thing one finds out,
incidentally, 15 that no one coun-

progress, and that almost every
country has some lesson that : t
can teach the rest of the world.
The mere collection of inform-

task. Unesco 15 primarily interest-

we organize world conferences on

ers to special experiments in

as"pilot projects"for the rest of
the world.

THE second question was whathelp could be given to
bring educational assistance
to the 400, 000 Arab refugees now
sheltering in the Middle East
from the ravages of a present
war. It will take one hundred mil-
lion dollars to meet their needs
adequately but 50, 000 dollars will
meet emergency needs. Plans were
agreed as to how this small sum
can be rapidly raised, and placed
at the disposal of Unesco, and
spent in the Middle East.
The third problem was what
steps could be taken to resettle
in educational scientific and cul-
tural employment, the 40, 000 in-
teJlectual refugees at present in
the keeping of the I. R. O. Plans
were made to try to place
as many of these specialists as
possible. Perhaps before July 1,
1950, when I. R. O. closes down,
these persons, caught between a
distinguished past and an un-
certain future will all be plae1
in universities, laboratories, and
schools of Unesco Member States.
Well, as I prepared to leave
this committee room on my way

year and next year from all of us

who cover between them the fields
of study, who are acceptable to
the Government concerned, who
represent different national cul-
tures, who can all be spared at
the same time from positions I
importance in their own countries,
and who can be relied upon to
work as an amicable team-such
complications must be expert..
enced to be understood.
There is not much previous ex-
perience to guide us. I know of'only one earlier example of an
international educational mission,
one sent to China in 1930 by the
League of Nations. Indeed, with-
out some such international or-
ganization as Unesco, it would be
practically impossible tc arrange
for a genuinely international
mission of this type, and any
country wanting advice on its
educational problems would have
to seek help from S<'mp. ether
individual country.
Philippines
URING the past few weeksUnesco has signed contracts
to send educational missions
to two of its Member States, and
two other missions are being ne-
gotiated. The first mission to
enter the field will be that to the
Republic of the Philippines, which
is due to arrive there at the
beginning of February.
Its leader will be Professor
Floyd W. Reeves, of Chicago Uni-
versity, who is an authority an
the administration and financing
of education. Dr. Paul Hanna, of
Leland Standford University, Cali-
fornia, will be primarily respon-
sible for the survEy of elementary
education ; Dean C. A. Lewis of the
Ontario College of Education wiD
concentrate on the teacher train-
ing aspects, and Dr. S. Y. Chu, se-
cond-in-command of the Chinese
Mass Education Movement, will
be the authority on adult educa-
tion. A Frenchman, 1\1. Jean Gui-

tariat of arranging the Mission,
will go to the Philippines to see U
established.
The Mission is expected to stay
in the Philippines from three to
four months, and its report
should be ready by about the
middle for the year. It will be
awaited with keen interest in the
Philippines, which are facing the
double problems of war-devasta-
tion and of a newly-found inde-
pendence. For the past few
months there has been intense
governmental and public interest
in education, and Unesco can at
least be sure that its first mission
will be to a country ready and
anxious to listen to it.
mission to Afghanistan 18 in
A'-courses of preparation. The
problems there are peculiarly
interesting because of-the varied
national and cultural influence
that have gone to mould its
education system into its present
form. The topics on which the
Government wants advice are
primary, secondary, and voca-
tional education. An effort is
being made to secure a three-man
team from three different
countries.
It is, of course, too early as yet
to say what the results of these,
and Unesco's other missions, will
be. The final criterion will be
the practical effects they have
on education in the countries to
which they are sent. But, however
sceptical one may be, one cannot
but find encouragement in the
fact that the countries of the
world are willing, without any
selfish or ulterior motive, to give
practical help to individual States
that want to improve the educa-
tion of their people. It is a form
of mutual assistance that is, I
fear, still uncommon enough to be
exciting.

### 73934: The Case against and for 'comic books'

### 73935: Did your local radio carry this news?

12 UNESCO COURIER
February 1949
The Case Against And For
'Comic Books'
/1) N February 19, Unesco's first weekly radio programme"Unesco World Review", went on the air. One o/the
feature stories included in the 15-minute programme
was inspired by recent French discussions on the effects of
the comic strips on children and adolescents. The article
printed below was taken from the raà : io script. It gives
some of the points which have been discussed. recently on
both sides of the Atlantic.
JI UST about fifty years'ago, an unsung artist told a funnystory in a strip of cartoons-and thereby started a giant
new industry, sent educators to bed with nightmares and
changed the reading habits of millions of children-and their
parents.
The latest blast in the storm of protest stirred by comics
comes from France where superhuman exploits and glorified
gungirls were debated on the floor of the French Chamber of
Deputies. The result was a law to protect children and
adolescents by forbidding any publication building up banditry,
stealing, hatred, cowardice and cheating. A committee repre-
senting the government, youth associations and the press will
enforce the law, supported by the Ministry of Justice.
The French measures to protect juveniles from undesirable
reading matter are symptomatic of the rising general concern
about the flood of new publications, the so-called comics, aimed
at young readers. This mounting uneasiness has been noticeable
in the homeland of the comics-the United States-as in most
other countries ; Unesco's Director-General, Dr. Jaime Torres
Bodet, expressed his concern about comics of the Superman
type at a press luncheon recently in Paris.
THE French Minister of Justice stressed that this new lawis in no way an infringement of the liberties of the press.
It has been passed mainly as a result of a campaign by the
French Teachers'League which has taken a special interest
in the fight against the comics. According to the League's
figures, eighty-eight per cent of the juvenile delinquents in
France are ardent readers of comics. The efforts to combat
such publications have undoubtedly been stimulated by the
alarming rise of juvenile delinquency in many countries.
In the United States, an advisory committee has been
established by the Association of Comic Magazine Publishers,
whose members are responsible for forty per cent of the
enormous comics output in the United States, to improve
comic books and use this technique for constructive educational
purposes.
Another example comes from Mamaroneck, New York, where
a group of parents has gone ahead and organized an
independent publishing company-The Once Upon a Time
Press. Its first publication war, a fairly tale by Hans Christian
Andersen, with illustrations.
Complaints against Comics I
Irrealism, Violence and Nightmares
'N7HAT is, then, the case against the comics ?
"That most of them are badly written and badly drawn-
trash in short-is a thing apart. The main charge is the cornice
preoccupation with violence in all its forms. Murder in its most
cruel aspects, sadism, fights, explosions, war on an inter-
planetary scale, these are the main themes of too many of the
so-called comics.
Another complaint is that the comics, instead of popularizing
science, make science everyman's fool and remove it from the
realm of reality and the possible to the land of nightmare and
fantasy,
A third accusation is that the heroes and heroines, withwhom the readers identify themselves, are, in most cases,
gangsters or pin-up girls. The girls can be explained by the
fad the press for adults usually carries comic strips and tries
to catch their interest as well as that of juvenile readers. It
is certain that comics now are far from exclusively read by
children and adolescents. Adults often start their daily paper
with Flash Gordon or Jane, should the front page not carry
a story also revelling-is violence.
Another serious charge is that the comics really are roeant
for illiterates. The text on the whole confines itself to exclama-
tions like Ohhh ! Ugh ! bang, whiz, bump, etc., and the conten
dwindles to nothing.
All this would not be worth serious concern, were it not for
the tremendous popularity and diffusion of these comics. This
popularity shows, among other things, that the technique is a
good technique.
The problem is how to use this new mass medium in a
constructive manner. One way would be to paint a sympathetic
picture of the foreigner and the under-privileged. Thus, the
strips could make their contribution to international under-
standing and tolerance.
