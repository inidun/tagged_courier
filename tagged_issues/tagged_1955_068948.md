FORGOTTEN SHADOWS
With this photo a man sneezed his way into
cinema history. In 1893 Fred Ott, a former
comedian working as a laboratory mechanic
for Thomas Edison, was filmed in the world's
first studio, in New Jersey, doing his sneezing
act. Because of this Ott has been called the
world's first motion picture actor, but his
right to the title has been sharply disputed.

MC. 54.1 88. A
A few years ago the National Library of Peru, in the-
heart of Lima, created a traffic jam which was repeated
every day for more than two weeks. Outside the library
the street was crowded with adults and children. As they
filedjpast the entrance, the visitors were counted by a photo¬
electric cell flicking monotonously at a rate which went as
high as five thousand a day. The attraction was a travelling
exihibition, intended to explain very simply the newest
developments in science, to take science out of the bewil¬
dering maze of the laboratory and bring it to the public.
That exhibit which dealt with physics and astronomy was
seen throughout Latin America and is still travelling. It was
followed by three other science exhibitions which have
already been seen in 26 countries by about 1,500,000 people.
But in the files of Unesco there is something even more
important than the itinerary of the travelling exhibitions,
more important than the names and number of the countries
visited. It is the evidence of the incalculable enrichment
these exhibitions and others on education and the arts have
brought to the lives of countless persons in small towns
as well as large cities on every continent.
One day, for example, a Unesco exhibition on modern art
arrived, at a place called Tizi-Ouzou, a small, rarely visited
town in the rugged hills of Algeria. It was on a tour
organized for overseas areas by the French National Com¬
mission for Unesco. From miles around villagers flocked
into Tizi-Ouzou to take a look. Some -came, scratched their
heads and with a shrug went away. Many others, like the
schoolmaster from the distant mountains of Kabylia, looked
for à long time and then sat down and wrote Unesco their
impressions.
"I was passing through Tizi-Ouzou," the schoolmaster said,
"and was privileged to be able to see the Unesco travelling
exhibition on modern art... Until now I had no chance to
see modern paintings at first hand and your exhibit revealed
to me a form of art I knew nothing about and the very
existence of which I barely suspected."
There are numerous examples of whole communities
joining together to buy a duplicate set of a Unesco exhibition
in order to be sure that it would always be on display or
in circulation in the country. After one exhibition had been
shown at the Perth Art Gallery in Australia, a public
subscription was started to which students, teachers, artists
and other citizens contributed one hundred pounds for the
purchase of a duplicate set. And the curator of the Perth
gallery wrote : "The exhibition proved a great stimulus to
the art-loving public and created considerable interest
among those to whose notice it brought the work of some
contemporary artists for the first time."
At present, travelling art exhibits on the Old Masters,
Modern Art, Leonardo da Vinci and old Japanese woodcuts
are touring the world. Other Unesco exhibitions have includ¬
ed a broad range of subjects such as the emancipation of
women, freedom of information, music and the cinema,
children's books, education and peace, school architecture,
man's fight against the desert and the jungle, the history
of human rights, and the protection of nature.
This issue of the Courier has been inspired by three
recent Unesco exhibitions. Two Thousand Years of Chinese
Art, Man Measures the Universe, and Horizons of the
Cinema. Only limited aspects of these, of course, could be
dealt with in these pages. "Horizons of the Cinema" was
first erected at the International Film Festival at Venice in
1953, and is now a permanent exhibit at the Paris Institut
des Hautes Etudes Cinématographiques. A smaller version
(on the origins of the cinema) is touring or has completed
tours of cities and towns in 12 countries. It has been
shown at educational conferences in Egypt, Spain and
Canada. In Canada it has also served as the basis for an
important television programme.
It is now sixty years since the motion picture was invent¬
ed. The following pages are a salute on the part of Unesco
to the artists and technicians who have contributed to it
as a means of human expression.

Unesco Courier. NM. 1955
I
f it weren't for the fact that a strip of film is quicker than
the .eye the retina, to be exact the cinema would
not even exist.
Hollywood and Elstree and the two-gun cowboy hero and
the most stupendous epic ever made and the Saturday nights
of hundreds of millions around the world all depend on the
retina's ability to hold an image for a scant tenth of a
second after it has vanished.
During that tenth of a second, you actually see what isn't
there any more. If the vanishing images flash in front
of your eye quickly enough, they merge together in a stream
of movement. And the retina is unable to tell the dif¬
ference between a movement broken down into a series
of still pictures and the actual movement itself.
Ever since antiquity, men have known about this retina
time lag. In the 17th Century, the magic lantern . made its
bow along with a host of gadgets intended to create
an illusion of movement. But they seemed destined to
remain as parlour toys. Even the invention of photography
did not change matters at first because the pioneers of the
camera, after all, were trying to break down or stop
movement, not to create it.
Then, a long ' step forward was made when, in 1877,
an English photographer in California, Eadweard Muybridge,
rigged a set of cameras side by side next to a race track
.and was able to take a series of 24 pictures breaking down
the movements of a galloping horse. Then a French
scientist, Etienne Marey, built a camera capable of taking

several photos a second to help him study birds in flight.
Photography had now proved capable of recording move¬
ments which the .human eye could not catch. At the same
time experimenters were able to show that the eye could
be fooled by pictures flashing before it at a speed of from
six to forty images a second. Now the problem was to
take that many pictures in so short a time. As long as
photographers were limited to glass plates, it seemed in¬
soluble. Then along came the invention of celluloid roll
film, in 1889. Things happened quickly after that.
Although there is still much dispute over which of the
many film inventors first succeeded in showing his pictures
on a screen, both Thomas Edison and the Lumière Brothers
(Louis and Auguste) share the glory of having made the
"cinematograph" a reality. (The world itself was coined
by the Franchman Leon Bouly in 1893 when he patented
a moving picture machine under this name. Other in¬
ventors achieved success with astounding simultaneity:
C. Francis Jenkins and Thomas Armat in the United States,
Robert Paul and William Friese-Greeh in England, Le Prince,
in France.)
Edison began his basic work on moving photographs in
1887. . Two years later, on October 6, 1889, he gave the
first demonstration of the Edison Kinetoscope. His moving
picture films, though they lasted less than a minute, ushered
in the era of cinema production. Their eyes glued to the
viewers of the peepshow Kinetoscope (photo page 15)
spectators were able to glimpse a favourite vaudeville artist
or penetrate the secrets of an opium den or even relive
the execution of Mary, Queen of Scots.

### 68942: Forgotten shadows: the cinema and its origins

FOHGOTTEX SHADOWS (Continued)
For several years the Kinetoscope was a popular novelty
but it did not project an image on a screen. In 1895 Louis
Lumière and his brother Auguste, sons of a French manu¬
facturer of photographic supplies, patented the "cinéma¬
tographe" machine for taking and projecting motion
pictures. On December 28 of the same year, the first time
in history, a true audience 120 persons jammed into the
Grand Café on Paris' Boulevard des Capucines was able
to watch a moving film pictured on a screen. The film in
question was only a small documentary' shot by Lumière
showing factory workers going out to lunch. The same
programme presented the home life of his family complete
down to the goldfish bowl and a train entering a station.
The critics hailed them as "a slice of real life".
Destiny decided that the Grand Café audience of 1895
included a certain Georges Méliès, a music-hall magician
who had been baffling audiences for over eight years with
his sleight-of-hand. He saw ' immediately that this was
more than a new scientific marvel ; to him it was a new
kind of magic, and he determined to make films himself.
One day he accidentally discovered double exposure cinema¬
tography and realized at once that he could use it to create
any visual illusion on the screen. ..and that films could be
turned into a new entertainment medium and a new art.
In October 1896, two years after Edison had' completed
the first film studio, the Black Maria, Méliès began
construction of his own studio in the suburbs of Paris. Even
a producer of 1955 would recognize it with its stages, flood¬
lights and a movable cabin for shooting. There Méliès was
able to invent many of the tricks of the trade which film¬
makers still use today dissolves, shooting against a black
background to bring out relief, and the use of one actor to
play two or even more roles. Like Edison and others before
him, he also dabbled in talkies, trying to find a way of
synchronizing a phonograph with his silent films.
Méliès alone shot some 450 films between 1896 and 1914.
The film industry had come into the world and it proved a
lusty infant. In 1902, a theatre built specifically for film
shows opened in Los Angeles, California, and it was followed
by thousands in the United States and Europe. Even in
those early days, films were already printed by the hundreds
and distributed throughout the world.
And the public loved it... but it .constantly clamoured for
improvements. Audiences flocked to the films which offered
something new and different. The Herculean task of the
inventor had only begun. The public was fed first sound,
then colour and now relief and cinemascope and the public
is still waiting for something new again.
THE MYSTERY
MACHINE was the
name given to magic
lantern by pedlar show¬
men of 18th century.
It was usually simply a
wooden box with an
opening through which
people were able to
see images projected
on a transparent screen
by a lantern. Mounted
on wheels, the box
was a source of amuse¬
ment and wonder at
town and village fairs.
In this eternal chase after new techniques, hundreds fell
ruined by the wayside but thousands of others continued on
to wealth and fame. The spectators watched and revelled
in the struggle which had only one rule : sooner or later,
the new had to win over the old.
The film industry had to adapt itself to the struggle by
constantly experimenting and making use of the new dis¬
coveries. The result is that the history of this art is a long
tale of adventure where unexpected victories are followed
by startling defeats and where the only certainty is change.
It was round about 1914 that technical improvements and
art really met on the screen. Charlie Chaplin began making
his early films, astonishing in their wealth of sentiment and
generosity and always true to the mark in their. social satire.
But the momentous year for motion pictures was 1915
for it witnessed the production of a film D.W. Griffith's
"Birth of a Nation" which marked' the founding of the-
modern film. Despite its racial intolerance, it was and still
remains a masterpiece of cinematographic art. It is con¬
sidered one of the three most famous of all films the other
two being Carl Meyer's "The Cabinet of Dr Caligari" (Ger-

Pre-M©vie Toys
In 65 B.C. the Roman poet Lucretius
discovered what is called persistance of
visionthe ability of the retina to hold
an Image for a fraction of a second after
it has vanished. Scientists in later times
proved Its existence experimentally, but
it was not until the early 1820's in England,
that it began to be closely studied, par¬
ticularly in relation to the possibility of
making pictures " move " Dr Peter Mark
Roget now remembered as the author of
the " Thesaurus of English Words and
Phrases " was one of the first pioneers In
this field. His paper "Persistence of vi¬
sion with regard to movement " publi¬
shed In 1824 laid a foundation for all
further work.
The following year Dr. W.H. Fitton and
Dr. John Alrdas Paris invented a paper
toy called the.Thaumatrope which made
use of the Idea of persistence of vision.
This consisted of a circular card with
strings fastened to two opposite sides
(upper photos). On one side was drawn
a picture of a bird on s perch and on the
other a cage. Whirling the card about
gave the impression that the bird was
inside the cage.
In 1833, a Belgian, Dr. Joseph Plateau,
invented the Phenakitoscope (photo,
lower left). It consisted of a disk of card¬
board pierced at Its circumference by
small holes, with painted figures on Its
Inside surface. When the disk was turn¬
ed in front of a mirror, a glance
through one of the holes revealed the
illusion of the figures In motion.
Other variations of such devices were
developed but all remained little more
than Interesting toys, and no real progress
towards the cinema was made until
photography was in common use.
One of the oldest optical spectacles
Shadow Theatres came from China
and was known in Europe during the
Middle Ages. It gained a new lease of
life towards the end of the 19th century.
Operators of the shadow theatres then
worked only with their hands and a few
simple accessories. For the projection
of the shadows they used the magic
lantern. The most noted of. them at
this time was the conjuror, Trewey.

many, 1919) and Sergei Eisenstein's "Potemkin" (Russia,
1925).
By the 1920's, films had become a staple necessity like
bread or newspapers and rapidly became standardized into
types. There were the grandiose spectacle films, melo-
1 dramas, comedies, westerns, crime and racketeering pictures.
But the same period also saw the rise of new pioneers in
different countries who sought to turn the art of the cinema
into new channels of aesthetics and expression : René Clair,
in France ("Entracte"), Louis Bunuel of Spain ("Un Chien
Andalou"), V. I. Pudovkin in Russia ("Mother"), and Carl
Dreyer in Denmark ("The Passion of Joan of Arc").
Dreyer's film, produced in 1928, marks one of the last
authentic products of the silent era. The silent film had
brought an image of life to the screen ; the talkies gave this
image a voice. Its coming swept like a broad broom, revo¬
lutionizing the whole film industry. Even Charlie Chaplin,
whose pantomime for long stood as a passionate challenge
to the spoken word, admitted defeat in 1936 with his film
appropriately entitled "Modern Times."
The new era of the talking picture broke on the world on
the evening of October 6, 1927 with Warner Brothers "The
Jazz Singer" starring Al Jolson. A year before, though, a
silent film "Don Juan" had been produced with a syn
chronized musical score, and Fox had launched the Movie¬
tone Newsreel in May 1927 using a sound track. It was not
until 1941, however, that talking films reached a landmark
comparable, to Griffith's work in the silent medium. It came
with Orson Welles' "Citizen Kane".
As it developed, the sound film became not only a richer
medium of entertainment but the voice of many causes.
With more or less happy results it assumed a role as
pamphlet, sermon, textbook and political propaganda voice.
The camera, when it took sides, could be middleclass or
proletarian, socialist or anarchist, exalting or satirical.
Pacificism ("Maedchen in Uniform"); criticism of standard¬
ized mechanization ("A nous la Liberté", "Modern Times");
the sufferings of the disinherited ("Grapes of Wrath",
"Beggar's Opera", "Bicycle Thieves"); maladjusted rebels
("Pepe le Moko"); national or revolutionary epics ("Peter
the Great", "The Peasants") : such were the themes which
inspired directors and brought many stars to fame.
In little over 50 years the film has carved out a unique
place for itself as a work of art and a medium of entertain¬
ment, produced not by a lone creator but by a collective
group who number in the hundreds and thousands. Of all
the art forms it is undoubtedly the one that reaches the
largest audience in history.

Emile Reyiiand :
the Walt Disney
of 1892
In the first years of this century, prize-winning
schoolchildren were often rewarded with a toy
which once delighted grown-ups too: the Zoe-
trope. It was a device which looked like a
saucepan mounted on a short pedestal with
regularly spaced slots cut In the sides. Inside
was a paper band with images which broke
down the various stages of an object or person
in motion. When the "saucepan" was spun
round by hand a peep through the slots created
the illusion of movement. The Zoetrope was
thought up in 1834 by a mathematician from
Bristol, England, William Horner, and it was a
great improvement on Plateau's magic disks.
(Photo from the film "Naissance du Cinéma".)
Plateau's device also inspired a German inventor,
Ottomar Anschütz, in 1889, to build his Elec¬
trical Tachyscope, which was one of the great
attractions of the Chicago World's Fair in 1893.
The Tachyscope was an iron wheel worked by
hand which used the flash of an electric tube to
immobilize in appearance a moving image. The
discovery of the value of the flash, which is one
of the fundamental bases of the modern motion
picture projector, was originally made by Sir
Charles Wheatstone of England.
About the same time, a Frenchman, Emile Rey-
naud, became the first moving picture showman
of modern times with his "Theatre Optique" in
Paris. (Photo taken from the film "Naissance
du Cinema") This was the first popular motion
picture theatre but hand-drawn instead of
photographed pictures were used. The draw¬
ings were on celluloid bands whose performances
lasted up to 15 minutes. Between 1892 and
1900, some 500,000 spectators saw Reynaud's
shows (12,800 of them) in the Musée Grevin.
One of the reels was used twice daily for sixty-
two months. Reynaud was an impresario who
stood between the shadow plays and panto¬
mimes of the ancients and the modern cinema.

A century
of clicks
A FAR CRY from the reporter-photographers of 1 874 (shown
above) whose "portable" equipment included a tent, folding table,
chemicals and a massive camera, is the modern amateur photo¬
grapher armed with a pocket-sized apparatus featuring fast lenses,
multiple dials and a host of trick attachments. Photography, once
described as the most typical art of the 20th century, has grown
from the achievements of many men in many countries. Its real
beginnings were in France in the early I 800's when Joseph Nicéphore
Niepce produced on glass an image formed by a camera obscura.
Modern photography, however, began with the "daguerreotype",
produced by Louis Daguerre, a French artist working with Niepce.
It was so successful that a French cartoon soon complained that
half of mankind had become "daguerreocrazed" while the rest was
"daguerreomazed". Everything on sight was caughtfrom Victor
Hugo's hand to the sedate family group. But until well on into the
1 9th century equipment was cumbersome and methods were
complicated. To take his famous American civil war pictures in
the I860's, photographer Matthew Brady required a lumbering
vehicle, nicknamed by soldiers the "What is it waggon".- (Photo
taken from the film "Naissance du Cinéma".)
HAT TRICK CAMERA was one of the novelties that delighted the
growing legion of amateur photographers in 1885. Drawings of
that time suggest the seriousness with which these keen picture
snappers went to work. Despite the handicaps of the early days,
a group of distinguished and devoted amateurs persisted at their
hobby. Among them was the Oxford mathematician Charles
Dodgson (who, as Lewis Carroll, wrote "Alice in Wonderland"),
novelists Charles Kingsley and Samuel Butler, and U.S. Justice, Oliver
Wendell Holmes, who called the camera "a mirror with a memory".

A ^25,000 bet
on a horse
A $25,000 bet on a horse at a racetrack was
responsible for a major event- in the history of
the cinema's beginnings. It led to the first
successful attempt at breaking down- motion
by direct photography. Leland Stanford, rich,
one-time governor of California, made the bet
in 1872 during a dispute as to whether or not
all the legs of a horse running at a full gallop are
off the ground simultaneously. Horsemen were
never entirely satisfied with the way artists had
muybridge painted or drawn horses in motion with their
four legs spread out in a large arch and actually . touching the ground.
He called in an English photographer, Eadweard Muybridge to get pho¬
tographic proof to settle the dispute. Muybridge began work with a
single camera at first but his results were not entirely conclusive.
About 1870 Etienne Marey the great French cinema pioneer had
determined how a horse runs with a recording device attached to its
foot. Drawings made showed that a galloping horse supported itself
on one hoof, then on three, then on two, then on one. But he had
no photographic proof of his findings.
When these drawings reached California some years later, Stanford
could hardly believe them. In 1877 Muybridge and an engineer, John D.
Isaacs, set upa battery of 24 cameras beside a specially re-built racetrack
on Stanford's ranch. From the lens shutters a wire thread was stret¬
ched across the track. As the horse raced by, it broke the thread,
tripping the shutter of each camera in turn. Muybridge thus obtained
the first series of photographs showing a horse in full gallop (photos
top centre).
Marey was delighted to hear of the results of Muybridge's work and
was the first to synthesize motion from the photographs by mounting
them so that the action could be reconstructed. Marey, one of the
first great physiologists, gave a strong impetus to the photographing
and projection of motion pictures through his desire to learn more
about movement, the movement of lifeanimals, birds and men. Muy¬
bridge had photographed his subject on a
white background so that one exposure des¬
troyed the sensitivity of the plate. Using a jet black
background Marey foundthattheonly impression
made at each exposure was the impression of the
model, the rest remaining, black. This enabled
him to take several photographs on the same
plate without any difficulty His famous "Man
in White" (photo bottom left) was taken this
way. Photograph below shows a man's walk as
it was analysed by Marey, in 1882.

### 68943: The Film today: a world picture

The film today
a world picture by James Douglas
Faced 'with ever-inci easing competition from the tele¬
vision screen, films have not yet suffered the
decline which many people forecast a few years
ago. By the use of new techniques, such as cine¬
mascope and by a greater concentration on the pro¬
duction of realistic documentary featurestwo .good
examples are "The Wages of Fear" and "On the Water¬
frontthe world film industry has managed success¬
fully to attract the same millions who have frequented
the cinema in the past.
However, in the field of feature film
production and distribution there
have been some significant changes.
Taking a world view it is abundantly
clear that the U.S.A. still continues to
dominate the motion picture field.
There are few countries today which
do not draw the bulk of the feature
films shown on their screens from
Hollywood. Generally speaking, it
would be true to say that most film
importing countries' in the world
obtain between 50 and 60 % of all
feature films shown in their cinemas
from the U.S.A. The impact on the
minds of millions of people produced
by what Hollywood thinks of history,
art and everyday life remains an
enormously important fact today.
Despite the U.S. predominance there has been, never¬
theless, a noticeable trend towards what might be term¬
ed a decentralization of the film production industry. In
the last few years Asia has come very much to the fore,
and in 1953 Japan produced no less than 302 feature films
some 00 less than the U.S.A. itself, thus jumping
ahead of India which until 1952 was the world's second
largest producer.
The Indian film industry, which is one of the largest
in the world, turned out 259 features in the same year.
Both Japanese and Indian features are now being shown
in European cinemas. One can visit a cinema in Greece,"
for example, and see a Japanese film spoken in Japanese
and carrying Greek sub-titles an unheard of thing a few
years ago. In the Far East the demand for films in Chi¬
nese has remained high, and to cater for this demand the
Hong-Kong film industry has, almost overnight, become
one of the world's largest.
In one three-month period in 1953 the seven film pro¬
duction companies in Hong-Kong made no less than 50
feature films. The year's total came to just over 200.
It cannot be said that Europe has lagged behind in the
production effort, and if the U.S. films shot in European
countries are taken into account (many have been made
in the past three years) Europe is found to be providing
a large proportion of the total world film production.

JAMES DOUGLAS has spent the past 20 years of his life in Infor¬
mation and news services, as editor, writer and journalist. He has
worked with the BBC, the British Foreign Office and the United
Nations. Certain facts and figures in this article will appear later

lie of Germany are the main producing countries but
interesting developments have also taken place in Norway,
Spain, the U.S.S.R., Greece and Turkey.
The Soviet Union has adopted the somewhat revolu¬
tionary step of bringing the entire Soviet .feature film
production output to the television screen. All films made
in the U.S.S.R. are automatically shown on T.V. With
a total of some 700,000 television receivers this may not
have a great effect at the moment, but with the rapid
growth of television the policy- may
have some important long-term con¬
sequences.
In Greece and Turkey there has
been a considerable upsurge in film
production, and the Greek quota has
more than doubled in the past two
years. Turkish studios ,put out some
100 features in 1954. In both coun¬
tries the popularity of the locally-
produced film has tended to diminish
the box office returns on foreign
features : Turkish and Greek cine¬
mas usually play to capacity audi¬
ences when domestic films are being
shown. NoAvay, a country which
until 1953 had made only a very
small number of films, turned out 12
new feature films in 1954. The Nor¬
wegian Government is lending a cer¬
tain amount of assistance to the local film producers and
this also applies in Spain where 44 features were produced
in 1953. Most of these were exported for exhibition in
Latin America.
Apart from films designed for entertainment, newsreels
are now being increasingly produced in Europe. Coun¬
tries such as Hungary, Finland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria,
Switzerland and Yugoslavia all produce their own
newsreels and the erstwhile monopoly of the U.S., French
and British newsreels has declined.
In Latin America there has been little change in film¬
making. Argentina and Mexico still remain the only two
countries turning out large numbers of feature films,
although Brazil has been producing a number of docu¬
mentaries and shorts. Argentina produced 39 features in
1953 and Mexico 99 in 1952. Both countries export most
of their output to the other republics in Central and South
America. One Mexican production, screened during
1954, drew larger audiences than any foreign film shown
in Mexican cinemas a surprising fact when one consi¬
ders the easy availability of U.S. films.
If we turn from film production to film exhibition it
can be a matter of little argument that cinemas generally
have improved, particularly so as regards seating, con¬
struction and visibility. This is pronouncedly the case in
Latin America. Guayaquil may not be a town well-
known to the average person it is in fact Ecuador's chief
port and industrial centre but it is of some interest to
note that a new cinema has just been opened there with
every modern facility and seats for 2,500 people. In
Venezuela 11 new cinemas were opened in 1954, and
owing to the big increase in popularity of European films

Inspired by a photographic revolver (heavier than
a small cannon) Invented by the Norwegian as¬
tronomer Jules Janssen in 1874, Marey devised
his photographic rifle (far left), the world's first
portable motion picture camera. Pressure on
the trigger exposed a series of sensitive plates
in the breech of the rifle and made them rotate.
In this way Marey photographed gulls in motion
(above). Marey also built a zoetrope of his own
(left) in which he replaced the pictures usually
used in this apparatus by models of a gull in
successive stages of flight. When rotated it gave
a perfect illusion of a flight of gulls following each
other round and round in a closed circle.

a Venezuelan cinema- combine will be purchasing 80
European feature films for exhibition in .local cinemas.
In North America the United States has the immense
total of 17,000 permanent cinemas, 4,000 of these are
"drive-ins" where your seat is your motor car. No fewer
than ten million people can be seated at one time in all
U.S. cinemas a staggering figure. However, despite
these large totals some shrinkage has taken place, and
due primarily to increasing competition from TV, some
0,000 cinemas have closed down since 1940. .
On the other side of the 49th parallel 10 million more
Canadians are going to the cinema than was the case four
years ago. Whether this trend will continue in Canada,
where television has spread across the country from east
to west, it is difficult to say. Although Canada imports,
large numbers of U.S. features it also provides the best
overseas market for British films.
In Asia the increase in the number of cinemas has
also been remarkable. Japan has 3,750, India 2,000 and
countries such as Indonesia, Burma and the Philippines
have also shown marked increases. Perhaps, however,
the growth in cinema attendance has been most noti¬
ceable in the smaller territories where only a few years
ago permanent cinemas were a rarity. The Fiji Islands
with 30 cinemas and Guam with 10 are cases in point.
In common With the growth in the number of cinemas. .
in the smaller countries and territories goes the tremen¬
dous increase in the number of films imported. Trinidad
and Puerto Rico, to take two 'examples, both import some
2,000 feature films annually : an amazingly high figure
in relation to the population figures. Another case in
point is Singapore where the cinema attendance rate is
one of the world's highest. Singapore imports upwards
of 700 films annually.
Australia and New Zealand have also seen increases in
cinemas and attendances. By reason of the large influx
of European migrants into the two countries the demand
for the exhibition of European films has enlarged, with
the result that, in a limited manner, there is a new and
active competition to U.S. dominance.
The pattern of film attendance in European countries
has remained relatively stable with the exception of the
U.S.S.R. where latest reports speak of some 31,000 cine¬
mas of all types, with an annual attendance at an.
astronomical 2,000 million. A certain decline in atten¬
dance has been noted in Scandinavia, the Low Countries
and the U.K. In the latter country it is perhaps signi¬
ficant that the number of private cinema owners has
steadily diminished with the result that the great majority
of all U.K-. cinemas are controlled by the large cinema
circuits. Two large groups between them control over
one thousand cinemas.
The question of group cinema control and the conse¬
quent lack of independent choice in the exhibition of films
leads to another important aspect of the film industry :
the realm of the documentary and educational film.
The true documentary film was first conceived in Bri¬
tain in the early thirties by a brilliant group of people
working under Sir Stephen Tallents and John Grierson.
Since that time documentaries have spread throughout
the world and today few film-producing countries do not
make a quota of these films. With spread in production
there has also been a vast increase in exhibition. Britain
could, with justice, still be regarded as the main docu¬
mentary producer but the U.S.Av, Denmark, Canada,
France, the U.S.S.R., Poland and Czechoslovakia also turn
out large numbers. An interesting case is that of Canada
where the documentaries produced by the Canadian Na¬
tional Film Board are dubbed in five different languages
and exported throughout the world.
By means of the mobile film units, educational and
documentary films reach their audiences in the depths of
the jungle and the middle of the desert. In the. Belgian
Congo, Mozambique, the Cameroons and the Sahara the
mobile cinemas find their way into the smallest villages

GEORGE DEMENY, a long associate of Marey was interested in
phonetics and thought the deaf could learn to talk through photos of
speech. He developed the Phonoscope in 1891 decomposing the
movements of speech. (Photo shows him saying "Vive la France.")
It was a modified version of Marey's camera and a dozen other instru¬
ments. Concerned more with education than cinema technique, he
patented it without realizing its importance. He later developed
another camera which eliminated the jerks and tears of the film.
EARLY PANORAMIC SCREENS. The two strange-looking con¬

The Cyclorama (above) by a Chicagoan named Chase was tried out
unsuccessfully in 1894 with a 150-foot circular screen. Mechanism
was on circular platform. The Cineorama (below) a multiple camera
device developed by a Frenchman Grimoin-Sanson two years later had
three performances before it was stopped as a fire hazard at the 1900
Paris Exhibition. Visitors were invited for an imaginary balloon flight
and a real balloon was attached to the platform where several hundred
spectators were grouped in centre of 300-foot circular screen. The
inventor, ruined by the police decision, abandoned the cinema forever

FORGOTTEN SHADOWS (Cont'd)
WORLD'S FIRST FILM STUDIO, known as "Black Maria" because it was painted black inside and out, was
built by Thomas Edison in 1 894. It had revolving base on which it was turned towards sunlight. In this studio
Edison made hundreds of brief films for his Kinetoscope, the first successful moving picture machine marketed
(below). Picture strip shows professional strong man Eugene Sandow displaying muscles for the camera.
The peepshow sensation
on Broadway
Edison came to the motion picture
through his" Talking Phonograph. He
was looking for a device that would
combine the voices of the phonograph
with the sight and movement of a picture.
Late in 1887 Edison started work on
what was to become his Kinetograph
camera and Kinetoscope peepshow film
device. The world premiere took place
on April 14, 1894 at a Kinetoscope
Parlor opened on Broadway in New
York City. The Kinetoscopes were a great success. S 120 was taken
in the first night. The original show of films was a kind of "double
feature" in that the spectator was charged 25 cents to see the second
line of five Kinetoscopes. The films included "Fred Ott's Sneeze" (see
front cover). This was one of the most significant days in cinema
history for it brought the motion picture to the public for the first
time and from Edison's Kinetoscope and his Kinetograph modern .
motion picture devices evolved. Edison was aided in his experiments
by William Laurie Dickson. At first the "Wizard of West Orange"
used coated glass plates and later celluloid for taking pictures.' Then j
in Eastman's flexible film roll he found an ¡deal material. Edison was ;
the first to perforate the two sides of each picture or frame to keep them j
passing evenly through the camera and his perforated film is still used today, j
Edison's first camera was a power-driven machine as heavy as a piano. |
With it he turned out short films, fifty feet of which provided aí
I 3-second show. The Kinetoscope immediately became a world sensa¬
tion. But Cdison at first only developed and exploited his device as a
peep-show machine. Not until April 1896 did he project hjs first
film on a screen publicly. The projector used was developed by a;
Virginian, Thomas Armat, and manufactured by the Edison Company,
which called it the Vitascope. Other inventors patented different projec-
tion machines and for many years a bitter patent war raged betwean
Edison and the rival companies which had by developed by this time.

Th screen s
world premiere :
receipts 33 francs
"At the time when Edison's Kinetoscope began
to arouse public curiosity," wrote Auguste
Lumière in his memoirs, "my brother and I
thought how interesting it would be if we could
project . moving scenes on a screen." The
Lumière brothers, owners of a photographic
materials factory in Lyons, began experimenting
with the idea. In February 1 895, they obtained
a patent on their camera-projector device, the
"Cinématographe Lumière." Ten months later,
on December 28, they gave their first public
projection (admission one franc) in the basement
of the Grand Café in Paris. Only a few dozen
curious people paid to watch the films on the
first day and the receipts amounted to only
33 francs. But word of the spectacle soon
spread through Paris and within a few weeks
the Lumière films were playing to a standing-
room-only audience averaging 2,000 admissions
a day. "The show left us dumbfounded, struck
with amazement," one early spectator wrote.
"At the end of the performance though there
was wild enthusiasm." Thus at last the motion
picture screen was revealed to a large public.
The hesitant steps of the past were now to
become a firm stride as the motion picture
developed In many lands into a great industry.
Photos show Louis and Auguste Lumière, one. of
the Grand Café posters, shots from two of
the early films that they made "A Train
Arrives at Ciotat Station" and "Baby's Meal."

The motion picture industry start¬
ed on its world career as an
entertainment medium with the
presentation of topical events or
what we would today call the newsreel.
The chief aim of the earliest produ¬
cers like Edison, Lumière, Pathe and
Gaumont was in fact to give their
audiences films taken from life, from
everyday events in the street, in .
railway stations and wherever there
was movement or activity.
Thus Lumiere's first films, showing
the arrival of a train and workmen
leaving the factory, were in a sense
newsreel subjects. The first real
newsreel was made by the Lumière
brothers even before they gave their
first public showing in Paris. The
Cinématographe was to be shown at
the Congress of the National Union of
French Photographic Societies in
June of 1895. There the Lumières
created a veritable sensation when
they filmed the delegates arriving for
the opening meeting on June 10, de¬
veloped the film and showed it on a
screen before the conference ended on
June 12.
From this point on it was only a
short step to the regular filming of
topical events, and . film producers
were not slow to take it. On January
5, 1896, the Lumière brothers engaged
an Algerian photographer, Felix Mes-
guich, who was to become the world's
first film reporter. For years he trav¬
elled all over Europe and the rest of .
the world. Other producers followed :
the -Pathe brothers and Léon Gaumont
in France, Oskar Messter in Germany,
Edison and later his rivals the Bio-

graph and Vitagraph companies in the
United States.
By 1897 Biograph and Lumière had
both filmed the Jubilee of Queen
Victoria ; Tilden and Rector in the
U.S.A. the Corbett-Fitzsimmons boxing
match; Pathé the Czar's arrival in
Paris ; and Gaumont the arrival of
the French President. Edwin S. Por¬
ter, the pioneer of the story film and
motion picture editing, was equally
busy at this period with newsreel
shorts (President McKinley's Inaugura¬
tion, McKinley's Funeral Procession,
etc.).
Georges Méliès, the genius who de¬
veloped the film as entertainment, was
also interested in current happenings
but only in order to "reconstruct"
such notable events as the coronation
of Edward VII in 1902. Early film
makers were often compelled to re-
enact news events since the camera in
those days was 'not" admitted every¬
where as it is today.
Thus when the Spanish-American
war broke out in 1898, cameramen
tried to get to the front in Cuba but
were turned back by the military au¬
thorities. Edison, Biograph and others
reconstructed the battle scenes them¬
selves. The most sensational re-
enactment, however, was the accom¬
plishment of Edward H. Amet after the.
Spanish fleet was destroyed. Working
from photographs, he built a plaster
copy of Santiago Bay in the garden of
his villa. Here (not in his bathtub as
is generally supposed) he. placed small,
but exact functioning replicas of the
Spanish and American armadas and
filmed the battle in all its detail. The
completed film had such tremendous
success that the Madrid Government
even bought a copy for its military
archives. This same Amet again
created a sensation by staging on
waste ground in Brooklyn realistic
battle scenes from the Boer War
which broke out almost immediately
after the Spanish-American war.
An important event for the future
of motion picture photography came
with the introduction of artificial
lighting. Newsreel producers were
responsible for it. On November 3,
1899, the Jeffries-Sharkey boxing
match was held at -the Coney Island
Club in Brooklyn, The Biograph
company obtained the exclusive film
rights for this event and installed a
battery of 400 arc lamps in the hall.
(They gave off such heat that at the
end of each of the 35 rounds the
boxers had to seek cover under a pa¬
rasol!) Rival Vitagraph technicians
though were hidden in the audience
and as the fight began they cranked
their film by the light of the lamps,
protecting themselves with "shock
troops". Both films were great
successes financially but the Biograph
attained a record for the longest film
made in the 19th century (5,575 feet).
In the early days of the cinema, the
news was not presented as it is today
in -journal form. Until about 1907,
cinema programmes were made up of
comic, dramatic or news shorts. At
first their maximum length . was 65
feet but gradually increased. (A five-
minute film needs a minimum of 4,800
images.) The exhibition of films was
mostly in the hands of travelling
showmen; films were not rented as
they are now but sold to exhibitors
who screened the prints until they
were worn out.
The birth of the .first newsreel
journals coincided with two revolu¬
tionary changes in the industry. One
was the change-over from travelling
shows to permanent halls where,
since the audience remained largely
the same, the programme had to be
renewed frequently. The other change¬
over was from outright sale to film-
renting. This occurred sometime
around 1905 in the United States, and
around 1907 in France. Also in 1907
Charles Pathé created his Journal. He
was followed in 1908 by Léon Gau¬
mont and the Société Eclair. In 1909
the Pathé brothers went to London
and pioneered newsreels there with
Pathé Gazette.
The modern newsreel was born. It
remained as a branch of film produc¬
tion and kept growing steadily, first
with the advent of "talkies" and now
with television.

GAG KING of early comedy producers In the U.S. was
Mack Sennett who sometimes appeared in his own films. In
"Murphy's I.O.U." he here plays the part of a waiter.
In the first two decades of the twentieth
century many new cinema pioneers took
over the development of the film from
those who had discovered how to make
moving pictures, and began a great era of
search and endeavour.
In France the work of George Méliès
permanently enriched the technique and
scope of filmmaking by introducing it to
fancy and to fantasy and by forcing it to
tell a story. Méliès was the first to create
visual illusions on the screen, and in 1900
he made the first series of fairy tale subjects
which embodied a rich succession of trans¬
formations, tricks, fantasies and illusions.
His most famous picture "A Trip to the
Moon" was made in 1902 and his last "big"
film "The Conquest of the Pole" in 1912.
During this period, a flexible form of narra¬
tive film was shaping in America, In whose
development one man, David Wark Griffith,
stands out above all others. In 1915 his civil
war epic "The Birth of a Nation" established
him as the foremost U.S. producer. Still
more important, the film induced millions of
people to take the cinema seriously. Another
American producer, Mack Sennett, became
the master of film comedy. His use of gags,
slapstick and unexpected situations revealed
rich sources of humour.
Thus, after its primitive, hesitant begin¬
nings, the cinema industry quickly expanded
and its enormous entertainment possibilities
and popular appeal were firmly established. CINEMA "TRICKS "WERE FIRST DEVISED AND

### 68945: Dreaming with eyes wide open

DREAMING
with eyes
wide open
by W. D. Wall
From its earliest beginnings, the cinema has been feared
as potentially the most universal and powerful means
of mass influence. It has only recently been replaced
as the bogey of the moralists and educators by the
latest form of popular entertainmenttelevision.
Much the same note of angry alarm was struck by hostile
critics of the drama in 17th-century England and else¬
where, and in the 19th century by those who disapproved
of illustrations m newspapers. Jeremy Collier slated the
dramatists of the Restoration in his "Short view of the
Profaneness and Immorality of the "English Stage" and
Wordsworth wrote an indignant sonnet on "the vile abuse
of pictured page" saying that "discourse once deem'd man's
noblest attribute" would die under its influence.
In spite of the indictments of the moralists, the general
public continues to regard the cinema primarily as a dis¬
traction just as it has accepted the theatre and the illus¬
trated newspaper.
The surprising thing is that relatively very little is known
in any objective or scientific way about the influence which
the cinema exerts or the daily lives of people. Yet this is a .
fascinating field of study which leads right to many of the
most important psycho) ^gical and social problems of modern
man and his society. Much has indeed been written and
said. on the economic, social and cultural influences which
appear to operate in the production of a particular film or
which govern the choice and handling of themes by sections
of the industry.
Many have speculated on the way the cinema makes
people more or less contented with their lot, acts as an
excitant to crime, influences the purchase of clothes, motor¬
cars or refrigerators. Apart from the work of a handful of
social scientists in Europe and North America, such pro¬
nouncements are relatively partisan, concerned with attack¬
ing or defending the cinema industry. Few have recognized
the cinema as probably neither good nor bad in itself, but as
at once a shaping force and a symptom of the age and
culture which have given birth to it.
For want of objective studies we cannot even answer _such
a simple question as "Is this a good film for children?"
In spite of great technical improvements, the progress of
the cinema as an aesthetic, educative and recreational
medium is at the mercy of trial and error. This may be
excellent when it is the product of genius; and when cir¬
cumstances as for example in the 17th-century drama, in
England or France permit the inspiration of the drama¬
tist to dominate his medium and to know his audience. In
modern film production, however, circumstances are entirely
different. A film is a collective phenomenon resulting from
Dr. W.D. Wall, psychologist and educator, has devoted many
years to research in Great Britain on the reactions to films of
children and adults. He is the author of " The Adolescent Child ",
and numerous studies and articles on this question.
an only partly controlled inter-play between producer,
author, cast and a multitude of technicians.
Moreover, the lack of continuity in the actual production,
the isolation of the film-making community from daily
contact with its audience an isolation which is as much
economic as geographical is likely to emphazise the ele¬
ments of collective fantasy and remoteness from daily
reality, without permitting an individual genius to dominate
and refine them into a work of art.
Another circumstance of fundamental importance, psy¬
chologically and socially, is that of all forms of expression,
the film is the one most capable of producing illusion and
the least dependent upon an active, imaginative effort in
the spectator. The fancies which for long have charmed or
terrified the imagination of mankindghosts, fairies, flying
spirits, giants,
witches, the ma¬
terialization and
the dematerial-
ization of "solid"
human beings,
magical transfor¬
mations of the
physical environ¬
ment can be
reproduced with
an actuality far
outstripping the
limitations of the
stage or of life
itself. Films make
the most dream¬
like events seem
real and can up¬
set all the phy¬
sical laws or laws
of consistency of
character which
actually operate
in the real and
everyday world.
Most of us unconsciously or subconsciously are haunted
by. "magical" wishes, fears and anxieties which rise to the
surface usually only in moments of fatigue or in dreams.
Much of the appeal of art is to these at best barely conscious
aspects of our emotional lives. At least some of the pleasures
of literature and of the theatre are those which arise from
the stimulation of fantasy and day-dreams. But the printed
page, the illustration, even the actors on a stage, are
sufficiently remote from actuality for us nearly always to be
aware of the gulf.
The darkened cinema, and the moving shadows cunningly
contrived may produce a situation akin to that between
sleeping and awaking. Thus the instinctive elements upon

which our emotional life is deeply based such as fear, erotic
desire, self-assertion, aggressiveness and the like may be
directly stimulated without our realizing that what we are
seeing on the screen is not really true.
It is perhaps in this peculiar combination of the circum¬
stances of film production and of an almost direct appeal .
to mental activity below the level of consciousness, that
we have the central problem of the cinema and of its social
influence. It is one of the most difficult to investigate
directly, though attempts have been made by a series of
indirect approaches.
We know, for example, that cinema audiences' in England
and probably elsewhere in Europe are not a represen¬
tative cross section of the population: they are in fact a
psychologically more vulnerable group. Adolescents of both
sexes and young men and women-attend more frequently
than married couples ; the peak of attendance is between
the ages of 16 and' 19. It has therefore been argued that
the plots chosen and treated by producers are directed to
the needs and wishes of an audience which is not fully
mature.
It has, however, also been pointed out that the composition
of the audience might be changed if films stressed different
aspects of life. This might well be so, though it is not quite
as simple as it
seems since other
factors play a part
in cinema attendan¬
ce. We know that
attendance at the
cinema tends to
rise when people
are emotionally dis¬
turbed, as they
were during the
war ; maladjusted
and unhappy indi¬
viduals go more
frequently than the
average; and, among
English adolescents
at least, attendance
among the less in¬
telligent students is
higher than among
older and more able
groups.
More striking still
perhaps is the fact
that among children .
and adolescents over the age of ten roughly three-quarters
go to the cinema at least once a week, and about a quarter,
as much as twice to four or even six times weekly. Figures
for adult attendance are more difficult to obtain but it
seems probable that, of city and town dwellers, about half
go habitually once a' week ; and relatively few do not go
at all.
Such a level of attendance must mean that sooner or later
every film generally released in a country will be seen by
the majority of the young adult population. Such conti¬
nuous exposure, to a large number of films often without
any discrimination being exercised is worth examining.
Between 1945 and 1949, I personally carried out a series
of investigations on the psychological effects of the cinema
on children. In the course of one study, I had to see and
analyze some 30 films, in a 14-day period. My attention was
thus concentrated upon the plots and incidents of each film.
In spite of this! at the end of the period I could recall little
except isolated images and occasional incidents. I couldn't
remember the titles or even the stories. It may be that, for
the frequent filmgoer, the immediate distraction is all, and
nothing remains. The film passes like a dream.
That this is not wholly true is shown by a curious pheno¬
menon first pointed out by an investigation made with
educational films in the thirties. It was noticed that when
children wrote essays about what they had seen, their
descriptions were episodic and tied to particular striking
images ; there was more detail and less generalization or
logical continuity. The same kind of result occurred in writ
ings by adolescents in 1947 on "My favourite film." Certain
vivid incidents, appealing to such emotions as fear, self-
assertion, sex, sympathy for others, stood out, whilst the
plot may have been forgotten or misunderstood.
Yet in many subtle ways these general themes may rein- '
force or counteract the attitudes of the spectators. In the
writings of adolescents and even in those of adults there
is a strong tendency to identify oneself with the hero or
heroine or with one of the characters portrayed. Sometimes
the identification is with the star rather than with the part
played, or with the attributes like physical beauty, wealth,
ability to ride a horse, travel or with the sex role played
vis-à-vis another star. Such identification, especially among
the immature, may well lead to an acceptance of certain
implied moral values of a particular pattern of behaviour
and of attitudes towards others and to life in general.
' Analyzing the various plots and the values which films
portray may therefore give us an important clue to the way
the cinema industry may be shaping our communities.
Several such analysis were undertaken from the mid-
nineteen-thirties until the immediate post-war years. In
general the result is what might be expected. Films on city
life predominate and deal with people in a slightly higher
social or financial bracket than the one most audiences
belong to. Over half
the leading charac¬
ters are cast in roles
that are . egoistic
and, in some cases,
morally doubtful if
not frankly hostile
or contemptuous of
society. The love
themes which pre¬
dominate accentuate
physical attraction
ât the expense of
mutual understand¬
ing and friendship.
Very few films,
proportionately, deal
in any deep or pe¬
netrating way with
the great social,
moral or interna¬
tional problems of
our time or tend
to provoke serious
thought : and rare
indeed are those
which do not finally preach some rather banal philosophy
of contentment with things as they are.
One is however moved to ask whether the cinema is any
different in this respect from the stage or from the general
run of printed matter in this or any other age. All tend
to reflect popular thinking and popular values ; they also
tend to hold a slightly distorting mirror up to nature and
to emphasize some aspects at the expense of others, In the
case of the cinema, at least, the pertinent criticism is not
that it depraves and corrupts but that it does not edify.
Does the audience, however, merely accept passively the
values and attitudes that are presented on the screen ? As
far as adolescents are concerned and they are the most
impressionable group the answer is that they do not.
In a study of a dozen films of the usual types, I found that
boys and girls between thirteen and sixteen exercized con¬
siderable discrimination. Films like Odd Man Out, The Root
of all Evil, The Green Years and Razor's Edge were con¬
sidered by some two-thirds of nearly a thousand boys and
girls to be true to life a judgment with which in a gene¬
ral sense, one must concur.
Other films like Monsieur Beaucaire, Time of their lives,
Kid from Brooklyn, were enjoyed but not taken seriously
or considered true to life. Uncertainties arise over, .films
like The Magic Bow a romanticized and not very accurate
biography of Paganini. It seems to be true to say that when
adolescents and young adults are presented with situations
and circumstances which they can compare with their own
experience they do draw a distinction between the fantasy

CHINESE ARTISTS
2,000 YEARS AGO
Theypaintedwith
knife and brush
by Chou Ling
TWO thousand years ago the Chinese developed an
unusual form of art. They engraved paintings
directly on stone. From this ancient art another
evolved, called stone "rubbings" which achieved
exquisite, highly delicate results on paper and silk. Since
little of this art is known outside of China, Unesco has
prepared a travelling exhibition containing high-fidelity
reproductions of 20 of these stone paintings and rubbings
as well as 40 other masterpieces in colour of ancient
Chinese painting. Making the reproductions was such
exacting and delicate work that it took a Parisian publisher
(Editions Euros) eight years to complete the job. Works
originally painted on silk were reproduced on silk. The
originals were collected from museums the world over
including the Chinese Government Museum, Tokyo Mu¬
seum, the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, the British Museum,
the Musée Guimet in Paris and the National Museum
in Stockholm. Twenty identical sets of Unesco's exhi¬
bition, entitled "Two Thousand Years of Chinese Painting",
are now beginning a world tour of Unesco member coun¬
tries. They will be displayed in art galleries, museums
and centres for youth and workers groups in rural and
urban areas. The UNESCO COURIER has asked Dr.
Chou Ling, art historian, critic and lecturer, who has
devoted the past 15 years to the colour reproduction of
Chinese paintings, to describe his country's stone gravings
and a few other aspects of ancient Chinese art.
EAGLE. CARVED STONE PAINTING OF THE HAN
Many are the paths that lead to
beauty. The Greeks, in the
time of Pericles, chose that of
sculpture and . found their
ideal artistic expression in the art of
stone-carving-. The Hindus, with
Iheir lofty sense of religion, preferred
the spiritual path and achieved their
closest approach to beauty through
mysticism. The Chinese, who tended
towards abstract thought, have from
their earliest times been charmed by
pictorial art.
This choice is no accident. Paint¬
ing, which is to some extent abstract,
lias an extraordinary power of sug¬
gestion and description. Form and
movement can be expressed in a few
firm, lively strokes. To depict the
three-dimensional world on a flat'
surface is no matter of accident
either it is merely one of those
human possibilities which the Chi¬
nese regard as a kind of discovery,
and the secret of which they long
kept to themselves.

PERIOD (206 B.C-220 A.D.). PROCESSION OF CHARIOTS. A RUBBING NOW IN SZECHWAN PROVINCIAL MUSEUM.
The distant origins of Chinese
painting are known to us chiefly,
from written descriptions, for the
works themselves have perished.
The engraved bones, the prehistoric
pottery, and the decoration of the
bronze objects of the Chou period
-(400 B.C.) already reveal the existence
of considerable pictorial skill among
the Chinese; but in painting, the
most striking evidence is provided by
an important group of engraved
stones belonging to the Han period
(206 B.C. 220 A.D.).
These are tombstones or funerary
monuments, and the process is a
kind of engraved painting. They are
not bas-reliefs, as might be supposed;
they are reaf paintings, in which the
feeling for composition and the pic¬
torial sense are fully evident. Only
instead of using a brush, the Chinese
of that period preferred to engrave
^their compositions directly on the
stone with. a knife.

THEY PAINTED WITH
KNIFE AND BRUSH
(Continued)
Later on, a method of "pressing" was invented. in
China, making it possible to take a kind of rubbing of
these sculptural compositions and transfer them direct
onto paper. As a result, these engraved paintings
reached a wide public as the centuries went by and had
an undoubted influence on painting itself.
These engraved stones were particularly numerous
in three large districts the provinces of Chang-Tong.
Honan and Szechwan. They deal with a wide variety
of subjects, including scenes of domestic life, hunting,
palace life, battle, and entertainments (both popular and
ritual). Throughout the different regions and epochs,
they preserve a most remarkable similarity of style;
they are free and direct in expression, full of move¬
ment, and often convey a feeling of great liveliness.
The earliest actual paintings which have come down
to us date from the fourth century A.D. Reaching the
Tang period (018-907), we find in the towns along the
Western frontier, on the borders of Central Asia, a
precious store of frescoes which are still preserved in
certain Buddhist caves. These frescoes convey valuable
information to art historians, for they reveal the
influence of Indian and Persian painting. This was the
period immediately following the introduction of Bud¬
dhism into China, when certain monks made long
journeys from China to India or from India to Central
China, fostering, in their comings and goings, a wide
interchange of artistic knowledge between China and
the other countries of Asia.
Aller these transitional years, the Sung period (900-
1270), during which China established its aesthetic
criteria, began to work out its own laws of beauty. This
period produced many admirable pictorial works in
Chinese ink touched up with gouachemisty land¬
scapes, restrained and rapidly executed portraits, and
delicate, elegant, thought-provoking drawings. It was
at this juncture that Chinese painting- took the final
form which it retained for nearly a thousand years,
until modern times. It is notable for its lyricism,
naturalistic style and quality of line. It also reveals
a unique concept of painting, volume being rendered
solely by means of very firm outline, with no shadows
to destroy the- ethereal effect of the painted surface.
These characteristics of the great Sung period have
persisted, despite the various changes of style which
occurred during the Yuan period which succeeded it
(1276-1368)when China, under Mongol domination,
developed a keen interest in hunting scenes and the
beauty of horsesand the subsequent Ming period
(1308-1644), which saw a deliberate return to the strictly
Chinese manner and an attempt to recover the earlier
highly stylized and calligraphic form of beauty.
Not until fairly recently did Chinese art begin to be
known in other countries. From the eighteenth century
onwards, missionaries began to spread a knowledge of
it in Europe and America, and there was a vogue for
minor works of artengraved stones or embroideries,
decorated with fantastic beasts or flowers. Only at
the beginning of the present century did further
research lead to the discovery that Chinese art had more
subtle and more powerful aspects ; and today we
realize that, through all the stimulating variations of
its two-thousand-year history, it has preserved a unity
of style and an aesthetic aim which is peculiar to the
Chinese people.

inches in height, while the giant
Brobdingnagians were 60 feet tall.
Since then, modern Gullivers have
been exploring and measuring Lilli¬
putian worlds a million million times
smaller and giant Worlds many,
billions of times larger.
These figures stagger the imagi¬
nation. What, we may ask, can
man actually measure that is so
incredibly tiny, or so immense ?
ALAIN GILLE Is the Unesco specialist who
planned and prepared the travelling science
exhibition described in this article eis well as
others organized by Unesco, now touring
member states throughout the world.

At the smallest end of the scale of
measurement, exploring within the
atom, man has measured, the dia¬
meter of elementary particles such as
the proton. In the world of the
infinitely; great he has measured the
distance to the remotest galaxy ol
stars known today.
Nowadays, we know that many
animals have some knowledge of size
and distance. When a hermit crab,
for example, outgrows its shell
"hideout" and looks around for
a larger home, it prospects a new
shell by exploring it all over with its
claws and feelers. Only when it is
satisfied with the dimensions does it
"try on" the new shell for size.
But this is a confused sort of
knowledge. While there are many
kinds of animals capable of counting,
there is not one which has the idea
of measuring or of systematically
placing the living creatures and
things around it in their proper
relationship to one another.
It was when our ancestors learned
to measure things around them that
they Were better able to cope with
life. And they learned to measure
things as we do today by comparing
them with other lengths which they
took as standards or units. The first
such units were derived from things
with which man was most familiar:
the foot, the inch (from the thumb tip
to the. first joint), the cubit (derived

the distance from a man's elbow to
the tip of his middle finger), and
others. The Egyptians used the
outstretched arms as a unit, and the
Greeks the length of a stadium (about
007 feet).
With his senses alone, man could
explore only a tiny fraction of the
universe. But, using his intellect, he
has designed and built tools and
instruments 'which have taken him
far beyond the world directly acces¬
sible to his senses. Willi their help
he has carried his investigations into
the realm both of the infinitely
small ' and of the infinitely large.
During his search for new know¬
ledge he has discovered unsuspected
marvels that have enriched his ideas
of the world, and in this process he
has developed new means with
which to transform his existence.
Exploring tiny specks
Until the 17lh century, when the
magnifying glass and the mi¬
croscope were invented, man
had practically no other instrument
for studying the infinitely small.
The lower limit of his universe was
the power of his own eye, i.e. its
capacity to distinguish two dots about
one-tenth of a millimetre (three,
thousandth's of an inch) apart, and
placed about ten inches from the
' eye.
With this human limitation it was
as if the entire world had been pass¬
ed through a sieve having a mesh of
one-tenth of a millimetre. Then,
suddenly, the new optical instruments
enabled man to peer into a mysterious
realm the "microscopic world"
and led him to the discovery of cells
and microbes, and thus to the proof
that-life also existed on this new and
tinier scale. With improvements in
the new research tools scientists
using the optical microscope even¬
tually were able to distinguish two
points 0.0001 mm apart the meshes
of the sieve had come a thousand
times closer together.
About two decades ago came ano¬
ther great advance the invention
of the electron microscope. With
this powerful instrument it was pos¬
sible to distinguish two points a mil¬
lionth of a millimetre apart. Thus
the meshes of the sieve had closed in
a further hundred times, and science
made a fine haul, bringing in viruses
the simplest form of life we know
and large organic molecules.
Then the discovery that X-rays' dif¬
fract (break up) on crystals brought
atoms into the microscopic instru¬
ment "net". Atoms were found to
be arranged in regular geometrical
patterns inside molecules, some ten
millionths of a millimetre apart. On
this level of the microscopic world
no form of life was found.
The achievement of measuring dis¬
tances between atoms in molecules
and crystals encouraged scientists to
accept the next challenge how to
measure the distances between the
particles which make up the atoms
themselves. Science and technology,
showing themselves equal to this
challenge, produced new instru¬
ments. One of these was the Wil¬
son Cloud chamber (a device which
makes it possible to see and photo¬
graph the path of electrically charged
particles). Another was the Geiger-
Muller counter which detects and
counts elementary particles emitted
by radio-active substances.
Now the meshes of the sieve had
become a million times more closely-
knit than before, catching elementary
particles electrons, protons and
.neutrons and giving man power¬
ful aid in his efforts to learn all the
basic secrets of matter.
Primitive man had a limited sense
of great distances. His life was.
taken up with the search for food.
For him major distances were those
which took him to the limits of his
hunting-ground. Bis life was a
two-dimensional one. Sometimes
he must have looked up at the night
sky to admire the stars, and wonder¬
ed how far a\vay they were. But
to know how distant an object is one
has to be able to reach it ; and primi¬
tive man's only means of reaching
skywards was to climb trees. He
therefore concluded that all heavenly^
bodies Were the same distance away,
from him.
This view prevailed until the 0th
century B.C. Then the Ancient
Greeks made two important measure-
ments: the circumference of the
Earth and .the distance from the Earth
to the Moon. Their other measure¬
ments, however, were little more than
imaginative inventions. It was Co¬
pernicus in the 10th century who first
worked out the exact order of distri¬
bution and distances of the main pla¬
nets.
Reaching for the stars
The invention of the telescope, in
1 the 17th century, gave man a
powerful instrument to reach
beyond the limits of this visual
capacity. Until then, astronomers
had only studied the planetary
system. But with the 18th century,
scientists began to take an active
interest in the stars, and devised
techniques and instruments for
measuring their dimensions and dis¬
tances method of trigono¬
metric parallaxes, the spectrophoto-
metric method and others. In 1838,
just over a hundred years ago, the
first stellar distance was measured
that of Star 01 from Cygnus (11

world of the screen and the realities of their own lives.-
But when the realism of the screen bears upon something
beyond their experience, they either reject it entirely as
fantastic or untrue as is occasionally the case with pictures
of rather luxurious American lifeor their judgment is
uncertain.
We may also ask how far films arouse discontent and
longings which in the nature of things cannot usually be
satisfied. It is often alleged that, for adolescents at least,
the highly coloured world of the film makes life seem
wanting in excitement and makes them long for more
money. My personal findings show that rather less than
one-third of the group I studied felt that their own lives
were dull by comparison and only about one in twenty
acknowledged a longing for more money. Certain films,'
however, are an exception. The Outlaw (Jane Russell) a
western with a strongly erotic and sensual theme, made
half the boys and three-quarters of the girls who saw it
find their own lives dull ; and in other ways it appeared to
have a very powerful effect on their emotional life.
The principal effects, however, at least of the twelve films
I studied, all of which were at the time extremely popular,
seem to be laughter and a relatively enduring happiness and
satisfaction ; and the consensus of opinion of the adolescent
audience was that the forces of good win in the end.
Another way of estimating the possible influence of the
cinema is to study its impact on people's behaviour. Do
films influence the ways people talk and dress, the kind of
amusements they seek, the way women do their hair or use
cosmetics? Direct and indirect influences here are exceed¬
ingly difficult to disentangle.
Such scanty evidence as we have suggests that for
adolescents and particularly for girls, the cinema provides
a school of manners, deportment and style, which they
knowingly try to imitate. Nearly half a representative
group of boys admit that ways of talking, of amusing them¬
selves, hair style and techniques of approach to the opposite
sex, are the things they imitate most. On the whole more
girls than boys admit to being deeply influenced by the
cinema. Between two-thirds and four-fifths of the group
of adolescent girls studied in the course of personal investi¬
gations admitted to being influenced by the screen in making
up their faces, doing their hair and dressing themselves.
According to nearly six out of every ten of those questioned,
ways of talking and of dancing are imitated too. As with

the boys, one-third of girls admit that their "ways of making
love' are also modelled on what they see on the screen.
As youth grows out of adolescence into man and woman¬
hood, however, the cinema's influence is balanced by other
things ; reasonably happy and satisfied adults recognize
the gulf there is between the realities of their own lives
and the world of the screen." Nevertheless, some aspect of
a film "can affect an individual spectator more deeply even
than he may realize himself and the continual presentation
of slightly displaced values may have a cumulative effect.
Within certain limits, we tend to find in any film the
things we look for, be it consciously or otherwise ; and at
least some of the pleasure a film gives us comes from the
fact that it mirrors and excites our wishes and desires. If
this is so, then the cinema's influence upon us and upon
our lives will be limited to intensifying and shaping what is
already there, at least in a latent form. The spectator is
not in fact passive ; far from it. The fact, however, that
the film relies primarily upon the large projected image ;
that it takes place in a darkened auditorium; and that
rapid visual stimulation coupled with relaxed physical
comfort closely resembles the conditions which induce
hypnosis, probably means that its emotional appeal is more
primitive, direct and effective than that of any other
medium. Few films arouse conscious effort from the
.spectator. Hence even when a film or an incident in a film
is not understood, a subconscious meaning may well be
conveyed. One may even reject a film's message and yet
accept at least some of its meanings subconsciously.
It is in some of these senses that films may be held
responsible for juvenile delinquency or even adult crime.
Probably no one who is well-balanced emotionally has ever
been driven to crime by a film. On the other hand, persons
with delinquent tendencies springing from deep, emotional
and social maladjustments find immediate motives and the
means to crime in particular sequences of a film. Less
dramatically and probably more commonly, films may tend
to reinforce maladjusted tendencies in those who are already
unbalanced.
Enough has been said to indicate some at least of the
problems raised in the mind of a psychologist by the cinema
and the fact of almost universal attendance by children,
adolescents and adults alike. Mr. Everyman takes his flicks
as a harmless entertainment. They probably are for the
most part. Nevertheless, as well as giving entertainment,
they may be deeply shaping the society we live in; on the
other hand, they may merely be a reflexion of the way^it is
developing. The cinema industry could be a greater force
for good or for ill if more were known about the psychology
of the spectator and of the particular mechanism of his
response to the films he sees.
Here then is a vast field of research on which only the
merest and most superficial start has been made. The most
important questions are still untouched, and have been for
the past fifty years or so since the first public cinema halls
were opened.

### 68943: The Film today: a world picture

Unesco Courier. Nr 1. 1955
Letters to the Editor...
Sir,
In my double capacity as Inspector-
General of Penal Institutions of Argen¬
tina and Professor of Penology at the
National Penitentiary Training School,
I have read from cover to cover your
Human Rights issue of the Unesco
Courier devoted to the prevention
of crime and the treatment of delin¬
quents... In your notes on the Seven
Apostles of Prisoners Rights, Spain is
represented by Manuel Montesinos who
you say lived in the 19th century but
you give no exact dates... Don Manuel
de Montesinos y Molina was born in
the city of San Roque near Gibraltar in
1792 and died on 3 July, 1862. A bio¬
graphy of his life by José Rico de
Estasen ("Colonel Montesinos - A Spa¬
niard of European Prestige") was pu¬
blished in Madrid in 1948.
J. Carlos Garcia Básalo.
Inspector-General
of Penal Institutions
Argentina.
Sir,
Although my sympathies are firmly
with Unesco, I have not renewed my
subscription to the Unesco Courier
because most of its articles seem too
impersonal and too "restained" to
arouse any deep interest despite the
great competence of the authors.
I am not the only one to voice this
criticism a friendly one, however
regarding the Unesco Courier and
other Unesco publications. Perhaps
this shortcoming is unavoidable in a
publication aimed at a wide public
whose opinions are manifold and often
contradictory.
Pierre Burney.
French Institute.
Athens, Greece, .
Sir, , '
You and your staff are certainly to
be congratulated on the issue of the
Unesco Courier devoted to crime and
justice. Of all of the recent publica¬
tions in the popular press on this to¬
pic, I have found yours to be the most
informative and boldest in conception.
The article by Carlo Levi is particularly
to be stressed for its magnificent state¬
ment of the necessity to distinguish
between the manifest improvements in
penology and the basic and continuing
disposition of society.
The Marquis de Sade was, I think,
the first to understand this distinction,
and I flatter myself that in my book
"Stone Walls and Men", Odyssey Press,
1946, this point was central to my
thesis.
As one familiar in this field, I was
rather disappointed in the articles by
Dr. J.R. Rees and Sir Cyril Burt. It
seems to me that neither of these
gentlemen properly understands the re¬
lationship . between the phenomenon of
delinquency and the current stage of
civilization. Did they do so, they would
not be able to write so glibly of "cau¬
sative" superficialities : it is only in
relation to the world scene that the
tendency toward violence among youth
everywhere can be ' apprehended. Ne¬
vertheless, my congratulations for an
exceedingly well-done job.
Dr. Robert Lindner.
Baltimore 2,
Maryland.
Sir,
It was extremely gratifying to read
the excellent article "Biting The Hand
That Feeds Us" in the Unesco Cou¬
rier (Nos 4-5, 1954), stressing the need
for wise use and protection of our na¬
tural .resources, on the principle that
we must live in harmony with nature,
rather than combat her. Many believe
that human survival on this planpt is
predicated on that philosophy.
We were pleased also to read the fine
tribute paid to the International Union
for the Protection of Nature. Unesco
may well be proud of the Iupn for it
was founded under the aegis of Unesco,
and is one of the most practical and
productive of international organiza¬
tions. The National Parks Association
is proud of its membership in the
Union.
One of the captions stimulates a com¬
ment. There is a common impression
that the solution to water __ problems
is basically to impound water, either
on the mainstreams or on the tribu¬
taries. That experience in the United '
States has taught us that such dams
may do serious harm to paramount va¬
lues, unless they are carefully planned
to co-ordinate with related programmes
of upland soil control, wise agricultural
practices, sound forestry, and watershed
and wildlife protection. Too much of
our water development programme has
been based on engineering considera¬
tions alone, with no attempt to study
the ecology of the drainage basin as a
whole.
Fred M. Packard.
Executive Secretary,
National Parks Association,
Washington, D.C., U.S.A.
Sir,
In the article on "The Translating
Machine" published in 1954, Dr. Leon
Dostert is described as "one of the
experts particularly responsible for set¬
ting up the "simultaneous translation
system now currently used by interna¬
tional organizations."
I think it might interest your readers
to know that the simultaneous transla¬
tion system to which you refer has been
used since 1924 by the International
Labour Organization, whose permanent
secretariat is the International Labour
office in Geneva, at the plenary sessions
of its annual conferences.
The initiative for using, this system
belongs to Mr. E.A. Pilene, of Boston,
U.S.A. whose financial aid enabled the
first experiments to be made during the
International Labour conferences in
Geneva in 1924/25. By 1928 regular use
of the system was being made at all ses¬
sions of the Conference held in
Geneva.
When the League of Nations head¬
quarters was built in Geneva in 1936 it
was equipped, at the request of the
I.L.O., with a simultaneous translation
system which is still used for the annual
sessions .of the International Labour
Conference and the World Health
Assembly.
These facts in no way diminish the
credit due to Dr. Dostert in connection
with the wider adoption of the system
which has become a basic condition for
the . smooth working of international
conferences in view of the increased
number of languages now employed.
Henri Reymond.

Labour Office,

Sir,
What makes your magazine really
interesting to follow is that it deals
with essentially human questions at an
international level. I find it full of
interest and consider the cost of sub¬
scription a reasonable one... Nothing
but benefit can come from reading an
international publication so unswerving¬
ly concerned with man and his rights.
I shall do my best to introduce the
Unesco Courier to others.
Max Vialis.
Ecole de Maubec,
Vaucluse, France.
Sir,
The Unesco Courier is an unequalled
pocket battleship of international cul¬
tural activity and goodwill. It stimu¬
lates readers to seek more understand¬
ing of other people, and our almost cli¬
nical impatience towards anything that
is strange to our way of life becomes
amended in exact ratio to our increased
knowledge. Every home is poorer that
is without it.
Oscar Edwards.
Sydney, Australia.
The fililí today (Continued from page 14)
and bring the film to millions every year. What is true
for Africa is also true for Asia and the Americas. China,
for example, has 1,200 teams touring the villages in the
interior of the country and giving educational film shows
before audiences. which may vary from a hundred or so
to a thousand. Afghanistan has just purchased three of
these mobile cinemas which carry out similar tasks in the
remote mountain villages.
In the last few years the educational film has become
an accepted part of the school curriculum in most coun¬
tries. In thousands of schools in Europe, Asia and the
Americas the film is an. integral part of the weekly work
in the classroom. Let us take one example which is in
its way typical of hundreds of others. The Latin Ame¬
rican Republic of. Peru has, since 1947, distributed. 150.
10 mm sound projectors to Peruvian primary and secon¬
dary schools throughout the country. In 1953 the number
of schools performances given amounted to 018 and the
number of pupils who attended to 128,000. There can be
little doubt that the effect of a new educational medium
on these 128,000 Peruvian scholars has been considerable.
From entertainment to education the world of the film'
has many facets. As the industry continues to progress
it must at the same time submit to change. These chan¬
ges are seen today in the shift in production emphasis
from the U.S.A. to Asia and Europe ; the evolution of new
techniques in the U.S.A. itself and the practically unli¬
mited spread of entertainment and educational films
throughout every part of the globe. The final challenge
of television may still lie in the future, but in the mean¬
time entertainment for the majority of the world's popu¬
lation means in simple terms "a visit to the flicks".

From the Unesco Newsroom...
UNESCO EXECUTIVE APPOINTED
Dr. Malcolm Adiseshiah, of India, be¬
came Assistant Director-General of
Unesco in January 1955. His appoint¬
ment followed that of M. René Maheu,
of France to a similar post in July 1954.
Dr. Adiseshiah ' previously directed
Unesco's world-wide technical assistance
operations. He will now co-ordinate the
organization's entire programme, but
will' act as special technical aid adviser
to the Director-General, and as repre¬
sentative to other U.N. Agencies.
Born in Madras in 1910/ Dr. Adises¬
hiah studied at Madras University, the
London School of Economics and King's
College' Cambridge. From 1939 to 1946, he taught economies at
Madras University, and prior to joining Unesco in 1950, he served as
Associate Secretary-General of the World University Service.
KNO LAND LUBBERS.
WANTED : Landlubbers at the
University of London would do
well to take shelter on the lee
side. For the University is
floating out to sea in the fo'c'sle
and bunk cabins of over 1,600
tankers and merchant ships
now sailing the seven oceans.
As a result of an arrangement
concluded by the British
Seafarers Education Service
merchant seamen are now
enrolling by the boatload as
active students at London
University and are taking their
examinations while afloat. A
quarter of a million textbooks
were shipped to merchant vessel
students during 1953, the Sea¬
farers Education Service reports,
and a record cargo of written
homework is being returned to
port.
THE LADIES ARE WIN¬
NING: The word teacher is
rapidly becoming a feminine
noun in Turkey as the result
of a powerful nation-wide
campaign to increase wo¬
men's opportunities for em¬
ployment. A report from
Turkey announces that wo¬
men now outnumber the
men for the first time in city
primary schools and are now
rapidly catching up in rural
areas as well.
Sc.-JCIENCE EXPLORERS :
Preparations are now under
way all over the world for one
of the most gigantic inter¬
national projects ever attempted
for exploring the mysteries of
our planet. Thirty six countries
have already agreed to join
forces though scientists from all
nations are expected to
-participate. The co-operative
venture, scheduled to take place
from July 1957 to December
1958, will be known as the Inter¬
national Geophysical Year and
will cost an estimated
$ 100,000,000. Studies and ex¬
periments are to be conducted
on the earth's magnetism,
cosmic rays, the circulation of
the atmosphere, the aurora,
solar activity and the movement
of glaciers. Spécial observation
stations will be set up in select¬
ed regions; rockets to explore
the upper atmosphere will be
shot from aircraft or other
points. Installations will be such
that scientists expect to be
prepared for any unexpected
phenomenon such as a sudden
violent eruption in thé sun.
MUSIC WHILE YOU
READ: Book lovers in In¬
dia's Delhi Public Library
are now enjoying soft mu¬
sic piped through to them in
the reading rooms. The li¬
brary, created three years
ago as a Unesco-India pilot-
project, has found the music
an aid to concentration in¬
stead of a distraction. The ex¬
periment is proving extreme¬
ly popular with young and
old readers alike. Unesco
reports that an average of
2,200 people now use the li¬
brary which has 20,000 re¬
gistered borrowers and 60,000
books in Hindi, Urdu and
English. Social activities of
an educational nature have
attracted over 190,000 people
in the past three years.
JE EOPLES OF MELAN¬
ESIA: In its issue on "Last
Frontiers of Civilization", (N°.
8/9, 1954) the UNESCO
COURIER published on page 28
two photographs (a Wogeo man
and two women of Guadal¬
canal) to illustrate an article
on the peoples of Melanesia by.
Dr. Margaret Mead. Credit
should have been given to Mr. H.
Ian Hogbin of the University of
Sydney's Department of Anthro¬
pology who took these 'photos
and mention made that they are
copyright by Asia Press Inc.,
publishers of Mr. Hogbin's book,
"Peoples of the Southwest

most modern printing plant
in the country the National
Textbook Printing Plant
has now been completed.
The plant is capable of pro¬
ducing 30,000,000 textbooks a
year. The two UN organiza¬
tions contributed $238,000 for
machinery and other equip¬
ment.
