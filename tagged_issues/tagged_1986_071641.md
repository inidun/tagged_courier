A Million Minutes of Peace
As a contribution to the International Year of Peace, 48 countries from
five continents jointly launched a "Million Minutes of Peace Appeal" on
16 September 1986, the International Day of Peace. In the following
month, people of all ages and origins participated in the Appeal by
offering "minutes of peace" in the form of prayers, meditation, personal
messages and minutes of silence. In France the Appeal was launched at
Unesco Headquarters in Paris in the presence of Mr. Amadou-Mahtar
M'Bow, Director-General of Unesco (left) and Mr. Nikolai Todorov,
President of Unesco's General Conference (back to camera), who is seen
adding a feather to a "dove of peace" created by the French sculptor Nie
Mazodier. The dove was then taken on a tour of French towns and cities
for the collection of more symbolic "minutes of peace" feathers, before
being brought back to Paris, where a ceremony was held on 1 6 October to
mark the close of the Appeal in France. The Appeal ended world-wide on
24 October, when a round-up of the results achieved in the participating
countries was presented to the Secretary-General of the United Nations
in New York.

Editorial December 1986
39th year
Brazil, the largest country of Latin America, the fifth largest in the
world (8.5 million km2) after the Soviet Union, Canada, China and
the United States, possesses more freshwater reserves than any other
country. It is the "lung of the planet" , producing one-quarter of the
world's oxygen. Through it flows the world's largest river in volume
and area of its drainage basin , the 6 ,500-km-long Amazon , which with
its tributaries waters one-third of global timber reserves. Brazil also
has fabulous deposits of precious and semi-precious stones, and is the
major industrial and commercial centre of Latin America, with one of
the highest growth rates in the world.
Brazil has also developed an original culture which respects the
beliefs and customs of the different ethnic groups (some of which live
much as their ancestors did when the Portuguese conquistadors
arrived almost 500 years ago) which make up its population . The
destiny of Brazil has also been shaped by the ethnic intermingling
which is one of the country's most distinctive characteristics. Among
the important manifestations of this culture , to take only three
examples from the arts, are the sculptures of o Aleijadinho, who has
been described as a "universal genius" and "the greatest artist born in
America"; the architecture of Brasilia, the first city of the 21st
century, called by André Malraux the "first capital of the new
civilization"; and Brazilian music, whose popularity at world level is
rivalled only by that of the tango. Superlatives are unavoidable where
Brazil is concerned.
This issue of the Unesco Courier highlights some of the most
original and lesser known aspects of Brazil. We have excluded from
our coverage problems which lie outside Unesco's fields of
competence, and have attempted to dispel the stereotyped and in
some cases misleadingly picturesque image of the country which may
be propagated by the tourist brochure. For space reasons alone there
are bound to be many gaps in the picture. Nevertheless, we hope that
readers will be able to form a clear impression of a country which ,
through its dynamism, its vast wealth of natural resources, its
commitment to progress, and its unfailing gaiety and good humour in
the face of natural obstacles and serious demographic and economic
problems, is the pride of a people who readily claim that "God is
Brazilian !"

### 71606: A Land of contrasts: from the waters of the Amazon to the drought-stricken Northeast

From the waters of the Amazon
to the drought-stricken Northeast
by Thiago de Mello BRAZIL, a country the size of a
continent, covering an area of
more than 8.5 million square
kilometres, contains differences and con¬
trasts within its geographical frontiers
which shape the lives of its people and
leave their imprint on society in each of
its regions. An impressive variety of cli¬
mates conditions local customs and cul¬
tural practices. Foreign travellers even
Brazilians journeying through the
country are inevitably and disturbingly
struck with the impression that they are
entering a different country when they
move from one region to the next. This
impression is softened only by the fact
that a single language is shared by the
people of very different cultures and
ethnic groups who make up a nation
which, by some historical and political
miracle, has succeeded in remaining
unified, and even united, as a federal
republic.
The mountains of the Serra dos Orgäos
in Rio de Janeiro, with their gentle,
baroque contours, and the mineral-rich
Serra da Mantiqueira, in Minas Gerais
State (literally "General Mines"), in the
centrai southern area, bear no resem¬
blance to the flood-plains of the West or
the green grasslands of the South, where
the gently rolling pampas, swept by the
keen minuano wind, stretch as far as the
eye can see. Nor do they have anything in
common with the long valleys where the
coffee plantations abound, often deci¬
mated by frost since the temperature can
fall to several degrees below zero, but
where the fertile soil favours the develop¬
ment of the primary sector and the agri¬
cultural enterprises which play such an
important role in the Brazilian economy.
Left, aerial view of the sea-front at Rio de
Janeiro's Copacabana beach. With over 5
million inhabitants (1980) Rio ranks as
Brazil's second most populous city (after
Säo Paulo) and Latin America's third. (Its
total population, including the surround¬
ing metropolitan area or Baixada, is some
9 million.) Rio was the capital of Brazil
from 1763 until 1960, when its place was
taken by Brasilia, and since 1975 has been
the capital of the State which bears its
name. Situated on the Atlantic coast in the
Sudeste (Southeast), Rio plays a major
role in Brazil's economic life as a leading
industrial centre and busy port, but above
all through activities connected with trans¬
port, commerce and tourism, especially
during the annual Carnival.
Right, the Iguagu Falls, in the State of
Parana, southern Brazil. A major tourist
attraction, the falls are located on a stretch
of the Rio Iguagu (a Guaraní wordmeaning
"Great Water") which forms the frontier
between Brazil andArgentina, about20km 1
above the point where the Iguagu flows ¿
into the Paraná. The 275 cataracts, 60 to 80 1
metres high, are broken up by rocky ^
vegetation-covered islets which spread ®
out in the form ofa horseshoe almost 4 km I
wide. Two nationalparks, one on the Brazi- $
lian side (some 200,000 hectares), the s>
other on the Argentine side, constitute a J
vast reserve for the protection of the s
region's rich animal and plant life. ¿

^ The cold, ash-laden drizzle of Säo
Paulo, which shrouds the largest indus¬
trial complex in Latin America and has
entered into the soul of Brazil's most
populous city, is a far cry from the gentle
breeze that blows in the central planalto
(tablelands), where stands the capital,
Brasilia. Around this city famed for the
beauty of its architecture and urban plan¬
ning stretch the chapadöes dos cerrados,
an area of flattened hills with stunted
vegetation and scrub, where soya-bean
plantations are steadily gaining ground.
In the Northeast, a seemingly infinite
green expanse of hemp-fields forms a
shimmering sea which contrasts with the
parched aridity of the stony badlands dot¬
ted with thorns; here, the heat is suddenly
transformed by the caressing force of the
wind that sweeps a coastline bathed by
the blue waters of the Atlantic. Totally
different again is the climate of the vast
Amazonian plain, covered by dense tro¬
pical forest and criss-crossed with a fan¬
tastic labyrinth of rivers, where the winds
can do little to moderate the damp heat
that rises, like a swaying body, from the
marshlands and the dry outcrops lit by the
glare of the equatorial sun.
Brazil has no snow-capped mountains,
no volcanoes, no deserts. But the multi¬
farious, almost overwhelming contrasts
created by nature make an even stronger
impact because the country is so im¬
mense. The most striking contrast of all is
undoubtedly that between the Amazon
Basin, which contains the world's largest
reserves of fresh water, and the sun¬
baked regions of the Northeast, where
people and animals die of thirst.
Drought is a calamity that since time
immemorial has closed its burning grip,
with implacable regularity, on the lives of
millions of Brazilians who live in what is
known as the "polygon of drought",
which includes parts of the States of
Minas Gerais, Bahia, Sergipe, Alagoas,
Pernambuco, Piauí, Parafba, Rio Grande
do Norte and Ceará. In this region
covering more than a million square
kilometres, 15 per cent of the area of
Brazil, live nearly 40 million people,
more than one-third of the country's
population.
The plight of the Sertäo has always
been a problem for rulers, scientists,
politicians and for all Brazilians who are
concerned with the lives of the people of
their country. A long and sinister chron¬
icle records the drought of the year 1710,

### 71606: A Land of contrasts: from the waters of the Amazon to the drought-stricken Northeast

The Sertâo ¡s a semi-arid zone of Brazil's
northeastern region, the Nordeste, the in¬
habitants of which are known as Sertane-
jos. The Brazilian writerEuclides da Cunha
(1866- 1909) wrote a celebrated book about
this drought-ridden country, Os Sertöes
(1902; translated into English as Revolt in
the Backlands, 1944), which caused a
sensation when it was first published in
Brazil. In this epic he denounceda govern¬
ment military campaign waged in 1896-
1897 against a group of separatist reli¬
gious fanatics led by a messianic figure
known as Antonio "the Counsellor". Draw¬
ing right is from a notebook kept by da
Cunha during the campaign in which he
took part as official reporter. Below right,
illustrated cover of an edition of Grande
Sertâo: Veredas (1956; The Devil to Pay in
the Backlands, 1963), a work which won
international acclaim for the Brazilian wri¬
ter Joäo Guimaräes Rosa (1908-1967) and
which, like other stories and novels by the
same author, is set in the northeast high¬
lands of Brazil.

which lasted for two consecutive sum¬
mers without a drop of rain, as one of the
worst ever known. Another "great"
drought in the hierarchy of misfortune
lasted for three years, from 1777 to 1779.
In the 1980s, when climatic changes
observed since the 1960s are growing
more severe, two long droughts have
already been recorded, each lasting for
more than two years. During the most
recent of them, on the dry, cracked earth,
among skeletons of cattle and the with¬
ered stumps of trees, starving children,
women and men fought for a mouse or
lizard. Drought does not only mean
thirst: it means, above all, hunger.
But is there no water? Are there no
rivers in the Northeast? Of course there
are, many of them, and even some with a
high flow-rate: the Säo Francisco, which
the Northeasterners call Pai Chico (Little
Father), the Paraiba, the Paranaiba and
the Jaguaribe in the State of Ceará
considered to be "the biggest dry river in
the world". But alas most of these rivers
dry up when disaster strikes this land
which "seers" believe is cursed and will
one day again be covered by the sea.
The gloomy prophecy in a sense comes
true. The plight of the Northeast is not
only due to drought, for after the long dry
periods the rain always comes. At first it
seems a miracle: in the space of a few days
the Sertâo turns green again, the red flow¬
ers of the mulungos open, the perfume of
the umburanas floats on the cool air,

.
springs rise afresh, and the green foliage
of the umbuzeiro, the sacred tree of the
Sertâo, is reborn. But this apparent bless¬
ing soon becomes a curse. Suddenly the
rains become torrential, and the scourge
of drought is followed by the calamity of
flood. Overnight the dry riverbeds fill
with water and the rivers burst their
banks, flooding towns and villages,
wreaking death and destruction and bear¬
ing disease and despair. And yet the rainy
season does not last long: some six
months at most, a period that the people
of the Sertâo call the "green time". Then
the vegetation begins to shrivel up, the
bushes shed their leaves, the soil becomes
dry once more and the sun again beats
down in fiery strength on the Sertâo.
Drought repossesses its empire.
Long ago, scientists discovered the
causes of the phenomenon: the wind re¬
gime, the region's orography, the com¬
position of the soil and, above all, sun-
spot activity. We also know that in the
Sertâo, besides rivers, there are ground
water and rainfall. The solution, as Pinto
Aguiar has pointed out in his recent book
Nordeste o drama dos secas ("North¬
east the Drama of Drought"), would be
to locate the groundwater, channel the
river- and rain-water and irrigate the land
by building dams and regularizing river-
flow.
The serious effects of drought hit the
Brazilian economy as a whole, as well as
the people of the Sertâo. Fifty years ago,
the National Department for Action to
Combat Drought (DNOCS) was set up to
cope with natural disasters. In the past
few years a number of federal bodies
have been working on scientific program¬
mes, notably the National Space Re¬
search Institute, which is investigating
the possibilities of using artificial rainfall
on the Sertâo, but this is an immensely
expensive project and its implementation
poses many problems.
Euclides da Cunha says in Os Sertöes (a
classic of Brazilian literature which has
been translated into the world's major
languages, as have Graciliano Ramos's
Vidas secas and Joäo Guimaräes Rosa's
Grande Sertâo: Veredas, two novels
about life in the Sertâo), that "the Sertäo-
dweller is, first and foremost, robust".
Perhaps. Undernourished but strong,
primarily through his powers of enduran¬
ce: he stays for as long as possible in the
drought-stricken Sertâo. When he
reaches his last ounce of strength, he
gathers his family together and "re-

### 71606: A Land of contrasts: from the waters of the Amazon to the drought-stricken Northeast

The capital ofAmazonas State in northern
Brazil, Manaus (right) stands 2,000 km
from the sea on the Rio Negro, near its
confluence with the Amazon, whose main
tributary it is. From 1890 to 1920 the city
(which was known as Manaos until 1939)
enjoyed a boom generated by profits from
wild rubber collected in the surrounding
equatorial forest. Vast fortunes were
made, and a luxurious opera house built in
1896 (at left ofphoto) became a symbol of
the city's spectacular growth. With a
population of some 615,000 (1980), Man¬
aus is today a major administrative, com¬
mercial, industrial (electronics, chemicals,
textiles, engineering) and tourist centre.
Its free port is accessible to ocean-going
vessels.


### 71608: Pilgrims of the Southern Cross

Pilgrims of the Southern Cross
by Emile Gardaz
IN 1 81 7, in the villages of the undulating coun¬
tryside known as the Swiss plateau, barking
dogs and tolling funeral bells provided a grim
accompaniment to disease, harvest failures and
food shortages. The villagers were beginning to
experience the crises of industrial society. Some
of these reputedly sedentary people decided to
try to find a way out of adversity overseas, in
places which were coloured green on the map,
and where lettuce was said to grow five times a
year.
So the Swiss went to seek their fortune else¬
where. They became hotel managers in Manila,
Hong Kong and Singapore; cattle ranchers in
Argentina; farmers in Quebec; wine growers on
the Santa Monica hills in California, or in the
Ukraine. Wine cares little for ideologies.
A century and a half ago, the sound of the
recruiting drum brought a response from im¬
poverished small farmers, debtors dependent
upon their village, the homeless without civic
status, who eked out a living as basket weavers
and had virtually ceased to be peasants. Was
this a beggars' transhumance? Far from it, for
among those who "left for good" were aristocrats
dreaming of new domains over which they would
rule by the will of God, merchants who foresaw
the prospects of import-export trade and of in¬
vestment in the New World.
For all these people, the opportunity "to live
better elsewhere" was a powerful incentive to set
out across the world, through storms and catas¬
trophes, to shores where today their descen¬
dants lead the lives of peaceful Brazilian citizens
with exotic names: Thürler, Curty, Boéchat, Daf-
flon, Simon, Jordan, Ansermet ... Did they find a
Promised Land? Alas, it turned out to be as harsh
as the hills of the home they had left behind them.
The migration southwards was a grim, often
tragic experience. Embarking in pathetic craft,
ill-prepared for life at sea, most of them in pre¬
carious health, the voyagers to the South Atlantic
paid a heavy price. Out of 2,006 candidates for
happiness, 389 died before reaching their goal.
Many brief nocturnal funerals were held on board
the Urania, the Daphne, the Elisabeth-Marie and
the Heureux-Voyage. And on the stony earth
tracks leading out of Rio de Janeiro into the
green vault of the subtropical forest, death also
stalked the immigrants' wagons.
At the end of the exodus the immigrants built
towns and villages with names like Nova Fribur-
go, Cantagallo and Duas Barras. Their Eldorado
bore shades of poverty and failure. There was no
gold in the rivers they found, only mud. The
pilgrims of the Southern Cross were back with
their village quarrels, their domestic feuds, but at
the same time they hoped for a rebirth, a new
flowering.
In 1 820 the cartographers wrote on their maps:
Nova Friburgo22° 16' 42" latitude South, 42"
31' 54" longitude; altitude 847 metres. A Swiss
historian, Martin Nicoulin, has given a fully de¬
tailed description of this fabulous human adven¬
ture in his book La genèse de Nova Friburgo
("The Genesis of Nova Friburgo").
About ten years ago, a group of people from
the Swiss canton of Fribourg went in search of
the descendants of their former compatriots. I
was fortunate enough to go with them. We left a
European autumn and found a southern sum¬
mer. A fine but steady rain was falling over Rio,
as it does in the Swiss Jura between the
seasons. We crossed a gorge and then followed
for a time a yellow river on our left. Then the
valley widened. Small houses for pensioners
heralded the town. Their lawns, fenced in to
discourage stray dogs and travelling salesmen,
had been trimmed that same morning. Hôtel des
Alpes read the signboard on the first large build¬
ing. The proprietor was a Hungarian. Beyond
stretched Nova Fribourg, not unlike a little
French provincial town, except for its trolley¬
buses, and the laughing, coffee-coloured
children.
I discovered that the most flourishing industry
was not cheese and chocolate, as I had been
expecting, but women's underwear. Brass bands
were parading through the main street, deco¬
rated with flags. Everything was ready for the
procession, the ball at the Country Club and high
mass at the Cathedral. The bishop, the Prefect,
the shoeshine boy, the samba school were ready
for the fray. Even the Brazilian army cadets were
standing to attention. A pretty mestizo girl dres¬
sed in three passion-tree leaves followed us,
shouting "Tioulé"! No more than seventeen
years old, she was as beautiful as original sin.
Samba here we come! A local university teacher
with a droll moustache explained that the girl
simply wanted to say that her name was Thürler.
Her ancestors came from the Swiss region of
Singine, north of Fribourg. Sweet potatoes and
coffee produce beautiful children.
I got someone to translate for me the songs
which were being sung and danced to in the next
procession. Sung to the deafening sound and
rhythm of a brass band totally drunk with sun¬
shine and the festive spirit, the words were: "Be
proud and strong, like our fathers, those of our
original homeland ..." I thought I recognized the
patriotic, conventional style of our male-voice
choirs, singing themselves hoarse on the stage
of a village hall in winter.
A town councillor named Folly never left our
side: "Tell me, where is my country?" "Brazil,"
we replied. Obviously. "Switzerland too!" He
repeated his question again and again, until a
visitor keen on family and local history told him
that the Folly family originated from Villarepos, a
small farming village in Fribourg canton. We
drank to his health, and told him about the
orchards and hedges back home, mentioning
that Folly is a common name on the tombstones
of the village cemetery.
The great-grandparents of forty-five-year-old
Noël Boéchat, a teacher of English, emigrated
from Miécourt in the Swiss Jura. One day at table
he suddenly asked a serious question: "What do
you think of the battle of Villmergen?" Here was a
Brazilian who knew all about a distant conflict
that had once divided the Swiss people! Noël told
me that when he was a child, his father would
read at breakfast-time a page from the Bible and
a page of Swiss history.
The world consists of pioneers and those who
stay at home. Once immeasurable, it is now a
village. In Nova Friburgo they are about to open a
Swiss cheese factory which will provide jobs for
some and nourishment for others.
It is twenty minutes after midnight. There is a
silence "Un ange passe", as we say in
French an angel passes. An angel with the
features of Dom Hélder Cámara.1

"Brasilia is built on the horizon. Brasilia
is artificial. As artificial as the world must
have been at the creation. When the world
was created, a man had to be created espe¬
cially for It ... Brazil was born of a final
simplification of ruins. The ivy has not yet
grown Something else blows, as well as
the wind...". Brasilia, the city about which
Brazilian author Clarice Lispector (1925-
1977) wrote these evocative words In 1962,
stands on a high plateau in Brazil's Centre
West region. A striking example of avant-
garde architecture and urban planning de¬
signed by the Brazilian architects Lucio
Costa and Oscar Niemeyer, it was built in
response to the Brazilian people's desire
to occupy the vast and sparselypopulated
interior of their country. In 1980 the Inhabi¬
tants of the federal district of Brasilia
(5,800 km2) numbered around 1,180,000,
some 410,000 of whom lived in the city
itself. Below, the Square of Three Powers,

treats". The painter Candido Portinari
poignantly depicted those "retreating"
emigrants. The man of the Sertâo is
strong, too, in his love for the land: when
the green time comes, he returns again to
his Sertâo.
But not all return. Many depart, tread¬
ing the paths of exile, in search of more
favourable conditions. One destination is
the Amazon Basin, which, since the end
of the last century, with the increase in
rubber extraction ("gold" actually grow¬
ing on, or rather in, trees), down to our
own time, thanks to the bright lights of
the Manaus Free Zone, has become one
of the most attractive regions of Brazil for
Northeasterners.
The Sertâo and the Amazon. The dry
earth of the Sertâo. The moist, damp
earth of the Amazon. The Sertâo with its
sparse shrubs and solitary cacti. The
Amazon Basin with its thick forests of
lofty trees, the planet's biggest tropical
forest. The Sertâo, where year follows
year without a drop of rain. The Amazon,
one of the world's rainiest areas. Apart
from a short period in the summer, it
rains virtually every day in the Amazon
basin. In the Sertâo, the rivers dry up. In
the Amazon Basin, the riverbeds are
never seen, even at periods of very low
water. In the Sertâo, absence and abund¬
ance of water are both disasters. In the
Amazon Basin the great floods may dis¬
rupt the lives of the forest-dwellers (here,
as Leandro Tocantins has written, "the
river governs life") and be an obstacle to
farming, but they never cause as much
damage as in the Northeast. Here, when
the waters rise too high the Amazonian
water regime is invariable: six months
spate and six months low water the
bank-dwellers suffer. Their houses are
flooded, cobras lie in wait for children
and farm animals , the j ute plantations on
the alluvial banks are flooded before the
crops can be harvested, and livestock has
to be herded into floating pens and then
transported by barge to fields in drier
areas. To offset this, when the waters
recede the banks are covered with a layer
of organic material which increases the
fertility of the soil.
Amazon, water and forest. The river
which Vicente Pinzón called Mar Dulce
(freshwater sea) when he discovered its
estuary, contains a greater volume of
water than any other river. It is 6,500
kilometres long, or one and a half times
the breadth of Brazil itself. It is a Latin
American river: rising in Peru, in the
mountain range of La Raya, it is swelled
by the waters of the Ucayali; it is known
as the Solimöes when it reaches Brazil,
where it joins the Rio Negro and flows on
to the sea. When it reaches the sea it is
more than 300 kilometres wide and is
moving so rapidly that it flows over 50
kilometres out into the Atlantic. With its
powerful tributaries and all its intermin¬

### 71606: A Land of contrasts: from the waters of the Amazon to the drought-stricken Northeast

^ Amazon is the largest hydrographie basin
in the world and the most extensive river
network.
The forest contains over 4,000 species
of tree, scattered evenly throughout the
region. There are 350 million hectares of
forest, 70,000 million cubic metres of
standing timber, one-third of the world's
reserves. The National Institute for
Amazonian Research has set up a
"xylothèque" in which nearly 2,000
species have already been catalogued,
including such fine cabinet woods as
cedar, mahogany and curbaril.
Over this forest which has given so
much, with its oxygen and its wealth, not
only to the people of the region but also
to those living in the most distant parts of
the earth, hangs the sinister threat of
devastation, chiefly because of the ruth¬
less deforestation methods used by big
multinational companies to establish in¬
dustrialized farm complexes. But this is
not the place to discuss this serious ques¬
tion. As well as the forest, the lives of the
people who live in it must also be pre¬
served from the devastation of neglect
and homelessness.
In the Amazon Basin, there is no thirst,
as there is in the Sertâo. But during the
long period of floods, the caboclos the
Amazonian peasants experience
hunger. When the waters rise, the fish
abandon the rivers for the marshes, for
lakes hidden in the forest. When this
happens, in parts of the forest where
there is no organized food supply (in
other words, nearly everywhere) then the
invisible teeth of hunger begin, silently,
to gnaw. Here nobody starves to death,
as they do in the Sertâo. But, as I have
seen with my own eyes, many children go
to bed hungry.
In all parts of Brazil and in all its cities,
great and small, one finds the terrible
social inequalities which mark the lives of
my country's people. But it is in the
Northeast and in the interior of the Ama¬
zon forest that the most undernourished
and most poverty-stricken Brazilians are
to be found.
As a token of my clear-sighted love for
my brothers in the Northeast, I; a caboclo
from the Amazon Basin, a son of water
and forest, should like to conclude with
this acute observation made recently by
the economist Celso Furtado: "The
Northeast is, in fact, the mirror that re¬
flects Brazil with brutal clarity. There we
can see, starkly revealed, the major
deformities that are crippling our
development."
THIAGO DE MELLO, Brazilian poet and writer,
has published many poetry collections which
have been widely translated. His works include
Cançao do amor armado (Song ofArmed Love),
Horóscopo para os que estäo vivos (Horoscope
for Those who are Alive) and Vento geral (Gen¬
eral Wind). He was one of the participants in
"War on War", an international forum of poets
organized by Unesco in 1982.
Pictures from the past
Photography was introduced to Brazil as
early as 1840, and soon became wide¬
spread as a result of support from the
Brazilian emperor Pedro II (1825-1891),
himself a keen photographer, collector
and patron of the arts. From top to bottom:

to, a city notable for Its monuments, espe¬
cially its 18th-century churches (some de¬
signed and decorated by the great Brazi¬
lian baroque sculptor and architect o Alei-

national monument, was included on
Unesco's World Heritage List in 1980.

Alvares Cabrai landing at Porto Seguro,

lian artist Oscar Pereira da Silva (1867-
1939). In 1500 the Portuguese Government
sent Cabrai to follow the route discovered
by Vasco da Gama around the Cape of
Good Hope to India. To avoid the calms of
the Gulfof Guinea, orto carry outpossible
instructions from the Portuguese king
(who may have wanted to extend his
dominion over a part of the globe which
fell within the Portuguese sphere as de¬
fined by the Treaty of TordesiIlas of 1494),
Cabrai sailed so far westwards that he
sighted the coast of what is today the
Brazilian State of Babia. He went ashore
and took possession of land which he
named Vera Cruz ("True Cross"), a name
which was soon abandoned in favour of
Brazilafter the valuablereddyewood{pau-
brasil) in which the country abounded.
THE most outstanding feature of
Brazil's relations with her neigh¬
bours has always been the fun¬
damental differences existing between
them. Brazil was discovered and colo¬
nized by the Portuguese indeed, for
fourteen years at the beginning of the
nineteenth century it was the seat of the
Portuguese royal family and court
whereas the other South American terri¬
tories came under the control of the
Spanish Crown.
Strangely enough, Christopher Col¬
umbus began by seeking, albeit unsuc¬
cessfully, the support of the Portuguese
sovereigns for his plans. Had he managed
to convince them, the colonization of the
South American continent might well
have been more balanced and the differ¬
ences less pronounced.
In a series of Papal Bulls promulgated
between 1492 and 1494, the Catholic
kings of Spain were granted the privileges
of the conquest which Columbus had
been instrumental in starting. All the
conquered lands lying west of the meri¬
dian passing through Cape Verde and the
Azores came under Spanish jurisdiction.
King John II of Portugal complained to
the Pope and an attempt was made,
through a further set of Bulls, to grant
certain rights to the Portuguese. When
the tension between the two powers was
reaching alarming proportions, the two
monarchs agreed on the "partition of the
ocean sea", which was enshrined in the
Treaty of Tordesillas (1494). This docu¬
ment provided for the demarcation of
areas in lands already discovered or "yet
to be discovered", while respecting the
rights acquired by Portugal and Castile,
but the precise boundaries were never
drawn. Indeed, had the provisions of the
Treaty been complied with, Brazil would
have only one-third of its present-day
landmass. Moreover, both Portugal and

^ Spain always tried to draw the "dividing-
line" in places that best suited their
interests at the time.
For thirty years from the discovery of
Brazil by Pedro Alvares Cabrai in 1500 to
the arrival of the expedition led by Mar-
tim Afonso de Sousa in 1530 the Portu¬
guese Crown did not pay much heed to its
new colony. Cabrai was not a "naviga¬
tor", and the purpose of his expedition
was not so much to explore the country as
to set up a trading station in the port of
Calicut in India all of which suggests
that Brazil, like the rest of the Americas,
was discovered only by chance.
The exploratory expeditions which
sailed along much of the seaboard in 1501
and 1502 came to the conclusion that the
territory was not an island, as Cabrai had
originally believed. Various historians
claim that the kings of Portugal main¬
tained the utmost secrecy about the new
discoveries to protect them from the
covetous eyes of more powerful nations.
Furthermore, the new colony did not
have many attractions: it was too large,
and although it produced timber, there
were no signs of precious metals or
spices. This was an age when the Indies
were synonymous with Eldorado, when a
sack of pepper was worth its weight in
gold, and Cabral's exploit only spelt dis¬
appointment and tedium. The timber
supplied by the colony entailed heavy
handling costs and the vast area on which
it was produced had to be defended. The
extensive seaboard whetted the greedy
appetites of other European countries,
which felt wronged by the Treaty of Tor-
desillas. Since there was no prospect of
obtaining an immediate return, the King
of Portugal embarked on the costly task
of exploring the colony. To all intents and
purposes, however, the new-found terri¬
tory was left to its own devices.
The first colonizing expedition led by
Martim Afonso de Sousa came across a
handful of Frenchmen living on those
forsaken lands, but they were expelled
and the settlement of Portuguese com¬
munities began. Meanwhile, Spanish col¬
onization was well underway; by 1540
there were settlements virtually through¬
out the area conquered by the Spanish,
whereas Brazil was sparsely colonized
and the settlements were primarily con¬
centrated on the coast. The Portuguese
"conquistadores" benefited from land
concessions, but they ran their own pri¬
vate ventures without any support from
the Crown and the fruits of their labours
largely depended on the good fortune of
"entrepreneurs". Accordingly, very few
young colonies managed to prosper.
In 1580, the Kingdoms of Portugal and
Spain formed the Iberian Union, and the
colonization of Brazil was given fresh
impetus, but this did not bring the Brazi¬
lian "sub-continent" and its neighbours
any closer together. Parts of Brazil were
invaded by the Dutch in the Northeast,
by the French in the North and on the
southern central seaboard and the
struggle to expel these intruders resulted
in the occupation and colonization forces
penetrating far beyond the tentative
limits laid down by the Treaty of Torde-
sillas. In little more than a century the
Pedro I ruled as the first emperor of Brazil
from 1822 to 1831. He was appointed Re¬
gent in 1821 when his father King John VI
of Portugal returned to Lisbon from Brazil
where he and his family had taken refuge
after Napoleon's conquest of Portugal in
1807. When Pedro issued a declaration of
Brazilian independence on 7 September
1822, he is said to have been wearing on
his breast a yellow flower with a green
centre, thus choosing the colours of Inde¬
pendent Brazil. On 12 October he was
proclaimed constitutional emperor of Bra¬
zil at Rio de Janeiro. Above, Acclamation

Debret (1768-1848), a French painter who

Portuguese Crown thus doubled the size
of its initial bridgehead in South
America.
The expeditions originally mounted to
capture and enslave the indigenous
population came to an end, but then
others were launched between 1628 and
1641 against the Spanish Jesuit missions
in a number of places in the interior of
what is today southern Brazil. Through¬
out the eighteenth century, Portuguese
expeditions continued to settle the cen¬
tre-west region and add more territory to
the colony. Further treaties were con¬
cluded with Spain, but the expansionist
movement went on, not slowing down
but changing its direction as the Portu¬
guese took over vast areas of Amazonia.
The pace then slackened and expan¬
sion almost came to a halt in 1822, when y

Sao Paulo is Brazil's biggest city and eco¬
nomic nerve centre as well as being the
capital of the State of Sao Paulo. From
here in the 17th century expeditions orga¬
nized by adventurers known as ban-
deirantes (from the bandeira or flag
around which they rallied) set out into the
interior with the purpose of capturing
Indian slaves or finding gold andprecious
stones. One of the most famous of these
expeditions which marked the start of ter¬
ritorial expansion in Brazil was led by
Antonio Raposo Tavares, who left Säo
Paulo in 1628 with 8,000 men, crossed the
Mato Grosso, reached the Bolivian Andes
and came back down the Amazon. The
Monumento as Bandeiras, below, was
erected In Säo Paulo's Ibirapuera Park in
memory of these early pioneers. The
monument is by Victor Brécheret (1894-
1955), a Brazilian artist of French origin
who introduced Brazilian sculpture to new
ideas and trends.

### 71610: Brazil and its neighbours

the independence of Brazil was declared.
The relative standstill was partly due to
political contingencies connected with in¬
dependence, the consolidation of which
was hindered by outbreaks of domestic
unrest, and partly to a period of consider¬
able prosperity enjoyed by the agricul¬
tural export sector: the absolute domina¬
tion exercised by the central-southern
region pushed expansionism into the
background.
The Brazilian Empire (1822-1889) and
the Republic in its early years spent much
time and energy in securing international
recognition of the country's borders and
in consolidating control and sovereignty
over the territories inherited from the
Portuguese Crown, but this did not stop
expansion from going ahead, chiefly in
the Amazon region. The final acquisition
of land occurred in the early years of the
twentieth century, when Bolivia relin¬
quished the 200,000 square kilometres of
the Acre region following swift military
action, subject to the payment of 2 mil¬
lion pounds sterling in compensation,
and a promise to build a railway line
linking Bolivian territory with the
Madeira and Amazon rivers.
Hence the outcome of the constant
conflict of interests between the King¬
doms of Portugal and Castile, and of the
colonization on which they both embar¬
ked, was that Brazil and its neighbours
grew apart. The South American con¬
sciousness that is so evident in the Span¬
ish-American countries is certainly not a
Brazilian characteristic. The community
of interests which Simon Bolivar and José
de San Martín envisioned, going beyond
the confines of the patria chica
(homeland), is a Spanish-American view
to which Brazilians have never managed
to subscribe.
There has always been a special rela¬
tionship between Brazil and its largest
and most powerful neighbour, Argenti¬
na. Because of their national characteris¬
tics and the influence they wield in the
South American context, relations be¬
tween the two countries have always been
very important but, curiously enough,
they have not been among the priorities
of either.
In its expansionist drive, the Portu¬
guese colony came up against dense
forest in the North and Centre West,
while in the South it faced a population of
Hispanic origin . The formation of the two
nations Brazil and Argentina was dic¬
tated by the major objectives of the
metropolitan powers. The Spanish
Empire was primarily interested in min¬
ing the precious metals to be found on the
Peruvian and Bolivian highlands, and did
not pay too much attention to the expan¬
sionist designs of the Portuguese on the
Río de la Plata estuary. However, the
population migrating from the highlands
found excellent farming and stockraising
conditions in this region and chose to
occupy both banks of the river and resist
incursions from the North.
Into the heart of Brazil
Early in the 19th century, a Russian scientific expedition
lasting several years explored the interior of Brazil. It was led
by Grigori Ivanovich Langsdorf (1 774-1 852), member extraor¬
dinary of the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences, who had
taken part in several exploratory expeditions in different parts
of the world before being appointed Russian Consul-General
at Rio de Janeiro in 1812. His Brazilian expedition brought
back a mass of invaluable information: travel logs and studies
running to some 4,000 manuscript pages, maps, almost 400
drawings, over a hundred Indian artefacts and important
zoological and plant collections, the latter of which made it
possible to classify almost 15 per cent of Brazilian plant life
(some thirty tropical plants bear the name of Langsdorf). The
most interesting documents, from an historical as well as a
scientific or cultural point of view, are the travel diaries (soon
to be published) which Langsdorf kept between 1821 and
1828. One of the artists who accompanied the expedition,
Hercule Florence, left an equally fascinating collection of
notes and drawings entitled Supplement to the journey of
Monsieur de Langsdorf to the heart of Brazil, from September
1825 to March 1829, by the second painter of this journey,
Hercule Florence. Drawing below and the following descrip¬
tion of a "ruin-shaped" landscape have been taken from
Florence's journal. They seem to evoke the enormous rocks
sculpted by erosion in the Vila Velha National Park, southern
Brazil. "The next day," Florence wrote, "I hastened to go and
see the rocks. I had the impression of being among the ruins
of a large town which had once been noted for its grandeur
and the magnificence of its buildings. Among the ruins, I saw
tombs, bases of collapsed columns, urns. Three of these urns
were undoubtedly natural formations. Two of them were
small, the third more than 30 feet high, with a narrow base. The
latter stands on a 30-foot plinth, dominating other regularly-
shaped rocks. Trees and bushes crown the slopes of higher
rocks round about, irresistibly bringing to mind hanging
gardens. The rock appeared through the trees like a broken
column on its plinth. An immense wall of rock can also be
seen, formed from a mass of geometric shapes piled up
horizontally one on top of the other. These walls rise out of the
forest, half-obscuring one another, arranged like the decor of
a theatre."

### 71610: Brazil and its neighbours

Above, workers in an aircraft factory, Säo
Paulo State. Brazil's industry is highly
diversified and competitive on world mar¬
kets. Favoured by its abundant iron ore,
Brazil is the world's third largest producer
of iron and steel, and has a dynamic ener¬
gypolicy especially regarding the produc¬
tion of hydroelectric power. A wide range
ofprocessing industries are almost exclu¬
sively based in or near the big cities, espe¬
cially Säo Paulo, which far outstrips Rio de
Janeiro and Belo Horizonte In this field.
Following this first clash of interests,
and for many years thereafter, relations
between Brazilians and Argentines, with
the Uruguayans wedged between them,
oscillated between a kind of confronta¬
tion and lukewarm attempts at co-oper¬
ation. Over a period extending from in¬
dependence to the first half of the twen¬
tieth century, two closely related forces
contended for a measure of domination
in South America. These were, on the
one hand, the Argentine élites, who were
essentially responsive to the interests of
the British Empire and, on the other, the
Brazilian élites, who sought to gravitate
towards the orbit of the rising power of
North America.
Over the past forty years, the struggle
between Brazil and Argentina for
hypothetical supremacy in South Amer¬
ica has been reduced to a war of words.
Among the reasons for this are the econo¬
mic growth and accelerated industrial de
velopment of both countries; the decline
of British influence in the region and the
emergence of new power centres with the
consequent diversification of internation¬
al relationships; and the manifest state of
dependence in which both Brazil and
Argentina found themselves for some
decades. In the 1950s, and to an even
greater degree following the oil crisis in
the 1970s, Brazil and Argentina began to
show growing signs of having reciprocal
interests. The same is true of Brazil's
relations with some of its other South
American neighbours, as negotiations
aimed at bringing about closer bilateral
and multilateral relations are being
stepped up.
A whole series of domestic and exter¬
nal factors, both positive and negative
ranging from the oil crisis to the runaway
growth of the foreign debt and including
the gradual return of almost all the coun¬
tries of the region to elected or transition¬
al civilian governments paving the way
for full democracy are now combining
to strengthen future relations between
Brazil and the other countries of South
America.
For the first time since the sudden in¬
terruption of the normal constitutional
process more than twenty-two years ago,
Brazil now appears prepared to treat the
other Latin-American countries on an
equal footing. If she does so, Brazilians
will undoubtedly see that immense differ¬
ences still exist, such as the marked influ
ence of African cultures on the formation
of their national identity and the absence
(contrary to the situation in almost all the
surrounding countries) of a significant
contribution from ancestral indigenous
cultures. At the same time, however,
they will be able to see very many points
of similarity that have hitherto been vir¬
tually concealed.
The Brazilians' true discovery of Latin
America will probably be a slow process.
The first step will entail taking the coun¬
try out of the orbit of official pronounce¬
ments and bilateral trade and instilling
awareness among the population. When
this happens, the tango will still be the
tango and the samba will still be the sam¬
ba, just as pisco' and cachaca,2 feijoada,3
cebiche4 and parrillc? will not necessarily
mix happily. Even so, there can be no
doubt that our dances, national drinks

partake of them, will gain thereby.

### 71614: Caribbean cousins

Caribbean cousins
by Carlos Castilho
BRAZILIAN specialists in inter¬
national affairs such as Professor
Hélio Jaguaribe believe that rela¬
tions between Brazil and the Caribbean
are at a low ebb because of differences in
their colonial past, in their specific econo¬
mic characteristics, and in the diversity of
their geo-political interests, although
there are ethnic and cultural ties that
could bring them closer together.
It is true that most of the Black popu¬
lation of Brazil share the same African
origin as the vast majority of Caribbean
Blacks. However, as the slaves from the
West Coast of Africa were forced to
adapt to their new environment in the
New World, they underwent a variety of
fortunes. In Brazil, the Blacks were not
robbed of their culture, nor were their
"souls eaten away", as was the case in the
British colonies of the Caribbean.
This difference has its roots in history.
Whereas the British colonial system in
countries like Barbados, Jamaica and
Antigua even sought to stamp out the
Blacks' religion and to replace it with
another, in Brazil the Portuguese allowed
the slaves to keep their African customs.
The violence inflicted on their culture
was harsher in the Caribbean and, as a
result, the outlook of the Black popula¬
tion of the former British colonies there is
focused on London. (One Brazilian dip¬
lomat who served in an embassy in the
Caribbean claims that the only thing that
the region's English-speaking Blacks
know about Brazil is that Pelé is a great
footballer.)
The contacts that have been made in
recent years through reggae music are a
result of the distribution of records from
the United States, and consequently this
form of cultural expression reached Bra¬
zil stripped of its origins and its political
and cultural significance. Reggae and the
Rastafarian sect are manifestations of the
deep-rooted resistance of Caribbean
Blacks to oppressive Anglo-Saxon domi¬
nation, but in Brazil commercial plugging
and trendiness have overshadowed the
revolutionary content of each of these
phenomena.
Our links with those parts of the Carib¬
bean dominated by France and the
Netherlands are even more remote.
However, the opposite is true of our rela
tions with the former Spanish colonies
and in this context Cuba and Santo
Domingo are special cases. Cuba repre¬
sented a myth for the generation of the
1960s because of the nature of its revolu¬
tionary process, which captivated many
young people in Spanish-speaking Latin
America and later in Brazil. The pattern
of Cuban socialism and the romantic aura
surrounding the guerrillas of the Sierra
Maestra made a profound impression on
young Brazilians of that decade, but this
had more to do with ideological issues
than with cultural or economic affinities.
In Santo Domingo, the presence of Brazi¬
lian troops during the crisis of 1965
brought to the fore a conflict that was
virtually unintelligible to public opinion
in Brazil and whose only effect was to
trigger off an internal ideological pol¬
emic. However, the similarities of lan¬
guage and of a number of Latin customs
have always meant that the former Span¬
ish colonies are closer to the average
Brazilian than the rest.
The 1960s saw the start of a gradual
rapprochement between Cuba and Brazil
through cultural, touristic, artistic and,


### 71616: The African heritage

The African heritage
IN the aesthetic field Brazilians have special
African connections which differentiate them
from other Latin Americans even from
those tropical American regions where the Afri¬
can influence is strong. In Nigeria, for example,
there is a Brazilian style in both architecture and
in interior design; it even makes use of typically
Brazilian animals and plants. A special Brazilian
flavour has also crept into Nigerian cooking,
dance, recreation, worship and folklore.
Some art critics see links between the works of
the Spanish painter Joan Miró and those of the
young Nigerian sculptor Jacob Afolabi. One
good turn deserves another: was it not another
giant of Spanish painting, Picasso, who de¬
veloped African art forms and transmitted them
to artists in Europe and elsewhere in the world?
Jacob Afolabi and other African artists have affi¬
nities not only with Picasso, but with Brazilian
artists who are themselves Picassian in their
sensitivity to Black African forms of expression. It
seems clear that Nigerian artists today find
something familiar in much authentically Brazi¬
lian art, something fraternally related to what
they themselves consider to be art.
The Brazilian heritage explains why African
artists like Afolabi are linked more closely to such
Brazilian artists as Ciceros dos Santos Dias,
Emiliano di Cavalcanti and Lulas Cardoso Ayres,
than to artists like Miró. It also explains why the
work of Nigerian craftsmen like Adebisi who
deliberately cultivates the so-called Brazilian-
Nigerian style in his art shows similarities with
the painted pottery of a Brazilian artist like Fran¬
cisco Brennand.
Does modern Brazilian artists' sensitivity to the
African roots of their painting, sculpture and
music reflect an exclusive attachment to "négri¬
tude"? If so, then Brazilians of African descent
would tend to draw away from Brazilians of diffe¬
rent descent. Would this make for a "black Brazi¬
lian" like the black North American? Not at all.
Only in a handful of cases, and in a purely
theoretical sense.

### 71614: Caribbean cousins

Candido Portinari (1903-1962) holds a
similar position in Brazilian painting to
that of Heitor Villa-Lobos in Brazilian
music and Oscar Niemeyer in Brazilian
architecture. His country's most important
20th-century artist, Portinari took the
whole panorama of Brazilian life as his
material. Brazil has launched a Portinari
project which is currently documenting,
photographing and cataloguing the
artist's vast output of over 4,000 works in
which he painted with great feeling and
technical skill the peasants of his native
region of Säo Paulo, migrants from the
Nordeste, cowhands, labourers andpopu¬
lar musicians, as well as portraits and reli¬
gious and historical subjects. Two great
panels by Portinari, War and Peace, can be
seen in the entrance hall of the United
Nations building in New York. Brodowski
Landscape (1948), above, ¡s a lyrical
evocation of images and scenery associ¬
ated with his native village near Säo Paulo,
which was a constantsource ofinspiration
to the painter and a recurrent theme in his

on occasion, technical exchanges. Here
again, the driving force behind the move¬
ment was ideological, with Cuba trying to
break out of the North American dip¬
lomatic straitjacket and the Brazilian
opposition, which had only recently
emerged from a long period of dictator¬
ship, trying to correct what was for the
Left "a historical mistake", and, for the
diplomats, "an anomaly". As a result of
this rapprochement, in which both par¬
ties proceeded with considerable caution
for fear of making a false move, Cuban
culture is now better known in Brazil than
that of any other country in the region.
Visits by musicians such as Pablo
Milanés, by ballet companies such as that
led by Alicia Alonso, and by volleyball,
basketball and athletics teams, have suc¬
ceeded in breaking the taboos nurtured
by conservative circles in Brazil.
Cuba also buys from Brazil far more
books, films, records and television pro¬
grammes than any other Caribbean coun
try. Writers of the stature of Graciliano
Ramos, Jorge Amado, Carlos Drum-
mond de Andrade and Clarice Lispector,
as well as such lesser known authors as
Jorge Franca Junior and Antonio Calla¬
do, were translated and published in
Cuba, in spite of the twenty-year break in
diplomatic relations. It is true that the
Cuban writers Alejo Carpentier and
Nicolas Guillen have long enjoyed a
reputation in Brazil. In the musical
sphere, Chico Buarque long regarded


### 71617: Black theatre, Black consciousness

Black theatre, Black consciousness
by Ático Vilas-Boas da Mota
BLACK theatre in Brazil is deeply rooted in
the soil of Africa, where archaeologists,
historians, anthropologists and special¬
ists in folklore have in recent decades discovered
documentary evidence and other data which
reveal that continent as one of humanity's most
expressive "scenarios", a setting for drama
equalling in some respects achievements hailed
by the West as supreme. Naturally, the dynamics
of African theatre do not always coincide with
those of West European theatre, whose forms
and aesthetic profile were inherited by Brazil.
African drama, centred on the figure of the narra¬
tor, sets up an axiological chain in which speech
and gesture are so closely interlocked that it is
impossible to dissociate them. The audience,
eager to speak out, sometimes takes on the role
of a chorus echoing the action.
,ln Brazil and other parts of the world the prog¬
ress of Black creativity was halted and degraded
by the Diaspora of slavery. Enduring the greatest
material and spiritual hardship, Africans were
deprived of the most rudimentary means of per¬
forming the forms of spontaneous drama they
had inherited from their ancestors. Under the
oppressive burden of slavery, these forms of
expression were directed towards music and
dancing, or were transformed into substitute
rituals such as the candomblé, the macumba,
and the tambor-de-mina.
Black theatre did not really achieve expression
in Brazil until the 1940s, when Abdias do Nas-
cimento founded the Teatro Experimental do
Negro (TEN) (Experimental Black Theatre).
Nascimento, the son of manual labourers, was
born in 1914, and took part in the great protest
movement of the Brazilian Black Front in the
1930s. After graduating in economics from the
University of Rio de Janeiro, he rebelled against
the dictatorship of the Estado Novo (New State)
proclaimed in November 1 937, and in 1 938 orga¬
nized the Afro-Campineiro Congress (named
after Campinas, a town in the State of Säo
Paulo). Painter and poet but primarily a play¬
wright, he wrote Rapsodia negra ("Black Rhap¬
sody") and Sortilegio: Misterio negro ("Black
Mystery") for the TEN. After being proscribed for
six years by the censor, Sortilegio: Misterio neg¬
ro was finally performed by the TEN in the Muni¬
cipal Theatre of Rio de Janeiro in 1957.
The TEN was an authentic Black "con¬
sciousness" movement for people living in Brazi¬
lian society but unable to participate fully in it.
The lofty and generous ambitions of the TEN are
to help Blacks to reject their status as mere
spectators or exotic characters in Brazilian dra¬
ma, literature, music and the plástic arts, a form
of cultural exclusion of which other ethnic minor¬
ities such as gypsies are also victims. The TEN
also strives to improve the situation of Blacks in
Brazilian society by making them aware of issues
related to the defence of their fundamental hu¬
man rights. For this purpose it organizes intro¬
ductory and refresher courses in various bran¬
ches of culture and the arts, and since 1 945 has
held many conventions, conferences and nation¬
al congresses of Brazilian Blacks at which the
problems of Afro-Brazilian life have been discus¬
sed. In recent decades, the TEN has stepped up
its action on behalf of Black culture, working as a
catalyst to release the latent energies of this
large sector of the Brazilian population, and to
liberate the creative capacities of Brazilian
Blacks.
In all an,ti-racist action and in the efforts to
organize Black people in Brazil which led to the
founding of the Movimento Negro Unificado in
1978 and to the third Congress of Black Amer¬
ican Cultures (1 982), the theatre has done much
to promote the idea that Black people should not
be treated as culturally passive, and that, pre¬
cisely because they have so much to offer the
country, they should not remain on the sidelines
of cultural activity. The aim is to strengthen ethnic
roots weakened by the long years of slavery, to
co-ordinate the action of Black communities
scattered throughout Brazil, and whenever
possible to revitalize contacts with Africa and
with Black communities elsewhere in the Amer¬
ican continent.
The TEN is writing its name in the pages of
history as a living, dynamic movement, stimulat¬
ing and controversial. The story is far from over,
since the movement is still bearing fruit despite
the period of inertia that it has gone through since
the enforced exile of Abdias do Nascimento in
1968. It is still an active force among Black
people in the world of the theatre and has en¬
couraged the creation of new drama groups
throughout Brazil. The TEN has been for Black
awareness in the theatre what the 1 922 "Week of
Modern Art" was for the emancipation of Brazi¬
lian literature and art (see page 38).
In the past, "when a Black went to the theatre it
was to sweep the floor". As the legacy and
stigma of a terrible system of slavery, Black
people were not allowed to lake leading roles,
even when the characters were Black. Oral and
written accounts tell us that white actors black¬
ened their faces with coal and wore dark gloves
when they played Black roles.
The founding of the TEN led not only to the
establishment of a Black people's theatre but
also to a movement launched by Blacks with the
support of a few distinguished figures in the world
of art and culture who favoured this avant-garde
experiment. Despite its modest beginnings, the
TEN had ambitious targets training Black
actors, actresses and producers, creating the
structures necessary for the development of its
activities, and writing Afro-Brazilian dramatic
works that expressed the Black point of view.
The TEN, which is involved in the Museum of
Black Art, in the Institute of Afro-Brazilian Studies
and Research, and in the Brazilian Foundation of
Art, Education and Culture, has not yet run out of
steam. Other groups are today seeking to stimu¬
late activity among Black people. Although some
of them have lost their initial dynamism, and work
only intermittently, they are constantly being
joined by new groups of young people eager to
pursue their dream of art. The dream may turn
out to be impossible, but what counts is that
these groups are found throughout Brazil, weak¬
ly represented in some places, numerous and
active in others.
In any case, what Black people are seeking in
drama is not a way of climbing the social ladder,
but self-realization. In all their demands and
protests, including the use of drama as a means
of expression, Brazilian Blacks are struggling to
achieve fulfilment in a social context of freedom,
where the principles of social justice are both
taughtand practised.

as Brazil's cultural ambassador to the rest
of Latin America, especially to Cuba
was responsible for introducing Cuban
music to the Brazilian record market,
although the Cuban nueva trova has not
enjoyed the same commercial success as
Jamaican reggae. In the last three years
or so, Brazilian television serials have
been highly popular in Cuba, the most
noteworthy example being A escrava
¡saura ("The Slave Girl Isaura"), which is
based on a Brazilian historical novel ab¬
out the period of slavery.
The normalization of relations be¬
tween Brazil and Cuba was accompanied
by trade flows amounting to $5 million
shortly before diplomatic links were re¬
established. When the exchange of
ambassadors was announced, some ex¬
porters began to talk in terms of an over¬
all volume of trade amounting to as much
as $200 million, but more realistic
businessmen believe that it will be diffi¬
cult to achieve an annual level of more
than $50 million, representing only one-
quarter of Brazil's trade with Nigeria and
less than half its trade with Angola. The
limitations imposed by the relative com¬
plementarity of the two economies
both of which produce sugar and tobac¬
co and Cuba's difficulties in obtaining
hard currency to pay for Brazilian manu¬
factured goods, have prompted some
Brazilian political analysts to claim that
the move to re-establish relations with
Cuba had more to do with domestic poli
tical manoeuvring than with diplomatic
strategy.
Brazil has always had close economic
relations with Trinidad and Tobago be¬
cause of oil. However, the Caribbean
country with which trade has expanded
most in recent years is Suriname, where
Brazil has replaced the Netherlands as a
major trading partner, and has even been
an arms supplier. Even so, Brazilian eco¬
nomic strategists recognize that US
domination of the region cannot be over¬
come in the present circumstances.

bean differs from that prevalent in the

National Security Council in the twenty

does not uphold the doctrine of ideologi¬
cal confrontation in the region. The new
republic's diplomacy gives priority to en¬
tente and negotiation, as illustrated by its
attitude towards Nicaragua.
The restoration of diplomatic relations
with Cuba follows this approach, in which
confrontation gives way to a more
pragmatic attitude. The Brazilian gov¬
ernment believes that both countries can
adopt joint positions on such issues as the
price of sugar and even on external debt
negotiations. Some optimistic exporters
think that the re-opening of the Cuban
market to Brazilian manufactured and
semi-manufactured goods could give
Brazil an important foothold in the
Caribbean. It would be advantageous for
Brazil to capture part of the export mar¬
ket of Argentina, which has hitherto been
Latin America's largest supplier of in¬
dustrial goods and agricultural products
to Cuba. However, it will be difficult for
the Brazilians to catch up with Japan,
which is currently Cuba's main trading
partner in the capitalist world.
The prospects for Brazilian trade else¬
where in the Caribbean are limited by the
policies of the United States and the
United Kingdom in the region. However,
Brazilian diplomatic strategists consider
that there will be far-reaching changes in
the Caribbean in the long run. The grow¬
ing number of new nations in the Carib¬
bean, as countries still under European
colonial domination gain independence,
could increase the membership of the
Organization of American States (OAS)
and repeat the pattern already observed
in the United Nations, whereby increased
African and Asian representation has
made inroads on the domination of the
major powers. Events such as the inva¬
sion of Grenada are viewed with scepti¬
cism by Brazilian specialists on Carib¬
bean issues, on the grounds that such
interventions are more likely to heighten
than relieve international tensions.
Many people quote the belief held by
the Colombian writer Germán Arci-
niegas that the Caribbean situation in the
sixteenth century was the prelude to far-
reaching economic changes at world
level. For the moment the Caribbean is
relatively calm, and the main areas of
tension are in Central America.
However, according to those who think
like Arciniegas, a slight change in the
Caribbean chessboard could trigger off
irreversible changes comparable to those
in the Middle East.
Until 1763 the capital of Brazil was San
Salvador de Bahía de Todos os Santos,
today (known simply as Salvador) the
capital of the State of Bahia. With almost 2
million inhabitants, Salvador Is one ofBra¬
zil's most populous cities, and also the
most African in spirit it was a major
centre of the African slave trade. Famed
for its carnival, Salvador lives to the
rhythm of music and dances which also
display a strong African influence. The
historic centre of Salvador with its
seemingly innumerable churches, con¬
vents, palaces and mansions, is a show¬
case ofBrazilian art. The Brazilian Govern¬
ment has asked Unesco for help in pre¬
serving and restoring this outstanding
complex of monuments which was in¬
cluded on Unesco's World Heritage List in
1985. Above, a view of Salvador's

### 71618: Three continents, one people; American Indians, Europeans and Africans have shaped the destiny of Brazil

Three continents , one people
American Indians, Europeans and Africans
have shaped the destiny of Brazil
by Carlos Rodrigues Brandäo
IN the main square of Goiânia, capital of
the State of Goiás in the Centre West
of Brazil, stands a monument which
commemorates the founding of the town
less than fifty years ago. Three great male
figures cast in bronze support a massive
stone monolith. Since they are not wearing
distinctive clothing, only at close quarters
can they be seen to represent an Indian, a
Black and a White.
Similar monuments, on a smaller scale,
probably exist throughout the country.
They all reflect the widespread belief that
for many years was championed by landed
proprietors, fed by the popular imagination
and propagated by Brazilian history
books that the country's history and cul¬
ture were, and continue to be, the work of
"three races": Indians, the original inhabi¬
tants of Brazil; Blacks brought from Africa;
and Whites, the first of whom arrived from
Portugal in 1500.
In the 1960s, the National Council for the
Protection of Indians, as it was then called, ^
The Black slaves who were transported to
Brazil were compelled to accept Catholic
Christianity, but they did not forget their
own gods. In their prayers they assimi¬
lated their fertility goddess Yemanya to
the Virgin Mary, the god Oxala to the infant
Jesus, Exu to the devil. In secret theyprac¬
tised African rituals resembling the
voodoo cults of the Caribbean. These
practices were at the origin of the candom-
blé and the macumba, Brazilian dances
which are also celebrations of syncretic
religious cults. The first candomblé (the
word originally meant a ritual African
society) was founded in Salvador In the
early 19th century by Yorubas from West
Africa and the ritual is still deeply im¬
planted in this old Afro-Brazilian city (up¬
perphoto). The macumba flourishes in the
Rio de Janeiro region and southern Brazil.

### 71618: Three continents, one people; American Indians, Europeans and Africans have shaped the destiny of Brazil

estimated their number at 250,000. As in all
the countries of the continent, the indig¬
enous population of Brazil dwindled con¬
siderably during the colonization period, a
trend which persists today. In 1900 there
were some 230 indigenous tribes; by 1957
only 143 were left, a number which has not
decreased since then. Thus in fifty-seven
years, eighty-seven tribal groups dis¬
appeared individuals, tribes, villages,
ways of life, languages, dialects and
cultures.
Brought from Africa on slave ships, men,
women and children entered Brazil mainly
through the ports of Bahia and Rio de
Janeiro, whence they were dispatched
either to the great sugar plantations or,
later, the coffee plantations, or else to the
gold and gemstone mines in the regions
which now correspond approximately to the
States of Mato Grosso, Goiás and Minas
Gerais.
Through ignorance or perversity, the col¬
onizing Whites labelled as "Indian" a varied
range of indigenous cultures and peoples,
just as they used the blanket-term "Black"
for those who had been uprooted from
widely differing peoples, tribes and cultures
in Africa. The Africans who came to Brazil
included Muslim Blacks from Mali as well
as members of tribal groups from widely-
separated regions with completely different
forms of social organization, language, cul¬
ture and religion Yoruba, Dahomey,
Fanti and Ashanti, Hausa, Mandingo and
Bantu. From the earliest days of slavery in
Brazil, the White masters set out to convert
the imported slaves to Christianity and to
intermingle them in such a way that only
Blacks totally unknown to one another
would be living on the same plantation or in
the same inland city.
Slave labour was not evenly spread
throughout Brazil. Blacks from Africa
played a greater part in the settlement of the
coast than in that of the interior, and estab¬
lished themselves more in the Northeast
and East than in the Amazonian regions of
the North. They were concentrated in wide
areas of Bahia and Minas Gerais and were
never numerous in the north of Paraná oí in
Santa Catarina. These two regions were
among those initially settled by poor white
farmers, the caipiras (peasants) and Sertäo-
dwellers, then later by European immi¬
grants (Italians, Germans, Poles and
others), who to a large extent came to re¬
place the Black slave labour force when the
economic interests of the land-owners no
longer dictated the production of wealth
based exclusively on the slave system.
To what extent did each of these different
ethnic groups contribute to the develop¬
ment of Brazilian culture? The social con¬
tribution made by Indians, Blacks and
Whites was first and foremost natural rather
than cultural, for before becoming a nation
whose culture is to a great extent the out¬
come of combinations and exchanges
among different national and ethnic groups ,
Brazil was and still is a country whose
population is largely the result of mis¬
cegenation between these three main
human elements.
As in some other South American coun¬
tries, unlike the situation in, for example,
the United States, from the earliest days of
Portuguese colonization there was intensive
sexual intermingling between the "three
races", resulting in the emergence of a large
mestizo population. Brazil is thus not a
nation in which ethnic groups and cultures
have remained strictly separate from one
another. Nor is it a country where racial
interbreeding took place in one direction
only, for example between Indians and
Whites or between Whites and Blacks.
Here, mainly among the poor and power¬
less, there have always been liaisons and
marriages between Blacks and Whites, be¬
tween Indians and Whites, and between
Blacks and Indians. In each region there are
specific names for the ethnic types resulting
from such interbreeding. But, as a general
rule, the word mulatto is used to designate
someone with one Black and one White
parent, caboclo for a person born to an
Indian and a White, and mameluco (a less
common term, corresponding to a rarer
type of union) for the son or daughter of a
Black and an Indian. It is no exaggeration to
say that the Brazilian nation is the product
of ethnic intermixture, even if there is sup¬
posed to be a majority of Whites (although
this is considered to be debatable by some
observers), especially in the cities of the
South.
Those who lay stress on the important
modernizing influence of the wave of Euro¬
pean immigration in the late nineteenth and
early twentieth centuries which mainly
affected the prosperous and industrialized
regions of the South obscure the fact that
the pushing back of national frontiers to the
North and West was largely due to the slow
and indefatigable work of the poor mestizo
people. History has forgotten that it was
they who conquered, in their fashion, the
most remote and hostile regions of Brazil.
While nearly all the Amazon Basin (an
area the size of Europe, excluding Russia) is
a "product" of the colonizing work of poor
and landless caboclos, most of "Brazilian
baroque" culture is the creation of genera¬
tions of mulatto artists. The sculptors (such
as o Áleijadinho) , painters, poets and musi¬
cians who produced the first authentically
Brazilian high culture in Minas Gerais were
children of Whites and Blacks, some of
them slaves. In the colonial period , as later,
neany all the artists and craftsmen were
Black slaves or mestizos, as educated and
wealthy Portuguese or Brazilian Whites
conspicuously dissociated themselves from
productive work.
It is very difficult to attribute a specific
cultural contribution to Indians or to Blacks
in this vast country which has always been
dominated by Whites. We have attempted
to show that in Brazil there has never been
an abstract category of "Indians" or
another, equally abstract, category of
"Blacks", but different nations, peoples,
groups and individuals who represent in
concrete terms what it means to "be Indian"
or to "be Black" in Brazil.
Their contributions took a variety of
forms, according to the pattern of events in
each region and the way in which economic,
political and cultural relations were built up
among the different ethnic groups. Thus the

### 71625: Clothesline literature: stories told on a shoestring

Clothesline literature by Clelia Pisa
Stories told on a shoestring
MOST of the small booklets or
folhetos, which constitute what
is known as literatura de cordel
or "clothesline literature" are master¬
pieces of Brazilian popular art. Their for¬
mat is small (11 x 15 centimetres) and
they have between 8 and 16 or 32 and 48
pages. They are printed on ordinary
paper, with pale-coloured jackets. The
wood engravings forming the frontis¬
pieces illustrate the story inside. Folhetos
have been produced since the end of the
last century, originally in northeastern
Brazil where they were sold at markets,
cattle fairs, sugar mills and other centres
of economic activity.
The folhetos have changed since those
days. Now, some of their covers have
photographs instead of engravings, and
they have been influenced by modern
reproduction techniques. However, to¬
day as in the past, the authors of the
stories inside are poets. They write in
Colour page left: display of "clothesline

of string from which they take their name,
literatura de cordel (literally "string liter¬
ature"). Each booklet contains a popular
story whose theme Is evoked in the cover

four-, six- or ten-line stanzas, and rhyme
is all-important. To get people to buy the
booklets, the poet himself, or a book¬
seller, declaims just enough of the text to
whet the curiosity of passers-by, so that
only the purchasers will ever know how
the story ends. The vendors often display
their wares by attaching them to lengths
of rope or string, like clothes hung out to
dry, whence the name literatura de cordel
by which they are known in Brazil.
The subject-matter varies enormously,
ranging from accounts of political events
to epics containing echoes of the Chanson
de Roland, the Roman de la Rose or the
Roman de Renart or, more topically, of
the visit of Pope John Paul II to Brazil or
a trip to the moon. The ideas behind them
are often conventional: the established
order is respected, good always triumphs
and punishment is meted out to wrong¬
doers. The authors, publishers and retail¬
ers of the folhetos are simple folk who
would never dream of breaking rules.
However, the texts are not entirely of
their own choosing and, as we shall see,
some have tried and still do to infil¬
trate a message into the folhetos. This, is
because the folhetos have such a wide
following that they attract greedy eyes.
To take one example, some 3 million
copies have been printed of the hundred-
odd folhetos about Padre Cicero, a village
"miracle-worker".
Although individual authors some¬
times print and market their own work
with the help of their wives and children,
specialized folheto publishers (folhe-
terias) have existed for many years. These
publishing houses, located in seven cities
in northeastern Brazil, print and distri¬
bute work by many poets. However, the
mass exodus of workers to Brazil's south¬
ern States in search of employment has
changed the situation. The State of Säo
Paulo, Brazil's richest, today has over
one million of these "immigrants" and a
large folheto publishing company has
been established there.
Neither the poets nor the illustrators
make fortunes out of their work. Some
folheto authors have steady jobs with
small radio stations. It must be remem¬
bered that folhetos are not only read but
recited, and the rhymed verse can give a
new slant to news with which people may
already be familiar. In the early 1980s,
there were some 2,500 "practising" poets
working for radio stations, travelling
around to fairs, and so on.
The Brazilian authorities and the Ro¬
man Catholic Church were quick to grasp
the importance of the folheto as a vehicle
for ideas, proposals and reforms. By the
1940s, government agencies were already
making widespread use of them five
titles were published on Getúlio Vargas,
the then President of the Republic.
When folhetos are funded by official
bodies, Catholic associations and univer¬
sities, the poets are commissioned to
communicate to the general public such j

### 71626: The Concrete poetry movement

The concrete poetry movement
by Severo Sarduy
FROM its beginnings in a small, privately
printed review launched in Säo Paulo in
1952 and the work of its three founding
poets, Haroldo de Campos (born Sao Paulo,
1929), his brother Augusto (1931), and Décio
Pignatari (1927), Brazil's concrete poetry
movement, concretismo, which was actually a
whole new way of looking not only at poetry but at
life itself went on to make its mark all over the
world.
The review, Noigandres, is now a coveted
collector's item. Rather unexpectedly, the aes¬
thetic ideas it championed first had a response in
the Federal Republic of Germany, in the work of
Max Bense, who had come to concrete poetry
thanks to the Swiss-Bolivian poet Eugen Gom-
ringer, who himself had become a founder-
discoverer of the movement through a chance
meeting with Décio Pignatari. The movement
next found an echo in the work of the Japanese
poet Kitasono Katsue, before conquering that
nomadic and universal land, the printed page.
How should we define concrete poetry and its
essence, concretud (concreteness)? Instead of
being a poem in the conventional sense, a con¬
crete poem is akin to a diagram or drawing, a
pattern on the printed page which forcefully and
efficiently represents not only objects or con¬
cepts but the relationship between them, the
invisible structures of sound and meaning that
bind them together, their hidden affinities or anta¬
gonisms. What is more, as Guillaume Apollinaire
put it, writing must be understood in analytical
and discursive terms before its all-embracing
ideographic message can be understood. For
example, the poem reproduced here, Epithala-
mium-ll, by the concrete poet Pedro Xisto, en¬
capsulates the story of Paradise and enables it to
be grasped at a glance, consisting as it does of a
HE, a SHE and an "S" representing the devious
serpent, but also of an "H" (for homo, in other
words Adam) and an "E" for Eve, positioned
symmetrically and indissolubly bound together
by the serpent, just as in the Garden of Eden. The
Epithalamium (1966), a concrete poem
by Pedro Xisto.
reader is obviously free to interpret the scene in
his or her own way, and thereby join in the
process of poetic creation.
However, according to Haroldo de Campos,
the Pound-like patriarch of the movement and its
chief theorist, concretismo is not merely "a hedo¬
nistic graphic arrangement or layout", nor a cal¬
ligramme in which words are transformed into
¡mages of the things they designate (the word
"rose" actually becoming a rose). In concrete
poetry words are dismantled and modified so
that we can see what they are made of, like a
complex toy taken to pieces by a wayward child.
In short, the poet becomes a "designer" of
meaning.
The term concretismo is taken from the plastic
arts, and designates non-figurative, geometric
and rational compositions in which the key fea¬
ture is the objective technique with which they
were produced, and a clearly defined icon-like
image drained of any residual emotion or subjec¬
tive content, rather than any message or percep¬
tion of the "other" reality, which such works might
have managed to convey.
©
The poetic movement adopted the theoretical
tenets of this style of painting and even ex¬
panded on them: when in 1955 Eugen Gom-
ringer was introduced to Décio Pignatari by the
Argentine theorist and teacher Tomás Maldon-
ado, he was the secretary of the Swiss graphic
artist, architect and designer Max Bill, then direc¬
tor of the College of Design in Ulm (Fed. Rep. of
Germany). Above all, however, concretismo
delved back into an area of the Brazilian past that
had been overlooked or unintentionally under¬
rated. This was the subversive tradition which
began with the Modernists around 1911,
reached its climax in the 1930s with Carlos
Drummond de Andrade and Murilo Mendes, and
continued as far as Joäo Cabrai de Meló Neto.
But the concrete poets went even further: they
took over the broken and violent diction of
Oswald and Mario de Andrade, the "cannibalist
forefathers", as Haroldo de Campos called them,
and went back even further to rediscover the
authentically revolutionary modern idiom of
Sousândrade (Joaquim de Sousa Andrade,
1833-1902), a great poet who had been com¬
pletely forgotten. In 1877, this contemporary of
Baudelaire, who lived in the United States for ten
years, wrote what Haroldo de Campos regards
as the foundation stone of concretud: a long
poem entitled Oguesa errante, which culminates
in an astonishing sequence "Wall Street
Hell" which might be described as textual mar¬
quetry or polyphony, in which layout, neol¬
ogisms, verbal montage and sudden changes in
tone evoke the newspapers of that period and
the hectic world of the stock market. It is a
typographical explosion in a pre-Poundian ex¬
panding universe.
This, then, is Brazilian concrete poetry. It is
poetry at its most modern and most aggressively
international, and yet poetry securely attached to
its roots: the authentic voice of Brazil.
SEVERO SARDUY, a Cuban writer who lives in
France, is the author of a number of novels,
poems and essays. His works include Cobra and

BRAZIL was born singing. Flowing
through the veins of this "sub¬
continent" is the lifeblood of a
mingled ethnic heritage. From the Indi¬
ans, the original inhabitants, came tribal
choirs and vocal groups singing in coun¬
terpoint to the loud and clear rhythms of
work, festivity and suffering. From the
Portuguese invaders came plaintive and
nostalgic stringed instruments, hymns
lamenting their exile and songs in
celebration of bloodthirsty conquest.
From the Black slaves, bound by their
chains, came chants of forced labour,
conveying the hidden message of struggle
and resistance, and the wild batuque
dance of revolt and passion. Held in the
grip of these discordant influences, it was
impossible for Brazil to create a har¬
mony. Were we to plot, however sketch-
ily, a map of its songs and dances, its
rhythms and melodies, we would find
that there is almost as wide a variety of
musical languages as there are cultural
microcosms in this vast country.

lightning speed and are lost in a spate of
verbal dexterity culminating in the
tongue-twisting embolada. Equally typic¬
al is the bitter Northeast of the toada, the
monotonous chanting of the inhabitants
of the Sertâo forced to emigrate from
their arid lands, in contrast to the spell
cast by the medieval puluxia from the

incelênçia (funeral song), the lowing of
the cattle and the gentle rustle of the
grasslands.
The main sources of this musical tor¬

Sertâo down to the sea, are the coastal

adapted the folklore of the street-ven¬
dors' cries and of the sambas1 to the pulse
of the industrial era. The delightful har¬
monies he produced from his violin pro¬
vided the model for the vocal and in¬
strumental bossa nova2 with which his
fellow-Banian Joäo Gilberto introduced
music that was Modernist in inspiration.
A second focal point of cultural influ¬
ence for the emergence of all these trends
was to be the city of Rio de Janeiro. It was
not by chance that it came to be the
country's second capital, from 1763 to
1960, in succession to Salvador, which
had performed that role from 1549 to
1763, and that it had the same mixed
population. After all, it was in Rio in
the very centre of the city, in the house of
a set of festive Bahians that the samba,
the basic feature of the country's music,
was born. The samba rhythm, which was
derived from the African lundo and had
the same origins as the maxixe, was
eventually expelled physically from its
place of birth. However it continued to
follow the route taken by the poverty-
stricken and established itself in the
foothills of the morros the mountains
surrounding Rio where the first samba
schools were founded.
The samba schools are local social
organizations which are instrumental in
promoting the city's annual costume and
mask parade, headed by an intricately
interweaving pattern of samba dancers.
With the creation of a music industry
(factories manufacturing records, radios,
and subsequently television sets), the so-
called samba de morro can be said to have
gone downtown. It is accordingly no
longer a code of conduct or way of eking
out a living for popular poets, but has
entered the "literate" sphere of
bourgeois writers like Ary Barroso, the
author of the celebrated Brazilian Water-
colour, or Joäo de Barro, to whom we
owe, among other works, Rio's signature
tune Copacabana, Little Princess of the
Sea.
It was the samba, coupled with post¬
war North American jazz, which gave
rise to the bossa nova, the rhythm of
which also owes something to the aud¬
acious skills of Ravel, Debussy and
Chopin. The composer Antonio Carlos
(Tom) Jobim, a pupil of the German
theorist Hans Joachim Koellreutter, a re¬
fugee from Nazism who settled in Brazil
in 1937, joined with the poet and diplo¬
mat Vinicius de Moraes in creating a set
of harmonic progressions that were to
change Brazilian music, instrumental and
vocal alike. Through the bossa nova
movement, composers and artists like
Baden Powell or the dissident Jorge
Ben who also mixed the samba with the
blues as well as Edu Lobo and Sergio
Ricardo, who composed the sound tracks
for Glauber Rocha's films, were all in¬
volved in changing both the form and the
socio-political content of Brazilian
musical discourse.
Even the harsh northeastern songs of
Geraldo Vandré took the path of the
orchestral avant-garde under the impetus
of the resourceful Quarteto Novo, at
least two of whose members succeeded in
absorbing some of the most progressive
currents of jazz. These were the percus¬
sionist Airto Moreira, with his discovery
of the unusual sounds he could make with
an ass's jawbone, and Hermeto Pascoal,
described by Miles Davis as "the world's
most impressive musician", who con¬
ducted a symphony of sounds on a series
of receptacles filled with stones and
turned a set of cheap carafes into "wind
instruments".
Following in the footsteps of the musi¬
cian Baden Powell and the path opened
up by the bossa nova from 1958 to 1965,
Chico Buarque de Hollanda (born 1944)
gave a fresh lease of life to the samba by
devising an original combination of the
musical language of the morro foothills
with urban satire. For their part, Gilberto

^ Gil and Caetano Veloso, both of whom
were born in 1942 and were "launched"
by the same television festivals as had
contributed to the fame of Chico Buar¬
que, picked up, each in his own way, the
musical threads laid down by Caymmi
and Joäo Gilberto. They also created a
cultural movement, known as Tropicalis-
mo, that was closely related to the paint¬
ing of Hélio Oiticica, the Cinema Novo
(see article page 33) of Glauber Rocha,
and the "cannibal theatre" of José Celso
Martinez Correa. Notwithstanding its
brief existence, from 1967 to 1969, the
movement reconciled the country's tradi¬
tions of critical revisionism, steeped in
the literary irony of the drama, poetry
and prose of the Modernist writer Oswald
de Andrade, with the "concrete" poetry
of the Futurist Décio Pignatari and the
brothers Augusto and Haroldo de
Campos.
This approach also incorporated the
aesthetics of the "popular bad taste" of
the idols of Brazilian music-hall and the
international style of the Beatles, and
combined discontinuities and silences
like those of Stockhausen, or sound
effects as in the work of John Cage, with
the langorous melodies of long-ago sam¬
bas. Rogério Duprat, the main orchestra-
tor of Tropicalismo, which featured
singers of the importance of Gal Costa
and Maria Bethania, was also a pupil of
Koellreutter. Moreover, since there is
always a master "arranger" in the many
different schools of Brazilian music, it is
useful to take a look at the instrumental
heritage known as the choro.3
3. Choro (literally "lament") is a Brazilian musical
genre. The word can also denote a group of musicians.
Editor.
The word chow was first used to de¬
note a mixture of European genres, in¬
cluding the schottische, waltz, tango, pol¬
ka and habanera, by Alfredo da Rocha
Viana Filho, known as Pixinguinha
(1898-1973). Through his work with a
variety of orchestral ensembles and his
patient transcription of the oral music of
self-taught composers, Pixinguinha laid
down the parameters of Brazilian musical
tradition. His baton charted the path
taken by the country's music from the
brass-dominated marchinha of carnival
time to the feverish sounds of the military
bands of Pernambuco , and from the mod-
inha, a legacy of the Portuguese court
related to the fado, to moonlight ser¬
enades in the suburbs. This is the origin of
Abre Alas, the first piece of carnival
music involving a literal host of musical
instruments. The leading composer of
"serious" music in Brazil, Heitor Villa-
Lobos (1887-1959), was a friend and con¬
temporary of Pixinguinha, and indeed
wrote a celebrated series of works known
as Choros.
An equally fundamental feature of the
structure of Brazilian popular orchestra¬
tion is the percussion accompaniment
which came to be added to the ensembles
of violins, cellos and violas in the shape of
small drums improvised from all kinds of
kitchen utensils and metal tools. The
most famous example of this is the
arrangement for Brazilian Watercolour.
Although this important musical cur¬
rent has branched out in countless direc¬
tions, it has also been enriched by con¬
tributions from different regions, such as
the church music composed by slaves and
transcribed by Milton Nascimento, who
was born in Rio but received his musical
education in the religious processions of

of "serious" music in Brazil. Asa musician
he was largely self-taught, and for several
years travelled throughout Brazil, asso¬
ciating with wandering folk musicians and
discovering the wealth of Brazilian folk¬
lore with which his music is suffused. The
best-known works of this prolific compos¬
er are a series bearing the generic title
Choros, and Bachianas brasileiras, a set
of pieces in which a contrapuntal tech¬
nique in the manner ofJ.S. Bach is applied
to themes of Brazilian origin. In photo, left,
taken in New York in 1957, Villa-Lobos is
seen with three percussion instruments
used in Brazilian popular music: on the
piano is an afoxé, a gourd covered by a
lattice of beads; he is holding a chocalho,
a kind of sleigh-bell, and a reco-reco, a
grooved piece of bamboo which is

northeastern coco of Jackson do Pan-
deiro in the electronic style of contem¬
porary rock. Songs composed in Brazil
respond to the clash of stimuli between
the country's oral and choreographic
traditions and the worldwide community.
Thus, with such an open-minded out¬
look, mambo and rock turn up in the
music of the quintessentially Brazilian
Chico Buarque just as bossa nova
rhythms appear in the numbers of such
British groups as Style Council and
Everything But a Girl, and some Euro¬
pean brass bands include A Banda, again
by Buarque, in their conventional
repertoires.
The litany intoned by the Portuguese
priests as they taught the catechism could
be combined with the Indian choirs to
produce a number of Sertâo viola pieces,
but there are other even more eloquent
examples of borrowing from this Third
World songbook. Frank Sinatra has sung
Tom Jobim's The Girlfrom Ipanema and
One Note Samba; the Modern Jazz Quar¬
tet has recorded Bachiana No. 5 by Villa-
Lobos; La Casa, music written by Vini-
cius de Moraes for Brazilian children, is a
success in Italy, just as Rita Lee's Brazi¬
lian-style rock is popular in France. In¬
deed, as Caetano Veloso thunders in one
of his latest hits, written in the "rap" style
of the Blacks of Brooklyn: "E deixa os

### 71628: Cinema Novo: a cultural revolution on the screen

'Cinema Novo
A cultural revolution
on the screen
by Paulo Antonio Paranaguá
The Black, the peasant, the favelado
(shanty-town dweller) and the Indian are
"outsiders" who have been brought to life
on the screen by Cinema Novo. This scene
is from Carlos Diegues's film A grande
cidade (1966).
'C
INEMA Novo', or the New
Cinema of Brazil, was hailed
by its main spokesman and
theorist, the Brazilian director Glauber
Rocha, as an authentic revolution in both
expression and production, two closely
connected aspects of an art which is also
an industry.
Expression. Forty years after the Brazi¬
lian Modernist movement of 1922
attempted to lay the foundations of a
distinct Brazilian aesthetic in literature
and the plastic arts, Cinema Novo aspired
to define a truly Brazilian form of ex¬
pression in film. Hitherto, Brazilian film¬
makers had contented themselves with
local themes and characters, and in the
process of film-making itself, usually con
sidered as a purely technical operation,
had stuck to the conventional formulae of
Hollywood and the European cinema.
They turned out comedies, melodramas
and musical comedies replete with clichés
inherited from the dominant modes of
film production. In this way a dichotomy
between form and content was created,
and film-makers had no choice but to
present local reality through established
cinematographic conventions which they
regarded as ideal.
Cinema Novo transformed this situa¬
tion by seeking to develop a Brazilian
film language which would be in harmony
with the other forms of expression of
Brazilian culture and particularly with
the most innovative creative trends in
narrative, drama, the plastic arts and
music.
The best example of that stylistic in¬
novation, and of a form of nationalism
which by no means implies xenophobia or
a rejection of foreign influences, is still
Deus e o diabo na terra do sol ("Black
God White Devil"), made by Glauber
Rocha in 1963. This film succeeds in
integrating a whole series of disparate
elements: the montage technique of

spection of Stanislavsky and the distanc¬
ing of Brecht; the choral complexity of
opera; the lyricism of the Bachianas bra¬
sileñas of Villa-Lobos and the simplicity
of folk melodies; specific details about
Rocha's native region; and the general
problems of underdevelopment.
Glauber Rocha interwove all these ele¬
ments to produce an original, personal
creation, just as a writer such as Guimar¬
äes Rosa used the folk themes and tradi¬
tions of his own region. Glauber Rocha
showed that this approach was suitable
not only for analysing bygone situations
and handling traditional issues, but also
for describing the modern world. His film
Terra em transe ("Earth Entranced") of
1967 is a dissection of the political world
at that time, showing the manipulations
of populism, the messianic temptation of
guerrilla warfare and the conflicts
between élites. It contributed to the
national debate with an acuteness and
lucidity seldom achieved on film.
Production. Here too Cinema Novo re¬
jected imitation, which had hitherto been
regarded as inevitable in film production.
This innovatory movement emerged
from critical thinking about the failure of
attempts to transplant to Brazil the kind
of film industry found in the industrially
developed countries. The colonization of
the Brazilian cinema was not only a con¬
sequence of the domination of the market
by foreign output; it was also an alienat¬
ing attempt to transplant a method of
production-line filming in vast studios
with large teams of technicians, based on
the star system and the conventions of the
Hollywood film.
The new Brazilian cinema took under¬
development as its starting point and de¬
vised production formulae which were
better suited to the circumstances. It re¬
turned to the tradition of craftsmanship
established by the pioneers of film, abo¬
lished the frontiers between fiction and
documentary, and explored new chan¬
nels of distribution.
Because of these two revolutionary de¬
partures, in expression and in produc¬
tion, Cinema Novo stood out as an
alternative model for the emergent cine¬
mas of Latin America and the Third
World as a whole, as did its quest for
paths to economic and ideological decol¬
onization. Glauber Rocha expounded
the theory of the movement in such mani¬
festos as Urna estética da forne ("An Aes¬
thetics of Hunger") and Urna estética da
violencia ("An Aesthetics of Violence",
1965), and in many articles collected in
his book Revoluçâo do Cinema Novo
("The Revolution of Cinema Novo",
1981), which had a worldwide impact.
Nevertheless, this new approach to
film-making was not so much a formal
school as a movement for those who re
jected dogmatism. Although the influ¬
ence of Neorealism can be seen in such
early works as Nelson Pereira dos San¬
tos's Rio 40 graus ("Rio, 40 Degrees",
1955) and Rio zona norte ("Rio Northern
District", 1957), Cinema Novo diverged
from Neorealism and was fundamentally
in sympathy with Luis Buñuel's criticism
of the sentimentality of post-war Italian
cinema, while also rejecting the
stereotypes and Manichaeism of socialist
realism.
Pluralism. Cinema Novo's aesthetic
"non-alignment" was a guarantee of plur¬
alism and respect for the different out¬
looks and stylistic approaches of the film¬
makers, who freely claimed full responsi¬
bility for their films. The northeastern
region of Rocha's "Black God White
Devil" inspired such different and highly
personal films as Os fuzis ("The Rifles",
1964) by Ruy Guerra, Vidas secas ("Bar¬
ren Lives", 1963) by Nelson Pereira dos
Santos, and Säo Bernardo ("Saint Ber¬
nard", 1971) by Leon Hirszman. Joaquim
Pedro de Andrade swung from the unpre¬
tentious lyricism of O padre e a moça
("The Priest and the Girl", 1966) to the
unbridled tropicality of Macunaima
(1969). Cinema Novo explored urban life
in A grande cidade ("The Big City", 1966)
by Carlos Diegues, Ruy Guerra's Os
cafajestes ("The Beach of Desire", 1962),
and the mythical world of the Indians in |
Nelson Pereira dos Santos, a precursor of
the Brazilian Cinema Novo, belongs to a
generation influenced by the novels of
Jorge Amado and Graciliano Ramos. He
adapted two of Ramos's novels for the
screen: Vidas secas (1963), the story of a
family forced to leave their landbecause of
drought, and Memorias do cárcere (1984)
about the experiences of the great Brazi¬
lian writer during his time in prison. Right,

de Deus ("Uirá, an Indian in Search of
God", 1974), and portrayed the political
bewilderment of intellectuals in Paulo
César Saraceni's O desafio ("The Chal¬
lenge", 1965).
Cinema Novo was contemporary with
the French nouvelle vague, the indepen¬
dent cinema of North America, British
free cinema, Spanish and Argentine
nuevo cine, Cuban revolutionary cinema,
the birth of Black African cinema and
movements of renewal in countries as
different as Japan and Czechoslovakia.
Nevertheless, its true significance can
only be appreciated in the context of
Brazilian culture. The crisis in the tradi¬
tional production system created a cli¬
mate in which the new Brazilian cinema
and similar movements could be wel
comed and could achieve international
success.
The history of Brazilian cinema can be
summed up in two words: "before" and
"after" Cinema Novo. It must also be said
that our past would have slipped into
oblivion had it not been for the sense of
historical perspective created by Cinema
Novo, which enabled such masterpieces
of Brazilian cinema as Humberto
Mauro's Ganga bruta ("The Dross",
1933) and Mario Peixoto's Limite
("Boundary", 1929) to be saved for pos¬
terity. Glauber Rocha himself wrote a
Revisäo critica do cinema brasileiro ("Cri¬
tical Review of the Brazilian Cinema") in
1963. If Cinema Novo had not made a
breakthrough into modernity, Brazilian
cinema would have faded out, or would
have continued to languish in mediocrity.
The emergence of Cinema Novo is a
landmark in our cultural tradition. Let us
hope that this tradition of creativity, high
standards and freedom will help Brazil to
respond to the new challenges of televi¬
sion and the audio-visual media in a way
that lives up to our current hopes for
change and democratic participation .

### 71630: Return ticket: the Brazilian arts make a 'come-back' to Portugal

r\í-kí~llT*H f'lf^k'í^f" by Fernando Alves Cristóváo
The Brazilian arts make a 'come-back' to Portugal
THE discovery of Brazil in 1500 was
followed by the arrival in 1549 of
the Jesuits, who founded their
first college on the future site of Säo
Paulo, and it was then that the teaching of
the Portuguese language, and of the
European cultural models for which it
was a medium, first became established
on Brazilian soil.
Young Brazilians taught by the Jesuits
finished their education at the University
of Coimbra in Portugal. Only after 1808,
when the Portuguese Court was transfer¬
red to Rio de Janeiro, were liberalization
measures adopted, including the opening
of ports, the founding of printing houses
and the establishment of facilities for
higher education. These measures did
much to facilitate direct contacts with
"the other Europe" , and particularly with
France.
Accordingly, the process of defining
and asserting an authentically Brazilian
identity began only in the nineteenth cen¬
tury, inspired by the ideals of Romanti¬
cism and by the proclamation of Brazilian
independence its scope, however, re¬
mained limilcd. Only with the Modernist
movement of 1922 would the ideals of
cultural emancipation emerge victorious
(see page 38) . It is therefore instructive to
analyse the attitudes of Portuguese intel¬
lectuals to the cultural changes that took
place in the Romantic and Modernist
periods, and to examine their receptive-
ness to influences that originated in
Brazil.
Literature was the first field in which
these influences were felt. The great
figures of Portuguese Romanticism
favoured the literary independence of
Brazil, even to the point of urging Brazi¬
lian writers to break out of the European
and Portuguese moald and draw inspira¬
tion from local themes. It would be many
years before the Brazilian variant of the
Portuguese language was accepted, a de¬
lay largely due to the linguistic theories
prevalent at the time. Paradoxically, the
Portuguese writers who urged the Brazi¬
lians to opt for literary originality would
also mock or strongly resist any attempt
at linguistic innovation. Brazilian Portu¬
guese was considered comical, and when
Portuguese writers used it in their work,
they put it into the mouths of uncouth or
ridiculous characters.
As a result, Portuguese grammarians
and writers engaged in bitter con¬
troversies with their colleagues on the
other side of the Atlantic, the most
famous being conducted from 1835 on¬
wards in the Jornal do Comercio and the
Minerva Brasiliense.
The turn of the century marked the
start of Portuguese recognition of the
"Brazilian variant" by the distinguished
philologist Leite de Vasconcelos. Only
since the 1940s, however, has it been
truly recognized and accepted, and it was
not until the mid-1970s, when the first
Brazilian serial was shown on Portuguese
television, that it really won popular
acclaim and prestige. It was subsequently
used in specific fields of communication
such as advertising and sports commen¬
taries, for which Brazilian terms and pro¬
nunciation were used and Brazilian com¬
mentators recruited.
This movement towards "dignifica-
tion" reached its apogee in the 1950s,
when Portuguese linguistics began to be
taught at the Universities of Coimbra and
Lisbon by Brazilian specialists such as
Mattoso Cámara, Serafim de Silva Neto,
Silvio Elia and Gladstone Chaves de
Poet and diplomat, Vinicius de Moraes
(1913-1980) bridged the gap between
poetry and music, between the formal
world of academic culture and the more
casual world of pop. Ariana, a mulher
(1936) was the high point ofhis early work,
which had mystical overtones. Later, in
Cinco elegías (1938) and Poemas, sonetos
e baladas (1948), he moved towards sen¬
suous lyricism , notably In his poem Re-
ceita de Mulher. His play Orfeu da con-
ceicäo (1956), formed the basis of the col¬
ourful evocation of Brazil in the French
director Marcel Camus' film, Orfeu negro
(1959; Black Orpheus;. In the late 1950s

became a bossa nova star. Right, during a

Melo. Negotiations with a view to an
agreement on spelling, which took place
in Rio de Janeiro in May 1986 with the
participation of delegates from the seven
Portuguese-speaking countries, gave the
final accolade to the linguistic variant and
placed it on an equal footing with other
languages.
As we have seen, recognition of Brazi¬
lian authors in Portugal came more
quickly than official acknowledgement of
their language, and had even more im¬
portant consequences. The literary origi-

### 71631: The Week of Modern Art, 1922: seven days that shook Brazilian culture

The Week of Modern Art, 1 922
Seven days that shook Brazilian culture
The "Week of Modern Art" held in Säo
Paulo in 1922 was a cultural gathering
which showed a desire to break away from
a colonial past that was felt to be alien to
the Brazilian situation. Below, The Rus¬
sian Student (1917) by Anita Malfatti, a
leading figure in the Modernist movement,
whose fauvist style caused a furore. Her
work was championed by an enthusiastic
group of artists and writers whose col¬
laboration illustrated the dialogue be¬
tween literature and the visual arts which
developed in Brazil during the first two
decades of the century and prepared the
ground for the Week of Modern Art.
THE idea of a new, contemporary Brazil was
launched during the "Week of Modern Art"
held in Sao Paulo from 13 to 17 February
1922. The impact of this event on Brazilian liter¬
ature, art and culture generally was so great that
it could be said to have lasted for the next thirty-
eight years, beginning with the lecture given by
the essayist and thinker José Pereira da Graça
Aranha in Sao Paulo on 13 February 1922, and
ending with the speech delivered by President
Juscelino Kubitschek when he proclaimed Brasi¬
lia capital of the Republic on 21 April 1960.
The "Week of Modern Art" was organized by
Brazilian artists, writers and composers in a bid
to instil a new spirit into artistic creation in Brazil
on the centenary of the country's independence.
Speaking at the Säo Paulo Municipal Theatre on
13 February 1922, Graça Aranha explained the
nature of the idéias novas, the new ideas that
were in the air: "The works presented here may
seem horrifying to many of you, but these out¬
landish paintings, this bewitching music and this
disjointed poetry all herald a marvellous dawn.
They represent the birth of art in Brazil."
The "Week of Modern Art" was an attempt to
break with a colonial past that was alien to the
Brazilian situation. While official academic paint¬
ing and sculpture were bogged down in natural¬
ism and idealism, and continued to deal with
historical, mythological and religious themes
reflecting the aesthetic values of nineteenth-
century Europe, literature was being stifled by
the language of the Parnassian movement.
Oswald and Mario de Andrade, on their return
from Europe, fought a courageous battle against
slavish adherence to the literary models of the
past, and in painting Anita Malfatti scandalized
the conformists who were blithely content with
imported forms of dull and pretentious art.
Above all, the break with the past entailed a
search for national identity. The memory of the
Amerindian and Afro-American past was re¬
vived, and roots that were both Brazilian and
American were uncovered. (During this period,
the architects Moya and Przyrembel were pro¬
ducing work that was Aztec in inspiration.)
Secondly, an attempt was made to bring Brazi¬
lian art up to date or rather to "modernize" it by
relating it to avant-garde movements in other
countries. Combining those apparently conflict¬
ing features meant engaging in "cannibalism".
The literary movement known as Antropofagia
("Cannibalism") that subsequently emerged was
based on the principle that Brazil should "gobble
up foreign avant-garde movements and adapt
them to Brazilian realities."
The "Week of Modern Art" thus ushered in the
new conception of creativity which is still a dis¬
tinctive feature of Brazilian art and literature
today. In poetry, Modernism was to put an end to
metre and rhyme and introduce free verse, collo¬
quial language and humour. Although it asserted
its own indigenous personality, it had no hesita¬
tion in adopting all the new literary techniques.
Thus, paradoxically, European avant-garde
movements began to play a decisive role in the
discovery of the New Brazil. In some cases these
movements had a direct influence Oswald de
Andrade introduced to Brazil the ideas of the
Futurist movement founded by Filippo Marinetti.
They also had more indirect effects, attracting
attention to everything that could be regarded as
specifically Brazilian it was in the studios of
Picasso and Brancusi and in the company of
Tristan Tzara and Blaise Cendrars that Mario de
Andrade discovered "primitivism". Fascinated
by the colonial past of Minas Gerais and by the
sculptures of o Aleijadinho ("the Little Cripple")
during a visit to Brazil in 1 924, Cendrars encour¬
aged the writers Oswald and Mario de Andrade
and the painter Tarsila do Amaral to seek the
roots of their own culture in their country's folk
traditions.
These new principles were affirmed through¬
out the 1 920s in the writings of Graça Aranha and
in Tarsila do Amaral's "tubist-tropical" paintings.
In 1924, the Pau-Brasil ("Brazilian Redwood")
literary manifesto drafted by Oswald de Andrade,
with its slogan "tupy or not tupy",1 marked the
beginning of an "exploratory poetry" which

looked to popular traditions and attempted to
create a synthesis between traditional culture
and modern technological society. This spirit
continued to flourish in the "Cannibalism"
movement, which published manifestos in 1928
and 1929 and set out to identify the origins of
pre-colonial Brazilian traditions by conducting
sociological studies on the Black and Indian
population and on forms of folklore and folk art.
In 1927-1928, the Russian-born architect
Gregori Warchavchick built Brazil's first Art Deco
house, the Villa Mariana in Säo Paulo. The new
architectural trend was stimulated by the visits to
Brazil of Le Corbusier in 1 929 and of Frank Lloyd
Wright in 1 931 , when Wright met Warchavchik
and his partner, the urban planner Lucio Costa.
Two years later an Exhibition of Tropical
Architecture was held in Rio de Janeiro and, in
1937, the design for the Ministry of Education
and Health building was commissioned from a
group of architects belonging to the new
movement. Among the collaborators on this pro¬
ject, directed by Le Corbusier, were Lucio Costa
and Oscar Niemeyer who, some twenty years
later, would create Brasilia, the first city of the
twenty-first century.
The aesthetic positions championed by the
"Week of Modern Art" fully corresponded to the
realities of the Brazilian situation. They reflected
the rapid industrialization that was transforming
this provincial society and sweeping away the
few remaining vestiges of the colonial ethic. The
impact of the population explosion in Rio de
Janeiro and Säo Paulo and of the waves of
immigrants who were changing the dynamics of
Brazilian society could be felt in the ferment of
artistic creation. The New ArtArte novo
would take up the challenges of a new society
and new cities whose emergence it would actu¬
ally anticipate and prefigure. It would merge into
a single stream the currents of internal migration
that would create twentieth-century Brazil; it
would blend into a single national identity Brazil's
historical roots and the ideas of modern Europe.
This was the "New Brazil", of which Brasilia
sought to be the expression.

nality of these authors was consolidated
by the Modernist movement of 1922.
Later, the reputation of Brazilian authors
in Portugal made gradual, if irregular,
progress as a result of work by populariz¬
es writing in newspapers and magazines.
In the first quarter of the century, Olavo
Bilac and Coelho Neto were already
popular in Portugal, although, paradox¬
ically, Castro Alves and Machado de
Assis were virtually unknown.
The 1940s were the decisive years in
determining cultural relations between
the two countries. This was largely due to
the boom in Portuguese-language Brazi¬
lian magazines, which had begun in the
1930s, and above all to the prestige of
novelists such as Erico Verissimo, José
Luis do Rego, Jorge Amado and Graci-
liano Ramos, and of poets such as
Manuel Bandeira, Jorge de Lima, Cecilia
Meireles and Carlos Drummond de
Andrade.
Many Brazilian novelists and poets began
to win a reputation in Portugal with the
proliferation of Portuguese-language Bra¬
zilian magazines in the 1930s. One conspi¬
cuous example was the poet Manuel Ban¬
deira (1886-1968). In such poems as Vou-
me embora pra Pasárgada (1954; "I'm
going to Pasargadae"), this master of
colloquial language and irony created
myths which are nowpart of the collective
poetic heritage. An evocation of Pasarga¬
dae, the legendary city of Cyrus the Great,
forms a setting for this pen and inkportrait
of Bandeira (left) by the Brazilian artist
Cicero Dias.
Carlos Drummond de Andrade, right (born
Minas Gerais, 1902) is a leading contem¬
porary Brazilian poet. His work, which has
evolved from political commitment to iro¬
nic and disillusioned detachment, springs
from a close and penetrating scrutiny of
the texture of everyday life. He is a story¬
teller and chronicler as well as a poet.
Notable among his works are A rosa do
povo (1945; "People's Rose"), Fazendeiro
do ar (1954; "Farmer of the Air") and Liçâo
de coisas (1962; "A Lesson of Things").

### 71630: Return ticket: the Brazilian arts make a 'come-back' to Portugal

### 71632: UNESCO and Brazilian literature

Jorge Amado (born 1912, pictured here in
1970), the son ofa Bahian planter, is prob¬
ably the best-known Brazilian writer out¬
side Brazil. Written with a blendof fantasy,
realism and lyrical exuberance, his novels
are rooted in the Brazilian Nordeste, that
"violent land" of racial and cultural inter¬
mixture. Social and political commitment,
fundamental to his earlier novels such as
Jubiabá (1935), Mar Morto (1936; "Dead
Sea") and Terras do sem fin (1942; The
Violent Land, 1945), later gave way to a
more light-hearted vision of regional life
and to the creation of some extraordinary
female characters in Gabriela, cravo e
canela (1958; Gabriela, Clove and Cinna¬
mon, 1962), Dona Flor e seus dois maridos
(1966; Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands,
1969), Tereza Batista, cansada de guerra
(1972; "Tereza Batista, Weary of War") and
Tieta do Agreste (1977; Tieta, the Goat Girl,
1979).
The Portuguese critic Gaspar Simöes
was already wondering whether the influ¬
ence of the Brazilian Modernists was not
a reaction against that previously exer¬
cised from Portugal. But it was primarily
the novel of the Brazilian Northeast
which in the 1930s marked the historic
transition from a state of dependence to
the affirmation of cultural independence,
and must be given credit for turning the
tide of "influence" and altering the pat¬
tern of cultural interpénétration. With it,
for the first time, Brazilian literature
strongly influenced what was being writ¬
ten in Portugal. After 1940, such writers
as Jorge Amado, Graciliano Ramos and
José Lins do Regó contributed to the
emergence and development of Portu¬
guese Neorealism, both in the novel (par¬
ticularly in the work of Alves Redol and
Manuel da Fonseca) and in the poetry of
the novo cancioneiro. This Brazilian in¬
fluence recognized by critics, novelists
and poets had an early impact on ex¬
perimental poetry and concrete poetry in
Portugal.
This cultural backlash, or swing of the
pendulum, has been felt not only in lan¬
guage and literature but elsewhere in the
arts, although on a smaller scale. Admit¬
tedly, it has been of minor importance in
the plastic arts although there are paint¬
ings by Candido Portinari in Lisbon's
National Museum of Contemporary Art,
and other Brazilian painters such as
Cicero Dias, Moacir de Andrade and
Sérgio Telles regularly exhibit their work
in the Portuguese capital.
Brazilian influence has been stronger
in classical (Carlos Gómez, Heitor Villa-
Lobos) and popular music. So rapid was
the process of "tuning in" and adapting to
Brazilian music that in the 1930s the
Portuguese actress and singer Carmen
Miranda became an international symbol
of Brazilian rhythms. On Portuguese
radio Brazilian music has progressed
from the "Brazilian Half-hour" program¬
mes of 1942 to much longer periods on
the air, and today has a higher audience
rating than any other. Brazilian singing

### 71630: Return ticket: the Brazilian arts make a 'come-back' to Portugal

S> stars such as Chico Buarque, Maria
Bethania, Gal Costa and Caetano Veloso
often appear on the Portuguese stage.
Television has transformed and inten¬
sified these exchanges, which reached
their peak with the broadcasting of Brazi¬
lian television serials. In the milestone
year of 1976, Portuguese television began
to show Gabriela, cravo e canela ("Gab¬
riela, Clove and Cinnamon"), based on a
novel by Jorge Amado. This was the start
of an uninterrupted flow of Brazilian
serials, which have been so popular with
viewers that Portuguese TV has begun to
produce programmes of the same kind
but, it is generally agreed, of inferior
quality.
In the cinema, relations between Brazil
and Portugal have followed a similar
course to that followed in literature.
Initially, Portuguese films were made on
Brazilian themes. Leitâo de Barros made
Vendaval maravilhoso, his film about the
life of the poet Castro Alves, as early as
1944. But Brazilian films proper were
virtually unknown except to a small pub¬
lic of film enthusiasts and specialists. In
1971, the first Brazilian Film Festival was
held in Lisbon, and since then similar
festivals have taken place at regular inter¬
vals, most of them organized by the Gul-
benkian Foundation.
In the theatre it has been the same
story. At first Portuguese plays such as
the anti-slavery works of such
nineteenth-century authors as Gomes de
Amorim and José Agostinho Macedo
were written on Brazilian themes. Portu¬
guese drama companies were already
touring Brazil during the Romantic
period, but it was not until much later
that Brazilian troupes visited Portugal.
In 1966, the production in Portugal of
Joäo Cabrai de Meló Neto's Morte e vida
Severina ("Death and Life Severina")
triggered off debates which had a wide¬
spread cultural and social impact. Nowa¬
days the arrival of Brazilian theatrical
companies such as those of Tónia Carrero
or Ruth Escobar are eagerly awaited in
Portugal, as well as appearances on the
Portuguese stage by Brazilian actors such
as Paulo Autran and others who, though
less well known, have won popularity by
acting in television serials.
For all these reasons we should now
talk in terms of cultural intercommunica¬
tion between Portugal and Brazil; the
days of Brazilian cultural dependence, or
even of mutual indifference between the
two countries , are over.
FERNANDO A. CRISTOVAO, of Portugal, is
professor of Brazilian literature at the University
of Lisbon. He is also head of the Institute of
Portuguese Culture and Language at the Portu¬
guese Ministry of Education, and of the Institute
of Brazilian Culture at the Lisbon Faculty of
Letters. Notable among many works reflecting
his interest in intercultural communication, with
particular reference to the culture of Brazil, is
Cruzeiro do Sul a Norte (Cruise from South to
North, 1983), which was awarded the Casa-
grande e senzala Prize by the Joaquim Nabuco
Foundation of Brazil.


### 71633: Art for children, a UNESCO project

Art for children
A Unesco project
THE originality of the Arte para criança ("Art
for Children") project which was launched
by the Rio de Janeiro publishers Berlendis
and Vertecchia, with the collaboration of Un¬
esco's International Fund for the Promotion of
Culture, lies in the fact that the authors involved
use the work of a modern Brazilian artist as
inspiration for short imaginary letters, accounts
of dreams, poems and stories. The texts, which
do not refer directly to a given painting, are
intended to introduce young readers to the most
advanced and demanding forms of contempor¬
ary plastic art. In order to get as far away as
possible from the "cultural axis" of Rio and Säo
Paulo, artists and writers are selected to repre¬
sent each of Brazil's States. After publication of
their books, they go out and talk to schoolchil¬
dren about art and literature.
Notable among the works already published in
beautifully produced books with high-quality col¬
our reproductions, large type and heavy paper,
Figura (1964), one of 19 works by the Brazi¬
lian painter Milton Dacosta which pro¬
vided the inspiration for Era urna vez urna
menina ("Once upon a time there was a
little girl"), a fairy story by Walmir Ayala.
The story has appeared in a series of art
books for children published as part of a
project sponsored jointly by Unesco and
the Brazilian publishing house Berlendis
& Vertecchia Edltores of Rio de Janeiro.
are: Era urna vez, très... ("Once there were
Three ...") by Volpi, with texts by Ana Maria
Machado; O gato ("The Cat") by Claudio Zirotti
and Norma Freiré; and Sete cartas e dois sonhos
("Seven Letters and Two Dreams") by Tomie
Ohtake and Lygia Bojunga Nunes. One of the
biggest successes in the series is Capeta
Carybé ("Carybé the Devil"), which has repro¬
ductions of works by Carybé, one of the best-
known artists in Brazil today, and texts by the
equally famous writer Jorge Amado.
Among the many institutions collaborating on
this project are Brazil's Federal Cultural Coun¬
cils, the Ministry of Education and Culture, the
Museums of Modern Art of Rio de Janeiro and
Säo Paulo, Säo Paulo's Biennial Cultural Foun¬
dation, the Cultural Foundations of Brasilia and
Bahia, and the Culture Departments of the dif¬
ferent States.
In 1 986 and 1 987 the "Art for Children" series
is being shown at many international exhibitions
including the Children's Book Fair in Bologna,
the Paris Salon du Livre, the Triennial Festival of
Books and Newspapers in Belgrade, the
"World's Most Beautiful Books" exhibition in
Leipzig, and an exhibition being organized by the
Centre for Latin American Studies in Rome,
under the auspices of Unesco's International
Fund for the Promotion of Culture.
The sponsors of the project are currently trying
to arrange for the series to be distributed in
Portugal and the Portuguese-speaking countries
of Africa.

### 71636: The Wealth of a nation: facts and figures

The wealth ofa nation
Facts and figures
Rural development
Agriculture. Despite rapid industrial expan¬
sion in the last few years, agriculture still plays
a vital role in the Brazilian economy, corres¬
ponding to around 14 per cent of Gross
National Product (GNP), 47 per cent of ex¬
ports (including semi-manufactured goods),
and employing 44 per cent of the total work¬
force. Two-thirds of agricultural production
comes from crops, one-quarter from cattle,
and the remainder from forestry.
In spite of extensive modernization in re¬
cent years, agriculture still provides only a low
level of revenue in relation to capital invest¬
ment. Increased production is the result of an
increase in the amount of land under cultiva¬
tion, rather than higher productivity through
the use of machinery, or better quality seed or
fertilizer. Low productivity has always been
due to an excess of labour combined with
outmoded technology, and to restrictive sys¬
tems of land ownership, where the ground is
worked by primitive, often destructive,
methods.
However, Brazil has considerable agri¬
cultural potential: in addition to vast regions
suited to agriculture, there are the advantages
of a varied climate in a country which extends
from the tropics to the temperate zone.
However, only a third of this land is currently
exploited, and of this only a small part is
cultivated.
Agriculture provides for the vast majority
(95 per cent) of the country's food re¬
quirements. In this respect Brazil is practically
self-sufficient, except in the case of wheat.
Besides providing Brazilians with their
basic foodstuffs, agriculture produces an im¬
portant share of the country's export re¬
venues. Sugar, the first foodstuff to be used as
an international currency, is still a valuable
commodity. The main crops in Brazil today
are coffee, maize, soya, cotton, sugar cane,
manioc, rice, citrus and tropical fruits, cocoa
and potatoes. The major exports from the
agricultural sector, other than coffee, are
soya, sugar, maize, tobacco, cotton and fruits,
including fruit juice.
In 1974 Brazil dethroned Cuba as the chief
world producer of sugar, with an output of 6.9
million tonnes. Almost 40 per cent of this was
produced in the Northeast, and 60 per cent in
the Southeast. In 1978, exports amounted to
1.9 million tonnes, valued at $352 million. In
the same year, the export of sugar by-prod¬
ucts stood at 850,000 tonnes of treacle.
Although coffee is no longer the main
strength of the Brazilian export trade, it is still
one of the pillars of the economy and Brazil
remains a major world producer, with a crop of
2,589,343 tonnes in 1979. In that year coffee
exports amounted to 1 1 .2 million sacks (each
sack weighs 60 kg) of green and soluble
coffee.
Just over twenty-five years ago, Brazil did
not produce soya on a commercial scale, and
even in 1965 total production was no more
than 500,000 metric tonnes. In 1975, soya
became the country's most valuable export
and, with an output of 12.6 million tonnes in
1 977, Brazil caught up with China, the second
world producer, and is today competing
seriously with the United States (which pro¬
duces nearly four times as much soya) on
international markets.
Stockbreeding. Stockbreeding, and espe¬
cially cattle-rearing, is an important factor
affecting land distribution in Brazil. With 1 00
million head in 1978, the country ranks fourth
among the world's cattle-producing countries,
after India, the United States and the Soviet
Union.
Landdistribution. More than half of Brazilian
farms are minifundia (holdings of less than 1 0
hectares), and less than 1 per cent are latifun¬
dia (estates of over 1,000 hectares). Gener¬
ally speaking, minifundia are more common in
the Northeast and in the southern colonial
zones, while latifundia are found throughout
Amazonia and in the Centre West. In terms of
area, the latifundia are by far the most signifi¬
cant. The minifundia only occupy 3.1 per cent
of all arable land, while the latifundia, although
representing less than 1 per cent of all hold¬
ings, occupy 37 per cent of the land.
Fisheries. Fishing has become an important
industry in Brazil. Crabs, prawns, crayfish, all
kinds of crustaceans, sardines, turtles, mol¬
luscs and other aquatic animals abound in
Brazilian waters. The coast can be divided
into two sections: the Northeast, where fish
and shellfish of very high commercial value
are found; and the South, where shoals of
more ordinary fish are common. Abundant
quantities of crayfish are found in the North¬
east, on the coast of Pernambuco and Para-
iba. The fishermen use the jangada, a balsa-
wood raft equipped with a small triangular sail
and an oar serving as a rudimentary tiller, to
hunt for fish on the open sea. The South has
motorized fleets for tuna and whale fishing.
The pirarucu, or freshwater cod, specimens of
which can weigh up to 250 kg, and which is the
normal diet of river-dwellers, is found in the
interior, in the States of Para and Amazonas.
In 1979 the total fish catch amounted to
977,000 tonnes. ^

### 71636: The Wealth of a nation: facts and figures

Industry
Säo Paulo then and now
A Brazilian who lived in Säo Paulo around
1850 would not recognize the city as it is
today. The two illustrations above show
the striking contrast between then and
now. Top, View of the City of Säo Paulo, an
oil painting executed by the German artist
Eduard Hildebrandt In 1844. Above, the
city as It is today, with its forest of sky¬
scrapers. The figures which chart this
urban explosion are just as dramatic. In
1850 Säo Paulo was a town ofsome 25,000
inhabitants, and by 1890 its population
was still less than 100,000. The situation
began to change dramatically In the first
decades of the 20th century with rising
coffee production. Immigration from else¬
where in Brazil and from other countries
first from Italy, Spain and Portugal, then
after the Second World War from Ger¬
many, Poland, Hungary and Japan
reached such proportions that by 1950 the
city's population was more than 2 million.
During the next three decades the popula¬
tion grew even faster, rising from 8.1 mil
lion inhabitants in 1970 to 15.9 million in
1985 (figures for greater Säo Paulo).
According to United Nations projections,
by the year2000 this Brazilian megalopolis
will be the world's second biggest city,
with 24 million inhabitants, just after Mex¬
ico City (26.3 million). Intensive indus¬
trialization has accompanied rampant
urbanization, and today Säo Paulo is Latin
America's leading industrial centre. The
Säo Paulo "explosion" has caused econo¬
mic, socialand human problems on a mas¬
sive scale. Its ecological consequences
have been particularly serious and have
been aggravated by the economic crisis of
recent years. In collaboration with the
Brazilian Government, Unesco's Man and
the Biosphere (MAB) programme
embarked in 1985 on a project called "Eco¬
logical Studies of the Urban System ofSäo
Paulo", which will be carried out in tandem
with another project for the training of
specialists in urban ecology relating to the
whole of Latin America.
Since the end of the Second World War,
industry has been the most dynamic sector of
the Brazilian economy (31.1 per cent of GNP
in 1978). Industrial expansion in Brazil in the
last thirty years has been remarkable by any
standards.
Mining. Iron ore deposits rank second in the
world, and bauxite deposits probably first.
Also abundant are lime, beryls, rock crystal,
gypsum, ilmenite, magnesite, manganese,
phosphates, rare elements such as thorium,
niobium, zirconium and uranium, as well as
extensive recently discovered deposits of tin,
nickel and copper. Brazil's hydroelectric
potential sets it among the four world leaders,
and its forests constitute one-tenth of the
world total. In addition, Brazil supplies 90 per
cent of the world supply of aquamarine, topaz,
tourmaline and amethyst.
However, despite its immense size, Brazil
does not possess everything it needs. Pet¬
roleum deposits found to date are insignifi¬
cant, and Brazil currently has to import almost
80 per cent of her oil requirements, making a
serious inroad on currency reserves. Coal is
not very plentiful, and of poor quality, although
the discovery of 1 7,600 million tonnes of good
coking coal in the Rio Grande do Sul should
help to reduce imports.
Brazil has been one of the world's leading
diamond suppliers ever since colonial times.
The most important diamond-producing dis¬
tricts are in the north of the State of Minas
Gerais, along the Rio das Garças and the
Araguaia river, in the State of Mato Grosso
and of Goiás, and the island of Marajó, in the
north of Para State.
Despite Brazil's rich mineral potential, the
mining industry still only accounts for a frac¬
tion of the country's trade. In 1978, for exam¬
ple, total Brazilian mineral exports, including
unrefined petroleum and natural gas,
amounted to $1 ,095 million, or 8.6 per cent of
total exports.
Hydroelectric power. Between 1964 and
1 978 Brazil's electric capacity almost quadru¬
pled, from 6,800 MW to almost 25,400 MW,
reaching an estimated 30,000 MW in 1980.
Thirteen large hydroelectric power stations
are being built. They include the Itaipú project
on the Paraná river, which with a capacity of
12,600 MW, will be the world's biggest, and
will supply a fifth of all Brazil's electricity
needs.
Forestry. Almost two-thirds of Brazil is co¬
vered with forest, which can be divided into
three main zones according to the types of
timber they produce. Three-quarters of build¬
ing wood is found in the Amazon region,
where there are 400 varieties of valuable com¬
mercial timber. Hardwoods also predominate
along the Atlantic coast, and only the southern
States Santa Catarina, Paraná and Rio
Grande do Sul produce the softwoods
known by the name of Paraná pine.
Alcoholas fuel. To offset her low oil produc¬
tion, Brazil has embarked on a programme to
increase production of fuel and industrial by¬
products. In 1974 an Ethanol Technology
Programme was launched, using raw mate¬
rials such as sugar cane, manioc, saccharin
sorghum, wood, babassu and sweet potato.
The aim was to create and develop the tech¬
nology to produce ethyl alcohol, or ethanol, in
order to replace oil-based fuels. The program¬
me was the first step in the creation in 1 975 of
the National Alcohol Programme (Proalcool),
which had the objective of producing 10,500
million litres of anhydrous or hydrous alcohol

by 1985 to satisfy the needs of 1,700,000
vehicles, manufactured in Brazil and adapted
to this new method of combustion.
Iron andsteel. Brazil produces more iron and
steel than any other country in Latin America
and ranks thirteenth in the world.
Motor industry. Brazil is the world's eighth
largest vehicle manufacturer. This relatively
new industry is now the fifth most important in
Brazil, employing 215,000 people. Two-thirds
of the motor industry is owned by foreign
firms. Among those who have investments in
Brazil are Volkswagen, Mercedes Benz,
General Motors, Chrysler, Alfa Romeo,
Toyota and Fiat. Almost all these firms, like
the two Brazilian makes of Puma and Lafer,
are situated near or in Sao Paulo.
The petrochemical industry, Brazil's
newest, already ranks tenth in the world and
employs 9 per cent of the country's industrial
workforce. Petrochemical plants are concen¬
trated in two regions, Säo Paulo and Bahia,
but a third centre is under development in the
State of Rio Grande do Sul.
Shipbuilding. After developing with aston¬
ishing speed since 1 958, Brazil's shipbuilding
industry now dominates Latin America. In
1 959 the industry only employed 1 ,000 work¬
ers, by 1980 it employed 180,000, and this
figure is bound to rise as expansion plans are
implemented. Brazilian shipyards delivered
around 801,230 million net tonnes of new
ships in 1980, compared with 319,720 tonnes
in 1974.
Textiles. Since 1964, the Government has
been engaged in a programme to re-equip the
textile industry and provide technical training.
Productivity has risen and the Brazilian textile
industry, concentrated in the Southeast, the
South and the Northeast, today ranks tenth in
the world. The main producer and exporter is
the State of Säo Paulo, with 2,700 mills and an
active workforce of 1 78,000 people.
Food. Heavy investments are being made in
the canned food industry, in which citrus fruits
constitute a particularly important commodity.
Other canned goods include tomatoes,
peaches, peas, palm kernels, maize, green
peppers, quinces and guava. Two canning
factories at Sao Paulo and at Pernambuco
account for 70 per cent of production, most of
which is consumed by the domestic market,
although an increasingly large proportion is
now being exported. Soluble coffee is es¬
pecially profitable. Although a relatively new
industry in Brazil, 348 million dollars' worth of
soluble coffee was exported in 1978. The
biggest factory in the world producing this
type of coffee is in the heart of the coffee-
growing region, at Londrina in the State of
Paraná.
Other industries. Other important sectors of
the Brazilian economy are the electrical and
electronics industries, cement and tobacco.
Import-export. The United States was for
many years Brazil's biggest export market,
but since 1969 the European Economic Com¬
munity (EEC) has held first place. Together
these two markets have absorbed more than
half of Brazil's exports. The United States has
always been Brazil's main supplier, but in
1973 and 1974 the EEC was a source of
imports almost equal in value to those from
the United States. Figures for 1978 showed
that the United States accounted for 22.4 per
cent of Brazil's export business, and 20.9 per
cent of its imports.

Indian influence is much stronger through¬
out the Amazon region than in the Centre
West, whereas Black influence is especially
strong and active all along the coast, but
chiefly in the States of Rio de Janeiro,
Bahia and Minas Gerais.
With a few rare and localized exceptions,
the achievements of the indigenous peoples
did not leave an impression on Brazilian
culture that could nowadays be recognized
as a genuine "cultural system", in technol¬
ogy or Teligion, for example. However, cer¬
tain rudimentary agricultural techniques
such as the widespread practice of coivara
or slash-and-burn cultivation hunting or
fishing methods and very widespread folk
remedies, are recognized as being of indig¬
enous origin.
Although there have been no transfers of
complete systems of symbolic or religious
thought from indigenous to regional cul¬
tures, it is certain that in nearly all areas of
Brazilian life, and in people's representa¬
tion of their lives, there are ways of feeling
and thinking which have sometimes close,
sometimes remote, connections with the
typically Indian. Traces of indigenous cul¬
tures are found in the names used to desig¬
nate geographical features and many towns
all over Brazil, and in important aspects of
systems of interpreting reality.
The situation was completely different
for the Black populations brought from
Africa: if they exerted only a fragmentary
influence on Brazilian ways of life, they
brought to Brazilian culture elements of
material culture and symbolic representa¬
tion which today form part of everyday life.
For example, besides the powerful traces
of Black culture discernible in Brazilian
Catholicism, there are today a great many
religious systems, beliefs and cults whose
ancestry is clearly African. The candomblé
is certainly the most important religion of
Afro-Brazilian origin, with many initiates
throughout the country. But this is only one
strand in a rich and varied tapestry of Black
forms of worship to which Whites are in¬
creasingly drawn. From the Casa das Minas
cult, confined to the northern regions, to
the umbanda (a later Brazilian derivation
from rituals of "Afro" origin, now more
widespread than the candomblé itself
throughout the national territory), a rich
and intense religious and ceremonial activ¬
ity is emerging in Brazil.
A type of athletic wrestling known as
capoeira, initially practised with razors or
knives, was repressed for many years. It
used to be associated with Blacks in the
lowest social groups, but it has spread so
extensively that today there are very few
large or medium-sized towns which do not
boast one or more "capoeira schools". This
rapid dissemination is also a social phe¬
nomenon, in that young people of all social
classes are eager to learn and practise it. A
cross between dancing and a martial art, in
which lively footwork and skill in dodging
are essential, capoeira is only one of many
Black contributions to Brazilian culture
which have achieved nationwide status.
Most current studies on the contributions
of different ethnic groups to Brazilian cul
ture take the view that such fragments are
not really of central importance. To claim to
measure the extent to which Indians and
Blacks participate in a predominantly
White culture with distant European roots,
in terms of their contribution to Brazilian
cuisine, farming techniques, handicrafts or
folk ritual, is to conceal the fundamental
and essential behind a picturesque veil.
Admittedly, any nation which, like Bra¬
zil, is the product of encounters, conflicts
and alliances between national and ethnic
groups, conclusively demonstrates that
people must learn how to live together in
everyday circumstances, respecting the
right to be different and the rights of minor¬
ities. It is impossible to forget that Blacks
and Indians always took part in Brazilian
life as serfs and slaves, as subjects or dispos¬
sessed peoples, and that in spite of every¬
thing they were brave enough to struggle
and resist. Sepé-Tiarajú, an indigenous
warrior chief, and Zumbí, a warrior taken
as a slave who chose to die rather than
submit to slavery, are perhaps more striking
examples of the contribution of minority
populations to Brazilian culture than all the
minor products and skills with which Blacks
and Indians have enriched it in other
respects.
Similarly, the Black consciousness move¬
ments that are being organized throughout
the country, as well as attempts by indig¬
enous groups to resist expropriation of their
land and to defend their rights fore¬
shadowing a future Union of Indigenous
Peoples are the strongest evidence of the
free and creative participation of Blacks
and Indians in Brazilian life and culture.
There is a racial problem in Brazil. A
racial democracy has theoretically been
achieved, but both the employment statis¬
tics and the life led by the vast majority of
Brazilian Blacks and mestizos reveal that a
wide gap still exists between the desire for
full democracy and the assertion of social
equality among ethnic groups. However,
there is evidence of a strong national aware¬
ness of the rights of Indians.
A new, fully democratic assertion of
"Négritude" and "Indianity" is once again
finding vigorous expression in the arts, in
scientific research and in politics, and this is
undoubtedly the most important historical
development that today binds together
growing numbers of Whites, Blacks and
Indians.

### 71639: 1986: Year of Peace, 12: a tribute to Paulo Freire

1 986: International Year of Peace/1 2
A tribute to Paulo Freiré
ON 16 September, the Director-General of
Unesco, Mr. Amadou-Mahtar M'Bow,
presented the 1986 Unesco Prize for
Peace Education to the Brazilian educator Paulo
Freiré at a ceremony held at Unesco's Paris
headquarters. The Prize was awarded on the
recommendation of an international jury, the
International Commission for Peace in the Minds
of Men.
In an address made on the occasion of the
award, Mr. M'Bow noted that "The celebrated
Brazilian educator Paulo Freiré has worked for
the past forty years with unflagging determina¬
tion and devotion to provide literacy training and
education for the neediest population groups
thereby enabling them to take an active part in
the struggle against poverty, the eradication of
which is one of the key preconditions for the
establishment of a lasting peace. ...
"The determination and courage with which he
has worked over the decades frequently in
close collaboration with Unesco to bring into
operation a system of education that is truly for
the people and to ensure that the broadest
masses have access to a life of freedom and
creativity have, by the same token, furthered
both the ideals enshrined in our Constitution and
the goals of the Prize for Peace Education, and
amply justify his choice as this year's prize¬
winner."
In his acceptance speech, Professor Freiré
talked about his work. "It is true," he said, "that
the direction of everything that I have tried to do
during many years in education, in my own coun¬
try and elsewhere, can only be understood by
those who are interested in the historic, social,
cultural and political conditions of my work as an
educator. By this I mean that however great my
personal input to teaching and research may be,
it does not entirely account for my approach,
which can only be explained in social terms.
"Ever since my youth this conviction has con¬
ditioned me to face with humility the results and
the development of my efforts in the field of
education. That is why I neither overvalue nor
underestimate my contribution towards the up¬
holding of a progressive practice and theory of
education.
"I have always been very self-critical in my
own research, and constantly try to learn while
teaching. I have never drawn a dichotomy be¬
tween teaching and learning. I have always in¬
sisted on the seriousness of the act of teaching,
which requires from the teacher a degree of
competence in the subject-matter and the way in
which it is taught, as well as political clarity
regarding the choice of those who should benefit
from education. I can only conceive of teaching
as a complex whole: it cannot exist without
teachers, students, syllabuses, methods, objec¬
tives and purposes. Throughout history, educa¬
tional practices and theories have appeared
which have at times favoured the teacher or tne
student, the content or the method.
"When I speak of learning to teach, I do not
mean to diminish in any way the professionalism
of the teacher. However, it is impossible to deny
that, while teaching, one learns from the
students' doubts, from their often uncritical view
of the act of learning and from the relationship
they have with their teacher.
"As Unesco offers me this challenging tribute, I
cannot forget how far I have come in the course
of my teaching career, always open to the chal¬
lenges held out to me by students, whether
young academics from different cities of the
world, agricultural labourers, or urban factory-
workers from many countries.
"At this moment, in my office in Säo Paulo,
while I fill these pages with words which I shall
soon be reading, my memories irresistibly take
me back to places that I have visited or experi¬
ences that I have had during my life. Many of
these memories are crowded with people of
diverse origins Latin American or African
peasants; North American or Latin American
Indians; Blacks from North American ghettoes;
groups called "aborigines" by the Whites of Aus¬
tralia, New Zealand or the South Pacific islands;
Spanish, Portuguese or Italian urban workers
whom I met in Geneva or Paris during my exile;
university students from Latin America, Europe,
the United States, Africa and Asia. Peoples who
struggle and find their liberty, others who fail, in
Africa, Central America, the Caribbean and Latin
America.
"I owe a great debt to many of these men,
women and young people, to the fears they
express when learning a fundamental lesson
with me, to their doubts and their innocence.
Their fears and their uncertainties, but also their
convictions, which I do not always share, have
helped me to see more clearly, to know more
about things I thought I already knew only too
well. This is so because I have exercised my
boundless curiosity on their convictions and un¬
certainties, their doubts and fears, their fragmen¬
tary knowledge of the world, and whenever I
reflect on educational practice, this helps me
learn to think clearly and to work better.
"In my experience with urban and rural work¬
ers, it has also become obvious to me that a less
naive view of life does not necessarily mean a
commitment to the struggle to change the world,
much less a commitment to change for its own
sake, as the idealist would have it.
"Anonymous, suffering, exploited people have
taught me above all that peace is fundamental,
essential, but in order to achieve peace a strug¬
gle is required. Peace is built and created by
overcoming social imbalances. Peace is built
and created by the continuous construction of
social justice. That is why I do not believe in any
effort to establish so-called 'peace education'
which, instead of unveiling the injustices of the
world, covers them up and tries to blindfold its
victims.
"On the other hand, the kind of education that I
advocate is rigorous, serious, fully democratic
and progressive; education which, in its concern
with what the students are learning, challenges
and critically assesses them."
The Unesco Prize for Peace Education aims to "pro¬
mote all forms of action designed to construct trie
defences of peace in the minds of men, by rewarding a
particularly outstanding example of activity designed to
alert public opinion and mobilize the conscience of
mankind in the cause of peace". The annual prize,
worth $60,000, may be awarded to "an individual, a
group of individuals or an organization". Candidates
may be nominated by "Member States of Unesco,
intergovernmental organizations, non-governmental
organizations granted consultative status with Unesco
and persons whom the Director-General deems qual¬
ified in the field of peace". Nominations must be submit¬
ted to the Unesco Secretariat by 31 March at the latest
each year.
