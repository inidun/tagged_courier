BECAUSE of his masterly translations of the Bible
in the 4th century, St. Jerome is regarded as
"The Patron Saint of Translators". Were he
alive today, St. Jerome would certainly be
interested in another kind of"bible"-one used
by the publishers, writers and translators of the 20th
century.
Bearing the latin title"Index Translationum", this
publication is an International Bibliography of Trans-
lations prepared by Unesco. It was actually first
published as a quarterly bulletin by the Institute of
Intellectual Co-operation from 1932 to 1940, and, after
an interruption of ten years, it was revived by Unesco's
Department of Cultural Activities.
The first issue in the new series published last year,
covered translations made during 1948 in thirty
countries, as compared with 14 countries covered by the
last pre-war issue of the Index. The second volume
which is now available, is even more comprehensive
than the first, and shows clearly a general rise in
translations as compared with 1948..-.--.
Examination of the Index
brings out the striking fact
that neither the most popu-
lated countries nor those
with the most highly deve-
loped publishing industries
produce the greatest number
of translations.
It shows that in 1949 Ger-
m ; mv took thp lead with.
1. 290 translations followed by Poland and Italy (937) ;
France and Bulgaria (784) and the Netherlands (756),
Since the languages of four of these countries are not
widely used or spoken outside their borders, these
countries would obviously appear to have greater needs
for translations of scientific and literary works.
When three or four countries have a common
language, however, it would be wasteful of them
to undertake separate adaptations of foreign works.
How much more efficient it is to share the labour
and thereby avoid unnecessary duplication. Unfortu-
nately, this is not always as easy as it may
appear. In fact, one work is sometimes translated
several times during the same year in the same country !
For example, a certain writer translated a work by
Bergson, unaware that two other writers in his own
country were doing the same thing at the same time. In
Italy two Milan publishers simultaneously translated
"Three Men in a Boat", and three German versions of
a novel by Alphonse Daudet appeared in 1949.
A Linguistic Approach
To look at the problem from another angle, statistics
for natIOns ; lJeakmg the same language show
ot ! ; Ãªi' mequalities. Compared with 1, 730 German
translations (Germany, Austria and Switzerland) there
were only 980 French translations (France, Switzerland ;
Canada and Belgium). Then ; >'6 ; ;' ; ;-" : r : ngÃ¬ish transla-
tions (Gl' : :  riiain, the United States, South Africa and
canada) numbered 854, while in Spanish (Spain,
Mexico, Cuba, Argentine, etc.) there were 597.
A grouping of the Scandinavian countries-Denmark,
Sweden, Norway, as well as Finland, which publishes
a percentage of books in Swedish-shows the number
of translations during one year as 1, 082.
Of the thousands of translations made each year, by
far the most are from American, English and French
books. People living in Eastern Europe, however, are
offered a larger selection of Russian translations than
those in other parts of the world.
After these writers came
a group which included such
names as Pearl Buck, Feni-
more Cooper, A. J. Cronin,
Dostoievsky, Ehrenburg, Kip-
ling, Jack London, Mark
Twain, Stendhal, Alexandre
Dumas, and Plato whose
works were translated in
eleven languages in 1949.
Almost equally sought after were the works of Alphonse
Daudet, Tolstoi, Upton Sinclair, Maupassant, Karel
Capek, George Amado, and ex aequo, those of Winston
Churchill and St. Thomas Aquinas.
Xovcls Talic First Placc
OF all translations published, the novel takes firstplace. The Index shows the choice of literature,
in its broadest sense-ranging from philosophy
to verse-varies from country to country.
Italy, the United States and France appear to prefer
books on history and geography. Hungary and
Bulgaria demand works on the social sciences and
pedagogy. This is true too for Poland, which shows
great interest in philosophical and religious work as
well. Russians and Spaniards prefer works on the
natural and applied sciences, while books on meta-
physics and theology are in the greatest demand in
Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Great
Britain.
But perhaps the most important help that the Index
Translationum can give to publishers and translators is
to show-by omission-the large number of important
works which still remain to be translated. Editors
sometimes ignore a particular work because they feel
sure that it has already been translated. Often this is
not the case at all and here, the Index stands as a handy
guide and indispensable reference book.
The uses that can be made of the Index are unending.
It can, for example, provide the basis for research
the translation of book titles, since the are all-
important from a sales viewpoi, There is, for
example, the  case of "Clochemerle ", Gabriel Chevalier's
semi-classic of Gallic humour, which caricatures life in
a French village. In its Italian translation, the title
became-"Sins in a Provincial Town".
-' 1'108t Tl'ul1s1alt. d Authors
"WHICH authors are the most translated ?" Thisquestion, which has been asked by most people
at one time or another, can be answered by
examining the Index. The first impression one gets is
that few translations enjoy more success than those of
Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin, until one remembers
that there are some ten Slavonic languages, and that
many different dialects are spoken between the Cau-
casus and Manchuria. On the whole, publishers favour
other great writers : Goethe and Balzac led the'field in
1949-the year of their centenaries. In the same
year, works by Victor Hugo, Dickens and Tchekov were
translated in thirteen languages.

### Brazil: land of harmony for all races?
APRIL 1951 Page 3-UNESCO COURIER
BRAZIL
Land of Harmony
For all Races ?
THE traveller who visits Bahia,
the great Brazilian"Negro
Metropolis", comes away with
two apparently contradictory
impressions. On the one hand
he is struck by the obvious multiplicity
of African survivals which have so
deeply marked the life of the city, and
on the other, by the small number of
really"black"Negroes he meets, even
in the most crowded quarters.
While nearly all Bahia's population
is"coloured", the inter-marriage
between Whites, Indians and Negroes
has created an original type which
may ultimately develop in this part of
the world as a new race.
To anyone familiar with the voodoo
cults of Haiti, there is nothing more
strange than to witness their Bra-
zilian counterparts. The orixa. (spirit
gods), the rites, the songs are almost
the same, and if they differ from those
of Haiti, it is only that they have a
more distinctly African flavour. For
at Bahia, the African coast is distant
neither in time nor space. Yet Baba-
lorixa (priests), maes de santo
(priestesses) and S ! has de santo (ser-
vants of the god) are sometimes so
light in colour that it is difficult to
consider them as Negroes.
It is in this extraordinary mixture
that the racial tendencies which have
prevailed since colonial times are most
clearly seen in Brazil. They are also
exemplified by a famous anecdote told
by Henry Koster, an English traveller
in the 19th century. When he asked
one of his friends whether a certain
Capitao-mor (provincial military gov-
ernor) was a mulatto or not, he re-
ceived the following reply :"He was a
mulatto once, But now he is not."On
being asked to explain this, his friend
exclaimed in surprise :"How can a
Capitao-mer be a mulatto ?"
True Heirs Of Portugal
THIS story sums up the essential
difference in attitude towards
the race problem in Brazil and
in some parts of the Anglo-
Saxon world. While, in the United
States and South Africa, coloured peo-
ple are classed as Negroes, even if they
have only a little negro blood, in Bra-
zil it is a person's social position which
counts much more than the colour of
his skin. In this respect, the Brazil-
ians are true heirs of the Portuguese
who never attached much importance
to race and who inter-married freely
with all the native peoples they con-
quered and colonized.
In the Portuguese colonies, and later
in the Brazilian Empire, the slaves'lot
was usually easier than in the French
or English colonies, for religious and
legal traditions favoured the slaves
and tended to respect their human
dignity.
Colour Is No Barrier
As far back as the 18th century,
there were numerous examples
of the rapid rise of mulattos
and of the important part they
played in Brazilian society. They be-
came in fact.  kind of middle class
between the black slaves and the
whites. For although the imperial
regime maintained slavery it never-
theless favoured the mulattos and
opened up the liberal professions to
them. The most intelligent took
advantage of this opportunity and
won distinction and honour in their
careers.
Many are the distinguished Brazi-
lians who were coloured and who
elsewhere would have been subjected
to all the drawbacks of racial dis-
crimination. This rise of the mulatto
to the highest intellectual and poli-
tical positions continues even today,
and if, as it is said, a former Brazi-
lian President, Nilo PeÃ§anha had
Negro blood in his veins, then here is
an example of 8. coloured man reach-
ing the very top of the social ladder.
Colour, in Brazil, is not the barrier
it is in some parts of the United
States. This is proved by the steady
absorption of the dark elements by
those with lighter skins As Donald
Pierson points out in his book"Ne-
groes in Brazil", the whites absorb
the mulattos, and the mulattos absorb
the Negroes, and this is recognized
and accepted by public opinion.
But it would be misleading to try
to paint an rover-simplified picture of
the race situation in Brazil. Though
inter-racial marriages are frequent.
they occur between individuals of the
from an unskilled proletariat deserting
the countryside to answer the call of
an expanding industry.
same social class and rarely take
place between people at the opposite
ends of the colour scale.
Good Things That Are Black
RAIL, it is true, provides an
example of a country where rel-
ations between the races are
relatively harmonious. It would
be an exaggeration, however, to claim
that race prejudice is unknown. Some
Brazilian writers have expressed
racial pessimism with regard to the
Negroes. In Brazilian folklore, too,
one finds a series of racial proverbs
with disparaging undertones. A well
known song reveals this latent pre-
judice :
Negro era 0 olhar de Marina,
E a barba de Sao losÃ©
So branco nao quÃ© Ie prete,
Mulato tambem naG quÃ©.
It tells of a Negro who lists all the
good things that are black-coffee,
the fruit of the jaboticaba tree, Mary's
eyes and St Joseph's beard, but who
notes, ironically, that"nevertheless,
neither the white man nor the mulatto
want to be black'.
These taunts do not prevent the
ordinary people from getting on
together in spite of colour differences,
but as one examines the higher end
of the social scale, the signs of race
prejudice become more numerous.
They are never expressed cynically, but
rest upon tacit conventions-almost
"gentlemen's agreements", concluded
to the disadvantage of the Negroes.
Another shadow is cast over the
traditional picture of racial relations
in Brazil by the growth of an un-
mistakable racialism among the
working classes of cities like Saa
Paulo or Rio de Janeiro. Its origins
are economic, for it expresses the
white workers'fear of competition
Confusion Of Class And Colour
APPEARANCES, however, can be
deceptive. Statements made in
racial terms are often only the
expression of a class feeling.
Owing to the comparatively recent
emancipation. of slaves-in 1888-
the coloured people still belong chiefiy
to the lower classes of urban and rural
workers. It is for this reason that the
idea of colour is so often associated
with the common people in Brazil.
Thus a coloured person of small means,
lacking refinement (in manners or
taste) may have to endure a certain
amount of disdain, yet by the same
token a rich or educated negro can
become"white".
Negroes and mulattos have expressed
their bitterness and disappointment in
racial terms, but their protests are
aimed, in fact, at social not racial
inequality. If the coloured man feels
disappointed or cheated, it is not so
much because he was born black, but
because he belongs to a poor class and
has been unable to get an education,
one of the first steps towards social
betterment in Brazil.
Although everything may not be
perfect in the matter of Brazilian race
relations, the frictions described here
are not likely to raise serious problems
in the future. Racial prejudice, if it
exists at all, is condemned by the
country's sores and is considered con-
trary to the ideals which inspire not
only Brazilians but Americans in
general. But the force of tradition has
made it easier to solve the dilemma
in Brazil. The Brazilian intellectuals
are proud of the racial democracy
which they have brought about, and no
candidate for public office today would
dare express racial feelings.
A Queen Set The Example
THE Brazilian Government has
always opposed racial prejudice
- *-and discriminati n. Ev  at the
time of the Empire, when
slavery still existed, it was considered
improper to display such prejudice.
The experience of a famous mulatto
architect, AndrÃ© RebouÃ§a, illustrates
this clearly. He was invited one day
to a Court Ball given by King
Pedro n, but instead of mingling with
the other guests, he remained standing
alone near a window in evident em-
barrassment. The Empress, noticing
this, crossed the noor, smiled at him
and asked him to dance with her.
It is because of this whole set of
circumstances that Unesco recently
began a full, on-the-spot study of the
various factors-social, economic and
anthropological-which condition
race relations in Brazil today. The
eagerness shown by the Brazilian
sociologists working with Unesco to
explore all favourable and unfavoura-
ble aspects of the question alike,
shows the feeling of confidence with
which Brazilians everywhere regard
the racial situation in their country.

### Opening the door of hope for the blind
UNESCO COURIER-Pag.. APRIL 1951
Opening the Door
Of Hope
For the Blind
'by Sir Clutha Mackenzie
s'Sir Clutha Mackenzie, one of the world's lead-ing blind welfare workers, was totally blinded
himself in 1915 during the Gallipoli campaign
of World War I while serving with the New Zealand
Expeditionary Force. He became one of the
first students at St. Dunstan's Hostel for Blinded
Soldiers, Sailors and Airmen, founded in Lon-
don in 1915. Returning to duty, he edited the
New Zealanders'Army newspaper in Europe,
sometimes acting as his own front-line reporter.
When war ended, the field of blind welfare became
his life's work. In 1935, he was knighted for his
work in New Zealand.
In 1942, at the request of the British War Office,
he re-entered the army to take charge of rehabili-
tating and resettling the war blind of South-eastern Asia.
Sir Clutha, a well-built man of 56, has travelled alone throughout most
of the world in 30 years of working in his field. Now Unesco's Consul-
tant on Braille, he has concerned himself during the past two years
with the problem of setting up a single international system of Braille
symbols for the blind of all nations. In February, Sir Clutha attended
an international conference on Braille, held in Beirut under Unesco's
auspices, which agreed to a uniform Braille alphabet for 5 million blind
persons in India, South-East Asia, the Middle East and Africa. The
new alphabet will replace over 20 local Braille scripts now in use in these
areas.
IN a number of western coun-tries today all normal, healthy
blind children, as well as
adults who lose their sight, have
the opportunity to be trained and
educated for a useful job in life.
Not only can they have wage-
earning occupations but homes and
families, sports and hobbies, com-
munity interests and responsibili-
ties. To reach this goal has been
a long uphill job.
Alas, the countries in which this
ideal has been achieved are all too
few. About three-quarters of the
world's blind live in Asia and
Africa where"liberation"has been
granted to no more than one per
cent. The vast majority still lives
by begging in streets, bazaars and
outside temples. Many only
manage to exist by a traditional
family system which makes
stronger members of the family
responsible for sick, maimed or
aged members. But it is a negative
existence. Minds and muscles are
left to atrophy.
One of the interesting jobs
which fell to my lot during World
War II was at a rehabilitation
centre for war-blinded men of
India and south-eastern Asia.
There was, for instance, Corporal
Bishan Das whom I came across
in a hospital ward in Karar ; hi,
Pakistan, soon after he was
brought back from North Africa.
Utterly crumpled, he answered my
questions only with sobs. He
declared that life was ended for
him and that he must accept
God's will with submission. Never-
theless, he finally agreed to come
to our centre for training. He was
the first to complete the eighteen
months course. He learned type-
writing, Braille reading and writ-
ing, rope-making and the weaving
of newar (a webbing used instead
of springs on Indian beds). When
finished, he left for his distant
home in a high Himalayan valley.
The Blind Scribe
A year later, Bishan Das was backto see us to discuss a business
proposition. Prosperous and
happy, he had become an im-
portant man is. his village. His
two trades of rope-making and
weaving kept him very busy. In
addition, he had become the village
scribe, writing letters in Roman
Hindi on his typewriter. Men sat
in groups before his house, smoking
and telling yarns, while their
business was transacted. His
opinions were treated with respect.
Now he wanted to harness a
vigorous mountain stream which
roared past his house and build

Braille watch is the first crack in the opening door of hope for the newly blind.
a flour mill. Would we finance
him ? We did, and Bishan Das
continued to prosper.
There is a bond between fellows
like Bishan Das and myself. I had
been through it all after being
blinded by a shell in Turkey in
1915... When I arrived in an
English hospital a few weeks later,
Sir Arthur Pearson, the able, blind
leader of St. Dunstan's took me
in charge. Still in bed, I learned
to type. Still in bed, I wrote a
press article at his suggestion. A
few days later the post brought
me an envelope. It contained a
copy of a leading London paper
which carried my article and-a
five-guinea cheque. With such a
journalistic beginning, my fears
and depression began to vanish.
Within a year I was back with the
Army, running a newspaper for the
New Zealand Expeditionary Force.
So I knew how Bishan Das felt
when he was wounded. I knew
the joy he experienced as he
mastered his dark new world by
regaining a full place in life.
Devotion Of Father Jackson
FOUR of the other men at ourIndian training centr , a Sikh,
a Bengali, a Punjabi Mussul-
man, an English captain, were not
only totally blinded but had lost
both hands as well. Their lot was
a hard one until the British
Ministry of Pensions had sent the
special fittings they needed for
substitute hands. How depressed
we were when the first package of
the plaster casts of their stumps
went astray on its air journey to
London !
One of the soldiers, Gulam Qadir,
was only 18 and full of ambition.
We taught him English and type-
writing and prepared him as a
public speaker and demonstrator
who would arouse the public to a
practical interest in the blind. HLs
typewriter, incidentally, wa. s a
specially designed machine oper-
ated by a key attached to his
stump.
In the eastern countries, mis-
sionaries often were the pioneers
in helping the blind to lead fuller
lives. There was Father Jackson,
for example, a young blind priest
of the Church of England. He
went to Burma about 35 years ago
and, by a tremendous effort and
devotion, he built one of the best
organizations in Asia for the educ-
ation of blind boys and girls and
for the practical employment of
men and women.
In grilling heat and drenching
monsoon-clad in cassock and san-
dals-he walked the highways and
byways of that vast country
preaching the gospel and at the
same time opening a new and
wonderful world for the blind. He
died young, working to the last,
but not before his zeal left a per-
manent mark in the field of blind
welfare.
Pioneer Asian Schools
MISSIONARIES having shownthe way, ruling prince  and
volunteer philanthropic
groups-and even a few govern-
ments-set up a number of schools.
Such early efforts, however, affect-
ed only a small proportion of the
afflicted although they vividly
illustrated that the blind Chinese,
Indian, Persian and Arab are
potentially just as active in mind
and body as the European blind
person.
But schooling alone is not
enough. Practical workshops and
vocational training for future
employment are necessary too. A
modern school for the blind, for
example, must have special ap-
paratus in addition to more
ordinary equipment. Today, I
know of at least fifty small pioneer
schools in Asia, where the gift of
such equipment for teaching the
blind would be an untold blessing.
Each blind student needs a Braille-
writing machine, the rather ex-
pensive thick paper on which to
write, and a round-pointed stylus.
To write, one pierces the sheet
from behind-looking-glass fashion
- making the combinations of dots
for each Braille letter. This is
cheap and simple. But it is slow,
and the pupil cannot read his work
while writing.
Therefore there are typewriter-
like machines. With the latest
model, the student's written work
appears on the upper side of the
paper so that he can read and
check his script as he works.
There are many other ingenious
aids including special measures
and liquid measuring units and a
variety of trade tools. Invaluable
is a Braille watch. Not infrequently
it is the first crack in the opening
door of hope for the newly blind.
I remember, for example, the
tragic figure of Rifleman Saw
Jacky, a young Burman Karen
blinded by a spray of machine-gun
fire during the war. For a fort-
night after he arrived at the
Indian training centre, he would
only lie miserably on his bed. He
refused food and all attempts to
rouse his interest. If I can't have
my eyes back, I only want to die",
he repeated. Then, an English
officer-armless and blind-gave
Jacky a Braille watch. He made
him feel his handless arms, and
explained that he was luckier.
Jacky at least could feel the watch
even though he couldn't see it !
The gift of a Braille watch was
the first step for Saw Jacky and
succeeded in giving him fresh hope
and a feeling that all purpose had
not departed from his life.

### Syria decrees general mobilization of all civil servants as part-time teachers
APRIL 1951 Page 5-UNESCO COURIER-
Syria Decrees General Mobilization
Of All Civil Servants As Part-Time Teachers
new kind of revolution
is taking place in Syria.
1 A. Though it affects all
levels of national life,
the greatest'changes are
taking place in the cultural
field.
It is a bloodless revolution !
While other countries,
caught up in a worla arma-
ments race, are passing laws
for military conscription,
Syria has ordered a different
kind of mobilization-in
the service of education.
---
In its Constitution, adopted last October, Syria
declared its intention of sweeping away all illiteracy
within its borders during the next ten years. Ton-
day, from the banks of the Euphrates to the
mountains of Lebanon, from the deserts of Central
Arabia to the rivers Tigris and Taurus, an energetic
campaign is being waged to give men, women
and children-city-dwellers, peasants and nomad
bedouins-the right of free access to education
and culture.
Sufficient funds are being made available to the
Ministry of National Education to ensure the suc-
cess of the campaign, and the introduction of
compulsory social service has solved a primary
prob : em, by providing an army of teachers. Every
Syrian, man or woman, possessing a school certify-
cate or a diploma for more advanced studies is
required, by law, to become a teacher, thus ensuring
a pp. rmanent teaching staff in each"School for
the People".
These"Schools for the People"now being opened
throughout the country are cultural centres located
in the primary schools. Their purpose is to spread
practical, useful knowledge among the people and
in particular to wage a campaign against illiteracy.
Schools for nomads
EVERY person holding a school diploma issuedduring the last te  year  must assist in this
teachmg campaign. Anyone wishmg to en er
the Civil Service is also obliged to provide his
services for three months, and later receives a
certificate signed by the headmaster of the school
and attested by the provincial Director of Education.
In this way, postmasters, court clerks and customs
officers, will later have the satisfaction of recalling
by Camille Aboussouan
the time when they took part in this community
service.
Educators were faced with difficult problems even
with the general mobilization of everyone capable
of assisting in the work. How could Syria's nomad
tribes, numbering several hundred thousand people,
be provided with sufficient schools ? How could
equipment such as blackboards and maps be con-
tinually moved on the backs of camels, as the pupils
wandered from pasture-lands to winter quarters ?
Despite such difficulties, fundamental education
has achieved some. remarkable results. The present
aim IS to illcrease tne num-
ber of schools with a teach-
ing programme adapted to
desert conditions. Instruc-
tion on rearing of stock-a
daily factor in the life of
these tribes-is given spe-
cial prominence ; land cul-
tivation is also taught, for
it is hoped to induce the
nomads to abandon their
wandering life and settle
permanently on small farms,
gaining their livelihood from
agriculture.
Reviving"A Glorious Age"
THER schools are being established for smalltowns and isolated rural populations where
pupils receive primary education and are
taught trades. Local inhabitants are asked to
contribute to the building of schools, and in this
connection, a fund-raising experiment has been
introduced in the regions around Damascus, the
Euphrates and Aleppo.
In these places municipal authorities are imposing
a one piastre tax on every kilo of cereals sold at
the Corr. Office, on sale of drinks and on radio sets.
The proceeds from this indirect taxation are used
to benefit the very inhabitants who have paid these
taxes. Thus, a cafÃ© habitue, watching a school
being built in solid stone or good timber, has the
satisfaction of knowing that he has played his part
in this work, because he was a good taxpayer... or
a good Brinker...
An equal drive is being made in the cities :
teaching at primary school level and instruction in
the trades is preparing youthful citirens for their
future callings, thus ensuring an adequate supply
of skilled labour.
A real wave of enthusiasm has swept the people
of Syria, who see in the opening of the doors to
education a chance of reviving once again the
glorious age when classical Moslem culture was
producing the most significant works in philosophy.
the sciences and the arts.
Proud of the Arab heritage
ONE of the impressive results of this culturalrevolution is the fact that already, elementary
schools have increased in number from 1, 070
to 2, 000 and secondary schools from 64 to 110. Ten
trade training schools and six teachers'colleges
have also been opened. But perhaps the most
striking transformation is the opening of educa-
tional facilities to women. To-day, girls represent
one third of the school-going children of Syria
and one fifth of the students at Damascus Uni-
versity. In ten years, it is expected, their numbers
will equal those of the boys.
One of the best measures of Syria's effort is the
share Education receives of the country's budget.
This is 20 % for 1951 ; it will be increased to 2a %
in future years.
The paramount role of education was laid down
in Syria's Constitution in these words :"It should
aim at the training of a generation with strength
of mind and body, believing in God, virtuous, proud
of the Arab heritage, possessing an adequate intel-
lectual background, conscious of its duties and its
rights, zealous for the public welfare, imbued with
It"nirit. of solidarity and brotherhood."
These words are to-day
becoming a living reality.
Damascus, capital of the
Ommeaydes ; Damascus,
whose three hundred mos-
ques with their blue mina-
rets dominate the most an-
cient city in the world, is
the heart of a powerful curl-
tural revival which is
preparing a country rich in
tradition to fulfil its role in
the present and future life
of the world community.

ning has also been made on a [20, 000 rebuilding scheme for Beaufort,
whose imposing 12th century mass dominates the pass from Damascus
to Sidon. At Sidon, the Chateau de Mer, now lies with seven or eight
arches of its bridge at the mercy of the sea. An effort is being made
to salvage and rebuild at a cost of {8. 000. Four months work will be
put in this year. Further up the blue coast, at Gebail-ancient Byb) os-
restoration work was carried ou'fast year on the Port Tower. Atten-
tion is now to be given to the cathedral. Elsewhere along the old
Phoenician coast and iniand, where Crusaders'fortresses and outposts
have weathered six centuries, lesser restoration projects are in hand.
The work of preservation is unforlunately limited by economic condi-
tions in these two Middle East countries where the field of antiquities
is extremely vast,"nd Ihe"Uempts that are being made to preserve
these monuments of Christian zeal are therefore well in keeping with
the legends of Saracen chivalry towards the Crusaders who built
these stronahoids.
The chroniclers of the Middle Ages might well have scoffed had
they been told that one day, the governments of the Arab States would
be allocating part of their budgets for the restoration and us ; keep of
the castles of the Crusaders. Yet this is exactly what is taking place
today in the Middle East, where the Departments 01 Antiquities in
Beirut and Damascus are preparing their summer schedules of res-
toration and repair. Despite the passing of centuries, these castles
still appear to the traveller of today to look down with undiminished
majesty. The Syrian and Lebanese Governrrents do not intend that
they should fall completely into decay and they therefore devote a part
of the funds they make available annually for work in the rich archaeolo-
gical field they have inherited, to this work 01 restoration. An out-
standing example of the architecture 01 the Crusades is the famed
Krak des Chevatiers, near the high road from Tripoli to Homs which
is in an excellent state of preservation. This year, it will continue to
receive its annual allocalion from Syrian antiquity funds. A begin-

ELEPHANT. No thought of precedence entered
the mind of the man who carved this pole. He
was guided solely by considerations of aestheti-
cism and nature.

FRICAN cultural problems have a $pecial interest for Unesco in con-
nection with its efforts to help all countries develop their cultures
according to their traditions and characteristics. To this end.
Unesco has worked in close collaboration with the International African Ins-
titute since 1949 and through grants made to this Institute, has enabled ethno-
logists to carry out important research in this field.
Thanks to Unesco's help, the Institute has published an African analytical
bulletin and several sociological works and is today organizing an interna-
tional mission of ethnologists.
Unesco has itself made available two fellowships to young African scholars
and has organized a committee of experts to discuss the preservation of
popular arts.
Many of this committee's recommendations related to Africa and stressed,
above ail, the need for a spirit of understanding for peoples and a respect for
local cultures. Such recommendations, which are in accord with the general
principles guiding Unesco, find a confirmation in the story of Abossolo Simion,
an African craftsman, which is told in the reportage on this page.
D tiRING the past thirty years, arts InAfrica have ceased to be regarded
with a certain disdain rather as if
they were barbaric curiosities. Such arts
have inspired European painters ; they
have helped Matisse and later Picasso to
"reduce nature to its geometrical ele-
ments."
But while artists (rather than the gene-
ral public) appreciate the aesthetic value
of the statuettes, masks and ritual objects
donated by travellers to museums or
sold to art dealers, even these artists
are unable to explain the meaning or
significance of such objects. Their ap-
preciation is related solely to the imme-
diate visual or emo-
tional impression ; as
to the intrinsic va-
lue and symbolism of
these art forms to
the African crafts-
men. explanations are
usually left to ethnologists.
Yet this is a vitally important aspect of
such art. The marvellous sculpture of the
entrance to Chartres Cathedral, for exam-
ple, evokes admiration. But at the same
time, such work conveys the religious fer-
vour that inspired the artist to fashion
these virgins, angels and kings. The 12th
century artist actually carved or painted
a virgin and not just a statue or a stained
glass window.
The same is true of African artists, say
the ethnologists, who thus give a timely
reminder that there can be no true un-
derstanding of the art of these peoples
without a knowledge of their social, tech-
nical and religious background. The signi-
ficant fact that emerges from such a study
By Georges F RADIER
is that this art, when it is really authen-
tic, is always a sacred one. Before these
ancestral effigies, funeral masks and sac-
rificial instruments which other peoples
examine with mere curiosity, the black
peoples show a reverence which, while it
may sometimes be aesthetic, is always re-
ligious.
A Threat To Negro Art
rn ODAY, the beliefs, customs and socialstructures which, during many cen-
turies have given rise to these crea-
tive forms, are greatly altered or are even
Demg destroyed. l"ljeW
religions (Shamanism,
Islam, Christianity),
and new institutions
- those of colonial or
protectorate powers-
are rapidly spreading
right to the heart of the African contment.
whether these changes should be extolled
or deplored, the fact remains that they
appear to have had a most disastrous in-
tluence on traditional arts. To quote Mar-
cel Griaule, the French ethnologist :
"everywhere that the institutions of the
Negro peoples come in contact with new
cults or'administralive measures, art either
is transformed or disappears."
This conclusion, however, sufficient
though it may be for the ethnologist, far
from satisfies the Africans or the artists
who have wholeheartedly accepted, in their
definition of art, the works of the Sudan
and the Congo. When the myths which
bind together his universe lose their power,
will the Negro become incapable of aesthe-
tic creative work' ? Is it not possible for
him to evolve, since"evolutIOn"seems
inescapable, without abandoning the art
forms inherited through tradition, but
which at the same time, are the expression
of his oneness with his society, his world,
or, in a word, his culture' ?
Perhaps the most adequate reply to this
question is provided by the experience of
a young French teacher, M. Raymond Le-
coq, who, arriving in Africa five years ago,
was obliged to solve, on a small scale, a
practical problem which today confronts
all people who, thirty years ago were still
regarded as"primitive."
No Right To Teach Drawing
BLUE BATIK ROBES, a panther skin encircled by feathers, a pearl decorated hood, a cone-shaped
head-dress covered with small figures, a whip, a horse's tail and a monkey-stun sleeve-these are some
features of the native dance used as art motifs by Abossolo Simion.
IN 1945 ; when 1\1. Lecoq was sent tothe Cameroons, instructional centres
existed at Douala and Ebelowa for
training masons, carpenters, joiners, bas-
ket-makers and railway men, as well as for
a group of youths whose role was appa-
rently to perpetuate the"popular arts."
At Ebelowa, a craftsmen's co-operative
served more than a hundred workers, ap-
prentices and pupils, and M. Lecoq was
appointed by this co-operative to take
charge of one of its school. At the same
time. he was asked to work on a plan for
the organization of craftsmen's centres for
all the Cameroons.
He found himself in the midst of an en-

thusiastlc crowd of young men who,
throughout the day in the sculpture class,
devoted their efforts to making poor imi-
tations of European, Moroccan and Chinese
curios and trinkets. Having visited the Co-
lonial Museum and the Museum of Man in
Paris and having studied speciaJised re-
views on African art, M. Lecoq felt he un-
derstood the subject. He had, therefore,
hoped for something different from what
he found at Ebeiowa.
His mission, it seemed to him, would be
unproductive if the craftsmen entrusted to
his care, had lost their inherent capacity
of perception and feeling and their crea-
tive ability and if thev were to be hence-
forth in the tow of bazaar vendors and
manufacturers of decorative articles. Then
he had the idea of asking his native pupils
for a design on a free subject and this test,
he relates, revealed"two things : ftMMy,
out of the hundred designs submitted, there
were about twenty which, uninfluenced
by pictures in books, showed a rich depth
of feeling and inspiration and the vision of
the"primitive"artist, who, ignoring ordi-
nary laws of perspective, depicts by the
simplest means, superimposing thou, qhts
and pictures and accentuating the most
characteristic details.
"Secondly, 1 had no right to teach them
to draw ; my Western knowledge, 1 felt,
must not impose itself on their sincerity
and their native power of observation."

ENCOURAGED by the results of his ex-periment, Lecoq then asked his pu-
pils to make either a clay model or
a piece of sculpture based on a scene in
their everyday life. This test gave final

rhis craftsman and artist, Abossolo Si-
mon, ran the risk, despite his talent, of
stlfering the fate of his comrades and of
sinking, consciously or not. into unfruit-
fll imitation. Seein the influence the

duction and keep constantly alive the ar-
tistic value of the craftsmen's work.
Furniture, statues, portraits, stylised ani-
mals-his sculptures perhaps are no longer
endowed with the spiritual power of a re-
ligion which impregnated the whole life of
the ancestors of Abossolo. But the forms
are at least derived from elaborate designs
which date back many centuries to the
borders of the forest and the banks of the
Niger ; there is the same simplicity, the
same vision, often the same techniques and,
in the words of the French teacher"the
same impression of power and things eter-
nal."
No Need To Pass The Torch
THIS is the lesson to be learned fromthe story of Abossolo Simion. His
art is no longer a social function.
It no longer embodies a tradition, a cus-
tom, a faith ; his talent was, in a sense,
available, and he could have debased it by
working for commercial interests. Or
again, under the influence of a European
teacher, he could have become just ano-
ther sculptor, without roots, orthodox and
mediocre. But he was fortunate enough to
meet an instructor with sufficient judg-
ment and experience to encourage him, to
free him from any sense of inferiority and
allow him, in fact, to become a fine native
sculptor, not only for his own develop-
ment but for the cultural enrichment of
his compatriots.
The story seems simple enough, but its
full portent cannot be overstressed at a
time when the economic development of
Africa is going to require great perception
by educators, if they are to safeguard the
creative tal nt of those peoples whom theyare trying to help.
Culture lives through exchange and not
by forced loans. Recently, a"colonial"
magazine made the following statement :
"Since the evolution of the native races
includes the teaching of history, geogra-
phy, Latin the sciences etc... : why shoulrl
not the slandard measures for depicting
the human form be instilled at the same
time, thus passing on the torch which our
artists went as far back as Greece and
Ancient Rome to rekindle ?"
If such pretensions were to carry the
day, both the native races and civilization
would be the losers. The words of the
young French teacher have a truer ring :
"I'm convinced,"he says,"that an artist
with the courage to forget his Western
culture, and prepared to study the art
forms of the country where he is called
upon to guide and direct native craftsmen,
can and should safeguard he natural ar-
tistic perceptions of the Africans, for such
peoples are too apt sometimes to imitate
us in a superficial fashion, even while We
are seeking among them our lost youth."

### San Marcos de Lima: "dean of American universities", four centuries of uninterrupted teaching
UNESCO COURIER-Page 8 APRIL 1951
San Marcos de Lima :"Dean of American
Universities " Four Centuries of Uninterrupted Teaching
by JosÃ© de Benito
IN 1551, the Pe-
ruvian City of
the Kings
(which to-day
we call Lima)
was a newly-built
town on the banks
of the Rimac where.
some 15 years before.
it had been founded
by Francisco Pizarro.
Its shape gave it the
"chessboard"appear-
ance of a Roman garrison town, with nine
streets running lengthwise crossed at right angles
by thirteen others. From a distance-a certain
Fray Reginaldo de Lizarrago noted-its spring-
ing vines and many groves of fruit-trees made
it look more like a forest than a town.
Another old writer, Cieza de Leon, described
its broad plaza and narrow streets, its substantial
- sometimes elegant-houses with towers and
walled gardens standing four to the block. In
reality, however, many of the 458 homes pro-
jected still remained to be built and of those
completed the majority had only mud walls and
roofs of matting. The only exceptions were
the churches and convents constructed by the
religious orders ; their architecture reflected
both the wealth of the new-found countries and
the faith of the missionaries.
Such, then, was the city which had petitioned
Emperor Charles V for a university where the
local"Creoles"could prepare themselves for the
liberal professions. The decree issued in Valla-
dolid on 12 May 1551 conferred on the new insti-
tution certain of the privileges of the ancient
and famous university of Salamanca, founded in
1220, with its 6, 000 students and 60 professorial
Chairs.
A long tradition already marked the university
life of Spain. By the thirteenth century no less
than eleven laws-the Partidas of Alfonso the
Wise-covered almost every aspect of university
life : courses of study, student associations,
competitions for nomination of professors and
even the location of bookshops near the
universities.
Within a few years after its foundation, the
new University in America had established
Chairs not only of Law, Medicine, Arts, Astro-
nomy, Theology and Canon Law, but also of the
Quechua language.
The general atmosphere of the colony in those
days, however, was not an easy one for a
university. The early history of the University
of San Marcos reflects not only the quarrels
between Pizarro and Almagro and the suspicions
of the newly converted or as yet unconquered
natives, but the ambitions of the different
religious orders to increase their own influence.
The Dominicans, in whose convent the university
had been set up, tried to monopolize the
teaching posts and to exclude lay teachers and
members of other religious orders.
Seeking A Home
A number of stinging incidents, however,quickly convinced the Viceroy of Toledo
of the need for making the university
independent of the religious orders. And on
30 December 1571 a decree obtained from King
Philip II, formally ordered the removal of the
university from the Dominican House in Lima.
It made two moves, first, to a building near
the church of San Marcelo and then to a
permanent home in the"House of Refuge for
the Mestizo Daughters of the Conquistadors"
LIMA'S HANDSOME PLAZA : Four hundred years ago, Cieza de Leon, a Spanish writer, described the"substantial, sometimes
elegant houses with towers and walled gardens"of the newly-founded city of Lima.
dedicated to St. John of Penitence. The new
site, chosen by the Viceroy himself, with the
advice of the Rector, doctors and other persons
"zealous for the public welfare"closely followed
one of the ancient Laws of Castille calling for
buildings"with access to the country and the
public squares to enable students to meet
together, discuss their studies and refresh their
minds."
"Out of the Hat"
THE Patron Saint of the university, strangely,. was determined by chance. As an absolute
majority of university officials could not
be secured for any proposal, the names of a
number of saints and evangelists were literally
"put into the hat". The name drawn out was
that of St. Mark the Evangelist. To-day, after
four centuries of uninterrupted teaching, the
university is still known by his name throuehout
the world.
As early as 1577
there were sixteen
professorial Chairs and
in the same year the
first native-born gra-
duate, Dr. Jean Val-
voa, began lecturing
on"The Language of
the Indians".
By 1588, the uni-
versity had gained
such prestige, that the
King issued a decree
granting all graduates
- bachelors, licencia-
dos and doctors-"the
same liberties and
franchises throughout the West Indies as are
enjoyed in this realm (Spain) by graduates of
the University of Salamanca, including immu-
nity from taxation".
Zealous in maintaining its independence, the
University of San Marcos has always defended
its freedom and safeguarded the high intellectual
standards of its teaching staff. Senior profes-
sorial posts are still filled by public competition
and the President of the University is chosen
independently by free elections.
Like every other ancient institution it has
known days of glory and of difficulty, days of
bitterness as when fire ravaged its splendid
library, and hours of solemn thankfulness like
those through which it will live as it comme-
morates this year its birth four hundred years
ago. Because of its antiquity and its continuous
service to learning, it has now the title of"Dean
of the Universities of the Americas".
It happened April
Jean-Baptiste
de la Salle
The man who was to become known
as the forerunner of modern teaching
was born at Rheims on the 30th April,
: 651. Canon and Doctor of Theology,
nothing seemed to him so important
as the education of the poorest chil-
dren. When, aged 30. he formed a
group of teachers, whom he named
"Brothers of Christian Schools", he
ordered that all lectures ni his schools,
should be given in French instead of
Latin : this daring innovation caused
a clash with the ecclesiastical autho-
rities. But La Salle was undaunted
and introduced further innovations :
group teaching, object lessons, the
"Socratic"method of discussion to
replace dreary lectures.
In 1684 he opened a seminary to
train competent teachers for the vil-
lages and hamlets ; it was the first
school Ã°f its kind in Europe. Fifteen
years later, he established at Paris
"public lectures on science, art and
religion", undoubtedly the beginning
of rtle first popular university. The
day after his death, his ex-pupils
began extolling the saintliness of their
master. In 1900, the Pope gave his
official sanction to their act.
Luther Burbank A book
written in a quiet poetic style, was
published thirty years ago to show
"How plants are trained to work for
man."The author has long been
acclaimed. Hugo de Vrles dubbed him"the gardening genius". Since 1875
the book's author, Luther Burbank
had been continually experlmenting
with plants In his Callfornlan garden.
He had studied thousands of species
and given to the world hundreds of
new varieties : fruit, flowers and vege-
tables came out of his garden-labora-
tories, every year producing richer and
finer specimens.
He had never allowed his long
experience and his strange gifts for
research to be used In the service of a
theory. Official science scoffed at his
objections to the Mendelian doctrine
of heredity. His work had led Burbank
to believe very strongly In the here-
d1tary of acquired characrerlstlcs and
In the constantly changing nature of
the species. Scientists, at least, never
charged him with heresy, though many
laymen accused him nf subversive
atheism.
But Burbank, a staunch defender, at
that t'fne. of Charles Darwin, remained
unperturbed. As a young man, he had
said :"I shall be content, if, because
of me, there shall be better fruits and
fairer flowers."
Otterino ReSI) iHhi,
who died 15 years ago on April 18,
1936, was not perhaps the best-known
of italian composers at the beginning
of the twentieth century which also
knew Puccini and the"vÃ©rlstes",
Although a"modem", he wrote orks
which were quickly appreciated by the
general public.
Today the critics, while praising his
"Fountains of Rome", the Trlttlce
BotticeIliano and the Lauda per la
Nativlta del Signore, find It difficult
to put their fingers on the art of this
great musician from Bologna. Even a
knowledge of the Influences he under-
went In his musical career, explains
little about his style,-even the fact
that he was a pup1J of Rlmsky-IKorsa-
kov at St. Petersburg in 1901. But
there is general agreement on some of
his masterly Qualities : his sense of
form, elegance, the sureness of his
orchestration. Recently, an Italian
critic, speaking of Respighi, said :
"His hedonism sets limits on his
genius, but when the composer took
care to keep within these limits, he
wrote works which posterity will
always remember."

and an explanation of its significance have not yet appeared
generally in the Press. On the other hand, many newspapers
were recently responsible for a great public disservice when,
with scare headlines, they declared that an unknown body in
outer space was approaching the earth at great speed-and
that there was danger of a collision.
Any science writer, had he been consulted, would have
described this story as"bunkum". He might instead have
suggested that the Press tell the story of how two British
radio astronomers, using the world's largest radio telescope,
found, a few months ago, that Andromeda was"broadcasting"
on a wavelength of 1. 89 metres.
Radio astronomy, a new branch of science, although it dates
back 20 years, is opening ap a new"window"in the earth's atmo-
sphere for us.
Until recently, astronomy was a visual science, with obser-
vations made by the naked eye and the telescope. The new
"window"is provided by the radio waves which find their
way to the earth. (See Unesco Courier, March 1951.)
vur nearest ; nelgnoOUrmg umverse
is the Great Nebula of Andromeda.
In magnitude, in number of stars,
and in structure it is similar to our
own galaxy. The more we learn
about it, the more we shall know
about ourselves. In fact, wnen we
look at Andromeda we are looking out
into space and back into time, for it
is about 800, 000 light years away-
which means we see it not as it is
now, but as it was before our ances-
tors were men.
90 MINUTES IN THE LIFE OF THE STARS : Above is shown
the result of a simple photographic experiment. On a clear, moon-
less night, a camera was aimed at the Pole Star and the shutter
was left open for one and a half hours. The result is shown above,
each star having described its track in the form of an arc. The Pole
Star is responsible for the thick track a little above the centre of
the photograph. As the earth rotates on its own axis,
all the stars seem to rotate around the Celestial Pole. In the fore-
ground is the outline of an astronomical dome with its shutters
open and interior illuminated.
What Happens in Space
WE have learned a great dealabout our planetary syst m
since the day three and a half
centuries ago when Galileo, applying
his eye to the first optical telescope
devised by himself, began to see in
the heavens the proofs of the Coper-
nican theory-a theory that was to
make a tremendous revolution in the
thinking of mankind. We know now
that we live on one of the smallest
satellites of a dwarf star in a local
system of one of millions of Milky
Ways.
Our scientists seek every opportunity
to find out what is happening in inter-
planetary space. That is why great
interest was shown in the report of
the recent discovery in the barren
lands of Ungava, in Canada's Nor-
thern Quebec, of the biggest meteorite
crater in the world. From a study
of this, and the region above the
earth's surface whence it came, we
shall obtain more information of the
kind that will eventually help us to
travel in outer space.
A crater helps us to find out what
is happening in outer space, because
it is blasted out of the hard earth by
a meteorite, which is a cosmic
"bullet"come to earth. Those cos-
mic bullets that do not fall on land
are known as meteors. They can be
seen on any clear, moonless night
darting across the sky as flashes of
light.
The only living persons known to
have seen a meteorite hit the
earth are the inhabitants of the
Siberian vil'age of Novopokrovka, a
few hundred miles from Vladivostok.
It was at 10. 35 in the morning, almost
four years ago, when"startled by a
brilliant flash like a bolt of lightning
from the sky, children from the local
village school hurried out of doors.
Against the blue of the sky they saw
a ball of light as brilliant as the sun
and about the size of. the full moon.
It travelled across the sky towards the
south, shedding showers of sparks and
carrying in its immediate wake a
brightly coloured track which quickly
turned into a thick black trail. Wi-
thin four or five seconds, the object
had disappeared in the general direc-
tion of the Sikhotaalin Mountains of
Eastern Siberia". (This is the descrip-
tion given by Dr. Otto Struve, Profes-
sor of Astronomy in the University
of California, in the"Scientific Ame-
rican"for June, 1950.)
A scientific expedition from Moscow
investigated the region where the
meteorite had fallen and found a
series of more than 100 holes, some of
them 30 to 40 feet deep, and as wide
as 75 feet at the top. All around
there was tremendous destruction
caused by the"rain of iron". The
ground was strewn with pieces of
meteoritic iron-some weighed seve-
ral hundreds of pounds ; others were
specks. The meteorite originally
must have weighed about 1, 000 tons
and had a diameter of some 30 feet.
Meteors Can Help Man
VISIBLE meteors are related tocomets and to the cosmic dust
clouds of the Milky Way. A me-
teor makes bright flashes because of
the speed at which it travels. When'
it enters our upper air it may be
moving about 25 miles a second. The
further it falls, the more resistant the
air becomes and the meteor is slowed
down by the atmospheric friction.
The study of this slowing-down of
meteors has become of importance in
recent years with the development of
new techniques (the radio astronomer
has made some interesting studies into
meteors). It has been possible, for
example, to get an idea of the tempe-
rature of the upper air. It has been
discovered that it is much hotter 40
miles up than at the earth's surface
- a surprising fact in view of the sub-
zero temperatures in the stratosphere.
As Dr. Harlow Shaply, Director of
the Harvard College Observatory, has
said :"Precise information on this
region of the atmosphere is exactly
what we need for the development of
high altitude, jet-propelled airplanes,
as well as for the rocket ships of the
near future."
Is not this whole story mon
exciting than the nonsensical fabri-
cations that are sometimes published.
and which horrify readers, who art
unaware of the limitations of science
and the significance of its routinp dis-
coveries ?
The Hazards
of Technical
Translation
The Riddle
Of The
Spade
WHEN is a spade not a spade ?The answer depends on the
language in which you describe
this most primitive of implements.
This was demonstrated by the late
Ernest Slater, in an introduction to one
of the best-known engineering dictio-
naries in existence.
He wrote :"Take the very best English-
Spanish or English-Portuguese dictio-
nary, find the equivalent therein of the
English'spade'. There are many parts
of Southern Europe and South America
where, if you speak of a'spade'the
farmer will think of a hoe ; he speaks
to you of a'hoe'and you think he is
referring to a'spade'.
"The only way to avoid it is not to call
it a spade but to call it a shovel. This is
inexact, for the English shovel is thinner,
wider, and has curved-up edges ; it is
a dished spade, not the cutting spade
that you would think of. Nevertheless,
there are parts of Spain, Portugal,
Brazil, Peru and Chile where'shovel'
is the best that can be done in the way
of commonly understood words.
"Now this simply arises from a diffe-
rence in practice. The Englishman
wears a thick sole on his shoe and he
uses his foot to his spade. But in the
districts referred to, the labourer wears
hempen sandals (alpargatas) or even
goes barefooted. The blade of the
spade is almost always turned at right-
angles to the haft ; it becomes a hoe.
The labourer raises it, brings it down
with a dexterous cut (often cornerwise),
and then drags it towards him..."
What Slater wrote about the spade
applies equally to other objects and
expressions which, if incorrectly rende-
red, may cause wastage and losses in
international trade and create barriers
to internationa ! understanding.
Here then is a serious problem. It Is
one considered by Dr. J. E. Holmstrom,
of Unesco, in his"Report on Interlingual
Scientific and Technical Dictionaries"
(available through the Unesco Sales
Agents in English and French editions
at the price of 25 cents, ! s. 6d., 75 French
francs).
The Report discusses the rationale
of technical translating, the need for
dictionaries relating to specialized sub-
jects, and the means whereby existing
deficiencies may be remedied by enlisting
the co-operation of international techni-
cal organizations.
These proposals are timely because
there is now general agreement that
technical terms should be clearly defined
and their equivalents in different langua-
ges standardized. Scientific exchange
and the passing on of knowledge is
handicapped unless words can be used
as tools of precision.
This situation, dangerous enough
within one language, becomes formi-
dably so when other languages are invol-
ved, for it is rare for a word in one lan-
guage to mean exactly the same, and to
carry precisely the same implications as
the words of another equated to it in
dictionaries.
Many dictionaries are out of print and
most vary at random in their arrange-
ment, convenience of use, quality and
up-to-dateness as well as in the lan-
guages and scope of subject matter to
which they relate. A separate biblio-
graphy accompanying the Unesco Report
(priced at 65 cents, 4s., 200 French francs)
classifies no less than 1, 044 special
dictionaries under 224 subject heads
and in 45 languages.
Unesco, the refore, is hoping to playa
part in evolving improved and more
economical techniques both for compiling
and printing technical dictionaries with
a view to recommending them to inter-
national scientific unions and other
suitable bodies which need them. M. G.

### Taking travel out of the luxury bracket; a UNESCO report on workers abroad
UNESCO COURIER-Page 10 APRIL 1951
FIFTY years ago, if a travellerwanted to buy a sleeping-car
ticket on a European railway,
he was told he could only ride first-
class. Since there was no market
for any cheaper tickets, there were
none on sale.
To-day, travel is coming out of
the luxury bracket. Organized
tours, family rates on railways,
summer colonies... they all have
contributed to bring travel abroad
which, after all, is the only first-
hand lesson available in internation-
al understanding, within the reach
of more and more persons.
The largest group of potential
travellers is composed of the world's
working population. To-day, in
more and more countries, holidays
with pay have become an accepted
part of the economy.
A recent survey made by M. Ar-
thur Baulot for the International
Union of Official Tourist Organiza-
tions showed that an estimated
150, 000, 000 workers throughout the
world received holidays with pay
every year.
Translated into personal terms,
this means that 150, 000, 000 workers
and their families every year ask
themselves the same question :
"Where shall we go ?"
It is not an easy question to
answer. Despite efforts made at
bringing down the cost of travel, it
is still a heavy burden for most
persons dependent upon salaries.
(In one European country alone, it is
estimated that 40 per cent of
workers enjoying holidays with pay
never leave home.)
Unesco and the International
Labour Organization (ILO) have
been working on the problem for the
past year. The result is a book,
called"WOTkers Abroad", which is
scheduled to be published this
month as a supplement to Unesco's
annually-issued handbook on inter-
national fellowships and scholar-
ships, entitled"Study Abroad".
"Stronger International
Links"
THE objective of the volume isdescribed in a foreward written
by M. Jaime Torres Bodet, Unesco's
Director General, in which he
declares :
"'Workers Abroad'is issued as a
service to manual and non-manual
workers in Unesco's Member States
and to their voluntary organizations
with the aim of stimulating and
extending the various types of
educational activity designed to
break through national cultural
frontiers by bringing together people
from different countries who do the
same job".
M. Torres Bodet also pays tribute
to the pioneering efforts made by
labour organizations in showing
their members how other people live
and work. He points out that :
"Dating from the turn of the
century, the international links
between workers'organizations have
become immeasurably stronger, and
have been accompanied by increased
attention to the educational and
cultural needs of workers..."
"Workers Abroad"presents a
picture of international travel oppor-
tunities for workers from several
points of view. For the year 1951,
it lists international study tours and
group travel, international summer
schools and seminars, scholarships
available to workers, and, finally,
programmes designed to encourage
the international movement of
trainees.
Unesco's Exchange of Persons
Service, which helped compile the
pamphlet in co-operation with the
ILO, points out in"Workers Abroad"
that this first effort is not a complete
survey. It is confined mainly to
workers'travel opportunities offered
in European countries and the
United States.
It shows that 103 organizations in
thirteen countries offer workers'
scholarships of varying durations.
At the same time, seventy-two
organizations in eleven nations will
be conducting group study tours this
year.
Learning Each Others ways
TUN the book, Unesco points out thatopportunities for employment
interchange, although the most
difficult to realize, are the best way
in which workers from different
countries can learn to understand
each other. Under this system, for
example, textile workers in the
north of France and in Britain's
Midlands might visit each others'
countries and, by working beside
their opposite numbers in the other
country, learn something of their
lives.
The principal obstacles to this
form of travel, lie in administrative
complications, such as labour per-
mits, and in material problems, such
as wage differentials and payments
to dependents who remain at home.
The financial picture presented in
Workers Abroad also shows need of
improvement. In most cases of
short-term exchange, the cost of
the trip is the responsibility of the
individual worker.
There are happy exceptions. One
of these was a three-week tour of
the United States organized in 1950
by thirty-one Swedish newspapers
and Folket i Bud, a magazine, in
which the sponsoring organization
paid all expenses.
The examples of travel opportuni-
ties cited are indicative of a healthy
trend. Take the case of the study
tours organized by the Association
Touristique des Cheminots (Rail-
waymen's Tourist Association) in
Paris. This year, the association
has organized fifteen tours for rail-
waymen from France, Switzerland,
Tunisia, Luxembourg, Austria and
Finland. The tours will take them
just about anywhere from Scandi-
navia to North Africa.
In Belgium, the International Art
Weeks Federation, has worked out a
plan for ten-day tours to Austria,
Belgium, Denmark, France, Italy,
the Netherlands and Switzerland.
Similar examples can be found in
Workers Abroad for all the countries
listed. The Workers Travel Asso-
ciation in London has announced
five eight-day tours of London,
including visits to factories, and to
a workers'rehabilitation centre for
Norwegian factory workers. In the
Netherlands, the Votkshogeschoot
Brabantsee at Vught has announced
a waterborne educational tour for
Belgian, German and Dutch workers.
Workers'l Entente Cordiale"
A section on international summerseh ois shows an equal variety
of opportunity. At Elsinore in
Denmark, the International People's
College is offering its traditional
low-cost courses through August
and September in such subjects
as modern languages, international
relations, and social legislations.
The Force Ouvriere, one of the
three major French trade union
federations, has organized a summer
school in England in conjunction
with the British National Council of
Labour Colleges, and, in turn, it
will run its own summer school in
France for members of Belgian trade
unions.
One chapter of the book is
devoted to an ILO survey made of
agreements now in existence to
permit the international exchange
of trainees. These agreements, some
drawn up by governments and
others by private organizations, aim
at extending the possibilities for
young workers in industry, com-
merce and agriculture to work side
by side with their fellow workers in
other countries.
Once published, Workers Abroad
will be sent without charge to some
2. 000 organizations such as trade
unions, co-operatives, workers'travel
and workers'educational organiza-
tions and other groups conducting
workers'educational programmes in
Unesco's member States.
This edition will be printed in
English and French with an abridged
version in Spanish as very little
information was received about
workers'travel opportunities in
Latin American countries. A special
edition will also be published in
German.
Workers Abroad represents a
natural extension of Unesco's efforts
to reduce the barriers now blocking
the free movement of peoples. It is
being published to provide workers'
organizations with another tool in
their continual campaign to pull
down these barriers-a campaign
which has been carried on by most
of these organizations since their
foundation.

### Amateur theatre today: promise for tomorrow
APRIL 1951 Page II-UNESCO COURIER
Amateur Theatre Today
Promise For Tomorrow
By Leon CHANCEREL
Director and Founder of the Dramatic Centre of Paris
FEWER young people are going to
the theatre today to see either
conventional, experimental or
avant-garde plays. This is a
fact-at least in Europe. Does it mean
that present-day youth has lost in-
terest in the drama ? In my opinion,
no, for never have they shown more
curiosity or more enthusiasm for dra-
matic art. But nowadays young people
want the theatre fu offer more and
mean more to them. Their demands
therefore are more exacting, and little
by little they are forming their own
opinions and judgments-in short, re-
discovering the theatre for themselves.
They are adopting new doctrines, new
ethical and aesthetic standards inspir-
ed by the ideas and examples of such
men as Constantin Stanislavski, Appia,
Fuchs, Gordon Craig, Granville Barkerur or Jacques Copeau
Perhaps the clearest,
most significant evidence of
this curiosity and enthu-
siasm by young people is to
De found in the non-profes-
sional theatre-in schools
and universities, youth as-
sociations, industrial or
agricultural centres, wor-
kers groups or in the Army
and Navy.
It is in these amateur
groups, drawn together by
the same artistic and hu-
man motives that I see the
promise of a rebirth of the
true spirit of the theatre.
It is here that we canÃ±iC',.. n'l7o", tho,.. oallu"nnn-"''""''"'''''"...... &. V."''''''........,.,.........., Y""'
ular"theatre-in-the-making, free of
commercialism, which Jacques Copeau
has so ably defined in his latest work,
Le ThÃ©Ã¢tre populaire.
The"Mother-Cell"of Drama
THAT, we may ask, do these enthu-siastic young people hope to get
from the theatre ? Their studies,
their trades and professions allow
them very little leisure time, yet they
come together, form little troupes and
produce their plays even under the
most trying material circumstances.
Why do they forego their free time
at the end of a full day's work, and
without thought of financial profit, ac-
cept the rigours of the stage-with its
demands on nerve and muscle control,
diction development, and the concen-
tration and effort needed to translate
the words of a tragedy or comedy into
the appropriate scenic gesture ?
Why ? Because, deep down within
themselves, they feel a certain yearn-
ing, revolt, agitation, which they wish
to express in the form of characters.
And through their self-expression they
attempt to present a true personifica-
tion of their feelings to those about
them-not to mere spectators but to
companions (and companions who
lack their gift or talent for the stage).
Some begin at the beginning by
forming a Chores. For they see in the
contemporary tragic or comic Chores,
which is an adaptation not an aping
of the Greeks, the embryo or.. mother-
cell"of all dramatic expression reduc-
ed to its basic essence and purpose.
True, the results are often unskilful,
but who could fail to perceive, beneath
these unpolished and sometimes fal-
tering efforts, the hope and faith of
our generation in the ideals of beauty,
justice and the sublime ?
Amazing Mediaeval Revivals
LAST spring, in Paris, I personallywitnessed a moving example of
this kind during the final stages
01 a competltlve examma-
tion for young theatre com-
panies (J e u n e s Compa-
gnies>, organized by the
French Government at the
Theatre de l'Atelier. About
a dozen boys and girls, all
members of the Association
of Youth Hostels, were
present. Their"team"had
worked together for several
years inspired by the prin-
ciples and techniques of
the Copeau school. As I
heard them speak their
lines, sing and act out the
hopes of the community
which they felt they re-
presented, I asked myself :
"How can these young
people be helped to find equilibrium,
contentment and. peace of mind ? How
can we use our more mature experience
to assist them without distorting or
falsifying the fresh originality of their
youth ? How to help them"find them-
selves"and better themselves ?"
I recall another case, this time in
a school in Paris-the LycÃªe Louis Ie
Grand-formerly the College de Cler-
mont where Moliere once studied the
classics, learned to appreciate Plautus
and Terence and was taught music
and dancing. There I watched ad-
vanced students bring to life forgot-
ten works by Schiller and Marlowe and
attempt a performance of Britannicus.
Their productions were staged with
such Intelligence and warmth and even
technical competence, that they would
have won the praise of professional ac-
tors had any been present to see this
unpretentious student performance.
And to whom do we owe the amaz-
ing classical and mediaeval revivals of
the Oresteia, The Miracle of ThÃ©ophi-
Ius, The Passion of Greban, and the
troubadour romance of Aucassin and
Nicolette ? To the students of the Sor-
bonne.
Workers of the French National
THESE FOUR MASKS and expressive hands aptly symbolize the spirit 01 the theatre and convey
the sincerity of these young players presenting Arthur Rimbaud's A Season in Help, at a
Cone ours des Jeunes Compagnies (Young Peoples'Theatre Competition) in Paris.
Railways have set up a theatre in one
of the railway stations in Paris, and
the critics have been unanimous in
praising the productions of these ama-
teurs as among the most remarkable of
the Parisian theatre season.
A New American Theatre
\y7HAT I have said about the en-thusiasm for the stage by no -
professionals in France, is equal-
ly true of other countries. Armand
Salacrou, for example, recently declar-
ed that in his opinion a new Ameri-
can theatre would one day emerge
from the college campus and its dra-
matic organizations.
In England, where even the Old Vie
has a school open to future profession-
al and non-professional actors, ama-
teur theatre groups are very active.
Their importance has been recognized
by the British Drama League which
encourages amateurs and professionals
alike to meet in the interest of the
theatre instead of regarding each other
with suspicion as so often happens
elsewhere.
Not long ago, in Italy, I saw the
great effort being made by university
and amateur troupes in Rome, Padua,
Florence and Todi ; and one gets the
same impression in Brazil, Switzerland,
Belgium and Luxembourg. In fact, all
over the world, interest in dramatic
art is awakening and young people are
organizing new theatre groups.
How then can we help these young
people ? The answer, I think, is clear.
If we really want to work and prepare
for the theatre of tomorrow, we must
not only look to the polished produc-
tions of the recognized leaders of the
stage today ; we must also turn our
gaze beyond-and search out the small,
non-professional troupes. For here
unpublicized talent and creative ability
still lie hidden away and need the un-
derstanding, encouragement and sup-
port that official and private educa-
tional organizations can provide to sti-
mulate their growth and fullest deve-
lopment.
NON-PROFESSIONAL THEATRE in the USA is one of most active in the world today.
Above, a scene from Gcethe's Faust, staged by students of the University of California at
Los Angeles who produce 10 major plays and hundreds of one-act plays each year.
Working For a World Theatre
WHEN the International TheatreInstitute (ITI), set up under
Unesco's sponsorship, held its
first Congress at Prague in 1948,
it comprised a headquarters in
Paris and eight national centres.
Today, the number of these
centres is more than three times
that figure. Next month, for
example, representatives 01
26 centres are due to attend
the Institute's 4th Congress
to be held in Oslo from
May 31 to June 8,
All branches of the
theatre will be represented
at the Congress by authors,
producers, actors, designers
and stagehands, as well as
by members of the non-
professional stage.
While working to im-
: : >rove theatre techniaues.
the ITI also strives to"bring
peoples of the world together on
the spiritual level through the
medium of the theatre". This
aim finds one means of expres-
sion through the Institute's illus-
trated review,"World Theatre",
which is published in English
and French.
Another ITI effort with the
same objective is the granting of
study and travel scholarships to
ship, many countries are
this year organizing a
series of productions with
a strongly international
tone. In the United States
alone, amateur and profes-
sional groups have given
more than 500 presenta-
tions, with special emphasis
on plays of European ori-
gin. Norway, Holland,
Great Britain, Switzerland
and Mexico are planning
similar activities.
Such efforts help to highlight
the theatre's important education-
al role and the influence it has
always had on adults. But,
looking to the future, the ITI sees
another urgent task-that of
educating children and youth
through the same medium. This
question is included in a work
plan prepared by the ITI Secre-
tary-General, M. AndrÃ© Josset,
for discussion at the Oslo Congress.

for example, young student-pro-
ducers from Belgium, Austria and
Italy were able to study theatre
techniques in England, while
their English counterparts were
visiting Denmark, France, or the
United States.

### Benjamin Constant, fighter for freedom, defender of the press
UNESCO COURIER-Page 12 APRIL 1951
Benjamin
Constant
Fighter For Freedom,
IDefender Of The Press
By Jean Bloch-Michel
Scientific and cultural progress has
always been made along the road of
freedom of thought. Similarly, the
path leading to real democracy based
on mutual understanding among men and
peoples depend in its essence on free
availability of information and the freedom
of the press.
It was in this spirit that the United Na-
tions Commission on Freedom of Infor-
mation met at Lake Success in January
and February this year. Representatives
of fifteen countries : Saudi Arabia, Cuba,
Ecuador, Egypt, France, Great Britain, In-
dia, the Lebanon, Mexico, the Netherlands,
Pakistan, the Philippines, the United States,
the U. S. S. R. and Yugoslavia, drew up a
convention which will be submitted to
member states of the United Nations and
forwarded to the Economic and Social
Council for adoption at its session In July.
The article below recalls the inspiring
struggle waged more than a century ago
by a champion of freedom of the press,
the French thinker, Benjamin Constant.
"I SHALL find my life only within
myself"wrote Benjamin Cons-tant in his personal diary during
March 1805. Nine years later, how-
ever, on 7 July 1814, he wrote :
"I must become something !" Constant.
a dreamer who wished to become a
man of action, was perpetually torn bet-
ween a taste for working in seclusion,
and an urge to be famous. Based on
such inconsistency, his life was inevi-
tably chaotic. But under this faÃ§ade of
inconsistency, behind a series of appa-
rent recantations, the life, which he
found"only within himself", never-
theless produced a profound unity in
the ideals of Benjamin Constant.
Under the Directoire he publicly and
enthusiastically affirmed his regard for
freedom. But, when the First Consul
treated the Tribunate to maintain his
authoritarian regime, Benjamin Cons-
tant demanded and then obtained a
place in it. An act of self-betrayal ? In
his first speech before this assembly
he attacked Bonaparte's policy so vio-
lently that he was not only forced to
quit the Tribunate, but obliged to leave
France and follow Germaine de Stael
into exile.
When Napoleon returned to France
in 1815, Benjamin Constant in a cele-
brated article, which, unfortunately for
him, his contemporaries did not forget,
loudly proclaimed that he would not
serve"the tyrant". But, when he was
summoned by the Emperor to the Tui-
leries a few days later he agreed to
draft the"Acte Additionnel" (a supple-
mentary act to the Empire Constitution,
introducing certain reforms). Another
act of self-betrayal ? Constant did not
think so and seized, what he described
in his journal of 30 March, 1815, as"a
chance for freedom". And at the end
of the"Hundred Days", he wrote with
bitterness :"The wretches ! They served
him with enthusiasm when he way
crushing freedom. When he establishes
it, they abandon him."
A Partisan
Of All Freedoms

he had been"someone". Now, he had
finally become"something".
At that time, there were not many
clear-cut ideas on the subject of press
freedom. The opinions of those favour-
able to complete freedom"had disap-
peared", wrote Pasquier in his memoirs,
"during the long silence imposed by
the imperial regime, and discussions
concerned little more than the extent by
which repressive measures would be
increased."There were demands that
these should be extreme."It is In the
nature of man to be dependent", said
Duplessis de Grenedan, adding,"free-
dom is not the goal of government."
"Wherever the press is free", said Fon-
tanes, the former Grand Master of the
Imperial University,"I will never look
upon myself as free."
"contempt of State religion". He de-
monstrated the difficulty in discriminat-
ing between contempt and simple cri-
ticism of certain bodies or ecclesiastical
institutions. Speaking of the Jesuits, he
said :"If the statements he once made
agamst these associations were written
by Pascal today, he would undoubtedly
be condemned under the terms of this
law."
Every year, when the budget was
being voted, or press laws were being
renewed or altered, he returned to the
attack. Not only did he speak in par-
liament, but he asked the public to
judge his cause, by publishing his work
"The freedom of booklets, political pam-
phlets and newspapers considered from
the government's viewpoint."
During his 10 : lg and assiduous efforts,
he made many statements expressing
the basis of his ideals : For instance, on---.-.--
March 7, 11 ! 20, he said :
" ! have always looked
with envy upon those
friends of freedom,
who, when a revolu-
tionary struggle began,
were the first to suc-
cumb. Their fate pre-
vented them from wit-

mentary democracy. In the time of
Constant, one served a master or a po-
lacy. To a French royalist it was of
little interest that the Emperor ruled
in a manner resembling that of
Louis XIV. He had usurped the throne,
and between him and his subjects the
bonds of hereditary dependence inherit-
ed from the feudal system no longer
existed. If. on the other hand. one
served a policy, it made little differ-
ence which regime applied it. This
attitude was illustrated by the case of
Talleyrand ; other less brilliant figures
also adopted it.
Benjamin Constant appears to have
been strongly influenced Ãžy the doc-
trines of Bentham, especially the one
which taught that regimes and consti-
tutions are only empty frames. Accord-
ing to Bentham a monarchy can be libe-
ral, a democracy despotic ; all efforts
towards freedom must be made within
the framework of the state, and with-
out consideration of the kind of consti-
tution. These were the ideas that druid-
ed Benjamin Constant during his whole
life. He was a liberal, a partisan of all
freedoms, and his most consistent
struggle was for the freedom of the
press.
In 1819, he managed to get himself
The Press Must Be
A Common Possession
B E : \'JAIIIIN CONSTANT strongly oppos-ed such attitudes. On 14 A ril,
1819, when he spoke for the first
time to the Assembly, it was to defend
in forthright fashion the right of the
press to express itself freely. On
1 and 5 May of the same year, he de-
manded that Parliament reject the law
of"security", under which anyone
printing a newspaper was obliged to
make a preliminary payment and give
certain guarantees."It has been esta-
blished", he declared,"that the press Is
a weapon and as thus it must remain
a common possession. The common
law demands that anyone who misuses
a weapon to commit a crime or offence,
be punished, but the common law does
not ask anyone to give a guarantee that
he will not misuse it."
In spite of his opposition, the law
establishing"security"and restraining
press freedom was approved. The
following year, Benjamin Constant
again took up the cudgels when he
spoke on the penalties contemplated for
"Neither
Executioners
Nor Victims"
BENJAMIN CONSTANTwas not a revolu-
tionary. All attacks
on freedom, no matter
what the principle mo-
tivating them, horrified
him. And if he denied
other political parties
the right to oppress
anyone, he also denied
such rights to his own
with the same vigour.
"We struggle against
all censorship", he de-
clared at the tribune on
7 July, 1821 ;"not like
greedy pretenders who
destroy what they can-
not seize, but as men
who will neither tole-
rate nor employ means
of oppression ; as men who desire for
others, as for themselves, freedom,
security, justice..."
In these words, Benjamin Constant
defined, not so much a politico ! attitude,
as a moral position. Circumstances may
change, society may take on another
appearance, economies, frontiers, modes
of life, civilizations may alter, but the
words of Benjamin Constant will never
be denied. The defenders of liberty
will always be those who wish"neither
to tolerate nor employ means of oppres-
sion", who refuse to become either
executioners or victims.
On the 10 December, 1830, at the age
of 63, Benjamin Constant died. Some
days earlier, he had accomplished the
last act of his parliamentary career.
This had begun on 14 Capri !, 1819, when
he made a speech on uio freedom of
the press. It ended after he presenter
a draft bill, later rejected, on the free-
dom of the printers'trade.
All the honours refused to him during
his life-time were rendered him after
death. His coffin was carried to the
PÃªre Lachaise Cemetery in Paris,
escorted by the national guard, and
followed by ministers, members of
Parliament and a huge crowd.
